The Sun contains more than 99% of the mass of the system, and Jupiter is more massive than all the other planets combined. The centre of gravity of the Solar System lies just outside the surface of the Sun, due mainly to the mass of Jupiter. The Solar System is divided into two parts. There are four relatively small, rocky planets (Mercury, Venus, the EarthandMars), beyondwhichcometheasteroids, ofwhich only one (Ceres) is over 900 km in diameter. Next come the four giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune), plus Pluto, which is smaller than our Moon and has an unusual orbit which brings it at times closer in than Neptune. Pluto may not be worthy of true planetary status, and may be only the largest member of the ‘Kuiper Belt’ swarm of asteroidal- sized bodies moving in the far reaches of the Solar System. However, Pluto does seem to be in a class of its own, and in size is intermediate between the smallest principal planet (Mercury) and the largest asteroid (Ceres). Planetary data are given in Table 1.1. It now seems that the distinctions between the various classes of bodies in the Solar System are less clear-cut than has been previously thought. For example, it is quite probable that some ‘near-Earth asteroids’, which swing away from the main swarm, are ex-comets which have lost their volatiles; and some of the smaller satellites of the giant planets are almost certainly ex-members of the asteroid belt which were captured long ago. All planets and asteroids move round the Sun in the same sense, and so do the larger satellites in orbit round their primaryplanets, althoughsomeofthesmallasteroidal-sized satellites have retrograde motion (for example, the four outer members of Jupiter’s family and Phœbe in Saturn’s). The orbits of the main planets are not greatly inclined to that of the Earth, apart from Pluto (17 ◦ ), so that to draw a plan of the planetary system on a flat piece of paper is not grossly inaccurate. However, some asteroids have highly-inclined orbits, and so do many comets. It is now thought that short- period comets, all of which have direct motion, come from the Kuiper Belt, while long-period comets, many of which move in a retrograde sense, come from the more distant Oort Cloud. Most of the planets rotate in the same sense as the Earth, but Venus and Pluto have retrograde rotation, while Uranus is unique in having an axial inclination which is greater than a right angle. The cause of these anomalies is unclear. O RIGIN O F T HE S OLAR S YSTEM In investigating the origin of the planetary system we do have one important piece of information: the age of the Earth is certainly of the order of 4.6 thousand million 1 years and the Sun, in some form, must obviously be rather older than this. Meteorites are, in general, found to be of about the same age, while the oldest lunar rocks are only slightly younger. Many theories have been proposed. In 1796 the French astronomer Pierre Simon de Laplace put forward the Nebular Hypothesis, which was in some ways not unlike earlier ideas due to Thomas Wright in England and Immanuel Kant in Germany, but was much more credible. Laplace started with a vast gas cloud, disk-shaped and in slow rotation, which shrank steadily and threw off rings, each of which condensed into a planet, while the central part of the cloud became the Sun. However, it was found that a ring of this sort would not condense into a planet. Moreover, according to the Nebular Hypothesis, most of the angular momentum of the Solar System would reside in the Sun, which would be in quick rotation; actually, most of the angular momentum is due to the giant planets. 1 I avoid using ‘billion’, because the American billion (now generally accepted) is equal to a thousand million, while the old English billion was equal to a million million.

C. Chamberlin and F. R. Moulton, in America, worked out a theory according to which the planets were pulled off the Sun by the action of a passing star; a cigar-shaped tongue of material would be pulled out and this would break up into planets, with the largest planets (Jupiter and Saturn) in the middle part of the system, where the thickest part of the ‘cigar’ would have been. Again there were insuperable mathematical objections, and a modification of the theory by A. W. Bickerton (New Zealand), involving a ‘partial impact’, was no better. The original theory was popularized by Sir James Jeans during the first half of the 20th century, but it has now been abandoned. If it had been valid, planetary systems would have been very rare in the Galaxy; close encounters between two stars seldom occur. Later, G. P. Kuiper proposed that the Sun had a binary companion which never condensed into a proper star, but was spread around to produce planet-forming material; but again there were mathematical objections, and the theory never met with wide support. Modern theories are much more akin to Laplace’s than to later proposals. It is thought that the Solar System began in a huge gas-and-dust cloud, part of which started to collapse and to rotate – possibly triggered off by the effects of a distant supernova. A ‘solar nebula’ was produced, and in a relatively short period, perhaps 100 000 years, the core turned into what may be called a protostar, the effects of which forced the solar nebula into a flattened, rotating disk. The temperature rose at the centre, and the proto-Sun became a true star; for a while it went through what is known as the T Tauri stage, sending out a strong ‘stellar wind’ which forced outward the lightest gases, notably hydrogen and helium. The planets built up by accretion. The inner, rocky planets lacked the lightest materials, while inthemoredistantregions, wherethetemperaturewasmuch lower, the giant planets could form. Jupiter and Saturn grew rapidly enough to draw in material from the solar nebula; Uranus and Neptune, slower to form, could not do so in the same way, because by the time they had become sufficiently massive the nebula had more or less dispersed. This is why Uranus and Neptune contain lesser amounts of hydrogen and helium and more ‘ices’. Nuclear processes began in the Sun, and the Solar System began to assume its present form, although at first the Sun was less luminous than it is now. In its early stages there was a great deal of material which did not condense into planetary form, and the planets were subjected to heavy bombardment, resulting in impact cratering. The main bombardment ended around 4000 million years ago, but the effects of it are still very obvious, as can be seen from the structures visible on the surfaces of the rocky bodies (see Table 1.2). At present the Solar System is essentially stable, and will remain so until the Sun leaves the Main Sequence and becomes a giant star. This will certainly result in the destruction of the inner planets, so that the Solar System as we know it does have a limited life-span. 2 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"T HE S OLAR S YSTEM Table 1.2.

He assumed the Earth to be flat, and gave the Sun’s distance as 6500 km (using modern units), with a diameter of over 50 km. A much better estimate was made by Aristarchus of Samos, around 270 BC. His value, derived from observations of the angle between the Sun and the exact half-moon, was approximately 4800 000 km; his method was perfectly sound in theory, but the necessary measurements could not be made with sufficient accuracy. (Aristarchus also held the belief that the Sun, not the Earth, is the centre of the planetary system.) Ptolemy (c AD 150) increased the distance to 8000 000 km, but in his book published in AD 1543 Copernicus reverted to only 3200 000 km. Kepler, in 1618, gave a value of 22 500 000 km. ThefirstreasonablyaccurateestimateoftheEarth–Sun distance (the astronomical unit) was made in 1672 by G. D. Cassini, from observations of the parallax of Mars. Some later determinations are given in Table 2.2. One early method involved transits of Venus across the face of the Sun, as suggested by J. Gregory in 1663 and extended by Edmond Halley in 1678; Halley rightly concluded that transits of Mercury could not give accurate results because of the smallness of the planet’s disk. In fact, the transit of Venus method was affected by the ‘Black Drop’ –the apparent effect of Venus drawing a strip of blackness after it during ingress on to the solar disk, thus making precise timings difficult. (Captain Cook’s famous voyage, during which he discovered Australia, was made in order to take the astronomer C. Green to a suitable site (Tahiti) in order to observe the transit of 1769.) Results from the transits of Venus in 1874 and 1882 were still unsatisfactory, and better estimates came from the parallax measurements of planets and (particularly) asteroids. However, Spencer Jones’ value as derived from the close approach of the asteroid Eros in 1931 was too high. 4 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"T HE S UN Table 2.2.

R OTATION The first comments about the Sun’s rotation were made by Galileo, following his observations of sunspots from 1610. He gave a value of rather less than one month. The discovery that the Sun shows differential rotation – i.e. that it does not rotate as a solid body would do – was made by the English amateur Richard Carrington in 1863; the rotational period at the equator is much shorter than that at the poles. Synodic rotation periods for features at various heliographiclatitudesaregiveninTable2.3. Spotsarenever seen either at the poles or exactly on the equator, but from 1871 H. C. Vogel introduced the method of measuring the solar rotation by observing the Doppler shifts at opposite limbs of the Sun. Table 2.3.

The first measurements were made by Sir John Herschel THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 5"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"T HE S UN in 1837–8, using an actinometer (basically a bowl of water; the estimate was made by the rate at which the bowl was heated). He gave a value which is about half the actual figure. The modern value is 1.95 cal cm 2 min − 1 (1368 W m 2 ). S OLAR P HOTOGRAPHY The first photograph of the Su n – a Daguerreotype – seems to have been taken by Lerebours, in France, in 1842. However, the first good Daguerreotype was taken by Fizeau and Foucault, also in France, on 2 April 1845, at the request of F. Arago. In 1854 B. Reade used a dry collodion plate to show mottling on the disk. The first systematic series of solar photographs was taken from Kew (outer London) from 1858 to 1872, using equipment designed by the English amateur Warren de la Rue. Nowadays the Sun is photographed daily from observatories all over the world, and there are many solar telescopes designed specially for this work. Many solar telescopes are of the ‘tower’ type, but the largest solar telescope now in operation, the McMath Telescope at Kitt Peak in Arizona, looks like a large, white inclined tunnel. At the top is the upper mirror (the heliostat), 203 cm in diameter; it can be rotated, and sends the sunlight down the tunnel in a fixed direction. At the bottom of the 183 m tunnel is a 152 cm mirror, which reflects the rays back up the tunnel on to the half-way stage where a flat mirror sends the rays down through a hole into the solar laboratory, where the analyses are carried out. This means that the heavy equipment in the solar laboratory does not have to be moved at all. S UNSPOTS The bright surface of the Sun is known as the photosphere, and it is here that we see the dark patches which are always called sunspots. Really large spot-groups may be visible with the naked eye, and a Chinese record dating back to 28 BC describes a patch which was ‘a black vapour as large as a coin’. There is a Chinese record of an ‘obscuration’ in the Sun, which may well have been a spot, as early as 800 BC. The first observer to publish telescope drawings of sunspots was J. Fabricius, from Holland, in 1611, and although his drawings are undated he probably saw the spots toward the end of 1610. C. Scheiner, at Ingoldt ̈ adt, recorded spots in March 1611, with his pupil C. B. Cysat. Scheiner wrote a tract which came to the notice of Galileo, who claimed to have been observing sunspots since November 1610. No doubt all these observers recorded spots telescopically at about the same time (the date was close to solar maximum) but their interpretations differed. Galileo’s explanation was basically correct. Scheiner regarded the spots as dark bodies moving round the Sun close to the solar surface; Cassini, later, regarded them as mountains protruding through the bright surface. Today we know that they are due to the effects of bipolar magnetic field lines below the visible surface. Direct telescopic observation of the Sun through any telescope is highly dangerous, unless special filters or special equipment is used. The first observer to describe the projection method of studying sunspots may have been Galileo’s pupil B. Castelli. Galileo himself certainly used the method, and said (correctly) that it is ‘the method that any sensible person will use’. This seems to dispose of the legend that he ruined his eyesight by looking straight at the Sun through one of his primitive telescopes. A major spot consists of a darker central portion (umbra) surrounded by a lighter portion (penumbra); with a complex spot there may be many umbræ contained in one penumbral mass. Some ‘spots’ at least are depressions, as can be seen from what is termed the Wilson effect, announced in 1774 by A. Wilson of Glasgow. He found that with a regular spot, the penumbra toward the limbward side is broadened, compared with the opposite side, as the spot is carried toward the solar limb by virtue of the Sun’s rotation. From these observations, dating from 1769, Wilson deduced that the spots must be hollows. The Wilson effect can be striking, although not all spots and spot-groups show it. Some spot-groups may grow to immense size. The largest group on record is that of April 1947; it covered an area of 18 130 000 000 km 2 , reaching its maximum on 8 April. To be visible with the naked eye, a spot-group must cover 500 millionths of the visible hemisphere. (One millionth of the hemisphere is equal to 3000 000 km 2 .) A large spot-group may persist for several rotations. The present record for longevity is held by a group which 6 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"T HE S UN Table 2.4.

A pore is usually regarded as a feature no more than 2500 km in diameter. The darkest parts of spots – the umbræ – still have temperatures of around 4000 ◦ C, while the surrounding photosphere is at well over 5000 ◦ C. This means that a spot is by no means black, and if it could be seen shining on its own the surface brightness would be greater than that of an arc-lamp. The accepted Z ̈ urich classification of sunspots is given in Table 2.4. Sunspots are essentially magnetic phenomena, and are linked with the solar cycle. Every 11 years or so the Sun is active, with many spot-groups and associated phenomena; activity then dies down to a protracted minimum, after which activity builds up once more toward the next maximum. A typical group has two main spots, a leader and a follower, which are of opposite magnetic polarity. The magnetic fields associated with sunspots were discovered by G. E. Hale, from the United States, in 1908. This resulted from the Zeeman effect (discovered in 1896 by the Dutch physicist P. Zeeman), according to which the spectral lines of a light source are split into two or three components if the source is associated with a magnetic field. It was Hale who found that the leader and the follower of a two-spot group are of opposite polarity – and that the conditions are the same over a complete hemisphere of the Sun, although reversed in the opposite hemisphere. At the end of each cycle the whole situation is reversed, so that it is fair to say that the true cycle (the ‘Hale cycle’) is 22 years in length rather than 11. The magnetic fields of spots are very strong, and may exceed 4000 G. With one group, seen in 1967, the field reached 5000 G. The preceding and following spots of a two-spot group are joined by loops of magnetic field lines which rise high into the solar atmosphere above. The highly magnetized area in, around and above a bipolar sunspot group is known as an active region . The modern theory of sunspots is based upon pioneer work carried out by H. Babcock in 1961. The spots are produced by bipolar magnetic regions (i.e. adjacent areas of opposite polarity) formed where a bunch of concentrated field lines emerges through the photosphere to form a region of outward-directed or positive field; the flux tube then curves round in a loop, and re-enters to form a region of inward-directed or negative field. This, of course, explains why the leader and the follower are of opposite polarity. Babcock’s original model assumed that the solar magnetic lines of force run from one magnetic pole to the other below the bright surface. An initial polar magnetic field is located just below the photosphere in the convective zone. The Sun’s differential rotation means that the field is ‘stretched’ more at the equator than at the poles. After many rotations, the field has become concentrated as toroids to either side of the equator, and spot-groups are produced. At the end of the cycle, the toroid fields have diffused poleward and formed a polar field with reversed polarity, and this explains the Hale 22-year cycle. Each spot-group has its own characteristics, but in general the average two-spot group begins as two tiny specks at the limit of visibility. These develop into proper spots, growing and also separating in longitude at a rate of around 0.5 km s − 1 . Within two weeks the group has reached its maximum length, with a fairly regular leader together with a less regular follower. There are also various minor spots and clusters; the axis of the main pair has rotated until it is roughly parallel with the solar equator. After the group has reached its peak, a decline sets in; the leader is usually the last survivor. Around 75% of groups fit into this pattern, but others do not conform, and single spots are also common.

The brightest features of this type seen in integrated light are the faculæ . The discovery of faculæ was made by C. Scheiner, probably about 1611. Faculæ (Latin, ‘torches’) are clouds of incandescent gases lying above the brilliant surface; they are composed largely of hydrogen, and are best seen near the limb, where the photosphere is less bright than at the centre of the disk (in fact, the limb has only two-thirds the brilliance of the centre, because at the centre we are looking down more directly into the hotter material). Faculæ may last for over two months, although their average lifetime is about 15 days. They often appear in areas where a spot- group is about to appear, and persist after the group has disappeared. Polar faculæ are different from those of the more central regions, and are much less easy to observe; they are most common near the minimum of the sunspot cycle, and have latitudes higher than 65 ◦ north or south, with lifetimes ranging from a few days to no more than 12 min. They may well be associated with coronal plumes. Even in non-spot zones, the solar surface is not calm. The photosphere is covered with granules, which are bright, irregular polygonal structures; each is around 1000 km in diameter, and may last from 3 to 10 min (8 min is about the average). They are vast convective cells of hot gases, rising and falling at average speeds of about 0.5 km s − 1 ; the gases rise at the centre of the granule and descend at the edges, so that the general situation has been likened to a boilingliquid, althoughthephotosphereisofcourseentirely gaseous. They cover the whole photosphere, except at sunspots, and it has been estimated that at any one moment the whole surface contains about 4 000 000 granules. At the centre of the disk the average distance between granules is of the order of 1400 km. The granular structure is easy to observe; the first really good pictures of it were obtained from a balloon, Stratoscope II, in 1957. Supergranulation involves large organized cells, usually polygonal, measuring around 30 000 km in diameter; each contains several hundreds of individual granules. They last from 20 h to several days, and extend up into the chromosphere (the layer of the Sun’s atmosphere immediately above the photosphere). Material wells up at Table 2.5.

Thus the most important flares are classified as 4B. the centre of the cell, spreading out to the edges before sinking again. Spicules are needle-shaped structures rising from the photosphere, generally along the borders of the supergranules, at speeds of from 10 to 30 km s − 1 . About half of them fade out at peak altitude, while the remainder fall back into the photosphere. Their origin is not yet completely understood. Flares are violent, short-lived outbursts, usually occurring above active spot-groups. They emit charged particles as well as radiations ranging from very short gamma-rays up to long-wavelength radio waves; they are most energetic in the X-ray and EUV (extreme ultra-violet) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. They produce shock waves in the corona and chromosphere, and may last for around 20 min, although some have persisted fo r2hand one, on 16 August 1989, persisted for 13 h. They are most common between 1 and 2 years after the peak of a sunspot cycle. They are seldom seen visually. The first flare to be observed in ‘white’ light was observed by R. Carrington on 1 September 1859, but generally flares have to be studied with spectroscopic equipment or the equivalent. Observed in hydrogen light, they are classified according to area. The classification is given in Table 2.5. It seems that flares are explosive releases of energy stored in complex magnetic fields above active areas. They are powered by magnetic reconnection events, when oppositely-directed magnetic fields meet up and reconnect to form new magnetic structures. As the field lines snap into their new shapes, the temperature rises to tens of millions of degrees in a few minutes, and clouds of plasma are sent outward through the solar atmosphere into space; 8 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"T HE S UN the situation has been likened to the sudden snapping of a tightly-wound elastic band. These huge ‘bubbles’ of plasma, containing thousands of millions of tons of material, are known as Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). The particles emitted by the flare travel at a slower speed than the radiations and reach Earth a day or two later, striking the ionosphere and causing ‘magnetic storms’ – one of which, on 13 March 1977, disrupted the entire communications network in Quebec. Auroræ are also produced. Cosmic rays and energetic particles sent out by flares may well pose dangers to astronauts moving above the protective screen of the Earth’s atmosphere, and, to a much lesser extent, passengers in very high-flying aircraft. Flares are, in fact, amazingly powerful and a major flare may release as much energy as 10 000 million one- megaton nuclear bombs. Some of the ejected particles are accelerated to almost half the speed of light. T HE S OLAR C YCLE The first suggestion of a solar cycle seems to have come from the Danish astronomer P. N. Horrebow in 1775–6, but his work was not published until 1859, by which time the cycle had been definitely identified. In fact the 11-year cycle was discovered by H. Schwabe, a Dessau pharmacist, who began observing the Sun regularly in 1826 – mainly to see whether he could observe the transit of an intra- Mercurian planet. In 1851 his findings were popularized by W. Humboldt. A connection between solar activity and terrestrial phenomena was found by E. Sabine in 1852, and in 1870 E. Loomis, at Yale, established the link between the solar cycle and the frequency of auroræ. The cycle is by no means perfectly regular. The mean value of its length since 1715 has been 11.04 years, but there are marked fluctuations; the longest interval between successive maxima has been 17.1 years (1788 to 1805) and the shortest has been 7.3 years (1829.9 to 1837). Since 1715, when reasonably accurate records began, the most energetic maximum has been that of 1957.9; the least energetic maximum was that of 1816. (See Table 2.6) There are, moreover, spells when the cycle seems to be suspended, and there are few or no spots. Four of these spells have been identified with fair certainty: the Oort Minimum (1010–1050), the Wolf Minimum Table 2.6. Sunspot maxima and minima, 1718–1999.

Of these the best authenticated is the last. Attention was drawn to it in 1894 by the British astronomer E. W. Maunder, based on earlier work by F. G. W. Sp ̈ orer in Germany. Maunder found, from examining old records, that between 1645 and 1715 there were virtually no spots at all. It may well be significant that this coincided with a very cold spell in Europe; during the 1680s, for example, the Thames froze every winter, and frost fairs were held on it. Auroræ too were lacking; Edmond Halley recorded that he saw his first aurora only in 1716, after forty years of watching. Records of the earlier prolonged minima are fragmentary, but some evidence comes from the science of tree rings, dendrochronology, founded by an astronomer, A. E. Douglass. High-energy sonic rays which pervade the THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 9"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"T HE S UN Galaxy transmute a small amount of atmospheric nitrogen to an isotope of carbon, C-14, which is radioactive. When trees assimilate carbon dioxide, each growth ring contains a small percentage of carbon-14, which decays exponentially with a half-life of 5730 years. At sunspot maximum, the magnetic field ejected by the Sun deflects some of the cosmic rays away from the Earth, and reduces the level of carbon-14 in the atmosphere, so that the tree rings formed at sunspot maximum have a lower amount of the carbon-14 isotope. Careful studies were carried out by F. Vercelli, who examined a tree which lived between 275 BC and AD 1914. Then, in 1976, J. Eddy compared the carbon-14 record of solar activity with records of sunspots, auroræ and climatic data, and confirmed Maunder’s suggestion of a dearth of spots between 1645 and 1715. Yet strangely, although there were virtually no records of telescopic sunspots during this period, naked-eye spots were recorded in China in 1647, 1650, 1655, 1656, 1665 and 1694; whether or not these observations are reliable must be a matter for debate. There is strong evidence for a longer cycle superimposed on the 11-year one. The law relating to the latitudes of sunspots (Sp ̈ orer’s Law) was discovered by the German amateur F. G. W. Sp ̈ orer in 1861. At the start of a new cycle after minimum, the first spots appear at latitudes between 30 ◦ and 45 ◦ north or south. As the cycle progresses, spots appear closer to the equator, until at maximum the average latitude of the groups is only about 15 ◦ north or south. The spots of the old cycle then die out (before reaching the equator), but even before they have completely disappeared the first spots of the new cycle are seen at the higher latitudes. This was demonstrated by the famous ‘Butterfly Diagram’, first drawn by Maunder in 1904. The Wolf or Z ̈ urich sunspot number for any given day, indicating the state of the Sun at that time, was worked out by R. Wolf of Z ̈ urich in 1852. The formula is R = k( 10 g + f) , where R is the Z ̈ urich number, g is the number of groups seen, f is the total number of individual spots seen and k is a constant depending on the equipment and site of the observer ( k is usually not far from unity). The Z ̈ urich number may range from zero for a clear disk up to over 200. A spot less than about 2500 km in diameter is officially classed as a pore. Rather surprisingly, the Sun is actually brightest at spot maximum. The greater numbers of sunspots do not compensate for the greater numbers of brilliant plages. S PECTRUM A ND C OMPOSITION O F T HE S UN The first intentional solar spectrum was obtained by Isaac Newtonin1666, buthenevertooktheseinvestigationsmuch further, although he did of course demonstrate the complex nature of sunlight. The sunlight entered the prism by way of a hole in the screen, rather than a slit. In 1802 W. H. Wollaston, in England, used a slit to obtain a spectrum and discovered the dark lines, but he merely took them to be the boundaries between different colours of the rainbow spectrum. The first really systematic studies of the dark lines were carried out in Germany by J. von Fraunhofer, from 1814. Fraunhofer realized that the lines were permanent; he recorded 5740 of them and mapped 324. They are still often referred to as the Fraunhofer lines. The explanation was found by G. Kirchhoff, in 1859 (initially working with R. Bunsen). Kirchhoff found that the photosphere yields a rainbow or continuous spectrum; the overlying gases produce a line spectrum, but since these lines are seen against the rainbow background they are reversed, and appear dark instead of bright. Since their positions and intensities are not affected, each line may be tracked down to a particular element or group of elements. In 1861–2 Kirchhoff produced the first detailed map of the solar spectrum. (His eyesight was affected, and the work was actually finished by his assistant, K. Hofmann.) In 1869 Anders ̊ Angstr ̈ om, of Sweden, studied the solar spectrum by using a grating instead of a prism, and in 1889 H. Rowland producedadetailedphotographicmapofthesolarspectrum.

All the other elements combined make up only 2%. The numbers of atoms in the Sun relative to one million atoms of hydrogen are given in Table 2.9. Helium was identified in the Sun (by Norman Lockyer, in 1868) before being found on Earth. Lockyer named it after the Greek ηλιoς , the Sun. It was detected on Earth in 1894 by Sir William Ramsay, as a gas occluded in cleveite. For a time it was believed that the corona contained another element unknown on Earth, and it was even given a name – coronium – but the lines, described initially by Harkness and Young at the eclipse of 1869, proved to be due to elements already known. In 1940 B. Edl ́ en, of Sweden, showed that the coronium lines were produced by highly ionized iron and calcium. S OLAR E NERGY Most of the radiation emitted by the Sun comes from the photosphere, which is no more than about 500 km deep. It is easy to see that the disk is at its brightest near the centre; there is appreciable limb darkening – because when we look at the centre of the disk we are seeing into deeper and hotter layers. It is rather curious to recall that there were once suggestions that the interior of the Sun might be cool. This was the view of Sir William Herschel, who believed that below the bright surface there was a temperature region which might well be inhabited – and he never changed his view (he died in 1822). Few of his contemporaries agreed with him, but at least his reputation ensured that the idea of a habitable Sun would be taken seriously. And as recently as 1869 William Herschel’s son, Sir John, was still maintaining that a sunspot was produced when the luminous clouds rolled back, bringing the dark, solid body of the Sun itself into view 1 . Spectroscopic work eventually put paid to theories of this kind. The spectroheliograph, enabling the Sun to be photographed in the light of one element only, was invented by G. E. Hale in 1892; its visual equivalent, the 1 It may be worth recalling that in 1952 a German lawyer, Godfried B ̈ uren, stated that the Sun had a vegetation-covered inner globe, and offered a prize of 25 000 marks to anyone who could prove him wrong. The leading German astronomical society took up the challenge, and won a court case, although whether the prize was actually paid does not seem to be on record! So far as I know, the last serious protagonist of theories of this sort was an English clergyman, the Reverend P. H. Francis, who held a degree in mathematics from Cambridge University.

In 1933 B. Lyot, in France, developed the Lyot filter, which is less versatile but more convenient, and also allows the Sun to be studied in the light of one element only. But how did the Sun produce its energy? One theory, proposed by J. Waterson and, in 1848, by J. R. Mayer, involved meteoritic infall. Mayer found that a globe of hot gas the size of the Sun would cool down in 5000 years or so if there were no other energy source, while a Sun made up of coal, and burning furiously enough to produce as much heat as the real Sun actually does, would be turned into ashes after a mere 4600 years. Mayer therefore assumed that the energy was produced by meteorites striking the Sun’s surface. Rather better was the contraction theory, proposed in 1854 by H. von Helmholtz. He calculated that if the Sun contracted by 60 m per year, the energy produced would suffice to maintain the output for 15 000 000 years. This theory was supported later by the great British physicist Lord Kelvin. However, it had to be abandoned when it was shown that the Earth itself is around 4600 million years old – and the Sun could hardly be younger than that. In 1920 Sir Arthur Eddington stated that atomic energy was necessary, adding ‘Only the inertia of tradition keeps the contraction hypothesis alive – or, rather, not alive, but an unburied corpse’. The nuclear transformation theory was worked out by H. Bethe in 1938, during a train journey from Washington to Cornell University. Hydrogen is being converted into helium, so that energy is released and mass is lost; the decrease in mass amounts to 4000 000 tons per second. Bethe assumed that carbon and nitrogen were used as catalysts, but C. Critchfield, also in America, subsequently showed that in solar-type stars the proton–proton reaction is dominant. Slight variations in output occur, and it is often claimed that it is these minor changes which have led to the Ice Ages which have affected the Earth now and then throughout its history, but for the moment at least the Sun is a stable, well- behaved Main Sequence star. The core temperature is believed to be around 15 000 000 ◦ C, and the density to be about 10 times as dense as solid lead. The core extends one-quarter of the way from the centre of the globe to the outer surface; about THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 13"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"T HE S UN 37% of the original hydrogen has been converted to helium. Outside the core comes the radiative zone, extending out to 70% between the centre and the surface; here, energy is transported by radiative diffusion. In the outer layers it is convection which is the transporting agency. It takes radiation about 170 000 years to work its way from the core to the bottom of the convective zone, where the temperature is over 2000 000 ◦ C. This seems definite enough, but we have to admit that our knowledge of the Sun is far from complete. In particular, there is the problem of the neutrinos – or lack of them. Neutrinos are particles with no ‘rest’ mass and no electrical charge, so that they are extremely difficult to detect. Theoretical considerations indicate that the Sun should emit vast quantities of them, and in 1966 efforts to detect them were begun by a team from the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the USA, led by R. Davis. The ‘telescope’ is located in the Homestake Gold Mine in South Dakota, inside a deep mineshaft, and consists of a tank of 454 600 l of cleaning fluid (tetrachloroethylene). Only neutrinos can penetrate so far below ground level (cosmic rays, which would otherwise confuse the experiment, cannot do so). The cleaning fluid is rich in chlorine, and if a chlorine atom is struck by a neutrino it will be changed into a form of radioactive argon – which can be detected. The number of ‘strikes’ would therefore provide a key to the numbers of solar neutrinos. In fact, the observed flux was much smaller than had been expected, and the detector recorded only about one- third the anticipated numbers of neutrinos. The same result was obtained by a team in Russia, using 100 tons of liquid scintillator and 144 photodetectors in a mine in the Donetsk Basin. Further confirmation came from Kamiokande in Japan, using light-sensitive detectors on the walls of a tank holding 3000 tons of water. When a neutrino hits an electron it produces a spark of light, and the direction of this, as the electron moves, tells the direction from which the neutrino has come – something which the Homestake detector cannot do. Another sort of detector, in Russia, uses gallium-71; if hit by a neutrino, this gallium will be converted to germanium-71. Another gallium experiment has been set up in Gran Sasso, deep in the Apennines, and yet another detector is in the Caucasus Mountains. In each case the neutrino flux in unexpectedly low. There are also indications that the neutrinos are least plentiful around the time of sunspot maximum, although as yet the evidence is not conclusive. Various theories have been proposed to explain the paucity of solar neutrinos. It is known that neutrinos are of several different kinds, and the Homestake detector can trap only those with relatively low energies; even so, the number of events recorded each month should have been around 25, whereas actually it was on average no more than 9. If the Sun’s core temperature is no more than around 14 000 000 ◦ C, as against the usually assumed 15 600 000 ◦ C, the neutrino flux would be easier to explain, but this raises other difficulties. Another suggestion is that the core temperature is reduced by the presence of WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles). A WIMP is quite different from ordinary matter, and is said to have a mass from 5 to 10 times that of a proton, but the existence of WIMPs has not been proved, and many authorities are decidedly sceptical about them. At the moment it is fair to say that the solar neutrino problem remains unsolved. Predictably, the Sun sends out emissions along the whole range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Infra-red radiation was detected in 1800 by William Herschel, during an examination of the solar spectrum; he noted that there were effects beyond the limits of red light. In 1801 J. Ritter detected ultra-violet radiation, by using a prism to produce a solar spectrum and noting that paper soaked in NaCl was darkened if held in a region beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum. Cosmic rays from the Sun were identified by Scott Forbush in 1942, and in 1954 he established that cosmic-ray intensity decreases when solar activity increases (Forbush effect). The discovery of radio emission from the Sun was made by J. S. Hey and his team, on 27–28 February 1942. Initially, the effect was thought to be due to German jamming of radar transmitters. The first radar contact with the Sun was made in 1959, by Eshleman and his colleagues at the Stanford Research Institute in the United States. Solar X-rays are blocked by the Earth’s atmosphere, so that all work in this field has to be undertaken by space research methods. The first X-ray observations of the Sun were made in 1949 by investigators at the United States Naval Research Laboratory. 14 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"T HE S UN S OLAR P ROBES Thefirstattemptatcarryingoutsolarobservationsfromhigh altitude was made in 1914 by Charles Abbott, using an au- tomated pyrheliometer launched from Omaha by hydrogen- filled rubber balloons. The altitude reached was 24.4 km, and in 1935 a balloon, Explorer II, took a two-man crew to the same height. The initial attempt at solar research using a modern-type rocket was made in 1946, when a captured and converted German V.2 was launched from White Sands, New Mexico; it reached 55 km and recorded the solar spec- trum down to 2400 ̊ A. The first X-ray solar flares were recorded in 1956, from balloon-launched rockets, although solar X-rays had been identified as early as 1948. Many solar probes have now been launched. (In 1976 one of them, the German-built Helios 2, approached the Sun to within 45 000 000 km.) The first vehicle devoted entirely to studies of the Sun was OSO 1 (Orbiting Solar Observatory 1) of 1962; it carried 13 experiments, obtaining data at ultra-violet, X-ray and gamma-ray wavelengths. Extensive solar observations were made by the three successive crews of the first US space-station, Skylab, in 1973–4. The equipment was able to monitor the Sun at wavelengths from visible light through to X-rays. The last of the crews left Skylab on 8 February 1974, although the station itself did not decay in the atmosphere until 1979. Solar work was also undertaken by many of the astronauts on the Russian space-station Mir, from 1986. One vehicle of special note was the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM), launched on 14 February 1980 into a circular, 574 km orbit. It was designed to study the Sun duringthepeakofacycle. Followingafault, thevehiclewas repaired in April 1984 by a crew from the Space Shuttle, and finally decayed on 2 December 1989. The Ulysses probe (1990) was designed to study the poles of the Sun, which can never be seen well from Earth. The Japanese probe Yohkoh (‘Sunbeam’) has been an outstanding success, as has SOHO (the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) from 1995. SOHO has, indeed, played a major r ˆ ole in the new science of helioseismology. A selected list of solar probes is given in Table 2.10. H ELIOSEISMOLOGY The first indications of solar oscillation were detected as long ago as 1960; the period was found to be 5 minutes, and it was thought that the effects were due to a surface ‘ripple’ in the outer 10 000 km of the Sun’s globe. More detailed results were obtained in 1973 by R. H. Dicke, who was attempting to make measurements of the polar and equatorial diameters of the Sun to see whether there were any appreciable polar flattening. Dicke found that the Sun was ‘quivering like a jelly’, so that the equator bulges as the poles are flattened, but the maximum amplitude is only 5 km, and the velocities do not exceed 10 m s − 1 . This was the real start of the science of helioseismol- ogy. Seismology involves studies of earthquake waves in the terrestrial globe, and it is these methods which have told us most of what we know about the Earth’s interior. Helio- seismology is based on the same principle. Pressure waves – in effect, sound waves – echo and resonate through the Sun’s interior. Any such wave moving inside the Sun is bent or refracted up to the surface, because of the increase in the speed of sound with increased depth. When the wave reaches the surface it will rebound back downward, and this makes the photosphere move up and down. The amplitude is a mere 25 m, with a temperature change of 0 . 005 ◦ C, but these tiny differences can be measured by the famil- iar Doppler principle involving tiny shifts in the positions of well-defined spectral lines. Waves of different frequen- cies descent to different depths before being refracted up toward the surface – and the solar sound waves are very low-pitched; the loudest lies about 12 1 2 octaves below the lowest note audible to human beings. There are, of course, a great many frequencies involved, so that the whole situation is very complex indeed. Various ground-based programmes are in use – such as GONG, the Global Oscillation Network Group, made up of six stations spread out round the Earth so that at least one of them can always be in sunlight. However, more spectacular results have come from spacecraft, of which one of the most important is Soho – the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. Soho was put into an unusual orbit. It remains 1 500 000 km from the Earth, exactly on a line joining the Earth to the Sun; its period is therefore 365.2 days – the same as ours – and it remains in sunlight, and in contact with Earth, all the time. It lies in a stable point, known as a Lagrangian point, so that as seen from Earth it is effectively motionless. It was launched on 2 December 1995, and after a series of manœuvres arrived at its Lagrangian point in THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 15"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"T HE S UN Table 2.10.

There was an alarm on 25 June 1996, when contact was lost, and it was feared that the whole mission had come to an end; but Soho was reacquired on 27 July, from the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico, and was in full operation again by 20 September. Soho has been immensely informative. For example, it has detected vast solar tornadoes whipping across the Sun’s surface, with gusts up to 500 000 km h − 1 . There are jet streams below the visible surface, and definite ‘belts’ in which material moves more quickly than the gases to either side. There has been a major surprise, too, with regard to the Sun’s general rotation. On the surface, the rotation period is 25 days at the equator, rising to 27.5 days at latitudes 40 ◦ north or south and as much as 34 days at the poles. This differential rotation persists to the base of the convection zone, but here the whole situation changes; the equatorial rotation slows down and the higher-latitude rotation speeds up. The two rates become equal at a distance about half-way between the surface and the centre of the globe; deeper down, the Sun rotates in the manner of a solid body. As yet it must be admitted that the reasons for this bizarre behaviour are unknown. It has also been found that the entire outer layer of the Sun, down to about 24 000 km, is slowly but steadily flowing from the equator to the poles. The polar flow rate is no more than 80 km h − 1 , as against the rotation speed of 6400 km h − 1 , but this is enough to transport an object from the equator to the pole in little over a year. T HE S OLAR A TMOSPHERE With the naked eye, the outer surroundings of the Sun – the solar atmosphere – can be seen only during a total solar eclipse. With modern-type equipment, or from space, they can however be studied at any time, although the outer corona is more or less inaccessible except by using space research methods. The structure of the Sun is summarized in Table 2.11. Above the photosphere, rising to 5000 km, is the chromosphere (‘colour-sphere’), so named because its hydrogen content gives it a strong red colour as seen during a total eclipse. The temperature rises quickly with altitude (remembering that the scientific definition of temperature depends upon the speeds at which the atomic particles THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 17"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"T HE S UN Table 2.11. Structure of the Sun. Core The region where energy is being generated. The outer edge lies about 175 000 km from the Sun’s centre. The core temperature about 15 000 000 ◦ C; the density 150 g cm − 3 (10 times the density of lead). The temperature at the outer edge is about half the central value. Radiative zone Extends from the outer edge of the core to the interface layer, i.e. from 25 pc to 70 pc of the distance from the centre to the surface. Tempe ratures range from 7 000 000 ◦ Catthe base to 2 000 000 ◦ C at the top; the density decreases from 20 g cm − 3 (about the density of lead) to 0.2 g cm − 3 (less than the density of water). Interface layer Separates the radiative zone from the convective zone. The solar magnetic field is generated by a magnetic dynamo in this layer. Convective zone Extends from 200 000 km to the visible surface. At the bottom of the zone the temperature is low enough for heavier ions to retain electro ns; the material then inhibits the flow of radiation, and the trapped heat leads to ‘boiling’ at the surface. Convective motions are seen as granules and supergranules. Photosphere The visible surface; temperature 5700 ◦ C, density 0.000 0002 g cm − 3 (1 / 10 000 of that of the Earth’s air at sea level). Sunspots are seen here. Faculæ lie on and a few hundred km above the bright surface. Chromosphere The layer above the photosphere, extending to 5000 km above the bright surface. The temperature increases rapidly with altitude, until the chromosphere merges with the transition layer. The Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum are produced in the chromosphere, which acts as a ‘reversing layer’. During a total eclipse the chrom osphere appears as a red ring round the lunar disk (hence the name: colour-sphere). Transition region A narrow layer separating the chromosphere from the higher-temperature corona. Corona The outer atmosphere; temperature up to 2000 000 ◦ C, density on average about 10 − 15 gcm − 3 . The solar wind originates here. Heliosphere A ‘bubble’ in space produced by the solar wind and inside which the Sun’s influence is dominant. Heliopause The outer edge of the heliosphere, where the solar wind merges with the interstellar medium and loses its identity; the distance from the Su n is probably about 150 a.u. move around, and is by no means the same as the ordinary definition of ‘heat’; the chromosphere is so rarefied that it certainly is not ‘hot’). The dark Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum are produced in the chromosphere. Rising from the chromosphere are the prominences, structures with chromospheric temperatures embedded in the corona. They were first described in detail by the Swedish observer Vassenius at the total eclipse of 1733, although he believed them to belong to the Moon rather than to the Sun. (They may have been recorded earlier, in 1706, by Stannyan at Berne.) It was only after the eclipse of 1842 that astronomers became certain that they are solar rather than lunar. Prominences (once, misleadingly, known as Red Flames) are composed of hydrogen. Quiescent promi- nences may persist for weeks or even months, but eruptive prominences show violent motions, and may attain heights of several hundreds of thousands of kilometres. Follow- ing the eclipse of 19 August 1868, J. Janssen (France) and Norman Lockyer (England) developed the method of ob- serving them spectroscopically at any time. By observing at hydrogen wavelengths, prominences may be seen against the bright disk of the Sun as dark filaments, sometimes termed flocculi. (Bright flocculi are due to calcium.) Above the chromosphere, and the thin transition re- gion, comes the corona, the ‘pearly mist’ which extends out- ward from the Sun in all directions. It has no definite bound- ary; it simply thins out until its density is no greater than that of the interplanetary medium. The density is in fact very low – less than one million millionth of that of the Earth’s air at sea-level, so that its ‘heat’ is negligible even though the temperature reaches around 2000 000 ◦ C. Because of its high temperature, it is brilliant at X-ray wavelengths. Seen during a total eclipse, the corona is truly magnificent. The first mention of it may have been due to the Roman writer Plutarch, who lived from about AD 46 to 120. Plutarch’s book ‘On the Face in the Orb of the Moon’ contains a reference to ‘a certain splendour’ around the eclipsed Sun which could well have been the corona. The corona was definitely recorded from Corfu during the eclipse of 22 December 968. The astronomer Clavius saw it at the eclipse of 9 April 1567, but regarded it as merely the uncovered edge of the Sun; Kepler showed that this could not be so, and attributed it to a lunar atmosphere. After observing the eclipse of 16 June 1806 from Kindehook, New York, the Spanish astronomer Don Jos ́ e Joaquin de Ferrer pointed out that if the corona were due to a lunar atmosphere, then the height of this atmosphere would have to be 50 times greater than that of the Earth, which was clearly unreasonable. However, it was only after careful studies of the eclipses of 1842 and 1851 that the corona and the prominences were shown unmistakably to belong to the Sun rather than to the Moon. There is some evidence that during eclipses which occurred during the Maunder Minimum (1645–1715) the corona was virtually absent, although the records make it impossible to be sure. Certainly the shape of the corona at spot-maximum is more symmetrical than at spot-minimum, when there are streamers and ‘wings’ – as was first recognized after studies of the eclipses of 1871 and 1872. 18 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"T HE S UN The high temperature of the corona was for many years a puzzle. It now seems that the cause is to be found in what is termed ‘magnetic reconnection’. This occurs when magnetic fields interact to produce what may be termed short circuits; the fields ‘snap’ to a new, lower- energy state, rather reminiscent of the snapping of a twisted rubber band. Vast amounts of energy are released, and can produce flares and other violent phenomena as well as causing the unexpectedly high coronal temperature. A reconnection event was actually recorded, on 8 May 1998, from a spacecraft, TRACE (the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer), which had been launched on 1 April 1998 specifically to study the Sun at a time when solar activity was starting to rise toward the peak of a new cycle. T HE S OLAR W IND The corona is the source of what is termed the solar wind – a stream of particles being sent out from the Sun all the time. The first suggestion of such a phenomenon was made in the early1950s, whenitwasrealizedthattheSun’sgravitational pull is not strong enough to retain the very high-temperature coronal gas, so that presumably the corona was expanding and was being replenished from below. L. Biermann also drew attention to the fact that the tails of comets always point away from the Sun, and he concluded that the ion or gas tails are being ‘pushed outward’ by particles from the Sun. In this he was correct. (The dust tails are repelled by the slight but definite pressure of solar radiation.) In 1958 E. N. Parker developed the theory of the expanding corona, and his conclusions were subsequently verified by results from space-craft. One of these was Mariner 2, sent to Venus in 1962. En route, Mariner not only detected a continuously flowing solar wind, but also observed fast and slow streams which repeated at 27 day intervals, suggesting that the source of the wind rotated with the Sun. The solar wind consists of roughly equal numbers of protons and electrons, with a few heavier ions. It leads to a loss of mass of about 10 12 tons per year (which may sound a great deal, but is negligible by solar standards). As the wind flows past the Earth its density is of the order of 5 atoms cm − 3 ; the speed usually ranges between 200 and 700 km s − 1 , with an average value of 400 km s − 1 , although the initial speed away from the Sun may be as high as 900 km s − 1 . The fast component of the wind comes from low solar latitudes; the average velocity is of the order of 800 km s − 1 . The slow component comes from coronal holes, where the density is below average; coronal holes are often found near the poles, and here the magnetic field lines are open, making it easier for wind particles to escape. The wind is ‘gusty’, and when at its most violent the particles bombard the Earth’s magnetosphere, producing magnetic storms and displays of auroræ. From Earth it is difficult to study the polar regions of the Sun, because our view is always more or less broadside- on; the same is true of most space-craft. The only way to obtain a good view of the solar poles is to send a probe out of the ecliptic, and this was done with Ulysses, launched from Cape Canaveral on 6 October 1990. It was first sent out to Jupiter, and on 8 February 1992 it flew past the Giant Planet, using Jupiter’s strong gravitational pull to send it into the required orbit. It flew over the Sun’s south pole on 26 June 1994, and over the north pole on 31 July 1995. Some of the findings were unexpected; the magnetic conditions in the polar regions were not quite what had been anticipated. Note that Ulysses will never fly close to the Sun, and in fact it will always remain outside the orbit of the Earth. Its own orbital period is six years. How far does the solar wind extend? Probably out to a distance of about 150 a.u., where it will merge with the interstellar medium and cease to be identifiable. This ‘heliopause’ marks the outer edge of the heliosphere, the area of space inside which the Sun’s influence is dominant.

With it Lyot was able to examine the inner corona and its spectrum, but the outer corona remained inaccessible. The greatest number of eclipses possible in one year is seven; thus in 1935 there were five solar and two lunar eclipses, and in 1982 there were four solar and three lunar. The least number possible in one year is two, both of which must be solar, as in 1984. The length of the Moon’s shadow varies between 381 000 km and 365 000 km, with a mean of 372 000 km. As the mean distance of the Moon from the Earth is 384 000 km, the shadow is on average too short to reach the Table 2.14. British annular eclipses, 1800–2200.

The track of totality across the Earth’s surface can never be more than 272 km wide, and in most cases the width is much less than this. A partial eclipse is seen to either side of the track of totality, although some partial eclipses are not total or annular anywhere on Earth. The longest possible duration of totality is 7 min 31 s. This has never been observed, but at the eclipse of 20 June 1955 totality over the Philippines lasted for 7 min 8 s. 2 The calculations were made by Fred Espenak of NASA. I thank him for allowing me to quote them. The longest totality during the 21st century will be on 22 July 2009 (6 min 30 s). The shortest possible duration of totality can be less than 1 s. This happened at the eclipse of 3 October 1986, which was annular along most of the central track, but total for about 1 / 10 s over a restricted area in the North Atlantic Ocean. (So far as I know, it was not observed.) The shortest total eclipse of the 21st century will be that of 6 December 2067: a mere 8 s. Annularity can last for longer; the maximum is as much as 12 min 24 s. The annular eclipse of 15 January 2010 will last for 11 mi n8s– that of 16 December 2085 for only 19 s.

On 24 October 2098 the obscuration amounts to no more than 0.004%. The longest totality ever observed was during the eclipse of 30 June 1973. A Concorde aircraft, specially equipped for the purpose, flew underneath the Moon’s shadow, keeping pace with it so that the scientists on board (including the British astronomer John Beckman) saw a totality lasting for 72 min. They were carrying out observations at millimetre wavelengths, and at their height of 55 000 feet were above most of the water vapour in our atmosphere which normally hampers such observations. They were also able to see definite changes in the corona and prominences during their flight. The Moon’s shadow moves over the Earth at up to 3000 km h − 1 , so that only Concorde can easily match it. The first recorded solar eclipse seems to have been that of 2136 BC, seen in China during the reign of the Emperor Chung K’ang. A famous story is attached to it. The Chinese believed that during an eclipse the Sun was being attacked by a hungry dragon, and the only remedy was to beat drums, bang gongs, shout and wail, and in general make as much noise as possible in order to scare the dragon away. Not surprisingly this procedure always worked. It was the duty of the Court astronomers to give warning of a forthcoming eclipse, and it has been said that on this occasion the astronomers, who rejoiced in the names of Hsi and Ho, forgot – with the result that they were executed for negligence. Alas, there can be no doubt that this story is apocryphal .... The next eclipse which may be dated with any certainty is that of 1375 BC, described on a clay tablet found at Ugarit in Syria. Predictions were originally made by studies of the Saros period. This is the period after which the Sun, Moon and node arrive back at almost the same relative positions. It amounts to 6585.321 solar days, or approximately 18 years 11 days. Therefore, an eclipse tends to be followed by an- other eclipse in the same Saros series 18 years 11 days later, although conditions are not identical, and the Saros is at best a reasonable guide. (For example, the eclipse of June 1927 was total over parts of England, but the ‘return’, in July 1945, was not.) One Saros series lasts for 1150 years; it in- cludes 64 eclipses, of which 43 or 44 are total, while the rest are partial eclipses seen from the polar zones of the Earth. The first known predictions about which we have reasonably reliable information were made by the Greeks. There does seem good evidence that the eclipse of 25 May 585 BC was predicted by Thales of Miletus, the first of the great Greek philosophers. It occurred near sunset in the Mediterranean area, and is said to have put an end to a battle between the forces of King Alyattes of the Lydians and King Cyraxes of the Medes; the combatants were so alarmed by the sudden darkness that they concluded a hasty peace. Eclipse stories and legends are plentiful. Apparently the Emperor Louis of Bavaria was so frightened by the eclipse of 840 that he collapsed and died, after which his three sons engaged in a ruinous war over the succession. TherewasalsothecuriouscaseofGeneralWilliamHarrison (later President of the United States) when he was Governor of Indiana Territory, and was having trouble with the Shawnee prophet Tenskwatawa. He decided to ridicule him by claiming that he could make the Sun stand still and the Moon to ‘alter its course’. Unluckily for him, the prophet knew more astronomy than the General, and he was aware that an eclipse was due on 16 July 1806. He therefore said that he would demonstrate his own power by blotting out the Sun. A crowd gathered at the camp, and the prophet timed his announcement at just the right moment, so that Harrison was nonplussed (although in 1811 he did destroy the Shawnee forces at the Battle of Tippecanoe). The first total solar eclipse recorded in the United States was that of 24 June 1778, when the track passed from Lower California to New England. Two years later, on 21 October 1780, a party went to Penobscot, Maine, to observe an eclipse; it was led by S. Williams of Harvard and had been given ‘free passage’ by the British forces. Unfortunately, a mistake in the calculations meant that the astronomers went to the wrong place, and remained outside the track of totality. The first American expedition to Europe was more successful; on 28 July 1851 G. P. Bond took a party to Scandinavia, and obtained good results. Astronomers have always been ready to run personal risks to study eclipses, and one man who demonstrated this in 1870 was Jules Janssen, a leading French expert concern- ing all matters relating to the Sun. The eclipse was due on 22 December. Janssen was in Paris, but the city was sur- rounded by the German forces, and there was no obvious 24 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"T HE S UN escape route. Janssen’s solution was to fly out in a hot-air balloon. He arrived safely at Oran – only to be met with an overcast sky. He could certainly count himself unlucky. In Britain, eclipse records go back a long way. The first account comes from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; the eclipse took place on 15 February 538, four years after the death of Cerdic, the first King of the West Saxons. The Sun was two-thirds eclipsed from London. The celebrated chronicler William of Malmesbury gave a graphic description of the eclipse of 1133: the Sun ‘shrouded his glorious face, as the poets say, in hideous darkness, agitating the hearts of men by an eclipse and on the sixth day of the week there was so great an earthquake that the ground appeared to sink down; a horrid noise being first heard beneath the surface’. In fact there can be no connection between an eclipse and a ground tremor, but William was again busy at the eclipse of 1140: ‘It was feared that Chaos had come again ... it was thought and said by many, not untruly, that the King [Stephen] would not continue a year in the government.’ (In fact, Stephen reigned until 1154.) Several Scottish eclipses were given nicknames; Black Hour (1433), Black Saturday (1598), Mirk Monday (1652). The eclipse of 1715 was well observed over much of England. Edmond Halley saw it, and gave a vivid descrip- tion of the corona: ‘A luminous ring of a pale whiteness, or rather pearl colour, a little tinged with the colours of the Iris, and concentric with the Moon.’ He was also the first to see Baily’s Beads – brilliant spots caused by the Sun’s rays shining through valleys on the lunar limb immediately before and immediately after totality. They can sometimes be seen during an annular eclipse (as by Maclaurin, from Edinburgh, on 1 March 1737) but the first really detailed de- scription of them was given in 1836, at the annular eclipse of 15 May, by Francis Baily, after whom they are named. (They were first photographed at the eclipse of 7 August 1869 by C. F. Hines and members of the Philadelphia Pho- tographic Corps, observing from Ottuma in Iowa.) The last British mainland totality before 1927 was that of 1724. Unfortunately the weather was poor and the only good report came from a Dr. Stukeley, from Haraden Hill nearSalisbury. Thespectacle, hewrote, ‘wasbeyondallthat hehadeverseenorcouldpicturetohisimaginationthatmost solemn’. The eclipse was much better seen from France. In 1927 the track crossed parts of Wales and North England, but there was a great deal of cloud and the best results came from Giggleswick, where the Royal Astronomical Society party was stationed. Totality was brief – only 2 4s–butthe clouds cleared away at the vital moment, and useful pho- tographs were obtained. On 30 June 1954 the track brushed the tip of Unst, northernmost of the Shetland Islands, but most observers went to Norway or Sweden. On 11 August 1999 the track crossed Devon and Cornwall, but most of the areawascloudy, thoughthepartialphasewaswellseenfrom most of the rest of Britain. Turkey and Iran had good views; the prominences were particularly striking – not at all sur- prising as the Sun was rising to the peak of its 11-year cycle. The maximum theoretical length of a British total eclipse is 5.5 min. That of 15 June 885 lasted for almost 5 min, and so will the Scottish total eclipse of 20 July 2381. Another phenomenon seen at a total eclipse is that of shadow bands, wavy lines crossing the landscape just before and just after totality; they are, of course, produced in the Earth’s atmosphere. They were first described by H. Goldschmidt at the eclipse of 1820. The first attempt to photograph a total solar eclipse was made by the Austrian astronomer Majocci on 8 July 1842. He failed to record totality, although he did manage to photograph the partial phase. The first real success, showing the corona and prominences, was due to Berkowski on 28 July 1851, using the 6.25 K ̈ onigsberg heliometer with an exposure time of 24 s. The flash spectrum was first photographed by the American astronomer C. Young on 22 December 1870. (The flash spectrum is the sudden change in the Fraunhofer lines from dark to bright, when the Moon blots out the photosphere in the background and the chromosphere is left shining ‘on its own’.) The flash spectrum was first observed during an annular eclipse by Pogson, in 1872. Nowadays, of course, total eclipses are shown regularly on television. The first attempt to show totality on television from several stations spread out along the track was made by the BBC at the eclipse of 15 February 1961. All went well, and totality was shown successively from France, Italy and Yugoslavia. There was, however, one bizarre incident. I was stationed atop Mount Jastreba ˇ c, in Yugoslavia, and with our party were several oxen used to haul the equipment up to the summit. It is quite true that THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 25"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"T HE S UN animals tend to go to sleep as darkness falls, and, unknown to me, the Yugoslav director decided to show this as soon as totality began – so he trained the cameras on to the oxen and, just to make sure that the viewers were treated to a good view, he switched on floodlights! The last total eclipse will probably occur in about 700 million years from now. By then the Moon will have recededtoabout29 000kmfurtherawayfromtheEarth, and the disk will no longer appear large enough to cover the Sun. E VOLUTION O F T HE S UN The Sun is a normal Main Sequence star. It is in orbit round the centre of the Galaxy; the period is of the order of 225 000 000 years – sometimes known as the ‘cosmic year’. One cosmic year ago, the most advanced creatures on Earth were amphibians; even the dinosaurs had yet to make their entry. (It is interesting to speculate as to conditions here one cosmic year hence!) The apex of the Sun’s way – i.e. the point in the sky toward which it is moving – is RA 18h, declination + 34 ◦ , in Hercules; the antapex is at RA 6h, declination − 34 ◦ , in Columba. The age of the Earth is about 4.6 thousand million years, and the Sun is certainly older than this, so that per- haps 4800 million years to around 5000 million years is a reasonable estimate. The Sun was born inside a giant gas cloud, perhaps 50 light-years in diameter, which broke up into globules, one of which produced the Sun. The first stage was that of a protostar, surrounded by a co- coon of gas and dust which may be termed a solar neb- ula (an idea first proposed by Immanuel Kant as long ago as the year 1755). Contraction led to increased heat; there was a time when the fledgling star varied irregularly, and sent out an energetic ‘wind’ (the so- called T Tauri stage), but eventually the cocoon was dispersed, and the Sun became a true star. When the core temperature reached around 10 000 000 ◦ C, nuclear reactionsbegan. InitiallytheSunwasonly70%asluminous asitisnow, buteventuallyitsettledontotheMainSequence, and began a long period of comparatively steady existence. The supply of available hydrogen ‘fuel’ is limited, and asitagestheSunisboundtochange. Overthenextthousand million years there will be a slow but inexorable increase in luminosity, and the Earth will become intolerably hot from our point of view. Worse is to come. Four thousand million years from now the Sun’s luminosity will have increased threefold, so that the surface temperature of the Earth will soar to 100 ◦ C and the oceans will be evaporated. Another thousand million years, and the Sun will leave the Main Sequence to become a giant star, with different nuclear reactions in the core. There will be a period of instability, with swelling and shrinking (the ‘asymptotic giant’ stage) but eventually the Sun’s diameter will grow to 50 times its present size; the surface temperature will drop, but the overall luminosity will increase by a factor of at least 300, with disastrous results for the inner planets. The temperature at the solar core will reach 100 000 000 ◦ C and helium will react to produce carbon and oxygen. A violent solar wind will lead to the loss of the outer layers, so that for a relatively brief period on the cosmical scale the Sun will become a planetary nebula. Finally, all that is left will be a very small, dense core made up of degenerate matter; the Sun will have become a white dwarf, with all nuclear reactions at an end. After an immensely long period – perhaps several tens of thousands of millions of years – all light and heat will depart, and the end product will be a cold, dead black dwarf, perhaps still circled by the ghosts of the remaining planets. It does not sound an inviting prospect, but at least it need not alarm us. The Sun is no more than half-way though its career on the Main Sequence; it is no more than middle- aged. 26 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"3T HE M OON The Moon is officially ranked as the Earth’s satellite.

However, it sometimes happens that there are two full moons in a calendar month and one month (February) may have none. Thus in 1999 there were two full moons in January (on the 2nd and the 31st), none in February and two again in March (on the 2nd and the 31st, as with January). By tradition a second full moon in a month is known as a blue moon , but this has nothing whatsoever to do with a change in colour. (This is not an old tradition. It comes from the misinterpretation of comments made in an American periodical, the Maine Farmers’ Almanac ,in 1937.) Yet the Moon can occasionally look blue, due to conditions in the Earth’s atmosphere. For example, this happened on 26 September 1950, because of dust in the upper air raised by vast forest fires in Canada. A blue moon was seen on 27 August 1883 caused by material sent up by the volcanic outburst at Krakatoa, and green moons were seen in Sweden in 1884 – at Kalmar, on 14 February, for 3 min, and at Stockholm on 12 January, also for 3 min. Other full moons have nicknames (Table 3.2), but of these only two are in common use. In the northern hemisphere, the full moon closest to the autumnal equinox, which falls around 22 September, is called Harvest Moon THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 27"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"T HE M OON because the ecliptic then makes its shallowest angle with the horizon, and the retardation – that is to say, the time lapse between moonrise on successive nights – is at its minimum; it may be no more than 15 min, although for most of the year it amounts to at least 30 min. It was held that this was useful to farmers gathering in their crops. Harvest Moon looks the same as any other full moon – and it is worth noting that the full moon looks no larger when low down than when high in the sky. Certainly it does give this impression, but the ‘Moon Illusion’ is an illusion and nothing more. In Islam, the calendar follows a purely lunar cycle, so that over a period of about 33 years the months slowly regress through the seasons. Each month begins with the first sighting of the crescent Moon, and this is important in Islamic religion. An early sighting was made on 15 March 1972 by R. Moran of California, who used 10 × 50 binoculars and glimpsed the Moon 14h 53m past conjunction; on 21 January 1996 P. Schwann, from Arizona, used 25 × 60 binoculars to glimpse the Moon only 12h 30m after conjunction. (As an aside: in 1992 a British political party, the Newcastle Green Party, announced that it would meet at new moon to discuss ideas and at full moon to act upon them. They have not, so far, won any seats in Parliament!) There is no conclusive evidence of any link between the lunar phases and weather on Earth, or of any effect upon living things – apart from aquatic creatures, since the Moon is the main agent in controlling the ocean tides. During the crescent stage the ‘night’ part of the Moon can usually be seen shining faintly. This is known as the Earthsbine andisduesolelytolightreflectedontotheMoon by the Earth – as was first realized by Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519). M oon l egends a nd M oon w orship Every country has its own Moon legends – and who has not heard of the Man in the Moon? According to a German tale, the Old Man was a villager caught stealing cabbages, and was placed in the Moon as a warning to others; he was also a thief in Polynesian lore. Frogs and toads have also found their way there, and stories about the hare in the Moon are widespread. From China comes a delightful story. A herd of elephants made a habit of drinking at the Moon Lake, and trampled down many of the local hare population. The chief hare then had an excellent idea; he told the elephants that by disturbing the waters they were angering the Moon- Goddess, bydestroyingherreflection. Theelephantsagreed that this was most unwise, and made a hasty departure. To the people of Van, in Turkey, the Moon was a young bachelor who was engaged to the Sun. Originally the Moon had shone in the daytime and the Sun at night, but the Sun, being feminine, was afraid of the dark – and so they changed places. In many mythologies the Sun is female and the Moon male, although this is not always the case. For example, in Greenland it is said that the Sun and Moon were brother and sister, Anninga and Malina. When Malina smeared her brother’s face with soot, she fled to avoid his anger; reaching the sky, she became the Sun. Anninga followed and became the Moon, but he cannot fly equally high, and so he flies round the Sun hoping to surprise her. When he becomes tired at the time of lunar First Quarter, he leaves his house on a sled towed by four dogs, and hunts seals until he is ready to resume the chase. There were many Moon gods, such as Artemis (Greece), Diana (Rome), Isis (Egypt) and Tsuki-yomi-no- kami (Japan). Moon worship continued until a surprisingly late stage, at least in Britain; from the Confessional of Ecgbert, Archbishop of York, in the 8th century it seems that homage was still being paid to the Moon as well as to the Sun. R OTATION O F T HE M OON TheMoon’srotationissynchronous(captured); i.e.theaxial rotation period is the same as the orbital period. This means that the same area of the Moon is turned Earthward all the time, although the eccentricity of the lunar orbit leads to libration zones which are brought alternately in and out of view. FromEarth, 59%oftheMoon’ssurfacecanbestudied at one time or another; only 41% is permanently out of view. There is no mystery about this behaviour; tidal forces over the ages have been responsible. Most other planetary satellites also have synchronous rotation with respect to their primaries. The barycentre, or centre of gravity of the Earth–Moon system, lies 1707 km beneath the Earth’s surface, so that the statement that ‘the Moon moves round the Earth’ is not really misleading. 28 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"T HE M OON The fact that the Moon has synchronous rotation was noted by Cassini in 1693; Galileo may also have realized it. The libration zones are so foreshortened that from Earth they are difficult to map, and good maps were not possible until the advent of space-craft. The first images of the averted 41% were obtained in 1959 by the Russian vehicle Luna (or Lunik) 3. Because of tidal effects, the Moon is receding from the Earth at a rate of 3.83 cm/year; also, the Earth’s rotation period is lengthening, on average, by 0.000 0002 s / day, although motions of material inside the Earth mean that there are slight irregularities superimposed on the tidal increase in period. O RIGIN O F T HE M OON Many theories have been advanced to explain the origin of the Moon. The attractive theory due to G. H. Darwin in 1881 – that the proto-Earth rotated so rapidly that it threw off a large piece of material, which became the Moon – is mathematically untenable. H. C. Urey proposed that the Moon accreted from the solar nebula in the same way as the Earth and became gravitationally linked later, but this would require a set of very special circumstances, and does not account for the Moon’s lower density compared with the Earth. Then, in 1974, a completely different idea was put forward in America by W. Hartmann and D. R. Davis. This involves a collision between the Earth and a large impacting body, comparable in size with Mars, about 4000 million years ago. According to this theory, the cores of the Earth and the impactor merged, and mantle d ́ ebris ejected during the collision accreted to form the Moon. This picture may not be accurate, but at least it seems more plausible than any of the other theories. (Urey once made the caustic comment that because all theories of the lunar origin seemed unlikely, science had proved that the Moon does not exist!) M INOR S ATELLITES No minor Earth satellites of natural origin seem to exist. Careful searches have been made for them, notably in 1957 by Clyde Tombaugh (discoverer of the planet Pluto), but without result. A small satellite reported in 1846 by F. Pettit, Director of the Toulouse Observatory in France, was undoubtedly an error in observation – although Jules Verne found it very useful in his great novel From the Earth to the Moon and its sequel Round the Moon (1865 and 1871). Clouds of loose material on the Moon’s orbit, at the Lagrangian points, were reported by the Polish astronomer K. Kordylewski in 1961, but remain unconfirmed, and efforts made on various occasions to photograph them have been unsuccessful. M APPING T HE M OON It is possible that the first map of the Moon dates back 5000 years! A rudimentary etching found on a tomb at Knowle in County Meath (Ireland) does give an impression of a map of the lunar surface. Dr. Philip Brooke, who has made a careful study of it, estimates that it was made around 3000 BC. The first suggestion that the Moon is mountainous was made by the Greek philosopher Democritus (460–370 BC). Earlier, Xenophanes (c 450 BC) had supposed that there were many suns and moons according to the regions, divisions and zones of the Earth! Certainly the main maria and some other features can be seen with the naked eye, and the first map which has come down to us was that of W. Gilbert, drawn in 1600, although it was not published until 1651 (Gilbert died in 1603). Telescopes became available in the first decade of the 17th century. The first known telescopic map was produced in July 1609 by Thomas Harriot, one-time tutor to Sir Walter Raleigh. It shows a number of identifiable features, and was more accurate than Galileo’s map of 1610. Another very early telescopic observer of the Moon was Sir William Lower, an eccentric Welsh baronet. His drawings, made in or about 1611, have not survived, but he compared the appearance of the Moon with a tart that his cook had made – ‘Here some bright stuffe, there some darke, and so confusedlie all over’. Galileo did at least try to measure the heights of some of the lunar mountains, from 1611, by the lengths of their shadows. He concentrated on the lunar Apennines, and although he over-estimated their altitudes his results were of the right order. Much better results were obtained by J. H. Schr ̈ oter, from 1778. The first systems of nomenclature were introduced in 1645 by van Langren (Langrenus) and in 1647 by Hevelius, THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 29"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"T HE M OON but few of these names have survived; for example, the crater we now call Plato was named by Hevelius ‘the Greater Black Lake’. At that time, of course, it was widely although not universally believed that the bright areas were lands, and the dark areas were watery. The modern-type system was introduced in 1651 by the Jesuit astronomer G. Riccioli, who named the features in honour of scientists – plus a few others. He was not impartial; for instance, he allottedamajorformationtohimselfandanothertohispupil Grimaldi, and he did not believe in the Copernican theory, thattheEarthmovesroundtheSun–sohe‘flungCopernicus into the Ocean of Storms’. Riccioli’s principle has been followed since, although clearly all the major craters were used up quickly and later distinguished scientists had to be given formations of lesser importance, at least until it became possible to map the Moon’s far side by using space research methods. Other maps followed, some of which are listed in Table 3.3. Tobias Mayer in 1775 was the first to introduce a system of lunar coordinates, although the first accurate measurements with a heliometer were not made until 1839, by the German astronomer F. W. Bessel. Undoubtedly the first really great lunar observer was J. H. Schr ̈ oter, whose astronomical career extended from 1778, when he set up his private observatory at his home in Lilienthal, near Bremen in Germany, until 1813, when his observatory was destroyed by invading French troops (the soldiers even plundered his telescopes, which were brass-tubed and were taken to be made of gold). Schr ̈ oter made many drawings of lunar features and was also the first to give a detailed description of the rills 1 , although some of these had been seen earlier by the Dutch observer Christiaan Huygens. In 1837–8 came the first really good map of the Moon, drawn by W. Beer and J. H. M ̈ adler from Berlin. Although they used a small telescope (Beer’s 3.75 inch or 9.50 cm refractor) their map was a masterpiece of careful, accurate work, and it remained the standard for several decades. They also published a book, Der Mond , which was a detailed description of the whole of the visible surface. A larger map completed in 1878 by Julius Schmidt was based 1 Often spelled rilles; I have kept to the original spelling. They can also be known as clefts. Table 3.3.

Neison (real name, Nevill). Other useful atlases were those of Elger (1895) and Goodacre (1910, revised 1930); in 1930 the Welsh observer H. Percy Wilkins published a vast map, 300 inches (over 500 cm) in diameter; it was re-issued, to one-third the scale, in 1946. The first good photographic atlas was published in 1899 by the Paris astronomers Loewy and Puiseux, but the first actual photographs date back much fur- ther; a Daguerreo-type was taken on 23 March 1840 by J. W. Draper, using a 12.0 cm reflector, but the image was less than 3 cm across and required an exposure time of 20 min. Nowadays, of course, there are photographic at- lases of the entire surface, obtained by space-craft, and it is fair to say that the Moon is better charted than some re- gions of the Earth. However, special mention should be made of an Earth-based photographic atlas produced by H. R. Hatfield, using his 32 cm reflector. It was re-issued 30 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"T HE M OON in 1999, and is ideal for use by the amateur observer, as it shows all areas of the Moon under different conditions of illumination. There were, of course, some oddities. No less a person than the great Sir William Herschel, who died in 1822, never wavered in his belief that the Moon must be inhabited, and in 1822 the German astronomer F. von Paula Gruithuisen described a structure with ‘dark gigantic ramparts’, which hewasconvincedwasatruecitybuiltbythelocalpopulace– although in fact the area shows nothing but low, haphazard ridges. There was also the famous Lunar Hoax of 1835, when a daily paper, the New York Sun , published some quite fictitious reports of discoveries made by Sir John Herschel from the Cape of Good Hope. The reports were written by a reporter R. A. Locke, and included descriptions of bat- men and quartz mountains. The first article appeared on 25 August, and was widely regarded as authentic; only on 16 September did the Sun confess to a hoax. One religious group in New York City even started to make plans to send missionaries to the Moon in an attempt to convert the bat- men to Christianity. This sounds very strange, but as late as the 1930s one eminent astronomer, W. H. Pickering, was maintaining that certain dark patches on the Moon might be due to the swarms of insects or even small animals. Only since the start of the Space Age have we been sure that the Moon is, and always has been, totally sterile. S URFACE F EATURES The most prominent surface features are of course the maria (seas). Although they have never contained water (as one eminent authority, H. C. Urey, believed as recently as 1966), they are undoubtedly old lava plains, and there are many ‘ghost’ craters whose walls have been virtually levelled by the lava. Of similar type are the ‘lakes’, ‘marshes’ and ‘bays’ (lacus, palus, sinus). Some of the maria, such as Imbrium and Crisium, are more or less regular in outline; others, such as Frigoris, are very irregular. Details of the Mare-type regions are given in Table 3.12 (page 47). The largest of the ‘regular’ seas is the Mare Imbrium, with a diameter of over 1000 km; it is bounded in part by the mountain ranges of the Apennines, Alps and Carpathians. Its area is about the same as that of Pakistan, but the irregular Oceanus Procellarum is considerably larger, and in area it is in fact greater than our Mediterranean. Most of the main seas make up a connected system; the exception is the distinct Mare Crisium. It is worth noting that although foreshortening makes it seem elongated in a north–south direction, the east–west diameter is actually greater (590 km, as against 490 km). Its area is about the same as that of the American state of Kansas. In general, the regular maria are the more depressed; thus the Mare Crisium lies about 4 km below the mean sphere, whereas the depth of the Oceanus Procellarum is on average only about 1 km. There are no comparable seas on the far side of the Moon; the Mare Moscoviense and Mare Ingenii are smaller than some of the formations which are classed as craters. However, it is true that one major sea, the Mare Orientale, does extend on to the far side. Only its extreme eastern boundary is accessible from Earth. The main central area has a diameter of over 300 km; the outer rings extend for much further – out to more than 900 km 2 . The smaller mare-type features extend from the main seas. The Sinus Iridum (Bay of Rainbows) is particularly beautiful. It leads off the Mare Imbrium, and when the Sun is rising over it the western mountain border is first to catch the solar rays, so that for a brief period we see the appearance known popularly as the ‘jewelled handle’. The ‘seaward’ wall has been levelled; only vague, discontinuous traces of it remain. The largest and deepest basin on the surface is the South Pole-Aitken Basin, which is 2500 km across and lies around 12 km below the mean sphere. It was surveyed by the Clementine space-craft in 1994; it covers almost a quarter of the Moon’s circumference. Smaller multi- ring basins (Apollo, Orientale and Korolev) lie in the same general area. Craters are listed in Table 3.13 (page 48) and Table 3.14 (page 66). They are of many types; very often ‘walled plains’ would be a better term. In profile, a crater 2 I discovered this formation in 1939, with the modest telescope in my observatory in Sussex; libration was at maximum, and I assumed that I was seeing the boundary of a minor limb-sea of the Humboldtianum type. I suggested its name – Mare Orientale, the Eastern Sea – but later the International Astronomical Union decided to reverse lunar east and west, so that the Eastern Sea is now on what is termed the Moon’s western limb! THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 31"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"T HE M OON is more like a shallow saucer than a mine-shaft; the walls rise to only a modest height above the outer surface, while the floors are depressed. Central mountains or mountain groups are very common, but never attain the height of the outer ramparts. The depths of some craters are given in Table 3.4, but it must be remembered that these are at best no more than approximate. Some craters near the poles are so deep that their floors are always in shadow and therefore remain bitterly cold; one of these craters, Newton, has an depth of over 8 km below the crest of the wall. Some craters, such as Grimaldi and Plato, have dark floors which make them identifiable under any conditions of illumination. There are also some very bright craters; the most brilliant of these is Aristarchus, which often appears prominent even when lit only by Earthshine. It has terraced walls and a prominent central peak. Some craters are the centres of systems of bright rays which stretch for long dis- tances over the surface; the most prominent of these ray sys- tems are associated with Copernicus, in the Mare Nubium, and Tycho in the southern uplands. Other important ray centres include Kepler, Olbers, Anaxagoras and Thales. The rays are not visible under low illumination, but near the time of full moon they dominate the entire scene. One remarkable crater, Wargentin, is lava-filled, so that it is a large plateau. There are other plateaux here and there, but none even remotely comparable with Wargentin. The most conspicuous rills (Table 3.5) on the Moon are those on the Mare Vaporum area (Hyginus, Ariadæus) and the Hadley Rill in the Apennine area, visited by the Apollo 15 astronauts. The Hadley Rill is 135 km long, 1–2 km wide and 370 m deep. Other famous rills are associated with Sirsalis, B ̈ urg, Hesiodus, Triesnecker, Ramsden and Hippalus. Extending from Herodotus, near Aristarchus, is the imposing valley known as Schr ̈ oter’s Valley in honour of its discoverer; in a way this is misleading, since the crater named after Schr ̈ oter is in a completely different area. It is worth noting that some rills are in part crater chains; the Hyginus Rill is an example of this, as it consists of a chain of small confluent craters. A much larger crater valley is to be found near Rheita, in the south-east quadrant of the Moon. Domes, up to 80 km in diameter, are found in various parts of the Moon – for instance near Arago in the Mare Tranquillitatis, in the Aristarchus area, and on the floor of Table 3.4. Crater depths.

In 1945 the American geologist and selenographer J. E. Spurr drew attention to the ‘lunar grid’ system, made up of families of linear features aligned in definite directions. It is also obvious that the distribution of the craters is not random; they form groups, chains and pairs, and when one crater intrudes into another it is almost always the smaller feature which breaks into the larger. O RIGIN O F T HE L UNAR F ORMATIONS This is a problem which has caused considerable controversy – and to a certain extent still does. Eccentric theories have not been lacking; for example P. Fauth, who died in 1943, supported the idea that the Moon is covered with ice. Weisberger, who died in 1952, denied the existence of any mountains or craters, and attributed the effects to storms and cyclones in a dense lunar atmosphere. The Spanish engineer Sixto Ocampo, in 1951, claimed that the craters were the result of an atomic war between two races of Moon men (the fact that some craters have central peaks while others have not proves, of course, that the two sides used different types of bombs; the last detonations on the Moon fired the lunar seas, which fell back to Earth and caused the Biblical Flood). However, in modern times the only serious question has been as to whether the craters were produced by internal action – that is to say, vulcanism – or whether they were due to impact. By now almost all authorities support the impact theory, which was proposed by Franz von Paula Gruithuisen in 1824, revived by G. K. Gilbert in 1892 and put into its present-day form by Ralph Baldwin in 1949. According to this scenario, the sequence of events may have been more of less as follows (Table 3.7). The Moon was formed at about the same time as the Earth (4600 million years ago). The heat generated during the formation made the outer layers molten down to a depth of several hundred kilometres; less dense materials then separated out to the surface and in the course of time produced a crust. Then, between 4400 million and about 4000 million years ago, came the Great Bombardment, when meteorites rained down to produce the oldest basins such as the Mare Tranquillitatis and the Mare Fœcunditatis. The Imbrium basin dates back perhaps 3850 million years, andastheGreatBombardmentceasedtherewaswidespread vulcanism, with magma pouring out from below the crust and flooding the basins to produce structures such as the Mare Orientale and ringed formations of the Schr ̈ odinger type. Craters with dark floors, such as Plato, were also flooded at this time. The lava flows ended rather suddenly, by cosmical standards, and for the last few thousand million years the Moon has seen little activity, apart from the formation of occasional impact craters such as Copernicus and Tycho. It has been claimed that Copernicus is no more than at thousand million years old, and Tycho even younger. The ray systems are certainly latecomers, since the rays cross all other formations. The Moon has experienced synchronous rotation since early times, and there are marked differences between the Earth-turned and the averted hemispheres. The crust is thicker on the far side and some of the basins are unflooded, which is why they are not classed as maria (palimpsests). The prominent feature Tsiolkovskii seems to be between a mare-type structure and a crater; it has a flooded, mare-type THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 35"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"T HE M OON floor, but high walls and a central peak. It adjoins a formation of similar size, Fermi, which is unflooded. One thing is certain; the Moon is today essentially inert. On 4 May 1783, and again on 19 and 20 April 1787, Sir William Herschel reported seeing active volcanoes, but there is no doubt that he observed nothing more significant than bright areas (such as Aristarchus) shining by earthlight. In modern times, transient lunar phenomena (TLP) have been reported on many occasions; they take the form of localized obscurations and glows. On 3 November 1958, N. A. Kozyrev, at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory, obtained a spectrum of an event inside the crater Alphonsus, and on 30 October 1963 a red event in the Aristarchus area was recorded from the Lowell Observatory by J. Greenacre and J. Barr. In 1967 NASA published a comprehensive catalogue of the many TLP reports, compiled by Barbara Middlehurst and Patrick Moore; Moore issued a subsequent supplement. Over 700 TLP events were listed and although no doubt many of these are due to observational error it seems that others are genuine, presumably due to gaseous emissions from below the crust. They occur mainly round the peripheries of the regular maria and in areas rich in rills, and are commonest near lunar perigee, when the Moon’s crust is under maximum strain. Until recently the reality of TLP was questioned, perhaps because so many of the reports (though by no means all) came from amateur observers. However, full professionalconfirmationhasnowbeenobtained. Usingthe 83-cm telescope at the Observatory of Meudon, Audouin Dollfus has detected activity in the large crater Langrenus. He wrote: ‘Illuminations have been photographed on the surface of the Moon. They appeared unexpectedly on the floor of Langrenus. Their shape and brightness was considerably modified in the following days, and they were simultaneously recorded in polarized light. They are apparently due to dust grain levitation above the lunar surface, under the effect of degassing from the interior ... The Langrenus observations indicate that the Moon is not a completely dead body. Degassing occasionally occurs in areas particularly fractured or fissured. Clouds of dust are lifted off the ground by the gas pressure.’ The brilliant crater Aristarchus has long been known to be particularly subject to TLP phenomena, and images from the Clementine space-craft in the 1990s have shown that there have been recent colour changes in the area; patches of ground have darkened and reddened. Winifred Cameron of the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, who has made a long study of TLP, considers that these changes are due to gaseous outbreaks stirring up the ground material, and it is indeed difficult to think of any other explanation. By terrestrial standards the lunar outbreaks are of course very mild indeed, but there is no longer any serious doubt that they do occur. The most recent claim concerning the formation of a large impact crater related to a report dating from 18 July 1178, by Gervase of Canterbury. The crescent Moon was seen ‘to split in two ... a flaming torch sprung up, spewing out over a considerable distance fire, hot coals and sparks. Meanwhile, the body of the Moon which was below, writhed ... and throbbed like a wounded snake’. This indicates a terrestrial cloud phenomenon, if anything; nevertheless, it has been seriously suggested that the phenomenon was the result of an impact on the far side whichledtotheformationoftheray-craterGiordanoBruno. In fact this is absurd, and in any case the altitude of the Moon at the time of the observation, as seen from Canterbury, was less than 5 ◦ . Therefore there is no doubt that the claim must be dismissed as merely a ‘Canterbury tale’. Major structural changes do not now occur. There have been two cases which have caused widespread discussion, but neither stands up to close examination. In the Mare Fœcunditatis there are two small craters, Messier and Messier A, which were said by Beer and M ̈ adler, in 1837, to be exactly alike, with a curious comet-like ray extending from them to the west; in fact A is the larger of the two and is differently-shaped, but changes in solar illumination mean that they can often appear identical. In 1866 J. Schmidt, from Athens Observatory, reported that a small, deep crater on the Mare Serenitatis, Linn ́ e, had been transformed into a white patch; many contemporary astronomers, including Sir John Herschel, believed that a moonquake had caused the crater walls to collapse. Today Linn ́ e is a small impact crater standing on a white nimbus, and there seems no possibility of any real change having occurred – particularly as M ̈ adler observed it in the 1830s and again after 1866, and reported that it looked exactly the same as it had always done. 36 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"T HE M OON Presumably there is a certain amount of exfoliation, because the temperature range is very great. Surface temperatures were first measured with reasonable accuracy by the fourth Earl of Rosse, from Birr Castle in Ireland. His papers, from 1869, indicated that near noon the temperature rose to about 100 ◦ C, although Langley later erroneously concluded that the temperature never rose above 0 ◦ .Itis now known that the noon equatorial temperature is about 101 ◦ C, falling to − 184 ◦ C at night; the poles remain fairly constant at − 96 ◦ C. It is widely believed that some meteorites found on Earth have come from the Moon. Over a dozen ‘lunar meteorites’ have been listed; two were found in Libya and the rest in Antarctica. For example, there are the two stones, MAC 88104 and 88105, found in the MacAlpine Hills region of Antarctica in 1990. The combined mass is 724 g; the stones are breccias (fused collections of rock fragments). It has been estimated that they were blasted away from the Moon by a huge impact and took about 100 000 years to reach the Earth, and have been awaiting discovery for at least 30 000 years. Most of the ‘lunar meteorites’ are breccias, though a few are different, such as Yamato 793169 (6.1 g) which appears to be of the same type as mare basalts. The evidence in favour of a lunar origin for these meteorites is not conclusive, but it is certainly strong. M ISSIONS T O T HE M OON The idea of reaching the Moon is very old; as long ago as the second century AD a Greek satirist, Lucian of Samosata, wrote a story about a lunar voyage (his travellers were propelled on to the Moon by the force of a powerful waterspout!) ThefirstseriousideawasduetoJulesVerne, in his novel From the Earth to the Moon (1865); he planned to use a space-gun, but neglected the effects of friction against the atmosphere, quite apart from the shock of starting at a speed great enough to break free from Earth (escape velocity: 11.2 km s − 1 ). Before the end of the ninth century the Russian theoretical rocket pioneer, K. E. Tsiolkovskii, realized that the only way to achieve space travel is by using the power of the rocket. The Space Age began on 4 October 1957, with the launch of Russia’s first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1. Less than a year later the Americans made their first attempt to send a rocket vehicle to the Moon. It failed, as did others in the succeeding months, and the Russians took the lead; on 4 January 1959 their probe Luna 1 flew past the Moon at less than 6000 km and sent back useful information (such as the fact that the Moon has no detectable overall magnetic field). The first lander, again Russian (Luna 2), came down on the Moon on 13 September 1959, and in the following month the Soviet scientists achieved a notable triumph by sending Luna 3 round the Moon, obtaining the first pictures of the areas which are always turned away from Earth. In the period from 1961 to 1965 the Americans launched their Ranger probes, which impacted the Moon and sent back valuable data before crash-landing. These were followed by the Surveyors (1966–1968), which made controlledlandingsandsentbackagreatdealofinformation as well as images. However, the first controlled landing was made by Russia’s Luna 9, on 31 January 1966, which came down in the Oceanus Procellarum, and finally disposed of a curious theory according to which the maria, at least, would be covered by a deep layer of soft, treacherous dust. Both the USA and the USSR were making efforts to achieve manned lunar landings. The Russian plans had to be abandoned when it became painfully obvious that their rockets were not sufficiently reliable, but the American Apolloprogrammewentahead, andculminatedinJuly1969 when Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin stepped out on to the bleak rocks of the Mare Tranquillitatis. By the end of the Apollo programme, in December 1972, our knowledge of the Moon had been increased beyond all recognition. Meanwhile the Russians had used unmanned sample-and- returnprobesandhadalsodispatchedtwomovablevehicles, the Lunokhods, which could crawl around the lunar surface under guidance from their controllers on Earth. There followed a long hiatus in the programme of lunar exploration, but new probes were sent to the Moon during the 1990s, including one Japanese vehicle (Hagomoro, carrying the small satellite Hiten). The American Clementine (1994) and Prospector (1998) provided maps of the entire surface which were superior to any previously obtained as well as making some surprising claims; such as the possibility of locating ice inside the deep polar craters whose floors are always in shadow.

THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 41"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"T HE M OON S TRUCTURE O F T HE M OON The results from the Apollo missions and the various unmanned probes have led to a change in many of our ideas about the Moon. Moreover, one professional geologist has been there – Dr Harrison (‘Jack’) Schmitt, with Apollo 17 – and his expertise was naturally invaluable. The upper surface is termed the regolith. This is a loose layer or d ́ ebris blanket, continually churned by the impacts of micrometeorites. (It is often referred to as ‘soil’, but this is misleading, because there is nothing organic about it.) It is made up chiefly of very small particles (‘dust’), but with larger rocks, a few metres across, here and there; it contains many different ingredients. In the maria it is around 2–8 m deep, but it is thicker over the highlands, and may in places go down to 10 m or even more. The highland crust averages 61 km in depth, but ranges from an average of 55 km on the near or Earth-turned side of the Moon to up to 67 km on the far side. The maria are of course volcanic; they cover 17% of the surface, mainly on the near side (they are much less common on the far side, because of the greater thickness of the crust), and they are in general no more than 1–2 km deep, except near the centres of the large basins. At a fairly shallow level there are areas of denser material, which have been located because an orbiting space-craft will speed up when affected by them; these are known as mascons ( mas s con centrations). They lie under the large basins, such as Imbrium and Orientale. On the highlands, the rock fragments are chiefly anorthosites, with minerals such as plagioclase, pyroxene and ilmenite. Details of these materials are given in Table 3.9. Much of our knowledge about the lunar interior comes from seismic investigations – in fact, moonquakes – just as we depend upon earthquakes for information about the interior of our own world. Of course, moonquakes are very mild by terrestrial standards, and never exceed a value of 3 on the Richter scale, and they are of two main types. Most originate from a zone 800–1000 km below the surface, and are common enough; there is a definite correlation between moonquake frequency and lunar perigee. Shallow moonquakes, at depths of 50– 200 km, also occur, although they are much less frequent. It is worth noting that the epicentres of moonquakes seem Table 3.9. Materials in the lunar crust. Pyroxene , a Ca–Mg–Fe silicate, is the most common mineral in lunar lavas, making up about half of most specimens; it forms yellowish–brown crystals up to a few centimetres in size. Plagioclase or feldspar, a Na– or Ca–Al silicate, forms elongated white crystals. Anorthosite is a rock type containing the minerals plagioclase, pyroxene and/or olivine in various proportions. Basalt is a rock type containing the minerals plagioclase, pyroxene and ilmenite in varying proportions. Olivine , a Mg–Fe silicate, is made up of pale green crystals a few millimetres in size; it is not uncommon in the anorthosites. Ilmenite , present in the basalts, is an Fe–Ti oxide. to be linked with areas particularly subject to TLP – mainly although not entirely around the peripheries of the regular maria. There have also been man-made moonquakes, caused by the impacts of discarded lunar modules. These show that the outer few kilometres of the Moon are made up of cracked and shattered rock, so that signals can echo to and fro; it was even said that after the impact of an Apollo module the Moon ‘rang like a bell’! Below the crust comes the mantle, the structure of which seems to be relatively uniform. A 1 ton meteorite which hit the Moon in July 1972 indicated, from its seismic effects, that there is a region 1000–1200 km below the surface where the rocks are hot enough to be molten (Apollo measurements disposed of an earlier theory that the Moon’s globe could be cold and solid all the way through). Finally, there may be a metallic core, although its existence has not been definitely proved, and it cannot be much more than 1000 km in diameter. Results from the Lunar Prospector mission of 1998/9 have led to an estimate of an iron-rich core between 440 and 900 km in diameter. Certainly the Moon’s core is much smaller than that of the Earth, both relatively and absolutely. It is significant that there is no overall magnetic field now, although the remnant magnetism of some rocks indicates that between 3.6 and 3.9 thousand million years a definite field existed – which was not evident either before or 42 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"T HE M OON after that period. There are however locally magnetized areas, notably the curious Reiner Gamma, a ‘swirl’ in the near side, and the crater Van de Graaff, on the far side. All the rocks brought home for analysis are igneous, or brecciasproducedbyimpactprocesses; theApollomissions recovered 2196 samples, with a total weight of 381.69 kg, now divided into 35 600 samples. The youngest basalt (No 12022) was given an age of 3.08 thousand million years, while the oldest (No 10003) dated back 3.85 thousand million years. There were no sedimentary or metamorphic rocks. The famous ‘orange soil’, found by the Apollo 17 astronauts and at first thought to indicate recent vulcanism, proved to be small glassy orange beads, sprayed out some 3.7 thousand million years ago in erupting fountains of basaltic magmas. In the lavas, basalts are dominant. They contain more titanium than terrestrial lavas; over 10% in the Apollo 11 samples, for example, as against 1–3% in terrestrial basalts. Small amounts of metallic iron were found. Many lunar rocks have much less sodium and potassium than do terrestrial rocks. A new mineral – an opaque oxide of iron, titanium and magnesium, not unlike ilmenite – has been named armalcolite, in honour of Arm strong, Al drin and Col lins. There is also a different type of basalt, KREEP; this name comes from the fact that it is rich in potassium (chemical symbol K), rare earth elements and phosphorus. The average age of the highland rocks is from 4 to 4.2 thousand million years; in fact over 99% of the surface dates back for over 3 thousand million years and 90% goes back for more than 4 thousand million years. One interesting anorthosite rock, 4 thousand million years old, was collected by the Apollo 15 astronauts; it is white and was at once nicknamed the Genesis Rock. The Apollo 12 sample 12013 (collected by Conrad from the Oceanus Procellarum) is unique. It is about the size of a lemon, and contains 61% of SiO 2 , whereas the associated lavas have only 35–40% of SiO 2 . It also contains 40 times as much potassium, uranium and thorium, making it one of the most radioactive rocks found anywhere on the Moon. It is composed of a dark grey breccia, a light grey breccia and a vein of solidified lava. Unexpected results came from one of the most recent lunar probes, Clementine, named after the character in the old mining song who was ‘lost and gone forever’. Although Clementine was among the cheapest of all probes (it cost $55 000 000) it was remarkably successful insofar as the Moon is concerned. It was a joint NASA–USAF venture, and was launched not from Canaveral, but from the Vandenberg Air Force Base, on 23 January 1995. On 21 February it entered lunar orbit and continued mapping until 23 April; by the time it left lunar orbit, on 4 May, the whole of the surface had been mapped. Unfortunately a fault developed, making it impossible to go on to an encounter with an asteroid (Geographos) as had been hoped. The last lunar flyby was on 20 July, the 25th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, after which Clementine entered a solar orbit. The minimum distance from the Moon had been 425 km. Surprisingly, some investigators claimed that the neutron spectrometer on Clementine had been used to detect ice in some of the deep polar craters, whose floors are always in shadow and where the temperature is always very low. This seemed to be inherently unlikely, since none of the materials brought home by the astronauts had shown any sign of hydrated substances, and in any case it was not easy to see how the ice could have got there. It could hardly have been deposited by an impacting comet, because the temperature at the time of the collision would have been too high; and there is no evidence of past water activity, as there is for instance upon Mars. Yet it was even suggested that there might be enough ice to provide a useful water supply for future colonists; a thousand million gallons of water was one estimate. Then came Prospector, launched on 6 January 1998, and put into a stable orbit which took it round the Moon once in every 118 min at a distance of 96 km from the surface. Prospector was designed not only to continue with the mapping programme, but also to make a deliberate search for ice deposits – and before long the results seemed to confirm those of Clementine. Yet it was not claimed that ice, as such, had been detected. All that had been found were apparent indications of hydrogen, which could be interpreted in several different ways. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 43"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"T HE M OON Prospector, like Clementine, carried a neutron spectrometer. Neutrons are ejected when cosmic rays from space strike atoms in the Moon’s crust, and these neutrons can be detected from the space-craft. Collisions between cosmic-ray particles and heavy atoms produce ‘fast’ neutrons; if hydrogen atoms are hit, the ‘slow’ neutrons are much less energetic and the spectrometers can distinguish between the two types. It was found that the neutron energy coming from the polar regions was reduced and from this the presence of hydrogen was inferred, which in turn could suggest the presence of water ice. On the other hand, the hydrogen could be due to the solar wind, which bombards the lunar surface all the time. Efforts were made to confirm the presence of ice by using the large radio telescope at Arecibo in Puerto Rico. Radar studies did indeed give the same indications – but these were also found in regions which are not in permanent shadow and where frozen material could not possibly exist, so that very rough ground might well be responsible. From the outset there were many sceptics about the ‘ice’ idea. I had no faith in it; how could the ice have arrived there? All the samples brought home so far are completely lacking in hydrated materials. A major sceptic was Harrison Schmitt, the only professional geologist who has been to the Moon. Finally, on 31 July 1999, a test was made. At the end of its active career Prospector was deliberately crashed on to the Moon, landing inside a polar crater where ice, if it existed at all, would be present. It was hoped that the cloud of material thrown up would show traces of water. In fact the results were completely negative. No traces of water were found, and all in all it seems that the whole idea of ice inside polar craters must be abandoned. A TMOSPHERE The Moon’s low escape velocity means that it cannot be expected to retain much in the way of atmosphere. Initially it was believed that the atmosphere must be dense; this was the view of Schr ̈ oter (1796) and also Sir William Herschel, whobelievedthathabitabilityoftheMoontobe‘anabsolute certainty’. W. H. Pickering (1924) believed the atmosphere to be dense enough to support insects or even small animals, but in 1949 B. Lyot searched for lunar twilight effects and concluded that the atmosphere must have a density less than 1/10 000 of that of the Earth at sea-level. In what was then the USSR, V. Fesenkov and Y. N. Lipski made similar investigations and came to the final conclusion that the density was indeed in the region 1 / 10 000 that of our air. The first reliable results came from the Apollo missions. The orbiting sections of Apollos 15 and 16 traced small quantities of radon and polonium seeping out from below the surface, and this was no surprise, because these gases are produced by the radioactive decay of uranium, which is not lacking in the lunar rocks. LACE, the Lunar Atmospheric Composition Experiment, taken to the Moon by Apollo 17, did detect an excessively tenuous atmosphere, mainlyhelium(duetothesolarwind)andargon(seepingout from below the crust). Later D. Potter and T. Morgan, at the McDonald Observatory in Texas, identified two more gases, sodium and potassium. Traces of silicon, aluminium and oxygen have also been detected in the excessively tenuous upperatmosphere. ThesodiumseemstosurroundtheMoon rather in the manner of a cometary corona. The lunar atmosphere seems to be in the nature of a collisionless gas; the total weight of the lunar atmosphere can be no more than about 30 tons. The density is of the order of 10 − 14 that of the Earth’s atmosphere. E CLIPSES O F T HE M OON EclipsesoftheMoonarecausedbytheMoon’sentryintothe cone of shadow cast by the Earth. At the mean distance of the Moon, the diameter of the shadow cone is approximately 9170 km; on average the shadow is 1367 650 km long. Totality may last for up t o1h44 min. Lunar eclipses may be either total or partial. If the Moon misses the main cone and merely enters the zone of ‘partial shadow’ or penumbra to either side, there is slight dimming, but a penumbral eclipse is not easy to detect with the naked eye. Of course, the Moon must pass through the penumbra before entering the main cone or umbra (Table 3.10). During an eclipse the Moon becomes dim, often coppery.

On the other hand, it is reliably reported that during the eclipses of 18 May 1761 and 10 June 1816 the Moon became completely invisible with the naked eye. The French astronomer A. Danjon has given an ‘eclipse scale’ from 0 (dark) to 4 (bright), and has attempted to correlate this with solar activity, although the evidence is far from conclusive. The Danjon scale is given in Table 3.11. The Greek astronomer Anaxagoras (c 500–428 BC) gave a correct explanation of lunar eclipses, but in early times eclipses caused considerable alarm. For example, the Californian Indians believed that a monster was attacking the Moon, and had to be driven away by making as much noise as possible (as with the Chinese at the time of a solar eclipse), while in an old Scandinavian poem, the Edda , it is said that the monster Managarmer is trying to swallow the Moon, and staining the air and ground with blood. During an eclipse the Orinoco Indians would take their hoes and labour energetically in their cornfields, as they felt that the Moon was showing anger at their laziness. Ancient eclipse records are naturally uncertain. It has been claimed that an eclipse seen in the Middle East can be dated back to 3450 BC; the eclipse of 1361 BC is more definite. Ptolemy gives the dates of observed eclipses as 721 BC and 720 BC. In The Clouds , the Greek playwright Aristophanes alludes to an eclipse seen from Athens on 9 October 425 BC. There was certainly a lunar eclipse in August 413 BC, which had unfortunate results for Athens, since is persuaded Nicias, the commander of the Athenian expedition to Sicily, to delay the evacuation of his army; the astrologers advised him to stay where he was ‘for thrice nine days’. When he eventually tried to embark his forces, he found that he had been blockaded by the Spartans. His fleet was destroyed and the expedition annihilate d–arev erse which led directly to the final defeat ofAthensinthePeloponnesianWar. AccordingtoPolybius, an eclipse in September 218 BC so alarmed the Gaulish mercenaries in the service of Attalus I of Pergamos that they refused to continue a military advance. On the other hand, Christopher Columbus turned the eclipse of 1504 AD to his advantage. He was anchored off Jamaica and the local inhabitants refused to supply his men with food; he threatened to extinguish the Moon, and when the eclipse took place the natives were so alarmed that there was no further trouble. Obviously, a lunar eclipse can happen only at full moon. In the original edition of the famous novel King Solomon’s Mines , H. Rider Haggard described a full moon, a solar eclipse and another full moon on successive days. When the mistake was pointed out he altered the second edition, turning the solar eclipse into a lunar one! O CCULTATIONS Occultations of stars by the Moon is common, and were formerly of great value for positional purposes. When a star is occulted, it shines steadily up to the instant of immersion; the lunar atmosphere is far too rarefied to have an effect. A planet will take some time to disappear. W. H. Pickering maintained that the lunar atmosphere could produce effects during an occultation of Jupiter, but this has long since been discounted. On 23 April 1998 four Brazilian observers, led by E. Karkoschka, witnessed an exceptional event. Using a 10 cm refractor, they saw Venus and Jupiter occulted simultaneously; the site was 100 km N of Recife. The last occultation when Venus and Jupiter were occulted at the same time was 567 AD. 46 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"T HE M OON Table 3.12.

It was once thought that a still closer-in planet existed and it was even given a name: Vulcan. It would be wellnigh impossible to observe except during a total solar eclipse or a transit across the Sun’s disk, but various claims were made, notably by a French amateur, Lescarbault, who stated that he had observed a transit on 26 March 1859. One believer was U. J. J. Le Verrier, whose mathematical work had led to the identification of Neptune in 1846. Vulcan’s distance from the Sun was said to be about 21 000 000 km, with a period of 19d 17h. However, it is now certain that Vulcan does not exist. The only bodies which may move within the orbit of Mercury are comets, plus some asteroids such as Phæthon. Data for Mercury are given in Table 4.1. M OVEMENTS The planet must have been known in prehistoric times, even if its nature were not realized. The oldest observation which has come down to us is dated 15 November 265 BC, when the planet was one lunar diameter away from a line joining the stars Delta and Beta Scorpii. This information was given by the last great astronomer of Classical times, Ptolemy (c 120–180 AD). Plato ( Republic , X 14) commented upon the yellowish colour of Mercury, although most naked-eye observers will describe it as white. Mercury can actually become brighter than any star, but can never be seen against a really dark sky. There is an oft-quoted story that the great astronomer Copernicus never saw Mercury at all, because of mists aris- ing from the River Vistula, near his home, but the story is certainly false. Mercury is by no means hard to identify when well placed, and the skies were much less polluted in Copernicus’ time than they are now (he died in 1543). The maximum angular elongation from the Sun is 28 ◦ . Elonga- tion dates for the period 2000–2015 are given in Table 4.2. The phases of Mercury are easy to see with a small telescope. They were probably suspected in the Table 4.1. Data. Distance from the Sun: mean 57.9 million km (0.387 a.u.) max 69.7 million km (0.467 a.u.) min 45.9 million km (0.306 a.u.)

Transit dates between 1631 and 2100 are given in Table 4.3. Transits can occur only in May and November. May transits occur with Mercury near aphelion; at November transits Mercury is near perihelion, and November transits are the more frequent in the ratio of seven to three. The longest transits (those of May) may last for almost 9 h. During a transit, Mercury appears much blacker than any sunspot. The Mercurian atmosphere is too tenuous to produce any observable effects, as happens with Venus. Table 4.3. Transits of Mercury.

The transit of 15 November 1999 was exceptional. It was a ‘grazing transit’; Mercury followed a short chord across the Sun’s NE limb. In fact, over some parts of the Earth there was only a partial transit, as Mercury did not pass wholly on to the solar disk. The transit was total from Papua New Guinea, NE Australia, Hawaii, western South America and most of North America; partial from Antarctica and most of Australia. In New Zealand, the transit was total from North Island but partial from South Island. This situation will not recur for several centuries. Occasionally Mercury may occult another planet; this last happened on 9 December 1808, when Mercury passed in front of Saturn. The next occasion will be on 11 August 2079, when Mercury will occult Mars. Close planetary conjunctions involving Mercury are given in Table 4.4, for the period 1900–2100; all these occur more than 10 ◦ from the Sun, and the separations are below 60 arcsec. M APS O F M ERCURY Mercury is a difficult object to study from Earth (and, incidentally, it cannot be studied at all with the Hubble Space Telescope, because it is too close to the Sun in the sky). The first serious telescopic observations were made in the late 18th century by Sir William Herschel, who, however, could make out no surface detail. At about the same time observations were made by J. H. Schr ̈ oter, who recorded some surface patches and who believed that he had detected high mountains. It seems certain that these results were illusory. The first attempt to produce a proper map was made by G. V. Schiaparelli, from Milan, using 21.8 cm and 49 cm refractors between 1881 and 1889. His method was to study the planet in daylight, when both it and the Sun were high above the horizon. Schiaparelli recorded various dark markings, and concluded that the rotation period must be synchronous – that is to say, equal to Mercury’s orbital period. This would mean that part of the planet would be in permanent sunlight and another part in permanent darkness, with an intervening ‘twilight zone’ over which the Sun would rise and set, always keeping fairly close to the horizon. Percival Lowell, at the Flagstaff Observatory in Arizona, drew a map in 1896 showing ‘canal-like’ linear features, but these were completely non-existent. The best pre-Space Age map was drawn by E. M. Antoniadi, using the 83 cm refractor at Meudon, near Paris; like Schiaparelli, he observed in daylight. The map was published in 1934, together with a book dealing with all aspects of the planet 1 . He agreed with Schiaparelli that the rotation period must be synchronous, and he also believed the atmosphere to be dense enough to support obscurations. Both these conclusions are now known to be wrong. Antoniadi’s map showed various dark and bright features, and to these he gave names; there was a degree of agreement with Schiaparelli’s map, although there were very marked differences. Antoniadi’s names are given in Table 4.5. Yet they referred only to albedo features, and the map is not accurate enough for the names to be retained – which was not Antoniadi’s fault; he was certainly the best planetary observer of his time. The modern map is based entirely upon the results from Mariner 10, the only space-craft to have flown past Mercury. Mariner 10 was launched from Cape Canaveral on 3 November 1973. It by-passed Venus on 5 February 1974, at a range of 4200 km, after which it went on to encounter Mercury, making three active passes: on 29 March 1974 (at 705 km from the surface), 21 September 1 Surprisingly, the book was not translated into English until 1974, when I did so – by which time its interest was mainly historical. Although Antoniadi was Greek, he spent much of his life in France and wrote his book in French. 76 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"M ERCURY Table 4.5.

By that time the equipment was deteriorating, and contact was finally lost on 24 March 1975. No doubt the probe is still in solar orbit, and still making periodical approaches to Mercury, but we have no hope of locating it again. Unfortunately the same areas of the planet were in sunlight at all three active passes, and so we have good maps of less than half the total surface, although there is no reason to expect that the remaining areas will be basically different from those available to Mariner. Mercury has proved to be a world of craters, moun- tains, low plains (planitiæ), scarps (rupes), dorsa (ridges) and valleys. The craters are named after famous artists, musicians, painters and authors; planitiæ after the names for Mercury in different languages; rupes after ships of discovery or scientific expeditions, and valleys after radio telescopes. Only three astronomers are commemorated on Mercury; Antoniadi and Schiaparelli, and also G. P. Kuiper, who was closely concerned with planetary space research. A selected list of named features on Mercury is given in Table 4.7. A TMOSPHERE As might be expected from its low escape velocity, Mercury has only an excessively tenuous atmosphere; its total weight is probably no more than about 8 tons. It was first positivelydetectedbytheinstrumentsonMariner10(earlier spectroscopicreportsofanatmosphere, initiallybyH.Vogel in 1871, were erroneous). Its density is so low that it may be regarded as an exosphere. The ground density is of the order of 10 − 10 mbar. The main constituents are sodium, oxygen, helium, potassium and some argon. Hydrogen and helium may well originate from the solar wind, while sodium, potassium and oxygen are probably gases released by the vaporization of the surface material (the regolith) by the impact of micrometeorites. But there is no chance that the atmosphere is dense enough to support ‘clouds’ of any type, as Antoniadi believed – and it is very clear that life of any kind on Mercury is out of the question. I NTERIOR A ND M AGNETIC F IELD Rather surprisingly, Mercury does have a definite magnetic field, first identified by Mariner 10. The encounter yielded a value of 350 gammas (0.3 G) at the surface, or about 1% of the Earth’s magnetic field. This means that the magnetic field of Mercury is stronger than those of Venus, Mars or the Moon. The field is dipolar, with two equal magnetic poles of opposite polarity, inclined by 11 ◦ to the rotational THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 77"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"M ERCURY axis of the planet. The polarity is the same as that of the Earth’s field (i.e. a compass needle would point north). The magnetic field is just sufficient to deflect the solar wind away from the planet’s surface, and a magnetosphere is de- tectable, with a bow shock at 1.5 Mercurian radii from the centre of the globe. This indicates the presence of an iron-rich core, which may well be molten. The overall density of Mercury is greater than that of any other planet apart from the Earth, and the core is likely to be about 3600 km in diameter – larger than the whole globe of the Moon. Overlying the core are a solid mantle and crust of silicates with a combined thickness of around 600 km; the surface is covered with a layer of porous silicate ‘dust’ forming the top of a regolith, which goes down to a few metres or a few tens of metres. Compared with that of the Moon, the crust itself may be rather deficient in iron and titanium-bearing minerals, which block or absorb microwaves. There have beensuggestionsthatintheearlyhistoryoftheSolarSystem Mercury was struck by a large body and had its outer layers ripped off, leaving behind the heavy iron-rich core. This sounds plausible, but of course there is no proof. By weight, Mercury is 70% iron and only 30% rocky material, so that is contains twice as much iron per unit volume as any other planet or satellite. A XIAL R OTATION For many years the synchronous rotation period, favoured by Schiaparelli and Antoniadi, was generally accepted, but in 1962 W. E. Howard and his colleagues at Michigan measured the long-wavelength radiations from Mercury, and found that the dark side was much warmer than it would be if it never received any sunlight. In 1965 the non-synchronous period was confirmed by radar methods, largely by R. Dyce and G. Pettengill, using the large radio telescope at Arecibo in Puerto Rico. The true period is 58.6 days, which is two-thirds of the orbital period, and when Mercury is best placed for observation from Earth it is always the same area which is presented. There is no area of permanent daylight, no region of permanent night and no twilight zone, but the Mercurian calendar is decidedly peculiar. The axial inclination is negligible, so that Mercury spins in an almost ‘upright’ sense relating to its orbital plane. When Mercury is near perihelion, the orbital angular velocity exceeds the constant spin angular velocity, so that an observer on Mercury would see the Sun slowly move in a retrograde direction for eight Earth days around each perihelion passage. The Sun would then almost hover over what may be called a ‘hot pole’, one of which is the site of the largest basin found on the planet – aptly named the Caloris Basin. It is interesting to follow the course of a Mercurian ‘day’. To an observer at a hot pole, the Sun will be at the zenith at the time of perihelion, so that its apparent diameter will be at its greatest. As it nears the zenith it will stop and move retrograde for eight Earth days before resuming its original direction of motion. As it drops toward the horizon it will shrink, finally setting 88 Earth days after having risen – not to be seen again for another 88 Earth days. But to an observer 90 ◦ away, the Sun will be at its largest when rising, as Mercury will then be at perihelion; sunrise will be protracted, because the Sun will appear, almost vanish again and finally climb toward the zenith, when it will be at its minimum apparent size. It will swell as it drops in the sky; it will set, rise again briefly and then depart. The interval between one sunrise and the next is 176 Earth days. No doubt Mercury once rotated much faster than it does now; it has been ‘braked’ by the gravitational pull of the Sun, and it has been suggested that it had reached its present slow rotation rate as early as 500 million years after its formation. The temperature at the hot pole reaches 427 ◦ Cat maximum, but the night temperature drops to − 183 ◦ C. The temperature range is greater than for any other planet in the Solar System. Near the poles there are some craters whose floors are always in shadow, and which remain bitterly cold; in 1991 radar measurements made with the VLA (Very Large Array) in New Mexico led to the suggestion that ice might exist in these craters. Results from Arecibo, and from Mariner 10, were later quoted in support. However, the evidence is at best very suspect – as in the case of the Moon – and the existence of ice on a world such as Mercury would be very surprising indeed. Moreover, the same radar results have been found in areas on Mercury which do receive sunlight, and where ice could not possibly survive. 78 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"M ERCURY Table 4.6.

Age (thousands of Name millions of years) Features Lunar counterparts Pre-Tolstoyan 4 Intercrater plains, multi-ring basins Pre-Nectarian Tolstoyan Plains materials, smaller basins, craters Nectarian Calorian Basins, plains materials, craters Imbrian Mansurian Craters Eratosthenian Kuiperian 1 Craters, ray-systems Copernican S URFACE F EATURES Craters are widespread in Mercury, and some of them are ray-centres; indeed, the first crater to be identified during theapproachofMariner10wasaray-centre, andwasnamed Kuiper, in honour of the Dutch astronomer Gerard Kuiper (1905–1973). The south pole of Mercury is marked by the crater Chao Meng-Fu. It has been agreed that the 20th- degree meridian passes through the centre of the 1.5 km crater Hun Kal, 0 ◦ 58 \u0002 south of the Mercurian equator (the name stands for 20 in the language of the Maya, who used a base-20 number system). Craters less than 20 km in diameter are bowl-shaped, with depths of about one-fifth of their diameters; craters between 20 and 90 km across have flatter floors, often with central peaks and terraced walls. The general distribution of the craters is of the lunar type, so that if one crater breaks into another it is almost always the smaller formation which is the intruder. The most imposing feature on Mercury is the Caloris Basin (Caloris Planitia), at one of the two ‘hot poles’. It is 1300 km in diameter, and is bounded by a ring of smooth mountain blocks rising 1–2 km above the surrounding surface; a second, weaker scarp lies 100–160 km beyond the main one. Unfortunately only half of Caloris was within range of Mariner 10. Antipodal to it is an area which is officially termed ‘hilly and lineated terrain’, although often called ‘weird terrain’. It covers 360 000 km 2 , and consists of hills, depressions and valleys which have destroyed older features. Some of the hills rise to 2 km. It may well be that the formation of this terrain has been due to the vast impact which produced Caloris. There is an obvious resemblance between the surface of Mercury and that of the Moon, but there are important dif- ferences in detail. In particular, about 45% of the Mercurian surface mapped from Mariner 10 is occupied by ‘intercrater plains’, which are very old and are unlike anything on the Moon. There are also lobate scarps, cliffs from 20 to over 500 km long and up to 3 km high; they seen to be essentially thrust faults, cutting through other features and displacing older landforms. Again there is no lunar counterpart. It seems probable that they formed in response to a 1–2 km shrinkage in the planet’s diameter early in its history – pre- dicted by thermal models. There was undoubtedly much more general melting on Mercury than there ever was on the smaller Moon, and this accounts for the significant dif- ferences between the two bodies. Moreover, even the most densely-cratered regions of Mercury do not contain as many formations as the most densely-cratered areas of the Moon. Apart from Caloris, the largest circular structure is Beethoven, with a diameter of 643 km. Ray-craters include Kuiper, Copley, Mens, Tansen and Snorri. Obviously we know much less about the past history of Mercury than we do about the Moon. A tentative timescale has been drawn up, and is given in Table 4.6, but it may not be very accurate. Mercury has no satellite. This seems certain. There was however an alarm on 27 March 1974, two days before the Mariner 10 flyby of the planet; one instrument began recording bright emissions in the extreme ultra-violet. They vanished, but then reappeared, and a satellite was suspected. However, it turned out that the object was an ordinary star – 31 Crateris. If Mercury had a satellite of appreciable size, it would almost certainly have been found by now. No doubt more space-craft will be sent to Mercury during the 21st century, but manned landings there seem to be most unlikely. Mercury is a fascinating world, but is not a welcoming one.

However, in all other respects it is quite unlike the Earth. Only during the past 40 years have we been able to find out what Venus is really like; its surface is permanently hidden by its thick, cloudy atmosphere, and before the Space Age Venus was often referred to as ‘the planet of mystery’. Data are given in Table 5.1. Venus is the brightest object in the sky apart from the Sun and the Moon. At its best it can even cast shadows – as was noted by the Greek astronomer Simplicius, in his Commentary on the Heavens of Aristotle , and by the Roman writer Pliny around 60 AD. Venus must have been known since prehistoric times. The most ancient observations which have come down to us are Babylonian, and are recorded on the Venus Tablet found by Sir Henry Layard at Konyunjik, now to be seen in the British Museum. Homer ( Iliad , XXII, 318) refers to Venus as ‘the most beautiful star set in the sky’ and the name is, of course, that of the Goddess of Love and Beauty. (As an interesting aside, Venus was once referred to by Napoleon Bonaparte. According to the French astronomer F. Arago, Napoleon was visiting Luxembourg when he saw that the crowd was paying more attention to the sky than to him; it was noon, but Venus was easily visible and Napoleon saw it. Not surprisingly, his followers referred to it as being the star ‘of the Conqueror of Italy’. In more recent times, Venus has been responsible for innumerable UFO reports – one of them, indeed, from President Carter of the United States!) M OVEMENTS Venus moves round the Sun in a practically circular orbit. Its elongation can be as much as 47 ◦ , so that it can be above the horizon from as much as 5 1 2 hours after sunset or before sunrise; phenomena for the period 2000–2015 are given in Table 5.2.

In 1721, Edmond Halley was the first to note that Venus, unlike Mercury, is at its brightest during the crescent stage, when about 30% of the daylight hemisphere is turned in our direction.

At the superior conjunctions of 11 June 2000 and 9 June 2008 Venus will actually be occulted by the Sun. to the Earth, its dark side faces us, and the planet cannot be seen at all except during the rare occasions of a transit. The observed and theoretical phases do not always agree. This is particularly evident during the time of dichotomy or half-phase. When Venus is waning, in the evening sky, dichotomy is earlier than predicted; when Venus is waxing, in the morning sky, dichotomy is late. The discrepancy may amount to several days, although it is true that timing the exact time of observed dichotomy is not easy. This effect was first noted by J. H. Schr ̈ oter in 1793 – and is now generally referred to as the Schr ̈ oter Effect, a term which I introduced about 40 years ago. It is due to the effects of Venus’ atmosphere. The phases were first observed telescopically by Galileo, in 1610. This was important, because according to the old Ptolemaic theory, with the Earth in the centre of the planetary system, Venus could never show a full cycle of phases. The observation strengthened Galileo’s conviction in the Copernican or Sun-centred system. (The phases had not previously been mentioned specifically, although very keen-sighted people can see the crescent form with the naked eye.) T RANSITS Transits occur in pairs, separated by eight years, after which no more occur for over a century. Dates of past and future transits are given in Table 5.3. Unlike Mercury, Venus is easy so see with the naked eye during transit – but since the last opportunity was in 1882, there can at present (2000) be no living person who can remember one. The first prediction of a transit was made by Kepler, who in 1627 found that a transit was due on 6 December 1631. It was not actually observed, because it happened during night over Europe. The first transit to be observed was that of 1639, 24 November O.S. (4 December N.S.) It was seen by two amateurs, Jeremiah Horrocks and William Crabtree; independent calculations had been made by Horrocks (Kepler had not predicted a transit for 1639). It has been claimed that the Eastern scholar Al-Farabi saw a transit in 910 AD, from Kazakhstan, and this may well be true, but there is no proof, and neither is it clear that Al-Farabi had any idea about the cause – even if he did really seen Venus against the Sun. (It might even have been a large sunspot.) Early in the 18th century, Edmond Halley suggested using transits of the inferior planets to measure the length of the astronomical unit or Earth–Sun distance. Transits of Mercury could not be observed with sufficient accuracy, but those of Venus seemed more promising, and Halley, following up an earlier comment by James Gregory, recommended careful studies of the transits of 1761 and 1769. Unfortunately the method proved to be disappointing and is now obsolete, so that future transits will be regarded as of academic interest only. The trouble was due to an THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 87"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"V ENUS effect termed the Black Drop. As Venus passes on to the solar disk it seems to draw a strip of blackness after it, and when this strip disappears the transit has already begun; again the atmosphere of Venus is responsible. However, the 1769 transit had one other important consequence. Captain Cook was detailed to take the astronomer Charles Green to Tahiti, to observe the transit; the observations were duly made – and Cook then continued upon his voyage of discovery to Australia. O CCULTATIONS Venus can of course be occulted by the Moon, and can itself occult stars and, occasionally, planets. An occultation of Mars by Venus was observed on 3 October 1590 by M. M ̈ ostlin, from Heidelberg, and Mercury was occulted by Venus on 17 May 1737; this was seen by J. Bevis from Greenwich. The last occultation of a planet by Venus was on 3 January 1818, when Venus passed in front of Jupiter. The next occasion will be on 22 November 2065, when Venus will again occult Jupiter, but the elongation from the Sun will be only 8 ◦ W. Close planetary conjunctions involving Venus for the period 2000–2100 are given in Table 5.4. When Venus occults a star, the light from the star dims appreciably as it passes through Venus’ atmosphere before the actual occultation takes place. This was very evident when Regulus was occulted on 7 July 1959, and proved to be very useful in estimating the density of Venus’ atmosphere, which was not then well known. (I was able to make good estimates with a 30 cm reflector at Selsey, in Sussex.) T ELESCOPIC O BSERVATIONS Early telescopic observers were unable to see any genuine details on Venus, but on 9 January 1643 G. Riccioli recorded the Ashen Light, or faint visibility of the night side of Venus. It was formerly dismissed as a mere contrast effect, but it is now believed to be due to electrical phenomena in the planet’s upper atmosphere. Dark markings on the disk were reported by F. Fontana in 1645, but he was using a small-aperture, long-focus refractor, and there is no doubt that his ‘markings’ on Venus were illusory. In 1727 F. Bianchini, from Rome, went so far as to produce a map of the surface, and even gave names to Table 5.3. Transits of Venus, 1631–2200.

Earlier transits occurred in 1032, 1040, 1153, 1275, 1283, 1396, 1518 and 1526. the features he believed that he had recorded – such as ‘the Royal Sea of King John’, ‘the Sea of Prince Constantine’ and ‘the Strait of Vasco da Gama’. Again these markings were illusory; Bianchini’s telescope was of small aperture, and as the focal length was about 20 m it must have been very awkward to use. J. H. Schr ̈ oter, using better telescopes (including one made by William Herschel) observed Venus from 1779, at his observatory at Lilienthal, near Bremen. He recorded markings, which he correctly interpreted as being atmospheric, but also claimed to have seen high mountains protruding above the atmosphere. In fact no Earth-based optical telescope will show surface details; all that can be made out are vague, impermanent, cloudy features. Neither is conventional photography more helpful, but in 1923 F. E. Ross, at Mount Wilson, took good photographs at infra-red and ultra-violet wavelengths. The infra-red pictures showed no detail, but vague features were shown in ultra-violet, indicating high- altitude cloud phenomena. 88 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"V ENUS Table 5.4.

On 17 November 1981 Venus occulted the second-magnitude star Nunki (Sigma Sagittarii). R OTATION P ERIOD Until fairly recent times the axial rotation period of Venus was unknown. Efforts were made to determine it by observing the drifts of surface markings across the disk, as is easy enough with Mars of Jupiter, but fails for Venus because the markings are too ill-defined. The first attempt, by G. D. Cassini in 1666, gave 23h 21m. Many other estimates followed, by visual, photographic and spectroscopic methods, but were no better. In a monograph published in 1962, I listed all the estimates of rotation periods published between 1666 and 1960. There were over 100 of them – and every one turned out to be wrong. In 1890 G. V. Schiaparelli proposed a synchronous rotation period. This would mean that the rotation period and the orbital period would be equal at 224.7 days, and Venus would keep the same hemisphere turned toward the Sun all the time. However, this did not seem to fit the facts, and in 1954 G. P. Kuiper proposed a period of ‘a few weeks’. An estimate of the rotation period found by spectroscopic methods (the Doppler shift) was made by R. S. Richardson, at Mount Wilson, in 1956. He concluded that the rotation was very slow and retrograde – that is to say, opposite in sense to that of the Earth. During the 1950s French observers, using photography, claimed that the upper clouds had a retrograde rotation period of four days. Surprisingly, both these results proved to be correct. Venus was first contacted by radar in 1961, by a team at the Lincoln Laboratory in the United States (an earlier result, in 1958, proved to be erroneous). Several other groups made radar contact with the planet at about the same time, and it became possible to obtain a reliable value for the rotation period. The true period is 243.02 days, retrograde, so that Venus is the only planet to have a rotation period longer than its orbital period. The solar day on Venus is equal THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 89"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"V ENUS to 118 Earth-days, and if it were possible to see the Sun from the surface it would rise in the west and set in the east. (In fact, the Sun could never be seen through the clouds.) However, the upper clouds do indeed rotate in only four days, retrograde, so that the atmospheric structure is very unusual. The reason for this curious state of affairs is not known. It has been suggested that Venus was struck by a large impactor; this does not seem very plausible, but it is difficult to think of anything better. A TMOSPHERE The atmosphere of Venus was first reported by the Russian astronomer, M. V. Lomonosov, during the transit of 1761; he saw that the outline of the planet was hazy rather than clear-cut, and correctly interpreted this as being due to a dense atmosphere. Subsequently the existence of a substantial atmosphere was not seriously questioned except by Percival Lowell, at Flagstaff, who in 1897 published a map showing linear features radiating from a dark central patch which he named ‘Eros’. These features were, however, illusory. In 1923–28 E. Pettit and S. B. Nicholson, using a thermocouple attached to the 2.5 m (100 inch) Hooker reflector at Mount Wilson, made the first reliable measurements of the temperatures of the upper clouds of Venus. They gave a value of − 38 ◦ C for the day side and − 33 ◦ C for the dark side, which is in excellent agreement with modern values. Then, in 1932, W. S. Adams and T. Dunham, also at Mount Wilson, used spectroscopic methods to analyze the upper atmosphere and identified carbon dioxide – now known to make up almost the whole of the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide has a strong greenhouse effect, and it followed that the surface of Venus must be very hot indeed. A high surface temperature was also indicated by the first radio measurements of Venus at centimetre wavelengths, made by Mayer and his team in the United States in 1958. The composition of the clouds remained uncertain. In 1937 R. Wildt suggested that they were made up of formaldehyde, and this remained the favoured theory until space-craft results showed it to be incorrect. Neither was the nature of the surface known. In 1954 F. L. Whipple and D. H. Menzel proposed that Venus was mainly water- covered, and that the clouds were composed chiefly of H 2 O, but this attractive ‘marine’ theory was disproved by the Mariner 2 results of 1962. Venus is far too hot for liquid water to exist on its surface. Virtually all our detailed knowledge of Venus’ atmosphere, beneath the cloud tops, comes from the various space-craft launched since 1961; a list of these is given in Table 5.5. Some of the earlier Venera probes designed to land on the surface were actually crushed during their descent, because the atmosphere was even thicker than had been expected. Below an altitude of 80 km the atmosphere is made up of over 96% of carbon dioxide and about 3% of nitrogen (N 2 ), which does not leave much room for anything else; there are minute traces of carbon monoxide, helium, argon, sulphur dioxide, oxygen and water vapour and other gases such as krypton and xenon. The clouds are rich in sulphuric acid, and at some levels there must be sulphuric acid ‘rain’, which however evaporates well before reaching the surface. The troposphere extends from the surface to an altitude of 65 km; above, the stratosphere and mesosphere extend to 95km, andthencomestheupperatmosphere, whichreaches out to at least 400 km. Venus has no detectable overall magnetic field (it must be at least 25 000 times weaker than that of the Earth), but the dense atmosphere and magnetic eddy currents induced in its ionosphere produce a well- marked bow shock, and prevent the solar wind particles from reaching the surface. The wind structure is remarkable; the whole atmosphere may be said to be super-rotating. The winds decrease from 100 m s − 1 at the cloud-top level to only 50ms − 1 at 50 km, and only a few metres per second at the surface, although even a slow wind will have tremendous force in that dense atmosphere. It is notable that there is little wind erosion on the surface, although there are obvious signs of æolian depositional activity. The atmospheric pressure at the surface is about 90 times greater than that of the Earth’s air at sea-level – roughly equivalent to being under water on the sea floor of Earth at a depth of 9 km. The greenhouse effect of the carbon dioxide leads to a surface temperature of around 467 ◦ C, and this is practically the same for the day and night hemispheres of the planet. There are various cloud layers. The upper clouds lie at 70 km, and at a height of 63 km the temperature is 13 ◦ C, 90 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"V ENUS with an outside pressure of 0.5 atmospheres. At an altitude of 50 km above the surface the temperature is 20 ◦ C; below lies a clear layer, and then a layer of denser cloud. Beneath this layer, at 47 km, there is a second clear region. The cloud deck ends at 30 km above the ground, and at the surface there is almost complete calm. The light level is low, and following the successful landings of the first Soviet probesitwassaidthattheilluminationwasroughlythesame as that at Moscow on a cloudy winter day. There was no need to use the searchlights with which the probes had been equipped. Very valuable information was obtained from two balloons dropped into Venus’ atmosphere by the Russian Vega space-craft in June 1985, en route to rendezvous with Halley’s Comet. (Small landers were also dropped, and sent back data from the actual surface.) The balloon from Vega 1 entered the atmosphere at 11 km s − 1 on 10 June, over the night side, and was tracked for 46 hours as it drifted over into the day side; the Vega 2 balloon (15 June) was equally successful. One revelation was that at the level of the balloons there were stronger vertical atmospheric up- currents than had been predicted. On 10 February 1990 the Galileo space-craft flew past Venus, en route for Jupiter, and scanned the night side; it appeared that the cloud deck, 50–58 km high, was very turbulent. It may be transporting heat upward from below via very large convention cells. S PACE-CRAFT T O V ENUS The first of all interplanetary probes was Russia’s Venera 1, launched on 12 February 1961. It lost contact when it had receded to 7500 000 km from Earth, and we cannot be sure what happened to it; it may have by-passed Venus in May 1961 at around 100 000 km, and is presumably still in solar orbit. In July 1962 the Americans made their first attempt, with Mariner 1, but the result was disastrous – Mariner1plungedintothesea, apparentlybecausesomeone had forgotten to feed a minus sign into a computer (a slight mistake which cost approximately $4280 000). But then came the triumphant Mariner 2, and the era of direct planetary exploration had well and truly begun. During its encounter with Venus, Mariner 2 revolutionized many of our ideas about the planet. The Whipple–Menzel marine theory was killed at once; the high surface temperature and long rotation were confirmed, as was the absence of any detectable magnetic field. Venus and Earth were indeed non-identical twins. Great interest in the exploration of Venus was maintained during the 1960s and 1970s. The Russians concentrated upon controlled landings, and after several initial failures they succeeded; in October 1975 Veneras 9 and 10 were able to transmit for 55 and 65 minutes respectively after arrival before being put permanently out of action by the hostile environment. The landing procedures were obviously difficult; everything had to be automatic, and the space-craft had to be chilled before beginning their descent through the dense, fiercely hot atmosphere. American efforts were concentrated upon fly-by missions and orbiters. Mariner 5 by-passed Venus in 1967 and sent back data, but it was aimed essentially at Mercury, and passed Venus in what is termed a ‘gravity assist’ manœuvre. The Pioneer Venus mission in 1978 was complex; it consisted of a ‘bus’ carrying four smaller probes which were released well before the rendezvous and made ‘hard’ landings on the surface, leaving the ‘bus’ to burn away in Venus’ upper atmosphere. The landers were not designed to transmit after arrival, although in fact one of them (the ‘Day’ probe, which came down in the area now called Themis Regio on the sunlit hemisphere) did so for over an hour. Most of our detailed knowledge of the surface comes from the Magellan orbiter, which operated well for over four years (1990–1994). Since then there have been no deliberate Venus missions, although data were obtained from Galileo, bound for Jupiter, in 1990 and a certain amount from the Cassini space-craft, which passed Venus in 1998 and 1999 on its way to a rendezvous with Saturn. It is probably true to say that since we have established the unfriendly nature of Venus, interest in the planet has to a certain extent waned, and has been transferred to Mars. It is very clear that no manned missions to Venus are likely to be undertaken in the foreseeable future. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 91"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"V ENUS Table 5.5.

The first pictures from the surface, sent back by Veneras 9 and 10, were obtained under a pressure of about 90 000 mbars and an intolerably high temperature – which had been expected, in view of the greenhouse effects of the atmospheric carbon dioxide. The Venera 9 landscape was described as ‘a heap of stones’, several dozen centimetres in diameter and with sharp edges; the Venera 10 landing site was smoother, as through it were an older plateau. The first attempts at analysis of the surface materials were made in March 1982 by Veneras 13 and 14, which landed in the general region of the area now known as Phœbe Regio. Venera 13 dropped a lander which continued to transmit for a record 127 minutes after arrival; the temperature was + 457 ◦ C and the pressure 89 atmospheres. Venera 14 came down in a plain near Navka Planitia; there were fewer of the sharp, angular rocks of the Venera 13 site. The temperature was given as 465 ◦ C, and the pressure 94 atmospheres. In both cases it was reported that highly alkaline potassium basalts were much in evidence. The first attempts at mapping Venus were made by using Earth-based radar, but only with the Pioneer mission in 1978 did it become possible to obtain really reliable information. Then came the Magellan mission, which was launched in May 1989 and which proved to be completely successful; it remained fully operative until it burned away in Venus’ atmosphere on 11 October 1994. Magellan could resolve features down to 120 m; the orbital period was 3.2 h, and the high inclination of the orbit meant that the polar zones could be studied as well as the rest of the planet. The main dish (3.7 m across) transmitted downwards a pulse at an oblique angle to the space-craft, striking the surface below much as a beam of sunlight will do on Earth. The surface rocks modified the pulse before it was reflected back to the antenna; rough areas are radar-bright, while smooth areas are radar-dark. A smaller antenna sent down a vertical pulse, and the time lapse between transmission and return gave the altitude of the surface below to an accuracy of 30 m. Altogether, Magellan studied about 98% of the total surface of Venus. Venus is a world of volcanic plains, highlands and lowlands. The plains cover 65–70% of the surface, with lowlands accounting for less than 30% and highlands for only 8%. About 60% of the surface lies within 500 m of Venus’ mean radius, with only 5% at more than 2 km above it; the total range of elevations is 13 km. The highest mountains are the Maxwell Mountains, which rise to 11 km above the mean radius or 8.2 km above the adjacent plateau in Ishtar Terra. The lowest point is Diana Chasma, in the Aphrodite area, 2 km below the mean radius. The features now mapped on Venus are given in Table 5.6, but this is of course a selected list, since many more features have not been given names. It was laid down that all names on the planet should be female – the only exception being the Maxwell Mountains, named after the 19th-century Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell; this name was given before the official policy was formulated. Many of the names are familiar, such as Florence Nightingale and Marie Curie, but not everyone will know that, for example, Auralia was Julius Cæsar’s mother, Heng-O was a Chinese Moon goddess, Marie Vigier Lebrun a French painter and Vellamo a Finnish mermaid! Vulcanism dominates the surface, and there are lava flows everywhere. There are two very large highland areas, Ishtar Terra in the northern hemisphere and Aphrodite area, which lies mainly in the south but is crossed by the equator. Ishtar is about the size of Australia (2900 km in diameter) and consists of western and eastern components separated by the Maxwell Mountains, the highest elevations on Venus and which have steep slopes of up to 35 ◦ in places. Maxwell forms the eastern edge of a high plateau, Lakshmi Planum, which is bounded to the south, west and north respectively by the Freyja Akna and Danu Mountains. Lakshmiisrelativelysmooth, coveredwithlava which has flowed from the caldera-like structure Colette; Colette itself has collapsed to 3 km below the adjacent surface. Aphrodite is larger – 9700 × 3200 km – and consists of eastern and western elevated areas separated by a lower area. Western Aphrodite is made up of two regions, Thetis and Ovda, which lie from 3 to 4 km above the mean radius of Venus. These regions are dominated by what used to be called ‘parquet’ terrain; this term was abandoned as being too unscientific, and was replaced by ‘tesseræ’. Tessera terrain is characterized by extreme roughness, and covers THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 93"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"V ENUS Figure 5.1. Venus. about 8% of the total surface of Venus. It seems to be unique to Venus – at least so far as we know; this also applies to the coronæ and arachnoids. Eastern Aphrodite is dominated by chasmata, which are deep, narrow canyons. One end of Aphrodite has been nicknamed the Scorpion’s Tail, although known officially as Atla Regio; it is thought to be one of the main volcanic areas. Also of note is the highland area of Beta Regio and Phœbe Regio. Here we have what is partly a large shield volcano and partly a tessera-type highland, cut by a rift valley similar to a large scale version of the terrestrial East African Rift. There is also the southern highland of Lada Terra, first noted by the US probe Magellan. Volcanic activity has produced features ranging from huge shield volcanoes, such as Sapas Mons (base 40 km across, height 1.5 km, with a large summit caldera) and Maat Mons, down to small structures, domes and what are still called pancake structures, probably in the nature of low, gentle domes. There are coronæ, complex features usually more or less circular, up to 2 km high and 400 km, across, surrounded by ridges and troughs, and there are the curious ‘arachnoids’, so named because of their outward resemblance to spiders’ webs. The main volcanoes are of the shield type, as in our Hawaii. The high atmospheric pressure on Venus inhibits the flow of gas coming out in solution as the molten rock rises, making Hawaiian-type fire fountains rather unlikely; in general the magma is less dense than the rock through which it rises. Magellan recorded 140 large volcanoes with bases more than 100 km across, as well as many others of smaller size. The crust of Venus seems to be less mobile than that of the Earth, so that terrestrial-type plate tectonics do not 94 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"V ENUS apply; a volcano which forms over a ‘hot spot’ will not drift away, as Mauna Kea in Hawaii has done, but will remain active over a very long period. There has been extensive flooding from lavas sent out both from volcanic calderæ and from fissures at lower levels, probably from 300 to 500 million years ago. Current activity is probable, perhaps in the smaller highland area of Beta Regio, which has two massive peaks – Theia Mons, which is certainly a shield volcano, and its neighbour Rhea Mons. Impact craters abound, but are rather different from those on Mercury or the Moon; the dense atmosphere means that no meteorite more than 30 km across can hit the surface with sufficient force to produce a crater, and impact craters below 3 km across are absent, although there are some vast structures. Mead, the largest, is 280 km in diameter. The smaller craters are not lunar-type bowls, but are less regular. For the last few hundred million years the surface activity has been dominated by rift-associated vulcanism, and the fact that impact craters are less crowded than those of the Moon or Mercury indicates that the overall age of the surface features cannot be more than about 750 million years – perhaps considerably less. The largest circular lowland is Atalanta Regio, east of Ishtar; it is on average 1.4 km below the level of the mean radius and is about the area of the Gulf of Mexico. There are long lava channels, such as Hildr Chasm which is longer than the Nile. T HE I NTERIOR O F V ENUS The lithosphere of Venus seems to be predominantly basaltic, and may go down to around 20–40 km, although in some areas (mainly associated with tesseræ), it may be more – perhaps down to 60 km. Below this comes the mantle and the core, about which our knowledge is very limited. The lack of a detectable magnetic field may be significant. S ATELLITE Venus has no satellite. This now seems quite definite. A satellite was reported by G. D. Cassini in 1666, when on 18 August he saw what he regarded as a genuine attendant; other reports followed, the last coming from Montbaron, at Auxerre, on 29 March 1974. It is certain that the observers were deceived by ‘telescopic ghosts’. Table 5.6. Features on Venus. (Bold numbers indicate map references.) Name Lat. Long.

Between 50 and 100 km below the surface the lithospheric rocks become hot and structurally weak. The outer shell is divided into eight major ‘plates’ and over 20 minor ones; the boundaries between the plates are associated with transform faults, subduction zones, earthquakes, volcanoes and mountain ranges. The continents drift around relative to each other; this was first proposed in 1915 by the Austrian meteorologist Alfred Wegener, and has led on to the science of plate tectonics.

Partial melting of mantle material produces basalt, which issues from volcanic vents on the ocean floors. The base of the mantle is marked by the Gutenberg Discontinuity, where the rock composition changes from silicate to metallic and its state from solid to liquid. The outer liquid core extends down to 5150 km, and contains 31% of the Earth’s mass. The inner core, down to the centre of the globe, is solid and has 1.7% of the total mass; it has been said to ‘float’ in the surrounding liquid core. The core is iron-rich. The solid inner core, approximately 2400 km in diameter, is thought to have a central temperature of about 4530 ◦ C, with a density of 13.1 g cm − 3 . Currents in the liquid core, involving iron, are responsible for the Earth’s magnetic field. The outer boundary of the solid core is known as the Lehmann Discontinuity, first identified by the Danish scientist Inge Lehmann in 1936. Most of our knowledge of the Earth’s interior comes from studies of earthquakes. Seismic waves are of three types; surface, primary(P-waves)andsecondary(S-waves). P-waves (‘push-waves’) can travel through liquid; S-waves (‘shake-waves’) cannot, and it was this which gave the first definite proof that the Earth does have a liquid core. G EOLOGICAL E VOLUTION The age of the Earth is approximately 4.6 thousand million years. Palæontology – the study of past life forms through fossil remains – has enabled us to draw up a fairly reli- able picture of the Earth’s evolution; details are given in Table 6.3. There have been periodical ice ages, the last of which ended only 10 000 years ago, and no doubt the Earth has been struck by massive bodies from space; it is often maintained that a violent impact about 65 000 000 years ago caused a dramatic change in climate, leading to the extinc- tion of the dinosaurs. This is known as the K-T extinction, separating the Cretaceous Period (K) from the the Triassic Period (T). Evidence is said to come from the amount of iridium in rocks laid down at that period – although it must be added that an earlier and even more widespread extinc- tion of species occurred at the end of the Permian Period, and rocks of that age are not enriched in iridium. A TMOSPHERE The Earth’s atmosphere is divided into various layers. The structure is given in Table 6.4, the composition in Table 6.5. The lowest layer (troposphere) includes all normal clouds and all ‘weather’. On average the temperature falls by 1 . 6 ◦ C per 300 m altitude (the ‘lapse rate’). The upper boundary, the tropopause, is considerably higher over the equator than over the polar regions. Above comes the stratosphere, first studied from 1904 by T. de Bort, using unmanned balloons; the temperature is stable up to 25 km, but then increases – bearing in mind that scientific ‘temperature’ is defined by the speeds at which the atoms and molecules move around, and is the not the same as what we ordinarily refer to as ‘heat’; it rises to 470–490 ◦ C at the stratopause, which is the upper boundary of the stratosphere. The ozone layer lies in the stratosphere; it is this which absorbs solar ultra-violet radiation and increases the temperature. Next comes the mesosphere (a term introduced by S. Chapman in 1950), where the temperature decreases with height; noctilucent clouds are found here. Above comes the thermosphere, also known as the ionosphere because it contains the layers which reflect some radio waves back to Earth and make long-range radio communication possible. It consists of electrically charged particles produced by the ionization of atmospheric atoms and molecules by solar and galactic radiation; it is markedly affected by changes in the solar wind, and it is here that we find auroræ as well as meteor trails. Finally there is the exosphere, which is a collisionless gas and is very tenuous; it has no definite boundary, but simply thins out until the density is no greater than that of the interplanetary medium. M AGNETOSPHERE The Earth has a fairly strong magnetic field; at the equator it is 0.305 G. The magnetic axis is at present offset to the rotational axis by 10 . 8 ◦ and the north magnetic pole is located at Ellef Ringnes Island, off north Canada. Magnetic field lines run between the magnetic poles, and charged particles become trapped, forming the magnetosphere. The impact of the solar wind on the magnetopause (the outer boundary of the magnetosphere) compresses the magnetosphere on the day side of the Earth, while the field lines facing away from the Sun stream back to form the magnetotail. On the day side, the magnetosphere extends from 80 to 60 000 km, while on the night side it trails out to over 300 000 km. 100 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"E ARTH Table 6.4.

The amount of water vapour is variable; in the range of 1%. In the magnetosphere are the Van Allen Belts, discovered by the American astronomer J. Van Allen whose equipment was carried in the first successful US satellite, Explorer 1 of 1958. There are two belts. One is centred at about 3000 km above the Earth and has a thickness of 5000 km; it consists of energetic protons and electrons, probably originating from interactions between cosmic-ray particles and the upper atmosphere. The outer belt, centred 15 000 to 20 000 km above the Earth, is from 6000 to 10 000 km thick; it is made up of less energetic protons and electrons, believed to come mainly from the solar wind. Because the Earth’s magnetic axis is offset to the axis of rotation, there is an area where the inner Van Allen belt dips down toward the Earth’s surface; this happens above the South Atlantic, off the Brazilian coast, and is known as the South Atlantic Anomaly. It allows charged particles to penetrate deeper into the atmosphere, and this can affect artificial satellites. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 101"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"7M ARS Mars, the fourth planet in order of distance from the Sun, must have been known since very ancient times, since when at its best it can outshine any other planet or star apart from Venus. Its strong red colour led to its being named in honour of the God of War, Ares (Mars); the study of the Martian surface is still officially known as ‘areography’. Mars was recorded by the old Egyptian, Chinese and Assyrian star-gazers, and the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC) observed an occultation of Mars by the Moon, although the exact date of the phenomenon is not known. According to Ptolemy, the first precise observation of the position of Mars dates back to 27 January 272 BC, when the planet was close to the star β Scorpii. Data for Mars are given in Table 7.1. Oppositions occur at a mean interval of 779.9 days, so that in general they fall in alternate years (Table 7.2). The closest oppositions occur when Mars is at or near perihelion, as in 2003, when the minimum distance will be only 56 000 000 km. The greatest distance between Earth and Mars, with Mars at superior conjunction, may amount to 400 000 000 km. The last favourable oppositions occur with Mars at aphelion, as in 1995 (minimum distance 101 000 000 km). Mars shows appreciable phases, and at times only 85% of the day side is turned toward us. At opposition, the phase is of course virtually 100%. At times Mars may be occulted by the Moon, and there are also close conjunctions with other planets (Table 7.3). Planetary occultations of or by Mars are very rare; the next occasion will be on 11 August 2079, whenMarswillbeoccultedbyMercury. Occultations of Mars by the Moon are reasonably frequent (Table 7.4). T HE M ARTIAN S EASONS The seasons on Mars are of the same general type as those of Earth, since the axial tilt is very similar and the Martian day (sol) is not a great deal longer (1 sol = 1 . 029 days). The lengths of the seasons are given in Table 7.5. Southern summer occurs near perihelion. Therefore, climates in the southern hemisphere of Mars show a wider range of temperature than those in the north. The effects are Table 7.1. Data.

It was these observations which enabled Kepler, in 1609, topublishhisfirstLawsofPlanetaryMotion, showing that the planets move round the Sun in elliptical rather than circular orbits.

Fontana’s second drawing (24 August 1638) was similar. On 28 November 1659, at 7 pm, Christiaan Huygens made the first telescopic drawing to show genuine detail. His sketch shows the Syrtis Major in easily recognizable form, although exaggerated in size. This sketch has been very useful in confirming the constancy of Mars’ rotation period. It was Huygens himself who gave the first reasonably good estimate of the length of the rotation period; on 1 December 1659 he recorded that the period was ‘about 24 hours’. In 1666, G. D. Cassini gave a value of 24h 40m, which is very close to the truth; in the same year he made the first record of the polar caps. It has been claimed that a cap was seen by Huygens in 1656, but his surviving drawing is very inconclusive. (However, Huygens undoubtedly saw the south polar cap in 1672.) The discovery that the polar caps do not coincide with the rotational (areographical) poles was made in 1719 by G. Marald i – a year in which Mars was at perihelic opposition and was so bright that it caused a mild panic; some people mistook it for a red comet which was about to collide with the Earth! In 1704 Maraldi had made a series of observations of the caps, and had given a value for the rotation period of 24h 39m. William Herschel observed Mars between 1777 and 1783, and suggested that the polar caps were made of ice and snow. Herschel also measured the rotation period, and his observations were later re-worked by W. Beer and J. H. M ̈ adler, yielding a period of 24h 37m 23s.7, which is only one second in error. Herschel also made the first good determination of the axial inclination of Mars; he gave a value of 28 ◦ , which is only 4 ◦ too great. At present the north pole star of Mars is Deneb ( α Cygni), but the inclination ranges between 14 . 9 ◦ and 35 . 2 ◦ over a cycle of 51 000 Earth years, which has important long-term effects. In 25 000 years from now it will be the northern hemisphere which is turned sunward when Mars is at perihelion. These greater precessional effects are due to the fact that the globe of Mars is considerably more oblate than that of the Earth. Useful drawings of Mars were made by J. H. Schr ̈ oter, from Lilienthal in Germany, between 1785 and 1814, but Schr ̈ oter never produced a complete map, and the first reasonably good map was due to Beer and M ̈ adler, from Berlin, in 1830–32; the telescope used was Beer’s 9.5 cm refractor. Beer and M ̈ adler were also the first to report a dark band round the periphery of a shrinking polar cap. This band was seen by almost all subsequent observers, and in the late 19th century Percival Lowell attributed it – wrongly – to moistening of the ground by the melting polar ice. Telescopic observations also revealed the presence of a Martian atmosphere. In 1783 Herschel observed the close approach of Mars to a background star, and from this concluded that the atmosphere could not be very extensive. Clouds on Mars were first reported by the French astronomer H. Flaugergues in 1811, who also suggested that the southern polar cap must have a greater range of 104 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"M ARS Table 7.6.

Arago. ‘White’ clouds in the Martian atmosphere were first seen by Angelo Secchi (Italy) in 1858. Secchi’s sketches also show surface features, notably the Syrtis Major, which he called the ‘Atlantic Canal’ – an inappropriate name, particularly because there was at that time no suggestion that it might be artificial. During the 1850s good drawings were made by the British amateur Warren de la Rue, using his 33 cm reflector, and useful maps were subsequently compiled by Sir Norman Lockyer, F. Kaiser, R. A. Proctor and others, although it was not until the work of G. V. Schiaparelli, from 1877, that really detailed maps were produced. For some time it was tacitly assumed that the bright areas on Mars must be lands, while the dark areas were regarded as seas (although, strangely, Schr ̈ oter believed that all the observed features were atmospheric in nature). Then, in 1860, E. Liais, a French astronomer living in Brazil, suggested that the dark areas were more likely to be vegetation tracts than oceans, and in 1863 Schiaparelli pointed out that the dark areas did not show the Sun’s reflection, astheywouldbeexpectedtodoiftheyweremade of water. Agreement was by no means universal; Secchi wrote that ‘the existence of continents and seas has been conclusively proved’, and in 1865 Camille Flammarion wrote that ‘in places the water must be very deep’, although he later modified this view and suggested that the dark areas might be composed of material in an intermediate state, neither pure liquid nor pure vapour. It was only it the late 19th century that the concept of major oceans on Mars was definitely abandoned. N OMENCLATURE With the compilation of better maps, thought was given to naming the various markings. In 1867 the British astronomer R. A. Proctor produced a map in which he named the features after famous observers – Cassini Land, M ̈ adler Land and so on. His system was followed by other British observers, but was widely criticized. Various modifications were introduced, but in 1877 the whole system was overthrown in favour of a new one by G. V. Schiaparelli. The Proctor and Schiaparelli names are compared in Table 7.6. Basically, Schiaparelli’s system has been retained, although the space-probe results have meant that in recent years it has had to be drastically amended.

T HE C ANALS Who has not heard of the canals of Mars? Not so very many decades ago they were regarded as well-established features, quite possibly of artificial origin. The first detection of an alleged canal network was due to Schiaparelli in 1877, when he recorded 40 features; he called them canali (channels), but this was inevitably translated as canals. Streaks had been recorded earlier by various observers, including Beer and M ̈ adler (1830–32) andW.R.Dawes(1864), butSchiaparelli’sworkmarkedthe beginning of the ‘canal controversy’. Schiaparelli himself maintained an open mind, and wrote ‘The suggestion has been made that the channels are of artificial origin. I am very careful not to combat this suggestion, which contains nothing impossible’. In 1879 he reported the twinning, or gemination, of some canals. The first observers to support the network were Perrotin and Thollon, at the Nice Observatory, in 1886, and subsequently canals became fashionable; they were widely reported even by observers using small telescopes. Percival Lowell, who built the observatory at Flagstaff in Arizona mainly to observe Mars, was convinced of their artificiality, and wrote ‘That Mars is inhabited by beings of some sort or other is as certain as it is uncertain what these beings may be’. In 1892 W. H. Pickering observed canals and other features in the dark regions as well as the bright areas, and thus more or less killed the theory that the dark areas might be seas, but it was often claimed that a canal was a narrow water- course, possibly piped, surrounded to either side by strips of irrigated land. As recently as 1956 G. de Vaucouleurs, a leading observer of Mars, still maintained that though the canals were certainly not artificial, they did have ‘a basis of reality’. In fact, this is not so. The canals were due to tricks of the eye, and do not correspond to any true features on Mars. Equally illusory is the ‘wave of darkening’; it had been claimed that when a polar cap shrank, releasing moisture, the plants near the cap became more distinct, and that this effect spread steadily from the polar regions to the Martian equator. Only since the Space Age has it been shown that the dark areas are not old sea-beds, and are not coated with organic material 1 . Lowell’s brilliant Martian civilization has long since been banished to the realm of myth, but as an aside it 1 From 1953, when I was engaged in mapping the Moon, I was able to make extensive use of the Lowell refractor, and I also turned it toward Mars. I saw nothing remotely resembling a canal, and neither could I follow the alleged ‘wave of darkening’. Under the circumstances, I am delighted that I failed. 106 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"M ARS is interesting to look back at some of the suggestions made about signalling to the Martians. The first idea seems to have been due to the great German mathematician K. F. Gauss, about 1802; his plan was to draw vast geometrical patterns in the Siberian tundra. In 1819 J. von Littrow, of Vienna, proposed to use signal fires lit in the Sahara. Later, in 1874, Charles Cros, in France, put forward a scheme to focus the Sun’s heat on to the Martian deserts by means of a huge burning-glass; the glass could be swung around to write messages in the deserts! The first (and only) prize offered for communicating with extra-terrestrial beings was the Guzman Prize, announced in Paris on 17 December 1900. The sum involved was 100 000 francs – but Mars was excluded, because it was felt that calling up the Martians would be too easy. Radio then came into the story. In 1906, when Marconi set up a telegraph station at Cape Clear, British operators reported a strange regular signal of three dots (the Morse letter S) which they could not explain, while in 1921 Marconi himself reported receiving the Morse letter V at 150 000 m. Not to be outdone, the astronomer David Todd and balloonist L. Stevens planned to take a sensitive radio receiverupinaballoon, reducingterrestrialinterferenceand making it easier to detect messages from Mars. At about the same time (1909) the well-known physicist R. W. Wood suggested building a large array of cylinders, blacked on one side, so that they could be set up in a desert and swung round to send signals to the Martians. A concerted effort was made in August 1924, when Mars was at its closest. Radio transmitters in various parts of the United States were temporarily shut down so that signals from Mars could be picked up, and ready to translate them was W. F. Friedman, head of the code section of the US Army Signals Corps. At Dulwich, in Outer London, radio listeners reported possible Martian signals at 30 000 m. In 1926 a Dr Mansfield Robinson went to the Central Telegraph Office in London and dispatched a telegram to Mars – for which he was charged the standard 18 pence per word. Tactfully, the postal authorities noted it as ‘Reply not guaranteed’. Perhaps the last word was said in 1992 by Mr. C. Cockell, who fought the General Election on behalf of the Forward to Mars Party. The constituency he selected was Huntingdon, where the sitting member was the then Prime Minister, Mr. John Major. It is sad to relate that Mr. Cockell lost his deposit! E ARTH-BASED O BSERVATIONS, P RE-1964 Energetic observations of Mars were continued during the years before the opening of the Space Age. The behaviour of the polar caps was carefully followed; it was generally believed that the caps were very thin – probably no more than a few millimetres thick, so that they would be in the nature of hoar-frost; there was considerable support for a theory due to A. C. Ranyard and Johnstone Stoney (1898) that the material was solid carbon dioxide rather than water ice. The first useful measurements of the surface temperature of the planet were made in 1909 by Nicholson and Petit at Mount Wilson and by Coblentz and Lampland at Flagstaff; they found that Mars has a mean surface temperature of − 28 ◦ C, as against + 15 ◦ C for Earth. Lampland also announced the detection of what became known as the ‘violet layer’, supposed to block out short- wave solar radiation, and prevent them from reaching the Martian surface, except on occasions when it temporarily cleared away; we now know that it does not exist – it is as unreal as the canal network and the wave of darkening. In 1933 W. S. Adams and T. Dunham analyzed the Martian atmosphere by using the Doppler method. When Mars is approaching the Earth, the spectral lines should be shifted to the short-wave end of the band; when Mars is receding, the shift should be to the red. It was hoped that in this way any lines due to gases in the Martian at- mosphere could be disentangled from the lines produced by these same gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. From their results, Adams and Dunham concluded that the amount of oxygen over Mars was less than 0.1% of the amount exist- ing in the atmosphere of the Earth. In 1947 G. P. Kuiper reported spectroscopic results indicating carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere, but it was generally believed that most of the atmosphere was made up of nitrogen – whereas we now know that it is mainly composed of carbon dioxide. In 1934 the Russian astronomer N. Barabaschev estimated the atmospheric pressure at the surface, giving a value of 50 mbars; he later increased this to between 80 and 90 mbars – a gross overestimate, since the real pressure is nowhere THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 107"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"M ARS as high as 10 mbars. In 1954 W. M. Sinton claimed to have detected organic matter in the spectra of the dark areas, but these results were later found to be spurious. One intrigu- ing theory was due to E. J. ̈ Opik, an Estonian astronomer resident at Armagh in Northern Ireland. He maintained that the dark areas had to be made up of material which could grow and push aside the red, dusty stuff blown from the ‘deserts’ – otherwise they would soon be covered up. Cer- tainly there were major dust storms, usually when Mars was near perihelion, as in 1924, 1929, 1941 and 1956. Before 1964 it was believed that Mars was a world without major mountains or valleys; that the caps were thin, and very probably made up of solid carbon dioxide; that the atmosphere was composed chiefly of nitrogen, with a ground pressure of the order of 87 mbars; that the dark areas were old sea-beds, covered with primitive vegetation; and that the red regions were ‘deserts’, not of sand but of reddish minerals such as felsite or limonite. Then came the flight of Mariner 4, and in a very short time all these conclusions, apart from the last, were found to be completely wrong. S PACE M ISSIONS T O M ARS It is believed that the Soviet authorities made several unsuccessful attempts to send probes to Mars between 1960 and 1962, but no details have ever been released. The first space-craft to Mars of which we have definite information was the Soviet Mars 1, launched on 1 November 1962; contact with it was lost on 21 March 1963, at a range of about 105 000 km, and though it may have passed fairly close to Mars contact was never regained. The first successful mission was America’s Mariner 4, which by- passed Mars in July 1965. Since then many probes have been launched – all American or Russian apart from the Japanese Nozomi (‘Hope’) sent up in 1998. Surprisingly, almost all the information has come from American vehicles; the Russians have had very little success. A list of the Mars missions between 1962 and the present time is given in Table 7.8. Dealing first with the Russian probes, it has to be admitted that the story is not a happy one. Between 1971 and 1974 six space-craft were launched, but all were either total or partial failures; little was learned from them. Two missions to the inner satellite, Phobos, were sent up in 1988, but the first of these went out of contact during the outward journey – human error was responsible – and the second ‘went silent’ before it had started the main part of its mission, for unknown reasons. Even more disappointing was the loss of the elaborate Mars 96 probe, which carried a number of experiments. Unfortunately the fourth stage of the rocket launcher failed, and Mars 96 fell Earthward, burning away in the atmosphere. Japan’s first and only attempt, Nozomi, went on its way in July 1998 and is intended to orbit the planet, sending back miscellaneous data. It is expected to reach the orbit of Mars in December 2003. Otherwise, the field has been left to the United States. Mariner 3 (5 November 1964) was a prompt failure; control was lost, and although the probe must have entered solar orbit there is no hope of contacting it. However, its twin, Mariner 4, was a triumphant success. It flew past Mars, making its closest approach at 01h 0m 57s on 15 July 1965 and sent back the first close-range images, showing unmistakable craters. Many years earlier, it had been claimed that craters had been seen from Earth, by E. E. Barnard in 1892, using the Lick Observatory refractor, and by J. Mellish in 1917, with the Yerkes refractor; but these observations were never published, and are decidedly dubious. Craters had been predicted in 1944 by D. L. Cyr (admittedly for the wrong reasons), but it was not until the flight of Mariner 4 that they were definitely found. Mariner 4 also confirmed the thinness of the atmosphere, and demonstrated that the dark areas were not depressed sea-beds; indeed some, such as Syrtis Major, are plateaux. The idea of vegetation tracts was abandoned, and the final nail driven into the coffin of the canals. Mariner 4 remained in contact until 20 December 1967; it is now in solar orbit, with a period of 587 days. Its perihelion distance from the Sun is 165 000 000 km, while at aphelion it swings out to 235 000 000km. Ofcourse, alltrackofithassincebeenlost. Mariners 6 and 7, of 1969, were also successful and sent back good images – notably of Hellas, a bright feature which was once thought to be a snow-covered plateau but now known to be a deep basin; when filled with cloud it can become so brilliant that it can easily be mistaken for an extra polar cap. Yet it was only later that the true character of Mars was revealed. By ill chance, Mariners 4, 6 and 7 passed over the least spectacular areas, and it was only 108 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"M ARS Table 7.8. Missions to Mars.

Mariner 8 failed – the second stage of the rocket launcher failed to ignite – but Mariner 9 entered a closed path round Mars and for the first time provided views of the towering volcanoes and the deep valleys. When it first reached the neighbourhood of Mars, a major dust storm was in progress, but this soon cleared, and the full-scale photographic coverage of the surface could begin. The most widespread dust-storms occur when Mars is near perihelion, as was the case when Mariner 9 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 109"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"M ARS reached the planet (perihelion had fallen in the previous September). If the windspeed exceeds a certain critical value–50to100ms − 1 – grains of surface material, about 100 μ m across, are whipped up and given a ‘skipping’ motion, known technically as saltation. On striking the surface they propel smaller grains, a few micrometres across, into the atmosphere, where they may remain suspended for weeks. Over 100 localized storms and ‘dust devils’ occur every Martian year, and at times a storm becomes global, so that for a while all surface details are hidden. The maximum windspeeds may reach 400 km h − 1 , but in that tenuous atmosphere they will have little force. Next came the Vikings, which were launched in 1975 and reached Mars in 1976. Each Viking consisted of an orbiterandalander; theorbitercontinuedthesurveysstarted by Mariner 9 and also acted as a relay for the lander. The lander, separated when the probe had entered Martian orbit, came down gently, braked partly by parachute and partly by retro-rockets; the touchdown speed was no more than 9.6 km h − 1 . Fortunately both landers came down clear of the rocks which are strewn all over the planet’s surface. By the end of 1976 our knowledge of Mars had been improved beyond all recognition. A TMOSPHERE The main constituent is indeed carbon dioxide, which accounts for more than 95% of the total; nitrogen accounts for 2.7% and argon for 1.6%, which does not leave much room for other gases (Table 7.9). The highest atmospheric pressure so far measured is 8.9 mbars, on the floor of the deep impact basin Hellas, while the pressure at the top of the lofty Olympus Mons is below 3 mbars. When Viking 1 landed in the golden plain of Chryse (latitude 22 ◦ . 4N) the pressure was approximately 7 mbars. A decrease of 0.012 mbar per sol was subsequently measured, due to carbon dioxide condensing out of the atmosphere to be deposited on the south polar cap, but this is a seasonal phenomenon, and ceased while Vikings 1 and 2 were still operating. The maximum temperature of the aeroshell of Viking 1 during the descent to Mars was 1500 ◦ C; that of Viking 2 was similar. The atmospheric pressure is at present too low for liquid water to exist on the surface, but there is no doubt Table 7.9. Composition of the Martian atmosphere, at the surface. (ppm = parts per million). Carbon dioxide, CO 2 95.32% Nitrogen, N 2 2.7% Argon, 40 Ar 1.6% Oxygen, O 2 0.03% Carbon monoxide, CO 0.07% Water vapour, H 2 O 0.03% (variable) Neon, Ne 2.5 ppm Krypton, Kr 0.3 ppm Xenon, Xe 0.08 ppm Ozone, O 3 0.03 ppm that water did once exist; Mariner 9 and the Viking orbiters showed clear evidence of old riverbeds and even islands, while confirmation was obtained from the Pathfinder mission of 1997 that the area where Pathfinder landed (Ares Vallis) was once water-covered. Mars may well go through very marked climatic changes. This may be due to the effects of the changing axial inclination (between 14 . 9 ◦ and 35 . 5 ◦ over a cycle of 51 000 years) and the changing orbital eccentricity (from 0.004 to 0.141 in a cycle of 90 000 years). When one of the poles is markedly tilted sunward when Mars is at perihelion, some of the volatiles may sublime, temporarily thickening the atmosphere and even causing rainfall. It has also been suggested that every few tens of millions of years Mars goes through spells of intense volcanic activity, when tremendous quantities of gases and vapours (including water vapour) are sent out from beneath the crust. Quite apart from the dust storms, ice-crystal clouds are found on Mars; they are composed of water ice, and lie at around 10–15 km above the surface. Localized white clouds may be seen anywhere, together with sunrise and sunset fogs and hazes. Because the Martian atmosphere is heated from below, temperatures in the troposphere decrease with altitude, as on Earth; the top of the Martian troposphere lies at about 40 km, with an average temperature lapse rate of 2 . 5 ◦ per km. Above the troposphere comes the mesosphere, where the temperatures become nearly isothermal. The mesosphere extends to about 80 km, and above this comes the excessively tenuous ionosphere, composed of ions and 110 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"M ARS electrons. It extends from about 120 km up to several hundred kilometres; unlike the Earth’s ionosphere it is not shielded from the solar wind by a strong magnetic field. Thin though it is, the Martian ionosphere was used to brake the Global Surveyor space-craft and place it into a virtually circular orbit. P OLAR CAPS The seasonal variations of the polar caps are striking. It is now clear that at each pole there is a residual cap which is overlaid by a seasonal coating of solid carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide condenses out of the atmosphere in the autumn of each hemisphere, producing clouds which accumulate over the poles and preventing us from seeing just how the caps develop. When these ‘hoods’ disperse the caps below are revealed. With the onset of spring and summer, temperatures rise and the seasonal caps disappear, leaving only the permanent residual caps. The caps are not identical, because of the differences in climate between the two hemispheres. The northern seasonal cap is smaller and darker than its counterpart in the south, because it is laid down at a time in the Martian year when the atmosphere contains a large amount of dust; this dust is precipitated on to the surface together with the carbon dioxide, whereas the southern cap is laid down when the atmosphere is much less dust-laden. The northern residual cap is the larger of the two (diameter 1000 km), as against 400 km for the southern cap. The temperatures differ; the residual southern cap is, predictably, the colder of the two, with temperatures going down to below − 130 ◦ C, while temperatures above the residual northern cap have been known to rise to − 68 ◦ C, which is well above the frost point of carbon dioxide and not far from the frost point of water in a thin atmosphere which contains only a small amount of precipitable H 2 O. Finally, there are important differences in composition. The northern residual cap is almost certainly water ice, while the southern is a mixture of water ice and carbon dioxide ice. The thickness of the caps is considerable; recent measures indicate that the depth of thenortherncapisoftheorderof5km. Ithasbeenestimated that if all the water in the atmosphere were condensed it wouldcovertheMartiansurfacewithalayeronly1 / 100mm deep, but the release of all the water in the ice-caps would produce a layer 10 m deep. G ENERAL T OPOGRAPHY There are high peaks and deep valleys on Mars. On Earth, altitudes are reckoned from sea-level, but there are no seas on Mars and it has been agreed to use a datum line where the average atmospheric pressure is 6.2 mbars. This means that all values of altitudes and depressions must be regarded as somewhat arbitrary. The two hemispheres are not alike. Generally speaking, the southern part of the planet is heavily cratered and much of it lies up to 3 km above the datum line; the northern part is lower – mainly below the datum line – and is more lightly cratered, so that it is presumably younger. The very ancient craters which once existed there have been eroded away, and in general the slopes are lower than those in the south. However, the demarcation line does not follow the Martian equator; instead, it is a great circle inclined to the equator at an angle of 35 ◦ . Rather surprisingly, the two deepest basins on Mars, Hellas and Argyre, are in the south; the floor of Hellas is almost5kmbelowthedatumline, Argyreabout3kmbelow. Both are relatively smooth, and both can become brilliant when cloud-filled. The main volcanic area is the Tharsis bulge. This is a crustal upwarp, centred at latitude 14 ◦ S longitude 101 ◦ W; it straddles the demarcation line between the two ‘hemispheres’ and rises to a general altitude of around 9 km. AlongitliethethreegreatvolcanoesofArsiaMons, Pavonis Mons and Ascræus Mons, which are spaced out at intervals of between 650 and 720 km; only Arsia Mons is south of the equator. Olympus Mons lies 1500 km to the west of the main chain, and is truly impressive, with a 600 km base and a complex 80 km caldera. The slopes are fairly gentle (6 ◦ or less); lava flows are much in evidence, and there is an extensive ‘aureole’, made up of blocks and ridges, around the base. It is just over 24 km high – three times the height of our Everest – and is a shield volcano, essentially similar to those of Hawaii, but on a much grander scale. Summit calderæ are also found on Arsia Mons (diameter 110 km), Ascræus Mons (65 km) and Pavonis Mons (45 km). On the northern flank of the Tharsis bulge is the unique Alba Patera, which rises to no more than 3.2 km, but is over 1500 km across, with a central caldera.

Volcanoes there include Elysium Mons, Albor Tholus and Hecates Tholus. Isolated volcanoes are also found elsewhere – for example the Hellas area, as well as near Syrtis Major and Tempe. The ‘tholi’ (domes) are smaller and steeper than the ‘montes’, so that the material from which they formed may have been relatively viscous; like the montes, most of them have summit calderæ. There are also the ‘pateræ’, scalloped, collapsed shields with shallow slopes and complex summit calderæ; some are symmetrical, others less regular, with radial channels running down their flanks. They may be composed of relatively loose material, with ash flows very much in evidence. The altitudes of some of the Martian volcanoes are given in Table 7.10. Plate tectonics do not apply to Mars, so that when a volcano forms over a ‘hot spot’ it remains there for a very long time – which accounts of the great size of the major structures. They are generally assumed to be extinct, although a certain amount of doubt must remain. Some, such as Uranius Tholus and Elysium Mons, seem to be over 2000 million years old, but some of the Tharsis volcanoes may have been active much more recently and Olympus Mons may have last erupted a mere 30 million years ago. Estimated volcano ages are given in Table 7.11. The greatest canyon system is the Valles Marineris, a huge gash in the surface over 4500 km long, with a Table 7.11. Estimated volcano ages.

The Valles Marineris extends eastward toward AuroræPlanum, endingintheblockyterrainnotfarfromthe well-known Margaritifer Terra (once known as Margaritifer Sinus, the Gulf of Pearls). For most of its course it runs roughly parallel to the line of demarcation. Craters abound, all over Mars; many of them have central peaks similar to those of the lunar craters, and the distribution laws are much the same. They have in general been named after astronomers (Table 7.17). There are also featureswhichlooksolikedryriverbedsthattheycanhardly be anything else. There is evidence of past flash-floods, so that some of the old craters have been literally sliced in half. Raging torrents must have carried rocks down into the low-lying areas, and some of the ‘rivers’, such as the Kasei Vallis, are hundreds of kilometres long. S URFACE E VOLUTION Our knowledge of the evolution of the Martian surface is far from complete, but there are several fairly well-defined epochs, listed in Table 7.12. The main bombardment came during the Noachian epoch; cratering declined during the Hesperian, and virtually ceased toward the end of the Amazonian. 112 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"M ARS Table 7.12.

I NTERNAL S TRUCTURE As yet we do not have a complete picture of the structure of Mars, but it is thought that there is an iron-rich core, perhaps 2900 km in diameter, overlaid by a 3500 km mantle and a crust which can hardly be more than around 100 km deep. There is a weak magnetic field, with a strength of no more than 1 / 800 of the Earth’s field, but which nevertheless supports the idea of a core rich in iron; whether this core still acts in the fashion of a dynamo is not clear. The overall field has an orientation similar to that of the Earth, so that in theory a compass needle would point north, but there are localized magnetic anomalies in the crust, so that using a magnetic compass on Mars would be highly unreliable. V IKING L ANDERS; T HE S EARCH F OR L IFE Both Viking landers came down in the red parts of Mars; Viking 1 in Chryse and Viking 2 in the more northerly Utopia. The first picture from Viking 1, taken immediately after touchdown, showed a rockstrewn landscape and the overall impression was that of a barren, rocky desert, with extensive dunes as well as pebbles and boulders. The colour was formed by a thin veneer of red material, probably limonite (hydrated ferric oxide) covering the dark bedrock. The sky was initially said to be salmon-pink, although later picturesmodifiedthistoyellowishpink. Temperatureswere low, ranging between − 96 ◦ C after dawn to a maximum of − 31 ◦ C near noon. Winds were light. They were strongest at about 10 am local time, but even then were no more than 22 km h − 1 breezes; later in the sol they dropped to around 7kmh − 1 ; coming from the southwest rather than the east. The pattern was fairly regular from one sol to the next. The Viking 2 site, in Utopia, was not unlike Chryse, but there were no large boulders, and the rocks looked ‘cleaner’. There were no major craters in sight; the nearest large formation, Mie, was over 200 km to the west. Small and medium rocks were abundant, most of them vesicular. (Vesicles are porous holes, formed as a molten rock cools at or near the surface of a lava flow, so that internal gas bubbles escape.) There were breccias and one good example of a xenolit h – a ‘rock within a rock’ probably formed when a relatively small rock was caught in the path of a lava flow and was coated with a molten envelope which subsequently solidified. The temperatures were very similar to those at Chryse. One main aim of the Viking missions was to search for life. Soon after arrival Viking 1 collected samples by using a scoop, drew them inside the space-craft, analyzed them and transmitted the results to Earth. There were three main experiments: • Pyrolytic Release. Pyrolysis is the breaking up of organic compounds by heat. The experiment was based on the assumption that any Martian life would contain carbon, one species of which, carbon-14, is radioactive, so that when present it is easy to detect. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 113"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"M ARS The sample was heated sufficiently to break up any organic compounds which were present. • Labelled Release. This also involved carbon-14, and assumed that the addition of water to a Martian sample would trigger off biological processes if any organisms were present. • Gas Exchange. It was assumed that any biological activity on Mars would involve the presence of water, and the idea was to see whether providing a sample with suitable nutrients would persuade any organisms to release gases, thereby altering the composition of the artificial atmosphere inside the test chamber. However, the results of all three experiments were inconclusive, and this was also the case when they were repeated from Viking 2. The investigators had to admit that they still could not say definitely whether there was or was not any trace of life on Mars. P ATHFINDER A ND S OJOURNER The next successful lander was Pathfinder, which came down on Mars on 4 July 1997 – America’s Independence Day. This time there was no attempt to make a ‘soft’ landing or to put the space-craft into an initial orbit round Mars. Pathfinder was encased in airbags, and on impact it literally bounced in the manner of a beach-ball. The landing speed was over 90 km h − 1 , and the first bounce sent Pathfinder up to more than 160 m; altogether there were 15 to 17 bounces before the space-craft came to rest inanuprightposition, havingrolledalongforaboutaminute after the final touchdown. On So l 2 – the second day on Mars – the tiny Sojourner rover could emerge, crawling down a ramp on to the Martian surface. Like Viking 1, Pathfinder had landed in Chryse; the distance from the Viking 1 lander was 800 km. On arrival, the main base was renamed the Sagan Memorial Station, in honour of the American astronomer Carl Sagan. The site had been carefully chosen. It lay at the mouth of a large outflow channel, Ares Vallis, which had been carved by a violent flood in the remote past. Ares Vallis had once been a raging torrent of water, and it was thought that rocks of many different types would have been swept down into the area, which did indeed prove to be the case; there was no reasonable doubt that the whole region had once been a flood-plain of standing water. Mars had not always been as arid as it is now. Sojourner itself was a miniature vehicle, 65 cm long by 18 cm high; there were six 13 cm wheels. Sojourner could be guided from Earth, and was able to analyze the surface rocks and make general observations to supplement the panoramic views from the Sagan station. Sojourner could climb over small rocks and skirt round larger ones. As it moved around it left a track in the ‘soil’, exposing the darker material below; the soil itself was finer than talcum powder, and was likened to the fine-grained silt found in regions such as Nebraska in the United States. The soil density was 1.2–2.0 g cm − 3 , much the same as dry soils on Earth. Rock analysis was carried out by an instrument on Sojourner known as the Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer, or APXS for short. It carried a small quantity of radioactive curium-244, which emits alpha-particles (helium nuclei). When Sojourner came up to a rock, the alpha-particles from APXS bombarded the rock; in some cases the particles interacted with the rock and bounced back, while in other cases protons or X-rays were generated. The backscattered alpha-particles, protons and X-rays were counted, and their energies determined. The numbers of particles counted at each energy level gave a clue as to the abundance of the various elements in the rocks and also to the rock types. Most of the rocks were, as expected, volcanic. The first to be examined, because it was nearest to the Sagan Station, was nicknamed Barnacle Bill, because of its outward appearance 2 , and proved to be similar to terrestrial volcanic rocks known as andesites; another rock, Yogi, was basaltic and less rich in silicon. However, several Martian rocks proved to have a higher silicon content than the common basalt, and it was reasoned that the original molten lava must have modestly differentiated, so that the heavy elements such as iron sank to the bottom and the lighter silicon compounds rose to the top of the crust, which was the source of the lavas. There was evidence 2 Nicknames included Hassock, Sausage, Mermaid, Squash, Wedge, Stripe, Souffl ́ e and Desert Princess. Nobody can accuse the NASA teams of being lacking in imagination. Yogi was so named because from some angles it bore a slight resemblance to the celebrated Yogi Bear! 114 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"M ARS of layering or bedding, suggesting a sedimentary origin, and the pebbles and cobbles found in hollows of some of the rocks also suggested conglomerates formed in running water. Windspeeds were light during the operational life of Pathfinder, seldom exceeding 10 m s − 1 . Rather surprisingly, dust devils – miniature tornadoes – were common, although in that tenuous atmosphere they had little force. Ice-crystal clouds were recorded, at altitudes of around 13 km. Altogether, the lander sent back 16 000 images, and 550 were received from Sojourner before the mission ended. The least really good transmission was received on 27 September 1997. There were brief fragmentary signals on 2 and 8 October, but then Pathfinder lost contact – and of course Sojourner no longer had a relay to send data back to Earth. The next US probe, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), entered Mars orbit on 11 September 1997. It was purely an orbiter. The initial orbit round Mars was highly elliptical, but at each closest approach the probe dipped into the upper Martian atmosphere and was slowed by friction, so that successive closest approaches would be lower and lower; thiswouldcontinue, untileventuallyMGSwouldbemoving in a circular path at an altitude of around 400 km above the surface of the planet. Achievement of the final orbit was delayed because of technical problems on the space- craft itself, but the method proved in the end to be very satisfactory. A weak magnetic field (with a strength about 1 / 800 of that of the Earth’s field) was confirmed on 15 September 1997, andbeforelongexcellentimageswerebeingreceived. (One picture, sent back on 5 April 1998, showed a rock which had earlier been imaged by the Viking orbiters, and gave a strange resemblance to a human face, although the MGS images showed, once and for all, that the rock was quite ordinary and the curious appearance had been due to nothing more significant than light and shadow patterns. Another crater, Galle, imaged by MGS, has been nicknamed the ‘Happy Smiling Face’, because of the arrangement of details on its floor.) Views of the canyons in the Noctis Labyrinthus area showed clear evidence of layering; flooded craters were identified, and it was also evident that many of the surface features had been shaped by winds. The polar caps were found to be thick; the northern ice-cap goes down to a depth of at least 5 km, and large areas of it were surprisingly smooth. Another orbiter, Nozomi or ‘Hope’ – Japan’s first attempt at sending a probe to Mars – began its journey on 3 July 1998; then came the US, Mars Climate Orbiter, which would, it was hoped, operate for a full Martian year after entering its final orbit 240 km above the surface of the planet. Unfortunately, two teams were involved in the approach manœuvre; one team was working in Imperial units and the other in Metric. The engine was programmed to fire using thrust data in pounds rather than in Metric newtons. Five minutes after the firing of the orbital insertion engine, the space-craft entered the denser atmosphere, at an altitude 80 to 90 km lower than had been intended – with the result that it either burned up or else crashed on to the surface. It was a blunder which cost 125 million dollars. Mars Polar Lander was launched on 3 January 1999, and was designed to come down on the following 3 December at latitude 76 ◦ S, longitude 195 ◦ W, 800 km from the Martian south pole. It carried microphones, so that it was hoped to pick up actual sounds from Mars. All went well until ten minutes before the scheduled landing on 3 December. Two microprobes (Amundsen and Scott) were released; these were intended to send down penetrators and search for subsurface water. They would impact at over 600 kilimetres per hour, and penetrate to a depth of several metres. Unfortunately no signals were received after landing, either from the main probe or from the microprobes. The cause of this failure is unclear. All these missions are leading up to the dispatch of a sample-and-return probe, which will bring Martian samples back to Earth for analysis. Then, and only then, will we know whether Mars is sterile. Lowly organisms may well exist perhaps below ground level, but one thing is certain on Mars; there can be no life as advanced as a blade of grass. At least we already have good maps of the entire Martian surface. A selected list of formations is given in Table 7.16.

It has been claimed that certain meteorites, known as SNC meteorites (because the first three to be identified came from Shergotty in India, Nakhla in Egypt and Chassigny in France) are of Martian origin. Of special note is the meteorite ALH 84001, found in the Allan Hills of Antarctica. It is shaped rather like a potato, and measures 15 cm × 10 cm × 7 . 6 cm; when found, it was covered with a fusion crust made of black glass. Its age seems to be around 4.5 thousand million years. Claims for a Martian origin have also been made for other SNC meteorites; a list is given in Table 7.13. Careful examination of ALH 84001 showed the presence of tiny features which some investigators regarded as being due to primitive forms of microscopic life. They were moreover accompanied by certain minerals which sometimes accompany microbacteria on Earth. These features were however very small indeed; the largest of them was no more than 500 nm long (1 nm is one thousand- millionth of a metre), and the general opinion at present is that they are either inorganic or are due to terrestrial contamination. On the ‘Martian’ theory, ALH 84001 was blasted away from Mars about 16 000 000 years ago by a violent impact. It could not have been put initially into an Earth-crossing path, but entered an orbit around the Sun. At first this orbit was similar to that of Mars itself, and there were various encounters; finally the two bodies separated, and ALH 84001 continued in its own orbit, until by chance it encountered the Earth. About 13 000 years ago it plumped conveniently down in Antarctica, where the meteorite collectors found it. This may or may not be the true picture. Whether or not the SNC meteorites really come from Mars remains an intriguing possibility, but it certainly cannot be regarded as definitely proved. T HE S ATELLITES O F M ARS Mars has two dwarf satellites, Phobos and Deimos, named after the attendants of the mythological war god. The first mention of possible Martian satellites was fictional – by Jonathan Swift, in Gulliver’s Voyage to Laputa (1727), Swift described two satellites, one of which had a revolution period shorter than the rotation period of its primary, but at that time there was no telescope which could have shown either Phobos or Deimos. Two satellites werealsodescribedinanothernovel, Voltaire’s Microm ́ egas (1750). The reasoning was, apparently, that since Earth had 116 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"M ARS one satellite and Jupiter was known to have four, Mars could not possibly manage with less than two! A satellite reported telescopically in 1645 by A. Schyrle was certainly nothing more than a faint star. The first systematic search for satellites was made in 1783 by William Herschel. The result was negative, and H. D’Arrest, from Copenhagen, in 1862 and 1864, was similarly unsuccessful. The first satellite to be discovered was Deimos, by Asaph Hall at Washington on 10 August 1877, using the 66 cm Clark refractor at Washington. On 16 August he discovered Phobos. The names of the satellites were suggested to Hall by Mr. Madan of Eton. Both are decidedly elusive, because of their small size and their closeness to Mars. Data are given in Table 7.14. E. M. Antoniadi, using the 83 cm Meudon refractor in 1930, reported that Phobos was white and Deimos bluish, but these results were certainly spurious. Much more recently – in 1952, 1954 and 1956 – G. P. Kuiper, using the McDonald 208 cm reflector, made a careful search and concluded – rightly – that no new satellite as much as a kilometre across could exist. The origin of the satellites is not certainly known. It is tempting to believe that they are ex-asteroids, which were captured by Mars long ago, and certainly they do seem to be similar in nature to the asteroids which have been surveyed from close range by space probes – although it is true that the capture would involve some very special circumstances. Note, however, that there is one asteroid, 647 Eureka, which is a Martian ‘Trojan’ and moves in the same orbit as Mars, although it keeps well clear of the planet and is in no danger of collision. Tidal effects indicate that the orbit of Phobos is slowly shrinking, so that the satellite may impact Mars at some time between 30 and 100 million years in the future. Deimos, however, is in a stable path and will not suffer a similar fate. Neither satellite would be of much use in lighting up the Martian nights. Moreover, Phobos would be invisible to any observer on the planet above latitude 69 ◦ north or south; for Deimos the limiting latitude would be 82 ◦ . To a Martian observer, Phobos would appear less than half the diameter of the Moon as seen from Earth, and would give only about as much light as Venus does to us; from Phobos, Mars would subtend a mean angle of 42 ◦ . The maximum apparent diameter of Deimos as seen from Mars would be only about twice that of Venus seen from Earth, and with the naked eye the phases would be almost imperceptible. Deimos would remain above the Martian horizon for 2 1 2 sols consecutively; Phobos would cross the sky in only 4 1 2 h, moving from west to east, and the interval between successive risings would be a mere 11 h. Total solar eclipses could never occur. Phobos would transit the Sun 1300 times a year, taking 19 s to cross the disk, while Deimos would show an average of 130 transits, each taking 1 min 48 s. To an observer on Mars, eclipses of the satellites by the shadow of the planet would be very frequent. Predictably, both Phobos and Deimos have syn- chronous rotation periods. This leads to great ranges in temperature, particularly in the case of Phobos. During its 7 1 2 hour ‘day’ the temperature may rise to − 4 ◦ C, while at night it falls to − 112 ◦ C. There will, of course, be pro- nounced libration effects. The satellites are irregular in shape; the first proof of this was obtained in 1969, when Mariner 7 photographed the shadow cast by Phobos on Mars and showed it to be elliptical. The first accurate size measurements were made by Mariner 9 in 1971–2; the craters on their surfaces were also first recorded from Mariner 9. The best views so far have come from Mars Global Surveyor. Earlier, in 1988, the Russians launched two probes with the intention of making controlled landings on Phobos, but both failed. Both satellites have low albedoes, of the order of 5%. Phobos shows one major crater, Stickney, which is 9.6 km in diameter; the impact which produced it must have come close to shattering Phobos completely. Grooves extending across the surface from Stickney appear to be surface fractures caused by the impact; near the crater, the grooves are around 700 m across and 90 m deep, although further away from the crater the widths and depths are more of the order of 100–200 m and 10–20 m, respectively. Surface details of the satellites are given in Table 7.15. The wide temperature range on Phobos gives a clue as to the composition of its surface. The upper regolith must be made up of finely-ground powder at leas t1mdeep–it THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 117"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"M ARS Figure 7.1. Deimos. Figure 7.2. Phobos. has been said that an astronaut would find himself ‘hip-deep in dust’. The surface has been pounded by constant impacts of meteroids, some of which have started landslides leaving dark trails marking the steep slopes of the main craters. This is particularly evident in Stickney, where boulders on the rim measure up to 50 m across; rocks rolling down the slopes have left obvious tracks, showing that the gravity on Phobos, weak though it may be, is not inappreciable. The gravity field has about 1 / 1000 the strength of that of the Earth at sea-level. Deimos, with its gravity field only about 1 / 3000 of that of the Earth, has a more subdued surface; the largest crater, Voltaire, is less than 3 km in diameter, though it has been suggested that an 11 km wide depression near the south pole may be an impact scar. There are nearly as many craters per unit area as there are on Phobos, but those of Deimos have been more eroded and filled in. As an aside: in 1959 the eminent Russian astronomer Iosif Shklovsky published a paper in which he claimed that because Phobos was being ‘braked’ by the upper limits of 118 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"M ARS Table 7.14.

Most of them occupy the ‘Main Belt’, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The first asteroid, Ceres, was discovered in 1801, and three others (Pallas, Juno and Vesta) were found between 1801 and 1807. These are known popularly as ‘the Big Four’, although in fact Juno is not even among the dozen largest asteroids. Of the entire swarm, only 3 Vesta is visible with the naked eye. D ISCOVERY A systematic search for a planet orbiting between the paths of Mars and Jupiter was initiated in 1800 by six astronomers meeting at Lilienthal, where Johann Schr ̈ oter had his observatory. They based their search on Bode’s law (actually first described by J. Titius of Wittemberg, but popularized by J. E. Bode in 1772). The law may be summed up as follows: Take the numbers 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192 and 384, each of which (apart from the first) is double its predecessor. Add 4 to each. Taking the Earth’s distance from the Sun as 10 units, the remaining figures give the mean distances of the planets with reasonable accuracy out to as far as Saturn, the outermost planet known in 1772. Uranus, discovered in 1781, fits in well. Neptune and Pluto do not, but these planets were not discovered until many years later. Bode’s law is given in Table 8.1. It is now believed that the ‘law’ is nothing more than a coincidence; it fails completely for Neptune, the third most massive planet in the Solar System, and also for Pluto which admittedly does not appear to be worthy of true planetary status. However, it was enough for the ‘Celestial Police’ to begin a hunt for a planet corresponding to the Bode number 28. Schr ̈ oter became President of the association; the secretary was the Hungarian astronomer Baron Franz Xavier von Zach. They very logically concentrated their searches in the region of the ecliptic. Ceres was discovered on 1 January 1801, the first day of the new century, by G. Piazzi from Palermo. (He was working on a new star catalogue and was not a member of Table 8.1. Bode’s law. Distance by Actual Planet Bode’s law distance Mercury 4 3.9 Venus 7 7.2 Earth 10 10.0 Mars 16 15.2 —28 — Jupiter 52 52.0 Saturn 100 95.4 Uranus 196 191.8 Neptune — 300.7 Pluto 388 394.6 the ‘Police’, although he joined later.) Ceres was found to have a Bode distance of 27.7. Pallas, Juno and Vesta were identified by the time that the ‘Police’ disbanded in 1813; the fifth, Astræa, was not found until 1845, as the result of painstaking searches by a German amateur, K. Hencke. Data for the first four asteroids are given in Table 8.2. Since 1847 no year has passed without the discovery of at least one new asteroid. By 1868, 100 were known. by 1921 the number had risen to 1000; by 1946, to 2000; by 1985, to 3000; and by 1999 to over 10 000. These are the ‘numbered’ asteroids; many others – around 50 000 – have been seen, but have not been observed sufficiently for orbits to be calculated. The total number of asteroids must be at least 70 000, but the combined mass is only about 0.04% of the mass of the Earth or 3% of the mass of the Moon. Ceres is the giant of the asteroid swarm; all the rest of the main belt asteroids make up only about 1.5 times the mass of Ceres, and Ceres, Pallas and Vesta combined make up 55% of the total mass of the asteroid swarm making up the main belt. The first asteroid to be discovered photographically was 323 Brucia, on 20 December 1891, by Max Wolf.

The Kle ˇ t Observatory, in the Czech Republic, is concerned entirely with asteroids. N OMENCLATURE When an asteroid is found, it is given a provisional designation, such as 1999 CE. The first four characters give the year of discovery; the fifth, the time of year reckoned in two-week periods in an alphabetical sequence – A the first two weeks in January, B the second two weeks in January, C the first two weeks in February and so on (I is omitted); the fifth character indicates the order of discovery. Thus 1999 CE indicates that the asteroid was the fifth to be discovered during the second half of February. If a month has over 24 discoveries, a subscript is added; thus the 25th asteroid to be found during the first half of February 1999 is 1999 CA 1 . When a reliable orbit has been worked out, the asteroid is assigned a number. Data for the first hundred known asteroids are given in Table 8.3 and a selected list of data for other interesting asteroids is given in Table 8.4. The discoverer of an asteroid is entitled to suggest a name, and this recommendation is almost always accepted by the International Astronomical Union. The first asteroid tobenamedwas1Ceres, discoveredbyPiazzifromPalermo and named by him after the patron goddess of Sicily. All early names were mythological, but when the supply of deities became exhausted more ‘modern’ names were introduced, some of them decidedly bizarre; the first was that of 125 Liberatrix, which seems to have been given by the discoverer, P. M. Henry of Paris, in honour of Joan of Arc. Asteroids may be named after countries (136 Austria, 1125 China, 1197 Rhodesia) and people (1123 Shapleya, after Dr. Harlow Shapley; 1462 Zamenhof, after the inventor of Esperanto; 1486 Marilyn, after the daughter of Paul Herget, Director of the Cincinnati Observatory. (I feel very honoured that 2602 Moore, discovered by E. Bowell from Flagstaff in Arizona, was named by him after me!) The first asteroid to be named after an electronic calculator is 1625 The NORC – the Naval Ordnance Research Calculator at Dahlgre, Virginia. Plants are represented (978 Petunia, 973 Aralia), as are universities (694 Ekard – ‘Drake’ spelled backwards), musical plays (1047 Geisha), foods (518 Halawe – the discoverer, R. S. Dugan, was particularly fond of the Arabian sweet halawe ), social clubs (274 Philagori a – a club in Vienna) and shipping lines (724 Hapag–Hamburg–Amerika line). One name has been expunged; 1267 was named Vladimirov in honour of a Soviet philanthropist, Anatoli Vladimirov, but was withdrawn when Vladimirov was exposed as a financial swindler. One name was auctioned: 250 Bettina, whose discoverer, Palisa, offered to sell his right of naming for £ 50. The offer was accepted by Baron Albert von Rothschild, who named the asteroid after his wife. Names of politicians and military leaders are in general not allowed, although we do have 1581 Abanderada – someone who carries a banner – associated with Eva Per ́ on, wife of the former ruler of Argentina. Asteroid 1000 is, appropriately enough, named Piazzia. (My own favourite names are 2309 Mr. Spock, named after a ginger cat which was itself named after the Vulcanian space-traveller in the fictional starship Enterprise , and 6042 Cheshirecat!) 719 Albert was discovered in 1911, and then lost. It was finally recovered in 2000, so that no numbered asteroids are now unaccounted for. Asteroid 330, Adalberta, never existed at all; it was recorded by Max Wolf in 1892, but was photographed only twice, and it was then found that the images were of two separate stars.

It was discovered by K. Reinmuth, from Heidelberg, by-passing the Earth at only 800 000 km on 28 October 1937; it reached the eighth magnitude, and moved at 5 ◦ per hour, so that it crossed the sky in nine days. It has not been seen again and its recovery will be a matter of luck. It was, of course, well away from the main swarm. In recent years asteroid-hunting has become a popular pastime, among amateurs as well as professionals. For example, the British amateur Brian Manning now has five numbered asteroids to his credit. Several 19th-century astronomers were particularly prolific; thus K. Reinmuth discovered 246 asteroids, Max Wolf 232 and J. Palisa 121. A STEROID O RBITS Asteroid orbits are of several definite types. • Main Belt . These orbits lie between those of Mars and Jupiter. • Near-Earth Asteroids (NEA) (a) Aten class; average distance from the Sun less than 1 a.u., although some may cross the Earth’s orbit. All Atens are very small, and no doubt there are a great many of them. (b) Apollo class; average distance from the Sun over 1 a.u., but orbits do cross that of the Earth. (c) Amor class; orbits cross that of Mars but not that of the Earth. Asteroid 251, Lick, has an orbit lying entirely between those of the Earth and Mars; its period is 1.63 years and the orbital inclination is over 39 ◦ . • Trojans . These move in orbits which are the same as that of Jupiter, although they are on average either 60 ◦ ahead of (L4) or 60 ◦ behind (L5) of Jupiter, and are in no danger of being engulfed. There is one known Mars Trojan, 5261 Eureka, discovered on 20 June 1990 by H. E. Holt and D. H. Levy. It is very small, with a diameter of no more than 3 km. No doubt other Martian Trojans exist, but their faintness must make them very difficult objects. No Trojan type asteroids have been found in the orbits of Mercury, Venus or the Earth. • Centaurs . These lie well beyond the main belt and beyond the orbit of Jupiter; their average distances from the Sun lie between the orbits of Jupiter and Neptune. • Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) . Orbits close to or beyond that of Neptune. Most are small, with diameters of a few hundred kilometres, but it is now widely believed that Pluto is a KBO rather than a true planet.

Such is 1996 TL 66 , discovered by Jane Luu and her colleagues in October 1966. Assuming that it has a darkish surface, it must be around 500 km in diameter. When found it seems to have been close to its perihelion, but the orbit is highly eccentric and the aphelion distance may be as much as 170 a.u. It is possible that 1996 PW, discovered by E. Helin on 9 August 1996, may be even more extreme, with a period of 5800 years and an aphelion distance of 645 a.u. – almost 100 000 million km; the diameter is probably about 10 km. These curious bodies may well bridge the gap between the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud of comets, and indeed the distinction between the various small members of the Solar System seems to be blurred. 1996 TL 66 and 1996 PW look like asteroids, but their orbits are cometary. On the other hand, Comet Wilson–Harrington, first seen in 1951 and which had a perceptible tail, was lost for many years and recovered in 1979, this time in the guise of an asteroid; it has been given an asteroid number, 4015, and now shows no sign of cometary activity. Comet 133P/Elst– Pizarro, discovered in August 1996, also has a tail, but moves entirely within the main asteroid belt and has been given an asteroid number, 7968. The NEA asteroid 3200 Phæthon, discovered on 11 December 1983 from the IRAS satellite, has an orbit so like that of the Geminid meteor stream that it could be the ‘parent’ of that stream – in which case Phæthon is an ex-comet which has lost all its volatiles. Even more significant perhaps is 2060 Chiron, which was the first Centaur to be discovered and which moves mainly between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus. It is around 180 km in diameter, and though it looked asteroidal when discovered it has since shown comet-like activity. It appears to be much too large to be classed as a comet, but its true nature remains unclear, and it may not be unique. All in all, the relationships between various types of objects seem 134 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"T HE M INOR P LANETS to be much more complicated than was thought until very recently. T YPES O F A STEROIDS Asteroids are divided into various types according to their physical and surface characteristics. The main classes are as follows. • C (carbonaceous) . These are the most numerous, increasing in number from 10% at a distance of 2.2 a.u. up to 80% at 3 a.u. They are of low albedo – often below 5%, darker than coal – and have flat, featureless spectra, similar to those of carbonaceous chondrites. Ceres, the largest asteroid, is of type C. • S (silicaceous) . These are most numerous in the inner part of the main zone, making up 60% of the total at 2.2 a.u., but only 15% at 3 a.u. Their albedoes are in the range 15–25%, and they seem to resemble the metal-bearing meteorites known as chrondites; generally they are reddish . Prominent S-type asteroids include 3 Juno and 5 Astræa. • M (metallic) . Moderate albedoes, and may be the metal-richcoresoflarger‘parentasteroids’whichhave been broken up by collision. 16 Psyche is almost pure nickel–iron alloy in composition. • E (enstatite) . Relatively rare; high albedoes, some- times over 40%. They may resemble some types of chondrites, inwhichenstatite(MgSiO 3 )isamajorcon- stituent. 214 Aschera, 434 Hungaria and 1025 Riema are of this type. • D . Low albedo; reddish. Their surfaces seem to be 90% clays, with magnetite and carbon-rich substances. Most of the D-type asteroids are remote from the Sun, including many Trojans, but there are also a few in the main belt, including 336 Lacadiera and 361 Bononia. The largest D-type asteroid is 704 Interamnia. • A . Almost pure olivine. The best examples are 246 Asporina, 329 Nenetta and 446 Æternitas. • P . Dark and reddish; not unlike type D. • Q . Sometimes used for NEA asteroids; in composition they seem to resemble chrondites (see the chapter on Meteorites). • V . Igneous rock surfaces. Very rare; 4 Vesta is the only large example. • U . Asteroids which are regarded as unclassifiable. For example, 2201 Oljato, discovered in 1947 by H. Giclas and recovered in 1979 by E. Helin, has a spectrum unlike any other in the Solar System. Its diameter is no more than 3 km; it shows no trace of cometary activity. Other classes sometimes used are B (similar to C, but slightly brighter and more neutral in colour), F (neutral in colour), G (C-like, but brighter), T (reddish, intermediate between D and S) and R (like S, but with greater indications of olivine in their spectra). There was also the extraordinary object discovered on 5 December 1991 by J. V. Scotti, who was carrying out a routine patrol with the 0m.9 Spacewatch telescope. It passed within 460 000 km of the Earth, and varied in brightness; the estimated diameter was a mere 6 m. The orbital inclination was 0 ◦ . 4, and the period only slightly longer than that of the Earth. It was given an asteroidal designation, 1991 VG, but is widely believed to have been a piece of man-made satellite d ́ ebris rather than an asteroid. It has not been seen again, and is unlikely to be recovered. M AIN- B ELT A STEROIDS Ceres is the giant of the swarm; it is the only asteroid more than600kmindiameter, andoftherestonly2Pallas, 4Vesta and 10 Hygeia are over 400 km across. The largest and brightest asteroids are listed in Table 8.5. Several main- belt asteroids have been contacted by radar – initially 16 Psyche and 33 Klotho, with the Arecibo radio telescope in 1981 – and several, including 950 Gaspra, 243 Ida and 55 Mathilde, have been surveyed from close range by space- craft from 1991. It is generally assumed that no large planet could form in this region of the Solar System because of the power- ful disruptive influence of Jupiter. Gaps in the main zone were predicted by D. Kirkwood in 1857, and confirmed in 1866; they too are due to the gravitational influence of Jupiter. For example, the Hilda asteroids have periods of approximately two-thirds that of Jupiter, so that the per- turbations are cumulative. There are distinct ‘families’ of asteroids, whose members probably have a common ori- gin in the disruption of a larger body. They are sometimes THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 135"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"T HE M INOR P LANETS Table 8.5. (a) The largest asteroids. (This does not include Centaurs and trans-Neptunians.)

Hirayama in 1918. The main families are listed in Table 8.6. Outside the most remote family (Hilda) is 279 Thule, of type D; its diameter is 130 km and its period 8.8 years. It may be said to mark the outpost of the main swarm, and could be one of several at about the same dis- tance, but Thule itself is large by asteroidal standards, and smaller members would certainly be faint and difficult to identify. The orbits of main-belt asteroids show a wide range of inclinations; for example 52 ◦ . 0 for 1580 Betulia, only 0 ◦ . 014 for 1383 Limburgia. Pallas, the second largest asteroid, has an inclination of almost 35 ◦ . Some orbits are almost circular; thus for 311 Claudia the eccentricity is only 0.0031, and for 903 Neally it is 0.0039. Mutual perturbations are measurable; thus the mass of Vesta was determined largely by its effects upon the movements of 197 Arete, an S-type asteroid 42 km in diameter and therefore very much smaller and less massive than Vesta. Ordinary telescopes show asteroids as nothing more than dots of light, but surface details have now been mapped on some of them. Ceres, imaged in January 1998 with the NASA Infra-red Facilit y 3 m telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, proved to be slightly football-shaped rather than perfectly spherical, with a more varied surface than had been expected. Vesta has been mapped with the Hubble Space Telescope, and has proved to be the most geologicallydiverseofthemainasteroids. Thereareancient lava flows; ground-based spectroscopy had already shown that there were basaltic regions, and it follows that the asteroid once had a molten interior. There are two distinct hemispheres, containing different types of solidified lava, and there is one huge impact crater, over 300 km across, with a central peak almost 13 km high. One side of the asteroid has what may be called quenched lava flows, while the other has characteristics of molten rock that cooled and solidified underground, being subsequently exposed by impacts. It has been suggested that Vesta may be the source of the eucrite meteorites which have fallen on Earth, although there is certainly no proof. It has also been suggested, again without proof, that the 3 km asteroid 9969 Braille may be a broken-off part of Vesta; on 29 July 1999 Braille was imaged from close range by the probe Deep Space 1, which had been launched on 24 October 1998. Vesta has a rotation period of 5.3 h. Other main-belt asteroids spin at different speeds; the period is only 2 h 136 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"T HE M INOR P LANETS Figure 8.1. Vesta. (Courtesy: NASA.) 52 min for 321 Florentina, as much as 1500 h for 288 Glauke (although it has been suggested that Glauke may be a binary asteroid rather than a single slow-rotation body). Rotation rates for other asteroids may be obtained from their variations in brightness; thus 1864 Daedalus changes by 0.9 magnitude over a period o f8h34 min, while 1226 Crocus also varies by 0.9 magnitude, although in the longer period of 3.07 days. The first three main-belt asteroids to be surveyed by space-craft were 951 Gaspra (13 November 1991), 243 Ida (28 August 1993) and 253 Mathilde (27 June 1997) – the first two by the Galileo probe en route for Jupiter and the third by the NEAR (Shoemaker) probe making for Eros. They proved to be very different from each other. Gaspra, imaged from a range of 16 000 km, proved to be wedge-shaped (not unlike a distorted potato) with a darkish, rocky surface pitted with craters. There were also indications of three areas from which pieces had been broken off, so that Gaspra may well be the survivor from a series of major collisions; it is small, measuring 19 km × 12 km × 11 km. Craters on it have been named after famous spas such as Bath, Aix and Rotorua. Surprisingly, there were magnetic effects strong enough to create a ‘bubble’ in the solar wind. Some named features are listed in Table 8.7. IdaislargerthanGaspra(58km × 23km)andisheavily cratered; many of these are larger than craters on Gaspra. Ida is a member of the Koronis family, with a rotation period of 4.6 h; like Gaspra it is of type S and is reddish, so that it is presumably composed of a mixture of pyroxene, olivine and iron minerals. It was found to have a tiny satellite, now named Dactyl, measuring 1 . 2km × 1 . 4km × 1 . 6 km, orbiting at a distance of about 100 km from Ida’s centre.

Members include 434 Hungaria, 1103 Sequoia and 1025 Riema. Hungaria is 11.4 km in diameter; most of the rest are much smaller. Flora 2.2 Most populous family; well over 150 members. Most are reddish. 8 Flora itself is of type S, 162 km in diameter and is virtually spherical. Maria 2.25 Separated from the main belt by inclinations of around 15 ◦ . Most members are of type S, including 170 Maria itself, which is 40 km in diameter. Phocæa 2.4 Rather ill-defined. 25 Phocæa is of type S, with a diameter of 72 km. Koronis 2.8–2.9 The only rich family with low inclination and low eccentricity; about 60 members. Almost all are of type S. 158 Koronis has a diameter of 36 km. Budrosa 2.9 Only 6 members; inclinations about 6 ◦ . 338 Budrosa, diameter 80 km, is of type M; most of the others have to be classified as U.

Hilda 4.0 In the outer region; over 30 members mainly of classes P, C and D. 153 Hilda is 222 km in diameter, and of type P. different materials. The largest crater is Afon, named after a Russian cave. Mathilde proved to be surprising. It measured 66 km × 4 . 8km × 46 km, but is very irregular in outline and is cratered; the largest crater is 30 km across. The albedo is only 3%, so that Mathilde is as black as charcoal; the surface may consist of carbon-rich material which has not been altered by planet-building processes. The mean density is only 1.3 g cm − 2 . Fittingly, the craters are to be named after famous coal mines! The rotation period is very long indeed: 417.7 h, over 17 days. Clearly Mathilde has had a tortured history; it was even claimed that ‘there are more huge craters than there is asteroid’. In1998astronomersusingtheCanada–France–Hawaii 3.58 m telescope on Mauna Kea discovered a satellite of asteroid 45 Eugenia; the team was led by W. Merline. The satellite orbits Eugenia at a distance of 1200 km; the orbital inclination is 45 degrees. The satellite is 13 km in diameter. A satellite of asteroid 3671 Dionysus has been suspected, but not yet confirmed. In 1999 astronomers using the 3.6 m reflector at La Silla (Chile) found that asteroid 216 Kleopatra is a bifurcated shape with two lobes of similar size, 217 × 93 km; the separation was given as 0 \u0002\u0002 . 125.

These asteroids cross the orbit of Mars, but not that of the Earth. (1951 Lick is the only Amor to remain wholly in the region between the orbits of Earth and Mars.) The first to be discovered was 433 Eros, by Witt, from Berlin, in 1898; it was also the first asteroid to be given a masculine name. To be precise, 132 Æthra can theoretically approach the Sun to within the orbit of Mars (its perihelion distance is 1.61 a.u., and the aphelion distance of Mars is 1.67 a.u., but Æthra is not usually regarded as an Amor). Eros can approach the Earth to a distance of 23 000 000 km, as it did in 1931. Its position was then intensively studied in an attempt to improve our knowledge of the length of the astronomical unit, although the final value, derived by H. Spencer Jones, is now known to have been rather too great. The last close approach was in 1975. Eros can then reach magnitude 8.3, but generally it is a very faint object. On 23 December 1998 it was surveyed from a range of 4100 km by the NEAR space-craft, subsequently named in honour of the American planetary geologist E. M. Shoemaker. On 14 February 2000, at a distance of 256 000 km from the Earth and 1800 km from Eros, the Shoemaker probe entered an orbit round Eros at a range of 327 km, and began a long-term programme of mapping. Craters are numerous; features down to 180 m in diameter have been recorded. There is one very prominent sharp-rimmed crater associated with a huge, hollowed-out gorge. The shape of the asteroid itself is rather reminiscent of a banana. A selected list of Amor asteroids is given in Table 8.10. Apollo type . These cross the orbits of Mars, the Earth and in many cases Venus; a few also cross the orbit of Mercury. However, many of them have high inclinations (for example, well over 60 ◦ in the case of 2102 Tantalus). A selected list of Apollos is given in Table 8.11. Over 100 are now known, and there may be at least 1000 of them with diameters of 1 km or over. 1862 Apollo was the first to be discovered, by K. Reinmuth in 1932. It was then lost for many years, but was recovered in 1973, and its orbit is now well known. In 1950 it passed Venus at a range of 0.01 a.u.; it came within 0.07 a.u. of Venus in 1968, and within 0.05 a.u. of Mars in 1946. Discovered, in 1932, it was 0.07 a.u. from the Earth.

It makes periodical fairly close approaches and there were popular reports that it ranks as a minor Earth satellite. This is, of course, incorrect; it is an ordinary asteroid in orbit round the Sun, although admittedly its mean distance from the Sun is very nearly the same as that of the Earth. (It is not, however, moving in the Earth’s orbit, because its path is much more eccentric than ours.) THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 139"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"T HE M INOR P LANETS Table 8.9. Asteroid diameters and absolute magnitude.The diameter of an asteroid is linked to its absolute magnitude, H . In this table, the diameter is given in kilometres when H is in the left-hand column and in metres when H is to the right. Thus H = 7 . 0 gives a diameter of 110–240 km, while H = 26 . 0 gives 17–37 m. There is bound to be some uncertainty, because asteroids have a wide range of albedoes, and for small bodies the albedoes are not known precisely.

Gehrels and J. Larsen, using the 0m.9 Spacewatch telescope, discovered asteroid 1998 KY 26 . It was then of magnitude 19. A week later it passed the Earth at 806 000 km, and was imaged by radar; predictably, its surface was cratered. The diameter of the asteroid is about 3 0 m – and the rotation period is 10.7 minutes, much the fastest known. An observer on the surface would see a sunrise or sunset every 5 minutes – each lasting for no more than a second! It seems to be of the carbonaceous chondrite type, and it must be a single object; if it were a ‘rubble pile’ the quick rotation would disrupt it. On 13 May 1999 the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) team discovered asteroid 1999 JM 8 , which is 3.5 km in diameter – large for a near-Earth object. In July 1999 it passed Earth at 8500 000 km, and was imaged by radar; it proved to be heavily cratered. It has a slow rotation period of the order of one week. The first asteroid found to approach the Sun to within the orbit of Mercury was 1566 Icarus, discovered by W. Baade in 1949. It has a period of 409 days and can approach the Sun to a distance of 28 000 000 km, so that its surface temperature must then be in the region of 500 ◦ C; it has a very eccentric orbit and at aphelion recedes well beyond the path of the Earth, so that it must have a very extreme climate. The next asteroid found to invade these torrid regions was 3200 Phæthon, discovered in 1983 by J. Davis and S. Green, from data supplied by the IRAS satellite. Phæthon is about 5 km in diameter (much larger than Icarus); its distance from the Sun ranges between 21 000 000 km and 390 000 000 km. It is darkish, with an estimated rotation period of 4 h. Other asteroids which pass close to the Sun are 5786 Talos (to 0.187 km), 1989 VA (0.295a.u.) 1990UO(1.298a.u.) and1991VE(0.299a.u.). 1620 Geographos is the most elongated object known in the Solar System. It is 5.1 km long and only 1.8 km broad. 4769 Castalia is dumbbell-shaped, about 1.8 km across at its widest; its two distinct lobes are each 0.75 km across and there is a narrow waist about 125 m long. The two lobes were probably separate objects which came together after a gentle collision. Another compound asteroid is 4179 Toutatis, discovered on 4 January 1989 by C. Pollas on photographic plates taken on the 0.9 m Schmidt telescope at Caussols, France, by A. Maury and D. Mulholland during astrometric observations of the faint outer satellites of Jupiter. Toutatis is about 4.6 km long, dominated by two components in contact, one twice as large as the other. It is not certain whether the components are actually separatedorarejoinedbyaverynarrow‘neck’. Therotation is extraordinary and chaotic. Radar images have been obtained, andcratershavebeenrevealed.

It oscillated around the Lagrangian point, 60 ◦ ahead of Jupiter. Other members of the group were then found, some 60 ◦ E and others at the second Lagrangian point, 60 ◦ W; they were named after the participants in the Trojan War. They oscillate around their Lagrangian points, and some move from about 45 ◦ from Jupiter out to 80 ◦ and then back again. By asteroidal standards they are large, but their great distance means that they are faint. The senior member of the swarm is 624 Hektor, which seems to be cylindrical and to measure 300 km by 150 km; its magnitude varies over a range of 1.1 magnitudes in a period of 6.923 h, which is presumably the rotation period. It is even possible that Hektor, like the much smaller Toutatis, is a contact binary asteroid. Several hundreds of Jupiter Trojans are now known. A selected list is given in Table 8.15. Details of the one known Martian Trojan (5261 Eureka) are also given in Table 8.15. H IDALGO A ND D AMOCLES On 31 October 1920 W. Baade discovered asteroid 944 Hi- dalgo, which proved to have an unusual orbit. It travels from the inner edge of the asteroid belt, at 2.0 a.u., out to 9.7 a.u., just beyond the orbit of Saturn; the eccentricity is 0.66 and the inclination 42 ◦ . It seems to be of type D, and magnitude variations indicate a rotation period of 10 hours. The diam- eter is probably about 50 km. The orbit appears cometary, but despite careful scrutiny Hidalgo has never been known to show comet-like activity. The period is 14.15 years. Another asteroid which ranges far out into the Solar System is 5335 Damocles; it moves from 1.6 a.u. out to 22.2 a.u. in a period of 40.9 years, so that its orbit crosses those of Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. However, the high inclination (60 . 9 ◦ ) means that it is safe from collision at the present epoch. It is very small – no more than about 15 km in diameter. C ENTAURS On 1 November 1977 C. Kowal, using the Schmidt telescope at Palomar, discovered the remarkable object 2060 Chiron. Its path lies mainly between those of Saturn Table 8.16. Chiron. Designation: Asteroid 2060, cometary designation 95/P. Perihelion date: 1996 Feb 14, 18.06 UT. Perihelion distance: 8.463 0422 a.u. Aphelion distance: 18.943 14 a.u. Orbital period: 50.7 years. Eccentricity: 0.3831. Inclination: 6.935 degrees. Mass: 2 × 10 19 to 2 × 10 19 g. Rotation period: 5.9 hours. Diameter: 148 to 208 km. Discoverer: C. Kowal, 1977 Nov 1 (on a plate taken 18 October). and Uranus. At perihelion (as on 14 February 1996) it comes to within 1278 million km of the Sun, and about one-sixth of its orbit lies within that of Saturn, but at aphelion it recedes to 2827 million km, greater than the minimum distance between the Sun and Uranus. The period is 50.9 years. The orbit is unstable over a time scale of some millions of years. In 1664 BC Chiron approached Saturn to a distance of 16 000 000 km, which is not much greater than the distance between Saturn and its outermost satellite, Phœbe, which is almost certainly a captured asteroid. At discovery the magnitude was 18, but atperihelionitroseto15. Light-curvestudiesgivearotation period of just under 6 h. Estimates of the diameter range from 148 to over 200 km. Chiron’s image can be traced back on plates taken as long ago as 1895, so that its orbit is very well known. Preliminary spectroscopic results indicated a fairly low albedo with a dusty or rocky surface, but there was a major surprise in 1988, when Chiron was found to be brightening – not spectacularly, but appreciably. Inevitably there were suggestions that it might be a huge comet rather than an asteroid, and this idea was strengthened in April 1990, when K. Meech and J. S. Belton, using electronic equipment on th e 4 m reflector at Kitt Peak in Arizona, photographed Chiron and found that it appeared to be ‘fuzzy’; in other words, it had developed a coma.

Jewitt and J. X. Luu found that the coma extended for 80 000 km and was elongated away from the Sun in comet-like fashion. The ejected material was thought to be vaporized carbon monoxide carrying away dust grains. Thisiscertainlycomet-likebehaviour, andonoccasion the diameter of the coma has been known to reach almost 2000 000 km; the brightness can vary by a factor of four over a few hours, and a gravitationally-bound ‘dust atmosphere’ appears to be suspended in the inner 1200 km of the coma. Moreover this dust shows evidence of structure, indicating that there may be particle plumes issuing from the nucleus. Yet Chiron is 40 times larger and 50 000 times more massive than any known comet. It may well be an escapee from the Kuiper Belt. Other bodies with orbits crossing those of the giant planets were found later, and have been named after mythological centaurs. (Hidalgo and Damocles are not officially classed as Centaurs, because they are very small and have perihelia much closer to the Sun.) 5145 Pholus has a much more eccentric orbit than Chiron, crossing those of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune; while Chiron is greyish and active (see Table 8.16), Pholus is inert and very red. Half a dozen Centaurs are now known; those which have been allotted numbers are listed in Table 8.17. No doubt many more exist. K UIPER B ELT O BJECTS In January 1943 K. E. Edgeworth suggested the possibility of a swarm of minor bodies orbiting the Sun in the outermost part of the planetary system. The suggestion was made independently by G. P. Kuiper in 1951. A belt of asteroidal- sized objects does in fact exist and, perhaps rather unfairly, it is now always known as the Kuiper Belt. The first Kuiper Belt object (KBO) was discovered on 31 August 1992 by D. Jewitt and J. X. Luu, using the 2.2 m telescope on Mauna Kea. The magnitude was 23; it was given the provisional designation of 1992 QB 1 . Its orbit keeps it well beyond that of Neptune, and by asteroidal standards it is large, with an estimated diameter of 283 km. OtherKBOsweresoonfound, withapheliondistancesinthe range 35–45 a.u.; it is clear that the swarm is very populous indeed. It has even been suggested that there may be at least 35 000 KBOs more than 100 km in diameter – making it more massive than the main-belt asteroid zone. Table 8.18 lists data for some of the early KBO discoveries. Most KBOs seem to be dark and reddish; two, 1994 JQ 11 and 1994 VK 8 , are almost 400 km in diameter – larger than any main-belt asteroid apart from Ceres, Pallas, Vesta and Hygeia. It has been suggested that Pluto may be simply thelargestmemberoftheKBOswarm, andthatshort-period comets also come from there, but so far the evidence is not conclusive. 146 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"9J UPITER Jupiter is much the largest and most massive planet in the Solar System; its mass is greater than those of all the other planets combined.

The opposition brightness has a range of only about 0.5 magnitude. Generally speaking it ‘moves’ about one constellation per year; thus the 1998 opposition was in Pisces, that of 1999 in Aries and that of 2000 in Taurus. Opposition data for the period 2000–2005 are given in Table 9.2. Some years pass without an opposition, as in 2001 – because the opposition of 28 November 2000 is followed by the next on 1 January 2002; the next ‘missed year’ will be 2013. The perihelion years are 1987, 1999, 2011; the aphelion years are 1993, 2005, 2017. Generally Jupiter is the brightest of the planets apart from Venus; its only other rival is Mars at perihelic opposition. O CCULTATIONS A ND C ONJUNCTIONS Occultations of and by Jupiter involving other planets are rare. The last occasion when Jupiter was occulted by a planet was on 3 January 1818, when Venus occulted Jupiter; this will happen again on 22 November 2065, at 12.46 UT, but the elongation from the Sun will be only 8 ◦ W. Jupiter last occulted a planet on 15 August 1623, when it occulted Uranus, but on 10 May 1955, at 20.39 UT, Jupiter and Uranus were only 46 \u0002\u0002 apart; elongation from the Sun was 65 ◦ E, so that the event was easily observed (some unwary observersthoughtthatJupiterhadacquiredanextrasatellite, although in fact Uranus appeared appreciably larger and dimmer than the Galilean satellites). Data for occultations and close conjunctions are given in Tables 9.3 and 9.4. E ARLY O BSERVATIONS Since Jupiter is generally the brightest object in the sky apart from the Sun, the Moon and Venus, it must have been known since the dawn of human history. The first telescopic observations were made in 1610 by pioneers such as Galileo and Marius. The four main satellites were discovered, but at first no details were seen on Jupiter itself.

Zucchi may have seen the main equatorial belts in 1630, and F. Fontana definitely recorded three belts in 1633. In 1648 F. Grimaldi showed that the belts are parallel with the Jovian equator. In 1659 C. Huygens published a good drawing showing the two equatorial belts. More detailed drawings were made from 1665 by G. D. Cassini, first at Milan and then from Paris. He found the globe of Jupiter to be appreciably oblate, and recorded over half a dozen ‘bands’; by watching the drift of the surface features, including one well-marked spot, he gave a rotation period of just over 9h 55m, which was very near the truth. Other observers of the period included G. Campani and Robert Hooke. Careful studies of Jupiter were made in the latter part of the 16th century by William Herschel and J. H. Schr ̈ oter, but detailed results were delayed until the 17th century, with observers such as J. H. M ̈ adler, W. de la Rue, W. Lassell, W. R. Dawes and the Earl of Rosse. Rotation periods were measured; Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, gave 9h 55m 21s, but it became clear that the rotation is differential, with different latitudes having different periods.

In 1890 the British Astronomical Association was founded, and ever since then its Jupiter Section has monitored the surface features. These observations are invaluable, particularly since they go back to the era before good planetary photographs became available. Some early theories sound bizarre today. In 1698 Huygens maintained that Jupiter must be a moist, life- bearing world and that the belts were strips of vegetation, no doubt supporting animals. Even in the early 17th century W. Whewell believed Jupiter to be a globe of ‘ice and water’, with a cindery nucleus; he described ‘huge gelatinous 148 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"J UPITER monsters languidly floating in icy seas’. However, it was later assumed that Jupiter must be a miniature sun, able to warm its satellite syste m – a theory which was still generally accepted until less than 80 years ago. B ELTS A ND Z ONES The surface is dominated by the dark belts and bright zones, all of which are variable, although in general their latitudes do not change much. There are also various striking features, notably the Great Red Spot, described below. The main belts are listed in Table 9.5. Jupiter has the shortest ‘day’ insofar as the principal planets are concerned (some of the asteroids rotate much more quickly). It is not possible to give an overall value for the rotation period, because Jupiter does not spin in the way that a solid body would do. The equatorial zone has a shorter period than the rest of the planet. Conventionally, System I refers to the region between the north edge of the South Equatorial Belt and the south edge of the North Equatorial Belt; the mean period here is 9h 50m 30s, although individual features may have periods which differ perceptibly from this. System II, comprising the rest of the surface of the planet, has a period of 9h 55m 41s, although again different features have their own periods; that of the Great Red Spot varies between 9h 55m 36s and 9h 55m 42s. In addition there is System III, which relates not to optical features but to the bursts of decametre radio radiation; the period is 9h 55m 29s.7. There are no true ‘seasons’ on Jupiter, because the axial inclination to the perpendicular of the orbital plane is only just over 3 ◦ – less than for any other planet. The most prominent belt is generally the North Equatorial, while the South Equatorial Belt is very variable and may become obscure at times; on the other hand, at times during 1962–3 the two Equatorial Belts appeared to merge, andduring1988theSouthEquatorialwasfullyequal to the North Equatorial in width and intensity. Revivals of the South Equatorial Belt are the most spectacular phenomena seen on Jupiter; they involve sudden outbreaks of bright and dark clouds, with intense turbulence and many spots moving on rapid currents. Other belts are also subject to marked variations in intensity, although the North Temperate and South Temperate Belts are usually Table 9.5. Average latitudes of the belts a .

Around latitude 16 ◦ N may be seen brown ovals which are known as ‘barges’; they are low-lying, and it may be that their colour is due to the fact that they are slightly warmer than the adjacent regions, so that some of the ammonia ice particles begin to melt. We now have a sound knowledge of the way in which the Jovian winds blow. In the equatorial region, they blow west–east at about 100 m s − 1 relative to the core, reaching maximum speed 6 to 7 ◦ north and south of the equator. In the northern hemisphere the east wind decreases with increasing latitude, until at 18 ◦ N the clouds are moving THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 149"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"J UPITER westward at 25 m s − 1 . North of this, the windspeed falls to zero, and then shifts in an eastward direction, reaching a maximum of about 170 m s − 1 at 24 ◦ N. In the southern hemisphere conditions are not quite the same, due probably to the presence of the Great Red Spot. But in both hemispheres there is an alternating pattern of eastward and westward jet streams, which mark the boundaries of the visible belts. Spots such as the Great Red Spot circulate cyclonically or anticyclonically as if rolling between the jet streams. T HE G REAT R ED S POT The Great Red Spot is undoubtedly the most famous feature on Jupiter. Together with its characteristic ‘Hollow’, it has certainly been in existence for many centuries. It may have been recorded by Cassini as long ago as 1665, although the identification is not certain. A sketch made by R. Hooke on 26 June 1666 may also show it, and it is also possible that he made an observation of it in 1664. It was seen several times during the 19th century, following the first observation of the Hollow in 1831 by H. Schwabe; it was seen to encroach into the southern part of the South Equatorial Belt. The Spot itself was seen in 1858–9 by W. Huggins as a dark ring with a light interior, and also by Lord Rosse, with his great Birr Castle reflector. Suddenly, in 1878, it became very prominent, and brick-red in colour. It remained very conspicuous until 1882, but subsequently faded. Since then it has shown variations in both intensity and colour, and at times it has been invisible, but it always returns, so that duringtelescopictimesithasbeentoallintentsandpurposes a permanent feature – unlike any other of the spots. At its greatest extent it was said to measure 40 000 km in an east–west direction and 14 000 km north–south, giving it a greater surface area than that of the Earth, although more recently the dimensions have been 24 000 km by 12 000 km. Whether or not this shrinkage will continue remains to be seen. The latitude varies little from a value of 22 . 4 ◦ S, but the Spot drifts around in longitude, and over the past century the total longitude drift has amounted to about 1200 ◦ . It was once thought that the Red Spot might be the top of a glowing volcano, but this was soon shown to be untenable. It was then suggested that it might be a solid or semi-solid body floating in Jupiter’s outer gas, in which case it would be expected to disappear if its level sank for any reason (possibly a decrease in the density of the outer gas). In 1963 R. Hide suggested that it might be the top of a ‘Taylor column’, a sort of standing wave above a mountain or a depression below the gaseous layer. However, the space-probe results have given us quite a different picture. The Red Spot is a phenomenon of Jovian meteorology – a high-level anticyclonic vortex, with wind speeds of up to 360 km h − 1 . To the south the Spot is bounded by an east wind, while to the north it is bounded by a strong west wind. This means that as the winds are reflected round the Spot, they set up anti-clockwise rotation, with a period of 12 days at the outer edge and nine days inside. The vortex is a high-pressure area elevated 8 km above the adjacent cloud deck by the upward convection of warmer gases from below; smaller clouds to the north-east and north-west, beautifully shown on a 1997 image from the Galileo probe, look very like Earth’s towering thunderstorms. The cause of the red colour is not definitely known. It may be due to the condensation of phosphorus at the cloud tops. Certainly there is a great deal of interior structure. W HITE O VALS Also of great importance are (or were) the three white ovals on the edge of the South Temperate Belt, which are similar to the Red Spot in shape and which also drift around in longitude; all have dark borders. They have been under observation since 1939 and are longer-lived than any other spots on Jupiter with the exception of the Great Red Spot itself, and may also rotate in an anticyclonic sense. In February 1998 observations from professionals (at the Pic du Midi) and amateurs indicated that two of the ovals had merged, forming a single, larger oval; the temperature has been given as − 157 ◦ C, which is perceptibly colder than the surrounding regions, as with other atmospheric ovals. T HE S OUTH T ROPICAL D ISTURBANCE Also in the latitude of the Great Red Spot was a feature knownastheSouthTropicalDisturbance(STD),discovered by P. Molesworth on 28 February 1901 and last recorded by many observers during the apparition of 1939–40. It took the form of a shaded zone between white spots. The rotation period of the STD was shorter than that of the Red Spot, so 150 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"J UPITER that periodically the STD caught up the Red Spot and passed it; the two were at the same latitude, and the interactions were of great interest. Nine conjunctions were observed, andpossiblythebeginningofthetenthin1939–40,although by then the STD had practically vanished. Its average rotation period was 9h 55m 27s.6. It has not reappeared, but there have been several smaller, shorter-lived disturbances of the same type; the most notable of these lasted from 1979 to 1981. I NTERNAL S TRUCTURE O F J UPITER In 1923 and 1924 a classic series of papers by H. Jeffreys finally disposed of the idea that Jupiter is a miniature sun, giving off vast amounts of heat. Jeffreys proposed a model in which Jupiter would have a rocky core, a mantle composed of solid water ice and carbon dioxide, and a very deep, tenuous atmosphere. Methane and ammonia – both hydrogen compounds – were identified in the atmosphere by R. Wildt in 1932, and it was proposed that Jupiter must consist largely of hydrogen. In 1934 Wildt proposed a model giving Jupiter a rocky core 60 000 km in diameter, overlaid by an ice shell 27 000 m thick, above which lay the hydrogen-rich atmosphere. (This was certainly more plausible than a strange theory proposed by E. Schoenberg in1943. SchoenbergbelievedJupitertohaveasolidsurface, with volcanic rifts along parallels of latitude; heated gases rising from these rifts would produce the belts!) New models were proposed independently in 1951 by W. Ramsey in England and W. DeMarcus in America. According to Ramsey, the 120 000 km diameter core was composed of hydrogen, so compressed that it assumed the characteristics of a metal. The core was overlaid by an 8000 km deep layer of ordinary solid hydrogen, above whichcametheatmosphere. TodayitisbelievedthatJupiter is mainly liquid (a suggestion made long ago, in 1871, by G. W. Hough, who also believed the Red Spot to be a floating island). The latest models are based on work carried out by J. D. Anderson and W. B. Hubbard in the United States. There is no reason to think that they are very far from the truth, although it would be idle to pretend that our knowledge is at all complete. It seems that there is a relatively small, rocky core made up of iron and silicates, at a temperature of around 20 000 ◦ C (perhaps rather more). Above this is a thick shell of liquid metallic hydrogen. At about 46 000 km from the centre of the planet there is a transition from liquid metallic hydrogen to liquid molecular hydrogen; in the transition region the temperature is assumed to be around 11 000 ◦ C, with a pressure about three million times that of the Earth’s air at sea level. Above the liquid molecular hydrogen comes the gaseous atmosphere, which is about 1000 km deep. The change in site is gradual; there is no hard, sharp boundary, so that we cannot say definitely where the ‘atmosphere’ ends and the actual body of the planet begins. Jupiter radiates 1.7 times more energy than it would do if it depended only upon radiation received from the Sun. Probably this excess heat is nothing more than what remains of the heat generated when Jupiter was formed. It has been suggested that the globe is slowly contracting, with release of energy, but this explanation is not now generally favoured. Note, incidentally, that Jupiter’s core is not nearly hot enough to trigger off stellar-type nuclear reactions. Jupiter is not a ‘failed star’ or even a brown dwarf; it is definitely a planet. A TMOSPHERE What may be termed the atmosphere of Jupiter has a depth ofapproximately1000km, althoughofcoursenoabsolutely precise figure can be given. Most of it is hydrogen (H 2 ). According to one recent analysis, hydrogen accounts for 80.4% of the total and helium for 13.6%, which does not leave much room for anything else. Methane (CH 4 ) may account for up to 0.2%, and there are traces of ammonia (NH 3 ), hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) and ethane (C 2 H 6 ). The amount of water (H 2 O) is very small, and certainly no more than 0.1%. Gases warmed by the internal heat of the planet rise into the upper atmosphere and cool, producing clouds of ammonia crystals floating in gaseous hydrogen. These clouds form the bright zones on Jupiter, which are both higher and colder than the dark belts. It had been assumed that below the ammonia ice clouds came a layer of ammonium hydrosulphide, and below that a layer of water ice or liquid water droplets, although the results from the Galileo space-craft indicate that some of our long-held ideas may be in need of revision. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 151"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"J UPITER C OMET C OLLISION, 1994 A remarkable event, unique in our experience, occurred in July 1994, when a comet was observed to hit Jupiter. The comet was discovered on 26 March 1993 by Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker, working in collaboration with David Levy; because it was this team’s ninth discovery the comet was known as Shoemaker–Levy 9 (S/L 9). The image was found on a plate taken three nights earlier with the Schmidt telescope at Palomar. Carolyn Shoemaker described it as a ‘squashed comet’ quite unlike anything previously seen. It was in orbit not round the Sun, but round Jupiter, and had probably been in this sort of path ever since 1929 – perhaps even earlier. Calculations showed that on 7 July 1992 it had passed only 21 000 km from Jupiter, and had been disrupted, literally torn apart by the Giant Planet’s powerful gravitational pull. A year later, in July 1993, it reached apojove – its furthest point from Jupiter – and solar perturbations put it into a collision course. It was calculated that the chain of fragments would impact Jupiter in July 1994, and this is precisely what happened. Over 20 fragments were identified, strung out in the manner of a pearl necklace, and were lettered from A to W (I and O being omitted). The first fragment (A) was due to impact on 16 July, at 20h 11m UT and the last (W) on 22 July, at 8h 5m UT. The largest fragments were G and Q, while J and M soon faded out altogether. Subsequently P and Q split in two; P2 then split again, while P1 disappeared. By the time they reached Jupiter, the fragments were stretched out over about 29 000 000 km, with separate ‘tails’ and dusty ‘wings’ extending ahead of and behind the main swarm. All the fragments landed in about the same latitude: around 50 ◦ S, well south of the Red Spot and in the area of the South South Temperate Belt. Unfortunately all the impacts occurred on the side of Jupiter turned away from the Earth, but the planet’s quick rotation brought the affected areas into view after only a few minutes, and the results of the impacts were very marked 1 . Great dark spots were 1 I was observing with the 66 cm refractor as Herstmonceux, then the site of the Royal Greenwich Observatory. The scar left by Impact A was far more prominent than I had expected. Later scars were easily visible in the 5 cm finder of my small portable refractor, and were much blacker than anything I had ever previously seen on Jupiter apart from satellite shadows. produced; the most impressive was G, which impacted at 7h 32m on 18 July. Fragment G, which may have been 3–4 km across, created a fireball at least 3000 km high and left a multi-ringed scar on the cloud deck. It was estimated that if fragment G had hit the Earth it would have made a crater 60 km in diameter; the large fragments produced vast clouds of ‘smoke’ which remained visible from Earth for many months. At one stage the scars seemed to link up, producing what gave the impression of an extra belt on the planet. The impacts were observed from the Hubble Space Telescope, and also from the Galileo probe, then on its way to Jupiter. Hubble results showed the presence of ammonia and hydrogen sulphide in the G fireball as it cooled, but there was no sign of the expected water or ice layer beneath the cloud tops. There were no permanent effects on Jupiter, but the whole area was violently disturbed, and dark material in the Jovian stratosphere produced by the impacts could still be traced well into 1996. There had been suggestions that the impactor might have been an asteroid rather than a comet, but it now seems definite that S/L 9 really was a comet which had spent most of its career in the Kuiper Belt, beyond the orbit of Neptune. Could there have been any previous observations of cometary impacts? In 1690 G. D. Cassini recorded suspicious dark spots, as did Johann Schr ̈ oter in 1785 and 1786, using an excellent 13 cm reflector made by William Herschel; but it is quite impossible to decide whether or not these were due to an impact of a comet. T HE G ALILEO E NTRY P ROBE On 18 October 1989 the Galileo space-craft was launched. It was made up of an orbiter, designed to assume a closed path round Jupiter and transmit data, and an entry probe, to plunge into the clouds and send back results until being destroyed. The experiment was highly successful. At 22.04 UT on 7 December 1995 the entry probe met the Jovian atmosphere, at latitude 6 . 5 ◦ N, longitude 4 . 5 ◦ W, and transmitted for 57.6 min before losing contact. By then it had penetrated to a depth of about 600 km below the tenuous upper reaches of the Jovian atmosphere. The results were in some ways decidedly unexpected. Only one 152 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"J UPITER well-defined, distinct cloud structure was found, apparently corresponding to the previously predicted cloud layer of ammonium hydrosulphide. There was much less lightning activity than had been expected. However, one major surprise concerned the winds. It had been assumed that the strong Jovian winds, about 380 km h − 1 at the entry level, were more or less confined to the upper atmosphere, but Galileo showed that this is not the case; the velocity increased to over 500 km h − 1 below the visible level. This seems to indicate that the Jovian winds are not produced by solar heating, as on Earth, or by the condensation of water vapour; it is now more likely that the cause is heat escaping from the deep interior of the globe. The atmosphere was found to be much dryer than had been expected; it cannot contain more than one-fifth to one- tenth the percentage of water contained in the Sun. It may well be that Galileo plunged into the Jovian equivalent of a desert region on Earth; it entered at a point on the edge of the North Equatorial Belt, which is atypical of the planet as a whole. Certainly we have to admit that our knowledge of conditions below the Jovian cloud tops is very far from complete. R ADIO E MISSIONS Radio radiation from Jupiter was detected by B. F. Burke and K. L. Franklin, in the United States, in 1955. (It has to be admitted that the discovery was accidental.) The main emissions are in wavelengths 10–500 m (decametric) and 0.1–3 m (decimetric); there are also kilometric emissions (0.3–5 km) and millimetric (below 10 cm) due to plasma in Jupiter’s powerful magnetic field, outside the atmosphere and strongly influenced by the volcanic satellite Io. M AGNETOSPHERE Jupiter has a very powerful magnetic field – much the strongest in the entire Solar System. The strength is 4.2 G at the Jovian equator and 10–14 G at the magnetic poles; by contrast, the strength of the Earth’s magnetic field at the equator is a mere 0.3 G. With Jupiter, the magnetic axis is inclined to the rotational axis at an angle of 9 . 6 ◦ . The polarity is opposite to that of the Earth, so that if it were possible to use a magnetic compass on Jupiter the needle would point south. With regard to magnetic phenomena, distances from the centre of Jupiter are usually reckoned in terms of the planet’sradius, R J . ThevolcanicsatelliteIo, whichhassuch a profound effect upon these phenomena, lies at a distance of 5 . 9 R J , corresponding to about 422 000 km. The magnetic field is generated inside Jupiter, near the outer boundary of the shell of metallic hydrogen. The field is not truly symmetrical, but beyond a distance of a few R J it more or less corresponds to a dipole. There is a huge magnetosphere; if it could be seen with the naked eye from Earth, its apparent diameter would exceed that of the full moon. The outer boundary is formed at what is known as the magnetopause, where the incoming solar wind particles are deflected and produce a bow shock, at about 10 R J ahead of the actual magnetopause. The region between the bow shock and the true magnetopause is termed the magnetosheath. On the sunward side of Jupiter the field tends to be compressed; on the night side it is stretched out into a ‘magnetotail’ which may be up to 650 000 000 km long, so that at times it can even engulf Saturn. There are zones of intense radiation (protons and electrons), at least 10 000 times more powerful than the Van Allen zones surrounding the Earth. Pioneer 10, the first space-probe to encounter these zones (in December 1972), received a total of over 250 000 rads. Since a dose of 500 rads is fatal to a man, future astronauts will be well advised to keep well clear of the danger zone. In 1964 K. E. Bigg realized the orbital position of Io has a marked effect upon Jupiter’s decametric radiation, and it is now known that the satellite is connected to Jupiter by a very strong flux tube setting up a potential difference of 400 000 V. Molecules are sputtered off Io’s surface by particles in the magnetosphere, producing a ‘torus’ tilted to Io’s orbit by 7 ◦ , so that Io passes through it twice for each rotation of Jupiter. There is also a tenuous sodium cloud round Io which extends all round the orbit of the satellite.

Jupiter is also a source of cosmic radiation; cosmic rays from it have been detected as far away as the orbit of Mercury. Truly the Giant Planet is an energetic world! T HE R INGS O F J UPITER Jupiter’s ring system was discovered on 4 March 1979, on a single image sent back by the Voyager 1 probe as it passed through the equatorial plane of the planet. It is now known that there are three detectable rings. Details are given in Table 9.6. Table 9.6. The rings of Jupiter. The Halo and Gossamer rings are extremely tenuous. Metis and Adrastea lie in the Main Ring, and Amalthea at the outer edge of the Gossamer Ring. Traces of the Gossamer Ring extend out almost as far as the orbit of Thebe.

The rings are very dark, and are quite unlike the bright, icy rings of Saturn. They are caused by material coming from the small inner satellites Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea and perhaps Thebe. This material is released whenthesatellitesarestruckbyinterplanetarymeteoroidsat speeds greatly magnified by Jupiter’s powerful gravitational field – the situation has been compared with the cloud of chalk dust produced when two erasers are banged together. Metis and Adrastea, with their low escape velocities and their closeness to Jupiter, are probably the most important contributors. Metis and Adrastea lie inside the Main Ring, with Amalthea and Thebe further out. There seem to be no ice particles in the rings, and the ring material is more dark, reddish soot. The outer (Gossamer) ring is actually composed of two faint and more or less uniform rings, one enclosing the other; they extend from the outer boundary of the Main Ring (122 500 km) and extend out to over 222 000 km, although the ring is so tenuous that it is difficult to give a precise boundary. The fainter of the two extends radially inward from the orbit of Thebe, while the denser of the two – the enclosed ring – extends radially inward from the orbit of Amalthea. In each case the centres of the rings are fainter than the edges. The Main Ring extends from the orbit of AdrasteatotheedgeoftheHaloRing, whiletheHaloRingis toroidal, extending radially from 122 000 km to 92 000 km. Voyager and Galileo results show that the rings are much brighter in forward-scattered light than in back- scattered or reflected light. This indicates that the ring particles are in general only 1–2 μ m across. Such particles have relatively short lifetimes in stable orbits, so that the rings must be continually replenished by material produced by the small satellites. S PACE-CRAFT T O J UPITER Sixspace-crafthavenowencounteredJupiter; twoPioneers, two Voyagers, Galileo and the solar polar probe Ulysses, which by-passed Jupiter and used the powerful Jovian gravity to put it into its planned orbit well out of the perpendicular. Details are given in Table 9.7. The Pioneers were virtual twins; both were successful. Pioneer 10 carried out studies of the Jovian atmosphere and magnetosphere, and returned over 300 images. It showed that the radiation zones are far stronger than had been previously believed. The first energetic particles were detected when Pioneer was still over 20 000 000 km from Jupiter, and the radiation level increased steadily as Pioneer moved inward; at the minimum distance from the upper clouds (131 400 km) the instruments were almost saturated, and if the minimum distance had been much less the mission would have failed. The proposed orbit of Pioneer 2 was hastily altered to a different trajectory which would carry it quickly over Jupiter’s equatorial zone, where the danger is at its worst. Pioneer 10 is now on its way out of the Solar System; it carries a plaque to give a clue to its planet of origin – although whether any other beings would be able to decipher the message seems rather debatable. Pioneer 11 confirmed the earlier findings, and was then put into a path which took it out to a rendezvous with Saturn. It too is now leaving the Solar System permanently. 154 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"J UPITER Table 9.7. Missions to Jupiter, 1972–2000.

Went on to survey the poles of the Sun. The third Jupiter probe, Voyager 1, was actually launched a few days later than its twin Voyager 2, but trav- elled in a more economical path. (To confuse matters still further, initial faults detected in the first space-craft caused a switch in numbers, so that the original Voyager 1 became Voyager 2 and vice versa .) The Voyagers were much more elaborate than the Pioneers, and the results obtained were of far higher quality. Voyager 1 also surveyed the satellites Io, Ganymede and Callisto. Voyager 2 followed much the same programme, and was also sent close to Europa, the only Galilean satellite not well studied by its predecessor. Voyager 1 went on to survey Saturn, while Voyager 2 was able to encounter Uranus and Neptune as well. Galileo was made up of an orbiter and an entry probe. After a six-year journey through the Solar System, Galileo approached Jupiter in 1995; on 13 July of that year the orbiter was separated from the entry probe, and the two reached Jupiter on different trajectories. The entry probe dived into the Jovian clouds on 7 December 1995, and survived for 57.6 min, by which time it had penetrated to a depth of about 600 km. Six hours before entry it also detected a new, very intense radiation zone round Jupiter. The orbiter acted as a relay, and after the demise of the entry probe began a long-continued survey of the satellite system. Ulysses was essentially a solar probe, and Jupiter was incidental – it had to be encountered to put Ulysses into its planned path, well out of the ecliptic. However, during its pass of Jupiter, Ulysses did send back some useful data about the magnetosphere, radiation zones and general environment. S ATELLITES Jupiter’s satellite family is unlike any other in the Solar System. There are four main satellites, of planetary size, always known as the Galileans, although probably Marius saw them slightly before Galileo did so. Of these, three are larger than our Moon and the fourth (Europa) only slightly smaller, while Ganymede is actually larger than Mercury, although less massive. There are 12 smaller satellites, four close in and eight further out than the Galileans; the outer satellites are probably asteroidal, and are so perturbed by the Sun that their orbits are not even approximately circular. The outer four have retrograde motion. Data for the satellites are given in Table 9.8. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 155"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"J UPITER Table 9.8. Satellites of Jupiter.

Very keen-sighted people have even reported naked-eye sightings, and there is considerable evidence that one of them (probably Ganymede, or else two satellites close together) was seen from China by Gan De as long ago as 364 BC. The first attempted maps of the Galileans were due to A. Dollfus and his colleagues at the Pic du Midi Observatory in 1961. Some features were recorded, but, predictably, the maps were not very accurate. Today we have detailed maps obtained by space- craft, anddetailscanalsobefollowedwiththeHubbleSpace Telescope. The Small Inner Satellites Metis . Named after the daughter of Zeus (Jupiter) by his first consort, Oceanus. It was identified on the Voyager images, and lies within the Main Ring. Galileo images taken in 1996 and 1997 show that it is rather elliptical, with a longest diameter of about 60 km; the albedo is low. Adrastea . Named after a daughter of Jupiter and Ananke (equated with Nemesis, the goddess of rewards and punishments). It too was discovered on Voyager images. It lies in the outer part of the Main Ring and is, with Metis, one of the main sources of the ring particles. It has low albedo, but nothing much else is known about it. Amalthea . A mythological name; possibly the goat which suckled the infant Jupiter (Zeus) or possibly the daughter of Melisseus, King of Crete, who brought up the infant on a diet of goat’s milk. It was discovered in 1892 by E. E. Barnard, using the 36 inch (91 cm) refractor at the Lick Observatory; this was the last satellite discovery to be made visually. The satellite is irregular in form; the surface is very red, due probably to contamination from Io. It has synchronous rotation, with its longest axis pointing toward Jupiter, and is heavily cratered. The two largest craters, Gaea and Pan, are of immense size relative to the overall diameter of Amalthea. Pan is 90 km in diameter. It was well imaged in January 2000 by the Galileo probe, from a range of 351 km. Gaea seems to have a depth of between 10 and 20 km; if the latter figure is correct, the slope angle of the wall will be 30 ◦ , making it the steepest known scarp Figure 9.1.

(It would be interesting to watch a piece of material fall from the crest to the floor; the descent time would be about 10 min!) Both Pan and Gaea are deeper, relatively, than craters of similar size on the Moon. Between them, from longitude 0–60 ◦ W, is a complex region of troughs and ridges, tens of kilometres long and up to at least 20 km wide. The two bright patches, Ida and Lyctos, are each about 15 km across and are presumably mountains (Table 9.9). Amalthea is exposed to the Jovian radiation field, and also to energetic ions, protons and electrons produced in Jupiter’s magnetosphere; it is also bombarded by micrometeorites, and by sulphur, oxygen and sodium ions that have been blasted away from Io.

Named after the daughter of Inachus, King of Argos; Jupiter was enamoured of her and Juno, Jupiter’s wife, ill- naturedly changed Io into a white heifer. The satellite is slightly larger than our Moon, and is the densest of the four Galileans. Before the space missions it was tacitly assumed to be a rocky, cratered world, but in the event nothing could have been further from the truth; it is the most volcanically active of any body in the Solar System. In March 1979, S. Peale and his colleagues in America suggested that since Io’s orbit is not perfectly circular, the interiormightbe‘flexed’bythegravitationalpullsofJupiter and the other Galileans, heating it sufficiently to produce active surface volcanoes. A week later, on 9 March, this prediction was dramatically verified. Linda Morabito, a member of the Voyager imaging team, was looking for a faint star, AGK-10021, as a check on Io’s position when she saw what was undoubtedly a volcanic plume rising from the limb of the satellite. Subsequently nine plumes were detected, together with volcanic craters and numerous calderæ; impact craters were absent. The lack of impact craters means that the surface cannot be more than a million years old, and there must be constant ‘resurfacing’, with deposition of a layer 1 mm thick each year. The surface is made up of vent regions, plains regions and mountains; the average surface temperature is − 143 ◦ C. Mountains are appreciable; the highest, Hæmus, rises to 13 km, and its steep slopes means that it cannot be solid sul- phur, eventhoughsulphurandsulphurdioxidecovermostof Io’s surface. The mountains are presumably siliceous, with an outer coating of sulphur sent out by the volcanoes. The plains are crossed by yellow and brownish-yellow flows; the original Voyager images made them look redder than they really are. There are extensive deposits of sulphur diox- ide (SO 2 ); the gas is vented from the volcanic areas and is frozen out when it reaches the bitterly cold surface. The volcanoes seem to be of two main types. The sulphur volcanoes, such as Pele, Surt and Aten, send out material at up to 1 km s − 1 ; eruptions last for days or months (for example, Pele was erupting at the time of the Voyager 1 pass, but was quiescent when Voyager 2 flew past the planet). The sulphur dioxide volcanoes, such as Prometheus, Amirani and Volund, have lower vent velocities, but eruptions go on for months or years consecutively. (Loki, one of the most violent centres, seems to be of a hybrid type.) The temperatures of the volcanoes are very high, and the Galileo probe recorded that Pillan Patera reached over 2000 ◦ C. This is too hot for the material to be sulphur, and it now seems that intensely heated lava, in the form of silica enriched by magnesium and sodium, may be responsible for much or all of Io’s vulcanism. However, the plumes are more in the nature of geysers, emitting sulphur dioxide particles and gas rather than water as in terrestrial geysers. They rise to hundreds of kilometres, although the vent velocities are not sufficient to expel material from Io altogether. The black patches seen round the geysers are due to sulphur dioxide frost. Over 200 calderæ have been identified, although by no means all areactive; thereareprobablymanylavalakes. Observations from the Galileo probe in late 1999 showed over 100 active centres. Pele volcano showed a red ring of sulphur, over 1200 km in diameter, deposited by a plume of material emerging from the volcano. Loki is the most powerful volcano in the Solar System, emitting more heat than all the Earth’s active volcanoes combined; the temperature of the lava attains 1027 ◦ C. A selected list of surface features is given in Table 9.10. Io seems to have a dense core, rich in iron and iron sulphide, which extends half-way from the centre of the globe to the surface, and is overlaid by a mantle of partly molten rock; above this comes the relatively thin, rocky, sulphur-coated crust. The atmosphere of sulphur dioxide is excessively tenuous, and corresponds to what we usually call a good laboratory vacuum; it may also be very variable in both density and distribution. Its highest pressure is one- thousand millionth of that of the Earth’s air at sea level. On Io, the active volcanic areas and pateræ have been named after gods of fire, thunder, volcanoes, mythical blacksmiths and solar deities (for example, Pele is the Hawaiian goddess of fire), catenæ after Sun-gods and the other features after people and places associated with myths involving Io. Io is indeed a strange, colourful place, but since it moves well within Jupiter’s radiation zones it must be just about the most lethal world in the entire Solar System.

Europa. Europa . Europa is the second and smallest of the four Galileans. In mythology she was the daughter of King Agenor of Tyre and sister of Cadmus; Jupiter (Zeus) assumed the form of a bull and carried her across the sea to Crete, where she bore him several children. Europa is as different from Io as it could possibly be. Its surface is smooth and white, covered with water ice or snow; the average albedo is 0.7 for the white regions and 0.5–0.6 for the slightly darker areas, so that Europa is particularly reflective. It is also very cold, with a mean surface temperature of − 145 ◦ C. There are few impact craters, showing that the surface must be young – perhaps only a few millions of years old, so that there must be constant resurfacing. The surface features are unlike any found elsewhere in the Solar System, and when they were first seen, on the Voyager images, new terms had to be introduced (flexus, linea, macula). There is little surface relief, and no hills as much as 1 km high. The trailing hemisphere is somewhat darker than the leading part of the satellite, due no doubt to contamination from Io. Europa has been described as a map-maker’s nightmare; one region looks very much like another. The criss-crossing ridges and linear features extend for thousands of kilometres; there are ridges and narrow grooves, and shallow pits a few kilometres across, as well as darker patches with diameters of from 50 to 500 km. There is absolutely no doubt that the surface material is water ice, and in 1982 R. Reynolds and S. Squyres sug- gested that below the crust there might be an ocean of liquid water. This is now regarded as a real possibility. Io has marked effects upon Jupiter’s magnetic field, but the same would not be expected of Europa; yet this does apparently happen. Water, particularly salty water, is a good conductor of electricity, and if Jupiter’s field sets up a current in an un- derground ocean on Europa this will make its presence felt. 162 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"J UPITER Table 9.11.

The plains are broken into plates a few kilometres across, and it has even been proposed that they drift about above the liquid or mushy material below; along fracture lines, warm material may well up to produce the linear fea- tures (a process termed cryovulcanism). One very young crater, Pwyll, shows bright rays extending in all directions and crossing all other features; possibly the impactor pen- etrated the crust through to the darker material below, and the crater floor is now at the same level as the outer terrain, so that it may be filled with slushy material. There are even features which look uncannily like icebergs. In 1999 the Galileo space-probe detected sulphuric acid on the surface of Europa. Hydrogen peroxide has also been detected. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Galileo space-craft have shown that Europa has an excessively tenuous oxygen atmosphere, with a density no more than one hundred thousand millionth of that of the Earth’s air at sea-level. If all of it were compressed to the density of our air, it would just about fill the Royal Festival Hall. The icy surface of the satellite is subject to impacts from dust and charged particles, and these processes cause the surface ice to produce water vapour as well as gaseous fragments of water molecules. These are then broken up into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen escapes, while the oxygen is retained to form a thin atmosphere extending up to perhaps 200 km; obviously it must be continuously replenished from below. Craters on Europa are named after Celtic heroes, and other features after people associated with myths involving Europa. A selected list of surface features is given in Table 9.11. There are many cycloid-shaped cracks known as flexi . G. Hoppa and B. Randall (University of Arizona) suggested in 1999 that they were formed as Europa’s icy crust responded to tidal forces induced by Jupiter. There is certainly a tidal bulge 30 m high, and this shifts location during each revolution, since the orbit of the satellite is slightly eccentric. According to Hoppa and Randall, this causes tension cracks to open and propagate along the THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 163"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"J UPITER Figure 9.4. Ganymede. surface at a rate of around 3 km h − 1 . This, of course, would indicate that the tidal bulge is sliding freely over the interior, and is further evidence in support of an underground ocean (in which it has even been suggested that life might exist, though this is, to put it mildly, highly speculative). On 3 January 2000 the Galileo probe passed Europa at 351 km, and magnetic effects added credibility to the idea of an underground ocean. Water, particularly salty water, conducts electric currents well, but ice does not, so that an ice-shell seems unlikely. Ganymede . Ganymede is the largest satellite in the Solar System. It is named after a handsome shepherd boy summoned by Jupiter to become cup-bearer to the gods. (One has to admit that Jupiter’s motives were not entirely altruistic!) Ganymede is much less dense than Io or Europa, and is of quite different type; the overall density is less than twice that of water. The interior structure is not well known, but there must be an iron-rich, partially molten core; above this comes the mantle, of which the lower part is siliceous and the upper part icy. The mantle is overlaid by the thin, icy crust. All in all, it seems that the globe is made up of a combination of rocky materials (60%) and ice (40%). There are two types of surface: dark areas and bright regions. The dark regions are well-defined; the most promi- nent has been appropriately named Galileo Regio.

These areas are essentially icy. Of the faculæ (bright spots)themostprominentisMemphis, whichcontainsdark- floored craters which have been punched through to the darker material below – indicating that much of the bright palimpsest is a thin sheet. Impact craters abound; the largest well-marked crater is the 175 km Gilgamesh, which is surrounded by outlying concentric escarpments with an overall diameter of 800 km. Small craters tend to have central peaks, while with larger craters (over 35 km across) central pits are more common. There are also ray-craters, such as Osiris, whose brilliant rays stretch out for over 1000 km. Unquestionably there has been marked tectonic activity in past ages, although Ganymede today is to all intents and purposes inert. One major surprise, due to the Galileo probe, is that Ganymede has a magnetic field. By terrestrial standards it is weak, but it is sufficient to produce a well-defined magnetosphere – so that we have a magnetosphere within a magnetosphere. The magnetic axis is inclined to the rotational axis by about 10 ◦ . There is even vague evidence of polar auroræ. The Hubble Space Telescope detected ozone on the surface, caused by the disruption of icy particles by bombardment from charged particles. There is also a very tenuous oxygen atmosphere, no denser than that of Europa and presumably of the same type. On Ganymede, craters and fossæ are named after gods and heroes of the ancient Fertile Crescent peoples, faculæ after places associated with Egyptian myths, sulci after places associated with other ancient myths, and regions after astronomers who have discovered Jovian satellites (Galileo, Simon Marius, E. E. Barnard, S. B. Nicholson and C. D. Perrine). A selected list of formations on Ganymede is given in Table 9.12. Callisto . Callisto, the fourth Galilean, is named after the daughter of King Lycaon of Arcadia, who was turned into a bear by Juno and subsequently placed in the sky as Ursa Major. Callisto is almost as large as Mercury, but its relatively low albedo means that it is the faintest of the Galileans. It is also much further away from Jupiter, so that eclipse, transit and occultation phenomena are less frequent than with Io, Europa or Ganymede. It is also the least dense of the four, although its escape velocity is still higher than that of Europa. Although Callisto is almost equal to Ganymede in size, it is different in many respects. It seems to be compara- tively undifferentiated, and until recently it was thought to lack any substantial iron-rich core; we are not yet certain whether such a core exists. The surface is icy, and is sat- urated with craters. The dominant features are two large ringed basins, Valhalla and Asgard. Valhalla is a complex structure; around the central 600 km palimpsest there are concentric rings, and the palimpsest itself is less heavily cratered than the surrounding areas, showing that Valhalla is young by Callistan standards – although the entire surface is very ancient, and there is no definite evidence of past tec- tonic activity, as there is on Ganymede. Asgard is similar in type, although smaller; the third basin is partly obscured by rays from Adlinda, the crater after which the basin itself is named. Elsewhere there are craters all over the surface, some of which have dark floors with bright rims and central peaks, but very small craters seem to be less numerous than was thought before the data sent back by the Galileo space probe. There are various catenæ (crater-chains), due proba- bly to the impacts of comets or asteroids which were broken up before impacting. For example, Gipul Catena is a crater- chain 620 km long; the largest crater is 40 km across. Svol, crossing the 81 km crater Skul, is another good example of a catena. Callisto shows no Ganymede-type grooves, and there are not many craters over 100 km in diameter. Ringed basins are named after the homes of the Norse gods and heroes; craters from heroes and heroines from Northern myths, and catenæ from mythological places in Scandinavia. A selected list of features on Callisto is given in Table 9.13. Before the Galileo results it was generally assumed that Callisto was solid through to its centre, and that it had been totally inert since the very early days of the Solar System. The globe seems to consist of a mixture of rock and ice in equal proportions, with the percentage of rock increasing with increasing depth. The main surprise has been that as Callisto moves through Jupiter’s magnetic field it seems to produce the same sorts of effects as Europa, and this has led to a change of opinion; beneath the 200 km thick crust there may be a salty ocean, up to 10 km deep. This may sound inherently improbable, but it is 168 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"J UPITER Table 9.13. Selected list of features on Callisto.

According to M. Kivelson, principal investigator for Galileo’s magnetometer, ‘The new data certainly suggest that something is hidden below Callisto’s surface, and that something may well be a salty ocean.’ Galileo has also detected an excessively tenuous atmosphere, which seems to be made up of carbon dioxide. The density is so low that it ranks as an exosphere, i.e. a collisionless gas. It is easily lost because of the effects of ultra-violet radiation from the Sun, and so it must be constantly replenished, perhaps by venting from Callisto’s interior – although this again mitigates against the assumption that the satellite is completely inert. Altogether, Callisto has provided some unexpected results. The Outer Small Satellites The outer satellites are very small and probably asteroidal. They fall into two well-defined groups; the inner (Leda, Himalia, Lysithea and Elara) and the outer (Ananke, Carme, Pasipha ̈ e and Sinope). The outer four satellites have retrograde motion. Leda . Named after the wife of King Tyndareos of Sparta; she was the mother of the ‘Heavenly Twins’, Castor and Pollux. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 169"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"J UPITER Leda was discovered by C. Kowal in 1974. (At about the same time Kowal suspected the presence of another satellite, similar in brightness, but this has never been confirmed.) Because of its faintness and very small size, little is known about Leda. Himalia . Named after one of Jupiter’s many consorts – by whom she had three sons. It is much the largest of the asteroidal satellites, and the only one over 100 km in diameter. Variations in brightness have enabled its rotation period to be determined (9 1 2 h) and it may be elliptical in shape, but nothing else is known about it. Lysithea . Named after a daughter of the sea-god Oceanus. Again we know little about it. Elara . One of Perrine’s discoveries in 1905, shortly after the identification of Himalia; Elara is much the smaller of the two, and no details are available. In mythology Elara was one of Jupiter’s countless lovers, and mother of the giant Titius. Ananke . In mythology Ananke was the mother of Adrastea, by Jupiter. It is the smallest of the outer group of ret- rograde satellites, and we have no information about its surface. It was discovered photographically by Nicholson in 1951. Carme . One of Jupiter’s innumerable partners, and mother of Britomartis, a Cretan goddess of happiness. Like Lysithea, it was discovered by Nicholson in 1938. Also like Lysithea, we know nothing about its surface features. Pasipha ̈ e . Discovered by P. J. Melotte in 1908, Pasipha ̈ e was ‘lost’ until 1914, and again between 1941 and 1955; like the other asteroidal outer satellites, it is so perturbed by the Sun that its orbit is very variable, and no two revolutions are alike. Of course, modern equipment ensures that there is no fear of its being mislaid again, but about its physical details we are totally ignorant. Sinope . The outermost asteroidal satellite was discovered by accident. On 21 July 1914, S. B. Nicholson set out to photograph Pasipha ̈ e; when he developed the plate, he found not only Pasipha ̈ e but also the newcomer. Little is known about Sinope. It is quite possible that the four outer satellites are the d ́ ebris from a larger body which was disrupted for some reason. No doubt further very small attendants await discovery. 170 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"10 S ATURN Saturn, the outermost planet known in ancient times, is sixth in order of distance from the Sun. It was named in honour of the first ruler of Olympus, who was succeeded by his son Jupiter (Zeus). It moves across the sky more slowly than any of the other planets known before the invention of the telescope, and has thus been associated with the passage of time. Data are given in Table 10.1.

Number of confirmed satellites: 18 M OVEMENTS Saturn reaches opposition about 13 days later every year. Opposition dates for the period 2000–2005 are given in Table 10.2. The opposition magnitude is affected both by Saturn’s varying distance and by the angle of presentation of the rings. At its best, Saturn may outshine any star apart from Sirius and Canopus, but at the least favourable oppositions from this point of view – when the rings are edgewise-on, as in 1995 – the maximum magnitude may be little brighter than Aldebaran. A list of edgewise presentations is given in Table 10.3. The intervals between successive edgewise presenta- tions are 13 years 9 months and 15 years 9 months. During the shorter interval, the south pole is sunward; the south- ern ring-face is seen, and Saturn passes through perihelion. Perihelion fell in 1944 and 1974; the next will be in 2003. The aphelion dates are 1959, 1988 and 2018. At edgewise presentations, the rings almost disappear, particularly when the Earth passes through the plane of the rings and also when the Sun does so. This is an obvious proof that the rings are very thin. OccultationsofSaturnbythemoonarenotuncommon; it is then interesting to note how small Saturn appears when compared with a lunar crater! There will be close conjunctions of Saturn and Venus on 26 August 2006 and 9 January 2016, and on 15 September 2037, at 21.30 UT, Mercury and Saturn will be separated by only 18 arcsec. E ARLY R ECORDS The first observations of Saturn must have been made in prehistoric times. The first recorded observations seem to have been those made in Mesopotamia in the mid-7th century BC. About 650 BC there is a record that Saturn ‘entered the Moon’, which is presumably a reference to an occultation of the planet. Very careful observations were made by the Greeks and, later, the Arabs; of course it was generallyassumedthatSaturn, likeallothercelestialbodies, moved round the Earth.

Tycho Brahe noted that on 18 August 1563 Saturn was in conjunction with Jupiter. However, the first telescopic observation was delayed until July 1610, when Galileo examined it with his early telescope, using a magnification of × 32. He noted that ‘the planet Saturn is not one alone, but is composed of three, which almost touch one another and never move nor change with respect to one another. They are arranged in a line parallel to the Zodiac, and the middle one is about three times the size of the lateral ones’. Galileo’s telescope was not powerful enough to show the rings in their true guise, and subsequently he was puzzled to find that the lateral bodies had disappeared; in fact the rings were edgewise-on in December 1612. Later, Galileo again saw the lateral bodies, but was unable to interpret them. A drawing made by the French astronomer Pierre Gassendi on 19 June 1633 shows what seems to be a ring, but Gassendi also failed to interpret it. The correct explanation was given by Christiaan Huygens in 1659, in his book Systema Saturnium . He had started his telescopic observations in 1655, using a magnification of × 50; in his book he gave the answer in an anagram which he had published to ensure priority. In translation, the anagram reads: ‘The planet is surrounded by a thin flat ring, nowhere touching the body of the planet, and inclined to the ecliptic’. Some earlier explanations were very wide of the mark. For instance, the French mathematician Gilles de Roberval believed Saturn to be surrounded by a torrid Table 10.3. Edgewise presentations of Saturn’s rings (Sun crossing). 1936 Dec 28 1950 Sept 21 1956 June 15 1980 Mar 3 1995 Nov 19 2009 Aug 10 2025 May 5 2039 Jan 22 zone giving off vapours, transparent and in small quantity but reflecting sunlight off the edges if of medium density, and producing an elongated appearance when thicker. Huygens’ explanation was not universally accepted until 1665. Subsequent telescopic improvements meant that the rings could be examined in more detail. The division between the two main rings (A and B) was discovered by G. D. Cassini in 1675, and is named after him (claims that W. Ball had seen the Division ten years earlier have been discounted). A narrower division, in Ring A, was discovered by J. F. Encke from Berlin on 28 May 1837, while the Cr ˆ epe or Dusky Ring (Ring C) was detected by W. Bond from Harvard in November 1850, using the 15 in (38 cm) Merz refractor there; independent confirmation came from W. Lassell and W. R. Dawes in England. The transparency of Ring C was discovered in 1852, independently by Lassell and by C. Jacob from Madras. In fact the Cr ˆ epe Ring is not a difficult object when Saturn is suitably placed; indications of it may have been shown by Campani as long ago as 1664. 172 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"S ATURN Extra rings were later reported; in 1907 G. Fournier, using an 11 in (28 cm) refractor at Mont Revard in France, claimed to have seen a dusky ring outside the main system. It is now known that there are in fact three exterior rings, although they are very difficult to observe from Earth. An inner structure, D, extends down towards the cloud tops, but can hardly be regarded as a true ring. Originally it was assumed that the rings must be solid; the first suggestion that this cannot be so was made by J. Cassini in 1705. Theoretical confirmation was provided in 1875 by James Clerk Maxwell, who showed that no solid ring could exist; it would be disrupted by Saturn’s powerful gravitational pull. Spectroscopic proof was given in 1895 by J. E. Keeler, who showed that the rings do not rotate as a solid mass would do; the inner sections have the fastest rotation. Using the 13 in (33 cm) refractor at the Allegheny Observatory in Pittsburgh, Keeler measured the Doppler shifts of the spectral lines at the opposite ends of the rings (ansæ) and was able to measure the rotational speeds. A very interesting observation was made on 9 February 1917 by two amateurs, M. A. Ainslie and J. Knight; Ainslie useda9in(23cm) refractoratBlackheath, inOuterLondon, and Knigh ta5in(13cm) refractor at Rye in Sussex. The star B.D. + 21 ◦ 1714 passed behind the rings, and the way in which the star was dimmed by the various rings and gaps provided valuable information. Yet in 1954 G. P. Kuiper, using the 200 in (5 m) Hale reflector at Palomar, claimed that the Cassini Division was the only genuine gap, Encke’s Divisionbeingamere‘ripple’andalltheotherreportedgaps non-existent. The fact that the rings were made up of small particles was well established during the 20th century. Radar reflections from the rings were obtained in 1972, and indicated that the ring particles were icy, with diameters of between 4 and 30 cm. O BSERVATIONS O F T HE G LOBE Saturn’s globe shows belts, not unlike those of Jupiter, but much less prominent, and sensibly curved. Predictably, the globe is flattened; this was first noted in 1789 by William Herschel. He gave the ratio of the equatorial to the polar diameter as 11:10, which is approximately correct. Apart from Jupiter, Saturn has the shortest rotation period of any planet in the Solar System. Well-defined spots were seen in 1796 by J. H. Schr ̈ oter and his assistant, K. Harding, from Schr ̈ oter’s observatory at Lilienthal, near Bremen. Prominent white spots are found occasionally. Onewasseenon8December1876byA.Hall; there was another in 1903, observed by A. S. Williams; and then, in 1933, a really spectacular outbreak, discovered on 3 August by W. T. Hay, usin ga6in(15cm) refractor. (Hay may be better remembered today as Will Hay, the stage and screen comedian.) The spot remained identifiable until 13 September 1933. W. H. Wright considered it to have been of ‘an eruptive nature’. Another spot was seen in 1960 andamajoroutbreakin1990; on25SeptemberanAmerican amateur, S. Wilber, detected a brilliant white spot in much the same latitude as the earlier ones. Within a few days the spot had been spread out by Saturn’s strong equatorial winds, and by 10 October had been transformed into a bright zone all round the equator. Extra outbreaks were seen in it, clearly indicating an uprush of material from below. There is an interesting periodicity here. The white spots were seen in 1876, 1903, 1933, 1960 and 1990; the intervals between outbreaks have been 27, 30, 27 and 30 years. This is very close to Saturn’s orbital period of 29 1 2 years. It could be coincidental, but observers will be on watch for a new white spot around 2020. C OMPOSITION O F S ATURN Initially it was assumed that Saturn must be a sort of miniature Sun. As recently as 1882 R. A. Proctor, in his book Saturn and its System , wrote: ‘Over a region hundreds of thousands of square miles in extent, the glowing surface of the planet must be torn by subplanetary forces. Vast masses of intensely hot vapour must be poured forth from beneath, and rising to enormous heights, must either sweep away the enwrapping mantle of cloud which had concealed the disturbed surface, or must itself form into a mass of cloud, recognizable because of its enormous extent .... ’ The first modern-type model of Saturn was proposed in 1938 by R. Wildt. Wildt believed that there was a rocky core, overlaid by a thick layer of ice which was itself overlaid by the gaseous atmosphere. Today it seems that there are strong resemblances between the compositions of Jupiter and Saturn, although THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 173"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"S ATURN Saturn has a much smaller mass and lower density (less than that of water, so that in theory it would float if dropped into a vast ocean). There is presumably a silicate core at a high temperature, perhaps as high as 15 000 ◦ C although possibly rather less; then comes a layer of liquid metallic hydrogen, succeeded by a layer of liquid molecular hydrogen and then by the atmosphere. Hydrogen and helium combined make up about 70% of the total mass of the planet. Like Jupiter and Neptune (but unlike Uranus), Saturn sends out more energy than it would do if it depended entirely upon what it receives from the Sun; the excess amounts to 1.8% (as against 1.7% for Jupiter). However, the cause is different. Saturn must by now have lost the heat produced during its formation, whereas the more massive Jupiter has not had time to do so. It is likely that the excess energy of Saturn is gravitational, produced by helium droplets, generated in the upper regions, falling through the lighter hydrogen toward the centre of the globe. This also explains why Saturn has less high- altitude helium than Jupiter. The rotation period of the core is given as 10h 39m.4, which is longer than that of the upper clouds. Dynamo action in the layer of metallic hydrogen is responsible for Saturn’s strong magnetic field. A TMOSPHERE A ND C LOUDS Saturn’s atmosphere contains relatively more hydrogen and less helium than in the case of Jupiter. Details are given in Table 10.4. Table 10.4. Composition of the atmosphere of Saturn. Major Molecular hydrogen (H 2 ), 96.3% (uncertainty 2.4%) Helium (He), 3.25% (uncertainty 3.25%) Minor (parts per million) Methane (CH 4 ), 4500 Ammonia (NH 3 ), 125 Deuterium (HD), 110 Ethane (C 2 H 6 ), 7 (All these values are subject to uncertainty) Aerosols Ammonia ice, water ice, ammonia hydrosulphide. There are thought to be three main cloud decks. The uppermost consists of ammonia ice, about 100 km below the tropopause, which lies at the top of Saturn’s troposphere; the temperature here is of the order of − 120 ◦ C. Next come the clouds of ammonium hydrosulphide, about 170 km below the tropopause, where the temperature may be around − 70 ◦ C. Below come the H 2 O clouds, around 230 km below the tropopause, where the temperature has risen to about 0 ◦ C, although as yet we cannot claim that our knowledge of these regions is at all reliable. At about 120 km above the H 2 O clouds the pressure is probably about the same as the pressure of the Earth’s atmosphere at sea level. Windspeeds in the atmosphere are high; the zonal winds along the belts, in a prograde direction (blowing toward the east) may attain over 600 km h − 1 , although most are less violent. There is an equatorial jet stream; at higher latitudes there are alternating streams, but mostly prograde and rather weaker. As yet we know little about the wind- speeds well below the visible surface. Saturn is colder than Jupiter, so that ammonia crystals form at higher levels, covering the planet with ‘haze’ and giving it a somewhat bland appearance. Features over 1000 km in diameter are uncommon, and even the largest ovals are no more than half the size of Jupiter’s Red Spot. Seasonal effects occur; for example, the Sun crossed into Saturn’s northern hemisphere in 1980, and during the Voyager missions the northern hemisphere was still the colder of the two. The south pole was 10 ◦ warmer than the north pole. M AGNETIC F IELD A ND A URORÆ Saturn has a strong magnetic field, first detected in 1979 by the Pioneer 11 probe. It is 850 times stronger than that of the Earth, although 30 times weaker than that of Jupiter. Saturn is unique inasmuch as its rotational axis and magnetic axis are almost coincident; the magnetic field is therefore reasonably straightforward and axisymmetric, and the magnetosphere is much less active than that of Jupiter. The field seems to be slightly stronger at the north pole than at the south, and the centre of the field is displaced about 2400 km northward along the planet’s axis. The magnetosphere is about one-fifth the size of that of Jupiter; the bow shock lies at a range of about 60 300 km 174 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"S ATURN from the planet, and has a thickness of about 2000 km. Saturn does have radiation zones; the magnetosphere traps radiation belt particles, which extend as far as the outer edge of the main ring system. The numbers of electrons fall off quicklyattheouteredgeofRingA,becausetheelectronsare absorbed by the ring particles; the region between Ring A and the globe is probably the most radiation-free zone in the entire Solar System. There is no doubt a very extensive ‘magnetotail’. All the inner satellites are embedded in the magnetosphere. The outer boundary is somewhat variable, and is located close to the orbit of Titan, so that Titan is sometimes just inside the main magnetosphere and sometimes just outside it. Auroræ occur on Saturn, and because the magnetic and the rotational poles are almost coincidental the ‘auroral ovals’ are centred on the poles. Initial observations were made from Pioneer 11 in 1979, and from 1980 auroræ were detected from a series of spectroscopic observations from the IUE (International Ultra-violet Explorer) satellite; the northern oval was first imaged from the Hubble Space Telescope in June 1992. A huge auroral curtain was found to rise as far as 2000 km above the cloud tops on 9 October 1994, when Saturn was 1300 000 000 km from the Earth. R INGS Telescopically, Saturn’s rings make it probably the most beautiful object in the entire sky. A small instrument will show them well when they are suitably placed, although most of our detailed knowledge about them has been obtained from space probes. Essentially, the rings are made up of innumerable particles and ‘icebergs’, ranging in size from fine dust to small houses. They are composed of loosely packed snowballs of water ice, although slight colour effects indicate that there may be a small amount of rocky material. The total mass of the ring system is surprisingly small; if all the particles could be combined, they would make up a satellite no more than 300 km across at most. Although they are very extensive – the main system has a total diameter of over 270 000 km – they are very thin; the thickness cannot be more than 200 m, and is probably less. It has been said that if a model of the system were made from material the Figure 10.1. The rings of Saturn. thickness of a 10p coin, the overall diameter would be of the order of 15–20 km. The origin of the ring system is uncertain. It may have been produced from material ‘left over’, so to speak, when Saturn itself was formed, or it may have been due to the break-up of a former icy satellite which wandered too close to the planet and was literally torn apart. Certainly the rings lie wholly within the Roche limit from Saturn. The rings are much more complex than was believed before the Pioneer and Voyager missions. Instead of being more or less homogeneous, they have been found to be made up of thousands of small ringlets and narrow gaps. An ingenious experiment was carried out from Voyager 2, in 1981. As seen from the space-craft, the third-magnitude star Delta Scorpii was occulted by the rings. It had been expected that there would be comparatively few ‘winks’, as the starlight would shine through any gaps but would be blocked by ring material. In fact thousands of ‘blips’ were recorded, and it seems that there is very little empty space anywhere in the main ring system. Details of the rings are given in Table 10.5. The so-called Ring D is not a true ring, and has no sharpinneredge; theparticlesmayextenddownwardalmost to the cloud tops. Ring C, the Cr ˆ epe or Dusky Ring, is over 17 000 km wide and has various gaps, including two with widths of 200 and 300 km respectively; the outer gap contains a narrow, denser and slightly eccentric bright ring, THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 175"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"S ATURN Table 10.5.

On average, the C-ring particles seem to be abou t2min diameter. The main ring is, of course, Ring B, where the particles range in size from 10 cm to about 1 m.

It has also been found that there is a cloudofneutralhydrogenextendingto60 000kmaboveand below the ring plane. Voyager images showed strange radial spokes in the B ring – incidentally, shown many years earlier in drawings made by E. E. Barnard and E. M. Antoniadi – and these are decidedly puzzling, because logically no such features should form; the difference in rotation period between the inner and the outer edges of the ring is over 176 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"S ATURN 3 h – and yet the spokes persisted for hours after emerging from the shadow of the globe; when they were distorted and broken up, new spokes emerged from the shadow to replace them. Presumably they are due to particles of a certain definite size elevated away from the ring plane by magnetic or electrostatic forces. They are confined wholly to Ring B. The 4700 km wide Cassini Division is not empty, but contains many rings a few hundred kilometres wide, one of which is markedly eccentric. The particles are less red than those of Ring B, and more closely resemble those of Ring C. Ring A is made up of particles ranging from fine grains up to about 10 m across. Encke’s Division, in Ring A, is notable because it contains a tiny satellite, Pan; the satellite Atlas moves close to the outer edge of Ring A, and is responsible for the sharp border of the ring. (Incidentally, the Encke Division has been referred to as the Keeler Gap, but it has now, very properly, been decided that the old, familiar name would be retained; three other narrow gaps in the ring system have been named Huygens, Maxwell and Keeler.) Outside the main system comes the irregular Ring F, which has been described as a convoluted tangle of narrow strands. It is stabilized by two small satellites, Prometheus andPandora, toeithersideofitscentre. Thesatelliteslightly closer to Saturn (Prometheus, at the present time) will be moving faster than the ring particles, and will speed up a particle which strays away from the main system; the outer satellite, moving more slowly, will drag any errant particles back and return them to the central region. For obvious reasons, these two tiny moons are referred to as ‘shepherd satellites’. Beyond Ring F and its shepherds come the two co- orbital satellites, Epimetheus and Janus. Next there is the very tenuous Ring G. The final ring, E, is 300 000 km wide, but very tenuous indeed, and it has even been said that it is made up of slight condensations of d ́ ebris in the orbital plane of the satellites. Its brightest part is slightly closer-in than the orbit of Enceladus, and it is possible that material ejected from Enceladus may be concerned in the formation of the ring. Ring E extends out beyond the orbit of Tethys, and almost as far as the orbit of Dione. Why are the rings so complex? The Cassini Division had been explained as being due to the satellite Mimas; a particle moving in the Division will have an orbital period half that of Mimas, and cumulative perturbations should drive it away from the ‘forbidden zone’, leaving the Division swept clear. Yet the Voyagers have shown that this explanation is clearly inadequate, and it now seems more likely that we are dealing with a density-wave effect. A satellite such as Mimas can alter the orbit of a ring particle and make it elliptical. This causes ‘bunching’ in various areas; a spiral density wave will be created, and particles in it will collide, moving inward toward the planet and leaving a gap just outside the resonance orbit. This theory, due to Peter Goldreich and Scott Tremaine, does sound plausible, but it would be wrong to claim that we yet really understand the mechanics of the ring system. S PACE M ISSIONS T O S ATURN Four space-craft have so far been launched to Saturn. Data are given in Table 10.6. The first probe was Pioneer 11. Its prime target had been Jupiter, but the success of its predecessor, Pioneer 10, and the fact that there was adequate power reserve meant that it could be swung back across the Solar System to a rendezvous with Saturn in 1979. The results were preliminary only, but involved several important discoveries. Perhaps the most significant fact was that Pioneer was not destroyed by a ring particle collision; at that time nobody knew what conditions near Saturn would be like and estimates of the probe’s chances of survival ranged from 1% to 99%. Voyager 1, launched in 1977, surveyed Jupiter in 1979 and then went on to Saturn. It was a complete success, and obtained new data about the rings and satellites as well as the planet itself. One of its prime targets was Titan, already known to have an atmosphere; it was a surprise to find that the main constituent of this atmosphere was nitrogen. Voyager 1 then began a never-ending journey out of the Solar System; as I write these words (2000) it is still in touch. Voyager 2 came next. This time Titan was not surveyed in detail; this would have meant that the probe would have been unable to go on to Uranus and Neptune. Again the mission was a complete success, and both the outer planets were also encountered. Like its predecessor, THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 177"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"S ATURN Table 10.6.

Voyager 2 is now leaving the Solar System permanently. Its success was all the more striking because one of the main instruments failed early in the mission, and Voyager 2 operated throughout on its back-up system. The Cassini–Huygens mission was launched on 15 October 1997, from Cape Canaveral, using a Titan- 4B/Centaur rocket. The gravity-assist technique has to be used, involving swing-bys of Venus (21 April 1998), Venus again (20 June 1999), Earth (16 August 1999) and Jupiter (30 December 2000). The probe will be put into Saturn orbit on 1 July 2004, only 20 000 km above the cloud tops, to begin the first of 74 planned orbits. On 6 November 2004 the space-craft will be manœuvred into an impact trajectory with Titan, and on 8 November the Huygens lander will be released; Cassini itself will be deflected away from a collision course, leaving Huygens to land on Titan 18 . 4 ◦ north of the satellite’s equator. The descent through Titan’s atmosphere will take 2 1 2 h; on landing, data will, it is hoped, be received for up to half an hour. After that the Cassini orbiter, being used as a relay, will pass out of range – and before it is again suitably positioned, Huygens will be dead. Cassini itself will continue to orbit Saturn until July 2008, sending back data of all kinds. It is indeed an ambitious mission; let us hope that it will be successful. S ATELLITES Saturn has a wealth of satellites. Eighteen are definitely known, and others have been suspected. In April 1861 H. Goldschmidt announced that he had found a satellite moving between the orbits of Hyperion and Iapetus, and named it Chiron; in 1904 W. H. Pickering claimed that he had found a satellite moving between the orbits of Titan and Hyperion, and named it Themis. Neither of these satellites was confirmed, and neither seems to exist, but no doubt other very small attendants await discovery. Details of the known satellites are given in Table 10.7. Pan . This tiny satellite was found on photographs taken by the Voyager 2 probe; it was discovered by M. Showalter in 1990. ItmoveswithintheEnckeDivisioninSaturn’sAring. It is presumably icy, but nothing definite is known about its composition. It was named after the half-man/half-goat son of Hermes and Dyope. Atlas . This satellite was named after the Titan who carried the sky on his shoulders. It lies near the edge of Ring A, and may act as a ‘shepherd’. It was identified, by R. Terrile, on Voyager images. Nothing is known about its physical condition, but again it is presumably icy. Prometheus and Pandora . These F-ring shepherd satellites were identified, by S. Collins and his team, on Voyager images. Both seem to be of low density, so that ice is a major constituent. Both are cratered; Prometheus shows a number of ridges and valleys, as well as craters up to 20 km across, while Pandora lacks visible ridges, but does show two 30 km craters. Prometheus was the brother of Atlas, who gave humanity the gift of fire; Pandora, made of clay by Hephæstus at the request of Zeus (Jupiter), opened a box which set free all the ills which plague mankind today.

Enceladus. Enceladus . Named by John Herschel after a Titan, who was crushed in a battle with the Olympian gods; earth was piled on top of him and became the island of Sicily. Enceladus is very different from Mimas – or from any other Saturnian satellite. Instead of one huge crater, we find several completely different types of terrain. Craters exist in many areas, but give the impression of being fairly young and sharp, while there is an extensive plain which is almost crater-free and is instead dominated by long grooves. Its density is very low, and it is more reflective than any other satellite, so that the surface is exceptionally cold ( − 201 ◦ C). Surprisingly, Enceladus may be active, and we may well have an example of ‘cryovulcanism’ – the icy equivalent of what we always call volcanic action.Certainly the surface seems to be very young, so that presumably it has been re-surfaced, and any large craters obliterated. We have to explain the paucity of craters over wide areas, and it may be that the interior is flexed by the tidal forces of Saturn and the outer, much more massive satellite Dione, whose orbital period is twice that of Enceladus. If so, there may be periods when soft ice or even water wells up over the surface. Selected features, named from the Arabian Nights, are listed in Table 10.9. It is possible that Enceladus may be the main source of Saturn E ring, so that it is in every way exceptional. Table 10.9. Selected list of features on Enceladus.

Most of our detailed knowledge of Tethys comes from Voyager 2 (Voyager 1 did not make a close approach), and it is unfortunate that some data were lost when Voyager 2 developed a temporary fault after it had started its journey from Saturn to Uranus. Tethys seems to be made up of almost pure ice; the surface temperature is − 187 ◦ C. There is one huge crater, Odysseus, with a diameter of 400 km – larger than Mimas. It is not very deep, and the curve of its floor follows the general shape of the globe. There are many other craters, notably Penelope, but the main feature is a huge trench, Ithaca Chasma, 2000 km long, running from near the north pole across the equator and along to the south polar region. Nothing similar is known in the Solar System. It was presumably formed when the water inside Tethys froze, expanding as it did so and fracturing the crust. It extends three-quarters of the way round Tethys; it is over 60 km wide and 4–6 km deep, with a rim rising to 0.5 km above the surrounding terrain. Table 10.10. Selected list of features on Tethys.

Dione. Dione . Dione, named after the sister of Cronos and mother (by Zeus) of Aphrodite, is of special interest, because although little larger than Tethys it is much denser and more massive. It is indeed denser than any other Saturnian satellite apart from Titan, and there are suspicions that it may have an effect on Saturn’s radio emission, since there seems to be a radio cycle of 2.7 days – which is also the orbital period of Dione. Moreover, as noted, Dione may also play a r ˆ ole in flexing the interior of Enceladus, whose revolution period is almost exactly half that of Dione. Surface features are named from Virgil’s Æneid; a selected list is given in Table 10.11. The surface is not uniform. The trailing hemisphere is relatively dark, with an albedo of 0.3, while the brightest features on the leading hemisphere have an albedo of 0.6. Most of the heavily cratered terrain lies on the trailing hemi- sphere. OneveryprominentfeatureisAmata, whichmaybe either a crater or a basin; its precise nature is uncertain, but it is associated with a system of bright wispy features which extend over the trailing hemisphere and are accompanied by narrow linear troughs and ridges. These wispy features have been produced by bright, new ice which has seeped out from the interior, so that in the past Dione seems to have been much more active than Tethys or Rhea.

Surface features are named after creation myths. A selected list is given in Table 10.12. Rhea is heavily cratered, but there are few really large formations, and craters tend to be rather irregular. As with Dione, the trailing hemisphere is the darker of the two, and there are wispy features, although not nearly so prominent as those of Dione. It has been found that there are two distinct types of terrain; the first contains craters over 40 km across, while the second area, in parts of the polar and equatorial regions, is characterized by craters of smaller size. Possibly an early cratering period produced the larger structures; there was then a period of resurfacing, presumably by material welling up from below, and then a second cratering era. On the leading hemisphere there is one ray-centre. Rhea seems to have a rocky core, around which most of the material is ice. There has certainly been no activity for a very long time. A small telescope is capable of showing Rhea. An interesting observations was made on 8 April 1921 by six English observers independently: A. E. Levin, P.W.Hepburn, L.J.Comrie, E.A.L.Attkins, F.Burnerdand C. J. Spencer. Rhea was eclipsed by the shadow of Titan, Table 10.12. Selected list of features on Rhea.

Titan . Titan, discovered and named by Huygens in 1655, is the largest of Saturn’s satellites, and the largest satellite in the Solar System apart from Ganymede. It is the only satellite to have a substantial atmosphere. 184 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"S ATURN The first suggestion of an atmosphere came in 1908, when the Spanish astronomer J. Comas Sol ` a reported limb darkening effects (essentially the same as those of the Sun). The existence of the atmosphere was proved spectroscopically in 1944 by G. P. Kuiper, but it was tacitly assumed that the main constituent would be methane, and that the density would be low; after all, the escape velocity is only 2.65 km s − 1 , little more than that of our virtually airless Moon. As Voyager 1 approached Saturn’s system, in November 1980, astronomers were still divided as to whether any surface details would be seen on Titan, or whether there would be too much cloud. In the event, no details were seen; Titan is permanently shrouded beneath its orange clouds. The northern hemisphere was observed to be the darker of the two, and there were vague indications of ‘banding’, but that was all. However, important discoveries were made. The atmosphere proved to be mainly composed of nitrogen, with a little methane and traces of other compounds. The ground pressure was given as 1.5 times that of the Earth’s air at sea level (the latest value is 1.6), and the temperature on the surface was − 178 ◦ C. Voyager 2 did not image Titan from close range, because of the need to go on to Uranus and Neptune, but from 1994 images have been obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope, in the near infra-red, showing brighter and darker areas; one prominent bright feature is 4000 km across – about the size of Australia. It must be some sort of solid surface feature. Other bright and dark regions could be continents or oceans. If there are seas or ponds on Titan, they will certainly not be of water; they will be chemical – made of ethane, methane or a mixture of both. Excellent images of Titan have been obtained since 1996 by S. Gibbard and her colleagues, with the 10 m Keck I telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Using speckle inter- ferometry techniques at 1.5 to 2.5 μ m, Titan’s hazy atmo- sphere was penetrated, revealing a mottled surface. It was suggested that the infra-red-dark areas might be basins filled withmethane, ethane, orotherhydrocarbonsthatprecipitate out of the atmosphere; the bright regions could be a mixture of rock and water ice, washed clear of organic material. Nitrogen makes up about 90% of the atmosphere, and most of the rest is methane, plus a little argon and traces of hydrogen, hydrocarbons and nitrogen and oxygen compounds. At the top of Titan’s troposphere, at an altitude of 40 km above the surface, there are clouds of methane; above this, in the stratosphere, comes the ‘haze’, and this extends to about 200 km, with a detached and more tenuous second layer 100 km higher. It is not likely that there is a global ocean, but liquid areas are very probable. When the Huygens probe lands there, in 2004, it may come down on solid ground or alteratively splash down in a chemical ocean which could even have waves. The surface temperature is close to the triple point of methane, so that there may even be methane cliffs, seas of liquid methane and a methane rain dripping down from the orange clouds above. At this low temperature, H 2 O ice will be as hard as conventional rock. The globe is probably made up of a rocky core, sur- rounded by a mantle of liquid water with some dissolved ammonia and methane, above which comes the crust. How- ever, we have to admit that our information is still fragmen- tary, and if Huygens is successful we may be prepared for many surprises. The one thing we can say with confidence is that Titan is unlike any other world in the Solar System. Hyperion . Hyperion, named for one of the Titans, is in many ways unusual. It is irregular in shape; this is strange, since an object of this size would be expected to be regular in form. To make matters even more puzzling, the longer axis does not point directly at Saturn, as dynamically it ought to do, and the rotation period is chaotic, changing from one orbit to another. On average, the rotation period is of the order of 13 days. It may well be that Hyperion is part of a larger body which broke up, but there is no sign of the rest of such a body. Hyperion is less reflective than the other icy satellites, and seems to have an old surface with what may be called ‘dirty ice’. There are several craters, with diameters up to 120 km, and one long ridge or scarp, extending to 300 km, which has been named Bond-Lassell in honour of the discoverers of Hyperion in 1858. (Bond actually found the satellite first, but Lassell’s confirmation shortly afterwards was independent.) Features on Hyperion are named after solar and lunar deities; a short selected list is given in Table 10.13. Hyperion is not an easy telescopic object. The best time to locate it is when it is in conjunction with Titan. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 185"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"S ATURN Figure 10.7. Hyperion. (Copyright by Calvin J. Hamilton.)

Iapetus, named for yet another of the Titans, was found by G. D. Cassini in 1671. He soon noticed that it is very variable. When west of Saturn it is an easy telescopic object, but when to the east it is much fainter, and at first Cassini assumed (wrongly) that it disappeared for a time during each of its 79-day orbits. In fact, the magnitude drops from almost 10 down to little brighter than 12. The reason is that the two hemispheres have different albedoes. The leading hemisphere is as black as a blackboard, while the trailing hemisphere is bright and icy. The demarcation line is not abrupt; there is a 200–300 km transition zone. Some craters have dark floors, but unfortunately we do not know whether or not the material is the same as that which covers the leading hemisphere. In view of the low density of Iapetus, it seems certain that the satellite itself is bright and icy, so that the dark material is a coating of some kind. There have been suggestions that the dark material has been wafted on to Iapetus from the outermost satellite, Phœbe, but this seems unlikely, partly because Phœbe is so small and distant and partly because the material is not quite the same colour. We also have to explain the dark floors of craters in the bright regions. Presumably, then, the dark material has welled out from below the surface. We know nothing about its depth. Carl Sagan once suggested that it might be thick and made up of organics, while others believe that it may be no more than a few millimetres deep. Obviously we know little about the dark areas, but the bright regions contain craters of the usual type, named from the Charlemagne period. A selected list is given in Table 10.14. It is worth noting that future space-travellers will see Saturn well from Iapetus, because the rings will not always be edgewise-on. The orbital inclination is over 14 ◦ , and Sat- urn will indeed be a glorious object in the Iapetan sky. All the inner satellites move virtually in the plane of the rings. 186 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"S ATURN Figure 10.8. Iapetus. Table 10.14.

The opposition magnitude does not vary a great deal; the planet can just be seen with the naked eye under good conditions. The most recent aphelion passage was that of 1 April 1925; Uranus was at its maximum distance from the Earth (21.09 a.u.) on 13 March of that year. The next aphelion will be that of 27 February 2009. The last perihelion passage was on 20 May 1966; Uranus was at its closest to the Earth (17.29 a.u.) on 9 March of that year. The next perihelion will be that of 13 August 2050. Table 11.2.

On 4 October 1832 Thomas Henderson, from the Cape of Good Hope, observed an occultation. E ARLY O BSERVATIONS Uranus was seen on a number of occasions before its identification in 1781. It was recorded on 23 December 1690 by the Astronomer Royal, John Flamsteed, when it was in Taurus; Flamsteed even gave it a stellar number – 34 Tauri. Altogether 22 pre-discovery observations have been listed, as follows: Flamsteed, 1690, 1712, four times in 1715; J. Bradley, 1748 and 1750; P. Le Monnier, twice in 1750, 1764, twice in 1768, six times in 1769, 1771; T. Mayer, 1756. It is interesting that Le Monnier failed to identify Uranus from its movement. He observed it eight times in four weeks (27 December 1768 to 23 January 1769) without realizing that it was anything other than a star. He has often been ridiculed for this, but when he made his observations Uranus was near its stationary point, so it is hardly surprising that Le Monnier failed to identify it. D ISCOVERY A ND N AMING Uranus was discovered on 13 March 1781 by William Herschel, using a 6.2 inch (15.7 cm) reflector of 7 ft focal length and a magnification of × 227. Herschel realized that the object – in Gemini – was not a star, but he believed it to be a comet, and indeed his communication to the Royal Society was headed An Account of a Comet . The object was first recognized as a planet, independently but about the same time, by the French amateur astronomer de Saron – later, in 1794, guillotined during the Revolution – and by the Finnish mathematician Anders Lexell. Lexell calculated an orbit, finding that the distance of the planet from the Sun was 19 a.u. – only slightly too small. He gave an orbital period of between 82 and 83 years, and stated that the apparent diameter was between 3 and 5 arcsec. In this case it was clear that Uranus was indeed a giant world, larger than any other planet apart from Jupiter and Saturn. There was prolonged discussion over naming. J. E. Bode, in 1781, suggested Uranus, after the first ruler of Olympus (Uranus or Ouranos, Saturn’s father). Other names were proposed – for example Hypercronius (J. Bernoulli, 1781) and ‘the Georgian Planet’, by Herschel himself in honour of his patron, King George III. Others called it simply ‘Herschel’. Until 1850 the Nautical Almanac continued to call it the Georgian Planet, but in that year the famous mathematician and astronomer John Couch Adams suggested changing over to ‘Uranus’. This was done, and the name became universally accepted. D IAMETER A ND R OTATION Thefirstattempttomeasuretheapparentdiameterwasmade by Herschel in 1781. His value (4 \u0002\u0002 . 18) was rather too great. In 1788 he gave the diameter as 34 217 miles (55 067 km) with a mass 17.7 times that of the Earth; these values also were slightly too high. In 1792–4 Herschel also made an attempt to measure the polar flattening, and from his results rightly concluded that the rotation period must be short. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 189"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"U RANUS In 1856 J. Houzeau, in France, gave a rotation period of between 7 1 4 and 12 1 2 h; later, before the results from space-craft became available, the favoured period was 10 h 48 min, which is in fact decidedly too short. Uranus is unique in one respect; its axial inclination is more than a right angle, so that the rotation is technically retrograde, although not usually classed as such. From Earth, the equator of Uranus is regularly presented, as in 1923 and 1966; at other times a pole is presented – the south pole in 1901 and 1985, the north pole in 1946 and 2030. All this leads to a very peculiar Uranian calendar. Each pole has a ‘night’ lasting for 21 Earth years, with corresponding daylight at the opposite pole. For the rest of the orbital period conditions are less extreme. The reason for this unique tilt is unclear. There have been suggestions that in its early career Uranus was struck by a massive impactor and literally knocked sideways. This does not sound very plausible, but it is not easy to think of anything better. (There is, incidentally, some confusion about Uranus’ poles. The International Astronomical Union has decreed that all poles above the ecliptic (i.e. the plane of the Earth’s orbit) are north poles, while all poles below the ecliptic are south poles. In this case it was Uranus’ south pole which was in sunlight during the pass of the Voyager 2 space probe in 1986. However, the Voyager team members reversed this and referred to the sunlit pole as the north pole. Take your pick!) S URFACE M ARKINGS F ROM E ARTH In ordinary telescopes Uranus appears as a bland, rather greenishdisk. Twobrightspotswerereportedon25January 1870 by J. Buffham, using a power of × 320 on a 9 inch (23 cm) refractor; on 19 March he described a bright streak. It seems improbable that these were genuine features, although of course one cannot be sure. From Earth, even really large telescopes show virtually no surface details on Uranus. Spectroscopic observations were made from 1869, when Angelo Secchi, from Italy, recorded dark lines in the spectrum; the lines were photographed in 1869 by W. Huggins and in 1902 H. Deslandres, from France, obtained spectroscopic confirmation of the retrograde rotation. Final confirmation of this was provided in 1911 by P. Lowell and V. M. Slipher, from the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, although their derived rotation period was several hours too short. Meanwhile, very precise tables of the movements of Uranus had been compiled in 1875 by Simon Newcomb in America; earlier, in 1846, slight irregularities in the movements of Uranus had been used to identify the outer giant, Neptune, by J. Galle and H. D’Arrest, from Berlin. Methane was identified in Uranus’ atmosphere in 1933, by R. Mecke from Heidelberg; it had been suggested, on theoretical grounds, by R. Wildt in 1932. Confirmation was obtained by V. M. Slipher and A. Adel, from Flagstaff, in 1934. By then it had become clear that Uranus, like Jupiter and Saturn, was not a miniature sun; the outer layers at least were very cold indeed, and the visible surface was purely gaseous. The first widely-accepted model of Uranus was that of R. Wildt, who in 1934 proposed that the planet must have a rocky core, overlaid with a thick layer of ice which was in turn overlaid by a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. In 1951 W. R. Ramsey, of Manchester University, proposed an alternative model, according to which Uranus was made up largely of methane, ammonia and water. However, reliable information was delayed until the mission of Voyager 2, the only probe so far to have by-passed the planet. V OYAGER 2 It is not too much to say that most of our detailed knowledge of Uranus comes from Voyager 2, although in recent years good data have also been obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope. Voyager 2 was launched on 20 August 1977 (actually before Voyager 1). It by-passed Jupiter on 9 July 1979 and Saturn on 25 August 1981. It then went on to Uranus (24 January 1986) and finally Neptune (25 August 1989). Excellent images were obtained of all four giants, together with a mass of data. Voyager 2 is now leaving the Solar System, but was still in contact in 2000. Because of Uranus’ unusual tilt, Voyager 2 approached the planet more or less ‘pole-on’. New satellites were discovered, and known satellites surveyed; studies were made of the Uranian magnetosphere, and radio waves were detected. Ultra-violet observation showed strong emissions 190 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"U RANUS on the day side of the planet, producing what was termed an ‘electroglow’. On ‘encounter day’, 24 January, Voyager passed 107 100 km from the centre of the planet – that is to say, must over 80 000 km from the cloud tops. Closest approach occurred at 17h 59m UT. The Uranian equator was then in twilight, and it was found that the temperatures at the poles and over the rest of the planet were much the same. C ONSTITUTION O F U RANUS One important fact is that Uranus, unlike the other giant planets, seems to have little internal heat. Jupiter radiates 1.7 times as much energy as it would do if it depended entirely upon what it receives from the Sun; Saturn radiates 1.8 times as much and Neptune over 2. With Uranus, the upper limit is only 1.06, but with a possible uncertainty of 1 – so that there may be no excess energy at all. Moreover, the temperatures of Uranus and Neptune as measured from Earth are almost equal, even though Neptune is so much further away from the Sun. Uranus is made largely of ‘ices’, but it is to be noted that these may not be in solid form. For planetary scientists, ‘gas’ is taken to mean helium and helium; ‘ices’ a solar mixture of water (H 2 O), methane (CH 4 ) and ammonia (NH 4 ), with traces of other substances; water is the most abundant of the ices. ‘Rock’ is a mix of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ), magnesium oxide (MgO) and either metallic iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni), or compounds of iron such as FeS and FeO. Inside planets such as Uranus and Neptune, the pressure and temperature conditions make all these materials behave as liquids. The outer atmosphere is made up chiefly of hydrogen (probably 83% by number of molecules) and helium (15%); methane accounts for 2%, so that there are only traces of other substances. Methane freezes out at a very low temperature, and forms a thick cloud layer, above which comes the predominantly hydrogen atmosphere. Methane absorbs red light, which is why Uranus appears bluish- green. Minor constituents include acetylene (C 2 H 2 ) and ethane (C 2 H 6 ), which play a r ˆ ole in forming ‘hazes’. Below the atmosphere come the ‘ices’, and then a relatively small rocky core at a temperature of perhaps between 6000 and 7000 ◦ C. However, we have to admit that our knowledge of the inner structure of Uranus is very fragmentary, and there is no definite proof that a rocky core exists, although it very probably does. Voyager 2 detected few clouds, but in recent years cloud observations have been made with the Hubble Space Telescope. Good images were obtained in July to August 1997; these showed clouds in the northern hemisphere, which is now starting its ‘spring’ season – when Voyager 2 flew over the north pole it had been winter there, with the pole in total darkness. It has been found that features at different latitudes have rotation periods of between 14 and 17 h, so that there are winds blowing in an east–west direction; at high latitudes (around 60 ◦ ) these are prograde, although there is a retrograde jet stream close to the equator. Observations made in 1998 with the Hubble Space Tele- scope recorded waves of massive storms on Uranus, with windspeeds in excess of 500 kilometres per hour; clearly the planet is much more dynamic than was originally thought. Obviously, the axial tilt means that wind conditions on Uranus are different from those on any other planet. Radiation belts round Uranus exist; their intensity is similar to those round Saturn, but they differ in composition. They seem to be dominated by hydrogen ions; heavier ions are lacking. M AGNETIC F IELD Uranus has a magnetic field; the equatorial field strength at the equator is 0.25 G, as against 4.28 G for Jupiter (the value for Earth is 0.305 G). However, the magnetic axis is displaced from the rotational axis by 58 ◦ . 6; neither does the magnetic axis pass through the centre of the globe – it is offset by 8000 km. The polarity is opposite to that of the Earth. The fact that the magnetic and the rotational poles are nowhere near each other means that auroræ, which were detected from Voyager 2, are a long way from the rotational pole. The magnetosphere of Uranus is relatively ‘empty’; itextendsto590 000kmonthedaysideandaround 6000 000 km on the night side. The reason for the tilt of the magnetic is unknown. It was initially thought that Uranus might be experiencing a ‘magnetic reversal’, but subsequently it was found that the magnetic axis of Neptune was also displaced – and to assume that two reversals were occurring simultaneously would be too much of a coincidence. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 191"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"U RANUS T HE R INGS The discovery of the ring system of Uranus was accidental. It had been predicted that on 10 March 1977 the planet would occult the star SAO 158687, magnitude 8.9, and the occultation would provide a good opportunity to measure the diameter of Uranus. Calculations made by Gordon Taylor of the Royal Greenwich Observatory indicated that the occultation would be seen only from a restricted area in the southern hemisphere, and observations were made by J. Elliott, T. Dunham and D. Mink, flying at 12.5 km above the southern Indian Ocean in the Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO), which was in fact a modified C-141 aircraft carrying a 36 inch (91 cm) reflecting telescope. Close watches were also being kept from ground-based observatories, notably in South Africa. 35 min before occultation the star was seen by the KAO observers to ‘wink’ five times, so that apparently it was being temporarily obscured by material in the vicinity of Uranus. The occultation by Uranus began at 20.52 UT, and lasted for 25 min. After emersion there were more winks, and these were later found to be symmetrical with the first set, indicating a system of rings. The post- emersion winks were also recorded by J. Churms from South Africa. Subsequent observations provided full confirmation. In 1978 G. Neugebauer and his colleagues imaged the rings with the Hale reflector at Palomar and in 1984 D. A. Allen, at Siding Spring, imaged them in infra-red, using the Anglo–Australian Telescope. They were surveyed in detail by Voyager 2 and also studied from the Hubble Space Telescope. Details of the system are given in Table 11.4. The outermost ring – the \u001e ring – is not symmetrical, and is narrowest when closest to Uranus; the satellites Cordelia and Ophelia, discovered by Voyager 2, act as ‘shepherds’ to it. There is little obvious dust in the main rings, but Voyager 2 took a final picture, on its outward journey from Uranus, when the planet hid the Sun, showing 200 very diffuse, nearly transparent bands of microscopic dust surrounding the system. The rings are made up of particles a few metres in diameter, with not many centimetre- and millimetre-sized particles; they are as dark as coal, and it has been suggested, although without proof, that they may be relatively young and perhaps not even Table 11.4.

Their thickness is from about 0.1 to 1 km. The rings are not alike. 6, 5 and 4 show significant internal structure. Rings α and β lack sharp edges. Ring η does not show sensible inclination to Uranus’ orbital plane, and is made up of two component s – a sharp inner feature, and a much fainter one, which extends to about 55 km from the sharp feature. Both edges of the γ ring are sharp, while with the δ ring there is a faint component inside the main ring. Ring λ was discovered between the δ and \u001e rings; it is very thin and apparently circular. In addition to the 10 rings, there is a broad sheet of material closer-in than Ring 6, extending from 37 000 to 39 500 km from Uranus. It is worth recalling that in 1787, a few years after his discovery of Uranus, William Herschel reported the existence of a ring; he was using his 20 ft focus reflector on 4 March, and reported the ring again on 22 February 1789. He described the ring as ‘short, not like that of Saturn’. In fact he was being temporarily misled by optical effects; no telescope of that period could possibly show the true rings, and by the end of 1793 Herschel himself had realized that his ‘ring’ did not exist. Certainly the ring system of Uranus is interesting, but there can be no comparison with the glorious, icy rings of Saturn. 192 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"U RANUS Table 11.5.

Five were known before the Voyager 2 mission; Voyager added 10 more and another two with the Canada–France–Hawaii telescope on Mauna Kea. Since then two outer satellites have been detected from Palomar and another two have been suspected. Data are given in Table 11.5. The first to be discovered were Oberon and Titania, by William Herschel in 1787. Both were seen on 11 January, although Herschel delayed making any announcement until he was certain of their nature. Between 1790 and 1802 Herschel claimed to have found four more satellites, but three of these are certainly non-existent; the fourth may have been Umbriel, but there is considerable uncertainty. Ariel and Umbriel were discovered on 24 October 1851 by the English amateur William Lassell (previous observations by Lassell in 1847 had been inconclusive). In 1894, 1897 and 1899 W. H. Pickering unsuccessfully searched for new satellites. The next satellite to be detected photographically from Earth was Miranda, on 16 February 1948, with the 82 inch reflector at the McDonald Observatory in Texas. Next, on 31 October 1997, P. Nicholson, J. Burns, B. Gladman and J. J. Kavelaars, using a CCD on the 5 m Hale Telescope at Palomar, found the outermost THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 193"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"U RANUS satellites, Caliban and Sycorax. In 1999 J. J. Kavelaars and his colleagues, using the 3.58 m Canada–France–Hawaii telescope on Mauna Kea, announced the discovery of two more small outer satellites, bringing the grand total to 20 – more than for any other planet. No doubt all these small outer satellites are asteroidal. The names of the first four satellites were suggested by Sir John Herschel: two Shakesperean, one (Ariel) from both Shakespeare and Pope’s Rape of the Lock , and Umbriel from Rape of the Lock . The name ‘Miranda’ was proposed by Kuiper and the names of the 10 new inner and the two new outer satellites were adopted by the International Astronomical Union. Many critics feel that this departure from conventional mythology is undesirable, and should not be regarded as a precedent. Cordelia . The innermost and smallest of the Voyager 2 discoveries. It is named after the daughter of King Lear, in the play King Lear . It acts as the inner ‘shepherd’ for the \u001e ring. Like all the Voyager 2 satellites, it is presumably icy, but nothing definite is known about its composition. Ophelia . Named after the daughter of Polonius, in the play Hamlet . It is the outer ‘shepherd’ for the \u001e ring and is slightly brighter and larger than the inner shepherd, Cordelia. Next, beyond the ring system but of course within the magnetosphere, come eight icy satellites: Bianca (named after the sister of Katherine in the play The Taming of the Shrew ); Cressida (Calchas’ daughter, in Troilus and Cressida ); Desdemona (Othello’s wife, in Othello ); Juliet (the heroine in Romeo and Juliet ); Portia (wife of Brutus, in Julius Cæsar ); Rosalind (the Duke’s daughter, in As You Like It ); Belinda (the heroine in The Rape of the Lock ); Puck (from A Midsummer Night’s Dream ). Of these, Puck was the first to be detected, on 30 December 1985, as Voyager 2 drew in toward Uranus. On 24 January 1986 – ‘encounter day ’ – a single image of it was obtained from a range of 500 000 km. The resolution is of the order of 10 km. Puck proved to be roughly spherical, with a low albedo. Three craters were recorded and were named Bogle, Lob and Butz after various mischievous spirits of the Puck variety. Miranda . Voyager 2 passed Miranda at only 3000 km, so that the surface features were imaged down to a resolution of 600 m. This was fortunate, because Miranda is indeed a remarkable world. Surface feature names are again Shakespearean. The measured temperature is given as − 187 ◦ C, and the surface is icy. Naturally, only one hemisphere could be studied; the other was in darkness. The landscape is amazingly varied, and there are several distinct types of terrain: old, cratered plains, brighter areas with cliffs and scarps, and ‘ovoids’ or coronæ, large, trapezoidal-shaped regions; one of these, Inverness Corona, was nicknamed ‘the chevron’, while another, Arden Corona, was ‘the race-track’. The cliffs may tower to 20 km; large craters are lacking, but there are fault valleys, parallel ridges and graben up to 15 km across. A selected list of surface features is given in Table 11.6. Miranda presents real problems of interpretation. It has been suggested that it has been shattered and re-formed several times, because the various types of terrain seem to havebeenformedatdifferentperiods, butthiswouldinvolve considerable heating, which in view of Miranda’s small size and icy nature does not sound probable.

The surface is darker than those of the other main satellites; there are no ray-craters. Unfortunately the best image was taken when Voyager was still 557 000 km from Umbriel, so that the resolution is no better than 10 km. (See Table 11.8.) The brightest crater, Skynd, has a central peak; other craters have darker floors, and since Umbriel is presumably icy there has been a surface coating of some kind. Wunda, at the edge of the image, is of uncertain nature; it is close to the equator (remember that Umbriel, like Uranus itself, was being imaged almost pole-on) and appears to be a ring, but it it so badly foreshortened that its form cannot be made out, and we cannot be sure that it is a crater at all.

(It is reported that Nicholson wanted to name one of them Squeaker, after his cat, but Shakespeare prevailed!) Both are very faint and unusually red; they move far beyond the main satellite system and have non-circular orbits. Nothing definite is known about their nature; they may be captured Kuiper Belt objects. As yet nothing definite is known about the two outer satellites discovered by Kavelaars in 1999. As the apparent diameter of the Sun as seen from Uranus is below 2 arcmin, all the satellites known before the Voyager 2 pass could produce total eclipses. From Uranus, Ariel would have much the largest diameter. To an observer on Uranus – if he could get there! – sunlight would be relatively strong, ranging between 1068 and 1334 times that of full moonlight on Earth. Saturn would be fairly bright when well placed (every 45 1 2 years); Jupiter would have an apparent magnitude of 1.7, but would remain inconveniently close to the Sun in the Uranian sky. Neptune would be visible with the naked eye when near opposition. Bland though it may appear, Uranus has proved to be of intense interest. It is very different from any other world known to us.

Aphelion was reached on 13 July 1959. E ARLY O BSERVATIONS Neptune was observed on several occasions before being identified as a planet. The first observation seems to have been made by Galileo on 27 December 1612. While drawing Jupiter and its four satellites, he recorded a ‘star’ which was certainly Neptune. He again saw it twice in January1613, andnoteditsmovement, but, notsurprisingly, took it for a star. His telescope had a magnification of × 18 and a resolving power of 190 arcsec, with a field of view 17 arcmin in diameter, Neptune’s magnitude was 7.7, and Galileo often plotted stars fainter than that. Jupiter actually occulted Neptune in 1613. ThenexttelescopicobservationwasmadeinMay1795 by J. J. de Lalande, but again Neptune was mistaken for a star. Further observations were made in 1845–6 by John Lamont (often referred to as Johann von Lamont; he was Director of the Munich Observatory). D ISCOVERY Uranus was discovered in 1781 by William Herschel. Before long it became clear that it was not moving exactly as it had been expected to do; this was recognized by a mathematician, the Reverend Placidus Fixlmillner of Kremsm ̈ unster. It was reasonable to suppose that the old 204 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"N EPTUNE Table 12.3. Close planetary conjunctions involving Neptune, 1900–2100.

The previous triple conjunction of Neptune and Uranus was in 1821; the next will be in 2164. pre-discovery observations, used to calculate the orbit, were inaccurate, so Fixlmillner discarded them and re-worked the orbit. Within a few years new discrepancies became evident. In 1821 A. Bouvard produced new tables of Uranus’ motion, but by 1832 G. Airy, then at Cambridge, found that these tables were wrong by half a minute of arc, which was unacceptable. It was around this time that there were the first definite suggestions than an unknown planet might be pulling Uranus out of position. The idea occurred to J. E. B. Valz, Director of the Marseilles Observatory, and to F. G. B. Nicolai, Director of the Mannheim Observatory. On 17 November 1834 an English amateur, the Reverend T. J. Hussey (Rector of Hayes in Kent) wrote a letter to Airy suggesting that it might be possible to work out a position for the perturbing planet. Airy’s reply was not encouraging, and Hussey took the matter no further. In 1840 F. W. Bessel, of K ̈ onigsberg, returned to the possibility of a new planet and told Sir John Herschel – son of Sir William – that he intended to search for it, in collaboration with his pupil, F. W. Flemming. This never happened. Flemming died suddenly; Bessel became ill and he too died in 1846. Another interested astronomer was J. H. M ̈ adler, co-author (with Beer) of the first really good map of the Moon; M ̈ adler discussed the problem in 1841, but by then had left Germany to become Director of the new Dorpat Observatory in Estonia, and he never followed the Uranus problem through. In 1841 John Couch Adams, then an undergraduate at Cambridge, ‘formed a design of investigating as soon as possible, after taking my degree, the irregularities in the motion of Uranus’, with the intention of tracking down the new planet. He began work in 1843, and by mid-1845 had calculated a position for the planet. He was in communication with James Challis, Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge, and also with Airy, now Astronomer Royal at Greenwich, but following a series of delays and misunderstandings no search was instigated. Meanwhile, U. J. J. Le Verrier, in France, had been working along similar lines, and by 1846 he had worked out a position very close to that given by Adams – about which, of course, Le Verrier was entirely ignorant. When Airy saw Le Verrier’s memoir, he realized that a search would have to be undertaken. There was no suitable telescope at Greenwich, but at Cambridge there was the 29.8 cm Northumberland refractor, and Airy instructed Challis to begin hunting. Unfortunately Challis had no up- to-date charts of the area of the sky concerned, and he was not enthusiastic; he adopted a cumbersome method of star- checking, and was in no hurry to compare his observations. Le Verrier had failed to persuade astronomers in Paris to begin a search, but the outcome was different. Patience was never Le Verrier’s strong point, and instead of waiting he contacted Johann Galle, at the Berlin Observatory. Galle was interested, and asked permission from the Observatory director, J. F. Encke, to use the 23 cm Berlin refractor for the purpose. Encke agreed: ‘Let us oblige the gentleman from Paris!’ Galle, together with a young astronomer, H. D’Arrest, lost no time, and on 23 September 1846, the first night of their search, they identified the planet. Galle used the telescope, while D’Arrest checked the positions THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 205"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"N EPTUNE of the stars which came into view. Within minutes Galle described an eighth-magnitude star at RA 22h 53m 25s.84. D’Arrest called out. ‘That star is not on the map!’. Encke joined them in the dome, and they followed the object until it set. Next night they found that it had moved by the expected amount, and Encke wrote to Le Verrier; ‘The planet whose position you have pointed out actually exists.’ Le Verrier’s predicted position was in error by only 55 arcmin. It was also notable that the planet showed a definite disk; Le Verrier had predicted an apparent diameter of 3 \u0002\u0002 . 3, and Encke’s first measures made it 3 \u0002\u0002 . 2, which is close to the correct value. Subsequently Challis found that he had observed the planet twice soon after beginning his search, on 30 July and 4 August, and again on 12 August. Had Challis checked his records, he could not have failed to identify the planet, and on 12 August he even suspected a ‘star’ which showed a disk – yet he did not examine the suspect object with a higher magnification 1 . Following the announcement from Berlin the new planet was soon seen by J. R. Hind from London, using a 17.7 cm refractor, and by the well-known amateur William Lassell, who had set up a 61 cm reflector in Liverpool. The first announcement of Adams’ independent work (almost as accurate as Le Verrier’s) was made on 3 October 1846 by Sir John Herschel, in the Athenæum . The announcement caused deep resentment in France, and led to acrimonious disputes, but in these Adams and Le Verrier took no part, and when they met they struck up an immediate and lasting friendship – even though Adams could not speak French and Le Verrier was equally unversed in English! It is often said that Le Verrier and Adams should be recognized as co-discoverers of the planet, but this is not strictly correct; the true discoverers of Neptune were Johann Galle and Heinrich D’Arrest. Adams made no personal search for the planet; he was not equipped to do so. The story that he wrote to 1 In September 1988 I decided to check Challis’ observations, so from the Royal Greenwich Observatory, than at Herstmonceux in Sussex, I looked at Neptune through the telescope used by Challis and with the same magnification ( × 117). There was no doubt that Neptune showed a disk, and with a power of × 250 the difference between the planet and a star was glaringly obvious. Lassell, asking for assistance, and that Lassell failed to respond because he was hors de comb ˆ at with a sprained ankle, is certainly untrue. Lassell did, however, discover Neptune’s main satellite, Triton, on 10 October a few weeks after Neptune itself had been found. On 14 October 1846 Lassell also reported a ring, but later observations showed that this was an optical effect, as Lassell himself later realized. His spurious ring has no connection with the real ring system, which could not possibly have been detected with any telescope available at the time (in fact, even today it has never been seen with a ground-based instrument). N AMING A name had to be found, and the mythological tradition was followed. Challis suggested ‘Oceanus’; Galle, in a letter to Le Verrier, preferred ‘Janus’, while Le Verrier’s own choice was ‘Neptune’. Le Verrier then changed his mind, and decided that the planet should be named after himself, but this was not well received, and before long ‘Neptune’ was universally accepted. P HYSICAL C HARACTERISTICS Neptune is a twin of Uranus – but it is a non-identical twin. It is very slightly smaller, but appreciably denser and more massive. Unlike Uranus, it has an internal heat source; it sends out 2.6 times more energy than it would do if it depended entirely upon what it receives from the Sun. It does not share in Uranus’ unusual axial tilt; at the time of the Voyager 2 pass it was Neptune’s south pole which was in sunlight. The rotation period of just over 16 h is slightly shorter than that of Uranus. V OYAGER 2A T N EPTUNE Our first detailed information about Neptune was obtained from Voyager 2, in 1989; little can be seen on the planet’s disk with Earth-based telescopes, and of course the Hubble Space Telescope was not launched until after the Voyager pass. Voyager 2 had already encountered Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. After the Saturn encounter, scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated that the chances of success at Uranus were about 60%, but no more than 40% at Neptune; in the event, both encounters were wellnigh 206 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"N EPTUNE faultless, and a tremendous amount of information was obtained. At 06.50 GMT on 25 August 1989 Voyager 2 passed over the darkened north pole of Neptune, at a minimum relative velocity of 17.1 km s − 1 . At that time the space- craft was 29 240 km from the centre of Neptune, no more than 5000 km above the cloud tops, and 4425 000 000 km from Earth, so that the ‘light-time’ wa s4h6 min. The encounter was unlike anything previously experienced, because everything happened so quickly. The main picture- taking period was compressed into less than 12 h. Before the closest approach over the north pole, many of the main discoveries had been made. The ring system was surveyed, and the magnetic field studied; lightning was detected from the charged particle (discharges recorded by the plasma wave equipment); auroræ were confirmed; surface features had been imaged, and six new satellites had been found. Neptune proved to be a dynamic world, very different from the bland Uranus. After the polar pass, Voyager 2 passed through the plane of the rings, at a relative velocity of over 76 000 km h − 1 . Impacts by ring particles were recorded 40 min before the crossing, and reached a peak of 300 per second for 10–15 min either side of the actual crossing; the Voyager team members were very relieved when the space- craft emerged unscathed. Just ove r 5 h later, Voyager 2 passed Triton at a range of 38 000 km, and sent back images whichwereasfascinatingastheywereunexpected. Onelast picture was taken, showing Neptune and Triton together as crescents, and then Voyager began a never-ending journey out of the Solar System. Contact was still maintained in 2000, and probably signals will be received for several years before Voyager finally passes out of range. Its fate will never be known; it carries a plaque and recordings in case any alien civilization finds it, but the chances do not seem to be very high. Calculations indicate that it will by-pass several stars during the next 300 000 years (Table 12.4), but obviouslyallthisisuncertain, andVoyager2mayeventually be destroyed by a collision with some wandering body. Since 1994, regular observations have been made with the Hubble Space Telescope, and these have been of great value, but it is true to say that the bulk of our present knowledge of Neptune has come from that single encounter with Voyager 2.

The interiors of Uranus and Neptune are dominated by ‘ices’, primarily water; the main difference between the two is that Neptune has a marked internal heat source, which Uranus apparently lacks. Neptune may have a silicate core extending out to one-fifth of the planet’s radius, but this is by no means certain, and in any case the core does not seem to be strongly differentiated from the ice components. The oblateness of the globe is 0.017, as against 0.029 for Uranus. A TMOSPHERE Predictably, Neptune’s atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen; it seems that the upper atmosphere is made up of 84% molecular hydrogen (H 2 ), 14% helium (He) and 2% methane (CH 4 ). Methane absorbs light of relatively long wavelength (orange and red), which is why Neptune looks blue. There are trace amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) with even smaller amounts of acetylene (C 2 H 2 ) and ethane (C 2 H 6 ). There are various cloud layers. At a level where the pressure is 3.3 bars there is a layer which seems to be THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 207"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"N EPTUNE made up of hydrogen sulphide, above which come layers of hydrocarbons, with a methane layer and upper methane haze. Above the hydrogen sulphide layer there are discrete clouds with diameters of the order of 100 km; these cast shadows on the cloud deck 50–75 km below. We are, in fact, dealing with clouds which may be described as methane cirrus. Apparently there is a definite cycle of events. First, solar ultra-violet destroys methane high in Neptune’s atmosphere by converting it to other hydrocarbons such as acetylene and ethane. These hydrocarbons sink to the lower stratosphere, where they evaporate and then condense. The hydrocarbon ice particles fall into the warmer troposphere, where they evaporate and are converted back to methane. Buoyant, convective methane clouds then rise up to the base of the stratosphere or higher, thereby returning methane vapour to the stratosphere and preventing any net methane loss. In the troposphere there are variable amounts of hydrogen sulphide, methane and ammonia, all of which are involved in the creation of the cloud layers and associated photochemical processes. Temperature measurements show that there is a cold mid-latitude region, with a warmer equator and pole (we know very little about the north pole, which was in darkness during the Voyager 2 pass). Note, en passant , that the general temperature is much the same as that of Uranus; at the equator it is − 226 ◦ C, as against − 214 ◦ C, even though Neptune is so much further from the Sun. The planet’s internal heat source more or less compensates for the increased distance. There are violent winds on Neptune; most of them blow in a westerly direction, or retrograde (that is to say, opposite to the planet’s rotation). The winds differ from those of Jupiter and Saturn, and are distinctively zonal. At the equator they blow westward at up to 450 m s − 1 . Further south they slacken, and beyond latitude − 50 ◦ they become eastward (prograde) at up to 300 m s − 1 , decreasing once more near the south pole. In fact, a broad equatorial retrograde jet extends from approximately latitude + 45 ◦ to − 50 ◦ , with a relatively narrow prograde jet at around latitude − 70 ◦ . Neptune is the ‘windiest’ planet in the Solar System; as the heat budget is only 1/20 of that at Jupiter, it seems that the winds are so strong because of the relative lack of turbulence. S POTS A ND C LOUDS AtthetimeoftheVoyager2encounterthemostconspicuous feature on Neptune was a huge oval, the Great Dark Spot, with a longer axis of about 10 000 km; it lay at latitude − 22 ◦ and its size, relative to Neptune, was about the same as that of the Great Red Spot relative to Jupiter. It had a rotation period of 18.296 h, and drifted westward at about 325 m s − 1 relative to the adjacent clouds; it was about 10% darker than its surroundings, while the nearby material was about 10% brighter – indicative of the altitude difference between the two regions; it was a high- pressure area, rotating counter-clockwise and showing all thecharacteristicsofanatmosphericvortex. Hangingabove it were bright cirrus-type clouds, made up of methane ice; between the cirrus and the main cloud deck there was a clear region about 50 km deep. The cirrus changed shape quite quickly, and in some cases there were shadows cast on the cloud deck beneat h – a phenomenon not observed on Jupiter or Saturn, and certainly not on Uranus. The Great Dark Spot seemed to be migrating poleward at a rate of 15 ◦ per year, and was tacitly assumed to be a feature at least as semi-permanent as Jupiter’s Red Spot. However, this proved not to be the case. By 1994, observations with the Hubble Space Telescope showed that it had disappeared, and there is no reason to expect that it will return, although we cannot be sure (after all, Jupiter’s Red Spot vanishes sometimes, but only temporarily). Voyager 2 also showed a smaller, very variable feature at latitude − 42 ◦ , with a rotation period of 15.97 h; it was nicknamed the ‘Scooter’, and had a bright centre. Every few revolutions it caught up with the Great Dark Spot and passed it. Still further south, at latitude − 54 ◦ , there was another dark spot, D2, which also had a bright core and showed small-scale internal details which changed markedly over periods of a few hours. These too have vanished, but in June 1994 Hubble images showed a bright cloud band near latitude + 30 ◦ which apparently did not exist in 1989; subsequently it faded, while two bright irregular patches appeared in the southern hemisphere. Evidently Neptune’s surface features are much more variable than had been expected. 208 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"N EPTUNE M AGNETIC F IELD It had been assumed that Neptune must have a magnetic field. As Voyager 2 drew inward, radio emissions were detected, but there was a delay before Voyager passed through the bow shock (that is to say, the region where the solar wind is heated and deflected by interaction with Neptune’s magnetosphere). The bow shock was finally recorded at 879 000 km from the planet. The magnetic field itself was weaker than those of the other giants; the field strength at the surface is 1.2 G in the southern hemisphere but only 0.06 G in the northern. The real surprise was that the inclination of the magnetic axis relative to the axis of rotation is 47 ◦ , so that in this respect Neptune is not unlike Uranus; moreover the magnetic axis does not pass through the centre of the globe, but is displaced by 10 000 km or 0.4 Neptune radii. This indicates that the dynamo electric currents must be closer to the surface than to the centre of the globe. The magnetosphere has been described as comparatively ‘empty’; it gyrates dramatically as the planet rotates, and the satellites are involved. Auroræ were found, but instead of being near the rotational poles they were closer to the equator – because the rotational and the magnetic poles are so far apart. At this time, of course, the northern hemisphere was experiencing its long winter. Neptunian auroræ are considerably weaker than those of the other giants. N EPTUNE’S R INGS Neptune has an obscure ring system. Indications of ring material were obtained in pre-Voyager times by the occultation method, which had been used to detect the rings of Uranus; for example, on 24 May 1981 observers from Arizona observed the close approach of Neptune to a star, and found that there was a very brief drop in the star’s brightness. Other similar observations led to the suggestion that there might be incomplete rings – that is to say ‘ring arcs’, although nobody was quite sure how or why such arcs should develop. The mystery was solved by observations from Voyager 2. There are complete rings, but the main ring is ‘clumpy’. Data are given in Table 12.5; the rings have been named after astronomers involved in the discovery of Neptune (although up to now, D’Arrest has been quite unfairly ignored). Franc ̧ois Arago is included, as it was he Table 12.5. The rings of Neptune.

The outer Adams ring is the most pronounced, and contains the three ‘clumps’ which led to the idea of ring arcs; these ‘clumps’ have been named Libert ́ e, Egalit ́ e and Fraternit ́ e, for reasons which are, at best, obscure. The ‘clumps’arenotevenlydistributed, butaregroupedtogether over about 1/10 of the ring circumference; their lengths range from 5000 to 10 000 km. They may be due to the effects of the small satellite Galatea, which orbits very close to the rings. It has also been suggested that the cause may be small satellites embedded in the Adams ring, but so far these have not been seen; they may or may not exist. During the Voyager 2 pass, the Adams ring occulted the second-magnitude star Sigma Sagittarii, and proved to have a core only 17 km wide; the ring material is reddish, with a very low albedo. The Arago ring is dim and narrow. The Le Verrier ring is narrow and tenuous; it is not far from the orbit of the small satellite Despina, but shows no arcs. The Plateau is a diffuse band of material, containing a high percentage of very small particles. The inner Galle ring is much broader than the Adams or Le Verrier rings; there may be ‘dust’ extending down almost to the cloud tops. Unlike the Uranian rings, those of Neptune are brighter in forward-scattered light than in back-scattered light, so that they contain a larger fraction of very small particles than do the much narrower rings of Uranus. Even from Voyager, Neptune’s rings were not easy to identify; they are blacker than soot! Possibly they are young, formed from the d ́ ebris of small satellites.

S ATELLITES Neptune has eight known satellites. The largest, Triton, is an easy telescopic object – easier than any of the satellites of Uranus – and was discovered soon after the identification of Neptune itself. The second satellite known before the Space Age, Nereid, was found by G. Kuiper in 1949. The remaining six were all discovered on images taken by Voyager 2, although one of them, Larissa, had been fortuitously noted on 24 May 1981, when it occulted a star; the observation was made by a team led by J. Reitsema, and they are surely entitled to be regarded as discoverers even though they could not, at the time, prove that a satellite was responsible. None of these small inner satellites can be seen with ground-based telescopes; all move more or less in the plane of the rings, with very low orbital eccentricity. Triton has retrograde motion and is almost certainly a captured body rather than a bona-fide satellite, while Nereid has a highly eccentric path round Neptune and could possibly be an escapee from the Kuiper Belt. All the satellites are named after marine deities. Data are given in Table 12.6. Naiad . The last satellite to be discovered, and the closest to the planet; it moves at only about 23 200 km above the Neptunian cloud tops. The name comes from a group of Greek water nymphs who were guardians of lakes, fountains, springs and rivers. Naiad seems to be rather irregular in shape, but no surface details were seen from Voyager. Thalassa . Named for a Greek sea goddess, sometimes said to be the mother of Aphrodite. Like Naiad, Thalassa seems to be irregular in shape, but little else is known about it. It moves about 25 200 km above Neptune’s cloud tops. Despina . Named for the daughter of Neptune and Demeter. This is yet another irregularly-shaped satellite, moving in an orbit just closer to Neptune than the Le Verrier ring; it may have some effect upon this ring. In itself it seems to be similar to Naiad and Thalassa, but is rather larger. 210 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"N EPTUNE Galatea . Named for one of the Nereids. Its orbit is very close to the obscure Arago ring. No close-range views were obtained from Voyager, and so no surface details have been recorded. Larissa . Named after one of Neptune’s numerous lovers. The satellite was almost certainly responsible for the occultation event of 1981, although its existence was not established until the Voyager 2 mission. Voyager 2 obtained an image of it on 24 August 1989 and showed a number of craters on its surface. With a longest diameter of 208 km, Larissa is decidedly larger than the four innermost satellites. Proteus . In mythology Proteus was a marine deity, son of Oceanus and Tethys. This was the first satellite to be discovered from Voyager 2, and is larger than Nereid, but it is so close to Neptune – less than 93 000 km above the cloud tops – that it is unobservable with ground-based telescopes. Proteus has a very low albedo, and has been said to be ‘as dark as soot’. It is rather irregular in form, and is triaxial. On 25 August 1989 Voyager 2 obtained an image of it. The main surface feature is a depression, Pharos (originally known as the Southern Hemisphere Depression), which dominates the southern part of the Neptune-facing hemisphere; like all the Neptunian satellites apart from Nereid, Proteushassynchronousrotation, sothatitsrotation period is the same as its orbital period (1d 2.9h). Pharos is basically circular, with a raised rim and a flat, rugged floor; it is 225 km across and 10–15 km deep. Proteus also shows linear streaks, which seem to be troughs 25–35 km wide and several kilometres deep; they form a global network, Figure 12.1. Proteus. and may be classed as graben of extensional origin. There are no cryovolcanic structures or coronæ. Triton . Here we have one of the most remarkable bodies in the entire Solar System. Before the Voyager pass it was believed to be large – possibly larger than Mercury – and to have chemical oceans on its surface, but this was found to be completely wrong. Triton is much smaller than had been expected, so that in size it ranks below all four of Jupiter’s Galilean satellites, Titan in Saturn’s system and our own Moon; it is also more reflective, with an albedo which in places rises to 0.8. It is very cold, with a temperature of − 235 ◦ C (a mere 38 K above absolute zero). The mass is 2 . 4 × 10 22 kg, and the density fairly high (2.07 times that of water), so that the globe may be made up of a mixture of rock (2 / 3) and ice (1 / 3). The escape velocity is 1.44 km s − 1 , lower than that of our Moon, but the intense cold means that Triton can retain an extensive though tenuous atmosphere; the ground atmospheric pressure is of the order of 14 microbars, about 1 / 70 000 the pressure of the Earth’s air at sea-level. The main constituent is nitrogen, in the form of N 2 , which accounts for 99%; most of the rest is methane, with a trace of carbon monoxide. There is considerable haze, seen by Voyager above the surface, and this is probably composed of microscopic ice crystals of methane or nitrogen. Winds in the atmosphere average aroun d5ms − 1 westward, although naturally they have very little force. There is a pronounced temperature inversion, since the temperature in the atmosphere rises to about − 173 ◦ C at a height of 600 km. This inversion occurs at a surprisingly high altitude, for reasons which are unclear. In 1998 measurements with the Hubble Space Telescope found that the surface temperature had increased by about 2 ◦ since the Voyager pass nine years earlier, and that the atmospheric density had shown a slight but definite increase. This is certainly a seasonal effect, caused by changes in the polar cap. The surface of Triton is very varied, and there is very marked evidence of past cryovulcanism (that is to say, icy vulcanism). There is a general coating of ice, presumably water ice overlaid by nitrogen and methane ices; water ice has not been detected spectroscopically, but it must exist, because nitrogen and methane ices are not hard enough to maintain surface relief over long periods. Not that there THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 211"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"N EPTUNE Figure 12.2. Triton. is much surface relief on Triton; there are no mountains or deep valleys, and the total surface relief cannot amount to more than a few hundred metres. Normal craters are scarce, and even the largest of them is no more than 27 km in diameter. Extensive flows are seen, some of them up to 80 km wide, due probably to ammonia–water fluids. The most striking feature is the southern polar cap, which is covered with pink nitrogen snow and ice. The areas surveyed by Voyager 2 have been divided into three main regions: Bubembe Region (western equatorial), Monad Regio (eastern equatorial) and Uhlanga Regio (polar). These names, and those of other features, have been allotted by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Astronomical Union. All the features have aquatic names, excluding Greek and Roman deities. Thus Bubembe is the island location of the temple of Mukasa (Uganda), Monad is a Chinese symbol of duality in nature and Uhlanga is a Zulu reed from which mankind sprang! Uhlanga is covered with the pink cap, with some of the underlying geological units showing through in places. It is here that we find the nitrogen ice geysers which were so totally unexpected. Apparently there is a layer of liquid nitrogen 20–30 m below the surface; here the pressure is high enough for nitrogen to remain liquid, but if for any reason it migrates upward it will come to a region where the pressure is about 1 / 10 that of the Earth’s air at sea level. The nitrogen will then explode in a shower of ice and vapour (about 80% ice, 20% vapour) and will travel up the nozzle of the geyser-like vent at a rate of up to 150 m s − 1 , which is fast enough to make it rise to several kilometres before falling 212 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"N EPTUNE Table 12.7.

The outrush sweeps dark d ́ ebris along it, producing plumes such as Mahilani and Hili. The Mahilani plume is a narrow, straight cloud 90–150 km long, while Hili is a cluster of several plumes with a length of about 100 km. The ways in which the plume clouds move indicates the force and direction of the winds in the thin Tritonian atmosphere. The wind speeds here can reach 20 m s − 1 ; the direction is north-east near the surface, east at intermediate altitude and westward at the top of the troposphere, 8 km in altitude. The edge of the cap, separating Uhlanga from Monad and Bubembe, is sharp and convoluted. The long seasons mean that the southern pole has been in constant sunlight for over a century now, and along the cap borders there are signs of evaporation; eventually the cap may appear THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 213"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"N EPTUNE to shift northward, so that the entire aspect of Triton may change according to the seasons – and as we have noted, this also affects the surface temperature and the atmospheric density. In reality it is not the cap shifting northward but evaporation/sublimation products moving northward in the atmosphere, where at the colder northern regions they are redeposited to form the raw materials for the process here to be repeated during the northern summer. North of the cap there is a darker, redder region; the colour may be due to the action of solar ultra-violet upon the methane. Running across this region, more or less parallel to the edge of the cap, is a slightly bluish layer, due possibly to tiny crystals of methane ice scattering the incoming sunlight. Monad Regio is part smooth, with knobbly or hummocky terrain; there are rimless pits (pateræ), with graben-like troughs (fossæ) and strange, mushroom-like features (guttæ) such as Zin and Akupara, whose origin is unclear. There are four walled plains or ‘lakes’ (Ruach, Ryugu, Sipapu, Tuonela) which have flat floors and are bounded by rougher plains units; they have been likened to calderæ. They are edged with terraces, as though the original level has been changed several times by repeated melting and re-freezing. Undulating smooth plains cover most of the higher part of Monad. Bubembe Regio is characterized by the so-called cantaloupe terrai n – a nickname given to it because of its superficial resemblance to a melon-skin! Fissures cross it, meeting in elevated X or Y junctions. Liquid material, presumably a mixture of water and ammonia, seems to have forced its way up some of these fissures, so that there are central ridges; material has even flowed out on to the plain before freezing there. The overall pattern is a network of closely-spaced depressions (cavi), 25–35 km across; they do not overlap. The cantaloupe areas are probably the oldest parts of Triton’s surface. Quite apart from the nitrogen geysers, Triton’s surface must be variable on a much larger scale. Southern midsummer will not fall until the year 2006, and there will no doubt be marked changes in the cap – and also in the north polar region, which is at the moment (2000) plunged into its long winter night. Everything indicates that Triton was not originally a satellite of Neptune, but was captured well after its formation. Initially its orbit round Neptune would have been eccentric; over a period of perhaps 1000 million years it was forced into the present circular form, and during this time there was great internal heating, coupled with surface activity. There may also have been a dense atmosphere. A selected list of surface features is given in Table 12.7. Mythologically, Triton was the sea-god son of Neptune and Amphitrite. Apparently the name was first suggested by the French astronomer Camille Flammarion. We have to agree that Neptune has certainly produced a remarkable child. Nereid . Following the discovery of Triton, searches were made for the other satellites of Neptune. One was suspected by Lassell in 1852 and another by J. Schaeberle in 1892, using the 91 cm Lick refractor, but neither was confirmed, and a search by W. H. M. Christie, using the 152 cm reflector at Mount Wilson, was negative. Success then finally came in 1949, when G. P. Kuiper, using the 208 cm reflector at the McDonald Observatory in Texas, found a new faint satellite. It was named Nereid – and this was appropriate; the Nereids were the fifty daughters of Nereus, the sea-god, and Doris. Nereid is exceptional inasmuch as its orbit is highly eccentric, and more like that of a comet than an asteroid. Its distance from Neptune ranges between 1353 60 km out to 9623 700 km, and it takes nearly a year to complete one orbit. Unfortunately it was not well imaged by Voyager 2, and the only reasonable image was obtained from a range of 4500 000 km, so that little surface detail could be made out. It seems to be fairly regular in shape; it is more reflective than the small inner satellites, and is grey in colour, so that the surface may well be covered with rock or ‘dirty ice’. No doubt there are craters, but for further information we must await the launch of a new space-craft to the Neptunian system – and this may well be delayed for a considerable time. Whether Nereid is a true satellite or whether it was captured is not known. It is unlikely that the rotation period is synchronous – one estimate, derived from variations in magnitude, gives 13.6 h, but it is quite probably that the period, like that of Hyperion in Saturn’s system, is chaotic. To an observer on Neptune, the average apparent diameter of Nereid would be only about 19 arcsec. There may well be other satellites of Neptune. If so, they will no doubt be discovered at some time in the future. 214 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"13 P LUTO Pluto, the outermost known planet of the Solar System, was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh, from the Lowell Observatory at Flagstaff in Arizona. It is the only planet not yet encountered by a space probe, and as a result our knowledge of it is very far from complete. It is accompanied by a smaller body, Charon, whose diameter is more than half that of Pluto itself. M OVEMENTS Pluto has a curiously eccentric orbit, which can bring it closer to the Sun than Neptune can ever be; the aphelion distance of Neptune is 4537 million km, the perihelion distance of Pluto 4446 million k m – a difference of over 90 million km. Pluto was last at perihelion in 1989; it came within Neptune’s orbit on 21 January 1979, and regained its status as ‘the outermost planet’ at 11.22 h GMT on 11 February 1999. It will retain this status until 5 April 2231. However, there is no fear of collision with Neptune, as Pluto’s orbit is inclined at an angle of 17 ◦ and at the present epoch the distance between the two planets cannot be less than 348 million km. Pluto can depart from the official Zodiac, and for the 1999–2005 period it lies in Ophiuchus. Data for Pluto are given in Table 13.1, and opposition dates in Table 13.2. S TATUS Pluto is an enigma, inasmuch as it does not fit easily into any category. It is smaller than the Moon, and also smaller than several planetary satellites, including Triton in Neptune’s system. On the other hand it is too large to be classed as an asteroid or as a normal Kuiper Belt object. Suggestions to re-classify it as asteroidal and give it an asteroidal number (1000) were rejected in 1999 by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Astronomical Union, and Pluto is still officially ranked as a planet, although certainly its status must be regarded as dubious.

The first systematic search was made in 1877 by David Peck Todd, from the US Naval Observatory. From perturbations of Uranus, he predicted a planet at a distance of 52 a.u. from the Sun, with a diameter of 80 000 km. He conducted a visual search, using the 66 cm USNO reflector with powers of × 400 and × 600, hoping to detect an object showing a definite disk. He continued the hunt for 30 clear, moonless nights between THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 215"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"P LUTO Table 13.2. Oppositions of Pluto.

On 1 January 1999 Pluto passed 12 \u0002\u0002 south of the star ζ Ophi- uchi 3 November 1877 and 5 March 1878, but with negative results. A second investigation was conducted in 1879 by the French astronomer Camille Flammarion, who based his suggestion upon the fact that several comets appeared to have their aphelia at approximately the same distance, well beyond the orbit of Neptune. In 1900 G. Forbes predicted two planets, at distances of 100 and 500 a.u. respectively, with periods of 1000 and 5000 years; both were assumed to be larger than Jupiter. In 1902 T. Grigull of M ̈ unster proposed a planet the size of Uranus, moving at 50 a.u. in a period of 360 years; Grigull even gave it a name – Hades. H. E. Lau, from Denmark (1900), suggested two planets, at 46.6 and 70.6 a.u., with masses 9 and 47 times that of the Earth; G. Gaillot (1901) also believed in two planets, and T. J. J. See in America increased the number to three, naming the innermost planet ‘Oceanus’. A. Garnowsky, in Russia, went further and postulated the existence of four planets. The first systematic photographic and visual search was made by Percival Lowell, from Flagstaff, from 1905 to 1907. Lowell had worked out a position for his ‘Planet X’, from perturbations of Neptune and (particularly) Uranus; his planet was believed to have a mass almost seven times that of the Earth, with a period of 282 years and a rather eccentric orbit (0.202). The date of perihelion was given as 1991. A second search at Flagstaff, carried out by C. O. Lampland in 1914, was equally fruitless, and was given up on Lowell’s death in 1916, a year after Lowell had published his final orbit for the planet. Also in the hunt was W. H. Pickering, who in 1898 had discovered Saturn’s eighth satellite, Phœbe. His Planet O had a mass twice that of the Earth and a period of 248 years, again with an eccentric orbit. His method – unlike Lowell’s – was essentially graphical, but his conclusions were much the same. On the basis of these results, Milton Humason at Mount Wilson Observatory undertook a photographic search in 1919, but again the results were negative. In 1929 V. M. Slipher, by then Director of the Lowell Observatory, decided to make a fresh attempt. The search was entrusted to Clyde Tombaugh, using a 13 inch refractor specially acquired for the purpose. (Tombaugh was then a young, unqualified amateur; later he became one of America’s most senior and respected astronomers.) Tombaugh used photographic methods, and before long success came; Pluto was detected upon plates taken on 23 and 29 January 1930, although the announcement was delayed until 13 March – 149 years after the discovery of Uranus and 78 years after Lowell’s birth. Examination of the earlier plates showed that Pluto had been recorded twice in 1915, but had been missed because it was unexpectedly faint. However, Humason’s failure in 1919 was due to sheer bad luck. When his plates were re- examined, it was found that Pluto had been recorded twice – but once the image fell upon a flaw in the plate, and on the second occasion Pluto was masked by an inconvenient bright star. It is interesting to compare predictions with fact: Planet X Planet O Pluto Actual (Lowell) (Pickering) Mean distance from Sun (a.u.) 39.5 43.0 55.1 Period (years) 248 282 409 Eccentricity 0.249 0.202 0.248 Inclination ( ◦ )17 10 15 Perihelion date 1989 1991 2129 Mass, Earth = 1 0.002 6.6 2.0 The first orbit for Pluto issued from Flagstaff gave an eccentricity of 0.909 and a period of 3000 years, but a few months later new observations yielded a better orbit. Pluto was detected near the star δ Geminorum. Slipher’s initial announcement stated that ‘the object was 7 seconds of time 216 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"P LUTO west from δ Geminorum, agreeing with Lowell’s predicted longitude’. Various names for the new planet were suggested, including Odin, Persephone, Chaos, Atlas, Tempus, Lowell, Minerva, Hercules, Daisy (!), Pax, Newton, Freya, Constance and Tantalus. The final choice was Pluto, suggested by an 11-year-old Oxford schoolgirl, Venetia Burney (now Mrs. Phair). S IZE A ND M ASS Lowell’s prediction had been very accurate; but was it sheer luck? Before long, doubts began to creep in, because Pluto seemed to be far too small and lightweight to exert measurable perturbations upon giants such as Uranus and Neptune. (Uranus had been used for the main investigations, because its orbit was very well known, whereas Neptune had not completed a full revolution since its identification in 1846; in fact it has not done so even yet.) In 1936 A. C. D. Crommelin of Greenwich suggested the theory of specular reflection. If Pluto were highly reflective, the bright image of the Sun might falsify the diameter estimates, so that Pluto could be much larger – and hence more massive – than it seemed. This proved to be incorrect. In 1949 G. P. Kuiper, using the 82 in (208 cm) reflector at the McDonald Observatory in Texas, gave the diameter as 10 200 km, with a mass eight-tenths of that of the Earth, but even this proved to be far too great. In 1950 Kuiper and Humason made new measurements with the Hale reflector at Palomar, reducing the diameter to 5800 km – smaller than Mars. In 1965 a partial occultation of a star by Pluto showed that the diameter could not be more than 5800 km, and the current value is only 2324 km. In fact, Pluto could not have been predicted by any perturbations upon Uranus or Neptune. Either the accuracy was purely fortuitous, or else the planet for which Lowell was searching really exists, at a still greater distance from the Sun. Incidentally, R. A. Lyttleton of Cambridge, in 1936, suggested that Pluto might be an escaped satellite of Neptune, an idea supported in 1956 by Kuiper, but the discovery of Pluto’s companion, Charon, indicates that this cannot be the case. C HARON Pluto is not a solitary wanderer in space. It has a companion, Charon, discovered in 1978. Data are given in Table 13.3. Table 13.3. Charon. Distance from Pluto: 19 640 km Orbital period: 6d 9h 17m (6.387 25 days) Orbital eccentricity: 0.0076 Orbital inclination: 98 ◦ . 80 Mean orbital velocity: 0.23 km s − 1 Diameter (km): 1270 Mean density; water = 1: 1.3 Escape velocity: 0.16 km s − 1 Albedo: 0.36 Magnitude at perihelic opposition: 16.8 Apparent diameter, seen from Pluto: 4 \u0002\u0002 Apparent magnitude, seen from Pluto: − 9 Elongation from Pluto, as seen from Earth: 0 \u0002\u0002 . 6 The discovery was made on 22 June 1978 by James W. Christy, from the US Naval Observatory at Flagstaff. Pluto had been repeatedly photographed with the 1.55 m reflector with a view to predicting occultations of stars by the planet, which could be used to give an improved value for Pluto’s diameter. Images taken in April and May showed that Pluto’s image seemed to be elongated. Plates taken earlier (1965, 1970, 1971) were then checked, and the same effects were noted; further confirmation came on 6 July 1978 by J. Graham, using the 401 cm reflector at the Cerro Tololo Observatory in Chile. Either Pluto was curiously irregular in shape, or else it was attended by a satellite. The existence of the satellite as a separate body was established by D. Bonneau and P. Foy, using the 3.6 m Canada–France–Hawaii telescope on Mauna Kea; using the technique of speckle interferometry, they recorded the two bodies separately. The attendant was named Charon, after the gloomy boatman who ferried departed souls across the River Styx into the Underworld. The Pluto–Charon system is unique, and better regarded as a binary planet (or a binary Kuiper Belt object) rather than as a planet and a satellite. The barycentre of the system (that is to say, the ‘balancing point’) lies between the two, whereas in all other cases the barycentre lies within the globe of the parent planet. Charon’s orbit round Pluto THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 217"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"P LUTO is almost circular, and the surface-to-surface distance is only about 18 000 km. The main point is that the orbital period of Charon is exactly the same as the rotation period of Pluto: 6.4 days, so that to a Plutonian observer Charon would remain fixed in the sky. The rotation period of Pluto had originally been measured in 1955, by M. Walker and R. Hardie, from variations in magnitude. It was also found that the axial inclination amounts to 122 . 5 ◦ , even more than that of Uranus. Charon moves in the plane of Pluto’s equator, so that the phase effects will be very strange – particularly as there are about 14 000 Plutonian days in every Plutonian year. From one hemisphere of Pluto, of course, Charon will never be seen at all. Charon has only about one-seventh the mass of Pluto, and Pluto contributes 80% of the total light we receive from the system, partly because it is larger and also because it has a higher albedo. Charon is ‘grey’, whereas Pluto is somewhat reddish. Very probably the two were once combined, and were separated following a massive impact in the early history of the Solar System. In 1999 A. Stern, R. Canup and D. Durda, of the Southwest Research Institute (Boulder, USA) suggested that some Kuiper Belt objects in neighbouring orbits to Pluto may in fact be d ́ ebris produced by the impact. I NTERNAL S TRUCTURE We do not yet have much positive information about the internal structure of either Pluto or Charon. Pluto’s density, over twice that of water, implies that there is more rock than in the icy satellites of the giant planets (perhaps around 70%). Below the frosty crust there may be a mantle of water ice, going down to between 200 and 300 km, and then a regionofpartiallyhydratedrock; theuppercrustisnotlikely to be more than a few kilometres of a few tens of kilometres deep. It is unclear whether or not Pluto is differentiated, but it is probable that the gravitational pressure is inadequate to increase the rock density deep inside the globe to a marked degree. Charon is much less dense than Pluto, so that the percentage of rock is presumably lower. S URFACE F EATURES The apparent diameter of Pluto is so small that surface fea- tures are beyond the range of ordinary telescopes; only the Hubble Space Telescope has been able to show anything at all definite. The first attempts to study the surface were made by L. Andersson and B. Fix, from 1973. They found that the amplitude of the light variations due to Pluto’s ro- tation were increasing, but that the mean magnitude was becoming fainter. From this they inferred that there are bright poles and that one of these poles, previously pre- sented to the Earth, was turning slowly away, so that more of the mid-latitude and equatorial zones were presented – where the ice would be ‘dirtier’ and older. Results from the IRAS satellite, in 1983, indicated the presence of a band near the equator which was bright at infra-red wavelengths but dark in visible wavelengths, so that it could be relatively frost-free. However, much better results came from a series of phenomena lasting from 1985 to 1990. M UTUAL P HENOMENA In 1978 Leif Andersson, of Sweden, pointed out that for a period occurring twice every Plutonian year – that is to say, every 124 Earth year s – a situation arises when the orbits are positioned in a way which allows for mutual transits and occultations. The first observation, when the edge of Charon passed in front of Pluto, was made by R. Binzel on 17 February 1985. Total events began in 1987 and ended in 1988, while the whole series of phenomena ended in September 1990. When Charon passed behind Pluto it was completely hidden, and Pluto’s spectrum could be seen alone; when Charon passed in front of Pluto the two spectra were seen together, but that of Pluto could be subtracted. It was found that the surface of Pluto is covered with methane ice, together with large crystals of frozen nitrogen (N 2 ) and some of water ice and carbon monoxide. No methane ice was found on Charon, where the surface layer was apparently due to water ice. These mutual phenomena were immensely informa- tive. It is fortunate that they occurred when they did; the situation will not recur for well over a century. In 1999 observations made with the 8.3 m Suburu Telescope on Mauna Kea, in Hawaii, detected solid ethane ( C 2 H 6 ) , nitrogen ( N 2 ) , methane ( CH 4 ) and carbon monox- ide (CO) on Pluto; the surface temperature was found to be − 233 ◦ C. The water ice layer on Charon was confirmed. 218 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"P LUTO Figure 13.1. Pluto. (Courtesy: NASA.) M APS O F P LUTO From July 1994 images of Pluto have been obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, and definite features have been seen. Pluto is in fact an unusually complex object. As ex- pected, there is a dark equatorial band and bright polar caps. Some of the features may be due to basins or impact craters, together with ridges, but others, including the prominent north polar cap, may be produced by the distribution of the frosts which migrate across Pluto’s surface because of the orbital and seasonal cycles. No names have been given to the features (a system based upon Underworld deities, fol- lowing my own suggestion, is now under consideration by the International Astronomical Union). No well-marked features have been seen on Charon. There are vague indications of a darkish band in one hemisphere and a brighter band in the other, but nothing at all definite. A TMOSPHERE Pluto does have an atmosphere, albeit a very tenuous one, with a ground density of a few microbars – or a few tens of microbars at most. Preliminary spectroscopic searches by Kuiper in 1943–4 were unsuccessful, but occultations of stars by Pluto have given definite proof that the atmosphere not only exists, but is surprisingly extensive. The first occultation measures were made in 1980. On 9 June 1988 Pluto passed in front of a 12th-magnitude star; the star began to fade at a distance of 1500 km from the centre of Pluto and itseemsthatthereisanuppertransparentlayerabout300km deep, with haze below – still not opaque enough to hide the surface. The main constituent is nitrogen (N 2 ), together with very small amounts of methane and carbon monoxide. This means that the atmosphere is not very dissimilar to that of Triton, although the surface coating of Pluto is different. Charon showed no trace of atmosphere, which in view of its much lower escape velocity is not surprising. It has been suggested that Charon’s original atmosphere escaped and was captured by Pluto; alternatively, that an excessively tenuous atmosphere envelops both bodies, but as yet our information is very incomplete. There is also the strong possibility that as Pluto moves out toward aphelion its atmosphere will freeze out, so that for part of each orbit there is no gaseous atmosphere at all. This is one reason why it is important to send a space-craft there before the atmosphere collapses, and the Kuiper Pluto Express mission is already being planned. If funded, it may be launched in late 2004; there will be a gravity assist from Jupiter in April–June 2006, and the probe will fly by Pluto and Charon in December 2012 at a minimum distance of 15 000 km. The fly-by velocity will be 17–18 km s − 1 , and THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 219"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"P LUTO data will be transmitted back to Earth for a year following the encounter. The probe will then continue on to the Kuiper Belt, searching for new members and imaging any which are suitably placed. Pluto is certainly a remote, lonely world, but it is not shrouded in permanent darkness; indeed, sunlight there will be at least 1500 times more powerful than full moonlight on Earth. Whether it will remain the outpost of the known planetary system remains to be seen. P LANET X There is still controversy as to whether or not a tenth planet exists. It is generally referred to as Plane tX–not to be confused with Lowell’s Planet X, which led to the identification of Pluto. Comets have again been called in as evidence. In 1950 studies of eight cometary orbits led K. Sch ̈ utte to assume the existenceofaplanetat77a.u., andhisworkwasextendedby H. H. Kritzinger, whose planet X moved at 65 a.u. Later, by ‘pairing’ data for two of Sch ̈ utte’s eight comets, he amended this distance to 75.1 a.u. and the period to 650 years, with an inclination of 40 ◦ and a magnitude of 10. A photographic search was undertaken in the indicated position, but with no result. Less convincing was a theory by M. E. Savin, who believed in a planet moving at 78 a.u. His method was to divide the known planets into two groups, inner and outer, and ‘pair’ them, but for some obscure reason he included the tiny asteroid 944 Hidalgo. Pairing ‘Planet X’ with Mercury, he produced a planet with a period of 685.5 years, an eccentricity of 0.3 and a mass 11.6 times that of the Earth. Needless to say, no confirmation was forthcoming. The ‘comet family’ idea has also been discussed by J. J. Matese and D. P. Whitmire (1986), V. P. Tomanov (1986) and A. S. Guliev (1987). Guliev claimed that a new cometary family could be identified, consisting of comets Halley, di Vico, Westphal, Pons–Gambart, Brorsen–Metcalf and V ̈ ais ̈ al ̈ a 2. Projections of their aphelia of their orbits on to the celestial sphere concentrate near a large circle, indicating the existence of Planet X moving within the corresponding plane; the distance was given by Guliev as 36.2 a.u. Tomanov came to much the same conclusion as Guliev. Matese and Whitmire believed that there are ‘showers’ or periodical comets associated with the passage of Planet X through the Oort cloud, and they linked this with cratering and fossil records showing periods of major impacts on Earth, modulated with a period of about 30 000 000 years. Their Planet X moved between 50 and 100 a.u. In 1975 G. A. Chebotarev of what was then Leningrad used the aphelia of periodical comets to predict two outer planets, one at 53.7 a.u. and the other at 100 a.u. Much more recently (1999) J. Murray of the Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland has used the orbits of very long-period comers to indicate the presence of a very massive planet orbiting the Sun at a distance of around one light-year. This is of course highly speculative, and the detection of a planet at so great a distance seems to be out of the question at the present time. Halley’s Comet was also involved. In 1952 R. S. Richardson made an attempt to measure the mass of Pluto by its perturbing effects on the comet. He decided that Pluto had no detectable influence, but that there might be an Earth-sized planet moving at 36.2 a.u, or 1 a.u. beyond the aphelion point of the comet; this would delay the return of the comet to perihelion by one day, while a similar planet at 35.3 a.u. would produce a delay of six days. A somewhat desultory search was put in hand, but with no result. In 1972 J. A. Brady, of the University of California, used the movements of Halley’s Comet to indicate the presence of a Saturn-sized planet moving in a retrograde orbit at a distance of 59.9 a.u.; he believed the magnitude to be about 14 and indicated that the planet was situated in Cassiopiæ. Searches were made, but he planet refused to show itself, and it was generally agreed that Brady’s calculations were fatally flawed. In September 1988 new predictions, based on the movements of Uranus, were made by R. Harrington, from the US Naval Observatory in Washington. His planet had a period of 600 years and a mass two to five times that of the Earth, with a present distance of around 9.6 thousand million km; he gave a position in the Scorpius–Sagittarius area, but again there was no result. A different line of approach as adopted by J. D. Anderson of the JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Pasadena, California). He claimed that there were gen- uine unexplained perturbations in the motions of Uranus and Neptune between 1810 and 1910, but not since. This would indicate a Planet X with a very eccentric orbit, now 220 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"P LUTO near its aphelion and therefore unable to produce measur- able effects. Anderson gave it an inclination of about 90 ◦ and a period of between 700 and 1000 years, and a mass five times that of the Earth. Anderson suggested that the pertur- bations due to this planet would again become measurable about the year 2060. We must wait and see. Uranus was again used by C. Powell, of JPL, in 1987; his planet would be located in Gemini and would move at about 39.8 a.u. with a period of 251 years – an orbit not unlike Pluto’s. A brief search was made from the Lowell Observatory, but with the usual lack of success. Four space-craft – Pioneers 10 and 11, and Voyagers 1 and 2 – are now leaving the planetary system in various directions, and it is possible that unexpected deviations might lead to the tracking down of Planet X, but this would require an enormous slice of luck. (On a less serious note, I made some calculations in 1981, assuming that the real Planet X was in the same area of the sky as Pluto in 1930, that it moved about as far be- yond the path of Neptune as Neptune is from Uranus, that its diameter was about equal to that of Neptune and that the eccentricity and inclination were low. From this, I worked out a 1981 position near the star χ Leonis. I was however hardly surprised when a search, carried out with the modest 39 cm reflector in my observatory, failed to show any new member of the Solar System.) Recently, it has been claimed that improved values for the masses of Uranus and Neptune, obtained from the Voyager 2 data, show that no unexplained perturbations occur, and that Planet X does not exist. This may or may not be the case. If Planet X is real, it will no doubt be found eventually, but for the moment there is little more to be said. One final comment may, however, be worth nothing. Assuming that Planet X comes to light, a name will have to be found for it and one favourite is ‘Minerva’. In fact this was one of the names suggested for Tombaugh’s planet in 1930, but the suggestion came from T. J. J. See, who was – to put it mildly – unpopular with his contemporaries. This is why Minerva is now called Pluto! THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 221"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"14 C OMETS Comets are the most erratic members of the Solar System. They may sometimes look spectacular, but they are not nearly so important as they then seem, and by planetary standards their masses are very low indeed. In most cases, though not all, their orbits round the Sun are highly eccentric. A comet has been aptly described as ‘a dirty ice-ball’. C OMET P ANICS In earlier times comets were not classed as being celestial bodies, and were put down as atmospheric phenomena, although it is true that around 500 BC the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras regarded them as being due to clusters of faint stars. They were always regarded as unlucky. Recall the lines in Shakespeare’s Julius Cæsar : When beggars die, there are no comets seen: The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes. In 1578 the Lutheran bishop Andreas Calichus went further, and described comets as being ‘the thick smoke of human sins, rising every day, every moment, full of stench and horror before the fact of God’. However, his Hungarian contemporary, Andreas Dudith, sagely pointed out that in this case the sky would never be comet-free! The first proof that comets were extraterrestrial came from the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, who found that the comet of 1577 showed no diurnal parallax, and must therefore be at least six times as far away as the Moon (actually, of course, it was much more remote than that). Comets were viewed with alarm partly for astrological reasons and partly because it was thought that a direct collision between the Earth and a comet might mean the end of the world. In 1696 a book by William Whiston, who succeeded Isaac Newton as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, predicted that Doomsday would come on 16 October 1736, when a comet would strike the Earth. In France, in 1773, a mathematical paper by the well-known astronomer J. J. de Lalande was misinterpreted, and led to the popular belief that a comet would strike the Earth on 20 or 21 May. (Seats in Paradise were sold by members of the Clergy at inflated prices.) Another alarm occurred in 1832, when it was suggested – wrongly – that there would be a very near encounter with Biela’s periodical comet. In 1843, at the time of a particularly brilliant comet, there was a widespread end-of- the-world panic in America, due to the dire prophecies of one William Miller. And in 1910, when Halley’s Comet was on view, a manufacturer in the United States made a large sum of money by selling what he called anti- comet pills, and many people sealed up their windows to keep out poisonous gases. Bennett’s Comet of 1970 was mistaken by some Arabs for an Israeli war weapon, and Kohoutek’s Comet of 1973 was also regarded as a threat; it was expected to become brilliant, although in the event it failed to do so. In 1994 a curious prophet named Sofia Richmond (‘Sister Gabriel’) achieved a degree of notoriety by predicting that a collision between Halley’s Comet and the planet Jupiter (!) would result in the destruction of mankind. Finally, there are the books by an eccentric Russian-born psychoanalyst, Immanuel Velikovsky, who confused planets with comets, and believed that Venus had been a comet only a few thousands of years ago; he also maintained that Biblical events, notably the Flood, were due to comets. However, Velikovsky’s ignorance of astronomy was so complete that trying to argue with him was a decidedly pointless exercise. T HE N ATURE O F C OMETS In 1948 the Cambridge astronomer R. A. Lyttleton popularized the ‘flying sandbank’ theory of comets. He believed that dust particles were collected by the Sun during its passage through an interstellar cloud, and that these particles collected into ‘clouds’ which he identified as comets. There were fatal weaknesses in this theory, and in 1950 it was abandoned in favour of the model proposed by F. L. Whipple. The nucleus of a comet – the only reasonably ‘solid’ part – is made up of rocky fragments held together 222 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"C OMETS by frozen ices such as H 2 O, methane, carbon dioxide and ammonia. When a comet is warmed as it approaches perihelion, the rise in temperature leads to evaporation, so that the comet develops a head or coma, often together with a tail or tails. Cometary tails always point more or less away from the Sun, and are of two types. There is a gas or ion tail; the molecules are repelled by the ‘solar wind’. With a dust tail, the particles are driven out by the pressure of sunlight. This all means that when a comet is receding from the Sun, it travels tail-first; in general, ion tails are straight, while dust tails are curved. Many comets have tails of both types, although smaller, fainter comets never develop tails of any kind. C OMET N OMENCLATURE Traditionally, comets are named after their discoverer or discoverers; thus the bright comet of 1996 was discovered by the Japanese amateur Y. Hyakutake and is named after him, while the even brighter comet of 1997 was detected independently from America by Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp, and is known as Hale–Bopp. No more than three names are now allowed. Sometimes the discoverers of different returns of the same comet are used; thus in 1881 W. F. Denning discovered a comet with a period of between 8 and 9 years, and it was not seen again until recovered in 1978 by S. Fujikawa, so that it is listed as Denning–Fujikawa. Occasionally the name used is that of the first computer of the orbit (as with comets Halley, Encke and Crommelin; this applies only to periodical comets). Up to 1994 a comet was also assigned a letter in order of discovery during the year, and then a permanent designation using Roman numerals, in order of perihelion passage. Thus Halley’s Comet was the ninth comet to be found in 1982 and became 1982i; it was the third comet to pass perihelion in 1986 and became 1986 III. A new system was introduced in 1995, similar to that used for asteroids. Each year is divided into 24 sections, with its own letter (I and Z being omitted). Each comet is given a designation depending on the year of discovery, with a capital letter to indicate its half-month and a number to show the order of discovery in that half-month. Thus Comet Hale–Bopp, found on 23 July 1995 became 1995 O1, Table 14.1. Letter designations for comets. A Jan 1–15 B Jan 16–31 C Feb 1–15 D Feb 16–29 E Mar 1–15 F Mar 16–31 G Apr 1–15 H Apr 16–30 J May 1–15 K May 16–31 L Jun 1–15 M Jun 16–30 N Jul 1–15 O Jul 16–31 P Aug 1–15 Q Aug 16–31 R Sep 1–15 S Sep 16–30 T Oct 1–15 U Oct 16–31 V Nov 1–15 W Nov 16–30 X Dec 1–15 Y Dec 16–31 as it was the first comet to be discovered during the period between 16 and 30 July. A list of the letter designations is given in Table 14.1. There are also prefixes. Basically, comets are divided into two classes; periodical, with orbital periods of less than 250 years, and non-periodical, with periods so long that they cannot be predicted with any accuracy. P/ indicates a periodical comet; D/ a periodical comet which has either disintegrated or been lost; C/ a non-periodical comet. (Strictly speaking, this is incorrect; all comets will return eventually unless they have been perturbed by planets and thrown into parabolic or hyperbolic paths.) Thus Halley’s Comet, with a period of 76 years, is P/Halley; Westphal’s Comet, which was seen to ‘fade away’ in 1913, is D/Westphal; Hale–Bopp, with a period of over 2000 years, is C/Hale–Bopp. A few comets which are observable all round their orbits are not given letter designations; such is P/Encke, with a period of 3.3 years. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 223"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"C OMETS Two comets have been given both cometary and asteroidal designations; Comet P/Wilson–Harrington is Asteroid 4015 and Comet P/Elst–Pizarro is Asteroid 7968. The distinction between comets and small asteroids has become decidedly blurred. S TRUCTURE O F C OMETS A comet is made up essentially of three parts; a nucleus, a head or coma, and a tail or tails. The nucleus of an average comet is surprisingly small. Halley’s Comet, which is large by cometary standards, had a nucleus measuring 15 km × 8km × 8 km. Hale–Bopp, the bright comet of 1997, was one of the largest on record; even so, its nucleus was no more than about 40 km across, while Hyakutake, which was brilliant briefly in 1996, was very small indeed; the diameter of its nucleus can have been no more than 3 km at most. Only one cometary nucleus has been really well seen; that of Halley’s Comet in 1986, from the Giotto space- craft. Otherwise, we are handicapped. When a nucleus is unshrouded, the comet is far away; as it draws inward, the nucleus is surrounded by gas and dust, which masks it effectively. Judging from the Halley results, a nucleus is covered with a layer of blackish organic material. Under this is an icy body; the ices are of various kinds, notably water, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. In general these ices are shielded from sunlight, but in isolated areas jets are able to spring out to produce material for the coma and tails. Some comets are active in this respect; others relatively inert. A coma does not usually form until the comet is within about 3 a.u. of the Sun, when there is marked sublimation of the water ice. Gas flows outward and it is this which wrenches dust particles away from the main body of the comet. A coma may be very large (the coma of the Great Comet of 1811 was larger than the Sun) but is highly rarefied. With comets which are poor in dust, comæ are usually round; with dusty comets the comæ are fan-shaped or parabolic, and there is no hard, sharp boundary between the coma and the tail. Therateofgasoutflowisveryhigh. CometHale–Bopp was probably losing 1000 tons of dust and 1200 tons of water per second when it was close to perihelion. Some comets, such as P/Tempel 2, are rich in dust grains; observations made with IRAS (the Infra-Red Astronomical Satellite) in 1983 indicated that in this comet the particles ranged from tiny grains up to ‘pebbles’ as much as 6 cm in diameter. Tails are of two main types. Ion tails (otherwise known as plasma tails or gas tails) are repelled by the solar wind, and are generally straight. Our information comes mainly from spectroscopic research (the first good cometary spectrum was obtained by the Italian astronomer G. Donati as long ago as 1864), and magnetic effects are all important, particularly as the solar wind carries a magnetic current. These tails consist largely of ionized carbon monoxide (CO + ) which tends to fluoresce under the influence of sunlight; this is why plasma tails have a bluish tinge. Tails can be very extended. That of the Great Comet of 1843 was 330 000 000 km long, which is greater than the distance between the Sun and the orbit of Mars. In April 2000 the space-probe Ulysses, which had been launched to survey the poles of the Sun, passed fortuitously through the tail of Comet C/1996 B2 (Hyakutake) and found that the length of the tail was over 500 million km. This is the longest tail ever recorded. Plasma tails show rapid changes, due largely to variations in the solar wind; these changes are much more evident in some comets than in others. Shock waves caused by solar flares may produce ‘kinks’ or even spiral effects. There are also marked ‘disconnection’ effects, caused when the comet crosses a region where the polarity of the solar wind changes; magnetic field lines inside the tail then cross and re-connect, severing the link with the region close to the nucleus on the sunward side. The tail breaks away and a new one is formed. This happened spectacularly with Halley’s Comet at the 1986 return, and also with Comet Hyakutake in 1996. Dust tails are generally curved; the particles in them are around the size of smoke particles and the tails are yellowish, since they shine only by reflected sunlight. Occasionally a comet may appear to have an ‘anti-tail’, pointing sunward – as with Comet Arend–Roland of 1957, nicknamed ‘the spiked comet’. In fact, what is seen is not a tail, but material in the comet’s orbit catching the sunlight at a suitable angle. Arend–Roland showed it particularly well, since it was exceptionally rich in dust. ( En passant , 224 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"C OMETS this comet will never return. Planetary perturbations threw it into a hyperbolic orbit, and it has now made its permanent departure from the Solar System.) In 1969 observations made from the OAO 2 (Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2) led to the detection of a vast hydrogen cloud around a comet, Tago–Sago–Kosaka; the cloud was 1600 000 km in diameter. Similar clouds were also found with other comets, notably Bennett (1970) and Kohoutek (1973), and there is no reason to doubt that they are quite common features of large comets. Thematerialformingthecomaandtailsispermanently lost to the comet. This indicates that comets are short-lived by cosmical standards; 0.1–1% of the total mass will be lost eachtimethecometpassesthroughperihelion. Obviously, a comet of short period will ‘waste away’ much more quickly than a comet of longer period, and this explains why all the comets of really short period are faint. Very few of them ever achieve naked-eye visibility. S HORT-PERIOD C OMETS Faint short-period comets are common, and more are discovered every year. Comets which have been observed at more than one return are given numbers, roughly in order of identification; thus Halley, the first to have its period recognized, is P/1, while Encke, which was next identified, is P/2. The first 140 periodical comets are listed in Table 14.12, and data for selected comets are given in Table14.13. Someperiodicalcometsseenatonlyonereturn are listed in Table 14.2; some of these may be recovered eventually. In these tables, A indicates the absolute magnitude of the comet – that is to say, the magnitude it would have if seen at a distance of 1 a.u. from the Sun and 1 a.u. from the Earth. A glance at Table 14.13 shows that many short-period comets have their aphelia at about the distance of Jupiter from the Sun (just over 5 a.u.). These are said to make up Jupiter’s ‘comet family’, and as Jupiter is much the most massive planet in the Solar System it is bound to exert great influence. Comet families of the other giant planets are ill-defined, if they exist at all. The comet with the shortest known period is Encke’s (P/2), named in honour of the mathematician who first computed its orbit. The comet was first seen on 17 January 1786 by P. M ́ echain, from France. It was again recorded on 7 November 1795 by Caroline Herschel; the next returns to be seen were those of 1805 (discovered by Thulis at Marseilles, 19 October) and 1818 (Jean Pons, 26 November). J. F. Encke, at Berlin, decided that these comets must be identical, and predicted a return for 1822. He was correct, and subsequently the comet has been seen at every return except that of 1944, when it was badly placed and most astronomers were otherwise engaged. It can now be followed all round its orbit. Usually it is much too faint to be seen without optical aid, but occasionally it becomes a naked-eye object – as in 1947, when it rose to the fourth magnitude. It can also develop a short tail. The orbital period has shortened slightly since the comet was first seen; Encke himself explained this by assuming the existence or a resisting medium near the Sun, but it is now known that the real cause is a sort of ‘rocket’ effect. Jets emitted from active areas on the nucleus will accelerate or retard the comet’s motion according to the direction in which they leave the nucleus. All comets are rotating, and so the direction of the spin axis changes. For example, Halley’s Comet returns to perihelion an average of 4.1 days late at every return, so that the nucleus must be rotating in the same direction as the comet’s motion round the Sun; the thrust of the escaping gases reaches a peak in the ‘afternoon’ of the comet’s ‘day’. The resulting jet force pushes the comet forward in its orbit, the nucleus drifts outward from the Sun, the orbital period increases and perihelion occurs later than predicted. Some comets have orbits of low eccentricity. The first discovered of these was Schwassmann–Wachmann 1 (1925); its path lies entirely between those of Jupiter and Saturn. Normally it is a very faint object, but it can show sudden, unpredictable outbursts which bring it within the range of small telescopes; thus in 1976 the magnitude rose to above 12. Other comets which remain in view throughout their orbits are Gunn and Smirnova–Chernykh. Oterma’s Comet used to have low eccentricity and a period of 7.9 years, but a close approach to Jupiter in 1963 altered the period to over 19 years. Perihelion distance is now over 800 000 000 km, so that the comet is a very faint object. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 225"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"C OMETS Table 14.2.

The period is 5.6 years and the orbit lies wholly within the main asteroid belt, so that the object has ‘dual nationality’; it is Comet P/133 Elst–Pizarro and also Asteroid 7968. These cases add support to the suggestion that some Earth-grazing asteroids may well be ex-comets which have lost all their volatiles. Some periodical comets have been ‘lost’, either be- cause they have disintegrated or because we have failed to keep track of them (Table 14.3). The classic case is that of Biela’s Comet. It was discovered in 1772 by Montaigne, from France; it returned in 1806 and again in 1826, when it was discovered by an Austrian amateur, W. von Biela. Biela recognized its identity with the 1772 and 1806 comets, and his name was justifiably attached to it. It returned in 1832, was missed in 1839 because it was badly placed, and recov- ered once more in 1846, when it astounded astronomers by dividing in two. The twins came back on schedule in 1852, but this was their last appearance. They were unfavourably placed in 1859, but should have been well seen in 1866; however, they failed to appear, and have never been seen since. Undoubtedly they have disintegrated, and their rem- nants were later seen in the form of meteors, although by now the meteor shower seems to have died out. Westphal’s Comet was seen in 1852 and again in 1913, but failed to survive perihelion and did not return on schedule in 1976; Brorsen’s Comet was seen at five returns between 1846 and 1879, but has not appeared since, and has evidently broken up. However, one must beware of jumping to conclusions. Comet Di Vico–Swift was lost for 38 years after 1897, but was recovered in 1965; Holmes’ Comet ‘went missing’ for 58 years prior to its recovery in 1964, following calcula- tions by B. G. Marsden. It is important to note that flimsy objects such as comets are easily perturbed by planets, and no two cycles are exactly alike. One comet which will certainly never be seen is Shoemaker–Levy 9. In July 1994 it impacted Jupiter, and is described on page 152. It is worth noting that in 1886 Comet P/16 Brooks 2 had a close encounter with Jupiter, and passed within the orbit of Io. The encounter was not actually seen, but at the return of 1889 the comet was seen to be accompanied by four minor companions, which were classified as ‘splinters’ and did not last for long. Also, Comet P/82 Gehrels 3 was in orbit round Jupiter for some time during the 1970s, but escaped unharmed in 1973, and returned to solar orbit. Comets can also make close approaches to the Earth (Table 14.4).

Messier; A. Lexell of St Petersburg computed the orbit. The minimum distance from Earth was 2200 000 km, and the comet was visible with the naked eye. The period was then 5.6 years, but a subsequent encounter with Jupiter, in July 1779, changed the orbit completely; the current period is thought to be around 250 years, and from our point of view the comet is hopelessly lost. All these comets have direct motion, but with longer periods we begin to encounter retrograde motions. Comet P/109 Swift–Tuttle will next return in 2127; for a time there were fears that it might be on a collision course, but this does not now seem to be the case. Halley’s Comet also has retrograde motion. For comets seen at more than one return, the longest period is that of P/35 Herschel–Rigollet, seen in 1788 and 1939 (Table 14.5). 228 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"C OMETS H ALLEY’S C OMET Much the most famous of all comets is P/1 Halley. It may have been recorded by the Chinese as early as 1059 BC; since 240 BC it has been seen at every return. The mean period is 76 years. A list of known returns is given in Table 14.6. There are many historical references to Halley’s Comet. In 684 Ma-tuan-lin, the Chinese historian, refers to a comet seen in the western sky during September and October; this was certainly Halley’s, and the first known drawing of it relates to this return. The drawing was published in the N ̈ urnberg Chronicle ; this was printed in 1493, and shows woodcuts by the German artist M. Wolgemuth. In 837 the comet was at its very best; on 11 April it was a mere 0.03 a.u. from the Earth (4500 000 km) and the tail extended over 93 ◦ , while the brightness of the coma rivalled Venus. The return of 1066 was shown in the Bayeux Tapestry; King Harold is tottering on his throne, while his courtiers gaze up in horror. The return of 1301 was favourable; one man who saw it was the Florentine painter Giotto di Bondone, who later used it as a model for the Star of Bethlehem in his Adoration of the Magi . (In fact there is no chance that the comet can be identified with the Star of Bethlehem; it returned years too early.) At the return of 1456 the comet was again bright, and, as usual, was regarded as an evil omen. At that time the Turkish forces were laying siege to Belgrade, and on the night of 8 June it was said that ‘a fearsome apparitionappearedinthesky, withalongtaillikeadragon’. The current Pope, Calixtus III, went so far as to preach against the comet as an agent of the Devil, although it is unlikely that he excommunicated it, as has sometimes been claimed! In 1672 the comet was seen by Edmond Halley (the actual discovery was made on 15 August of that year by G. Dorffel) and subsequently Halley decided that it must be identical with comets previously seen in 1607 and in 1531. He predicted a return of 1758. On Christmas Night of that year the comet was duly found, by the German amateur J. Palitzsch, and passed through perihelion in March 1759. This was the first predicted cometary return. Since then the comet has been back in 1835, 1910 and 1986. In 1835 the comet was recovered on 6 August by Dumouchel and di Vico, from Rome, close to the predicted position near the star ζ Tauri. It remained prominent for weeks later in the year, and was followed until 20 May 1836; the last observation of it was made by Sir John Herschel from the Cape. For 1910 very accurate predictions were made by P. Cowell and A. C. D. Crommelin, from Greenwich; the discovery was made on 12 September 1909 by Max Wolf, from Germany, and the comet was followed until 15 June 1911, by which time its distance from the Sun was over 800 000 000 km. It was brilliant enough to cause general interest – although it was not so bright as the non- periodical ‘Daylight Comet’, which had been seen earlier in 1910, several weeks before Halley’s Comet reached its brightest magnitude. On 18–19 May 1910 the comet passed in transit across the face of the Sun. The American astronomer F. Ellerman went to Hawaii to observe under the best possible conditions, but could seen no trace of the comet. The 1910 return was the first occasion when the comet could be studied with photographic and spectroscopic equipment, and it was fortunate that the comet was well placed. The Earth was closest to the comet on 20 May, at a range of around 21 000 000 km; the closest encounter between the Earth and the comet’s tail was about 400 000 km, and there was some public unease because it had become known that comet tails contain unpleasant substances such as cyanogen. This is true enough, but the density of a tail is so low that there can be no possible ill-effects on this score. At its best the tail was at least 140 ◦ long. The comet was indeed a magnificent sight, even if it could not equal the Daylight Comet of the preceding January. The last perihelion occurred on 9 February 1986. The comet was recovered on 16 October 1982 by a team of astronomers at Palomar (Jewitt, Danielson and Dressler) who used the Hale reflector to detect the comet as a tiny blur of magnitude 24.3; it was a mere 8 arcsec away from its predicted position. The discovery was confirmed shortly afterwards from Kitt Peak. At the time of its recovery, the comet was still moving between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus.

The comet was well south of the celestial equator when at its brightest; at one time it was close to the globular cluster ω Centauri, and with the naked eye the comet and the cluster looked very similar. On 24 April 1986 there was a total eclipse of the Moon and for many people (including myself) this was 230 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"C OMETS the last chance to see the comet without optical aid; the magnitude had by then fallen to 4.5, slightly brighter than the adjacent star α Crateris. The fan-shaped tail was still much in evidence. By 1986 space probes had been developed, and five missions were dispatched; two Russian, two Japanese and one European (Table 14.7). (The Americans withdrew on the grounds of expense.) All the Halley probes were successful. The European mission, named Giotto in honour of the painter, was programmed to pass into the comet’s inner coma and image the nucleus, but prior information sent back by the Japanese and Russian missions was invaluable. Giotto passed within 605 km of the comet’s nucleus on the night of 13–14 March 1986. It carried a camera, the HMC (Halley Multicolour Camera) and this functioned until 14 seconds before closest approach to the nucleus, when it was made to gyrate by the impact of a dust particle probably about the size of a grain of rice and communications were temporarily interrupted; in fact the camera never worked again, and the closest image was obtained at 1675 km from the nucleus. The nucleus itself measured 15 km × 8km × 8 km, and was shaped rather like a peanut; it had a total volume of over 500 km 3 , and a mass of from 50 000 million to 100 000 million tons. The mean density was 0.1–0.2 g cm − 3 ; it would take 60 000 million comets of this mass to equal the mass of the Earth. The nucleus was dark-coated, with an albedo of 2–4%. Water ice appeared to be the main constituent of the nucleus (84%) followed by formaldehyde and carbon dioxide (each around 3%) and smaller amounts of other volatiles, including nitrogen and carbon monoxide. The shape of the terminator showed that the central region was smoother than the ends; a bright patch 1.5 km in diameter was assumed to be a hill, and there were features which appeared to be craters, around 1 km across. Dust-jets were active, although from only a small area of the nucleus on the sunward side. The sunward side was found to have a temperature of 47 ◦ C, far higher than expected, and from this it was inferred that the icy nucleus was coated with a layer of warmer, dark dust. The icy nucleus was eroded at around 1 cm per day near perihelion, and at each return the comet must lose around 300 000 000 tons of material. The rotation period was found to be 53 h with respect to the long axis of the nucleus, with a 7.3-day rotational period around the axis; the nucleus was in fact ‘precessing’ rather in the manner of a toppling gyroscope. As the comet drew away from the Sun, activity naturally died down. Observations made with large telescopes – notably by R. West with the 1.54 m Danish telescope at La Silla – showed that in April to May 1988 and January 1989 the images were still diffuse, indicating some residual activity or possibly a cloud of dust, but by February 1990, when the distance from the Sun was 12.5 a.u. and the magnitude had fallen to 24.3, the image appeared stellar. Then, on 12 February 1991, C. Hainaut and A. Smette, with the Danish telescope, recorded a major outburst; the magnitude rose to 18.9, even though the distance from the Sun had increased to 14.5 a.u. On 22 February, Smette used the New Technology Telescope at La Silla to obtain a spectrum. The coma showed a solar-type spectrum, with no emission features, which indicated a dust composition. It was subsequently found that structures within the coma varied with time, while the central region faded by about 1 magnitude per month. It seems that a fan-like structure, in the approximate direction of the Sun, reached a radius of 61 000 km on 13 February, expanding to 142 000 km by 12 April. If the expansion of the coma material were about 14.5 m s − 1 , the actual outburst would have occurred on 17 December 1990, lasting for three months or so. A short explosive event is ruled out – it would have involved higher velocities for the dust than were observed. The cause of the outburst is uncertain. A collision with a wandering body is possible, but seems unlikely; possibly a pocket of volatile carbon monoxide ice was exposed to sunlight, and the vaporizing gases carried the dust particles away from the nucleus, but this also seems improbable in view of the comet’s distance from the Sun. We may have to await the 2061 return before solving the problem. Thelastimageofthecometwasobtainedon11January 1994. By June 1994 the comet had reached the halfway point between perihelion and aphelion. It will next reach perihelion in 2024. Unfortunately the return of 2061 will be as poor as that of 1986: for another really good view we must wait for the return of 2137.

They used an older probe, ISEE (the International Sun–Earth Explorer) which had been launched in 1978 for a completely different pur- pose, and had been orbiting the Earth monitoring the effects of the solar wind on the Earth’s outer atmosphere. It car- ried a full complement of instruments, and had a large fuel reserve. On 10 June 1982 it was re-named ICE (the Interna- tional Cometary Explorer) and began a series of manœuvres and orbital changes, involving a sequence of ‘swing-by’ passages around the Moon; at the pass of 22 December 1983 ICE was a mere 196 km from the lunar surface. The closest approach to the comet’s nucleus occurred on 11 September 1985(beforetheHalleyarmadareacheditstarget); therange was 7800 km and the relative velocity was 20.5 km s − 1 . The probe took 20 min to cross the ion tail, and collisions with dust grains were recorded as well as magnetic effects. The distance from Earth was then 70 000 000 km. The Giotto probe was put into ‘hibernation’ in April 1986, and was re-activated on 19 February 1990. On 2 July it flew past Earth at 22 730 km, and used the gravity-assist technique to put it into a path to rendezvous with comet P/Grigg–Skjellerup. After a further hibernation period, Giotto was again reactivated on 4 May 1992, when it was 219 000 000 km from Earth, and on 10 July 1982 it encountered Grigg–Skjellerup, passing only 200 km from the nucleus. Most of the instruments on the space-craft were still working, apart from the camera, and valuable data were secured. Grigg–Skjellerup is a much older comet than Halley, and seldom produces a tail; however, the density of the gas near the nucleus was greater than expected, and there was a good deal of fine ‘dust’. It was found that the gas coma extended to at least 50 000 km beyond the visible boundary. Giotto suffered no damage, although it was hit by a particle about 3 mm across. Giotto is still in solar orbit, although it does not retain sufficient gas to send it on to another comet, as had originally been hoped. On February 1999 NASA launched a new mission, Stardust, to rendezvous with comet P/Wild 2 in 2004; it is hoped that samples can be collected and returned to Earth in a capsule. Other missions are being planned, although, as usual, funding is always a problem. B RILLIANT C OMETS Brilliant comets have been seen now and then all through the historical period, although early reports, most of them Chinese, are bound to be rather vague. A selected list of bright comets between the years 1500 and 1900 is given in Table 14.8. (In fact Sarabat’s Comet of 1729 may have been the largest ever observed, but it was never less than 4.05 a.u. from the Sun and so did not become bright in our skies.) The Great Comet of 1744 attained magnitude − 7, and was visible in broad daylight when only 12 ◦ from the Sun. At perihelion it was only 33 000 000 km from the Sun, well inside the orbit of Mercury, and it had at least six bright, broad tails. The Great Comet of 1811, discovered by Honor ́ e Flaugergues on 25 March, was also a daylight 232 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"C OMETS Table 14.8.

En passant , the wine crop in Portugal was particularly good, and for years afterwards ‘Comet Wine’ appeared in the price lists of wine merchants. A bottle was sold at Sotheby’s, in London, in 1984. (It would be interesting to know what it must have tasted like.) The brightest comet of modern times was probaby that of 1843. According to the famous astronomer Sir Thomas Maclear, it surpassed the comet of 1811, and Maclear saw both. Donati’s Comet of 1858 was said to be the most beautiful of all; it was discovered by G. Donati, from Florence, on 2 June 1858 and was finally lost on 4 March 1859. It had a wonderfully curved main tail and two smaller ones; the tail length was around 80 000 000 km. The period is unknown, but may be of the order of 2000 years. Tebbutt’s Comet of 1861 was brilliant, and it seems that the Earth passed through its tail on 30 June. Despite some unconfirmed reports of an unusual daytime darkness and a yellowish sky, no unusual phenomena were seen. The first photograph of a comet (Donati’s) was taken on 27 September 1858 by an English portrait artist, Usherwood, with a f/ 2 . 4 focal ratio portrait lens; but the first really good picture was taken in 1882 of Cruls’ Comet, at the instigation of Sir David Gill. Many stars were also shown, and it was this picture which made David Gill, Director of the Cape Observatory, appreciate the endless potentialities of stellar photography. Earlier in 1882, on 17 May, a comet was found on an image of the total eclipse of the Sun, seen from Egypt. The comet had never been seen before, and it was never seen again, so that this is the only record of it; it is generally referred to as Tewfik’s Comet, in honour of the Khedive, ruler of Egypt at the time, who had made the astronomers very welcome. T HE T WENTIETH C ENTURY The last century has been relatively poor in brilliant comets; only those of 1910 and 1965 have come anywhere near to matching the splendour of the shadow-casting comets of the Victorian era. A list of selected bright 20th-century comets is given in Table 14.9. The Daylight Comet of 1910 was first seen on 13 January by some diamond miners in South Africa. It passed perihelion on 17 January, and earlier had been seen with the naked eye when only 4 . 5 ◦ from the Sun. It was much brighter than Halley’s – and people who claim to have seen Halley’s Comet in 1910 usually saw the Daylight Comet instead. Its orbit is elliptical, but the period seems to be of the order of 4000 000 years. The bright comet of 1948 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 233"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"C OMETS Table 14.9.

It will return in around 95 000 years. Of course, all periods of this order are very uncertain; some estimated values are given in Table 14.10. The brightest 20th century comet was that of 1965, Ikeya-Seki, discovered on 18 September by two Japanese observers. It was a daylight object, and could be seen when only 2 ◦ from the Sun, but it faded quickly, and was never really well seen from Britain. The period has been given as 880 years. Other fairly conspicuous comets were Arend–Roland (1957), Bennett (1970) and West (1975). Kohoutek’s Comet of 1973 was a disappointment. It was found on 7 March by L. Kohoutek, from Hamburg, when it was still 700 000 000 km from the Sun. Few comets are detectable as far away as this, and the comet was expected to become a magnificent object in the winter of 1973–4, but it failed to come up to expectations even though it was visible with the naked eye. It was, however, scientifically important, and was carefully studied by the astronauts then aboard the US space-station Skylab (Carr, Gibson and Pogue). Perhaps it will do better when it next returns to the Sun, in approximately 75 000 years’ time. Two splendid comets were seen near the close of the millennium. The first, C/1996 B2, was discovered on 30 January by the Japanese amateur Yuji Hyakutake. It passed perihelion on 1 May, and was then striking in the far north of the sky; it had a long tail – the length was subsequently found to be over 500 million km as found by the Ulysses space-probe which passed through it in 2000. Its beauty was enhanced by its greenish colour. It was in fact a very small comet, and owed its brilliance to its closeness to the Earth. Its original period seems to have been about 8000 years, but its orbit was altered during its journey through the inner Solar System, and the next return is likely to be postponed for 14 000 years. 234 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"C OMETS Table 14.10.

Had it come as close to us as Hyakutake had done, it would have cast shadows; it was an exceptionally large comet – the nucleus was at least 40 km in diameter – and there were both plasma and dust tails, plus a third inconspicuous tail made up of sodium.

However, it remained a naked-eye object for well over a year, and was truly beautiful – it must be the most photographed comet in history. There were marked changes in the tails, and a spiral structure in the coma. Apparently it was last at perihelion 4200 years ago, and will be back in 2360 years’ time. Its orbital inclination is over 89 ◦ ,so that its path lies almost at right angles to that of the Earth. Perihelion was passed on 1 April 1997. The axial rotation period was given as 11.4 h. S UN-GRAZING C OMETS Some comets pass very close to the Sun; such were the comets of 1843 and 1965. During the last century H. Kreutz suggested that these ‘sun-grazers’ might be the remnants of a single giant comet which broke up near its perihelion, and the sun-grazers are often referred to as Kreutz comets. Some of them may hit the Sun, and are quickly destroyed; such was C/1979 Q1 (Howard– Kooman–Michels), on 31 August of that year. Its last moments were recorded by the SOLWIND satellite. Others have been recorded since, and it now seems that ‘kamikaze’ comets are relatively common. A selected list of Kreutz Comets is given in Table 14.11. On 1 and 2 June 1998 the SOHO satellite recorded two comets plunging into the Sun, one after the other. By now the SOHO instruments have discovered over 100 comets, including a number of Sun-grazers. T HE O RIGIN O F C OMETS Comets are very ancient objects – as old as the Solar System itself. Since they lose material at every return to perihelion, it follows that the comets we now see cannot have remained in their present orbits for thousands of millions of years. They must have come from afar. They are almost certainly bona-fide members of the Solar System. If they came from interstellar space, they would move at greater velocities than are actually found. In 1950 the Dutch astronomer J. H. Oort suggested that comets come from a cloud of bodies moving round the sun at between 30 000 and 50 000 a.u. from the Sun – that is to say, around 1 light-year (a light-year is equal to 63 240 a.u.). He proposed that the total cloud population could be as much as 200 000 million, with a total mass up to 100 times that of the Earth. If one of these primordial ice-rich bodies – never incorporated into a planet – were perturbed for any reason, perhaps by the pull of a passing star, it would start to fall in toward the Sun. It might then swing round the Sun and return to the Oort Cloud; it might be expelled from the Solar System altogether; it might be destroyed by collision with the Sun or a planet, or it might be forced into a short-period orbit. Today the existence of the Oort Cloud is generally accepted (it has also been referred to as the ̈ Opik–Oort cloud, since a much less definite suggestion had been made by the Estonian astronomer E. J. ̈ Opik), but it is now thought that though the long-period comets do come from the Oort Cloud, shorter-period comets – such as those of the Jupiter family – come from the Kuiper Belt, a disk-shaped region beyond Neptune, between about 30 and 100 a.u. from the Sun. Asteroidal-sized bodies have indeed been found in this region of the Solar System, and it is true that the distinction between comets and what are generally termed asteroids is much less clear-cut than was previouslybelieved. Theexistenceofthisbeltwasproposed by G. P. Kuiper, although a much less definite suggestion had been made in 1943 by K. Edgeworth. It may be that the Oort Cloud objects were formed closer to the Sun than the Kuiper Belt objects. Low- mass objects formed near the giant planets would have been ejected by gravitational encounters and sent to great distances, whereas Kuiper Belt objects, formed further out, were not so affected. L IFE I N C OMETS? The ‘panspermia’ theory was due to the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius, whose work was good enough to win him the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1903. Arrhenius believed that life was brought to the Earth by way of a meteorite, but the theory never became popular, because it seemed to raise more problems than it solved. The same sort of theme has been followed up recently by Sir Fred Hoyle and C. Wickramasinghe, who believe that comets can actually deposit harmful bacteria in the Earth’s upper air, thereby causing epidemics. Again there has been little support. 236 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"C OMETS Table 14.12. Periodical Comets, Numbers 1–140.

They are small and friable – usually no more than of centimetre size – and so never reach the Earth’s surface intact. There are many well- defined showers, associated with comets which can often be identified; other meteors are sporadic, not associated with any known comet, and so may appear from any direction at any moment. Meteors can, of course, occur in daylight, as was pointed out by the Roman philosopher Seneca about 20 AD, and may be tracked by radio and radar. Meteors are not associated with meteorites, which come from the asteroid belt. The link with comets was first proposed in 1861 by D. Kirkwood; he believed that meteors were the remnants of comets which have disintegrated – and in some cases this is true enough. In 1862 G. V. Schiaparelli demonstrated the link between the Perseid meteor shower and the periodical comet Swift– Tuttle, and other associations were soon established. Some well-known periodical comets are the parents of meteor showers. Halley’s Comet produces two, the η Aquarids of April and the Orionids of October; Comet P/Giacobini–Zinner can occasionally yield rich displays, as in 1933. Biela’s Comet, which broke up and was last seen in 1852, produced ‘meteor storms’ in 1872 and in 1885; in recent years this shower (the Andromedids) has been almost undetectable, but it has been calculated that it may return around 2120, when the orbit of the stream will be suitably placed. The Lyrids, first recorded in 687, are linked with Thatcher’s Comet of 1862, which has a period of over 400 years. The rich Geminid shower of December has an orbit very like that of asteroid 3100 Phæthon, and it is widely believed that Phæthon may be the parent of the stream, adding credibility to the suggestion that some near-Earth asteroids may be extinct comets. E ARLY T HEORIES Meteors were once regarded as atmospheric phenomena. Aristotle believed them to be due to vapours from Earth created by the warmth of the Sun; when they rose to great altitudes they caught fire, either by friction or because the column of air around them cooled, so squeezing out the hot vapours rather as toothpaste can be squeezed out of a tube. Even Newton believed that meteors were volatile gases which, when mixed with others, ignited to cause ‘Lightning and Thunder and fiery Meteors’. Edmond Halley correctly maintained that they came from space and burned away in the upper air (although, curiously, he seems to have changed his mind later and reverted to the Aristotelian picture). Myths abounded. The Mesopotamians regarded meteors as evil portents, and to the Moslems they represented artillery in a war between devils and angels. In Sparta, around 1200 BC, the priests surveyed the sky on one special night once in eight years; if a meteor were seen, it indicated that the king had sinned and ought to be deposed. In mediæval Brunswick a meteor was a fiery dragon which could cause damage; however, if the observer sheltered and cried out ‘Fiery Dragon, come to me’, the dragon might relent, and even drop down a ham or a side of bacon! N ATURE O F M ETEORS The status of meteors was solved in 1798 by two German students, H. W. Brandes and J. F. Benzenberg, of the University of G ̈ ottingen. Between 11 September and 4 November they observed meteors from sites 15.2 km apart, giving them a useful ‘baseline’, and made 402 measurements; in 22 cases they found that the same meteor had been seen from each site, and its track plotted. This made it possible to determine the height of the meteor by the method of triangulation. The heights at which the meteors disappeared ranged between 15 km and 226 km; the mean burnout altitude was found to be 89 km – now known to be very near the truth. The total number of meteors entering the atmosphere daily has been given as 75 000 000 for meteors of magnitude 5 or brighter. An observer under ideal conditions would expect to see between about 5 and 15 naked-eye meteors per hour (except during a shower, when the number would 240 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"M ETEORS Table 15.1.

Meteors of magnitude − 5 or brighter – that is to say, appreciably more brilliant than Venus – are conventionally termed fireballs. Very occasional fireballs, such as those of 20 November 1758 and 18 August 1783, may far outshine the Moon. The 1758 fireball was seen from England, and a contemporary eye-witness report is worth quoting: ‘This night a surprising large meteor was seen at Newcastle, about 9 o’clock, which passed a little westward of the town, directly north, and illuminated the atmosphere to that degree, for a minute, that, though it was dark before, a pin might have been picked up in the streets. Its velocity was inconceivably great, and it seemed near the size of a man’s head. It had a tail of between two and three yards long, and as it passed, some said that they saw sparks of fire fall from it.’ A meteor may enter the atmosphere at a velocity anywhere between 11 km s − 1 and 72 km s − 1 ; it will be violently heated as it enters the upper atmosphere at an altitude of 150 km above the ground. It is vaporized; atoms from its outer surface are ablated and collide with molecules in the atmosphere, exciting and ionizing them, producing a trail which may extend for many kilometres. There is little deceleration before the meteor is destroyed. What we see is, therefore, not the particle itself, but the effects which it produces in the atmosphere during the final moments of its existence. Particles below about 0.1 mm in diameter are termed micrometeorites, and do not produce luminous effects. Some are cometary, while others must be classed as Zodiacal ‘dust’. Meteors are easy to photograph – the earliest really good picture, of an Andromedid, was taken by L. Weinek, from Prague, as long ago as 27 November 1885 – but meteor spectra are much more difficult, because one never knows just when or where a meteor will appear. Many spectra have been obtained (largely by amateurs) and it seems that meteors are made up of material of the type only to be expected in view of their cometary origin. Radar studies of meteor trails are now of great importance; the first systematic work was carried out in 1945 by J. S. Hey and his team, with the δ Aquarids. However, amateur observations are still very useful indeed. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 241"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"M ETEORS Table 15.2. Selected list of minor annual meteor showers a .

(The effect may be likened to the view from a bridge overlooking a motorway; the parallel lanes of the motorway will seem to converge at a point near the horizon.) The shower is named after the constellation in which the radiant lies. One exception refers to the January meteors, the Quadrantids; they are named after Quadrans Muralis, a constellation added to the sky in Bode’s maps of 1775 but later rejected – its stars are now included in Bo ̈ otes, but the old name has been retained. A list of the principal annual showers is given in Table 15.1. A selected list of minor showers is given in Table 15.2, although the low hourly rate of these showers means that the data are decidedly uncertain. The ZHR, or Zenithal Hourly Rate, is given by the number of naked-eye meteors which would be expected to be seen by an observer under ideal conditions, with the radiant at the zenith. In practice these conditions are never met, so that the observed hourly rate is bound to be rather lower than the theoretical ZHR. M ETEOR S HOWERS On the night of 12–13 November 1833 there was a brilliant meteor shower; the meteors came from the constellation of Leo. It was observed from Yale, in the United States, by Denison Olmsted. H. A. Newton postulated the existence of definite showers; finding that the Leonids had appeared periodically, at intervals of 33 years, so that there should be another major meteor storm in 1866. It duly appeared, although unfortunately Olmsted did not see it (he died in 1859). Subsequently other showers were identified, initially the Perseids in 1834 (by J. Locke and A. Quetel ́ et), the Lyrids in 1835 (by F. Arago), the Quadrantids in 1839 (by Quetel ́ et and E. Herrick), the Orionids in 1839 (by Quetel ́ et, Herrick and J. Benzenberg) and the Andromedids in 1838 (also by Quetel ́ et, Herrick and Benzenberg). Some of the recognized showers are consistent, notably the Perseids, while others, such as the Leonids, are very variable in richness. Some radiants are ill- defined, and while some showers are of brief duration – such as the Quadrantids – others spread over weeks. Material may leave a comet either in front of or behind the nucleus. Dust particles ejected from the nucleus may return to perihelion earlier than the comet itself, or may return later; gradually the material is distributed all around the comet’s orbit, forming a loop. With older showers, such as the Perseids, this has had sufficient time to happen; with younger showers it has not, so that good displays are seen only when the Earth passes through the thickest part of the swarm. We must also consider what is termed the Poynting–Robertson effect. In re- radiating energy received from the Sun, a particle will lose orbital velocity and will spiral inward towards the Sun; therefore old streams are depleted in small particles (although even smaller particles are ejected altogether, by radiation pressure). The Perseid shower of early August is consistent, and any observer who looks up into a dark, clear sky at any time during the first part of the month will be very unlucky not to see a few Perseids. The October Draconids, associated with Comet P/Giacobini–Zinner, are usually sparse, but produced a major storm in 1933, when for a while the ZHR reached an estimated 6000; a weaker but still rich storm occurred in 1946 (this was the first occasion on which meteors were systematically tracked by radar). Nothing comparable from the Draconids has been seen since. It must be remembered that meteor streams are easily perturbed by planets, and no two orbits are exactly alike. The Leonids can produce the most spectacular storms of all; a selected list is given in Table 15.3 (drawn from the researches carried out by John Mason). In 1833 and 1866 it was said that meteors ‘rained down like snowflakes’. No major displays were seen in 1899 and 1933, because the main swarm did not intersect the Earth’s orbit at the critical time, but there was another storm in 1966 – unfortunately not seen from Europe, because it occurred during European daylight, but spectacular from parts of North America, such as Arizona. Comet Tempel-Tuttle returned to perihelion in 1998, and was expected to produce another meteor storm. The predicted date was 17 November, 258 days after the comet had passed through perihelion, but in fact the richest display was seen on 16 November – not a ‘storm’, but certainly THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 243"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"M ETEORS Table 15.3.

It is of course possible that some storms were not recorded. striking. It was calculated that the dust stream left behind by the comet does not have uniform cylindrical structure, but consists of a number of discrete, separate arcs of dust, each released at a different return of the comet. If the Earth passes through a thin filament, the meteor shower is brief but intense. If it passes through a broader filament, the shower is less intense, but lasts longer. If the Earth passes through a gap between filaments, the display is weak. If it passes through a broad filament first, and then through the edge of a narrower filament, there will be two peaks of activity. The great storm of 1833 was caused by a dust trail generated in 1800, 33 years earlier; the 1966 storm was due to dust released from the comet in 1899. The displays of 1998 and 1999 were due to an arc-shaped cloud of dust shed by the comet in 1366. In 1999 there was indeed a meteor storm, peaking at 02 hours GMT on 18 November; if not as splendid as the storms of 1833 and 1866, it was very spectacular, with a peak ZHR of well over 2000. It was of brief duration, but was well seen from cloud-free areas of Europe. From Oban (Scotland) Iain Nicolson found the peakactivitytobefrom0200to0215GNT,andhaddeclined markedly by 0240. Many of the meteors were very bright, with long, sometimes persistent trains. During the shower, there were two telescopic reports of flashes on the surface of the Moon, and it was suggested that these might be due to impacting Leonids, but this seems most improbable; a meteor could not produce a visible lunar flas h – a meteorite-sized object would be needed, and meteorites are not associated with comets or with meteor showers. Meteor Sounds? During the Leonid shower of November 1998, the Croatian astronomer Dejan Vinkovic reported that he had recorded sounds from meteors. These have been reported before, and the deep, thunder-like or hissing noise seems to coincide with the visual appearance of the meteor. This would indicate that the sound-waves could travel at the speed of light, which seems impossible. However, the phenomenon – termed electrophonic sound – can be explained by radio waves, which do travel at the speed of light, interacting with objects at ground level to produce audible noise. Further research into this interesting problem is needed. Danger From Meteors? From ground level, meteors – unlike meteorites – are quite harmless. It was suggested that the expected 1998–9 Leonid shower might affect space-craft, such as the Hubble Telescope, but no damage was reported, and all in all it seems that the danger from meteors is not very great. 244 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"16 M ETEORITES Meteorites reach ground level without being destroyed. They are not simply large meteors; they do not belong to showers, and have no definite association with comets, but seem to come mainly from the asteroid belt. It may well be that there is no difference between a large meteoroid and a small asteroid. The term ‘meteorite’ is used only for a meteoroid which has landed on Earth. Normal meteorites are ancient; their ages are given as 4.6 thousand million years – the same as that of the Earth itself. Ages are measured chiefly by the method of radioactive decay. Meteorites contain radioactive isotopes which decay at a known rate; for instance, the half-life of uranium, U-235, is 704 million years. (Half-life indicates the time taken for half of the original material to decay.) U-235 ends up as lead, Pb-206. Half-life periods for materials found in meteorites are given in Table 16.1.

Thorium and uranium isotopes produce helium as well as lead. It is widely believed that some meteorites come from the Moon (chapter 3) and others, the SNC meteorites, from Mars (chapter 7). It has also been suggested that some meteorites, known as achondrites, come from the asteroid Vesta. However, definite proof is lacking. The earliest reports of meteoritic phenomena are recorded on Egyptian papyrus, around 2000 BC. Early meteorites falls are, naturally, poorly documented, but it seems that a meteorite fell in Crete in 1478 BC, stones near Orchomenos in Boetia in 1200 BC and an iron meteorite on Mount Ida in Crete in 1168 BC. According to Livy, ‘stones’ fell on Alban Hill in 634 BC, and there is evidence that in 416 BC a meteorite fell at Ægospotamos in Greece. A meteorite which fell at Nogara, in Japan, in 861 AD was placed in a Shinto shrine, and the Sacred Stone at Mecca is almost certainly a meteorite. The oldest meteorite which can be positively dated fell at Ensisheim, in Switzerland, on 16 November 1492 and is now on show at Ensisheim Church. In India, it is said that the Emperor Jahangir ordered two sword blades, a dagger and a knife to be made from the Jalandhar meteorite of 10 April 1621. A sword was made form the meteorite which fell in Mongolia in 1670, and in the 19th century part of a South African meteorite was used to make a sword for the Emperor Alexander of Russia. Nowadays there is a flourishing trade in meteorites; for example, in 1999 a chip of the Dar al Gani meteorite, allegedly lunar, was sold at Sothebys in London for £ 9200. It was 1.75 cm in diameter. Well over 10 000 meteorites have been identified (it is estimated that in each year the Earth sweeps up about 78 000 tons of extraterrestrial material). Relatively few have been seen to fall. Among famous falls which have resulted in meteorite discovery are those of the P ̆ ribram fireball (Czech, which was recorded as being of magnitude − 19) on 7 April 1959, the Lost City meteorite (Oklahoma) in 1970, the Barwell meteorite (Leicestershire) on 24 December 1965 and the Sikhote–Alin fall in Siberia on 12 February 1947. Rather surprisingly, there are no authenticated records of any human death due to a meteorite. Reports that a monk was killed at Cremona in 1511, and another monk in Milan in 1650 are unsubstantiated. There have, however, been narrow escapes. In 1954 a woman in Alabama, USA, was disturbed by a meteorite which fell through the roof of her house, and she suffered a minor arm injury. On 21 June 1994 Jos ́ e Martin was driving his car from Madrid to Marbella, in Spain, when a 1.4 kg meteorite crashed THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 245"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"M ETEORITES through his windscreen, ricocheted off the dashboard and injured the driver’s finger, fortunately not seriously. More than 50 fragments were later found within 200 m of the impact. Two boys, Brodie Spaulding and Brian Kinzie, were outdoors on 31 August 1991 in Noblesville, Indiana, when a meteorite landed 3.5 m away from them, making a crater 9 cm wide and 4 cm deep; the boys found a small blackstonewhichwasstillwarm–itprovedtobeanunusual sort of chondrite. On 15 August 1992 a piece of the Mbale meteorite (Uganda) struck a banana tree and then hit the head of a boy, again without real damage, and on 9 October of the same year a 12 kg meteorite landed on the bonnet of an unoccupied car at Peeksville, New York, belonging to Michelle Knapp. On 10 December, again in 1992, a house in Japan, belonging to Masaru and Maiko Matsumoto, was struck by a 6.5 kg meteorite. The only definite fatality seems to have been an Egyptian dog, which was in the wrong place at the wrong time when the Nakhla meteorite fell on 28 June 1911. Meteorites were recognized as extraterrestrial only a few centuries ago. The original suggestion was made by E. F. Chiadni in 1794, but met with considerable scepticism, and as recently as 1807 Thomas Jefferson, President of the United States, was quoted as saying ‘I could more easily believethattwoYankeeprofessorswouldliethanthatstones would fall from heaven’. By then, however, proof had been obtained by the French astronomer J. B. Biot, following his investigation of the meteorite shower at L’Aigle on 26 April 1803. On average, meteorites enter the Earth’s atmosphere at a speed of 15 km s − 1 , although the extreme range is probably between 11 km s − 1 and 70 km s − 1 . During entry the leading edge melts, and the ablation of molten material produces a smooth face. Melt droplets streaming along the sides of the meteorite collect at the opposite face and solidify, producing an oriented meteorite. Quenching of the moltencoatingleadstoadark, glassyfusioncrust. Forstone meteorites this crust is seldom more than 0.1 cm, thick and the contrast in colour with the underlying material, which is whitish grey with specks of iron, makes it easier to establish that the object really is meteoritic. C LASSIFICATION O F M ETEORITES Meteorites are of three main types: irons (siderites), stony- irons (siderolites) and stones (aerolites). Early systems of classification were due to G. Rose (1863), G. Tshcermak (1883) and A. Brezina (1904); these were extended by G. Prior (1920) and by G. J. H. McCall (1973). Stones are more commonly found than irons in the ratio of 96% to 4%, but this is misleading, as irons are much more durable and are more likely to survive. Antarctica is a particulary good area for meteorite collection, and many have been found there, initially by Japanese researchers in 1969. Siderites (irons) are made up largely of metallic iron minerals. Kamacite is essentially metallic iron with up to 7.5% nickel in solid solution; taenite is iron with more than 25% nickel in solid solution. There is also plessite, which is a mixture of taenite and finite-grained kamacite. Siderites are divided into three main groups: hexahedrites, octahedrites and ataxites. Hexahedrites are mainly of kamacite, with between 4 and 6% of nickel. Octahedrites contain between 7 and 12% of nickel. When etched with acid and polished, these types show what are termed Widmanst ̈ atten patterns, composed of parallel bands or plates of kamacite bordered by taenite, and intersecting one another in two, three or four directions. Widmanst ̈ atten patterns are unique to these meteorites. They do not appear in ataxites, which contain more than 16% of nickel. Aerolites (stones) are made up chiefly of silicate miner- als, and are again divided into two groups: chondrites (con- taining chondrules) and achondrites (without chondrules). Chondrules are small spherical particles; they are fragments of minerals, and show radiating structure; their average di- ameter is about 1 mm. They are formed from previously melted minerals which have combined with other mineral matter to form solid rock. Chondrites account for 86% of known specimens, and are believed to be among the old- est rocks in the Solar System, with ages of around 4.5 to 4.6 thousand million years. They contain pyroxenes, which are darkish minerals also common on Earth. A stone which was seen to fall at Monahans, Texas, on 22 March 1998, was found to contain salt crystals, inside which were tiny droplets of water. Ordinary chondrites, much the commonest form, are divided into three groups. Those with 12–21% of metallic iron are known as bronzites (bronzite is usually green or 246 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"M ETEORITES brown; its chemical formula is ( MgFe ) SiO 3 ). Chondrites with 5–10% metallic iron are termed hypersthenes; darker than bronzite (chemical formula (MgFe ) SiO 3 ). With about 2% metallic iron, the principal minerals are bronzite and olivine ( MgFe ) 2 SiO 4 ; olivine is abundant in the mantle of the Earth. Much less common are the enstatites, containing 13–25% of low nickel–iron content metal; the formula for enstatite is Mg 2 Si 2 O 6 , colour brown or yellowish. Of special interest are the carbonaceous chondrites; on average the percentage of material by weight is 2.0 carbon, 1.8metals, 0.2nitrogen, 83.0silicatesand11.0water. There is almost no nickel–iron. Carbonaceous chondrites make up 50% of the asteroids at the inner edge of the main belt, and 95% at the outer edge. Achondrites, accounting for about 7% of known specimens, contain no chondrules. Of special interest are eight meteorites known as the SNC meteorites after the regions in which they were found (Shergotty in India, Nakhla in Egypt and Chassigny in France). They seem to have crystallized only 1.3 thousand million years ago, and their composition and texture indicates that they formed on or in a planet which had a strong gravitational field. They have a concentration of volatile elements, and glassy incursions which were permanently formed in the extreme heat of whichever process ejected them from a parent body. These glassy incursions have trapped gases such as Ar, Kr, Xe and N. It has been suggested that they are of Martian origin, though this is of course highly speculative. Siderolites (stony irons) are made up of a mixture of nickel–iron alloy and non-metallic mineral matter. Pallasites consist of a network of nickel–iron enclosing crystals of olivine; mesosiderites are heterogeneous aggregates of silicate minerals and nickel–iron alloy. There are two other groups, lodranites (iron, pyroxene, olivine) and siderophyres (iron, orthopyroxene), but these are excessively rare. Siderolites account for no more than 1.5% of known falls. C HICXULUB I MPACT One major problem in Earth history concerns the disappearance of the dinosaurs, around 65 000 000 years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period. Not only the dinosaurs vanished; so did many other species of living things, and there was unquestionably a great ‘extinction’, although there have also been others (notably toward the end of the Permian Period). In 1980 Luiz and Walter Alvarez proposed that the K–T extinction, separating the Cretaceous (K) and Tertiary (T) eras, was due to the impact of a huge asteroid, meteoroid or comet, which threw up so much material that the world climate changed abruptly. Near the mediæval town of Gubbio, in Italy, they found limestone deposits laid down at this particular time which showed an abrupt change in fossil specimens, and moreover the centimetre thick layer was unusually rich in iridium, which is characteristic of certain meteorites. Subsequently, it was claimed that the point of impact had been found, near the village of Chicxulub on the Yucat ́ an peninsula in Mexico. The crater is buried under a thick layer of sedimentary rock, and studies of the gravitational and magnetic fields indicate that the hidden crater is round 180 km in diameter; there are three major ring structures round its rim, and the whole multi-ring structure may have a diameter of at least 300 km. The Alvarez theory is now widely accepted, and is certainly plausible, but final proof is lacking, and there remain some sceptics. However, there can be no serious doubt that a massive impactor did strike the Chicxulub area at about the time that the dinosaurs died out.

Apparently the local Eskimos were rather reluctant to let them go. The Willamette meteorite is also in the Hayden Planetarium. (This meteorite was the subject of a lawsuit. It was found in 1902 on property belonging to the Oregon Iron and Steel Company. The discoverer moved it to his own property and exhibited it; the Company sued him for possession, but the Court ruled in favour of the discoverer.)

The Beddgelert meteorit e – a small iron – scored a direct hit on the Prince Llewellyn Hotel, but caused no damage. The 1991 meteorite fell at Glatton, in Cambridgeshire. It was found by A. Pettifor, who heard a loud whining noise and the crash of the stone into a conifer hedge some 20 metres away from him. He found the meteorite, which had made a shallow depression 2 cm deep. The meteorite was warm, not hot, when he picked it up. It has a granular structure, indicating that soon after its formation as part of an asteroid it had been hot, but did not melt, so that the mineral grains grew and interlocked. It is an ordinary chondrite of the low-iron Lodranite group, with 23% by weight of iron, about 5% of which is nickel–iron metal, with 18% of stony materials – mainly pyroxene and olivine, which are common components of terrestrial basaltic lavas. B RILLIANT F IREBALLS The brightest fireball ever seen may have been that of 1 February 1994. It passed over the Western Pacific at 22.38 GMT; the magnitude was about − 25. Presumably this was a rocky object; if moving at 15 km s − 1 ,it would have been abou t 7 m across, weighing 400 tons. A remarkable phenomenon was seen on 9 February, 1913, from the North American continent, from Toronto (Canada) through to Bermuda. C. A. Chant, astronomer at Toronto University, recorded: ‘At about 9.05 in the evening there suddenly appeared in the N.W. sky a fiery red body ... it moved forward on a perfectly horizontal path with a peculiar, majestic, dignified deliberation ... Before the astonishment caused by this first meteor had subsided other bodies were seen coming from the N.W., emerging from precisely the same point as the first one. Onward they moved at the same deliberate pace, in twos, threes or fours, with tails streaming behind ... They all traversed the same path and were headed for the same point in the S.E. sky.’ Because this was St. Cyril’s Day, the objects are remembered as the Cyrillids. The whole display lasted for perhaps 3 minutes. Were the Cyrillids meteoroids, which entered the Earth’s upper air and then returned to space? Unfortunately, we do not have a definite explanation. Nothing similar had ever been seen before, and nothing similar has been seen since. On 10 August 1972 a meteoroid was seen to enter the Earth’s atmosphere and then leave it again. It seems to have approached the Earth from ‘behind’ at a relative velocity of 10 km s − 1 , which increased to 15 km s − 1 as it was accelerated by the Earth’s gravity. The object entered the atmosphere at a slight angle, becoming detectable at a height of 76 km above Utah, and reaching its closest point to the ground at 58 km above Montana. It then began to move outward and became undetectable at just over 100 km above Alberta after a period of visibility of 1 min 41 s; the magnitude was estimated by eye-witnesses to be at least − 15 and the diameter of the object may have been as much as 80 m. After emerging from the Earth’s atmosphere it re-entered solar orbit, admittedly somewhat modified by its encounter, and presumably it is still orbiting the Sun. T HE T UNGUSKA F ALL The most famous fall of recent times was that of 30 June 1908, in the Tunguska region of Siberia. As seen from Kansk, 600 km away, the descending object was said to outshine the Sun, and detonations were heard 1000 km away; reindeer were killed, and pine-trees blown flat over a wide area. The first expedition to the site was led by L. Kulik, but did not arrive before 1927. No fragments were found, and it has been suggested that the impactor was the nucleus of a small comet or even a fragment of Encke’s Comet – which, if icy in nature, would presumably evaporate during the descent and landing. (Inevitably, flying saucer enthusiasts have claimed that it must have been an alien space-ship in trouble!) A second major fall occurred on 12 February 1947, in the Sikhote–Alin area of Siberia. The fall was observed, and many craters located. It is fortunate that both these Siberian falls struck uninhabited territory. If a meteorite of this size had hit a city, the death-roll would have been very high.

The most famous impact crater on Earth is Meteor Crater, in Arizona (it really should be Meteor ite Crater), also known as the Barringer Crater. It is 1186 m in diameter, and 175 m deep and is well preserved; it is a well-known tourist attraction. Its age is of the order of 50 000 years (older than was formerly believed), so that at the time of its fall the area was completely uninhabited. Another well-preserved impact crater is Wolf (or Wolfe) Creek, in Western Australia; it was found by the Aborigines long ago and called by them Kandimalal, but it was only identified as an impact crater in 1947, by aerial survey. Its diameter is be- tween 870 and 950 m; the floor has a diameter of 675 km and lies 25 m below the level of the surrounding sand plain. The Tswaing or ‘Saltpan’ Crater near Pretoria, in South Africa, was identified much more recently; it is partially lake-filled. Dozens of meteorite craters have been listed, but caution is needed. For example, all lists include the Vredefort Ring, again near Pretoria, but geologists who have made long-term studies of it are almost unanimous in classifying it as volcanic. A selected list of terrestrial impact craters is given in Table 16.5. M ICROMETEORITES Very small particles entering from the Earth’s atmosphere from space are termed micrometeorites; if they are below about 1 mm in diameter, they cannot cause luminous effects, but end their journey to the ground in identifiable form. Many thousands of tons of micrometeoritic material reach the Earth’s surface each year. 250 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"M ETEORITES T EKTITES These are glassy objects, found only in a few definite areas (Table 16.6). They are small; the largest, found in 1932 at Muong Nong in Laos, weighs 3.2 kg. They seem to have been heated twice, and are aerodynamically shaped. They were once believed to be meteoritic, and in 1897 R. O. M. Verbeek even suggested that they came from the Moon, but it now seems definite that they are of terrestrial origin, being blasted away from the surface by impact and, subsequently, re-entering the atmosphere.

The Northern and Southern Lights are of the same type, but obviously the northern displays are better known, because the Southern Lights are not well seen from inhabited countries. They are sometimes visible from the southern parts of South America and New Zealand, and occasionally from South Africa, but most of the displays over the ages must have been enjoyed only by penguins. Legends and folklore There are many legends about auroræ. In Scotland, the Lightswerecalledthe‘MerryDancers’, supernaturalbeings dancing in the heavens. In Norse mythology, the auroræ represented reflections from the shields of the Valkyries; in Denmark and Sweden it was said that auroræ came from an active volcano in the far north, put there by the gods to provide humanity with light and warmth. When the Lights flickered, the Greenlanders believed that the dead were trying to signal to their living kith and kin. The Inuit of Hudson’s Bay pictured the sky as a solid dome, pierced by holes which allowed light from beyond to shine through; also, the spirits of the dead could pass through the holes into the heavenly regions. The Faroe Islanders kept their children indoors during brilliant displays, because of the fear that the Lights would swoop down and singe people’s hair off. To some Eskimos, an aurora represented a game of football played by spirits using a walrus head as a ball, but in Siberia the tables were turned; here the walruses were playing, using a human skull as a ball! Old ideas Of course the ancients had no idea of the real nature of auroræ. The Greek philosopher Anaxagoras (c 500–428 BC) believed that they were due to fiery vapour poured down into the clouds from above, while the Roman writer Seneca (5 BC–65 AD) attributed them to currents of hot, boiling air in the highest parts of the sky; because they moved so quickly, the stars could generate enough heat to set them alight. The term ‘aurora’ was coined by the French astronomer P. Gassendi, following the brilliant display of 12 November 1621. Proper scientific accounts had appeared earlier than this. A good description of a display of Aurora Borealis was given by K. Gesner of Z ̈ urich for the aurora of 27 December 1560, and in 1731 J. J. de Mairan wrote an excellent book, Trait ́ e physique et historique de l’aurore bor ́ eale . The first surviving description of the Southern Lights was written by Captain Cook for the display of 20 February 1773. Auroræ and sunspots The connection between auroræ and electrical discharges goes back to a suggestion made by Edmond Halley in 1716; he linked auroral displays with discharges associated with the Earth’s magnetic field. (It must be remembered that Halley saw his first aurora in this year, following the end of the solar Maunder Minimum; between 1715 and 1745 there are no reports of auroræ from Britain.) De Mairan, in his book, saw a relationship between the frequency of sunspots and displays of auroræ, while Anders Celsius (1701–44) and Olof Hiorter (1696–1750) recognized the link between auroræ and disturbances of the magnetic needle, and in 1751 the Danish bishop Erik Pontoppidan came to the conclusion that the aurora was itself an electrical phenomenon. The sunspot – aurora connection was refined in 1870 by E. Loomis of Yale, and in 1872 by the Italian astronomer G. Donati, following a major display on 4–5 February of that year. The foundations of modern theory were really laid down in 1895 by the Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland, who found that auroræ were due to charged particles moving under the influence of the Earth’s magnetic field; he also reproduced ‘miniature auroræ’ by using a spherical electromagnet and a beam of cathode rays. In 1929 S. Chapman and V. Ferraro suggested that the auroræ were due to solar plasma, and it is indeed true that auroræ are produced by electrified particles from space, originating in 252 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"G LOWS A ND A TMOSPHERIC E FFECTS the Sun, colliding with atoms and molecules in the Earth’s upper atmosphere. The streams of solar plasma sent out, particularly from coronal holes, take from 2 to 5 days to reach the Earth. When they meet the boundary of the magnetosphere they are deflected, and many of the particles are forced round the Earth’s globe, following the magnetic field lines; the Earth’s magnetic field is compressed on the day side, while on the night side a magnetic tail is produced, extending out to as much as at least 6000 000 km. It may be said that the Earth’s magnetic field creates a ‘tunnel’ in the plasma stream; the northern and southern sections are separated by a plasma sheet, and the particles in the opposite sides of the tunnel rotate in opposite directions, producing a dynamo effect. Whenthemagnetictailbecomesunstable, duetoanincrease in the solar wind, the charged particles move inward to the centre of the tunnel, where they meet and cause a magnetic short-circuit. This circuit closes when the particles reach the top of the atmosphere, where the tenuous gases are made up of ionized particles and are therefore electrically conducting. The energy of the dynamo is converted into light, and auroræ appear. Auroral ovals The particles from the magnetic tail stream down toward the magnetic poles, but it is wrong to assume that the poles are the best sites from which to observe auroræ; they are not. Auroral activity is more or less permanent at high latitudes round the so-called auroral ovals, which are‘rings’asymmetricallydisplacedaroundthegeometrical poles (at present the north magnetic pole lies in Nares Strait, at latitude 70 ◦ N, longitude 71 ◦ W, between Greenland and Ellesmere Island: the south magnetic pole lies at 79 ◦ S, 109 ◦ E, in Antarctica). Basically, the ovals remain more or less fixed in direction, and are wider on the night side of the Earth than on the day side. They are centred on the magnetic poles, while the Earth rotates around the geographical poles. When there are major disturbances on the Sun, producing energetic solar wind particles, the ovals broaden and expand, bringing auroral displays further north and further south of the main regions. The maximum activity of auroræ is seen along geomagnetic latitude 68 ◦ north or south. Thus from Tromsø in Norway (latitude 69 ◦ N) auroræ are far commoner than they are at the pole itself. On average, auroræ of one kind or another are seen on 240 nights per year in North Alaska, North Canada, Iceland, NorthNorwayandNovayaZemlya; 25nightsperyearalong the Canada/United States border and in Central Scotland; only one night per year in Central France. Obviously, however, this varies according to the state of the solar cycle, and in general auroræ are most common about two years after a sunspot maximum. From Mediterranean countries there are only one or two good displays per century, and close to the equator they are very rare indeed, although on one occasion, in 1909, an aurora was seen from Singapore, latitude 1 ◦ 25 \u0002 N. From South England, there were brilliant displays on 25–6 January 1938, 13 March 1989 and 8–9 November 1991. The 1938 display coloured the entire sky red, while those of 1989 and 1991 were bright enough to cast shadows. On these occasions the Sun was very active – but even so, auroræ cannot be reliably predicted. A fairly bright aurora occurred on 6 April 2000, seen from much of England; from Selsey in Sussex I saw it as very conspicuous and decidedly red. Altitudes The heights of auroræ vary. In general, the sharp lower boundary lies at about 98 km above ground level, and the maximum region of auroral activity at about 110 km; the normal upper boundary is at 300 km, although in extreme cases this may reach up to 700 km or even 1000 km. Extremely low auroræ have been reported now and then, but not with any certainty. Auroræ always lie far above normal clouds, so that when the sky is overcast there is no chance of seeing an auroral display of any kind. Form and brilliance The form and brilliance of displays also varies and a definite scale of brightness has been drawn up, although it is not easy to be really precise. The accepted scale is given in Table 17.1. Auroræ may be seen in many forms. There are glows; arcs, withorwithoutrays; bands, morediffuseandirregular; draperies, or curtains made up of very long rays; individual THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 253"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"G LOWS A ND A TMOSPHERIC E FFECTS Table 17.1. Brilliance classes of auroral displays. 1 Rather faint, about equal in brightness to the Milky Way as seen on a clear night. 2 Brighter display, about ten times brighter than Class 1; about equal to thin cirrus clouds lit by moonlight. 3 Much brighter – about 100 times as bright as Class 1; comparable with cumulus clouds lit by moonlight. 4 Brilliant auroræ, 100 to 2000 times as bright as those of Class 1, sometimes casting shadows and even giving as much light as the full moon. From England, the last Class 4 auroræ were those of 1989 and 1991. rays or streamers; coronæ, or radiating systems of rays converging at the zenith; ‘surfaces’, which are diffuse patches, sometimes pulsating; flaming auroræ, made up of quickly moving sheets of light; and ghost arcs, which may persist long after the main display has ended. There are also ‘flickering auroræ’, whose behaviour has been compared with that of a candle flame in a light breeze. The colours of auroræ were first studied in detail by the Norwegian scientist Lars Vegard (1880–1963). The differences in hue are due to differences in composition of the atoms and molecules struck by the energetic particles which rain down from above, and each atmospheric gas produces its own characteristic colour. Oxygen atoms at the lower border of the auroral zone produce brilliant greens; the higher-altitude oxygen atoms yield the rare but spectacular all-red auroræ, and ionized nitrogen atoms are responsible for blue colours, while complete nitrogen atoms give red or purple edges to the lower borders and rippled edges of the display. Sometimes all these colours can be seen over a few minutes; at other times only one colour is seen. Over Norway, for example, by far the commonest auroræ are green. Auroral noise One interesting and frankly puzzling problem associated with auroræ is that of ‘auroral noise’. There have been many reports of sounds: faint whistles, rustling, swishing, crackling and soft hissing. Many reported were listed by S. Tromholt, from Norway, in 1885 (reported in Nature 32 499). A typical report is that of Dr. H. D. Curtis, who was in charge of the Labrador Station of the Lick Observatory in 1905. He wrote: ‘Auroral displays were frequent and bright during July and August. On several nights I heard faint swishing and crackling sounds, which I could only attribute to the aurora. There were times when large, faintly luminous patches or ‘curtains’ passed rapidly over our camp .... The faint hissing and crackling sounds were much more in evidence as such luminous patches swept past us. I tried in vain to assign the sounds to some reasonable cause other than the aurora, but was forced to exclude them as possible sources. In short, I feel certain that the sounds I heard were caused by the aurora and nothing else. There was, moreover, a certain synchronism between the maxima of these sounds and the sweeping of aurora curtains over the sky.’ It is extremely difficult to see how auroræ could produce sounds. Moreover, the speed of sound in the high atmosphere is such that any noise due to aurora should take minutes to reach ground level, making it hard to reconcile the noise with visual activity; in any cause auroræ are so high up that they are restricted to conditions of near- vacuum, so that there is no real chance of sounds being propagated downward. Electrical phenomena have been proposed; it has also been claimed that the reports are purely psychological, but we do not really know the answer, and so far I believe that no serious attempt has been made to tape-record the noise. Slight odours have also been reported, but with no certainty, and it must be said that smelly auroræ seem only slightly less improbable than noisy auroræ! Daytime auroræ occur, but are naturally difficult to detect because of the brightness of the sky. Moreover, the auroral belt is much narrower by day than by night. To see daytime auroræ from the Earth’s surface, the observer must be within 10 ◦ to 15 ◦ of the magnetic pole, and the Sun must be at least 10 ◦ below the horizon. One favourable site for making these observations is Spitzbergen, but this is not a place which is particularly easy to reach. A vivid description of an aurora was given in 1904 by the great Norwegian polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen, as he 254 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"G LOWS A ND A TMOSPHERIC E FFECTS stood on the deck of his ship, the Fram , drifting over the Arctic pack-ice. He wrote: ‘Thereisthesupernaturalforyou–theNorthernLights flashing in matchless power and beauty over the sky in all the colours of the rainbow. Seldom or never have I seen the colours so brilliant. The prevailing one at first was yellow, but that gradually flickered over to green, and then a sparkling ruby-red began to show at the bottom of the rays on the underside of the arc.

On the other hand, strong auroræ are associated with all four giant planets – Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, although with Uranus and Neptune the magnetic poles are nowhere near the rotational poles, and auroræ will be equatorial rather than polar. T HE A IRGLOW The airglow (dayglow and nightglow) was named by Otto Struve in 1950, who suggested the name in correspondence with C. T. Elvey. Nightglow prevents the sky from being completely dark at any time, quite apart from the diffusion of starlight. There are various reasons for it; chemical reactions of the neutral constituents of the upper atmosphere, with light emissions; reactions from ionized constituents, again producing light emission; the influx of incoming particles from space, and so on. There also seems to be a sort of ‘geo corona’ in the exosphere (1000 to 10 000 km altitude), due to emissions from hydrogen and helium atoms in the highly rarefied region of the atmosphere. Diffused starlight is quite appreciable, coming as it does from the thousand million stars above magnitude 20, of which approximately one million are above magnitude 21.2, 4850 above magnitude 6, and 1620 above magnitude 5. Over a full visible hemisphere of the sky (20 626 square degrees) the total starlight is approximately equal to 52 stars the brilliance of Sirius or 4 planets the brilliance of Venus at maximum. It is, however, only a tiny fraction of the light sent to us by the Moon. T HE G REEN F LASH The Green Flash (or Green Ray) is an atmospheric effect. As the Sun sinks below the horizon, the last segment of it may flash brilliant green for an instant. There are vague references to this in Egyptian and Celtic folklore, but the first scientific account of it was due to W. Swan, who saw it on 13 September 1865. However, Swan’s account was not published until 1883. The first published reference to the phenomenon was due to J. P. Joule, in 1869. Much more recently, superb photographs of it have been taken by D. J. O’Connell at the Vatican Observatory; these were published in book form in 1958. The Green Flash has even been seen with Venus; the first reference to it seems to be due to Admiral Murray, who saw it from HMS Cornwall , off Colombo, on 28 November 1939. Venus was setting over a sea horizon; Admiral Murray was using binoculars, and described the flash as ‘emerald’. A green flash with Jupiter was seen by G. Verschuur on 8 June 1978. T HE Z ODIACAL L IGHT The Zodiacal Light may be seen as a faint cone of light ris- ing from the horizon either after sunset or before sunrise. It extends away from the Sun, and is generally observable for only a fairly short period after the Sun has set or before it rises. On a clear, moonless night, under ideal conditions, it contributes about one-third of the total sky light, and may be brighter than the average Milky Way region. It is due to par- ticles scattered in the Solar System along and near the main plane of the system; cometary d ́ ebris is a major contributory factor. The diameters of the particles are of the order of 0.1 to 0 . 2 μ m (one μ m is equal to one-millionth of a metre). Since the Zodiacal Light extends along the ecliptic, it is best seen when the ecliptic is nearly vertical to the horizon – i.e. February to March and again in September to October. The first scientific account of the Zodiacal Light was given by G. D. Cassini in 1683; he correctly suggested that it was due to sunlight reflected from tiny particles orbiting the Sun near the plane of the ecliptic. However, it had been observed much earlier by the Persians and the Arabs, and had been clearly described by Joshua Childrey in the Britannia Baconica published in London in 1661.

It is extremely elusive, and is generally visible only under near-perfect conditions. (From England I have seen it only once, in March 1942, when the whole country was blacked out as a precaution against German air-raids.) The best opportunities occur when the anti- Sun position is well away from the Milky Way (i.e. in February to April and September to November) and when the anti-Sun position is high, at local midnight. Generally it is oval in shape, measuring 10 ◦ by 22 ◦ , so that its maximum diameter is roughly 40 times that of the full Moon. The discovery of the Gegenschein seems to have been due to Esprit P ́ en ́ ezas, who reported it to the Paris Academy in 1731. It was named by Humboldt, who saw it on 16 March 1803. It was described in more detail by the Danish astronomer Theodor Brorsen, who saw it in 1854 and wrote about it in 1863. Contrary to statements made in many books. Brorsen did not claim the discovery for himself, as he was familiar with Humboldt’s description. T HE Z ODIACAL B AND The Zodiacal Band is a very faint, parallel-sided band of radiance, which may extend to either side of the Gegenschein, or be prolonged from the apex of the Zodiacal Light cone to join the Zodiacal Light with the Gegenschein. It may be from 5 ◦ to 10 ◦ wide and is extremely faint. Like the Zodiacal Light and the Gegenschein, it is due to sunlight being reflected from interplanetary particles near the main plane of the Solar System. 256 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"18 T HE S TARS Look at the sky on a dark, clear night and it may seem that millions of stars are visible. This is not so. Only about 5780 stars are visible with the naked eye, and this means that it is seldom possible to see more than 2500 naked-eye stars at any one time, but much depends upon the visual acuity of the observer. People with average sight can see stars down to magnitude 6, but very keen-eyed observers can reach at least 6.5. On the magnitude scale, a star of magnitude 1 is exactly 100 times as bright as a star of magnitude 6. The proper names of stars are usually Arabic, although a few (such as Sirius) are Greek. In general, proper names are used only for the stars conventionally classed as being of the first magnitude (down to Regulus in Leo, magnitude 1.36), plus a few special stars, such as Mizar in Ursa Major and Mira in Cetus. The system of using Greek letters was introduced by J. Bayer in 1603; also in wide use are the numbers given in Flamsteed’s catalogue. D ISTANCES O F T HE S TARS It had long been known that the stars are suns, and are very remote, but early efforts to measure their distances ended in failure. William Herschel tried the method of parallax; he reasoned – quite correctly – that if a relatively nearby star is observed at an interval of six months, it will seem to shift slightly against the background of more remote stars, be- cause in the interim the Earth will have moved from one side of its orbit to the other. At that time it was believed that dou- ble stars resulted from line of sight effects, so that the nearer component would show a parallax shift against its compan- ion. Herschel’s measurements were not sufficiently precise to show parallaxes, but in 1801 he did show that many dou- bles, such as Castor in Gemini, are binary systems, with the components moving around their common centre of gravity. In 1838 F. W. Bessel, from K ̈ onigsberg, successfully measured the parallax of the star 61 Cygni, finding it to be about 11 light-years away. From the Cape, T. Henderson measured the parallax of the brilliant star α Centauri, although his results were not announced until after those of Bessel; and about the same time F. G. W. Struve, from Dorpat, made a rather less accurate measurement of the parallax of Vega. The nearest stars within 13 light-years of the Sun are listed in Table 18.1. Most are very faint dwarfs; only α Centauri, Sirius, \u001e Eridani, \u001e Indi, τ Ceti and Procyon are visible with the naked eye, and only α Centauri, Sirius and Procyon are more luminous than the Sun. The nearest star beyond the Sun is Proxima, a member of the α Centauri system. (In 1976 O. J. Eggen reported the discovery of a red star, magnitude 10.8, in the constellation of Sculptor near τ Sculptoris which was regarded as being very close, but later work showed that it was well beyond the 13 light-year limit of the table.) It is most unlikely that any stars exist closer to the Sun than Proxima. All parallax shifts are very small. A star showing a parallax of 1 arcsec would lie at a distance of 3.26 light- years, but even Proxima is well beyond this limit. Absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude that a star would have if seen from a standard distance of 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years). From this range only α Centauri, Sirius, Procyon and τ Ceti would be naked- eye objects. It is interesting to note that if our Sun could be observed from Sirius, it would be a second-magnitude star at right ascension 18h44m, declination − 16 ◦ 4 \u0002 . Most of the stars in Table 18.1 are red dwarfs; the companions of Sirius and Procyon are white dwarfs. There are four flare stars; UV Ceti B (Luyten L 726-8B), Proxima, Kr ̈ uger 60B and Ross 154. Lalande 21185 and Groombridge 34A are excessively close binaries (too close to be separated visually) and there is a third body, of low mass, in the 61 Cygni system. There are strong suspicions that \u001e Eridani is accompanied by a body of planetary mass.

The star with the greatest proper motion is Barnard’s Star, discovered in June 1916 by E. E. Barnard at the Yerkes Observatory. The annual proper motion is over 10 arcsec, so that in 170 years it crosses the sky by a distance equal to the diameter of the full moon. Radial velocities (the towards or away movements of the stars, relative to the Sun) are given as negative for a velocity of approach, positive for a velocity of recession. Barnard’s Star is approaching us at 111 km s − 1 , so that its distance is decreasing at the rate of 0.036 light-years per century. The proper motion is increasing by about 0.0013 arcsec per year, and will reach 25 arcsec by 11 800 AD, when the star will be at its closest to us – 3.85 light-years, which is nearer than Proxima; the parallax will then be 0 \u0002\u0002 . 87 and the apparent magnitude will have risen to 8.5. Subsequently, the star will begin to recede. Over sufficient periods of time, of course, the skies will alter. For example, Arcturus must first have become visible with the naked eye half a million years ago, and has brightened steadily; it is now about at its nearest and will subsequently recede, dropping below naked-eye visibility half a million years from now. 258 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"S TARS O F T HE F IRST M AGNITUDE Table 18.1.

Inevitably there are stars whose proper motions will carry them from one constellation into another constellation.

Data are according mainly to J. Tomkin; modern distances from the Cambridge catalogue. Some variable stars can reach the first magnitude, although in general they remain fainter; at one time in the 19th century the unique η Carinæ outshone every star in the sky apart from Sirius. Mira Ceti reached 1.2 at the maximum of 1772, according to the Swedish astronomer Per Wargentin, although most maxima are below 2; the official maximum magnitude is usually given as 1.7. γ Cassiopeiæ is an irregular variable; in 1936 it reached magnitude 1.6, but at present (2000) and for some years past it has been around 2.2. Different catalogues give different values; the data given in this book are from the Cambridge catalogue (Sky Catalogue 2000), which is as authoritative as any. Some stars have been suspected of permanent or secular variation. Thus Ptolemy ranked both β Leonis and θ Eridani as being of the first magnitude, although in the latter case there may well have been an error in identification. Ptolemy ranked Castor and Pollux as equal, although Pollux is now much the brighter of the two. Stars which are now decidedly brighter than as listed by Ptolemy Table 18.3.

Some known stars are millions of times more luminous than the Sun, while others are remarkably feeble. At its peak, in the 1840s, the erratic variable η Carinæ was estimated to be 6000 000 times as powerful as the Sun; S Dorad ˆ us, in the Large Magellanic Cloud, has an absolute magnitude of − 8 . 9, so that it is at least a million times as luminous as the Sun – yet because of its great distance (170 000 light-years) it cannot be seen with the naked eye. At the other end of the scale is MH18, discovered in 1990 by M. Hawkins at what was then the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, from plates taken with the UKS telescope in Australia. It has 1 / 20 000 the luminosity of the Sun, and is presumably a brown dwarf (see below). Its mass is 5% that of the Sun, and its distance is 68 light- years. The first attempt to classify the stars according to their spectra was made by the Italian Jesuit astronomer, Angelo Secchi, in 1863–7. He divided the stars into four main types: (1) White or bluish stars, with broad, dark lines of hydrogen but obscure metallic 1 lines. Example: Sirius. (2) Yellow stars; hydrogen lines less prominent, metallic lines more so. Examples: Capella, the Sun. (3) Orange stars; complicated, banded spectra. Examples: Betelgeux, Mira. Theclassincludedmanylong-period variables. (4) Red stars, with prominent carbon lines; all below magnitude 5. Example: R Cygni. This class also included many variables. Secchi’s work was followed up enthusiastically by the English amateur W. Huggins, but the modern system of classification was developed in America, at the Harvard College Observatory. It was introduced by E. C. Pickering in 1890, and was extended by two 1 Conventionally but confusingly, all elements except hydrogen and helium are classed as ‘metals’ from the spectroscopist’s point of view. famous women astronomers, Annie Jump Cannon and Wilhelmina Fleming, who produced the Draper Catalogue – so named because money for its development was provided by the widow of Henry Draper, who in 1872 had been the first to photograph the spectrum of a star (Vega). Secchi’s catalogue had contained over 500 stars; the Draper Catalogue contained spectra of 225 000 stars down to the ninth magnitude. The spectral types were allotted letters in order of decreasing temperature, A, B, C ..., but before long it became clear that some of the original types were unnecessary, and others out of order. The final sequence was alphabetically chaotic: O, B, A, F, G, K, M, R, N, S. A famous mnemonic runs ‘O Be a Fine Girl Kiss Me Right Now Sweetie’ (or, if you prefer it, Smack) 2 . The original scheme depended mainly on surface temperature. Conventionally, the first in the sequence were called ‘early’ types and the K, M and other red stars as ‘late’, but this is now known to have nothing to do with evolutionary sequences. In the Hertzsprung–Russell or HR diagram, drawn up intheearlypartofthetwentiethcenturybyE.J.Hertzsprung in Denmark and H. N. Russell in America, stars are plotted according to their luminosities and their spectral types. Most of the stars lie on a line extending from the upper left of the diagram to the lower right; this is termed the Main Sequence. Main Sequence stars (such as the Sun) are officially regarded as dwarfs. Characteristics of the main spectra types are given in Table 19.1. Stars of very ‘early’ type (W and O) and very ‘late’ type (R, N and S) are relatively rare. Types R and N are now often combined as type C. In 1998 astronomers in the United States added a new spectral type, L, to accommodate very cool dwarfs of low mass, no more than 1 / 20 that of the Sun. These L dwarfs 2 Naturally, this mnemonic has been met with howls of anguish from the Politically Correct fanatics, I wonder how long it will be before these curious people begin agitating about red giants, brown dwarfs and, above all, black holes? 262 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"S TELLAR S PECTRA A ND E VOLUTION Table 19.1.

The original Harvard scheme has been modified into what is known as the Yerkes or MKK classification, based on the work of W. W. Morgan, P. V. Keenan and E. Kellman. It takes into account the fact that the gravitational acceleration on the surface of a giant star is much lower than for a dwarf, so that the gas pressures and densities are much lower in giants than in dwarfs. There are six luminosity classes (Table 19.2), so that the Sun would be specified as a G2V star.

White dwarfs, to the lower left, were unrecognized in 1913, when the HR diagram was drawn up in its present form. At that time the source of stellar energy was generally assumed to be gravitational, so that the star would begin at the top right of the HR diagram, cross to the Main Sequence at the top left, and then pass down the Main Sequence as it cooled. This would mean that red giants and supergiants would be very young. In fact this is not true; they are very advanced in their evolution. Neither can gravitational contraction account for the radiation of a normal star. A star such as the Sun is several thousands of millions of years old, and simple gravitational contraction could not sustain it for anything like this period. Russell himself proposed that the energy source could be due to the annihilation of matter, so that certain types of particles were wiping each other out and releasing energy in the process. However, this would lead to a life-cycle of millions of millions of years, which was as obviously too long as previous estimates had been too short. The key to the problem was found in 1939 by H. Bethe and, at about the same time, by G. Gamow. (Bethe actually worked it out during a train journey from Washington to Cornell University!) Normal stars shine by means of nuclear reactions. Thus, deep inside the Sun, hydrogen is being converted into helium. It takes four hydrogen nuclei to make one helium nucleus, and each time this happens a little mass is lost and a little energy is released. Each second, the Sun converts 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium – and loses 4 million tons in mass. This may sound a great deal, but the Sun is very massive, and has a great deal of hydrogen ‘fuel’, which lasts for a long time. The age of the Earth is 4.6 thousand million years; the Sun is certainly older than that, but even so it is no more than half-way through its main career. What are termed ‘stellar populations’ were first described by W. Baade in the early 1950s. Population I stars are metal-rich, with about 2% of their mass being made up to elements heavier than helium. The most brilliant PopulationIstarsareoftypesW,OandB.Thediskandarms of the Galaxy (and other spirals) are mainly Population I. Population II stars are metal-poor, and are clearly older, so that their most brilliant members are red giants and supergiants which have already left the Main Sequence. They are dominant in the halo and nucleus of the Galaxy (and other galaxies) and in globular clusters. However, there is no hard and fast boundary between Population I and Population II regions. There are numerous cases in which many stars of similar type, and presumably of similar age, are concentrated in a limited area. These are known as stellar associations . THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 265"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"S TELLAR S PECTRA A ND E VOLUTION S tar b irth A star begins its career by condensing out of the gas and dust in the interstellar medium – that is to say, the gas and dust lying between existing stars. Vast amounts of material are concentrated in what are termed giant molecular clouds (GMCs); for example, a GMC covers almost the whole of the constellation of Orion, and the famous nebula M.42 is only a small feature of it. Nebulæ are, in fact, stellar birthplaces. Star formation in a given area may well be triggered off by a nearby supernova explosion – the death of a very massive star, which literally blows itself to pieces, or the destruction of the white dwarf component of a binary pair. After the outburst, a shell of gas passes through the interstellar medium; if it encounters a GMC, then the GMC is compressed, and this stimulates star birth. In nebulæ we can observe small dark ‘globules’, known as Bok globules in honour of the Dutch astronomer Bart Bok, who first drew attention to them in the 1940s. A typical Bok globule measures 1 to 2 light-years across, through some are larger; they are intensely cold – less than 15 ◦ above absolute zero. The denser regions inside them contract gravitationally and heat up, so that eventually they form masses of material known as protostars; these draw in further material by the process of accretion. Thesubsequentcareeroftheprotostardependsentirely upon its initial mass, so let us consider the different categories. 1. Stars with mass below 0.08 that of the Sun ,or 80 times that of Jupiter. The core temperature never becomes high enough to trigger off nuclear reactions such as the conversion of hydrogen into helium; for this, the temperature must rise to around 10 000 000 ◦ C. Very low- mass stars which cannot achieve this are known as brown dwarfs, a term coined in 1975 by Jill Tarter; in fact it is rather misleading, since visually a brown dwarf would look dull red. The pressure due to emitted radiation counteracts gravitation in a young star of this kind, so that the size remains more or less constant for several thousands of millions of years; initially the dwarf shines feebly, although because no nuclear reactions are going on it gradually cools down and eventually ceases to shine at all. It becomes a black dwarf (though whether the universe in its current form is old enough for this to have happened is still problematical). It has been said that a brown dwarf is a cross between a star and a planet, but this analogy must not be taken too far; a planet is formed by accretion from the material surrounding a young star, and its internal structure is different. Moreover a planet has no light of its own, and depends upon reflecting the light of a nearby star, whereas a young brown dwarf may have an absolute magnitude of around + 17 and a surface temperature of the order of 2000 ◦ C. The luminosity may then be around 1 / 10 000 that of the Sun. Because they shine so feebly (if at all), brown dwarfs are not easy to identify, and for many years searches for them proved to be fruitless. Then, in 1995, a brown dwarf was detected in the Pleiades star-cluster; it was catalogued as PPl 15. The Pleiades cluster is only about 125 000 000 years old, so that PPl 15 was young; the surface temperature was about 2000 ◦ C. Spectroscopic examination revealed the presence of the element lithium. Newly-born stars contain small amounts of lithium (about 1 atom per thousand million), but an increased temperature will destroy the lithium in about 100 million years – so that a cool object containing lithium must be a brown dwarf. Other brown dwarfs in the Pleiades, such as Teide 1, were also reported. However, even stronger evidence comes from the star Gleise 229, a red dwarf in the constellation of Lepus; it is 19 light-years away. It has a companion, Gleise 229B, found on 27 October 1993 with the 60 inch (152 cm) and 200 inch (5 m) telescopes at Palomar, and quickly confirmed by the Hubble Space Telescope. The distance between Gleise A and B is around 40 a.u. (much the same as the distance of Pluto from our Sun), and the mass seems to be between 20 and 50 times that of Jupiter, putting it firmly in the brown dwarf category. The surface temperature is around 700 ◦ C; since it is between one and five thousand million years old, it has had plenty of time to cool down. In 1997 a spectrum taken with UKIRT, the United Kingdom Infra-Red Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, revealed the presence of methane and water vapour. Methane is destroyed at a temperature of 2500 ◦ C, and so Gleise 229B cannot be as hot as this; it can only be a brown dwarf. No doubt brown dwarfs are very common. We have even found one brown dwarf binary pair, again in the Pleiades cluster; the separation between the two 266 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"S TELLAR S PECTRA A ND E VOLUTION components is only 0.03 a.u., and the revolution period is seven days. An isolated brown dwarf of special interest was detected in 1997 by Maria Teresa Ruiz, using the 3.6 m telescopeattheLaSillaObservatoryinChile. Itwastracked down because of its unusually large proper motion. It seems to be 33 light-years away, and is of magnitude 22. The surface temperature is of the order of 1700 ◦ C, and the mass is 75 times that of Jupiter, which is equivalent to 6% of the mass of the Sun; its spectrum shows unmistakable traces of lithium. It is three million times fainter than the dimmest object which can be seen with the naked eye; Ruiz named it Kelu-1, since that word means ‘red’ in the language of the Mapuche people, the ancient inhabitants of that part of Chile. The coolest known methane brown dwarf, NNTDF J1205-0744, was detected in 1999 in Virgo, following a deep-field exposure with the Hubble Space Telescope. Its temperature is around 700 ◦ C, suggesting an age of 500 to 1000 million years, and a mass 20 to 50 times that of Jupiter. It is 300 light-years away. Lacking a stable energy source at its core, it is becoming fainter and cooler, and will continue to do so for thousands of millions of years. The coolest brown dwarf of any kind is Gliese 570D, identified in 2000 by A. Burgasser and D. Kirkpatrick with the Two Micron All Sky Survey at infra-red wavelengths. A spectrum taken with the Cerro Tololo reflector (aperture 4 metres) shows lithium, which cannot survive in hotter stars. The temperature of Gliese 570D is about 750 K (480 ◦ C). The dwarf orbits the triple star system of Gliese 570 at a distance of 1500 astronomical units, in a period of around 40 000 years. It is about the same size as Jupiter, but 50 times more massive. The distance from Earth is 19 light-years; the system lies in the constellation of Libra. It has been said that a brown dwarf is a star which has failed its entrance examination, and this certainly seems appropriate! 2. Low-mass stars ; too massive to remain as brown dwarfs, but below 1.4 solar masses. The process of increasing mass in the central region of a dense cloud (accretion) continues, and eventually a protostar develops; nuclear processes have not begun, but the protostar glows because of the heat generated by the compression of the gas. If the dense core is rotating it collapses into a disk, which may then condense into several stars; if the core is not rotating rapidly, it will form a single star (such as the Sun). At first the protostar will be large and red, although by no means the same as red giants such as Arcturus or Aldebaran. As the contraction goes on, the surface temperature remains the same, so that the luminosity decreases. On the HR diagram, the star passes along what are known as the Hayashi and Henyey tracks (named after the astronomers who first described them) and finally joins theMainSequence. TTauristarsarestillcontractingtoward the Main Sequence, and are irregularly variable; they are also sources of strong ‘stellar winds’, which blow away the original surrounding cocoon of dust. The removal of the cocoon makes the star brighten, and there is strong emission of infra-red radiation. When the cocoon of gas and dust is finally blown away, and mass accretion stops, the protostar joins the Main Sequence at a point known as the ZAMS (Zero Age Main Sequence). Just where it joins depends upon its mass, and this also regulates the subsequent course of events. Once nuclear reactions begin – the conversion of hydrogen into helium – the star settles down to a period of stability; a star with a mass similar to that of the Sun will spend about 10 000 million years on the Main Sequence, so that the Sun is now about half-way through this stage in its evolution. At first it was only about 70% as luminous as it is now, but as the hydrogen-into-helium process continued the core temperature rose to its present value of about 15 000 000 ◦ C. The conversion process – known, rather misleadingly, as hydrogen burning – is accomplished by a rather roundabout process known as the proton–proton reaction. With hotter stars, what is termed the carbon–nitrogen cycle is dominant, so that these two elements are used as catalysts; however, the end result is much the same – hydrogen is converted into helium, with release of energy and loss of mass. Gas radiation pressure (tending to make the star expand) and gravitation (tending to make it contract) balance each other out. In fact, the star adjusts its size to make this happen, so that the star remains stable. This stage of evolution lasts for a long time, but not for ever. Helium is built up in the core, and eventually the supply of available hydrogen runs low. This means that THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 267"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"S TELLAR S PECTRA A ND E VOLUTION less energy is generated, and finally the core can no longer support the weight of the star’s outer layers pressing down on it from all directions. The inner temperature rises, with hydrogen burning continuing round the now helium-rich core. As the central temperature continues to rise, the outer layers expand and cool, so that the star becomes a red giant – as Arcturus and Aldebaran are now. It is then said to be on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) of the HR diagram. The luminosity has increased a hundredfold, and the bloated globe is now so large that in the case of the Sun it will engulf the inner planets. Certainly the Earth cannot hope to survive as a habitable world. When the core temperature reaches 100 000 000 ◦ C, helium suddenly reacts to form carbon and oxygen. This is known as the ‘helium flash’, and is very sudden indeed; subsequently the energy output declines, and so the outer layers again contract. The star is left smaller, hotter and dimmer, and cannot return to the Main Sequence. Very often the star becomes variable; stars of about the same mass as the Sun become what are termed W Virginis variables, while higher-mass stars become Cepheid variables. The variations are due to the fact that the stars are pulsating, changing both in luminosity and in radiation output. Following this period of instability, the outer layers of the star are puffed off; subsequently the expelled material becomes visible, excited by radiation from the star, to produce what is called a planetary nebul a – a misleading term, because a planetary nebula has nothing whatsoever to do with a planet. This may dispose of 20% of the star’s mass. The expelled material will not fall back, but will expand and dissipate in space; planetary nebulæ, as such, are therefore relatively short-lived, and are unlikely to last for as long as 100 000 years. Some are symmetrical, while others are irregular in form. Undeniably they are beautiful objects. What, then, ofthecore, inwhichnuclearreactionshave ceased? The temperature is not high enough to make carbon and oxygen react, and what remains of the old star (that is to say, the burnt-out core) settles into a very small, super- dense object known as a white dwarf. The dim companion of Sirius is of this type, and was in fact the first white dwarf to be recognized as such. Its escape velocity is 3400 km s − 1 , and its surface gravity is 900 times that of the Sun. In a white dwarf, the atoms are broken up, and their component parts are packed tightly together with little waste of space. This leads to amazing density values, so that a teaspoonful of white dwarf material would weigh several tons. They are of two main types, DA (with hydrogen-rich atmospheres) and DB (with more complex spectra). They are very small; we know white dwarfs which are smaller than the Moon but are as massive as the Sun. They have been described as ‘bankrupt stars’, although in some cases their surface temperatures are still high, and may exceed 100 000 ◦ C. White dwarf material is officially termed ‘degenerate’. The star cannot contract further, and it will simply cool down until it turns into a cold, dead glob e – a black dwarf, sending out no energy at all. It is significant that no white dwarfs are known with surface temperatures much below 3000 ◦ C, so that evidently the Galaxy is not yet old enough for even the most ancient white dwarfs to have cooled down below this temperature. One very hot white dwarf, RE 1738 + 665, was discovered in 1994 by M. Barstow of Leicester University, from data supplied by the ROSAT artificial satellite. The surface temperature is of the order of 90 000 ◦ C, and the atmosphere is pure hydrogen. The star seems to form a link between the cooler, hydrogen-rich white dwarfs and the very hot hydrogen-rich stars at the centres of planetary nebulæ. The Indian astronomer S. Chandrasekhar has shown that if a star is more than 1.4 times as massive as the Sun, it cannot become a white dwarf unless it sheds some of its mass during its evolutionary career – which happens, of course, during the unstable and the planetary nebula stages. If the mass remains above the Chandrasekhar limit, the star will meet with a very different fate; it will not subside quietly as a white dwarf, but will implode to become a neutron star via a supernova explosion. 3. Stars more than 1.4 times as massive as the Sun . Here, everything happens at an accelerated rate; for example, if the proto-star is 1.5 times as massive as the Sun it may reach the Main Sequence in a few thousand years, and will remain on the Main Sequence for a mere 10 million years before it has exhausted all its available hydrogen ‘fuel’. The core heats up to 100 million degrees, and helium is 268 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"S TELLAR S PECTRA A ND E VOLUTION converted to carbon, although the helium ‘burns’ steadily after the helium flash. By the time that helium burning has come to an end, the outer layers of the star have extended further still, and the star has become much brighter than a low-mass red giant such as Arcturus; it has turned into a supergiant, as Betelgeux in Orion is now. The absolute magnitude of a supergiant may attain − 10, of the order of a million times the luminosity of the Sun (in the case of Betelgeux, the absolute magnitude is between − 5 and − 6). Massive though they are, supergiants are very rarefied, with average densities of less than one-millionth that of the Sun. Many are variable; these include the Cepheid variables, to be discussed below. Asthecoretemperaturecontinuestorise, carbonreacts in its turn; next, oxygen and silicon are produced, and then iron. This is where the whole situation changes. Iron will not react, and so energy production stops. Disaster follows. The process is out of control; in a matter of seconds the core collapses, and the electrons and protons are fused into neutrons. There is an ‘implosion’, followed by an explosion; shock waves race through the star, and literally blow it to pieces in what is termed a type II supernova outburst. At its peak the luminosity may be 1000 million times that of the Sun. Heavy elements, produced in the supernova, are hurled away into space, later to form new stars; the remnant of the supernova remains as a neutron star, although it will eventually end up as a cold, dead globe. A rough timetable for a star 25 times as massive as the Sun is given in Table 19.5. Table 19.5. Evolution stages for a star 25 times as massive as the sun.

The concept of neutron stars was first proposed in 1932 by the Russian physicist L. Landau, and again in 1934 by F. Zwicky and W. Baade at Caltech (USA), but the first neutron star was not detected until 1967 – not by its visible light, but by its radio emissions. A neutron star is indeed an amazing object. The diameter is of the order of 20 km or even less, and the star cannot contract further, because of neutron degeneracy. The density is perhaps a thousand million million tons per cubic metre, or 1000 million million times that of water. A teaspoonful of neutron star material would weigh a thousand million tons, and a pin’s head of the material would balance the weight of an ocean liner. According to current theory, the surface layer of a neutron star is crystalline, and around 100 metres deep; it is iron-rich, and composed of what we may call ‘normal’ matter. There are mountains on the surface – but these can be no more than around a centimetre high, and the ‘atmosphere’ above can extend for no more than a few centimetres. Cracks occur in the surface, producing ‘starquakes’ which affect the rotation period. Below the crust comes the neutron-rich liquid mantle; below again, a superfluid core composed mainly of neutrons, and at the centre material made up of ‘hyperons’, about which we can only speculate. Stand on a neutron star, and you will weigh 10 000 million times as much as you do on Earth. As the original star collapsed the magnetic field was concentrated, and became very strong, reaching perhaps a hundred million tesla, as against 30 millionths of a tesla for Earth. A neutron star with an even stronger magnetic field is termed a magnetar; the field may be 5000 million times stronger than that of the Earth. The field is assumed to cause ‘starquakes’ in the solid crust, releasing energy in the form of gamma-rays, X-rays, and sub-atomic particles travelling at nearly the speed of light. The first confirmation as obtained in 1998, when astronomers using the VLA (Very Large Array) in New Mexico identified a short-lived ‘afterglow’ of particles emitted by a magnetar. The object, SGR 1900 + 14, was 15 000 light-years away, and in August 1998 had emitted a powerful burst of X-rays and gamma- rays, which is why attention had been drawn to it. A typical neutron star has a mass around 1.5 times that of the Sun. When first created it is very hot, but has a tiny surface area and appears very faint; as it ages, it naturally cools down. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 269"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"S TELLAR S PECTRA A ND E VOLUTION Pulsars . The first pulsar was discovered in 1967 by Jocelyn Bell (now Jocelyn Bell Burnell) from Cambridge. She was using a special ‘radio telescope’, designed by A. Hewish, which was not a ‘dish’, but looked remarkably like a collection of barbers’ poles; the aim was to study the scintillation of distant radio sources. Stars twinkle, or scintillate, because of effects in the Earth’s atmosphere; radio sources do so because they are affected by the clouds of electrons in the solar wind. During her surveys, Jocelyn Bell came across a discrete radio source which ‘pulsed’ quickly, almost as though ticking. It was catalogued as CP 1919. Bell found the period to be 1.337 3011 s, which means that there are around 60 000 pulses per day; the period was absolutely regular, and the object was so extraordinary that Bell’s colleagues were initially sceptical. However, following the initial announcement, made on 29 February 1965, other pulsars were soon found, and by now many hundreds are known. It was some time before astronomers found out just what they were. There was even the short-lived LGM or Little Green Men theory – that the signals were artificial. Rotating white dwarfs were next suggested, but it became clear that a pulsar had to be even smaller than a white dwarf. It could be nothing other than a rotating neutron star. A pulsar is spinning rapidly, and beams of radio radiation are sent out from its magnetic poles, which do not coincide with the poles of rotation. This leads to the ‘lighthouse’ effect. Each time the Earth passes through a beam, we receive a pulse of radiation. The ‘normal’ pulsar with the longest known period (4.3 s) is PSR 1845 − 19. The present holder of the short-period record (0.016 s) was identified in 1999 in the supernova remnant N157B, in the Large Cloud of Magellan, 170 000 light-years away; its age is around 5000 years. Next comes NP 0532, in the Crab Nebula, with a period of 0.339 s, so that it pulses 30 times in each second. The Crab Nebula, in Taurus, is known to be the remnant of a supernova seen in the year 1054 (although since it is 6000 light-years away, the actual outburst took place in prehistoric times). It contains the first pulsar to be seen visually. This was achieved in January 1969 by a team at the Steward Observatory in Arizona, using a 36 inch reflector. They identified a faint, flashing object whose mean magnitude was about 17, and whose period was the same as that of the pulsar. Soon afterwards it was photographed from the Kitt Peak Observatory, also in Arizona. (Interestingly, R. Minkowski and W. Baade had observed it as far back as 1942, and had even suspected that it was the centre of activity in the Crab, but, not surprisingly, had failed to interpret it.) The second visual identification was that of the pulsar 0833 − 45 in the southern constellation of Vela; the pulsar lies in the Gum Nebula (named after its discoverer, C. S. Gum) which is unquestionably a supernova remnant. The pulsar itself was found in 1968 from the Molongo Radio Astronomy Observatory in Australia, and in 1977 a team working with the 3.9 m Anglo–Australian Telescope at Siding Spring in New South Wales identified the pulsar as a faint, flashing object with a mean magnitude of 24.2. The period is 0.089 s, the third shortest known for a ‘normal’ pulsar. As a pulsar spins and emits energy, its rate of rotation slows down by measurable amounts. Thus the period of CP1919, Bell’soriginalpulsar, islengtheningbyathousand millionthofasecondeachmonth, sothatin3000years’time the period will be 1.3374 s instead of the current 1.3373 s; thisappliestoallpulsars, includingBell’soriginal, CP1919. The period of the Crab pulsar is increasing by 3 × 10 − 8 s per day. Some pulsars show sudden, irregular changes in period, known as glitches; thus on 1 March 1969 the pulsar PSR 0833 − 45 speeded up by a full quarter of a millionth of a second. Glitches are due to disturbances in the pulsars – in other words, starquakes. Obviously, there must be many pulsars whose beams do not sweep over the Earth. For example, there is the relatively close neutron star known as Geminga; it is a radio and gamma-ray source, lying 300 light-years away. Its optical counterpart is a 25th magnitude star which has moved by 1.8 arcsec in eight years. Geminga emits light rays, X-rays and gamma-rays in all directions, but there are no pulses, so that presumably its beams never sweep across our line of sight. The closest known pulsar is JO108 − 1431, in the constellation of Cetus; it is a thousand times weaker than any other known pulsar, and its age has been estimated as 160 000 000 years. The distance is 280 light-years. In the Guitar Nebula in Cepheus we find the fast-moving pulsar PSR2224 + 65, 6000 light-years away; it spins 1.47 times per second, and is moving at around 270 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"S TELLAR S PECTRA A ND E VOLUTION 900 km s − 1 , presumably as the result of an asymmetrical supernova blast. A few pulsars, such as Hercules X1 and Centaurus X3, pulse only in the X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Binary pulsars are also known; the first-discovered of these, PSR 1913 + 16, consists of two neutron stars orbiting each other in a period of just under 8 h. It is possible that a binary pair of this type may eventually coalesce into a single object. Millisecond pulsars . In October 1982 a team at Berkeley in California, led by D. Backer, found a pulsar in the constellation of Vulpecula – now catalogued as PSR 1937 + 215 – which flashed at a record 642 pulses per second, regularly spaced at intervals of 1.557 ms. This was clearly different from a ‘normal’ pulsar, and still has the shortest period known, although by now many other ‘millisecond pulsars’ have been found. Many of them, though not all, are members of binary systems; the other component can be any kind of highly evolved star. Apparently a millisecond pulsar is an old neutron star which has only a weak magnetic field, and was originally a member of a binary system; the other member was a red giant star, whose outer layers were only weakly held by gravitation. The neutron star pulled material away from its companion, and the gases pulled toward it were heated sufficiently to produce X-rays. As the material struck the surface of the neutron star tangentially, it increased the rotation speed. In some cases the two components separated, leaving the millisecond pulsar isolated 3 . Millisecond pulsars are often found in globular clusters; the first of these was identified in the cluster M.28, in Sagittarius, by Andrew Lyne and his team at Jodrell Bank. In the famous globular cluster 47 Tucanæ there are more than a dozen millisecond pulsars, but not all are members of binary systems. In some cases the companion star will be literally evaporated by the neutron star over a sufficient period of time, and only the millisecond pulsar will be left. Proof of this theory was obtained in 1988 by J. Taylor and A. Fruchter (Princeton University), who found that the pulsar PSR 1957 + 20 in Sagitta – spin rate 622 per second – is evaporating its companion, which is now left 3 There is an easy way to demonstrate this principle. Fasten a table- tennis ball to the end of a string, suspend it, and blow on it through a drinking straw. The ball will at once begin to rotate. with only 1 / 50 of the mass of the Sun. Not inappropriately, the pulsar is known as the Black Widow. A second case, PSR 1744 − 24a, has been found in the globular cluster Terzan 5, where the pulsar seems to be engulfed in the clouds of material which it is pulling away from its doomed companion. 4. Stars too massive initially to form neutron stars . Here we come to the real cosmic heavyweights, with masses of the order of 40 times that of the Sun or even greater. Their fate will be different again; they will produce black holes, a term coined by Archibald Wheeler 30 years ago. The basic principle was suggested as long ago as 1783 by the English natural philosopher John Michell, and again by the great French mathematician Laplace in 1796. Like Newton, Laplace believed light to consist of a stream of particles, and wrote that if a body were sufficiently small and dense it would be invisible, since the light particles would not be able to travel fast enough to escape from it. In fact this is reasonable enough; if the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light, then light cannot break free – and if light cannot do so, then certainly nothing else can. Relativity theory explains the situation rather differ- ently. A massive body distorts the curvature of space (or, more precisely, spacetime), and the paths of rays of light or particles of matter are regulated by the curvature of the space in which they are travelling. At a critical radius from the star, the curvature of space will be so great that it prevents light from escaping; this is known as the Schwarzschild radius, after the German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild, who drew up the theory in 1916. The value of the Schwarzschild radius, in kilometres, is 3 . 0 M , where M is the mass of the body in terms of the Sun. The Schwarzschild radius of the Sun is therefore 3 km; for a star 60 times as massive as the Sun, it will be 60 km; for the Earth, onlyabout9mm. TheboundaryoftheSchwarzschild radius determines the size of the black hole, and is termed the event horizon, because we have no positive information about events taking place inside it; the black hole is to all intents and purposes cut off from the outer universe. A black hole is the result of the collapse of a very massive star. If the mass of the collapsing core exceeds the maximum possible for a neutron star, the collapse continues to a central point of infinite density, termed a singularity THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 271"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"S TELLAR S PECTRA A ND E VOLUTION – a concept which is impossible to describe in everyday language. But before this, the collapsing star will have passed through its event horizon, and will have vanished as effectively as the hunter of the Snark. Close to a black hole there are some very strange effects involving time dilation. A clock will run slow if it is within a strong gravity field (this has been experimentally proved). Picture an astronaut who carries a very accurate clock, and is falling towards a black hole, watched by an observer from a safe distance. The observer will conclude that the astronaut’s clock is slowing down as it nears the event horizon; the interval between the ticks will increase. At the event horizon itself, the interval between the ticks will become infinitely long, so that the observer will assume that the traveller is left poised on the event horizon; but time will pass naturally insofar as the traveller is concerned, and he will simply fall through the event horizon and crash on to the singularity. By that time he will be in poor shape, because the tidal pull on his feet will be far stronger than that on his head (assuming that he is moving feet first), and he will be stretched ou t – a sort of cosmical Procrustes bed! What is the true situation within a black hole, and does the original star’s core crush itself out of existence altogether? We have to admit that we do not know, and since there can be no communication with the region beyond the event horizon it will be very difficult to find out. If the black hole is rotating, the situation is rather different (a black hole of this kind is known as a Kerr black hole, after John Kerr, who first described it). A Kerr black hole is assumed to be surrounded by an ellipsoidal area or ergosphere, in which nothing can avoid being dragged round in the direction of the rotation; the singularity is a ring rather than a point of zero dimensions. There have been suggestions that an astronaut could enter a Kerr black hole, avoid the singularity, and emerge elsewhere, either in our universe or in a totally different universe, via a ‘wormhole’ linking one location in spacetime with another. It is an interestingtheory, butonefeelsthattherewouldbeadefinite shortage of volunteers willing to test it. The famous British mathematician Stephen Hawking has suggested that black holes may finally evaporate. We know that pairs of particles and antiparticles form spontaneously in space, and almost immediately annihilate each other. If this happens close to the event horizon, one particle may fall into the black hole and the other be allowed to escape; the net result is that the mass of the black hole is slightly reduced, and eventually this process might accelerate, in which case the black hole would evaporate completely. Obviously we are theorizing on the basis of very meagre data, and speculation is almost endless. In any case, the universe is not nearly old enough for any solar- mass black hole to have evaporated in this way, and though ‘mini black holes’ have been postulated there is no evidence that they actually exist. Black holes are best detected by their gravitational effects upon objects which we can see. One good candidate is Cygnus X-1, so-called because it is an X-ray source. The system consists of a B0 type supergiant, HDE 226868, with about 30 times the mass of the Sun and a diameter 23 times that of the Sun (18 000 000 km), together with an invisible secondary with 14 times the mass of the Sun. The orbital period is 5.6 days, the distance from us is 6500 light-years, and the magnitude of the primary star is 9 (it lies at RA 19h 56m 295.3, declination + 35 ◦ 3 \u0002 55 \u0002\u0002 , near the star η Cygni). The secondary would certainly be visible if it were a normal star, and it is almost certainly a black hole which is pulling material away from the supergiant; before this material disappears over the event horizon, it is heated sufficiently to give off the X-rays which we receive. Another good candidate is V404 Cygni, which (having presumably been created by a much larger supernova explosion in the remote past) flared up as a nova in 1938, and rose from magnitude 19 to 12 before fading back to its normal brightness. In 1989 observations from the Japanese satellite Ginga showed that X-rays were being emitted, and studies by P. Charles, using the William Herschel telescope at La Palma, indicated that the system consists of a visible star 70% as massive as the Sun together with a black hole of 12 solar masses. The revolution period is 6.5 days. In January 2000 it was announced that isolated black holes had been identified for the first time. Using the gravitational lensing technique, a team using the Australian and Chilean telescopes found evidence of two black holes, each about six times as massive as the Sun, lensing the light of stars in the background. If the lensing objects were ordinary stars they would have outshone the background star; they seem too massive to be white dwarfs or neutron 272 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"S TELLAR S PECTRA A ND E VOLUTION stars, but more observations are needed before any certain conclusions can be drawn. In January 2000 it was announced that the X-ray source V4641 Sagittarii, at a distance of 1600 light-years from Earth, is almost certainly attended by a black hole companion. R. Hjellming examined the system with the Very Large Array, and discovered twin jets shooting out from the system at over 90% of the speed of light. Only three other known systems eject material at such a velocity, and are termed ‘microquasars’. Only the intense gravity of a black hole can generate so much power. This means that the companion to V4641 Sgr is the closest known black hole. We do not yet have final proof that black holes really exist, but all the evidence points that way.

Before leaving the subject of stellar evo- lution, it is worth saying a little about a case in which a star seems to have been caught in the act of changing from a red giant into a white dwarf. This is V4334 in Sagittarius, known as Sakurai’s Object because attention was first drawn to it in February 1996, when the Japanese amateur astronomer Yukio Sakurai observed that it was rapidly brightening. This was due to a flash of helium fusion taking place in a shell surrounding the giant’s car- bon/oxygen core; in six months the star swelled from be- ing a hot dwarf, with a surface temperature of 50 000 ◦ , into a yellow supergiant with a surface temperature of 6000 ◦ C. The inner core contracted, and generated enough heat to start helium burning. The outburst also revealed a previously-unknown planetary nebula associated with the star, and since then there have been interesting spectral changes. The nebula is expanding at the rate of 31 km s − 1 , and now has an apparent diameter of 44 arcsec; its age has been given as between 3800 and 27 000 years. It has also been found that the rapidly evolving star showed a marked drop in temperature between 1996 and 1997. Its subsequent career will be followed with special interest. Another star which seems to be evolving at breakneck speed is FU Sagittæ, which has been seen to change from a B4-type blue giant to an F5-type red giant over a period of less than a century (1900 to the present time). At one stage it passed through the Cepheid instability strip, and now shows variations more like those of an R Coronæ Borealis star. Its mass is 0.6 that of the Sun. Colour of Sirius . En passant , some old reports, dating back to Classical times, describe Sirius as a red star, whereas it is now pure white (type A). There have been suggestions that several thousands of years ago the companion, now a white dwarf, was a red giant, but this explanation seems to be definitely out of court; the time-scale is wrong, and moreover a red giant shining together with the present Sirius would be so bright that it would have caused particular comment. There is little doubt that the description of Sirius as a red star was due to an error either in observation or (much more probably) in interpretation. Of course, as seen from Britain and other northern countries Sirius seems to flash various colours; it twinkles strongly, partly because it is so bright and partly because it is never very high up. From more southerly latitudes it naturally twinkles much less. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 273"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"20 E XTRA-SOLAR P LANETS Our Sun is one of at least a hundred thousand million stars in our Galaxy alone, and many of these stars are of solar type. Therefore, there is every reason to assume that planetary systems are common. If our Solar System had been formed by the near-collision between the Sun and a passing star, it would certainly have been a rarity, or even unique; but this theory has long since been discarded, and there is nothing unusual about the Sun. Brown dwarfs were elusive; extra-solar planets would be even more so. In any case, how does one differentiate between the two classes of objects? A brown dwarf does radiate, albeit very feebly. Like normal stars, brown dwarfs form by the gravitational shrinkage of a rotating mass of gas, whereas planets form by accretion in a disk of material round the parent star – and they have definite cores, whereas brown dwarfs are fully convective. Finally, there is the question of mass. If a low-mass companion of a star has a mass greater than around 13 times that of Jupiter, the most massive planet in our Solar System, it is probably a brown dwarf. The first positive clues came in 1983, from IRAS, the Infra-Red Astronomical Satellite. While calibrating the on-board instruments, H. Aumann and F. Gillett, at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in England, found that the star Vega had ‘a huge infra-red excess’, due presumably to solid particles moving in an extended region round the star and stretching out to about 80 a.u. The temperature of the material was around − 185 ◦ C, and it was suggested that it might indicate a planetary system in the making. Other cases followed; and by now there are several stars with known ‘dust disks’. One of these is Fomalhaut, in Piscis Australis, one of the closest of the bright stars; it is 25 light-years away and 13 times as luminous as the Sun, with an A3-type spectrum. There seems to be a central hole in the dust disk, which may have been excavated by a planet. There is also \u001e Eridani, a mere 10.8 light-years away and one of the two closest stars to bear marked resemblance to the Sun ( τ Ceti is the other). In 1998 observations made at submillimetre wavelengths with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope on Mauna Kea (Hawaii) showed that \u001e Eridani is surrounded by a ring of dust particles, 120 a.u. in diameter, remarkably like the inner comet zone in our Solar System. The star is thought to be no more than 1000 million years old, so that its planetary system – if it has one – is presumably less evolved than ours. A region close to the star seems to be more or less dust-free, so that any particles there may have been absorbed by a planet or planets. However, the most significant case is that of the southern β Pictoris, 78 light-years away according to the Cambridge catalogue and 58 times as luminous as the Sun; it is of spectral type A5. As with Vega, IRAS showed a marked infra-red excess, and the material round it was subsequently detected optically by R. Terrile and B. Smith from the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. The disk of material extends to nearly 80 000 000 000 km for the star; we see it almost edge-on, and it may be no more than a few hundred million years old. The cloud of material shows a depleted region in an area extending from 20 to 30 a.u., and this could be due to the presence of planets, which would sweep up much of the dust. Observations were also made with the IUE (Interna- tional Ultraviolet Explorer) satellite. Then, in May 1991, came results from the Goddard High Resolution Spectro- graph on the Hubble Space Telescope, indicating that the solidparticlesinthediskdiscoveredbyIRASaredistributed over a radius of about 50 a.u.; the main gas-cloud is smaller, and extends to a few astronomical units from the star. The gas consists of several main components: first a diffuse disk circling β Pictoris in a stable manner; second, an inner gas disk which is slowly drifting inwards towards the star; and third, isolated clumps of gas which are spiralling in to- wards β Pictoris at velocities of up to 200 m s − 1 . As the gas clumps pass in front of β Pictoris, the star’s ultra-violet spectrum shows marked changes.

Later observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (1997–8) reveal signifi- cant ‘warps’ in the disk which may be caused by a planet orbiting the star in a slightly inclined orbit. β Pictoris is a young star, and though definite evidence is lacking it is cer- tainly a promising candidate for a planetary system. In 1998 Sally Heap, one of the principal investigators at NASA, commented that ‘the shape of the warp is a telltale indicator that favours the existence of a planet’. It must however by added that alternative explanations have been proposed; and it has even been suggested that the ‘warp’ may be caused by a brown dwarf circling β Pictoris at a much greater distance. In 2000, observations with the Hubble Space Telescope in- dicated that dynamically, the dust ring around β Pictoris was ‘ringing like a bell’. This was attributed to the long- term gravitational effects of a star which by-passed β Pic- toris about 100 000 years ago which is certainly possible, though there is no definite proof. A massive planet orbiting a fairly low-mass star could conceivably produce measurable perturbations in the star’s motion, and efforts to detect planets by this astrometric method go back to the mid-20th century. In 1943 perturbations were suspected in the proper motions of two red dwarfs, 70 Ophiuchi and 61 Cygni, but were found to be due to causes other than planets. At the Sproule Observatory in the United States, P. van de Kamp began in 1937 a long series of observations of Barnard’s Star, a red dwarf only six light-years away (in fact, the nearest star apart from those of the α Centauri group). The luminosity of the star is 0.000 45 that of the Sun, and it has the greatest known proper motion, so that in 170 years it crawls across the sky by a distance equal to the apparent diameter of the full moon. In 1963 van de Kamp announced the detection of a planet with a mass similar to that of Jupiter, moving round the star at a distance of 4.4 a.u. He later claimed that there were at least two planets in the system. However, it was later found that the perturbations were spurious, and were due to faults in van de Kamp’s telescopic equipment. In 1983 R. Harrington, using the 155 cm reflector at the US Naval Observatory, announced that there was a low- mass companion to the faint red dwarf star Van Biesbroeck 8 B. It was said to have a mass from five to eight times that of Jupiter, and to have a surface temperature of 1700 ◦ C– not because it was self-luminous, but because it was being heated by its parent star. Further searches failed to locate it, and it is certainly non-existent. Next, in 1988, slight effects were noted with the naked-eye star γ Cephei (Alrai) which were attributed to the presence of a planet, but these were subsequently found to be due to changes in the star itself. In 1991 came a startling announcement from Jodrell Bank. Using the Lovell radio telescope, A. Lyne and his colleagues announced the discovery of a planet orbiting a pulsar, PSR 1829-10. The method used was that of timing the pulsations, which would be affected by the pull of an orbiting body. The period was given as exactly six months. This too proved to be spurious; the researchers had not taken into account the fact that the Earth’s orbit is an ellipse rather than a circle. As soon as they realized this, they promptly and generously admitted their mistake. There was a major development in September 1995, when two Swiss astronomers, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, made some new observations with the 30 m reflector at the Haute Provence Observatory, in France, and announced the detection of a planet orbiting the star 51 Pegasi, a G4-type star 54 light-years away; it is fractionally less luminous than the Sun, and at an apparent magnitude of 5.5 is easily visible with the naked eye. Mayor and Queloz used an indirect method. As a planet orbits a star, the star itself swings round the common centre of gravity of the system. This affects its radial velocity as seen from Earth, and this can be measured by making use of the Doppler effect; the equipment used by Mayor and Queloz was sensitive enough to detect changes down to 12ms − 1 . The result seemed reliable, but the planet was very peculiar. The mass was about half that of Jupiter, but the distance from the parent star was a mere 7000 000 km – about one-eighth the distance between the Sun and Mercury, the innermost planet of our Solar System. In this case, the surface should be baked to a temperature of around 1300 ◦ C; the orbital period was 4.3 days. All in all, it seemed to be a most improbable object, but other stars were soon found to have planetary companions of the same kind. Among them were τ Bo ̈ otis, ρ Coronæ Borealis and ρ \u0002 Canori.

One star, υ Andromedæ, has apparently three planets; one is rather less massive than Jupiter, but the outermost member of the family could match well over four Jupiters. In November 1999 a team of astronomers using the Keck I telescope in Hawaii (S. Vogt, P. Butler and K. Apps) announced the discovery of six more extra- solar planets orbiting solar-type stars. In most cases the masses of the planets were comparable with that of Jupiter. In March 2000 G. Marcy, P. Butler and S. Vogt announced the discovery of a planet orbiting the star 79 Ceti, 117 light- years away. The orbit is elliptical, with a mean distance of 0.35 a.u. from the star. The temperature must be of the order of 830 ◦ C. The mass is probably about 70% that of saturn. Other planetary attendants have been suggested; it is even claimed that the brilliant Aldebaran has a companion, 11 times as massive as Jupiter, at a distance of 1.3–1.4 a.u. – although this is very tentative, and if the companion really exists it could be a brown dwarf. Another possible way of detecting extra-solar planets is to observe the effects produced when the companions pass in front of the parent star. In December 1999 it was announced that a team of British astronomers, using the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope on La Palma, had obtained visual confirmation 276 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"E XTRA-SOLAR P LANETS of a planet orbiting the star τ Bo ̈ otis. C. Cameron, K. Horne and D. James from the University of St. Andrews, together with A. Penney, developed a sensitive new computer program which was able to untangle the faint light of the planet from the glare of the parent star. The computer analysis revealed a faint copy of the star’s spectrum, embedded in the starlight and wobbling back and forth in a sense exactly opposite to the star’s own, smaller wobble. This is exactly how light reflected from a closely orbiting planet should behave; the planet’s light will be blue-shifted when the planet is approaching Earth, red-shifted when it is receding (the overall motion of the system being taken into account). The wobble was only half the size expected for a planet in a nearly edge-on orbit. This indicates that the orbit was strongly tilted to the line of sight. Knowing the tilt enabled the team to find that the planet’s mass is 8 times that of Jupiter. The tilt also explains why the planet is so faint. Even when the planet is on the far side of the star, we never see the face fully illuminated, so that the planet is always 30 000 times fainter than the star. It has been suggested that the planet’s atmosphere may be a chemical cauldron at a temperature of around 1700 ◦ C. D. Sudarsky and his colleagues at the University of Arizona recently predicted an alien environment in which elements such as sodium and potassium, which take the form of metals on Earth, are present as trace gases in a hot hydrogen atmosphere above a cloud-deck of magnesium silicate droplets. Certainly the sighting of the τ Bo ̈ otis planet is a major advance. No doubt other visual discoveries will be made in the near future. The European Space Agency is already planning what is known as the Darwin project. This involves sending several small infra-red telescopes into the outer part of the Solar System; these will be linked to form an interferometer. The aim will be to search for planets of stars within a range of 50 light-years. It is hoped that the first of the so-called ‘Cornerstone’ telescopes will be launched in 2009. The first ‘pulsar planet’ proved to be spurious, but several others have been reported since, mainly by A.Wolszczan, workingatthePennStateUniversitytogether with D. Frail. In 1990 Wolszczan used the Arecibo radio telescope to study the pulsar 1257 + 12, which has a period of 6.2 ms and its between 1500 and 3000 light-years away. He found evidence of two companions of planetary mass, bothveryclosetothepulsar. Planetshavealsobeenreported with the pulsar PSR B1620 − 26 and the strange neutron star Geminga, which is probably a pulsar but is not detectable as such because its radio beams do not sweep over the Earth (though in the case of Geminga there are serious doubts). Pulsar planets are admittedly very difficult to explain, and if they really exist, as most researchers believe, they must indeed be bizarre worlds.

T HE D RAKE E QUATION Assuming that extra-solar planets exist – and of this there no longerseemsanyreasonabledoubt–wemustspeculateasto the chances of intelligent civilizations with which we might communicate. In 1961 Frank Drake worked out a method of estimating mathematically the numbers of worlds which might support civilizations able and willing to communicate with us. The celebrated Drake Equation is as follows: N = R ∗ f p n e f l f i f c L where N = the number of communicative civilizations, R ∗ = the rate of formation of suitable solar-type stars, f p = the fraction of those stars which have planetary systems, n e = the number of Earth-like worlds per planetary system, f l = the fraction of those Earth-like worlds where life actually develops, f i = the fraction of life-sites where intelligence develops, f c = the fraction of planets supporting a civilization technologically capable of communicating with us, and L = the fraction of a planet’s life in which a communicative civilization endures. It is all too obvious that most of these figures are highly uncertain; forexample, consider L –doesacivilizationwipe itself out when it has the technical capability to do so, and lacks the will to refrain? (After all, we on Earth are in precisely this position at the present moment.) Drake came to the final conclusion that there ought to be about 10 000 communicative civilizations in our Galaxy. Whether or not he was correct remains to be seen!

Binaries are much the more frequent. They range from ‘contact pairs’, where the components are almost or quite touching, to very distant pairs separated by at least a light-year. In a binary system the components move round their common centre of gravity. For visual binaries, the shortest period is that of Wolf 630 Ophiuchi (1.725 years), but shorter periods are known; the record- holder is X-1820-303, an X-ray star in the globular cluster NGC 6623, distance 30 000 light-years. Its period is 685 s or 11 min. It was discovered in 1987 by the aptly-named Luigi Stella and collaborators with the Exosat satellite. It is impossible to say which is the binary with the longest period, and all we can say is that very widely-separated components share a common motion through space. E arly o bservations The term ‘double star’ was first used by Ptolemy, who wrote that η Sagittarii was ‘ διπλυ o ζ ’. There are of course several doubles which can be separated with the naked eye, so that presumably they have been known since antiquity; of these the most celebrated is Mizar ( ζ Ursæ Majoris), which makes a naked-eye pair with Alcor (80 Ursæ Majoris). The Arabs described it –although they regarded Alcor as a rather difficult object. This is not true today, but it is most unlikely that there has been any real change. The first double star to be discovered telescopically was Mizar itself, which is made up of two rather unequal components separated by 14 \u0002\u0002 . 5. The discovery was made by Riccioli in 1651. Alcor is 700 \u0002\u0002 from the main pair, which is rather too wide to be classed as a recognized ‘double’ in the official catalogues. The duplicity of γ Arietis was discovered in 1665 by Robert Hooke, while he was searching telescopically for a comet. The first southern double star to be discovered was α Crucis, by Father Guy Tachard, in 1685. Tachard was on his way to Siam, by sea, and stopped off at the Cape of Good Hope, where he was warmly welcomed by the Dutch settlers and set up a temporary observatory, mainly for navigational purposes. He recorded that ‘the foot of the Crozier marked in Bayer’s map is a Double Star, that is to say consisting of two bright stars distant from one another about their own Diameter, only much like the most northern of the Twins, not to speak of a third much less, which is also to be seen but further from these two’. The Crozier is the Southern Cross; ‘Bayer’ refers to J. Bayer’s famous catalogue of 1603, and the ‘northern of the Twins’ is Castor, which was already known to be double. (Like most of his contemporaries, Tachard believed the stars to show definite apparent diameters rather than being virtual point sources.) Other doubles discovered at an early stage were α Centauri (1689), γ Virginis and the ‘Trapezium’, θ Orionis, in the Orion Nebula, which is a multiple system. D ouble S tar c atalogues The first true list of doubles was published in 1771 by C. Mayer of Mannheim. This list included γ Andromedæ, ζ Cancri, α Herculis and β Cygni. Most of his observations were made with an 80 ft mural quadrant, with magnifications of 60 and 80. Many catalogues have appeared since. Among them are those by F. G. W. Struve (Dorpat 1822, with later additions); E. Dembowski (Naples 1852; over 20 000 measures), S. W. Burnham (1870 and again in 1906, listing 13 665 pairs – he was personally responsible for the discovery of 1340 of them); R. Aitken (1932, 17 180 pairs) and the Lick Index Catalogue or IDS (1963, 65 000 pairs, of which 40 000 are binaries). Work of the greatest importance was carried out at the Republic Observatory, Johannesburg (formerly the Union Observatory) between 1917 and 1965, under the successive directorships of R. T. A. Innes (1917–27), H. E. Wood (1927–41), W. H van den Bos (1941–56) and W. S. Finsen (1957–65); the telescope used was the 27 inch (69 cm) Innes refractor.

The catalogue includes details of over 12 000 double stars, of which 3000 were new discoveries. The accuracy was truly amazing. For example, images were obtained of the double star HIP 46706 in Hydra, which is 34 light-years away; the components are separated by only about 1 / 5000 of a degree. This is a binary system (period 18.3 years); the masses of the components are 0.42 and 0.41 that of the Sun. The position angle of a visual double star (either an optical or a binary pair) is measured according to the angular direction of the secondary (B) from the primary (A), reckoned from 000 at north round by east (090), south (180) and west (270), back to north. With rapid binaries the position angles and separations alter quickly; a good example is the fine binary ζ Herculis, where the magnitudes are 3 and 5.6, and the period only 34 years. Some of the published catalogues are already out of date, and need revising. There is scope here for the skilful and well- equipped amateur as well as for the professional. B inary s ystems The first suggestion that some double stars might be physically-associated pairs was made by the Rev. John Michell in 1766, who wrote: ‘It is highly probable, in particular, and next to a certainty, in general, that such double stars as appear to consist of two or more stars placed very near together, do really consist of stars under the influence of some general law.’ Michell repeated this view in 1784. However, in 1782 William Herschel commented that it was ‘much too soon to form any theories of small stars revolving around large ones’. The actual proof was given by Herschel himself in 1802. From 1779 he had been attempting to measure the parallaxes of stars, since if one member of the pair were more remote than the other it followed that the closer member should show an annual parallax relative to the more distant component. He failed, because his equipment was not sufficiently sensitive, but he made the fortuitous discovery that some of the pairs under study (such as Castor) showed orbital motion, and by 1802 he was confident enough to publish his findings. His classic paper actually appeared in the Philosophical Transactions on 9 June 1803. The first reliable orbit for a binary pair ( ξ Ursæ Majoris) was worked out by the French astronomer Felix Savary in 1830. (The period is 60 years.) Such calculations are of great importance, since they lead to a determination of the combined masses of the components – something which is much more difficult to calculate for a single star. In fact, our knowledge of stellar masses depends very largely upon the orbital movements of binaries. It has been calculated that more than 50% of all stars are members of binary systems, with a mean separation of 10–20 a.u., although this may be too high a ratio. It is important to note that both components of a binary move round their common centre of gravity, and the orbits are not in general so dissimilar as might be thought, since in mass there is a far lower spread among the stars than there is in luminosity and in size. Incidentally, it was the measurements of a binary – 61 Cygni – which led F. W. Bessel, in 1838, to make the first successful determination of the distance of a star. 61 Cygni was selected because it had a large proper motion and was a wide binary, indicating that by stellar standards it must be comparatively close (the distance is 11.1 light-years). The first spectroscopic binary (Mizar A) was discovered in 1889 by E. C. Pickering at Harvard; another identification ( β Aurigæ) soon followed. Spectroscopic binarieshavetoosmallaseparationforthecomponentstobe seen individually, but the binary nature of the system betrays itself because of the Doppler shifts in the spectra. If both spectra are visible, the absorption lines will be periodically doubled; if one spectrum is too faint to be seen, the lines due to the primary will oscillate around a mean position. There are some ‘borderline’ cases; thus Capella was long known to be a spectroscopic binary, but only the world’s largest telescopes can just indicate that it is not a single star. The orbital period is 100 days. The first astrometric binaries to be studied were Sirius and Procyon, by F. W. Bessel in 1844. In an astrometric binary, the presence of an invisible companion is inferred from slight displacements of the primary. (This, of course, is also one important method for detecting planetary or brown dwarf companions of visible stars.) There is an interesting corollary with regard to the Companion of Sirius. It was first seen in 1862 by Clark, usingtheWashingtonrefractor, almostexactlywhereBessel had predicted.

For many years after its discovery the companion was assumed to be faint because it was cool and red, but in 1915 W. S. Adams, at Mount Wilson, studied its spectrum and found that it was white; the surface temperature was at least 8000 ◦ C. Since the luminosity was only 1 / 10 000 of that of Sirius itself, the companion had to be small – no larger than a planet such as Uranus or Neptune. The companion was, in fact, the first known white dwarf, with a density 125 000 times that of water. The absolute magnitude is + 11 . 4, and if we could bring a cubic inch of its material back to Earth the weight would be about two and a half tons. Since Sirius is commonly known as the Dog Star, the companion has predictably been nicknamed the Pup. The companion of Procyon, first seen in 1896 by J. M. Schaeberle with the aid of the Yerkes refractor, is also a white dwarf; the separation was greatest in 1990, and is now decreasing again to a minimum of no more than 2 arcsec. The real separation is 2250 000 000 km, rather less than the distance between our Sun and the planet Uranus. Binary systems are of many different kinds; sometimes the components are dissimilar (as with Sirius), sometimes they are identical twins – as with γ Virginis, which has a period of 171 years. Several decades ago γ Virginis was wide and easy to split with a very small telescope, but it is now closing, and by 2016 will be single except when seen with a very powerful telescope, after which it will start to open out again. This does not indicate any actual change in separation; everything depends upon the angle from which we see the pair. Another binary, formerly easy to split but now much less so, is Castor. Here, both components of the bright pair are spectroscopic binaries, and also associated with the system is Castor C or YY Geminorum, made up of two red dwarfs; it is an eclipsing binary. Castor therefore consists of six stars, four luminous and two very dim. Multiple stars are not uncommon. Of special note is \u001e Lyræ, near Vega in the sky; it has two main components, making up a naked-eye pair, and each component is again double, making up a quadruple system. θ Orionis, in the Orion Nebula (M.42) has been nicknamed the Trapezium, for obvious reasons; it lies on the outskirts of the nebula and is responsible for making the nebulosity luminous. Some double stars show beautiful contrasting colours. Thus β Cygni has a golden-yellow primary with a vivid blue companion; Antares and α Herculis have fainter green secondaries; with δ Geminorum the primary is yellow and the companion pale blue. A list of prominent double stars is given in Table 21.1. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 281"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"D OUBLE S TARS O rigin o f b inary s ystems The old theory – that a binary was formed as a result of the fission of a single star – has been abandoned, and neither is it likely that binaries are due to the mutual capture of the components. It seems that the components were formed from the same cloud of interstellar material in the same region of space. When there is a marked difference in brightness between the two components, the spectra also differ. If both stars belong to the Main Sequence, the primary is usually of earlier type than the secondary, while if the primary is a giant the secondary is either a giant of earlier type or else a dwarf of similar spectral type. Novæ are binary systems (see below). If the two components of a binary system are close together, the evolution of one component may profoundly affect the other. In such a system there is an hourglass- shaped region bounded by the points where the two stars will equally affect a small particle; each of the two segments of the ‘hourglass’ encloses a region termed a Roche lobe. The two Roche lobes may touch at what is termed the Inner Lagrangian Point. The giant component of a close binary will evolve more quickly than its lower- mass companion; as it expands it may fill its Roche lobe completely, and material will flow across the Inner Lagrangian Point on to the second star, so that there is actual transfer of mass from one component to the other, and the original secondary may in time become the more massive of the two. There are also cases in which the two components share a common envelope as the expansion continues, and if one component accumulates enough mass it may explode as a supernova. The evolutionary careers of the members of a close binary system are decidedly complicated. White dwarf binaries are known; the first of these was found by W. Luyten and P. Higgins in 1973 (RA 9h 42m, declination + 23 ◦ 41 \u0002 ). The separation is 13 arcsec, the position angle 052 and the period 12 000 years; at present the components are 600 a.u. apart. X-ray binaries were reported following the launch of the first X-ray astronomical satellite, UHURU, in 1970. A system of this kind consists of a white dwarf, neutron star or black hole orbiting another star which may, in some cases, be a high-mass O- or B-type star, and in others a B- or K-type star of mass similar to that of the Sun. E clipsing b inaries As the two components of a binary move round their common centre of gravity, it may happen that one component will pass in front of the other as seen from Earth; this will cause a change in brightness. Stars of such a kind are usually called eclipsing variables, although ‘eclipsing binary’ is much more accurate. The first to be discovered was Algol ( β Persei), by G. Montanari in 1669. It is not now thoughtthatthevariabilitywasknowninancienttimes, even though Algol was always called ‘the Demon Star’. With Algol, one component is considerably brighter than the other, so that there is a deep minimum when the primary star is eclipsed (even though the eclipse is not total). The drop in magnitude when the fainter member of the two is hidden is too slight to be noticed with the naked eye. With stars of the β Lyræ type the two components are much less unequal, and are almost or quite touching, so that changes in brightness are always going on. Since eclipsing binaries do show changes in brightness, they are dealt with in the next section. Incidentally, even the term ‘eclipsing binary’ is technically wrong. It really ought to be ‘occulting binary’. 282 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"22 V ARIABLE S TARS Variable stars are of many types. Elaborate systems of classifying them have been proposed, and the data given here are not intended to be more than a general guide. Seven major categories are now recognized. (1) Eclipsing stars (more properly eclipsing binaries, because they are not intrinsically variable). (2) Pulsating variables; either radial or non-radial pulsations. (3) Eruptive variables, where the changes are caused by flares or the ejection of shells of material. (4) Cataclysmic variables, where the changes are due to explosions in the star or in an accretion disk round it. Novæ, dwarf novæ and supernovæ come into this category. (5) Rotating variables, where the changes are caused by star-spots, non-spherical shape or magnetic effects. (6) X-ray variables, usually inherent in the neutron star or black hole companion of a binary. (7) Unclassifiable stars, which do not fit into any accepted category. Mention should also be made of what are termed secular variables: stars which have permanently brightened or faded in historic times. Thus Ptolemy ranked β Leonis and θ Eridani as of the first magnitude, whereas today they are below magnitude 2 and 3 respectively; α Ophiuchi was ranked of magnitude 3, but is now 2.1. However, these changes must be regarded as highly suspect. It is unwise to trust the old observations too far. E arly i dentifications The first variable to be positively identified as such was Mira (o Ceti) in 1638. It had been recorded by Fabricius (1596) and Bayer (1603), and Bayer had even allotted it a Greek letter, so that it is surprising that its fluctuations were not recognized until 1638 (by Phocylides Holwarda). In the latter part of the 17th century two more variables were identified, Algol and χ Cygni. Table 22.1 lists the variables identified between 1638 and 1850, excluding novæ. Table 22.1.

Algol type (EA) . The components are more or less spherical, and are unequal, so that an Algol variable remains at maximum for most of the time. The secondary minimum, when the faint component is hidden, is often very slight. With Algol ( β Persei), the prototype EA star, the primary eclipse it not total. The main component (Algol A) is of type B, 105 times as luminous as the Sun, with a diameter of about 4000 000 km. Algol B, the companion, is not genuinely dark; it is of type G, and about three times as luminous as the Sun. It has a diameter of 5500 000 km, so that it is larger than the primary and qualifies as a sub-giant. The secondary minimum is less than 0m.1 in amplitude. The distance from the Earth is 95 light-years. EA stars are common enough, but few are naked- eye objects; apart from Algol, only λ Tauri, δ Libræ and ζ Phœnicis rise above the fifth magnitude. A list of bright eclipsing stars is included in the bright-variable catalogue (Table 22.4). β Lyræ type (EB) . Here the two components are much less unequal, so that there are alternate deep and shallow minima. The prototype star, β Lyræ itself, has a period of 13 days. The maximum magnitude is 3.4. The star fades to magnitude 3.8, recovers and then goes through its primary minimum, which takes it down to below 4. It then returns to maximum, and the cycle is repeated. The components are almost touching each other, and are tidally distorted into egg-like shapes; the more massive component has filled its Roche lobe, and material is streaming through the Inner Lagrangian Point to form an accretion disk round the less massive star. There is evidence that the components are connected by huge streamers of gas moving at over 300 km s − 1 . The primary minimum as seen from Earth is caused by a total eclipse, the secondary minimum by a partial eclipse. W Ursæ Majoris type (EW) . Dwarf binaries of types F or G; the components are almost or quite in contact, and the two minima are more or less equal. The periods are less than one day. There are no naked-eye examples; the maximum mag- nitude of the prototype, W UrsæMajoris itself, is only 7.9. 284 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"V ARIABLE S TARS Very long-period eclipsing binaries . A few eclipsing stars have periods of years. The most celebrated of these is \u001e Aurigæ, one of a triangle of stars close to Capella in the sky (they are often known as the Hædi, or Kids). \u001e Aurigæ is generally just above the third magnitude, but every 27 years it fades, taking over five months to drop down to magnitude 3.8. The minimum lasts for just over a year, followed by a gradual recovery. The eclipsing companion has never been seen, and neither has its spectrum; the primary is a very luminous supergiant of type F – according to the Cambridge catalogue, 200 000 times as powerful as the Sun, although this may be something of an over-estimate. It is generally believed that the secondary is a fairly normal, very hot blue star which is contained inside a huge shell of gas which is virtually opaque and which causes the eclipses. The last eclipse began on 22 July 1982; totality lasted from 11 January 1983 to 16 January 1984, and the partial phase ended on 25 June 1984, so that the next eclipse is not due until 2009. Also in the triangle of the ‘Kids’ is the other celebrated long-period eclipsing binary, ζ Aurigæ (this is sheer coincidence; ζ is much the closer of the two). The period is 972 days, and both spectra are visible; the primary is a supergiant, while the companion is much smaller and hotter. As the supergiant begins to hide the secondary, at the start of the eclipse, the light of the secondary comes to us through the supergiant’s outer layers, and there are complicated spectral changes which are highly informative. Totality lasts for 38 days, and the magnitude falls from 3.7 to 4.2. P ulsating v ariables Here the variations are intrinsic. The star expands and contracts, changing its surface temperature and its output as it does so. Mira variables (M) , often called long-period variables; Mira Ceti is the brightest member of the class. They are late-type red giants with emission lines in their spectra. The periods range from 80 days to over 1000 days, and the amplitudes are large – well over 10 magnitudes in some cases (as with χ Cygni, where the extreme range is from magnitude 3.3 to 14.2). Neither the periods nor the amplitudes are constant, and no two cycles are exactly alike. At some maxima Mira may rise to the second magnitude, and it is reported that in 1779 it matched Aldebaran, but other maxima are no brighter than magnitude 4, and on average Mira is a naked-eye object for only a few weeks in every year. Minima are always about magnitude 10. The period is 332 days, but this may vary by a day or two either way. Mira is a huge star. Measurements with the Hubble SpaceTelescopegivetheangulardiameteras60milliarcsec. This corresponds to a true diameter 700 times that of the Sun. Yet it is not so massive or so luminous as might be expected; the absolute magnitude ranges between − 2 . 5 and + 4 . 7, so that even at its peak it is not much more than 1000 times as powerful as the Sun. Mira has a binary companion, which is itself variable and has been given a variable star designation (VZ Ceti). The range is from magnitude 9.5 to 12. The companion is probably a white dwarf in interaction with Mira, surrounded by an accretion disk of material which it has captured from the primary. The orbital period is 400 years, and the separation 70 a.u. The Hubble Space Telescope has also detected a small, hook-like appendage extending from Mira in the direction of the companion, and Mira is itself rather football-shaped instead of spherical. No doubt the presence of the companion is responsible for this. Several Mira variables reach naked-eye visibility – for instance, χ Cygni (which is a particularly strong infra-red source) and the southern R Carinæ. All are of spectral types M or later. Semi-regular variables (SR) . These also are of late spectral type. In some cases the periods are so rough that they are almost unrecognizable, and again no two cycles are alike. The amplitudes are much less than with Mira stars; the periods range from 20 days to over 1000 days. There are various sub-divisions: SRa: late-type supergiants with relatively stable cycles; SRb: less regular cycles; SRc; red supergiants; SRd; orange to yellow supergiants. The brightest semi-regular variable is Betelgeux, in Orion.

The distance given in the Cambridge catalogue (310 light-years) may be an underestimate; other catalogues increase it to 520 light-years. The angular diameter is 0 \u0002\u0002 . 048, and this is large enough for surface details to be seen with the largest telescopes. There are apparently huge convection cells rising to the surface. The real diameter is greater than that of the orbit of the Earth. At its peak, Betelgeux is 15 000 times as luminous as the Sun, but its mass is only between 10 and 20 times that of the Sun; there is a vast, extended atmosphere. Betelgeux is well advanced in its evolutionary sequence, and eventually it will no doubt explode as a supernova. When this happens, the apparent magnitude as seen from Earth will be around − 9. μ Cephei – nicknamed the ‘Garnet Star’ by William Herschel because of its colour – is much larger even than Betelgeux, and may in fact be the largest star known, but is further away (well over 1000 light-years). The range is from magnitude 3.4 to just below 5, and the period is officially given as 730 days, but, as with Betelgeux, this is very rough indeed. Other bright semi-regulars are α Herculis, η Geminorum and β Pegasi. With β Pegasi, in the ‘Square’, the 38 day period is reasonably well defined.

The Cepheid period – luminosity law states that the longer the period, the more powerful the star. The period of pulsation is the time taken for a vibration to travel from the surface of the star towards the centre and back again, so that these periods are longer for larger and brighter stars; at its peak δ Cephei is at least 6000 times more luminous than the Sun.

It was thought that the pulsations might cease altogether, but since 1995 the amplitude has stabilized at 0m.03. It remains in the ‘instability strip’ of the H–R diagram, where every star ought to pulsate; this strip occupies a region between the Main Sequence and the red giant branch. Unlike Mira stars, Cepheids are perfectly regular, and the cycles repeat each other, so that the magnitude at any THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 289"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"V ARIABLE S TARS particular moment can be predicted. Either the rise of maximum is sharper than the subsequent decline, or else the light-curve is virtually symmetrical. W Virginis stars (CW) are associated with Cepheids, and may be termed Type 2 Cepheids or Population II Cepheids. They have lower masses than the classical Cepheids, and are about two magnitudes fainter; they are also metal-poor rather than metal-rich, and their periods are less precise. The only naked-eye example is κ Pavonis, in the southern sky. RR Lyræ variables (RR) . These were once called cluster- Cepheids, because they are common in globular clusters; however, many of them (including the prototype, RR Lyræ) are not cluster members. The spectra are of type A or F. They are old, with masses lower than that of the Sun, but radii four to five times greater, and all are of about the same luminosity, 95 times that of the Sun, so – like the Cepheids – they can be used as ‘standard candles’. The amplitude is around 1 magnitude, and the periods are from 0.2 to 1.2 days,. There are various sub-divisions. RRAB stars (formerly divided into two sub-classes, RRa and RRb) have amplitudes of 0.3 to 1 magnitude, and periods of from 0.5 to 0.7 days. RRc stars have almost sinusoidal light-curves, with amplitudes around 0.5 magnitude and periods around 0.3 days. Some RR Lyræ stars, such as AR Herculis, have several pulsation periods, and this results in a continuous deformation of the light curve (Blazhko effect). Dwarf Cepheids were once classed with the RR Lyræ stars, as RRs; the prototype is AI Velorum. They are of types A to F, with absolute magnitudes of from + 1to + 5, and periods from 0.05 to 0.25 day. RV Tauri variables (RV) . Radially pulsating yellow to red supergiants, usually of types F to K, but occasionally M. There are alternate deep and shallow minima; the interval between successive primary minima may be from 30 to 150 days, with amplitudes up to 4 magnitudes. There are several subdivisions: RVa: the period is not constant, but is at least reasonably consistent for most of the time; the brightest member of the class, R Scuti, is of this type; RRb: several superimposed cycles, with rough periods of from 30 to 100 days. δ Scuti variables (DSCT) . These are stars belonging to the galactic disk (Population I) and are young; types A to F. The amplitudes range from below 0.1 up to 0.9 magnitude, and many are spectroscopic binaries. Sub-dwarfs showing the same characteristics are termed SX Phœnicis stars . In 1999 a new class was proposed. The prototype star is γ Dorad ˆ us, a 4th-magnitude star in the southern hemisphere. These stars have spectra around type F0; they are main sequence stars slightly hotter and more massive than the Sun, but cooler than δ Scuti stars. Stars such as δ Scuti are expected to pulsate, since they lie in the instability strip of the H–R Diagram, but γ Dorad ˆ us stars are outside the instability strip. It is suggested that they undergo non-radial pulsations; portions of their outer layers expand outward while other portions contract, as against stars such as Cepheids which expand and contract as a unit, thereby preserving spherical symmetry. The amplitudes of γ Dorad ˆ us stars are very small (several hundredths of a magnitude). β Cephei variables (BCEP) (sometimes called β Canis Majoris variables). B0 to B3 giants or sub-giants, with periods of from 0.1 to 0.7 day, and amplitudes from 0.1 to 0.3magnitude. Theyarerelativelymassivestarswhichhave almost exhausted their core hydrogen. Ultra-short periods of a few hundredths of a day are suffixed s; a typical example is χ Centauri. α Cygni variables (ACYG) . Pulsating supergiants of types B or A; very small amplitudes. Deneb is the best-known example. ZZ Ceti variables (ZZ) . Pulsating white dwarfs, with periods which may be as short as 30 s and never as long as half an hour. The amplitudes are below 0.2 mag. Suffixes A, B or O indicate spectral features such as lines of hydrogen, helium or carbon. E ruptive v ariables Fuors (FU). Named after the prototype star, FU Orionis. In a star of this kind there is a very slow rise to a maximum which may last for years, followed by a slower decline. Emission lines develop in the spectrum. The types are usually A to G. 290 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"V ARIABLE S TARS γ Cassiopeiæ variables (GCAS) . Rapidly rotating blue giants, usually of type B, which occasionally throw off shells of material. γ Cassiopeiæ itself is the prototype. Its usual magnitude is just below 2, but in the late 1930s it rose to 1.6 before declining to 3.2; for decades now the magnitude has hovered around 2.2. T Tauri variables . These are very young stars, still contracting towards the Main Sequence and varying irregularly; they are strong infra-red emitters, and send out pronounced stellar winds. T Tauri itself lies in a dark dust cloud; many are found inside nebulæ. The Sun certainly passed throug haTT auri stage early in its evolution. R Coronæ Borealis variables (RCB) . These are hydrogen- poor, but rich in carbon. They are highly luminous, and remain at a maximum for most of the time; they then undergo sudden, unpredictable falls to a minimum, taking from several weeks to many months to recover. The amplitudes are large – at least 10 magnitudes in the case of R Coronæ itself, which is usually on the fringe of naked- eye visibility (magnitude 6) but at some minima falls below magnitude 15. The fadings are due to clouds of soot accumulating in the star’s atmosphere. R Coronæ stars are rare. RS Canum Venaticorum variables (RS) . Close binaries with chromospheric activity, causing slight light variations. S Dorad ˆ us variables (SDOR) . Massive, very luminous blue supergiants, usually surrounded by expanding envelopes. They are often found in diffuse nebulæ; generally the amplitude is small, but there may be occasional outbursts up to 7 magnitudes, lasting for many weeks. These are due to the ejection of shells of material. S Dorad ˆ us itself lies in the Large Cloud of Magellan, at a distance of 169 000 light- years, and has a mass about 60 times that of the Sun; although it is almost a million times as luminous as the Sun, it is too faint to be seen with the naked eye (magnitude 11). Flare stars: UV Ceti type (UV) . Red dwarfs, of type K or (usually) M. Flare activity produces sudden outbursts of from 1 to 6 magnitudes, lasting for several minutes. All flare stars show emission lines in their spectra. UV Ceti itself is normally of magnitude 13.4, but on one occasion brightened abruptly to 6.8. Many red dwarfs show flare activity of a less spectacular kind; among these is Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to the Sun. Flash variables (UVa) are of earlier spectral type, and are more luminous; they are associated with nebulosity. Wolf–Rayet stars (W) . These are highly luminous, and are unstable, with expanding envelopes; this causes random, low-amplitude changes in brightness. Their spectra show emission lines of nitrogen and carbon, and there is evidence for unstable mass outflow as a stellar wind. The exceptional star ρ Cassiopeiæ, near the W of Cassiopeia, is officially classed as an eruptive variable, but it is very much of a puzzle. Normally it is of magnitude 5.1, with slight fluctuations, but there are occasional minima, and in 1946 it dropped briefly to magnitude 6.2. It is immensely luminous, with an absolute magnitude of at least − 8, and may be one of the most powerful stars in the Galaxy. Its spectral type is F8. R otating v ariables α 2 Canum Venaticorum stars (ACV) . These are white stars, usually of type B or A, which have intense magnetic fields. It seems that there are huge ‘starspots’, produced by the magnetic fields; there are variable spectral lines due to silicon, strontium, chromium and rare-earth elements. Periods range between 12 h and 160 days. The spectra are very variable, but the light fluctuations are very small. BY Draconis stars (BY) . Red dwarfs, with large starspots and active chromospheres. The periods may reach 20 days. Ellipsoidal variables (ELL) . Tidally distorted close binaries. The changes in light are due to the varying areas presented, but there are no eclipses, as with β Lyræ stars. As the fluctuations are not intrinsic, it would be more accurate to refer to these stars as ellipsoidal binaries. FK Comæ variables (FKCOM) . Rapidly rotating yellow or orange giants, types G to K, with periods up to several days and amplitudes of no more than half a magnitude. The surfaces are of non-uniform brightness, and it is this which causes the fluctuations, so that again it cannot really be said that these stars are intrinsically variable. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 291"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"V ARIABLE S TARS SX Arietis variables (SXARI) . These are similar to the α 2 Canum Venaticorum stars, except that they are richer in helium and have higher temperatures. The amplitudes never exceed 0.1 magnitude. Finally there are reflection binaries (R) , where a large, cool component is illuminated by its hotter companion, leading to variations of up to a magnitude as the system rotates. η Carinæ . Unquestionably the most erratic of all variables is η Carinæ (before the dismemberment of the old constellation of Argo Navis, it was known as η Arg ˆ us). It has a strange history. It was recorded by Halley, in 1677, as being of the fourth magnitude. It remained between magnitudes 4 and 2 until 1827, when it blazed up to the first magnitude. In 1837 John Herschel, from the Cape, made it as bright as α Centauri, and following a slight fade it reached its greatest brilliance in April 1843, when it outranked Canopus and almost matched Sirius. Then a decline set in. By 1870 η was only of the sixth magnitude, and it has remained at around this level ever since. At its peak, the luminosity was of the order of 6000 000 times that of the Sun, and it has not really declined a great deal, since most of its emission is in the infra-red. The distance is of the order of 8000 light-years, and the mass is at least 100 times that of the Sun. It is associated with nebulosity, and superimposed on this is a dark, dusty region known as the Keyhole Nebula from its shape. What apparently happened in the years following 1834 is that there was a massive explosion, which threw off a shell of material from the surface of the star. As the shell expanded, the star seemed to brighten; after 1843 the shell itself cooled, dimmed and finally became opaque, hiding the light of the star beneath. After a century and a half of expansion, at a rate of 700 km s − 1 , we now see the shell as a tiny nebula, nicknamed the Homunculus Nebula from its shape; it is orange in colour, and telescopically η Carinæ looks quite unlike an ordinary star. Images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope show the billowing clouds of expanding material. η Carinæ is unstable, and there is no doubt that it will explode as a supernova. This will probably happen within the next few hundreds of thousands of years. P Cygni . Another very remote, very luminous star is P Cygni. It was first recorded in 1600, when it was of the third magnitude. By 1626 it had dropped below naked-eye visibility, but brightened again in 1655. After further fluctuations is settled down in 1715 at magnitude 5, and since then there has been little change. It was once classed as a nova, but is now officially listed as a variable of the S Dorad ˆ us type. However, its luminosity may be comparablewiththatof η Carinæ, andittooisveryunstable. Certainly it ranks as one of the most powerful stars in the Galaxy. Its distance is not known accurately; one estimate is just under 6000 light-years. A few other stars of the same general type are known. C ataclysmic v ariables Novæ . Novæcanbespectacularintheextreme. Thenameis misleading, because a nova is not a new star. What happens is that a formerly faint star suffers a tremendous outburst, and flares up to many times its normal brightness, remaining bright for a few days, weeks or months before fading back to obscurity. Some novæ remain bright only briefly. The rise may take only a few hours, as with the bright nova V1500 Cygni of 1975, which reached an absolute magnitude of − 10 and an apparent magnitude of 1.8; within a week it had fallen below naked-eye visibility, whereas slow novæ, such as HR Delphini, of 1967, are much more gradual in their decline. A suffix ‘a’ indicates a fall of three magnitudes in less than 100 days; ‘b’, three magnitudes in 100 to 150 days; ‘c’, three magnitudes in over 150 days. A list of naked-eye novæ seen since 1600 is given in Table 22.5. The brightest nova, V603 Aquilæ of 1918, briefly outshone every star in the sky apart from Sirius. A nova is a binary system, made up of a low-density red star with a white dwarf companion. The white dwarf pulls material away from the giant star, and this material builds up into an accretion disk round the white dwarf. Over long periods of time more and more material collects; it is hydrogen-rich and at a high temperature, and the very strong surface gravity of the white dwarf generates tremendous pressures. Eventually the situation becomes unstable, and a runaway nuclear reaction begins, hurling material into space at speeds up to to 1500 km s − 1 .

The mass of the ejected material is no more than 1 / 1000 of a solar mass. The spectra of novæ show absorption lines which are blue-shifted, indicating that gas thrown off during the outburst is moving towards us. At the peak of the outburst, a nova may be highly luminous. Nova Puppis 1942 sent out as much radiation as 1600 000 Suns. Compared with this, the fluctuations of variable stars such as Mira seem very minor. Insomecasesanoldnovamaybeseentobesurrounded by a gas cloud. GK Persei 1901 is a case in point. Some months after maximum it was found that nebulosity was appearing to one side of the star, and to be expanding at the speed of light. This was clearly unacceptable; in fact the nova lay in a dark nebula, and the radiation spreading out from the outburst illuminated more and more of the nebula each year. The even brighter nova V.603 Aquilæ developed a tiny surrounding disk, which grew steadily in size and became fainter; by 1941 it had become too dim to be followed further. Many old novæ are now seen as eclipsing binaries; such is DQ Herculis 1934, which has a period of 4h 39m. The least luminous ‘old nova’ is CK Vulpeculæ of 1670, which is 2000 light-years away and has only 1 / 100 the luminosity of the Sun. (See Table 22.5.) Some stars have been known to undergo more than one outburst; these are the recurrent novæ (see Table 22.6). The best known of these is the ‘Blaze Star’, T Coronæ Borealis. Usually it is of around magnitude 10, but in 1866 it flared up briefly to magnitude 2; it was then regarded as a normal nova, but in 1946 it flared up again, this time to magnitude 3. Several recurrent novæ are now under observation. Faint novæ are by no means uncommon, and many of these are discovered by amateurs. Ten naked-eye novæ have appeared since 1970; one of these, V.382 Velorum of 1999, reached magnitude 2.5. It was discovered on 22 May by Alan Gilmore in New Zealand, and independently by Peter Williams in Australia; it was too far south in the sky to be seen from Europe. At its peak it shone 75 000 times more brightly than the Sun; the distance is believed to be 2600 light-years, and before the outburst its magnitude was below 16.

Over the ages, the white dwarf had drained material from its companion, so that the companion is now small and exceptionally cool – surface temperature about 1450 ◦ C. It may eventually end up as an unique type of stellar end-product. Dwarf novæ . These are usually termed U Geminorum stars, although much the brightest member of the class is SS Cygni. They show minor outbursts at roughly regular intervals. Of the two components, one is a K or M type dwarf and the other is a white dwarf. The amplitude is of the order of from 2 to 9 magnitudes (usually less), and the interval between successive outbursts may be from 10 days to several years – 103 days for U Geminorum (magnitude 14.9 to 8.2), 50 days for SS Cygni (12.4 to 8.2). The basic cause of the outbursts is the same as for true novæ, but on a much reduced scale. SU Ursæ Majoris stars have both normal maxima and occasional ‘supermaxima’ of greater amplitude, while Z Camelopardalis stars show outbursts of from 2 to 5 magnitudes every 10 to 40 days, but with unpredictable ‘standstills’ when variations are temporarily suspended. Z Andromedæ stars or symbiotic variables are close binaries, where the hot companion actually orbits within the envelope of its cool red giant companion; the variations are caused by pulsations in the red star together with interactions between the two, so that the light curves are decidedly complicated. RR Telescopii stars show slow increases which may be of very long duration. Polars , or AM Herculis stars, show sudden outbursts of up to three magnitudes, caused by the accretion of material on to the magnetic poles of a compact star; the light is strongly polarized – hence the name. X-ray novæ . An X-ray nova is a binary system in which there are sudden outbursts at X-ray wavelengths. Around 200 X-ray binaries are known in our Galaxy, and of these about one-third have been seen to suffer outbursts. They are of two main classes: (a) High mass; a hot blue star (type O or B0) together with a neutron star. There are more or less regular periodic outbursts. (b) Low mass; a cool red star (M or K type) with a compact object which may be either a neutron star or a black hole. The outbursts are unpredictable. The strong gravitational pull of the compact member of the pair collects material from its companion to form an accretion disk; material is then sucked down on to the surface of the compact member, and an outburst occurs when there is a sudden increase in the amount of material striking the compact object. X-rays are emitted, but optical and radio outbursts can also be detected. The term ‘X-ray nova’ is rather misleading; ‘X-ray variable’ would have been better. S upernovæ Supernovæ are among the most colossal outbursts known in nature. Many have been seen in external galaxies – over 700 since 1885 – but the last supernova to be seen in our Galaxy was observed as long ago as 1604, before the invention of the telescope. It has been estimated that a typical galaxy should produce one supernova every 25 to 100 years, but some of these will be concealed by interstellar dust. Types . Supernovæ are of two definite types. With type Ia, we are dealing with a binary system, in which one component (A) is initially more massive than its companion (B), and therefore evolves more quickly into the red giant stage. Material from it is pulled across to B, so that B grows in mass while A declines; eventually B becomes the more massive of the two. Meanwhile, A is reduced to a very small, dense core, made up chiefly of carbon. The situation is then reversed; B evolves in its turn, swells out, and starts to lose material back to the shrunken A, which is now a white dwarf. The white dwarf builds up a gaseous layer. When the mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit (about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun) the carbon detonates, and in a matter of a few seconds the white dwarf is completely destroyed. The resulting outburst 294 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"V ARIABLE S TARS takes some time to die down. When the carbon white dwarf explodes, it creates other elements, including neon, oxygen and silicon, ending up as nickel. Nickel decays to cobalt and then to iron, so that these elements can be detected spectroscopically; there are no lines due to hydrogen. At its peak, a type Ia supernova can reach an absolute magnitude of − 19, or around 4000 million times the luminosity of the Sun. Some type I supernovæ may be due to collapsing single stars. These are classed as of type Ib and Ic, to distinguish them from the type Ia supernovæ described above. A type II supernova is due to the collapse of a very mas- sive star, at least five times as massive as the Sun, which has used up its nuclear fuel and has produced a nickel–iron core with a mass about 1.5 times that of the Sun. The structure of the star just prior to the outburst has been likened to that of an onion. Outside the core there is a zone of silicon and sulphur; next comes a layer of neon and magnesium; then a layer of carbon, neon and oxygen; then a layer of helium; and finally an outer layer of hydrogen. Eventually the core can no longer support the weight of the outer layers, and collapses to form a neutron star of very great density (you could pack over 2500 million tons of neutron star material into a matchbox). Vast numbers of neutrinos are produced, most of which pass straight through the star into space. When the collapsing layers hit the unyielding neutron star, they ‘bounce’, and a shock-wave moves outwards, colliding with the material which is still falling inwards. The result is a catastrophic explosion, and most of the star is blown away into space, leaving only the core – which may be a neutron star or, in extreme cases, a black hole. The peak luminosity is not so great as with a type Ia supernova, but the absolute magnitude may reach − 17, which is more than 500 million times as luminous as the Sun. Type Ia supernovæ may occur anywhere, but type II seem to be confined to the spiral arms of galaxies. The light curves differ markedly. A type I shows a steep rise, early fading and then a long, slow decline. With a type II there is also a steep rise and an early decline, after which the brightness falls off more sharply until settling down to a gradual decline. Supernova remnants (SNR) may be found as patches of gas, sometimes containing pulsars; they emit radiation over a wide range, from radio waves to gamma- rays; and many of them are very strong radio sources. Galactic supernovæ . Observable supernova remnants show that there have been a number of outbursts in our Galaxy over the past few tens of thousands of years. One of these is the Cygnus Loop; the lovely Veil Nebula forms one section of the circular structure. The distance is thought to be about 1400 light-years, and the age 5000 years. The Vela SNR, in the southern Gum Nebula, is about 11 000 years old, and contains one of the few pulsars to have been optically identified with a very faint object, flashing at the same rate as the pulsar and certainly identical with it. In historic times, eight galactic supernovæ have been reported. These are listed in Table 22.7. 185 December . Discovered 7 December, near α and β Centauri; Chinese sources. The optical object RCW86 (G.315-4-2.3) is an X-ray emitter. However, it has recently been suggested that there may have been an error, so that the position was near α and ξ Centauri and the object was a comet. 386 . Chinese sources. Several radio sources lie in this area, near λ Sagittarii. Probably a supernova. 1006 3 April (discovery). This was certainly the brightest known galactic supernova, and may have been as brilliant as the quarter-moon, but it is not well documented. 1054 July . Chinese, Japanese and Korean sources. It was seen for 23 days in daylight over 22 months in all. This is the Crab Nebula progenitor, and is what is termed a plerion , filling the whole area which it occupies rather than producing a shell. It radiates over the whole of the electromagnetic spectrum. The pulsar, NP 0532, has a periodof0.333s, andisidentifiedwithadim, flashingobject which can reach magnitude 15. There are suggestions that the outburst may have been shown in some American Indian cave paintings, but the evidence for this is not conclusive. The nebula is officially catalogued as M.1; the ‘Crab’ nickname was bestowed on it by the Earl of Rosse, who drew it with the great Birr Castle reflector. 1181 August .

Like Tycho’s Star, this was probably a type I, so that the remnant is a dim gas cloud with no pulsar. There must have been a supernova in Cassiopeia around 1667, because we have here the radio source Cassiopei a A – actually the brightest X-ray emitter in the sky apart from the Sun. It was not observed, as it was too heavily obscured by interstellar dust near the main plane of the Galaxy. Extragalactic supernovæ . Supernovæ in outer galaxies are discovered regularly, often by amateurs (one Australian amateur, the Rev. Robert Evans, now has more than two dozen discoveries to his credit). Since their peak luminosities are probably about equal, they are invaluable as ‘standard candles’, and they can of course be seen over immense distances. On one occasion, in April 1991, two supernovæ flared up in the same galaxy, NGC 10-24-007 in Draco, within a month of each other. In 1885 what we now know to be a supernova was seen in M.31, the Andromeda Spiral, over 2000 000 light-years away. It reached the fringe of naked-eye visibility, but at the time its nature was not recognized. It is now catalogued as S Andromedæ, and on 4 November 1988 R. A. Feisen, using th e 4 m telescope at Kitt Peak in Arizona, identified its remnant. The iron-rich remains of the supernova showed up as a dark patch against the background. S Andromedæ was discovered on 20 August 1885 by Hartwig, at the Dorpat Observatory in Estonia, but there is an interesting aside here. On 22 August, the Hungarian Baroness de Podmaniczky was holding a house party, and for the entertainment of her guests had set up a small telescope on the lawn. Using this, she saw a ‘small star’ in M.31. Her observation was quite independent of Hartwig’s, though she certainly did not appreciate its importance! The most recent naked-eye supernova was 1987A, in the Large Cloud of Magellan, at a distance of 169 000 light- years. It was discovered on 24 February by Ian Shelton, at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, on a routine photograph he had taken, and almost at the same time by O. Duhalde, also at Las Campanas, with the naked eye. (It had been photographed earlier by R. McNaught, from Australia, but McNaught had not checked his observations.) When discovered it was of magnitude 4.5, but brightened to magnitude 2.3 before starting to fade. One surprise was that the progenitor star, Sanduleak − 69 ◦ 202, was identifiable, and was a blue giant rather than a red star; it was thought to be about 20 000 000 years old, with a mass from five to seven times that of the Sun. The peak luminosity was low by supernova standards: only about 250 000 000 times that of the Sun – because the progenitor star was smaller, though hotter, than a red supergiant. It seems that the progenitor was originally very hot and massive; as it used up its available hydrogen it went through the red supergiant stage, before shedding its outer layers and contracting. It was then, with the star a blue supergiant, that the outburst happened. Maximum brightness was reached in mid-May 1987, and then came the expected decline. Various phenomena 296 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"V ARIABLE S TARS were seen, including ‘light rings’ due to interstellar dust which was illuminated by the outburst. The supernova was observed at many wavelengths, including X-rays (by the Japanese satellite Ginga) and ultraviolet (by the IUE satellite). Neutrinos were also recorded. So far, no pulsar has been detected. In fact, a pulsar was reported on 18 January 1989 by astronomers at Cerro Tololo in Chile, led by J. Middleditch; it was claimed that the pulsar was rotating at a rate of 1968.63 turns per second. Various explanations were offered, but it was then found that the observed effects were due to the mechanism of the telescope. Whether a pulsar will eventually form remains to be seen. Paul Murdin has given 1 a very interesting time-scale, linking the evolution of the progenitor star with geological periods on Earth, It is as follows: Formation of the star . 20 000 000 years ago, during the Miocene period. Hydrogen burning continued for 15 000 000 years. Helium burning . End of the Pliocene period. Carbon burning . Pleistocene period; first men on Earth. Neon and oxygen burning . 1980; Mrs. Thatcher as British Prime Minister. Silicon burning . 1987 February 20. Explosion of the star . 1987 February 23, 17h 35m. Of course, all this actually happened 169 000 years ago! ... 1 1990 End in Fire (Cambridge University Press). I have adapted it slightly! H ypernovæ Can there be outbursts which will dwarf even supernovæ? Very recently it has been suggested that this may be the case. Violentoutburstsofgammaradiationhavebeentraced; these bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic events known, and they have never been satisfactorily explained. In 1997 Bohdan Paczynski, of Princeton University in the United States, proposed that they might be due to ‘hypernovæ’, which would outshine even the most energetic supernova by a factor of 100. Paczynski described a model in which a massive rotating star collapses into a black hole, leaving behind a disk of material which releases an incredible amount of energy. Another explanation involved a collision between two neutron stars. In 1999 astronomers at Northwestern University and the University of Illinois detected the first observational evidence of hypernova remnants; Daniel Wang, of Northwestern University, identified two hypernova remnants in the Pinwheel Galaxy, M.101, at a distance of 25 000 000 light- years. The remnants had previously been classed as the results of ordinary supernovæ, but Wang’s X-ray analyses indicated a far more energetic process. One remnant, MF83, has a diameter of 860 light-years; the other, NGC 5471B, is expanding at a rate of at least 60 km s − 1 . The actual existence of hypernovæ remains to be proved. We must await the results of further research. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 297"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"23 S TELLAR C LUSTERS Clusters and nebulæ are among the most striking of stellar objects. Several are easily visible with the naked eye. Few people can fail to recognize the lovely star cluster of the Pleiades or Seven Sisters, which has been known since prehistoric times and about which there are many old legends. The nebula in the Sword of Orion, the Sword- Handle in Perseus, Præsepe in Cancer and the Jewel Box cluster in Crux are other objects easily visible without optical aid. Keen-sighted people have little difficulty in locating the great Andromeda Spiral and the globular cluster in Hercules, while in the far south there are the two Clouds of Magallan, which cannot possibly be overlooked, as well as the bright globular clusters ω Centauri and 47 Tucanæ. The most famous of all catalogues of nebulous objects was compiled by the French astronomer Charles Messier, and published in 1781. Ironically, Messier was not interested in the objects he listed; he was a comet-hunter, and merely wanted a quick means of identifying misty patches which were non-cometary in nature. In 1888 J. L. E. Dreyer, Danish by birth (although he spent much of his life in Ireland, and finally in England) published his New General Catalogue (NGC), augmented in 1898 and again in 1908 by his Index Catalogue (I or IC). Messier’s original catalogue included 103 objects; later it was extended to 110, although not by Messier himself. However, Messier excluded many bright clusters and nebulæ, either because they could not be confused with comets, and were therefore of no interest to him, or because they were too far south in the sky to be seen from France. In 1995 I compiled the Caldwell Catalogue 1 , of 109 objects arranged in order of declination and omitted by Messier. This now seems to be widely used. The first-known clusters and nebulæ are listed in Table 23.1. There are many nicknames for astronomical objects; some of these are given in Table 23.2. 1 Obviously I could not use the letter M. However, my surname is actually a hyphenated one (Caldwell-Moore), so I used C. Table 23.1. The first known clusters and nebulæ. It seems that a few nebulous objects have been known since prehistoric times. This certainly applies to the Pleiades, which can hardly be overlooked. In his great work the Almagest, Ptolemy (circa 120–180 AD) records the Pleiades, and also the Sword-Handle in Perseus (NGC 869 and 884), M.44 (Præsepe) and, with almost certain identification, the open cluster M.7 in Scorpius; probably Ptolemy himself discovered the last of these. We may also assume that ancient men of the southern hemisphere knew the Magellanic Clouds, though they did not come to the notice of European astronomers until about 1520. From the year 1745 more and more objects were found, mainly by astronomers such as De Ch ́ eseaux, Legentil, Lacaille and, of course, the two great Frenchmen, Messier and M ́ echain. By 1781, when Messier published his Catalogue, 138 nebulous objectswereknown. ThelistinTable23.1includesalltheobjects found before 1745. This makes in all 21 objects. Many others had been previously listed, but subsequently found to be mere groups of stars rather than true clusters or nebulæ. One remarkable fact relates to the Great Spiral in Andromeda, which was recorded by the Persian astronomer Al-S ˆ ufi. It was not noted again until 1612, when Simon Marius described it. Amazingly, it was completely overlooked by the greatest observer of pre-telescopic times, Tycho Brahe.

O pen c lusters Open or loose clusters are aggregations of stars arranged in no particular shape; the Pleiades, Hyades and Præsepe are good examples. Some clusters are sparse, containing no more than 10 stars, while others may include at least 3000 stars. The diameter of an average cluster is of the order of 65 light-years, and in its richest part the distances between individual stars will be no more than a light-year. They are of various ages. The Pleiades are about 76 000 000 years old, but the lovely Jewel Box in the Southern Cross has an age of little more than 7000 000 years, and others are even younger, at around 1000 000 years. On the other hand, M.67, an open cluster in Cancer, has an age of 4000 million years. Interstellar space is never completely empty, but the density is very low indeed. Here and there, denser clouds of dust and gas form, and are very cold. When a cloud reaches a mean density a thousand times greater than that of ‘normal’ space, atoms combine into molecules, and we have a molecular cloud, which may be from 1 to 300 light- years across, containing enough material to produce at least 10 000 stars. If the mass of the cloud exceeds 100 000 times that of the Sun, it is classed as a giant molecular cloud (GMC). Clouds of this type are bitterly cold, at around − 263 ◦ C (only 10 ◦ above absolute zero), and as they are made up chiefly of hydrogen molecules (H 2 ) they are hard to detect optically; radio telescopes have to be used. However, in recent years the Hubble Space Telescope has been used to observe colour changes of background stars seen through the clouds, which leads on to information about the distribution of matter in the clouds themselves. Still denser clumps of material accumulate in the GMCs, and star formation follows; many stars may be 300 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"S TELLAR C LUSTERS produced from the same cloud, resulting in a stellar cluster. It is logical to assume that the stars in any particular cluster are of the same age, and of the same initial chemical composition, so that present differences between them are due to initial differences in mass. Drawing up an HR diagram of a cluster shows where there is a ‘turn-off’ from the Main Sequence to the giant branch, and this gives the age of the cluster. For example, the brightest stars in the Pleiades are blue and very hot, while the much older Hyades contain stars which have already evolved into red giants. In young open clusters there is still visible material which shows that star formation may still be going on. The nebulosity in the Pleiades is easy to detect, but nebulosity is totally absent from the Hyades, where all the star-forming material has been used up. Open clusters are not permanent structures; they are disrupted by passing ‘field’ stars, and will eventually disperse. The oldest open clusters, such as M.67, survive because they are well away from the main plane of the Galaxy and are not likely to encounter many non-cluster stars, while most of the open clusters are close to the galactic plane, so that encounters are frequent. The nearest cluster is that of Ursa Major, but the average distance of the cluster stars from us is only about 80 light-years, so that they are scattered round the sky; members include five of the stars of the famous Plough pattern in the Great Bear ( α and η being the exceptions); Sirius is also a member. The Hyades cluster comes next; new measurements by the Hubble Space Telescope give its distance as 151 light-years. The Coma cluster is 270 light-years away and a newly-discovered, much fainter cluster near η Chamæleontis lies at 315 light-years. The η Chamæleontis cluster is only 2 light-years across, and as seen from Earth its component stars are of between magnitudes 10 and 14, so that it is not surprising that the cluster was overlooked until recently. A selected list of bright open clusters is given in Table 23.5(page306). Manyofthesearenaked-eyeobjects, and all in the list are easily seen with binoculars. Fainter clusters are plentiful, and there may be some 20 000 of them in our Galaxy. Of course, open clusters are also seen in external galaxies. The most famous of all open clusters is that of the Pleiades (M.45), in Taurus. The brightest star is η Tauri, Alcyone (magnitude 2.9); then follow Atlas (3.6), Electra (3.7), Maia (3.9), Merope (4.2), Taygete (4.3), Pleione (5.1, but variable), Celæno (5.4) and Asterope (5.6). The cluster is always known as the Seven Sisters, and certainly people with average eyesight can see seven individual stars on a clear night; Asterope is on the fringe of naked-eye visibility, while Pleione and Atlas are so close together that binoculars are needed to separate them easily. It is said that the 19th century German astronomer E. Heis could see 19 stars in the cluster without optical aid; many people can manage a dozen. The total membership of the cluster is around 500 stars, contained in an area 50 light-years across, and embedded in nebulosity which shines by reflected light from the stars within. The distance is 375 light-years, rather less than was believed before new measurements were made with the Hubble Space Telescope. Several brown dwarfs have been identified in the Pleiades. The 19th century German astronomer J. H. M ̈ adler, renowned for his studies of the Moon, believed Alcyone to be the central star of the Galaxy; it is not clear how he arrived at this conclusion, which is quite erroneous. TheHyades, alsoinTaurus, aredifferent; theywerenot listed either by Messier or Dreyer. They are numbered 41 in the Caldwell catalogue and 25 in the catalogue by Melotte. The area is dominated by Aldebaran, but in fact Aldebaran is not a cluster member; at 68 light-years it lies roughly midway between the Hyades and ourselves. The main stars of the Hyades are arranged in a V-shape. \u001e (3.5) and γ (3.6) are orange stars of type K, an there are some interesting pairs; δ (3.8) makes a pair with 64 Tauri (4.8), and θ is a naked-eye double, made up of a white star of magnitude 3.4 and a K-type orange companion of magnitude 3.8. The two are not particularly close, as the distance between them is 15 light-years, although of course both condensed out of the same cloud which produced the rest of the Hyades. The proper motions of the Hyades stars show that they are convergingtoapointeastofBetelgeux, atRA6hdeclination 9 ◦ N, so that in the far future the cluster will look more condensed than it does now. Præsepe in Cancer (M.44) is also prominent with the naked eye; it was well known to the ancient Greeks, and Hipparchus called it a ‘cloudy star’. Bayer even gave it a THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 301"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"S TELLAR C LUSTERS Greek letter ( \u001e Cancri). It is over 500 light-years away, and there have been suggestions that it may once have had close associations with the Hyades. In Perseus we find the Sword- Handle (NGC 869 and 884) (C.14); two rich open clusters in the same telescopic field, with a red star between them – a magnificent sight. In the far south there is the Jewel Box, NGC 5139 (C.80) round κ Crucis in the Southern Cross; the brightest stars are blue, but there is one prominent red giant, providing a beautiful colour contrast. G lobular c lusters Globular clusters are quite different from open clusters. They are vast symmetrical systems, containing from 10 000 to at least a million stars, and so strongly condensed that near their centres the individual stars may be only light- months apart. An average globular cluster has a diameter of 65 light-years, but there is a wide range in both size and mass. About 200 globular clusters are known in our Galaxy, but other galaxies have their own systems of clusters. Our Galaxy is a flattened system, and is rotating round itscentre; theSuntakesabout225 000 000yearstocomplete one orbit, and lies not far from the main plane. The globular clusters, on the other hand, are members of what is termed the galactic halo, which is roughly spherical and extends out to several hundreds of thousands of light-years. The globulars move in highly eccentric orbits which take them far outside the main Galaxy, and they do not share in the disk rotation; this means that their velocities relative to the Sun may be very high (up to 100 km s − 1 ). One globular, NGC 2419 (C.25), in Lynx, seems to be escaping from the Galaxy altogether, and has been called an Intergalactic Tramp! Globular clusters are very ancient, and are indeed as old as the Galaxy itself. They are very poor in heavy elements, since they were formed from primitive material, whereas the open clusters were formed from ‘recycled’ material. The globulars are much more stable than the open clusters, and though they are subjected to disruptive forces (such as tidal effects from the parent Galaxy) they are very long-lived. Huge though they are, most globulars are so remote that they appear faint, and not many are visible with the naked-eye. They contain short-period variables (RR Lyræ stars) which enables their distances to be measured. This was first done in 1917 by Harlow Shapley, who also realized that most of the globulars lie in the southern sky; there is a heavy concentration in the area of Scorpius, Ophiuchus and Sagittarius. From this Shapley deduced, quite correctly, that we are having a lop-sided view, because the Sun is well away from the centre of the Galaxy. The two brightest globulars, ω Centauri and 47 Tucanæ, lie in the far south of the sky. ω Centauri (C.80) was recorded by Ptolemy as a star; Bayer gave it a Greek letter, but it was Edmond Halley who first recognized its true nature. Even at a range of 16 000 light-years it is a very prominent naked-eye object, and a small telescope will resolve its outer parts into stars, although near its centre the star density is very high. It is much the largest and most massive of the Galaxy’s globular clusters, and its mass, 5000 000 times that of the Sun, is as great as that of a dwarf galaxy. Also in the far south is NGC 104 (C.107), 47 Tucanæ, which is almost silhouetted against the Small Cloud of Magellan, although the two are in no way associated; the Cloud is an independent galaxy, over 170 000 light-years away, while the distance of 47 Tucanæ is a mere 15 000 light-years. It contains about 2000 000 stars, in a system around 200 light-years across. In the northern hemisphere, the brightest globular cluster is M.13 in Hercules, discovered by Halley in 1714. It is just visible with the naked eye, between the stars η and ζ Herculis. The distance is 22 500 light-years, and the diameter has been given as about 100 light-years. Because globular clusters are so old, their leading stars are highly-evolved red giants. There are, however, some stars which are hot and blue. A ‘blue straggler’ of this kind seems to be a rejuvenated star – either the result of a stellar collision, or the merger of the two components of a binary pair. 47 Tucanæ is particularly rich in blue stragglers. The view from a planet orbiting a star near the centre of a globular cluster would indeed be fascinating. There would be many stars bright enough to cast shadows, and many of these would be red; there would be no darkness at night. Against this, an observer on such a world would have a very restricted view of the outer universe. 302 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"S TELLAR C LUSTERS Table 23.3. The Messier Catalogue. Messier’s original catalogue ends with M.103. The later numbers are objects which, apart from the last, were discovered by M ́ echain. (M.110 may have been discovered by Messier himself, but it is still always known as NGC 205, one of the companions to the Great Spiral in Andromeda.) M.104 was added to the Messier catalogue by Camille Flammarion in 1921, on the basis of finding a handwritten note about it in Messier’s own copy of his 1781 catalogue. M.105 to 107 were listed by H. S. Hogg in the 1947 edition of the catalogue; M.108 and 109 by Owen Gingerich in 1960. The naming of NGC 205 as M.110 was proposed by K. G. Jones in 1968, but has never been accepted. RA Dec.

They were so-called by Sir William Herschel, because their pale, often greenish disks made them look superficially like the planets Uranus and Neptune when seen through a telescope, but they are not true nebulæ and have nothing whatsoever to do with planets. A planetary nebula is in fact a very late stage in the evolution of a star up to eight times the mass of the Sun (stars which are more massive than this explode as supernovæ). At the end of the Main Sequence stage, the core contracts and the outer layers expand and cool; the star becomes a red giant. Eventually the outer layers are ejected, and move away into space at a speed of around 10 to 30 km s − 1 from what is left of the star – which is now very hot, with a surface temperature of from 20 000 to as much as 100 000 ◦ C; it is in the process of turning into a white dwarf. Ultra- violet radiation from the star ionizes the ejected material and makes it glow; the result is a planetary nebula. The common greenish tint is due to emissions from doubly ionized oxygen. Planetary nebulæ are transient. They cannot persist, as such, for more than about 50 000 years before the material dissipates and becomes too dim to be seen, while the ‘pre- planetary’ stage, before the nebula itself is produced, is even briefer – perhaps no more than 1000 years. This is why planetary nebulæ seem to be uncommon. About a thousand are known in our Galaxy; doubtless there are many more which have not been observed, but they do not last for long. One case of development into a planetary nebula is Henize 1357, in Ara; it is 17 000 light-years away, and has now assumed the characteristic form of a planetary. Although the central star may have started to expel gas a few thousands of years ago, only very recently has there been enough radiation from the star to make the gas glow. The best-known planetary is the Ring Nebula in Lyra, M.57, which is easy to locate because it lies midway between the stars β and γ Lyræ; a small telescope shows it as a tiny, shining ring, and a larger instrument will show the central star. The ejected material takes the form of a sphere, but we see from long range (about 1400 light-years) and the eye observes more material at the periphery than at the centre – hence the appearance of a luminous ring; at the centre we can see ‘straight through’. The material is indeed tenuous. If you take the amount of gas in an average village hall and spread it out over an area equivalent to the volume of the Earth, the resulting density will be about the same as that of the gas in a planetary nebula. The Ring Nebula looks fairly symmetrical, but other planetaries assume bizarre forms; the Helix, the Hourglass, the Egg Nebula and the complex Cat’s Eye Nebula are good examples. Often, too, a shell of material ejected by a fast stellar wind will catch up with, and collide with, a shell ejected much earlier at a slower rate. Most planetaries are fairly remote; the Helix Nebula in Aquarius (NGC 7293, C.63) is the closest, at 450 light-years, and with a magnitude of 6.5 it is also the brightest. The Hourglass Nebula, MyCn18, is 8000 light- years from us, and has been beautifully imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope. The gas coming from the poles is less dense than that coming from the equator, and moves faster, which results in the characteristic hourglass shape. Another remarkable object, also imaged by Hubble, is the protoplanetary Egg Nebula (CRL 2688), 3000 light-years away and 0.6 of a light-year across; the central star is shrouded in a cocoon of dust. The star was a red giant only a few centuries ago, and is now in the process of becoming a white dwarf. One very interesting object, imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, is OH231 . 8 + 4 . 2 which is a remarkable example of a star which is in the process of changing from a normal red giant star into a planetary nebula. Infra-red pictures with the HST show dust and gas being blown out in opposite directions at up to 700 000 km h − 1 . Radio observations indicate many unusual molecules of gas surrounding the star, including sulphur compounds such as hydrogen sulphide and sulphur dioxide. This is why the object has been nicknamed the Rotten Egg Nebula! THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 307"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"N EBULÆ Planetary nebulæ are not unique to our Galaxy. In 1991 a planetary, N.66, was detected in the Large Cloud of Magellan; it is almost two light-years in diameter. D iffuse n ebulæ Diffuse nebulæ, otherwise termed galactic or gaseous nebulæ, are among the most beautiful objects in the sky. Photographs taken with large ground-based telescopes, as well as with the Hubble Space Telescope, bring out their vivid colours and their bizarre forms, and even when observed visually with a small telescope they are fascinating. Nebulæ are of three main types: (1) Emission nebulæ, where the material is illuminated by short-wave radiation from very hot stars of types O and B and emits a certain amount of light on its own account. The ultra-violet radiation ionizes the hydrogen in the nebulosity and makes it glow, so that these nebulæ are also termed H.II regions. (2) Reflection nebulæ, which shine only by light reflected from stars either in or very close to the nebulosity. The light is reflected from particles of dust. (3) Absorption or dark nebulæ, where there are no suitable stars in the vicinity, and the nebula remains dark, showing up only because the dust that it contains blots out the light of stars beyond. The most famous dark nebula is the Coal Sack in the Southern Cross (C.90). Thereisnobasicdifferencebetweenabrightandadark nebula; for all we know there may be stars illuminating the far side of the Coal Sack, so that if we could observe it from a different vantage point in space it would appear bright. Catalogues also include other types of objects which are of a different nature. For example, there are supernova remnants such as the Crab Nebula and the Cygnus Loop. There are planetary nebulæ, which, as we have noted, are highly-evolved stars which have cast off their outer layers. Finally, there are the objects once termed spiral nebulæ, which we now know to be external galaxies; the term ‘spiral nebula’ is misleading, and has now gone out of use, to be replaced by ‘spiral galaxy’. (Of course, by no means all galaxies are spirals.) True nebulæ are stellar birthplaces. When formed they are made up chiefly of hydrogen, with some helium and only trace amounts of other elements, which is why first generation stars are ‘metal-poor’ (remember that ‘metal’, confusingly, is used to embrace all elements heavier than helium). The young clouds also contain small quantities of the light element lithium. When a star begins to shine by nuclear reactions the lithium is destroyed – so that if a star shows traces of lithium in its spectrum, we know that it is not yet old enough to have started radiating by nuclear fusion. The most famous of all diffuse nebulæ is M.42, in the Sword of Orion, which is easily visible with the naked eye. In fact, it is only the most prominent part of a Giant Molecular Cloud which covers almost the whole of Orion; it is 1600 light-years away, and has been intensively studied. The material in it is almost incredibly rarefied, and it has been said that if you could tak ea3cm core sample right through it, the total weight of material collected would just about balance a pound coin – even though the nebula is 16 light-years in diameter (twice the distance between our Sun and Sirius). Inside a nebula of this sort, star formation begins with the development of a rather denser area – perhaps because of the shock-wave from a supernova or by a ‘compressional wave’ sweeping through the material. Protostars are formed, usually shrouded by an envelope of opaque material and are detectable only at infra-red and millimetre wavelengths. We find Bok globules and also what are called Herbig–Haro objects (from their co- discoverers, G. Herbig of the United States and G. Haro of Mexico), formed when jets sent out from very young stars strike material which is already present and compress it.

Classical T Tauri stars are from 1 to 10 million years old, and vary irregularly, because they are still unstable and have yet to join the Main Sequence. They send out violent ‘stellar winds’ and are usually accompanied by thick disks of material (proplyds: pro to- pl anetar yd isk s ), many of which have been found inside the Orion Nebula. Most stars seem to go through a T Tauri stage, when the stellar winds blow much of the remaining d ́ ebris out of the system.

As we have seen, a star which has a mass of less than 8% that of the Sun (equivalent to 80 times the mass of Jupiter) will never reach the Main Sequence at all, and will shine feebly as a brown dwarf. T Tauri stars are characterized by strong emission lines in their spectra, produced by interactions between the star and its disk. Once the disk dissipates, these lines vanish, but ‘weak-lined’ T Tauri stars produce X-rays in the hot plasma trapped in the magnetic fields above the surface of the star, and these X-rays are very evident in observations from satellites such as the recent Chandra and Newton. It may well be that in many cases the disk material collects into planetesimals, which in turn collide and produce true planets. The Orion Nebula shines because of the very hot, mas- sive stars making up the Trapezium, θ Orionis – which can be seen well with a small telescope. However, the dust means that we cannot see into the heart of the Nebula, where there are stars which will never become visible to us at op- tical wavelengths because their lifetimes will be too short for them to ‘burn’ a passage into outer space. Such is the Becklin–Neugebauer (BN) Object, deep inside the Nebula, which is a very young, immensely powerful star which we can detect only because of its infra-red radiation. A selected list of other well known diffuse nebulæ is given in Table 24.1. Proplyds have been detected inside the Lagoon Nebula, which is much larger than M.42 but is also much further away. The Eagle Nebula, M.16 in Serpens, is truly magnificent; a photograph taken from the Hubble Space Telescope shows three columns of gas and dust, each 1 to 3 light-years long, inside which stars are forming. Near the tops of the pillars, the radiation from the fledgling stars is evaporating the gas, so that it will eventually be dissipated; these structures are known as evaporating gaseous globules (EGGs). Then the star-forming material in a nebula is exhausted, all that is left is an open star cluster. Another interesting nebula is the North America Nebula NGC 7000 (C.10). Its shape really does recall the outline of the North American continent, and there is darker material in the position of the ‘Gulf of Mexico’! Many dark rifts are seen in the Milky Way, notably in the region of Cygnus, and also in other nebulæ, notably the Trifid Nebula in Sagittarius (M.20).

The system is often referred to as the Milky Way galaxy, but nowadays the term ‘Milky Way’ is usually restricted to the luminous band stretching across the sky. It was Galileo, in 1610, who first realized that the Milky Way is made up of stars; it must have been known since antiquity, and almost all early civilizations have legends about it. The Galaxy is flattened. There is a main disk, around 100 000light-yearsindiameter(someauthoritiesregardthis as a slight overestimate); the disk is 2000 light-years thick. There is a nearly spherical central bulge with a diameter of about 15 000 light-years. Surrounding the main system is the galactic halo, which may have a diameter of at least 100 kpc 1 , and contains isolated stars as well as the globular clusters. The disk is rotating round the centre of the Galaxy, in the bulge; the Sun takes 225 000 000 years to complete one circuit. The halo objects move in very inclined orbits, and do not share in the disk rotation. The disk is made up chiefly of young objects (Population I), and star formation is still going on; the halo consists of older Population II objects, and the star-forming material has been used up. Within 1 parsec of the centre of the Galaxy the average distance between stars may be no more than 1000 a.u., so that there could be ten million stars per cubic parsec. Near the Sun, the density is only 0.2 of a star per cubic parsec, and in the halo the density is much lower still. As well as stars, the Galaxy contains a vast amount of thinly-spread interstellar matter. The first proof of this was obtainedbyW.Hartmannin1904, whenhewasstudyingthe spectrum of the star δ Orionis. δ Orionis is a spectroscopic binary, so that its lines show Doppler shifts corresponding to the orbital motions of the components. However, Hartmann found that some of the lines remained stationary, so that 1 When dealing with vast distances, parsecs are often used in preference to light-years. One parsec is the distance from which a star would show a par allax of 1 sec ond of arc (in fact there is no star within 1 parsec of the Sun). One parsec is equal to 3.26 light-years. One kiloparsec is equal to 1000 parsecs, and one megaparsec is equal to 1000 000 parsecs. clearly they were associated not with the star itself, but with material lying between δ Orionis and ourselves. Further proof was obtained by J. Tr ̈ umpler in 1930; some of the Milky Way clusters were reddened and appeared fainter than logically they ought to have done, so that they were being dimmed by intervening material. The gas between the stars is made up of hydrogen and helium, with smaller amounts of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and neon. In the 1930s astronomers at Mount Wilson found the first indications of interstellar molecules, but firm proof was postponed until 1963, when the hydroxyl radical, OH, was identified. In 1968 C. Townes and his colleagues at Berkeley detected interstellar ammonia (NH 3 ) at a wavelength of 1.26 cm. The first organic molecules (that is to say, molecules containing carbon) were identified in 1969 by L. Snyder, B. Buhl, B. Zuckerman and P. Palmer, who detected formaldehyde (H 2 CO). Many others have since been found, including carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide and methanoic acid. Ethyl alcohol (CH 3 CH 2 OH) has also been detected. One ‘cloud’ contains enough of it to fill the entire globe of the Earth with alcohol, or make 10 28 bottles of whisky. More molecules are being detected yearly. However, the average density of interstellar gas in our Galaxy is very low – about 500 000 hydrogen atoms per cubic metre, which corresponds to a very good laboratory vacuum. There are also dust grains, about 0 . 1 μ m (10 − 7 m) in radius, which are chiefly responsible for the reddening and dimming of distant objects and prevent us from seeing through to the galactic centre. Originally it was believed that the Sun lay in the centre of the Galaxy; this was assumed by Herschel, and also by the Dutch astronomer J. C. Kapteyn, who carried out a detailed investigation in the early part of the 20th century. However, in 1917 H. Shapley proved that this is not so. He realized that the globular clusters are not spreadsymmetricallyaroundthesky, butareconcentratedin the southern hemisphere; using short-period variable stars he measured the distances of the clusters, and established that the Sun lies well away from the centre, although very 310 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"T HE G ALAXY close to the main plane. This, of course, explains the Milky Way band; we are looking along the main plane of the Galaxy, and seeing many stars in much the same line of sight. The centre of the galaxy lies at RA 17h 45m, declination − 28 ◦ 66 \u0002 , in Sagittarius; the galactic pole is at RA 12h 51m.4, declination − 27 ◦ 07 \u0002 , in the star-poor region of Sculptor. Shapley gave the diameter of the Galaxy as 30 000 light-years, although this proved to be very much of an under-estimate. The Galaxy is a spiral system, classed officially as of type Sbc. This is no surprise; many galaxies are spiral in form, and are rotating round their nuclei, as was established by Shapley and confirmed in more detail by the Swedish astronomer B. Lindblad. The Sun lies in a segment of what is termed the Orion arm, which also includes the Orion Nebula; inward, towards the galactic centre, is the Sagittarius arm, while on the opposite side is the Perseus arm; also recognized are the Centaurus and Cygnus arms. It is now believed that individual spiral arms are not permanent features. ‘Density waves’ sweep around the Galaxy, andproducewhatmaybecalledcosmictrafficjams, compressing the material and triggering off star formation. Very luminous O and B stars develop, but do not shine as such for long enough to leave the spiral arms, so that these O–B associations characterize the arms. In the future our Galaxy will still have spiral arms – but they will not be the same as those of the present time. We cannot see through to the centre of the Galaxy, because there is too much obscuring material in the way, but we know that it lies at a distance of about 27 000 light-years, beyond the star clouds in Sagittarius. Our knowledge of it is drawn from infra-red and radio observations, since the dust cannot block radiations at these wavelengths. For example, in 1997 two huge star clusters less than 100 light-years from the centre were identified by the NICMOS 2 camera on the Hubble Space Telescope. These clusters are known as the Arches and Quintuplet clusters, and are 10 times the size of the typical open clusters spread through the Galaxy. The Arches cluster, thought to be around two million years old, is so packed that a region of space equivalent to a sphere bounded by the Sun and α Centauri would contain 100 000 2 NICMOS: N ear I nfrared C amera and M ultipr o be S pectrometer. stars; the Quintuplet cluster, rather more dispersed, seems to be around four million years old. It contains what has become known as the Pistol Star, which may be the most luminous star in the Galaxy – at least 10 000 000 times more powerful than the Sun, and emitting as much energy in six seconds as the Sun does in a year. Its nickname comes from the bright nebula associated with it, which does look a little like the shape of a pistol, and may have been formed from the star no more than 6000 years ago. Within a million years or so the Pistol Star is likely to explode as a supernova. It must, however, be remembered that we can never have a direct optical view of it, and it is always possible that we are dealing with a closely-packed group of stars rather than a single giant sun. Round the galactic centre is what is termed the circum- nuclear disk (CND), a torus of warm atomic molecular gas and dust. It is rotating, and extends from about 1.5 to 8 parsecs from the centre. It may well be that the actual centre is marked by a strong radio source, Sagittarius A, which has two components: Sgr A East (probably an expanding gas-bubble due to a former supernova) and Sgr A West, which contains a compact source, Sgr A −∗ (pronounced Sagittarius A-star) which could consist of a massive black hole at least 2 000 000 times as massive as the Sun, surrounded by an accretion disk. Whether or not Sgr A −∗ marks the true centre, it is certain that the whole region is the site of violent activity. We also know that the Galaxy contains a great deal of material which we cannot detect in any way. This is shown by the manner in which the disk system rotates. Almost all the visible matter in the Galaxy is contained within a radius of no more than 15 kiloparsecs from the centre, and it would be expected that the rotational speeds of objects would lessen with increased distance from the centre, as happens in the Solar System (Kepler’s Laws). Thus a star, say 40 000 light-years from the centre would be expected to have a rotational speed less than that of the Sun, at 27 000 light-years. Yet this does not happen; the rotational velocities do not become less, but may even increase. This proves that the main mass of the Galaxy is not contained in the innermost region (in the Solar System, over 99% of the total mass is concentrated in the Sun). The same is true of other galaxies, and we are faced with what was once called THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 311"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"T HE G ALAXY the ‘missing mass’ problem, although it is now thought that there is a vast amount of undetectable ‘dark matter’. The Galaxy must be regarded as a large system, al- though it is in no way exceptional (it is not nearly so large or so massive as the Andromeda Spiral). Whether it can be classed as a ‘barred spiral’ is uncertain; at any rate the bar – if it exists at all – is not pronounced. It is one of a number of galaxies making up what we call the Local Group, of which the other senior members are the Andromeda and Triangulum spirals. 312 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"26 G ALAXIES Galaxies are external systems; many of them are much smaller than our Galaxy, while others are far larger and more populous. Many are included in Messier’s Catalogue, but their true nature was not then recognized. A major breakthrough came in 1845, when the third Earl of Rosse, using his remarkable home-made 72 inch reflector at Birr Castle in Ireland, found the first spiral – M.51 in the constellation of Canes Venatici, now generally called the Whirlpool. Other spirals were soon found, although for some years only the Birr telescope was capable of showing them as such; other ‘starry nebulæ’ were spherical in form, so that superficially they looked very like globular clusters, while others were elliptical, and some irregular in outline. The first proof that the resolvable ‘nebulæ’ are external systems came in 1923, when Edwin Hubble detected Cepheid variables in some of the spirals (including M.31 in Andromeda). He could therefore find their distances, which also gave the distances of the systems in which the Cepheids lay; at once it became clear that they were so far away that they could not possibly belong to the Milky Way. This idea was not new. It had been suggested as early as 1755 by Immanuel Kant, and had at one time been supported by William Herschel, but it had remained very much of an open question, and was the subject of a great debate in 1920 between two leading American astronomers, Harlow Shapley and Heber D. Curtis. By studying short- period variables in globular clusters, Shapley had given the first reasonable estimate of the size of the Milky Way system, but he regarded the spirals as being contained in our Galaxy, while Curtis believed them to be external. Hubble’s work, carried out with the Hooker reflector at Mount Wilson (then the only telescope in the world of sufficient power) proved that Curtis had been right. The distance of the Andromeda Spiral was given as 900 000 light-years, which was subsequently reduced to 750 000 light-years. This was later found to be an under-estimate. In 1952 W. Baade, using the new Hale reflector at Palomar, realized that there had been a major error in the Cepheid scale. There are two types of Cepheids, one more luminous than the other, and those in the spirals had been wrongly identified; they were more powerful than had been believed, and hence more remote. The distance of the Andromeda Spiral is now known to be 2200 000 light-years 1 , and is the most remote object which is clearly visible with the naked-eye (very keen-sighted observers can make out the Triangulum Spiral, M.33, but most people will need binoculars to identify it). The only two external systems brighter than these two spirals are the far-southern and much nearer Magellanic Clouds. In 1925 Hubble drew up a simple system of classifying galaxies by their shapes, and his ‘tuning fork’ diagram is still used, even though more complex classifications have been proposed. Hubble’s classes are as follows: Spirals , resembling Catherine wheels. Sa: conspicu- ous, often tightly-wound arms issuing from a well-defined nucleus. Sb: arms looser, nucleus less condensed. Sc: inconspicuous nucleus, loose arms. Barred spirals , in which the spiral arms issue from the ends of a kind of ‘bar’ through the nucleus. They are divided into types SBa, SBb and SBc in the same way as for the normal spirals. Elliptical systems , with no sign of spirality; they range from E7 (highly flattened) down to E0 (virtually spherical, looking rather like globular clusters). Many ellipticals are dwarf systems (dE), but there are also giant elliptical galaxies, such as the immense M.87. Irregular systems , with no definite shape. It is thought that about 30% of galaxies are spiral, 60% elliptical and 10% irregular, though these values are very approximate. Active galaxies are galaxies with unusual character- istics. Most active galaxies contain a compact, brilliant and often variable central core, known as an active galactic 1 Very recent results indicate that even this may be an understatement; if so, the distances of other Local Group galaxies may also have to be revised.

Whereas most of the energy radiated by an ordinary galaxy is starlight (the combined output of its constituent stars), an active galaxy radiates strongly over a much wider range of wavelengths; much of this radiation is emitted by energetic charged particles moving in magnetic fields. There are many types of active galaxies. For exam- ple, radio galaxies may send out a thousand to a million times more energy at radio wavelengths than is the case for a normal galaxy. Many radio galaxies are giant elliptical systems; there are vast clouds of radio-emitting material to either side of the visible system. Starburst galaxies are highly disturbed systems in which star formation is pro- ceeding at a furious rate. Seyfert galaxies , first identified by the American astronomer Carl Seyfert in 1943, have bright, variable nuclei and weak spiral arms; they are very energetic, particularly at infra-red and radio wavelengths; the luminosity of the core may equal the total luminos- ity of a galaxy such as our own. It may well be that the centre of a Seyfert galaxy may be occupied by a super- massive black hole. Quasars and BL Lacertæ objects are immensely luminous, and are now known to be the cores of very active galaxies, probably powered by central black holes. The word ‘quasar’ is an abbreviation of ‘quasi-stellar radio source’, since it was originally thought that all mem- bers of the class were strong radio emitters. In fact this is not the case, and the term QSO or quasi-stellar object is now widely used. Violently active systems are often termed ‘blazars’. The first quasar to be identified was 3C-273, in Virgo. (The prefix 3C indicates the third Cambridge catalogue of radio sources, published in 1962.) 3C-273 was known to be a strong radio emitter, but identifying it with a visual object proved to be difficult. However, on 5 August 1962 radio as- tronomers in Australia, working with the Parkes telescope, followed an occultation of the radio source by the Moon, and were able to pinpoint its position very accurately. From this, the source was identified with what seemed to be a faint bluish star of magnitude of 12.8. In 1963 M. Schmidt, at Palomar, obtained an optical spectrum, and found that the object was not a star at all; its spectrum was quite differ- ent, and showed lines which could not at first be identified. They proved to be due to hydrogen, but were tremendously red-shifted, indicating a high recessional velocity and there- fore immense distance and luminosity. In fact, it is now known that the recessional velocity is 47 400 km s − 1 , and the distance is 2.2 thousand million light-years – yet even so, 3C-273 is one of the closest of the quasars, and the only one which is within the range of small telescopes. It is not hard to locate, but visually it looks exactly like an ordinary dim star. 314 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"G ALAXIES Other quasars were soon found. Their luminosities rangefrom10to10 000timesthatofanormalgalaxysuchas our own, and they vary in luminosity over short periods, so that most of their radiation must come from a small region, only about one light-week (or 1200 a.u.) in diameter. Again the best explanation is that the power comes from a central, very massive black hole. All quasars are very remote, so that we see them as they used to be when the universe was comparatively young; it may well be that a quasar is simply one stage in the evolution of a massive galaxy. The distances of quasars are, of course, measured by the red shifts of their spectral lines. For example, consider the quasar PC 1247 + 3406, where z = 4 . 897 ( z is a measure of the red shift: z = (L − L 0 )/L 0 , where L 0 is the change in wavelength and L is the laboratory wavelength). The recessional velocity here is 94% of the velocity of light. One interesting development has been the detection of what are termed ‘gravitational lenses’. If a galaxy lies on or near the line of sight of a more remote quasar, the result will be that the quasar will show multiple images, simply because the intervening galaxy acts as a lens. The first instance of this, with the galaxy Q0956+561, was found in 1979, but many examples are now known – such as the ‘Clover Leaf’, H 1413 + 117, discovered from La Silla in 1988, where there are four images of the distant quasar. There is also the ‘Einstein ring’ found in 1985 by astronomers using the Canada–France–Hawaii telescope on Mauna Kea. They detected a giant luminous arc around the cluster of galaxies Abell 370; the arc is 500 000 light- years long and 25 000 light-years wide. The effect is due to the light from a background galaxy being bent in the gravitational field of the Abell 370 cluster; this sort of effect hadbeenpredictedbyAlbertEinstein–hencethenickname. However, one must be wary of jumping to conclusions. In 1987 a binary quasar was detected by S. Bjorgevski, G. Meylan, R. Perley and P. McCarthy. The binary quasar (QQ 1145-071) is at least 10 000 million light-years away. The spectra of the two images are not identical, so that we are dealing with two separate objects rather than a gravitational lens effect. There are, too, cases when a very remotebackgroundobjecthasbeendetectedonlybecauseof the ‘magnifying’ effect of a massive system lying in almost the same line of site 2 . The bending of light gathers most of the light of the distant object, causing it to appear brighter than it would do if the gravitational lens were not present. We also have to consider BL Lacertæ objects, which are related to quasars. The first to be studied was BL Lacertæ itself, which was noted in 1941 and taken for an ordinary variable star. In 1968 it was identified as a radio source (by Maarten Schmidt, at Palomar) and found to have a spectrum which was virtually featureless. Other similar objects, such as AP Libræ and W Comæ, were then found; they too had been taken for variable stars. In 1973 astronomers at Palomar found fuzzy ‘surrounds’ of the objects which did show spectral lines, and in 1976 J. Wampler, at the Lick Observatory, found lines in the spectrum of the BL Lac object 0548-322, so that he could measure the red shift and find the distance. Very probably BL Lacertæ objects and quasars are of the same nature, but with a quasar we are observing at a substantial angle to the jet, whereas with a BL Lacertæ object we are looking ‘straight down’ a jet, so that the jet appears as a bright spot overpowering the dim galaxy surrounding it. It was once believed that Hubble’s ‘tuning fork’ diagram had an evolutionary significance, so that spirals could develop into ellipticals or vice versa , but it now seems that the situation is much less straightforward than this, and it has to be admitted that our knowledge of the evolution of galaxies is still very incomplete; one fact about which we may be confident is that the quasar and BL Lacertæ stages are temporary and comparatively brief. Elliptical systems consist mainly of Population II objects, so that the most brilliant stars are old red giants, while Population I objects are dominant in the spirals, although the populations are always to some extent mixed, and no hard and fast boundaries can be drawn. Certainly the ellipticals contain 2 Microlensing makes use of the same principle; when an image is gravitationally lensed by a star rather than a galaxy, it is termed microlensing. Studies were carried out from 1993 by astronomers using the Melbourne telescope at Mount Stromlo in Australia. In 1986 B. Paczynski had proposed that if what is termed a MACHO (Massive Astronomical Compact Halo Object) passes in front of a star, it will act in the manner of a lens and cause a temporary increase in the star’s apparent brightness. Effects of this type have been reported, although the precise nature of MACHOs is very uncertain; brown dwarfs, black holes, neutron stars and normal stars have all been suggested as possible candidates.

Galaxies congregate in clusters, and our Galaxy is a member of what we call the Local Group. It contains over two dozen galaxies, but most of them are small; the senior members are the Andromeda Spiral, our Galaxy and the Triangulum Spiral. The two Magellanic Clouds are regarded as satellites of our Galaxy, while M.32 and NGC 205 rank as satellites of the Andromeda Spiral. A selected list of the Local Group systems is given in Table 26.1. The Magellanic Clouds are bright naked-eye objects, and contain objects of all kinds; in 1987 the Large Cloud even produced a supernova. They were formerly classified as irregular, but it now seems that the Large Cloud is a rather poorly-defined barred spiral, while the Small Cloud may be double. They are linked with our Galaxy by the Magellanic Stream, which is made up of neutral hydrogen, stretching in a continuous arc beyond the Clouds and tracing out their orbits round our Galaxy. The origin of the Stream is probably tidal. The Large Cloud is about one-quarter the size of our Galaxy; for the Small Cloud the figure is one-sixth. The Andromeda Spiral, M.31, is one and a half times the size of our Galaxy, and contains over 300 globular clusters, as well as variable stars of all types, doubles, diffuse nebulæ, planetary nebulæ and novæ. There has also beenonerecordedsupernova, SAndromedæof1885, which reached the fringe of naked-eye visibility. Although its nature was not realized at the time (M.31 was still generally believed to be a minor feature of our Galaxy), its remnant has been identified since. In 1993 results from the Hubble Space Telescope showed that M.31 has a double nucleus. It is a well-formed spiral system of class Sb, and it is unfortunate that it lies at a narrow angle to us, so that the full beauty of the spiral is lost. 316 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"G ALAXIES At present M.31 is approaching our Galaxy at a rate of almost 500 km h − 1 . Whether there will be an eventual collision is not clear; at any rate, no such collision can occur for at least 5000 million years in the future, by which time the Sun will long since have left the Main Sequence and the Earth will no longer exist. If a collision occurs, the spiral forms of both systems will be destroyed. The Triangulum Spiral, M.33, is half the size of our Galaxy, and contains around 10 000 million stars. The other members of the Local Group are dwarfs, either elliptical or irregular. The closest of all galaxies is the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, SagDEG (not to be confused with another dwarf system in Sagittarius, the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy or SagDIG). SagDEG was discovered in 1994 by R. Ibata, M. Irwin and G. Gilmore. It is 80 000 light-years from the Sun, and 50 000 light-years from the centre of the Galaxy. In the sky it extends over an area of 5 × 10 degrees, but it is far from prominent. It orbits the Galaxy in a period of less than 1000 million years, and will eventually be disrupted. It seems to contain the globular cluster M.54; probably it includes about a million stars, many of which are old red giants. Its current length is around 10 000 light-years, and is elongated in the direction pointing to the centre of our Galaxy. The dwarf members of the Local Group are mainly less than 5000 light-years in diameter. Some of them, such as the Ursa Minor, Draco, Sculptor and Fornax galaxies, are within a million light-years of us, but are very sparse. No doubt many more dwarfs exist, hidden from us by interstellar matter. Indeed, few galaxies can be seen near the dust-rich main plane of our Galaxy; this region is known as the Zone of Avoidance. Adjoining the Local Group are other groups, such as the Maffei group; this contains a giant elliptical system (Maffei 1), discovered in 1968 by the Italian astronomer of that name. It is heavily obscured by material in our Galaxy, and was at first thought to be a true member of the Local Group; not far from it is a second galaxy, Maffei 2, and there are other smaller systems. Also comparatively close is the Sculptor group, dominated by NGC 253 (C.65), a beautiful edgewise-on spiral. The nearest really large group is the Virgo Cluster, which contains about 2000 members and is the physical centre of what is termed the Local Supercluster; the average distance from us of the galaxies in the Virgo cluster is 60 000 000 light-years. The largest member is the giant elliptical M.87, which is a powerful radio source, and which has sent out a curious jet of material. The Virgo cluster has a pronounced effect upon our Local Group, and we are also affected by the ‘Great Attractor’, which may be a concentration of massive systems heavily obscured by intervening dust. From 1912 V. M. Slipher, at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, examined the spectra of galaxies, using the Lowell refractor. The galaxies are composed of millions of stars, and the spectra are bound to be something of a jumble, but the absorption lines can be measured easily enough. Slipher found that apart from a few of the very nearest galaxies – those now known to belong to the Local Group – all the Doppler shifts were to the red, indicating velocities of recession. At the time the significance of this was not fully appreciated, and it was still widely believed that the ‘starry nebulæ’ were contained in our Galaxy. Edwin Hubble found the answer. First he proved, by observations of Cepheids, that the galaxies are external systems. Two years later, in 1925, he established that there is a definite link between distance and recessional velocity; the further away a galaxy lies, the faster it is receding. In fact, the entire universe is expanding, and every group of galaxies is moving away from every other group. There is no ‘centre’, and by now our telescopes can reach out to systems which are over 10 000 million light-years away, receding at well over 90% of the velocity of light. It is of vital importance to define the value of the ‘Hubble constant’, which defines the rate at which the universe if expanding. Many estimates have been made, ranging from 30 up to 100 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 . In 1999 new measurements, madewiththeSpaceTelescope, gaveavalue of 70 km s − 1 Mpc − 1 , with a possible error of only 10%. The Hubble team observed galaxies out to 64 000 000 light- years, and identified 800 Cepheid variables, so that the result seems to be much more reliable than any previous estimate. Assuming that the expansion has gone on ever since the universe, in its present form, came into existence – THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 317"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"G ALAXIES however that may have happened! – the new data indicate that the universe cannot be much more than about 12 000 million years old, which is considerably younger than has been previ- ously believed 3 . Moreover, if the rule of ‘the further, the faster’ holds good, we will eventually peer out to a distance at which a system would be racing away at the full velocity of light. We would then be unable to see it, and we would have reached the boundary of the observable universe, although not necessarily the boundary of the universe itself. Inside clusters, collisions between galaxies can and do occur. For example there are the Antennæ galaxies in Corvus, NGC 4033 and 4039 (C.61 and 62), where the two systems are meeting and triggering off intense star formation; the nickname comes from the fact that the long streamers of gas issuing from the systems resemble an insect’s antennæ. The Cartwheel Galaxy in Sculptor, 500 million light-years away, was once a normal spiral, but a smaller system plunged into it, careering through the core and sending ripples of energy outward; these compressed the dust and gas, and the result was an expanding ring made up of several thousands of millions of new stars. The ring seems to have resulted from a collision which dates back 200 000 000 years. The diameter of the Cartwheel is 15 0000 light-years. 3 Some astronomers still maintain that 15 000 million years is nearer the truth. We cannot yet be confident of the precise value. In 1999 a superb picture of two interacting spiral galaxies in Canis Major, NGC 2207 and IC 2163, was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope’s Wide Field Planetary Camera 2. Strong tidal forces from the larger system, NGC 2207, have distorted the shape of IC 2163, flinging out stars and gas into long streamers stretching out for at least 100 000 light-years. It seems that IC 2163 is swinging past NGC 2207 in a counter-clockwise direction, having made its closest approach 40 000 000 years ago. However, IC 2163 does not have sufficient energy to escape from the gravitational pull of NGC 2207, and in the future it will be pulled back, again swinging past the larger system. Trapped in their mutual orbits round each other, the two galaxies will continue to distort and disrupt each other until finally, perhaps several thousands of millions of years from now, they will merge into a single, more massive galaxy. Some galaxies are known as ULIRG systems (Ultra- Luminous Infra-red Galaxies). In 1999 observations of some of these, made with the Hubble Space Telescope, showed that there are ‘nests’ of these systems, apparently engaged in multiple collisions which involve three, four or even five galaxies. Previously it had been thought that only pairs of galaxies took part in these collisions. Yet what does all this tell us about the origin and evolution of the universe itself? 318 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"27 T HE E VOLUTION O F T HE U NIVERSE Most astronomers believe that the universe was created at one set moment, in what is usually called the ‘Big Bang’. Matter did not simply erupt into pre-existing space; space, time and matter came into existence simultaneously. It is impossible to discuss what happened before that, because there was no ‘before’. Neither can we say just where the Big Bang happened, because if it included the whole universe it happened ‘everywhere’. Expansion began at once, and has been continuing ever since. To be accurate, it is space which is expanding, carrying all matter – and, of course, the galaxies –with it. The concept was originally described in 1927 by the Belgian abb ́ e Georges Lema ˆ ıtre. Theory can take us back to 10 − 43 second after the Big Bang. The temperature at that time was of the order of 10 32 degrees C, and the universe was dominated by radiation. Energetic particles were moving around, and some of this radiation turned into particles of matter and anti-matter – including what are termed quarks, the ‘building blocks’ of protons and neutrons. If a particle and an anti-particle meet, both vanish, and if the numbers had been equal there would have been nothing left of the fledgling universe. However, there were rather more particlesthananti-particles, sothatmostoftheanti-particles were rapidly annihilated. About one-millionth of a second after the beginning of time, quarks clumped together to form protons and neutrons. There were more protons than neutrons. After about 100 seconds, nuclear reactions began, and protons and neutrons combined to form the first elements, hydrogen and helium. The universe was opaque, because photons of light could not travel far before being blocked by collisions. About 300 000 years later, when the universe had cooled to around 3000 degrees C, electrons were captured by nuclei to make complete atoms. Light could now travel for vast distances without being blocked, and the universe became transparent to radiation; this is known as the decoupling stage. It followed that the radiation content of the universe was free to spread out all over the expanding volume of space. This expansion diluted the radiation, and the wavelengths of the light were increased. Today the radiation is still there, and is detectable, although very diluted and also shifted into the millimetre and centimetre range of the electromagnetic spectrum. It remains a faint glow pervading all space – the last remnant of the Big Bang. All this may sound highly speculative, but we do have the evidence of the microwave radiation, indicating an overall temperature o f3K– that is to say, 3 degrees above absolute zero, the coldest temperature there can possibly be ( − 273 ◦ C). The microwave radiation was detected in 1965 by A. Penzias and R. Wilson, using a special radio antenna which had been built for a completely different investigation. However, the background radiation had been predicted earlier by R. Dicke, who calculated that the temperature of the universe should by now have fallen to precisely this value: 3 K. One initial problem was that the background radiation seemed to be quite uniform, and it was not easy to see how a ‘lumpy’ universe could have been formed from a very smooth expansion; how could galaxies begin to condense? To the relief of theorists, measurements carried out in 1992 from an artificial satellite, COBE (the Cosmic Background Explorer), showed that there were tiny irregularities in the background radiation, and these were confirmed in 1993 by S. S. Meyer and his team using a balloon-borne radiometer; independent confirmation came from a Jodrell Bank team using a radiometer on Mount Teide in Tenerife. Many authorities believe that about 10 − 35 second after the Big Bang there was a brief period of rapid inflation, when the size of the universe increased enormously. Subsequently matter clumped together to form galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and the rate of expansion settled down. But will expansion continue indefinitely? This depends upon the overall density of matter of the universe. If it is above a certain critical value, expansion will stop and be followed by a period of contraction, ending in what may be called a Big Crunch. The critical value is around 3 atoms of hydrogen per cubic metre. If the overall density is less than this, the universe will expand for ever. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 319"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"T HE E VOLUTION O F T HE U NIVERSE The ratio of the actual mean density to the critical density is usually denoted by the Greek letter omega, 6 . If 6 is greater than 1, the universe is closed. If it is less than 1, the universe is open. The amount of luminous matter which we can actually see – galaxies, stars and so on – is not nearly enough to close the universe; 6 works out at around 0.01. However, there seems to be a vast amount of ‘dark matter’ which we cannot see, and this could change the whole situation. We have seen indications of this in the way in which our Galaxy rotates, and the same applies to other spirals, which may well contain five to ten times as much dark matter as luminous matter. Moreover, individual member galaxies of a cluster are moving around, and unless something were holding the cluster together it would disperse. Typical clusters of galaxies need 30 to 50 times as much dark matter as luminous matter to stop them from flying apart. We have to admit that we have no real idea of the nature of this dark matter. It has been proposed that neutrinos may have a little rest mass; it could even be that dark matter is of a completely different nature to ordinary matter, so that our present-day equipment is unable to detect it. In an open universe , expansion will continue indefinitely, with the clusters of galaxies moving further and further apart. Eventually, in perhaps 10 14 years’ time, all the nuclear reactions of all the stars in all the galaxies will cease, and the galaxies will become cold, dead places. In a closed universe , with 6 greater than 1, the clusters of galaxies will eventually start to draw together again; red shifts will be succeeded by blue shifts, and the temperature of the background radiation will rise. The ‘Big Bang’ will be repeated in what has been called the ‘Big Crunch’. By around 10 000 million years before the Big Crunch, the temperature will have climbed back to its present value (3 K). A hundred million years before the Big Crunch, galaxies will merge and lose their separate identity. A million years before the end, the whole of space will be warmer than the present-day temperature of the surface of the Earth. About 100 000 years before the Crunch, the temperature everywhere will be around 10 000 K, hotter than the present surface of the Sun; stars will explode, and the whole universe will become opaque, consisting of a mass of plasma together with radiation. A hundred seconds before the Crunch, atomic nuclei will disintegrate into protons and neutrons. When the Crunch comes, it may be the end of everything, because time itself may cease. On the other hand, it may be that the Crunch will be succeeded by another Big Bang, and the entire cycle will begin again. We cannot tell; our current theories of the forces of nature are hopelessly inadequate to deal with problems of this kind. We must also consider a situation in which 6 is exactly 1. The galaxies will then have just enough energy to continue moving apart for ever; their velocities will fall closer and closer to zero, but will not actually become zero until an infinite time in the future. This is usually termed ‘flat’ universe , because space would have no curvature. Obviously there are many details about which we are unsure; we cannot even give a definite ‘age’ for the universe it its present form. It has been estimated that the Big Bang happened 12 000 million to 15 000 million years ago. Very recently, there have been suggestions that the rate of expansion may be increasing, and this would certainly pose a major problem for theorists. It might even be necessary to bring back the ‘cosmological constant’, a force acting against that of gravitation – once introduced by Einstein, but later abandoned by him. However, as yet the evidence for an accelerating expansion of the universe is very uncertain. In 1947 H. Bondi and T. Gold proposed a different theory – that the universe was in a steady state, which had no beginning and will have no end. The discovery of the 3 K background radiation effectively disproved this concept, but it is not so easy to dispose of the ideas of Halton Arp, who has produced images of galaxies and quasars which are clearly joined by luminous ‘bridges’, and are therefore presumably associated, but which have completely different red shifts. Arp believes that the shifts are not pure Doppler effects, but that there is a marked non-velocity component, so that all our distance measures beyond the Local Group are unreliable; he even thinks it possible that quasars are minorfeaturesshotoutofgalaxies. Thisisamostunpopular view among cosmologists, and it may be significant that Arp was refused further observing time with the large American telescopes because he was obtaining results which were embarrassing to official theory (subsequently he went to Germany and is now researching at the Max Planck Institute in Munich). If Arp is right, then many of our cherished 320 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"T HE E VOLUTION O F T HE U NIVERSE theories will have to be drastically modified, or even abandoned. Among Arp’s strong supporters is Sir Fred Hoyle. New data concerning the very early universe were obtained in 1999, from the project termed Balloon Observations of Millimetric Extragalactic Radiation and Geophysics (‘BOOMERANG’). The main telescope had a 1.2 m primary mirror, and weighed 2 tons. The equipment was carried in a giant helium-filled balloon which flew around Antarctica from 29 December 1998 to 9 January 1999, covering over 8000 km at a maximum altitude of 37 km; the launch took place from McMurdo Base, and the landing was within 50 km of this. Over 1800 square degrees of the sky were covered. Antarctica was chosen because of the stable prevailing winds at high altitude and, of course, the constant sunshine. The scientists came from Britain, Canada, Italy and the United States. The resolution of the BOOMERANG images was 35 times better than with COBE, and were the first to bring the cosmic microwave background into sharp focus. The images reveal hundreds of complex regions visible as tiny variations – of the order of 0.0001 ◦ C – in the temperature of the microwave background. The results give the best measurements to date of the geometry of space-time. They support the inflation theory – that the entire universe grew from a tiny subatomic region during a period of violent expansion a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. This expansion ‘stretched’ the geometry of space and made it to all intents and purposes ‘flat’. The complex patterns visible in the images confirm predictions of the patterns which would result from sound-waves racing through the young universe, creating structures which subsequently evolved into giant clusters and superclusters of galaxies. All in all, it is clear that our present knowledge of the evolution of the universe is very incomplete. Moreover, no theory can explain how matter came into existence in the first place, so that we are not genuinely discussing the origin of the universe at all; we are dealing with its development, which is a very different thing. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 321"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"28 T HE C ONSTELLATIONS From BC 4000 constellation patterns were drawn up. All these were different; the Chinese and Egyptian constellations, for example, are quite unlike ours (for example, our Draco seems to correspond with the Egyptian hippopotamus). Our system is derived from that of Ptolemy (Table 28.1) (it may originally have been Cretan, though opinions differ). In all, 88 separate constellations are now in use. A list of these is given in Table 28.2. Ptolemy gave a list of 48 constellations: 21 northern, 12 Zodiacal and 15 southern (Table 28.2). All these are to be found on modern maps, although in many cases their boundaries have been altered – and the huge Argo Navis, the Ship Argo, has been chopped up into a Keel (Carina), sails (Vela) and a poop (Puppis). Surviving post-Ptolemaic constellations are given in Table 28.3. Many of the original names have been shortened; this Piscis Volans, the Flying Fish, has become simply Volans, while Mons Mensæ, the Table Mountain, has become Mensa. There was some confusion over two of Bayer’s constellations, Apis (the Bee) and Avis Indica (the Bird of Paradise); modern maps give it as Apus. There were also two Muscas, one formed by Lacaille to replace Bayer’s Apis, and the other (rejected) formed by Bode out of stars near Aries. One discarded constellation, Quadrans, has at least given its name to the Quadrantid meteor shower of early January; the stars of Quadrans are now included in Bo ̈ otes (near β Bo ̈ otis). The list of rejected constellations is very long (Table 28.4). Few will be regretted, though there are some people who are sad to see the demise of Noctua and Felis (the Owl and the Pussycat!) There have been occasional attempts to revive the whole constellation system, but none has met with much support. However, the constellations are very unequal in size and importance. Apart from the dismembered Argo, the largest constellation, Hydra, covers 1303 square degrees, while the smallest, Crux, covers a mere 68 square degrees. Orion has five stars above the second magnitude and 42 above the fifth magnitude; against this, Mensa has no star Table 28.1. Ptolemy’s original 48 constellations.

For stars above magnitude 5, the greatest ‘density’ is for Crux (19.12 stars per 100 square degrees), at the other end of the scale comes Mensa (0.0), and then Sextans (0.63). There have been a few cases of stars which have been arbitrarily transferred from one constellation to another; thus δ Pegasi has become α Andromedæ, γ Aurigæ has become β Tauri and γ Scorpii has become σ Libræ. The current star-map is so well established that it will certainly not be altered, but one cannot but agree with the 19th-century Sir John Herschel, who commented that the constellation patterns seemed to have been designed so as to cause as much confusion and inconvenience as possible. 322 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"T HE C ONSTELLATIONS Table 28.2.

The published values for absolute magnitudes and distances differ somewhat, and are subject to uncertainty; therefore the values given here have been in general ‘rounded off’ except for those stars for which the data are known with true precision. I have followed the data given in the authoritative Cambridge Sky Catalogues (1987). The list of double stars, variable stars, and nebular objects does not pretend to be complete, and could be extended almost ad infinitum , but I have included most variable stars whose maximum magnitudes are 8.0 or brighter and where the range is at least half a magnitude. For double stars, I have given pairs which are within the range of modest telescopes together with some which may be regarded as test objects. For binary stars of reasonably short period, the values of position angle and distance are for approximate date 2000. Data given are: VARIABLE STARS. Range, type, period in days, and spectral type. DOUBLE STARS. Position angle in degrees, separation in seconds of arc, and magnitudes of the components. OPEN CLUSTERS. Diameter in minutes of arc, magnitude, and approximate number of stars (though in many cases this is subject to great uncertainty). GLOBULAR CLUSTERS. Diameter in minutes of arc, and approximate total magnitude. PLANETARY NEBULÆ. Dimensions in seconds of arc, total magnitude, and magnitude of central star. NEBULÆ. Dimensions in minutes of arc, and, where appropriate, the magnitude of the illuminating star. GALAXIES. Magnitude, dimensions in minutes of arc, and type. For nebular objects I have given NGC numbers, together with Messier or Caldwell numbers where appropriate. Right ascensions and declinations for all objects are for epoch 2000. THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 327"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"T HE S TAR C ATALOGUE A NDROMEDA (Abbreviation: And). A large and important northern constellation; one of Ptolemy’s ‘originals’. It contains the Great Spiral, M.31. One of the leading stars in the constellation – Alpheratz or α Andromedæ– is actually a member of the Square of Pegasus, and was formerly known, more logically, as δ Pegasi. In mythology, Andromeda was the beautiful daughter of King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia. Cassiopeia offended the sea god Neptune by her boasting about Andromeda’s beauty, which, she claimed, was greater than that of any sea-nymph. Neptune thereupon sent a sea-monster to ravage the kingdom, and the Oracle stated that the only solution was to chain Andromeda to a rock by the shore where she would be devoured by the monster. This was duly done, but the situation was redeemed by the hero Perseus, who was on his way home after killing the Gorgon, Medusa. Mounted upon his winged sandals, Perseus arrived in the nick of time, turned the monster to stone by the simple expedient of showing it Medusa’s head, and then, in the best story-book tradition, married Andromeda. Cepheus, Cassiopeia and of course Perseus are to be found in the sky; the Gorgon’s head is marked by the ‘Demon Star’ Algol, and the sea-monster has sometimes been identified with the constellation of Cetus. Andromeda has no first-magnitude star, but there are eight above magnitude 4. Mag.

One of the most distinctive of all the northern constellations, and, of course, an ‘original’. Mythologically it represents an eagle which was sent by Jupiter to collect a Phrygian shepherd-boy, Ganymede, who was destined to become cup-bearer of the Gods – following an unfortunate episode in which the former holder of the office, Hebe, tripped and fell during a particularly solemn ceremony. The leading star is Altair. Altogether there are eight stars above magnitude 4. Mag.

The first constellation of the Zodiac – though since the vernal equinox has shifted into Pisces, Aries should logically be classed as second! In mythology it represents a ram with a golden fleece, sent by the god Mercury (Hermes) to rescue the children of the king of Thebes from an assassination plan by their stepmother. The ram, which had the remarkable ability to fly, carried out its mission; unfortunately, the girl (Helle) lost her balance and fell to her death in that part of the sea now called the Hellespont, but the boy (Phryxus) arrived safely. After the ram’s death, its golden fleece was hung in a sacred grove, from which it was later removed by the Argonauts commanded by Jason. Aries is moderately conspicuous. There are four stars above the fourth magnitude. Mag.

It is interesting to note that several of the apparently faint stars are in fact highly luminous and remote; for instance α Cam, which is below the fourth magnitude, is well over 20 000 times more luminous than the Sun.

Cancer is an obscure constellation, redeemed only by the presence of two famous star-clusters, Præsepe and M.67. However, it lies in the Zodiac, and it has a legend attached to it. It represents a sea-crab which Juno, queen of Olympus, sent to the rescue of the multi-headed hydra which was doing battle with Hercules. Not surprisingly, Hercules trod on the crab, but as a reward for its efforts Juno placed it in the sky! There are only two stars above the fourth magnitude. Mag.

Compared with them, Sirius is extremely feeble, as it has only 26 times the Sun’s luminosity. Sirius has a white dwarf companion, mag. 8; binary, period 50 years. Though the companion does not appear faint, it is difficult to see because of the overpowering glare of the primary. The separation ranges between 3 sec to 11 sec .5. It was widest in 1975, so that it is now closing up. β (Mirzam) is variable over a very small range, and is also a spectrum variable. ξ 1 is also a spectrum variable, and optically variable over a very small range of less than 0.1 magnitude. At EUV (extreme ultra-violet) wavelengths, Adhara is the brightest object in the entire sky.

The keel of the ship Argo, in which Jason and his companions sailed upon their successful if somewhat unprincipled expedition to remove the golden fleece of the sacred ram (Aries) from its grove. Carina is the brightest part of Argo, and contains Canopus, which is second only to Sirius in brilliance. Canopus is a highly luminous star, but estimates of its power and distance vary considerably. A recent estimate makes it over 200 000 times as luminous as the Sun; other estimates are much lower. Also in this constellation is η Carinæ, which during part of the last century rivalled Sirius, but which is now well below naked-eye visibility. It is unique, and at its peak may have been the most luminous star in the Galaxy. Excluding η , there are 15 stars in Carina above the fourth magnitude. Mag.

An original constellation – one of the most distinctive in the sky. Mythologically, Cassiopeia was Andromeda’s mother and wife of Cepheus; it was her boasting which led to the unfortunate contretemps with Neptune’s sea-monster. There are seven stars above magnitude 4. Of these, γ (Cih) is variable, and it is also suspected that α (Shedir) is variable over a small range – possibly 2.1 to 2.4, though opinions differ. κ , which looks obscure, is extremely luminous. There are eight stars brighter than magnitude 4. Mag.

The spectrum is variable, but generally of around type F8. 6 Cassiopeiæ (magnitude 5.43) is also very luminous; estimated absolute magnitude − 7 . 6, spectrum A4. Its position is R.A. 23 h 48 m 50.0 s, declination + 62 ◦ 12 \u0005 53 \u0005\u0005 . The distance has been given as 6500 light-years, but this is decidedly uncertain. BRIGHTEST STARS Star R.A. Dec.

It has been called Al Rijil Rigel Kent, and also Toliman, but astronomers in general prefer to call it simply α Centauri. α and β are known as the Pointers, because they show the way to the Southern Cross. The Australian Aborigines called them the Tho Brothers. β and its faint companion have common proper motion, and must therefore be associated. ω (listed by Ptolemy as a star) is the largest Milky Way globular, with a mass 5000 000 times that of the Sun – equal to a small galaxy. It is about 10 times as massive as other big globulars. Distance, 16 000 000 light-years.

It is now classed as a semi-regular variable, but the period given is at best extremely rough. BRIGHTEST STARS Star R.A. Dec. Mag. Abs. Spec.

One of the largest of all constellations; sometimes associated with the sea-monster of the Perseus legend, at others relegated to the status of a harmless whale. It contains the prototype long-period variable Mira, which can occasionally rise to magnitude 1.7, but which spends most of its period below naked-eye visibility. On average, Mira is visible with the naked eye for only a few weeks in every year. Mira is a huge star; its diameter varies, but is of the order of 650 000 000 km. The absolute magnitude varies between − 2 . 5 and + 4 . 7. Its companion is the flare star VZ Ceti. Cetus abounds in faint galaxies. Excluding Mira, there are eight stars above the fourth magnitude.

At first glance this constellation gives the impression of being a vast, dim cluster. Coma has no star above magnitude 4.3, but it abounds in faint ones, and there are many telescopic galaxies. Though the constellation is not ‘original’, there is a legend attached to it. When Ptolemy Euergetes, King of Egypt, set out in an expedition against the Assyrians, his wife Berenice vowed that if he returned safely she would cut off her lovely hair and place it in the temple of Venus. The King returned; the Queen kept her vow, and Jupiter placed the shining tresses in the sky. See chart for Bo ̈ otes. BRIGHTEST STARS Star R.A. Dec. Mag. Abs. Spec.

Cygnus is one of the richest constellations in the sky; it is often nicknamed the Northern Cross – certainly it is much more nearly cruciform than is Crux. Various legends are associated with it. According to one, the group was placed in the sky to honour a swan into which Jupiter once transformed himself when on a visit to the wife of the King of Sparta!

Its distance has been given as 5900 light-years (1800 parsecs). When it rose to magnitude 3, in 1600, it was regarded as a nova, but is now classed as a variable of the S Doradus type.

An immensely long constellation, extending from Achernar in the far south as far as Kursa, near Orion. Achernar is the only brilliant star. Mythologically, Eridanus is the river Po – and this was the river into which the youth Phæthon was plunged when he had obtained permission to drive the Sun-chariot for a day, and had lost control of it, so that Jupiter was forced to strike him down with a thunderbolt. Achernar is the closest really brilliant star to the south celestial pole. The pole lies in a very barren area, around midway between Achernar and the Southern Cross. There are 15 stars above magnitude 4. Mag.

Acamar is a fine double; the two components certainly make up a binary system, but the period must be of the order of several thousands of years. it has been suggested that A may itself be a spectroscopic binary. ε Eridani is one of the two closest solar-type stars ( τ Ceti is the other), and is a favourite candidate as a centre of a planetary system, though proof is lacking.

A brilliant Zodiacal constellation. In mythology, Castor and Pollux were the twin sons of the King and Queen of Sparta. Pollux was immortal, but Castor was not. When Castor was killed, Pollux pleaded with the gods to be allowed to share his immortality; so Castor was brought back to life, and both youths placed in the sky. Today Pollux is the brighter of the two stars, but in ancient times Castor was recorded as being the more brilliant. If any change has occurred (and this is by no means certain) it is more likely to have been in the late-type Pollux than in Castor, which is a multiple system. There are 13 stars in Gemini above the fourth magnitude. Mag.

A large but by no means brilliant constellation, commemorating the great hero of mythology. The most interesting objects are the red supergiant α and the globular clusters M.13 and M.92; M.13 is the brightest globular in the northern hemisphere of the sky, and is surpassed only by the southern ω Centauri and 47 Tucanae. Hercules contains fifteen stars above the fourth magnitude. Mag.

For most of the time its magnitude is between 3.4 and 3.7, and the official period, 100 days, is very rough indeed. Its companion is green, though this is due largely to contrast with the red primary.

A small constellation, but a very interesting one; it is graced by the presence of the brilliant blue Vega, as well as the prototype eclipsing binary β Lyræ, and the quadruple ε Lyræ, and the ‘Ring Nebula’ M.57. Mythologically it represents the harp which Apollo gave to the great musician Orpheus. There are several stars above the fourth magnitude. Of these, one ( β ) is the famous variable; the combined magnitude of the quadruple ε is about 3.9, though keen-sighted people can see the two main components as separated.

One of the most magnificent constellations in the sky; it represents the mythological hunter who boasted that he could kill any creature on earth, but who was fatally stung by a scorpion. The two leading stars are Rigel, which is actually variable over a very small range (0.08 to 0.20) and the red variable Betelgeu x – a name which may also be spelled Betelgeuse or Betelgeuze. The gaseous nebula M.42, in the Sword, is the most famous example of its type, and is easily visible with the naked eye. Altogether there are 15 stars above the fourth magnitude: Mag.

Mythologically it has been associated with Chiron, the wise centaur who was tutor to Jason and many others; but it would certainly be more logical to associate Chiron with Centaurus, and another version states that Chiron merely invented the constellation Sagittarius to help in guiding the Argonauts in their quest of the Golden Fleece. The centre of the Milky Way lies behind the star-clouds here, and the whole area is exceptionally rich; it abounds in Messier objects. It is worth commenting that the stars lettered α and β are relatively faint. There are 16 stars above the fourth magnitude. Mag.

Mythologically it is usually associated with the scorpion which Juno caused to attack and kill the great hunter Orion. Note that Orion and Scorpius are now on opposite sides of the sky – placed there, it is said, so that the creature could do Orion no further damage! Scorpius is one of the most magnificent of all constellations, and one of the few which gives at least a vague impression of the creature it is meant to represent. It is dominated by Antares, but the whole area is exceptionally rich. The ‘sting’, which includes Shaula – only just below the first magnitude – is to all intents and purposes invisible from England.

The Antares system is a radio source. ζ is a wide double, but not a binary system. The fainter component, ζ 1 , is exceptionally luminous and remote. γ has been transferred to Libra, as σ Libræ.

One of the brightest of the Zodiacal constellations. Mythologically it has been said to represent the bull into which Jupiter transformed himself when he wished to carry off Europa, daughter of the King of Crete. Taurus includes the reddish first-magnitude star Aldebaran, and also the two most famous open clusters in the sky: the Pleiades and the Hyades. Altogether there are 16 stars above the fourth magnitude. Mag.

The Hyades cluster is rather overpowered by the bright glare of Aldebaran, which is not a member of the cluster and simply lies in the same line of sight. At a distance of 151 light-years, as measured by the astrometric satellite Hipparcos, the Hyades form the nearest open cluster to us apart from the Ursa Major, which is spread widely over the sky.

The central group is about 10 light-years in diameter, while outlying members spread out to 80 light-years. The age is about 660 million years. Aldebaran is a red giant, diameter around 56 000 000 km. It has two faint companions, at 31.4 and 121 arcsec respectively, but these do not seem to be genuinely related to Aldebaran. λ Tauri is the brightest of the eclipsing Algol binaries, apart from Algol itself.

The most famous of all northern constellations; circumpolar in England and the northern United States. Mythologically it represents Callisto, daughter of King Lycaon of Arcadia. Her beauty surpassed that of Juno, which so infuriated the goddess that she ill- naturedly changed Callisto into a bear. Years later Arcas, Callisto’s son, found the bear while out hunting, and was about to shoot it when Jupiter intervened, swinging both Callisto and Arcas – also transformed into a bear – up to the sky: Callisto as Ursa Major, Arcas as Ursa Minor. The sudden jolt explains why both bears have tails stretched out to decidedly un-ursine length! The seven main stars of Ursa Major are often called the Plough; sometimes King Charles’ Wain, and, in America, the Big Dipper. One of the Plough stars is Mizar, the most celebrated naked-eye double in the sky since it makes a pair with Alcor; Mizar is itself a compound system, and the two main components are easily separable with a small telescope. Ursa Major contains 19 stars above the fourth magnitude. 448 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"T HE S TAR C ATALOGUE U RSA M AJOR (continued) Mag.

A very large constellation, representing Astræa – the goddess of justice, daughter of Jupiter and Themis. The ‘bowl’ of Virgo abounds in faint galaxies. Of the nine stars down to the fourth magnitude, Spica is an eclipsing variable over a small range (0.91–1.01), and γ (Arich) used to be one of the most spectacular binary pairs in the sky, though it is closing up and will have become very difficult to separate by the end of the 20th century.

In 1889 H. Vogel found Spica to be a spectroscopic binary; visually it is very difficult to resolve. Both components are of type B; the primary seems to be about 15 300 000 km in diameter and 11 times as massive as the Sun, while the secondary has 6 times the diameter of the Sun and 4 times the solar mass.

It is even possible to claim that Stonehenge was an observatory, because there is little doubt that it is astronomically aligned. The oldest observatory building now standing seems to be that at Chomsong-dae, in Kyingju, South Korea; it dates from 632 AD. Later, elaborate measuring instruments were built by the Arabs and the Indians; some of these still exist, such as the great observatory at Delhi. In 1576 Tycho Brahe erected his elaborate observatory at Hven, in the Baltic, and used the equipment to draw up an amazingly accurate star catalogue. In the modern sense, observatories are of course associated with telescopes of some kind or another. A list of some great modern observatories is given in Table 30.2. National observatories date back for centuries; the oldest seems to be that of Leiden in Holland (1632). The oldest truly national observatory was that at Copenhagen in Denmark, although unfortunately the original buildings were destroyed by fire. The national British observatory, at Greenwich, was founded in 1675 by order of King Charles II, mainly so that a new star catalogue could be drawn up for the use of British seamen. The original buildings were designed by Wren, andarenowknownasFlamsteedHouse(afterthefirst Astronomer Royal). Greenwich became the ‘timekeeping centre’ of the world, and the zero for longitude passes through it. Until 1971 the Director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory also held the post of Astronomer Royal; a list of Astronomers Royal is given in Table 30.1. When Greenwich Park became unsuitable as an observing site, in the mid-20th century, the main equipment was transferred to Herstmonceux in Sussex, and the largest telescope was later taken to La Palma in the Canary Islands, where observing conditions are far better than in England. In 1992 Herstmonceux was closed, and the RGO transferred to an office block in Cambridge. Finally, in October 1998, the Government closed the RGO completely, ostensibly as an economy measure – probably the twentieth century’s worst act of scientific vandalism. Most modern observatories are sited at high altitude, where seeing conditions are good; the summit of Mauna Kea, for example, lies at over 4000 m. The summit of Los Muchachos, at La Palma in the Canary Islands, is alsoexcellent, asaresitesintheAtacamaDesertofNorthern Chile. TheUnitedStatesnationalobservatoryisatKittPeak in Arizona. Aircraft have been used; the Kuiper Airborne Observatory, brought into use in 1975, was a Lockheed C141 Starliner jet transport aircraft, in which was mounted an 0.915 m Cassegrain telescope. It was an outstanding success, and functioned until 1995, when it was abandoned for the usual reasons of economy. It could fly at 12 km, above 85% of the Earth’s atmosphere and 99% of the water vapour. In 1990 the Hubble Space Telescope was launched into Earth orbit. In contrast, the Homestake Mine Observatory, in South Dakota, is located in a gold- mine, and is 1.5 km below ground level. The ‘telescope’ is a 100 000 gallon tank of cleaning fluid, to trap solar neutrinos. The experiment was started in 1965, and is still operating. Many new observatories are being planned; the emphasis is on high-altitude installations, with a preference for the southern hemisphere, since many of the most important objects (such as the Magellanic Clouds) are inaccessible from Europe or the United States. It is by no means unlikely that in the reasonably near future it will be possible to set up an observatory on the surface of the Moon. T ELESCOPES We cannot be sure when the first telescope was built. According to research by the British scientific historian C. A. Ronan, a telescope may have been constructed in England by Leonard Digges, some time between 1545 and 1599; this may have used a combination of mirrors and lenses. However, we have no definite proof, and there 460 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"T ELESCOPES A ND O BSERVATORIES is no information as to whether it was ever turned to the sky. The first refracting telescope whose existence can definitely be proved was made by H. Lippershey, in Holland, in 1608. Before long, telescopes were used for astronomical work; for example, a telescopic map of the Moon was drawn by Thomas Harriot in 1609, but the first great telescopic observer was of course Galileo, who made a telescope for himself and began his work in January 1610. With it, he made a series of spectacular discoveries: the craters of the Moon, the phases of Venus, the strange appearance of Saturn, the four principal satellites of Jupiter and the ‘myriad stars’ of the Milky Way. The first reflecting telescope was made by Isaac Newton, and was presented to the Royal Society in 1671, so that it was probably made in 1668 or 1669. Telescopes of both kinds were steadily improved, and really large instruments became possible; in 1789 William Herschel produced a reflector with a 49 inch (124.5 cm) mirror. This was surpassed in 1845 by the 182.9 cm (72 inch) reflector made by the third Earl of Rosse, and set up at Birr Castle in Ireland. It was a strange instrument, mounted between two massive stone walls and capable of swinging for only a limited distance to either side of the meridian, but with it Lord Rosse discovered the spiral forms of the objects we know to be galaxies. The ‘Leviathan’, as it was nicknamed, was in fact the largest telescope in the world until 1917. It is now (2000) in full operation again. Early reflectors, including those of Herschel and Rosse, had metal mirrors, but glass mirrors coated with some reflective substance such as silver or aluminium were far better. Large refractors were built during the latter part of the 19th century; the largest of all, the Yerkes Observatory 40 inch (101 cm) was brought into use in 1895. However, a lens has to be supported around its edges, and if too large will distort under its own weight; probably the Yerkes refractor will never be surpassed. A 124.5 cm object-glass was made and shown at the Paris Exposition of 1901, but was never used for serious research. A 41 inch object glass destined for the Pulkovo Observatory in Russia was never even mounted. Clearly the future belonged to the reflector. Master-minded by George Ellery Hale, of the United States, a 60 inch reflector was set up Table 30.1. Astronomers Royal.

Then followed Charles Piazzi Smyth, Ralph Copeland, Frank Dyson, Ralph Sampson, William Greaves, Hermann Br ̈ uck, Vincent Reddish, Malcolm Longair, and the present (2000) holder of the office, John Campbell Brown. in 1908 at Mount Wilson, in California; in 1917 came the Hooker 100 inch (254 cm) reflector, also at Mount Wilson. This remained in a class of its own until 1948, with the completion of the Hale 200 inch (508 cm) on Mount Palomar, also in California. Today there are reflecting telescopes of many kinds. Some have segmented mirrors; for example the first Keck telescope, on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, has a mirror 9.8 m in diameter, made of 36 segments fitted together to form the correct optical curve. Keck II, by its side, is identical; when working together, as an interferometer they could in theory distinguish the headlights of a car, separately, over a range of 25 000 km. The first multiple-mirror telescope (MMT) was set up at the Whipple Observatory at Mount Hopkins, Arizona; it used six 183 cm mirrors in conjunction, so that the total light-grasp was equal to a single 442 cm mirror. It performed well, but the six mirrors have now been replaced THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 461"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"T ELESCOPES A ND O BSERVATORIES by a single 650 cm mirror constructed by Roger Angel, using his new spin-casting technique. The Gemini project is an international partnership to build tw o 8 m telescopes, one on Mauna Kea and the other at Cerro Pachon in Chile; thesewillworktogether. TheMaunaKeatelescope, Gemini North, is now operative, and Gemini South is nearing completion. There are telescopes with mirrors made from liquid mercury, spinning so as to produce a perfect parabola. The Hobby-Eberly Telescope has a spherical main mirror whose optical axis is tilted to the zenith at an angle of 35 ◦ ; the mirror and telescope are mounted on a frame which turns 360 ◦ in the azimuthal direction, so that during an observation the telescope is fixed in the azimuth and objects are tracked by moving a spherical aberration corrector to follow the reflected light. The main mirror is composed of 91 segments, each hexagonal in shape an d 1 m across the flats. All these are dwarfed by the VLT or Very Large Telescope at Cerro Para ̃ nal, Chile. When the four 8 m mirrors are working together, they will provide an instrument far more powerful than anything previously built. Three of the mirrors (Antu, Kueyen and Melipal) were operating by 2000, and were producing spectacular results. Meanwhile, the European Southern Observatory is planning OWL – the Overwhelmingly Large Telescope – with an aperture of 100 metres. This would indeed be a telescope suited to the 21st century! Until the 1970s, all large telescopes were mounted equatorially. The first large altazimuth telescope was the Russia n 6 m reflector. Optically it has never been a real success, but its mounting was a new departure, and all the major telescopes are now altazimuths; modern computers can deal with guidance with no trouble at all. All major telescopes now make use of active optics (rapid adjustments of the shape of the mirror to allow for changes in elevation) and adaptive optics (to counteract rapid variations in the atmosphere). Electronic devices, such as CCDs (charge- coupled devices) have superseded photography; indeed, the last photographic plate taken with the Hale reflector was exposed as long ago as September 1989. Fibre optics are alsowidelyused. Thereare, ofcourse, specialisttelescopes, such as solar telescopes; the largest of these is at Kitt Peak in Arizona. It uses a 203 cm heliostat, and has an inclined tunnel 146 m long. It was completed in 1962, and although designed solely for solar research it proved capable of being used for other types of observation as well – an unexpected bonus. The Hubble Space Telescope was launched from the Space Shuttle on 25 April 1990. It has a 240 cm mirror and orbits at an altitude of 600 km in a period of 95 min; the orbital inclination is 28 . 5 ◦ . The total weight is 11 360 kg and the length 13.3 m; the diameter is 12 m with the solar arrays extended. Initially the telescope had a faulty mirror, but a servicing mission by astronauts introduced corrective optics and the telescope has now performed even better than had originally been hoped. With perfect seeing all the time, it can out-perform any Earth-based telescope in many ways. Three servicing missions to the telescope have now been carried out – the last in December 1999 (launch 19 December, return 27 December). P LANETARIA A planetarium is purely an educational device; an artificial sky is projected onto the inside of a large dome, by means of a very complex projector. The planetarium is really a development of the orrery, a device to show the movements of the planets. The first orrery was made in the 18th century by George Graham, for Prince Eugene of Savoy; the first American orrery was made by David Rittenhouse in 1772. The true ancestor of the modern planetarium was the Gottorp Globe, made by H. Busch in Denmark about 1654–6. It wa s4min diameter. The audience sat inside it; the stars were painted on the inside of the globe. However, the first modern-type planetarium, due to Dr. W. Bauersfeld of the Zeiss Optical Works, was opened at the Deutsches Museum in Bonn in 1923. Today most major cities have planetaria; the largest is that of Tokyo, at the Miyazumi Science Center, which has a 27 m dome, and was opened in 1987. In Britain, there are major planetaria at Armagh in Northern Ireland, and at Madame Tussaud’s in London; the South Downs Planetarium at Chichester, in Sussex, is scheduled to open in 2000.

He therefore flew electrometers in a balloon, rising to a height of 4800 m, and discovered evidence that cosmic rays are coming constantly from all directions in space. They are not rays at all, but particles. Most cosmic-ray primaries are protons, although there is a tiny gamma-ray component. There are many α -particles (helium nuclei) and some heavier atomic nuclei up to uranium and perhaps beyond. About3%oftheprimariesareelectrons. Theprimaries cannot pass directly through the Earth’s atmosphere, but break up both themselves and the air particles, so that only the secondary cosmic rays reach ground level. Cosmic rays are the only particles we can detect which have crossed the Galaxy, moving at almost the velocity of light. Unfortunately, the particles are affected by the magnetic fields in the Galaxy and this means that ordinarily it is not possible to determine the directions from which they come. The origins of cosmic rays seem to be varied. Those of the highest energy may have come from quasars or AGN; those of lower energy originate within the Galaxy in supernova remnants, supernova outbursts and pulsars. Those of the lowest energy come from solar flares. However, the Sun is not a major source of cosmic rays. The flux we receive decreases at the time of solar maximum, because of the increase in the strength of the interplanetary magnetic field, which acts as a screen (the Forbush effect). Modern cosmic-ray astronomy relies mainly upon space research methods, and many satellites and space probes carry cosmic-ray detectors. G amma-ray a stronomy Gamma rays represent the most energetic form of electro- magnetic radiation, at wavelengths shorter than those of X-rays – that is to say, below 0.01 nm. They are absorbed in the Earth’s upper atmosphere, and only the most energetic can reach ground level, so that virtually all gamma-ray astronomy depends upon equipment carried in satellites or space-craft (although balloons have also been used). Moreover, care must always be taken to distinguish gamma- rays from the much more plentiful cosmic rays. The first detection of high-energy gamma-rays from space was achieved by the Explorer XI satellite, in 1961; it picked up fewer than 100 gamma-ray photons. They seemed to come from all directions, indicating a more or less uniform gamma-ray background; this has been fully confirmed since. Discrete gamma-ray sources were also identified; the first of these, in the constellation of Sagittarius, was found in 1969.

The first really important gamma-ray satellites were SAS 2, launched in 1972, and Cos-B, launched in 1975. SAS 2 failed after six months, but Cos-B operated until 1982. It was confirmed that the most intense gamma radiation came from the galactic plane, due to interactions between cosmic rays and interstellar gas, and new discrete sources were identified, including the Vela 1 pulsar, the Crab pulsar and a strange object in Gemini, which was not visible optically and which did not seem to radiate except at gamma-ray wavelengths. It became known as Geminga, partly as an abbreviation for ‘Gemini gamma-ray source’ and partly because in the Milanese dialect, Geminga means ‘it is not there’. Only in 1991 was its true nature established. It is a neutron star, about 320 light-years away, thought to be the result of a supernova outburst about 300 000 years ago. It is not detectable as a pulsar, presumably because its beams of radiation do not sweep across the Earth. It is a powerful gamma-ray source, although the two strongest sources in the sky are the Vela pulsar and the Crab pulsar. One of the most successful vehicles involved with gamma-ray research is the satellite originally called GRO (the Gamma-Ray Observatory), but now named after the great pioneer of this research, Arthur Holly Compton. It was launched from the Shuttle on 5 April 1991; it weighed nearly 17 tons, and filled two-thirds of the Shuttle bay. The instruments weighed six tons, all were capable of detecting gamma-ray photons, measuring their energies, and determining the directions from which they came. It was found that the Milky Way glows at gamma-ray wavelengths; in 1993 the Compton satellite completed the first all-sky map of gamma-ray sources, and it also pinpointed many discrete sources, including AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) and quasars. It was deliberately crashed into the Pacific on 4 June 2000, as the equipment had started to fail. Very high-energy gamma-rays may be detected indirectly from observations made at ground level. In passing through the atmosphere they generate electrons which travel faster than the speed of light in air, resulting in 1 The Vela pulsar lies in the southern constellation of Vela, the sails of the dismembered Argo Navis. The name has nothing to do with the Vela series of artificial satellites. blue ̆ Cerenkov radiation which may be detected with special equipment. This does not mean that Einstein’s theory of relativity is wrong, because it is still the case that nothing can travel faster than light in a vacuum. The largest gamma- ray ‘telescope’ of this kind is at the Whipple Observatory on Mount Hopkins, Arizona; the ‘dish’ is 10 m in diameter. Intensive research is being carried out by scientists at the University of Durham, where the main equipment has been set up at Narrabri in Australia. Of special interest are the gamma-ray bursters; the first of these was detected by the Vela satellite in 1967, but many hundreds have been recorded since. They are of immense power, and last only briefly –from a few seconds to a few minutes; they may appear in any direction at any moment. For a long time they remained a complete mystery, but a great advance was made in February 1997, when an Italian satellite, BeppoSAX, pinpointed a burst in the constellation of Orion. Telescopes were promptly trained on the area, and detected a rapidly fading star, no doubt the aftermath of a titanic explosion; close by was a dim blob believed to be a galaxy. Since then seven more optical identifications have beenfound, andoneoftheseisassociatedwithaveryremote galaxy –redshift 3.4. It is therefore obvious that the gamma- ray bursters originate in the far reaches of the universe, and are unbelievably violent. Many have been recorded with BATSE, the Burst and Transient Source Experiment, carried in the Compton gamma-ray observatory. We do not yet know precisely what causes gamma- ray bursters. One suggestion involves the collapse of a massive star into a black hole (hypernovæ?), but whether this would generate enough power is debatable. Collisions between neutron stars have also been proposed but despite the progress made during the last few years it is fair to say that gamma-ray astronomy is still in an early stage of development. X -ray a stronomy X-rays were discovered in 1895 by the German scientist Wilhelm R ̈ ontgen (it must be admitted that the discovery was accidental). In the electromagnetic spectrum they lie between gamma-rays and ultra-violet. Cosmic X-ray sources range from the Sun to the hot outer atmospheres of normal stars, white dwarfs, active galaxies (including THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 471"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"N ON-OPTICAL A STRONOMY quasars) and accretion disks around neutron stars and black holes. For obvious reasons, no optical telescope can detect X-rays, because the X-ray photons would simply penetrate the telescope mirror. However, just as a bullet will ricochet off a wall when striking at a grazing angle, so X-rays will ricochet off a mirror when striking it at a narrow angle. An X-ray telescope is therefore quite unlike an optical telescope; the mirrors have to be aligned almost parallel to the incoming X-rays, so that the telescope is shaped like a barrel. Moreover, X-rays are absorbed by the Earth’s upper atmosphere, so that observations from the ground level are virtually impossible. The first observations of X-rays from the sky were made on 5 August 1948, when R. Burnright of the US Naval Research Laboratory detected solar X-rays from the darkening of a photographic emulsion carried to altitude on a V2 rocket. On 29 September 1948 H. Friedman and E. O. Hulbert, also using a V2, detected intense X-radiation from the Sun. In 1956 Friedman’s team recorded results which could have been due to celestial X-rays, but they could not be sure, as they always had the Sun in their field of view. Then, in 1959, R. Giacconi and his colleagues published a paper in which they predicted X-rays from very hot stars and supernova remnants. They referred particularly to the Crab Nebula. On 24 October 1961 a rocket was launched from White Sands to search for X-rays from the Moon. It was thought that these could be due to incident X-rays striking the lunar surface and causing X-ray fluorescence, together with X-rays due to the surface being struck by energetic electrons from the solar wind. The equipment failed, as the protective covers refused to open. A second rocket – an Aerobee – was launched on 18 June 1962. No lunar X-rays were found, but a discrete source was detected, later found to be Scorpius X-1. On 12 October 1962 a new launch recorded X-rays from the Crab Nebula, with an intensity of 15% of those from Scorpius X-1. By 1966 30 sources had been identified, including the first galaxy, M.87. The first imaging X-ray telescope was designed by Giacconi and his team at Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was flown on a small rocket. In 1965 it managed to pick up images of hot spots in the upper atmosphere of the Sun. Many X-ray satellites have been launched; a selected list is given in Table 31.1. The first satellite designed purely for X-ray work was Uhuru, launched from Kenya on 12 December 1970 (the name means ‘Freedom’ in Swahili). Uhuru carried out a comprehensive all-sky survey and located 339 sources, including binary systems, supernova remnants, Seyfert galaxies and clusters of galaxies; it also discovered diffuse X-radiation from the material contained in clusters of galaxies. In1971Uhurushowedthatonesource, Centaurus X-3, is a binary system; it was found that the intensity of the X-radiation varied rapidly in a period of 4.8 s, suggesting a neutron star, and a period of 2.087 days indicating that the neutron star was being eclipsed by a binary companion. The larger component was then optically identified, and a second binary, Hercules X-1, was identified in 1971. X-ray novæ are temporary phenomena. The first, Centaurus X-4, was discovered in May 1969 by an X-ray detector carried in a Vela satellite. An X-ray nova seen in December 1974, near the radio galaxy Centaurus A (although certainly unconnected with it) reached its maximum on Christmas Day, and was inevitably nicknamed CenXmas; another, in May 1975 close to the Crab Nebula (again, certainly unconnected with it) was equally inevitably nicknamed Fresh Crab! X-ray novæ seem to be close binaries with low-mass optical companions. One very successful X-ray satellite was HEAO 2, the Einstein Observatory, which was launched on 13 November 1978 and operated until 1981. It carried the first really large X-ray telescope, consisting of four nested paraboloids and four nested hyperboloids, with an outer diameter of 58 cm. The ambitious Japanese satellite Yohkoh (‘sunlight’), sent up in 1991, was designed mainly for solar studies. The R ̈ ontgen satellite, Rosat, was launched in 1990 and operated until finally switched off in February 1999; it achieved more than 9000 observations of objects, including comets, quasars, black holes, clusters of galaxies, proto-stars and supernovæ, as well as carrying out the first high-resolution sky surveys at X-ray and extreme ultra-violet (EUV) wavelengths. Rosat was truly international; it used a German X-ray telescope and a British wide-field camera used for extreme ultra-violet work, while the launch was achieved by an American rocket.

The X-rays were emitted by the Sun, and were scattered by atoms in the surface layers of the Moon. Rosat detected and catalogued about 100 000 separate X-ray sources, i.e. many more than the number of stars one can see with the naked eye. In July 1999 the Chandra X-ray Observatory was launched from the Shuttle. (Its original name was AXAF, the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility, but it was then re-named in honour of Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, the great Indian astrophysicist.) Chandra was put into an orbit which takes it from 9980 to 140 000 km above the Earth, so that for much of the time it is above the terrestrial radiation belts. It is a hundred times more sensitive than any other X-ray telescope, and quickly showed its potential; and early success was the detection of a brilliant ring inside the Crab Nebula. Chandra is designed to have an operational lifetime of five years. The X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM), of ESA, was launched on 10 December 1999 from an Ariane rocket at Kourou in South America. It is designed to perform detailed spectroscopy of cosmic X-ray sources over a broad band of energies ranging from 0.1 keV to 10 keV. There are three highly-nested grazing incidence mirror modules of type Wolter 1, coupled to reflection grating spectrometers and X-ray CCD cameras. It is now known as the Newton Satellite, in honour of the scientist who first showed that light was composed of many different colours (wavelengths). Newton and Chandra are both powerful in their own way. Chandra is optimized to provide the sharpest X-ray images, whilst Newton is the most sensitive for X-ray spectra. U ltra-violet a stronomy The existence of ultra-violet radiation from the Sun was demonstrated in 1801 by J. Ritter, by producing a spectrum with a prism and noting the darkening of paper soaked in sodium chloride held in the region beyond the violet. This was possible because ultra-violet radiation of between 300 and 400 nm can penetrate the Earth’s atmosphere. Most research in ultra-violet astronomy has to be carried out from altitude – initially by rockets, and nowadays by satellites. The first ultra-violet spectrograph was launched from White Sands on 28 June 1946, by a V2 rocket. It crashed, and the film was lost, but on 10 October 1946 a V2 soared to 88 km, and R. Tousey recorded the first recoverable solar ultra-violet spectra from above the atmosphere. Ultra-violet observations were subsequently made from the American satellites of the OAO (Orbiting Astronomical Observatory) series. OAO-1 (8 April 1966) failed. OAO-2 (7 December 1968) operated until 13 February 1973; it moved in an orbit ranging between 770 and 780 km above the ground. Its 11 ultra-violet telescopes THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 473"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"N ON-OPTICAL A STRONOMY viewed 1930 objects. Discoveries included a hydrogen cloud round a comet (Tago-Sato-Kosaka), magnetic fields of stars and ultra-violet radiation from a supernova. OAO-3 (the Copernicus satellite) was launched on 21 August 1972, and discovered many new sources, including supernova remnants and pulsars. It operated until late 1980. However, the most successful ultra-violet satellite to date has been the IUE (International Ultra-violet Explorer). It was launched on 26 January 1978, with an estimated lifetime of five years; in fact it continued to operate until deliberately switched off on 30 September 1996. It has provided material for more scientific papers than any other satellite. IUE carried a 45 cm aperture telescope, which could feed two spectrographs (one in the 190–320 nm range, the other 115–200 nm). Although the IUE was not designed to produce ultra-violet pictures, it did provide a complete survey of ultra-violet spectra for virtually every kind of astronomical object – hot stars, cool stars, variable stars, nebulæ, the interstellar medium, extragalactic objects and members of the Solar System, including Halley’s Comet. It movedinasynchronousorbit, atadistanceof42 164kmand an inclination of 34 ◦ . Its discoveries included many stars with magnetic fields and surface activity, measurements of stellar winds, mapping of low-density bubbles of gas around the Sun and nearby stars, and measurements of the composition of planetary nebulæ. The work of the IUE is now continued using the Hubble Space Telescope, which in addition to its visible instruments, also carries onboard cameras and spectrographs which are sensitive to the ultra-violet. Observations at extreme ultra-violet wavelengths (EUV) really began with the Rosat satellite in 1990. Previously it had – wrongly –been thought that no worthwhile observations in this part of the electromagnetic spectrum could be made, because of strong absorption by neutral hydrogen in the interstellar medium. The first object to be studied by Rosat was the binary system WFC1, made up of a very hot white dwarf, HZ43, which has a temperature of 200 000 ◦ C and is one of the hottest stars known; it has a red dwarf companion. Rosat also obtained the first EUV record of the Moon. The brightest star in the sky at EUV wavelengths is \u0018 Canis Majoris (Adhara). It is almost 500 light-years away, and had the interstellar medium been as opaque to EUV as was originally thought, it would have meant that radiations from that range would have been blocked. However, it now seems that the Solar System lies in a relatively dense, cool part of the interstellar medium, and is surrounded by more rarefied material at a higher temperature – so that the atoms of hydrogen are ionized and do not absorb EUV. The Extreme Ultra-Violet Explorer satellite (EUVE) was launched on 7 June 1992, into a 530 km Earth orbit; it was designed to study radiation at wavelengths from 70 and 760 ̊ A. It carried four grazing-incidence telescopes and recorded over 600 sources, ranging from Solar System objects (notably Mars, Jupiter and Io) to cool stars with hot coronæ, white dwarfs with temperatures up to 100 000 ◦ C, andthephotospheresandstellarwindsofveryhotstars. The nuclei of some active galaxies were also recorded, showing that in our own Galaxy there are ‘tunnels’ through which EUV can pass. By 1993 EUVE had completed a full survey of the sky in this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) was launched from Cape Canaveral on 24 June 1999. It records spectra of astronomical objects at the far-ultraviolet end of the electromagnetic spectrum (90 to 120 nanometres) – light which is nearly as energetic as X-rays. The FUSE equipment is about 10 000 times more sensitive than that of the Copernicus satellite, which operated from 1972 to 1980. I nfra-red a stronomy Infra-red astronomy has become a vitally important part of modern research. The original discovery of infra- red radiation from the Sun was made in 1801 by William Herschel, by placing a thermometer beyond the red end of the solar spectrum. The range extends from a micrometre(0.001mm)toseveralhundredsofmicrometres, beyond which comes the microwave region. Some wavelengths of infra-red can penetrate through to the Earth’s surface, particularly the ‘near infra-red’, towards the red end of the visible spectrum. Water vapour is the main enemy of the infra-red astronomer, so that the best sites are at high altitude, with low humidity – such as the top of Mauna Kea in Hawaii, and the lofty Cerro Para ̃ nal in the 474 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"N ON-OPTICAL A STRONOMY Atacama Desert of Northern Chile. Aircraft and balloons have been used to carry infra-red equipment, but of course satellites are of great importance. Infra-red radiations can penetrate dust clouds, and so provide us with information about star-forming regions and the central region of the Galaxy. For example, deep inside the Orion Nebula there are powerful stars which can be detected only in the infra-red; at optical wavelengths the nebulosity forms an impenetrable screen. The first major survey of the infra-red sky was undertaken in the 1960s by G. Neugebauer and R. Leighton; theydiscovered6000discretesources. Todaytherearelarge infra-red telescopes, such as UKIRT (the United Kingdom Infra-Red Telescope) on Mauna Kea, above most of the atmospheric water vapour. The aperture is 380 cm. The mirror is thin; theoretically a telescope designed for infra- red work need not be so accurate as an optical telescope, although in fact the UKIRT is so good that it can be used at optical wavelengths as well as in infra-red. Also on Mauna Kea is the NASA IRTF (Infra-Red Telescope Facility) with an aperture of 300 cm, and there are also other large telescopes designed to study this part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Of course, the Hubble Space Telescope, above the atmosphere, is very effective in the infra-red. Of infra-red satellites, one of the most successful has been IRAS (the Infra-Red Astronomical Satellite), which was launched on 25 January 1983; the reflector had an aperture of 60 cm, enclosed in a cooling vessel containing 500 litres of liquid helium, holding the temperature not far above absolute zero ( − 273 ◦ C). IRAS operated for 300 days, and could have picked up the radiation from a speck of dust several kilometres away. There were eight staggered rows of detectors, and observations were made in four bands (12, 25, 60 and 100 μ m). IRAS continued to function until 21 November 1983, when it ran out of coolant. By then it had surveyed 97% of the sky, and had made many major discoveries. For example, it found 245 389 discrete infra-red sources, increasing the number of known sources by more than 100; it found the first dust ring in the Solar System, which takes the form of a torus and lies at a distance about the same as that of the main asteroid belt, although inclined at an angle of 10 ◦ to the main plane of the Solar System; it obtained observationsofcomets, anddetectedthefirstcometarydust- tail in infra-red (Comet Tempel 2; the tail was 30 000 000 km long), and it made studies of infra-red ‘cirrus’, due to cool dust clouds in the Galaxy which, when displayed on computerized maps, shows up as wispy clouds resembling cirrus clouds – hence the name. They are made up of tiny dust grains, mainly graphite. The most spectacular discovery made by IRAS was that of clouds of cool material around some stars, notably Vega, Fomalhaut and the southern β Pictoris. In fact the cloud around Vega, the first to be found, was detected fortuitously; the main investigators, H. Aumann and R. Gillett, discovered it while calibrating the on-board equipment. IRAS also discovered many AGNs, and starburst galaxies (galaxies undergoing massive bouts of star formation) which are radiating strongly in the infra-red region of the spectrum. Other major satellites included ISO (the Infra-red Space Observatory) and the ESA satellite which was launched on 17 November 1995 and continued to operate until May 1998. It observed the universe at wavelengths from 2.5 to 240 μ m. Its detectors were about a thousand times more sensitive than those of IRAS, and achieved angular resolutions about a hundred times better (these figures relate to its observations at a wavelength of 12 μ m). Among its many achievements, it discovered water in the atmospheres of planets and of Titan, and in star-forming regions such as the Orion Nebula; it detected newly-forming stars at very early stages of development. It investigated the properties of ultra-luminous infra-red galaxies and, much nearer home, examined Comet Hale–Bopp. Infra-red studies can provide information which could not be obtained in any other way. It is fortunate that a considerableamountofworkcanbecarriedoutfromground level, although for some areas of research it is essential to use satellites. M icrowave a stronomy This part of the electromagnetic spectrum extends from 0.3 mm to 30 cm, which is longer than infra-red but shorter than radio radiation: sub-millimetre from 0.3 mm, millimetre from 1 mm.

Penzias and R. Wilson at the Bell Telephone Laborato- ries in Holmdel, New Jersey, fortuitously when they were calibrating a 7.35 cm wavelength receiver built for satellite communications. It is assumed to be the last manifestation of the Big Bang in which the universe was created; the over- all temperature has now fallen to 2 . 7 ◦ above absolute zero, agreeing with theory. The first slight irregularities in the microwave background were detected in April 1992 with COBE, the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite. These were ‘ripples’, or rarefied wisps of material, said to be the largest and most ancient structures known in the universe. This discovery was hailed as being among the most im- portant of modern times, and confirmed that it was indeed possible for the initial material to collect into galaxies of the kind we know today. The largest sub-millimetre telescopes are the JCMT (James Clerk Maxwell Telescope) on Mauna Kea, the SEST (Swedish Submillimetre Telescope) at La Silla in Chile and the CSO (California Institute of Technology Sub-millimetre Telescope) on Mauna Kea. The first two have 15 m segmented mirrors, and the CSO has a 10.4 m segmented mirror. R adio a stronomy Radio astronomy began in 1931, when the American radio engineer Karl Jansky detected radio waves from the Milky Way. The discovery was fortuitous; Jansky was investigating ‘static’ on behalf of the Bell Telephone Company, using a homemade aerial nicknamed the ‘Merry go-Round’ (part of the mounting was made from a dismantled Ford car). Jansky’s first paper was published in 1932, but caused surprisingly little interest, and Jansky never followed up his discovery as he might have been expected to do. The first intentional radio telescope was made by the American amateur Grote Reber, whose first paper appeared in 1940; Reber’s ‘telescope’ was a 9.5 m dish. At that time Reber was the only radio astronomer in the world. Radio waves from the Sun were first detected in 1942 by a British team led by J. S. Hey; originally the effects were thought to be due to German jamming of British radar. However, in February 1946 it was established that the giant sunspot of that month was a strong radio source. At Jodrell Bank, in Cheshire, work began in 1945, when radar was used to measure meteor trails; in the same year, radar echoes from the Moon were detected by an American team led by J. H. de Witt and, independently, by a Hungarian team led by Z. Bay. The first Jodrell Bank radiotelescopewasafixed66mparaboloid, duetoB.Lovell (now Sir Bernard Lovell). In 1946 the first discrete radio source beyond the Solar System was detected, Cygnus A, and in 1948 M. Ryle and F. G. Smith (now Sir Francis Graham–Smith) detected the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. In 1949 the first optical identifications of sources beyond the Solar System were made: Taurus A (the Crab Nebula), Virgo A (the galaxy M.87)andCentaurusA(thegalaxyNGC5128, C77). Radio waves from Jupiter were detected in 1955 by B. F. Burke and K. Franklin; the first quasar was identified in 1963 by its radio emissions, and the first pulsar in 1967, by Jocelyn Bell Burnell. In the years after the war, large radio telescopes were built; that at Dwingeloo in Holland dates back to 1956 – it is a dish 25 m across. The Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank, with a diameter of 76 metres (250 feet), came into operation in 1957; originally it was known as the Mark I, and from 1970, after major modifications, as the Mark IA. A second large telescope, the Mark II, was completed at Jodrell Bank in 1964. It is designed to operate at the shorter centimetre wavelengths beyond the range of the Lovell Telescope itself. The bowl of the Mark II is elliptical, measuring 38 . 2 × 25 . 4 m; it can be used at wavelengths down to 3 cm. The largest steerable ‘dish’ is at the Max Planck Institute at Effelsberg in Germany; it was completed in 1971, and has a diameter of 100 m. The largest non- steerable dish is at Arecibo, Puerto Rico; it is 304.8 m across, built in a natural hollow in the ground, and was completed in 1963. The largest array is the VLA or Very Large Array, 80 km west of Socorro in New Mexico; it is Y-shaped, each arm being 20.9 km long, with 27 movable antennæ, each 25 m across. It was completed in 1981. Radio telescopes can be used in conjunction.

Such a power is equivalent to measuring the diameter of a £1 coin from a distance of 100 km. The base telescope is at Jodrell Bank, either the Lovell Telescope or the Mark II. Some way away are 25 m dishes at Tabley and Darnhall. A third 25 m dish is at Knockin in Shropshire. More distant is the 25 m telescope at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment at Defford, and finally there is the 32 m dish at Cambridge. Apart from Defford, all the MERLIN telescopes can work at wavelengths as short as 13 mm, achieving a resolution of 0.04 arcsec. In Australia, CSIRO operates the Australia Telescope, which comprises eight radio-receiving antennæ. Six of these are at the Paul Wild Observatory near Narrabri, New South Wales. The other antennæ are the 64 m Parkes radio telescope and the 22 m antenna at Mopra, near Coonabarabran, again in New South Wales. Some of these can be networked with other radio telescopes in various parts of the world in order to make very detailed pictures of small areas of the sky. It has even been extended into space, with the Japanese orbiting radio telescope Halca, launched in 1997. This is known as Very Long Baseline Interferometry.

THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 477"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"32 T HE H ISTORY O F A STRONOMY To give every date of importance in the history of astronomy would be a mammoth undertaking. What I have therefore tried to do is to make a judicious selection, separating out purely space-research advances and discoveries. It is impossible to say just when astronomy began, but even the earliest men capable of coherent thought must have paid attention to the various objects to be seen in the sky, so that it may be fair to say that astronomy is as old as Homo sapiens . Among the earliest peoples to make systematic studies of the stars were the Mesopotamians, the Egyptians and the Chinese, all of whom drew up constellation patterns. (There have also been suggestions that the constellations we use as a basis today were first worked out in Crete, but this is speculation only.) It seems that some constellation-systems date back to 3000 BC, probably earlier, but of course all dates in these very ancient times are uncertain. The first essential among ancient civilizations was the compilation of a good calendar. Probably the first reasonably accurate value of the length of the year (365 days) was given by the Egyptians. (The first recorded monarch of all Egypt was Menes, who seems to have reigned around 3100 BC; he was eventually killed by a hippopotamus – possibly the only sovereign ever to have met with such a fate!) They paid great attention to the star Sirius (Sothis), because its ‘heliacal rising’, or date when it could first be seen in the dawn sky, gave a reliable clue to the time of the annual flooding of the Nile, upon which the Egyptian economy depended. The Pyramids are, of course, astronomically aligned, and arguments about the methods by which they were constructed still rage as fiercely as ever. Obviously the Egyptians had no idea of the scale of the universe, and they believed the flat Earth to be all important. So too did the Chinese, who also made observations. It has been maintained that a conjunction of the five naked-eye planets recorded during the reign of the Emperor Chuan Hs ̈ u refers to either 2449 or 2446 BC. There is also the legend of the Court Astronomers, Hsi and Ho, who were executed in 2136 BC (or, according to some authorities, 2159 BC) for their failure to predict a total solar eclipse; since the Chinese believed eclipses to be due to attacks on the Sun by a hungry dragon, this was clearly a matter of extreme importance! However, this legend is discounted by modern scholars. The earliest data collectors were the Assyrians; all students of ancient history know of the Library of Ashurbanipal (668–626 BC). This included the ‘Venus Tablet’, discovered by Sir Henry Layard and deciphered in 1911 by F. X. Kugler. It claims that when Venus appears, ‘rains will be in the heavens’; when it returns after an absence of three months ‘hostility will be in the land; the crops will prosper’. Early attempts at drawing up tables of the movements of the Moon and planets may well date from pre-Greek times, largely for astrological reasons; until relatively modern times astrology was regarded as a true science, and all the ancient astronomers (even Ptolemy) were also astrologers. Babylonian astronomy continued well into Greek times, and some of the astronomers, such as Naburiannu (about 500 BC) and Kidinnu (about 380 BC) may have made great advances; but we know relatively little about them, and reliable dating begins only with the rise of Greek science. Little progress was made in the following centuries, though there were some interesting Indian writings (Aryabh ̄ ata, 5th century AD), and in 570 AD Isidorus, Bishop of Seville, was the first to draw a definite distinction betweenastronomyandastrology. Therevivalofastronomy was due to the Arabs. In 813 Al-Ma’m ̄ un founded the Baghdad school of astronomy, and various star catalogues were drawn up, the most notable being that of Al-S ˆ uf ̄ ı (born about 903). During this period two supernovæ were observed by Chinese astronomers; the star of 1006 (in Lupus) and 1054 (in Taurus, the remnant of which is today seen as the Crab Nebula).

However, the list given here includes most of the great pioneers and researchers. No astronomers still living at the time of writing are included. All dates are AD unless otherwise stated. Abul Wafa, Mohammed. 959–88. Last of the famous Baghdad school of astronomers. He wrote a book called Almagest , a summary of Ptolemy’s great work also called the Almagest , in Arabic. Adams, John Couch. 1819–92. English astronomer, b. Lidcot, Cornwall. He graduated brilliantly from Cambridge in 1843, but had already formulated a plan to search for a new planet by studying the perturbations of Uranus. By 1845 his results were ready, but no quick search was made, and the actual discovery was due to calculations by U. Le Verrier. Later he became Director of the Cambridge Observatory, and worked upon lunar acceleration, the orbit of the Leonid meteor shower, and upon various other investigations. Airy, George Biddell. 1801–92. English astronomer. Born in Northumberland, he graduated from Cambridge 1823; and was Professor of Astronomy there 1826–35. On becoming Astronomer Royal (1835–81) he totally reorganized Greenwich Observatory and raised it to its present eminence. He re-equipped the Observatory and ensured that the best use was made of its instruments; it is ironical that he is probably best remembered for his failure to instigate a prompt search for Neptune when receiving Adams’ calculations. Aitken, Robert Grant. 1864–1951. American astronomer, b. Jackson, Cal. In 1895 he joined the staff of Lick Observatory, and specialized in double star work; he discovered 31000 new pairs, and wrote a standard book on the subject. From 1930 until his retirement in 1935 he was Director of the Lick Observatory. Albategnius. c. 850–929. This is the Latinized form of the nameoftheArabprinceAlBattani. b. Batan, Mesopotamia; he drew up improved tables of the Sun and Moon, and found a more accurate value for the precession of the equinoxes. His Movements of the Stars enabled Hevelius, in the 17th century, to discover the secular variation in the Moon’s motion. Albategnius was also a pioneer mathematician; in trigonometry, he introduced the use of sines. Alphonso X. 1223–84. King of Castile. At Toledo he assembled many of the leading astronomers of the world, anddrewupthefamousAlphonsineTables, whichremained the standard for three centuries. Alfv ́ en, Hannes. 1908–95. Swedish physicist (Nobri Laureate. 1970) and the founder of the science of magnetohydrodynamics. One of his achievements was to prove the existence of an overall galactic magnetic field. Alhazen (Abu Ali al Hassan). 987–1038. Arab mathematician, b. Basra. He went to Cairo, where he made his observations and also wrote the first important book on optics since the time of Ptolemy. Allen, Clabon. 1905–88. Australian astronomer who specialized in studies of the Sun. For 20 years he lived in London, and was Director of the University of London Observatory. His book Astronomical Quantities (1955) is a classic. Allen, David. 1946–94. Cambridge-born, he graduated from the University there, and concentrated upon infrared astronomy, in which he made many major contributions. He went to Australia, and worked with the Anglo–Australian Telescope at Coonabarabran. He was an outstanding writer of popular books as well as technical works. Sadly, he died of cancer when still in his forties. Al-Ma’m ̄ un, Abdalla. ?–833. Often referred to as Almanon. He was Caliph of Baghdad, son of Harun al Raschid; he collected and translated many Greek and Persian works, and built a major observatory in 829. Al-S ̄ uf ̄ ı. 903–86. A Persian nobleman, who compiled an invaluable catalogue of 1018 stars, giving their approximate positions, magnitudes and colours. Ambartsunian, Viktor Amazaspovich. 1909–95.

In Athens he became a friend of Pericles, and it was because of this friendship that he was merely banished, rather than being condemned to death, for teaching that the Moon contains plains, valleys and mountains, while the Sun is a blazing stone larger than the Peloponnesus (the peninsula upon which Athens stands). Anaximander. c. 611–547 BC. Greek philosopher, b. Miletus. HebelievedtheEarthtobeacylinder, suspended freely in the centre of a spherical universe. He attempted to draw up a map of the world, and introduced the gnomon into Greece. Anaximenes. c. 585–525 BC. Greek philosopher, b. Miletus. He believed the Sun to be hot because of its quick motion round the Earth, that the stars were too remote to send us detectable heat, and the stars were fastened on to a crystal sphere. ̊ Angstr ̈ om, Anders. 1814–74. Swedishphysicist, whograd- uated from Uppsala. He mapped the solar spectrum, and was the first to examine the spectra of auroræ. The ̊ Angstr ̈ om unit (100-millionth part of a centimetre) is named in his honour. Antoniadi, Eugenios. 1870–1944. Greek astronomer, who spent most of his life in France and became a naturalized Frenchman. He worked mainly at the Juvisy Observatory (with Camille Flammarion) and at Meudon, near Paris, where he used the 83 cm, refractor to make classic observations of the planets. Before the Space Age, hismapsofMarsandMercurywereregardedasthestandard works. He died in Occupied France during World War II. Apian, Peter Bienewitz. 1495–1552. b. Leisnig, Saxony. Became professor of mathematics at Ingolst ̈ adt. He observed five comets, and was the first to note that their tails always point away from the Sun. The 1531 comet is known to be Halley’s, and his observations of it enabled Edmond Halley to identify it with the comets of 1607 and 1682. Apollonius. c. 250–200 BC. b. Perga, Asia Minor, but lived in Alexandria. An expert mathematician, he was one of the first to develop the theory of epicycles to represent the movement of the Sun, Moon and planets.

German astronomer, who became Director of the Bonn Observatory 1836. Here he drew up his atlas of the northern heavens (the Bonn Durchmusterung ), containing the positions of 324 198 stars down to the ninth magnitude. This standard work was published in 1863. Aristarchus. c. 310–250 BC. Greek astronomer, b. Samos. One of the first (quite possibly the very first) to maintain that the Earth moves round the Sun, and he also tried to measure the relative distances of the Sun and Moon by a method which was sound in theory, though inaccurate in practice. Aristotle. (384–322 BC) believed in a finite, spherical universe. He further developed the theory of concentric spheres, and gave the first practical proofs that the Earth cannot be flat. Baade, Wilhelm Heinrich Walter. 1893–1959. German astronomer. In 1920, while assistant at Hamburg Observatory, he discovered the unique asteroid 944 Hidalgo. In 1931 he went to America, and joined the staff of Mount Wilson. In 1952 his work upon the two classes of ‘Cepheid’ short period variables enabled him to show that the galaxies are approximately twice as remote as had previously been thought. Bailey, Solon Irving. 1854–1931. American astronomer, b. New Hampshire. He joined the Harvard staff in 1879, and was for many years in charge of the Harvard southern station at Arequipa, Peru.

He also specialized in studies of dark nebulæ. Barrow, Isaac. 1630–77. English mathematician. He made various important contributions to science, but is perhaps best known because in 1669 he resigned his post as Lucasian Professor at Cambridge so that his pupil Isaac Newton could succeed him. Bayer, Johann. 1572–1625. German astronomer; a lawyer by profession and an amateur in science. He is remembered for his 1603 star catalogue, in which he introduced the system of allotting Greek letters to the stars in each constellation – the system still in use today.

Bode, Johann Elert. 1747–1826. German astronomer. b. Hamburg. Appointed director of Berlin Observatory 1772. In the same year he drew attention to the ‘law’ of planetary distances which had been discovered by Titius of Wittenberg; rather unfairly, perhaps, this is known as Bode’s Law. He published a star catalogue, did much to popularize astronomy, and for 50 years edited the Berlin Astronomisches Jahrbuch . Bolton, John. 1922–1993. Bolton was a Yorkshireman, born in Sheffield, but spent most of his career in Australia. He was a pioneer of radio astronomy, and was the first to identify the Crab Nebula as a radio source.

English astronomer (Astronomer Royal, 1742–62). He was educated in Gloucestershire, and entered the Ministry, becoming Vicar of Bridstow in 1719; in 1721 he went to Oxford as Professor of Astronomy, and remained there until his appointment to Greenwich, mainly on the recommendation of his close friend Halley. He discovered the aberration of light and the nutation of the Earth’s axis, but his greatest work was his catalogue of the positions of 60 000 stars. Brorsen, Theodor. 1819–95. Danish astronomer, who discovered several comets, and in 1854 made the first scientific observations of the Gegenschein. Brown, Ernest William. 1866–1938.

His General Catalogue of Double Stars remains a standard reference work. Campbell, William Wallace, 1862–1938. American astronomer, b. Ohio. He joined the staff at Lick Observatory in 1891, and was Director from 1900 until his retirement in 1930. His main work was in spectroscopy; he discovered 339 spectroscopic binaries (among them Capella), and determined the radial velocities of stars and of 125 nebulæ as well as carrying out spectroscopic observations of the planets. Cannon, Annie Jump. 1863–1941. Outstanding American woman astronomer, b. Delaware. In 1896 she joined the staff at Harvard College Observatory, where she worked unceasingly on the classification of stellar spectra; the present system is due largely to her. She also discovered five novæ and over 300 variable stars. From 1938 she was William Cranch Bond Astronomer. Carrington, Richard Christopher. 1826–75. English amateur astronomer, who had his Observatory at Redhill, Surrey.

German Jesuit mathematical teacher, who laid down the calendar reform of 1582 at the request of Pope Gregory. Copernicus, Nicolaus. 1473–1543. The Latinized name of Mikołaj Kopernik, b. Toru ́ n, Poland. He entered the Church, and became Canon of Frombork. He had a varied career, including medicine and also the defence of his country against the Teutonic Knights, but is remembered for his great book De Revolutionbus Orbium Cælestium , finally published during the last days of his life (he had previously withheld it because he was well aware of Church opposition). It was this book which revived the heliocentric theory according to which the Earth moves round the Sun, and sparked off the ‘Copernican revolution’ which came to its end with the work of Newton more than a century later.

He lost his sight in 1766, but this did not stop him from working; he undertook the complicated calculations mentally. Fabricius, David. 1564–1617. Dutch minister and amateur astronomer, who observed Mira Ceti in 1596 (though without recognizing it as a variable) and made pioneer telescopic observations, notably of the Sun. In 1617 he announced from the pulpit that he knew the identity of a member of his congregation who had stolen one of his geese – and he was presumably correct, since he was assassinated before he could divulge the name of the culprit! Fabricius, Johann. 1587–1616. Son of David Fabricius, and also a pioneer observer of the Sun by telescopic means; he discovered sunspots independently of Galileo and Scheiner. Fallows, Fearon. 1789–1831. English astronomer, b. Cumberland. He went to South Africa in 1821 as the first Director of the Cape Observatory.

He made the Dorpat refractor for Struve (the first telescope to be clock-driven) and also the K ̈ onigsberg heliometer. His comparatively early death was a tragedy for science. Galilei, Galileo. 1564–1642. The first great telescopic observer – and also the true founder of experimental mechanics. He worked successively at Pisa, Padua and Florence. The story of his remarkable telescopic discoveries (including the satellites of Jupiter, the phases of Venus and the gibbous aspect of Mars, the starry nature of the Milky Way and many more), and of how his defence of the Copernican theory brought him into conflict with the Church, is one of the most famous in scientific history. He was condemned by the Inquisition in 1633, and was kept a virtual prisoner in his villa at Arcetri; in his last years he also lost his sight. Galle, Johann Gottfried. 1812–1910.

German astronomer; from 1826 Professor of Astronomy, Munich. He was an assiduous observer of the Moon and planets, but his vivid imagination tended to discredit his work; at one stage he even reported the discovery of artificial structures on the Moon. He also proposed the impact theory of lunar crater formation. Gum, Colin. 1924–60. Australian astronomer, who carried out work of vital importance in the surveying of southern radio sources. The famous ‘Gum Nebula’ in Vela/Puppis is named after him. He was killed in a skiing accident at Zermatt in Switzerland. Hadley, John. 1682–1743. English astronomer; friend of Bradley.

While there, he made the measurements which enabled him to measure the parallax of α Centauri. In 1834 he became the first Astronomer Royal for Scotland. Heraclides of Pontus ( c. 388–315 BC) declared that the apparent daily rotation of the sky is due to the real rotation of the Earth. He also discovered that Mercury and Venus revolve round the Sun, not round the Earth. Heraclitus of Ephesus (born c. 544 BC) took fire to be the principal element, and maintained that the diameter of the Sun was about one foot. Herschel, Friedrich Wilhelm (always known as William Herschel). 1738–1822. Probably the greatest observer of all time. He was born in Hanover, but spent most of his life in England. He was the best telescope maker of his day, and in 1781 became famous by his discovery of the planet Uranus. He made innumerable discoveries of double stars, clusters and nebulæ; he found that many doubles are physically-associated or binary systems, and he was the first to give a reasonable idea of the shape of the Galaxy. He was knighted in 1816, and received every honour that THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY 495"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"A STRONOMERS the scientific world could bestow. George III appointed him King’s Astronomer (not Astronomer Royal). Herschel, Caroline. 1750–1848. William Herschel’s sister, and constant assistant in his astronomical work. She discovered eight comets. Herschel, John Frederick William. 1792–1871. William Herschel’s son. He graduated from Cambridge 1813 and from 1832–8 took a large telescope to the Cape to make the first really systematic observation of the southern heavens. He discovered 3347 double stars and 525 nebulæ, and may be said to have completed his father’s pioneering work. Hertzsprung, Ejnar. 1873–1967. Danish astronomer, who worked successively at Frederiksberg, Copenhagen, G ̈ ottingen, Mount Wilson and Leiden (Director Leiden Observatory from 1935). In 1905 he discovered the giant and dwarf subdivisions of late-type stars, and this led on to the compilation of H–R or Hertzsprung–Russell Diagrams, which are of fundamental importance in astronomy. Hevelius. 1611–87. The Latinized name of Johannes Hewelcke of Danzig (now Gda ́ nsk). From his private observatory he drew up a catalogue of 1500 stars, and observed planets, the Moon and comets, using the unwieldy long-focus, small aperture refractors of his day. His observatory was burned down in 1679, but he promptly constructed another. His original map of the Moon has been lost; tradition says that the copper engraving was melted down and made into a teapot after his death. Hind, John Russell. 1823–95. English astronomer, who discovered 11 asteroids, the 1848 nova in Ophiuchus, and his‘variablenebula’roundTTauri. Healsocomputedmany cometary orbits, and from 1853 was superintendent of the Nautical Almanac . Hipparchus. Fl. 140 BC. Great Greek astronomer, who lived in Rhodes. He drew up a star catalogue, later augmented by Ptolemy. Among his many discoveries was that of precession; he also constructed trigonometric tables. Unfortunately all his original works have been lost. Hoffmeister, Cuno. 1892–1967. He was born in Sonneberg, Thuringia, and after working at two German observatories founded the Sonneberg Observatory, in 1925. He was a specialist in variable star work, and discovered almost 10 000 new variables. He was also an authority on meteoritic astronomy. Hooke, Robert. 1653–1703. English scientific genius, contemporary with (though no friend of!) Newton. He built various astronomical instruments, and made some useful observations, including sketches of lunar craters. Horrocks, Jeremiah. 1619–41. English astronomer who, with his friend Crabtree, was the first to observe a transit of Venus (1639). He also worked on lunar theory. His early death was a great tragedy for science. Howse, Derek. 1919–98. Essentially a Naval officer (Lieutenant-Commander, who won the DSC during the war), Howse became Keeper of Astronomy and Navigation at the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich, retiring in 1982. He was the author of many books and papers on all aspects of navigational astronomy. Hubble, Edwin Powell. 1889–1953. American astronomer, who served in the Army during World War I and was also a qualified lawyer. In 1923, using the Mount Wilson 100 in reflector, he discovered short-period variables in the Andromeda Spiral, and proved the Spiral to be an independent galaxy. He also established the velocity/ distance relationship known as Hubble’s Law. Huggins, William. 1824–1910. Pioneer English spectroscopist, who had his private observatory at Tulse Hill, near London. Pioneer of stellar spectroscopy; he established that the irresolvable nebulæ are gaseous; he was the first to determine stellar radial motions by means of the Doppler shifts in their spectral lines, and carried out important solar and planetary work. He was knighted in 1897. Humason, Milton La Salle. 1891–1972. b. Minnesota. He was mainly self-taught, but joined the staff of Mount Wilson Observatory in 1920, and from then on worked closely with Hubble, studying the forms, spectra, radial motions and nature of the galaxies; he also photographed the spectra of supernovæ in external systems. In 1919 he carried out a photographic search for a trans Neptunian planet at the request of W. H. Pickering, who had made independent calculations similar to Lowell’s. Humason took several plates, but failed to locate the planet. When the plates were re-examined years later, after Pluto had been discovered at Flagstaff, it was found that Humason had recorded the planet twice – but once the image was masked by a star, and on the other occasion it fell on a flaw in the plate! 496 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"A STRONOMERS Huygens, Christiaan. 1629–95. Dutch astronomer; probably the best telescopic observer of his time. He discovered Saturn’s brightest satellite (Titan) in 1655, and was the first to realize that the curious appearance of the planet was due to a system of rings. He was also the first to see markings on Mars. His activities extended into many fields of science; in particular, he invented the pendulum clock. Innes, Robert Thorburn Ayton. 1861–1933. Scottish astronomer, who emigrated first to Australia (becoming a wine merchant) and then went to South Africa, as director of the Observatory at Johannesburg. He specialized in double star work, discovering more than 1500 new pairs; he also discovered Proxima Centauri, the nearest star beyond the Sun. Janssen, Pierre Jules C ́ esar. 1824–1907. French astronomer, who specialized in solar work (in 1870 he escaped from the besieged city of Paris by balloon to study a total eclipse). Independently of Lockyer, he discovered the means of observing the Sun’s chromosphere and prominences without waiting for an eclipse. From 1876 he was Director of the Meudon Observatory, and in 1904 published an elaborate solar atlas, containing more than 8000 photographs. The square at the entrance to the Meudon Observatory is still called the Place Janssen, and his statue is to be seen there. Jansky, Karl Guthe. 1905–49. American radio engineer, of Czech descent. He joined the Bell Telephone Laboratories, and was using an improvised aerial to investigate problems of static when he detected radio waves which he subsequently showed to come from the Milky Way. This was, in fact, the beginning of radio astronomy; but for various reasons Jansky paid little attention to it after 1937, and virtually abandoned the problem. Jeans, Sir James Hopwood. 1877–1946. English astronomer. He elaborated the plausible but now rejected theory of the tidal origin of the planets, but his major work was in connection with stellar constitution, in which he made notable advances. He was also an expert writer of popular scientific books, and was famous as a lecturer and broadcaster. Jeffreys, Sir Harold. 1892–1989. Though primarily a geophysicist, Jeffreys also made many important advances in astronomy, and it was he who first showed that the giant planets are not miniature suns. His great book, The Earth; its Origin, History and Physical Constitution (1924) was immensely influential. Jones, Sir Harold Spencer. 1890–1960. English astronomer (Astronomer Royal 1933–55). A Cambridge graduate, who was HM Astronomer at the Cape from 1923 until his appointment to Greenwich. From the Cape he carried out much important work, mainly in connection with star catalogues and stellar radial velocities. While Astronomer Royal he redetermined the solar parallax by means of the world-wide observations of Eros, and published several excellent popular books as well as technical papers. He played a major r ˆ ole in the removal of the main equipment from Greenwich to the new site at Herstmonceux, in Sussex, and himself transferred to Herstmonceux in 1948, though it was not until 1958 that the move was completed. He was knighted in 1943. Kant, Immanuel. 1724–1804. German philosopher, remembered astronomically for proposing a theory of the origin of the Solar System which had some points of resemblance to Laplace’s later Nebular Hypothesis. Kapteyn, Jacobus Corneleus. 1851–1922. Dutch astronomerandcosmologist. Hismostcelebrateddiscovery was that of ‘star-streaming’. Kepler, Johannes. 1571–1630. German astronomer, b. W ̈ urttemberg. He was the last assistant to Tycho Brahe, and after Tycho’s death used the mass of observations to establish his three Laws of Planetary Motion. He observed the 1604 supernova, and also several comets, as well as making improvements to the refracting telescope, but his main achievements were theoretical. He ranks with Copernicus and Galileo as one of the main figures in the story of the ‘Copernican revolution’. Kirch, Gottfried. 1639–1710. German astronomer; Director of the Berlin Observatory from 1705. He was one of the earliest of systematic observers of comets, star- clusters and variable stars. In 1686 he discovered the variability of χ Cygni. Kirchhoff, Gustav Robert. 1824–87. Professor of physics at Heidelberg. One of the greatest of German physicists, who explained the dark lines in the Sun’s spectrum. His great map of the solar spectrum was published from Berlin in 1860.

He drew attention to gaps in the asteroid belt, known today as the Kirkwood Gaps; they are due to the gravitational influence of Jupiter. Kuiper, Gerard P. 1905–73. Dutch-American astronomer, who made notable advances in planetary and lunar work and was deeply involved with the programmes of sending probes beyond the Earth. The first crater to be identified on Mercury from Mariner 10 was named in his honour. Kulik, Leonid. 1883–1942. Russian scientist, trained as a forester, who achieved fame because of his work in meteorite research. In particular, he led several expeditions to study the Tunguska object of 1908. He died in a German prison camp in 1942. Lacaille, Nicolas Louis de. 1713–62. French astronomer, who went to the Cape to draw up the first good southern-star catalogue. Lagrange, Joseph Louis de. 1736–1813. French mathematical genius, and author of the classic M ́ ecanique Analytique. He wrote numerous astronomical papers, dealing, among other topics, with the Moon’s libration and the stability of the Solar System. Laplace, PierreSimon. 1749–1827. Frenchmathematician who made great advances in dynamical astronomy. In 1796 he wrote Syst ́ eme du Monde , in which he outlined his Nebular Hypothesis of the origin of the planets. Discarded in its original form, but modern theories have many points of resemblance to it. Lassell, William. 1799–1880. English astronomer. He discovered Triton, Neptune’s larger satellite, and (independently of Bond) Hyperion, the 7th satellite of Saturn, as well as two satellites of Uranus (Ariel and Umbriel). He set up a 24 in reflector in Malta, and with it discovered 600 nebulæ. Leavitt, Henrietta Swan. 1868–1921. American woman astronomer, best remembered for her observations of Cepheids in the Small Magellanic Cloud (1912), based on photographs taken in S America; these led on to the discovery of the vital period-luminosity law for Cepheids. She also discovered four novæ, several asteroids, and over 2400 variable stars. Lema ˆ ıtre, Georges. 1894–1966. Belgian priest, who was a leading mathematician; from 1927, Professor at Louvain University. His most important paper, leading to what is now called the ‘Big Bang’ theory of the universe, appeared in 1927, but did not become well-known until publicized by Eddington three years later. During World War I Lema ˆ ıtre served in the Belgian Army, and won the Croix du Guerre. Le Monnier, Pierre Charles. 1715–99. French astronomer who was concerned in star cataloguing. He observed the planet Uranus several times, but did not check his observations, and missed the chance of a classic discovery. It was said that he never failed to quarrel with anyone whom he met! Le Verrier, Urbain Jean Joseph. 1811–77. French astronomer, whose calculations led in 1846 to the discovery of Neptune. He was an authority on meteors, and in 1867 computed the orbit of the Leonids. He also developed solar and planetary theory, and believed in the existence of a planet(Vulcan)closertotheSunthanMercury–nowknown to be a myth. He was forced to resign the Directorship of the Paris Observatory in 1870 because of his irritability, but was reinstated on the death by drowning of his successor, Delaunay. Levin, Boris Yuljevich. 1912–89. Born in Moscow. At first he was concerned with meteors, but then worked with O. Schmidt in developing his theories of the origin of the Solar System. He also made valuable contributions to cometary astronomy. Lexell, Anders John. 1740–84. Finnish astronomer, b. Ab ̈ o. He became Professor of Mathematics at St Petersburg. He discovered the periodical comet of 1770 (now lost), and was one of the first to prove that the object discovered by Herschel in 1781 was a planet rather than a comet. Lindsay, Eric Mervyn. 1907–74. Irish astronomer, Director of the Armagh Observatory from 1936 until his death. His main work was in connection with the Magellanic Clouds and with quasars. He had close connections with the Boyden Observatory in South Africa (where he had previously been assistant astronomer) and forged close links between it, Harvard, Dunsink (Dublin) and Armagh. He was an excellent lecturer on popular astronomy, and founded the Armagh Planetarium in 1966. Lockyer, Sir Joseph Norman. 1836–1920.

The map was completed 40 years later by Julius Schmidt. Lomonosov, Mikhail. 1711–65. Russian astronomer; he was also termed ‘the founder of Russian literature’. His father was a fisherman. In 1735 he went to the University of St Petersburg, and then to Marburg in Germany to study chemistry. On his return to Russia in 1741 he insulted some of his colleagues at the St Petersburg Academy and was imprisoned for several months, during which time he wrote two of his most famous poems. How ever, he later becameProfessorofChemistryatStPetersburg, andin1746 became a Secretary of State. He drew up the first accurate map of the Russian Empire, described a ‘solar furnace’, and investigated,electrical phenomena. He also studied auroræ. In 1761 he observed the transit of Venus, and rightlyconcludedthatVenushasaconsiderableatmosphere. His most important contribution was his championship of the Copernican theory and of Newton’s theories, neither of which had really taken root in Russia before Lomonosov’s work. Lowell, Percival. 1855–1916. American astronomer, who founded the Lowell Observatory at Flagstaff, Arizona, in 1894. He paid great attention to Mars, and believed the ‘canals’ to be artificial waterways. His calculations led to the discovery of the planet Pluto, though the planet was not actually found until 1930 – by Clyde Tombaugh, at the LowellObservatory. Lowellhimselfwasagreatastronomer who did much for science, and it is regrettable that he is today remembered mainly because of his erroneous theories about the Martian canals. Lyot, Bernard. 1897–1953. Great French astronomer; Director of the Meudon Observatory. He made many advances in instrumental techniques, and invented the coronagraph, which enables the inner corona to be studied at times of non-eclipse. He died suddenly while taking part in an eclipse expedition to Africa. Maclear, Sir Thomas. 1794–1879. Irish astronomer, who in 1833 succeeded Henderson as HM Astronomer at the Cape.

He retired in 1865, and spent his last years in Hanover. Maraldi, Giacomo Filippo. 1665–1729. Italian astronomer; nephew of G. D. Cassini. He was renowned for his observations of the planets, particularly Mars, and assisted his uncle at the Paris Observatory. Maskelyne, Nevil. 1732–1811. English astronomer (Astronomer Royal 1765–1811). Educated at Cambridge; he then went to St Helena, at the suggestion of Bradley, to observe the transit of Venus, and decided to make a serious study of navigation.

A leading planetary geologist, who was closely involved with the NASA missions, playing a key r ˆ ole in their planning. He spent his entire career with the US Geological Survey. McCrea, Sir William. 1904–99. Much of McCrea’s career was spent in mathematical departments, and his first astronomical appointment – at the University of Sussex – came in 1966. However, his interest in astronomy dated back much further. In 1929 he was able to confirm that hydrogen is dominant in the atmosphere of the Sun, and he made many contributions to astrophysics following his graduation from Cambridge in 1923. He was also active in the field of theoretical cosmology. McVittie, George. 1904–88. British astronomer, born in Smyrna (his mother was Greek). He graduated from Edinburgh, and worked in England and America. He was a pioneer in studies of relativity, and made many important contributions to cosmology.

English clergyman, and an amateur astronomer who made the first suggestion that many double stars may be physically associated or binary systems. Milne, Edward Arthur. 1896–1950. English astronomer, who graduated from Cambridge and then went successively to Manchester and Oxford. He made important contributions to astrophysics, and developed his theory of ‘kinematic relativity’, which was for a time regarded as an alternative to general Einsteinian relativity. Minkowski, Rudolf. 1895–1976. German astronomer, who went to Mount Wilson in 1935 and remained there. He was one of the leading authorities on novæ and planetary nebulæ, and after the war became a pioneer in the new science of radio astronomy. His studies of rapidly-moving gases in radio galaxies led to the rejection of the ‘colliding galaxies’ theory. Mitchell, Maria. 1812–88. America’s first woman astronomer. She was the first woman to be elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; she also discovered a comet. Montanari, Geminiario. 1633–87.

American astronomer, for some years head of the American Nautical Almanac office. His chief work was in mathematical astronomy, to which he made valuable contributions. He is also remembered as the man who proved to his own satisfaction that no heavier- than-air machine could ever fly! Newton, Sir Isaac. 1643–1727. Probably the greatest of all astronomers. To list all his contributions here would be pointless; suffice to say that his Principia , published in 1687, has been described as the greatest mental effort ever made by one man. In addition to his scientific work, he sat briefly in Parliament, and served as Master of the Mint. He was knighted in 1705, and on his death was buried in Westminster Abbey. Olbers, Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias. 1758–1840. German doctor; also a skilled amateur astronomer; established his private observatory in Bremen. He discovered two of the first four asteroids (Pallas and Vesta) and rediscovered the first (Ceres); he carried out important work in connection with cometary orbits, and discovered a periodical comet which has a period of 69.5 years, and last returned in 1956. Olbers also wrote about his celebrated paradox: ‘Why is it dark at night?’ Oort, Jan Hendrick. 1900–92. Outstanding Dutch astronomer, who interpreted Kapteyn’s two streams of stars as evidence that the Galaxy is rotating. With C. A. Muller, he confirmed the detection by Ewen and Purcell of the 21 cm background radiation. He proposed that comets come from a huge spherical shell surrounding the Solar System, now known as the Oort Cloud. Parmenides of Elea (second half of the 6th century BC) believed the stars to be of compressed fire, but agreed that the Earth was spherical, and in equilibrium because it was equidistant from all points on the sphere representing the universe. Penston, Michael Victor. 1943–90. He was born in London, but spent much of his career at Cambridge. He made many contributions to astrophysics, and in 1983 was able to ‘weigh’ a black hole in the centre of the galaxy NGC 4151. He described himself as one of the LAGS – Lovers of Active Galaxies! Sadly, he died in 1990 after a long and brave fight against cancer. Perrine, Charles Dillon. 1867–1951. American astronomer, who discovered two of Jupiter’s satellites as well as nine comets. He worked at the Lick Observatory until 1909, when he became Director of the Cordoba Observatory in Argentina, where he constructed a 30 in reflector and made many observations of southern galaxies. He also planned a major star catalogue, but was politically unpopular, and after a narrow escape from assassination he retired (1936). 500 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"A STRONOMERS Peters, Christian Heinrich Friedrich. 1813–90.

American astronomer; for 43 years, from 1876, Director of the Harvard College Observatory. He concentrated upon photometry, variable stars, and above all stellar spectra; in the famous Draper Catalogue, the stars were classified according to their spectra. During his r ́ egime the Harvard Observatory was modernized, and a southern outstation was setup at Arequipa in Peru. Pickering, William Henry. 1858–1938. Brother of E. C. Pickering, who worked with him at Harvard and also served for a while as astronomer in charge of the Arequipa out-station. In 1898 he discovered Saturn’s 9th satellite, Phœbe.

Proctor paid considerable attention to the planets, and constructed a map of Mars. Ptolemy (Claudius Ptolemaeus). c. 120–180. The ‘Prince of Astronomers’, who lived and worked in Alexandria. Nothing is known about his life, but his great work has come down to us through its Arab translation (the Almagest ). Ptolemy’s star catalogue was based on that of Hipparchus but with many contributions of his own; he also brought the geocentric system to its highest state of perfection, so that it is always known as the Ptolemaic theory. He constructed a reasonable map of the Mediterranean world, and even showed Britain, though it is true that he joined Scotland on to England in a back-to-front position. Purbach, Georg von. 1423–61. Austrian astronomer, who became a professor at Vienna in 1450. He founded a new school of astronomy, compiled tables, and began to write an Epitome of Astronomy based on Ptolemy’s Almagest . After Purbach’s premature death, the book was completed by his friend and pupil Regiomontanus. Pythagoras. c. 572–500 BC.

Italian Jesuit astronomer, who taught at Padua and Bologna. He was a pioneer telescopic observer, and drew up a lunar map, inaugurating the system of nomenclature which is still in use. Oddly enough, he never accepted the Copernican system. Ridley, Harold Bytham. 1919–95. Harold Ridley, born in Outer London, was one of Britain’s outstanding amateur astronomers; he specialized in meteor work, and obtained many meteor spectra. He was for many years Director of the Meteor Section of the British Astronomical Association (and was its President 1976–78). Robinson, Romney. 1792–1882. Irish astronomer, who was Director of the Armagh Observatory from 1823 to his death. He published the Armagh catalogue of over 5000 stars, and made many other contributions; he also invented the cup anemometer. It is on record that when the railway company planned to build a line close to Armagh, Robinson managed to have it diverted, since he maintained that the trains would shake his telescopes! Rømer, Ole. 1644–1710. Danish astronomer. In 1675 he used the eclipse times of Jupiter’s satellites to make an accurate measurement of the velocity of light. In 1681 he became Director of the Copenhagen Observatory. Among his numerous inventions are the transit instrument and the meridian circle. Ronan, Colin Alastair. 1920–95. Colin Ronan was essentially an astronomical historian. During the war he served with the Army, and rose to the rank of Major; he made a very important contribution to the war effort, inventing a new method of blooming lenses to increase light transmission. He wrote many books, and was an outstanding lecturer; he was for many years Director of the Historical Section of the British Astronomical Association (President 1989–91). He was an active researcher, and produced plausible evidence that the telescope was invented in England over half a century before Galileo’s time. Rosse, 3rd Earl of. 1800–67. Irish amateur astronomer, who in 1845 completed the building of a 72 in reflector and erected it at his home at Birr Castle. The 72 in with its metal mirror, was much the largest telescope ever built up to that time, and has now (2000) been brought back into use. His greatest discovery was that many of the galaxies are spiral in form. Rosse, 4th Earl of. 1840–1908. Continued his father’s work, and was also the first man to measure the tiny quantity of heat coming from the Moon. Rowland, Henry Augustus. 1848–1901. American scientist; Professor of Physics in Baltimore from 1876. His great map of the solar spectrum was published in 1895–7; it showed 20 000 absorption lines. Runcorn, S. Keith. 1922–98. Born in Southport, and graduated in engineering from Cambridge in 1942. After a period working at radar research, he joined Manchester University, and carried out major researches into palæomagnetism and all other aspects of planetary magnetic phenomena. Russell, Henry Norris. 1877–1957. American astronomer; Director, Princeton Observatory from 1908. He devoted much of his energy to studies of stellar constitution and evolution, and independently of Hertzsprung he discovered the giant and dwarf sub-divisions of stars of late spectral type. This led on to the H–R or Hertzsprung–Russell Diagram, in which luminosity (or the equivalent) is plotted against spectral type. Rutherfurd, Lewis Morris. 1816–92. American barrister, who gave up his profession to devote himself to astronomy. 502 THE DATA BOOK OF ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"A STRONOMERS A pioneer in astronomical photography, his pictures of the Moon were outstanding; his ruled solar gratings for solar spectra were the best of their time. Ryle, Sir Martin. 1918–84. British pioneer of radar and radio astronomy. He graduated from Oxford, and then went to Cambridge as Professor of Radio Astronomy. In 1972 he succeeded Woolley as Astronomer Royal. He developed the technique of aperture synthesis, and made many very important contributions. Sagan, Carl. 1934–96. Carl Sagan was born in Brookyln, and spent all his career in the United States. He made major contributions to astrophysics, and was also a leading member of the Planetary Society, but is perhaps best remembered for his popular works, and in particular the best-selling television series ‘Cosmos’. Sadly, he died of cancer when still in his early fifties. The Pathfinder station on the surface of Mars was named in his honour. Scheiner, Christoph. 1575–1650. German Jesuit, who was for some time a professor of mathematics in Rome. He discovered sunspots independently of his contemporaries, and wrote a book, Rosa Ursina , which contains solar drawings and observations for the years 1611–25. He was unfriendly towards Galileo, and played a rather discreditable part in the events leading up to Galileo’s trial and condemnation. Schiaparelli, Giovanni Virginio. 1835–4910. Italian astronomer, who graduated from Turin and became Director of the Brera Observatory in Milan. He discovered the connection between meteors and comets, but his most famous work was in connection with the planets. It was he who first drew attention to the ‘canal network’ on Mars, in 1877. Schlesinger, Frank. 1871–1943. American astronomer, b. New York. His main work was in connection with stellar parallaxes. He was Director successively of the Yale and Allegheny Observatories, and was responsible for the Yale ‘southern station’ in Johannesburg. His major works, GeneralCatalogueofParallaxes anditssupplement, dealt with more than 2000 stars. He also pioneered the determination of star positions by using wide-angle cameras. Schmidt, Julius (actually Johann Friedrich Julius). 1825–84. German astronomer, who became Director of the Athens Observatory in 1858 and spent most of his life in Greece. He concentrated upon lunar work, producing an elaborate map (based on Lohrmann’s early work) and making great improvements in selenography.

Unfortunately many of his notebooks were lost in 1813, with the destruction of his observatory by the invading French troops. Schwabe, Heinrich. 1789–1875. German apothecary, who became a noted amateur astronomer concentrating on the Sun. His great discovery was that of the 11-year sunspot cycle. Schwarzschild, Karl. 1873–1916. German astronomer, who worked successively at Vienna, G ̈ ottingen and (as Observatory Director) Potsdam. His early work dealt with photometry, but he was also a pioneer of theoretical astrophysics. Military service during World War I broke his health and led to his premature death. Schwarzschild, Martin. 1912–97. German astronomer, who spent much of his career at Princeton University in the United States. He carried out much original research with regard to stellar structure and evolution. Secchi, Angelo. 1818–78. Italian Jesuit astronomer; one of the great pioneers of stellar spectroscopy, classifying the stars into four types (a system superseded later by that of Harvard). He was also an authority in solar work, and his planetary observations were equally outstanding. Seyfert, Carl. 1911–60. American astronomer, who concentrated upon studies of galaxies. In 1942 he drew attention to those galaxies with very condensed nuclei, now always termed Seyfert galaxies. Shajn, Grigorij Abramovich. 1892–1956. After serving in the Russian Army during World War I he then joined the staff of the Pulkovo Observatory, working upon meteoric astronomy. In 1924 he became Director of the Simeis Observatory, and began his work on stellar spectroscopy.

Shapley, Harlow. 1885–1972. Great American astronomer, who began his main work at Princeton under H N Russell. In 1914 he advanced the pulsation theory of Cepheid variables, and was soon able to use the variables in globular clusters to give the first accurate picture of the shape and size of the Galaxy. In 1921 he became Director of the Harvard College Observatory. In later years he concentrated upon studies of galaxies and upon the international aspect of astronomy. He was also an excellent lecturer, and a skilled writer of popular books. Shklovskii, Iosif. 1916–85. He graduated from Moscow University, and became professor there, later heading the radio astronomy department at the Sternberg Institute. He specialized in extraterrestrial radio sources, and showed that the emission from the Crab Nebula is synchrotron radiation. With Carl Sagan, he wrote about ‘intelligent life in the universe’. Shoemaker, Eugene. 1928–97. American astronomer/ geologist, who became the leading expert on meteoritics and impact craters; he was deeply involved in all the earlier planetary missions. He was also a devoted hunter of comets and near-Earth asteroids. He was killed in a car accident in Australia; subsequently his ashes were scattered on the surface of the Moon. Smyth, William Henry. 1788–1865. English naval officer, rising to the rank of Admiral, who in 1830 established a private observatory at Bedford and made numerous astronomical observations. He is best remembered for his famous book Cycle of Celestial Objects . Smyth, Piazzi (actually Charles Piazzi). 1819–1900. The son of Admiral Smyth. Astronomer Royal for Scotland from 1844 until his death. He was a skilled astronomer who carried out much valuable work, including spectroscopic examinations of the Zodiacal Light, but he was also an eccentric who wrote a large and totally valueless volume about the significance of the Great Pyramid. Sosigenes. Greek astronomer, who flourished about 46 BC. He was entrusted by Julius Cæsar with the reform of the calendar. Nothing is known about his life. South, James. 1785–1867. English amateur astronomer, who founded a private observatory in Southwark and collaborated with John Herschel in studies of double stars. In 1822 he observed an occultation of a star by Mars, and the virtually instantaneous disappearance convinced him that the Martian atmosphere must be extremely tenuous. Spitzer, Lyman. 1914–97. American astrophysicist, who influenced several generations of researchers through his writing and lecturing as well as his own personal contributions. He was founder and first Director of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, the leader of the group developing the Copernicus satellite. Sp ̈ orer, Friedrich Wilhelm Gustav. 1822–95.

He concentrated mainly upon the Sun, and discovered the variation in latitude of spot zones over the course of a solar cycle (Sporer’s Law). Steavenson, William Herbert. 1894–1975. Steavenson was never a professional astronomer; he was a medical doctor whose practice was in Outer London. He was an expert observer, and one of the few amateurs to serve as President of the Royal Astronomical Society (1957–9). His knowledge of telescopes and optics was encyclopædic, and his advice was often sought by professional astronomers. Strømgren, Bengt. 1908–87. Born in Sweden, but raised in Denmark. He became Director of the Royal Copenhagen Observatory in succession to his father Elias. He went to America to direct the Yerkes and McDonald Observatories during the 1950s, returning to Denmark in 1967.

He went to Dorpat in Estonia and in 1818 became Director of the Observatory. Using the 9 in Fraunhofer refractor – the first telescope to be clock-driven – he began his classic work on double stars. In 1839 he went to Pulkova, to become director of the new observatory set up by Tsar Nicholas. Here he continued his double-star work, and his Mensuræ Micrometricæ gives details of over 3000 pairs. Strove also measured the parallax of Vega; his value was announced in 1840. Struve, Otto (Wilhelm). 1819–1905. Son of F. G. W. Strove; b. Dorpat. He became assistant to his father, accompanying him to Pulkova. He continued his father’s work, and became a leading authority on double stars.

In 1959 he began a new career as the first Director of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, but ill-health forced his resignation in 1962. He was a brilliant astrophysicist, dealing mainly with spectroscopic binaries, stellar rotation and interstellar matter; he was also an author of popular books. He is (so far!) the last of the famous Strove astronomers. It is notable that all four were in succession awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Societ y – a sequence unique in astronomical history. Swift, Lewis. 1820–1913.

Greek astronomer, who made some accurate measurements of star positions; one of these (of Spica) enabled Hipparchus, 150 years later, to demonstrate the precession of the equinoxes. Tombaugh, Clyde. 1906–97. While still a young amateur, Tombaugh was called to the Lowell Observatory to search for ‘Planet X’, and in 1930 he discovered Pluto. He remained at the Lowell Observatory for many years, and searched for further planets and minor Earth satellites, although without success. During the war he worked at White Sands, developing telescopic methods of tracking ballistic missiles. He then went to Las Cruces university, where he remained for the rest of his career, latterly as Professor Emeritus; he was a tireless and inspiring teacher. Turner, Herbert Hall. 1861–1930. English astronomer who played an important r ˆ ole in the organization and preparation of the International Astrographic Chart. In 1903 he discovered Nova Geminorum. Tycho Brahe. 1546–1601. The great Danish observer – probably the best of pre-telescopic times. He studied the supernova of 1572 and from 1576 to 1596 worked at his observatory at Hven, an island in the Baltic, making amazingly accurate measurements of star positions and the movements of the planets, particularly Mars. His observatory – Uraniborg – became a scientific centre, but Tycho was haughty and tactless (during his student days he had part of his nose sliced off in a duel, and made himself a replacement out of gold, silver and wax!), and after quarrels with the Danish Court he left Hven and went to Prague as Imperial Mathematician to the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph II. Here he was joined by Kepler, who acted as his assistant. When Tycho died, Kepler came into possession of the Hven observations, and used them to prove that the Earth moves round the Sun – something which Tycho himself could never accept. Ulugh Beigh (more properly Ulugbek). 1394–1449. GrandsonoftheOrientalconquerorTamerlane.

Greek philosopher, b. Colophon. His astronomical theories sound strange today; an infinitely thick flat Earth, a new Sun each day, and celestial bodies which – apart from the Moon – were made of fire! Zach, Franz Xavier von. 1754–1832. Hungarian baron, who became renowned as an amateur astronomer. He published tables of the Sun and Moon, and was one of the chief organizers of the ‘Celestial Police’ who banded together to hunt for the supposed planet between Mars and Jupiter.

An optical instrument making use of two mirrors, one of which is fixed, while the other is movable and is mounted parallel to the Earth’s axis; as the Earth rotates, the light from the star (or other object being observed) is caught by the rotatable mirror and is reflected in a fixed direction on to the second mirror. The result is that the eyepiece of the instrument need not move at all. Collapsar. The end product of a very massive star, which has collapsed and has surrounded itself with a black hole. Colour index. The difference between a star’s visual magnitude and its photographic magnitude.
