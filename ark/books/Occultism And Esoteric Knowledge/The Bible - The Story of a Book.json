It would be timely to call attention to Syrian Christianity. In 1818 Thomas Yeates, under the title Indian Church History, describes his volume as an ac- count of the first planting of the Gospel in Syria, Mesopotamia, and India; with an accurate relation of the first Christian missions in China. The work was long out of print when it came to the attention of Elizabeth A. Gordon, who caused it to be reprinted with remarkable notes and commentaries by herself under the title Asian Cristology and the Mahayana in 1921. This book is also extremely scarce. Jesus had authorized his apostles to disseminate his doctrines throughout the world. The labor was first entrusted to the Christian converts in the mid- dle years of the first century. Yeates points out that the evangelizing resources in those days were greater than has generally been suspected. There were the twelve apostles invested with supreme power pertaining to the government of the church. Next in order were the seventy-two disciples corresponding in number and dignity with the elders of Israel. The third order was the five hundred witnesses who beheld the Ascension of the Lord. These are referred to as apostles, elders, and brethren. And they wrote letters by them after this matter; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Anti- och and Syria and Cilicia. (Acts 15:23) A considerable summary of the labors of these three groups is set forth in the Acts of the Apostles. From the accounts in the Four Gospels, it is obvious that Jesus had a large following and a considerable sphere of influence. After his Resurrection and the miracle of the Pentecost, his followers increased in number and carried the glad tidings to the nations of the East. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all PART ONE"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"• 6 • Manly Palmer Hall things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen. (Matthew 28:19-20) This was according to the prophecy of Isaiah, For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory. And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles. (Isaiah 66:18-19) The apostles did not travel alone, but were accompanied by two or more of the disciples. After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come. (Luke 10:1) These teachers were themselves from different countries and could speak a number of the Eastern languages and dialects. Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: And when he had found him [Paul], he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first Antioch. (Acts 11:25-26) In the beginning the apostles remained in Jerusalem for some time, but under persecution were forced to depart from the holy city. There is no lon- ger any doubt that the apostle Thomas reached India, established a church there, and was martyred by fanatics. St. Thomas, often referred to as Doubt- ing Thomas because he insisted on placing his hand on the wound in the side of Jesus after the Resurrection, is said to have had vision to build a palace for the great king of the Indies. He preached in Persia, Ethiopia, and India. Marco Polo writing in the thirteenth century says that the body of the apostle Thomas was entombed in Malabar and that the tomb was frequently visited by both Christians and Moslems and that earth taken from this site is believed to have miraculous powers. Christian communities with duly conse- crated bishops were scattered throughout the Near, Central, and Far East.

(Acts 20:4) It is also known that these missionaries carried with them sacred writings including versions of the Scriptures and church ordinances. It is possible that the account of the life of Jesus found by Nicolas Notovitch in the Himis Con- vent near the foot of Mt. Everest is a genuine relic of Syrian Christianity (See The Unknown Life of Jesus Christ ). It was established by Eusebius that the bish- ops who assembled at Nicaea brought with them sacred writings treasured in their churches and convents. There also seems to be proof that in some of the Buddhist communities the Syrian monks were accepted as Buddhist bonzes, preaching a form of the Mahayana School of Buddhist philosophy. This may certainly account for a number of symbols and teachings common to both religions. It is interesting to note that John, Bishop of Persia and Great India, was one of the three hundred and eighteen delegates who framed and signed the Nicene Creed at the Council of Nicaea, 325 A.D. This brings into focus a generally neglected history of Christianity during the nearly three centuries between the Crucifixion of Christ and the Nicaean Council. There are rea- sonably accurate accounts of Greek and Latin church histories, but there has been a tendency to focus attention on the Western migrations of the faith. Until the so-called conversion of Constantine, the Roman Empire persecuted Christian converts and the apostles Peter and Paul were martyred in Rome. It should be noted however that Joseph of Arimathea established a Christian community at Glastonbury, England, in the first century. The patriarchs of Alexandria together with other parts of Egypt and Ethio- pia trace their descent from the apostle Mark who established a church in Alexandria, was martyred there; and his remains were later carried to Italy and placed in the Cathedral of St. Mark in Venice. Mosaics of St. Mark’s Cathe- dral in Venice and scriptures on the walls caused the whole edifice, according to Mr. John Ruskin, to be called the Book of Common Prayer. Pantaenus, the venerable teacher and predecessor of Clement of Alexandria in the Catecheti- cal School of that city, was sent to “India” circa 189 A.D. and found there a copy of St. Matthew’s Gospel which he took to Egypt and, according to Eusebius, it was still extant in St. Jerome’s day (See Asian Cristology and the Mahayana ). John Kesson of the British Museum in his book The Cross and the Dragon , London: 1854, states that the Chaldean or Syrian Christians spread so rapidly"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"• 8 • Manly Palmer Hall The apostle Thomas from an engraving by Albrecht Durer, dated 1514.

Nestorius, who flour- ished in the fifth century A.D., was an early victim of the political machinery of the Western church. The Nestorians sought refuge in the Far East and the great Nestorian stone setting forth the life of Christ probably dates from about 780 A.D. and summarizes the Gospel account in Chinese characters and additional writings in Syrian. After the period of the Nestorian ministry, we hear very little in the Far East until Matteo Ricci, who reached China in 1583 A.D. He converted the Prime Minister and his daughter who versified the Gospel and sent blind men all over China to sing. THE NICAEAN COUNCIL Constantine Magnus was neither the best nor the worst of the Roman em- perors, but he was probably the most practical. He and Licinius issues the Edict of Milan (313 A.D.) proclaiming the right of the Christians to follow the mode of religion which appeared best to them. After his victory over Licinius in 325, Constantine became the undisputed ruler over the far flung Roman Empire. At this time he stated that he looked forward to years of peace and security. Regardless of the motives imputed to him by others, the emperor acted with dignity, courtesy, and restraint in the delicate task of at- tempting to arbitrate the theological differences which had arisen among the Christian groups. As early as 318 A.D., the imperial peace was disturbed by a bitter feud that arose between Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria, and Arius, one of the presbyters under his jurisdiction. Hard words passed between Alexander and Arius after the latter had refused to sign a statement that Christ was of the same divine nature as God. Arius was an outstanding intellectual and ap- parently liked to argue for the pleasure of controversy. He was a poplar man in his community, in the course of time disrupted the Christian groups in Alexandria, and became leader of a considerable following. The unhappy dis- turbance soon spread throughout the Christian church which at that time had no unified leadership. Constantine, having inherited this dilemma with the purple, assumed the unpopular role of arbitrator or peacemaker. He was certainly justified in in- tervening as absolute ruler of the Roman Empire before the situation reached"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"• 10 • Manly Palmer Hall political importance. In this emergency, he dispatched his ecclesiastical advi- sor, the Bishop of Cordova, to Alexander and Arius stating in substance that the squabble was of no importance and that the silly procedures were suitable only to children and not to priests or reasonable men. He added also that he hoped the matter could be settled so that he could continue to have quiet days and nights and enjoy the pure joys of life. It has been well observed that Constantine wrote as a tolerant and liberal- minded statesman, but he certainly was not properly informed on delicate matters of theology. He made light of an issue which to those involved was no trivial matter. Obviously, dignitaries of the church resented being accused of silly actions and likened to unruly children, especially by a pagan. It was evident that to Constantine Christianity was still only one of the imperial burdens. He could only hope that the weight of his temporal authority could be used in some way to neutralize the friction. Nothing remained to be done but to call a general council of the entire Christian church. This Constantine resolved to do, possibly at the recommendation of Hosius, the Bishop of Cordova, who had failed in his mission of reconciliation. The council was therefore schedule to meet at Nicaea (Iznik) in north- west Turkey the following spring, and Constantine expressed his decision to preside personally over the assembly. He pointed out that the clergy was in charge of the internal affairs of the church, but that he as emperor had been appointed by God to be bishop over the larger world with its temporal re- sponsibilities. The general Council of Nicaea assembled in May, 325 A.D. More than three hundred bishops accompanied by their priests and deacons attended the meetings. The Eastern church was more strongly represented than the West- ern group as the Bishop of Rome did not attend but sent two legates. It was a strange and incongruous group that finally assembled in the great hall of the imperial palace. After all the bishops had duly assembled, the emperor him- self made a spectacular entrance. He was robed in gold and purple and richly adorned with jewelry and precious stones. A chair of gold had been made for his convenience and he presided with full imperial grandeur. He apparently considered it advisable to impress the entire assembly with the importance of the occasion. It has been reported that Constantine blushed when he entered the great hall and appeared ill at ease. There are several possible explanations for his lack of poise. He was still a pagan, presiding over a Christian council"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"• 11 • The Bible, the Story of a Book for the purpose of preventing, if possible, a religious war. The notion that he was overcome by religious humility in the presence of so august an assem- bly is most unlikely. If Constantine was sincerely interested in the future of Christianity, his embarrassment could be explained by the fact that he carried in his hands a collection of documents consisting of accusations and cross- accusations that had been privately forwarded to him by the various bishops accusing each other of a variety of derelictions. As a pagan Constantine made an opening address in which he emphasized the importance of Christian fel- lowship among the leaders of their churches, and reminded all that were as- sembled there and were true followers of Christ that they should forgive one another, serve God, and act with charity and love. Constantine’s presence at the council has been subject to considerable criti- cism. Some hold that he should never have convoked an ecumenical assembly of this kind, and that in so doing he violated the spiritual prerogatives of the church. Actually, however, he seems to have presided in an honorary capacity and took little part, if any, in the theological discussions. The real heads of the council on a religious level were probably Hosius of Cordova and the papal Early engraving, source unknown, representing the Emperor Constantine embracing Christian bishops."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"• 12 • Manly Palmer Hall legates, Victor and Vicentius. Nor is it clear whether Constantine was acting under pressure of the pope, Silvester I. In any event, Constantine involved himself in an unhappy situation, scarcely inclined to excite his admiration. He listened from his golden throne to a series of bitter personal quarrels and re- criminations. Arius arose and expressed his own opinions so vehemently that many of the bishops put their hands over their ears in horror. It was finally resolved to examine the Scriptures with regard to the controversial points. Two men of the same name more or less dominated the proceedings. One was Eusebius of Nicomedia, a Greek bishop inclined to favor the opinions of Arius. The other was Eusebius of Caesarea, the ecclesiastical historian. At the Council of Nicaea he led the moderates, who as their name indicated, repre- sented a middle party and submitted the first draft of the old Nicene Creed, which was adopted with certain important changes. Eusebius of Caesarea was close to Constantine, but critics of the council doubt his basic integrity. To say the least, he was determined to retain the friendship of Constantine. The em- peror, realizing that the council was hopelessly entangled in its controversial issues, recommended the formulation of the basic creed to which all the vari- ous bishops would subscribe and thus have a common and mutually accept- able statement of orthodoxy. Eusebius of Caesarea offered the baptismal creed of his own church as a pattern and, after certain phrases had been inserted, the creed was read to the council and signed by the majority of those present. Twenty canons are attributed to the Nicaean Council. Most of these apply primarily to the clergy. Canon 17 forbade clerics to lend money at interest. The weighty matters having progressed as far as possible, Constantine took the occasion to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of his accession and in- vited the bishops to a splendid banquet at the end of which he bestowed rich presents upon them. Constantine had placed all facilities of transportation and communication at the disposal of the delegates, and it is noted that the banquet was the one occasion where there were no absentees. The records of the Nicaean Council are regrettably in complete. Of this Mosheim writes, “The council assembled by Constantine at Nice, is one of the most famous and interesting events that are presented to us in ecclesiastical history; and yet, what is most surprising, scarcely any part of the history of the church has been unfolded with such negligence, or rather passed over with such rapidity.” He adds that no authentic acts of its famous sessions are now extant. Specific details are lacking concerning the selection of the various books which were"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"• 13 • The Bible, the Story of a Book brought together to form the New Testament. According to one account, the matter was solved by miraculous intervention. There seems to be very little to indicate that the canon or the controversy concerning the authority of the various books of the New Testament was actually solved at the Nicaean Council. There is one report on this by Pappas, but in all fairness it must be noted that supporting testimony is lacking. However, a more prosaic version implies that they were chosen by ballot. In 315 A.D., Eusebius of Caesarea, in his ecclesiastical history gives a catalog of the New Testament books. His list is approximately the same as that accepted in modern times. Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem, accepted the same classification with the exception of omitting the Book of Revelation. In 367 A.D. Athanasius published his list. In all probability, the accepted list was approved with some reservations as early as Origen, 210 A.D. The bishops who assembled at Nicaea brought most of their treasured scriptural writings with them. The fate of the rejected works is unknown. It is believed that Eusebius pointed out to Constantine the di- lapidated condition of the treasured scrolls and parchments. In any event, the emperor saw the wisdom of providing the various congregations with a comprehensive text of the accepted writings. He therefore sponsored the preparation of fifty large and fine volumes to be prepared for the use of the principal churches in Constantinople. This is probably the first occasion in which the two testaments were united in one volume. The text was in Greek, and there is a strong probability that the Codex Sinaiticus and the Codex Vaticanus were produced at this time. THE GREAT CODICES OF THE BIBLE The New Testament in the surviving form is known only through early Greek manuscripts of which the earliest are believed to date from the fourth century A.D. Three important manuscripts were probably among those commissioned by Constantine. They are the Codex Vaticanus (Codex B), Codex Alexandrinus (Codex A), and the Codex Sinaiticus (Codex Aleph). The first of these is in the Vatican Library and the other two are in the British Museum. These manu- scripts are called uncials , because they are written entirely in capital letters. There is a strong possibility that the three codices mentioned above were written in Alexandria in Egypt. At that time, the Jewish and Christian com- munities shared a common interest in spiritual matters. Considering many"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"• 14 • Manly Palmer Hall other examples of their preoccupation with Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, and cabalism, such a marriage of right minds would have been most appropri- ate. Furthermore, Alexandria was an important center of classical publishing. Organized groups of scribes would copy almost any manuscript available in the Alexandrian libraries for a reasonable fee. The final desctruction of these libraries may well have destroyed precious biblical manuscripts. This concept of their Egyptian origin gained some support from The Mount Sinai Manu- script of the Bible . “One of the arguments used in favour of the theory that the manuscript was written in Egypt is the sporadic occurrence in it, both in the text itself and in the earlier corrections, of an omega of a very curious shape ( as against the usual ω ). This very rare form is found in one or two papyri from Egypt, notably in Papyrus 28 of the John Rylands Library, Mancanus, it appears to be unknown elsewhere.” The Greek omega resembles a number three lying on its back. The unusual form referred to in the above quotation has the central stem extended upward to resemble a trident. There is a collection of sayings attributed to Jesus not included in the Gos- pels. These fragments are usually described as the Logia, or words recorded or remembered by those who heard the Master speak. It has been customary to assume that they were derived from manuscripts of the Gospels which have not survived to modern time. Possibly the earliest reference to these sayings is found in the second century writings of Bishop Papias of Hierapolis and further “sayings” appear in other writings of early church theologians as late as the fourth century. In our library we have a small book published by the Oxford University Press under the title New Sayings of Jesus and Fragment of a Lost Gospel by Bernard P. Grenfell, D. Litt., M.A., and Arthur S. Hunt, D. Litt., M.A., Lon- don: 1904. These authors carried on excavations on the site of Oxyrhynchus, an ancient city about one hundred and twenty miles south of Cairo. In 1897 they discovered the Oxyrhynchus papyri of which Logion 5 is the one famil- iar to most biblical scholars, “Jesus saith, Wherever there are (two), they are not without God, and wherever there is one alone, I say, I am with him. Raise the stone, and there thou shalt find me; cleave the wood, and there am I.” As usual, the discovery led to an intense scholarly controversy. Some authorities went so far as to suggest that the quotations may have originated among the Gnostic sects which were deeply involved in esoteric Christianity."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"• 15 • The Bible, the Story of a Book In the Chenoboskion library discovered near Nag Hammadi in the 1940s, there are many references to and quotations of Jesus, especially in the Pistis Sophia . At this point it is appropriate to introduce Doctor Lobegott Friedrich Kon- stantin von Tischendorf who gained a worldwide reputation for his associa- tion with ancient biblical manuscripts. As a critic of the scriptural writings, he reflected a quality of literary integrity unsurpassed in his chosen field. The good doctor was born in1815, received a typical scholastic education (includ- ing the University of Leipzig), and determined to make New Testament criti- cism the work of his life. We are not inclined to think of such a career as espe- cially arduous; but Tischendorf died at the age of fifty-nine from fatigue and overwork, after being ennobled by the Czar of Russia for his achievements. Doctor Tischendorf found his path of higher criticism extremely difficult. To quote his own words, “I resolved, in 1839, to devote myself to the textual study of the New Testament, and attempted, by making use of all the acquisi- tions of the last three centuries, to reconstruct, if possible, the exact text as it came from the pen of sacred writers. “For the accomplishment of this pro- tracted and difficult enterprise it was needful not only to undertake distant journeys, to devote much time, and to bring to the task both ability and zeal, but also to provide a large sum of money, and this—the sinews of war—was altogether wanting.” The two oldest manuscripts available to Tischendorf were the Codex Vati- canus and the Codex Alexandrinus . The first had originally been a complete Bible, but both manuscripts were defective. Undaunted by poverty (which has been so aptly termed the disease of the learned), young Tischendorf started out without sufficient funds to buy himself a new suit of clothes. In the period from 1840 to 1843 he was in Paris immersed in the treasures of the Bibliotheque Nationale. He made a scanty living assisting more famous scholars and publishing versions of the Greek New Testament. After numer- ous vicissitudes, he attempted his first journey to the Near East, convinced that the old monastery and convent libraries of the Greek Orthodox Church contained manuscripts useful, if not absolutely necessary, in the reconstruc- tion of scriptural writings. It was in the Holy Land that Doctor Tischendorf made his first great discov- ery. He tells us, “It was at the foot of Mt. Sinai in the Convent of St. Catherine, that I discovered the pearl of all my researches. In visiting the library of the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"• 16 • Manly Palmer Hall Monastery in the month of May, 1844, I perceived in the middle of the great hall a large and wide basket full of old parchments, and the librarian, who was a man of information, told me that two heaps of papers like these, moldered by time, had been already committed to the flames. What was my surprise to find amid this heap of papers a considerable number of sheets of a copy of the Old Testament in Greek, which seemed to me to be one of the most ancient that I had ever seen. The authorities of the convent allowed me to possess myself of a third of these parchments, or about forty-three sheets, all the more readily as they were destined for the fire. But I could not get them to yield up the possession of the remainder. The too lively satisfaction which I had dis- played had aroused their suspicions as to the value of this manuscript.” Tischendorf returned to Europe, and in 1846 published these fragments which he called the Codex Friderico-Augustanus in honor of the king of Sax- ony. The publication caused considerable stir among the scholastic elect, and he was appointed Professor Extraordinarius in Leipzig. He was certain in his own mind that a considerable part of the manuscript reposed in the Convent of St. Catherine, for he had seen at least eighty-six more leaves. Realizing that the convent was in the Russian zone of influence, he sought and secured the assistance of Czar Alexander II. In January, 1859, Tischendorf was on his way back to the monastery. It appeared, however, that his mission would be unsuccessful. When it seemed that his trip had been in vain, he told his Bedouins on the fourth of Febru- ary to hold themselves in readiness to leave on the seventh for Cairo. Toward evening he accepted an invitation from the steward of the convent to take refreshments with him in his cell. He then took down from the corner of the room a bulky volume wrapped in a red cloth. To his amazement, Tischendorf saw the fragments which fifteen years before he had seen in the basket, also other parts of the Old Testament, and the New Testament complete. Eventually in October, 1859, after many adventures and delays, Tischen- dorf was able to secure the surviving leaves of the Mount Sinai Bible, and on the nineteenth of November he brought it to Russia and placed it in the hands of Czar Alexander II. This monarch was so amazed and delighted that immediate steps were taken to publish an exact facsimile for the use of schol- ars throughout the world. The production was under the personal supervision of Doctor Tischendorf."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"• 17 • The Bible, the Story of a Book The Monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai reproduced from a pic- ture by A.

Czar Alexander made a present of 9,000 rubles to the monastery in acknowledgment for the gift of the codex. In a brochure published by the Trustees of the British Museum in 1934 under the title The Mount Sinai Manuscript of the Bible , it is stated that the Codex Sinaiticus was purchased from the Soviet government in 1933 for the sum of 100,000 pounds. The British Museum brochure also notes that the purchase of the codex would be of mutual advantage as the Russian government would expend the purchase price on goods made in Great Britain, thus furnishing employment for workmen in the British Isles. I was in London when the manuscript was first placed on exhibition. It was accompanied by a contribution box inviting the public to participate in the acquisition of this priceless treasure. I gave modest support to this project. The thirty-nine books of the Old Testament as presented in the Christian Bible were written over a period of several hundred years. Ben Sira’s grand- son in 132 B.C. refers to Sacred Writings of his people as “the law, and the prophets, and other books of our fathers.” The Torah, of Law, is attributed to Moses and includes the five parts of the Holy Scripture from Genesis to Deu- teronomy in the present order. The Prophetic Books are divided into the early, the later prophets, and the minor prophets and total twenty-one books— of the most famous are Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah. The “other books of our fathers” number thirteen and are among the most frequently read of the Old Testament writings. The Psalms and Proverbs are treasured by Jewish and Christian readers alike. Ecclesiastes is deeply devotional and the Song of Songs attributed to Solomon was regarded by the alchemists as an allegory of the transmutation of metals. The Old Testament is indispensable to the complete canon because it provides theological, cosmological, and anthropological sup- port to moral and ethical teachings presented in the New Testament. POST-NICENE BIBLES The Septuagint Version of the Old Testament is the one quoted by Jesus in Luke 4:18-19. When Alexander the Great died, one of his leading offi- cers named Lagos became Ptolemy I of Egypt, usually referred to as Ptolemy Soter, thus establishing the Macedonian dynasty in Egypt. Ptolemy offered"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"• 20 • Manly Palmer Hall the Palestinian Jews a permanent and secure home in Alexandria and granted them Macedonian citizenship thus fusing Jewish, Greek, and Egyptian cul- tures to which later was added the learning of the Latin world. The circumstances surrounding the production of the Septuagint Version of the Old Testament is stated briefly in C. A. Muses’s revised edition of the Septuagint Bible, 1954. Charles Thomson (1729-1824) was the first to trans- late the Septuagint Bible into English. Thomson was Secretary of the Con- tinental Congress of the United States of America, a close friend of Thomas Jefferson, and was highly respected by most of the Founding Fathers. Dr. Muses tells us that during the reign of Ptolemy II, or Philadelphus (285 B.C.), this pharaoh was actively engaged in the enrichment of the famous Alexandrian libraries, a large part of which was housed in the royal palace. It was pointed out to Ptolemy that his collection should include a Greek trans- lation of the sacred books of the Jews. According to this account, Demetrius Phalereus, librarian of Ptolemy, recommended that the books of Moses be included in the great Alexandrian collection. Pharaoh was pleased at the idea and sent Aristeas and Andreas to Jerusalem to consult with Eleazar, who was then High Priest. After being convinced of the sincerity of Ptolemy, Eleazar selected seventy- two men who had the greatest reputation for learning, six from each of the twelve tribes and sent them to Alexandria. It is noted that the Jewish scholars completed the translation of the Pentateuch in seventy-two days. The transla- tion was then read in the presence of Ptolemy and numerous learned Egyp- tians. The original translation was limited to the five books of Moses, but by the first century A.D. this version included the complete Old Testament. The Septuagint Translation was into Greek which was more suitable to the schol- arly atmosphere of the Alexandrian Jewish community. St. Jerome (340/2-420) was ordained a priest at Antioch and went to Con- stantinople where he developed a strong friendship for St. Gregory Nazian- zus. In 385 A.D., he left Rome for the last time and reached Bethlehem the following year where he remained in a monastic institution, practicing extreme austerities, and translating sacred texts. He wrote about one hundred homilies addressed principally to members of the clergy. In religious art, he is often depicted accompanied by a lion and a cardinal’s hat which he never actually received due to the antagonism of prominent cleric."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"• 21 • The Bible, the Story of a Book Leaf of the Septuagint Version in parallel Greek and English.

Jerome completed the Vulgate in 405 A.D. The term Vulgate means “the common tongue,” vulgata in Latin. Pope Damasus, who was then Bishop of Rome, encouraged him to prepare the Latin version. During the period of translation, Jerome sent to Damasus his Translation of the New Testament accompanied by a letter which included the following statement: “But if we are compelled to seek the truth among many manuscripts, why not go back to the original Greek and with that before us, correct what has been faultily translated or recklessly amended by incompetent revisers, or added to or altered by nodding copy- ist.” (See page 119 of The One Book by Warwick James Price, Philadelphia: 1928.) As might be expected Jerome’s labors were downgraded by most of his contemporaries and it was not until the pontificate of Gregory the Great that the Vulgate was officially recognized in 604 A.D. By the sixth century, manuscripts in several languages including copies in Syrian were in circulation. However they added very little on the level of source material. After the destruction of the temple at Jerusalem in 70 A.D., the Septuagint Version lost favor among Jewish scholars and rabbis, and an effort was made to prepare a new version with a special consideration of the doctrines of the Pharisees. This resulted in the Old Testament being revised by Aquila, and this revision was used in synagogues for a considerable length of time. This was a most significant period in the early history of the Bible, and reverence for the letter of the Scriptures increased rapidly and affected all subsequent editions. It became virtually impossible to correct errors and inconsistencies, and tradition seriously crippled scholarship. This attitude is strongly noticeable in connection with revisions during the last fifty years. From the tenth century to the invention of printing the number of Bi- ble manuscripts increased rapidly, but they were principally copies for use in monasteries, churches, and for noble families, Although intended to be faithful reproductions of earlier works, minor changes were made, partly due to the limited abilities of the scribes, and partly to earlier inconsistencies, faithfully preserved or interpreted, For example, a scribe checking his work might find he had left out a word so he placed it in the margin, A later copyist carefully repeated the procedure or attempted to discover a secret motive be- hind the previous error. Many old manuscripts developed marginalia, and it became impossible to determine the source of these annotations.

PRINTED EDITIONS OF THE BIBLE The Venetians traded with China as early as the thirteenth century A.D. and probably adapted the Oriental wood-block printing technique in the production of playing cards. The Chinese, Korean, and Japanese already had extensive libraries of printed books several centuries earlier. Religious pictures printed from hand-cut wooden blocks using Oriental methods were circu- lated on the European continent twenty-five or thirty years before Guten- berg invented his press. Again, following the Asiatic precedent, groups of the separate block-printed leaves were brought together to form what is now called the Biblia Pauperum, or the Pauper’s Bible. The collections consisted principally of biblical stories and were assembled in groups of forty leaves. The accompanying illustration is reproduced from Humphreys’ History of the Art of Printing, London: 1868. This leaf forms the title page of the first edi- tion of the Biblia Pauperum. According to Humphreys, the overall theme features God the Father breathing upon the Virgin, and in the breath of Deity the Spirit of the Holy Ghost is seen descending in the form of a dove, followed by the Infant Christ bearing his cross. Eve’s temptation foreshadows the birth of Christ, and the armored figure of Gideon, who became saturated with dew, was made to typify Christ’s birth by the infusion of the Holy Spirit. The facsimile is from the copy which came to the British Museum with the Royal Library. THE GUTENBERG BIBLE The earliest book printed from movable type in Europe is now referred to as the Gutenberg Bible. It first appeared about the year 1455, but work upon it probably started in 1450. The motives behind this massive undertaking are not fully known or strictly honorable. The original intent might have been to sell the volumes as handwritten manuscripts similar to those in the librar- ies of the nobility and the clergy.

A replica of the Gutenberg press was brought to Chicago for the World’s Fair of 1933. Using the same techniques and copies of the original type, a number of sheets were struck off, one of which is reproduced here. This psalter was printed in1456 after Gutenberg lost control of his press. The motive which impelled Gutenberg to carry on his work in absolute se- crecy has been the subject of considerable speculation. In any event, it brought him nothing but financial disaster. There is an old story that ecclesiastical authorities suspected that the devil was cooperating in the enterprise. It was obvious that actual manuscripts could not be produced with such speed and accuracy by any normal means. His creditors moved in on him and took pos- session of the printing equipment he had invented. The storm that surrounded the publication of the first printed Bible fi- nally subsided. Adolph of Nassau, who became Bishop of Mainz in 1462, appointed Gutenberg a gentleman of his court, an elevation supported by an official diploma. Of this incident Henry Noel Humphreys writes, “From the diploma, dated 1465, which confers this honorary title upon Gutenberg, and which has been published by Johannis and also by Wolf, it appears not to have been entirely an empty honour that was thus bestowed, for we find in- cluded, the annual grant of twenty matters of corn and barrels of wine for the use of his house, and also an official court suit, which, from what we know of the costume of the time, must have been of somewhat gorgeous character.” (See A History of the Art of Printing , London: 1868.) By a stroke of good fortune, I was able to acquire an original leaf of the Gutenberg Bible. In 1921, a folio was issued under the title A Noble Fragment Being a Leaf of the Gutenberg Bible, 1450-1455, with a Biographical Essay by A. Edward Newton , one of the greatest of modern bibliophiles. The volume is a slender folio and included an original page of the forty-two-line Bible from 1 Maccabees 10:11. Laid in is a copy of the Gutenberg keepsake published in1924 by John Henry Nash. We are happy indeed to have this venerable leaf as it is now regarded as impossible that another copy of the complete Bible will ever be placed on sale.

The leaves had been salvaged from damaged and incomplete volumes and were of interest not only to scholars but typographers and those concerned with the production of early printing establishments. The original leaf of an early book has greater appeal than the finest modern reproduction. When loaning biblical material in leaves to public institutions for exhibition purposes, there is no danger that a priceless volume may be damaged or stolen. Early manuscripts or printed incunabula are usually fragile, and lengthy exposures—even in cases—are not recom- mended. So far as Bibles are concerned, we have a fair holding in foreign translations of either the complete work, the New Testament, or separate books. The Irish New Testament stands side by side with the Four Gospels in Turkish, the New Testament in Sanskrit, the Mongolian Gospel of Matthew, and the Chinese New Testament. The library collection includes several early and rare Bibles and twenty editions in English. It is also noticeable that a number of important editions of the Holy Scrip- tures were inspired by reformers who gained unusual distinction by openly condemning the teachings of the incumbent clergy. Even St. Jerome was not over popular in his own day, and he was dead for many years before his text was fully approved. Among the best-known English versions of the Bible are the Wycliffe, Tyndale, Coverdale, and the King James. MARTIN LUTHER (1483 - 1546) The German edition by Martin Luther caused a considerable stir which has not entirely subsided in our day. Luther was excommunicated, but it is likely that he would have had worse treatment had he not come under the protec- tion of the German guilds. The little room or, perhaps more correctly, cell where he labored on his translation has long been a tourist attraction. There is a blotch on the wall which is always pointed out. It seems that while Mar- tin Luther was engaged in his appointed task, the devil came up through the floor in an effort to divert his attention. Luther picked up his heavy inkwell and threw it at the demon who apparently vanished, but the ink stain on the wall is plainly visible after all these centuries."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"• 30 • Manly Palmer Hall After the celebrated trial at Worms in 1521, Luther exhibited a spiritual res- olution that might have brought down upon him the displeasure of the elec- tor of Saxony and the maledictions of the clergy. It was considered prudent therefore for him to retire to the Black Forest with some of his closest follow- ers and take up residence in the forbidding old Wartburg fortress and seek the safety of seclusion. Obviously unsuited for protracted idleness, Luther began a translation of the New Testament into German which he finished in three months, basing it upon Erasmus’ Greek text. This was published in 1522. While working on the Old Testament he is quoted as saying, “I am now at work translating the prophets. Good Heavens! How hard it is to make the Hebrew writers speak German.” Having completed his translation, Luther invited his most learned friends to pass judgment upon the sufficiency of his endeavor. Among those he consulted was Philipp Melanchthon. It was Lu- ther’s Bible that raised the German language to the level of scholarship.

John Wycliffe (1320-1384) was resolved to provide the English people with a complete translation of the Latin Vulgate. The public was well pleased, but the clergy were far from happy. Wycliffe completed the translation of the Bible in 1383 and died a natural death the following year. Thus he escaped the vengeance of the church which could only dig up his remains and have them publicly burned. William Tyndale (1492?-1536), though born in England, left that country in 1524 never to return. An edition of his New Testament was published in Worms. He was relentlessly pursued until 1535 when he was arrested and imprisoned near Brussels. His enemies were determined to dispose of him and in 1536 he was garroted and his body burned. The labors which Tyndale was unable to finish were carried on by Miles Coverdale and the Tyndale- Coverdale Bible was the foundation upon which the King James Version was based. This Bible was literally read to pieces, and no perfect copy of the first edition is known to exist. The Matthew’s Bible which appeared in 1537 is a respectable work, but no one has been able to decide the identity of the reviser. There seems to be a suspicion that it was the nom de plume of John Rogers. If he attempted to conceal his true identity in order to escape persecution, he failed. He is often referred to as the first Protestant martyr, and was condemned to death during the reign of Mary I and was burned at the stake of February 4, 1555. His wife and children were denied the right to see him before his execution. During the reign of Mary, English Protestants departed the country and took refuge on the Continent. When Elizabeth came to the throne, the Prot- estant cause was favored and the Catholics established themselves in the more favorable atmosphere of France. They almost immediately felt it necessary to issue a Catholic Bible in the English language. The New Testament was trans- lated from the Vulgate, and the wording is strange and wonderful.

The Catholics, therefore, made their own translation. Thomas Fuller has said that it is a translation in need of being translated. Re- produced herewith is a leaf from the first Rheims-Douai Bible (1609-1610). It was printed at Douai by Laurence Kellam at the sign of the Holy Lambe.

THE BISHOPS’ BIBLE Queen Elizabeth I (1533-1603) had a mind of her own. For one cause or another, she decided that the time had come to defend the divine rights of sovereignty. She ordered Archbishop Parker to head a royal commission to prepare a version of the Holy Scriptures which would meet her approval. The result was the Bishops’ Bible of 1568. The volume had a fine appearance mak- ing use of vignettes which originally appeared in Ovid’s Metamorphoses . The distinguished book collector, A. Edward Newton, in his admirable work The Greatest Book in the World , Boston: 1925, writes of the Bishops’ Bible, “No thing was left undone to make this appealing; it was issued in magnificent style with a portrait of Queen Elizabeth and—in very bad taste—another of her supposed lover, Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, and of Lord Bur- leigh, her minister.” Newton also notes that about the best thing that could be said about the Bishops’ Bible is that it served to pave the way for the King James Version. The seventeenth century was the golden age of English letters. Dedicated scholars expanded the horizons of knowledge and enriched the language. This period also brought about vast improvements in education and heralded a universal reformation of arts and sciences. In a few short years, Bacon gave the world Novum Organum and Burton, The Anatomy of Melancholy. The plays attributed to Shakespeare and the King James Version of the Bible also appeared. The same era cradled the alchemists and the Rosicrucians and in- spired the colonization of the Western world. Naturally, these changes met strenuous resistance. Conservative factions were locked in bitter feuds with progressives. Orthodoxy locked horns with mysticism, and there was definite- ly a new approach to the Sacred Scriptures. Jewish cabalists were exploring the Gematria and Notarikon, and Christian cabalists were searching for the secrets beneath the surface of the New Testament.

Various Protestant sects had a tendency to favor the works of their own pens and the jots and tittles became formidable barri- ers in both church and the home. Things gradually subsided however, and for over three hundred years the King James Version was the choice of the Prot- estant Christian world. The rise of a highly industrialized culture, however, began to color religious view points. It was erroneously assumed that the new was superior to the old simply because it was more recent. As the attitude toward Deity became increasingly critical, the simple faith of our fathers was undermined. The country church gave place to a modern architectural masterpiece, the interior of which somewhat resembled the Sen- ate Chamber in Washington, D.C. Many eccentric structures were sanctified to God but were actually memorials to outstanding architects. THE KING JAMES AND OTHER SEVENTEENTH CENTURY BIBLES When James VI gave up the peace and quiet of the Scottish highlands to become James I of England, he was not entirely popular. The early years of his reign were burdened with conflicts and criticisms and not the least of these centered on the on the editions of Holy Writ. Many serious Bible students, discouraged by the local confusion, ordered Bibles from the Conti- nent. Those in general circulation included the Coverdale, the Matthew, the Great Bible, the Bishops’ and the Geneva. Some further complication arose as Luther’s translation was widely distributed on the Continent and in England. To pacify the contending factions, James convened a conference at Hampton Court in January, 1604. Dr. John Rainolds of Oxford recommended that a completely new version should be prepared under the patronage of the king that would be acceptable to all the contentious congregations. The king was delighted. Almost immediately, a list of fifty-four scholars was selected and the king required that the government finance these men during their labors.

In 1611 the King James Version, or perhaps revision, was published in London by Robert Barker. It was in black letter and appeared as a substantial folio with an engraved title page, a preface to the reader, maps, and other appropriate embellishments. Early editions included an extensive introduction, highly controversial and suf- ficient to frustrate the entire work of the project had it not been gradually eliminated. A. Edward Newton has this to say concerning the scholars appointed by King James to prepare the edition of 1611: “England was a nest of singing birds. Shakespeare was alive; he had, indeed, made his exit from the stage and was living in retirement in Stratford; but Bacon was at work: he had published his Advancement of Learning and was busy upon the Novum Or- ganum . His disciples say that he had much to do with the Bible, and he may have done so, for he was the greatest scholar then living in England.” (See The Greatest Book in the World , Boston: 1925.) The King James Bible has been called “the noblest book in the English language.” The press work was actually entrusted to Miles Smith and Thomas Bilson. There are two issues of the first edition. In the earliest printing, Ruth 3:15 says, “...he went into the city.” As a consequence, this is generally called the “He” Bible. In the second issue, the line in Ruth reads, “...she went into the city.” As a result, this issue is known as the “She” Bible. The part King James played in the production of the Authorized Version of the Holy Scriptures will always entitle him to a measure of special apprecia- tion. He was also very wise in opposing major changes of meanings and the neglect of literary excellence. The scriptural qualities everywhere present in the wording and certain archaic forms preserved in the text have contributed greatly to the popular respect which has been bestowed upon this Bible for nearly four centuries. The Authorized Version as published in 1611 has be- come the only English translation acknowledged by the Anglican Church. Some conflict has arisen among biblical scholars insisting that advance- ments in Hebrew philology and biblical archaeology justify a more contem- porary translation. For the most part however, it can be pointed out with good reason that the recommended improvements are of no great significance.

It is in six volumes, imperial folio. The Old Testament is dated 1655 and the New Testament, 1657. Our copy is in extremely fine condition, red-lined throughout, with an engraved portrait facing the title. Brian Walton, D.D., was born in 1600, educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge, and was chaplain to Charles I of unhappy memory. During the Commonwealth, he retired to Oxford where he could continue his religious researches and had the leisure to work on his great Polyglot Bible. After the Restoration, he was consecrated Bishop of Chester and was appointed chaplain to Charles II. We are told that Walton’s great Polyglot was the first English book ever to be sold by subscription. The price was ten pounds and nine hundred orders were received during the first two months. Most leaves of the Old Testament include the text in Hebrew, the Latin Vulgate, the Greek Septuagint, the Chaldean Paraphrase, the Syriac and Arabic Versions, each with a Latin translation. The type necessary to cover nine languages was all made in England. Charles II, overwhelmed by the magnitude of Walton’s labors, also appointed him King’s Printer of Oriental Languages. The New Testament was the first of the biblical polyglots to include Persian and Ethiopic Versions with Latin translations. CASTELL’S LEXICON Edmund Castell (1606-1685) was a native of Hatley in Cambridgeshire and entered the Emanuel College, Cambridge, in 1621. He devoted the greatest part of his life to the Lexicon Heptaglotton, Hebraicum, Chaldaicum, Syriacum, Samaritanum, Ethiopicum, Arabicum, etc. which was published in London in two imperial folios in 1669. It was probably intended as a com- panion work to Walton’s Biblia Sacra Polyglotta . Castell expended more than sixty thousand dollars on his lexicon of which only a few copies were sold. He enjoyed some preferments, but nothing to compensate him for the expense and labor over a period of eighteen years. After Castell’s death, his niece stored the unsold copies in a room of one of her tenant’s houses where the books lay for many years at the mercy of rats. Not enough remained usable to complete more than one or two copies.

ELIOT INDIAN BIBLE The first translation of the Bible into the language of a pagan people was accomplished by John Eliot (1604-1690), a minister of Roxbury, Massachu- setts. It was the first Scripture printed in North America. Eliot has often been called the Apostle of the North American Indians. He was born in Essex, England, and emigrated to Boston in 1631. With a great effort, he acquired the Algonquin language and dedicated most of his life to spreading the Gos- pel among the members of this tribe. The Algonquins had no written language, and Eliot was required first to ac- quire their oral tongue, second to transform their vocabulary into equivalent sounds in English, and third to teach the Indians to recognize their own lan- guage in the English word combinations. The first edition appeared in 1663 under the title Mamusse Wunee-Tupamatamwe Up-Biblum God naneeswe Nukkone Testament kah wonk Wusku Testament . The longest word used in the Bible is in St. Mark 1:40, Wutappesittukqussunnokwehtunkquoh , “kneeling down to him.” Eliot received financial help from England and inspired the establishment of the Company for Propagating the Gospel in New England and Parts Adja- cent in 1649. The Eliot Indian Bible was reissued in 1685 and a leaf from this edition is reproduced herewith. Sequoyah, a half-breed Cherokee Indian, was born about 1770 of an Indian mother and a Caucasian father. Although he did not know a single word of English, he invented an alphabet consisting of eighty-six characters by which all words of the Cherokee language could be recorded in written form. The labor required twelve years, and Sequoyah had considerable difficulty in con- vincing his people that this system was not a form of black magic. Christian missionaries published considerable literature in the Cherokee language and, about eighteen years after Sequoyah’s death, the entire New Testament was published in the Cherokee language.

In 1813, the Four Gospels were translated into the language of the Eskimo Indians on the coast of Labrador by Missionaries of the Unitas Fratrum, or United Brethren. THE JEFFERSON BIBLE In the year 1803, Thomas Jefferson cut from the pages of the New Testa- ment such verses as presented the ethical teachings of Jesus concisely and in what he considered to be the proper sequence. The labor was not for his own use alone, but for the benefit of Indian tribes unable to understand the nu- merous complications of the Scriptures. The original work was labeled Morals of Jesus, but is now in publication with the title The Jefferson Bible . It sets forth in simple and direct form the essence and substance of the Christian lifeway. It is evident that Thomas Jefferson had the deepest respect for the teach- ings of Jesus Christ. It is meaningful that as the third president of the United States, the author of the Declaration of Independence, and the founder of the University of Virginia, he was a man of strong religious convictions. He writes, “Say nothing of my religion. It is known to my God and myself alone. Its evi- dence before the world is to be sought in my life; if that has been honest and dutiful to society, the religion which has regulated it cannot be a bad one.” MODERN BIBLES AND BIBLE SOCIETIES In 1804, the British and Foreign Bible Society was established in England. The principle objective was to make translation of the Holy Bible or sections thereof available to persons of all nations and denominations at an extremely low price. In the library of the Philosophical Research Society we have a num- ber of translations issued by or through the activities of this British organi- zation. We note for example, the Four Gospels in Ethiopian, printed at the request and expense of the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1826.

It may reasonably be assumed, therefore, that nearly every literate, living person has had some direct contact with the sacred writings of Christianity. Let us consider for a moment The New English Bible New Testament , Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press, 1961. We will call atten- tion to a few of the changes of the new translators. In the King James Version, Matthew 1:1-2 read as follows: Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the King, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. The new version reads, JESUS WAS BORN at Bethlehem in Judaea during the reign of Herod. After his birth, astrologers from the east arrived in Jerusalem, asking, ‘Where is the child who is born to be king of the Jews? We observed the rising of his star, and have come to pay him homage. While there are no world-shaking changes, it appears unusual that modern scholarship should condone the introduction of astrologers into this text. In most translations, the Wise Men who came to worship Jesus, including those in the King James Version and the Vulgate, together with Chaldean, Arabic, Persian, and Ethiopian Scriptures definitely were called Magi . It is also noticeable that in the new version the star in the east has entirely disap- peared. They have translated orient as “rising” instead of “the east.” Of course,"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"• 49 • The Bible, the Story of a Book in the older languages, the word orient represents east but there is an adjective form of the word in Latin which means “to rise.” We may therefore properly say, but never do, that the orient sun means the rising sun. In the fifth chapter, third verse of Matthew, the King James Version reads, Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. The new version appears to be a complete failure: How blest are those who know that they are poor; the kingdom of Heaven is theirs. In the same chapter, ninth verse, Jesus is made to say, Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the children of God. The recently improved text states it a little differently: How blest are the peacemakers; god shall call them his sons. Apparently, the improvement intimates that the peace-makers are all male, whereas children meets the objections likely to arise among the members of the women’s liberation movement. Nearly all of the Beatitudes have been subjected to major or minor changes. Matthew 5:25-26 have been given a considerable working over. The King James Bible says, Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. The new reading is a follows: If someone sues you, come to terms with him promptly while you are both on your way to court; otherwise he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the constable, and you will be put in jail. I tell you, once you are there you will not be let out till you have paid the last farthing. This seems to suggest that some unfortunate person is likely to be locked up in Old Bailey. It seems extremely unlikely that Jesus, speaking nearly two thousand years ago, should use such words. Here, however, the revising com-"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"• 50 • Manly Palmer Hall mittee might have made a useful change, for it is certain that Jesus did not use the word farthing. It is strictly British and could not have been taken from the Greek, but is a good old Anglo-Saxon word for a small coin which is a quarter of a British pence equivalent to a half-cent in American money. This coin is of no value anywhere, including the British Isles. In 1937, an attempt was made to modernize the King James Version of the Bible so that it could be read as living literature. It is stated in this work that spelling and punctuation are modernized, genealogies and repetitions are omitted, as well as the whole of Chronicles, the minor Epistles, and similar unimportant passages throughout. The drastic determination to break away from the classical versions seems to serve no useful purpose. The Bible has had the largest circulation of any book in the world. It has the further advan- tage of a wonderful translation into the English language with a vast reading public and a second language in many foreign countries. The two Testaments are indispensable to each other, for if there were no book of Genesis, there could be no justification for the Revelation of St. John. Religious art became very progressive until the subjects were difficult to distinguish. Old hymns were not heard so much any more and innovations in this area are not exactly paeons of praise from the grateful heart. With integrity edited out of history, morality eliminated from biography, and honesty regarded as an economic detriment, it is inevitable that sooner or later a revision of the Holy Scriptures would be considered as necessary, or at least appropriate. The devout scholars who labored together to create the harmony of Scrip- ture that we find in the King James Version have departed from this troubled sphere, and successors with appropriate insights have not arisen to take their places. As a result, the several new versions of the Bible that are now regarded as major improvements on the older texts are something less than satisfactory. That there are good scholars, no one will deny, but they live in a century that has given us little but wars, depressions, revolutions, and economic insecurity. It is increasingly difficult to find outstanding examples of hope, faith, and charity. Some have assumed that more people will read the Bible if many of the pious wordings were restated in commonplace terms. Recent revisions of the Bible contribute little or nothing to the improve- ment of the text. The principal objective is to cater to readers who are ac- customed to popular contemporary literature. It is assumed by some that the Authorized Version is too exalted for those accustomed to select their"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"• 51 • The Bible, the Story of a Book reading from book clubs. A religion-oriented person would rather hope that the sublimity of the King James Bible might lift the consciousness of those seeking spiritual comfort and consolation. Some of the revised texts would indicate that the tone of the Bible should be lowered to the comprehension of casual scanners. Before we edit the Bible according to personal prejudices or the fashions of the time, there is a far more important consideration—who wrote this sacred book? A number of the books of the Old and New Testaments are attributed to sanctified persons who lived long ago. The early sections of the Old Testa- ment perpetuate the oral traditions of more remote times. The names associ- ated with the New Testament are not found in the earliest manuscripts and, even assuming them to be correct, the mystery of authorship is not actually solved. For many believers, the Bible was delivered to humanity by prophets inspired by God. At the moment, we have no better explanation. As new translations or revisions of the Bible are based upon previous— more or less acceptable—renditions of the text, it is remarkable that the Sa- cred Scriptures should be an endless cause of controversy and persecution. Religion and politics were locked in bitter feuding, and most Bibles read in English homes were printed on the Continent. When these precious vol- umes were smuggled into the homes of the pious, the owners were subject to imprisonment and heavy fines. In substance, the translations differed but little and the changes were due to the dispositional preference of the edi- tors. Although Protestant versions were rejected by the Catholic clergy, the translation itself was not criticized. The offense was that it did not carry the authorization of the church."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"• 52 • THE STORY OF A BOOK The sacred books of the world are set apart from all secular writings. Al- though many recent sects have gospels of their own, the principle religious scriptures are the Old and New Testaments, the Zend-Avesta, the Institutes of Manu, the Vedas, the Vishnu Purana, the Sutras of Northern and South- ern Buddhism, the Tao Te Ching, the ethical writings of Confucius, and the Koran. They proclaim the spiritual responsibilities of devout persons and in most cases the ethical instructions are the same or similar in all these inspired texts. It is now generally assumed that the sacred books are based upon the de- scent of oral traditions. They originated before the invention of writing and were preserved by priests and elders of tribes and culture groups. They may contain certain elements of history or prehistory, but this is not their essential purpose. Fragments of many branches of learning are found in the sacred texts, but these also are incidental. Their real purpose is to perpetuate the record of human experience as proof of a Universal Integrity. They endure as foundations of faith and they support convictions with which humanity has been innately endowed. It has long been assumed that the human being is a creature of good inten- tions. He is placed in an environment which does not support the convic- tions of his inner life. By degrees, he has come to depend upon faith in the substance of things unseen. The sacred book of one’s religion not only justifies the good life but sets forth the rewards for honorable conduct. Whereas much of the world’s literature is deficient in idealism, sacred writings are a major source of human hope. The sincere believer is no longer lonely and forsaken for there is a Spiritual Power, a Being, or a Principle which will never fail. Creation is not a sterile and mindless process; it is part of a plan which has meaning and is a very present help in time of trouble. Perhaps we should say, therefore, that the human soul is the defender of our faith; the good within ourselves chooses to seek the beautiful and serve the Universal Good. Scrip- tural writings, therefore, are the first line of defense against man’s own feelings PART TWO"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"• 53 • The Bible, the Story of a Book of futility. If the individual cannot dream of a better future, he cannot live well today. Though we are living in troubled times, conditions are not hopeless so long as the majority of human beings believes in love, friendship, and the privileges of mutual helpfulness. Countries that recently became dedicated to industrialized atheism are now turning back to religion. Without the en- nobling contribution of enlightened faith, there is no incentive to improve character or contribute to progress. In many instances we have no proof as to who wrote the sacred books, but we associate them with sanctified persons in the past who had the inner real- ization of the Divine Will. The real authority for the words in the Bible comes from our own hearts and we accept without question universal integrities that no honorable person can doubt. A long-suffering humankind sanctifies the scriptures of the world because they give directives which we instinctively and intuitively know to be right. Critics have found fault with all the world’s scriptures, but as yet they have discovered no useful substitutes. Each reader selects sections of the scriptures that best serve the needs of his own heart and passes lightly over the rest. Certain books in the Bible such as Kings and Chronicles may fascinate some readers, but the Psalms and the Proverbs are dear to the hearts of all of us. Dimly, through the pages we behold the frailties of human nature, the pres- sures of outrageous circumstance, and the desperate longing for the experi- ence of God’s presence. The part of ourselves which appreciates and understands scriptural writings is what Emerson calls the Over-Soul. The martyrs of old were burned at the stake or broken on the rack for the sin of possessing a Bible, yet they died rather than to give up the Book. In some Oriental countries, sacred writings are still regarded as living beings, for that which has no life in itself cannot work miracles. Offerings were actually made to the spirits of books and their presence was benediction in the home. Libraries in older times were sanctuar- ies devoted largely to revelations of the divine way. The Greeks realized this and considered an appropriate dedication to lofty convictions as essential to the good life. We have already surveyed the story of the Bible as the Scripture of Western man. We have noted how translator after translator has sought wording closer to his own inner understanding. No"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"• 54 • Manly Palmer Hall other book in the world has called forth greater loyalties than the Bible of the Jewish-Christian world. The Bishops’ Bible, which prepared the way for the great King James Ver- sion, inspired much of the wording still found in the authorized text of the 1611 edition. This is indeed the crowning achievement in sacred literature. It is separated from the common language of our daily living by certain ar- chaicisms which themselves convey the feeling of timelessness and a strange superhuman authority. Through many translations, countless pious scribes have given the full measure of their devotion to their inspired labor. Some were martyred in their own days, but with the passing of centuries they are receiving the gratitude which is their proper due. In all fairness, we should point out that the sacred books of other religions have been translated into English and have helped to bridge the intervals which have divided faiths from each other since the dawn of time. Most of the translations, however, have been unable to capture the sublimity of the ancient texts. Actually we understand but little of our own sacred books and far less the beliefs of other faiths, but in time the human need will be victori- ous over the prejudices of the mind. Each nation of the world exists for a purpose. It provides an environment in which human beings are able to unfold their personal resources in famil- iar atmospheres. Thus, the common habits and practices which should have led to mutual understanding have further divided us from each other. Even within faiths themselves, there have been divisions and subdivisions leading to conflict and misunderstanding. These conflicts are a common aspect of hu- man character. We can seldom agree on our likes or dislikes. Each defends his own political allegiances to the bitter end. There is no agreement as to what constitutes happiness or a more suitable career. All depends upon personal inclinations, and our own choice we will defend to the bitter end. From the beginning, therefore, we have differed on what is best for the individual and most useful to the collective. Three-quarters of the population of the earth has faith that at the source of life there is an Omnipotent Benevolent Power guiding the destiny of cre- ation. The Christian population of North America has been estimated at 230,458,700. It is true that there are a number of denominations which are not all completely compatible, but how can a person consider himself to be educated who is deprived of religious insight? Certainly the issue is as great"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"• 55 • The Bible, the Story of a Book as that of interracial understanding and international political issues. Perhaps the reticence to recognize the validity of the contents of Jefferson’s Bible is due to fear that enlightened faith could result in universal brotherhood. Science offers the average person no moral or ethical substitute for religious instruc- tion. When sterile intellectualism gains control of social procedures, morality and ethics gradually collapse. The delinquencies we hope we had outgrown return in full force and things will not improve until the dignity of religion is restored in the churches and in secular society. The Bible is not merely the record of a belief—it is the proof of a human need. Our survival depends upon providing proper support for our dreams, hopes, and aspirations. Wealth, as a substitute for integrity, has always been of little comfort to mankind. Fame is at best a nuisance and politics an un- solvable dilemma. Under the neurosis of materialism, crime everywhere in- creases, seditions flourish, and the harassed individual becomes the victim of alcoholism, narcotics, and tranquilizers. Leadership cannot be adequate while the governing ignore the needs of the governed. Comparative religion, without sectarian favoritism should be taught to those who must go out into a society that has been denied adequate moral training. The moment however the subject is approached intelligently, the religious groups themselves resent the idea of sectarian democracy. We find ourselves back in the Middle Ages where reformers were promptly exterminated. By refusing to elevate religion above sectarian differences, the churches are contributing to the evil day they all fear. Why is it absolutely necessary to endanger the survival of the human race by loving one another? Our ancestors came over to this continent to find freedom of worship, not freedom from worship. If your next door neighbor attends a different church, this does not justify bigotry or prejudice. A child coming into the world today must live in an interreligious environment. Misplaced persons are scattered throughout many countries. Here in the United States we have Koreans, Chi- nese, Japanese, Hindus, Persians, Jews, and Mohammedans among others. We must do business with them, buy and sell their products, and share in our common educational and social privileges. Whenever possible we should respect and even admire those who have sought to escape the tyrannies ravaging their homelands. They can do much to enrich those who came here for the same purpose nearly four centuries ago. We are appreciating as never before the arts and crafts of these refugees,"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"• 56 • Manly Palmer Hall and we are discovering that they can enrich their new homeland if we open ourselves to their cultural contributions. Many of these foreign people–even Asiatics–have read our Bible, attended our mission schools, and assume that we are a Christian people. Our remote ancestors were very largely victims of environmental circum- stances over which they had little or no control. Man was born, suffered, and died, or, as the Bible says, He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down... (Job 14:2) There was no concept of an afterlife, for beyond the grave there was only a misty realm of ghostly spirits. The Greeks envisioned a subterranean region presided over by Hades. This somber deity neither blessed nor cursed and, even in the times of Homer, the lowliest slave alive was more fortunate than great Achilles dead. The Egyptians introduced the ritual of the weighing of the human soul. After death came the judgment and a virtuous life in the mortal world was rewarded by the gentle joys of the Elysian Fields. In this way, it gradually came about that mortal conduct was brought under the control of systems of morality and ethics. Even at best however, the immediate concerns of per- sonal existence in human society took precedence over priestly platitudes. The mystery of death has never been solved to the complete satisfaction of those who are doomed to depart from material existence. Most sacred books are deeply concerned with man’s hope for immortality. The Bible presents the image of a personal God as a righteous and venerable ancestral parent. In the first verse of Genesis it is written, In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. In sober fact, these ten words established the cause of existence. No details are provided and the statement is irrefutable although it may be highly objection- able to modern intellectuals. It is certain that the biblical statement, though not provable, cannot be disproved. It creates a dichotomy. However, for it seems to divide the unknowable from the knowable. In so doing, it places the priority of religion over all the sciences developed by humanity through the ages. The religious point of view is supported by the indisputable fact that all the aspects of existence are orderly and purposeful."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"• 57 • The Bible, the Story of a Book In an article entitled “A New Translation Alter Bible” which appeared in the New York Times , October 12, 1962, there is a suggested change in the first verse of Genesis. It is recommended that the words in the beginning should be changed to when God began . This eliminates the implication that eternity be- gan with the creation of the world. Dr. Orlinsky, Professor of Bible at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion is credited with saying, “We do not know when eternity began.” He admits that the Hebrew text can be trans- lated as “in the beginning,” but in context should be taken to mean when . Modern science is not above changing the meaning of an inconvenient word. For example, in higher learning it should be mutually agreed that the question why? should always be understood as how? A reconciliation between theism and atheism would not be especially difficult if modern scholars gave some attention to allegory, mythology, and legendry. Homer, Hesiod, and Virgil were neither superstitious nor gullible. They perpetuated philosophi- cal fables with profound meanings concealed beneath the folklore of remote times. Each generation can interpret the old beliefs and benefit greatly by such liberal thoughtfulness. Lord Bacon was certainly not a gullible man. A lawyer, philosopher, scien- tist, and economist, he found leisure time to publish a small volume of the wisdom of the ancients. He found such old stories as Oedipus and the Sphinx and the Wars of the Titans stimulating to reason and common sense. He was a devoutly religious ,man and was convinced that he would rather believe all the fables of antiquity than deny that the vast fabric of creation is without a mind. The effort to discredit the Bible because it conflicts with the findings of science is not valid. Now the situation becomes more complicated. In the second chapter of Genesis, god created man, and in the third chapter man disobeyed God, set- ting in motion an endless series of disagreeable occurrences. God provided Adam and Eve with a beautiful garden where everything necessary was avail- able as divine bounty. Even the Lord himself walked in the garden in the cool of the evening. As the story unfolds, Cain slays his brother; and God, weary of his wayward children, found Noah to be the only just man in his genera- tion. These circumstances must be regarded as allegorical. They are not the ac- count of a few wandering tribes which fell into one dilemma after another. It is clearly indicated that mankind was incapable of obeying the laws by which he was created and by which he could preserve himself. This story epitomizes"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"• 58 • Manly Palmer Hall ten thousand years of history in all parts of the world. It is the continuing record of the victory of the immediate desires over the divine purpose. We have already discussed the veneration in which the Bible is held through- out the civilized world. Two great revelations of the law are set forth; the Decalogue, or the tablets of the law given to Moses on Sinai, and the Sermon on the Mount in which Jesus states clearly the way of eternal life which Deity has provided for mankind. Similar codes are found in all enlightened reli- gions, but benightedness still rules the world. If Solomon, the son of David, were alive today, could he state the problem more clearly than in the twelfth chapter of Ecclesiastes, verses thirteen and fourteen? Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter. Fear God, and keep his com- mandments; for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. The morality and emblem writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centu- ries found the Bible an endless source of sacred pictures. Possibly the most talented in this field was Romeyn de Hooghe. One of his interesting and sig- nificant books, Hieroglyphica , was not published until nearly thirty years after his death. We reproduce here one of his plates. In the central foreground is Christ ministering to suffering humanity, and in the upper right background is an allegorical figure of the church receiving instruction from an angel. Over the head of Christ is the dove of the Holy Spirit. De Hooghe’s artistry did not simply illustrate religious occurrences but interpreted the mystical meaning, thus unlocking the esoteric philosophy concealed behind the literal text. Has any scientist, politician, educator, or philosopher been able to refute the words of Solomon? Are we willing to ignore universal integrity and trust our fate and future upon nuclear fission, chemical warfare, and the strate- gies of materialistically-minded economists? It would seem that the Bible is trying to tell us something, but we are slow of learning. The prophets of the Old Testament warned the people that they were departing from the way of salvation. Their words were carefully recorded and promptly ignored. Were not these prophets actually the sages and saints of all the nations under the sun who came to restore human integrities? In many cases their words have descended to us and they are cherished."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"• 59 • The Bible, the Story of a Book The ministry of Christ and his church, from an engraving on copper by Romeyn de Hooghe, Amsterdam: 1744."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"• 60 • Manly Palmer Hall Most persons feel that they would like to accept the wisdom of the great teachers, but they are afraid that their material securities will be destroyed. It is necessary to go against conscience to survive in these heavily clouded cen- turies. Solomon has a few things to say about this also. In Ecclesiastes 1:2-4, the Preacher who was king in Jerusalem writes, Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity. What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun? One gen- eration passeth away, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth for ever. We have seen the conflicts which have arisen in the translating of the Sacred Scriptures. Each scribe locked in his own orthodoxies has felt it a moral duty to condemn the labors of another. In most respects, the Bible is a very simple book, and many parts of it can be read to children and will benefit them. The Book itself deals not with creeds, rather it contains a clear and indisputable solution to the confusion for which we have found no remedy. A few atheists are determined to prevent religious sentiments from receiving public sup- port. What do they offer in the place of such an inspiring faith? Atheism is especially difficult in the last hours of human life. All that has been gained by avarice and ambition must be left behind. Factually, there can be no conflict between religion and science. Both are in difficulties when they attempt to dominate each other. On the physical plane of things, science has claimed a monopoly. No one can deny that it has bestowed many benefits upon mankind. Taking the humanist point of view that the mind is the lord of all it surveys, it has extended the empire of the intellect and supported its findings with convincing evidence. Unfortunately however, science has in many cases lost the human touch and left the average mortal to his own insufficient resources. Assuming that man’s present philosophy of living originated in the early years of the seventeenth century, we might reasonable assume that it would have found practical remedies for the trials and tribulations recorded in the recent history of mankind. Free from the censorship of theology and sup- ported by the wealth and confidence of intellectuals in every walk of life, it has handed the present generation a catastrophe, the magnitude of which we are just beginning to suspect."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"• 61 • The Bible, the Story of a Book Several scientists, some physicists, and an astronomer or two I have known have decided that their children should have religious training. It has oc- curred to these progressive thinkers that idealism provided the only available remedy for utter disillusionment. It is beginning to take religious convictions to enable scientists to survive their own technical achievement. The prevalent delusion seems to be that a religiously-oriented person is at a disadvantage in an intensely capitalistic society. Honesty has no recommendation these days, sincerity is not respected by one’s own family, and fidelity inhibits the gratifi- cation of physical pleasures. In spite of the present situation, or partly because of it, the Bible is again the world’s best-selling book. It is not necessarily piety that is contributing to this trend—it is fear, desperation, frustration, and the deadly suspicion that unless we change our ways in the relatively near future, we may be confronted with a retribution we have no desire to contemplate. When that time comes, we may need the Holy Bible even more than we need the Wall Street Journal. Progress is good, but only when it is under the discipline of integrity and common sense. This does not mean that we must accept without doubt that Samson had an unpleasant experience in the house of Delilah, or that Jonah was swallowed by a whale. These legends had heir origins in myths and fables of long ago. Most frequently they tie into ancient astronomical symbolism. Samson was a solar deity and, when the sun progresses annually into the sign of Virgo (the house of Delilah), its rays are shortened and it loses its strength. Jonah may be a symbolical prophecy bearing upon the death and resurrection of Christ. Ce- tus, the constellation of the great whale, was a symbol of the physical earth in which the body of Christ remained for three days before the Resurrection. An extensive article on the Bible appeared in Time magazine for December 30, 1974. A point is made that literalism is no longer a major issue. This takes care of the whale, and Jonah emerges as a stubborn man trying to avoid doing good for an enemy. Jonah resists a call from God to preach repentance to the sinners of Nineveh. In the Time article it is noted that no manner of scientific search can establish the reality of the call from God. This is not a miracle, but it is a supernatural idea.

We know also that Jesus himself made use of allegories in which spiritual truths were thinly veiled for the convenience of pious believers. In the Parable of the Good Seed, the disciples asked what the parable might mean and Jesus answered them: Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand. Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. (Luke 8:10-11) The use of parables occurs in both Testaments, and it is certainly not intended that they be taken literally. The stories of the Prodigal Son and the Good Samaritan are intended to inspire the faithful to practice the spiritual virtues by reforming their own natures and serving each other with sympathy and kindliness. In 1615, Otto van Veen did a series of emblems on the subject of divine love. In the edition of 1743 this is combined with a collection of holy subjects by Hermann Hugo. From this publication we have selected a well-known subject illustrating Psalm 142:7, Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me. This composition occurs also in Emblems, Divine and Moral by Francis Quarles, the most famous English exponent of sacred symbolism. A few lines of Quarles’s accompanying poem is indicative of such illustrations: My soul is like a bird; my flesh the cage, Wherein she wears her weary pilgrimage Of hours, as few as evil, daily fed With sacred wine, and sacramental bread; The keys that lock her in, and let her out, Are birth and death; ‘twixt both, she hops about From perch to perch, from sense to reason; them, From higher reason, down to sense again. Although the Ante-Nicene Fathers were aware of the inner mysteries of the Christian faith, a rising orthodoxy was content to disseminate the most literal"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"• 64 • Manly Palmer Hall possible explanations of the Christian mysteries. This is largely responsible for modern sectarianism. The search for fuller meaning is still an important factor in the continuing quest for the essential substance of the Christian revelation. When a belief must serve persons in different degrees of faith and insight, it is necessary to provide milk for babes and meat for men, and these words themselves become a kind of parable. In ancient times, the problem of insight seldom caused difficulties. The religion itself was presented on several levels of interpretation and the earnest follower could advance as his under- standing enlarged and matured. In more modern times, each of these levels becomes a distinct sect and there is little or no continuity in the search for understanding. This accounts for many of the changes in the translations of the biblical books. It also explains why orthodoxy actually means conformity with a specialized interpretation of the holy writings. The largest majority of those seeking spiritual consolation probably come nearest to the comprehension of the Christian mystery. They are in search of a strength beyond their own and a direct participation of the love of God in daily living. Their response to instruction is emotional and devotional. For such as these, the “old time religion” is sufficient if it is correctly understood. We would like to think of it as the “one time religion” that has always been and always will be. Sometime in the remote past, the priests and prophets became aware of one God and one revelation. It is the experience of this basic unity of realities that most completely fulfills the needs of the majority of humankind. The King James Version of the Bible comes the nearest to comforting troubled human souls. As personal ambitions expand, the Bible seems to lose its authority. The ambitious person goes out to live a life of his own and convinces himself that he is lord of all he surveys. Then troubles come, and it is evident that he must seek the consolation that can only result from making peace with Deity and the universal plan. There is an optimistic note that should be given full consideration. Our ancestors grew tired of worldliness in the closing years of life. Young people of today are already disillusioned and discouraged in their teens, and are ready to renounce the world before they have taken on any of its obligations.

Unfortunately however, theology is still unprepared for this influx of truth seekers. Unless religious organizations can provide the needed inspiration, the search will extend out- side the boundaries of Christendom. Foreign beliefs have one advantage. The average Westerner has not been disillusioned about teachings he has never previously explored. He is also likely to learn that the Christian Bible is highly respected by the members of numerous non-Christian beliefs. In 1929, my old friend Frank L. Riley, M.D., published a source book on religion entitled The Bible of Bibles . In the introduction Riley wrote, “A sym- pathetic, unbiased, study of the Sacred Books of the world will soon reveal the momentous fact that Truth, like a golden thread, runs through each and every one of them, binding all into one great chain.” While we have been taught for centuries to emphasize differences of belief, it would be the better part of valor to reconcile the opinionisms which threaten the survival of all world religions. Christians of all denominations derive their teachings from the Holy Bible. In the effort to preserve our privileges as a free people, per- haps we should remember the words of Christ, And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. (John 10:16) In the past, the tendency has been to spread the Gospel and its code of vir- tues to non-Christian countries. The principal denominations flourishing in the United States should make a strong statement of intersectarian brother- hood which can be interpreted as true fellowship in Christ. The Bible presents a basic charter for religious interdependence. NUREMBERG CHRONICLE Approximately forty years after the publication of the Gutenberg Bible, the citizens of Nuremberg decided to make a reputation for themselves in the sphere of printing. The production of an appropriate volume was entrusted to Anton Koberger whose twenty-four presses were being operated by nearly the same number of his own sons. The final achievement is now known as the Nuremberg Chronicle, sometimes referred to as the Picture Book of the Middle Ages . The scope of this massive volume was due to the energy and scholar- ship of Hartmann Schedel.

Wolgemut was one of the teachers of Albrecht Durer. The text is divided into seven ages covering the history of the world from the creation to the end of the fifteenth century. Three, sometimes four, blank leaves were inserted in the book so that future owners could continue the Chronicle until the end of the world. Folio CCXC contains a reference to the discovery of America. The opening pages of the Nuremberg Chronicle derive their inspiration en- tirely from the Bible and are illustrated by appropriate symbolical designs de- picting the seven days of creation. The frontispiece pictures Deity enthroned and surrounded by clouds. Facing this is a circular design featuring the dove of the Holy Spirit accompanied by members of the heavenly host. The next five diagrams are circular, each accompanied by a representation of the hand of God. The sixth day which shows the creation of Adam is reproduced here- with.

There is a fine illustration of Adam and Eve cast out of the Garden of Eden. A complicated genealogical tree shows the descent from Adam to the time of Noah. This followed by a map of the world distributed between the sons of Noah. Folio XLVII has a delightful woodblock representing the Queen of Sheba visiting King Solomon, reproduced herewith. There are a considerable number of repetitive illustrations which are used for church councils, earth- quakes, and natural disasters. These are repeated whenever such emergencies are mentioned. Gradually the drift is toward the secular with imaginary portraits of Hero- dotus, Sophocles, Zeno, and Socrates. Considering the time and the circum- stances involved in its production, the historical emphasis is more factual than might be expected. The drift from the biblical account of the creation to the secular events of biography and history is smoothly accomplished, and the entire compilation is held together by an intricate genealogical vinework which extends from the beginning to the end. While our historical knowl- edge is far greater than that possessed by the burghers of Nuremberg, the opening chapters of a modern work covering the same ground would present innumerable difficulties. Scholars of all types have labored with the three words “in the beginning,” and many in the end decide to fall back on the Holy Scriptures. The Bible has inspired and sustained a number of mystical and metaphysi- cal beliefs. All students of the Sacred Scriptures must be aware of the refer- ences to superhuman beings and supernatural circumstances. For example, at the time when Saul consulted the Witch of Endor, necromancy was a capital offense, according to the Bible punishable by death, but this does not alter the fact that the witch did summon the shade of Samuel who warned the King of his impending doom. Miracles are referred to in both Testaments, angels appear to mortals on a number of occasions, and Satan is clearly established as an embodied being. It is obvious that those who accept the Bible literally must also accept, though not necessarily practice, the supernatural arts and sciences described therein. Mysticism arises from man’s realization of his dependency upon intercessions of a Divine Power. Jewish mysticism may have originated in the doctrines of the Persians and the Chaldeans and reached its most com- prehensive form in the teachings of the Alexandrian Gnostics.

The cabala, the esoteric doctrine of Israel, is most clearly revealed through its extraordinary textbook Zohar, The Book of Splendor . Traditionally, this work is attributed to Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai, a disciple of Akiba. It was compiled in the second century A.D., but many have been reduced to written form in the early fourteenth century by Rabbi Moses of Leon. Baron Christian Knorr von Rosenroth was born in 1636 and is remem- bered especially for his publication of the first Latin version of Zohar. The work was issued under the title Kabbala Denudata Seu Doctina Hebraeorum. The work is in two volumes, quarto, with eighteen plates of cabalistic dia- grams, published in Frankfurt in 1677-84. Von Rosenroth believed that the doctrines of the cabalists were divine revelations and an esoteric key to both the Old and New Testaments. He appears to have been a Lutheran, but lived to see his daughter embrace the faith of the Catholic Church. There can be no doubt that he was naturally inclined to mystical speculations and was virtu- ally overwhelmed by the sublimity and sanctity of Jewish metaphysics. It was inevitable that the cabala should excite the curiosity of Christian mys- tics and metaphysicians. Bernard Pick, Ph.D., D.D., in his interesting little volume The Cabala, Its influence on Judaism and Christianity, Chicago: 1913, admits that cabalism has influenced modern philosophy and contains many fruitful and sublime thoughts. One of the first converts to cabalism according to Pick was Raymond Lully (1235-1316) venerated in the church as the Doc- tor Illuminatus. Another was Paul Ricci who lived in the sixteenth century, was a friend of Erasmus, and physician to the Emperor Maximillian I. Other illustrious Christian scholars of the fifteenth century who turned to cabalism were Count John Pico della Mirandola and John Reuchlin. All these men were well aware of the Aristotelian concepts of learning, were deeply involved in the mathematical philosophy of Pythagoras, and had a yearning to learn the esoteric secrets of the Gnostics. Reproduced herewith is the title page of a scarce volume by John Steebj, published in 1679. This book has an elaborate engraved publisher’s device and is devoted to a cabalistical study of the days of creation as set forth in the opening chapters of Genesis. In section 4 there is a diagram setting forth symbolically the division of light from darkness as described in Genesis 1:4. This design was inspired by a symbol reproduced by the Jesuit Father Athanasius Kircher in his volume Oedipus Aegyptiacus ."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"• 70 • Manly Palmer Hall Title page of the second volume of Kabbalae Denudatae by Knorr von Rosenroth.

From Coelum Sephiroticum of John Steebj, Mainz: 1679 In the last seventy years, there has been a strong revival of interest in eso- teric Christianity. Many new books on cabalism have appeared and most of the older works have been republished and in some instances are available in English for the first time. Protestant Christian mysticism spread rapidly in the years following the Reformation. The Bible became a household treasure and devout persons began to realize that the prevailing patterns for living were quite obviously contrary to the Divine Will. The need for a reformation of human society brought forth a number of secret organizations including the Rosicrucians, the alchemists, and the Utopians. Possibly the greatest of the Protestant mys- tics was Jakob Boehme, the German shoemaker who was born about the year 1575. He came from a devout Protestant family and received sufficient schooling to enable him to read the Sacred Scriptures. He left many works unfolding the inner mysteries of the Bible. Only one small volume written by Boehme was published during his lifetime. After his death a dedicated follower, Johann Gichtel, published Boehme’s writings illustrated with highly symbolical engravings, usually in the form of frontispieces. Among the later disciples of Boehme was William Law (1686-1761) who was sometime tutor to the Gibbon family. As a Jacobite, Law’s financial condition was insecure and in his later years he gave his heart and mind completely to the study of Boehme’s revelations."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"• 73 • The Bible, the Story of a Book Alexander Whyte (1837-1921) was a Scottish Doctor of Divinity who published a life of William Law and later a tribute to the memory of Jakob Boehme. In the library of our Society, we have a large scrapbook of Boehme’s symbols assembled by Alexander Whyte. The following figure is included in the Whyte collection. Six books are shown. The one at the upper center with the seven seals hanging from it and bearing the Agnus Dei represents the Bible. Reading clockwise is the human heart in the form of a book, then the New Testament, followed by a volume with the letters I. B. standing for Jakob Boehme. Next is the Old Testament, and lastly a volume decorated with the sun, moon, and stars. These represent the revelations of the Divine Principles. In addition to the Bible, God placed his seal in the human heart, the mystical writings of Boehme, and the heavens populated with solar systems. The in- scription tells that all these revelations are one in substance and emerge from the Divine Will. Warwick James Price in his excellent study of the Scriptures describes the Bible to be like a great temple twenty centuries in the building. He quotes Canon Liddel as follows: “The Old Testament is the nave with its side aisles of psalms and prophecy. The gospels are the choir, and John’s Gospel the very sanctuary, while around and behind are the epistles and the Apocalypse, a chancel ambulatory, each supplying an indispensable feature to the majestic whole.” Liddel’s analogy can be considerably expanded. Most of the great ca- thedrals of Europe were built on sites previously occupied by pagan temples. The great church of the Sacre Coeur in Paris stands on the crest of Montmar- tre, once sacred to the god Mars. Beneath the foundations of the Cologne Cathedral is the mosaic pavement of a Roman shrine. Many of these famous churches were restored, expanded, rebuilt, and ne- glected for generations. Perhaps most interesting of all, they were subject to the pressures of changing cultural trends. For a time, Cologne was considered old-fashioned and in desperate need of architectural updating. It was decided to redo the interior so that Deity might be glorified in a baroque setting. Fortunately, the project was abandoned. Throughout the world, religious ar- chitecture has received the approval of ages and, like the faiths they represent, they have been protected by a grateful humankind. Architecture in some strange way contributes to a mystical experience. To enter the vast fane of Chartres or Rheims is to leave the confusion of the mar- ketplace and be part of a quietude above and beyond the mortal sphere.

In those moments no one really seeks to rationalize the physical dimensions of the cathedral or basilica. The mind is overwhelmed by a mood which impresses the average visitor with the realization of his own dependence upon a Superior Power. The Divine Power dwells in the hearts of all living things and, under certain conditions, ordinary mortals may speak with the voices of angels. It is not the mind or the emotions which have elevated the Bible above all other writing of the Western world. The lofty sentiments have lifted up the human soul from the realm of uncertainties and established it on foundations of righteousness. When we gaze upon the wondrous spectacle of the Last Judgement on the wall of the Sistine Chapel with the knowledge that it was painted by Michel- angelo, a mortal person, gifted but still human, something within ourselves is overwhelmed by the mystic vision of the Divine Plan. We would not have it changed or have the figures repainted (although, unfortunately some changes were made). It is unthinkable that these great frescoes should be redone by some modern surrealist. A few beholders who never had any mystical en- lightenment within themselves might favor such revisions, but the spiritual impact of Michelangelo’s inspiration would be totally lost. Through the centuries, the Bible has inspired some of the noblest achieve- ments of mankind. It has bestowed the courage to reform corrupt laws, to liberate human souls from slavery and bondage, and to advance justice in private and public conduct. The final proof that the Scriptural Writings are supported by the universal plan is clearly stated by the medieval alchemists who declared that the will of God was made manifest in three ways. First through human beings who are strangely and wonderfully made, and third through the Holy Scriptures given to the world through the saints and sages he had sent forth. Inner strength is the only defense that most persons have against social in- justices. A dynamic faith in God’s power and his ever-present help in time of trouble is our first line of defense against war, crime, poverty, and intolerance. All the religions of the world are dedicated to honor and integrity. Those who oppose religion or try to discredit it are false to the very life within them- selves.
