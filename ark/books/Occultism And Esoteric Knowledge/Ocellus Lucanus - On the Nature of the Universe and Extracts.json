While both of these writers are obscure historically, the philosophical fragments which they have left to us are well worthy of the attention Mr. Taylor has bestowed upon them. Some additional information concerning Julius Firmicus Maternus may prove useful. He was Sicilian by birth, and according to his own statement was for some years a \"foren- sic pleader,\" but abandoned this profession in disgust. His principal interests were in philosophy and astrology, and he is included among those addicted to N eoplatonism. His offi- cial status seems to have been Imperial Notary of Byzan- tium. While Firmicus was writing his defense of judicial astrology, Constantine Magnus, Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire issued his edict condemning to death all who practised astrology or magical arts, but the imperial displeasure never descended upon Firmicus. It is possible that he served as prophet extraordinary to the Emperor and this patronage may have guaranteed his immunity. His principal work, Libri Matheseos, in eight books, was not completed until after 355 A.D. This volume presents a com- prehensive survey of judicial astrology according to the Egyptians and Babylonians. Thus Firmicus preserves for later ages the speculations, actual or traditional, of the ear- liest writers on astronomy, astrology and astro-theology. The fragment translated by Thomas Taylor is indicative of the erudition of Firmicus and the manner in which he pre- sents his material. The first section of the M atheseos is devoted to a defense of astrology.

From the third book of the Matheseos, Thomas Taylor has translated a short section entitled Thema Mundi, or Geniture of the World, describing the positions of the planets at the commencement of the several mundane periods. For the convenience of the reader we reproduce, as a frontispiece, the horoscope of the world as it appears in the 1533 edition of the Matheseos. It is one of the fifteen diagrams contained in this volume which is now in the Libr- ary of our Society. Proclus, surnamed the \"Platonic Successor,\" from whose writings Taylor translates certain select theorems, was born in Byzantium in 412 A.D. According to the older writers he was under the protection of the goddess Minerva, who encouraged him to visit Athens and devote his life to philosophy. While in Athens he met Syrianus, one of the most learned men of his time, and about 450 A.D. suc- ceeded him as the head of the N eoplatonic School of Athens. From this time on Proclus devoted his life exclusively to Platonic mysticism. This reprint is a photolithographic facsimile of the origi- nal edition with the type somewhat enlarged for greater ease in reading. It is hoped that the republishing of Thomas Taylor's writings will be of advantage to all friends of Philosophy. Manly P.

For science, truly so called, is, as Aristotle accu- rately defines it to be, the knowledge of things eternal, and which have a necessary existence. Hence it has for its basis universals, and not par- ticulars; since the former are definite, immutable, and real; but the latter are indefinite, are so in- cessantly changing, that they are not for a moment the same, and are so destitute of reality, that, in the language of the great Plotinus, they may be b"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"VI said to be \"shadows falling upon shadow *, like images in water, or in a mirror, or a dream.\" With respect to Ocellus Lucanus, the author of the first of these Tracts, though it is unknown at what precise period he lived, yet as Archytas, in his epistle to Plato (apud Diog.

Ocellus was first printed in Greek at Paris 1539, and afterwards with a Latin version by Chretien 1541; by Bosch 1554 and 1556; by Nogarola, Ven, 1559; by Commelin 1596; at Heidelberg 1598; Bologna, 1646, and revised by Vizanius 1661; and lastly, by Gale, Cambridge, 1671. Here are ten editions, the last of which is only 49 years prior to the year 1700; so that the universal consent had not yet been given to neglect this work. Let us see when it could have taken place afterwards. D' Argens' translation appeared in 1762. A new French translation by the Abbe Batteux was printed in 1'768; and he made it without knowing of the other. D' Argens' version was reprinted in 1794; and an amended Greek and Latin text by Rudolph was printed at Leipsic in 1801 ; so that there are in all fourteen known editions, of which Gale's is the best.

In addition to the testimonies of Plato and Aristotle in favour of this work, Philo, the plato- nizing Jew, says: 'Some are of opinion, that it was not Aristotle, but certain Pythagoreans, who first maintained the eternity of the world; but I have seen a treatise of Ocellus, in which he says, the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"x world was not generated, and is imperishable, and indeed he proves it by most exquisite reasoning.

He is likewise mentioned by Jamblichus in his Life of Pythagoras; by Syrianus in Aristot. Metaphys.; by Proclus in his Commentary on the 'Timreus of Plato, who, as we have shown in the Notes on Ocellus, demonstrates that he was wrong in ascri- bing two powers only instead of three to each of the elements; and in the last place, this Tract is cited by Stobeeus in Eel.

CHAP. I. OCELLUS LUCANUS has written what follows con- cerning the Nature of the Universe; having learnt some things through clear arguments from Nature herself, but others from opinion, in conjunction with reason *, it being his intention [in this work] to de- rive what is probable from intellectual perception. It appears, therefore, to me, that the Universe is indestructible and unbegotten, since it always was, and always will be; for if it had a temporal beginning, it would not have always existed: thus, therefore, the universe is unbegotten and inde- structible; for if some one should opine that it was once generated, he would not be able to find any- thing into which it can be corrupted and dissolved, since that from which it was generated would be the first part of the universe; and again, that into ;;< See Additional Notes, CA.)

But if the universe was generated, it was gene- rated together with all things; and if it should be corrupted, it would be corrupted together with all things. This, however, is impossible *. The uni- verse, therefore, is without a beginning, and with- out an end; nor is it possible that it can have any other mode of subsistence. To which may be added, that everything which has received a beginning of generation, and which ought also to participate of dissolution, receives two mutations; one of which, indeed, proceeds from the less to the greater, and from the worse to the better; and that from which it begins to change is denominated generation, but that at which it at length arrives, is called acme. The other mutation, however, proceeds from the greater to the less, and from the better to the worse: but the termina- tion of this mutation is denominated corruption and dissolution. \"\" The universe could not be generated together with all things, for the principle of it must be unbegotten ; since everything that is generated, is generated from a cause; and if this cause was also generated, there must be a progression of causes ad infinitum, unless the unbegotten is admitted to be the principle of the uni- verse. Neither, therefore, can the universe be corrupted together with all things; for the principle of it being unbegotten is also incorruptible; that only being corruptible, which was once gene- rated."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"3 If, therefore, the whole and the universe were generated, and are corruptible, they must, when generated, have been changed from the less to the greater, and from the worse to the better; but when corrupted, they must be changed from the greater to the less, and from the better to the worse. Hence, if the world was generated, it would receive increase, and would arrive at its acme; and again, it would afterwards receive de- crease and an end. For every nature which has a progression, possesses three boundaries and two intervals. The three boundaries, therefore, are generation, acme, and end; but the intervals are, the progression from generation to acme, and from acme to the end. The whole, however, and the universe, affords, as from itself, no indication of a thing of this kind; for neither do we perceive it rising into existence, or becoming to be, nor changing to the better and the greater, nor becoming at a certain time worse or less; but it always continues to subsist in the same and a similar manner, and is itself perpetually equal and similar to itself. Of the truth of this, the orders of things, their symmetry, figurations, positions, intervals, powers, swiftness and slowness with respect to each other; and, besides these, their numbers and temporal periods, are clear signs and indications. For all B2"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"4 such things as these receive mutation and diminu- tion, conformably to the course of a generated na- ture: for things that are greater and better acquire acme through power, but those that are less and worse are corrupted through imbecility of nature.

Those things, therefore, which are compre- hended in the world, have a congruity with the world; but the world has no concinnity with any- thing else, but is itself co-harmonized with itself. For all other things have not a consummate or self-perfect subsistence, but require congruity with things external to themselves. Thus animals re- quire a conjunction with air for the purpose of respiration, but sight with light, in order to see; and the other senses with something else, in order to perceive their peculiar sensible object.

In short, if the universe should be dissolved, it would either be dissolved into that which has an existence, or into nonentity. But it is impossible that it should be dissolved into that which exists, for there will not be a corruption of the universe if it should be dissolved into that which has a being; for being is either the universe, 01' a cer- tain part of the universe. Nor can it be dissolved into nonentity, since it is impossible for being either to be produced from non-beings, or to be dissolved into nonentity. The universe, therefore, is incorruptible, and can never be destroyed.

For water is tasteless and de- void of quality, yet is capable of receiving the sweet and the bitter, the sharp and the salt. Air, also, which is formless with respect to sound, is the re- cipient of words and melody. And darkness, which is without colour, and without form, becomes the recipient of splendour, and of the yellow colour and the white ; but whiteness pertains to the sta- tuary's art, and to the art which fashions figures from wax. Matter, however, has a relation in a different manner to the statuary's art; for in matter all things prior to generation are in capacity, but >ll' Aristotle, in his treatise on Generation and Corruption, has borrowed what Ocellus here says about the three things necessary to generation.

Hence matter [or a universal recipient] is necessary to the exist- ence of generation. The second thing which is necessary, is the ex- istence of contrarieties, in order that mutations and charges in quality may be effected, matter for this purpose receiving passive qualities, and an aptitude to the participation of forms. Contrariety is also necessary, in order that powers, which are natu- rally mutually repugnant, may not finally vanquish, or be vanquished by, each other.

Hence, the body, which is the object of sense in capacity, and ranks as a principle, is the first thing; but contrarieties, such as heat and cold, moisture and dryness, form the second thing; and fire and water, earth and air, have an arrangement in the third place. For these change into each other; but things of a contrary nature are without change. But the differences of bodies are two: for some of them indeed are primary, but others originate from these: for the hot and the cold, the moist and the dry, rank as primary differences; but the heavy and the light, the dense and the rare, have the relation of things which are produced from the primary differences. AU of them, however, are in number sixteen, viz. the hot and the cold, the moist and the dry, the heavy and the light, the rare and the dense, the smooth and the rough, the hard and the soft, the thin and the thick, the acute and the obtuse. But of all these, the touch has a knowledge, and forms a judgement; hence, also, the first body in which these differences exist in capacity, may be sensibly apprehended by the touch. The hot and the dry, therefore, the rare and the sharp, are the powers of fire; but those of water are, the cold and the moist, the dense and"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"14 the obtuse; those of air are, the soft, the smooth, the light, and the attenuated; and those of earth are, the hard and the rough, the heavy and the thick. Of these four bodies, however, fire and earth are the transcendencies and summits [ or extremities] of contraries. Fire, therefore, is the transcendency of heat, in the same manner as ice is of cold: hence, if ice is a concretion of moisture and frigi- dity, fire will be the fervour of dryness and heat. On which account, nothing is generated from ice, nor from fire *. Fire and earth, therefore, are the extremities of the elements, but water and air are the media, for they have a mixed corporeal nature. Nor is it possible that there could be only ODe of the ex- tremes, but it is necessary that there should be a contrary to it. Nor could there be two only, for it is necessary that there should be a medium, since media are opposite to the extremes. Fire, therefore, is hot and dry, but air is hot and moist; water is moist and cold, but earth is cold and dry. Hence, heat is common to nil' and fire; cold is common to water and earth; dryness to earth and fire; and moisture to water and air.

But when the moisture of air corrupts the heat of fire, from both of them fire will be generated; for the heat of air and the dryness of fire will still remain. And fire is hot and dry. When, however, the coldness of earth is cor- rupted, and the moisture of water, from both of them earth will be generated. For the dryness of earth, indeed, will be left, and the coldness of water. And earth is cold and dry. But when the heat of air, and the heat of fire are corrupted, no element will be generated; for the contraries in both these will remain, viz. the moisture of air and the dryness of fire. Moisture, however, is contrary to dryness. And again, when the coldness of earth, and in a similar manner of water, are corrupted, neither th us will there be any generation; for the dryness of earth and the moisture of water will remain. But dryness is contrary to moisture. And thus, we have briefly discussed the generation of the first bodies, and have shown how and from what sub- jects it is effected.

And that, indeed, which produces generation in another thing, is the whole of the region above the moon; but the more proximate cause is the sun, who, by his accessions and recessions, continually changes the air, so as to cause it to be at one time cold, and at another hot; the consequence of which is, that the earth is changed, and everything which the earth contains. The obliquity of the zodiac, also, is well posited with respect to the motion of the sun, for it like- wise is the cause of generation. And universally this is accomplished by the proper order of the universe; so that one thing in it is that which makes, but another that which is passive. Hence, that which generates in another thing, exists above the moon; but that which generates in itself, has a subsistence beneath the moon; and that which consists of both these, viz. of an ever-running divine body, and of an ever-mutable generated nature, is the world."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"19 CHAP. III. THE origin, however, of the generation of man was not derived from the earth, nor that of other animals, nor of plants; but the proper order of the world being perpetual, it is also necessary that the natures which exist in it, and are aptly ar- ranged, should, together with it, have a never- failing subsistence. For the world primarily al- ways existing, it is necessary that its parts should be co-existent with it: but I mean by its parts, the heavens, the earth, and that which subsists be- tween these; which is placed on high, and is de- nominated aerial; for the world -does not exist without, but together with, and from these. The parts of the world, however, being consub- sistent, it is also necessary that the natures, com- prehended in these parts, should be co-existent with them; with the heavens, indeed, the sun and moon, the fixed stars, and the planets; but with the earth, animals and plants, gold and silver; with the place on high, and the aerial region, pneumatic substances and wind, a mutation to that which is more hot, and a mutation to that which is more cold; . for it is the property of the heavens to subsist in conjunction with the natures which it comprehends; of the earth to support the plants c2 --.-\""},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"20 and animals which originate from it; and of the place on high, and the aerial region, to be consub- sistent with all the natures that are generated in it.

Violent corruptions, however, and mutations, take place in the parts of the earth; at one time, indeed, the sea overflowing into another part of the earth; but at another, the earth itself becoming dilated and divulsed, through wind or water latently entering into it. But an entire corruption of the arrangement of the whole earth never did happen, nor ever will. Hence the assertion, that the Grecian history derived its beginning from the Argive Inachus, must not be admitted as if it commenced from a certain first principle, but that it originated from some mutation which happened in Greece; for Greece has frequently been, and will again be, barbarous, not only from the migration of foreign-"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"21 ers into it, but from nature herself, which, though she does not become greater or less, yet is always younger, and with reference to us, receives a beginning. And thus much has been sufficiently said by me respecting the whole and the universe j and further still, concerning the generation and corruption of the natures which are generated in it, and the man- ner in which they subsist, and will for ever sub- sist; one part of the universe consisting of a nature which is perpetually moved, but another part of a nature which is always passive; and the former of these always governing, but the latter being al- ways governed. CHAP. IV. CONCERNING the generation of men, however, from each other, after what manner, and from what particulars, it may be most properly effected, law, and temperance and piety at the same time co- operating, will be, I think, as follows.

This, therefore, is one of the first things which it is necessary to survey,-that copu- lation should not be undertaken for the sake of voluptuous delight. In the next place, the co-ordination itself of man should be considered with reference to the whole, viz. that he is a part of a house and a city, and (which is the greatest thing of all) that each of the progeny of the human species ought to give completion to the world *, if it does not intend to '!Ii In the original, £9WT«, ~e /(,(.(,/ '7'nV UU'7'~V -To/ avdefAJ'7I'o/ O'UV'7'U~IV '7I'eo; '7'0 JAOV, J'T'/ p.£eo; v'7I'uexfAJV OII(,OU 'T'I /(,UI '7I'OAefAJ;, /(,(.(,1 'T'O P.£')I/llTOV /(,oo-p.ou, O'up.'7I'A~eOIJV OipUAU '7'0 u'7I'o')levop.evov 'T'OU'T'fAJV ~/('UO''7'OV, /(\" '7', A.

But if persons of this description procreate with libidinous insolence and intemperance, their off- spring will be miserable and flagitious, and will be execrated by gods and demons, and by men, and families, and cities. Those, therefore, who deliberately consider these things, ought not, in a way similar to irra- tional animals, to engage in venereal connections, but should think copulation to be a necessary good.

Hence, the former of these philosophers says, \" that in a city where the inhabitants do not know each other, there is no light, but profound darkness;\" and the latter, \"that as 10,000 inhabitants are too few for a city, so 100,000 are too many.\""},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"24 sequence, to cause them to abound with the most excellent men. For on this account men inhabit cities governed by the best laws, rightly manage their domestic affairs, and [if they are able] impart to their friends such political employments as are conformable to the polities in which they live, since they not only provide for the multitude at large, but [especially] for worthy men. Hence, many err, who enter into the connubial state without regarding the magnitude of [the power of] fortune, or public utility, but direct their attention to wealth, or dignity of birth. For in consequence of this, instead of uniting with females who are young and in the flower of their age, they become connected with extremely old women; and instead of having wives with a dispo- sition according with, and most similar to their own, they marry those who are of an illustrious family, or are extremely rich. On this account, they procure for themselves discord instead of con- cord; and instead of unanimity, dissention; con- tending with each other for the mastery. For the wife who surpasses her husband in wealth, in birth, and in friends, is desirous of ruling over him, contrary to the law of nature. But the hus- band justly resisting this desire of superiority in his wife, and wishing not to be the second, but the"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"25 first in domestic sway, is unable, in the manage- ment of his family, to take the lead. This being the case, it happens that not only families, but cities, become miserable. For families are parts of cities, but the composition of the whole and the universe derives its subsistence from parts*. It is reasonable, therefore, to admit, that such as are the parts, such likewise will be the whole and the aU which consists of things of this kind. And as in fabrics of a primary nature the first structures co-operate greatly to the good or bad completion of the whole work; as, for instance, the manner in which the foundation is laid in building a house, the structure of the keel in build- ing a ship, and in musical modulation the exten .. sion and remission of the voice; so the concordant condition of families greatly contributes to the well or ill establishment of a polity. Those, therefore, who direct their attention to the propagation of the human species, ought to guard against everything which is dissimilar and * For whole, according to the philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato, has a triple subsistence; since it is either prior to parts, or consists of parts, or exists in each of the parts of a thing. But a whole, prior to parts, contains in itselfparts causally. The universe is a whole of wholes, the wholes which it comprehends in itself (viz. the inerratic sphere, and the spheres of the planets and ele- ments) being its parts.

Hence, it is necessary that boys, and girls also while they are virgins, should be trained up in ex- ercises and proper endurance, and that they should be nourished with that kind of food, which is adapted to a laborious, temperate, and patient life. Moreover, there are many things in human life of such a kind, that it is better for the knowledge of them to be deferred for a certain time. Hence, it is requisite that a boy should be so tutored, as not to seek after venereal pleasures before he is twenty years of age, and then should rarely en- gage in them. This, however, will take place, if he conceives that a good habit of body, and conti- nence, are beautiful and honourable. It is likewise requisite that such legal institutes as the following should be taught in Grecian cities, viz. that connection with a mother, or a daughter, or a sister, should not be permitted either ill tem- ples, or in a public place'; for it is beautiful and advantageous that numerous impediments to this energy should be employed.

A temperate and salutary diet, therefore, is the first and greatest thing which should be attended to by him who wishes to beget children; so that he should neither be filled with unseasonable food, nor become in- toxicated, nor subject himself to any other pertur- bation, from which the habits of the body may be- come worse. But, above all things, it is requisite to be careful that the mind, in the act of copula- tion, should be in a tranquil state: for, from de- praved, discordant, and turbulent habits, bad seed is produced. It is requisite, therefore, to endeavour, with all possible earnestness and attention, that children may be born elegant and graceful, and that when born, they should be well educated.

Plato, as is evident from what is said in the Introduc- tion to this work, had seen this tract of Ocellus, and cor- rects him in what he here says, as he also did the opinions of other philosophers anterior to, or contemporary with him. For if Ocellus had spoken accurately, he should have said, \" that he had learnt some things through clear arguments from nature herself, but others from opinion in conjunction with irrational sense.\" For, as Proclus admirably demon- strates in his Commentary on the above passage from the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"31 Timteus of Plato, truly existing being is only to be appre- hended by us through illuminations from an intellect superior to the human, in conjunction with the energy of the summit oj our reasoning power; for such is the accurate meaning of AOYOS in this place. But opinion is a knowledge of sensibles conformable to reason, yet without being able to assign the cause of what it knows; and sense is an irrational knowledge of the objects to which it is passive, and the in- strument of sense is passion only. See the first volume of my translation of the Commentaries of Proc1us on the Timreus of Plato, P: 202, &c. Ocellus adds, \" that it is his intention [in this treatise On the Universe] to derive what is probable from intellectual perception.\" For in physiological discussions we must be satisfied with probability and an approximation to the truth. Hence, Proclus, in his Commentary on that part of the Timreus in which Plato says, \" What essence is to genera- tion, that truth is to faith,\" admirably observes as follows: \" The faith of which Plato now speaks is rational, but is mingled with irrational knowledge, as it employs sense and conjecture; hence, it is filled with much of the unstable. For receiving from sense or conjecture the OTL, or that a thing is, it thus explains causes. But these kinds of know- ledge have much of the confused and unstable. Hence, Socrates, in the Phredo, reprehends sense in many respects, because we neither hear nor see anything accurately. (( How, therefore, can the knowledge which originates from sense possess the accurate and the irreprehensible ? For the powers which use science alone, comprehend the whole of the thing known with accuracy; but those that energise with sense, are deceived, and deviate from accuracy, on account of sense, and because the object of knowledge is unstable. For, with respect to that which is material, what"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"32 can anyone say of it? since it is always changing and flow- ing, and is not naturally adapted to abide for a moment. But that which is celestial, in consequence of being remote from us, is not easily known, nor can it be apprehended by science, but we must be satisfied in the theory of it with an approximation to the truth, and with probability [instead of certainty]. For everything which is in place requires the being situated there, in order to a perfect knowledge of its nature. The intelligible, however, is not a thing of this kind,since it is not apprehended by us in place; for, where- ever anyone establishes his reasoning energy, there, truth being everywhere present, he comes into contact with it. But if it is possible to assert anything firm and stable about that which is celestial, this also is possible, so far as it par- ticipates of being, and so far as it can be apprehended by intelligence. For, if anything necessary can be collected concerning it, it is alone through geometrical demonstra- tions which are universal. But so far as it is sensible, it is difficult to be apprehended, and difficult to be surveyed.\"- See the first volume of my translation of Proclus on the Timeeus of Plato, p. ~91. In p. '29S, he also observes, \"that perfectly accurate ar- guments, and such as are truly scientific, are not to be ex- pected in physical discussions, but such as are assimilated to them. It is besides this requisite to know, that as the world is mingled from physical powers, and an intellectual and divine essence; for\" physical works, as the [ChaldeanJ Oracle says, co-subsist with the intellectual light of the father;\" thus, also, the discussion of the world makes a commixture of faith and truth. For things which are assumed from sense participate largely of conjectural discussion; hut things which commence from intelligibles, possess that which is irreprehensible, and cannot be confuted.\" And,"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"93 lastly, in p. 296, he adds, \" that the want of accuracy in the theory of the images of being, arises from .our imbe- cility; for, to the knowledge of them we require imagina- tion, sense, and many other organs. But the Gods con- tractedly contain these in their unity and divine intellection; for, in sublunary natures, we are satisfied in apprehending that which, for the most part, takes place on account of the instability of their subject matter. But again, in celestial natures, we are filled with much of the conjectural, through employing sense and material instruments. On this account we must be satisfied with proximity in the apprehension, of them, since we dwell remotely at the bottom, as it is said, of the universe. This also is evident from those that are con- versant with them, who collect the same things respecting them from different hypotheses; some things, indeed, through eccentrics, others through epicycles, and others through evolvents, [in all these] preserving the ph reno- mena,\" Shuttleworth, in his Astronomy, has demonstrated that the celestial phrenomena may be solved by the hypotheses of Ptolemy and Tycho Brahe, equally as well as by those of Copernicus. But astronomers of the present day, from not being skilled in the logic of Aristotle, are not aware that true conclusions may be deduced from false premises; and hence, because their theory solves the phren omena, they immediately conclude that it is true. Aristotle, in his Pos- terior Analytics, has incontrovertibly shown, \"that the things from which demonstrative science consists, must be necessarily true, the causes of, more known than, and prior to the conclusion.

Note to p. 14.-0cellus is wrong in ascribing two powers only to each of the elements, instead of three, as is clearly shown by Proclus, in the following extract from his adrni- rable Commentary on the Timeeus of Plato. \"There are some physiologists (says he) who ascribe one power to each of the elements; to fire indeed heat, to air frigidity, to water moisture, and to earth dryness; in so doing, entirely wandering from the truth. In the first place, because they subvert the world and order. For it is impossible for things to be co-adapted to each other, when they possess the most contrary powers, unless they have something in common. In the next place, they make the most contrary natures allied to each other, viz. the hot to the cold, and the moist to the dry \". It is necessary, however, to make things which are hostile more remote than things which are less foreign. For such is the nature of contraries. In the third place, therefore, the first two powers will have no sympathy what- ever with the rest, but will lie divulsed t from each other. For it is impossible to say what is common to humidity and frigidity. And in addition to all these things, as the ele- ments are solids, they will not be conjoined to each other by any medium. It has however been shown that it is not pos- sible for solids to be conjoined through one medium. Nor can they be conjoined without a medium. For this is alone the province of things that are perfectly without interval. \" But some others, as Ocellus, who was the precursor of Timeeus, attribute two powers to each of the elements; to ., For '1'0 EV~V'l'ltd'l'~'I'\" here, read '1'«.

And these things are written by this man in his treatise On Nature. In what, therefore, do these err who thus speak? In the first place, indeed, wishing to dis- cover the common powers in the elements, in order that they may preserve the co-arrangement of them with each other, they no more assign communion than separation to them, but equally honour their hostility and their harmony. What kind of world, therefore, will subsist from these; what order will there be of things which are without arrangement and most foreign, and of things which are most allied and co-arranged? For things which in an equal degree are hos- tile and peaceful, will in an equal mode-dissolve and consti- tute communion. But this communion being similarly dis- solved, and similarly implanted, the universe will no more exist than not exist. In the second place, they do not assign the greatest contrariety to the extremes, but to things most remote from the extremes; though we everywhere see, that of homogeneous natures, those which are most distant have the nature of contraries, and not those which are less di- stant. How likewise did nature arrange them, since they are most remote in their situation from each other? Was it not by'perceiving their contrariety, and that the third was more allied than the last to the first? How, also, did she arrange the motions of them, since fire is most light and tends up- ward, but earth is most heavy and tends downward? But whence were the motions of them which are most contrary derived, if not from nature? If, therefore, nature distributed to them most contrary motions, it is evident that they are themselves most contrary. For as the motions of simple beings are simple, and those things are simple of which the D 2"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"36 motions are simple, thus also those things are most contrary of which the motions are most contrary. And this may occasion some one to wonder at Aristotle, who, in what he says about motion, places earth as most contrary to fire; but in what he says about powers, he makes the most re- mote of similar natures to be more friendly than those that are proximate, when they are moved with most con- trary motions. For, as the elements have contrary places in their positions, as they have contrary motions in lations, as they have contrary powers, gravity and levity, through which motions subsist in their forms, thus also they have contrary passive qualities. Aristotle himself likewise mani; fests that earth is contrary to fire. For wishing to show that it is necessary there should be more bodies than one, he says: \"Moreover, if earth exists, it is also necessary that fire should exist. For in things, one of the contraries of which naturally is, the other likewise has a natural subsistence.\" So that neither was he able after any other manner. to show that there are more elements than one, than hy asserting that fire is contrary to earth. \" Further still, as the elements are solids, how can they he bound together through one medium? For this- is impossible in solids, as we have before observed. Hence those who assert these things, neither speak mathematically nor physi- cally, but unavoidably err in both these respects. For phy- sical are derived from mathematical entities. Timeus there- fore alone, or any other who rightly follows him, neither attri- butes one or two powers alone to the elements, but triple powers; to fire indeed tenuity ofparts, acuteness, and facility of motion; to air, tenuity if parts, obtuseness, and facility if motion; to tcater, grossness if parts, obtuseness, and facility if motion; and to ear-th, grossness of parts, obtuseness, and dijJiculty 0/ motion."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"37 But this is in order that each of the elements may have two powers, each iii of which is common to the element placed next to it, and one power which is different, in the same manner as it was demonstrated in mathematical numbers and figures; this different power being assumed from one of the extremes; and also in order that earth, according to all the powers, may subsist oppositely to fire; and that the extremes may have two media, and the continued quantities two; the latter having solids for the media, but the former, common powers. For let fire indeed be attenuated in its parts, acute, and easily moved. For it has an attenuated essence, and is acute, as having a figure of this kind [i. e. a pyramidal figure], and on this account is incisive and\" fugitive t, and permeates through all the other elements. It is also moved with facility t, as being most near to the celestial bodies, and existing in them. For the celestial fire itself is moved with celerity, as is likewise sublunary fire, which is perpetually moved in conjunction with it, and according to one circle, and one impulse. Since, therefore, earth is contrary to fire, it has contrary powers, viz. grossness, obtuseness, and diffi- culty of motion, all which we see are present with it. But these being thus hostile, and being solids, are also similar solids. For their sides and their powers are analogous.

Hence, since fire has for its three physical sides the triple powers, tenuity, acuteness, and facility of motion, by taking away the middle power, acuteness, and introducing instead of it obtuseness, we shall produce air, which has two sides of fire, but one of earth, or two powers of fire, but one of earth; as it is fit that what is near should rather communicate with it, than what is separated in the third rank from it. \"Again, since earth has three physical powers, contrary to the powers of fire, viz. grossness of parts, obtuseness, and difficulty of motion; by taking away difficulty of motion, and introducing facility of motion, we shall produce water, which consists of gross parts, is obtuse, and is easily moved; and which has indeed two sides or powers common with earth, but receives one from fire. And thus these media will be spontaneously conjoined with each other; communi- cating indeed in twofold powers, but differing in similitude by one power; and the extremes will be bound together by two media. Each element also will thus be in a greater de- gree conjoined to, than separated from, the element which is near to it; and one world will he perfectly effected through all of them, and one harmonious order, through the predominance of analogy.

And we say, that if we fashion bodies from two powers, one medium would conjoin the elements to each other. But since, as we assert, bodies possess triple powers, they are bound together by two media. For there are two common powers of the adjacent media, and one power which is different. And the extremes themselves, if they consisted of two powers, would be conjoined through one medium.

At the same time, however, he asserts that Timeeus perhaps sup- posed the world to be generated, for the sake of perspicuity.

For this it is which deceives the multitude, when they conceive the word gene- 'rated to imply a temporal origin.

That also is said to be generated, which, in mental conception, subsists as a compo- site, though it never has been a composite. Thus, in music, the middle chord is said to be composed of the lowest and highest chord. For though it is not thus composed, yet there is perceived in it the power of the one with reference to the other. The like also takes place in flowers and animals. In the world, therefore, composition and mixture are perceived; according to which, we are able to withdraw and separate qualities from it, and re- solve it into a first subject. The world also is said to be generated, because it al ways subsists in be, coming to be, like Proteus changing into all-various forms; hence, with respect to the world, the earth, and the natures, as far as to the moon, are con- tinually changed into each other. But the natures above the moon are as to their subject nearly the same, sustaining only a small mutation. They change, however, according to- figure; just as a dancer being one and the same according to sub- ject, is changed into various forms by a certain gesture and Illation of the hands. The celestial bodies, therefore, are thus changed, and different habitudes of them take place, between the motions of the planets with reference to the fixed stars, and of the fixed stars with respect to the planets. \" The world, likewise, may be said to be gene-"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"44 rated, because it derives its existence from some- thing different from itself, viz. from God, by whom it is adorned. Thus, also, with those who directly admit that the world is perpetual, the moon pos- sesses a generated light from the sun, though there never was a time when the former was not illumi- nated by the latter. If, therefore, some one as- serts that the world is generated according to Plato, conformably to these significations of the word, what he says may be admitted. But so far as the term 'generated' signifies a certain time, and that the world, formerly not existing, was after- wards generated, this signification, when applied to the world, must by no means be granted. Plato himself, indeed, indicates how what he asserts is to be understood, when he says, 'It must be investigated, whether the universe always was, hav- ing no principle whatever of generation, or whether it was generated, commencing its generation from a certain cause.' For the words, 'no principle whatever,' and 'from a certain cause,' manifest he does not intend that a temporal principle should be assumed; but that what he says, is to be under- stood in the same way, as when we say that the history of the Ephori commenced in the descend- ants of Hercules. Others say, that the world had a beginning from the Derniurgus. For the Demi- urgus is a principle, and so likewise is the para-"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"45 digm of the universe, and matter. But matter cannot be properly said to be a principle. Again, Plato does not say that the world is a body, but that it has a body; indicating by this, that so far as it possesses a corporeal nature, the very being of which consists in becoming to be, it may be said to be generated.\" Again, Taurus, in the same Commentaries on the Timreus, having cited the following passage from that dialogue, viz. \"We who are about to speak concerning the universe, whether it is gene- rated, or without generation,\" observes: \"Plato says this, though the world is unbegotten., And the poet, , Though in their race posterior found,' Plato, however, for the sake of discipline, speaks of the world which is unbegotten, as if it was ge- nerated.\" Shortly after this, Taurus says, \"What, therefore, are the causes through which the world being unbegotten, is supposed to be generated?\" Both these inquiries *, indeed, deserve to be phi- losophically investigated. For one of them excites to piety, but the other is assumed for the sake of elucidation. For Plato, knowing that the multitude apprehend that alone to be a cause which has a precedency in time, and not conceiving it to be \"'\" viz. Whether the world is unbegotten, or generated."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"46 possible for anything otherwise to be a cause, and also inferring, that, from this opinion, they might be led to disbelieve in the existence of Providence; wishing likewise to inculcate this dogma, that the world is governed by Providence, he tacitly mani- fests it to those who are abundantly able to under- stand that the world is unbegotten according to time; but to those who are not able to understand this, he indicates that it is generated. He is also anxious that they may believe this, in order that at the same time they may be persuaded in the existence of Providence. But the second cause which induced Plato thus to write, is this,-that assertions are then more clear, when we meet with them as with things which actually take place. Thus geometricians compose diagrams as if they were generated, though they are not composites. And Euclid defines a circle, as being more simple, to be a plane figure, comprehended under one line, to which all lines falling from one point within the figure are equal to each other. But wishing to explain a sphere, he defines it, as if it was among the number of things generated, to be formed by the revolution of a semi-circle about the diameter, until it returns to the same point from which it began to be moved. If, however, he had intended to explain the sphere which already ex- isted, he would have defined it to be a solid figure,"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"47 comprehended under one superficies, to which all right lines falling from one point within the figure, are equal to each other. But it was usual with Plato, for the sake of discipline, to unfold things which are without generation *, as if they were generated. Thus, in the Republic, he introduces the city as being made, in order that in the forma- tion of it, the generation of justice might become more manifest. When, however, Theophrastus says, that perhaps Plato speaks of the world as generated for the sake of elucidation, just as we consider geometrical diagrams to be generated, perhaps generation does not subsist similarly in diagrams. Aristotle also asserts the same thing; for he says, that in diagrams it is 110t proper in the beginning to suppose contraries, but this is to be admitted in the generation of the world; just as if some one should suppose motion and rest, order and disorder. N either, therefore, do all things require invariable paradigms; but the examples show that it is not more obvious to assert that the world is generated, than that it is unbegotten.

For we have shown after what manner the world is unbegotten, and how it is said by Plato to be generated.

For as the Sun alone, when he is in Leo, causes summer, but when he is in Capricorn winter, and thus the year is formed, which is so denominated, because the Sun tends to one and the same point (mal/70S), for his restitution is from the same to the same,-in like manner there is an arrange- ment of all the planets effected in long periods of time, which pro- duces the great year. For if all the planets becoming vertical, heat in the same manner as the sun, but departing from this vertical position refrigerate, it is not unreasonable to suppose, that when they become vertical, they produce a great summer, but when they have departed from this position, a great winter. In the great win- ter, therefore, the continent becomes sea, but in the great summer the contrary happens, in consequence of the burning heat, and there being great dryness where there was moisture.\" At the end too of this first book of Aristotle on Meteors, Olympiodorus ob- serves, \"that when the great winter happens, a part of the earth being deluged, a change then takes place to a more dry condition, till the great summer succeeds, which however does not cause the corruption of all the earth. For neither was the deluge of Deu- calion mundane, since this happened principally in Greece.\" See the volume of my Aristotle containing this Treatise on Meteors, p. 478, &c. Firmicus, therefore, is mistaken in asserting that a deluge follows a conflagration; since the contrary is true. For it is obviously necessary that places which have been innndated should afterwards become dry, or they would no longer be habitable."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"57 tion of generative seeds becoming prolific.

Nor was this improperly devised. For because the first origin of the world (C) [i. e. the beginning of the first mundane period] was uncultivated and rude, and savage through rustic association, and also because barbarous men, having entered on the first vestiges of light, and which were unknown to them, were destitute of reason, in consequence of having abandoned humanity*, these divine men were of opinion, that this rustic and barbarous time was Saturnian, that, in imitation of this star, the beginning of life might be characterized by barbaric and inhuman ferocity. After Saturn, Jupiter received periodical power.

After Mars, Venus received pre- dominating power, in order that, human disci- plines gradually increasing, prudence and wisdom might adorn mankind. Hence they were of opi- nion that this time, in which the manners of men were cultivated by learning, and naturally formed to rectitude by the several.' disciplines, was under the dominion of Venus; so that being protected by the majesty of this joyful and salutary divinity, they might govern their erroneous actions by the ruling power of Providence.

On this account these wise men thought that this last period should be assigned to Mercury (d), so that, in imitation of that star, the human race might give birth to inventions replete with evil *. \" That nothing, however, may be omitted by us requisite to the elucidation of this subject, all things are to be explained, which prove that man was formed in the imitation and similitude of the world t.

For as often as, through the natural ardour of heat, the human body is too much relaxed, it evaporates in conse- quence of the inundations of humours; and thus it always suffers a decoction from a fiery ardour, or is dissolved by excessive desudation. Nor do the wisest interpreters of the medical art assert, that the substance of the human race is dissolved by a natural termination in any other way, than by either moisture dissolving fire, or again heat pre- dominating, fire being inwardly and deeply extin- guished, is left without moisture.

He is also mentioned by J uvenal, vi. 580. \" Aptior hora cibo nisi quam dederit Petosiris.\" And in a Greek epigram (in Antho1. lib. ii. cap. 6.) on a certain person who had predicted his death from the stars, and, in order that the prediction might not be falsified, hung himself, it is said: aLO'XVy(J€LS II€ToO'LpLY a7rrJy~aTb KeLL fl€T€WPOS e~lrJO'K€L, &c. 1. e. \"Lest Petosiris should incur disgrace, Himself he strangled from a lofty place.\" Thus, too, it is related of Card an, the celebrated physician and astrologer, that having predicted the year and day of his death, when the time drew near, he suffered himself to perish through hunger, to preserve his reputation. My worthy and most intelligent friend Mr. J. J. Welsh has fur- nished me with the following additional information con- cerning the death of Cardan, and other astrologers: \"Re- specting Cardan's abstaining from food, in order to verify his prediction, Thuanus says: 'Cum tribus diebus minus sep- tuagesimum quintum annum implevisset, eadem quo pree- dixerat anno et die, videlicet XI.

Cardanwas not the only astrologer who foretold the time of his own death; for Mar- tin Hortensius, Professor of Mathematics in Amsterdam, not only predicted the time of his own death, but that of two young men who were with him, and the result proved the truth of his prophecy. The fact is admitted by Descartes, while he ridicules the science and underrates the abilities of Hortensius. See the 35th of his Letters to Father Mersenne, in the second volume of that collection. \" When Ann of Austria, the wife of Louis XnI., was de- livered of the Dauphin, afterwards Louis XIV., a famous German astrologer was in attendance to draw his nativity, but refused to say more than these three words, which give a true character of Louis the Fourteenth's reign; Diu, dure, feliciter, See Limier's Hist. du Regne de Louis XIV. \" I omitted to mention above, a curious circumstance re- lated of Card an in Lavrey's Hist. of England, vol. i.

He is praised by Pliny, by Galen, ix, p.2. De Facultat. Simplicium Medicament., and from him by Aetius. (b) Page 56.-Produs in Tim. lib. iv, p.277, informs us, that the Chaldeans had observations of the stars, which embraced whole mundane periods. What Proclus likewise asserts of the Chaldeans is confirmed by Cicero in his first book on Divination, who says that they had records of the stars for the space of 370,000 years; and by Diodorus Siculus, Bibl. lib. xivp. 1.13, who says, that their observa- tions comprehended the space of 413,000 years. Plato, in the 'I'imeeus, speaking of this greater apocata- stasis, says: \",At the same time, however, it is no less pos- sible to conceive, that the perfect number of time will then accomplish a perfect year, when the celerities of all the eight periods being terminated with reference to each other, shall have a summit, as they are measured by the circle, of that which subsists according to the same and the similar [i. e. according to the sphere of the fixed stars].\" On this passage, Proclus, in his Commentary, observes as fuliows: \" The whole mundane time measures the one life of the universe, according to which all the celerities are ter- minated of the celestial and sublunary circles. For in these also there are periods, which have for the summit of their apocatastasia the lation of the circle of the same [1. e. of the sphere of the fixed stars ].

Thus, for instance, all of them make their apocata- stasis about the equinoctial point *, or about the summer tropic; or though the joint apocatastasis should not be con- sidered to he according to the same point, but with refe- rence to the same, when, for instance, rising or culminat- ing, yet all of them will have with reference to it a figure of such a kind. For now the present order is entirely a cer- tain apocatastasis of all the heavenly bodies, yet the confi- guration is not seen about the same, but with reference to the same point. Once, however, it was about the same, and according to one certain point, at which if it should again take place, the whole of time will have an end. One cer- tain apocatastasis likewise seems to have been mentioned; hence it is said that Cancer is the horoscope of the world, and this year is called Cynic, or pertaining to the Dog, be- cause, among the constellations, the splendid star of the Dog rises together with Cancer. If therefore the planets should again meet in the same point of Cancer, this con- currence will be one period of the universe. If, however, the apocatastasis takes places in Cancer about the equinoc- tial point, that also which is from the summer tropic will be directed towards the summer tropic, and the number of the one will be equal to the number of the other, and the time of the one to the time of the other. For each of them is one period, and is defined by quantity, on account of the order of the bodies that are moved. In addition, however, to what has been said, it must be observed, that this perfect number differs from that mentioned in the Republic, which * For JI10fUf;J\"OV here, it is enviously necessary to read JI1't1p,'eIVOV.

Hence, likewise, it is the lord of the period of the human race.\" \" The year (says Macrobius) which is called mundane, is truly revolving, because it is effected by a full convolution of the universe, and is evolved in the most extended. periods of time, the reason of which is as follows: All the planets and the stars which are seen fixed in the heavens, the pecu- liar motion of the latter of which though the human sight has never been able to perceive or apprehend, are yet moved, and, besides the revolution of the heavens by which they are always drawn along, have an advancing motion of their own. This motion, however, is completed in such a length of time, that the life of man is not sufficiently extended to discover, ~y continual observation, their mutation to the place in which they were first seen. The end, therefore, of the mundane year is, when all the planets and all the fixed stars have returned from a certain place to the same place, so that no star in the heavens may be situated in a place different from that in which it was before, since all the other stars, when moved from that place to which they return, give a termination to their year; so that the luminaries 'il' See my explanation of this perfect, which is also called the geometric number, in p. 150 of my Theoretic Arithmetic.

This, however, according to the decision of physiologists, will take place at the expiration of 15,000 years; hence, as the lunar year is a month, and the solar year consists of twelve months, and the years of the other planets are those which we have before mentioned, so the mundane year con- sists of\"15,000 of such years as we ~ow compute. This year, therefore, is called the truly 1'evolving year, which is not measured by the retrogression of the sun, i. e. of one planet, but is terminated by the return of all the planets to the same place, under the same descript.ion of the whole heavens; from whence also it is called mundane, because the world is properly called heaven. Hence, as we not only denomi- nate the progression of the sun from the kalends of January to the same kalends, the solar year, but also its progression from the day after the kalends to the same day, and its return from any day of any month to the-same day, a year; thus, also, the beginning of this mundane year may be fixed by anyone at any time he pleases. Thus, for instance, Cicero now, from an eclipse of the sun, which hap- pened at the time of the death of Romulus, supposes the beginning of the mundane year to commence. And though frequently afterwards an eclipse of the sun may have hap- pened, yet a repeated eclipse of this luminary is not said to give completion to the mundane year; but then this comple- tion takes place when the sun, during its eclipse, will be in the same places and parts, and likewise all the planets and fixed stars, in which they were at the time of the death of Romulus. Hence, as physiologists assert, 15,000 years after the death of Romulus the sun will again be so eclipsed, that"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"67 it will be in the same sign, and in the same part of the heavens, as it was at that time; all the stars likewise re- turning to the same place.\"-Macrob. in Somn.

This greater apocatastasis is also alluded to by Synesius in his treatise On Providence, and likewise in the Asclepian Dialogue ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus. The extract from Synesius, who informs us that his treatise is an Egyp- tian narration relative to Osiris and Typhos, is as follows: \" Some time after this, Typhos obtained the kingdom by fraud and force, and Osiris was banished: but during the evils arising from the tyrannical government of Typhos, some God manifestly appeared to a certain philosopher who was a stranger in Egypt, and who had received great bene- fits from Osiris, and ordered him to endure the present cala- mities,hecause they were months only, and not years, in which the Fates had destined that the Egyptian sceptres should raise the nails of the wild beasts*, and depress the heads of the sacred birds t. But this is an arcane symbol. And the philosophic stranger above mentioned knew that a represen- tation of this was engraved in obelisks and in the sacred recesses of the temples. The divinity also unfolded to him the meaning of the sacred sculpture, and gave him a sign of the time in which it would be verified. For when those, said he, who are now in power, shall endeavour to make an innova- tion in our religion, then in a short time cfter expect that the \"\" i, e. material deernons, or S\"eES %~OVOS, the 'wild beasts qf the earth, as they are called in the Chaldean oracles. t i. e. the whole choir of beneficent natures superior to ~an.

If, however, some remains of the sedition should still exist, and the whole should not be at once extinguished, but 'l'yphos should still remain in the seat of government, nevertheless do not despair of the Gods. The following also is another symbol for you. When we shall purify the air which sur- rounds the earth, and which is defiledeoab the breath if the im- pious, with fire and water, then the punishment if the rest will alsofollow, and then immediately expect a better order if things, Typhos being removed. For we expel such-like prodigies by the devastation if fire and thunder. In consequence of this, the stranger considered that to be a felicitous circumstance, which had before appeared to him to be dreadful, and no longer bore with molestation a necessary continuance in life, through which he would be an eye-witness of the advent of the Gods; for it exceeded the rower of human sagacity to conjecture, that so powerful a multitude as were then col- lected together in arms, and who even in time of peace were by law obliged to be armed, should be vanquished without any opposition. He considered with himself, therefore, how these things could be accomplished, for they appeared to surpass the power of reason. But after no great length if time, a certain depraoed fragment if religion, and an adultera- tion of divine soorship, like that if money, as it were, preoailed, which the ancient law exterminated from cities, shutting the doors against impiety, and expelling it to a great distance {rom the walls. Typhos, however, did not himself introduce this im- piety, for he feared the Egyptian multitude, but for this purpose called in the assistance of the Barbarians, and erected a tem- ple in the city, having previously subverted the laws of his country. When these things, therefore, came to pass, the stranger began to think that this was the event which divi-"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"69 nity had predicted. t And perhaps,' said he, ' I shall be a spectator of what will follow.' He likewise then learnt some particulars about Osiris, which would shortly happen, and others which would take place at some greater distance of time, viz. when the boy Horus would choose, as his associate in battle, a wolf instead of a lion. But who the wolf is, is a sacred narration, which it is not holy to divulge, even in the form of a fable.\" Typhos, however, through his tyranny, was at length dethroned, and Osiris recalled from exile; and Synesius, towards the end of this treatise, observes, 4( that the blessed body which revolves in a circle is the cause of the events in the sublunary world. For both are parts of the universe, and they have a certain relation to each other. If, there- fore, the cause of generation * in the things which surround us originates in the natures which are above us, it follows that the seeds of things which happen here descend from thence. And if some one should add, since astronomy im- parts credibility to this, that there are apocatastatic t periods of the stars and spheres, some of which are simple, but others compounded; such a one will partly accord with the Egyptians, and partly with the Grecians, and will be per- fectly wise from hoth, conjoining intellect to science. A man of this kind therefore will not deny, that, in conse- quence of the same motions returning, effects also will re- turn, together with their causes; and that lives on the earth, generations, educations, dispositions, and fortunes, will he the same with those that formerly existed.

In the second place, that this dia- logue is of genuine antiquity and no forgery, is, I think, unquestionably evident from neither Lactantius nor Augus- tin having any doubt of its authenticity, though it was their interest to have proved it to be spurious if they could, be- cause it predicts, (which is the third thing especially deserv- ing of remark,) that the memorials of the martyrs should succeed in the place of the temples of the Gods.

(c) Page 57.- This first period of the world, which was uncultivated and rude, and, according to Firmicus, was under the dominion of Saturn, is mentioned by Plato at the begin- ning of his third book On Laws. For there having ob- served that time is infinite, he says, \"that myriads upon myriads of cities have existed in this time, and that, in con. sequence of the same temporal infinity, as many have been destroyed.\" He also says, \"that they will everywhere have been governed according to every kind of polity; and at one time pass from the less to the greater, and at another from the greater to the less, and have become worse from the better, and better from the worse.\" He adds, \"that the pause of this mutation, viz. the many destructions of the human race, is through deluges, diseases, and numerous other things, in which a very small part of mankind was left •.•.. \" After this he observes, \"that those who escaped the destruction which was caused by a deluge, were nearly mountain shepherds, a few dormant sparks of the human race, preserved on the summits of mountains. That such as these must necessarily have been ignorant of other arts, and of those artifices, in cities, of men towards each other, with a view to prerogative and contention, and other base ends.\" He also supposes\" that the cities which were situated in plains, and those bordering on the sea, entirely perished at that time. That hence, all instruments were destroyed, together with every invention pertaining to art, political"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"78 discipline, or anything else characterized by wisdom.\" He adds, \" We must therefore assert, that when that devasta- tion by a deluge took place, human affairs were in a state of infinite and dreadful solitude; that a prodigious part of the earth was unprolific; and other animals having perished, some herds of oxen, and a few' goats, which were rarely found, supplied thos'e men with food that escaped the devas- tation.\" See what the divine philosopher further observes on this interesting subject, in my Translation of this book of his Laws. The reader, however, must be careful not to confound this Saturnian period with the golden age, which also was under Saturn. For the latter, says Damascius (apud Phot.), consisted of a: race of men proximate to, the gods, and is most magnificently celebrated by poets who were seated on the tripos of the-Muse. But by the golden-age, as Proc1us on Hcsiod beautifully observes; \"anintellectuallife'ls im- , plied. For such a life is pure, impassive, and free from sorrow; and of this impassivity and purity gold is. an image, because it is never subject to rust or putrefaction. Such a life, too, is very properly said to be under Saturn, because Saturn is an intellectual god.\"-See. more concerning. this Divinity in the Additional Notes at the end of the' 5th voL of my Plato, p. 675, &c. (d) Page 59.-' Plato, in the eighth book of his Republic; speaking of the di~solution of the city which he has' consti- tuted, observes as follows: ., Not only with respect to ter- restrial plants, but likewise in terrestrial animals, a fertility and sterility of soul as well as of body takes place, when the revolutions of the heavenly bodies complete the periphery of their respective orbits; which are shorter to the shorter lived, and contrarywise to such as are the contrary.\" The"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"79 necessity for such a mutation taking place is this (as I have observed in the Introduction to my Translation of Aristotle's History of Animals),-that all the parts of the universe are unable to participate the providence of divinity in a similar manner, but some of its parts enjoy this perpetually, and others only for a time; some in a primary, and others in a secondary degree. For the universe, being a perfect whole, must have a first, a middle. and a last part. But its first part, as having the most excellent subsistence, must always exist according to nature; and its last part must sometimes subsist according to, and sometimes contrary to, nature. lIence the celestial bodies, which are the first parts of the universe, perpetually subsist according to nature, both the whole spheres and the multitude co-ordinate to these wholes's, and the only alteration which they experience is a mutation of figure, and variation of light at different periods; but in the sublunary region, while the spheres of the elements remain, on account of their subsistence as wholes, always according to. nature, the parts of these wholes have some- times a natural, and sometimes an unnatural subsistence; for thus alone can the circle of generation unfold all the variety which it contains. The different periods in which these mutations happen are called by Plato, with great propriety, periods offertility and ster'ility; for in these periods a fertility or sterility of men, irrational animals, and plants takes place; so that in fertile periods mankind will be both more numerous, and upon the whole superior in mental and bodily endowments, to the men of a barren period.

It appears to me that this period commenced in the time of Sylla, and I found this opinion on the following passage in Plutarch's Life of that great commander:- To O€ 71\"UYTWY fL€YUJ'TOY, €~ aJlfep€AOV Kat owdJpov TOV 71\"€pt€XOJlTOS rJXrJU€ epWYrJ UUA7I\"lyyOS, O~VY a7l\"OT€tJlOVUa Kat (JPrJJlWOlJ epOOyyOJl, WUT€ 71\"UI'TaS €KeppOJlaS y€y€uOut, KC/.L KaTa7l\"TrJ~Ul TO fL€Y€Oos.

The Tuscan WIse men and soothsayers, therefore, declared that this prodigy signified the mutation into and commencement of another age. For according to them there are eight ages, differing from each other in lives and manners, each of which is limited by divinity to a certain time of duration, and the number of years of which this time consists is bounded by the period of the great year.

They say there was then a conjunction of the planets, and their tables show that conjunction. Monsieur Bailly observes *, that by calculation it appears, \"II- Traite de l' Astronornie Indienne et Orientale, par Monsieur Bailly, published in 1787.

These four planets, therefore, showed themselves in conjunction; and though Venus could not have appeared, yet, as they only speak in general terms, it was natural enough to say there was then a conjunction of the planets. The account given by the Brahmans is confirmed by the testimony of our European tables, which prove it to be the result of a true observation. Monsieur Bailly is of opinion, that their astronomical time is dated from an eclipse of the moon, which appears then to have happened, and that the conjunction of the planets is only mentioned by the way.\"-pp. 224,225. The conjunction of the planets. mentioned in the above extract, is admirably elucidated by Olympiodorus in his MS. Scholia on the Gorgias of Plato, as follows: \"There are seven spheres, that of the moon, that of the sun, and those of the other planets; but the inerratic is the eighth sphere. The lunar sphere, therefore, makes a complete revolution more swiftly, for it is accomplished in thirty days. That of the sun is more slow, for it is accomplished in a year. That of Jupiter is still slower, for it is effected in twelve years. And much more that of Saturn, for it is completed in thirty years. The stars, therefore, are not conjoined with each other in their revolutions, except rarely. Thus, for instance, the sphere of Saturn and the sphere of Jupiter are conjoined with each other in their revolutions in sixty years. For if the sphere of Jupiter comes from the same to the same in twelve years, but that of Saturn in"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"83 thirty years, it is evident that when Jupiter has made five, Saturn will have made two revolutions; for twice thirty is sixty, and so likewise is twelve times five; so that their revolutions will be conjoined in sixty years.

But the seven plane- tary spheres conjoin their revolutions with the inerratic sphere, through man:; ~yriads if years; and this is the period which Plato calls TOY aet xpOYOY, for ever.-See the Introduction to the volume of my Aristotle, which contains a translation of Aristotle's treatise on the Soul, &c. &c.

Every natural body is moved according to one of these motions. Every natural body is either simple or com- pounded.

Things naturally moved in a circle, are neither the same with those moved in a right line, nor with those which are composed from things moved in a right line. Demonstration.-Let AB be that which is natu- rally moved in a circle. I say that it is not the same with those things which are moved in a right line. For, if it is the same with anyone of these, it must either be naturally moved upwards or downwards. But every simple body is moved with one simple motion according to nature. Hence, that which is naturally moved in a circle, is not the same with anything moved in a right line. But neither is it the same with anything compounded. For it has been shown that everything which na- turally moves in a circle is simple; but that which consists from things moved in a right line is a com- posite. AB therefore, which is naturally moved in a circle, is neither the same with things moved in a right line, nor with those composed from these. THEOREM 3. Things which are naturally moved in a circle, neither participate of gravity nor levity. .Demonstration.-For if AB is either heavy or light, it is either naturally moved to the middle, or"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"88 from the middle: for, from the definitions, that is heavy which is moved to the middle, and that is light which is moved from the middle. But that which is moved either from or to the middle, is the same with some one of the things moved in a right line. AB, therefore, is the same with some- thing moved in a right line, though naturally moved in a circle, which is impossible. THEOREM 4. Nothing is contrary to a circular motion. Demonstration.-For if this be possible, let the motion from A to B be a circular motion, and let the motion contrary to this be either some one of the motions in a right line, or some one of those in a circle. If, then, the motion upwards is con- trary to that in a circle, the motion downwards and that in a circle will be one. But if the motion downwards is contrary to that in a circle, the mo- tion upwards and that in a circle will be the same with each other; for one motion is contrary to one into opposite places. But if the motion from A is contrary to the motion from B, there will be infi- nite spaces between two contraries; for between the points A, B infinite circumferences may be de- scribed. But let AB be a semicircle, and let the motion from A to B be contrary to the motion from B to A. If, therefore, that which moves in the"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"89 semicircle from A to B stops at B, it is by no means a motion in a circle: for a circular motion is continually from the same to the same point. But, if it does not stop at B, but continually moves in the other semicircle, A is not contrary to B. And if this be the case, neither is the motion from A to B contrary to the motion from B to A: for contrary motions are from contraries to contraries. But let ABCD be a circle, and let the motion from A to C be contrary to the motion from C to A. If therefore that which is moved from A passes through all the places similarly, and there is one motion from A to D, C is not contrary to A. But if these are not contrary, neither are the motions from them contrary. And in a similar manner with respect to that which is moved from C, if it is moved with one motion to B, A is not con trary to C, so that neither will the motions from these be contrary. THEOREM 5. Things which are naturally moved in a circle, neither receive generation nor corruption. Demonstration.-For let AB be that which is naturally moved in a circle, I say that AB is with- out generation and corruption: for if it is gene- rable and corruptible, it is generated from a con- trary, and is corrupted into a contrary. But that"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"90 which is moved in a circle has not any contrary. It is therefore without generation and corruption. But that there is nothing contrary to things natu .. rally moving in a circle, is evident from what has been previously demonstrated: for the motions of things contrary according to nature are contrary. But, as we have demonstrated, there is nothin.g contrary to the motion in a circle. Neither, there- fore, has that which is moved in a circle any contrary. THEOREM 6. The powers of bodies terminated according to magnitude are not infinite. Demonstration.-For, if possible, let B be the infinite power of the finite body A; and let the half of A be taken, which let be C, and let the power of this be D. But it is necessary that the power D should be less than the power B: for a part has a power less than that of the whole. Let the ratio, therefore, of C to A be taken, and D will measure B. The power B therefore is finite, and it is as C to A, so D to B; and alternately as C to D, so A to B. But the power D is the power of the magnitude C, and therefore B will be the power of the magnitude A. The magnitude A, therefore, has a finite power B; but it was infinite, which is impossible: for, that a power of the same"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"91 species should be both finite and infinite in the same thing, is impossible. THEOREM; 7. Simple bodies are terminated according to spe- cies, Demonstration.-For let the magnitude A be a simple body. Since, therefore, a simple body is moved with a simple motion, A will be moved with a simple motion. And if it is moved in a circle, it will have one nature and one form. But if it is moved according to anyone of the motions in a right line, if it is moved from the middle only, it will be fire, but if only to the middle, earth. But, if it is light with respect to one thing, and heavy with respect to another, it will be some one of the middle elements. The species therefore of simple bodies are terminated. THEORBM 8. Time is continued and perpetual. Demonstration.-For, if it is neither continued nor eternal, it will have a certain beginning. Let, therefore, A B be time, and let its beginning be A. But if A is time, it is divisible, and we shall not yet have the beginning of time, but there will be another beginning of the beginning, But, if A is"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"92 'a moment or the no», it will be indivisible, and the boundary of another time: for the n,o'W is not only a beginning, but an end. There will there- fore be time before A. Again: if B is the boun- dary of time, if B is time, it may be divided to infinity, and into the many boundaries which it contains. But if B is the now, the same will also be a beginning: for the no» is not only a boundary, but a beginning *\". THEOREM 9. A motion which is naturally circular is perpetual. Demonstration.-Let the circular motion be that of the circle A B, I say that it is perpetual: for, since time is perpetual, it is also necessary that motion should be perpetual. And since time is continued, (for there is the same no» in the past and present time,) it is necessary that there should be some one continued motion: for time is the number of motion. However, all other motions are not perpetual: for they are generated from contraries into contraries. A circular motion, therefore, is alone perpetual: for to this, as we have demonstrated, nothing is contrary. But that all the motions which subsist between contraries, are ;Ii Hence the world is perpetual; for it is consubsistent with time."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"93 bounded, and are not perpetual, we thus demon- strate. Let A B be a motion between the two contraries A and B. The motion, therefore, of A B is bounded by A and B, and is not infinite. But the motion from A is not continued with that from B. But, when that which is moved returns, it will stand still in B: for, if the motion from A is one continued motion, and also that from B, that which is moved from B will be moved into the same. It will therefore be moved in vain, being now in A. But nature does nothing in vain: and hence, there is not one motion. The motions, therefore, between contraries are not perpetual. Nor is it possible for a thing to be moved to in- finity in a right line: for contraries are the boun- daries. Nor when it returns will it make one motion. THEOREM 10. That which moves a perpetual motion IS per- petual. Demonstration.-For let A be that which moves a perpetual motion. I say that A also is perpe- tual: for, if it is not, it will not then move when it is not. But this not moving, neither does the motion subsist, which it moved before. It is how- ever supposed to be perpetual. But, nothing else moving, that will be immoveable which is perpe-"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"94 tually moved. And if anything else moves when A is Ito more, the motion is not continual ; which is impossible. Hence, that which moves a perpe- tual motion is itself perpetual. THEOREM II. That which is immoveable is the leader of things moving and moved. Demonetration--s-Yor let A be moved by B, and B by C, I say that this will some time or other stop, and that not everything which moves will be itself moved: for, if possible, let this take place. Motions, therefore, are either in a circle, or ad iWinitum. But, if things moving and moved are infinite, there will be infinite multitude and mag- nitude: for everything which is moved is divisible, and moves from contact. Hence, that which con- sists from things moving and moved infinite in multitude, will be infinite in magnitude. But it is impossible that any body, whether composite or simple, can be infinite. But if motions are in a circle, some one of things moved at a certain thne, will be the cause of perpetual motion, if all things move and are moved by each other in a circle. This, however, is impossible: for that which moves a perpetual motion is perpetual. Neither, there ... fore, is the motion of things moved, in a circle, nor"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"95 ad ir!finitiun. There is, therefore, that which moves immoveably, and which is perpetual. But from hence it is evident, that all things are not moved; for there is also something which IS immoveable. Nor are all things at rest; fur there are also things which ate moved. Nor are some things always at rest; but others always moved; for there are also things which are sometimes at rest, and sometimes moved, such as are things which are moved from contraries into contraries. Nor are all things sometimes at rest, and some- times moved; 'for there is that which is perpetu- ally moved, and also that which is perpetually im- moveable. THEOREM 12. Everything which is moved, is moved by some- thing. Demonstration.-Let A be that which is moved, I say that A is moved by something: for it is either moved according or contrary to nature. If, there- fore, it is moved according to nature, that which moves is nature; but, if contrary to nature, that which employs violence moves; for every motion contrary to nature is violent. THEOREM 13. That which first moves a circular motion is im- partible, or without parts."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"96 Demonstration--« For let A be that which moves the first motion: for it is necessary that there should be- something of this kind, because eyery- thing which is moved is moved by something. But A, if it is that which first moves, will be im- moveable: for that which is immoveable is the leader of all things which are moved. And, since it moves a perpetual motion, it will possess an infinite power of moving; for finite powers have also finite energies: for energy proceeds from power. So that if its energy is infinite, its power also will be infinite. Hence, that which first moves a circular motion, must necessarily either be body, or incorporeal. But if body, it is either finite or infinite. There is not however an infinite body. And if it is a finite body, it will not pos- sess an infinite power. But the powers of things bounded according to magnitude are finite, as has been demonstrated. Hence, that which first moves a circular motion, is not a boclv. It is therefore \" incorporeal, and possesses infinite power. THE END.
