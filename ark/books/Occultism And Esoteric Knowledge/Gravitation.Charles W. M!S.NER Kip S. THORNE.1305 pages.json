It supplies two tracks through the subject. The first track is focused on the key physical ideas. It assumes, as mathematical prerequisite, only vector analysis and simple partial-differential equations. It is suitable for a one-semester course at the junior or senior level or in graduate school; and it constitutes-in the opinion of the authors-the indispensable core of gravitation theory that every advanced student of physics should learn. The Track-l material is contained in those pages of the book that have a 1 outlined in gray in the upper outside corner, by which the eye of the reader can quickly pick out the Track-l sections. In the con- tents, the same purpose is served by a gray bar beside the section, box, or figure number. The rest of the text builds up Track 1 into Track 2. Readers and teachers are invited to select, as enrichment material, those portions of Track 2 that interest them most. With a few exceptions, any Track-2 chapter can be understood by readers who have studied only the earlier Track-l material. The exceptions are spelled out explicitly in \"dependency statements\" located at the beginning of each Track-2 chapter, or at each transition within a chapter from Track 1 to Track 2. The entire book (all of Track 1 plus all of Track 2) is designed for a rigorous, full-year course at the graduate level, though many teachers of a full-year course may prefer a more leisurely pace that omits some of the Track-2 material. The full book is intended to give a competence in gravitation physics comparable to that which the average Ph.D. has in electromagnetism. When the student achieves this competence, he knows the laws of physics in flat spacetime (Chapters 1-7). He can predict orders of magnitude. He can also calculate using the principal tools of modern differential geometry (Chapters 8-15), and he can predict at all relevant levels of precision. He understands Einstein's geometric framework for physics (Chapters"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"VIII GRAVITATION 16-22). He knows the applications of greatest present-day interest: pulsars and neutron stars (Chapters 23-26); cosmology (Chapters 27-30); the Schwarzschild geometry and gravitational collapse (Chapters 31-34); and gravitational waves (Chapters 35-37). He has probed the experimental tests of Einstein's theory (Chap- ters 38-40). He will be able to read the modern mathematical literature on differential geometry, and also the latest papers in the physics and astrophysics journals about geometrodynamics and its applications. Ifhe wishes to go beyond the field equations, the four major applications, and the tests, he will find at the end of the book (Chapters 41-44) a brief survey of several advanced topics in general relativity. Among the topics touched on here, superspace and quantum geometrodynamics receive special attention. These chapters identify some of the outstanding physical issues and lines of investigation being pursued today. Whether the department is physics or astrophysics or mathematics, more students than ever ask for more about general relativity than mere conversation. They want to hear its principal theses clearly stated. They want to know how to \"work the handles of its information pump\" themselves. More universities than ever respond with a serious course in Einstein's standard 1915 geometrodynamics. What a contrast to Maxwell's standard 1864 electrodynamics! In 1897, when Einstein was a student at Zurich, this subject was not on the instructional calendar of even half the universities of Europe. 1 \"We waited in vain for an exposition of Maxwell's theory,\" says one of Einstein's classmates. \"Above all it was Einstein who was disappointed,\" 2 for he rated electrodynamics as \"the most fascinating subject at the time\" 3_ as many students rate Einstein's theory today! Maxwell's theory recalls Einstein's theory in the time it took to win acceptance. Even as.late as 1904 a book could appear by so great an investigator as William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, with the words, \"The so-called 'electromagnetic theory of light' has not helped us hitherto ... it seems to me that it is rather a backward step ... the one thing about it that seems intelligible to me, I do not think is admissible ... that there should be an electric displacement perpendicular to the line of propagation.\" 4 Did the pioneer of the Atlantic cable in the end contribute so richly to Maxwell electrodynamics-from units, and principles of measurement, to the theory of waves guided by wires-because of his own early difficulties with the subject? Then there is hope for many who study Einstein's geometrodynamics today! By the 1920's the weight of developments, from Kelvin's cable to Marconi's wireless, from the atom of Rutherford and Bohr to the new technology of high- frequency circuits, had produced general conviction that Maxwell was right. Doubt dwindled. Confidence led to applications, and applications led to confidence. Many were slow to take up general relativity in the beginning because it seemed to be poor in applications. Einstein's theory attracts the interest of many today because it is rich in applications. No longer is attention confined to three famous but meager tests: the gravitational red shift, the bending of light by the sun, and 1 G. Holton (1965). 3 A. Einstein (l949a). 2L. Kolbros (1956). 4W.

The combination of radar ranging and general relativity is, step by step, transforming the solar-system celestial mechanics of an older generation to a new subject, with a new level of precision, new kinds of effects, and a new outlook. Pulsars, discovered in 1968, find no acceptable explanation except as the neutron stars predicted in 1934, objects with a central density so high (~1014g/ cm 3 ) that the Einstein predictions of mass differ from the Newtonian predictions by 10 to 100 per cent. About further density increase and a final continued gravitational collapse, Newtonian theory is silent. In contrast, Einstein's standard 1915 geometrodynamics predicted in 1939 the properties of a completely collapsed object, a \"frozen star\" or \"black hole.\" By 1966 detailed digital calculations were available describing the formation of such an object in the collapse of a star with a white-dwarf core. Today hope to discover the first black hole is not least among the forces propelling more than one research: How does rotation influence the properties of a black hole? What kind of pulse of gravitational radiation comes off when such an object is formed? What spectrum of x-rays emerges when gas from a companion star piles up on its way into a black hole? 5 All such investi- gations and more base themselves on Schwarzschild's standard 1916 static and spherically symmetric solution of Einstein's field equations, first really understood in the modern sense in 1960, and in 1963 generalized to a black hole endowed with angular momentum. Beyond solar-system tests and applications of relativity, beyond pulsars, neutron stars, and black holes, beyond geometrostatics (compare electrostatics!) and station- ary geometries (compare the magnetic field set up by a steady current!) lies geo- metro dynamics in the full sense of the word (compare electrodynamics!). Nowhere does Einstein's great conception stand out more clearly than here, that the geometry of space is a new physical entity, with degrees of freedom and a dynamics of its own. Deformations in the geometry of space, he predicted in 1918, can transport energy from place to place. Today, thanks to the initiative of Joseph Weber, detectors of such gravitational radiation have been constructed and exploited to give upper limits to the flux of energy streaming past the earth at selected frequencies. Never before has one realized from how many kinds of processes significant gravitational radiation can be anticipated. Never before has there been more interest in picking up this new kind of signal and using it to diagnose faraway events. Never before has there been such a drive in more than one laboratory to raise instrumental sensitivity until gravitational radiation becomes a workaday new window on the universe. The expansion of the universe is the greatest of all tests of Einstein's geometro- dynamics, and cosmology the greatest of all applications. Making a prediction too fantastic for its author to credit, the theory forecast the expansion years before it was observed (1929). Violating the short time-scale that Hubble gave for the expan- sion, and in the face of \"theories\" (\"steady state\"; \"continuous creation\") manufac- tured to welcome and utilize this short time-scale, standard general relativity resolutely persisted in the prediction of a long time-scale, decades before the astro- 5 As of April 1973, there are significant indications that Cygnus X-I and other compact x-ray sources may be black holes."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"x GRAVITATION physical discovery (1952) that the Hubble scale of distances and times was wrong, and had to be stretched by a factor of more than five. Disagreeing by a factor of the order of thirty with the average density of mass-energy in the universe deduced from astrophysical evidence as recently as 1958, Einstein's theory now as in the past argues for the higher density, proclaims \"the mystery of the missing matter,\" and encourages astrophysics in a continuing search that year by year turns up new indications of matter in the space between the galaxies. General relativity forecast the primordial cosmic fireball radiation, and even an approximate value for its present temperature, seventeen years before the radiation was discovered. This radiation brings information about the universe when it had a thousand times smaller linear dimensions, and a billion times smaller volume, than it does today. Quasistellar objects, discovered in 1963, supply more detailed information from a more recent era, when the universe had a quarter to half its present linear dimensions. Telling about a stage in the evolution of galaxies and the universe reachable in no other way, these objects are more than beacons to light up the far away and long ago. They put out energy at a rate unparalleled anywhere else in the universe. They eject matter with a surprising directivity. They show a puzzling variation with time, different between the microwave and the visible part of the spectrum. Quasistellar objects on a great scale, and galactic nuclei nearer at hand on a smaller scale, voice a challenge to general relativity: help clear up these mysteries! If its wealth of applications attracts many young astrophysicists to the study of Einstein's geometrodynamics, the same attraction draws those in the world of physics who are concerned with physical cosmology, experimental general relativity, gravi- tational radiation, and the properties of objects made out of superdense matter. Of quite another motive for study of the subject, to contemplate Einstein's inspiring vision of geometry as the machinery of physics, we shall say nothing here because it speaks out, we hope, in every chapter of this book. Why a new book? The new applications of general relativity, with their extraor- dinary physical interest, outdate excellent textbooks of an earlier era, among them even that great treatise on the subject written by Wolfgang Pauli at the age of twenty-one. In addition, differential geometry has undergone a transformation of outlook that isolates the student who is confined in his training to the traditional tensor calculus of the earlier texts. For him it is difficult or impossible either to read the writings of his up-to-date mathematical colleague or to explain the mathematical content of his physical problem to that friendly source of help. We have not seen any way to meet our responsibilities to our students at our three institutions except by a new exposition, aimed at establishing a solid competence in the subject, con- temporary in its mathematics, oriented to the physical and astrophysical applications of greatest present-day interest, and animated by belief in the beauty and simplicity of nature.

A colleague gives us a special lecture so that we may adapt it into one of the chapters of this book. Another investigator clears up for us the tangled history of the production of matter out of the vacuum by strong tidal gravitational forces. A distant colleague telephones in references on the absence of any change in physical constants with time. One student provides a problem on the energy density of a null electromagnetic field. Another supplies curves for effective potential as a function of distance. A librarian writes abroad to get us an article in an obscure publication. A secretary who cares types the third revision of a chapter. Editor and illustrator imaginatively solve a puzzling problem of presentation. Repeat in imagination such instances of warm helpfulness and happy good colleagueship times beyond count. Then one has some impression of the immense debt we owe to over a hundred-fifty colleagues. Each face is etched in our mind, and to each our gratitude is heartfelt.

THE PARABLE OF THE APPLE One day in the year 1666 Newton had gone to the country, and seeing the fall of an apple, as his niece told me, let himself be led into a deep meditation on the cause which thus draws every object along a line whose extension would pass almost through the center of the Earth. VOLTAIRE (1738) Once upon a time a student lay in a garden under an apple tree reflecting on the difference between Einstein's and Newton's views about gravity. He was startled by the fall of an apple neiirby. As he looked at the apple, he noticed ants beginning to run along its surface (Figure l.l). His curiosity aroused, he thought to investigate the principles of navigation followed by an ant. With his magnifying glass, he noted one track carefully, and, taking his knife, made a cut in the apple skin one mm above the track and another cut one mm below it. He peeled off the resulting little highway of skin and laid it out on the face of his book. The track ran as straight as a laser beam along this highway. No more economical path could the ant have found to cover the ten cm from start to end of that strip of skin. Any zigs and zags or even any smooth bend in the path on its way along the apple peel from starting point to end point would have increased its length. \"What a beautiful geodesic.\" the student commented. His eye fell on two ants starting off from a common point P in slightly different directions. Their routes happened to carry them through the region of the dimple at the top of the apple. one on each side of it. Each ant conscientiously pursued"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"4 --- 1. GEOMETRODYNAMICS IN BRIEF Einstein's local view of physics contrasted with Newton's \"action at a distance\" Physics is simple only when analyzed locally Figure 1.1. The Riemannian geometry of the spacetime of general relativity is here symbolized by the two-dimen- sional geometry of the surface of an apple. The geodesic tracks followed by the ants on the apple's surface symbolize the world line followed through spacetime by a free particle. In any sufficiently localized region of spacetime, the geometry can be idealized as flat, as symbolized on the apple's two-dimensional surface' by the straight-line course of the tracks viewed in the magnifying glass (\"local Lorentz character\" of geometry of spacetime). In a region of greater extension, the curvature of the manifold (four-dimen- sional spacetime in the case of the real physical world; curved two-dimensional geometry in the case of the apple) makes itself felt. Two tracks (J and (fl, originally diverging from a commOn point <1', later approach, cross, and go off in very different directions. In Newtonian theory this effect is ascribed to gravitation acting at a distance from a center of attraction, symbolized here by the stem of the apple. According to Einstein a particle gets its moving orders locally, from the geometry of spacetime right where it is. Its instructions are simple: to follow the straightest possible track (geodesic). Physics is as simple as it could be locally. Only because spacetime is curved in the large do the tracks cross. Geome- trodynamics, in brief, is a double story of the effect of geometry on matter (causing originally divergent geodesics to cross) and the effect of matter on geometry (bending of spacetime initiated by concentration of mass, symbolized by effect of stem on nearby surface of apple). his geodesic. Each went as straight on his strip of appleskin as he possibly could. Yet because of the curvature of the dimple itself, the two tracks not only crossed but emerged in very different directions. \"What happier illustration of Einstein's geometric theory of gravity could one possibly ask?\" murmured the student. \"The ants move as if they were attracted by the apple stem. One might have believed in a Newtonian force at a distance. Yet from nowhere does an ant get his moving orders except from the local geometry along his track. This is surely Einstein's concept that all physics takes place by 'local action.' What a difference from Newton's 'action at a distance' view of physics! Now I understand better what this book means.\" And so saying, he opened his book and read, \"Don't try to describe motion relative to faraway objects. Physics is simple only when analyzed locally. And locally"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"§1.2. SPACETIME WITH AND WITHOUT COORDINATES 5 the world line that a satellite follows [in spacetime, around the Earth) is already as straight as any world line can be. Forget all this talk about 'deflection' and 'force of gravitation.' I'm inside a spaceship. Or I'm floating outside and near it. Do I feel any 'force of gravitation'? Not at all. Does the spaceship 'feel' such a force? No. Then why talk about it? Recognize that the spaceship and I traverse a region of spacetime free of all force. Acknowledge that the motion through that region is already ideally straight.\" The dinner bell was ringing, but still the student sat, musing to himself. \"Let me see if I can summarize Einstein's geometric theory of gravity in three ideas: (I) locally, geodesics appear straight: (2) over more extended regions of space and time, geodesics originally receding from each other begin to approach at a rate governed by the curvature of spacetime, and this effect of geometry on matter is what we mean today by that old word 'gravitation': (3) matter in turn warps geometry. The dimple arises in the apple because the stem is there. I think I see how to put the whole story even more briefly: Space acts on matter, telling it how to move. In turn, matter reacts back on space, telling it how to curve. In other words, matter here,\" he said, rising and picking up the apple by its stem, \"curves space here. To produce a curvature in space here is to force a curvature in space there,\" he went on, as he watched a lingering ant busily following its geodesic a finger's breadth away from the apple's stem. \"Thus matter here influences matter there. That is Einstein's explana tion for 'gra vi ta tion.''' Then the dinner bell was quiet. and he was gone, with book, magnifying glass-and apple. §1.2. SPACETIME WITH AND WITHOUT COORDINATES Now it came to me: ... the independence of the gravitational acceleration from the nature of the falling substance, may be expressed as follows: In a gravitational field (of small spatial extension) things behave as they do in a space free of gravitation . ... This happened in 1908. Why were another seven years required for the construction of the general theory of relativity? The main reason lies in the fact that it is not so easy to free oneself from the idea that coordinates must have an immediate metrical meaning. ALBERT EINSTEIN [in Schilpp (1949), pp. 65-67.] Nothing is more distressing on first contact with the idea of \"curved spacetime\" than the fear that every simple means of measurement has lost its power in this unfamiliar context. One thinks of oneself as confronted with the task of measuring the shape of a gigantic and fantastically sculptured iceberg as one stands \\vith a meter stick in a tossing rowboat on the surface of a hea\\'ing ocean. Were it the rowboat itself whose shape were to be measured. the procedure would be simple enough. One would draw it up on shore. turn it upside down. and drive tacks in lightly at strategic points here and there on the surface.

Typical events symbolized in the diagram, from left to right (black dots). are: absorption of a photon; reemission of a photon; collision between a particle and a particle: collision between a photon and a particle; another collision between a photon and a particle; explosion of a firecracker; and collision of a particle from outside with one of the fragments of that firecracker. Resolution: characterize events by what happens there tack would record and reveal the shape of the surface. The precision could be made arbitrarily great by making the number of tacks arbitrarily large. It takes more daring to think of driving several score pitons into the towering iceberg. But with all the daring in the world, how is one to drive a nail into spacetime to mark a point? Happily, nature provides its own way to localize a point in spacetime, as Einstein was the first to emphasize. Characterize the point by what happens there! Give a point in spacetime the name \"event.\" Where the event lies is defined as clearly and sharply as where two straws cross each other in a barn full of hay (Figure 1.2). To say that the event marks a collision of such and such a photon with such and such a particle is identification enough. The world lines of that photon and that particle are rooted in the past and stretch out into the future. They have a rich texture of #' connections with nearby world lines.

That most streets in Japan have no names, and most houses no numbers, illustrates one's ability to do without coordinates. One can abandon the names of two world lines as a means to identify the event where they intersect. Just as one could name a Japanese house after its senior occupant, so one can and often does attach arbitrary names to specific events in spacetime. as in Box 1.1. Coordinates. however, are convenient. How else from the great thick catalog of events, randomly listed, can one easily discover that along a certain world line one will first encounter event Trinity. then Baker, then Mike, then Argus-but not the same events in some permuted order? To order events, introduce coordinates! (See Figure 1.3.) Coordinates are four indexed numbers per event in spacetime; on a sheet of paper, only two. Trinity acquires coordinates In christening events with coordinates, one demands smoothness but foregoes every thought of mensuration. The four numbers for an eventare nothing but an elaborate kind of telephone number. Compare their \"telephone\" numbers to discover whether two events are neighbors. But do not expect to learn how many meters separate them from the difference in their telephone numbers! Nothing prevents a subscriber from being served by competing telephone systems, nor an event from being catalogued by alternative coordinate systems (Figure 1.3). Box 1.1 illustrates the relationships between one coordinate system and another, as well as the notation used to denote coordinates and their transforma tions. Choose two events, known to be neighbors by the nearness of their coordinate values in a smooth coordinate system. Draw a little arrow from one~,,:ent to the other. Such an arrow is called a vector. (It is a well-defined concept in fiilt spacetime, or in curved spacetime in the limit of vanishingly small length; for finite lengths in curved spacetime, it must be refined and made precise, under the new name \"tangent vector,\" on which see Chapter 9.) This vector, like events, can be given a name. But whether named \"John\" or \"Charles\" or \"Kip,\" it is a unique, well- defined geometrical object. The name is a convenience, but the vector exists even without it. Just as a quadruple of coordinates is a particularly useful name for the event \"Trinity\" (it can be used to identify what other events are nearby), so a quadruple of \"components\""},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Box 1.1 MATHEMATICAL NOTATION FOR EVENTS, COORDINATES, AND VECTORS Events are denoted by capital script, one-letter Latin names such as Sometimes subscripts are used: Coordinates of an event ~1' are denoted by or by or more abstractly by where it is understood that Greek indices can take on any value 0, 1, 2. or 3.

How to work with the components of a vector is explored in Box 1.1. There are many ways in which a coordinate system can be imperfect. Figure 1.4 illustrates a coordinate singularity. For another example of a coordinate singularity, run the eye over the surface of a globe to the North Pole. Note the many meridians that meet there (\"coIlapse of ceIls of egg crates to zero content\"). Can't one do better? Find a single coordinate system that will cover the globe without singularity? A theorem says no. Two is the minimum number of \"coordinate patches\" required to cover the two-sphere without singularity (Figure 1.5). This circumstance empha- sizes anew that points and events are primary, whereas coordinates are a mere bookkeeping device. Figures 1.2 and 1.3 show only a few world lines and events. A more detailed diagram would show a maze of world lines and of light rays and the intersections between them. From such a picture, one can in imagination step to the idealized limit: an infinitely dense coIlection of light rays and of world lines of infinitesimal test particles. With this idealized physical limit, the mathematical concept of a continuous four-dimensional \"manifold\" (four-dimensional space with certain smoothness properties) has a one-to-one correspondence; and in this limit continu- ous, differentiable (i.e., smooth) coordinate systems operate. The mathematics then supplies a tool to reason about the physics. A simple countdown reveals the dimensionality of the manifold. Take a point ,:,7' in an n-dimensional manifold. Its neighborhood is an n-dimensional ball (i.e., the interior of a sphere whose surface has n - I dimensions). Choose this ball so that its boundary is a smooth manifold. The dimensionality of this manifold is (n - 1). In this (n - 1 )-dimensional manifold, pick a point 2. Its neighborhood is an (n - I)-dimensional ball. Choose this baIl so that ... , and so on. Eventually one comes by this construction to a manifold that is two-dimensional but is not yet known to be two-dimensional (two-sphere). In this two-dimensional manifold, pick a point '3ll. Its neighborhood is a two-dimensional baIl (\"disc\"). Choose this disc so that its boundary is a smooth manifold (circle). In this manifold, pick a point 9l. Its neighborhood is a one-dimensional ball, but is not yet known to be one-dimensional (\"line segment\"). The boundaries of this object are two points. This circumstance tells that the intervening manifold is one-dimensional; therefore the previous mani- fold was two-dimensional; and so on. The dimensionality of the original manifold is equal to the number of points employed in the construction. For spacetime, the dimensionality is 4. This kind of mathematical reasoning about dimensionality makes good sense at the everyday scale of distances, at atomic distances (10- 8 cm), at nuclear dimensions (10- 13 cm), and even at lengths smaller by several powers of ten, if one judges by the concord between prediction and observation in quantum electrodynamics at high"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"r::: 111 2.8m 3.0m 2.6m --r-----1r----t---t----+------- t = _ m r = 2.2m 2.4m r = 1.8m (t/2m) = ran(i/2m).

Moreover, classical general relativity thinks of the spacetime manifold as a deterministic structure, completely well-defined down to arbitrarily small distances. Not so quantum general relativity or \"quantum geometrodynamics.\" It predicts violent fluctuations in the geometry at distances on the order of the Planck length, L * = (fiG j C 3 )1/2 = [(1.054 X 10- 27 g cm 2 jsec)(6.670 X 10- 8 cm 3 jg sec 2 )j1/2 X X (2.998 X 10 10 cmjsect 3 / 2 (1.1) = 1.616 X 10- 33 em.

This lack of smoothness may well deprive even the concept of dimension- ality itself of any meaning at the Planck scale of distances. The further exploration of this issue takes one to the frontiers of Einstein's theory (Chapter 44).

WEIGHTLESSNESS 13 idealization and the physical reality? The infinitely dense collection of light rays and of world lines of infinitesimal test particles that are to define all the points of the manifold: they surely are beyond practical realization. Nobody has ever found a particle that moves on timelike world lines (finite rest mass) lighter than an electron. A collection of electrons, even if endowed with zero density of charge (e+ and e- world lines present in equal numbers) will have a density of mass. This density will curve the very manifold under study. Investigation in infinite detail means unlimited density, and unlimited disturbance of the geometry. However, to demand investigatability in infinite detail in the sense just described is as out of place in general relativity as it would be in electrodynamics or gas dynamics. Electrodynamics speaks of the strength of the electric and magnetic field at each point in space and at each moment of time. To measure those fields, it is willing to contemplate infinitesimal test particles scattered everywhere as densely as one pleases. However, the test particles do not have to be there at all to give the field reality. The field has everywhere a clear-cut value and goes about its deterministic dynamic evolution willy-nilly and continuously, infinitesimal test particles or no infinitesimal test particles. Similarly with the geometry of space. In conclusion, when one deals with spacetime in the context of classical physics, one accepts (I) the notion of \"infinitesimal test particle\" and (2) the idealization that the totality of identifiable events forms a four-dimensional continuous manifold. Only at the end of this book will a look be taken at some of the limitations placed by the quantum principle on one's way of speaking about and analyzing spacetime. §1.3. WEIGHTLESSNESS \"Gravity is a great mystery. Drop a stone. See it fall. Hear it hit. No one understands why.\" What a misleading statement! Mystery about fall? What else should the stone do except fall? To fall is normal. The abnormality is an object standing in the way of the stone. If one wishes to pursue a \"mystery,\" do not follow the track of the falling stone. Look instead at the impact, and ask what was the force that pushed the stone away from its natural \"world line,\" (Le., its natural track through space- time). That could lead to an interesting issue of solid-state physics, but that is not the topic of concern here. Fall is. Free fall is synonymous with weightlessness: absence of any force to drive the object away from its normal track through space- time. Travel aboard a freely falling elevator to experience weightlessness. Or travel aboard a spaceship also falling straight toward the Earth. Or, more happily, travel aboard a spaceship in that state of steady fall toward the Earth that marks a circular orbit. In each case one is following a natural track through spacetime. The traveler has one chemical composition, the spaceship another; yet they travel together, the traveler weightless in his moving home. Objects of such different nuclear constitution as aluminum and gold fall with accelerations that agree to better than one part in lOll, according to Roll, Krotkov, and Dicke (1964), one of the most important null experiments in all physics (see Figure 1.6).

Unhappily. any substamial mass nearby, such as an experimenter, located at M. will produce a torque that swamps the effect sought. Therefore the actual arrangement was as shown in the body of the figure. One gold weight and two aluminum weights were supported at the three corners of a horizontal equilateral triangle. 6 cm on a side (three-fold axis of symmetry. giving zero response to all the simplest nonuniformities in the gravitational field).

Krotkov, and Dicke reflected a very weak light beam from the optically flat back face of the quartz triangle. The image of the source slit fell on a wire of about the same size as the slit image. The light transmitted past the wire fell on a photomultiplier. A separate oscillator circuit drove the wire back and forth across the image at 3,000 hertz. When the image was centered perfectly, only even harmonics of the oscillation frequency appeared in the light intensity. However, when the image was displaced slightly to one side. the fundamental frequency appeared in the light intensity. The electrical output of the photomultiplier then contained a 3,OOO-hertz component. The magnitude and sign of this component were determined automatically. Equally automatically a proportional D.C. voltage was applied to the electrodes shown in the diagram. It restored the torsion balance to its zero position. The D.C. voltage required to restore the balance to its zero position was recorded as a measure of the torque acting on the pendulum. This torque was Fourier-analyzed over a period of many days.

Contemplate the interior ofa spaceship, and a key, penny, nut, and pea by accident or design set free inside. Shielded from all view of the world outside by the walls of the vessel, each object stays at rest relative to the vessel. Or it moves through the room in a straight line with uniform velocity. That is the lesson which experience shouts out. Forego talk of acceleration! That, paradoxically, is the lesson of the circumstance that \"all objects fall with the same acceleration.\" Whose fault were those accelera- tions, after all? They came from allowing a ground based observer into the act. The Box 1.2 MATERIALS OF THE MOST DIVERSE COMPOSITION FALL WITH THE SAME ACCELERATION (\"STANDARD WORLD LINE\") Aristotle: \"the downward movement of a mass of gold or lead, or of any other body endowed with weight, is quicker in proportion to its size.\" Pre-Galilean literature: metal and wood weights fall at the same rate. Galileo: (I) \"the variation of speed in air between balls of gold, lead, copper, porphyry, and other heavy materials is so slight that in a fall of 100 cubits [about 46 meters] a ball of gold would surely not outstrip one of copper by as much as four fingers. Having observed this, I came to the con- clusion that in a medium totally void of resistance all bodies would fall with the same speed.\" (2) later experiments of greater precision \"diluting gravity\" and finding same time of descent for different objects along an inclined plane. Newton: inclined plane replaced by arc of pendu- lum bob; \"time of fall\" for bodies of different composition determined by comparing time of oscillation of pendulum bobs of the two materials. Ultimate limit of precision in such experiments limited by problem of determining effective length of each pendulum: (acceleration) = (2'7T/pe- riod)2(length). Lorand von Eotvos, Budapest, 1889 and 1922: compared on the rotating earth the vertical defined by a plumb bob of one material with the vertical defined by a plumb bob of other material. The two hanging masses, by the two unbroken threads that support them, were drawn along identical world lines through spacetime (middle of the labo- ratory of Eotvos!). If cut free, would they also follow identical tracks through spacetime (\"normal world line of test mass\")? If so, the acceleration that draws the actual world line from the normal free-fall world line will have a standard value, a. The experiment of Eotvos did not try to test agree- ment on the magnitude of a between the two masses. Doing so would have required (1) cutting the threads and (2) following the fall of the two masses. Eotvos renounced this approach in favor of a static observation that he could make with greater precision, comparing the direction of a for the two masses. The direction of the supporting thread, so his argument ran, reveals the direction in which the mass is being dragged away from its normal world line of \"free fall\" or \"weightless- ness.\" This acceleration is the vectorial resultant of (I) an acceleration of magnitude g, directed outward against so-called gravity, and (2) an ac- celeration directed toward the axis of rotation of the earth, of magnitude w 2 R sin 8 (w, angular ve-"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"§ 1.3.

Each spring-driven cannon succeeds in driving its projectile, a steel ball bearing, through the aligned holes in the sheets of lucite, and into the woven-mesh pocket, when the frame of reference is free of rotation and in free fall (\"normal world line through spacetime\"). A cannon would fail (curved and ricocheting trajectory at bottom of drawing) if the frame were hanging as indicated when the cannon went off (\"frame drawn away by pull of rope from its normal world line through spacetime\"). Harold Waage at Princeton has constructed such a model for an inertial reference frame with lucite sheets about I m square. The \"fuses\" symbolizing time delay were replaced by electric relays.

Rule out both observers to make physics look simple. Instead, travel aboard the freely moving spaceship. Nothing could be more natural than what one sees: every free object moves in a straight line with uniform velocity. This is the way to do physics!

Physics is simple only when viewed locally: that is Einstein's great lesson. Newton spoke differently: \"Absolute space, in its own nature, without relation to anything external, remains always similar and immovable.\" But how does one give meaning to Newton's absolute space, find its cornerstones, mark out its straight lines? In the real world of gravitation, no particle ever follows one of Newton's straight lines. His ideal geometry is beyond observation. \"A comet going past the sun is deviated from an ideal straight line.\" No. There is no pavement on which to mark out that line. The \"ideal straight line\" is a myth. It never happened, and it never will. §1.4. GEOMETRY IS LOCALLY LORENTZIAN 19 Newton's absolute space is unobservable, nonexistent [A. EINSTEIN (1954»). \"It required a severe struggle [for Newton) to arrive at the concept of independent and absolute space, indispensible for the development of theory .... Newton's decision was, in the contemporary state of science, the only possible one, and particularly the only fruitful one. But the subsequent development of the problems, proceeding in a roundabout way which no one could then possibly foresee, has shown that the resistance of Leibniz and Huygens, intuitively well-founded but supported by inadequate argu- ments, was actually justified .... It has required no less strenuous exertions subsequently to overcome this concept [of absolute space)\" What is direct and simple and meaningful, according to Einstein, is the geometry in every local inertial reference frame. There every particle moves in a straight line with uniform velocity. Define the local inertial frame so that this simplicity occurs for the first few particles (Figure 1.7). In the frame thus defined, every other free particle is observed also to move in a straight line with uniform velocity. Collision and disintegration processes follow the laws of conservation of momentum and energy of special relativity. That all these miracles come about, as attested by tens of thousands of observations in elementary particle physics, is witness to the inner workings of the machinery of the world. The message is easy to summarize: (l) physics is always and everywhere locally Lorentzian; i.e., locally the laws of special relativity are valid; (2) this simplicity shows most clearly in a local Lorentz frame of reference (\"inertial frame of reference\"; Figure 1.7); and (3) to test for a local Lorentz frame, test for weightlessness! §1.4.

VYASA, the Mahabarata (ca. A.D. 400) Relative to a local Lorentz frame, a free particle \"moves in a straight line with uniform velocity.\" What \"straight\" means is clear enough in the model inertial reference frame illustrated in Figure 1.7. But where does the \"uniform velocity\" come in? Or where does \"velocity\" show itself? There is not even one clock in the drawing! A more fully developed model of a Lorentz reference frame will have not only holes, as in Fig. 1.7, but also clock-activated shutters over each hole. The projectile can reach its target only if it (l) travels through the correct region in space and (2) gets through that hole in the correct interval of time (\"window in time\"). How then is time defined? Time is defined so that motion looks simple! No standard of time is more widely used than the day, the time from one high noon to the next. Take that as standard, however, and one will find every good clock or watch clashing with it, for a simple reason. The Earth spins on its axis and also revolves in orbit about the sun. The motion of the sun across the sky arises from neither effect alone, but from the two in combination, different in magnitude though they are. The fast angular velocity of the Earth on its axis (roughly 366.25 complete turns per year) is wonderfully uniform. Not so the apparent angular velocity of the sun about the center of the Earth (one turn per year). It is greater than average by 2 per cent when the Earth in its orbit (eccentricity 0.017) has come 1 per cent closer than average to the sun (Kepler's law) and lower by 2 per cent when the Earth is 1 per cent further than average from the sun. In the first case, the momentary rate of rotation of the sun across the sky, expressed in turns per year, is approximately 366.25 - (l + 0.02); The time coordinate of a local Lorentz frame is so defined that motion looks simple"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"24 in the other, 366.25 - (1 - 0.02). 1. GEOMETRODYNAMICS IN BRIEF Taking the \"mean solar day\" to contain 24 X 3.600 = 86,400 standard seconds, one sees that, when the Earth is 1 per cent closer to (or further from) the sun than average, then the number of standard seconds from one high noon to the next is greater (or less) than normal by 0.02 (drop in turns per year) 86400 _ 47 , sec . sec. 365.25 (turns per year on average) This is the bookkeeping on time from noon to noon. No standard of time that varies so much from one month to another is acceptable. If adopted, it would make the speed of light vary from month to month! This lack of uniformity, once recognized (and it was already recognized by the ancients), forces one to abandon the solar day as the standard of time; that day does not make motion look simple. Turn to a new standard that eliminates the motion of the Earth around the sun and concentrates on the spin of the Earth about its axis: the sidereal day, the time between one arrival of a star at the zenith and the next arrival of that star at the zenith. Good! Or good, so long as one's precision of measurement does not allow one to see changes in the intrinsic angular velocity of the Earth. What clock was so bold as first to challenge the spin of the Earth for accuracy? The machinery of the heavens. Halley (1693) and later others, including Kant (1754), suspected something was amiss from apparent discrepancies between the paths of totality in eclipses of the sun, as predicted by Newtonian gravitation theory using the standard of time then current, and the location of the sites where ancient Greeks and Romans actually recorded an eclipse on the day in question. The moon casts a moving shadow in space. On the day of a solar eclipse, that shadow paints onto the disk of the spinning Earth a black brush stroke, often thousands of kilometers in length, but of width generally much less than a hundred kilometers. He who spins the globe upon the table and wants to make the shadow fall rightly on it must calculate back meticu- lously to determine two key items: (1) where the moon is relative to Earth and sun at each moment on the ancient day in question; and (2) how much angle the Earth has turned through from then until now. Take the eclipse of Jan. 14, A.D. 484, as an example (Figure 1.8), and assume the same angular velocity for the Earth in the intervening fifteen centuries as the Earth had in 1900 (astronomical reference point). One comes out wrong. The Earth has to be set back by 30° (or the moon moved from its computed position, or some combination of the two effects) to make the Athens observer fall under the black brush. To catch up those 30° (or less, if part of the effect is due to a slow change in the angular momentum of the moon), the Earth had to tum faster in the past than it does today.

This is \"undoubtedly the most reliable of all ancient European eclipses,\" according to Dr. F. R. Stephenson, of the Department of Geophysics and Planetary Physics of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, who most kindly prepared this diagram especially for this book. He has also sent a passage from the original Greek biography of Proclus of Athens (died at Athens A.D. 485) by Marinus of Naples, reading, \"Nor were there portents wanting in the year which preceded his death; for example, such a great eclipse of the Sun that night seemed to fall by day. For a profound darkness arose so that stars even appeared in the sky. This happened in the eastern sky when the Sun dwelt in Capricorn\" [from Westermann and Boissonade (1878»). Does this 30° for this eclipse, IOgether with corresponding amounts for other eclipses, represent the \"right\" correction? \"Right\" is no easy word. From one total eclipse of the sun in the Mediterranean area to another is normally many years. The various provinces of the Greek and Roman worlds were far from having a uniform level of peace and settled life, and even farther from having a uniform standard of what it is to observe an eclipse and put it down for posterity. If the scores of records of the past are unhappily fragmentary, even more unhappy has been the willingness of a few uncritical \"investigators\" in recent times to rush in and identify this and that historical event with this and that calculated eclipse. Fortunately, by now a great literature is available on the secular deceleration of the Earth's rotation, in the highest tradition of critical scholarship, both astronomical and historical. In addition to the books of o. Neugebauer (1959) and Munk and MacDonald (1960). the paper of Curott (1966), and items cited by these workers, the following are key items.

Good clocks make spacetime trajectories of free particles look straight Thus one sees the downfall of the Earth as a standard of time and its replacement by the orbital motions of the heavenly bodies as a better standard: a standard that does more to \"make motion look simple.\" Astronomical time is itself in turn today being supplanted by atomic time as a standard of reference (see Box lA, \"Time Today\"). Look at a bad clock for a good view of how time is defined. Let t be time on a \"good\" clock (time coordinate of a local inertial frame); it makes the tracks of free particles through the local region of spacetime look straight. Let T(t) be the reading of the \"bad\" clock; it makes the world lines of free particles through the local region of spacetime look curved (Figure 1.9).

It is clear from this example of a \"bad\" time that Newton thought of a \"good\" time when he set up the principle that \"Time flows uniformly\" (d 2 T/dt 2 = 0). Time is defined to make motion look simple! The principle of uniformity, taken by itself, leaves free the scale of the time variable. The quantity T = at + b satisfies the requirement as well as t itself. The history of timekeeping discloses many choices of the unit and origin of time. Each one required some human action to give it sanction, from the fiat of a Pharaoh to the communique of a committee. In this book the amount of time it takes light to travel one centimeter is decreed to be the unit of time. Spacelike intervals and timelike intervals are measured in terms of one and the same geometric unit: the centimeter. Any other decision would complicate in analysis what is simple in nature.

Were the speed of light known with perfect precision, the standards committees could have given in the same breath the number of centimeters in the standard interval.

The following is extracted from a table (not official at time of receipt), kindly sup- plied by the Time and Frequency Division of the U.S. National Bureau of Standards in Boulder, Colorado. Timekeeping capabilities of some familiar clocks are as follows: Tuning fork wrist watch (1960), 1 min/mo. Quartz crystal clock (1921-1930), 1 fLsec/day, 1 sec/yr. Quartz crystal wrist watch (1971), 0.2 sec/2 mos., 1 sec/yr. Cesium beam (atomic resonance, C S 133), (1952- 1955), 0.1 fLsec/day, 0.5 fLsec/mo.

Prior to 1956 the second was defined as the frac- tion 1/86,400 of the mean solar day. From 1956 to 1967 the· \"second\" meant the ephemeris second, defined as the fraction 1/(31,556,925.9747) of the tropical year OOhOOmOOs December 31, 1899. Since 1967 the standard second has been the SI (Systeme International) second, defined as 9,192,631,770 periods of the unperturbed micro- wave transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of C S 133. Like the foregoing evolution of the unit for the time interval, the evolution of a time coordinate has been marked by several stages. Universal time, UTO, is based on the count of days as they actually occurred historically; in other words, on the actual spin of the earth on its axis; historically, on mean solar time (solar position as corrected by the \"equation of time\"; i.e., the faster tra vel of the earth when near the sun than when far from the sun) as determined at Greenwich Observatory. UTI, the \"navigator's time scale,\" is the same time as corrected for the wobble of the earth on its axis (..1t - 0.05 sec). UT2 is UTI as corrected for the periodic fluc- tuations of unknown origin with periods of one- half year and Qne year (..1t - 0.05 sec; measured to 3 ms in one day). Ephemeris Time, ET (as defined by the theory of gravitation and by astronomical observations and calculations), is essentially determined by the orbital motion of the earth around the sun. \"Measurement uncertainties limit the realization of accurate ephemeris time to about 0.05 sec for a nine-year average.\" Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is broadcast on stations such as V,rWV. It was adopted interna- tionally in February 1971 to become effective Jan- uary 1,1972. The clock rate is controlled by atomic clocks to be as uniform as possible for one year (atomic time is measured to -0.1 microsec in 1 min, with diffusion rates of 0.1 microsec per day for ensembles of clocks), but is changed by the infrequent addition or deletion of a second-called a \"leap second\"-so that UTC never differs more than 0.7 sec from the navigator's time scale, UTI.

CURVATURE 29 Recent measurements [Evenson et at. (1972)] change the details of the foregoing 1967 argument, but not the principles. §1.6. CURVATURE Gravitation seems to have disappeared. Everywhere the geometry of spacetime is locally Lorentzian. And in Lorentz geometry, particles move in a straight line with constant velocity. Where is any gravitational deflection to be seen in that? For answer, turn back to the apple (Figure 1.1). Inspect again the geodesic tracks of the ants on the surface of the apple. Note the reconvergence of two nearby geodesics that originally diverged from a common point. What is the analog in the real world of physics? What analogous concept fits Einstein's injunction that physics is only simple when analyzed locally? Don't look at the distance from the spaceship to the Earth. Look at the distance from the spaceship to a nearby spaceship! Or, to avoid any possible concern about attraction between the two ships, look at two nearby test particles in orbit about the Earth. To avoid distraction by the nonlocal element (the Earth) in the situation, conduct the study in the interior of a spaceship, also in orbit about the Earth. But this region has already been counted as a local inertial frame! What gravitational physics is to be seen there? None. Relative to the spaceship and therefore relative to each other, the two test particles move in a straight line with uniform velocity, to the precision of measurement that is contemplated (see Box 1.5, \"Test for Flatness\"). Now the key point begins to appear: precision of measurement. Increase it until one begins to discern the gradual acceleration of the test particles away from each other, if they lie along a common radius through the center of the Earth; or toward each other, if their separation lies perpendicular to that line. In Newtonian language, the source of these accelerations is the tide-pro- ducing action of the Earth. To the observer in the spaceship, however, no Earth is to be seen. And following Einstein, he knows it is important to analyze motion locally. He represents the separation of the new test particle from the fiducial test particle by the vector ~k(k = 1,2,3; components measured in a local Lorentz frame). For the acceleration of this separation, one knows from Newtonian physics what he will find: if the Cartesian z-axis is in the radial direction, then Gravitation is manifest in relative acceleration of neighboring test particles (1.5) Proof: In Newtonian physics the acceleration of a single particle toward the center of the Earth in conventional units of time is Gmconv/r2, where G is the Newtonian constant of gravitation, 6.670 X 10- 8 cm 3 /g sec 2 and m conv is the mass of the Earth in conventional units of grams.

Consequently one particle accelerates toward the other by the stated amount. When the separation is parallel to r, the relative acceleration is given by evaluating the Newtonian acceleration at r and at r + ~, and taking the difference (~times d/dr) Q.E.D. In conclusion, the \"local tide-producing acceleration\" of Newtonian gravitation theory provides the local description of gravitation that Einstein bids one to seek. What has this tide-producing acceleration to do with curvature? (See Box 1.6.) Look again at the apple or, better, at a sphere of radius a (Figure 1.10).

Tide-producing accelera- tion R Z OzO (relative acceleration in z-direction of two test particles initially at rest and separated from each other by 1 cm of vertical elevation) is (d/dr)(m/r 2 ) = -2m/r 3 = -0.888 cm/(6.37 X 10 8 cm)3 = -3.44 X 10- 2 ; cm- 2 (\"cm of relative displacement per cm of light- travel time per cm of light-travel time per cm of vertical separation\").

When the minimum uncertainty o~ attainable in a measurement over a 100 m spacing is \"worse\" than this figure (exceeds 1.72 mm), then to this level of precision the region of spacetime under consideration can be treated as flat. When the uncertainty in measurement is \"better\" (less) than 1.72 mm, then one must limit attention to a smaller region of space or a shorter interval of time or both, to find a region of space- time that can be regarded as flat to that precision."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"§ 1.6.

In two dimensions the direction of acceleration of one geodesic relative to a nearby, fiducial geodesic is fixed uniquely by the demand that their separation vector, f, be perpendicular to the fiducial geodesic (see Figure 1.10). Not so in three dimensions or higher. There f can remain perpendicular to the fiducial geodesic but rotate about it (Figure 1.11). Thus, to specify the relative acceleration uniquely, one must give not only its magnitude, but also its direction. The relative acceleration in three dimensions and higher, then, is a vector. Call it \"D2f /ds 2 ,\" and call its four components \"D2~a:/ds2.\" Why the capital D? Why not \"d2~a: / ds 2 \"? Because our coordinate system is completely arbitrary (cf. § 1.2). The twisting and turning of the coordinate lines can induce changes from point to point in the components ~a: of f, even if the vector f is not changing at all. Consequently, the accelerations of the components d2~a: / ds 2 are generally not equal to the compo- nents D2~a: / ds 2 of the acceleration! How, then, in curved spacetime can one determine the components D2~a:/ds2 of the relative acceleration? By a more complicated version of the equation of geodesic deviation (1.6).

Nothing seems more attractive at first glance than the idea that gravitation is a manifestation of the curvature of space (A)-, and nothing more ridicu- lous at a second glance (B). How can the tracks of a ball and of a bullet be curved so differently if that curvature arises from the geometry of space? No wonder that great Riemann did not give the world a geometric theory of gravity. Yes, at the age of 28 (June 10, 1854) he gave the world the mathematical machinery to define and calcu- late curvature (metric and Riemannian geometry). Yes, he spent his dying days at 40 working to find a unified account of electricity and gravitation. But if there was one reason more than any other why he failed to make the decisive connection between gravitation and curvature, it was this, that he thought of space and the curvature of space, not of spacetime and the curvature of spacetime. To make that forward step took the forty years to special relativity (1905: time on the same footing as space) and then another ten years (1915: gen- eral relativity). Depicted in spacetime (C), the tracks of ball and bullet appear to have compara- ble curvature. In fact, however, neither track has any curvature at all. They both look curved in (C) only because one has forgotten that the spacetime they reside in is itself curved-curved precisely enough to make these tracks the straightest lines in existence (\"geodesics\"). If it is at first satisfying to see curvature, and curvature of spacetime at that, coming to the fore in so direct a way, then a little more reflection produces a renewed sense of concern.

The field equation shows how the stress-energy of matter generates an average curvature (Einstein = G) in its neighborhood. Simultaneously, the field equation is a propagation equation for the remaining, anisotropic part of the curvature: it governs the external spacetime curvature of a static source (Earth); it governs the generation of gravitational waves (ripples in curvature of spacetime) by stress-energy in motion; and it governs the propagation of those waves through the universe. The field equation even contains within itself the equations of motion (\"Force = LIbrary of E. T. Hochschule. Zunch AcademIa des SCIences.

The field equation governs the motion of the planets in the solar system; it governs the deflection of light by the sun; it governs the collapse of a star to form a black hole; it determines uniquely the external spacetime geometry of a black hole (\"a black hole has no hair\"); it governs the evolution of spacetime singularities at the end point of collapse; it governs the expansion and recontraction of the universe. And more; much more. In order to understand how the simple equation G = 8'7TT can be so all powerful, it is desirable to backtrack, and spend a few chapters rebuilding the entire picture of spacetime, of its curvature, and of its laws, this time with greater care, detail, and mathematics.

In turn, particles and other sources of mass-energy cause curvature in the geometry. How does one break into this closed loop of the action of geometry on matter and the reaction of matter on geometry? One can begin no better than by analyzing the motion of particles and the dynamics of fields in a region of spacetime so limited that it can be regarded as flat. (See \"Test for Flatness,\" Box 1.5). Chapters 2-6 develop this flat-spacetime viewpoint (special relativity). The reader, it is assumed. is already somewhat familiar with special relativity:* 4-vectors in general: the energy-momentum 4-vector; elementary Lorentz transformations: the Lorentz law for the force on a charged particle; at least one look at one equation • For example, see Goldstein (1959).

GEOMETRIC OBJECTS Everything that goes on in spacetime has its geometric deSCription, and almost every one of these descriptions lends itself to ready generalization from flat spacetime to curved spacetime. The greatest of the differences between one geometric object and another is its scope: the individual object (vector) for the momentum of a certain particle at a certain phase in its history, as contrasted to the extended geometric object that describes an electromagnetic field defined throughout space and time (\"antisymmetric second-rank tensor field\" or, more briefly, \"field of 2-forms\"). The idea that every physical quantity must be describable by a geometric object, and that the laws of physics must all be expressible as geometric relationships between these geometric objects, had its intellectual beginnings in the Erlanger program of Felix Klein (1872), came closer to physics in Einstein's \"principle of general covari- ance\" and in the writings of Hermann Weyl (1925), seems to have first been formu- lated clearly by Veblen and Whitehead (1932), and today pervades relativity theory, both special and general. A. Nijenhuis (1952) and S.-S. Chern (1960, 1966, 1971)have expounded the mathe- matical theory of geometric objects. But to understand or do research in geometro- dynamics, one need not master this elegant and beautiful subject. One need only know that geometric objects in spacetime are entities that exist independently of coordinate systems or reference frames. A point in spacetime (\"event\") is a geometric object. The arrow linking two neighboring events (\"vector\") is a geometric object in flat spacetime, and its generalization, the \"tangent vector,\" is a geometric object even when spacetime is curved. The \"metric\" (machine for producing the squared length of any vector; see Box 1.3) is a geometric object. No coordinates are needed to define any of these concepts. The next few sections will introduce several geometric objects, and show the roles they playas representatives of physical quantities in flat spacetime."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"§2.3.

This arrow is easily drawn on a spacetime diagram. It accurately shows the 4-velocity of the particle. However, the derivative formula u = d9/dT for computing the same displacement (I) is more suggestive of the velocity concept and (2) lends itself to the case of accelerated motion. Thus, given a world line 9(T) that is not straight, as in Figure 2.2, one must first form d9/dT, and only thereafter draw the straight line 9(0) + ;\\(d':P /dT)O of the arrow u = d9/dT to display the 4-velocity u."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"50 2.

(See \"Farewell to 'ict,'\" Box 2.1.) More fundamental than the components of a vector is the vector itself. It is a geometric object with a meaning independent of all coordinates. Thus a particle has a world line 9(T), and a 4-velocity u = d9/dT, that have nothing to do with any coordinates. Coordinates enter the picture when analysis on a computer is required (rejects vectors; accepts numbers).

METRIC TENSOR Box 2.1 FAREWELL TO \"iet\" One sometime participant in special relativity will have to be put to the sword: \"x 4 = ict.\" This imaginary coordinate was invented to make the geometry of spacetime look formally as little different as possible from the geometry of Eu- clidean space; to make a Lorentz transformation look on paper like a rotation; and to spare one the distinction that one otherwise is forced to make between quantities with upper indices (such as the components piJ. of the energy-momentum vector) and quantities with lower indices (such as the components PiJ. of the energy-momentum I-form). However, it is no kindness to be spared this latter distinction. Without it, one cannot know whether a vector (§2.3) is meant or the very different geo- metric object that is a I-form (§2.5). Moreover, there is a significant difference between an angle on which everything depends periodically (a rota- tion) and a parameter the increase of which gives rise to ever-growing momentum differences (the \"velocity parameter\" of a Lorentz transformation; Box 2.4). If the imaginary time-coordinate hides from view the character of the geometric object being dealt with and the nature of the parameter in a transformation, it also does something even more serious: it hides the completely different metric structure (§2.4) of + + + geometry and - + + + geometry. In Euclidean geometry, when the distance between two points is zero, the two 51 points must be the same point. In Lorentz-Min- kowski geometry, when the interval between two events is zero, one event may be on Earth and the other on a supernova in the galaxy M3l, but their separation must be a null ray (piece of a light cone). The backward-pointing light cone at a given event contains all the events by which that event can be influenced. The forward-pointing light cone contains all events that it can influence. The multi- tude of double light cones taking off from all the events of spacetime forms an interlocking causal structure. This structure makes the machinery of the physical world function as it does (further comments on this structure in Wheeler and Feyn- man 1945 and 1949 and in Zeeman 1964). If in a region where spacetime is flat, one can hide this structure from view by writing with x 4 = ict, no one has discovered a way to make an imaginary coordinate work in the general curved spacetime manifold. If \"x 4 = ict\" cannot be used there, it will not be used here. In this chapter and hereafter, as throughout the literature of general relativity, a real time coordinate is used, XO = t = ct conv (superscript 0 rather than 4 to avoid any possibility of confusion with the imagi- nary time coordinate).

This is a vector of unit length. Multiply by the mass m of the particle to obtain the momentum vector p =mu. But physics gives also quite another idea of momentum.

Given the machine ii., it is straightforward to draw the corresponding surfaces in spacetime. Pick a point ?Yo at which the machine is to reside. The surface of ii. that passes through ?Yo contains points ?Y for which (ii., ?Y - ?Yo) = 0 (no bongs of bell).

COLLISIONS Whatever the physical entity, whether it is an individual mass in motion, or a torrent of fluid, or a field of force, or t~e geometry of space itself, it is described in classical general relativity as a geometric object of its own characteristic kind. Each such object is built directly or by abstraction from identifiable points, and needs no coordinates for its representation. It has been seen how this coordinate-free description translates into, and how it can be translated out of, the language of coordinates and compo- nents, and how components in a local Lorentz frame transform under a Lorentz transformation. Turn now to two elementary applications of this mathematical machinery to a mass in motion. One has to do with short-range forces (collisions, this section); the other, with the long-range electromagnetic force (Lorentz force law, next chapter). In a collision, all the change in momentum is concentrated in a time that is short Scattering of particles compared to the time of observation. Moreover, the target is typically so small, and quantum mechanics so dominating, that a probabilistic description is the right one.

It would be out of place here to enter into the calculation of such cross sections, though it is a fascinating branch of atomic physics. It IS enough to note that the cross section is an area oriented perpendicular to the line of travel of the incident particle. Therefore it is unaffected by any boost of the observer in that direction, provided of course that energies and angles of emergence of the particles are transformed in accordance with the magnitude of that boost (\"same events seen in an altered reference system\"). Over and above any such detailed account of the encounter as follows from the local dynamic analysis, there stands the law of conservation of energy-momentum: Conservation of energy-momentum in a collision original final particles, J particles, K (2.47) Out of this relation, one wins without further analysis such simple results as the following. (1) A photon traveling as a plane wave through empty space cannot split (not true for a focused photon!). (2) When a high-energy electron strikes an electron at rest in an elastic encounter, and the two happen to come off sharing the energy equally, then the angle between their directions of travel is less than the Newtonian value of 90 0 , and the deficit gives a sim pIe measure of the energy of the primary. (3) When an electron makes a head-on elastic encounter with a proton, the formula for the fraction of kinetic energy transferred has three rather different limiting forms, according to whether the energy of the electron is nonrelativistic, relativistic, or extreme-relativistic. (4) The threshold for the production of an (e+, e-) pair by a photon in the field of force of a massive nucleus is 2m e . (5) The threshold for the production of an (e+, e-) pair by a photon in an encounter with an electron at rest • is 4m e (or 4m e - f when account is taken of the binding of the e+e-e- system in a very light \"molecule\"). All these results (topics for independent projects!) and more can be read out of the law of conservation of energy-momentum.

THE LORENTZ FORCE AND THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD TENSOR At the opposite extreme from an impulsive change of momentum in a collision (the last topic of Chapter 2) is the gradual change in the momentum of a charged particle under the action of electric and magnetic forces (the topic treated here). Let electric and magnetic fields act on a system of charged particles. The accelera- tions of the particles reveal the electric and magnetic field strengths. In other words, the Lorentz force law, plus measurements on the components of acceleration of test particles, can be viewed as defining the components of the electric and magnetic fields. Once the field components are known from the accelerations of a few test particles, they can be used to predict the accelerations of other test particles (Box 3.1). Thus the Lorentz force law does double service (1) as definer of fields and (2) as predicter of motions. Here and elsewhere in science, as stressed not least by Henri Poincare, that view is out of date which used to say, \"Define your terms before you proceed. \" All the laws and theories of physics, including the Lorent= force law, have this deep and subtle character, that they both define the concepts they use (here B and E) and make statements about these concepts.

The acceleration in the x-direction merely remeasures the already once measured E z . To evaluate B z ' a third test particle is required, but it then gives duplicate information about the other field components. The alternative? Use all N particles simultaneously and on the same democratic footing, both in the evaluation of the six F af3 and in the testing of the Lorentz force, by applying the method of least squares. Thus, write the discrepancy between predicted and observed acceleration of the Kth particle in the form U K _ ..!!- F Uf3,K = Sa K (3) a m af3 a' Take the squared magnitude of this discrepancy and sum over all the particles In this expression, everything is regarded as known except the six F af3 . Minimize with respect to these six unknowns. In this way, arrive at six equations for the components of Band E. These equations once solved, one goes back to (3) to test the Lor- entz force law. The 6 X 6 determinant of the coefficients in the equation for the F af3 automatically vanishes when there are only two test particles. The same line of reasoning permits one to determine the minimum number of test particles required to determine all the components of the Riemann curvature tensor. To make explicit the simpler procedure for elec- tromagnetism will indicate in broad outline how one similarly determines all the components of Ra f3y8 for gravity. Begin by asking how many test particles one needs to determine the three compo- nents of B and the three components of E in the neighborhood under study. For one particle, three components of acceleration are measurable; for a second particle, three more. Enough? No! The information from the one duplicates in part the information from the other. The proof? Whatever the state of motion of the first test particle, pick one's Lorentz frame to be moving the same way. Having zero velocity in this frame, the particle has a zero response to any magnetic field. The electric field alone acts on the particle. The three compo- nents of its acceleration give directly the three components E z ' Ell' E z of the electric field.

(3.1) Useful though this version of the equation may be, it is far from the geometric spirit of Einstein. A fully geometric equation will involve the test particle's energy-mo- mentum 4-vector, p, not just the spatial part p as measured in a specific Lorentz frame; and it will ask for the rate of change of momentum not as measured by a specific Lorentz observer (djdt), but as measured by the only clock present a priori in the problem: the test particle's own clock (djdT). Thus, the lefthand side of a fully geometric equation will read dpjdT = . The righthand side, the Lorentz 4-force, must also be a frame-independent object. It will be linear in the particle's 4-velocity u, since the frame-dependent expression dp dT e _ ~ (E + vxB) = e(uOE + uxB) v I - v 2 (3.2a) is linear in the components of u.

Now on the scene are several different tensors: the metric tensor 9 (§2.4), the Riemann curvature tensor Riemann (§ 1.6), the electromagnetic field tensor Faraday (§3.l). Each has been defined as a linear machine with input slots for vectors, and with an output that is either a real number, e.g., g(u, v), or a vector, e.g., Riemann (u, v, w) and Faraday (u). Should one make a distinction between tensors whose outputs are scalars, and tensors whose outputs are vectors? No! A tensor whose output is a vector can be reinterpreted trivially as one whose output is a scalar. Take, for example, Fara- day = F. Add a new slot for the insertion of an arbitrary I-form u, and gears and wheels that guarantee the output F(u, u) = (u, F(u) = real number. (3.8) (3.9) Then permit the user to choose whether he inserts only a vector, and gets out the vector F( . .. , u) = F(u), or whether he inserts a 'form and a vector, and gets out the number F(u, u). The same machine will do both jobs. Moreover, in terms of components in a given Lorentz frame, both jobs are achieved very simply: F( .. . , u) is a vector with components F\"-f3uf3; F(u, u) is the number (u, F( ... , u) = o,,Fa f3u f3 ."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"By analogy, one defines the most general tensor H and its rank (~ as 'follows: H is a linear machine with n input slots for n I-forms, and m input slots for m vectors; given the requested input, it puts out a real number denoted §3.2.

THREE-PLUS-ONE VIEW VERSUS GEOMETRIC VIEW Great computational and conceptual power resides in Einstein's geometric view of physics. Ideas that seem complex when viewed in the everyday \"space-plus-time\" or \"3 + I\" manner become elegant and simple when viewed as relations between geometric objects in four-dimensional spacetime. Derivations that are difficult in 3 + I language simplify in geometric language. The electromagnetic field is a good example. In geometric language, it is described by a second-rank, antisymmetric tensor (\"2-form\") F, which requires no coordinates for its definition. This tensor produces a 4-force on any charged particle given by dpjdT = eF(u). It is all so simple! By contrast, consider the \"3 + I\" viewpoint. In a given Lorentz frame, there is an electric field E and a magnetic field B. They push on a particle in accordance with dpjdt = e(E + v x B). But the values of p, E, l', and B all change when one passes from the given Lorentz frame to a new one. For example, the electric and magnetic fields viewed from a rocket ship (\"barred\" frame) are related to those viewed in the laboratory (\"un- barred\" frame) by (3.23) (Here \"II\" means component along direction of rocket's motion; \"1.\" means perpen- dicular component; and {3; = dxirocketjdt is the rocket's ordinary velocity.)

Consider, for example, the transformation law (3.23) for the electric and magnetic fields. The geometric view derives it as follows: (l) Orient the axes of the two frames so their relative motion is in the z-direction.

EXTERIOR CALCULUS This chapter is all Track 2. It is needed as preparation for §§ 14.5 and 14.6 (computation of curvature using differential forms) and for Chapter 15 (Bianchi identities and boundary of a boundary), but is not needed for the rest of the book. Stacks of surfaces, individually or intersecting to make \"honeycombs,\" \"egg crates,\" and other such structures (\"differential forms\"), give unique insight into the geometry of electromagnetism and gravitation. However, such insight comes at some cost in time. Therefore, most readers should skip this chapter and later material that depends on it during a first reading of this book. Analytically speaking, differential forms are completely antisymmetric tensors; pictorially speaking, they are intersecting stacks of surfaces. The mathematical formalism for manipulating differential forms with ease, called \"exterior calculus,\" is summarized concisely in Box 4.1; its basic features are illustrated in the rest of this chapter by rewriting electromagnetic theory in its language. An effective way to tackle this chapter might be to (1) scan Box 4.1 to get the flavor of the formalism; (2) read the rest of the chapter in detail; (3) restudy Box 4.1 carefully; (4) get practice in manipulating the formalism by working the exercises. * (continued on page 99) • Exterior calculus is. treated in greater detail than here by: E.

There is no simpler way to illustrate this 2-form representation of the electromag- netic field than to consider a magnetic field in the x-direction: F yZ = -F\"y = B x ' F = B x dy /\\ dz. (4.3) The I-form dy = grad y is the set of surfaces (actually hypersurfaces) y = 18 (all t, x, z),y = 19 (all t, x, z),y= 20 (all t, x, z), etc.; and surfaces uniformly interpolated between them. Similarly for the I-form dz. The intersection between these two sets of surfaces produces a honeycomb-like structure. That structure becomes a \"2-form\" when it is supplemented by instructions (see arrows in Figure 4.1) that give a \"sense of circulation\" to each tube of the honeycomb (order of factors in the \"wedge product\" of equation 4.2; dy /\\ dz = -dz /\\ dy). The 2-form F in the example differs from this \"basis 2-form\" dy /\\ dz only in this respect, that where dy /\\ dz had one tube, the field 2-form has B x tubes. When one considers a tubular structure that twists and turns on its way through spacetime. one must have more components to describe it.

Moreover, those tubes provide the most direct geometric representation that anyone has ever been able to give for the machinery by which the electromagnetic field acts on a charged particle.

ELECTROMAGNETISM AND DIFFERENTIAL FORMS Box 4.2 ABSTRACTING A 2-FORM FROM THE CONCEPT OF \"HONEYCOMB- LIKE STRUCTURE,\" IN 3-SPACE AND IN SPACETIME Open up a cardboard carton containing a dozen bottles, and observe the honeycomb structure of intersecting north-south and east-west cardboard separators between the bottles. That honeycomb structure of \"tubes\" (\"channels for bottles\") is a fairly apt illustration of a 2-form in the context of everyday 3-space. It yields a number (number of tubes cut) for each choice of smooth element of 2-surface slicing through the three-dimensional structure. However, the intersecting cardboard separators are rather too specific. All that a true 2-form can ever give is the number of tubes sliced through, not the \"shape\" of the tubes. Slew the carton around on the floor by 45 0 • Then half the separators run NW-SE and the other half run NE-SW, but through a given bit of 2-surface fixed in 3-space the count of tubes is unchanged. There- fore, one should be careful to make the concept of tubes in the mind's eye abstract enough that one envisages direction of tubes (vertical in the example) and density of tubes, but not any specific location or orientation for the tube walls. Thus all the following representations give one and the same 2-form, CT: CT = B dx /\\ dy; CT = B(2 dx) /\\ (~ dY) (NS cardboards spaced twice as close as before: EW cardboards spaced twice as wide as before); CT = Bd(X 0) /\\ d(X ;I) (cardboards rotated through 45 0 ); a dx + f3 dy /\\ Y dx + 0 dy CT-B----= - (ao - f3y)1/2 (ao - f3y)1/2 (both orientation and spacing of \"cardboards\" changing from point to point, with all four functions, 0:, /1, y, and 8, depending on position). What has physical reality, and constitutes the real geometric object, is not anyone of the I-forms just encountered individually, but only the 2-form CT itself. This circumstance helps to explain why in the physical literature one sometimes refers to \"tubes of force\" and sometimes to \"lines of force.\" The two terms for the same structure have this in common, that each yields a number when sliced by a bit of surface. The line-of-force picture has the advantage of not imposing on the mind any specific structure of \"sheets of cardboard\"; that is, any specific decomposition of the 2-form into the product of I-forms. However, that very feature is also a disadvantage, for in a calculation one often finds it useful to have a well-defined representa- tion of the 2-form as the wedge product of I-forms. Moreover, the tube picture, abstract though it must be if it is to be truthful, also has this advan- tage, that the orientation of the elementary tubes (sense of circulation as indicated by arrows in Figures 4.1 and 4.5, for example) lends itself to ready visualization. Let the \"walls\" of the tubes therefore remain in all pictures drawn in this book as a reminder that 2-forms can be built out of I-forms; but let it be understood here and here- after how manyfold are the options for the indi- vidual I-forms! Turn now from three dimensions to four, and find that the concept of \"honeycomb-like struc- ture\" must be made still more abstract. In three dimensions the arbitrariness of the decomposition of the 2-form into I-forms showed in the slant and packing of the \"cardboards,\" but had no effect on the verticality ,of the \"channels for the bottles\" (\"direction of Faraday lines of force or tubes of"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"103 §4.2. ELECTROMAGNETIC 2·FORM AND LORENTZ FORCE .~ --------------------------------------. force\"); not so in four dimensions, or at least not in the generic case in four dimensions. In special cases, the story is almost as simple in four dimensions as in three. An example of a special case is once again the 2-form C1 = B dx /\\ dy, with all the options for decomposition into I-forms that have already been mentioned, but with every option giving the same \"direction\" for the tubes. If the word \"direction\" now rises in status from \"tube walls unpierced by motion in the direction of increasing z\" to \"tube walls un- pierced either by motion in the direction of in- creasing z, or by motion in the direction of in- creasing t, or by any linear combination of such motions,\" that is a natural enough consequence of adding the new dimension. Moreover, the same simplicity prevails for an electromagnetic plane wave. For example, let the wave be advancing in the z-direction, and let the electric polarization point in the x-direction; then for a monochromatic wave, one has and all components distinct from these equal zero. Faraday is F = F Ol dt /\\ dx + F 31 dz /\\ dx = Eo cos w(z - t) d(z - t) /\\ dx, which is again representable as a single wedge product of two I-forms. Not so in general! The general 2-form in four dimensions consists of six distinct wedge products, F = F Ol dt /\\ dx + F 02 dt /\\ dy + '\" + F 23 dy /\\ dz. It is too much to hope that this expression will reduce in the generic case to a single wedge prod- uct of two I-forms (\"simple\"2-form). It is not even true that it will. It is only remarkable that it can be reduced from six exterior products to two (de- tails in exercise 4.1); thus, Each product n i /\\ (i individually can be visual- ized as a honeycomb-like structure like those de- picted in Figures 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, and 4.5. Each such structure individually can be pictured as built out of intersecting sheets (I-forms), but with such de- tails as the tilt and packing of these I-forms ab- stracted away. Each such structure individually gives a number when sliced by an element of surface. What counts for the 2-form F, however, is neither the number of tubes of n 1 /\\ (l cut by the surface, nor the number of tubes of n 2 /\\ (2 cut by the surface, but only the sum of the two. This sum is what is referred to in the text as the \"number of tubes of F\" cut by the surface. The contribution of either wedge product individua~y is not well-defined, for a simple reason: the de- composition of a six-wedge-product object into two wedge products, miraculous though it seems, is actually far from unique (details in exercise 4.2). In keeping with the need to have two products of I-forms to represent the general 2-form note that the vanishing of dF (\"no magnetic charges\") does not automatically imply that d(n 1 /\\ (1) or d(n 2 /\\ (2) separately vanish. Note also that any spacelike slice through the general 2-form F (re- duction from four dimensions to three) can always be represented in terms of a honeycomb-like structure (\"simple\" 2-form in three dimensions; Faraday's picture of magnetic tubes of force). Despite the abstraction that has gone on in see- ing in all generality what a 2-form is, there is no bar to continuing to use the term \"honeycomb-like structure\" in a broadened sense to describe this object; and that is the practice here and hereafter."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"y F Contract eu ~ with ---------- .... -~ n 6J~:4 - 2 06'8 2 - 3 - t]1j p+2 p+1 P n - + t]P+12 Figure 4.2.

In brief, there are two such structures, one Faraday = F, the other Maxwell = * F, each dual (\"perpendicular,\" the only place where metric need enter the discussion) to the other, each satisfying an elementary equation: dF = 0 (\"no tubes of Faraday ever end\") and d*F = 417 *J (4.10) (4.11 ) (\"the number of tubes of Maxwell that end in an elementary volume is equal to the amount of electric charge in that volume\").

What changes is only the mathematical formula that describes it. §4.4. RADIATION FIELDS The Maxwell structure of tubes associated with a charge in uniform motion is more remarkable than it may seem at first sight, and not only because of the Lorentz contraction of the tubes in the direction of motion. The tubes arbitrarily far away move on in military step with the charge on which they center, despite the fact that there is no time for information \"emitted\" from the charge \"right now\" to get to the faraway tube \"right now.\" The structure of the faraway tubes \"right now\" must therefore derive from the charge at an earlier moment on its uniform-motion, straight-line trajectory. This circumstance shows up nowhere more clearly than in what happens to the field in consequence of a sudden change, in a short time ,,'h, from one uniform velocity to another uniform velocity (Figure 4.6). The tubes have the standard patterns for the two states of motion, one pattern within a sphere of radius r, the other outside that sphere, where r is equal to the lapse of time (\"cm of light-travel time\") since the acceleration took place. The necessity for the two patterns to fit together in the intervening zone, of thickness ..dr = ..dr, forces the field there to be multiplied up by a \"stretching factor,\" proportional to r. This factor is responsible for the well-known fact that radiative forces fall off inversely only as the first power of the distance (Figure 4.6). When the charge continuously changes its state of motion, the structure of the electromagnetic field, though based on the same simple principles as those illustrated in Figure 4.6, nevertheless looks more complex.

The forms F = Faraday, and * F = Maxwell, can be described in any coordinates one pleases-or in a language (honeycomb and egg-crate structures) free of any reference whatsoever to coordinates. Remarkably, neither equation makes any reference whatsoever to metric. As Hermann Weyl was one of the most emphatic in stressing (see also Chapters 8 and 9), the concepts of form and exterior derivative are metric- free.

Two-forms are seen in this box to be of two kinds: (I) a special 2-form, known as a \"closed\" 2-form, which has the property that as many tubes enter a closed 2-surface as emerge from it (exterior derivative of2-form zero; no 3-form derivable from it other than the trivial zero 3-form!); and (2) a general 2-form, which sends across a closed 2-surface a non-zero net number of tubes, and therefore permits one to define a nontrivial3-form (\"exterior derivative of the 2-form\"), which has precisely as many egg-crate cells in any closed 2-surface as the net number of tubes of the 2-form emerging from that same closed 2-surface (generalization of Faraday's concept of tubes of force to the world of spacetime, curved as well as flat).

That tool is the stress-energy tensor. It is the focus of attention in this chapter. The essential features of the stress-energy tensor are summarized in Box 5.1 for the benefit of readers who want to rush on into gravitation physics as quickly as possible. Such readers can proceed directly from Box 5.1 into Chapter 6-though by doing so, they close the door on several later portions of track two, which lean heavily on material treated in this chapter. §5.2.

Spacetime contains a flowing \"river\" of 4-momentum. Each particle carries its 4-momentum vector with itself along its world line. Many particles, on many world lines, viewed in a smeared-out manner (continuum approximation), produce a continuum flow-a river of 4-momentum. Electromagnetic fields, neutrino fields, me&on fields: they too contribute to the river. How can the flow of the river be quantified? By means of a linear machine: the stress-energy tensor T.

TRACK-1 OVERVIEW Box 5.1 CHAPTER 5 SUMMARIZED A. STRESS-ENERGY TENSOR AS A MACHINE 131 At each event in spacetime, there exists a stress-energy tensor. It is a machine that contains a knowledge of the energy density, momentum density, and stress as measured by any and all observers at that event. Included are energy, momentum, and stress associated with all forms of matter and all nongravitational fields. The stress-energy tensor is a linear, symmetric machine with two slots for the insertion of two vectors: T( . .. , ... ). Its output, for given input, can be summarized as follows.

STRESS-ENERGY TENSOR AND CONSERVATION LAWS B. STRESS-ENERGY TENSOR FOR A PERFECT FLUID One type of matter studied extensively later in this book is a \"perfect fluid.\" A perfect fluid is a fluid or gas that (1) moves through spacetime with a 4-velocity u which may vary from event to event, and (2) exhibits a density of mass-energy p and an isotropic pressure p in the rest frame of each fluid element. Shear stresses, anisotropic pressures, and viscosity must be absent, or the fluid is not perfect. The stress-energy tensor for a perfect fluid at a given event can be constructed from the metric tensor, g, the 4-ve1ocity, u, and the rest-frame density and pressure, p and p: T = (p + p)u ® u + pg, In the fluid's rest frame, the components of this stress-energy tensor have the expected form (insert into a slot of T, as 4-velocity of observer, just the fluid's 4-velocity): T\"/3u/3 = [(p + p)u\"u/3 + p8\"/3]u/3 = -(p + p)u\" + pu\" = -pu\"; I.e., TO/3u/3 = -p = -(mass-energy density) = -dpo/dV, Tj/3u/3 = 0 = -(momentum density) = -dpiJdV; also T;k = T(ej' ek) = p8 jk = stress-tensor components.

CONSERVATION OF 4-MOMENTUM: INTEGRAL FORMULATION Energy-momentum conservation has been a cornerstone of physics for more than a century. Nowhere does its essence shine forth so clearly as in Einstein's geometric formulation of it (Figure 5.3,a). There one examines a four-dimensional region of spacetime 'V bounded by a closed, three-dimensional surface a'V. As particles and fields flow into 'V and later out, they carry 4-momentum. Inside 'V the particles collide, break up, radiate; radiation propagates, jiggles particles, produces pairs. But at each stage in this complex maze of physical processes, total energy-momentum is conserved. The energy-momentum lost by particles goes into fields; the energy- momentum lost by fields goes into particles. So finally, when the \"river\" of 4-mo- mentum exits from 'V, it carries out precisely the same energy-momentum as it carried in. Restate this equality by asking for the total flux of 4-momentum outward across a'V. Count inflowing 4-momentum negatively.

Focus attention on a region so far from any attracting matter, and so free of disturbance, that (to some proposed degree of precision) spacetime there can be considered to be flat and to have Lorentz geometry. Let the observer acquire the feeling that he is subject to gravity, either because of jet rockets strapped to his legs or because he is in a rocket-driven spaceship. How does physics look to him? Dare one answer this question? At this early stage in the book, is one not too ignorant of gravitation physics to predict what physical effects will be measured by an observer who thinks he is in a gravitational field, although he is really in an accelerated spaceship? Quite the contrary; special relativity was developed precisely to predict the physics of accelerated objects-e.g., the radiation from an accelerated charge. Even the fantastic accelerations anuclear __ v 2 /r __ 10 31 cm/sec 2 -- 10 28 \"earth gravities\" suffered by a neutron bound in a nucleus. and the even greater accelerations met in high-energy particle-scattering events, are routinely and accurately treated within Accelerated motion and accelerated observers can be analyzed using special relativity"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Box 6.1 GENERAL RELATIVITY IS BUILT ON SPECIAL RELATIVITY A tourist in a powered interplanetary rocket feels \"gravity.\" Can a physicist by local effects convince him that this \"gravity\" is bogus? Never, says Ein- stein's principle of the local equivalence of gravity and accelerations. But then the physicist will make no errors if he deludes himself into treating true gravity as a local illusion caused by acceleration. Under this delusion, he barges ahead and solves gravitational problems by using special relativity: if he is clever enough to divide every problem into a network of local questions, each solvable under such a delusion, then he can work out all influ- ences of any gravitational field. Only three basic principles are invoked: special-relativity physics, the equivalence principle, and the local nature of physics. They are simple and clear. To apply them, however, imposes a double task: (I) take space- time apart into locally flat pieces (where the prin- ciples are valid), and (2) put these pieces together again into a comprehensible picture. To undertake this dissection and reconstitution, to see curved dynamic spacetime inescapably take form, and to see the consequences for physics: that is general relativity. the framework of special relativity.

(Note that an acceleration of one \"earth gravity\" corre- sponds to g-1 _ 10- 3 sec 2 /cm _ 10 18 cm - 1 light-year, so the restriction 1« l/g is normally not severe.) To deduce the results of experiments and observations performed by an accelerated observer, one can analyze them in coordinate-independent, geometric terms, and then project the results onto the basis vectors of his accelerated frame. Alternatively, one can analyze the experiments and observations in a Lorentz frame, and then transform to the accelerated frame. As deduced in this manner, the results of experiments performed locally (at 1« l/g) by an accelerated observer differ from the results of the same experiments performed in a Lorentz frame in only three ways: (1) There are complicated fractional differences of order gl « 1 mentioned above, that can be made negligible by making the accelerated frame small enough. (2) There are Coriolis forces of precisely the same type as are encountered in Newtonian theory (exercise 6.8). These the observer can get rid of by carefully preventing his latticework from rotating-e.g., by tying it to gyroscopes that he accelerates with himself by means of forces applied to their centers of mass (no torque!). Such a nonrotating latticework has \"Fermi-Walker trans- ported\" basis vectors (§6.5), (1) where u = 4-velocity, and a = duldT = 4-acceleration. (3) There are inertial forces of precisely the same type as are encountered in Newtonian theory (exercise 6.8).

RADAR SPEED INDICATOR A radar set measures velocity by emitting a signal at a standard frequency and comparing it with the frequency of the signal reflected back by another object.

How useful is this radar set as a velocity-mea- suring instrument for a uniformly_ accelerated observer?

CONSTRAINTS ON SIZE OF AN ACCELERATED FRAME It is very easy to put together the words \"the coordinate system of an accelerated observer,\" but it is much harder to find a concept these words might refer to. The most useful first remark one can make about these words is that, if taken seriously, they are self-contradictory. The definite article \"the\" in this phrase suggests that one is thinking of some unique coordinate system naturally associated with some specified accelerated observer, such as one whose world line is given in equation (6.5). If the coordinate system is indeed natural, one would expect that the coordi- na tes of any event could be determined by a sufficiently ingenious observer by sending and receiving light signals. But from Figure 6.1 it is clear that the events composing one quarter of all spacetime (Zone III) can neither send light signals to, nor receive light signals from, the specified observer. Another half of spacetime suffers lesser disabilities in this respect: Zone II cannot send to the observer, Zone IV cannot receive from him. It is hard to see how the observer could define in any natural way a coordinate system covering events with which he has no causal relationship, which he cannot see, and from which he cannot be seen! Difficulties also occur when one considers an observer who begins at rest in one frame, is accelerated for a time, and maintains thereafter a constant velocity, at rest in some other inertial coordinate system.

World line of an observer who has undergone a brief period of acceleration. In each phase of motion at constant velocity, an inertial coordinate system can be set up. However, there is no way to reconcile these discordant coordinates in the region of overlap (beginning at distance g-l to the left of the region of acceleration). a coordinate system? Then this coordinate system (1) should be the inertial frame x/L in which he was at rest for times X o less than O. and (2) should be the other inertial frame x/L' for times x o ' > T in which he was at rest in that other frame. Evidently some further thinking would be required to decide how to define the coordinates in the regions not determined by these two conditions (Figure 6.2). More serious, however, is the fact that these two conditions are inconsistent for a region of spacetime that satisfies simultaneously X o < 0 and x o ' > T. In both examples of accelerated motion (Figures 6.1 and 6.2), the serious difficulties about defining a coordinate system begin only at a finite distance g-1 from the world line of the accelerated observer. The problem evidently has no solution for distances from the world line greater than g-l. It does possess a natural solution in the immediate vicinity of the observer. This solution goes under the name of \"Fermi-Walker transported orthonormal tetrad.\" The essential idea lends itself to simple illustration for hyperbolic motion, as follows. §6.4. THE TETRAD CARRIED BY A UNIFORMLY ACCELERATED OBSERVER An infinitesimal version of a coordinate system is supplied by a \"tetrad,\" or \"moving frame\" (Cartan's \"repere mobile\"), or set of basis vectors eo\" e l \" e 2 \" e 3 , (subscript tells which vector, not which component of one vector!) Let the time axis be the time axis of a comoving inertial frame in which the observer is momentarily at rest. Thus the zeroth basis vector is identical with his 4-velocity: eo' = u. The space axes e 2 and e 3 are not affected by Lorentz transformations in the I-direction. Therefore take e 2 , and e3' to be the unit basis vectors of the all-encompassing Lorentz frame relative to which the hyperbolic motion of the observer has already been described in equations (6.5): e 2 , = e 2 ; e3' = e 3 • The remaining basis vector, e 1 \" orthogonal to the other three, is parallel to the acceleration vector, e 1 , = g-I a [see equation (6.4)]. There is a more satisfactory way to characterize this moving frame: the time axis eo' is the observer's 4-velocity, so he is always at rest in this frame; and the Natural coordinates inconsistent at distance I > (acceleration)-l Orthonormal tetrad of basis vectors carried by uniformly accelerated observer"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"y 170 6. ACCELERATED OBSERVERS other three vectors e l , are chosen in such a way as to be (l) orthogonal and (2) nonrotating. These basis vectors are: (eoY' = (cosh gr; sinh gr, 0, 0); (el,)1' = (sinh g7; cosh gr, 0, 0); (e 2 ,)1' = (0; 0, 1, 0); (e 3 .)1l = (0; 0, 0, 1). (6.6) There is a simple prescription to obtain these four basis vectors. Take the four basis vectors eo, e 1 , e 2 , e 3 of the original global Lorentz reference frame, and apply to them a simple boost in the I-direction, of such a magnitude that eO' comes into coincidence with the 4-velocity of the observer. The fact that these vectors are all orthogonal to each other and of unit magnitude is formally stated by the equation (6.7) Orthonormal tetrad of arbitrarily accelerated observer: should be \"nonrotating\" \"Nonrotating\" means rotation only in timelike plane of 4-velocity and 4-acceleration Mathematics of rotation in 3-space §6.5. THE TETRAD FERMI-WALKER TRANSPORTED BY AN OBSERVER WITH ARBITRARY ACCELERATION Turn now from an observer, or an object, in hyperbolic motion to one whose acceleration, always finite, varies arbitrarily with time. Here also we impose three criteria on the moving, infinitesimal reference frame, or tetrad: (1) the basis vectors el\" of the tetrad must remain orthonormal [equation (6.7)]~ (2) the basis vectors must form a rest frame for the observer at each instant (eo' = u); and (3) the tetrad should be \"nonrotating.\" This last criterion requires discussion. The basis vectors of the tetrad at any proper time 7 must be related to the basis vectors eo, e 1 , e 2 , e 3 of some given inertial frame by a Lorentz transformation el',(7) = Ap 1\"(7)e p . Therefore the basis vectors at two successive instants must also be related to each other by a Lorentz transformation. But a Lorentz transformation can be thought of as a \"rotation\" in spacetime. The 4-velocity u, always of unit magnitude, changes in direction. The very concept of acceleration therefore implies \"rotation\" of velocity 4-vector. How then is the re- quirement of \"no rotation\" to be interpreted? Demand that the tetrad el',(7) change from instant to instant by precisely that amount implied by the rate of change of u = eO', and by no additional arbitrary rotation. In other words, (1) accept the inevitable pseudorotation in the timelike plane defined by the velocity 4-vector and the acceleration, but (2) rule out any ordinary rotation of the three space vectors. Nonrelativistic physics describes the rotation of a vector (components Vi) by an instantaneous angular velocity vector (components Wi)' This angular velocity appears in the formula for the rate of change of v, (6.8) For the extension to four-dimensional spacetime, it is helpful to think of the rotation"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"as occurring in the plane perpendicular to the angular velocity vector \"'. Thus rewrite (6.8) as §6.5. FERMI-WALKER TRANSPORT 171 (6.9) where (6.10) has non-zero components only in the plane of the rotation. In other words, to speak of \"a rotation in the (1, 2)-plane\" is more useful than to speak of a rotation about the 3-axis. The concept of \"plane of rotation\" carries over to four dimensions. There a rotation in the (1,2)-plane will leave constant not only the va but also the V o component of the velocity. The four-dimensional definition of a rotation is Mathematics of rotation in spacetime with (6.11 ) To test the appropriateness of this definition of a generalized rotation or infinitesimal Lorentz transformation, verify that it leaves invariant the length of the 4-vector: (6.12) The last expression vanishes because gllv is antisymmetric, whereas vllV V is symme- tric. Note also that the antisymmetric tensor gllv (\"rotation matrix\"; \"infinitesimal Lorentz transformation\") has 4 X 3/2 = 6 independent components. This number agrees with the number of components in a finite Lorentz transformation (three parameters for rotations, plus three parameters for the components of a boost). The \"infinitesimal Lorentz transformation\" here must (1) generate the appropriate Lor- entz transformation in the timelike plane spanned by the 4-velocity and the 4-accel- eration, and (2) exclude a rotation in any other plane, in particular, in any spacelike plane. The unique answer to these requirements is i.e., a = a /\\ u. (6.13) Apply this rotation to a spacelike vector w orthogonal to u and a, (u· w = 0 and a· w = 0). Immediately compute gllv wv = O. Thus verify the absence of any space rotation. Now check the over-all normalization of gllv in equation (6.13). Apply the infinitesimal Lorentz transformation to the velocity 4-vector u of the observer. Thus insert Vil = u ll in (6.11). It then reads This result is an identity, since u· u = -1 and u· a = O.

Tetrad used to construct \"local coordinate system of accelerated observer\" The natural moving frame associated with an accelerated observer consists of four orthonormal vectors, each of which is Fermi- Walker transported along the world line and one of which is 80' = u (the 4-velocity of the observer). Fermi-Walker transport of the space basis vectors 8j' can be achieved in practice by attaching them to gyroscopes (see Box 6.2 and exercise 6.9). §6.6. THE LOCAL COORDINATE SYSTEM OF AN ACCELERATED OBSERVER Extend this moving frame or \"infinitesimal coordinate system\" to a \"local coordinate system\" covering a finite domain. Such local coordinates can escape none of the problems encountered in \"hyperbolic motion\" (Figure 6.1) and \"briefly accelerated motion\" (Figure 6.2). Therefore the local coordinate system has to be restricted to a region within a distance g-1 of the observer, where these problems do not arise. Figure 6.3 illustrates the construction of the local coordinates ~p.'. At any given proper time T the observer sits at a specific event :1'(T) along his world line. Let the displace- ment vector, from the origin of the original inertial frame to his position :1'(T), be Z(T). At :1'(T) the observer has three spacelike basis vectors 8 1 '(T), 8 2 '(T), 83'(T). The point :1'(T) plus those basis vectors define a spacelike hyperplane. The typical point of this hyperplane can be represented in the form x = ~1' 81'(T) + e 82'(T) + ~3'83'(T) + Z(T) = (separation vector from origin of original inertial frame). (6.15) Here the three numbers ~k' play the role of Euclidean coordinates in the hyperplane. This hyperplane advances as proper time unrolls.

ATTEMPTS TO INCORPORATE GRAVITY INTO SPECIAL RELATIVITY The discussion of special relativity so far has consistently assumed an absence of gravitational fields. Why must gravity be ignored in special relativity? This chapter describes the difficulties that gravitational fields cause in the foundations of special relativity. After meeting these difficulties, one can appreciate fully the curved-space- time methods that Einstein introduced to overcome them. Start, then, with what one already knows about gravity, Newton's formulation of its laws: d 2 x i /dt 2 = -af/J/ax i , V 2 f/J = 4'17Gp. (7.1 ) (7.2) This chapter is entirely Track 2. It depends on no preceding Track-2 material. It is not needed as preparation for arw later chapter, but will be helpful in Chapter 18 (weak gravitational fields). and in Chapters 38 and 39 (experimental tests and other theories of gravity). \\. These equations cannot be incorporated as they stand into special relativity. The equation of motion (7.1) for a particle is in three-dimensional rather than four-di- mensional form; it requires modification into a four-dimensional vector equation for d 2 xlJ./dT 2 • Likewise, the field equation (7.2) is not Lorentz-invariant, since the appearance of a three-dimensional Laplacian operator instead of a four-dimensional d'Alembertian operator means that the potential f/J responds instantaneously to changes in the density p at arbitrarily large distances away. In brief, Newtonian gravitational fields propagate with infinite velocity. One's first reaction to these problems might be to think that they are relatively straigh tforward to correct. Exercises at the end of this section study some relatively straightforward generalizations of these equations, in which the gravitational poten- tial f/J is taken to be first a scalar, then a vector, and finally a symmetric tensor field. Each of these theories has significant shortcomings. and all fail to agree with obser- vations. The best of them is the tensor theory (exercise 7.3, Box 7.1). which, however, Newton's gravitational laws must be modified into four-dimensional, geometric form All straightforward modifications are unsatisfactory"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"y 178 7. INCOMPATIBILITY OF GRAVITY AND SPECIAL RELATIVITY Best modification (tensor theory in flat spacetime) is internally inconsistent; when repaired, it becomes general relativity. EXERCISES is internally inconsistent and admits no exact solutions. This difficulty has been attacked in recent times by Gupta (1954, 1957, 1962), Kraichnan (1955), Thirring (1961), Feynman (1963), Weinberg (1965), Deser (1970). They show how the flat- space tensor theory may be modified within the spirit of present-day relativistic field theory to overcome these inconsistencies. By this field-theory route (part 5 of Box 17.2), they arrive uniquely at standard 1915 general relativity. Only at this end point does one finally recognize, from the mathematical form of the equations, that what ostensibly started out as a flat-space theory of gravity is really Einstein's theory, with gravitation being a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime. This book follows Einstein's line of reasoning because it keeps the physics to the fore. EXERCISES ON FLAT·SPACETIME THEORIES OF GRAVITY The following three exercises provide a solid challenge. Happily, all three require similar techniques, and a solution to the most difficult one (exercise 7.3) is presented in Box 7.1. Therefore, it is reasonable to proceed as follows. (a) Work either exercise 7.1 (scalar theory of gravity) or 7.2 (vector theory of gravity), skimming exercise 7.3 and Box 7.1 (tensor theory of gravity) for outline and method, not for detail, whenever difficulties arise. (b) Become familiar with the results of the other exercise (7.2 or 7.1) by discussing it with someone who has worked it in detail. (c) Read in detail the solution to exercise 7.3 as presented in Box 7.1, and compare with the computed results for the other two theories.

Straightforward steps to repair this inconsistency in the theory lead inexorably to general relativity (see Box 17.2 part 5). Having adopted general relativity as the theory of gravity, one can then use the present flat-spacetime theory as an approximation to it (\"Linearized general relativity\"; treated in Chapters 18, 19, and 35; see especially discussion at end of§18.3)."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"§7.2. RED SHIFT FROM ENERGY CONSERVATION §7.2. GRAVITATIONAL RED SHIFT DERIVED FROM ENERGY CONSERVATION 187 Einstein argued against the existence of any ideal, straight-line reference system such as is assumed in Newtonian theory. He emphasized that nothing in a natural state of motion, not even a photon, could ever give evidence for the existence or location of such ideal straight lines. That a photon must be affected by a gravitational field Einstein (1911) showed Gravitational redshift derived from the law of conservation of energy, applied in the context of Newtonian gravita- from energy considerations tion theory. Let a particle of rest mass m start from rest in a gravitational field g at point d and fall freely for a distance h to point qJ. It gains kinetic energy mgh. Its total energy, including rest mass, becomes m + mgh. (7.18) Now let the particle undergo an annihilation at qJ, converting its total rest mass plus kinetic energy into a photon of the same total energy. Let this photon travel upward in the gravitational field to d. If it does not interact with gravity, it will have its original energy on arrival at d. At this point it could be converted by a suitable apparatus into another particle of rest mass m (which could then repeat the whole process) plus an eXCess energy mgh that costs nothing to produce. To avoid this contradiction of the principal of conservation of energy, which can also be stated in purely classical terms, Einstein saw that the photon must suffer a red shift. The energy of the photon must decrease just as that of a particle does when it climbs out of the gravitational field. The photon energy at the top and the bottom of its path through the gravitational field must therefore be related by (7.19) The drop in energy because of work done against gravitation implies a drop in frequency and an increase in wavelength (red shift; traditionally stated in terms of a red shift parameter, Z = &/A); thus, 1 + Z = ~ = hVbottom = Ebottom = 1 + gh.

The paths y\" and Y2 must be exactly congruent, whether sloped at 45° (left) or having variable slope (right). Whereas Einstein's argument (last section) was formulated in Newtonian theory, Schild's is formulated in special relativity. It analyzes gravitational redshift experi- ments in the field of the Earth, using a global Lorentz frame tied to the Earth's center. It makes no demand that free particles initially at rest remain at rest in this global Lorentz frame (except far from the Earth, where gravity is negligible). On the contrary, it demands that free particles be accelerated relative to the Lorentz frame by the Earth's gravitational field. It is indifferent to the mathematical nature of that field (scalar, vector, tensor, ... ), but it does insist that the gravitational accelerations agree with experiment. And, of course, it de!Jlands that proper lengths and times be governed by the metric of special relativity. Schild's argument proceeds as follows. Consider one observer at rest on the Earth's surface at height Zl' and a second above the Earth's surface at height Z2 = Zl + h (Figure 7.1). The observers may verify that they are at rest relative to each other and relative to the Earth's Lorentz frame by, for instance, radar ranging to free particles that are at rest in the Earth's frame far outside its gravitational field. The bottom experimenter then emits an electromagnetic signal of a fixed standard frequency W b which is received by the observer on top. For definiteness, let the signal be a pulse exactly N cycles long. Then the interval of time* 8T bot required for the emission of the pulse is given by 2'T1N = W b 8T bot • The observer at the top is then to receive these same N cycles of the electromagnetic wave pulse and measure the time interval* 8T top required. By the definition of \"frequency,\" it satisfies 2'T1N = W t 8T top ' The redshift effect, established by experiment (for us) or by energy conserva- tion (for Einstein), shows W t < w b ; consequently the time intervals are different, 8T top > 8T bot • Transfer this information to the special-relativity spacetime diagram of the experiment (Figure 7.1).

One concludes that special relativity cannot be valid over any sufficiently extended region. Globally, spacetime, as probed by the tracks of light rays and test particles, departs from flatness (\"curva- ture\"; Parts III and IV of this book), despite the fine fit that Lorentz-Minkowski flatness gives to physics locally. Figure 7.1 ,B, repairs an oversimplification in this argument by recognizing that the propagation of light will be influenced by the gravitational field. Therefore photons might not follow straight lines in the diagram. Consequently, the world lines 11 and 12 of successive pulses are curves. However, the gravitational field is static and the experimenters do not move. Therefore nothing in the experimental setup changes with time. Whatever the path 11' the path 12 must be a congruent path of exactly the same shape, merely translated in time. On the basis of this congruence and the fact that the observers are moving on parallel world lines, one would again conclude, if flat Minkowski geometry were valid, that T bot = T top ' thus contradicting the observed redshift experiment. The experimenters do not need to understand the propagation oflight in a gravitational field. They need only use their radar apparatus to verify the fact that they are at rest relative to each other and relative to the source of the gravitational field. They know that, whatever influence the gravitational field has on their radar apparatus, it will not be a time-dependent influence. Moreover, they do not have to know how to compute their separation in order to verify that the separation remains constant. They only need to verify that the round-trip time required for radar pulses to go out to each other and back is the same every time they measure it. Schild's redshift argument does not reveal what kind of curvature must exist, or whether the curvature exists in the neighborhood of the observational equipment or some distance away from it. It does say, however, quite unambigously, that the flat spacetime of special relativity is inadequate to describe the situation, and it should therefore motivate one to undertake the mathematical analysis of curvature in Part III. §7.4. RED SHIFT AS EVIDENCE FOR EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE 189 This assumption is incompatible with gravitational redshift Conclusion: spacetime is curved §7.4. GRAVITATIONAL REDSHIFT AS EVIDENCE FOR THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUIVALENCE Einstein (1908, 1911) elevated the idea of the universality of gravitational interactions to the status of a fundamental principle of eqUivalence, that all effects of a uniform gravitational field are identical to the effects of a uniform acceleration of the coordinate system. This principle generalized a result of Newtonian gravitation theory, in which a uniform acceleration of the coordinate system in equation (7.1) gives rises to a Principle of equivalence: a uniform gravitational field is indistinguishable from a uniform acceleration of a reference frame"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"190 7. INCOMPATIBILITY OF GRAVITY AND SPECIAL RELATIVITY Gravitational redshift derived from equivalence principle Equivalence principle implies nonmeshing of local Lorentz frames near Earth (spacetime curvature!) supplementary uniform gravitational field. However, the Newtonian theory only gives this result for particle mechanics. Einstein's principle of equivalence asserts that a similar correspondence will hold for all the laws of physics, including Max- well's equations for the electromagnetic field. The rules ofthe game-the \"scientific method\" -req uire that experimental support be sought for any new theory or principle, and Einstein could treat the gravitational redshift as the equivalent of experimental confirmation of his principle of equival- ence. There are two steps in such a confirmation: first, the theory or principle must predict an effect (the next paragraph describes how the equivalence principle implies the redshift); second, the predicted effect must be observed. With the Pound-Rebka- Snider experiments, one is in much better shape today than Einstein was for this second step. Einstein himself had to rely on the experiments supporting the general concept of energy conservation, plus the necessity of a redshift to preserve energy conservation, as a substitute for direct experimental confirmation. The existence of the gravitational redshift can be deduced from the equivalence principle by considering two experimenters in a rocket ship that maintains a constant acceleration g. Let the distance between the two observers be h in the direction of the acceleration. Suppose for definiteness that the rocket ship was at rest in some inertial coordinate system when the bottom observer sent off a photon. It will require time t = h for the photon to reach the upper observer. In that time the top observer acquires a velocity v = gt = gh. He will therefore detect the photon and observe a Doppler redshift z = v = gh. The results here are therefore identical to equation (7.20). The principle of equivalence of course requires that, if this redshift is observed in an experiment performed under conditions of uniform acceleration in the absence of gravitational fields, then the same redshift must be observed by an experiment performed under conditions where there is a uniform gravitational field, but no acceleration. Consequently, by the principle of equivalence, one can derive equation (7.20) as applied to the gravitational situation. §7.5. LOCAL FLATNESS, GLOBAL CURVATURE The equivalence principle helps one to discern the nature of the spacetime curvature, whose existence was inferred from Schild's argument. Physics is the same in an accelerated frame as it is in a laboratory tied to the Earth's surface. Thus, an Earth-bound lab can be regarded as accelerating upward, with acceleration g, relative to the Lorentz frames in its neighborhood.* Equivalently, relative to the lab and the Earth's surface, all Lorentz frames must accelerate downward. But the downward (radial) direction is different at different latitudes and longitudes. Hence, local Lorentz frames, initially at rest with respect to each other but on opposite sides of the Earth, subsequently fall toward the center and go flying through each other. Clearly they cannot be meshed to form the single global Lorentz frame, tied to the *This upward acceleration of the laboratory, plus equation (6.18) for the line element in an accelerated coordinate system, explains the nonequality of the bottom and top edges of the parallelograms in Fig- ure 7.1. '"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Earth, that was assumed in Schild's argument. This nonmeshing of local Lorentz frames, like the non meshing of local Cartesian coordinates on a curved 2-surface, is a clear manifestation of spacetime curvature. Geographers have similar problems when mapping the surface of the earth. Over small areas, a township or a county, it is easy to use a standard rectangular coordinate system. However, when two fairly large regions are mapped, each with one coordi- nate axis pointing north, then one finds that the edges of the maps overlap each other best if placed at a slight angle (spacetime analog: relative velocity of two local Lorentz frames meeting at center of Earth). It is much easier to start from a picture of a spherical globe, and then talk about how small flat maps might be used as good approximations to parts of it, than to start with a huge collection of small maps and try to piece them together to build up a picture of the globe. The exposition of the geometry of spacetime in this book will therefore take the first approach. Now that one recognizes that the problem is to fit together local, flat spacetime descriptions of physics into an over-all view of the universe, one should be happy to jump, in the next chapter, into a broadscale study of geometry. From this more advantageous viewpoint, one can then face the problem of discussing the relationship between the local inertial coordinate systems appropriate to two nearby regions that have slightly different gravitational fields. There are actually two distinguishable ways in which geometry enters the theory of general relativity. One is the geometry of lengths and angles in four-dimensional spacetime, which is inherited from the metric structure ds 2 of special relativity. Schild's argument already shows (without a direct appeal to the equivalence princi- ple) that the special-relativistic ideas of length and angle must be modified. The modified ideas of metric structure lead to Riemannian geometry, which will be treated in Chapters 8 and 13. However, geometry also enters general relativity because of the equivalence principle. An equivalence principle can already be stated within Newtonian gravitational theory, in which no concepts of a spacetime metric enter, but only the Euclidean metric structure of three-dimensional space. The equivalence-principle view of Newtonian theory again insists that the local standard of reference be the freely falling particles. This requirement leads to the study of a spacetime geometry in which the curved world lines of freely falling particles are defined to be locally straight. They play the role in a curved spacetime geometry that straight lines play in flat spacetime. This \"affine geometry\" will be studied in Chapters 10-12. It leads to a quantitative formulation of the ideas of \"covariant derivative\" and \"curvature\" and even \"curvature of Newtonian spacetime\"! §7.5.

The central issue of this part of the book is clear: How can one quantify the \"separation,\" and the \"rate of change\" of \"separation, \"of two \"geodesics\" in \"curved\" spacetime? A clear, precise answer requires new concepts. \"Separation\" between geodesics will mean \"vector.\" But the concept of vector as employed in flat Lorentz spacetime (a bilocal object: point for head and point for tail) must be sharpened up into the local concept of tangent vector, when one passes to curved spacetime. Chapter 9 does the sharpening. It also reveals how the passage to curved spacetime affects I-forms and' tensors. It takes one tool (vectors in curved geometry, Chapter 9) to define \"separation\" clearly as a vector; it takes another tool (parallel transport in curved spacetime, Chapter 10) to compare separation vectors at neighboring points and to define the \"rate of change of separation.\" No transport, no comparison; no comparison, no meaning to the term \"rate of change\"!

That chapter uses geodesics to define parallel transport, uses parallel transport to define covariant derivative, and-completing the circle~uses covariant derivative to describe geo- desics. Chapter 11 faces up to the central issue: geodesic deviation (\"rate of change of separation vector between two geodesics\"), and its use in defining the curvature of spacetime. But to define curvature is not enough. The man who would understand gravity deeply must also see curvature at work, producing relative accelerations of particles in_ Newtonian spacetime (Chapter 12); he must learn how, in Einstein spacetime, distances (metric) determine completely the curvature and the law of parallel trans- port (Chapter 13); he must be the master of powerful tools for computing curvature (Chapter 14); and he must grasp the geometric significance of the algebraic and differential symmetries of curvature (Chapter 15). Unfortunately, such deep understanding requires time-far more time than one can afford in a ten-week or fifteen-week course, far more than a lone reader may wish to spend on first passage through the book. For the man who must rush on rapidly, this chapter contains a \"Track-I\" overview of the essential mathematical tools (§§8.4-8.7). From it one can gain an adequate, but not deep, understanding of spacetime curvature, of tidal gravitational forces, and of the mathematics of curved spacetime.

The ambitious reader may also wish to consult other introductions to differential geometry (see Box 8.1).

Bishop and Goldberg (1968) is the no. 1 reference. Hicks (1965) could be chosen as a current standard graduate-level text, with O'Neill (1966) at the undergraduate level intro- ducing many of the same topics without presuming that the reader finds easy and obvious the current style in which pure mathematicians think and write. Auslander and MacKenzie (1963) at a somewhat more advanced level also allow for the reader to whom differential equations are more familiar than homomorphisms. Willmore (1959) is easy to read but presents no challenge, and leads to little progress in adapting to the style of current mathematics. Trautman (1965) and Misner (1964a, 1969a) are introductions somewhat similar to ours, except for deemphasis of pictures; like ours, they are aimed at the student of relativity.

TRACK 1 VERSUS TRACK 2 §8.2. TRACK 1 VERSUS TRACK 2: DIFFERENCE IN OUTLOOK AND POWER 197 Nothing is more wonderful about the relation between Einstein's theory of gravity and Newton's theory than this, as discovered by Elie Cartan (1923,1924): that both theories lend themselves to des0iption in terms of curvature; that in both this curvature is governed by the density of mass-energy; and that this curvature allows itself to be defined and measured without any use of or reference to any concept of metric. The difference between the two theories shows itself up in this: Einstein's theory in the end (or in the beginning, depending upon how one presents it!) does define an interval between every event and every nearby event; Newton's theory not only does not, but even says that any attempt to talk of spacetime intervals violates Newton's laws. This being the case, Track 2 will forego for a time (Chapters 9-12) any use of a spacetime metric (\"Einstein interval\"). It will extract everything possible from a metric-free description of spacetime curvature (all of Newton's theory; important parts of Einstein's theory). Geodesic deviation is a measurer and definer of curvature, but the onlooker is forbidden to reduce a vector description of separation to a numerical measure of distance (no metric at this stage of the analysis): what an impossible situation! Nevertheless, that is exactly the situation with which Chapters 9-12 will concern themselves: how to do geometry without a metric. Speaking physically, one will overlook at this stage the fact that the geometry of the physical world is always and everywhere locally Lorentz, and endowed with a light cone, but one will exploit to the fullest the Galileo-Einstein principle of equivalence: in any given locality one can find a frame of reference in which every neutral test particle, whatever its velocity, is free of acceleration. The tracks of these neutral test particles define the geodesics of the geometry. These geodesics provide tools with which one can do much: define parallel transport (Chapter 10), define covariant derivative (Chapter 10), quantify geodesic deviation (Chapter 11), define spacetime curvature (Chapter 11), and explore Newtonian gravity (Chapter 12). Only after this full exploitation of metric-free geodesics will Track 2 admit the Einstein metric back into the scene (Chapters 13-15). But to forego use of the metric is a luxury which Track 1 can ill afford; too little time would be left for relativistic stars, cosmology, black holes, gravitational waves, experimental tests, and the dynamics of geometry. Therefore, the Track-l overview in this chapter keeps the Einstein metric throughout. But in doing so, it pays a heavy price: (1) no possibility of seeing curvature at work in Newtonian spacetime (Chapter 12); (2) no possibility of comparing and contrasting the geometric structures of Newtonian spacetime (Chapter 12) and Einstein spacetime (Chapter 13), and hence no possibility of grasping fully the Newtonian-based motivation for the Einstein field equations (Chapter 17); (3) no possibility of understanding fulry the mathematical interrelationships of \"geodesic,\" \"parallel transport,\" \"covariant derivative,\" \"cur- vature,\" and \"metric\" (Chapters 9,10,11,13); (4) no possibility of introducing the mathematical subjects \"differential topology\" (geometry without metric or covariant Preview of Track-2 differential geometry What the Track-l reader will miss"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"198 8.

At the age of32 he invented the exterior derivative [Cartan (1901)], which he used then mostly in differential equations and the theory of Lie groups, where he had al- ready made significant contributions. He was about fifty when he began applying it to geometry, and sixty before Riemannian geometry specifically was the object of this research, including his text [Cartan (1928)], which is still reprinted and worth studying. Although universally recognized, his work did not find responsive readers until he neared retirement around 1940, when the \"Bour- baki\" generation of French mathematicians began to provide a conceptual framework for (among other things) Cartan's insights and methods. This made Cartan communicable and teachable as his own writings never were, so that by the time of his death at 82 in 1951 his influence was obviously dominating the revolutions then in full swing in all the fields (Lie groups, differential equations, and differential geometry) in which he had prim- arily worked.

Of course, the unwritten rule of transport is: hold all lengths and directions fix~d while moving; i.e., hold all Lorentz-frame components fixed; i.e., \"parallel-transport\" the object.

Thus, in curved spacetime one must not blithely move a geometric object from point to point, without carefully specifying how it is to be moved and by what route. Each local geometric object has its own official place of residence (event ':fo); it can interact with other 05jects residing there (tensor algebra); but it cannot interact with any object at another event 2, until it has been carefully transported from ':fo to 2. This line of reasoning, pursued further, leads one to speak of the \"tangent space\" at each event, in which that event's vectors (arrows) and I-forms (families of surfaces) lie, and in which its tensors (linear machines) operate. One even draws heuristic pictures of the tangent space, as in Figure 9.1 (p. 231). Another danger in curved spacetime is the temptation to regard vectors as arrows linking two events (\"point for head and point for tail\")-Le., to regard the tangent space of Figure 9.1 as lying in spacetime itself. This practice can be useful for heuristic purposes, but it is incompatible with complete mathematical precision. (How is the tangent space to be molded into a warped surface?) Four definitions of a vector were given in Figure 2.1 (page 49): three definitions relying on \"point for head and point for tail\"; one, \"d':f / d\"A.\", purely local. Only the local definition is wholly viable in curved spacetime, and even it can be improved upon, in the eyes of mathematicians, as follows. There is a one-to-one correspondence (complete \"isomorphism\") between vectors u and directional derivative operators au' The concept of vector is a bit fuzzy, but \"directional derivative\" is perfectly well-defined.

Similarly, the vehicle between flat spacetime and curved spacetime is the equivalence principle: \"The laws of physics are the same in any local Lorentz frame of curved spacetime as in a global Lorentz frame of flat space- time.\" But to apply the equiv~lence principle, one must first have a mathematical representation of a local Lorentz frame.

DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY: AN OVERVIEW Parallel transport defined Covariant derivative defined An observer in a local Lorentz frame in curved spacetime can compare vectors and tensors at neighboring events, just as he would in flat spacetime. But to make the comparison, he must parallel-transport them to a common event. For him the act of parallel transport is simple: he keeps all Lorentz-frame components fixed, just as if he were in flat spacetime. But for a man without a local Lorentz frame- perhaps with no coordinate system or basis vectors at all-parallel transport is less trivial. He must either ask his Lorentz-based friend the result, or he must use a more sophisticated technique. One technique he can use-a \"Schild's ladder\" construction that requires no coordinates or basis vectors whatsoever-is described in §1O.2 and Box 10.2. But the Track-l reader need not master Schild's ladder. He can always ask a local Lorentz observer what the result of any given parallel transport iS,or he can use general formulas worked out below. Comparison by parallel transport is the foundation on which rests the gradient of a tensor field, VT. No mention of parallel transport was made in §3.5, where the gradient was first defined, but parallel transport occurred implicitly: one defined VTin such a way that its components were T\"'p,y = aT\"'plax Y [for Ta CD tensor]; i.e., one asked VT to measure how much the Lorentz-frame components of Tchange from point to point. But \"no change in Lorentz components\" would have meant \"parallel transport,\" so one was implicitly asking for the change in T relative to what T would have been after pure parallel transport. To codify in abstract notation this concept pf differentiation, proceed as follows. First define the \"covariant derivative\" V u T of T along a curve 9(;\\'), whose tangent vector is u = d9Id;\\.: ( V T) - Lim {T[9(e)]parallel-transportedto§'(01 - T[9(O)]} u at§'(OI - . ..... 0 e (8.16) Gradient defined (See Figure 8.2 for the special case where T is a vector field v.) Then define VT to be the linear machine, that gives V u T when u is inserted into its last slot: (8.17) The result is the same animal (\"gradient\") as was defined in §3.5 (for proof see exercise 8.8). But this alternative definition makes clear the relationship to parallel transport, including the fact that V u T = 0 --- T is parallel-transported along u = d9 I d;\\,. (8.18) Connection coefficients defined In a local Lorentz frame, the components of VT are directional derivatives of the components of T: TP \"',r Not so in a general basis. If {e p (9)} is a basis that varies arbitrarily but smoothly from point to point, and {w\"'(9)} is its dual basis, then VT = V(TP \",e p ® w\"') will contain contributions from Ve p and VW\"', as well as from VTP\", dTP\", = TP \"\"ywY.

The \"rT\" terms in equation (8.21) are the necessary corrections-one for each index of T. The pattern of these correction terms is easy to remember: (1) \"+\" sign if index being corrected is up, \"-\" sign if it is down; (2) differentiation index (y in above case) always at end of r; (3) index being corrected (f3 in first term, a in second) shifts from Tonto r and gets replaced on T by a dummy summation index (p.)."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"210 8.

By contrast, the abstract notation (VT, V u T, etc.) is poorly suited to complex calculations; but it possesses great conceptual power. This contrast shows clearly in the way the two notations handle the concept of geodesic. A geodesic of spacetime is a curve that is straight and uniformly parame- trized, as measured in each local Lorentz frame along its way. If the geodesic is timelike, then it is a possible world line for a freely falling particle, and its uniformly ticking parameter \"A. (called «affine parameter\") is a multiple of the particle's proper time;\"A. = aT + b. (Principle of equivalence: test particles move on straight lines in local Lorentz frames, and each particle's clock ticks at a uniform rate as measured by any Lorentz observer.) This definition of geodesic is readily translated into abstract, coordinate-free language: a geodesic is a curve 9(\"A.) that parallel-transports its tangent vector u = d9ld\"A. along itself- Geodesic and affine parameter defined (8.25) (See Figure 10.1.) What could be simpler conceptually? But to compute the geodesic, given an initial event 9 0 and initial tangent vector u(9o) there, one must use the component formalism.

It is easy because all the necessary geometric objects (event, curve, vector, I-form, tensor) are already familiar from flat spacetime. Yet it is also necessary, because one's viewpoint must be refined when one abandons the Lorentz metric of flat spacetime. Events The primitive concept of an event '3' (Figure 1.2) needs no refinement. The essential property here is identifiability, which is not dependent on the Lorentz metric struc- ture of spacetime.

It is needed as preparation for (1) Chapters 10-13 (differential geometry; Newtonian gravity). and (2) Box 30.1 (mixmaster cosmology).

A \"curve\" 9(A.) is also too primitive to care whether spacetime has a metric-except that, with metric gone, there is no concept of \"proper length\" along the curve. This is in accord with Newton's theory of gravity, where one talks of the lengths of curves in \"space,\" but never in \"spacetime.\" Vectors Here refinement is needed. In special relativity one could dress primitive (\"identifi- able\") events in enough algebraic plumage to talk of vectors as differences '3' - 2 between \"algebraic\" events. Now the plumage is gone, and the old bilocal (\"point for head and point for tail\") version of a vector must be replaced by a purely local version (§9.2). Also vectors cannot be moved around; each vector must be attached to a specific event (§§9.2 and 9.3). 1-Forms Almost no refinement needed, except that, with metric gone, there is no way to tell which I-form corresponds to a given vector (no way to raise and lower indices), and each I-form must be attached to a specific event (§9.4). Tensors Again almost no refinement, except that each slot of a tensor is specific: if it accepts vectors, then it cannot accommodate I-forms, and conversely (no raising and lower- ing of indices); also, each tensor must be attached to a specific event (§9.5). §9.2. \"VECTOR\" AND \"DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVE\" REFINED INTO TANGENT VECTOR Flat spacetime can accommodate several equivalent definitions of a vector (§2.3): a vector is an arrow reaching from an event '3'0 to an event 2 0 ; it is the parameterized straight line, '3'(A.) = '3'0 + A.(2 0 - '3'0) extending from '3'0 at A. = 0 to 2 0 at A. = I; it is the rate of change of the point '3'(A.) with increasing A., d'3' / dA.. With Lorentz metric gone, the \"arrow\" definition and the \"parametrized-straight line\" definition must break down. By what route is the arrow or line to be laid out between '3'0 and 2 0 1 There is no concept of straightness; all routes are equally straight or bent.

Instead, one visualizes d'3' I d\"A. as lying in a \"tan- gent plane\" or \"tangent space,\" which makes con- tact with spacetime only at '3'(0), the event where d'3' I d\"A. is evaluated. All other tangent vectors at '3'(O)-e.g., d'3'ldp, d'3'ldri, d'3'ld~-lie in this same tangent space. To make precise these concepts of tangent space and tangent vector,one may regard spacetime as embedded in a flat space of more than four di- mensions. One can then perform the limiting process that leads to d'3' I d\"A., using straight arrows in the flat embedding space. The result is a higher- dimensional analog of the figure shown above. But such a treatment is dangerous. It suggests, falsely, that the tangent vector d'3' Id\"A. and the tangent space at '3'0 depend on how the embedding is done, or depend for their existence on the em- bedding process. They do not.

It, under the new name \"tangent vector,\" is explored briefly in Box 9.1, and in greater depth in the following paragraphs. Even \"d'3' I d\"A.\" is a fuzzy definition of tangent vector, most mathematicians would argue. More acceptable, they suggest, is this definition: the tangent vector u to a curve '3'(\"A.) is the directional derivative operator along that curve u = au = (dld\"A.)a!ongcurve. (9.1) Best new definition: \"tangent vector equals directional derivative operator\" u = d/d\"A Tangent vector equals directional derivative operator? Preposterous!

The deficiency in this definition is that no meaning is assigned to steps I, 2, ... , N, ... , so there is nothing, yet, to take the limit of. To make each \"displacement of '3''' a definite mathematical object in a space where \"limit\" has a meaning, one can imagine the original manifold to be a low-dimensional surface in some much higher-dimensional flat space. Then '3'(11 N) - '3'(0) is just a straight arrow connect- ing two points, i.e. a segment of a straight line, which, in general, will not lie in the surface itself-see Box 9.1. The resulting mental picture of a tangent vector makes its essential properties beautifully clear, but at the cost of some artifacts. The picture relies on a specific but arbitrary way of embedding the manifold of interest (metric- free spacetime) in an extraneous flat space. In using this picture, one must ignore everything that depends on the peculiarities of the embedding. One must think like the chemist, who uses tinkertoy molecular models to visualize many essential prop- erties of a molecule clearly, but easily ignores artifacts of the model (colors of the atoms, diameters of the pegs, its tendency to collapse) that do not mimic quantum- mechanical reality. Elie Cartan's approach to differential geometry, including the d'3' I d\"A. idea of a tangent vector, suggests that he always thought of manifolds as embedded in flat spaces this way, and relied on insights that he did not always formalize to separate the essential geometry of these pictures from their embedding-dependent details. Acceptance of his methods of calculation came late. Mathematicians, who mistrusted their own ability to distinguish fact from artifact, exacted this price for acceptance: stop talking about the movement of the point itself, and start dealing only with concrete measurable changes that take place within the manifold, changes in any or all scalar functions f as the point moves. The limiting process then reads: O. Choose a curve '3'(\"A.) whose tangent vector at \"A. = 0 is desired. 1. Compute the number f['3'(1)] - f['3'(O)], which measures the change inf as the point '3'(\"A.) moves from '3'0 = '3'(0) to 2 0 = '3'(1). 2. Compute 2{f['3'(!)] - f['3'(O)]} , which is twice the change inf as the point goes from '3'(0) to '3'(!). N. Compute N{f['3'(1/N)]- f['3'(O)]} , which is N times the change infas the poin t goes from '3'(0) to '3'(1 IN)."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"00. Same in the limit as N ----+ 00: (change in f) = dfl dA. O. The vector is not itself the change inf It is instead the operation dldA, which, when applied to f, gives the change dfl dA. Thus tangent vector = dldA §9.2. TANGENT VECTOR AND DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVE 229 [cf. definition (9.1)]. The operation dldA clearly involves nothing but the last steps N ----+ 00 in this limiting process, and only those aspects of these steps that are independent of f But this means it involves the infinitesimal displacements of the point '3' and nothing more. One who wishes both to stay in touch with the present and to not abandon Cart an's deep geometric insight (Box 9.1) can seek to keep alive a distinction between: (A) the tangent vector itself in the sense of Cartan, the displacement d'3' IdA of a point; and (B) the \"tangent vector operator,\" or \"directional derivative operator,\" telling what happens to a function in this displacement: (tangent vector operator) = dldA. However, pres~nt practice drops (or, if one will, \"slurs\") the word \"operator\" in (B), and uses the phrase \"tangent vector\" itself for the operator, as will be the practice here from now on. The ideas (A) and (B) should also slur or coalesce in one's mind, so that when one visualizes an embedding diagram with arrows drawn tangent to the surface, one always realizes that the arrow characterizes an infinitesimal motion of a point d'3' IdA that takes place purely within the surface, and when one thinks of a derivative operator dldA, one always visualizes this same infinitesimal motion of a point in the manifold, a motion that must occur in constructing any derivative df('3')ldA. In this sense, one should regard a vector d'3' IdA dldA as both \"a displacement that carries attention from one point to another\" and \"a purely geo- metric object built on points and nothing but points.\" The hard-nosed physicist may still be inclined to say \"Tangent vector equals directional derivative operator? Preposterous!\" Perhaps he will be put at ease by another argument. He is asked to pick an event '3'0' At that event he chooses any set of four noncoplanar vectors (vectors defined in whatever way seems reasonable to him); he names them eo, e 1 , e 2 , e 3 ; and he uses them as a basis on which to expand all other vectors at '3'0: (9.2) He is asked to construct the four directional derivative operators 0a oSo along his four basis vectors.

So how can the hard-nosed physicist deny the hard-nosed mathematician the right to identify completely each tangent vector with its direc- tional derivative? No harm is done; no answer to any computation can be affected. This isomorphism extends to the concept \"tangent space.\" Because linear relations (such as Ou = a Ow + b ov) among directional derivatives evaluated at one and the same point Po are meaningful and obey the usual addition and multiplication rules, these derivative operators form an abstract (but finite-dimensional) vector space called the tangent space at '3'0' In an embedding picture (Box 9.1) one uses these derivatives (as operators in the flat embedding space) to construct tangent vectors u = ou'!!' v = o.;f, in the form of straight arrows.

The kinetic energy is second order and the potential is zeroth order in the familiar Schrodinger equation. Only first-order operators are vectors.

(3) The pictorial representation of [u, v] (Box 9.2) reveals its fundamental role as a \"closer of curves\"-a role that will be important in Chapter II's analysis of curvature. Commutators find application in the distinction between a coordinate-induced basis, {e a } = {o jox a }, and a noncoordinate basis.

Rather, they are useful for (a) suggesting geometric relationships that were previously unsuspected and that one verifies subsequently by computation; (b) interpreting newly learned geometric results. . 2. This usual noncomputational role of pictures permits one to be sloppy in drawing them. No essential new insight was gained in part B over part A, when one carefully moved the tangent vectors into their respective tangent spaces, and permitted only curves to lie in spacetime. Moreover, the original picture (part A) was clearer because of its greater simplicity. 3. This motivates one to draw \"sloppy\" pictures, with tangent vectors lying in spacetime itself-so long as one keeps those tangent vectors short and occa- sionally checks the scaling of errors when the lengths of the vectors are halved."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Conversely, if one is given a field of basis vectors (\"frame field\") {eaW)}, but one does not know whether a coordinate system {xaW)} exists in which {e a } = {a /ox a }, one can find out by a simple test: calculate all (4 X 3)/2 = 6 commutators rea' e.e]; if they all vanish, then there exists such a coordinate system.

MANIFOLDS AND DIFFERENTIAL TOPOLOGY Spacetime is not the only arena in which the ideas of this chapter can be applied. Points, curves, vectors, I-forms, and tensors exist in any \"differentiable manifold.\""},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Their use to study differentiable manifolds constitutes a branch of mathematics called \"differential topology\"-hence the title of this chapter. The mathematician usually begins his development of differential topology by introducing some very primitive concepts, such as sets and topologies of sets, by building a fairly elaborate framework out of them, and by then using that framework to define the concept of a differentiable manifold. But most physicists are satisfied with a more fuzzy, intuitive definition of manifold: roughly speaking, an n-dimen- sional differentiable manifold is a set of \"points\" tied together continuously and differentiably, so that the points in any sufficiently small region can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with an open set of points of R\". [Rn is the number space of n dimensions, i.e., the space of ordered n-tuples (xl, x 2 , ••• ,x n ).] That corre- spondence furnishes a coordinate system for the neighborhood . . A few examples will convey the concept better than this definition. Elementary examples (Euclidean 3-spaces, the surface of a sphere) bring to mind too many geometric ideas from richer levels of geometry; so one is forced to contemplate something more complicated. Let R3 be a three-dimensional number space with the usual advanced-calculus ideas of continuity and differentiability. Points € of R3 are triples, € = (~1' ~2' ~3)' of real numbers. Let a ray '3' in R3 be any half-line from the origin consisting of all € of the form € = A7J for some fixed 7J i' 0 and for all positive real numbers A > O. (See Figure 9.3.) A good example of a differentiable manifold then is the set S2 of all distinct rays. If 1 is a real-valued function with a specific value 1('3') for any ray '3' [so one writes f S2 ----+ R: '3' ----+ 1('3')], it should be intuitively (or even demonstrably) clear that we can define what we mean by saying 1 is continuous or differentiable. In this sense S2 itself is continuous and differen- tiable. Thus S2 is a manifold, and the rays '3' are the points of S2. There are many other manifolds that differential topology finds indistinguishable from S2. The simplest is the two-dimensional spherical surface (2-sphere), which is the standard representation of S2; it is the set of points € of R3 satisfying (~1)2 + (~2)2 + (~3)2 = 1. Clearly a different point '3' of S2 (one ray in R3) intersects each point of this standard 2-sphere surface, and the correspondence is continuous and differentiable in either direction (ray to point; point to ray). The same is true for <:tny ellipsoidal surface in R3 enclosing the origin, and for any other surface enclosing the origin that has §9.7.

There is no way to imbed this surface smoothly in R3 so that a distinct ray tjJ E S2 intersects each of its points; there is no invertible and differentiable correspondence between T2 and S2. Another example of a manifold is the rotation group SO(3), whose points ':P are all the 3 X 3 orthogonal matrices of unit determinant, so ,:P = IIP;jll with '!JT'!J = I and det ~1~ = I. This is a three-dimensional space (one often uses the three Euler- angle parameters in computations), where differential ideas (e.g., angular velocity) are employed; hence, it is a manifold. So is the Lorentz group. The differentiability of a manifold (i.e., the possibility of defining differentiable functions on it) permits one to introduce coordinate systems locally, if not globally, and also curves, tangent spaces, tangent vectors, I-forms, and tensors, just as is done for spacetime. But the mere fact that a manifold is differentiable does not mean that such concepts as geodesics, parallel transport, curvature, metric, or length exist in it. These are additional layers of structure possessed by some manifolds, but not by all. Roughly speaking, every manifold has smoothness properties and topology, but without additional structure it is shapeless and sizeless. That branch of mathematics which adds geodesics, parallel transport, and curva- ture (shape) to a manifold is called affine geometry; that branch which adds a metric is called Riemannian geometry. They will be studied in the next few chapters. EXERCISES ON THE ROTATION GROUP As the exposition of differential geometry becomes more and more sophisticated in the following chapters, the exercises will return time and again to the rotation group as an example of a manifold. Then, in Box 30.1, the results developed in these exercises will be used to analyze the \"Mixmaster universe,\" which is a particularly important cosmological solution to Einstein's field equation. Before working these exercises, the reader may wish to review the EUler-angie parametri- zation for rotation matrices, as treated, e.g., on pp. 107-109 of Goldstein (1959). Exercise 9.13.

Picture spacetime as filled with free-fall trajectories. Pick an event. Pick a velocity there. They determine a unique trajectory. Be more precise. Ask for the maximum amount of information tied up in each trajectory. Is it merely the sequence of points along which the test body falls? No; there is more. Each test body can carry a clock with itself (same kind of clock-\"good\" clock in sense of Figure 1.9-regardless of structure or composition of test body). The clock ticks as the body moves, labeling each event on its trajectory with a number: the time A the body was there. Result: the free-fall trajectory is not just a sequence of points; it is a parametrized sequence, a \"curve\" !7'(A). But is the parametrization unique? Not entirely. Quite arbitrary are (1) the choice of time origin, !7'(O); and (2) the units (centimeters, seconds, furlongs, ... ) in which clock time A is measured. Hence, A is unique only up to linear transformations Anew = aA 01d + b; (10.1)"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"§10.2. PICTORIAL APPROACH A==5 A==4 A=3 A=2 A = 1 A=O 245 Figure 10.1. .

Construct the unique geodesic P(A) that (I) passes through Po: P(O) = Po; and (2) has u as its tangent vector there: (dP /dAh.=o = u. This geodesic can be viewed as a rule for picking up u from P(O) and laying it down again at its tip, P(I), in as straight a manner as possible, U.=l = (dP/ dA h.=l; and for then picking it up and laying it down as straight as possible again at P(2), U.=2 = (dP /dAh.:2; etc. This sequence of \"straight as possible,\" \"taiI-on-tip\" transports gives meaning to the idea that (dP /dAh.=17 and u = (dP /dAh.=o are \"the same vector\" at different points along the geodesic; or, equivalently. that one has been obtained from the other by \"straight-on parallel transport.\" b (\"new origin of clock time\") is a number independent of location on this specific free-fall trajectory, and a (\"ratio of new units to old\") is also. In the curved spacetime of Einstein (and in that of Cartan-Newton, Chapter 12), these parametrized free-fall trajectories are the straightest of all possible curves. Consequently, one gives these trajectories the same name, \"geodesics,\" that mathe- maticians use for the straight lines of a, curved manifold; and like the mathematicians, one uses the name \"afftrze parameter\" for the parameter A along a free-fall geodesic. Equation (10.1) then says \"the affine parameter of a geodesic is unique up to linear transformations.\" The affine parameter (\"clock time\") along a geodesic has nothing to do, it priori, with any pletric. It exists even in the absence of metric (e.g., in Cartan-Newtonian spacetime). It gives one a method for comparing the separation between events on a geodesic (~ and (J are \"twice as far apart\" as ~ and !?2 if [A r ;; - Ad 1 = 2[A qz - A;:? D. But the affine parameter measures relative separations only along its own geodesic. It has no means of reaching off the geodesic.

Comparison of vectors at different events by parallel transport Consider two neighboring events (1 and &3 connected by a curve g'(A). A vector va lies in the tangent space at (1, and a vector V,il lies in the tangent space at &3. How can one say whether va and V!il are parallel, and how can one compare their lengths? The equivalence principle gives an answer: an observer travels (using rocket power as necessary) through spacetime along the world line g'(A). He carries the vector va with himself as he moves, and he uses flat-space Newtonian or Minkows- kian standards to keep it always unchanging (flat-space physics is valid locally"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"§ 1 0.2, PICTORIAL APPROACH 247 according to the equivalence principle!). On reaching event ~ the observer compares his \"parallel-transported vector\" v (/ with the vector v ll . If they are identical, then the original vector vd was (by definition) parallel to v~ll' and they had the same length. (No metric means no way to quantify length; nevertheless, parallel transport gives a way to compare length!) The equivalence principle entered this discussion in a perhaps unfamiliar way, applied to an observer who may be accelerated, rather than to one who is freely falling. But one cannot evade a basic principle by merely confronting it with an intricate application. (Ingenious perpetual-motion machines are as impossible as simpleminded ones!) The equivalence principle states that no local measurement that is insensitive to gravitational tidal forces can detect any difference whatsoever between flat and curved spacetime. The spaceship navigator has an inertial guidance system (accelerometers, gyroscopes, computers) capable of preserving an inertial reference frame in flat spacetime; and in flat spacetime it can compute the attitude and velocity of any object in the spaceship relative to a given inertial frame. The purchaser may specify whether he wants a guidance computer programmed with the laws of zero-gravity Newtonian mechanics, or with those of special-relativity physics. Use this same guidance system-including the same computer program-in curved spacetime. A vector is being parallel transported if the guidance system's computer says it is not changing. Will the result of transport in this way be independent of the curve used to link (J and ~i3? Clearly yes, in gravity-free spacetime, since this is a principal performance criterion that the purchaser of an inertial guidance system can demand of the manufacturer. But in a curved spacetime, the answer is \"NO!\" If v d agrees with V\"l after parallel transport along one curve, it need not agree with v~ after parallel transport along another. Spacetime curvature produces discrepancies. But one is not ready to study and quantify those discrepancies (Chapter 11), until one has developed the mathematical formalism of parallel transport, which, in turn, cannot be done until one has made precise the \"flat-space standards for keeping the vector Vii always unchanging\" as it is transported along a curve. The flat-space standards are made precise in Box 10.2. They lead to (1) a \"Schild's ladder\" construction for performing parallel transport; (2) the concept \"covariant derivative,\" Vuv, of a vector field v along a curve with tangent u; (3) the \"equation of motion\" Vuu = 0 for a geodesic, which states that \"a geodesic parallel transports its own tangent vector along itself;\" and (4) a link between the tangent spaces at adjacent events (Figure 10.2). §10.3.

PARALLEL TRANSPORT AND COVARIANT DERIVATIVE: COMPONENT APPROACH The pictorial approach motivates the mathematics; the abstract approach makes the pictorial ideas precise; but usually one must use the component approach in order to actually do complex calculations. To work with components, one needs a set of basis vectors {e a } and the dual set of basis I-forms {w a }. In flat spacetime a single such basis suffices; all events can use the same Lorentz basis. Not so in curved spacetime! There each event has its own tangent space, and each tangent space requires a basis of its own. As one travels from event to event, comparing their bases via parallel transport, one sees the bases twist and turn. They must do so. In no other way can they accommodate themselves to the curvature of spacetime. Bases at points '3'0 and '3'1' which are the same when compared by parallel transport along one curve, must differ when compared along another curve (see \"Curvature\"; Chapter 11). To quantify the twisting and turning of a \"field\" of basis vectors {e a ('3')} and forms {w a ('3')}, use the covariant derivative. Examine the changes in vector fields along a basis vector e/3' abbreviating (def of V/3); (10.12) and especially examine the rate of change of some basis vector: V /3e a • This rate of change is itself a vector, so it can be expanded in terms of the basis:"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"§ 10.4.

Because the basis I-forms are \"locked into\" the basis vectors «W V , e a ) = oVa)' these same connection coefficients r V at3 tell how the I-form basis changes from point to point: V/3W V = -Fv a /3w a , (V/3w v , e a ) = -Fv a /3' (10.15) (10.16) (See exercise 10.8.) The connection coefficients do even more. They allow one to calculate the compo- nents of the gradient of an arbitrary tensor S. In a Lorentz frame of flat spacetime, the components of V S are obtained by letting the basis vectors e a = 0'3' jox a = ojox a act on the components of S. Thus for a m tensor field S one finds that VS has components sa/3y,8 = O~8 [sa/3Y]' Not so in curved spacetime, or even in a non-Lorentz basis in flat spacetime. There the basis vectors tum, twist, expand, and contract, so even if S were constant (VS = 0), its components on the twisting basis vectors would vary. The connection coefficients, properly applied, will compensate for this twisting and turning.

ROTATION GROUP: GEODESICS AND CONNECTION COEFFICIENTS [Continuation of exercises 9.13 and 9.14.] In discussing the rotation group, one must make a clear distinction between the Euclidean space (coordin_ates x,y, z; basis vectors a/ax, a/ay, a/az) in which the rotation matrices act. and the group manifold 50(3) (coordinates l/;, 0, ep; coordinate basis a/al/;, 0/00, 2/a¢; basis of \"generators\" e 1 , e 2 , e 3 ), whose points Pare rotation matrices. (a) Pick a vector n = n\" a/ax + n Y a/ay + n Z a/az in Euclidean space. Show that ( 10.29) is a rotation matrix that rotates the axes of Euclidean space by an angle about the direction n. (::r j are matrices defined in exercise 9.13.) (b) In the group manifold 50(3), pick a point (rotation matrix) P, and pick a tangent vector u = u\"e\" at P. Let u be a vector in Euclidean space with the same components as u has in 50(3): u = u 1 a/ax + u 2 a/ay + u 3 a/oz. (10.30) Show that u is the tangent vector (at t = 0) to the curve ( 10.31) The curve e(t) through the arbitrary point P with arbitrary tangent vector u = (de /dt)t = 0 is a very special curve: every point on it differs from P by a -rotation tJlu(t) about one and the same direction u. No other curve in 50(3) with \"starting conditions\" {P, u} has such beautiful simplicity. Hence it is natural to decree that each such e(t) is a geodesic of the group manifold 50(3). This decree adds new geometric structure to 50(3); it converts 50(3) from a differentiable manifold into something more special: an affine manifold. One has no guarantee that an arbitrarily chosen family of curves in an arbitrary manifold can be decreed to be geodesics. Most families of curves simply do not possess the right geometric properties to function as geodesics. Most will lead to covariant derivatives that violate one or more of the fundamental conditions (10.2). To learn whether a given choice of geodesics is possible, one can try to derive connection coefficients r\"/3Y (for some given basis) corresponding to the chosen geodesics. If the derivation is successful, the choice of geodesics was a possible one. If the derivation produces inconsistencies, the chosen family of curves have the wrong geometric properties to function as geodesics.

CURVATURE, AT LAST! Spacetime curvature manifests itself as gravitation, by means of the deviation of one geodesic from a nearby geodesic (relative acceleration of test particles). Let the geodesics of spacetime be known. Then the covariant derivative V and its connection coefficients r a /3y are also known. How, from this information, does one define, calculate, and understand geodesic deviation and spacetime curvature? The answer unfolds in this chapter, and is summarized in Box 11.1. To disclose the answer one must (l) define the \"relative acceleration vector\" V u Vun, which meas- ures the deviation of one geodesic from another (§ 11.2); (2) derive an expression in terms of V or r a /3Y for the \"Riemann curvature tensor,\" which produces the geodesic deviation (§ 11.3); (3) see Riemann curvature at work, producing changes in vectors that are parallel transported around closed circuits (§ 11.4); (4) see Riemann curvature test whether spacetime is flat (§ 11.5); and (5) construct a special coordinate system, \"Riemann normal coordinates,\" which is tied in a special way to the Riemann curvature tensor (§ 11.6). §11.2.

Thereby arrive at the remarkable equation \"relative I acceleration\", \"tide-producing , wavitational forces\", Tide-producing gravitational (11.6) forces expressed in terms of a commutator This equation is remarkable, because at first sight it seems crazy. The term [V n , Vu]u involves second derivatives of u, and a first derivative of V n : (11.7) It thus must depend on how u and n vary from point to point. But the relative acceleration it produces, V u Vun, is known to depend only on the values of u and n at the fiducial point, not on how u and n vary (see Box 11.2, F). How is this possible? Somehow all derivatives must drop out of the tidal-force quantity [V n , Vu]u. One must be able to regard ['V. .. , 'V. .. ]... as a purely local, algebraic machine with three slots, whose output is a vector. If it is purely local and not differential, then it is even linear (as one sees from the additivity properties of V), so it must be a tensor. Give this tensor the name Riemann, and give it a fourth slot for inputting a I-form: Riemann (. .. , C,A, B) [VA' VB ]C; Riemann «(1, C,A, B) «(1, [VA, VB ]C). This is only a tentative definition of Riemann. Before accepting it, one should verify that it is, indeed, a tensor. Does it really depend on only the values of A, B, C at the point of evaluation, and not on how they are changing there? The answer (derived in Box 11.5) is \"almost.\" It fails the test, but with a slight modification it will pass. The modification is to replace the commutator [VA, VB] by the \"curvature Curvature operator defined operator\" (11.8) where V[A,Bl is the derivative along the vector [A, B] (commutator of A and B).

PARALLEL TRANSPORT AROUND A CLOSED CURVE What are the effects of spacetime curvature, and how can one quantify them? One effect is geodesic deviation (relative acceleration of test bodies), quantified by equa- tion (11.10). Another effect, almost as important, is the change in a vector caused by parallel transport around a closed curve. This effect shows up most clearly in the same problem, geodesic deviation, that motivated curvature in the first place. The relative acceleration vector V u Vun is also the change 8u in the vector u caused by parallel transport around the curve whose legs are the vectors nand u: (See Box 11.6 for proof.) Hence, in this special case one can write 8u + Riemann ( ... , u, n, u) = O. Change in a vector due to parallel transport around a closed curve: Related to geodesic deviation The expected generalization is obvious: pick a closed quadrilateral with legs u ..1a and v..1b (Figure 11.2; ..1a and ..1b are small parameters, to go to zero at end of discussion). Parallel transport the vector A around this quadrilateral. The resultant change in A should satisfy the equation 8A + Riemann ( ... ,A, u ..1a, v ..1b) = 0; (11.14) Equation for change or, equivalently, 8A + ..1a..1b tJl(u, v)A = 0; or, more precisely, Lim ( 8A b) + Riemann ( ... ,A, u, v) = O. .1a_O ..1a..1 .1b-O (11.14') (11.14\") The proof is enlightening, for it reveals the geometric origin of the correction term V[u.vl in the curvature operator. The circuit of transport (Figure 11.2) is to be made from two arbitrary vector fields u ..1a and v ..1b. However, a circuit made only of these fields has a gap in it, for a simple reason.

From the vanishing of the quantities on the left, one concludes that all the connection coefficients on the right (\"bending of geodesics\") must be zero; so spacetime is indeed flat. Summary: Spacetime is flat -i.e., there exist \"flat coordinates\" in which r I-' a/3 = 0 everywhere and geodesics are straight lines, xa(i\\) = an + bai\\-if and only if Riemann = O.

Warning: Flatness does not necessarily imply Euclidean topology. Take a sheet of paper. It is flat. Roll it up into a cylinder. It is still flat, intrinsically. The tracks of geodesics over it have not changed. Distances between neighboring points have not changed. Only the topology has changed, so far as an observer confined forever to the sheet is concerned.

See, instead §21.5.) Take this cylinder. Bend it around and glue its two ends together, without changing its flat intrinsic geometry. Doing so is impossible if the cylinder remains embedded in flat, three-dimensional Euclidean space; perfectly possible if it is embedded in a Euclidean space of 4 dimensions. However, embedding is unimportant to observers confined to the cylinder, since all they ever measure is intrinsic geometry; so all that matters to them is the topological identification of the two ends of the cylinder with each other. The result is topologically a torus; but the tracks of geodesics are still unchanged; the intrinsic geometry is flat; Riemann vanishes. By analogy, take flat Minkowskii spacetime. Pick some'Lorentz frame, and in it pick a cube 10 10 light years on each side (0 < x < 10 10 light years; similarly for y and z). Identify opposite faces of the cube so that a geodesic exiting across one face enters across the other. The result is topologically a three-torus: a \"closed universe\" with finite volume, with flat, Minkowskii geometry, and with a form that changes not at all as Lorentz time t passes (no expansion, no contraction)."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"§ 11.6. RIEMANN NORMAL COORDINATES §11.6. RIEMANN NORMAL COORDINATES 285 In curved spacetime one can never find a coordinate system with r a /3y = 0 every- where. But one can always construct local inertial frames at a given event ?f 0; and as viewed in such frames, free particles must move along straight lines, at least locally-which means r a /3y must vanish, at least locally. A very special and useful realization of such a local inertial frame is a Riemann- normal coordinate system. Pick an event ?f 0 and a set of basis vectors {ea(?f o)} to be used there by an inertial observer. Fill spacetime, near?f 0' with geodesics radiating out from ?f 0 like the quills of a hedgehog or porcupine.

Return to the \"universal time\" t of earlier centuries. In terms of that universal time, and of rectangular, \"Galilean\" space coordinates, Newtonian theory gives for the trajectories of neutral test particles This chapter is entirely Track 2.

These curved paths include circular orbits about the Earth and the parabolic trajectory of a baseball. Cartan (1923, 1924) asks one to abandon this viewpoint. Instead, he says, regard these trajectories as geodesics [t(i\\), xi(i\\)] in curved spacetime. (This change of viewpoint was embodied in Figures Band C of Box 1.6.)

STRATIFICATION OF NEWTONIAN SPACETIME § 12.2. STRATIFICATION OF NEWTONIAN SPACETIME 291 Galileo and Newton spoke of a fiat, Euclidean \"absolute space\" and of an \"absolute time,\" two concepts distinct and unlinked. In absolute space Newtonian physics took place; and as it took place, absolute time marched on. No hint was there that space and time might be two aspects of a single entity, a curved \"spacetime\"-until Einstein made the unification in relativity physics, and Cartan (1923) followed suit in New- tonian physics in order to provide clearer insight into Einstein's ideas. How do the absolute space of Galileo and Newton, and their absolute time, fit into Cartan's \"Newtonian spacetime\"? The key to the fit is stratification; stratification produced by the universal time coordinate t. Regard t as a function (scalar field) defined once and for all in Newtonian space- time The geometry of Newtonian spacetime: \"Universal time\" as a scalar field t = t(!7'). (12.9) Without it, spacetime could not be Newtonian, for \"t\" is every bit as intrinsic to Newtonian spacetime as the metric \"g\" is to Lorentz spaceJime. The layers of spacetime are the slices of constant t-the \"space slices\"-each of which has an identical geometric structure: the old \"absolute space.\" Adopting Cartan's viewpoint, ask what kind of geometry is induced onto each space slice by the surrounding geometry of spacetime. A given space slice is endowed, by the Galilean coordinates of§12.l, with basis vectors e i = a/ax i ; and this basis has vanishing connection coefficients, r 4 ki = 0 [cf. equation (12.4)]. Consequently, the geometry of each space slice is completely flat. \"Absolute space\" is Euclidean in its geometry, according to the old viewpoint, and the Galilean coordinates are Cartesian. Translated into Cartan's language, this says: not only is each space slice (t = constant) fiat, and not only do its Galilean coordinates have vanishing connection coefficients, but also each space slice is en- dowed with a three-dimensional metric, and its Galilean coordinate basis is orthonormal, Space slices with Euclidean geometry (l2.l 0) If the space slices are really so fiat, where do curvature and geodesic deviation enter in? They are properties of spacetime. Parallel transport a vector around a closed curve lying entirely in a space slice; it will return to its starting point unchanged. But transport it forward in time by ..1t, northerly in space by ..1x k , back in time by - ..1t, and southerly by - ..1x k to its starting point; it will return changed by 8A = -fJl.(..1tl.- ..1x k _ a _. )A' at' ax\" ' i.e., Curvature acts in spacetime, not in space slices (12.11) Geodesics of a space slice (Euclid's straight lines) that are initially parallel remain"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"y 292 12.

GALILEAN COORDINATE SYSTEMS The Lorentz spacetime of special relativity has an existence and structure completely independent of any coordinate system.

(a /ax/3) = 1/,,/3 everywhere. By studying these special coordinate systems and the relationships between them (Lorentz transformations), one learns much about the structure of spacetime itself (breakdown in simultaneity; Lorentz contraction; time dilatation; ... ). Similarly for Newtonian spacetime. Special properties of its geometry (explored in abstract later; Box 12.4) permit the introduction of special coordinates (Galilean coordinates), which cling to spacetime in a special way XO(?f) = t( ?f); (a/ax i ).

NEWTONIAN GRAVITY IN LANGUAGE OF CURVED SPACETIME Point of principle: how can one write down the laws of gravity and properties of spacetime in Galilean coordinates first (§12.1), and only afterward (here) come to grip with the nature of the coordinate system and its nonuniqueness? Answer: (a quotation from §3.1, slightly modified): \"Here and elsewhere in science, as emphasized not least by Henri Poincare, that view is out of date which used to say 'Define your terms before you proceed.' All the laws and theories of physics, includ- ing Newton's laws of gravity, have this deep and subtle character, that they both define the concepts they use (here Galilean coordinates) and make statements about these concepts.\" The Newtonian laws of gravity, written in a Galilean coordinate system make the statement \"Fi oo = lP,i and all other Fa py = 0\" about the geometry of spacetime. This statement in turn gives information about the relationships between different Galilean systems. Let one Galilean system {xa(g')} be given, and seek the most general coordinate transformation leading to another, {xa'(g')}. The following constraints exist: (1) xO' = XO = t (both time coordinates must be universal time); (2) at fixed t (i.e., in a fixed space slice) both sets of space coordinates must be Euclidean, so they must be related by a rotation and a translation: x f = Aj'k Xk + at L ~translatiOn] rotation matrix, i.e., AflAk'l = <'lrk'] k ., k 'h k- j'- X = Aj'kX' - a ,wIt a =Aj'ka . (12.13a) (12.13b) The rotation and translation might, a priori, be different on different slices, Ark = Aj'k(t) and a i = ai(t); but (3) they must be constrained by the required special form of the connection coefficients.

THE GEOMETRIC VIEW OF PHYSICS: A CRITIQUE An important digression is in order. \"Every physical quantity must be describable by a (coordinate-free) geometric object, and the laws of physics must all be expressible as geometric relationships between these geometric objects.\" This view of physics, sometimes known as the \"principle of general covariance,\" pervades twentieth-century thinking. But does it have any forcible content? No, not at all, according to one viewpoint that dates back to Kretschmann (1917). Any physical theory originally written in a special coordinate system can be recast in geometric, coordinate-free language. Newtonian theory is a good example, with its equivalent geometric and standard formulations (Box 12.4). Hence, as a sieve for separating viable theories from nonviable theories, the principle of general covariance is useless. But another viewpoint is cogent. It constructs a powerful sieve in the form of a slightly altered and slightly more nebulous principle: \"Nature likes theories that are simple when stated in coordinate-free, geometric language.\"* According to this principle, Nature must love general relativity, and it must hate Newtonian theory. Of all theories ever conceived by physicists, general relativity has the simplest, most elegant geometric foundation [three axioms: (1) there is a metric; (2) the metric is governed by the Einstein field equation G = 8'lTT; (3) all special relativistic laws of physics are valid in local Lorentz frames of metric]. By contrast, what diabolically * Admittedly, this principle is anthropomorphic: twentieth-century physicists like such theories and even find them effective in correlating observational data.

This spacetime is curved. Gravitation is a manifestation of its curvature. So far, so good, in terms of Newton's theory of gravity as translated into geometric language by Cartan. What is absolutely unacceptable, however, is the further consequence of the Cartan-Newton viewpoint (Chapter 12): stratification of spacetime into slidable slices, with no meaning for the spacetime separation between an event in one slice and an event in another. Of all the foundations of physics, none is more firmly established than special relativity; and of all the lessons of special relativity none stand out with greater force than these. (I) Spacetime, far from being stratified, is homogeneous and isotropic throughout any region small enough (\"local region\") that gravitational tide-producing effects (\"spacetime curvatures\") are negligible. (2) No local experi- ment whatsoever can distinguish one local inertial frame from another. (3) The speed of light is the same in every local inertial frame. (4) It is not possible to give frame-independent meaning to the separation in time (\"no Newtonian strati fica-"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"§ 13.2. METRIC 305 tion\"). (5) Between every event and every nearby event there exists a frame- independent, coordinate-independent spacetime interval (\"Riemannian geometry\"). (6) Spacetime is always and everywhere locally Lorentz in character (\"local Lorentz character of this Riemannian geometry\"). What mathematics gives all these physical properties? A metric: a metric that is locally Lorentz (§§ 13.2 and 13.6). All else then follows. In particular, the metric destroys the stratified structure of Newtonian spacetime, as well as its gravitational potential and universal time coordinate. But not destroyed are the deepest features of Newtonian gravity: (1) the equivalence principle (as embodied in geodesic de- scription of free-fall motion, §§13.3 and 13.4); and (2) spacetime curvature (as measured by tidal effects, § 13.5). The skyscraper of vectors, forms, tensors (Chapter 9), geodesics, parallel transport, covariant derivative (Chapter 10), and curvature (Chapter 11) has rested on crum- bling foundations-Newtonian physics and a geodesic law based on Newtonian physics. But with metric now on the scene, the whole skyscraper can be transferred to new foundations without a crack appearing. Only one change is necessary: the geodesic law must be selected in a new, relativistic way; a way based on metric (§§ 13.3 and 13.4). Resting on metric foundations, spacetime curvature acquires additional and stronger properties (the skyscraper is redecorated and extended), which are studied in §13.5 and in Chapters 14 and 15, and which lead almost inexorably to Einstein's field equation. §13.2. METRIC A spacetime metric: a curved spacetime metric; a locally Lorentz, curved spacetime metric. This is the foundation of spacetime geometry in the real, physical world. Therefore take a moment to recall what \"metric\" is in three contrasting languages. In the language of elementary geometry, \"metric\" is a table giving the interval between every event and every other event (Box 13.1 and Figure 13.1). In the language of coordinates, \"metric\" is a set of ten functions of position, g/lv(x\"'), such that the expression Metric: the instrument which imposes the constraints Metric described in three languages (13.1 ) gives the interval between any event x'\" and any nearby event x'\" + Llx\"'.

CONCORD BETWEEN GEODESICS OF CURVED SPACETIME GEOMETRY AND STRAIGHT LINES OF LOCAL LORENTZ GEOMETRY More could be said about the mathematical machinery and physical implications of \"metric,\" but an issue of greater urgency presses for attention.

As a first method to spell out this consistency requirement,examine the two mathematical representations of the world line ofa test particle in the neighborhood of a given event tJ'0. The local-Lorentz representation says: \"Pick a local Lorentz frame at tJ' o. [As spelled out in exercise 13.3, such a local Lorentz frame is the closest thing there is to a global Lorentz frame at tJ' 0; i.e., it is a coordinate system in which Local-Lorentz description of straight lines gaP(tJ' 0) = 1I a p (flat-spacetime metric), gaP,y(tJ'O) = 0, gap,ya(tJ'o) ¥= 0 except in special cases, such as flat space.] The world line in that frame has zero acceleration, d 2 x a / dr 2 = 0 at tJ' 0 (\"straight-line equation\"), (13.15a) (13.15b) (13.15c) (13.16) where 7' is proper time as measured by the particle's clock.\" The geodesic representation says \"In the local Lorentz frame, as in any coordinate frame, the world line satisfies the geodesic equation Geodesic description of straight lines (13.17) (13.18) (7' is an affine parameter because it is time as measured by the test particle's clock).\" Consistency of the two representations for any and every choice of test particle (any and every choice of dx a / d7' at tJ' 0) demands rapy{tJ'o) = 0 in any local Lorentz frame [coordinate system satisfying equations (13.15) at tJ' 0]; Condition of consistency: r a py = 0 in local Lorentz frame i.e., it demands that everyJocal Lorentz frame is a local inertial frame. (On local inertial frames see § 11.6.) In such a frame, all local effects of \"gravitation\" disappear. That is the physical shorthand for (13.18). One does not have to speak in the language of a specific coordinate system when one demands identity between the geodesic (derived from the r a py ) and the straight line of the local Lorentz geometry (gp..)' The local Lorentz specialization of coordi- nates may be the most immediate way to see the physics (\"no local effects of gravitation\"), but it is not the right way to formulate the basic mathematical re- quirement in its full generality and power. The right way is to demand Vg = 0 (\"compatibility of 9 and V\"). (13.19) Consistency reformulated: Vg = O.

From Vg = 0, one can derive both the abstract chain rule (13.20) r a f3\"y expressed in terms of metric (Exercise 13.4) and the following equations for the connection coefficients in any frame in terms of (1) the metric coefficients, ga{3 = 8 a ' 8{3' and (2) the covariant commutation coefficients of that frame: r a {3y = gap. rp.{3y (definition of rp.{3Y)' 1 rp.{3y = \"2 (gp.{3,y + cp.{3y + gp.y,{3 + cp.y{3 - g{3Y,p. - c{3yp.) = ± (gp.{3,y + gp.y,{3 - g{3Y,p.) in any coordinate frame.

Equations (13.23) are the connection coefficients required to make the geodesics of curved spacetime coincide with the straight lines of the local Lorentz geometry. And they are fixed uniquely; no other choice of connection coefficients will do the job! Summary: in curved spacetime with a local Lorentz metric, the following seemingly different statements are actually equivalent: (1) the geodesics of curved spacetime coincide with the straight lines of the local Lorentz geometry; (2) every local Lorentz frame [coordinates with ga{3('3'o) = 1I a {3' ga{3,r<'3'o) = 0) is a local inertial frame [r a {3Y('3'o) = 0); (3) the metric and covariant derivative satisfy the compatibility condition Vg = 0; (4) the covariant derivative obeys the chain rule (13.20); (5) the connection coefficients are determined by the metric in the manner of equations (13.23). A sixth equivalent statement, derived in the next section, says (6) the geodesics of curved spacetime coincide with world lines of extremal proper time. Exercise 13.3.

GEODESICS AS WORLD LINES OF EXTREMAL PROPER TIME In a local Lorentz frame, it is easy to distinguish a world line that is straight from one that is not. Position the Lorentz frame and so orient it that the starting point of the world line, {f, lies at the origin and the end point, ~E, lies at x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, t = T As an example ofa nonstraight world line, consider passage at uniform velocity from {f to point tj' with coordinates (~T; 0, 0, ~R) and from there again with uniform velocity to point qa. The lapse of proper time from start to finish (\"length of world line\") is Thus the lapse of proper time is diminished from its straight-line value, and dimin- ished moreover for any choice of R whatsoever, except for the zero or straight-line value R = 0. As for this simple nonstraight curve, so also for any other nonstraight curve: the lapse of proper time between {f and £13 is less than the straight-line lapse (Exercise 6.3). Thus, in flat spacetime, extremal length of world line is an indicator of straightness. Any local region of the curved spacetime of the real, physical world is Lorentz in character. In this local Lorentz geometry, it is easy to set up Lorentz coordinates and carry out the extremal-length analysis just sketched to distinguish between a straight line and a nonstraight line: In flat spacetime. straight lines have extremal length Extremal length in curved spacetime 'N 'N 7' = f d7' = f' (-'I)p.v dxp. dx v )1/2 {/ {/ ( a maxim urn for straight line ) = as compared to any variant of . the straight line (13.24 )"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"y 316 13. RIEMANNIAN GEOMETRY: METRIC AS FOUNDATION OF ALL Such a test for straightness can be carried out separately in each local Lorentz region along the world line, or, with greater efficiency, it can be carried out over many local Lorentz regions simultaneously, i.e., over a region with endpoints {f and ~1j so widely separated that no single Lorentz frame can possibly contain them both. To carry out the analysis, one must abandon local Lorentz coordinates. Therefore introduce a general curvilinear coordinate system and find 'N '11 7' = J d7' = J (- gill' dx ll dX V )I/2 {/ {/ ( an extremum for timelike world line that ) is straight in each local Lorentz frame along its path, as compared to any \"nearby\" . variant of this world line (13.25) Proof that curves of extremal length are geodesics In the real world, the path of extremal 7', being straight in every local Lorentz frame, must be a geodesic of spacetime. Notice that the word \"maximum\" in equation (13.24) has been replaced by \"extremum\" in the statement (13.25). When {f and ('8 are widely separated, they may be connected by several different geodesics with differing lapses of proper time (Figure 13.2). Each timelike geodesic extremizes 7' with respect to nearby de- formations of itself, but the extremum need not be a maximum. When several distinct geodesics connect two events, the typical one is not a local maximum (\"moun- tain peak\") but a saddle point (\"mountain pass\") in such a diagram as Figure 13.2 or 13.3. Concord between locally straight lines (lines of extremal 7') and geodesics of curved spacetime demands that timelike geodesics have extremal proper length. If so, then any curve x ll (;\\) between {f (where ;\\ = 0) and qa (where ;\\ = 1) that extremizes 7' should satisfy the geodesic equation. To test for an extremal by comparing times, pick a curve suspected to be a geodesic, and deform it slightly but arbitrarily: original curve, xlJ. = alJ.(;\\); deformed curve, xlJ. = alJ.(;\\) + SalJ.(;\\).

Thus one arrives at the four conditions (13.32) for the determination of an extremal world line. (An alternative viewpoint on the extremization is spelled out in Figure 13.3.) Sufficient these four equations are, but independent they are not, by reason of a \"bead argument\" (automatic vanishing of 8T for any set of changes that merely slide points, like beads, along an existing world line). The operation of mere \"sliding of beads\" implies the trivial change (13.33) where h(A) is an arbitrary function of position along the world line (\"more sliding here than there\"). Already knowing that this operation cannot change T, one is guaranteed that the integrand in (13.30) must vanish when one inserts (13.33) for 8a u ; and must vanish, moreover, whatever choice is made for the arbitrary \"magni- tude of slide\" factor h(A). This requirement implies and demands that the scalar product fu da u I dA must automatically vanish; or, otherwise stated, (13.34) The argument applies, and this equation holds, whether one is or is not dealing with an optimal world line.

Details: In the context of general relativity, take an arbitrary world line that connects {/ and !ti, evaluate lapse of proper time, repeat for other world lines, and say that a given world line represents a possible motion (\"geodesic\") when for it the proper time is an extremum with respect to all nearby world lines. In the Newtonian approximation, the difference between the lapse of proper time and the lapse (tqj - til) of coordinate time is all that comes to attention, in the form of the \"action integral\" (on a \"per-unit-mass basis\") f = f?il [(kinetic) _ (potential)] d energy energy t d = fH(~r - IZI]dl (maximum, or other extremum, in the proper time implies minimum, or corresponding other extremum, in the action f). The integration gives f = (w Z ai;8) - (4IalI/17) + (wZa~/2) for lazl < ~ la 1 1 (one-excursion motions), and for lazl > ~ lall (two-excursion motions), f = (w Z ai;8) + (wZa~/2) - (4Ia z l/w) - (ar;wlazl). The one-excursion motion minimizes the action (maximizes the lapse of proper time). The two-excursion motion extremizes the action but does not minimize it (\"saddle point\"; \"mountain pass\" in the topogra- phy). Choquard (1955) gives other examples of problems of mechanics where there is more than one extremum.

THE PROPER REFERENCE FRAME OF AN ACCELERATED OBSERVER A physicist performing an experiment in a jet airplane (e.g., an infrared astronomy experiment) may use several different coordinate systems at once. But a coordinate system of special utility is one at rest relative to all the apparatus bolted into the floor and walls of the airplane cabin. This \"proper reference frame\" has a rectangular \"i, y, j\" grid attached to the walls of the cabin, and one or more clocks at rest in the grid. That this proper reference frame is accelerated relative to the local Lorentz frames, the physicist knows from his own failure to float freely in the cabin, or, with greater precision, from accelerometer measurements. That his proper refer- ence frame is rotating relative to local Lorentz frames he knows from the Corio lis forces he feels, or, with greater precision, from the rotation of inertial-guidance gyroscopes relative to the cabin walls. Exercise 6.8 gave a mathematical treatment of such an accelerated, rotating, but locally orthonormal reference frame in flat spacetime. This section does the same in curved spacetime. In the immediate vicinity of the spatial grid's origin xi = 0 (region of spatial extent so small that curvature effects are negligible), no aspect of the coordinate system can possibly reveal whether spacetime is curved or flat. Hence, all the details of exercise 6.8 must remain valid in curved spacetime. Never- theless, it is instructive to rediscuss those details, and some new ones, using the powerful mathematics of the last few chapters. Begin by making more precise the coordinate grid to be used. The following is perhaps the most natural way to set up the grid. (1) Let T be proper time as measured by the accelerated observer's clock (clock at center of airplane cabin in above example). Let '3' ::: '3' O(T) be the observer's world line, as shown in Figure 13.4,a.

In any such case, the appropriate method often is: curvature first, understanding second. Curvature is the simplest local measure of geometric properties (see Box 14.1). Curvature is therefore a good first step toward a more comprehensive picture of the spacetime in question. One sometimes has an expression for a spacetime metric first, and then makes calculations of curvature to understand it. But more often one makes calculations of curvature, subject to specified conditions of symmetry in space and time, as an aid in arriving at an expression for a physically interesting metric (stars, Chapters 23 to 26; model cosmologies, Chapters 27 to 30; collapse and black holes, Chapters 31 to 34; and gravitational waves, Chapters 35 to 37).

The method of computation outlined above and described in more detail in Box 14.2 is used wherever it is quicker to employ a standard method than to learn or invent a better method. The standard method is always preferable for the student in a short course where physical insight has higher priority than technical facility.

In the dia- gram, start with a vector at position I (North Pole). Transport it parallel to itself (position 2,3, ... ) around a 90°_90°_90° spherical triangle.

CALCULATION OF CURVATURE Box 14.3 ANALYTICAL CALCULATIONS ON A COMPUTER Research in gravitation physics and general rela- tivity is sometimes beset by long calculations, re- quiring meticulous care, of such quantities as the Einstein and Riemann curvature tensors for a given metric, or the divergence of a given stress- energy tensor, or the Newman-Penrose tetrad equations under given algebraic assumptions. Such calculations are sufficiently straightforward and deductive in logical structure that they can be handled by a computer. Since 1966, computers have been generally taking over such tasks. There are several computer languages in which the investigator can program his analytic calcula- tions. The computer expert may wish to work in a machine-oriented language such as LISP [see, e.g., the work of Fletcher (1966) and of Hearn (1970)]. However, most appliers of relativity will prefer user-oriented languages such as REDUCE [created by Hearn (1970) and available for the IBM 360 and 370, and the PDP 10 computers], ALAM [created by D'Inverno (1969) and available on Atlas computers], CAMAL [created by Barton, Bourne, and Fitch (1970) and available on Atlas computers], and FORMAC [created by Tobey et al. (1967) and available on IBM 7090, 7094, 360, and 370]. For' a review of activity in this area, see Barton and Fitch (1971). Here we describe only FORMAC. It is the most widely available and widely used of the languages; but it is probably not the most powerful [see, e.g., D'Inverno (1969)]. FORMAC is to analytic work what the earliest and most primitive versions of FORTRAN were to numerical work. FORMAC manipulates algebraic expressions involving: numerical constants, such as Ij3; sym- bolic constants, such as x or u; specific elementary functions, such as sin (u) or exp (x); and symbolic functions of several variables, such as f(x, u) or g(u). For example, it can add ax + bx 2 to 2x + (3 + b)x 2 and get (a + 2)x + (3 + 2b)x 2 ; it can take the partial derivative of x 2 uf(x, u) + cos (x) with respect to x and get 2xuf(x, u) + x 2 u af(x, u)jax - sin (x). It can do any algebraic or differential-calculus computation that a human can do-but without making mistakes! Unfortunately, it cannot inte- grate analytically; integration requires inductive logic rather than deductive logic. PLjl is a language that can be used simulta- neously with FORMAC or independently of it. PLjl manipulates strings of characters-e.g., \"Zjl X29- + j.\" It knows symbolic logic; it can tell whether two strings are identical; it can insert new characters into a string or remove old ones; but it does not know the rules of algebra or differ- ential calculus. Thus, its primary use is as an ad- junct to FORMAC (though from the viewpoint of the computer system FORMAC is an adjunct of PLjl). FORMAC programs for evaluating Einstein's tensor in terms of given metric components and for doing other calculations are available from many past users [see, e.g., Fletcher, Clemens, Matzner, Thome, and Zimmerman (1967); Ernst (1968); Harrison (1970)]. However, programming in FORMAC is sufficiently simple that one ordi- narily does not have difficulty creating one's own program to do a given task. If a difficulty does arise, it may be because the analytic computation exhausts the core of the computer. It is easy to create an expression too large to fit in the core of any existing computer by several differentiations of an expression half a page long! Users of FORMAC, confronted by core- exhaustion, have devised several ways to solve their problems. One is to remove unneeded parts of the program and of the FORMAC system from the core. Routines called PURGE and KILL have been developed for this purpose by Clemens and Matzner (1967). Another is to create the answer to a given calculation in manageable-sized pieces and output those pieces from the computer's core onto its disk. One must then add all the pieces together-a task that is impossible using FORMAC alone, or even FORMAC plus PLjl, but a task that James Hartle has solved [see Hartle and Thome (1974)] by using a combination of FORMAC, PLjl, and IBM data-manipulation routines called SORT."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"§14.2.

MORE EFFICIENT COMPUTATION If the answer to a problem or the result of a computation is not simple, then there is no simple way to obtain it. But when a long computation gives a short answer, then one looks for a better method. Many of the best-known applications of general relativity present one with metric forms in which many of the components gJl.P' F JI. a{3' and RJI. pa{3 are zero; for them the standard computation of the curvature (Box 14.2) involves much \"wasted\" effort. One computes many F JI. a{3 that tum out to be zero. One checks off many terms in a sum like -FJl. p {3FP a Jl. that are zero, or cancel with others to give zero. Two alternative procedures are available to eliminate some of this \"waste.\" The \"geodesic Lagrangian\" method provides an economical way to tabulate the r JI. a{3' The method of \"curvature 2-forms\" reorganizes the description from beginning to end, and computes both the connection and the curvature. The geodesic Lagrangian method is only a moderate improvement over the standard method, but it also demands only a modest investment in the calculus of variations, an investment that pays off in any case in other contexts in the world of mathematics and physics. In contrast, the method of curvature 2-forms is efficient, but demands a heavier investment in the mathematics of I-forms and 2-forms than anyone would normally find needful for any introductory survey of relativity. Anyone facing several days' work at computing curvatures, however, would do well to learn the algorithm of the curvature 2-forms. §14.4. THE GEODESIC LAGRANGIAN METHOD One normally thinlcs that the connection coefficients FJI. a{3 must be known before one can write the geodesic equation (14.8) (Here and below dots denote derivative with respect to the affine parameter, A.)

(14.90) (14.9ep) The first equation here shows that r B <t4 = -sin 0 cos 0; the second equation shows that r'\" ¢' = r'\" B¢ = cot Q; and the absence of any further terms shows that all other r i . i\" are zero. The first essential principle is thus clear: an explici't writing out of the geodesic equation is equivalent to a tabulation of all the connection coefficients r JI. ap' The second principle says more: one can write out the geodesic equation without ever having computed the rJl. ap .

Therefore r z llu is zero in this example. Note that equations (3) are simple, in the sense that they contain few terms; therefore most of the r JI. a{3 must be zero.

CURVATURE 2-FORMS In electrodynamics the abstract notation F=dA saves space compared to the explicit notation ... ,etc. (six equations); there is no reason to shun similar economies in dealing with the dynamics of geometry. Cartan introduced the decisive ideas, seen above, of differential forms (where a simple object replaces a listing of four components; thus, q = (JIJ. dxIJ.), and of the exterior derivative d. He went on (1928, 1946) to package the 21 compo- nents Rp.va{3 of the curvature tensor into six curvature 2-forms, Regarded purely as notation, these 2-forms automatically produce a profit. They cut down the weight of paper work required to list one's answer after one has it. They also provide a route into deeper insight on \"curvature as a geometric object,\" although that is not the objective of immediate concern in this chapter. Cartan's exterior derivative d automatically effects many cancelations in the calculation of curvature. It often cancels terms before they ever need to be evaluated. Extension of Cartan's calculus from electromagnetism and other applications (Chapter 4) to the analysis of curvature (this chapter) requires two minor additions to the armament of forms and exterior derivative: (1) the idea of a vector-valued (or tensor-valued) exterior differential form; and (2) a corresponding generalization"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"§14.5. CURVATURE 2-FORMS 349 of the exterior derivative d. This section uses both these tools in deriving the key formulas (14.18), (14.25), (14.31), and (14.32). Once derived, however, these formulas demand no more than the standard exterior derivative for all applications and for all calculations of curvature (§14.6 and Box 14.5). The extended exterior derivative leads to nothing new in the first two contexts Extended exterior derivative: to which one applies it: a scalar function (''O-form'') and a vector field (\"vector-valued O-form''). Thus, take any function f Its derivative in an unspecified direction is a (1) acting on a scalar I-form; or, to make a new distinction that will soon become meaningful, a \"scalar- valued I-form.\" Specify the direction in which differentiation is to occur (\"fill in the slot in the I-form\"). Thereby obtain the ordinary derivative as it applies to a function (14.11) Next, take any vector field v. Its covariant derivative in an unspecified direction (2) acting on a vector is a \"vector-valued I-form.\" Specify the direction u in which differentiation is to occur (\"fill in the slot in the I-form\"). Thereby obtain the covariant derivative ( 14.l2a) This object too is not new; it is the covariant derivative of the vector v taken in the direction of the vector u. When one abstracts away from any special choice of the direction of differentiation u, one finds an expression that one has encountered before, though not under its new name of \"vector-valued I-form.\" This expression measures the covariant derivative of the vector v in an unspecified direction (\"slot for direction not yet filled in\"). From a look at (14.l2a), one sees that this extended exterior derivative is applied to v, without reference to u, is dv = Tv. (14.l2b) Similarly, for any \"tensor-valued O-form\" [i.e. (~) tensor] S, dS = TS. Before proceeding further with the exterior (soon to be marked as \"antisymmetric\") differentiation of tensors, write down a formula (see exercise 14.5) for the exterior (antisymmetric) derivative of a product of forms: d(a /\\ P) = (Ila) /\\ P + (-l)Pa /\\ dp, (14.l3a) where a is a p-form and P is a q-form. Now extend the exterior derivative from elementary forms to the exterior product (3) defined in general of a tensor-valued p-form S with any ordinary q-form, !J; thus, deS /\\ P) = dS /\\ P + (-I)PS /\\ d!J. (14.l3b) This equation can be regarded as a general definition of the extended exterior derivative. For example, ifS is a-tensor-valued 2-form, S = SIlPlY31BIlB P dx Y /\\ dx\", then equation (14.13b) says dS == d(BIlBpSIlPIY3IXdxY /\\ dx 3 ») = d(BIlBpSIlPjyal) /\\ (dx Y /\\ dx\")."},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"y 350 14. CALCULATION OF CURVATURE As another example, use (14.13b) to calculate d(uCT), where u is a vector-valued O-form (vector) and CT is a scalar-valued I-form (I-form): d(uCT) = (du) 1\\ CT + u dCT.

They also allow one to define and calculate the antisymmetrized second derivatives, e.g., d 2 v. The relation where v is a vector will then introduce the \"operator-valued\" or \"(D-tensor valued\" curvature 2-form qil. The notation of the extended exterior derivative puts a new look on the old apparatus of base vectors and parallel transport, and opens a way to calculate the curvature 2-form qil. Let the vector field v be expanded in terms of some field of basis vectors e 1'; thus Then the exterior derivative of this vector is Expand the typical vector-valued I-form de I' in the form Definition of wJJ. p (14.14) Here the \"components\" w· I' in the expansion of de I' are I-forms. Recall from equation (10.13) that the typical w· I' is related to the connection coefficients by Therefore the expansion of the \"vector\" (really, \"vector-valued I-form\") is dv = e idul' + wI' .u·).

Now consider the term d 2 vJl.. Recall that any given compo- nent, for example, v3, is an ordinary scalar function of position (as contrasted to vor 83 or 8 3 v3). Therefore the standard exterior derivative (Chapter 4) as applied to a scalar function is all that d can mean in d 2 vJl.. But for the standard exterior derivative applied twice, one has automatically d 2 vJl. = 0 (Box 4.1, B; Box 4.4). This circumstance reduces the expansion for d 2 v to the form § 14.5.

Ordinarily, equation (14.18) surpasses in efficiency every other known method for calculating the curvature 2-forms. The remarkable form of equation (14.17) deserves comment. On the left appear two d's, reminders that one has twice differentiated the vector field v. But on the right, as the result of the differentiation, one has only the vector field vat the point in question, undifferentiated. How v varies from place to place enters not one whit in the answer. All that matters is how the geometry varies from place to place. Here is curvature coming into evidence. It comes into evidence free of any special features of the vector field v, because the operation d 2 is an antisymmetrized covariant derivative [compare equation (11.8) for this antisymmetrized covariant derivative in the previously developed abstract language, and see Boxes 11.2 and 11.6 for what is going on behind the scene expressed in the form of pictures]. In brief, the result of operating on v twice with d is an algebraic linear operation on v; thus, (14.19) Tensor-valued curvature 2-form ~ Here qil is an abbreviation for the \"CD-tensor valued 2-form,\" (14.20) If d is a derivative with a \"slot in it\" in which to insert the vector saying in what direction the differentiation is to proceed, then the d 2 w of d 2 w = qilw has two slots and calls for two vectors, say, u and v. These two vectors define the plane in which the antisymmetrized exterior derivative of (14.19) is to be evaluated (change in w upon going around the elementary route defined by u and v and coming back to its starting point; Boxes 11.6 and 11.7). To spell out explicitly this insertion of vectors into slots, return first to a simpler context, and see the exterior derivative of a I-form (itself a 2-form) \"evaluated\" for a bivector u 1\\ v (\"count of honeycomblike cells of the 2-form over the parallelogram-shaped domain defined by the two vectors u and v\"), and see the result of the evaluation (exercise 14.6) expressed as a com- mutator, (da, u 1\\ v) = 0u(a, v) - 0v(a, u) - (a, [u, v]).

CALCULATION OF CURVATURE This result generalizes itself to a tensor-valued I-form S of any rank in an obvious way; thus, (dS, u 1\\ v) = V,,( S, v) - Vv( S, u) - (S, [u, v]). (14.22) Apply this result to the vector-valued I-form S = dw. Recall the expression for a directional derivative, (dw, u) = V\"w. Thus find the result (d 2 w, U 1\\ v) = V\" Vvw - V v V\"w - Vlu,vjW = q[(u, v)w, (14.23) Relation of curvature 2-form tJl to curvature -oper.ator '.il where q[(u, v) is the curvature operator defined already in Chapter 11 [equation (11.8)]. The conclusion is simple: the (i)-tensor-valued 2-form fJl of(14.19), evaluated on the bivector (\"parallelogram\") u 1\\ v, is identical with the curvature operator '!fl(u, v) introduced previously; thus ('!fl, u 1\\ v) = q[ (u, v). (14.24) Now go from the language of abstract operators to a language that begins to make components show up. Substitute on the left the expression (14.20) and on the right the value of the curvature operator from (11.11); and rewrite (14.24) in the form Compare and conclude that the typical individual curvature 2-form is given by the formula Relation of tJl to components of Riemann (14.25) (sum over a, [1, restricted to a < [1; so each index pair occurs only once). Equation (14.25) provides the promised packaging of 21 curvature components into six curvature 2-forms; and equation (14.18) provides the quick means to calcu- late these curvature 2-forms. It is not necessary to take the key calculational equations (14.18) on faith, or to master the extended exterior derivative to prove or use them. Not one mention of any d do they make except the standard exterior d of Chapter 4. These key equations, moreover, can be verified in detail (exercise 14.8) by working in a coordinate frame. One adopts basis I-forms w d = dx d • One goes on to use UJ/l. p = FJl. ph dx h from equation (14.15). In this way one obtains the \"standard formula for the curvature\" [equation (11.12) and equation (3) of Box 14.2] by standard methods.

CURVATURE 2-FORMS It now reduces to the calculation of \"connection I.forms\"; thus . 353 Two principles master this first step in the curvature computation: (I) the symmetry of the covariant derivative; and (2) its compatibility with the metric. Condition (I), symmetry, appears in hidden guise in the principle Symmetry of covariant derivative: d'lfi' = O. (14.26) (1) expressed 8S d2~ = 0 Here the notation \":1' for point\" comes straight out of Cartan. He thought of a vector as defined by the movement of one point to another point infinitesimally close to it. To write tIP was therefore to take the \"derivative of a point\" [make a construction with a \"point deleted\" (tail of vector) and \"point reinserted nearby\" (tip of vector)]. The direction of the derivative d in tIP is indefinite. In other words, tIP contains a \"slot.\" Only when one inserts into this slot a definite vector v does tIP give a definite answer for Cartan's vector. What is that vectO£ that tIP then gives? It is v itself. \"The movement that is v tells the point :1' to reproduce the movement that is v\"; or in concrete notation, <tIP, v) = v. (14.27) Put the content of this equation into more formalistic terms. The quantity tIP is a (i)-tensor (14.28) It is distinguished from the generic cD-tensor by the special value of its components In this sense it deserves the name of \"unit tensor.\" Insert this tensor in place of S into equation (14.22) and obtain the result (14.29) The zero on the right is a restatement of equation (1O.2a) or of \"the closing of the vector diagram\" in the picture called \"symmetry of covariant differentiation\" in Box 102. The vanishing of the righthand side for arbitrary u and v demands the vanish- ing of d 2 <j' on the left; and conversely, the vanishing of d 2 <j' demands the symmetry of the covariant derivative. The other principle basic to the forthcoming computa- tions is \"compatibility of covariant derivative with metric,\" as expressed in the form d(u' v) = (du) . v + u· (dv). ( 14.30) d(') = O.

COMPUTATION OF CURVATURE USING EXTERIOR DIFFERENTIAL FORMS The use of differential forms for the computation of curvature is illustrated in Box 14.5. This section outlines the method. There are three main steps: compute wp. v; compute q[ p. v; and compute Gp. v' More particularly, first select a metric and a frame. Thereby fix the basis forms wp. = LP. a' dx a ' and the metric components gp.v in ds 2 = gp.vwp. ® w v .

[Exercise (14.7) shows that a solution always exists by showing that the Christoffel formula (14.36) is the unique solution in coordinate frames.] It is usually most convenient to use an orthonormal frame with gp.v = 1/p.v (or some other simple frame where gp.v = const, e.g., a null frame). Then dgp.v = 0 and equation (14.31b) shows that Wp.v = -wvp.' Therefore there are only six W p.v for which to solve in four dimensions.

In reading it, one will be helped by Chapters 9-11 and 13. It is not needed as preparation for any later chapter, but it will be helpful in Chapter 17 (Einstein field equations). Identities and conservation of the source: electromagnetism and gravitation compared: Geometry gives instructions to matter, but how does matter manage to give instruc- tions to geometry? Geometry conveys its instructions to matter by a simple handle: \"pursue a world line of extremal lapse of proper time (geodesic).\" What is the handle by which matter can act back on geometry? How can one identify the right handle when the metric geometry of Riemann and Einstein has scores of interesting features? Physics tells one what to look for: a machinery of coupling between gravitation (spacetime curvature) and source (matter; stress-energy tensor T) that will guarantee the automatic conservation of the source (V . T = 0). Physics thereforea~ mathe- matics: \"What tensor-like feature of the geometry is automatically conserv~ -- Mathematics comes back with the answer: \"The Einstein tensor.\" Physics queries, \"How does this conservation come about?\" Mathematics, in the person of Elie Cartan, replies, \"Through the principle that 'the boundary of a boundary is zero'\" (Box 15.1). Actually, two features of the curvature are automatically conserved; or, otherwise stated, the curvature satisfies two Bianchi identities, the subject of this chapter. Both features of the curvature, both \"geometric objects,\" lend themselves to representation in diagrams, moreover, diagrams that show in action the principle that \"the boundary of a boundary is zero.\" In this respect, the geometry of spacetime shows a striking analogy to the field of Maxwell electrodynamics.

In electromagnetism, one has to go to the dual, *F, to have any feature of the field that offers a handle to the source, d*F = 4'1T *J. The conservation of the source, d*J = 0, appears as a consequence of the identity dd*F = 0; or, by a rewording of the reasoning (Box 15.1), as a consequence of the vanishing of the boundary of a boundary.

The Idea in Its General Abstract Form 00 = 0 (the boundary of a boundary is zero). D. Idea Behind Application to Gravitation and Electromagnetism . The one central point is a law of conservation (conservation of charge; conservation of momentum-energy). The other central point is \"automatic fulfillment\" of this conservation law. \"Automatic conservation\" requires that source not be an agent free to vary arbitrarily from place to place and instant to instant. Source needs a tie to something that, while having degrees of freedom of its own, will cut down the otherwise arbitrary degrees of freedom of the source sufficiently to guarantee that the source automatically fulfills the conservation law. Give the name \"field\" to this something. Define this field and \"wire it up\" to the source in such a way that the conservation of the source shall be an automatic consequence of the \"zero boundary of a boundary. \" Or, more explicitly: Conservation demands no creation or destruction of source inside the four-dimensional cube shown in the diagram. Equivalently, integral of \"creation events\" (integral of d* J for electric charge; integral of d*T for energy-momentum) over this four-dimensional region is required to be zero. Integral of creation over this four-dimensional region translates into integral of source density-current (*J or *T) over three-dimensional boundary of this region. This boundary consists of eight hyperfaces, each taken with due regard to orientation. Integral over upper hyperface (\"L1x L1y Liz)\" gives amount of source present at later moment; over lower hyperface gives amount of souee present at earlier moment; over such hyperfaces as \"Lit L1x L1y\" gives outflow of source over intervening period of time. Conservation demands that sum of these eight three-dimensional integrals shall be zero (details in Chapter 5)."},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"368 Box 15.1 (continued) 15. BIANCHI IDENTITIES AND THE BOUNDARY OF A BOUNDARY VaUishing of this sum of three-dimensional integrals states the conservation requirement, but does not provide the machinery for \"automatically\" (or, in mathe- matical terms, \"identically\") meeting this requirement. For that, turn to principle that \"boundary of a boundary is zero.\" Demand that integral of source density-current over any oriented hyperface '1/ (three-dimensional region; \"cube\") shall equal integral of field over faces of this \"cube\" (each face being taken with the appropriate orientation and the cube being infinitesimal): 4'1T f *J = f *F; 'TO ilT 8 f f (moment Of) '1T 'TO *T = il'T' rotation . Sum over the six faces of this cube and continue summing until the faces of all eight cubes are covered. Find that any given face (as, for example, the hatched face in the diagram) is counted twice, once with one orientation, once with the other (\"boundary of a boundary is zero\"). Thus is guaranteed the conservation of source: integral of source density-current over three-dimensional boundary of four-dimen- sional region is automatically zero, making integral of creation over interior of that four-dimensional region also identically zero. Repeat calculation with boundary of that four-dimensional region slightly dis- placed in one locality [the \"bubble differentiation\" ofTomonaga (1946) and Schwin- ger (1948)], and conclude that conservation is guaranteed, notonly in the four-di- mensional region as a whole,· but at every point within it, and, by extension, everywhere in spacetime. E. Relation of Source to Field One view: Source is primary. Field may have other duties, but its prime duty is to serve as \"slave\" of source. Conservation of source comes first; field has to adjust itself accordingly. Alternative view: Field is primary. Field takes the responsibility of seeing to it that the source obeys the conservation law. Source would not know what to do in absence of the field, and would not even exist. Source is \"built\" from field. Conser- vation of source is consequence of this construction. One model illustrating this view in an elementary context: Concept of \"classical\" electric charge as nothing but \"electric lines of force trapped in the topology of a multiply connected space\" [Weyl (1924b); Wheeler (1955); Misner and Wheeler (1957)]. On any view: Integral of source density-current over any three-dimensional region (a \"cube\" in simplified analysis above) equals integral of field over boundary of this region (the six faces of the cube above). No one has ever found any other way to understand the correlation between field law and conservation law."},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"§ 15.1. BIANCHI IDENTITIES IN BRIEF 369 F. Electromagnetism as a Model: How to \"Wire Up\" Source to Field to Give Automatic Conservation of Source Via \"00 = 0\" in Its 2-3-4-Dimensional Form Conservation means zero creation of charge (zero creation in four-dimensional region g). Conservation therefore demands zero value for integral of charge density-current over three-dimensional boundary of this volume; thus, in the Track-l language of Chapters 3 and 5.

Tum from an xyz cube to a cube defined by any set of coordinate axes, and write Bianchi's identity in the form (15.4) (See exercise 14.17 for one reexpression of this identity in the abstract coordinate- independent form, d&l = 0, and §15.3 for another.) This identity occupies much the same place in gravitation physics as that occupied by the identity dF = ddA ° in electromagnetism: (15.5) §15.3. MOMENT OF ROTATION: KEY TO CONTRACTED BIANCHI IDENTITY The contracted Bianchi identity, the identity that offers a \"handle to couple to the source,\" was shown by Elie Cartan to deal with \"moments of rotation\" [Canan (1928); Wheeler (1964b); Misner and Wheeler (1972)]. Moments are familiar in elementary mechanics. A rigid body will not remain at rest unless all the forces acting on it sum to zero: (15.6) Although necessary, this condition is not sufficient. The sum of the moments of these forces about some point qp must also be zero: (15.7) Exactly what point these moments are taken about happily does not matter, and this for a simple reason. The arbitrary point in the vector product (15.7) has for coefficient the quantity IiF(i), which already has been required to vanish. The situation is similar in the elementary cu be of Figure 15.1. Here the rotation associated with a given face is the analog of the force F(i) in mechanics. That the sum of these rotations vanishes when extended over all six faces of the cube is the analog of the vanishing of the sum of the forces F(i). What is the analog for curvature of the moment of the force that one encounters in mechanics? It is the moment of the rotation associated with a given face of the"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"374 15. BIANCHI IDENTITIES AND THE BOUNDARY OF A BOUNDARY Net moment of rotation over all six faces of a cube: (1) descri bed (2) equated to integral of source, f *T. over interior of cube cube. The value of any individual moment depends on the reference point 'cPo However, the sum of these moments taken over all six faces of the cube will have a value independent of the reference point qp, for the same reason as in mechanics. Therefore <jJ can be taken where one pleases, inside the elementary cube or outside it. Moreover, the cube may be viewed as a bit of a hypersurface sliced through spacetime. Therefore <j-' can as well be off the slice as on it. It is only required that all distances involved be short enough that one obtains the required precision by calculating the moments and the sum of moments in a local Riemann-normal coordinate system. One thus arrives at a P-independent totalized moment of rotation (not necessarily zero; gravitation is not mechanics!) associated with the cube in question. Now comes the magic of \"the boundary of the boundary is zero.\" Identify this net moment of rotation of the cube, evaluated by summing individual moments of rotation associated with individual faces, with the integral of the source density- current (energy-momentum tensor *T) over the interior of the 3-cube. Make this identification not only for the one 3-cube, but for all eight 3-cubes (hyperfaces) that bound the four-dimensional cube in Box 15.1. Sum the integrated source density- current *Tnot only for the one hyperface of the 4-cube, but for all eight hyperfaces.

Let the moments of rotation, not only for the six faces of one cube, but for all the faces of all the cubes, be taken with respect to one and the same point P. Recall (Box 15.1) that any given face joins two cubes or hyperfaces. It therefore appears twice in the count of faces, once with one orientation (\"sense of circumnavigation in parallel transport to evaluate rotation\") and once with the opposite orientation. Therefore the double sum vanishes identically (boundary of a boundary is zero!) This identity establishes existence of a new geometric object, a feature of the curva- ture, that is conserved, and therefore provides a handle to which to couple a source. The desired result has been achieved. Now to translate it into standard mathematics!"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"§ 15.4. CALCULATION OF THE MOMENT OF ROTATION §15.4.

However, there it is more convenient to take the dual representation, and speak of the element of volume as a vector.

Moreover, in all these integrals, the star * is treated as a constant and taken outside the sign of integration. The reason for such treatment is simple: the duality operation * involves only the metric, and the metric is locally constant throughout the infinitesimal 4-cube over the boundary of which the inte- gration extends.

The culminating step is 5. It has nothing to do with the integrand. It depends solely on the principle aa o. In brief, the conservation of moment of rotation follows from two circumstances. (1) The moment of rotation associated with any elementary 3-cube is by definition a net value, obtained by adding the six moments of rotation associated with the six faces of that cube. (2) When one sums these net values for all eight 3-cubes in (15.20), which are the boundary of the elementary 4-cube il, one counts the contribution of a given 2-face twice, once with one sign and once with the opposite sign. In virtue of the principle that \"the boundary of a boundary is zero,\" the conservation of moment of rotation is thus an identity. §15.6.

The calculation is brief. Evaluate the generalized exterior derivative of the moment of rotation in three steps, and find that it vanishes; thus: d*G = d[*(dq> 1\\ tJl)] = *[ d(d?P 1\\ tJl)] j step 1 = *[d 2 q> 1\\ tJl _ d?P 1\\ dtJl] step 2 = 0 step 3 Step 1 uses the relation d* = *d. The star duality and the generalized exterior derivative commute because when d is applied to a contravariant vector, it acts as a covariant derivative, and when * is applied to a covariant vector or I-form, it is without effect. Step 2 applies the standard rule for the action of d on a product of tensor-valued forms [see equation (14.l3b)]. Step 3 deals with two terms. The first term vanishes because the first factor in it vanishes; thus, d 2 q> = 0 [Cartan's equation of structure; expresses the \"vanishing torsion\" of the covariant derivative; see equation (1426)]. The second term also vanishes, in this case, because the second factor in it vanishes; thus, dtJl = 0 (the full Bianchi identity).

Thus simply is all of general relativity tied to the principle that the boundary of a boundary is zero. No one has ever discovered a more compelling foundation for the principle of conservation of mo- mentum and energy. No one has ever seen more deeply into that action of matter on space, and space on matter, which one calls gravitation. In summary, the Einstein theory realizes the conservation of energy-momentum as the identity, \"the boundary of a boundary is zero. \" Exercise 15.1.

But such temptation must be resisted for a shon time more. To grasp the field equations fully, one must Purpose of this chapter first understand how the classical laws of physics change, or do not change, in the transition from flat spacetime to curved (§§16.2 and 16.3); and one must understand how the \"gravitational field\" (metric; covariant derivative; spacetime curvature; ... ) can be \"measured\" (§§ 16.4 and 16.5). §16.2. THE LAWS OF PHYSICS IN CURVED SPACETIME Wherever one is and whenever one probes, one finds that then and there one can introduce a local inertial frame in which all test particles move along straight lines. Moreover, this local inertial frame is also locally Lorentz: in it the velocity of light has its standard value, and light rays, like world lines of test particles, are straight. But physics is more, and the analysis of physics demands more than an account solely of the motions of test particles and light rays. What happens to Maxwell's equations, the laws of hydrodynamics, the principles of atomic structure, and all the rest of physics under the influence of \"powerful gravitational fields\"?"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"The answer is simple: in any and every local Lorentz frame, anywhere and anytime in the universe, all the (nongravitational) laws of physics must take on their familiar special-relativistic forms. Equivalently: there is no way, by experiments confined to infinitesimally small regions of spacetime, to distinguish one local Lorentz frame in one region of spacetime from any other local Lorentz frame in the same or any other region. This is Einstein's principle of equivalence in its strongest form-a principle that is compelling both philosophically and experimentally. (For the relevant experimental tests, see §38.6.) The principle of equivalence has great power. With it one can generalize all the special relativistic laws of physics to curved spacetime. And the curvature need not be small. It may be as large as that in the center of a neutron star; as large as that at the edge of a black hole; arbitrarily large, in fact-or almost so. Only at the endpoint of gravitational collapse and in the initial instant of the \"big bang,\" i.e., only at \"singularities of spacetime,\" will there be a breakdown in the conditions needed for direct application of the equivalence principle (see §§28.3, 34.6, 43.3, 43.4, and chapter 44). Everywhere else the equivalence principle acts as a tool to mesh all the nongravitational laws of physics with gravity.

The laws of physics, written in abstract geometric form, differ in no way whatsoever between curved spacetime and flat spacetime; this is guaranteed by, and in fact is a mere rewording of, the equiva- lence principle. Compare the component version of the law V . T = 0, as written in an arbitrary frame in curved spacetime [equation (l6.l f)], with the component version in a global Lorentz frame of flat spacetime [equation (l6.lb)]. They differ in only one way: the comma (partial derivative; flat-spacetime gradient) is replaced by a semicolon (covariant derivative; curved-spacetime gradient). This procedure for rewriting the equations has universal application. The laws of physics, written in component form, change on passage from flat spacetime to curved spacetime by a mere replacement of all commas by semicolons (no change at all physically or geometrically; change due only to switch in reference frame from Lorentz to non-Lorentz!). This statement, like the nonchanging of abstract geometric laws, is nothing but a rephrased version of the equivalence principle. The transition in formalism from flat spacetime to curved spacetime is a trivial process when performed as outlined above. But it is nontrivial in its implications. It meshes gravity with all the laws of physics. Gravity enters in an essential way through the covariant derivative of curved spacetime, as one sees clearly in the following exercise. § 16.2.

EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE AND MEASUREMENT OF GRAVITATIONAL FIELD Box 16.1 FACTOR ORDERING AND CURVATURE COUPLING IN APPLICATIONS OF THE EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE The Problem In what order should derivatives be written when applying the \"comma-goes-to- semicolon rule\"? Interchanging derivatives makes no difference in flat spacetime, but in curved spacetime it produces terms that couple to curvature, e.g., 2B\";[Y.81 B\";y.8 - B\";.8Y = R\"It.8y BIt for any vector field (see exercise 16.3). Hence, the problem can be restated: When must the comma-goes-to-semicolon rule be augmented by terms that couple to curvature? The Solution There is no solution in general, but in most cases the following types of mathematical and physical reasoning resolve the problem unambiguously. A. Mathematically, curvature terms almost always arise from the noncommutation of covariant derivatives. Consequently, one needs to worry about curvature terms in any equation that contains a double covariant derivative (e.g., -A\",1t It + AIt,/ = 4'lTJ\"); or in any equation whose derivation from more fundamental laws involves double covariant derivatives (e.g. VuS = 0 in Example B(3) below). But one can ignore curvature coupling everywhere else (e.g., in Maxwell's first-order equations). B. Coupling to curvature can surely not occur without some physical reason. Therefore, if one applies the comma-goes-to-semicolon rule only to physically measurable quantities (e.g., to the electromagnetic field, but not to the vector potential), one can \"intuit\" whether coupling to curvature is likely. Examples: (1) Local energy-momentum conservation. A coupling to curvature in the equa- tions T\".8;/3 = O-e.g., replacing them by T\".8;.8 = R\" .BY8T.8Yu8-would not make sense at all. In a local inertial frame such terms as R\" ,BY8T.8Yu8 would be interpreted as forces produced at a single point by curvature. But it should not be possible to feel curvature except over finite regions (geodesic deviation, etc.)! Put differently, the second derivatives of the gravitational potential (metric) can hardly produce net forces at a point; they should only produce tidal forces!"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"§16.3. FACTOR-ORDERING PROBLEMS IN EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE 391 (2) Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic field tensor. Here it would also be unnatural to introduce curvature terms. They would cause a breakdown in charge conservation, in the sense of termination of ~lectric and magnetic field lines at points where there is curvature but no charge. To maintain charge conservation, one omits curvature coupling when one translates Maxwell's equations (3.32) and (3.36) into curved spacetime: Moreover, one continues to regard Fit' as arising from a vector potential by the curved-spacetime translation of (3.54') These points granted, one can verify that the second of Maxwell's equations is automatically satisfied, and verify also that the first is satisfied if and only if (See §22.4 for fuller discussion and derivation.) (3) Transport law for Earth's angular-momentum vector. If the Earth were in fiat spacetime, like any other isolated body it would parallel-transport its angu- lar-momentum vector 5 along the straight world line of its center of mass, V u 5 = 0 (\"conservation of angular momentum\"). When translating this transport law into curved spacetime (where the Earth actually resides!), can one ignore curvature coupling? No! Spacetime curvatures due to the moon and sun produce tidal gravitational forces in the Earth; and because the Earth has an equatorial bulge, the tidal forces produce a nonzero net torque about the Earth's center of mass. (In Newtonian language: the piece of bulge nearest the Moon gets pulled with greater force, and hence greater torque, than the piece of bulge farthest from the Moon.) Thus, in curved spacetime one expects a transport law of the form VuS = (Riemann tensor) X (Earth's quadrupole moment). This curvature-coupling torque produces a precession of the Earth's rotation axis through a full circle in the plane of the ecliptic once every 26,000 years (\"general precession\"; \"precession of the equinoxes\"; discovered by Hip- parchus about 150 B.C.).

THE RODS AND CLOCKS USED TO MEASURE SPACE AND TIME INTERVALS 393 Turn attention now from the laws of physics in the presence of gravity to the nature of the rods and clocks that must be used for measuring the length and time intervals appearing in those laws. One need not-and indeed must not!-postulate that proper length s is measured by a certain type of rod (e.g., platinum meter stick), or that proper time T is measured by a certain type of clock (e.g., hydrogen-maser clock). Rather, one must ask the laws of physics themselves what types of rods and clocks will do the job. Put differently, one defines an \"ideal\" rod or clock to be one which measures proper \"Ideal\" rods and clocks length as given by ds = (g\"/3 dx\" dX/3)1/2 or proper time as given by dT = defined ( - g\"/3 dx\" dX/3)1/2 (the kind of clock to which one was led by physical arguments in §1.5). One must then determine the accuracy to which a given rod or clock is How ideal are real clocks? ideal under given circumstances by using the laws of physics to analyze its behavior. As an obvious example, consider a pendulum clock. If it is placed at rest on the (1) pendUlum clocks Earth's surface, if it is tiny enough that redshift effects from one end to the other and time dilation effects due to its swinging velocity are negligible, and if the accuracy one demands is small enough that time variations in the local gravitational acceleration due to Earth tides can be ignored, then the laws of physics report (Box 16.2) that the pendulum clock is \"ideal.\" However, in any other context (e.g., on a rocket journey to the moon), a pendulum clock should be far from ideal. Wildly changing accelerations, or no acceleration at all, will make it worthless! Of greater interest are atomic and nuclear clocks of various sorts. Such a clock (2) atomic clocks is analyzed most easily if it is freely falling. One can then study it in its local Lorentz rest frame, using the standard equations of quantum theory; and, of course, one will find that it measures proper time to within the'precision (.::Jt/t -- 10- 9 to 10- 14 ) of the technology used in its construction. However, one rarely permits his atomic clock to fall freely. (The impact with the Earth's surface can be expensive!) Never- theless, even when accelerated at \"1 g\" = 980 cm/sec2 on the Earth's surface, and even when accelerated at \"2 g\" in an airliner trying to avoid a midair collision (Box 16.3), an atomic clock-if built solidly-will still measure proper time dT = ( - g\"/3 dx\" dX/3)1/2 along its world line to nearly the same accuracy as if it were freely falling. To discover this one can perform an experiment. Alternatively, one can analyze the clock in its own \"proper reference frame\" (§13.6), with Fermi-Walker- transported basis vectors, using the standard local Lorentz laws of quantum me- chanics as adapted to accelerated frames (local Lorentz laws plus an \"inertial force,\" which can be treated as due to a potential with a uniform gradient. Of course, any clock has a \"breaking point,\" beyond which it will cease to function properly (Box 16.3). But that breaking point depends entirely on the construction of the clock-and not at all on any \"universal influence of acceleration on the march of time.\" Velocity produces a universal time dilation; acceleration does not. The aging of the human body is governed by the same electromagnetic and (3) human clocks quantum-mechanical laws as govern the periodicities and level transitions in atoms and molecules. Consequently, aging, like atomic processes, is tied to proper time (continued on page 396)"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"where tP is the Newtonian potential. 394 16.

EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE AND MEASUREMENT OF GRAVITATIONAL FIELD Box 16.3 RESPONSE OF CLOCKS TO ACCELERATION AND TO TIDAL GRAVITATIONAL FORCES Consider an atomic clock with frequency stabilized by some atomic or molecular process-for exam- ple, fixed by the \"umbrella vibrations\" of ammo- nia molecules [see Feynman et. al. (1964)]. When subjected to sufficiently strong accelerations or tidal forces, such a clock will cease to measure proper time with its normal precision. Two types of effects could lead to such departures from \"ideality\": A. Influence of the acceleration or tidal force on the atomic process that provides the frequency stability. Example: If tidal forces are significant over dis- tances of a few angstroms (e.g., near a spacetime \"singularity\" terminating gravitational collapse), then they can and will deform an ammonia mole- cule and destroy the regularity of its umbrella vibrations, thereby making useless any ammonia atomic clock, no matter how constructed. Simi- larly, if an ammonia molecule is subjected to ac- celerations of magnitude comparable to its internal atomic accelerations (a - 1012\"g\" -. 10 15 cml sec 2 ), which change in times of the order of the \"umbrella\" vibration period, then it must cease to vibrate regularly, and any clock based on its vibra- tions must fail. Such limits of principle on the ideality of a clock will vary from one atomic proc- ess to another. However, they are far from being a limiting factor on clock construction in 1973. Much more important today is: B. Influence of the acceleration or tidal force on the macroscopic structure of the clock-a structure dic- tated by current technology. The crystal oscillator, which produces the periodic signal output, must be locked to the regulating atomic process in some way. The lock will be disturbed by moderate ac- celerations. The toughest task for the manufac- turer of aircraft clocks is to guarantee that precise locking will be maintained, even when the aircraft is maneuvering desperately to avoid collision with another aircraft or with a missile. In 1972 a solidly built rubidium clock will maintain its lock, with no apparent degradation of stability [.Jtlt -. 10- 12 (1 seclt)I/2 for 1 sec ~ t ~ 10 3 sec] under steady-state accelerations up to 50 \"g\" or more. But, because of the finite bandwidth of the lock loop (typically .Jp -. 20 to 50 Hz), sudden changes in acceleration will temporarily break the lock, degrading the clock stability to that of the unlocked crystal oscillator-for which an accelera- tion a produces a change in frequency of about (all \"g\") X 10- 9 . But the lock to the rubidium standard is restored quickly (ot -. 1 l.Jp), bring- ing the clock back to its normal highly stable performance. * Tidal forces are so small in the solar system that the clock manufacturer can ignore them. However, a 1973 atomic clock, subjected to the tidal acceler- ations near a spacetime singularity, should break the \"lock\" to its atomic process long before the tidal forces become strong enough to influence the atomic process itself. ·For this information on the response of rubidium clocks to acceleration, we thank H.

The interval 92 can be time- like, spacelike, or null; its squared length in all three cases will be To achieve a precision of measurement good to one part in N, where N is some large number, take two precautions: (1) Demand that the intervals (fqJ and 92 be sufficiently small compared to the scale of cur- vature of spacetime; or specifically, R<AB)((fqJf ~ liN and RlPQ)(92)2 ~ liN, where R(AB) and R<PQ) are the largest relevant components of the curvature tensor in the two regions in question.

The Pauli principle would not apply if the electrons were not identical or nearly so. From this circumstance it would appear possible to draw an important conclusion (Marzke and Wheeler). With each electron is associated a standard length, its Compton wavelength, h/me. If these lengths had started different, or changed by different amounts along the different routes, and if the resulting difference in properties were as great as one part in -(5 X 10 9 yr) X (3 X 10 7 sec/yr) X (5 X 10 18 rev/sec) - 10 36 , by now this difference would have shown up, the varied electrons would have fallen into the K- orbit, and the earth would have collapsed, contrary to observation. The Marzke- Wheeler construction expresses an arbitrary small interval 9f2, anywhere in space- time, in terms of the fiducial interval (N3, an inter- val which itself may be taken for definiteness to be the \"geometrodynamic standard centimeter\" of § 1.5. This construction thus gives a vivid meaning to the idea of Riemannian geometry. The M-W construction makes no appeal what- soever to rods and clocks of atomic constitution. This circumstance is significant for the following reasons. The length of the usual platinum meter stick is some multiple,N 1 (h 2 /me 2 ), of the Bohr atomic radius. Similarly, the wavelength of the Kr8 6 line is some multiple, N 2 (he/ e 2 )(h 2 /me2), of a second basic length that depends on the atomic constants in quite a different way. Thus, if there is any change with time in the dimensionless ratio he/ e 2 = 137.038, one or the other or both of these atomic standards of length must get out of kilter with the geometrodynamic standard centimeter. In this case, general relativity says, \"Stick to the geo- metrodynamic standard centimeter.\" Hermann Weyl at first thought that one could carry out the comparison of lengths by light rays alone, but H. A. Lorentz pointed out that one can dispense with the geodesics neither of test particles nor of light rays in the measurement process, the construction for which, however, neither Weyl nor Lorentz supplied [literature in Marzke and Wheeler (1964)]. Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild (1972) have given a deeper analysis of the separate parts played in the measurement process by the affine connection, by the conformal part of the metric, and by the full metric. . §16.5. THE MEASUREMENT OF THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD \"I know how to measure the electromagnetic field using test charges; what is the analogous procedure for measuring the gravitational field?\" This question- has, at the same time, many answers and none. It has no answers because nowhere has a precise definition of the term \"gravita- tional field\" been given-nor will one be given. Many different mathematical entities are associated with gravitation: the metric, the Riemann curvature tensor, the Ricci curvature tensor, the curvature scalar, the covariant derivative, the connection coefficients, etc. Each of these plays an important role in gravitation theory, and none is so much more central than the others that it deserves the name \"gravitational field.\" Thus it is that throughout this book the terms \"gravitational field\" and \"gravity\" refer in a vague, collective sort of way to all of these entities.

EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE AND MEASUREMENT OF GRAVITATIONAL FIELD EXERCISE To \"measure the gravitational field,\" then, means to \"explore experimentally various properties of the spacetime geometry.\" One makes different kinds of meas- urements, depending on which geometric property of spacetime one is interested in. However, all such measurements must involve a scrutiny of the effects of the spacetime geometry (i.e., of gravity) on particles, on matter, or on nongravitational fields. For example, to \"measure\" the metric near a given event, one typically lays out a latticework of rods and clocks (local orthonormal frame, small enough that curva- ture effects are negligible), and uses it to determine the interval between neighboring events. To measure the Riemann curvature tensor near an event, one typically studies the geodesic deviation (relative accelerations) that curvature' produces between the world lines of a variety of neighboring test particles; alternatively, one makes measurements with a \"gravity gradiometer\" (Box 16.5) if the curvature is static or slowly varying; or with a gravitational wave antenna (Chapter 37) if the curvature fluctuates rapidly. To study the large-scale curvature of spacetime, one examines large-scale effects of gravity, such as the orbits of planets and satellites, or the bending of ligh t by the sun's gravitational field. But whatever aspect of gravity one measures, and however one measures it, one is studying the geometry of spacetime. Exercise 16.5.

(b) Show that, when condition (4) is dropped, the most general tensor is G + Ag, where A is a constant. (See §17.3 for the significance of this.) §17.2. AUTOMATIC CONSERVATION OF THE SOURCE: A DYNAMIC NECESSITY The answer G = 8'7TT is now on hand; but what is the question? An equation has been derived that connects the Einstein-Cartan \"moment of rotation\" G with the stress-energy tensor T, but what is the purpose for which one wants this equation in the first place? If geometry tells matter how to move, and matter tells geometry how to curve, does one not have in one's hands a Gordian knot? And how then can one ever untie it? The story is no different in character for the dynamics of geometry than it is for other branches of dynamics. To predict the future, one must first specify, on an \"initial\" hypersurface of \"simultaneity,\" the position and velocity of every particle, and the amplitude and time-rate of change of every field that obeys a second-order wave equation. One can then evolve the particles and fields forward in time by means of their dynamic equations. Similarly, one must give information about the geometry and its first time-rate of change on the \"initial\" hypersurface if the Einstein field equation is to be able to predict completely and deterministically the future time- development of the entire system, particles plus fields plus geometry. (See Chap- ter 21 for details.) If a prediction is to be made of the geometry, how much information has to be supplied for this purpose? The geometry of spacetime is described by the metric that is, by the ten functions gafj of location ':f in spacetime. It might then seem that ten functions must be predicted; and, if so, that one would need for the task ten"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"equations. Not so. Introduce a new set of coordinates xli by way of the coordinate transformations §17.3. COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT 409 and find the same spacetime geometry, with all the same bumps, rills, and waves, described by an entirely new set of metric coefficients gap('3'). It would transgress the power as well as the duty of Einstein's \"geometrodynamic law\" G = 8'7TT if, out of the appropriate data on the \"initial-value hypersurface,\" it were to provide a way to calculate, on out into the future, values for all ten functions ga/3(':f). To predict all ten functions would presuppose a choice of the coordinates; and to make a choice among coordinate systems is exactly what the geometrodynamic law cannot and must not have the power to do. That choice resides of necessity in the man who studies the geometry, not in the Nature that makes the geometry. The geometry in and by itself, like an automobile fender in and by itself, is free of coordinates. The coordinates are the work of man. It follows that the ten components G a /3 = 8'7TT a /3 of the field equation must not determine completely and uniquely all ten components gil' of the metric. On the contrary, G a /3 = 8'7TT a /3 must place only six independent constraints on the ten g/l'(':f), leaving four arbitrary functions to be adjusted by man's specialization of the four coordinate functions xa(':f). How can this be so? How can the ten equations G a /3 = 8'7TT a /3 be in reality only six? Answer: by virtue of the \"automatic conservation of the source.\" More specifi- cally, the identity Ga/3;/3 = 0 guarantees that the ten equations G a /3 = 8'7TT a /3 contain the four \"conservation laws\" Ta/3;/3 = O. These four conservation laws-along with other equations-govern the evolution of the source. They do not constrain in any way the evolution of the geometry. The geometry is constrained only by the six remaining, independent equations in G a /3 = 8'7TT a /3' When viewed in this way, the \"automatic conservation of the source\" is not merely a philosophically attractive principle. It is, in fact, an absolute dynamic necessity. Without \"automatic conservation of the source,\" the ten G a /3 = 8'7TT a /3 would place ten constraints on the ten ga/3' thus fixing the coordinate system as well as the geometry. With \"automatic conservation,\" the ten G a /3 = 8'7TT a /3 place four con- straints (local conservation of energy and momentum) on the source, and six con- straints on the ten ga/3' leaving four of the ga/3 to be adjusted by adjustment of the coordinate system. §17.3. COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT In 1915, when Einstein developed his general relativity theory, the permanence of the universe was a fixed item of belief in Western philosophy. \"The heavens endure from everlasting to everlasting.\" Thus, it disturbed Einstein greatly to discover (Chapter 27) that his geometrodynamic law G = 8'7TT predicts a nonpermanent universe; a dynamic universe; a universe that originated in a \"big-bang\" explosion, G = 8'ITT must determine only six metric components; the other four are adjustable by changes of .coordinates G = 817T leaves four components of metric free because it satisfies four identities o = V .

HOW MASS-ENERGY GENERATES CURVATURE or will be destroyed eventually by contraction to infinite density, or both. Faced with this contradiction between his theory and the firm philosophical beliefs of the day, Einstein weakened; he modified his theory. The only conceivable modification that does not alter vastly the structure of the theory is to change the left hand side of the geometrodynamic law G = 8'7TT. Recall that the left hand side is forced to be the Einstein tensor, G a /3 = R a /3 - !Rg a /3' by three assumptions: (1) G vanishes when spacetime is flat. (2) G is constructed from the Riemann curvature tensor and the metric and nothing else. (3) G is distinguished from other tensors that can be built from Riemann and 9 by the demands (1) that it be linear in Riemann, as befits any natural measure of curvature; (2) that, like T, it be symmetric and of second rank; and (3) that it have an automatically vanishing divergence, V . G = 0, Denote a new, modified lefthand side by \"G\", with quotation marks to avoid confus.ion with the standard Einstein tensor. To abandon V . \"G\" = 0 is impossible on dynamic grounds (see § 17.2). To change the symmetry or rank of \"G\" is impossi- ble on mathematical grounds, since \"G\" must be equated to T. To let \"G\" be nonlinear in Riemann would vastly complicate the theory. To construct \"G\" from anything except Riemann and 9 would make \"G\" no longer a measure of spacetime geometry and would thus violate the spirit of the theory. After much anguish, one concludes that the assumption which one might drop with least damage to the beauty and spirit of the theory is assumption (1), that \"G\" _vanish when spacetime is flat. But even dropping this assumption is painful: (1) although \"G\" might still be in some sense a measure of geometry, it can no longer be a measure of curvature; and (2) flat, empty spacetime will no longer be compatible with the geometrodynamic law (G ¥- 0 in flat, empty space, where T = 0). Nevertheless, these consequences were less painful to Einstein than a dynamic universe. The only tensor that satisfies conditions (2) and (3) [with (1) abandoned] is the Einstein tensor plus a multiple of the metric: (exercise 17.1; see also exercise 17.4). Thus was Einstein (1917) led to his modified field equation Einstein's field equation with the cosmological constant G + Ag = 8'7TT. (17.11) Why Einstein abandoned the cosmological constant The constant A he called,the \"cosmological constant\"; it has dimensions cm- 2 • The modified field equation, by contrast with the original, admits a static, un- changing universe as one particular solution (see Box 27.5). For this reason, Einstein in 1917 was inclined to place his faith in the modified equation. But thirteen years later Hubble discovered t~e expansion of the universe. No longer was the cosmo- logical constant necessary. Einstein, calling the cosmological constant \"the biggest"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"blunder of my life,\" abandoned it and returned to his original geometrodynamic law, G = 8'7TT [Einstein (1970)]. A great mistake A was indeed!-not least because, had Einstein stuck by his original equation, he could have claimed the expansion of the universe as the most triumphant prediction of his theory of gravity. A mischievous genie, once let out of a bottle, is not easily reconfined. Many workers in cosmology are unwilling to abandon the cosmological constant. They insist that it be abandoned only after cosmological observations reveal it to be negligibly small. As a modern-day motivation for retaining the cosmological constant, one sometimes rewrites the modified field equation in the form §17.3.

This viewpoint speculates [Zel'dovich (1967)] that the vacuum polarization of quantum field theory endows the vacuum with the nonzero stress-energy tensor (17.12 b), which is completely unobservable except by its gravitational effects. Unfortunately, today's quantum field theory is too primitive to allow a calculation of r<VAC) from first principles. (See, however, exercise 17.5.) The mass-energy density that the cosmological constant attributes to the vacuum is (17.13) . If A ¥- 0, it must at least be so small that plV AC) has negligible gravitational effects [Ip(VAC)1 < p(MATTER>] wher-ever Newton's theory of gravity gives a successful account of observations. The systems oflowest density to which one applies Newtonian theory with some (though not great) success are small clusters of galaxies. Hence, one can place the limit Observational limit on the cosmological constant (17.14) on the value of the cosmological constant. Evidently, even if A ¥- 0, A is so small that it is totally unimportant on the scale of a galaxy or a star or a planet or a man or an atom. Consequently it is reasonable to stick with Einstein's original geometrodynamic law (G = 8'7TT; A = 0) everywhere, except occasionally when discussing cosmology (Chapters 27-30). Exercise 17.5.

THE NEWTONIAN LIMIT Just as quantum mechanics reduces to classical mechanics in the \"correspondence limit\" of large actions, I ~ 11, so general relativity reduces to Newtonian theory in the \"correspondence limit\" of weak gravity and low velocities. (On \"correspondence limits,\" see B6x 17.1.) This section elucidates, in some mathematical detail, the correspondence between general relativity and Newtonian theory. It begins with \"passive\" aspects of gravitation (response of matter to gravity) and then turns to \"active\" aspects (generation of gravity by matter). Consider an isolated system-e.g., the solar system-in which Newtonian theory is highly accurate. In order that special relativistic effects not be noticeable, all Box 17.1 CORRESPONDENCE PRINCIPLES A. General Remarks and Specific Examples 1. As physics develops and expands, its unity is maintained by a network of correspondence principles, through which simpler theories maintain their vitality by links to more sophis- ticated but more accurate ones. a. Physical optics, with all the new diffraction and interference phenomena for which it accounted, nevertheless also had to account, and did account, for the old, elementary, geometric optics of mirrors and lenses. Geo- metric optics is recovered from physical optics in the mathematical \"correspondence principle limit\" in which the wavelength is made indefinitely small in comparison with all other relevant dimensions of the physical system. b. Newtonian mechanics is recovered from the mechanics of special relativity in the mathe- matical \"correspondence principle limit\" in which all relevant velocities are negligibly small compared to the speed of light. c. Thermodynamics is recovered from its suc- cessor theory, statistical mechanics, in the mathematical \"correspondence principle limit\" in which so many particles are taken into account that fluctuations in pressure,"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"§17.4. THE NEWTONIAN LIMIT particle number, and other physical quanti- ties are negligible compared to the average values of these parameters of the system. d. Classical mechanics is recovered from quan- tum mechanics in the \"correspondence prin- ciple limit\" in which the quantum numbers of the quantum states in question are so large, or the quantities of action that come into play are so great compared to 11, that wave and diffraction phenomena make neg- ligible changes in the predictions of standard deterministic classical mechanics. Niels Bohr formulated and took advantage of this cor- respondence principle even before any proper quantum theory existed. He used it to predict approximate values of atomic en- ergy levels and of intensities of spectral lines. He also expounded it as a guide to all physi- cists, first in searching for a proper version of the quantum theory, and then in elucidat- ing the content of this theory after it was found. 2. In all these examples and others, the newer, more sophisticated theory is \"better\" than its predecessor because it gives a good description of a more extended domain of physics, or a more accurate description of the same domain, or both. 3. The correspondence between the newer theory and its predecessor (a) gives one the power to recover the older theory from the newer; (b) can be exhibited by straightforward mathe- matics; and (c), according to the historical rec- ord, often guided the development of the newer theory. B. Correspondence Structure of General Relativity 1. Einstein's theory of gravity has as distinct limit- ing cases (a) special relativity; (b) the \"linear- 413 ized theory of gravity\"; (c) Newton's theory of gravity; and (d) the post-Newtonian theory of gravity. Thus, it has a particularly rich corre- spondence structure. a. Correspondence with special relativity: Gen- eral relativity has two distinct kinds of corre- spondence with special relativity. The first is the limit of vanishing gravitational field everywhere (vanishing curvature); in this limit one can introduce a global inertial frame, set g/lV = 71/l v , and recover completely and precisely the theory of special relativity. The second is local rather than global; it is the demand (\"correspondence principle\"; \"equivalence principle\") that in a local iner- tial frame all the laws of physics take on their special relativistic forms. As was seen in Chapter 16, this puts no restrictions on the metric (except that g/lV = 71/l v and g/lv,a = 0 in local inertial frames); but it places severe constraints on the behavior of matter and fields in the presence of gravity. b. Correspondence with Newtonian theory: In the limit of weak gravitational fields, low velocities, and small pressures, general rela- tivity reduces to Newton's theory of gravity. The correspondence structure is explored mathematically in the text of § 17.4. c. Correspondence with post-Newtonian theory: When Newtonian theory is nearly valid, but \"first-order relativistic corrections\" might be important, one often uses the \"post-Newton- ian theory of gravity.\" Chapter 39 expounds the post-Newtonian theory and its corre- spondence with both general relativity and Newtonian theory. d. Correspondence with linearized theory: In the limit of weak gravitational fields, but possi- bly large velocities and pressures (v - 1, T;k - Too) general relativity reduces to the \"linearized theory of gravity\".

HOW MASS-ENERGY GENERATES CURVATURE velocities in the system, relative to its center of mass and also relative to the Newto- nian coordinates, must be small compared to the speed of light Conditions which a system must satisfy for Newton's theory of gravity to be accurate v ~ 1.

[Here <P < 0 is Newton's gravita- tional potential, so normalized that <P( (0) = 0.] The resulting velocity will be small only if (17.15b) Internal stresses in the system also produce motion-e.g., sound waves. Such waves have characteristic velocities of the order of I Tii /To o ll/2-for example, the speed of sound in a perfect fluid is v = (dp/dp)1/2 _ (p/p)1/2 _ITif/T oo ll/2. In order that these velocities be small compared to the speed of light, all stresses must be small compared to the density of mass-energy (17.15c) When, and only when conditions (17.15) hold, one can expect Newtonian theory to describe accurately the system being studied. Correspondence of general relativity with Newtonian theory for gravity in a passive role then demands that the geodesic world lines of freely falling particles reduce to the Newtonian world lines (17.16) \"Newtonian coordinates\" defined Moreover, they must reduce to this form in any relativistic coordinate system where the source and test particles have low velocities v ~ 1, and where coordinate lengths and times agree very nearly with the lengths and times of the Newtonian coor- dinates-which in turn are proper lengths and times as measured by rods and clocks. Thus, the relevant coordinates (called \"Galilean\" or \"Newtonian\" coordinates) are ones in which (17.17) (weak gravitational field; nearly inertial coordinates; low velocities).

(17.19) Note that the correspondence tells one the form of h oo for nearly Newtonian systems, but not the forms of the other components of the metric perturbation. In fact, the other hp. p could perfectly well be of the same order of magnitude as h oo - <P, without influencing the world lines of slowly moving particles, because they always enter the geodesic equation multiplied by the small numbers vor v 2 , or differentiated by t rather than by Xi. The forms of the other hp. p and their small corrections to the Newtonian motion will be explored in Chapters 18,39, and 40. The relation goo = -1 - 2<P is the mathematical embodiment of the correspondence between general relativity theory and Newtonian theory for passive aspects of gravity. Together with the \"validity conditions\" (17.15, 17.17), it is a foundation from which one can derive all other aspects of the correspondence for \"passive gravity,\" including the relation Einstein gravity reduces to Newton gravity only if. in Newtonian coordinates. goo = -1 - 2I/J The correspondence between Einstein theory and Newton theory for all \"passive\" aspects of gravity (17.20) (exercise 17.6).

A \"history of geometry,\" H, is a spacetime, that is to say, a four-dimensional manifold with four-dimensional - + + + Riemann metric that (1) reduces on one spacelike hypersurface (\"hypersurface of simultaneity\") to a specified \"initial value 3-geometry,\" A, with positive definite metric and (2) reduces on"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"§17.5.

The classical variational principle of Hilbert, as reformulated by Arnowitt, Oeser, and Misner, provides a prescription for the dynamical path length, I H , of any conceivable history H, classically allowed or not, that connects A and B (see Chapter 21 for a fuller statement for what can and must be specified on the initial hypersurface of simultaneity, and on the final one, and for alternative choices of the integrand in the action principle). c. Classical physics says that a history H is allowed only if it extremizes the dynamic path length I as compared to all nearby histories. Quantum physics says that all histories occur with equal probability amplitude, in the following sense.

The quantum of angular momentum, h = h/27T, expressed in geometric units, has the value (7) where L * is the Planck length, L * = 1.6 X 10- 33 em. d. The classically allowed history receives \"preference without preference.\" That history, and histories H that differ from it so little that 8I = I H - I CZa •• is only of the order h and less, give contributions to the probability amplitude that interfere constructively. In contrast, destructive interference effectively wipes out the contribution (to the probability amplitude for a transition) that comes from histories that differ more from the classically allowed history. Thus there are quantum fluctuations in the geometry, but they are fluctuations of limited magnitude. The smallness of h ensures that the scale of these fluctuations is unnoticeable at everyday distances (see the further discussion in Chapters 43 and 44). In this sense classical geometrodynamics is a good approximation to the geometrodynamics of the real world of quantum physics. 3. \"Physics on a spacelike slice or hypersurface of simultaneity,\" again with electro- magnetism as the model. a.

Recall (§3.4) that the demand \"lines of magnetic force never end,\" when imposed on all reference frames at 9 (for all choices of the \"simultaneity\" S), guarantees not only V . B = 0, but also V X E + oBjot = 0. Similarly (§3.4) the demand that \"electric lines of force never end except on electric charge,\" V' E = 47TJO, when imposed on all \"simultaneities\" through 9, guarantees the remaining Maxwell equation V X B = oEjot + 47TJ. c. Each simultaneity S through 9 has its own slope and curvature. The possibility of different slopes (different local Lorentz frames at 9) is essential for deriving all of Maxwell's equations from the requirements of conservation of flux. Relevant though the slope thus is, the curvature of the hypersurface S never matters for the analysis of electromagnetism. It does matter, however, for any analysis of gravitation modeled on the foregoing treatment of electromagne- tism. t Time Lspace-... s \"Simultaneity\" S (spacelike hypersurface or \"slice through spacetime\") that cuts through event 9.

A closer look discloses that three distinct ideas come into consideration here. One is the scalar curvature invariant (3) R of the 3-geometry intrinsic to the hypersurface S at 9: \"intrinsic\" in the sense that it is defined by, and depends exclusiv.ely on, measurements of distance made within the hypersurface. The second is the \"extrinsic curvature\" of this 3-geometry relative to the 4-geometry of the enveloping spacetime (\"how curved one cuts his slice\"; see Box 14.1 for more on the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic curvature). The third is the curvature of the four-dimensional spacetime itself, \"normal to u,\" in some sense yet to be more closely defined.

A fourth route to Einstein's equation starts with the advanced view of geome- trodynamics that is spelled out in Chapter 43. One notes there that the dynamics of geometry unfolds in superspace. Superspace has an infinite number of dimensions. Anyone point in superspace describes a complete 3-geometry, (3)~, with all its bumps and curvatures. The dynamics of geom- etry leads from point to point in superspace. b. Like the dynamics of a particle, the dynamics of geometry lends itself to distinct but equivalent mathematical formulations, associated with the names of Lagrange, of Hamilton, and of Hamilton and Jacobi. Of these the most convenient for the present analysis is the last (\"H-J\"). c.

Out of this equation for the dynamics of geometry in superspace one can deduce the Einstein field equation by reasoning similar to that employed in going from (17) to (18) (Gerlach 1969). f. It would appear that one must break new ground, and establish new founda- tions, if one is to find out how to regard the \"Einstein-Hamilton-Jacobi equa- tion\" (20) as more basic than the Einstein field equation that one derives from it.

HOW MASS-ENERGY GENERATES CURVATURE (22) 6. Sakharov's view of gravitation as an elasticity of space that arises from particle physics. a. The resistance of a homogeneous isotropic solid to deformation is described by two elastic constants, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. b. The resistance of space to deformation is described by one elastic constant, the Newtonian constant of gravity. It makes its appearance in the action principle of Hilbert I = _1_ f (4) R( - g)1/2 d 4 x l6r.G + f (Lmatter + L fields )( - g)1/2 d 4 x = extremum. c. According to the historical records, it was first learned how many elastic constants it takes to describe a solid from microscopic molecular models of matter (Newton, Laplace, Navier, Cauchy, Poisson, Voigt, Kelvin, Born), not from macroscopic considerations of symmetry and invariance. Thus, count the energy stored up in molecular bonds that are deformed from natural length or natural angle or both. Arrive at an expression for the energy of deformation per unit volume of the elastic material of the form Here the strain tensor e = A(Tr s)Z + B Tr(S2). (23) (24) measures the strain produced in the elastic medium by motion of the typical point that was at the location x m to the location x m + ~m(x). The constants A and B are derived out of microscopic physics. They fix the values of the two elastic constants of the macroscopic theory of elasticity. d. Andrei Sakharov (1967) (the Andrei Sakharov) has proposed a similar micro- scopic foundation for gravitation or, as he calls it, the \"metric elasticity of space.\" He identifies the action term of Einstein's geometrodynamics [the first term in (22)] \"with the change in the action of quantum fluctuations of the vacuum [associated with the physics of particles and fields and brought about] when space is curved.\" . e. Sakharov notes that present-day quantum field theory \"gets rid by a renor- malization process\" of an energy density in the vacuum that would formally be infinite if not removed by this renormalization.

It acts on the electron in the hydrogen atom in supple- ment to the electric field caused by the proton alone, and thereby produces most of the famous Lamb- Retherford shift in the energy levels of the hydrogen atom, as made especially clear by Welton (1948) and Dyson (1954)]. The totalized density of zero-point energy of the electromagnetic field per unit volume of spacetime (units: cm 4 ) formally diverges as (hlh 2 ) i '\" k 3 dk. o (25) Equally formally this divergence is \"removed\" by \"renormalization\" [for more on renormalization see, for example, Hepp (1969)]. f. Similar divergences appear when one counts up formally the energy associated with other fields and with vacuum fluctuations in number of pairs of electrons, /L-mesons, and other particles in the limit of quantum energies large in com- parison with the rest mass of any of these particles. Again these divergences in formal calculations are \"removed by renormalization.\" g.

Therefore the process of\"renormalization\" or \"subtraction\" no longer gives zero. Instead, the contribution of zero-point energies to the Lagrangian, expanded as a power series in powers of the curvature, with numerical coefficients A, B, ... of the order of magnitude of unity, takes a form simplified by Ruzmaikina and Ruzmaikin (1969) to the following: e(R) = Ah f k 3 dk + Bh(4)R f k dk + h[C«4)R)Z + DRa/3R<>/3]f k-1dk + (higher-order terms).

In this sense, Sakharov's analysis suggests that gravitation is to particle physics as elasticity is to chemical physics: merely a statistical measure of residual energies. In the one case, molecular bindings depend on departures of mole- cule-molecule bond lengths from standard values. In the other case, particle energies are affected by curvatures of the geometry. 1. Elasticity, which looks simple, gets its explanation from molecular bindings, which are complicated; but molecular bindings, which are complicated, receive their explanation in terms of SchrOdinger's wave equation and Coulomb's law of force between charged point-masses, which are even simpler than elasticity. m. Einstein's geometrodynamics, which looks simple, is interpreted by Sakharov as a correction term in particle physics, which is complicated.

The physics literature is replete with examples [see Ni (1972), and Thorne, Ni, and Will (1971) for reviews]. However, when placed among its competitors, Einstein's theory stands out sharp and clear; it agrees with experiment; most of its competitors do not (Chapters 38-40). It describes gravity entirely in terms of geometry; most of its competitors do not. It is free of any \"prior geometry\"; most of its competitors are not. Set aside, until Chapter 38, the issue of agreement with experiment. Einstein's theory remains unique. Every other theory either introduces auxiliary gravitational fields [e.g., the scalar field of Brans and Dicke (1961 )], or involves \"prior geometry,\" or both. Thus, every other theory is more complicated conceptually than Einstein's theory. Every other theory contains elements of complexity for which there is no experimental motivation. The concept of \"prior geometry\" requires elucidation, not least because the rejection of prior geometry played a key role in the reasoning that originally led Einstein to his geometrodynamic equation G = 8r.T By \"prior geometry\" one means any aspect of the geometry of spacetime that is fixed immutably, i.e., that cannot be changed by changing the distribution of gravitating sources. Thus, prior geometry is not generated by or affected by matter; it is not dynamic. Example: Nordstwm (1913) formulated a theory in which the physical metric of spacetime 9 (the metric that enters into the equivalence principle) is generated by a \"background\" flat-spacetime metric '1, and by a scalar gravitational field tf>: ( generation of tf> by), stress-energy ( construction of g) . from tf> and '1 In this theory, the physical metric 9 (governor of rods and clocks and of test-particle motion) has but one changeable degree of freedom-the freedom in tf>.

Misner) Choose a momentarily static universe populated with a large supply of suitable pulsars. The pulsars should be absolutely regular, periodically emitting characteristic pulses of both gravitational and electromagnetic waves. Two fleets of spaceships containing receivers are sent out \"on station\" to collect the experimental data. Admiral Weber's fleet carries gravitational- wave receivers; Admiral Hertz's fleet, electromag- netic receivers. The captain of each spaceship holds himself \"on station\" by monitoring three suitably chosen pulsars (of identical frequency) and maneuvering so that their pulses always arrive in coincidence. The experimental data he collects consist of the pulses received from all other pul- sars, which he is not using for station keeping, each registered as coincident with or interlaced among the reference (stationary) pulses. [For display pur- poses, the pattern produced by any single pulsar can be converted to acoustic form. The reference pulses can be played acoustically (by the data- processing computer) on one drum at a fixed rate, and the pulses from other pulsars can be played on a second drum. A pattern of rythmic beats will result.] When the data fleet is checked out and tuned up, each captain reports stationary patterns. Now the experiment begins. One or more massive stars are towed in among the fleet. The fleet reacts to stay on station, and reports changes in the data patterns. The spaceships on the outside edges of the fleet verify that no detectable changes occur at their stations; so the incident radiation from the distant pulsars can be regarded as unaffected by the newly placed stars. Data stations nearer the movable stars report the interesting data. What are the results? In a universe governed by the laws of special relativity (spacetime always flat), no patterns change. (Weber's fleet was unable to get checked out in the first place, as no gravitational waves were ever detected from the pulsars). Neither stars, nor anything else, can produce gravitational fields. All aspects of the spacetime geometry are fixed a priori (complete prior geometry!). There is no gravity; and no light deflection takes place to make Hertz's captains adjust their positions. In a universe governed by Nordstr0m's theory of gravity (see text) both fleets get checked out- i.e., both see waves. But neither fleet sees any changes in the rhythmic pattern of beats. The stars being towed about have no influence on either gravitational waves or electromagnetic waves. The prior geometry ('1) present in the theory precludes any light deflection or any gravitational-wave deflection. In a universe governed by Whitehead's (1922) theory of gravity [see Will (1971 b) and references cited therein], radio waves propagate along geo- desics of the \"physical metric\" g, and get deflected by the gravitational fields ofihe stars. But gravita- tional waves propagate along geodesics of a flat background metric '1, and are thus unaffected by the stars. Consequently, Hertz's captains must ma- neuver to keep on station; and they hear a chang- ing beat pattern between the reference pulsars and the other pulsars. But Weber's fleet remains on station and records no changes in the beat pattern. The prior geometry ('1) shows itself clearly in the experimental result. In a universe governed by Einstein's theory, both fleets see effects (no sign of prior geometry because Einstein's theory has no prior geometry). Moreover, if the fleets were originally paired, one Weber ship and one Hertz at each station, they remain paired. No differences exist between the propagation of high-frequency light waves and high-frequency gravitational waves.

A complete history of general relativity would demand a book. Here let a few key quotes from a few of the great papers give a little taste of what a proper history might encompass, Einstein (1908): \"We ... will therefore in the following assume the complete physical equivalence of a gravitational field and of a corresponding acceleration of the reference system .... the clock at a point P for an observer anywhere in space runs (I + <P/c 2 ) times faster than the clock at the coordinate origin .... it follows that light rays are ~--- curved -by the gravitational field. , .. an amount of energy E has a mass E/c z .\" Einstein and Grossmann (1913): \"The theory described here originates from the conviction that the proportionality between the inertial and the gravitational mass of a body is an exact law of nature that must be expressed as a foundation principle of theoretical physics .... An observer enclosed in an elevator has no way to decide whether the elevator is at rest in a static gravitational field or whether the elevator is located in gravitation-free space in an accelerated motion that is maintained by forces acting on the elevator (equivalence hypothesis) .... In the decay of radium, for example, that decrease [of mass] amounts to 1/10,000 of the total mass. If those changes in inertial mass did not correspond to changes in gravitational mass, then deviations of inertial from gravitational masses would arise that are far larger than the Eotvos experiments allow. It must therefore be considered as very probable that the identity of gravitational and inertial mass is exact. EXERCISE"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"432 17.

I believed in fact that I had found the only law of gravitation that corresponds to a reasonably formulated postulate of general relativity, and I sought to establish the necessity of exactly this solution in a paper that appeared last year in these proceedings. \"A renewed analysis showed me that that necessity absolutely was not shown in the approach adopted there; that it nevertheless appeared to be shown rested on an error. \"For these reasons, I lost all confidence in the field equations I had set up, and I sought for an approach that would limit the possibilities in a natural way. In this way I was led back to the demand for the general covariance of the field equations, from which I had departed three years ago, while working with my friend Grossmann, only with a heavy heart.

The word that can be said is not the perfect word. LAD-TZU (-3rd century B.C.) § 18.1. THE LINEARIZED THEORY OF GRAVITY Because of the geometric language and abbreviations used in writing them, Einstein's field equations, Gp. p = 87TTp. p , hardly seem to be differential equations at all, much less ones with many familiar properties. The best way to see that they are is to apply them to weak-field situations (18.1 ) \"linearized theory of gravity\": (1) as weak-field limit of general relativity e.g., to the solar system, where Ihp.pl - IIPI ::s M 0 / R 0 - 10- 6 ; or to a weak gravita- tional wave propagating through interstellar space. In a weak-field situation, one can expand the field equations in powers of hp. p , using a coordinate frame where (18.1) holds; and without much loss of accuracy, one can keep only linear terms. The resulting formalism is often called \"the linearized theory of gravity,\" because it is an important theory in its own right. In fact, it is precisely this \"linearized theory\" that one obtains when one asks for the classical field corresponding to quantum-mechanical particles of (1) zero rest mass and (2) spin two in (3) flat spacetime [see Fierz and Pauli (1939)]. Track-2 readers have already explored linearized theory somewhat in §7.l, exercise 7.3, and Box 7.1. There it went under the alternative name, \"tensor-field theory of gravity in flat spacetime.\" (2) as standard \"field-theory\" description of gravity in \"flat spacetime\""},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"436 18.

MEASUREMENT OF THE MASS AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM The values of a system's mass and angular momentum can be measured by probing the imprint they leave in its external gravitational field. Of all tools one might use to probe, the simplest is a test particle in a gravitationally bound orbit. If the particle is sufficiently far from the source, its motion is affected hardly at all by the source's angular momentum or by the gravitational waves; only the spherical, Newtonian part of the gravitational field has a significant influence. Hence, the particle moves in an elliptical Keplerian orbit. To determine the source's mass M, one need only apply Kepler's third law (perhaps better called \"Kepler's 1-2-3 law\"): M = ( 2'JT )2 (Semi-major aXis)3. orbital period of ellipse ' The source's angular momentum is not measured quite so easily.

As time passes, the gOi term in the metric will force the gyroscope to precess relative to the basis vectors a/ax;; and since these basis vectors are \"tied\" to the coordinate system, which in turn is tied to the Lorentz frames at infinity, which in turn are tied to the \"fixed stars\" (cf. §39.12), the precession is relative to the \"fixed stars.\" The angular velocity of precession, as derived in exercise 19.2, is §19.3.

Expand hl\"> in multipole moments and powers of l/r; and adjust the gauge, the Lorentz frame, and the origin of coordinates to simplify the resulting metric . . The outcome of such a calculation is a gravitational field identical to that for a weak source [equation (19.5)]! (Details of the calculation are not spelled out here because of their length; but see exercise 19.3.) But before accepting this as the distant field of an arbitrary source, one should examine the nonlinear effects in the vacuum field equations. Two types of nonlinear- ities tum out to be important far from the source: (1) nonlinearities in the static, Newtonian part of the metric, which generate metric corrections Metric far from any gravitating system, as a power series in 1/ r (see exercise 19.3 and §39.8), thereby putting the metric into the form [ 2M 2M2 ( 1 )] [ xl ( 1 )] . - 1--+--+0 r_ dt 2 - 4t:· I S k -+0 - dtdx' r r 2 r 3 Jk r 3 r 3 (19.13) + [(1 + 2M + 3M2) O. + (gravit~tional radiation terms)] dx j dxk; r 2r 2 Jk that die out as O(1/r) (2) a gradual decrease in the source's mass, gradual changes in its angular momen- tum, and gradual changes in its' \"rest frame\" to compensate for the mass, angular momentum, and linear momentum carried off by gravitational waves (see Box 19.1, which is best r~ad only after finishing this section). By measuring the distant spacetime geometry (19.13) ofa given source, one cannot discover whether that source has strong internal gravity, or weak. But when one expresses the constants M and Sj' which determine goo and go;, as integrals over the interior of the source, one discovers a crucial difference: if the internal gravity is weak, then linearized theory is valid throughout the source, and but if the gravity is strong, these formulas fail. Does this failure prevent one, for strong gravity, from identifying the constants M and Sj of the metric (19.13) as the source's mass and angular momentum? Not at all, according to the following argument. Consider, first, the mass of the sun. For the sun one expects Newtonian theory to be highly accurate (fractional errors -- M 0 / R 0 -- 10- 6 ); so one can assert that the constant M appearing in the line element (19.13) is, indeed M = f P d 3 x = f Too d 3 x = total mass. But might this assertion be wrong? To gain greater confidence and insight, adopt the viewpoint of \"controlled ignorance\"; i.e., do not pretend to know more than what is needed. (This style of physical argument goes back to Newton's famous \"Hypoth- eses non fingo,\" i.e. \"I do not feign hypotheses.\") In evaluating the volume integral of Too (usual Newtonian definition of M), one needs a theory of the internal structure Failure of volume integrals for M and S when source has strong internal gravity S - f' k T fO d 3 • j - t:jklX x, (19.14)"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"of the sun. For example, one must know that the visible surface layers of the sun do not hide a massive central core, so dense and large that relativistic gravitational fields 111>1 -- 1 exist there. If one makes use in the analysis of a fluid-type stress-energy tensor p.v, one needs to know equations of state, opacities, and theories of energy generation and transport. One needs to justify the fluid description as an adequate approximation to the atomic constitution of matter. One needs to assume that an ultimate theory of matter explaining the rest masses of protons and electrons will not assign an important fraction of this mass to strong (nonlinear) gravitational fields on a submicroscopic scale. It is plausible that one could do all this, but it is also obvious that this is not the way the mass of the sun is, in fact, determined by astronomers! Theories of stellar structure are adjusted to give the observed mass; they are not constructed to let one deduce the mass from nongravitational observa- tions. The mass of the sun is measured in practice by studying the orbits of planets in its external gravitational field, a procedure equivalent to reading the mass M off the line element (19.13), rather than evaluating the volume integral fTOo d 3 x. To avoid all the above uncertainties, and to make theory correspond as closely as possible to experiment, one defines the \"total mass-energy\" M of the sun or any other body to be the constant that appears in the line element (19.13) for its distant external spacetime geometry. Similarly, one defines the body's intrinsic angular mo- mentum as the constant 3-vector S appearing in its line element (19.13). Operationally, the total mass-energy M is measured via Kepler's third law; the angular momentum S is measured via its influence on the precession of a gyroscope or a planetary orbit. This is as true when the body is a black hole or a neutron star as when it is the sun. What kind of a geometric object is the intrinsic angular momentum S? It is defined by measurements made far from the source, where, with receding distance, spacetime is becoming flatter and flatter (asymptotically flat). Thus, it can be regarded as a 3-vector in the \"asymptotically flat spacetime\" that surrounds the source. But in what Lorentz frame is S a 3-vector? Clearly, in the asymptotic Lorentz frame where the line element (19.13) is valid; i.e., in the asymptotic Lorentz frame where the source's distant \"coulomb\" (\"M/r\") field is static; i.e., in the \"asymptotic rest frame\" of the source. Alternatively, one can regard S as a 4-vector, S, which is purely spatial (SO = 0) in the asymptotic rest frame. If one denotes the 4-velocity of the asymptotic rest frame by U, then the fact that S is purely spatial can be restated geometrically as S· U = 0, or § 19.3.

The total4-momentum P and intrinsic angular momentum S satisfy conservation laws that are summarized in Box 19.1. These conservation laws are valuable tools in gravitation theory and relativistic astrophysics, but the derivation of these laws (Chapter 20) does not compare in priority to topics such as neutron stars and basic cosmology; so most readers will wish to skip it on a first reading of this book.

The 4-vectors U, P, and S reside in the asymptotically flat region of spacetime and can be moved about freely there (negligible curvature = parallel transport around closed curves does not change U, P, or S). The source's 4-velocity U is defined to equal the 4-velocity of the asymptotic rest frame (UO = 1, U = 0 in rest frame).

MASS AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM OF A GRAVITATING SYSTEM Asymptotic flatness as the key to the definability of M and S of a body, one surrounds it by a large sphere, evaluates the electric field normal to the surface at each point on this sphere, integrates over the sphere, and applies the theorem of Gauss. But within any closed model universe with the topology of a 3-sphere, a Gaussian 2-sphere that is expanded widely enough from one point finds itself collapsing to nothingness at the antipodal point. Also collapsed to nothingness is the attempt to acquire useful information about the \"charge of the universe\": the charge is trivially zero. By the same token, every \"surface integral\" (see details in Chapter 20) to determine mass-energy or angular momentum collapses to nothingness. To make the same point in another way: around a closed universe there is no place to put a test object or gyroscope into Keplerian orbit to determine either any so-called \"total mass\" or \"rest frame\" or \"4-momentum\" or \"angular momentum\" of the system. These terms are undefined and undefinable. Words, yes; meanmg, no. Not having a defined 4-momentum for a closed universe may seem at first sight disturbing; but it would be far more disturbing to be given four numbers and to be told authoritatively that they represent the components of some purported \"total energy-momentum 4-vector of the universe.\" Components with respect to what local Lorentz frame? At what point? And what about the change in this vector on parallel transport around a closed path leading back to that strangely preferred point? It is a happy salvation from these embarrassments that the issue does not and cannot arise! Imagine a fancastically precise measurement of the energy of a y-ray. The experi- menter wishes to know how much this y-ray contributes to the total mass-energy of the universe. Having measured its energy in the laboratory, he then corrects it for the negative gravitational energy by which it is boun-d to the Earth. The result, is the energy the photon will have after it climbs out of the Earth's gravitational field. But this is only the first in a long chain of corrections for energy losses (redshifts) as the photon climbs out of the gravitational fields of the solar system, the galaxy, the local cluster of galaxies, the supercluster, and then what? These corrections show no sigl!- of converging, unless to Ecorrected = O. Quite in contrast to the charge-energy-angular-momentum facelessness ofa closed universe are the attractive possibilities of defining and measuring all three quantities in any space that is asymptotically flat. One does not have to revolutionize present- day views of cosmology to talk of asymptotically flat space. It is enough to note how small is the departure from flatness, as measured by the departure of ( - gOO)1/2 from unity, in cases of astronomical or astrophysical interest (Box 19.2). Surrounding a region where any dynamics, however complicated, is going on, whenever the geometry is asymptotically flat to some specified degree of precision, then to that degree of precision it makes sense to speak of the total energy-momentum 4-vector of the dynamic region, P, and its total intrinsic angular momentum, S.

Chapter 19 expounded the key features of total 4-momentum P and total angular momentum S for an arbitrary, gravitating system. But one crucial feature was left unproved: the conservation laws for P and S (Box 19.1). To prove those conservation laws is the chief purpose of this chapter. But other interesting, if less important, aspects of P and S will be encountered along the route to the proof-Gaussian flux integrals for 4-momentum and angular momentum; a stress-energy \"pseudotensor\" for the gravitational field, which is a tool in constructing volume integrals for P and S; and the nonlocalizability of the energy of the gravitational field."},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"In electromagnetic theory one can determine the conserved total charge of a source by adding up the number of electric field lines emanating from it-Le., by performing a Gaussian flux integral over a closed 2-surface surrounding it: §20.2.

They have meaning and significance independent of any coordinate system and gauge. They are tensors in the asymptotically flat region surrounding the source. The spacetime must be asymptotically flat if there is to be any possibility of deaning energy and angular momentum. Only then can linearized theory be applied; and only on the principle that linearized theory applies far away can one justify using the flux integrals (20.9) in the full nonlinear theory. Nobody can compel a physicist to move in close to define \"energy and angular momentum. He has no need to move in close; and he may have compelling motives not to: the internal structure of the sources may be inaccessible, incomprehensible, uninteresting, dangerous, expensively distant, or frightening. This requirement for far-away flatness is a remarkable feature of the flux integrals (20.9); it is also a decisive feature. Even the coordinates must be asymptotically Minkowskian; otherwise most formulas in this chapter fail or require modification. In particular, when evaluating the 4-momen- tum and angular momentum of a localized system, one must apply the flux integrals (20.9) only in asymptotical(v Minkowskian coordinates. Ifsuch coordinates do not exist (spacetime not flat at infinity), one must completely abandon the flux integrals, and the quantities that rely on them for definition: the total mass, momentum, and angular momentum of the gravitating source.

To ask for the amount of electromagnetic energy and momentum in an element of3-volume makes sense. First, there is one and only one formula for this quantity.

It produces a relative geodesic deviation of twO nearby world lines that pass through the region of space in question. It is observable. Not one of these properties does \"local gravitational energy-momentum\" posses~. There is no unique formula for it, but a multitude of quite distinct formulas.

Anybody who looks for a magic formula for \"local gravitational energy-momen- tum\" is looking for the right answer to the wrong question. Unhappily, enormous time and effort were devoted in the past to trying to \"answer this question\" before investigators realized the futility of the enterprise. Toward the end, above all mathe- matical arguments, one came to appreciate the quiet but rock-like strength of Einstein's equivalence principle. One can always find in any given locality a frame of reference in which all local \"gravitational fields\" (all Christoffel symbols; all r a I'P) disappear. No r's means no \"gravitational field\" and no local gravitational field means no \"local gravitational energy-momentum.\" Nobody can deny or wants to deny that gravitational forces make a contribution to the mass-energy of a gravitationally interacting system. The mass-energy of the Earth-moon system is less than the mass-energy that the system would have if the two objects were at infinite separation. The mass-energy of a neutron star is less than the mass-energy of the same number of baryons at infinite separation. Sur- rounding a region of empty space where there is a concentration of gravitational waves, there is a net attraction, betokening a positive net mass-energy in that region of space (see Chapter 35). At issue is not the existence of gravitational energy, but the localizability of gravitational energy. It is not localizable. The equivalence principle forbids.

Look at a small region on the surface of the potato. The geometry there is locally flat. Look at any small region of space in any of the three gravitating systems.

However, insist that in the regions between the bodies spacetime be nearly flat (gravity be weak)-so flat, in fact, that one can cover the entire system with coordinates which are (almost) globally inertial, except in a small neighborhood of each body where gravity may be strong.

Thus, one must not ignore it in the flux integrals (20.25), (20.26). In evaluating these flux integrals, it is especially convenient to use the Landau- Lifshitz form of T~ff' since that form contains no second derivatives of the metric. Thus set where teL are given by equations (20.22). Only those portions of teL that die out as 1/r 2 or 1/r 3 at large r can contribute to the flux integrals (20.25), (20.26).

One does not have to be given the Maxwell \"equation of motion\" (20.34). One can derive it fresh from (20.31) plus (20.32). The proof proceeds in five steps (see also exercise 3.18 and §5.1O). Step one: The Bianchi identity V 0 G 0 implies conservation of energy-momentum V 0 T = O. Step two: Conservation expresses itself in the language of components in the form (20.35) Step three: Leaving the middle term unchanged, rearrange the first term so that, like the last term, it carries a factor F'YT.

At all normal points, the solution of the four linear equations (20.38) with their nonvanishing determinant gives identically zero for the four unknowns (20.39); that is to say, Maxwell's \"equations of motion\" §20.6. EQUATIONS OF MOTION DERIVED FROM FIELD EQUATION 473 are fulfilled and must be fulfilled as a straight consequence of Einstein's field equation (20.31 )-plus expression 20.32 for the stress-energy tensor. Special cases admit counterexamples (see exercise 20.8); but in the generic case one need not invoke Maxwell's equations of motion; one can deduce them from the Einstein field equation. Turn from the dynamics of the Maxwell field itself to the dynamics of a charged particle moving under the influence of the Maxwell field. Make no more appeal to outside providence for the Lorentz equation of motion than for the Maxwell equation of motion. Instead, to generate the Lorentz equation call once more on the Einstein field equation or, more directly, on its consequence, the principle of the local conservation of energy-momentum. Keep track of the world line of the particle from t = t to t = t + ,jt (Figure 20.1). Generate a \"world tube\" around this world line. Thus, at each value of the time coordinate t, take the location of the particle as center; construct a sphere of radius £ around this center; and note how the successive spheres sweep out the desired world tube. Construct \"caps\" on this tube at times t and t + ,jt. The two caps, together with the world tube proper, bound a region of spacetime in which energy and momentum can be neither created nor destroyed (\"no creation of moment of rotation,\" in the language of the Bianchi identities, Chapter 15). Therefore the energy-momentum emerging out of the \"top\" cap has to equal the energy-momen- tum entering the \"bottom\" cap, supplemented by the amount of energy-momentum carried in across the world-tube by the Maxwell field. Out of such an analysis, as performed in flat spacetime, one ends up with the Lorentz equation of motion in its elementary form (see Chapters 3 and 4), Lorentz force equation derived from the Einstein field equation Figure 20.1. \"World tube.\" The change in the 4-momentum of the particle is governed by the flow of 4-momentum across the boundary of the world tube."},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"20.

One would understand what a particle is if one understood how to do the calculation of balance of energy-momentum with all rigor! Few calculations in all of physics have been done in so many ways by so many leading investigators, from Lorentz and his predecessors to Dirac and Rohrlich [see Teitelboim (1970, 1971) for still further insights]. Among the issues that develop are two that never cease to compel attention. (I) The particle responds according to the Lorentz force law (20.41) to a field. This field is the sum of a contribution from external sources and from the particle itself. How is the field exerted by the particle on itself to be calculated? Insofar as it is not already included in its effects in the \"experimental mass\" m in (20.41), this force is to be calculated as half the difference between the retarded field and the advanced field caused by that particle (see §36.l1 for a more detailed discussion of the corresponding point for an emitter of gravitational radiation). This difference is singularity-free. On the world line, it has the following simple value [valid in general for point particles; valid for finite-sized particles when and only when the particle changes its velocity negligibly compared to the speed of light during the light-travel time across itself- see, e.g., Burke (1970)] (20.42) Infinite self-energy of a point particle Every acceptable line of reasoning has always led to expression (20.42). It also represents the field required to reproduce the long-known and thoroughly tested law of radiation damping. (2) \"Infinite self-energy.\" Around a particle at rest, or close to a particle in an arbitrary state of motion, the field is e/r 2 and the field energy is (1/8'17) If (e/r 2 )24'lTr 2 dr = (e2/2)(r~n - C 1 ). r min (20.43) This expression diverges as r min is allowed to go to zero. To hurdle this difficulty, one arranges the calculation of energy balance in such a way that there always appears the sum of this \"self-energy\" and the \"bare mass.\" The two terms individ- ually are envisaged as \"going to infinity\" as r min goes to zero; but the sum is identified with the \"experimental mass\" and is required to remain finite. Of course, no particle is a classical object. A proper calculation of the energy has to be conducted at the quantum level. There it is easier to hide from sight the separate infinities-but they"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"are still present, and promise to remain until the structure of a particle is understood. Before one turns from the Maxwell and Lorentz equations of motion to a final example (deriving the geodesic equations of motion for an uncharged particle), is it not time to object to the whole program of \"deriving an equation of motion from Einstein's field equation\"? First, is it not a pretensious parade of pomposity to say it comes \"from Einstein's field equation\" (and even more, \"from Einstein's field equations\") when it really comes from a principle so elementary and long established as the law of conservation of 4-momentum? It cannot be contested that this conser- vation principle, in historical fact, came before geometrodynamics, just as it came before electrodynamics and before the theories of all other established fields. How- ever, in no theory but Einstein's is this principle incorporated as an identity. Only here does the conservation of energy-momentum appear as a fully automatic conse- quence of the inner working of the machinery of the world (energy density tied to moment of rotation, and moment of rotation automatically conserved; see Chapter 17). Out of Einstein's theory one can derive the equation of motion of a particle. Out of Maxwell's one cannot. Thus, nothing prevents one from acting on a charge with an \"external\" force, over and above the Lorentz force, nor from tailoring this force in such a way that the charge follows some prescribed world line (\"engine- driven source\"). It makes no difficulties whatsoever for Maxwell's equations that one has shifted attention from a world line that follows the Lorentz equation of motion to one that does not. Quite the contrary is true in general relativity. To shift from right world line (geodesic) to wrong world line makes the difference between satisfying Einstein's field equation in the vicinity of that world line and being unable to satisfy Einstein's field equation. The Maxwell field equations are so constructed that they automatically fulfill and demand the conservation of charge; but not everything has charge. The Einstein field equation is so constructed that it automatically fulfills and demands the conser- vation of momentum-energy; and everything does have energy. The Maxwell field equations are indifferent to the interposition of an \"external\" force, because that force in no way threatens the principle of conservation of charge. The Einstein field equation cares about every force, because every force is a medium for the exchange of energy. Electromagnetism has the motto, \"I count all the electric charge that's here.\" All that bears no charge escapes its gaze. \"I weigh all that's here\" is the motto of spacetime curvature. No physical entity escapes this surveillance. Why, then, is the derivation of the geodesic equation of motion of an object said to be based on \"Einstein's geometrodynamic field equation\" rather than on \"the principle of conservation of 4-momentum\"? Because geometry responds by its curvature to mass-energy in every form. Most of all, because geometry outside tells about mass-energy inside, free of all concern about issues of internal structure (violent motions, unknown forces, tortuously curved and even multiply-connected geometry). If one objection to the plan to derive the equation of motion of a particle \"from the field equation\" has been disposed of, then the moment has come to deal with §20.6.

Answer: There is a contradiction in dealing with a point. Therefore do not deal with a point. Do not deal with internal structure at all. Analyze the - motion by looking at the geometry outside the object. That geometry provides all the handle one needs to follow the motion. Already here one sees the difference from the derivation of the Lorentz equation of motion as sketched out above. There (1) no advantage was taken of geometry outside as indicator of motion inside; (2) a detailed bookkeeping was envisaged of the localization in space of the electromagnetic energy; and (3) this bookkeeping brought up the issue of the internal structure of the particle, which could not be satisfactorily resolved. Now begin the analysis in the new geometrodynamic spirit. Surrounding \"the Schwarzschild zone of influence\" of the object, mark out a \"buffer zone\" (Figure 20.2) that extends out to the region where the \"background geometry\" begins to depart substantially from flatness. Idealize the geometry in the buffer zone as that of an unchanging source merging asymptotically (\"boundary !X1 of buffer zone\") into flat space. It suffices to recall the properties of the spacetime geometry far outside an unchanging (i.e., nonradiating) source (exercise 19.3) to draw the key conclusion: relative to this flat spacetime and regardless of its internal structure, the object remains at rest, or continues to move in a straight line at uniform velocity (conserva- tion of total 4-momentum; §20.5). In other words, it obeys the geodesic equation of motion. If this is the result in a flash, then it is appropriate to go back a step to review it, to find out what it means and what it demands. When the object is absent and the background geometry alone has to be consid- ered, then the geodesic is a well-defined mathematical construct. Moreover, Fermi- Walker transport along this geodesic gives a well-defined way to construct a comoving local inertial frame (see § 13.6). Relative to this frame, the representative point of the geodesic remains for all time at rest at the origin. In what way does the presence of the object change this picture? The object possesses an angular momentum, mass quadrupole moments, and higher multipole moments. They interact with the tide-producing accelerations (Riemann curvature) of the background geometry. Depending on the orientation in space of these mo- ments, the interactions drive the object off its geodesic course in one direction or another (see §40.9). These anomalies in the motion go hand in hand with anomalies in the geometry. On and near the ideal mathematical geodesic the metric is Min- kowskian. At a point removed from this geodesic by a displacement with Riemann normal coordinates e, ~2, ~3 (see §11.6), the metric components differ from their canonical values (-1, 1, 1 ,1) by amounts proportional (1) to the squares and products of the ~m and (2) to the components of the Riemann curvature tensor (tide-producing acceleration) of the background geometry. These second-order terms produce departures from ideality in the buffer zone, departures that may be described symbolically as of order 8(metric) _,2. R· (spherical harmonic of order two).

In the illustrative example, this means that (SR)I/2 is required to be of the order of t: or less. Nothing can be done about the value of R because the background curvature R is a feature of the background geometry. One can meet the requirement only by imposing limits on the mass and moments of the object. In the example, where the dominating moment is the angular momentum, one must require that this parameter of the object be less in order of magnitude than the limit (20.52) Evidently this and similar conditions on the higher moments are most easily satisfied by demanding that the object have spherical symmetry (S = 0, f = 0, higher"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"moments = 0).

Therefore it is incorrect to say that such an object follows a geodesic world line. It is meaningless to say that an object of finite rest mass follows a geodesic world line. World line of what? If the object is a black hole, there is no point inside its \"horizon\" (capture surface; one-way membrane; see Chapters 33 and 34) that is relevant to the physics going on outside. Geodesic world line within what background geometry? It has no sense to speak of a geometry that \"lies behind\" or is \"background to\" a black hole. Turn from one motion of one object in one spacetime to a continuous one-param- eter family of spacetimes, with the mass m of the object being the parameter that distinguishes one of these solutions of Einstein's field equation from another. Go to the limit m = O. Then the size of the buffer zone shrinks to zero and the departure of the metric from Minkowskian perfection in the buffer zone also goes to zero. In this limit (\"test particle\"), it makes sense to say that the object moves in a straight line with uniform velocity in the local inertial frame or, otherwise stated, it pursues a geodesic in the background geometry. Moreover, this background geometry is well-defined: it is the limit of the spacetime geometry as the parameter m goes to zero [see Infeld and Schild (1949)]. In this sense, the geodesic equation of motion follows as an inescapable consequence of Einstein's field equation. The concept of \"background\" as limit of a one-parameter family of spacetimes extends itself to the case where the object bears charge as well as mass, and where the surrounding space is endowed with an electromagnetic field. This time the one-parameter family consists of solutions of the combined Einstein-Maxwell equa- tions. The charge-to-mass ratio elm is fixed. The mass m is again the adjustable parameter. In the limit when m goes to zero, one is left with (I) a background geometry, (2) a background electromagnetic field, and (3) a world line that obeys The sense in which no body can move on a geodesic of spacetime The sense in which test particles do move on geodesics of a background geometry Motion of a charged test particle in curved spacetime"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"480 20. CONSERVATION LAWS FOR 4-MOMENTUM AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM References on derivation of equations of motion from Einstein field equation Quantum mechanical limitations on the derivation EXERCISES the general-relativity version of the Lorentz equation of motion in this background as a consequence of the field equations [Chase (1954)]. In contrast, a so-called \"unified field theory of gravitation and electromagnetism\" that Einstein tentatively put forward at one stage of his thinking, as a conceivable alternative to the combina- tion of his standard 1915 geometrodynamics with Maxwell's standard electrody- namics, has been shown [Callaway (1953)] to lead to the wrong equation of motion for a charged particle. It moves as if uncharged no matter how much charge is piled on its back. If that theory were correct, no cyclotron could operate, no atom could exist, and life itself would be impossible. Thus the ability to yield the correct equation of motion of a particle has today become an added ace in the hand of general relativity. The idea for such a treatment dates back to Einstein and Grommer (1927). Corrections to the geodesic equation of motion arising from interaction between the spin of the object (when it has finite dimensions) and the curvature of the background geometry are treated by Papa- petrou (1951) and more completely by Pirani (1956) (see exercise 40.8). A book on the subject exists [Infeld and Plebanski (1960)]. Section 40.9 describes how corrections to geodesic motion affect lunar and planetary orbits. Some of the problems that arise when the object under study fragments or emits a directional stream of radia- tion, and unresolved issues of principle, are discussed by Wheeler (1961). When one turns from the limit of infinitesimal mass to an object of finite mass, no simpler situation presents itself then a system of uncharged black holes (Chapter 33). Everything about the motion of these objects follows from an application of the source-free Einstein equation G = 0 to the region of spacetime outside the horizons (see Chapter 34) of the several objects. The theory of motion is then geometrodynamics and nothing but geometrodynamics. - It has to be emphasized that all the considerations on motion in this section are carried out in the context of classical theory. In the real world of quantum physics, the geometry everywhere experiences unavoidable, natural, zero-point fluctuations (Chapter 43). The calculated local curvatures associated with these fluctuations at the Planck scale of distances [L = (hG/C 3 )1/2 = 1.6 X 10- 33 cm] are enormous [R - I/L2 - 0.4 X 10 66 cm- 2 ] compared to the curvature produced on much larger scales by any familiar object (electron or star). No detailed analysis of the interaction of these two curvatures has ever been made. Such an analysis would define a smoothed-out average of the geometry over regions larger than the local quantum fluctuations. With respect to this average geometry, the object will follow geodesic motion: this is the expectation that no one has ever seen any reason to question-but that no one has proved. . Exercise 20.6.

VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLE AND INITIAL-VALUE DATA A computer, allowing for the effect of this field on the geometry and computing ahead from instant to instant the evolution of the metric with time, imposes its own ordering on the events of spacetime. In effect, it slices spacetime into a great number of spacelike slices. It finds it most convenient (§21.4) to do separate bookkeeping on (I) the 3-geometry of the individual slices and (2) the relation between one such slice and the next, as expressed in a \"lapse function\" N and a 3-vector \"shift func- tion\" N i . The 3-geometry internal to the individual slice or \"simultaneity\" defines in and by itself the three-dimensional Riemannian curvature intrinsic to this hypersurface; but for a complete account of this hypersurface one must know also the extrinsic curvature (§21.5) telling how this hypersurface is curved with respect to the envelop- ing four-dimensional spacetime manifold. In terms of the space-plus-time split of the 4-geometry, the action principle of Hilbert takes a simple and useful form (§21.6). In the most elementary example of the application of an action principle in mechanics, where one writes J z.t 1= L(dxjdt, x, t) dt z',t' (21.4) and extremizes the integral, one already knows that the resultant \"dynamic path length\" or \"dynamic phase\" or \"action,\" S(x, t) = Iextremum' (21.5) is an important quantity, not least because it gives (up to a factor 11) the phase of the quantum-mechanical wave function. Moreover, the rate of change of this action function with position is what one calls momentum, p = oS(x, t)jox; (21.6) and the (negative of the) rate of change with time gives energy (Figure 21.1), Hamiltonian as a dispersion relation E = - oS(x, t)jot; and the relation between these two features of a system of wave crests, E = H(P,x), (21.7) (21.8) call it \"dispersion relation\" or call it what one will, is the central topic of mechanics.

VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLE AND INITIAL·VALUE DATA Another choice of what to fix at boundary hypersurface: conformal part of 3-geometry plus extrinsic time Mach updated: mass-energy there governs inertia here proves helpful to distinguish in the 3-geometry between (I) the part of the metric that determines relative lengths at a point, which is to say angles (\"the conformal part of the metric\") and (2) the common multiplicative factor that enters all the components of the gij at a point to determine the absolute scale of lengths at that point. This breakdown of the 3-geometry into two parts provides a particularly simple way to deal with two special initial-value problems known as the time-symmetric and time-antisymmetric initial-value problems (§21.1 0). The ADM formalism is today in course of development as summarized in §21.11. In Wheeler's (l968a) \"superspace\" form, the ADM treatment takes the 3-geometry to be fixed on each of the bounding spacelike hypersurfaces. In contrast, York (§21.11) goes back to the original Hilbert action principle, and discovers what it takes to be fixed on each of the bounding spacelike hypersurfaces. The appropriate data turn out to be the \"conformal part of the 3-geometry\" plus something closely related to what Kuchar (1971a and 1972) calls the \"extrinsic time.\" The contrast between Wheeler's approach and the Kuchar-York approach shows particularly clearly when one (I) deals with a flat spacetime manifold, (2) takes a flat spacelike section through this spacetime, and then (3) introduces a slight bump on this slice, of height t\". The 3-geometry intrinsic to this deformed slice differs from Euclidean geometry only to the second order in t\". Therefore to read back from the full 3-geom- etry to the time (\"the forward advance of the bump\") requires in this case an operation something like extracting a square root. In contrast, the Kuchar-York treatment deals with the \"extrinsic curvature\" of the slice, something proportional to the first power of t\", and therefore provides what is in some ways a more convenient measure of time [see especially Kuchar (1971) for the construction of \"extrinsic time\" for arbitrarily strong cylindrical gravitational waves; see- also Box 30.1 on \"time\" as variously defined in \"mixmaster cosmology\"]. York shows that the time-variable is most conveniently identified with the variable \"dynamically conjugate to the conformal factor in the 3-geometry.\" The initial-value problem of geometrodynamics can be formulated either in the language of Wheeler or in the language of Kuchar and York. In either formulation (§21.9 or §21.l1) it throws light on what one ought properly today to understand by Mach's principle (§21.12). That principle meant to Mach that the \"acceleration\" dealt with in Newtonian mechanics could have a meaning only ifit was acceleration with respect to the fixed stars or to something equally well-defined. It guided Einstein to general relativity. Today it is summarized in the principle that \"mass-energy there governs inertia here,\" and is given mathematical expression in the initial-value equations. The analysis of the initial-value problem connected past and future across a spacelike hypersurface. In contrast, one encounters a hypersurface that accommo- dates a timelike vector when one deals (§21.l3) with the junction conditions between one solution of Einstein's field equation (say, the Friedmann geometry interior to a spherical cloud of dust of uniform density) and another (say, the Schwarzschild geometry exterior to this cloud of dust). Section 21.13, and the chapter, terminate with notes on gravitational shock waves and the characteristic initial-value problem (the statement of initial-value data on a light cone, for example)."},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"§21.2. HILBERT ACTION PRINCIPLE AND PALATINI METHOD OF VARIATION §21.2. THE HILBERT ACTION PRINCIPLE AND THE PALATINI METHOD OF VARIATION 491 Five days before Einstein presented his geometrodynamic law in its final and now standard form, Hilbert, animated by Einstein's earlier work, independently discovered (l915a) how to formulate this law as the consequence of the simplest action principle of the form (21.2-21.3) that one can imagine: Variational principle the simplest route to Einstein's equation (21.13) (Replace 1/16'1T by c 3 /16'1TG when going from the present geometric units to conven- tional units; or divide by 11 -- L·2 to convert from dynamic phase, with the units of action, to actual phase of a wave function, with the units of radians). Here (4)R is the four-dimensional scalar curvature invariant, as spelled out in Box 8.4. This action principle contains second derivatives of the metric coefficients. In contrast, the action principle for mechanics contains only first derivatives of the dynamic variables; and similarly only derivatives of the type oA;./ox/3 appear in the action principle for electrodynamics. Therefore one might also have expected only first derivatives, of the form og!J.p/oxY, in the action principle here. However, no scalar invariant lets itself be constructed out of these first derivatives. Thus, to be an invariant, L geom has to have a value independent of the choice of coordinate system. But in the neighborhood of a point, one can always so choose a coordinate system that all first derivatives of the g!J.P vanish. Apart from a constant, there is no scalar invariant that can be built homogeneously out of the metric coefficients and their first derivatives. When one turns from first derivatives to second derivatives, one has all twenty distinct components of the curvature tensor to work with. Expressed in a local inertial frame, these twenty components are arbitrary to the extent of the six parameters of a local Lorentz transformation. There are thus 20 - 6 = 14 independent local features of the curvature (\"curvature invariants\") that are coordinate-independent, anyone of which one could imagine employing in the action principle. However, (4) R is the only one of these 14 quantities that is linear in the second derivatives of the metric coefficients. Any choice of invariant other than Hilbert's complicates the geometrodynamic law, and destroys the simple correspondence with the Newto- nian theory of gravity (Chapter 17). Hilbert originally conceived of the independently adjustable functions of x, y, Z, t in the variational principle as being the ten distinct components of the metric tensor in contravariant representation, g!J.P. Later Palatini (1919) discovered a simpler and more instructive listing of the independently adjustable functions: not the ten g!J. P alone, but the ten g!J.P plus the forty r~p of the affine connection. To give up the standard formula for the connection r in terms of the metric g and let r \"flap in the breeze\" is not a new kind of enterprise in mathematical physics. Even in the simplest problem of mechanics, one can give up the standard formula for the momentum p in terms of a time-derivative of the coordinate x and also let Scalar curvature invariant the only natural choice"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"p \"flap in the breeze.\" Then x(t) and p(t) become two independently adjustable functions in a new variational principle, Idea of varying coordinate and momentum independently 492 21.

The extremization with respect to choice of the other function, x(t), gives the equation of motion just as does the more elementary variational analysis of Euler and La- grange, where x(t) is the sole adjustable function, A further analysis of this equiva- lence between the two kinds of variational principles in particle mechanics appears in Box 21.1, In that box, one also sees the two kinds of variational principle as applied to electrodynamics, To express the Hilbert variational principle in terms of the r~v and ga/3 regarded as the primordial functions of t, x, y, z, note that the Lagrangian density is Here, as in any spacetime manifold with an affine connection, one has (Chap- ter 14) (21.16) where (21.17) Variation of connection is a tensor and every r is given in advance (in a coordinate frame) as symmetric in its two lower indices, In order that the integral I of (21.2-21.3) should be an extremum, one requires that the variation in I caused by changes both in the g/LV and in the r's should vanish; thus, Consider now the variations of the individual factors in the first and second integrals in (21.18), The variation of the first factor is trivial, oga/3. In the variation of the second factor, R a /3' changes in the ga/3 play no part; only changes in the r's appear. Moreover, the variation or~/3 is a tensor even though r~/3 itself is not.

Variation of Field on Hypersurface and Variation of Location of Hypersurface are Cleanly Separated Concepts in Electromagnetism The electromagnetic field F is the physically relevant quantity in electromagnetism (compare the 3-geometry in geometrodynamics). By contrast, the 4-potential A has no direct physical significance. A change of gauge in the potentials, leaves unchanged the field components Fp.v = oAv/oxP. - oAp./ox v (compare the coordinate transformation that changes the gp.v while leaving un- changed the (3)~). The variation of the fields within the body of the sandwich is nevertheless expressed most conveniently in terms of the effect of changes oAp. in the potentials. One also wants to see how the action integral is influenced by changes in the location of the upper spacelike hypersurface (\"many-fingered time\"). Think of the point of the hypersurface that is presently endowed with coordinates x, y, z, t(x, y, z) as being displaced to x, y, =, t + ot(x,y, z). Now renounce this use of a privi- leged coordinate system. Describe the displacement of the simultaneity in terms of a 4-vector on (not a unit 4-vector) normal to the hypersurface X. The ele- ment of 4-volume oil included between the original upper face of the sandwich and the new upper face, that had in the privileged coordinate system the form (- g)l/2 ot(x,y~~)d3X, in the notation of Chapter 20 becomes (10) where the element of surface d 3 X p. already includes the previously listed factor (_ g)1/2."},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"496 Box 21.1 (continued) 21.

Bubble Differentiation The \"bubble differentiation\" with respect to \"many-fingered time\" that appears in (15) was first introduced by Tomonaga (1946). One thinks of a spacelike hypersurface I l' a magnetic field B de- fined as a function of position on this hypersurface (by an observer on a world line normal to this hypersurface), and a prescription S that carries one from this information to a single number, the ac- tion. (Divided by 1'1, this action gives the phase of the \"wave function\" or \"probability amplitude\" for the occurrence of this particular distribution of field values over this particular hypersurface.) One goes to a second hypersurface I 2 (see inset), which is identical with I l' except in the immediate vicinity of a given point. Take a distribution of field values over X 2 that is identical with the origi- nal distribution over I l' \"identity of location\" being defined by means of the normal. Evaluate the difference, oS, in the value of the dynamic phase or action in the two cases. Divide this differ- ence by the amount of proper 4-volume oil = f(on' d 3 E) contained in the \"bubble\" between the two hypersurfaces.

It also possesses a direct analog of equation (I8) (\"dynamic equation for the propagation of the action\") with this one difference: in electrodynamics the field variable B and the many-fingered time are distinct in character, whereas in geo- metrodynamics the \"field\" and the \"many-fingered time\" can be regarded as two aspects of one and the same (3l~:"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"§21.2.

Newton (1687) in the first page of the preface to the first edition of his Principia notes that \"The description of right lines ... , upon which geometry is founded, belongs to mechanics. Geometry does not teach us to draw these lines, but requires them to be drawn.\" Newton's remark is also a question. Mechanics moves a particle along a straight line, but what is the machinery by which mechanics accomplishes this miracle? The quantum principle gives the answer. The particle moves along the straight line only by not moving along the straight line. In effect it \"feels out\" every conceivable world line that leads from the start, (x', t'), to the point of detection, (x\", to), \"compares\" one with another, and takes the extremal world line. How does it accomplish this miracle? The particle is governed by a \"probability amplitude to transit from (x', t') to (x\", t\").\" This amplitude or \"propagator,\" (x\", t\"lx', t'), is the democratic sum with equal weight of contributions from every world line that leads from start to finish; thus, (IS) Here N is a normalization factor, the same for all histories. ,vx is the \"volume element\" for the sum over histories.

MAnER LAGRANGIAN AND STRESS-ENERGY TENSOR The derivation of Einstein's geometrodynamic law from Hilbert's action principle puts on the righthand side a source term that is derived from the field Lagrangian. In contrast, the derivation of Chapter 17 identified the source term with the stress- energy tensor of the field. For the two derivations to be compatible, the stress-energy tensor must be given by the expression Lagrangian generates stress-energy tensOr (2 I.33a) or (2I.33b) What are the consequences of this identification? By the term \"Lagrange function of the field\" as employed here, one means the Lagrange function of the classical theory as formulated in flat spacetime, with the flat-spacetime metric replaced wherever it appears by the actual metric, and with the \"comma-goes-to-semicolon rule\" of Chapter 16 applied to all derivatives. Were one dealing with a general tensorial field, the comma-goes-to-semicolon rule would introduce, in addition to the derivative of the tensorial field with all its indices, a number of r's equal to the number of indices. The presence of these r's in the field Lagrangian would have unhappy consequences for the Palatini variational procedure described in §21.2. No longer would the F's_e_nd up given in terms of the metric coefficients by the standard formula (21.27): No longer would the geom- etry, as derived from the Hilbert-Palatini variation principle, be Riemannian. Then what? These troublesome issues do not arise in two well-known simple cases, a scalar field and an electromagnetic field. In the one case, the field Lagrangian becomes (21.34) Electromagnetism as an example No connection coefficient comes in; the quantity being differentiated is a scalar. In the other case, the field Lagrangian is built on first derivatives of the 4-potential A/l' Therefore r's should appear, according to the standard rules for covariant differentiation (Box 8.4). However, the derivatives of the A's appear, never alone, but always in an antisymmetric combination where the r's cancel, making covariant derivatives equivalent to ordinary derivatives: (21.35) Contrast to stress-energy tensor of \"canonical field theory\" In both cases, the differentiations of (21.33) to generate the stress-energy tensor are easily carried out (exercises 21.2 and 21.3) and give the standard expressions already seen [(5.22) and (5.23)] for T/l v in one of these two cases in an earlier chapter. Field theory provides a quite other method to generate a so-called canonical expression for the stress-energy tensor of a field [see, for example, Wentzel (1949)]."},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"§21.4. SPLITTING SPACETIME INTO SPACE AND TIME 505 By the very manner of construction, such an expression is guaranteed also to satisfy the law of conservation of momentum and energy, and by this circumstance it too becomes useful in certain contexts. However, the canonical tensor is often not symmetric in its two indices, and in such cases violates the law of conservation of angular momentum (see discussion in §5.7). Even when symmetric, it may give a quite different localization of stress and energy than that given by (21.33). Field theory in and by itself is unable to decide between these different pictures of where the field energy is localized. However, direct measurements of the pull of gravitation provide in principle [see, for. example, Feynman (1964)] a means to distinguish between alternative prescriptions for the localization of stress-energy, because gravi- tation responds directly to density of mass-energy and momentum. It is therefore a happy circumstance that the theory of gravity in the variational formulation gives a unique prescription for fixing the stress-energy tensor, a prescription that, besides being symmetric, also automatically satisfies the laws of conservation of momentum and energy (exercises 212 and 21.3). [For an early discussion of the symmetrization of the stress-energy tensor, see Rosenfeld (1940) and Belinfante (1940). A more extensive discussion is given by Corson (1953) and Davis (1970), along with extensive references to the literature.] When one deals with a spinor field, one finds it convenient to take as the quantities to be varied, not the metric coefficients themselves, but the components of a tetrad of orthonormal vectors defined as a tetrad field over all space [see Davis (1970) for discussion and references].

INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC CURVATURE 509 The central concept in Einstein's account of gravity is curvature, so it is appropriate to analyze curvature in the language of the (3 + l)-space-time split. The curvature intrinsic to the 3-geometry of a spacelike hypersurface may be defined and calculated by the same methods described and employed in the calculation offour-dimensional curvature in Chapter 14. Of all measures of the intrinsic curvature, one of the simplest is the Riemann scalar curvature invariant (3) R (written for simplicity of notation in what follows without the prefix, as R); and of all ways to define this invariant (see Chapter 14), one of the most compact uses the limit (see exercise 21.4) ( proper area of a surface (approximatelY) 4771,2 - a ~-sphere) defined ~s the locus of the ( at point ) pomts at a proper dIstance /; R = Lim 18 ------------------ under study ...... 0 417 /;4 (21.50) For a more detailed description of the curvature intrinsic to the 3-geometry, capitalize on differential geometry as already developed in Chapters 8 through 14, amending it only as required to distinguish what is three-dimensional from what is four-dimensional.

Here the e i are the basis tangent vectors e j = %x i (in one notation) or ei = o'!i' /}x i (in another notation) dual to the three coordinate I-forms dx i • Any field of tangent vectors A that happens to lie in the hypersurface lets itself be expressed in terms of the same basis vectors: (21.52) The scalar product of this vector with the base vector e j is (21.53) Now turn attention from a vector at one point to the parallel transport of the vector to a nearby point. A vector lying on the equator of the Earth and pointing toward the North Star, transported parallel to itself along a meridian to a point still on the Earth's surface, but 1,000 km to the north, will no longer lie in the 2-geometry of the surface of the Earth. A telescope located in the northern hemisphere has to raise its tube to see the North Star! The generalization to a three-dimensional hypersurface imbedded in a 4-geometry is immediate. Take vector A, lying in the hypersurface, and transport it along an elementary route lying in the hypersurface, and in the course of this transport displace it at each stage parallel to itself, where \"parallel\" means parallel with respect to the geometry of the enveloping 4-manifold. Then A will ordinarily"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"510 21. VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLE AND INITIAL-VALUE DATA end up no longer lying in the hypersurface. Thus the \"covariant derivative\" of A in the direction of the i-th coordinate direction in the geometry of the enveloping spacetime (that is, the A at the new point diminished by the transported A) has the form (see § lOA) (21.54) A special instance of this formula is the equation for the covariantly measured change of the base vector em itself, (21.55) In both (21.54) and (21.55) the presence of the \"out-of-the-hypersurface component\" (21.56) From parallel transport in 4-geometry to parallel transport in 3-geometry A new covariant derivative. taken with respect to the 3-geometry is quite evident. Now kill this component. Project (4)VA orthogonally onto the hypersurface. In this way arrive at a parallel transport and a covariant derivative that are intrinsic to the 3-geometry of the hypersurface. By rights this covariant derivative should be written (3)V; but for simplicity of notation it will be written as V in the rest of this chapter, except where ambiguity might arise. To get the value of the new covariant derivative, one has only to rewrite (21.54) with the suffix (4) replaced everywhere by a (3), or, better, dropped altogether and with the \"dummy index\" of summation Jl = (0,1,2,3) replaced by m = (1,2,3). However, it is more convenient, following Israel (1966), to turn from an expression dealing with contra- variant components Ai of A to one dealing with covariant components Ai = (A· ei)' Thus the covariant derivative of A in the direction of the i-th coordinate direction in the hypersurface, calculated with respect to the 3-geometry intrinsic to the hyper- surface itself, has for its h-th covariant component ~he quantity [see equation (10.18)] Here the notation of the vertical stroke distinguishes this covariant derivative from the covariant derivative taken with respect to the 4-geometry, as, for example, in equations (l0.17ff). The connection coefficients here for three dimensions, like those dealt with earlier for four dimensions [see the equations leading from (14.14) through (14.15)], allow themselves to be expressed in terms of the metric coefficients and their first derivatives, and have the interpretation ( 3l r -r - e ·Ve mhi = mhi - m i h' (21.58) From the connection coefficients in turn, one calculates as in Chapter 14 the full Riemann curvature tensor (3)Ri jmn of the 3-geometry intrinsic to the hypersurface.

The difference, on, may be regarded in the appropriate approximation as a \"vector,\" the value of which is governed by and depends linearly on the \"vector\" of displacement oq>. To obviate any appeal to the notion of approximation, go from the finite displace- ment oq> to the limiting concept of the vector-valued \"displacement I-form\" dq> [see equation 15.13]. Also replace the finite but not rigorously defined vector on by the limiting concept of a vector-valued I-form dn. This quantity, regarded as a vector, being the change in a vector n that does not change in length, must represent a change in direction and thus stand perpendicular to n. Therefore it can be regarded as lying in the hypersurface I. Depending linearly on dq>, it can be represented in the form dn = -K(cJC:J).

Equation (21.60) already tells how n changes under parallel transport. The change of em is to be read off from (21.55) as a vector. It is adequate identification of this vector to know its scalar product with each of four independent vectors: with the basis vectors e l , e z ' and e 3 , or, more briefly, with e s ' in (21.58); and with the normal vector n in (21.61).

VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLE AND INITIAL-VALUE DATA When one multiplies (21.83) by dt dx l dx 2 dx 3 and integrates to obtain the action integral, the term (21.85) integrates out to a surface term. Variations of the geometry interior to this surface make no difference in the value of this surface term. Therefore it has no influence on the equations of motion to drop the term (21.85). The result of the calculation (exercise 21.10) is simple: what is left over after dropping the divergence merely changes the sign of the terms in Tr K2 and (Tr K)2 in (21.84). Thus the variation principle becomes (extremum) = Imodified = f t'modified d 4 x (21.86) = (1/16'17) f [R + (n' n)((Tr K)2 - Tr K2)] N g l/2 dt d 3 x + f t'fields d 4 x. This expression, rephrased, is the starting point for Arnowitt, Oeser, and Misner's analysis of the dynamics of geometry. Two supplements from a paper of York (1972b; see also exercise 21.9) enlarge one's geometric insight into what is going on in the foregoing analysis. First, the tensor of extrinsic curvature lets itself be defined [see also Fischer (1971)] most naturally in the form (21.87) where 9 is the metric tensor of the 3-geometry, n is the timelike unit normal field, and 4, is the Lie derivative as defined in exercise 21.8. Second, the divergence (21.85), which has to be added to the Lagrangian of (21.86) to obtain the full Hilbert Lagrangian, is -2[( -(4)g)l/2(n a 'Tr K + aa')l,a., where the coordinates are general (see exercise 21.10), and a a' - n a ' nf3' - ;f3' (21.88) (21.89) (21.90) is the 4-acceleration of an observer traveling along the timelike normal n to the successive slices. §21.7. THE ARNOWITT, OESER, AND MISNER FORMULATION OF THE DYNAMICS OF GEOMETRY Dirac (1959, 1964, and earlier references cited therein) formulated the dynamics of geometry in a (3 + I )-dimensional form, using generalizations of Poisson brackets and of Hamilton equations. Arnowitt, Oeser, and Misner instead made the Hilbert- Palatini variational principle the foundation for this dynamics. Because of its sim- plicity, this ADM (1962) approach is followed here.

The quantities to be varied to extremize the action are the coefficients in the metric of the 4-geometry, as follows: the six gii and the lapse function N and shift function N i ; and also the six \"geome- trodynamic momenta,\" 7T ii . To vary these momenta as well as the metric is (1) to follow the pattern of elementary Hamiltonian dynamics (Box 21.1), where, by taking the momentum p to be as independently variable as the coordinate x, one arrives at two Hamilton equations of the first order instead of one Lagrange equation of the second order, and (2) to follow in some measure the lead of the Palatini variation principle of §21.2. There, however, one had 40 connection coefficients to vary, whereas here one has come down to only six 7T H . To know these momenta and the 3-metric is to know the extrinsic curvature. Before carrying out the variation, drop the divergence -2[ 1.i from (21.90), since it gives rise only to surface integrals and therefore in no way affects the equations of motion that will come out of the variational principle. Also rewrite the first term in (21.90) in the form (21.94) and drop the complete time-derivative from the variation principle, again because it is irrelevant to the resulting equations of motion.

Therefore the quantities that really have to be fixed on the two faces of the sandwich are the 3-geometries ('3)~' (on the initial hypersurface) and (3)~ (on the final hypersurface) and nothing more. In mathematical terms, a 3-geometry (3)~ is the \"equivalence class\" of a set of differentiable manifolds that are isometrically equivalent to each other under diffeo- morphisms. In the terms of the everyday physicist, a 3-geometry is the equivalence class of 3-metrics gi/x,y, z) that are equivalent to one another under coordinate transformations. In more homely terms, two automobile fenders have one and the same 2-geometry if they have the same shape, regardless of how much the coordinate rulings painted on the one may differ from the coordinate rulings painted on the other. To have in equation (21.95) an example of a field Lagrangian that is at the same time physically relevant and free of avoidable complications, take the case of a source-free electromagnetic field. It would be possible to take the field Lagrangian to have the standard Maxwell value, (21.96) with (21.97) The variation of the Lagrangian with respect to the independent dynamic variables of the field, the four potentials A a , would then immediately give the four second-order partial differential wave equations for these four potentials. However, to have instead a larger number of first-order equations is as convenient for electrodynamics as it is for geometrodynamics. One seeks for the analog of the Hamiltonian equations of particle dynamics, dx/dt = oH(x,p)/op, dp/dt = -·oH(x,p)/ox.

To arrive at a well-defined extremum of the action integral I, it was not enough to annul the coefficients, in square brackets, of 8p and 8x; that is, to impose Hamil- ton's equations of motion. It was necessary in addition to annul the quantities at limits, p 8x; that is, to specify x at the start and at the end of the motion. Similarly here.

With the 3-geometry fixed on the two faces of the sandwich, vary conditions in between to extremize the action, varying in turn the 7T ii , the gij' and the lapse and shift functions.

There one gives x and p at a starting time and integrates two first-order equations for dx/dt and dp/dt ahead in time to find these dynamically conjugate variables at all future times. Here one gives appropriate values of gij and '17'ii over an initial spacelike hypersurface and integrates the two first-order equations (21.114) and (21.115) ahead in time to find the geometry at future times.

INTEGRATING FORWARD IN TIME 527 Time in general relativity has a many-fingered quality very different from the one-parameter nature of time in non relativistic particle mechanics [see, however, Dirac, Fock, and Podolsky (1932) for a many-time formalism for treating the relati- vistic dynamics of a system of many interacting particles]. He who is studying the geometry is free to push ahead the spacelike hypersurface faster at one place than another, so long as he keeps it spacelike. This freedom expresses itself in the lapse function N(t, x,y, z) at each stage, t, of the integration. Equations (2UI4) and (2UI5) are not a conduit to feed out information on N to the analyst. They are a conduit for the analyst to feed in information on N. The choice of Nis to be made, not by nature, but by man. The dynamic equations cannot begin to fulfill their purpose until this choice is made. The \"time parameter\" t is only a label to distinguish one spacelike hypersurface from another in a one-parameter family of hyper surface; but N thus tells the spacing in proper time, as it varies from place to place, between the successive slices on which one chooses to record the time-evolution of the geometry. A cinema camera can record what happens only one frame at a time, but the operator can make a great difference in what that camera sees by his choice of angle for the filming of the scene. So here, with the choice of slicing. Another choice is of concern to the analyst, especially one doing his analysis on a digital computer. He is in the course of determining, via (2UI4-21.115) written as difference equations, what happens on a lattice work of points, typified by x = ... ,73,74, 75, 76, 77, ... , etc. He finds that the curvatures are developing most strongly in a localized region in the range around x = 83 to x = 89. He wants to increase the density of coverage of his tracer points in this region. He does so by causing points at lesser and greater x values to drift into this region moment by moment as t increases: t = ... , 122, 123, 124, .... He makes the tracer points at lesser x-values start to move to the right (N l positive) and points at greater x-values move to the left (N l negative). In other words, the choice of the three shift functions Ni(t, x,y, z) is just as much the responsibility of the analyst as is the choice of the lapse function N. The equations will never tell him what to pick. He has to tell the equations. These options, far from complicating dynamic equations (21.1 14-21.1 15), make them flexible and responsive to the wishes of the analyst in following the course of whatever geometrodynamic process is in his hands for study. The freedom that exists in general relativity in the choice of the four functions N, N i , is illuminated from another side by comparing it with the freedom one has in electrodynamics to pick the one function <p(t, x,y, z), the scalar potential. In no way do the dynamic Maxwell equations (21.103) and (21.107), as generalized in exercise 21.12 determine <p. Instead they demand that it be determined (by the analyst) as the price for predicting the time-development of the vector potential Ai' An altered choice of <p(t, x,y, z) in its dependence on position and time means altered results from the dynamic equations for the development of the three Ai in time and space. However, the physically significant quantities, the electric and magnetic fields themselves on successive hypersurfaces, come out the same (exercise 21.14) regardless of this choice of <p.

Fully to analyze the four \"initial- value\" or \"constraint\" conditions (2l.l16) and (21.1l7) is thus to determine (I) how many dynamic degrees offreedom the geometry possesses and (2) what these degrees of freedom are; that is to say, precisely what \"handles\" one can freely adjust to govern completely the geometry and its evolution with time. The counting one can do today, with the conclusion that the geometry possesses the same count of true degrees of freedom as the electromagnetic field. The identification of the \"handles,\" or freely adjustable features of the dynamics, is less advanced for geometry than it is for electromagnetism (Box 212), but most instructive so far as it goes. By rights the identification of the degrees of freedom of the field, whether that of Einstein or that of Faraday and Maxwell, requires nothing more than knowing what must be fixed on initial and final spacelike hypersurfaces to make the appro- priate variation principle well-defined. One then has the option whether (I) to give that quantity on both hypersurfaces or (2) to give that quantity and its dynamic conjugate on one hypersurface or (3) to give the quantity on both hypersurfaces, as in (I), but go to the limit of an infinitely thin sandwich, so that one ends up specifying the quantity and its time rate of change on one hypersurface.

Alternative Approach: Count Fourier Coefficients In textbooks on field theory [see, for example, Wentzel (1949)], attention focuses on flat space- time. The electromagnetic field is decomposed by Fourier analysis into individual running waves. Instead of counting degrees of freedom per point in coordinate space, one does the equivalent: counts up degrees of freedom per point in wave- number space. Thus for each (k z ' k ll , k z ), there are two independent states of polarization. Each state of polarization requires for its description an am- plitude (\"coordinate\") and time-rate of change of amplitude (\"momentum\") at the initial time, t~. Thus the number of degrees of freedom per point in wave-number space is two for coordinates and two for momenta, in accord with what one gets by carrying out the count in coordinate space. magnetic field by Faraday's picture of lines of force (a) continuing through space without ever ending, automatic guarantee that ?B i i is every- where zero.

INITIAL-VALUE PROBLEM IN THE THIN-SANDWICH FORMULATION 531 Solve for cp.

[Misner and Wheeler (1957) deal with the additional features that come in when the space is multiply connected. Each wormhole or handle of the geometry is able to trap electric lines of force. The flux trapped in anyone wormhole defines the classical electric charge qw associated with that wormhole. One has to specify all these charges once and for all in addition to the data (2l.l18) and (21.119) in order to determine fully the dynamic evolution of the electromagnetic field. There is no geometrodynamic analog to electric charge, according to Unruh (1971).] (5) In this integration, the scalar potential cp at each subsequent time step is not to be calculated; it is to be chosen. Only when one has made this free choice definite do the dynamic equations come out with definite results for the Ai and the 7T i or $i at these successive steps. In the thin-sandwich formulation of the initial-value problem of electrodynamics, to summarize, one gives ei3 i and ~i (equivalent to (B on two nearby hypersurfaces). One chooses the Ai and Ai with much arbitrariness to represent these initial-value data. The arbitrariness having been seized on to give the initial Ai and Ai' there is no arbitrariness left in the initial cp. However, at all subsequent times the situation is just the other way around. All the arbitrariness is sopped up in the choice of the cp, leaving no arbitrariness whatever in the three Ai (as given by the integration of the dynamic equation). The situation is quite similar in geometrodynamics. One gives the beginnings of a I-parameter family of spacelike hypersurfaces; namely, Scalar potential: fixed at start; freely disposable later In ADM treatment, give 3-geometry and its time-rate of change (3)~(O) given, (2l.122) (21.123) Then (I) one picks a definite set of coordinates Xi = (x,y, z) and in terms of those coordinates finds the unique metric coefficients gij(X, y, z) that describe that 3-geom- etry. The existence of a solution is guaranteed by the circumstance that (3)~ is a Riemannian geometry. However, one could have started with different coordinates and ended up with different metric coefficients for the description of the same 3-geometry. No matter. Pick one set of coordinates, take the resulting metric co- efficients, and stick to them as giving half the required initial-value data.

The arbitrariness at the initial time all having been soaked up in this way, one expects no arbitrariness to be left in the initial Nand N i as obtained by solving (21.126) and (2I.l27). However, on all later spacelike slices, the award of the arbitrariness is reversed. The lapse and shift functions are freely disposable, but, with them once chosen, there is no arbi- trariness whatever in the six gij (and the six Kij or 7T ii )-as given by the integration of the dynamic equations (2I.l14) and (21.115). The analogy with electrodynamics is clear. There the one \"gauge-controlled\" function <p was fixed at the start by the elliptic equation (21.121), but was thereafter free. Here the four lapse and shift functions are fixed at the start by the four equations (21.126) and (2I.l27), but are thereafter free. Exercise 21.16 applies the initial-value equation (21.126) to analyze the whole evolution in time of any Friedmann universe in which one knows the equation p = p(p) connecting pressure with density.

Exercises 21.18 and 21.19 look for similar variation principles to determine the lapse and shift functions. How many degrees of freedom, or how many \"handles,\" are there in the specifica- tion of the 4-geometry that one will obtain? The metric coefficients of the initial 3-geometry provided six numbers per space point.

One can visualize these three functions as the three diagonal components of the metric in a coordinate system in which gij has been transformed to diagonal form. Ordinarily it is not useful to go further and actually spell out the analysis in any such narrowly circumscribed coordinate system. Now think of the (3)~ in question as imbedded in the (4)~ that comes out of the integrations. Moreover, think of that (4)~ as endowed with the lumps, bumps, wiggles, and waves that distinguish it from other generic 4-geometries and that make Min- kowski geometry and special cosmologies so unrepresentative. The (3)~ is a slice in that (41~. It partakes of the lumps, bumps, wiggles, and waves present in all those regions of the (4)~ that it intersects. To the extent that the (4)~ is generic, it does not allow the (3)~ to be moved to another location without becoming a different (3)~. If one tries to push the (3)~ \"forward in time\" a little in a certain locality, leaving it unchanged in location elsewhere, one necessarily changes the (3)~. By this circum- stance, one sees that the (3)~ \"carries information about time\" [Sharp (1960); Baierl- ein, Sharp, and Wheeler (1962)]. Moreover, this \"forward motion in time\" demands for its description one number per space point. It is possible to think of this number in concrete terms by imagining an arbitrary coordinate system t, x, y, z laid down in the (4)~. Then the hypersurface can be conceived as defined by the value t = l(x, y, Z) at which it cuts the typical line x, y, z. A forward movement carries it to l(x,y, Z) + 8l(x,y, Z), and changes shape and metric coefficients on (3)~ accordingly. It is usually better not to tie one's thinking down to such a concrete model, but rather to recognize as a general point of principle (1) that the location of the (3)~ in spacetime demands for its specification one datum per space point, and (2) that this datum is already willy-nilly present in the three data per spacepoint that mark any (3)~. In conclusion, there are only two data per spacepoint in a (3)~ that really tell anything about the (4)~ in which it is imbedded, or to be imbedded (as distinguished from where the (3)~ slices through that (4)~). Similarly for the other (3)~ that defines the other \"face of the sandwich,\" whether thick or thin. Thus one concludes that the specification of(3)~ and (3).i:, actually gives four net pieces of dynamic information per spacepoint about the (4)~ (all the rest of the information being \"many-fingered time,\" telling where the 3-geometries are located in that (4)~). According to this line of reasoning, geometrodynamics has the same number of dynamic degrees of free- dom as electrodynamics. One arrives at the same conclusion in quite another way through the weak-field analysis (§35.3) of gravitational waves on a flat spacetime background: the same ranges of possible wave numbers as for Maxwell waves; and for each wave number two states of polarization; and for each polarization one amplitude and one phase (the equivalent of one coordinate and one momentum). In electrodynamics in a prescribed spacetime manifold, one has a clean separation between the one time-datum per space point (when one deals with electromagnetism in the context of many-fingered time) and the two dynamic variables per spacepoint; but not so in the superspace formulation of geometrodynamics. There the two kinds of quantities are inextricably mixed together in the one concept of 3-geometry. §21.9.

Similar difficulties occur when the two faces of the thin sandwich, instead of coinciding everywhere, coincide in a limited region, be it three-dimensional, two- dimensional, or even one-dimensional (\"crossover of one face from being earlier than the other to being later\"). Thus it is enough to have (21.131) obtaining even on only a curved line in I to reject the six gij as inappropriate initial-value data.

THE TIME-SYMMETRIC AND TIME-ANTISYMMETRIC INITIAL-VALUE PROBLEMS Turn from the general initial-value problem to two special initial-value problems that lend themselves to detailed treatment, one known as the time-symmetric ini- tial-value problem, the other as the time-antisymmetric problem. A 4-geometry is said to be time-symmetric when there exists a spacelike hypersur- face :£ at all points of which the extrinsic curvature vanishes. In this case the three initial value equations (21.127) are automatically satisfied, and the fourth reduces to a simple requirement on the three-dimensional scalar curvature invariant, R = I 67Tp. (21.132) Still further simplifications result when one limits attention to empty space. Simplest of all is the case of spherical symmetry in which (21.132) yields at once the full Schwarzschild geometry at the moment of time symmetry (two asymptotically flat spaces connected by a throat), as developed in exercise 21.20. Consider a 3-geometry with metric (21.133) Call it a \"base metric.\" Consider another 3-geometry with metric (21.134) Angles are identical in the two geometries.

VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLE AND INITIAL-VALUE DATA Wave amplitude determines mass-energy: m = m(A) \"Time-antisymmetric\" initial-value data The mass m of the gravitational radiation is proportional to A2 for small values of the amplitude A. It is inversely proportional to the reduced wavelength A' = (effective wavelength/2'17) that measures the scale of rapid variations in the gravitational wave amplitude Q1(P, z) in the \"active zone.\" Thus the metric is dominated by wiggles, proportional in amplitude to A, in the active zone, and at larger distances dominated by something close to a Schwarzschild (I + 2m/r) factor in the metric. When the amplitude A is increased, a critical value is attained, A = A crit ' at which m goes to infinity and the geometry curves up into closure (\"universe closed by its own c.ontent of gravitational-wave energy\"). Further analysis and examples will be found in Wheeler (l964a), pp. 399-451, also in Wheeler (l964c).

One is the case ofa geometry endowed with a symmetry, as, for example, for the Friedmann universe of Chapter 27 or the mixmaster universe of Chapter 30 or cylindrical gravitational waves in the treatment of Kuchar (1971 a). One starts with a spacelike slice on which the glj and 'lflj have a special symmetry, and makes all future spacelike slices in a way that preserves this symmetry. The geometry on anyone of these simultaneities, though almost entirely governed by these symmetry considerations, still typically demands some countable number of parameters for its complete deter- mination, such as the radius of the Friedmann universe, or the three principal radii of curvature of the mixmaster universe. These parameters and the momenta conju- gate to them define a miniphase space. In this miniphase space, the dynamics runs its course as for any other problem of classical dynamics [see, for example, Box 30.1 and Misner (1969) for the mixmaster universe; Kuchar (1971 a) and (1972) for waves endowed with cylindrical symmetry; and Gowdy (1973) for waves with spherical symmetry]. Even the evidence for the existence of many-fingered time, most charac- teristic feature of general relativity, is suppressed as the price for never having to give attention to any spacelike slice that departs from the prescribed symmetry.

York and Brill acknowledge earlier considerations of Lichnerowicz (1944) and Bruhat (1962 and earlier papers cited there on conformal geometry and the initial-value problem). But why conformal geometry, and why pick such a special spacelike hypersurface on which to give the four dynamic data per spacepoint? Few solutions of Maxwell's equations are simpler than an infinite plane mon- ochromatic wave in Minkowski's flat spacetime, and few look more complex when examined on a spacelike slice cut through that spacetime in an arbitrary way, with local wiggles and waves, larger-scale lumps and bumps, and still larger-scale general curvatures. No one who wants to explore electrodynamics in its evolution with many-fingered time can avoid these complexities; and no one will accept these complexities of many-fingered time who wants to see the degrees of freedom of the electromagnetic field in and by themselves exhibited in their neatest form. He will pick the simplest kind of timelike slice he can find. On that simultaneity, there are two and only two field coordinates, and two and only two field momenta per spacepoint. Similarly in geometrodynamics. When one wants to untangle the degrees of freedom of the geometry, as distinct from analyzing the dynamics of the geometry, one therefore retreats from the three items of information perspacepoint that are contained in a 3-geometry [or in any other way of analyzing the geometrodynamics, as especially seen in the \"extrinsic time\" formulation of Kuchar (1971 band 1972)] and following York (1) picks the Pick hypersurface of extremal simultaneity to have maximal proper volume and (2) on this simultaneity specifies proper volume the two \"coordinate degrees of freedom per spacepoint\" that are contained in the conformal part of the 3-geometry.

This condition is satisfied in a Friedmann universe (Chapter 27) and in a Taub universe (Chapter 30) at that value of the natural time-coordinate t at which the universe switches over from expansion to recontraction.

Alternatively, one can deal with a spacetime that is topologically the product of an open 3-space by the real line (time).

Then one has many ways to fill in the interior of S with a spacelike 3-geometry I; but of all these I's, only the one that is extremal, or only the ones that are extremal, satisfy (21.144). Who is going to specify this 2-geometry with the topology of a 2-sphere? The choice of that 2-geometry is not a matter of indifference. In a given 4-geometry, distinct choices for the bounding 2-geometry will ordinarily give distinct results for the extremizing 3-geometry, and therefore different choices for the \"initial-value simultaneity,\" I. No consideration immediately thrusts itself forward that would give preference to one choice of2-geometry over another. However, no such infinity of options presents itself when one limits attention to a closed 3-geometry. Therefore it will give concreteness to the following analysis to consider it applied to a closed universe, even though the analysis surely lets itself be made well-defined in an open region by appropriate specification of boundary values on the closed 2-geometry that bounds that open region.

The appropriate measure of the \"field\" in geometrodynamics is the curvature tensor; but how can one possibly define a curvature tensor for a geometry that is as rudimentary as a conformal 3-geometry? York (1971) has raised and answered this question. The Weyl conformal-curvature tensor [equation (13.50) and exercise 13.13] is independent [in the proper @ representation], in spaces of higher dimen- sionality, of the position-dependent factor If;4 with which one multiplies the metric coefficients, but vanishes identically in three-dimensional space (exercise 21.21). One arrives at a non-zero coflfoI'!fially invariant measure of the curvature only when one goes to one higher derivative (exercise 21.22). In this way, one comes to York's York's curvature tensor curvature lJ ab , here called yab, a tensor density with these properties: yab = yba (symmetric); y~ = 0 (traceless); yalJ 1b = 0 (transverse); yab invariant with respect to position-dependent changes in the conformal scale factor; yab = 0 when and only when the 3-geometry is conformally flat.

MACH'S PRINCIPLE AND THE ORIGIN OF INERTIA In my opinion the general theory of relativity can only solve this problem [of inertia] satisfactorily if it regards the world as spatially self-enclosed. ALBERT EINSTEIN (1934), p. 52. On June 25, 1913, two years before he had discovered the geometrodynamic law that bears his name, Einstein (1913b) wrote to Ernst Mach (Figure 21.5) to express his appreciation for the inspiration that he had derived for his endeavors from Mach's ideas. In his great book, The Science of Mechanics, Mach [(1912), Chapter 2, section 6] had reasoned that it could not make sense to speak of the acceleration of a masS relative to absolute space. Anyone trying to clear physics of mystical ideas would do better, he reasoned, to speak of acceleration relative to the distant stars. But how can a star at a distance of 10 9 light-years contribute to inertia in the here and the now? To make a long story short, one can say at once that Einstein's theory (1) identifies gravitation as the mechanism by which matter there influences inertia here; (2) says that this coupling takes place on a spacelike hypersurface [in what No violation of causality, one, without a closer examination, might mistakenly think to be a violation of the despite appearances principle of causality; see Fermi (1932) for a discussion and clarification of the similar apparent paradox in electrodynamics; see also Einstein (1934), p. 84: \"Moreover I believed that I could show on general considerations a law of gravitation invariant in relation to any transformation of coordinates whatever was inconsistent with the principle of causation. These were errors of thought which cost me two years of excessively hard work, until I finally recognized them as such at the end of 1915\"]; (3) supplies in the initial-value equations of geometrodynamics a mathematical tool to describe this coupling; (4) demands closure of the geometry in space [one conjec- tures; see Wheeler (1959, 1964c) and Hanl (1962)], as a boundary condition on the initial-value equations if they are to yield a well-determined [and, we know now, a unique ]4-geometry; and (5) identifies the collection of local Lorentz frames near any point in this resulting spacetime as what one meanS quantitatively by speaking of inertia at that point. This is how one ends up with inertia here determined by density and flow of mass-energy there. There are many scores of papers in the literature on Mach's principle, including. An enormous literature many-even one by Lenin (English translation, 1927)-one could call anti-Mach- ian; and many of them make interesting points [see especially the delightful dialog by Weyl (1924a) on \"inertia and the cosmos,\" and the article (1957) and book (1961) of Sciama]. However, most of them were written before one had anything like the understanding of the initial-value problem that one possesses today.

Moreover, Mach's principle as presented here is more sharply formulated than Einstein ever put it in the literature [except for his considerations arguing that the universe must be closed; see Einstein's book (1950), pp. 107-108]; and Mach would surely have disowned it, for he could never bring himself to accept general (or even special) relativity. Nevertheless, it is a fact that Mach's principle- that matter there governs inertia here-and Riemann's idea-that the geometry of space responds to physics and participates in physics-were the two great currents of thought which Einstein, by means of his powerful equivalence principle, brought together into the present-day geometric description of gravitation and motion. \"Specify everywhere the distribution and flow of mass-energy and thereby deter- mine the inertial properties of every test particle everywhere and at all times\". Spelled out, this prescription demands (1) a way of speaking about \"everywhere\": a spacelike hypersurface I. Let one insist-in conformity with Einstein-(2) that it be a closed 3-geometry, and for convenience, not out of necessity, (3) that or be independent of position on I. (4) Specify this 3-geometry to the extent of giving the conformal metric; without the specification of at least this much 3-geometry, there would be no evident way to say \"where\" the mass-energy is to be located. (5) Give density Pbase as a function of position in this conformal 3-geometry. (6) Recognize that giving the mass-energy only of fields other than gravity is an inadequate way to specify the distribution of mass-energy throughout space. For- malistically, to be sure, the gravitational fields does not and cannot make any contribution to the source term that stands on the righthand side of Einstein's field equation. However, the analysis of gravitational waves (Chapters 18 and 35) shows that perturbations in the geometry of scale small compared t6 the scale ofobservation have to be regarded as carrying an effective content of mass-energy. Moreover, one has in a geon [Wheeler (1955); Brill and Hartle (1964); for more on gravitational-wave energy, see §35.l4] an object built out of gravitational waves (or electromagnetic waves, or neutrinos, or any combination of the three) that holds itself together for a time that is long in' comparison to the characteristic period of vibration of the waves. It looks from a distance like any other mass, even though nowhere in its interior can one put a finger and say \"here is mass.\" Therefore it, like any other mass, must have \"its influence on inertia.\" But to specify this mass, one must give enough information to characterize completely the gravitational waves on the simul- taneity I. For this, it is not enough merely to have given the two \"wave-coordinates\" per spacepoint that one possesses in (3) <. One must give in addition (7) the two \"wave-momenta\" per spacepoint that appear in York's \"momentum density ofweight 5/3,\" 7i'ab; and at the same time, as an inextricable part of this operation, one must (8) specify the density of flow of field energy. (9) Solve for the conformal factor 1/;. (10) Then one has complete initial-value data that satisfy the initial-value equa- tions of general relativity. (11) These data now known, the remaining, dynamic, components of the field equation determine the 4-geometry into the past and the future. (12) In this way, the inertial properties of every test particle are determined everywhere and at all times, giving concrete realization to Mach's principle.

Some significant progress had already been made in this direction before the present stage in one's understanding of the initial-value equa- tions. Especially interesting are results of Thirring (1918) and (1921) and of Thirring and Lense (1918), discussed by Einstein (1950) in the third edition of his book, The Meaning of Relativity. Consider a bit of solid ground near the geographic pole, and a support erected there, and from it hanging a pendulum. Though the sky is cloudy, the observer watches the track of the Foucault pendulum as it slowly turns through. 360 0 • Then the sky clears and, miracle of miracles, the pendulum is found to be swinging all the time on an arc fixed relative to the far-away stars. If \"mass there governs inertia here,\" as envisaged by Mach, how can this be? Enlarge the question. By the democratic principle that equal masses are created equal, the mass of the earth must come into the bookkeeping of the Foucault pendulum. Its plane of rotation must be dragged around with a slight angular velocity, wdrag' relative to the so-called \"fixed stars.\" How much is wdrag? And how much would W drag be if the pendulum were surrounded by a rapidly spinning spherical shell of mass M and radius R shell ' turning at angular velocity Wshell? Einstein's theory says that inertia is a manifestation of the geometry of spacetime. It also says that geometry is affected by the presence of matter to an extent propor- tional to the factor G/c 2 = 0.742 X 10- 28 cm/g. Simple dimensional considerations leave no room except to say that the rate of drag is proportional to a expression of the form §21.12.

Lense and Thirring [(1918) and (1921)], starting with a flat background spacetime manifold, calculated in the weak-field approximation of Chapter 18 the effect of the moving current of mass on the metric. Expressed in polar coordinates, the metric acquires a non-zero coefficient g¢t. Inserted into the equation of geodesic motion, this off- diagonal metric coefficient gives rise to a precession. This precession (defined here about an axis parallel to the axis of rotation, not about the local vertical) is given by an expression of the form (21.155), where the precession factor k has the value k = 4/3. (21.156) There is a close parallelism between the magnetic component of the Maxwell field and the precession component of the Einstein field. In neither field does a source at rest produce the new kind of effect when acting on a test particle that is also at rest. One designs a circular current of charge to produce a magnetic field; and a test charge, in order to respond to this magnetic field, must also be in motion. Similarly here: no pendulum vibration means no pendulum precession. Moreover, the direction of the precession depends on where the pendulum is, relative to the rotating shell of mass. The precession factor k has the following values:"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"y 548 21. VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLE AND INITIAL-VALUE DATA k = 4/3 for pendulum anywhere inside rotating shell of mass; k = 4/3 for pendulum at North or South pole; k = -2/3 for pendulum just outside the rotating shell at its equator. (21.157) This position-dependence of the drag, W drag , makes still more apparent the analogy with magnetism, where the field of a rotating charged sphere points North at the center of the sphere, and North at both poles, but South at the equator. Whether the Foucault pendulum is located in imagination at the center of the earth or in actuality at the North pole, the order of magnitude of the expected drag is m earth 0.44 cm I radian W drag - -R-- wearth - -6-X--1O- g -c-m- --13-7-0-0-se-c earth - 5 X 10- 14 rad/sec, (21.158) The \"sum for inertia\" too small to allow detection, let alone actual measurement, by any device so far built-but perhaps measurable by gyroscopes now under construction (§40.7). By contrast, near a rapidly spinning neutron star or near a black hole endowed with substantial angular momentum, the calculated drag effect is not merely detectable; it is even important (see Chapter 33 on the physics of a rotating black hole). The distant stars must influence the natural plane of vibration of the Foucault pendulum as the nearby rotating shell of matter does, provided that the stars are not so far away (r - radius of universe) that the curyature of space begins to introduce substantial corrections into the calculation of Thirring and Lense. In other words, no reason is apparent why all masses should not be treated on the same footing, so that (21.158) more appropriately, if also somewhat symbolically, reads m shell \"\" m\"star\" wplaneof - ~ w shell + L... --- W\"star'\" vibration shell far-away r\"star\" of Foucault \"stars\" pendulum (21.159) Moreover, when there is no nearby shell of matter, or when it has negligible effects, the plane of vibration of the pendulum, if experience is any guide, cannot turn with respect to the frame defined by the far-away \"stars.\" In this event WFoucault must be identical with w stars ; or the \"sum for inertia,\" '\" m\"star\" muniverse L... ---- far-away r\"star\" r universe \"stars\" (21.160) must be of the order of unity. Just such a relation of approximate identity between the mass content of the universe and its radius at the phase of maximum expansion is a characteristic feature of the Friedman model and other simple models ofa closed universe (Chapters 27 and 30). In this respect, Einstein's theory of Mach's principle exhibits a satisfying degree of self-consistency."},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"At phases of the dynamics of the universe other than the stage of maximum expansion, runiverse can become arbitrarily small compared to muniver~e' Then the ratio (21.160) can depart by powers of ten from unity. Regardless of this circum- stance, one has no option but to understand that the effective value of the \"sum for inertia\" is still unity after all corrections have been made for the dynamics of contraction or expansion, for retardation, etc. Only so can WFoucault retain its inescap- able identity with wfar-away stars' Fortunately, one does not have to pursue the theology of the \"sum for inertia\" to the uttermost of these sophistications to have a proper account of inertia. Mach's idea that mass there determines inertia here has its complete msHhematical account in Einstein's geometrodynamic law, as already spelled ont. For-the first strong-field analysis of the dragging of the inertial reference system in the context of relativistic cosmology, see Brill and Cohen (1966) and Cohen and Brill (1967); see also §33.4 for dragging by a rotating black hole. Still another clarification is required of what Mach's principle means and how it is used. The inertial properties of a test particle are perfectly well-determined when that particle is moving in ideal Minkowski space. \"Point out, please,\" the anti-Ma- chian critic says, \"the masses that are responsible for this inertia.\" In answer, recall that Einstein's theory includes not only the geometrodynamic law, but also, in Einstein's view, the boundary condition that the universe be closed. Thus the section of spacetime that is flat is to be viewed, not as infinite, but as part of a closed universe. (For a two-dimensional analog, fill a rubber balloon with water and set it on a glass tabletop and look at it from underneath). The part of the universe that is curved acquires its curvature by reason of its actual content of mass-energy or-if animated only by gravitational waves-by reason of its effective content of mass-energy. This mass-energy, real or effective, is to be viewed as responsible for the inertial properties of the test particle that at first sight looked all alone in the universe. It in no way changes the qualitative character of the result to turn attention to a model universe where the region of Minkowski flatness, and all the other linear dimensions of the universe, have been augmented tenfold (\"ten times larger balloon; ten times larger face\"). The curvature and density of the ~urved part of the model universe are down by a factor of 100, the volume is up by a factor of 1,000, the mass is up by a factor of 10; but the ratio of mass to radius, or the \"sum for inertia\" (the poor man's substitute for a complete initial-value calculation) is unchanged. Einstein acknowledged a debt of parentage for his theory to Mach's principle (Figure 21.5). It is therefore only justice that Mach's principle should in return today owe its elucidation to Einstein's theory. §21.12.

That a discontinuity in the curvature tensor can propagate_with the speed of light is a reminder that all gravitational effects, like all electromagnetic effects, obey a causal law. The initial-value data on a spacelike initial-value hypersurface uniquely determine the resulting spacetime geometry [see the work of Cartan, Stellmacher, Lichnerowicz, and Bruhat (also under the names Foures-Bruhat and Choquet-Bru- hat) and others cited and summarized in the article of Bruhat (1962)] but determine it in a way consistent with causality. Thus a change in these data throughout a limited region of the initial value 3-geometry makes itself felt on a slightly later hypersurface solely in a region that is also limited, and only a little larger than the original region. When one turns from classical dynamics to quantum dynamics, one sees new reason to focus attention on a spacelike initial-value hypersurface: the observables at different points on such a hypersurface commute with one another; i.e., are in principle simultaneously observable. Not every four-dimensional manifold admits a global singularity-free spacelike hypersurface. Those manifolds that do admit such a hypersurface have more to do with physics, it is possible to believe, than those that do not. Even in a manifold that does admit a spacelike hypersurface, attention has been given sometimes, in the context of classical theory, to initial-value data on a hyper- surface that is not spacelike but \"characteristic,\" in the sense that it accomodates null geodesics [see, for example, Sachs (1964) and references cited there]. It is typical in such situations that one can predict the future but not the past, or predict the past but not the future."},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"Children ofJight and children of darkness is the vision of physics that emerges from this chapter, as from other branches of physics.

CHAPTER 22 THERMODYNAMICS, HYDRODYNAMICS, ELECTRODYNAMICS, GEOMETRIC OPTICS, AND KINETIC THEORY §22.1. THE WHY OF THIS CHAPTER r Astrophysical applications of gravitation theory are the focus of the rest ofthis book, except for Chapters 41-44. Each application-stars, star clusters, cosmology, collapse, black holes, gravitational waves, solar-system experiments-can be pursued by itself at an elementary level, without reference to the material in this chapter. But deep understanding of the applications requires a prior grasp of thermodynamics, hydro- dynamics, electrodynamics, geometric optics, and kinetic theory, all in the context of curved spacetime. Hence, most Track-2 readers will want to probe these subjects at this point. §22.2. THERMODYNAMICS IN CURVED SPACETIME* Consider, for concreteness and simplicity, the equilibrium thermodynamics of a perfect fluid with fixed chemical composition (\"simple perfect fluid\")-for example, the gaseous interior of a collapsing supermassive star. The thermodynamic state of a fluid element, as it passes through an event '3'0' can be characterized by various thermodynamic potentials, such as n, P, p, T, s, fL. The numerical value of each potential at '3'0 is measured in the proper reference frame (§ 13.6) of an observer who moves with the fluid element-i.e., in the fluid element's \"rest frame.\" Despite • For more detailed treatments of this subject see, e.g .• Stueckelberg and Wanders (1953), Kluitenberg and de Groot (1954), Meixner and Reik (1959), and references cited therein: see also the references on hydrodynamics cited at the beginning of §22.3, and the references on kinetic theory cited at the beginning of §22.6. This chapter is entirely Track 2. No earlier Track-2 material is needed as prepara~ion for it, but Chapter 5 (stress-energy tensor) will be helpful. §22.5 (geometric optics) is needed as preparation for Chapter 34 (singularities and global methods). The rest of the chapter is not needed as preparation for any later chapter; but it will be extremely helpful in most applications of gravitation theory (Chapters 23-40). Thermodynamic potentials are defined in rest frame of fluid"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"558 22. THERMODYNAMICS. HYDRODYNAMICS, .... AND KINETIC THEORY Definitions of thermodynamic potentials Definition of \"simple fluid\" Law of baryon conservation this use of rest frame to measure the potentials. the potentials are frame-independent functions (scalar fields). At the chosen event ~J~o, a given potential (e.g., n) has a unique value 11(~fo): so n is a perfectly good frame-independent function. The values of 11, p, p, T, s, fL measure the following quantities in the rest frame of the fluid element: n, baryon number density: i.e., number of baryons per unit three-dimensional volume of rest frame, with antibaryons (if any) counted negatively. p, density of total mass-energy; i.e., total mass-energy (including rest mass, ther- mal energy, compressional energy, etc.) contained in a unit three-dimensional volume of the rest frame. p, isotropic pressure in rest frame. T, temperature in rest frame. s, entropy per baryon in rest frame. (The entropy per unit volume is 11S.) fL, chemical potential of baryons in rest frame [see equation (22.8) below]. The chemical composition of the fluid (number density of hydrogen molecules, number density of hydrogen atoms, number density of free protons and electrons, number density of photons, number density of 238U nuclei, number density of A hyperons ... ) is assumed to be fixed uniquely by two thermodynamic variables-e.g., by the total number density of baryons n and the entropy per baryon s. In this sense the fluid is a \"simple fluid.\" Simple fluids occur whenever the chemical abundances are \"frozen\" (reaction rates too slow to be important on the time scales of interest; for example, in a super massive star except during explosiv~ burning and except at temperatures high enough for e- - e+ pair produetion).- Simple fluids also occur in the opposite extreme of complete chemical equilibrium (reaction rates fast enough to maintain equilibrium despite changing density and entropy; for example, in neutron stars, where high pressures speed up all reactions). When one examines nuclear burning in a nonconvecting star, or explosive nuclear burning, or pair production and neutrino energy losses at high temperatures, one must usually treat the fluid as \"multicomponent\" Then one introduces a number density n J and a chemical potential fLJ for each chemical species with abundance not fixed by n and s. For further details see, e.g., Zel'dovich and Novikov (1971). The most fundamental law of thermodynamics-even more fundamental than the \"first\" and \"second\" laws-is baryon conservation. Consider a fluid element whose moving walls are attached to the fluid so that no baryons flow in or out As the fluid element moves through spacetime, deforming along the way, its volume V changes. But the number of baryons in it must remain fixed, so d dr (nV) =0. (22.1 ) The changes in volume are produced by the flow of neighboring bits of fluid away from or toward each other-explicitly (exercise 22.1) dV/dr = (V' u)v, (22.2)"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"where u = d/ dr is the 4-velocity of the fluid.

(nu); dr Vdr U i.e., V· S = 0, S = nu = baryon number-flux vector (22.3) (22.4) (see §5.4 and exercise 5.3.) Moreover, this abstract geometric version of the law must be just as valid in curved spacetime as in flat (equivalence principle). Note the analogy with the law of charge conservation, V· J = 0, in electrody- namics (exercise 3.16) and with the local law of energy-momentum conservation, V· T = 0 (§§5.9 and 16.2). In a very deep sense, the forms of these three laws are dictated by the theorem of Gauss (§5.9, and Boxes 5.3, 5.4). The second law of thermodynamics states that, in flat spacetime or in curved, entropy can be generated but not destroyed. Apply this law to a fluid element of volume V containing a fixed number of baryons N. The entropy it contains is S = Ns = nsV. Entropy may flow in and out across the faces of the fluid element (\"heat flow\" between neighboring fluid elements); but for simplicity assume it does not; or if it does, assume that it flows too slowly to have any significance for the problem at hand. Then the entropy in the fluid element can only increase: Second law of thermodynamics d(nsV)/dr ~ 0 when negligible entropy is exchanged between neighboring fluid elements; i.e. [combine with equation (22.1)] ds/dr ~ 0 (no entropy exchange). (22.5) So long as the fluid element remains in thermodynamic equilibrium, its entropy will actually be conserved [\" =\" in equation (22.5)]; but at a shock wave, where equilib- Shock waves and heat flow rium is momentarily broken, the entropy will increase (conversion of \"relative kinetic energy\" of neighboring fluid elements into heat). [For discussions of heat flow in special and general relativity, see Exercise 22.7. For discussion of shock waves, see Taub (1948), de Hoffman and Teller (1950), Israel (1960), May and White (1967), Zel'dovich and Rayzer (1967), Lichnerowicz (1967, 1971), and Thorne (l973a).] The first law of thermodynamics, in the proper reference frame of a fluid element, First law of thermodynamics is identical to the first law in flat spacetime (\"principle of equivalence\"); and in flat spacetime the first law is merely the law of energy conservation: d( ener gy in a volume element containing) d( I ) T J( t ) = - p vO ume + U' en ropy ; a fixed number.

For a simple fluid, the values of two potentials, e.g., nand s, fix all the others uniquely; so any change in p must be determined uniquely by the changes in nand s. It matters not whether the changes are measured along the world line of a given fluid element, or in some other direction. Thus, the \"d\" in the first law can 'be interpreted as an exterior derivative p+p dp = --dn + nTds; n (22.6) Pressure and temperature calculated from p(n, s) and the changes along a given direction in the fluid (along a given tangent vec- tor v) can be written p+p VvP = (dp, v) = -- (dn, v) + nT(ds, v) n Equation (22.6) lends itself to interpretation in two -opposite senses: as a way to deduce the density of mass-energy of the medium from information about pressure (as a function of nand s) and temperature (as a function of nand s); and conversely, as a way to deduce the two functions p(n, s) and T(n, s) from the one function p(n, s).

Other choices of the \"primary thermodynamlc potential\" are appropriate under other circum- stances (see Box 22.1).

The reduction will be performed in the text using abstract notation; the reader is encouraged to repeat the reduction using index notation. The stress-energy tensor for a perfect fluid, in curved spacetime as in flat (equival- ence principle!), is T = (p + p)u ® u + pg. (22.9) (See §5.5.) Its divergence is readily calculated using the chain rule; using the \"com- patibility relation between 9 and V,\" Vg = 0; using the identity (Vp)' 9 = Vp (which one readily verifies in index notation); and using 0= V· T = [V(p + p)' uju + [(p + p) V· uju + [(p + p)uj' Vu + (Vp)' 9 l[divergence on first slotj = [Vup + VuP + (p + p)V' uju + (p + p) Vuu + Vp.

V u u 2 = 0 because u 2 -1): 0= u'(V' T) = -[Vup + VuP + (p + p)V'uj + VuP = - VuP - (p + p) V· u.

(22.11 b) There is no reason for surprise at this result. To insist on thermodynamic equilibrium and to demand that the entropy remain constant is to require zero exchange of heat between one element of the fluid and another. But the stress-energy tensor (22.9) recognizes that heat exchange is absent. Any heat exchange would show up as an energy flux term in T (Ex. 22.7); but no such term is present. Consequently, when one studies local energy conservation by evaluating u' ('V . T) = 0, the stress-energy tensor reports that no heat flow is occurring-i.e. that ds/dr = O. Three components of V • T = 0 remain: the components orthogonal to the fluid's 4-velocity.

At each event in spacetime there is a wave vector; and these wave vectors, tacked end-on-end, form a family of curves-the \"light rays\" or simply \"rays\"-whose tangent vector is k. The rays, like their tangent vector, lie both in and perpendicular to the surfaces of constant phase. The affine parameter A of a ray (not to be confused with wavelength = 2 'IT A\") satisfies k = d/dA; therefore it is given by A = t/ko + constant = t/w + constant, where t is proper time along the ray as measured, not by the ray itself (its proper time is zero!), but by the local Lorentz observer who sees angular frequency w. Thus, while w is a frame-dependent quantity and t is also a frame-dependent quantity, their quotient t/w when measured along the ray (not off the ray) is the frame-inde- pendent affine parameter. For a particle it is possible and natural to identify the affine parameter A with proper time T. For a light ray this identification is unnatural and impossible. The lapse of proper time along the ray is identically zero. The springing up of A to take the place of the vanished T gives one a tool to do what one might not have suspected to be possible.

In this respect, it is to be distinguished from the so-called \"luminosity distance\" which is sometimes introduced in dealing with the propagation of radiation through curved spacetime, and which is defined by the spreading apart of two or more light rays coming from a common source. Maxwell's equations as explored in the text [equation (22.28')] guarantee that the complex polarization vector f is perpendicular to the wave vector k and that, therefore, it lies in a surface of constant phase (see drawing).

Theoretical analyses of these and many other problems are unmanageable, if they attempt to keep track of the motion of every single star or photon. But a statistical description gives accurate results and is powerful. Moreover, for most problems in astrophysics and cosmology, the simplest of statistical descriptions-one ignoring collisions-is adequate.

The model-building in this book will follow the tradition of theoretical physics. Each Part (stars, universe, collapse, ... ) will begin with the most oversimplified model conceivable, and will subsequently add only those additional touches of realism necessary to make contact with the least complex of actual physical systems. The result will be a tested intellectual framework, ready to support and organize the additional complexities demanded by greater realism. Greater realism will not be attempted in this book. But the reader seeking it could start in no better place than the two-volume treatise on Relativistic Astrophysics by Zel'dovich and Novikov (1971, 1974). Begin, now, with models for relativistic stars. As a major simplification, insist (initially) that all stars studied be static. Thereby exclude not only exploding and pulsating stars, but even quiescent ones with stationary rotational motions. From the static assumption, plus a demand that the star be made of \"perfect fluid\" (no shear stresses allowed!), plus Einstein's field equations, it probably follows that the star is spherically symmetric. However, nobody has yet given a proof.

The r coordinate, however, is also at one's disposal (as long as one chooses it in a way that respects spherical symmetry; thus not r' = r + cos 8). One can turn this freedom to advan- tage by introducing a new coordinate r'(r) defined by r' = R(r).

By choosing the integrating factor e~ to be just e~ = a(r), one sees that t' = t + flb(r)/a(r») dr is the integral of (23.5); thus the required t' coordinate always exists, no matter what the functions a(r). b(r). c(r), and R(r) in equation (23.4) may be."},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"§23.3. PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION OF SCHWARZSCHILD COORDINATES 595 With this choice of the radial coordinate, and with the primes dropped, equation (23.3) reduces to (23.7) a line element with just two unknown functions, l/J(r) and A(r). This coordinate system and metric have been used in most theoretical models for relativistic stars since the pioneering work of Schwarzschild (l916b), Tolman (1939), and Oppen- heimer and Volkoff (1939). These particular coordinates are sometimes called \"cur- vature coordinates\" and sometimes \"Schwarzschild coordinates.\" The central idea of these coordinates, in a nutshell, is (Schwarzschild r-coordinate) = (proper circum- ference)/2'7T. For a more rigorous proof that in any static spherical system Schwarzschild (3) derived more rigorously coordinates can be introduced, bringing the metric into the simple form (23.7), see Box 23.3 at the end of this chapter. Exercise 23.1. ISOTROPIC COORDINATES AND NEWTONIAN LIMIT EXERCISE An alternative set of coordinates sometimes used for static, spherical systems is the \"isotropic coordinate system\" (t, r, 8, cf».

PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION OF SCHWARZSCHILD COORDINATES In general relativity, because the use of arbitrary coordinates is permitted, the physical significance of statements about tensor or vector components and other quantities is not always obvious. There are, however, some situations where the interpretation is almost as straightforward as in special relativity. The most obvious example is the center point of a local inertial coordinate system, where the principle of equivalence aliows one to treat all local quantities (quantities not involving spacetime curvature) exactly as in special relativity. Schwarzschild coordinates for a spherical system turn out to be a second example. One's first reaction when meeting a new metric should be to examine it, not in order to learn about the gravitational field, for which the curvature tensor is more The form of any metric can reveal the nature of the coordinates being used"},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"596 23.

(Are they, for instance, locally inertial at some point?) The names given to the coordinates have no intrinsic significance. A coordinate transformation t' = O. r' = 9, 0' = r, 9' = t is perfectly permissible, and has no influence on the physics or the mathematics of a relativistic problem. The only thing it affects is easy communication between the investigator who adopts it and his colleagues. Thus the names trOcp for the Schwarzschild coordinates (23.7) provide a mnemonic device pointing out the geometric content of the coordinates.* In particular, the names 0, ¢ are justified by the fact that on each two-dimensional surface of constant rand t, the distance between two nearby events is given by ds 2 = r 2 dil 2 , as befits standard 0, cp coordinates on a sphere of radius r. The area of this two-dimensional sphere is clearly A = f(rdO)(rsinOdcp) = 4'7Tr 2 ; (23.9) (2) r measures surface area of sphere hence, the metric (23.7) tells how to measure the r coordinate that it employs. One can merely measure (in proper length units) the area A of the sphere, composed of all points rotationally equivalent to the point tj' for which the value r('!J) is desired; and one can then calculate r('!J) = (proper are~ of S p herej4'7T)l/2. through pomt tj' (23.9') (3) t has 3 special geometric properties The Schwarzschild coordinates have been picked for convenience, and not for the ease with which one could build a coordinate-measuring machine. This makes it more difficult to design a machine to measure t than mllchines to measure r, 0, cp. The geometric properties of t on which a measurIng device can be based are: (1) the time-independent distances (ogap/Ot = 0) between world lines of constant r, 0, cp; (2) the orthogonality (gtr = gtn = gt</> = 0) of these world lines to the t = constant hypersurfaces; and (3) a labeling of these hypersurfaces by Minkowski (special relativistic) coordinate time at spatial infinity, where spacetime becomes flat. This labeling produces a constraint cP(oo) = 0 (23.10) (4) description of a \"machine\" to measure t in the metric (23.7). [Mathematically, this constraint is imposed by a simple rescaling transformation t' = e<l>('X 1 t , and by then dropping the prime.] One \"machine\" design which constructs (mentally) such a t coordinate, and in the process measures it, is the following. Observers using radar sets arrange to move along the coordinate lines r, 0, cp = const. They do this by adjusting their velocities until each finds that the radar echos from his neighbors, or from \"benchmark\" reference points in the asymptotically flat space, require the same round-trip time at each repetition. Equivalently, each returning echo must show zero doppler shift; *For an example of misleading names. consider those in the equation ds 2 = _ e2~(9') d<p'2 + e 2A (I1') d!J'2 + 8'2 (dt'2 + sin 2 t' dr'2), which is equivalent to equation (23.7). but employs the coordinates t' = 8, r' = <p, 8' = r, <p' = t."},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":"it must return with the same frequency at which it was sent out. Next a master clock is set up near spatial infinity (far from the star). It is constructed to measure proper time-which, for it, is Minkowski time \"at infinity\"-and to emit a standard one- Hertz signal. Each observer adjusts the rate of his \"coordinate clock\" to beat in time with the signals he receives from the master clock. To set the zero of his \"coordinate clock,\" now that its rate is correct, he synchronizes with the master clock, taking account of the coordinate time ~t required for radar signals to travel from the master to him. [To compute the transit time, he assumes that for radar signals (treflection - temission) = (treturn - treflection) = ~t, so that the echo is obtained by time-inversion about the reflection event. This time-reversal invariance distinguishes the time t in the metric (23.7) from the more general t coordinates allowed by equation (23.4).] Each observer moving along a coordinate line (r, 8, cp = const.) now has a clock that measures coordinate time t in his neighborhood. The above discussion identifies the Schwarzschild coordinates of equation (23.7) by their intrinsic geometric properties. Not only are rand t radial and time variables, respectively (in that a/or and a/at are spacelike and timelike, respectively, and are orthogonal also to the spheres defined by rotational symmetry), but they have particular properties [4'17r 2 = surface area; ogJl.lot = 0; a/or' a/at = grt = 0; a/at· a/at = gtt = -1 at r = 00] that distinguish them from other possible coordi- nate choices [r' = f(r), t' = t + F(r)].

DESCRIPTION OF MAnER INSIDE A STAR 597 Other coordinates are possible, but Schwarzschild are particularly simple §23.4. DESCRIPTION OF THE MATTER INSIDE A STAR To high precision, the matter inside any star is a perfect fluid. (Shear stresses are negligible, and energy transport is negligible on a \"hydrodynamic time scale.\") Thus, it is reasonable in model building to describe the matter by perfect-fluid parameters: Material inside star to be idealized as perfect fluid p = p(r) = density of mass-energy in rest-frame of fluid; p = p(r) = isotropic pressure in rest-frame of fluid; n = n(r) = nu,?ber density of baryons in rest-frame of fluid; u Jl = uJl(r) = 4-velocity of fluid; TJlP = (p + p)uJluP + pgJlP = stress-energy tensor of fluid.

DESCRIPTION OF MATTER INSIDE A STAR 599 There exist three important applications of the theory of relativistic stars: neutron stars, white dwarfs, and supermassive stars (stars with M ~ 10 3 M 0 , which may exist according to theory, but the existence of which has never yet been confirmed by observation). In all three cases, happily, the passage from p = p(n, s), p(n, s), to p = p(n), p = p(n), is trivial. Consider first a neutron star. Though hot by ordinary standards, a neutron star is so cold by any nuclear-matter scale of temperatures that essentially all its thermal degrees of freedom are frozen out (\"degenerate gas\"; \"quantum fluid\"). It is not important that a detailed treatment of the substance of a neutron star is beyond the capability of present theory (allowance for the interaction between baryon and baryon; production at sufficiently high pressures of hyperons and mesons). The simple fact is that one is dealing with matter at densities comparable to the density of matter in an atomic nucleus (2 X 10 14 g/cm 3 ) and higher. Everything one knows about nuclear matter [see, for example, Bohr and Mottelson (1969)] tells one that it is degenerate, and that one can estimate in order of magnitude its degeneracy temperature by treating it as though it were an ideal Fermi neutron gas. (In a normal atomic nucleus, a little more than 50 per cent of all baryons are neutrons, the rest are protons; in a neutron star, as many as 99 per cent are neutrons.) When approxi- mating the neutron-star matter as an ideal Fermi neutron gas, one considers the neutrons to occupy free-particle quantum states, with two particles of opposite spin in each occupied state, and a sharp drop from 100 per cent occupancy of quantum states to empty states when the particle energy rises to the level of the \"Fermi energy\" [for more on such an ideal Fermi gas, see Kittel, Section 19 (1958); or at an intro- ductory level, see Sears, Section 16-5 (1953)]. In matter at nuclear density, the Fermi energy is of the order EFermi - 30 MeV or 3 X 1011 K; and at higher density the temperature required to unfreeze the degeneracy is even greater. In other words, for matter at and above nuclear densities, already at zero temperature the kinetic energy of the particles (governed by the Pauli exclusion principle and by their Fermi energy) is a primary source of pressure. Nuclear forces make a large correction to this pressure, but for T ~ 30 MeV = 3 X 1011 K, energies of thermal agitation do not. A star, in collapsing from a normal state to a neutron-star state (see Chapter 24), emits a huge flux of neutrinos at temperatures ~ 10 10 K, and thereby cools to T ~ 3 X lOll K within a few seconds after formation. Consequently, in all neutron stars older than a few seconds one can neglect thermal contributions to the pressure and density; i.e., one can set Justification for idealized equation of state: (1) in neutron stars p(n, s) = p(n, S = 0) = p(n), p(n, s) = p(n, S = 0) = p(n). A white dwarf is similar, except that here electrons rather than neutrons are the (2) in white dwarfs source of Fermi gas pressure and degeneracy.

(3) in supermassive stars EXERCISE Five equations needed to determine 5 stellar-structure functions: CP, A, p, p, n In a supermassive star (see Chapter 24), the situation is quite different. There temperature and entropy are almost the whole story, so far as pressure and energy density are concerned. However, convection keeps the star stirred up and produces a uniform entropy distribution S = const. independent of radius; so one can write p(n, s) = ps(n), p(n, s) = p.(n). l{ functions depending on J-1 un.iform entropy per baryon, s, In the star In all three cases-neutron stars, white dwarfs, supermassive stars-one regards the relations p(n) and p(n) as \"equations of state\"; and having specified them, one can calculate the star's structure without further reference to its thermal properties.

EQUATIONS OF STRUCTURE The structure of a relativistic star is determined by five functions of radius r: the metric functions ifJ(r), A(r), the pressure p(r), the density of mass-energy p(r), and the number density of baryons, n(r). Hence, to determine the structure uniquely, one needs five equations of structure, plus boundary conditions. Two equations of structure, the equations of state p(n) and p(n), are already in hand. The remaining three must be the essential content of the Einstein field equations and of the law of local energy-momentum conservation, TP.·;. = O. One knows that the law of local energy-momentum conservation for the fluid follows as an identity from the Einstein field equations. Without loss of information,"},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"one can therefore impose all ten field equations and ignore local energy-momentum conservation.

In the two theories the magnitudes of the acceleration, whether \"actually taking place\" (Einstein theory) or \"trying to take place\" (Newtonian theory), are the same to lowest order (but opposite in direction); so it is no surprise that (23.17) and (23.17N) differ only in detail. Turn next to the Einstein field equation. Here, as is often the case, the components of the field equation in the fluid's orthonormal frame [equations (23.l5a,b)] are simpler than the components in the coordinate basis. One already knows the stress- energy tensor Tafi in the orthonormal frame [equation (23.15d)]; and Track-2 readers have already calculated the Einstein tensor Gafi (exercise 14.13; Track-l readers will face the task at the end of this section, exercise 23.4).

Spherical symmetry allows one to select a distribution of the total mass-energy that is physically reasonable. In Schwarzschild coordinates, it is defined by r \"total mass-energy inside radius r\" = m(r) = I 4'17r 2 p dr. (1) . 0 The fully convincing argument for this definition is found only by considering a generalization of it to time-dependent spherically symmetric stars (pulsating, col- lapsing, or exploding stars; see Chapters 26 and 32, and especially exercise 32.7). For them one finds that the mass-energy m associated with a given ball of matter (fixed baryon number) can change in time only to the extent that locally measurable energy fluxes can be detected at the boundary of the ball. [Such energy fluxes could be the power expended by pressure forces against the moving boundary surface, or heat fluxes, or radiation (photon or neutrino) fluxes. But since spherically symme- tric gravitational waves do not exist (Chapters 35 and 36), neither physical intuition nor Einstein's equations require that problems oflocalizing gravitational-wave energy be faced.] Thus the energy m is localized, not by a mathematical convention, but by the circumstance that transfer of energy (with this definition of m) is detectable by local measurements. [For the mathematical details of m(r, t) in the time-depend- ent case, see Misner and Sharp (1964), Misner (1965), and exercise 32.7.] In addition to the critical \"local energy flux\" property of m(r) described above, there are three further properties that verify its identification as mass-energy.

Therefore, as one proceeds deeper into the star, one finds pressure rising faster than Newtonian gravitation theory would predict. Moreover, this rise in pressure is in a certain sense \"self-regenerative.\" The more the pressure goes up, the larger the pressure-correction terms become in the numerator of (23.23); and the larger these terms become, the faster is the further rise of the pressure as one probes still deeper into the star. The geometric factor [l - 2m(r)/r]1/2 in the denominator of (23.23) further augments this regenerative rise of pressure towards the center. It is appropriate to summarize the situation in short-hand terms by saying that general relativity predicts stronger gravitational forces in a stationary body than does Newtonian theory. These forces, among their other important effects, can pull certain white-dwarf stars and super- massive stars into gravitational collapse under circumstances (see Chapter 24) where Newtonian theory would have predicted stable hydrostatic equilibrium. As the most elementary indication that a new factor has surfaced in the analysis of stability, note that no star in hydrostatic equilibrium can ever have 2m(r)/r 2: 1 (see Box 23.2 for one illustration and §23.8 for discussion), a phenomenon alien to Newtonian theory. Now in hand are five equations of structure [two equations of state (23.16); equation (23.19), expressing m(r) = ~r(1 - e- 211 ) as a volume integral of p; the source Comparison of pressure gradients in Newtonian and relativistic stars Equations of stellar structure summarized"},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"606 23.

First specify the equations of state (23.28c,d) and a value of the central pressure, Pc' Also specify an arbitrary (later to be renorrnalized) value, tP o , for tP(r = 0). The boundary conditions p(r = 0) = Pc' tP(r = 0) = tP o , m(r = 0) = 0 are sufficient to determine uniquely the . solution to the coupled equations (23.28). Integrate these coupled equations outward from r = 0 until the pressure vanishes.

Having reached the surface, renormalize tP by adding a constant to it everywhere, so that it obeys the boundary condition (23.28e). The result is a relativistic stellar model whose structure functions tP, m, P, p, n satisfy the equations of structure. Notice that for any fixed choice of the equations of state p = p(n), p = p(n), the stellar models form a one-parameter sequence (parameter Pc)' Once the central pressure has been specified, the model is determined uniquely.

How- ever, analytic solutions exist for various idealized and ad hoc equations of state. One of the most useful analytic solutions [Karl Schwarzschild (1916b)] describes a star of uniform density, p = Po = constant for all p. (1) It is not necessary to indulge in the fiction of \"an incompressible fluid\" to accept this model as interesting. Incompressibility would imply a speed of sound, v = (dpjdp)1/2, of unlimited magnitude, therefore in excess of the speed of light, and therefore in contradiction with a central principle of special relativity (\"principle of causality\") that no physical effect can be propagated at a speed v > 1. (If a source could cause an effect so quickly in one local Lorentz frame, then there would exist another local Lorentz frame in which the effect would occur before the source had acted!)

THE SPACETIME GEOMETRY FOR A STATIC STAR Surface area of spheres, 4r.r 2 : (1) increases monotonically from center of star outward For a highly relativistic star, the spacetime geometry departs strongly from Euclid- Lorentz flatness. Consequently, there is no a priori reason to expect that the surface area 4'17r 2 , and hence also the radial coordinate r, will increase monotonically as one moves from the center of the star outward. Fortunately, the equations of stellar structure guarantee that r will increase monotonically from 0 at the star's center to 00 at an infinite distance away from the star, so long as p 2: 0 and so long as the star is static (equilibrium). The mono tonicity of r can be seen as follows. Introduce as a new radial coordinate proper distance, 1, from the center of the star. By virtue of expression (23.27') for the metric, 1 and r are related by dr = +(1 - 2m/r)l/2 d1. (23.29) Note that r is zero at the center of the star (where m ex r 3 ), and note that r is always nonnegative by definition. Therefore r must at first increase with 1 as one moves outward from 1 = 0; r(l) can later reach a maximum and start decreasing only at a point where 2m/r becomes unity [see equation (23.29)]. Such a behavior can and does happen in a closed model universe, a 3-sphere of uniform density and radius a, where r(l) = a sin (l/a) [see Chapter 27; especially the embedding diagram of Box 27.2(A)]. However, the field equations demand that such a system be dynamic. Here, on the contrary, attention is limited to a system where conditions are static. In such a system, the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium (23.28b) applies. Then the pressure gradient is given by an expression with the factor [l - 2m(r)/r] in its denominator. If 2m/r approaches unity with increasing 1 in some region of the star, the pressure gradient"},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"there becomes so large that one comes to the point p = 0 (surface of the star) before one comes to any point where 2m(r)/r might attain unit value. Moreover, after the surface of the star is passed, m remains constant, m(r) = M, and 2m(r)/r decreases. Consequently, 2m/r is always less than unity; and r(l) cannot have a maximum, Q.E.D. (Details of the proof are left to the reader as exercise 23.9.) Although the radii of curvature, r, and corresponding spherical surface areas, 4'17r 2 , increase monotonically from the center of a star outward, they do not increase at the same rate as they would in flat spacetime. In flat spacetime the rate of increase is given by dr/d(proper radial distance) = dr/dl = 1. In a star it is given by dr/dl = (1 - 2m/r)1/2 < 1. Consequently, if one were to climb a long ladder outward from the center of a relativistic star, measuring for each successive spher- ical shell its Schwarzschild r-value (\"proper circumference\"/2'17), one would find these r-values to increase surprisingly slowly. This strange behavior is most easily visualized by means of an \"embedding diagram.\" It would be too much for any easy visualization if one were to attempt to embed the whole curved four-dimensional manifold in some higher-dimensional flat space. [See, however, Fronsdal (1959) and Clarke (1970) for a global embedding in 5 + 1 dimensions, and Kasner ( 1921 b) for a local em bedding in 4 + 2 dimensions. One can never embed a non-flat, vacuum metric (G IlV = 0) in a flat space of 5 dimensions (Kasner, 1921c).] Therefore seek a simpler picture (Flamm 1916). Space at one time in the context of a static system has the same 3-geometry as space at another time. Therefore, depict 3-space only as it is at one time, t = constant. Moreover, at anyone time the space itself has spherical symmetry. Consequently, one slice through the center, r = 0, that divides the space symmetrically into two halves (for example, the equatorial slice, 8 = '17/2) has the same 2-geometry as any other such slice (any selected angle of tilt, at any azimuth) through the center. Therefore limit attention to the 2-geometry of the equatorial slice. The geometry on this slice is described by the line element §23.8. SPACETIME GEOMETRY FOR A STATIC STAR 613 (23.30) (2) but increases more slowly than in flat spacetime Embedding of spacetime in a flat space of higher dimensionality Now one may embed this two-dimensional curved-space geometry in the flat geom- etry of a Euclidean three-dimensional manifold. If the curvature of the two-dimensional slice is zero or negligible, the embedding is trivial. In this event, identify the 2-geometry with the slice z =:= 0 of the Euclidean 3-space. Moreover, introduce into that 3-space the familiar cylindrical coordinates z, r, ~, that one employs for any problem with axial symmetry (see Fig. 23.1 and Box 23.2 for more detail). Then one recognizes the flat two-dimensional slice as the - ------------set~pts o£.the Euclidean space with z = 0, with ~ running from 0 to 2'17, and r from 0 to 00. One has identified the r and ~ of the slice with the r and ~ of the Euclidean 3-space. If the 2-geometry is curved, as it is when the equatorial section is taken through a real star, then maintain the identification between the r, ~, of the slice and the r,~, of the Euclidean 3-geometry, but bend up the slice out of the plane z = 0 (except at the origin, r = 0). At the same time, insist that the bending be axially symmetric.

In all cases, because r> 2m(r), equation (23.34a) produces a surface with z and r as monotonically increasing functions of each other. This means that the embedded surface always opens upward and outward like a bowl; it always looks qualitatively like Figure 23.1; it never has a neck, and it never flattens out except asymptotically at r = 00. At the star's surface, even though the density may drop discontinuously to zero (p finite inside when p = 0; p zero outside), the interior and exterior geometries will join together smoothly [dz/dr, as given by equation (23.33), is continuous]. It must be emphasized that only points lying on the embedded 2-surface have physical significance so far as the stellar geometry is concerned: the three-dimen- sional regions inside and outside the bowl of Figure 23.1 are physically meaningless. So is the Euclidean embedding space. It merely permits one to visualize the geometry of space around the star in a convenient manner. Exercise 23.9.

Box 23.3 RIGOROUS DERIVATION OF THE SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC LINE ELEMENT Section 23.2 gave a heuristic derivation of the general spherically symmetric line element (23.7). This box attempts a more rigorous derivation, applicable to nonstatic systems, as well as static ones. Begin with a manifold M4 on which a metric ds 2 of Lorentz signature is defined. Assume M 4 to be spherically symmetric in the sense that to any 3 X 3 rotation matrix A there corresponds a mapping (rotation) of M4, also called A (A: M4 --+ M4: P -+ AP), that preserves the lengths of all curves. Further assumptions and constructions will be numbered (i), (ii), etc., so one can see what specializations are needed to get to the line ele- ment (23.7). Daggers (t) indicate assumptions that are found inapplicable to some other physically interesting situations. For any point P, form the set s= S(P) = {AP E M 4 1A E SO(3)} of all points equivalent to P under rotations. Assume (i)t that s is a two-dimensional surface (except for center points, where s is zero-dimensional), and (ii) that the metric on s is that of a standard 2-sphere. Then on s one will have (1) where dSl 2 is the standard metric of a unit sphere (dSl 2 = d8 2 + sin 2 8 d~2 for some 8, ~, defined on s), and where 2'17 R is the circumference of s. If M2 is the set of all such surfaces s, then S: M4 -+ M2: P -+ s = S(P) allows one to obtain, from R: M2 -+ (>jl: s -+ R(s) [the \"circumference\" function on M2 as defined by equation (1)], a corresponding function R: M4 -+ (>jl: q> -+ R(S(P» on M4 which in some cases can eventually be used as a coordinate on M4. (Note: (>jl denotes here the real numbers.) Now assume (iii)t there is a spherically symme- tric 4-velocity field u, defined so that if P = B(T) is one trajectory of u with u = d/dT, then each curve q> = AB(T) obtained by a rotation must also be a trajectory of u. The orthogonal projection of u onto any sphere s must then vanish, as there are no rotation invariant non-zero vector fields on 2-spheres. Thus u is orthogonal to each s. Also, if two trajectories of u start on some same sphere s, so B 1(0) = AB 2(0), then the same rotation A will always relate them, Bk) = AB 2 (T), since trajec- tories are uniquely defined by anyone point on them. Then S(B 1 (T» and S(B 2 (T» are both the same curve in M2, whose tangent d/dT one can call also u; in this way one obtains a vector field u on M2.

OVERVIEW Types of stellar configurations where relativity should be important Five kinds of stellar configurations are recognized in which relativistic effects should be significant: white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes, supermassive stars, and relativistic star clusters. The key facts about each type of configuration are summar- ized in Box 24.1; and the most important details are described in the text of this chapter (white dwarfs in §24.2; neutron stars and their connection to pulsars in §§24.2 and 24.3; supermassive stars and their possible connection to quasars and galactic nuclei in §§24.4 and 24.5; and relativistic star clusters in §24.6; a detailed discussion of black holes is delayed until Chapter 33). The book Stars and Relativity by Zel'dovich and Novikov (1971) presents a clear and very complete treatment of all these astrophysical applications of relativistic stellar theory. In a sense, that book can be regarded as a companion volume to this one; it picks up, with astrophysical emphasis, all the topics that this book treats with gravitational emphasis. This chapter is meant only to give the reader a brief survey of the material to be found in Stars and Relativity. (continued on page 621)"},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"§24.1. OVERVIEW 619 Box 24.1. STELLAR CONFIGURATIONS WHERE RELATIVISTIC EFFECTS ARE IMPORTANT [For detailed analyses and references on all these topics, see Zel'dovich and Novikov (1971).] A. White Dwarf Stars Are stars of about one solar mass, with radii about 5,000 kilometers and densities about 10 6 g/cm 3 - 1 ton/cm 3 ; support themselves against gravity by the pressure of degenerate electrons; have stopped burning nuclear fuel, and are gradually cooling as they radiate away their remaining store of thermal energy. Were observed and studied astronomically long before they were understood theoretically. Key points in history: August 1926, Dirac (1926) formulated Fermi- Dirac statistics, following Fermi (February). December 1926, R. H. Fowler (1926) used Fermi-Dirac statistics to explain the nature of white dwarfs; he invoked electron de- generacy pressure to hold the star out against the inward pull of gravity. 1930, S. Chandrasekhar (1931a,b) calculated white-dwarf models taking account of spe- cial relativistic effects in the electron-de- generacy equation of state; he discovered that no white dwarf can be more massive than -1.2 solar masses (\"Chandrasekhar Limit\"). 1932, L. D. Landau (1932) gave an elemen- tary explanation of the Chandrasekhar limit. 1949, S. A. Kaplan (1949) derived the effects of general relativity on the mass-radius curve for massive white dwarfs, and de- duced that general relativity probably in- duces an instability when the radius be- comes smaller than 1.1 X 10 3 km. Role of general relativity in white dwarfs: negligible influence on structure; significant influence on stability, on pulsation frequencies, and on form of mass-radius curve near the Chandrasekhar limit (i.e., in massive white dwarfs). Electron capture also significant. See; e.g., Zel'dovich and Novi- kov (1971); Faulkner and Gribbin (1968). B. Neutron Stars Are stars of about one solar mass, with radii about 10 km and densities about 10 14 g/cm 3 (same as density of an atomic nucleus); are supported against gravity by the pressure of degenerate neutrons and by nucleon-nucleon strong-interaction forces; are not burning nu- clear fuel; the energy being radiated is the energy of rotation and the remaining store of internal thermal energy. Theoretical calculations predicted their 'exist- ence in 1934, but they were not verified to exist observationally until 1968. Key points in history: 1932, neutron discovered by Chadwick (1932). 1933-34, Baade and Zwicky (1934a,b,c) (1) invented the concept of neutron star; (2) identified a new class of astronomical ob- jects which they called \"supernovae\"; (3) suggested that supernovae might be created by the collapse of a normal star to form a neutron star. (See Figure 24.1.) 1939, Oppenheimer and Volkoff (1939) per- formed the first detailed calculations of the structures of neutron stars; in the process, they laid the foundations of the general relativistic theory of stellar structure as pre- sented in Chapter 23.

PULSARS. NEUTRON STARS; QUASARS, SUPERMASSIVE STARS nese astronomers in A.D. 1054. Baade (1942) and Minkowskii (1942) identified the \"south preceding star,\" near the center of the Crab Nebula, as probably the (col- lapsed) remnant of the star that exploded in 1054 (see frontispiece). 1967, Pulsars were discovered by Hewish et al. (1968). 1968, Gold (1968) advanced the idea that pulsars are rotating neutron stars; and sub- sequent observations confirmed this sug- gestion. 1969, Cocke, Disney, and Taylor (1969) dis- covered that the \"south preceding star\" of the Crab nebula is a pulsar, thereby clinch- ing the connection between supernovae, neutron stars, and pulsars. Role of general relativity in neutron stars: significant effects (as much as a factor of 2) on structure and vibration periods; gravitational radiation reaction may be the dominant force that damps nonradial vi- brations. C. Black Holes Are objects created when a star collapses to a size smaller than twice its geometrized mass (R < 2M - (M/ M o ) X 3 km), thereby creat- ing such strong spacetime curvatures that it can no longer communicate with the external universe (detailed analysis of black holes in Chapters 33 and 34). No one who accepts general relativity has found any way to escape the prediction that black holes must exist in our galaxy. This prediction depends in no way on the complexity of the collapse that forms the black holes, or on unknown properties of matter at high density. However, the existence of black holes has not yet been verified observationally. Key points in history: 1795, Laplace (1795) noted that, according to Newtonian gravity and Newton's corpuscu- lar theory of light, light cannot escape from a sufficiently massive object (Figure 24.1). 1939, Oppenheimer and Snyder (1939) calcu- lated the collapse of a homogeneous sphere of pressure-free fluid, using general rela- tivity, and discovered that the sphere cuts itself off from communication with the rest of the universe. This was the first calcula- tion of how a black hole can form (Figure 24.1 ). 1965, Beginning of an era of intensive theo- retical investigation of black-hole physics. Role of general relativity in black-hole physics: No sensible account of black holes possible in Newtonian theory. The physics of black holes calls on Einstein's description of grav- ity from beginning to end. D. Supermassive Stars Are stars of mass between 10 3 and 10 9 solar masses, constructed from a hot plasma of density typically less than that in normal stars; are supported primarily by the pressure of photons, which are trapped in the plasma and are in thermal equilibrium with it; burn nuclear fuel (hydrogen) at some stages in their evolution. Theoretical calculations suggest (but not with complete confidence) that supermassive stars exist in the c~nters of galaxies and quasars, and perhaps elsewhere. Supermassive stars conceivably could be the energy sources for some quasars and galactic nuclei. However, astronomical observations have not yet yielded definitive evidence about their exist- ence or their roles in the universe if they do exist."},{"pageNumber":648,"pageContent":"§24.2. ENDPOINT OF STELLAR EVOLUTION Key points in history: 1963, Hoyle and Fowler (1963a,b) conceived the idea of supermassive stars, calculated their properties, and suggested that they might be associated With galactic nuclei and quasars. 1963-64, Chandrasekhar (1964a,b) and Feynman (1964) developed the general relativistic theory of stellar pulsations; and Feynman used it to show that supermassive stars, although Newtonian in structure, are subject to a general-relativistic instability. 1964 and after, calculations by many workers have elaborated on and extended the ideas of Hoyle and Fowler, but have not pro- duced any spectacular breakthrough. Role of general relativity in supermassive stars: negligible influence on structure, except in the extreme case ofa compact, rapidly rotating, disc-like configuration [see Bardeen and Wagoner (1971); Salpeter and Wagoner (1971 )]. significant influence on stability. E. Relativistic Star Clusters Are clusters of stars so dense that relativistic corrections to Newtonian theory modify their structure. 621 Theoretical calculations suggest that relativistic star clusters might, but quite possibly do not, form in the nuclei of some galaxies and qua- sars; if they do try to form, they might be destroyed during formation by star-star colli- sions, which convert the cluster into super- massive stars or into a dense conglomerate of stars and gas. Astronomical observations have yielded no definitive evidence, as yet, about the existence of relativistic clusters. Key points in history: 1965, Zel'dovich and Podurets (1965) con- ceived the idea of relativistic star clusters, developed the theory of their structure using general relativity and kinetic theory (cf. §25.7), and speculated about their sta- bility. 1968, lpser (1969) developed the theory of star-cluster stability and showed (in agree- ment with the Zel'dovich-Podurets specula- tions) that, when it becomes too dense, a cluster begins to collapse to form a black hole.

Some stars explode, scattering themselves into the interstellar medium; others contract into a white-dwarf state; and others-according to current theory-collapse to a neutron-star state, or beyond, into a black hole. Although one knows little at present about a star's dynamic evolution into its final state, much is known about the final states themselves.

SNYDER Unit.ersityof California, Berkeley, California (Received July.10, 1939) When all thermonuclear sourCeS of energy are exhau~ted a sufficiently heavy star will collapse. Unless fission due to rotation, the radiation of mass, or the blowing off of mass by radiation, reduce the star's mass to the order of that of the sun, this contraction will continue indefinitely. In the present paper we study the solutions of the gravitational field equations which describe this process. In I, general and qualitative arguments are given on the behavior of the metrical tensor as the contraction progresses: the radius of the star ap- proaches asymptotically its gravitational radius; light from the surface of the star is pro- gressively reddened, and can escape over a progressively narrower range of angles. In II, an analytic solution of the field equations confirming these general arguments is obtained for the case that the pressure within the star can be neglected. The total time of collapse for an ob- server comoving with the stellar matter is finite, and for this idealized case and typical stellar masses, of the order of a day; an external observer sees the star asymptotically shrinking to its gravitational radius."},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"624 24. PULSARS. NEUTRON STARS: QUASARS. SUPERMASSIVE STARS \"Final state of stellar evolution,\"' and \"cold, catalyzed matter\" defined Equation of state for cold. catalyzed matter What does one mean in principle by the term \"the final state of stellar evolution\"? Start with a star containing a given number, A, of baryons and let it evolve to the absolute, burned-out end point of thermonuclear combustion (minimum mass- energy possible for the A-baryon system). If the normal course of thermonuclear combustion is too slow, speed it up by catalysis. If an explosion occurs, collect the outgoing matter, extract its kinetic energy, and let it fall back onto the system. Repeat this operation as many times as needed to arrive at burnout (cold Fe 5H for the part of the system under modest pressure; other nuclear species in the region closer to the center; \"cold matter catalyzed to the end point of thermonuclear combustion\" throughout). End up finally with the system in its absolutely lowest energy state, with all angular momentum removed and all heat extracted, so that it sits at the absolute zero of temperature and has zero angular velocity. Such a \"dead\" system, depending upon its mass and prior history (two distinct energy minima for certain A-values), ends up as a cold stellar configuration (neutron star, or \"white\" dwarf), or as a \"dead\" black hole. The analysis of a cold stellar configuration demands an equation of state. The temperature is fixed at zero; the nuclear composition in principle is specified uniquely by the density; and therefore the pressure is also fixed uniquely once the density has been specified [equation of state p(p) for \"cold catalyzed matter\"]. The white dwarfs and neutron stars observed by astronomers are not really built of cold catalyzed matter. However, the matter in them is sufficiently near the end point of thermonuclear evolution and sufficiently cold that it can be idealized with fair accuracy as cold and catalyzed (see §23.4). The equation of state, p(P), for cold catalyzed matter is shown graphically in Figure 24.2. This version of the equation of state was constructed by Harrison and Wheeler in 1958. Other versions constructed more recently [see Cameron (1970) and Baym, Bethe, and Pethick (1971) for references] are almost identical to the Harrison-Wheeler version at densities well below nuclear densities, p < 3 X 10 13 g/cm 3 • At nuclear and supernuclear densities, all versions differ because of differing assumptions about nucleon-nucleon interactions. Along with the equation of state, in Figure 24.2 are shown properties of the models of cold stars constructed from this equation of state by integrating numerically the equations of structure (23.28). The equation of state can be understood by following the transformations that occur as a sample of cold catalyzed matter is compressed to higher and higher densities. At each stage in the compression, each possible thermonuclear reaction is to be catalyzed to its endpoint and the resultant thermal energy is to be removed. When the sample is at zero pressure, it is a ball of pure, cold Fe 56 , since Fe 56 is the most tightly bound of all nuclei. It has the density 7.86 g/cm 3 . As the sample is compressed, its internal pressure is provided at first by normal solid-state forces; but the atoms are soon squeezed so closely together that the electrons become quite oblivious of their nuclei, and begin to form a degenerate Fermi gas. By the time a density of p = 10 5 g/cm 3 has been reached, valence forces are completely negligi- ble, the degenerate electron pressure dominates, and the compressibility index, y (see legend for Figure 24.2), is 5/3, the value for a nonrelativistically degenerate Fermi gas.

The equation of state is exhibited in the form of a plot of \"compressibility index,\" p + pdp y=---, P dp as a function of density of mass-energy, p. (Small y corresponds to easy compressibility.) The curve is parameterized by the logarithm of the pressure, logloP, in units of g/cm 3 [same units as p; note that p(g/cm 3 ) = (l/c 2 ) X p(dyne/cm 2 )]. The chemical composition of the matter as a function of density is indicated as follows: Fe, Fe 56 nuclei; A, nuclei more neutron rich than Fe 56 ; e, electrons; n, free neutrons; p, free protons. The firsU!lw of thef!Tl0ELnamics [equation (22.6)1, when applied to cold matter (zero entropy) says dp/(p + p) = dn/n; i.e., - p + P (fP dp ) n = JLFe/ 56 exp - 0 p + P . Here JLFe' the rest mass of an Fe 56 atom, is the ratio between p + p ::::: p and n/56 in the limit of zero density. From this equation and a knowledge of p(p)-(see Figure)-one can calculate n(p). The equilibrium configurations are represented by curves of total mass-energy, M, versus radius, R. (R is defined such that 4'lTR2 is the star's surface area.) The M(R) curve is parameterized by the logarithm of the central density, loglOPe' measured in g/cm 3 • Only configurations along two branches of the curve are stable against small perturbations and can therefore exist in nature: the white dwarfs, with log lOPe < 8.38, and the neutron stars, with 13.43 < log lOPe < 15.78 (see Box 26.1).

As the compression continues beyond this point, the rising Fermi energy of the electrons induces new nuclear reactions similar to (24.1), but involving different nuclei. In these reactions more and more electrons are swallowed up to form new nuclei, which are more and more neutron- rich. When the density reaches P = 3 X 1011 g/cm 3 , the nuclei are so highly neutron- rich (Y §§2) that neutrons begin to drip off them. The matter now becomes highly compressible for a short time (3 X 1011 :s P :s 4 X 1011), since most of the re- maining electrons are swallowed up very rapidly by the dripping nuclei. Above P - 4 X 1011 g/cm 3 free neutrons become plentiful and their degeneracy pressure exceeds that of the electrons. Further compression to P - 10 13 g/cm 3 completely disintegrates the remaining nuclei, leaving the sample almost pure neutrons with y = 5/3, the value for a nonrelativistically degenerate Fermi gas. Intermixed with the neutrons are just enough degenerate electrons to prevent the neutrons from decaying, and just enough protons to maintain charge neutrality. Compression beyond P - 10 13 g/cm 3 pushes the sample into the domain of nuclear densities where the physics of matter is only poorly understood. This Harrison-Wheeler version of the equation of state ignores all nucleon-nucleon interactions at and above nuclear densities; it idealizes matter as a noninteracting mixture of neutrons, protons, and electrons with neutrons dominating; and it shows a compressibility index of5/3 while the neutrons are nonrelativistic, but 4/3 after they attain relativistic Fermi energies.

Above 10gIO Pc - 15.8, the gravitational forces become strong enough to win out over the pressure of the nuclear matter, and the stars are all unstable. [See Gerlach (1968) for the possibility-which, however, he rates as unlikely-that there might exist a third family of stable equilibrium con- figurations, additional to white dwarfs and neutron stars.] The white-dwarf stars have masses below 1.2 Me and radii between -3000 and (2) white-dwarf stars -20,000 km.

The properties of white-dwarf models are fairly independent of whose version of the equation of state is used in the calculations. The properties of neutron stars are moderately dependent on the equation of state (3) neutron stars used. However, all versions lead to upper and lower limits on the mass and central density.

It appears certain that no cold stellar configuration can have a mass exceeding -5 Me [Rhoades (1971)] (1.2 Me according to the Harrison-Wheeler equation of state, Figure 24.2). Any star more massive than this must reduce its mass below this limit if it is to fade away into quiet obscurity, otherwise relativistic gravitational (4) black holes forces will eventually pull it into catastrophic gravitational collapse past white-dwarf radii, past neutron-star radii, and into a black hole a few kilometers in size (see Part Vll). §24.3.

The result is a neutron star, unless the core's mass is so great that gravity overcomes the nucleon-nucleon repulsion and pulls the star on in to form a black hole. Not all the star's mass should become part of the neutron star or black hole. Much of it, perhaps most, can be ejected into interstellar space by the violence that accom- panies the collapse-violence due to flash nuclear burning, shock waves, and energy transport by neutrinos (\"stick of dynamite in center of star, ignited by collapse\"). The collapsed core holds more interest for gravitation theory than the ejected envelope. That core, granted a mass small enough to avoid the black-hole fate, will initially be a hot, wildly pulsating, rapidly rotating glob of nuclear matter with a strong, embedded magnetic field (see Figure 24.3). The pulsations must die out quickly. They emit a huge flux of gravitational radiation, and radiation reaction damps them in a characteristic time of --1 second [see Wheeler (1966); Thome (1969a)]. Moreover, the pulsations push and pull elementary particle reactions back and forth by raising and lowering the Fermi energies in the core's interior; these particle reactions can convert pulsation energy into heat at about the same rate as the pulsation energy is radiated by gravity. [See Langer and Cameron (1969); also §1l.5 of Zel'dovich and Novikov (1971) for details and references.] The result, after a few seconds, is a rapidly rotating centrifugally flattened neutron star with a strong (perhaps 10 12 gauss) magnetic field; all the pulsations are gone. If the star is deformed from axial symmetry (e.g., by centrifugal forces or by a nonsymmetric magnetic field), its rotation produces a steady outgoing stream of gravitational waves, which act back on the star to remove rotational energy. Whether or not this occurs, the rotating magnetic field itself radiates electromagnetic waves. They slow the rotation and transport energy into the surrounding, exploding gas cloud (nebula). [See Pacini (1968), Goldreich and Julian (1968), and Ostriker and Gunn (1969) for basic considerations.] Somehow, but nobody understands in detail how, the rotating neutron star beams coherent radio waves and light out into space. Each time the beam sweeps past the Earth optical and radio telescopes see a pulse of radiation. The light is emitted synchronously with the radio waves, but the light pulses reach Earth earlier (-I second for the pulsar in the crab nebula) because of the retardation of the radio waves by the plasma along the way. This is the essence of the 1973 theory of pulsars, accepted by most astrophysicists. Although the mechanism of coherent emission is not understood, the pulsar radiation can nevertheless be a powerful tool in the experimental study of neutron stars. Anything that affects the stellar rotation rate, even minutely (fractional changes as small as 10- 9 ) will produce measurable irregularities in the timing of the pulses at Earth. If the star's crust and mantle are crystalline, as 1973 theory predicts, they may be subject to cracking, faulting, or slippage (\"starquake\") that changes the moment of inertia, and thence the rotation rate. Debris falling into the star will also change its rotation. Whichever the cause, after such a disturbance the star may rotate differentially for awhile; and how it returns to rigid rotation may depend on such phenomena as superfluidity in its deep interior. Thus, pulsar-timing data may eventually give information about the interior and crust of the neutron star, and"},{"pageNumber":656,"pageContent":"~ ~ A J--~---- - 10 4 km -----:r----I B' 629 Figure 24.3. \"Collapse, pursuit, and plunge scenario\" [schematic from Ruffini and Wheeler (l97Ib)]. -------~.~_.~ • A star with white-dwarf core (A), slowly rotating, • evolves by straightforward astrophysics, • arrives at the point of gravitational instability, • collapses, and • ends up as a rapidly spinning neutron-star pancake (B,B'). • It then fragments (C) because it has too much angular momentum to collapse into a single stable object.

SUPERMASSIVE STARS AND STELLAR INSTABILITIES When a Newtonian star of mass M oscillates adiabatically in its fundamental mode, the change in its radius, oR, obeys a harmonic-oscillator equation, Mol? = -koR, (24.4) with a \"spring constant\" k that depends on the star's mean adiabatic index 1\\ [recall: r 1 (n/p)(ap/an)const.entropy]' on its gravitational potential energy [2, on the trace I = f pr 2 dT of the second moment of its mass distribution, and on its mass M, k = 3M(l\\ - 4/3)1[21/1 (24.5) (See Box 24.2). If f 1 > 4/3 the Newtonian star is stable and oscillates; if f 1 < 4/3 the star is unstable and either collapses or explodes, depending on its initial condi- tions and overall energetics. This result is a famous theorem in Newtonian stellar theory-but it is relevant only for adiabatic oscillations. Box 24.2 OSCILLATION OF A NEWTONIAN STAR The following is a volume-averaged analysis of the lowest mode of radial oscillation. Such analyses are useful in understanding the qualitative behavior and stability of a star. [See Zel'dovich and Novikov (1971) for an extensive exploitation of them.] However, for precise quantitative results, one must perform a more detailed analysis [see, e.g., Ledoux and Walraven (1958); also Chapter 26 of this book].

PULSARS, NEUTRON STARS; QUASARS, SUPERMASSIVE STARS Stability theory predicts \"engine-driven oscillations\" and quick death for stars of M > 60M 0 Possible existence of supermassive stars Relativistic instabilities in a supermassive star In a real star no oscillation is precisely adiabatic. The oscillations in temperature cause corresponding oscillations in the stellar opacity and in nuclear burning rates. These insert energy into or extract energy from the gas vibrations. All main-sequence stars thus far observed and studied have masses below 60 Me. For such small masses, theory predicts low enough temperatures that gas pressure dominates over radiation pressure, and the adiabatic index is nearly that of nonrela- tivistic gas, f 1 ::::: 5/3. Such stars vibrate stably. The net effect of the oscillating opacity and burning rate is usually to extract energy from the vibrations. Thus, they damp. (The vibrations of Cepheid variable stars are a notable exception.) No one has yet seen a main-sequence star with mass above about 60 Me. This is explained as follows. For masses above 60 Me' the temperature should be so high that radiation pressure dominates over gas pressure, and the adiabatic index f 1 is only slightly above the value 4/3 for pure radiation. Consequently the \"spring constant\" of the star, although positive, is very small. On the inward stroke of an oscillation, the central temperature rises, and nuclear burning speeds up. (The nuclear burning rate goes as a very high power of the central temperature; for example, in a massive star HCNO burning releases energy at a rate f ReNo ex 1;Y.) Because the spring constant is so small, the inward stroke lasts for a long time, and the enhanced nuclear burning produces a significant excess of thermal energy and pressure. Hence, on the outward stroke the star expands more vigorously than it contracted (\"engine\"). Successive vibrations are driven to higher and higher ampli- tudes. Eventually, calculations suggest, the star either explodes, or it ejects enough mass by its vigorous vibrations to drop below the critical limit of M - 60 Me. Hence, stars of mass above 60 Me should not live long enough that astronomers could have a reasonable probability of discovering them. Of course, this \"engine action\" does not prevent massive stars from forming, living a short time, and then disrupting themselves. Such a possibility is particularly intriguing for supermassive stars [M between 10 3 Me and 10 9 Me - 0.01 X (mass of a galaxy)]. Although such stars may be exceedingly rare, by their huge masses and huge release of explosive energy they might play an important role in the universe. Moreover, it is conceivable that the oscillations of such stars, like those of Cepheid variables, might be sustained at large amplitudes for long times (a million years?), with nonlinear damping processes preventing their further growth. Theory predicts that general relativistic effects should strongly influence the oscillations of a supermassive star. The increase in \"gravitational force,\" oFgrav' acting on a shell of matter on the inward stroke is greater in general relativity than in Newtonian theory, and the decrease on the outward stroke is also greater. Conse- quently the \"effective index\" rlcrit of gravitational forces is increased above the Newtonian value of 4/3; thus, fractional increase in \"pressure-like force of gravity\" per unit fractional r 1crit = (4/3) + a(M/R) + O(M2/R2), (24.6) change in baryon-number density"},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"where a is a constant of the order of unity that depends on the structure of the star (see Box 26.2).

The relativistic rise in the effective index of gravity above 4/3 [equation (24.6)] brings on the transition from stability (positive k; vibration) to instability (negative k; explosion or collapse) under conditions when one otherwise would have expected stability. For supermassive stars, Fowler and Hoyle (1964) show that where f is a constant of order unity. As a newly formed supermassive star contracts inward, heating up, but not yet hot enough to ignite its nuclear fuel, it approaches nearer and nearer to instability against collapse.

The relativistic instability occurs far outside the Schwarzschild radius when the star is very massive. Relativity hardly modifies the star's structure at all; but because of the delicate balance between 8Fgrav and 8~uoy in the Newtonian oscillations (Box 24.2), tiny relativistic corrections to these forces can completely change the stability.

Depending on its mass and angular momentum, the star may ignite its fuel before or after relativistic collapse begins, and before or after implosion through the Schwarzschild radius. When the fuel is ignited, it can wreak havoc, because even if the star is not then imploding, its adiabatic index will be very near the critical one, and the burning may drive oscillations to higher and higher amplitudes. These processes are so complex that in 1973 one is far from having satisfactory analyses of them, but for reviews of what is known and has been done, the reader can consult Fowler (1966). Thorne (1967), and Zel'dovich and Novikov (1971). The theory of stellar pulsations in general relativity is presented for Track-2 readers in Chapter 26 of this book. §24.5. QUASARS AND EXPLOSIONS IN GALACTIC NUCLEI· Supermassive stars were first conceived by Hoyle and Fowler (1963a,b) as an expla- nation for explosions in the nuclei of galaxies. Shortly thereafter, when quasars were discovered, Hoyle and Fowler quite naturally appealed to their supermassive stars for an explanation of these puzzles as well. Whether galactic explosions or quasars are driven by supermassive stars remains a subject of debate in astronomical circles even as this book is being finished, in 1973. Hence, this book will avoid the issue except for the following remark. Whatever is responsible for quasars and galactic explosions must be a machine of great mass (M - 10 6 to 10 10 Me) and small radius (light-travel time across the machine, as deduced from light variations, is sometimes less than a day). The machine might be a coherent object, i.e., a supermassive star; or it might be a dense mixture of ordinary stars and much gas. Actually these two possibilities may not be distinct. Star-star collisions in a dense cluster can lead to stellar coalescence and the gradual building up of one or more supermassive stars [Sanders (1970); Spitzer (1971); Colgate (1967)]. Thus, at one stage in its life, a galactic nucleus or quasar might be driven by collisions in a dense star cluster; and at a later stage it might be driven by a supermassive star; and at a still later stage that star might collapse to leave behind a massive black hole (10 6 -10 9 Me), but a black hole that is still \"live\" and active (Chapter 33). §24.6.

FROM KEPLER'S LAWS TO THE EFFECTIVE POTENTIAL FOR MOTION IN SCHWARZSCHILD GEOMETRY No greater glory crowns Newton's theory of gravitation than the account it gives of the principal features of the solar system: a planet in its motion sweeps out equal areas in equal times; its orbit is an ellipse, with one focus at the sun; and the cube of the semimajor axis, a, of the ellipse, multiplied by the square of the average angular velocity of the planet in its orbit (w = 2 'IT /period) gives a number with the dimensions of a length, the same number for all the planets (Box 25.1), equal to the mass of the sun: Exactly the same is true for the satellites of Jupiter (Figure 25.1), and of the Earth (Box 25.1), and true throughout the heavens. What more can one possibly expect of Einstein's theory of gravity when it in its tum grapples with this centuries-old theme of a test object moving under the influence of a spherically symmetric center of attraction? The principal new result can be stated in a single sentence: The particle is governed by an \"effective potential\" (Figure 25.2 and §§25.5, 25.6) that possesses not only (1) the long distance - M/r attractive behavior and (2) the shorter distance"},{"pageNumber":664,"pageContent":"637 §25.1.

The effective potential (also in units of 1£) is defined by equation (25.16) or, equiva- lently, by the equation (: r + V2(r) = £2 (see also §25.5) and has the value V= [(1- 2M/r)(1 + L2/r 2 )]1I2. It represents that value of £ at which the radial kinetic energy of the particle, at r, reduces to zero (£-value that makes r into a \"turning point\": V(r) = £.

Which definition one chooses depends on convenience, on the intended application, on the tie to the archetypal differential equation !x 2 + V(x) = E, and on the stress one wishes to put on correspondence with the effective potential of Newtonian theory). Stable circular orbits are possible (representative point sitting at mini- mum of effective potential) only-for I values in excess of 2 v'3 M. For any such fixed I value, the motion departs slightly from circu- larity as the energy is raised above the potential minimum (see the two heavy horizontal lines for I = 3.75 M). In classical physics, the motion is limited to the region of positive kinetic energy. In quantum physics, the particle can tunnel through the region where the kinetic energy, as calculated classically, is negative (dashed prolongations of heavy horizontal lines) and head for the \"pit in the potential\" (capture by black hole).

Capture of a test object by a black hole as simple exemplar of gravitational collapse. 6. Dynamics of Friedmann universe derived from model of Schwarzschild \"lattice universe.\" Lat- tice universe is constructed from 120 or some other magic number of concentrations of mass, each mass in an otherwise empty lattice cell of its own. Each lattice cell, though actually po- lygonal, is idealized (see Wigner-Seitz approxi- mation of solid-state physics) as spherical. A test object at the interface between two cells falls toward the center of each [standard radial motion in Schwarzschild geometry; see discus- sion following equation (25.27). Therefore the two masses fall toward each other at a calcula- ble rate. From this simple argument follows the entire dynamics of the closed 3-sphere lattice universe, in close concord with the predictions of the Friedmann model [see Lindquist and Wheeler (1957)]. 7. Perturbations of Schwarz schild geometry, I. Gravitational waves are incident on, scattered by, and captured into a black hole. Waves with wavelength short compared to the Schwarzs- child radius can be analyzed to good approxi- mation by the methods of geometric optics (ex- ercises 35.15 and 35.16), as employed in this chapter to treat the motions of particles and photons. For longer wavelengths, there occur important physical-optics corrections to this geometric-optics idealization (see §35.8 and ex- ercises 32.10, 32.11). Similar considerations apply to electromagnetic and de Broglie waves. 8. Lepton number for an electron in its lowest quantum state in the geometry (\"gravitational field of force\") of a black hole is calculated to be transcended (capture of the electron!) or not according as the mass of this black hole is large or small compared to a certain critical mass M*e = M*2/ me (_10 17 g or 10- 11 cm) [Hartle (1971, 1972); Wheeler (197lb,c); Teitelboim (1972b,c)]. Similarly (with another value for the critical mass) for conservation of baryon num- ber [Bekenstein (1972a,b), Teitelboim (1972a)]. To analyze \"transcendence or not\" one must solve quantum-mechanical wave equations, of which the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for parti- cle and photon orbits is a classical limit. These quantum wave equations contain effective po- tentials identical-aside from spin-dependent and wavelength-dependent corrections-to the effective potentials for particle and photon mo- tion. 9. Perturbations of Schwarzschild geometry, II. Those small changes in standard Schwarzschild black-hole geometry which remain stationary in time describe the alterations in a \"dead\" black hole that make it into a \"live\" black hole, one endowed with angular momentum as well as mass (see Chapter 33). To analyze such changes in black-hole geometry, one must again solve wave equations, but wave equations which are now classical.

The Hamilton-Jacobi method (Box 25.3) leads quickly to the major results of interest (Box 25.4), and it has a close tie to the quantum principle. The world-line method (§§252, 25.3, 25.4) starts with the geodesic equations of motion themselves. It provides a more familiar way into the subject for a reader not acquainted with the Hamilton-Jacobi approach. Moreover, in attempting to solve the geodesic equations of motion, one must analyze symmetry properties of the geometry, an enterprise that continues to pay dividends when one moves from Schwarzschild geometry to Kerr-Newman geometry (Chap- ter 33), and from Friedmann cosmology (Chapter 27) to more general cosmologies (Chapter 30). §25.1.

Purely classical (nonquantum). 2. Originated with William Rowan Hamilton out of conviction that m~chanics is similar in its character to optics; that the \"particle world line\" of mechanics is an idealization analogous to the \"light ray\" of geometric optics. Localization of energy of light ray is approximate only. Its spread is governed by wavelength oflight (\"geometric optics\"). Hamilton had glimmerings of same idea for parti- cles: \"quantum physics before quantum physics.\" The way that he and Jacobi developed to analyze motion through the Hamilton-Jacobi function S(x, t)-to take the example of a dynamic system with only one degree of freedom, x- makes the leap from classical ideas to quantum ideas as short as one knows how to make it. Moreover, the real world is a quantum world. Classical me- chanics is-not born out of a vacuum. It is an idealization of and approximation to quantum mechanics. 3. Key idea is idealization to a particle wavelength so short that quantum-mechan- ical spread or uncertainty in location of particle (or spread of configuration coordinates of more complex system) is negligible. No better way was ever discovered to unite the spirit of quantum mechanics and the precision oflocation of classical mechanics. 4. Call HamiltonianH(p,x) = p2/2rn + V(x). CallenergyofparticleE.

CONSERVED QUANTITIES FOR MOTION IN SCHWARZSCHILD GEOMETRY Consider a test particle moving in the Schwarzschild geometry, described by the line element (25.12) This expression for the geometry applies outside any spherically symmetric center of attraction of total mass-energy M. It makes no difference, for the motion of the particle outside, what the geometry is inside, because the particle never gets there; before it can, it collides with the surface of the star-if the center of attraction is a star, that is to say, a fluid mass in hydrostatic equilibrium. At each point throughout such an equilibrium configuration, the Schwarzschild coordinate r exceeds the local value of the quantity 2m(r); see §23.8. Therefore the Schwarzschild coordinate R of the surface exceeds 2M. Consequently, expression (25.12) applies outside any equilibrium configuration, no matter how compact (r > R > 2M implies that one need not face the issue of the \"singularity\" at r = 2M). The more compact the configuration, however, the more of the Schwarzschild geometry the test particle can explore. The ideal limit is not a star in hydrostatic equilibrium. It is a star that has undergone complete gravitational collapse to a black hole. Then (25.12) applies arbitrarily close to r = 2M. This idealization is assumed here (\"black hole\"), because the analysis can then cover the maximum range of possible situations. Wherever the test particle lies, and however fast it moves, project that point and project that 3-velocity radially onto a sphere of some fixed r value, say, the unit sphere r = 1. The point and the vector together define a point and a vector on the surface of the unit sphere; and they in tum mark the beginning and define the totality of a great circle. As the particle continues on its way, the radial projection of its ------Pp'00SlsiJ.ltiLCoIlLD will CQntinue_~Qn that great circle.

Whether one plots VCr) or V2(r) as a function of r is largely a matter of convenience. The important point is this: a value of r where VCr) becomes equal to the available energy £, or V2(r) becomes equal to £2, is a turning point. A particle that was moving to larger r values, Once arrived at a turning point, turns around and moves to smaller r values. Or when a particle moving to smaller r values comes to a turning point, it reverses its motion and proceeds to larger r values. A turning point is not a point of equilibrium. A stone thrown straight up does not sit at a point of equilibrium at the top of its flight.

Were one dealing in Newtonian theory with the same attracting mass M spread uniformly over a sphere of radius R, with a pipe thrust through it to make a channel for the motion of the test particle, then that particle would execute simple harmonic oscillations (dotted curve above). The angular frequency w of these vibrations would be identical with the angular frequency of revolution of the test particle in a circle just grazing the surface of the planet, a frequency given by Kepler's law M = w 2 R3.

The expression for the Schwarzschild-coordinate time t required to reach any point r in the fall under the influence of a concentrated center of attraction is complicated and is not shown here (see equation 25.37 and Figure 25.5).

The r-coordinate has no inhibition about passing through the value r = 2M.

Thus the second description of the motion leaves out, and has no alternative but to leave out, the whole range of r values from r = 2M down to zero: perfectly good physics, and physics that the falling particle is going to see and explore, but physics that the faraway observer never will see and never can see. If the tortoise coordinate did not exist, it would have to be invented. It invests each factor ten of closer approach to r = 2M with the same interest as the last factor ten and the next to come.

The qualitative features of the motion in both cases are most easily deduced by inspection of the \"effective potential-per-unit-mass\" V in its dependence on r (Figure 25.2) when one is interested in proper time; or the same effective potential V in its dependence on the \"tortoise coordinate\" r· [Figure 25.4 and equation (25.31») when one is interested in Schwarzschild-coordinate time t.

To admit angular momentum is to increase the number of special points still further, and to make the integral unmanageable except numerically or qualitatively (via the potential diagram of Figure 25.4), or in terms of elliptic functions [Hagihara (1931 )]. It is often convenient to abstract away from the precise value r = R at the start (4) free-fall from r = 00 of the collapse. In this event, one deals with the limit R --+- 00.

Any exact evaluation of these coefficients would appear difficult. For the time being, the values of the Fourier amplitudes would seem best developed by successive approximations starting from the Newtonian analysis (see Box 25.4 and references cited there). In connection with any such Fourier analysis, it is appropriate to recall that the fundamental frequency alone appears, and all higher harmonics have zero amplitude, when the motion takes place in an exactly circular orbit (opposite extreme from the pure radial motion of I = 0). Therefore it is of interest to note (exercise 25.19) that the circular frequency w of this motion, as measured by a faraway observer, is correlated with the Schwarzschild r-value of the orbit by exactly the Keplerian formula of non-relativistic physics: (exact; general relativity).

Therefore the effective potential (25.58) is plotted directly in Box 25.7, and used there to analyze some of the principal features of the orbits of a photon in Schwarzschild geometry. On occasion it has proved useful to plot as a function of r, not the \"effective potential\" of (25.58), but the \"potential impact parameter B(r)\" calculated from that formula [see, for example, Power and Wheeler (1957), Zel'dovich and Novikov (1971)].

SPHERICAL STAR CLUSTERS By combining orbit theory, as developed in this chapter, with kinetic theory in curved spacetime as developed in §22.6, one can formulate the theory of relativistic star clusters.

PARTICLE MOTION IN SCHWARZSCHILD GEOMETRY (1) foundations for analysis Demand that the cluster be static, in the sense that the number density in phase space 9l is independent of time. (New stars, fiying along geodesic orbits, enter a fixed region in phase space at the same rate as \"old\" stars leave it.) Ignore collisions and close encounters between stars; i.e., treat each star's orbit as ageodesic in the spherically symmetric spacetime of the cluster as a whole. With these idealizations accepted, one can write down a manageable set of equa- tions for the structure of the cluster. * Since the cluster is static and spherical, so must be its gravitational field. Consequently, one can introduce the same kind of coordinate system (\"Schwarzschild coordinates\") as was used for a static spherical star in Chapter 23: tP = tP(r), A = A(r). (25.73) In the tangent space at each event in spacetime reside the momentum vectors of the swarming stars. For coordinates in this tangent space (\"momentum space\"), it is convenient to use the physical components of 4-momentum, ill-i.e., components on the orthonormal frame we = rdB, w¢' = r sin B dcp. (25.74) Then the number density of stars in phase space is a spherically symmetric, static function (25.75) (25.76a) [9l is independent of t because the cluster is static; and independent of B, cp, and angle 8 = tan- 1 (p¢'/pe) because of spherical symmetry.]·· .. The functions describing the structure of the cluster, tP, A, and 9l, are determined by the kinetic (also, in this context, called the Vlasoff) equation (§22.6) d9l/dll. = 0, i.e., 9l conserved along orbit of each star in phase space; and by the Einstein field equations (25.76b) (2) solution of Vlasoff equation {The Vlasoff equation for Newtonian star clusters is treated by Ogorodnikov (1965). The above expression for the stress-energy tensor of a swarm of particles (stars) was derived in exercise 22.18. Here, as in exercise 22.18, the particles (stars) are assumed not all to have the same rest mass. Note that rest mass is here denoted p., but in Chapter 22 it was denoted m.] To solve the Vlasoff equation, one need only note that 9l is conserved along stellar orbits and therefore must be a function of the constants of the orbital motion. There is a constant of motion corresponding to each Killing vector in the cluster's static, spherical spacetime (see exercise 25.8): *These equations were first derived and explored by Zel'dovich and Podurets (1965)."},{"pageNumber":708,"pageContent":"E = \"energy. at infinity\" = -p' (a/at) = -Po, L z = \"z-component of angular momentum\" = p' ( z = p' (a/acp) = P\"\" LIJ = ''y-component of angular momentum\" = p' ( IJ' (25.77a) L z = \"x-component of angular momentum\" = P • ( z' §25.7.

But this general solution is not spherically symmetric. For example, the distribution function corresponds to a cluster of stars with orbits all in the equatorial plane (J = 7T/2 (LIJ = L z = 0 for all stars in cluster). To be spherical the cluster's distribution function must depend only on the magnitude L = (L/ + L/ + L/)1I2 of the angular momentum, and not on its direction (not on the orientation of a star's orbital plane). Thus, the general spherical solution to the Vlasoff equation in a static, spherical spacetime must-have the form ~ = F(E, L, p.). (25.78) To use this general solution, one must reexpress the constants of the motion E, L, p., in terms of the agreed-on phase-space coordinates (t, r, (J, cp,po,l,pe,p¢). The rest mass of a star is given by (25.77b). The energy-at-infinity is obtained by red- shifting the locally measured energy (25.79a) For an orbit in the equatorial plane (Pe = pe = pe = 0; L z = LIJ = 0), the total angular momentum has the form L = ILzl = IF\",I = Irp¢1 = r X (\"tangential\" component of 4-momentum).

Thus, to every static, spherical star cluster with isotropic velocity distribution, there corresponds a unique gas sphere that has the same distributions of p, P, m, and lP. 7. Conversely [see Fackerell (1968)], given a gas sphere (solution to equations of stellar structure for p, P, m, and lP), one can always find a distribution function F(E, fL) that describes a cluster with the same p, P, m, and lP. But for some gas spheres F is necessarily negative in part of phase space, and is thus unphysical."},{"pageNumber":712,"pageContent":"§25.7. SPHERICAL STAR CLUSTERS Box 25.9 ISOTHERMAL STAR CLUSTERS A. Distribution Function 685 1. In any relativistic star cluster, one might expect that occasional close en- counters between stars would \"thermalize\" the stellar distribution function. This suggests that one study isotropic, spherical clusters with the Boltzmann distribution function (tacitly assumed zero for pO = Ee-q, < f-Lo) ~ = F(E, L, f-L) = Ke- E / T 8(f-L - f-Lo)' (I) Here K is a normalization constant, T is a constant \"temperature,\" and for simplicity the stars are all assumed to have the same rest mass f-Lo. 2. In such a cluster, an observer at radius r sees a star of energy-at-infinity E to have locally measured energy pO = (rest mass-energy) + (kinetic energy) = f-Lo 2 1/2 = Ee-tf>(r). (2) (I - v ) Consequently, the stars in his neighborhood have a Boltzmann distribution (3) with locally measured temperature (4) Thus, the temperature of the cluster is subject to identically the same red- shift-blue shift effects as photons, particles, and stars that move about in the cluster. (For a derivation of this same temperature-redshift law for a gas in thermal equilibrium, see part (e) of exercise 22.7.) 3. Actually, the Boltzmann distribution (I) can never be achieved. Stars with E > f-Lo are gravitationally unbound from the cluster and will escape. The Boltzmann distribution presumes that, as such stars go zooming off toward r = 00, an equal number of stars with the same energies come zooming in from r = 00 to maintain an unchanged distribution function. Such a situation is clearly unrealistic. Instead, one expects the escape of stars to truncate the distribution at some energy Emu slightly less than f-Lo' The result, in idealized form, is the \"truncated Boltzmann distribution\" ~ = F(E, L, f-L) = {Ke- E / T 8(f-L - f-Lo), E < Emu' 0, E> Emu' (5)"},{"pageNumber":713,"pageContent":"686 Box 25.9 (continued) 25. PARTICLE MOTION IN SCHWARZSCHILD GEOMETRY B. Structure and Stability of Cluster Models 1. Models for star clusters with truncated Boltzmann distributions have been constructed by Zel'dovich and Podurets (1965), by Fackerell (1966), and by Ipser (1969), using the procedure of Box 25.8. Ipser has analyzed the colli- sionless radial vibrations of such clusters. 2. In general, these clusters form a 4-parameter family (K, T, f-Lo, Emu)' Replace the parameter K by the total rest mass of the cluster, M o = f-LoN, where N is the total number of stars. Replace T by the temperature per unit rest mass, T = T/f-Lo' Replace Emu by the maximum energy per unit rest mass, Emu = Emu/f-Lo· Then the clusters are parametrized by (M o ' T, f-Lo' Emu)' When one now doubles f-Lo' holding M o ' T, Emu fixed (and thus halving the total number of stars), all macroscopic features of the cluster remain un- changed. In this sense f-Lo is a \"trivial parameter\" and can henceforth be ignored or changed at will. The total rest mass of the cluster M o can be regarded as a \"scaling factor\"; all dimensionless features of the cluster are independent of it. For example, if Pc is the central density of mass-energy [equation (25.8Ia), evaluated at r = 0], then PcMoz is dimensionless and is thus independent of M o ' which means that Pc a: M o - z . Only two nontrivial parameters remain: T and Emu' 3. Consider as an instructive special case [Zel'dovich and Podurets (1965)] the one-parameter sequence with Emu = I - fT. The following figure, com- puted by Ipser (1969), plots for this sequence the fractional binding energy, (6) (here M is total mass-energy); the square of the angular frequency for collisionless vibrations (vibration amplitude a: e- iwt ) divided by central density of mass-energy, w Z / Pc; and the redshift, zc' of photons emitted from the center of the cluster and received at infinity. All these quantities are dimensionless, and thus depend only on the choice of T = T/f-Lo' 4. Notice that all models beyond the point of maximum binding energy (zc ~ 0.5) are unstable against collisionless radial perturbations (w imagi- nary; amplitude of perturbation a: e 1w1t ). When perturbed slightly, such clusters must collapse to form black holes. (See Chapter 26 for an analysis of the analogous instability in stars). 5. These results suggest an idealized story of the evolution of a spherical cluster [Zel'dovich and Podurets (1965); Fackerell, Ipser, and Thome (1969)]. The"},{"pageNumber":714,"pageContent":"§25.7.

The evolution would be driven by stellar collisions and by the evaporation of stars. When two stars collide and coalesce, they increase the cluster's rest mass and hence its fractional binding energy. When a star gains enough energy from such encounters to escape from the cluster, it carries away excess kinetic energy, leaving the cluster more tightly bound. Thus, both collisions and evaporation should drive the cluster toward states of tighter and tighter binding. When the cluster reaches the point, along its sequence, of maximum fractional binding energy, it can no longer evolve quasistatically. Relativistic gravitational collapse sets in: the stars spiral inward through the gravitational radius of the cluster toward its center, leaving behind a black hole with, perhaps, some remaining stars orbiting it. It is tempting to speculate that violent events in the nuclei of some galaxies and in quasars might be associated with the onset of such a collapse, or with encounters between an already collapsed cluster (black hole) and surrounding stars."},{"pageNumber":715,"pageContent":", CHAPTER 26 STELLAR PULSATIONS §26.1. MOTIVATION This chapter is entirely Track 2. but it neither depends on nor prepares for any other chapter. . The raison d' etre of this chapter In relativistic astrophysics, as elsewhere in physics, most problems of deep physical interest are too difficult and too complex to be solved exactly. They can be solved only by use of approximation techniques. And of all approximation techniques, the one that has the widest range of application is perturbation theory. Perturbation calculations are typically long, tedious, and filled with complicated mathematical expressions. Therefore, they are not appropriate for a textbook such as this. Nevertheless, because it is so important that aspiring astrophysicists know how to set up and carry out perturbation calculations in general relativity, the authors have chosen to present one example in detail. The example chosen is an analysis of adiabatic, radial pulsations of a nonrotating, relativistic star. Two features of this example are noteworthy: (l) it is sufficiently complex to be instructive, but sufficiently simple to be presentable; (2) in the results of the calculation one can discern and quantify the relativistic instability that is so important for modem astrophysics (see Chapter 24). The calculation presented here is patterned after that of Chandrasekhar (1964a, b), which first revealed the existence of the relativistic instability. For an alternative calculation, based on the concept of \"extremal energy,\" see Appendix B of Harrison, Thome, Wakano, and Wheeler (1965); and for a calculation based on extremal entropy, see Cocke (1965). The authors are deeply indebted to Mr. Carlton M: Caves, who found and corrected many errors in the equations of this chapter and of a dozen other chapters."},{"pageNumber":716,"pageContent":"§26.2. SETIING UP THE PROBLEM §26.2. SETTING UP THE PROBLEM 689 The system to be analyzed is a sphere of perfect fluid, pulsating radially with very small amplitude.

It will be useful to rewrite them here, with a few changes of notation (use of su bscript \"0\" to denote \"unperturbed configuration\"; use of A = -i In (l - 2m/r) in place of m in all equations; use of a prime to denote derivatives with respect to r): Setting up the analysis of stellar pulsations Equilibrium configuration of star ds Z = - eZqJo dt Z + eZAo dr z + rZ(d(}Z + sin Z (} depZ), Ao' = ir (l - e ZAo ) + 4?Trp o e ZAo , Po' = - (Po + Po)lPo', lP o ' = - ir (l - e2 Ao ) + 4?Trp o e2 Ao . b.

Equations of Evolution The evolution of the perturbation functions with time will be governed by the Einstein field equations, the local law of conservation of energy-momentum V . T = 0, and the laws of thermodynamics-all appropriately linearized. The analysis from here on is nothing but a reduction of those equations to \"manageable form.\" Of course, the reduction will proceed most efficiently if one knows in advance what form one seeks. The goal in this calculation and in most similar calculations is simple: (l) obtain a set of dynamic equations for the true dynamic degrees of freedom (only the fluid displacement ~ in this case; the fluid displacement and the amplitudes of the gravitational waves in a nonspherical case, where waves are possible); and (2) obtain a set of initial-value equations expressing the remaining perturbation functions (SiP, SA, Sp, Sp, and Sn in this case) in terms of the dynamic degrees of freedom (~). §26.3.

ALBERT EINSTEIN (1949b. p. 684) §27.1. THE HOMOGENEITY AND ISOTROPY OF THE UNIVERSE (conlinued on page 711) Astronomical observations reveal that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on scales of _10 8 light years and larger. Taking a \"fine-scale\" point of view, one sees the agglomeration of matter into stars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies in regions of size -1 light year, _10 6 light years, and -3 X 10 7 light years, respec- tively. But taking instead a\"large-scale\" viewpoint, one sees little difference between an elementary volume of the universe of the order of 10 8 light years on a side centered on the Earth and other elementary volumes of the same size located elsewhere. Cosmology, summarized in its simplest form in Box 27.1, takes the large-scale viewpoint as its first approximation; and as its second approximation, it treats the fine-scale structure as a perturbation on the smooth, large-scale background. This chapter (27) treats in detail the large-scale, homogeneous approximation. Chapter 28 considers such small-scale phenomena as the primordial formation of the ele- ments, and the condensation of galaxies out of the primeval plasma during the expansion of the universe. Chapter 29 discusses observational cosmology. Evidence for the large-scale homogeneity and isotropy of the universe comes from several sources. (1) There is evidence in the distribution of galaxies on the sky and in the distribution of their apparent magnitudes and redshifts [see, e.g., Hubble (1934b, 1936); Sandage (1972a); Sandage, Tamman, and Hardy (1972); but note the papers claiming \"hierarchic\" deviations from homogeneity, which Sandage cites and attacks]. (2) There is evidence in the isotropy of the distribution of radio sources on the sky [see, e.g., Holden (1966), and Hughes and Longair (1967)]. (3) There is evidence in the remarkable isotropy of the cosmic microwave radiation [see, e.g., Boughn, Fram, and Partridge (1971 )].

From the standpoint of the theory of relativity, the condition for a closed surface is very much simpler than the corresponding boundary condition at infinity of the quasi-Euclidean structure of the universe. \"2. The idea that Mach expressed, that inertia depends upon the mutual action of bodies, is contained, to a first approximation, in the equations of the theory of relativity; ... But this idea of Mach's corresponds only to a finite universe, bounded in space, and not to a quasi-Euclidean, infinite universe\" [Einstein (1950), pp. 107-108).

This component of Einstein's equation is as central as the component V· E = 4'lTp of Maxwell's equations. It is described in the Track-2 Chapter 21 as the \"initial-value equation\" of geometrodynamics. There the two terms on the left receive separate names: the \"second invariant\" of the \"extrinsic curvature\" of a \"spacelike slice\" through the 4-geometry (tells how rapidly all linear dimensions are being stretched from instant to instant); and the \"intrinsic curvature\" or three- dimensional scalar curvature invariant (31R of the \"spacelike slice\" (here a 3-sphere) at the given instant itself.

The value of a max is uniquely specified by the amount of matter present, and by nothing more. There is no such thing as an \"adjustable constant of energy,\" such as there would have been in a traditional problem of Newtonian dynamics. Where such an adjustable parameter might have appeared in equation (6), there appears instead the fixed number\" -I.\" This fixity is the decisive feature of a system bound up into closure. Were one dealing with a collection of rocks out in space, one would have a choice about the amount of dynamite one placed at their center. With a low charge of explosive, one would find the rocks flying out for only a limited distance before gravity halted their flight and brought them to collapse together again. With more propellant, they would fly out with escape velocity and never return. But no such options present themselves here, exactly because Einstein's condition of closure has been imposed; and once closed, always closed. Collapse of the universe is universal. This is simple cosmology in brief. Einstein's unhappiness at this result was great. At the time he developed general relativity, the permanence of the universe was a fixed item of belief in Western philosophy: \"The heavens endure from everlasting to everlasting.\" Yet the reasoning that led to the fixed equation left open no natural way to change that equation or its fantastic prediction. Therefore Einstein (1917), much against his will, introduced the least unnatural change he could imagine, a so-called cosmological term (§27.ll), the whole purpose of which was to avoid the expansion of the universe. A decade later, Hubble (1929) verified the predicted expansion. Thereupon Einstein aban- doned the cosmological term, calling it \"the biggest blunder of my life\" [Einstein (1970)]. Thus ended thenrst great cycle of apparent contradiction to general relativity, test, and dramatic vindication. Will one ever penetrate the mystery of creation? There is no more inspiring evidence that the answer will someday be \"yes\" than man's power to predict, and predict correctly, and predict against all expectations, so fantastic a phenomenon as the expansion of the universe. \"Newtonian cosmology\" provides an \"equation of energy\" similar to that of Einstein cosmology, but fails to provide any clean or decisive argument for closure or for the unique constant\" -I.\" It considers the mass in any elementary spherical region of space of momentary radius r, and the gravitational acceleration of a test particle at the boundary of this sphere toward the center of the sphere; thus, (mass) (distance )2 = (4'lT/3)pr 3 4'lTp r2 = --3- r .

Free fall of a particle towards a Newtonian center of attraction according to Newtonian mechanics gives an equation of energy of the same form as (6), except that the \"radius of the universe,\" a, is replaced by distance, r, from the center of B attraction. The solution of this problem of free fall is described by a cycloid (diagram B; see also Figure 25.3 and Box 25.4), generated by rolling a circle of diameter a max on a line through an ever increasing angle 1); thus, 1 a = 2\" a max (1 - cos 1)), t = i a rnax (1) - sin 1)).

No such satisfactory concord between prediction and obser- vation on this inequality existed in the 1940's. The scale of distances between galaxy and galaxy in use at that time was short by a factor more than five.

Then the scale of galactic distances was set straight. Thus ended the second great cycle of an apparent contradiction to general relativity, then test, and then dramatic vindication. The mystery of the missing matter marks a third cycle of doubt and test with the final decision yet to come.

STRESS-ENERGY CONTENT OF UNIVERSE-FLUID IDEALIZATION §27.2. STRESS-ENERGY CONTENT OF THE UNIVERSE- THE FLUID IDEALIZATION 711 By taking the large-scale viewpoint, one can treat galaxies as \"particles\" of a \"gas\" that fills the universe. These particles have internal structure (stars, globular clusters, etc.); but one ignores it. The \"particles\" cluster on a small scale (clusters of galaxies of size ~3 X 10 7 light years); but one ignores the clustering. To simplify calculations, one even ignores the particulate nature of the \"gas\" [though one can take it into account, if one wishes, by adopting a kinetic-theory description; see §22.6 for kinetic theory, and Ehlers, Geren, and Sachs (1968) for its application to cosmology]. One removes the particulate structure of the gas from view by treating it in the perfect- fluid approximation. Thus, one characterizes the gas by a 4-velocity, u (the 4-velocity of an observer who sees the galaxies in his neighborhood to have no mean motion), by a density of mass-energy, p (the smoothed-out density of mass-energy seen in the frame with 4-velocity u; this includes the rest mass plus kinetic energy of the galaxies in a unit volume, divided by the volume), and by a pressure p (the kinetic pressure of the galaxies).

The evidence is very strong that this cosmic microwave radia- tion is a remnant of the big-bang beginning of the universe. This interpretation will be accepted here. The cosmic microwave radiation has just the form one would expect if the earth were enclosed in a box (\"black-body cavity\") with temperature 2.7K. The spectrum is a Planck spectrum with this temperature, and the radiation is isotropic [Boughn, Fram, and Partridge (1971 )].

GEOMETRIC IMPLICATIONS OF HOMOGENEITY AND ISOTROPY (27.llb) This chapter will idealize the universe to be completely homogeneous and isotropic. This idealization places tight constraints on the geometry of spacetime and on the motion of the cosmological fluid through it. In order to discover these constraints, one must first give precise mathematical meaning to the concepts of homogeneity and isotropy. Homogeneity means, roughly speaking, that the universe is the same everywhere at a given moment of time. A given moment of what time? Whose time? This is the crucial question that the investigator asks. In Newtonian theory there is no ambiguity about the concept \"a given moment of time.\" In special relativity there is some ambiguity because of the nonuniversality of simultaneity, but once an inertial reference frame has been specified, the concept becomes precise. In general relativity there are no global inertial frames (unless spacetime is flat); so the concept of \"a given moment of time\" is completely ambigu- ous. However, another, more general concept replaces it: the concept of a three- dimensional spacelike hypersurface. This hypersurface may impose itself on one's Spacelike hypersurface as generalization of \"moment of time\""},{"pageNumber":741,"pageContent":"714 27. IDEALIZED COSMOLOGIES \"Homogeneity of universe\" defined in terms of spacelike hypersurfaces \"Isotropy of universe\" defined Isotropy implies fluid world lines orthogonal to homogeneous hypersurfaces attention by reason of natural symmetries in the spacetime. Or it may be selected at the whim or convenience of the investigator. He may find it more convenient to explore spacetime here and there than elsewhere, and to push the hypersurface forward accordingly (\"many-fingered time\"; the dramatically new conception of time that is part of general relativity). At each event on a spacelike hypersurface, there is a local Lorentz frame whose surface of simultaneity coincides locally with the hypersurface. Of course, this Lorentz frame is the one whose 4-velocity is orthogonal to the hypersurface. These Lorentz frames at various events on the hypersurface do not mesh to form a global inertial frame, but their surfaces of simultaneity do mesh to form the spacelike hypersurface itself. The intuitive phrase \"at a given moment of time\" translates, in general relativity, into the precise phrase \"on a given spacelike hypersurface.\" The investigator can go further. He can \"slice up\" the entire spacetime geometry by means of a \"one- parameter family\" of such spacelike surfaces. He can give the parameter that distinguishes one such slice from the next the name of \"time.\" Such a one-parameter family of slices through spacetime is not required in the Regge calculus of Chapter 42. However, such a \"slicing\" is a necessity in most other practical methods for analyzing the dynamics of the geometry of the universe (Chapters 21, 30, and 43~ The choice of slicing may dissolve away the difficulties of the dynamic analysis or may merely recognize those difficulties. The successive slices of \"moments of time\" may shine with simplicity or may only do a tortured legalistic bookkeeping for the dynamics. Which is the case depends on whether the typical spacelike hypersurface is distinguished by natural symmetries or, instead, is drawn arbitrarily. Homogeneity of the universe means, then, that through each event in the universe there passes a spacelike \"hypersurface of homogeneity\" (physical conditions identical at every event on this hypersurface). At each event on such a hypersurface the density, p, and pressure, p, must be the same; and the curvature of spacetime must be the same. The concept of isotropy must also be made precise. Clearly, the universe cannot look isotropic to all observers. For example, an observer riding on a 10 20 eV cosmic ray will see the matter of the universe rushing toward him from one direction and receding in the opposite direction. Only an observer who is moving with the cosmo- logical fluid can possibly see things as isotropic. One considers such observers in defining isotropy: Isotropy of the universe means that, at any event, an observer who is \"moving with the cosmological.fluid\" cannot distinguish one of his space directions from the others by any local physical measurement. Isotropy of the universe actually implies homogeneity; of this one can convince oneself by elementary reasoning (exercise 27.1). Isotropy guarantees that the world lines of the cosmological.fluid are orthogonal to each hypersurface of homogeneity. This one sees as follows. An observer \"moving with the fluid\" can discover by physical measurements on which hypersurface through a given event conditions are homogeneous. Moreover, he can measure his own ordinary velocity relative to that hypersurface.· If that ordinary velocity is nonzero, it provides the observer with a way to distinguish one space direction in"},{"pageNumber":742,"pageContent":"§27.4.

Thus in an isotropic universe, where the concept of \"observer moving with the fluid\" makes sense, each such observer must discover that he is at rest relative to the hypersurface of homogeneity. His world line is orthogonal to that hypersurface. Exercise 27.1. ISOTROPY IMPLIES HOMOGENEITY EXERCISE Use elementary thought experiments to show that isotropy of the universe implies homoge- neity. §27.4, COMOVING, SYNCHRONOUS COORDINATE SYSTEMS FOR THE UNIVERSE The results of the last section enable one to set up special coordinate systems in the spacetime manifold of an isotropic model universe (Figure 27.1). Choose a hypersurface of homogeneity S/. To all the events on it assign coordinate time, t I . Layout, in any manner desired, a grid of space coordinates (xl, x 2 , x 3 ) on S[\" \"Propagate\" these coordinates off SI and throughout all spacetime by means of the world lines of the cosmological fluid. In particular, assign to every event on a given world line the space coordinates (xl, x 2 , x 3 ) at which that world line intersects SI' This assignment has a simple consequence. The fluid is always at rest relative to the space coordinates. In-other words, the space coordinates are \"comoving':' they are merely labels for the world lines of the fluid. For the time coordinate t of a given event 9, use the lapse of proper time, f dr, of 9 from Sb as measured along the fluid world line that passes through 9, plus t I (\"standard of time\" on the initial hypersurface SI); thus, Construction of a \"comoving, synchronous\" coordinate system for the universe ( 'j' ) t(9) = t I + dr ~l along world llne of fiuld (27.12) The surfaces t = constant of such a coordinate system will coincide with the hyper- surfaces of homogeneity of the universe. This one sees by focusing attention on observations made by two different observers, A and B, who move with the fluid along different world lines. At coordinate time t I (on SI) the universe looks the same to B as to A. Let A and B make observations again after their clocks have ticked away the same time interval Lh. Homogeneity of the initial hypersurface Sb plus the deterministic nature of Einstein's field equations, guarantees that A and B will again see identical physics. (Identical initial conditions on Sb plus identical lapses of proper time during which Einstein's equations govern the evolution of the universe near A and B, guarantee identical final conditions.)

By virtue of definition (27.12) of coordinate time, the time coordinate at the intersection of B's world line with this new hypersurface is t = t f + LIT; and similarly for A.

Because the hypersurfaces of homogeneity are given by t =' constant, the basis vectors a /ax i at any given event 9 are tangent to the hypersurface of homogeneity that goes through that event. On the other hand, the time basis vector, a/at, is tangent to the world line of the fluid through 9, since that world line has xi = constant along it. Consequently, orthogonality of the world line to the hypersurface guarantees orthogonality of a/at to a/ax i : (a/at)· (a/ax i ) = 0 for i = 1,2,3.

Assume that one knows the initial 3-geometry-i.e., the coefficients in the space part of the metric, (27.16) on the initial hypersurface Sf-in its arbitrary but explicitly chosen coordinate system. What form will the metric coefficients gik(t, x k ) have on the other hypersurfaces of homogeneity? This question is easily answered by the following argument: Consider two adjacent world lines, {/ and !XJ, of the cosmological fluid, with coordinates (xl, x 2 , x 3 ) and (Xl + .:!xl, x 2 + .:!x 2 , x 3 + .:!x 3 ). At time t[ (on surface Sf) they are separated by the proper distance (27.17) At some later time t (on surface S), they will be separated by some other proper distance .1o(t). Isotropy of spacetime guarantees that the ratio of separations .1o(t)/ .10 (t[) will be independent of the direction from {/ to qJ (no shearing motion of the fluid). For any given direction, the additivity of small separations guarantees that .10 (t)/ .10 (t[) will be independent of .1o(t[). Thus .1o(t)/ .10 (t[) must be the same for all pairs of world lines near a given world line. Finally, homogeneity guarantees that this scalar ratio will be independent of position on the initial surface S[-i.e., independent of xl, x 2 , x 3 • Define a(t) to be this spatially constant ratio, a(t) .10 (t)/ .1o(t[). (27.18) Thus, a(t) is the factor by which the separations of world lines expand between time t[ and time t. In other words, the function a(t) is a universal \"expansion factor,\" or \"scale factor.\" By combining equations (27.17) and (27.18), one obtains for the separation of adjacent world lines at time t .1o(t) = a(t)[Yij(x k ) .:!xi .:!x i ]l/2.

Notice that the coefficients \"Yij(X k ) describe the shape not only of the initial hypersurface, but also of all other hypersurfaces of homogeneity.

All distances between spatial grid points (fluid world lines) expand by the same factor a(t), leaving the shape of the hypersurface unchanged. This is a consequence of homogeneity and isotropy; and it is precisely true only if the model universe is precisely homogeneous and isotropic. Of all the disturbing implications of \"the expansion of the universe,\" none is more upsetting to many a student on first encounter than the nonsense of this idea.

Therefore it is appropriate in many contexts to continue to regard a(t) as a factor of relative expansion, the absolute value of which one tries to keep from entering into any equation exactly because it is difficult to determine.

The resulting geom- etry is still described by the line element (16), but now all three spatial coordinates are \"cyclic,\" like the ep coordinate of a spherical coordinate system: (t, x,y, z) is the same event as (t, x + L,y + L, z + L). The homogeneous hypersurfaces are now \"3-tor- uses\" of finite volume V = a 3 L3, analogous to the 3-toruses which one· meets under the name \"periodic boundary conditions\" when analyzing electron waves and acoustic waves in solids and electromagnetic waves in space. Another example: The 3-sphere described in part A above (case of \"positive curvature\") has the same geometry, but not the same topology, as the manifold of the rotation group, SO(3) [see exer- cises 9.12, 9.13, 10.16, and 11.12].

Nonuniqueness of Topology Warning: Although the demand for homogeneity and isotropy determines completely the local geo- metric properties of a hypersurface of homogene- ity up to the single disposable factor K, it leaves the global topology of the hypersurface undeter- mined. The above choices of topology are the most straightforward. But other choices are possible. This arbitrariness shows most simply when the hypersurface is flat (k = 0).

IDEALIZED COSMOLOGIES §27.7. EQUATIONS OF MOTION FOR THE FLUID After the above analysis of anyone hypersurface of homogeneity, return to the dynamics of the universe. Examine, first, the evolution ofthe fluid, as governed by the law V . T = 0. Recall (§22.3 and 23.5) that for a perfect fluid the equations of motion split into two parts. The component along the 4-velocity, u' (V . T) = 0, reproduces the first law of thermodynamics (d/dr)(pV) = -p(dVjdr), (27.28a) Euler equation is vacuous for a homogeneous universe where V is the volume of any fluid element. The part orthogonal to the 4-velocity, (g + u @ u) . (V . T) = 0, gives the force equation (\"Euler equation\") (p + p) X (4-acce1eration) = - (component of Vp orthogonal to u). (27.28b) For a static star (§23.5) the first law of thermodynamics was vacuous, but the force equation was crucial. For a homogeneous universe, the converse is true; the force equation is vacuous (no accelerations), but the first law of thermodynamics is crucial. To see that the force equation is vacuous, notice that isotropy guarantees the vanishing of both sides of equation (27.28b). If either side were nonzero at any event '!l, it would distinguish a direction in the homogeneous hypersurface at '!l. In applying the first law of thermodynamics (27.28a) to cosmology, divide the density and pressure into contributions due to matter and contributions due to radiation: P = Pm + Pr' (27.29) \"Equations of state\" for matter and radiation First discuss the density of mass-energy. Today Pm(~ 10- 31 g/cm 3 ) dominates over Pr( _10- 33 g/cm 3 ). Matter did not always dominate. Therefore, one cannot set Pr = 0. Now discuss the pressure. During that epoch of the universe when pressure was significant cosmologically, Pr dominated over Pm' Consequently, one can neglect Pm at all times, and one can use the \"equation of state\" for radiation, Pr = ~Pr' to write 1 P = \"3Pr' (27.30) When (27.30) is inserted into the first law of thermodynamics (27.28a), it yields the result (27.31 ) Energy exchange between matter and radiation is negligible One cannot integrate this equation until one knows how mass-energy is fed back and forth between matter and radiation-i.e., until one knows another relationship between Pm V and P r V.

EQUATIONS OF MOTION FOR THE FLUID 727 negligible compared to Pm Vand P r V individually (see §28.l). Under these conditions, equation (2731) can be split into two parts: (2732a) and First law of thermodynamics used to express densities of radiation and matter in terms of expansion factor The solutions are simple: Pm V = constant (conservation of matter) and P P r V4I3 = const = V-~/3 V (constancy of nUmber) ..--- __ t of photons jenergy he/A of l one photon, up to a factor of jproportionalitYj Now what is V?

Therefore the element ofhyperspher- ical solid angle I2 sin 8 .1X.18 &p (or pseudohyperspherical solid angle for the model of an open universe) is constant throughout all time for any fluid element. Therefore the volume of the fluid element grows in direct proportion to the cube of the expansion parameter a; thus, V/aJ = constant. Combining this result with the constancy of PmV and P r V4I3, one sees that p m a 3 = constant, p~4 = constant. (2734) Let P mo be the density of matter today, Pro be the density of radiation today, and a o be the expansion factor for the universe today. Then, at any time in the past, and a~ ~ p(t) = P mo a 3 (t) + Pro a 4 (t) 1 a 4 p(t) = '3 Pro a4(t) . (2735a) (2735b)"},{"pageNumber":755,"pageContent":"728 27. IDEALIZED COSMOLOGIES These results were based on two key claims, which will be justified in detail later (Chapter 28): the claim that in the epoch when pressure was important Pm was much smaller than Pr; and the claim that exchange of mass-energy between radiation and matter was always negligible (except in the first few seconds after the \"creation\"). §27.8. THE EINSTEIN FIELD EQUATION Once the time evolution of the expansion factor, a(t), is known, one can read off the time evolution of the density and pressure directly from equations (27.35). The density and pressure, in tum, determine how the expansion proceeds in time, via Einstein's field equations. Thus the field equations \"close the logic loop\" and give one a closed mathematical system from which to determine all three quantities, a(t), p(t) and p(t). One can readily calculate the components of the Einstein tensor for the model universe using the orthonormal basis one-forms, wl=dt, W x = a(t)dX, w 8 = a(t)'s dO, w¢ = a(t)'s sin 0 dep. (27.36) Evaluation of the Einstein field equation for a homogeneous universe: The result [see equations (5) of Box 14.5] is ( a)2 3k G·· = 3...L +-, tt a a 2 G~. = 0 if JL 1= v. (27.37 a) (27.37b) (27.37c) (With foresight, one will notice ahead of time that isotropy guarantees the equality G xx = G 88 = G ¢¢' and similar equalities for the Riemann tensor; and one will calculate only G xx ' the component that is most easily calculated.) The basis one-forms, Wi, w X , w 8 , w¢, are the orthonormal basis carried along by an observer who moves with the \"cosmological fluid.\" Consequently, Ttl is the mass-energy density, p, that he measures; T,\"1 is the pressure,p; Tt; vanishes, because he sees no energy flux (no momentum density); and 1;; vanishes for i 1= j because he sees no shear stresses: T tt = p, T xx = T 88 = T¢¢ = p, T~. = 0 when JL 1= v. (27.38a) (27.38b) (27.38c) Equate the Einstein (\"moment of rotation\") tensor of equations (27.37) to the stress-energy tensor of equations (27.38). And if one insists, include the so-called \"A-term\" or \"cosmological term\" in the field equations [Einstein (1970): \"the biggest blunder of my life\"). Thus obtain two nonvacuous field equations. The first is an"},{"pageNumber":756,"pageContent":"\"initial value equation,\" which relates a,l to a and p at any initial moment of time: §27.B.

In accordance with this comparison, note that one only has to differentiate (27.39a) and combine it with the relation satisfied by the pressure, (\"law of conservation of energy\") to get the acceleration equation (27.39b). Without any loss of information, one can therefore ignore the \"acceleration equation\" or \"dynamic equation\" (27.39b) henceforth, and work with the analog of an energy equation or what is more properly known as an \"initial-value equation\" (details of initial-value problem for \"frack-2 readers in Chapter 21). What shows up here in the limited context of Friedmann cosmology is appropri- ately viewed in the wider context of general geometrodynamics. Conservation of energy plus one field equation have just been seen to reproduce the other field equations. Conversely, by accepting both field equations, one can derive the law of conservation of energy in the form just stated. Thus, the very act of writing the field equation G = 8'ITT (or, if one insists upon the \"cosmological term,\" G + Ag = 8'ITT) ~ omit was encouraged by and founded on the automatic vanishing of the divergence V • G (or the vanishing of the divergences of G and g), because one knew to begin with that energy and momentum are conserved, V • T = 0. It is not surprising, then, that there should be a redundancy between the conservation law, V· T = 0, and the field equations. Neither is it surprising in the dynamics of the Friedmann universe that one can use what is here the one and only interesting component of the conser- vation law, plus the one and only interesting initial value component (Gii component) of the field equations, to obtain the one and only interesting dynamic component (G xx component) of the field equations.

IDEALIZED COSMOLOGIES In a similar way, in more general problems that lack symmetry, one can always eliminate some of the dynamic field equations, but when gravitational radiation is present, one cannot eliminate them all. The dynamic field equations that cannot . be eliminated, even in principle, govern the propagation of the gravitational waves. No gravitational waves are present in a perfectly homogeneous and isotropic cos- mological model; its high degree of symmetry-in particular, its spherical (2-sphere!) symmetry about X = O-is incompatible with gravitational waves. Now turn back from general dynamics to Friedmann cosmology. To determine the time evolution of the expansion factor, a, insert into the initial-value equation (27.39a) the expression for the density of mass-energy given in (2735a), and arrive at an equation ready for integration, Differential equation for expansion factor ( a )2 _,t = a (27.40) omit (8 'IT /3)p(a) When one has completed the integration of this equation for a = aCt), one turns back to equation (2735a,b) to get pet) and pet), and to expression (27.24) to get the geometry, (27.41 ) Three choices of time parameter for universe: (1) proper time, t (2) expansion factor, a thus completing the solution of the problem. §27.9. TIME PARAMETERS AND THE HUBBLE CONSTANT To the analysis of this dynamic problem, many investigators have contributed over the years, beginning with Friedmann himself in 1922. They discovered, among other results, that there are three natural choices of time variable, the one of greatest utility depending on the application that one has at hand. First is t, the original time variable. This quantity gives directly proper time elapsed since the start of the expansion. This is the time available for the formation of galaxies. It is also the time during which radioactive decay and other physical processes have been taking place. Second is aCt), the expansion factor, which grows with time, which therefore serves to distinguish one phase of the expansion from another, and which consequently can be regarded as a parametric measure of time in its own right. The ratio of aCt) at two times gives the ratio of the dimensions of the universe (cube root of volume) at those two times. It also gives the ratio (l + z) of wavelengths at those two times (see §29.2). A knowledge of the red shift, z, experienced in time past by radiation received today is equivalent to a knowledge of a(t)/a o ' where a o is the expansion factor today. Specifically, radiation coming in with z = 999 is radiation coming in from a time in the history of the universe when it had 10- 3 of its present dimensions and 10- 9 of its present volume.

Only the words \"hypersphere\" and \"are\" have to be replaced by the corresponding words for a flat hypersurface of homogeneity (k = 0) or a hyperbol- oidal hypersurface (k = -1). In all three cases, the \"arc parameter\" is defined by the integral of this expression from the start of the expansion: r t dt 1'/ = J o a(t); thus small values of the \"arc parameter time,\" 1'/, mean early times; and larger values mean later times. In terms of this \"arc-parameter measure of time,\" the metric takes the form (27.46) Let a photon start at the \"North Pole\" of the 3-sphere (X = 0; any () and cp) at the \"arc parameter time\" 1'/ = 1'/1' Then, by the \"arc parameter time\" 1'/ = 1'/2' the photon has traveled to a new point on the hypersphere and encountered a new set of particles of the \"cosmological fluid.\" They lie at the hyperpolar angle X = 1'/2 - 1'/1' When one makes a spacetime diagram on a piece of paper to show what is happening when an effect propagates from one point to another in the universe, one finds it most convenient to take (l) the space coordinate to be X (the life histories of distinct particles of the \"cosmological fluid\" thus being represented by distinct vertical lines), and (2) the time coordinate to be 1'/ (so that photons ate described by lines inclined at +45°).

(27.48) Hubble constant and Hubble time An equation (27.40) for the expansion factor and a choice of parameters for marking out time have now set the stage for a detailed analysis of idealized cosmol- ogy, and some of the relevant questions have even been asked: How does the characteristic dimension, a, of the geometry (radius of3-sphere, in the case of closure) change with time? What is the spacetime geometry? How do geodesics, especially null geodesics, travel in this geometry? However, additional questions are equally important: Is the expansion of the universe decelerating and, if so, how fast? How do density and pressure of matter and radiation vary with time? And finally, for the simplest and most immediate tie between theory and observation, what is the expansion rate? In speaking of expansion rate, one refers to the \"Hubb1e constant,\" the fractional rate of increase of distances, H= ti(t) , a(t) (27.49) which is normally evaluated today H(today) = H o ' but is in principle defined as a function of time for every phase of the history of the universe. The reciprocal of H is the \"Hubble time,\" H-l. This quantity represents the time it would have taken for the galaxies to attain their present separations, starting from a condition of infinite compaction, if they had maintained for all time their present velocities (\"time for expansion with dimensions linearly extrapolated back to the start\").

One is left with the radiations of zero rest mass, and only these radiations, contributing to the specific heat of the vacuum. At the phases of baryon-antibaryon and electron- positron annihilation, the thermal gravitational radiation present has already effec- tively decoupled itself from the matter, according to all current estimates. Therefore the energy set free by annihilation of matter and antimatter is expected to pour at first into the other two carriers of energy: neutrinos and electromagnetic radiation. However, the neutrinos also decouple early (after baryon-antibaryon annihilation; before full electron-positron annihilation), because the mean free path for neutrinos"},{"pageNumber":764,"pageContent":"rises rapidly with expansion. The energy of the subsequent annihilations goes almost exclusively into electromagnetic radiation. Thus the temperatures of the three radia- tions at the present time are expected to stand in the order §27.10. FRIEDMANN COSMOLOGY OF A CLOSED UNIVERSE 737 (27.56) T em has been measured to be 2.7 K; Tv is calculated to be (4/11)1/3 T em = 1.9 K, and Til has been calculated to be 1.5 K [Matzner (1968)] in a model where gravitons decouple during an early, quark-dominated era. Decoupled radiation, once in a Planck spectrum, remains in a Planck spectrum (see Box 29.2). Expansion leaves constant the product Pr,decoupled a4 or the product T,.~decoUP1ed a4.

Find G now Tr,fld = -a- Tr,now = (1 + z)T,.,now· fld (27.57) Here z represents the red shift of any \"tracer\" spectral line, given off at the fiducial time, and observed today, relative to the standard wavelength of the same transition as observed in the laboratory. If the three radiations could be catalyzed into thermodynamic equilibrium, then all radiations could be treated on the same footing during the radiation-domi- nated era of cosmology. Their individual f values could be added directly to give f = 8 + 8 + 7 + 7 = 30. Temperature and time would then be connected by the formula . (1'/10 10 K)2(t/l sec) = 1.19. This formula together with (27.57) implies the relation [( T,.,now ) (1 + Z)]2(~) = 1.19. 10 10 K 1 sec (27.58a) (27.58b) This relation concerns two radiations: (1) the actual electromagnetic radiation with Planck spectrum (a continuum); and (2) the redshift and time of emission of a \"tracer radiation\" (a line spectrum). A measured departure from this relation could serve as one potential (indirect) indication that, in accordance with standard theory,· neutrinos and gravitational radiation today are cooler than electromagnetic radiation. Turn now from the radiation-dominated era of cosmology to the matter-dominated era. Numbers sometimes elicit more response from the imagination than formulas. Therefore idealize to a matter-dominated cosmology, and for the moment arbitrarily adopt 20 X 10 9 yr and 10 X 10 9 yr as Hubble time and actual time, respectively, back to the start of the expansion.

Many Schwarzschild zoneS are fitted together to make a closed uni- verse. This universe is dynamic because a test particle at the interface between two zones rises up against the gravitational attraction of each and falls back under the gravitational attraction of each. Therefore the two centers themselves have to move apart and move back to- gether again. The same being true for all other pairs of centers, it follows that the lattice universe itself expands and recontracts, even though each Schwarzschild geometry individually is viewed as static. This diagram is taken from Lindquist and Wheeler (1957). If every five seconds a volume of space is added to the universe, a volume equivalent to a cube 10 5 lyr (= 0.95 X 10 23 em) on an edge, about equal to the volume occupied by the Milky Way, where does that volume make its entry? Rather than look for an answer, one had better reexamine the question. Space is not like water. The o'utpouring of fresh water beneath the ocean at the Jesuit Spring off Mount Desert Island can be detected and measured by surrounding the site with flowmeters. There is no such thing as a flowmeter to tell \"how fast space is streaming past.\" The very idea that \"space flows\" is mistaken. There is no way to define a flow of space, not least because there is no way to measure a flow of space. Water, yes; space, no. Life is very different for the flowmeter, according as it is stationary or moving with respect to the water. For a particle in empty space, however, physics is indistinguishable regardless of whether the particle is at rest or moves at high velocity relative to some chosen inertial frame. To try to pinpoint where those cubic kilometers of space get born is a mistaken idea, because it is a meaningless idea. One can get a fresh perspective on what is going on in expansion and recontraction by turning from a homogeneous isotropic closed universe to a Schwarzschild lattice closed universe. [Lindquist and Wheeler (1957)]. In the former case, the mass is idealized as distributed uniformly. In the latter, the mass is concentrated into 120 identical Schwarzschild black holes. Each is located at the center of its own cell, of dodecahedral shape, bounded by 12 faces, each approximately a pentagon; and space is empty. The dynamics is easy to analyze in the approximation in which each lattice cell is idealized as spherical, a type of treatment long familiar in solid-state physics as the \"Wigner-Seitz approximation\" (references in Lindquist and Wheeler). In this approximation, the geometry inside each lattice cell is treated as having exactly the Schwarzschild character (Figure 27.3); a test particle placed midway between black hole A and black hole B rises against the attraction of each, and ultimately falls back toward each, according to the law developed in Chapter 25 [equation (25.28) with a shift of 'IT in the starting point for defining 1j], (4) \"Where is the new space created during expansion?\" -a meaningless question r = ~ (I - COS1j), R ( R )1/2 1\" = - - (1j - sin1j) 2 2M . (27.61) Accordingly, the two masses in question must fall toward each other; and so it is with alI the masses. One comes out in this way with the conclusion that the lattice"},{"pageNumber":767,"pageContent":"universe follows the same law of expansion and recontraction as the Friedmann universe to an accuracy of better than 4 per cent [Lindquist and Wheeler; Wheeler (l964a), pp. 370-381]. Now ask again the same meaningless question about where the cubic kilometers of space pour into the universe while it is expanding, and where they pour out while it is recontracting. Receive a fuller picture why the question is meaningless. Surrounding each center of mass, the geometry is and remains the Schwarzschild geometry (until eventually the black holes come so close together that they coalesce). The situation inside each cell is therefore static. Moreover, the interface between cell and cell is defined in imagination by a sprinkling of test particles so light that they have no influence on the geometry or its dynamics. The matchup between the geometry in one cell and the next is smooth (\"tangency between the two geometries\"). There is nothing abnormal whatsoever in the space- time on and near the interface. One has as little right to say those cubic kilometers are \"created\".here as anywhere else. To speak of the \"creation\" of space is a bad way of speaking, and the original question is a bad question. The right way of speaking is to speak of a dynamic geometry. So much for one question! In charting the dynamics of the geometry of a Friedmann universe, one often finds that it simplifies things to take as space coordinate the hyperpolar angle X, measured from some chosen world line (moving with the \"cosmological fluid\") as standard of reference; and to take as time coordinate the arc-parameter measure of time, 1J, as illustrated in Figure 27.4. Inspection of the (X, 1J)-diagram makes it clear that photons emitted from matter at one point cannot reach, in a limited time, any matter except that which is located in a limited fraction of the 3-sphere. In a short time t, according to Box 27.3, a photon can cover an arc distance on the 3-sphere equal only to 1J = (2tla*)1/2. Moreover, what is true of photons is true of other fields, forces, pressures, energies and influences: they cannot reach beyond this limit. Evidently the 3-sphere at time t is divided into a number of \"zones,\" (5) causal isolation of various regions of universe from each other 740 27.

HOMOGENEOUS ISOTROPIC MODEL UNIVERSES THAT VIOLATE EINSTEIN'S CONCEPTION OF COSMOLOGY It violates Einstein's conception of cosmology (Box 27.1 )-though not the equations of his theory-to replace the closed 3-sphere of radius a by the open hyperboloidal geometry of equation (27.22) with the same scale length a. Even so, the results of Box 27.3 continue to apply in the two limiting regimes of matter-dominated and radiation-dominated dynamics when the following changes are made. (1) Change the constant - I on the righthand side of the analog of a \"Newtonian energy equation\" to + 1, thus going over from a bound system (maximum expansion) to an open system (forever expanding). (2) Replace (l - cos 1/) by (cosh 1/ - I), sin 1/ by sinh 1/, cos 1/ by cosh 1/, and (1/ - sin 1/) by (sinh 1/ - 1/). (3) The range of the \"arc parameter\" 1/ now extends from 0 to 00, and the curve relating \"radius\" a to time t changes from cycloid or circle to an ever-rising curve. (4) The listed inequalities on the Hubble time (as related to the actual time of expansion) and on the density (as related to 3H;/8'1T) no longer hold. (5) The formulas given in Box 27.3 for conditions at early times continue to hold, for a simple reason: at early times the curvature of spacetime \"in the direction of increasing time\" [the extrinsic curvature (6/a 2 )(da/dt}2 as it appears in Box 27.1, equation (2)] is overwhelmingly more important than the curvature within any hypersurface of homogeneity, -+-6/a 2 (the intrinsic curvature); therefore it makes no detectable difference at early times whether the sign is plus or minus, whether the space is closed or open, or whether the geometry of space is spherical or hyperboloidal. Why doesn't it make a difference? Not why mathematically, but why physically, doesn't it make a difference in early days whether the space is open or closed?"},{"pageNumber":770,"pageContent":"Because photons, signals, pressures, forces, and energies cannot get far enough to \"smell out\" the difference between closure and openness. The \"zones of influence\" of (27.62) are too small for anyone by itself to sense or to respond significantly to any difference between a negative space curvature -6/a 2 and a positive space curvature +6/a 2 • Therefore the simple power-law time-dependence of the density of the mass-energy of radiation given in Box 27.3 for a closed universe holds equally well in the earliest days of a radiation-dominated, open, isotropic model universe; thus, §27.11. MODEL UNIVERSES WITH k ~ a or A ':j; 0 743 (27.66) Only at a later stage of the expansion, when the \"extrinsic curvature\" term [equation (2), Box 27.1], (6/a 2 )(da/dt)2 (initially varying as 1.5t- 2 , according to Box 27.3) has fallen to a value of the same order of magnitude as the \"intrinsic curvature\" term -+-6/ a 2 (initially varying as -+-3a*-lt- 1 ), does the sign of the intrinsic curvature begin to matter. Only then do the differences in rate of expansion begin to show up that distinguish the open model universe from the closed one. The open model goes on expanding forever. Therefore the density of mass-energy, whether matter-dominated and proportional to ama:x./ a 3 , or radiation-dominated and proportional to a*2 / a 4 , or some combination of the two, (l) ultimately falls to a level that is negligible in comparison with the intrinsic curvature, -6/ a 2 , and (2) thereafter can be neglected. Under these circumstances, the only term left to balance the intrinsic curvature is the extrinsic curvature. The important component of the field equation (after removal from all terms of a common factor 3) now reads (3) late stage-expansion forever (27.67) For a closed universe, the two terms (one sixth the extrinsic curvature and one sixth the intrinsic curvature) have the same sign, and any equation like (27.67) leads to an impossibility. Here, however, rather than impossibility, one has the remarkably simple solution and the corresponding metric a = t, (27.68) Write r = t sinh x, t new = t cosh X, (27.69) (27.70) and find that (27.69), solution as it is of Einstein's empty-space field equation, is identical with the Lorentz-Minkowski metric of flat spacetime, (27.71) (see Box 27.2C).

The typical spacelike hypersurface of homogeneity looks to have a curved 3-space geometry, and does have a curved geometry (instrinsic curvature), because the slice (27.70) through flat spacetime is itself curved (extrinsic curvature).

Thus one rephrases (27.72) as the \"generalized Friedmann equation,\" [d dt (aa(ot) )J2 + k V(a/a o ) = - -2 = -K o ' a o (27.74) Here the quantity (27.75) (2) qualitative features of evolution acts as an \"effective potential\" for the dynamics of the expansion. The constant term K o represents one sixth of the intrinsic curvature of the model universe today. Its negative, - K o ' plays the role of an \"effective energy\" in the generalized Friedmann equation (Box 27.5). All the qualitative features of the cosmology can be read off from the curve for the effective potential as a function of (a/ a o ) and from the value of K o ' For a quantitative analysis, the log-log diagram of Figure 27.5 is often more useful than the straight linear plot of V against (a/a o ) of Box 27.5.

In this expansion, a eventually increases as exp [(A/3) 1I2 t] irrespective of the openness or closure of the universe (k = 0, -+-1). This expansion dominates every other feature of the cosmology. Therefore, in dis- (3) de Sitter universe cussing it, it is appropriate to suppress every other feature of the cosmology, take the density of matter to be negligible, and take k = 0 (hypersurfaces of homogeneity endowed with flat 3-space geometry).

(27.79) (continued on page 748) Because of its beautiful group-theoretical properties and invariance with respect to 5 X 4/2 = 10 independent rotations, the de Sitter geometry has been the subject of scores of mathematical investigations. The physical implications of a cosmology following the de Sitter model are described for example by Robertson and Noonan (1968, especially their § 16.2). The de Sitter model is the only model obeying Ein- Stein's equations (with A =J. 0) which (1) continually expands and (2) looks the same to any observer who moves with the cosmological fluid, regardless of his position or his time. Any model of the universe satisfying condition (2) is said to obey the so-called \"perfect cosmological principle.\" This phrase arose in the past in studying models that lie outside the framework of general relativity, models in which matter is envisaged as continuously being created, and to which the name of \"steady-state universe\" has been given.

The contribution of radiation density to the effective potential is indicated by the wavy line in the diagram. It is normalized to a value of the radiation densily today of Pro = 10- 33 g/cm 3 and has a logarithmic slope of two. The contribution of matter density to the \"effective potential\" has a logarithmic slope of unity. Two choices are made for it. corresponding to a density of matter today of P mo = 10- 30 g/cm 3 and Pm. = 10- 28 g/cm 3 (dashed lines in the diagram). The total effective potential in the two cases is also indicated in the diagram: a heavy line for the case Pmo = 10- 30 g/cm 3 (no cosmological term included) and a light line for the case P mo = 10- 28 g/cm 3 • In this second case, a cosmological term is included. with the cosmological constant given by (3/Sr.)(A/3) = 10- 29 g/cm 3 • The line describing the contribution of this term has a negative slope of magnitude two (dashed line). The horizontal or \"level line\" is drawn for a value of the Hubble expansion rate today. H o ' equal to 1/(20 X 10 9 years).

For the high-density model universe, with P mo = 10- 28 g/cm 3 , one similarly finds I + K o H;2 = 24.5, hence K o = +23.5Hf\" hence k = + I (closed universe) and a o = (k/K o )1/2 = (1/23.5)112 20 X 10 9 yr = 4.12 X 10 9 yr.

This log-log plot should be replaced by the linear plot of Box 27.5 when A < O. However great a departure it is from Einstein's concept of cosmology to give any heed to a cosmological constant or an open universe, it is a still greater departure to contemplate a \"hierarchic model\" of the universe, in which clusters of galaxies, and clusters of clusters of galaxies, in this part of the universe are envisaged to grade off in density with distance, with space at great distances becoming asymptotically flat [Alfven and Klein (1962), Alfven (1971), Klein (1971), Moritz (1969), de Vau- couleurs (1971), Steigman (1971)]. The viewpoint adopted here is expressed by Oskar Klein in these words, \"Einstein's cosmology was adapted to the discovery by Hubble that the observed part is expanding; the so-called cosmological postulate has been used as a kind of an axiomatic background which, when analyzed, makes it appear that this expansion is shared by a very big, but still bounded system. This implies that our expanding metagalaxy is probably just one of a type of stellar objects in different phases of evolution, some expanding and some contracting.\""},{"pageNumber":776,"pageContent":"§27.11.

Analogy thus does not leave us to doubt that these systems [planets, stars, galaxies] have been formed and produced ... out of the smallest particles of the elementary matter that filled empty space.\" Goes on to consider seriously \"the successive expansion of the creation [of planets, stars, galaxies] through the infinite regions of space that have the matter for it. ... attraction is just that universal relation which unites all the parts of nature in one space. It reaches, therefore, to ... all the distance of nature's infinitude.\" Johann Heinrich Lambert, 1728-1777 (1761): \"The fixed stars obeying central forces move in orbits. The Milky Way comprehends several systems of fixed stars .... Each system has its center, and several systems taken together have a common center. Assemblages of their assemblages likewise have theirs.

Albert Einstein (l915d): Interpreted gravitation as a manifestation of geometry; gave final formulation of the law that governs the dynamic development of the geometry of space with the passage of time. Albert Einstein (1917): Idealized the universe as a 3-sphere filled with matter at effectively uniform density; the radius of this 3-sphere could not be envisaged as static without altering his standard 1915 geometrodynamic law; for this reason Einstein introduced a so-called \"cosmological term,\" which he later dropped as \"the biggest blunder\" in his life [Gamow (1970)]. Formulation by W. de Sitter in 1917 of a cosmological model in which (I) the universe is everywhere isotropic (and therefore homogeneous) and (2) the universe does not change with time, so that the mean density of mass-energy and the mean curvature of space are constant, but in which perforce (3) a cosmological term (\"repulsion\") of the Einstein type has to be added to balance the attraction of the matter. Observation by de Sitter that he could obtain another static model by removing all the matter from the original model, but that the A-term would cause test particles to accelerate away from one another. From 1917 to 1920, debate about whether spiral nebulae are mere nebulous objects (Harlow Shapley) or are \"island universes\" or galaxies similar to but external to the Milky Way (H. D. Curtis).

ALFRED NORTH WHITEHEAD (1929, p. 21) §28.1. THE \"STANDARD MODEL\" OF THE UNIVERSE Since the discovery of the cosmic microwave radiation in 1965, extensive theoretical research has produced a fairly detailed picture of how the universe probably evolved into its present state. This picture, called the \"standard hot big-bang model\" of the universe, is sketched in the present chapter, and its main features appear in Figure 28.1. Gravitation dominates the over-all expansion; but otherwise most details of the evolution are governed much less by gravitation than by the laws of thermody- namics, hydrodynamics, atomic physics, nuclear physics, and high-energy physics. This fact, and the existence of three excellent recent books on the subject [Sciama (1971); Peebles (1972); Zel'dovich and Novikov (1974)], encourage brevity here. The past evolution of the universe is qualitatively independent of the nature of the homogeneous hypersurfaces (k = -1,0, or + 1) and qualitatively independent of the cosmological constant, since the contributions of k and A to the evolution are not important in early stages of the history (small a/a o ) [see equation (27.40) and Figure 27.5]. One crucial assumption underlies the standard hot big-bang model: that the universe \"began\" in a state of rapid expansion from a very nearly homoge- neous, isotropic condition of infinite (or near infinite) density and temperature. During the first second after the beginning, according to this analysis, the temper- ature of the universe was so high that there was complete thermodynamic equilib- Evolution of universe according to \"standard hot big-bang model\": (1) initial state"},{"pageNumber":791,"pageContent":"764 28.

However, by the time the universe was a few seconds old, its temperature had dropped to about 1010 K and its density was down to ~ 10 5 g/cm 3 ; so all nucleon-antinucleon pairs had recombined, all hyperons and mesons had decayed, and all neutrinos and gravitons had decoupled from matter. The universe then consisted of freely propagating neutrinos, and perhaps gravitons, with black-body spectra at temperatures T ~ 10 10 K, plus electron-posi- tron pairs in the process of recombining, plus electrons, neutrons, protons, and photons all in thermal equilibrium at T ~ 1010 K.

THE \"STANDARD MODEL\" OF THE UNIVERSE 765 to propagate freely, maintaining black-body spectra; but their temperatures have been redshifted by the expansion of the universe in accordance with the law T ex: l/a (28.1 ) (Box 29.2). Consequently, today their temperatures should be roughly 3 K, and they should still fill the universe. Unfortunately, today's technology is far from being able to detect such a \"sea\" of neutrinos or gravitons. However, if and when they can be detected, they will provide direct observational information about the first one second of the life of the universe! As the universe continued to expand after the first few seconds, it entered a period lasting from t - 2 seconds to t - 1,000 s~conds (T - 10 10 to _10 9 K, P - 10+ 5 to 10- 1 g/cm 3 ), during which primordial element formation occurred. Before this period, there were so many high-energy protons around that they could blast apart any atomic nucleus (e.g., deuterium or tritium or He 3 or He 4 ) the moment it formed; after this period, the protons were too cold (had kinetic energies too low) to penetrate each others' coulomb barriers, and all the freely penetrating neutrons from the earlier, hotter stage had decayed into electrons plus protons. Only during the short, crucial period from t - 2 seconds to t - 1,000 seconds were conditions right for making elements. Calculations by Gamow (1948), by Alpher and Hermann (l948a, b; 1950), by Fermi and Turkevitch (1950), by Peebles (1966), and by Wagoner, Fowler, and Hoyle (1967) reveal that about 25 per cent of the baryons in the universe should have been converted into He 4 (alpha particles) during this period, and about 75 per cent should have been left as HI (protons). Traces of deuterium, He 3 , and Li should have also been created, but essentially no heavy elements. All the heavy elements observed today must have been made later, in stars [see, e.g., Fowler (1967) or Clayton (1968)]. Current astronomical studies of the abundances of the elements give some support for these predictions; but the observational data are not yet very conclusive [see, e.g., Danziger (1968) and pp. 268-275 of Peebles (1971)]. After primordial element formation, the matter and radiation continued to interact thermally through frequent ionization and recombination of atoms, keeping each other at the same temperature. Were the temperatures of radiation and matter not locked together, the radiation would cool more slowly than the matter (for adiabatic expansion, 1;. ex: l/a, but T m ex: 1/a 2 ). Thus thermal equilibrium was maintained only by a constant transfer of energy from radiation to matter. But the heat capacity of the radiation was far greater than that of the matter. Therefore the energy transfer had a negligible effect on P r , Pr' and T r . It held up the temperature of the matter (T m = T r ) without significantly lowering the temperature of the radiation. On the other hand, the total mass-energy of matter was and is dominated by rest mass. Therefore the energy transfer had negligible influence on Pm' [This circumstance justifies the approximation of ignoring energy transfer when passing from equation (27.31) to (27.32).] When the falling temperature reached a few thousand degrees (a/a o - 10- 3 , P - 10- 20 g/cm 3 , t - 10 5 years), two things of interest happened: the universe ceased to be radiation-dominated and became matter-dominated [Pm = p mo (a o /a)3 came to exceed P r = P ro (a o /a)4]; and the photons ceased to be energetic enough to keep (4) primordial element formation (2 sec. ~ t ~ 1,000 sec.)

(8) condensation of stars. galaxies and clusters (10 8 yrs. ~ t ~ 10 9 yrs.) EXERCISE hydrogen atoms ionized, so the electrons and protons quickly recombined. That these two events were roughly coincident is a result of the specific, nearly conserved value that the entropy per baryon has in our universe: b (number of photons in universe) 10 8 s = entropy per aryon ~ ~ - (number of baryons in universe) . Why the universe began with this value of s, rather than some other value (e.g. unity), nobody has been able to explain. Recombination of the plasma at t ~ 10 5 years was crucial, because it brought an end to the interaction and thermal equilibrium between radiation and matter (\"de- coupling\"). Thereafter, with very few free electrons off which to scatter, and with Rayleigh scattering off atoms and molecules unimportant, the photons propagated almost freely through space. Unless energy-releasing processes reionized the inter- galactic medium sometime between a/a o ~ 10- 3 and a/a o ~ 0.1, the photons have been propagating freely ever since the plasma recombined. Even if reionization occurred, the photons have been propagating freely at least since a/a o ~ 0.1. The expansion of the universe has redshifted the temperature of the freely propa- gating photons in accordance with the equation T ex: l/a (see Box 29.2). As a consequence, today they have a black-body spectrum with a temperature of 2.7 K. They are identified with the cosmic microwave radiation that was discovered in 1965, and they give one direct information about the nature of the universe at the time they last interacted with matter (a/a o ~ 10- 3 , t ~ 10 5 years if reionization did not occur; a/ a o ~ 0.1, t ~ 5 X 10 8 years if reionization did occur.) Return to the history of matter. Before plasma recombination, the photon pressure (\"elasticity of the cosmological fluid\") prevented the uniform matter (25 per cent He 4 , 75 per cent H) from condensing into stars, galaxies, or clusters of galaxies. However, after recombination, the photon pressure was gone, and condensation could begin. Small perturbations in the matter density, perhaps dating back to the begin- ning of expansion, then began to grow larger and larger. Somewhere between a/a o ~ 1/30 and a/a o ~ 1/10 (10 8 years :s t :s 10 9 years) these perturbations began developing into stars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. Slightly later, at a/ a o ~ 1/4, quasars probably \"turned on,\" emitting light which astronomers now receive at Earth (see Box 28.1). Exercise 28.1. UNCERTAINTY IN EVOLUTION Current observations, plus the assumption of complete homogeneity and isotropy at the beginning of expansion, plus the assumption that the excess of leptons over antileptons is less than or of the order of the excess of baryons over antibaryons, place the following limits on the cosmological parameters today: Matter density today == P mo ' between 10- 28 and 2 X 10- 31 g/cm 3 ; k == 0 or + I or - I; temperature of electromagnetic radiation today == 2.7 ± 0.1 K.

(On the use of redshift to characterize time since the big bang, see Box 29.3.) In greater detail, Schmidt (1972) gives the following analysis of the data:* 1. Schmidt assumes from the outset that quasar redshifts are cosmological in origin [redshift = (Hubble constant) X (distance); §29.2]. The evidence for this is a. Observational: Some quasars are located in clusters of galaxies [as evidenced both by position on sky and by quasar having same redshift as galaxies in cluster; see Gunn (1971 )]. Since the evidence for the cosmological distance- redshift relation for galaxies is overwhelming (Boxes 29.4 and 29.5), the redshifts of these particular quasars must be cosmological. b. Theoretical: Observed quasar redshifts of z ~ 1 to 3 cannot be gravitational in origin; objects with gravitational redshifts larger than z ::::::: 0.5 are unstable against collapse (see Chapters 24 and 26 and Box 25.9). Nor are the quasar redshifts likely to be Doppler; how could so massive an object be accelerated to v::::::: 1 without complete disruption? The only remaining possibility is a cosmological redshift. For this reason, opponents of the cosmological hypothe- sis usually feel pressed to invoke in the quasars a breakdown of the laws of physics as one~understands them today. [See, e.g., Arp (1971) and references cited therein. These references also describe evidence against the cosmological assumption, evidence that a few prominent investigators find compelling, but that most do not as of 1972.] 2. Schmidt then asks how many quasars, N, there were in the universe at a time corresponding to the redshift z, and with absolute luminosity per unit frequency, L.(2,500 A) at the wavelength 2500 A as measured in the quasar's local Lorentz frame. 3. The data on quasars available in 1972 are not at all sufficient to determine N[z, L.(2,500 A)] uniquely. But they are sufficient to show unequivocally that: a. There must have been evolution; N(z, L.) cannot be independent of z. b. The evolution cannot have resided primarily in the luminosities: the total number of quasars, Ntoi z ) L N(z, Lv) L,(2,500A) must have changed markedly with time (with z). • Our version of Schmidt's (1972) argument is oversimplified.

Schmidt, Sandage, and others have independently searched for selection effects that might produce an artificial apparent decrease in the number of quasars at z > 2.5. None have been found. In the words of Sandage (l972d) \"The apparent cutoff in quasar redshifts near z = 2.8 [has been] examined for selection effects that could produce it artificially. If the cutoff is real, it may be the time of the birth of the first quasars, although the suggested redshift is unexpectedly small.

STANDARD MODEL MODIFIED FOR PRIMORDIAL CHAOS The standard hot big-bang model is remarkably powerful and accords well with observations (primordial helium abundances; existence, temperature, and isotropy of cosmic microwave radiation; homogeneity and isotropy of universe in the large; close accord between age of universe as measured by expansion and ages of oldest stars; ... ). However, in 1972 it encounters apparent difficulty with one item: the origin of galaxies. In a universe that is initially homogeneous and isotropic it is not clear that random fluctuations will give rise (after plasma recombination) to pertur- bations in the density of matter of sufficient amplitude to condense into galaxies. The perturbations that eventually form galaxies might have to reside in the initial, exploding state of the universe. [See Zel'dovich and Novikov (1974) for detailed review and discussion; see also references cited in §30.1.] Is it reasonable to assume a small amount of initial inhomogeneity? Is it not much more reasonable to assume either perfect homogeneity (one extreme) or perfect chaos (the other extreme)? Thus, if perfect initiarliomogeneity turns out to be incompatible with the origin of galaxies, it is attractive to try \"perfect initial chaos\" -Le., completely random initial conditions, with a full spectrum of fluctuations in density, entropy; and local expansion rate [Misner (1968, 1969b)]. It is conceivable, but far from proved, that during its subsequent evolution such a model universe will quickly smooth itself out by natural processes (Chapter 30) such as \"Mixmaster oscillations,\" neutrino- induced viscosity [see, e.g;, Matzner and Misner (1971)], and gravitational curva- ture-induced creation of particle pairs [Zel'dovich (1972)]. Will one be left, after a few seconds or less, with a nearly homogeneous and isotropic, Friedmann uniyerse, containingjust enough remaining perturbations to condense eventually into galaxies? Theoretical calculations have not yet been carried far enough to give a clear answer. Of course, after the initial chaos subsides, if it subsides, such a model universe will evolve in accord with the standard big-bang model of the last section. §28.3.

EVOLUTION OF THE UNIVERSE INTO ITS PRESENT STATE The initial singularity and quantum gravitational effects Cosmologies that violate general relativity General relativity predicts, inexorably, that even if the \"initial state\" was chaotic rather than smooth, it must have involved a spacetime \"singularity\" of some sort [see Hawking and Ellis (1968); also §34.6 of this book]. And general relativity is incapable of projecting backward through the singularity to say what \"preceded\" it. Perhaps only by coming to grip with quantum gravitational effects (marriage of quantum theory with classical geometrodynamics) will one ever reach a clear under- standing of the initial state and of what, if anything, \"preceded\" it [see Misner (1969c), Wheeler (197Ic)]. For further discussion of these deep issues, see §§34.6, 43.4, the final section of Box 30.1, and Chapter 44. §28.4. OTHER COSMOLOGICAL THEORIES This book confines attention to the cosmology of general relativity. If one were to abandon general relativity, one would have a much wider set of possibilities, includ- ing (1) the steady-state theory [Hoyle (1948); Bondi and Gold (1948)], which has not succeeded in accounting for the cosmic microwave radiation or in explaining observed evolutionary effects in radio sources and quasars [Box 28.1]; (2) the Klein- Alfven \"hierarchic cosmology\" of matter in an asymptotically flat spacetime [Alfven and Klein (1962), Alfven (1971), Klein (1971), Moritz (1969), de Vaucouleurs (1971)], which disagrees with cosmic-ray and gamma-ray observations [Steigman (1971 )]; and the Brans-Dicke cosmologies [Dicke (1968), Greenstein (1968a,b), Morganstern (1973)], which are qualitatively the same and quantitatively almost the same as the standard hot big-bang model. However, no motivation or justification is evident for abandoning general relativity. The experimental basis of general relativity has been strengthened substantially in the past decade (Chapters 38-40); and the standard big-bang model of the universe predicted by general relativity accords remarkably well with observations-far better than any other model ever proposed!"},{"pageNumber":798,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 PRESENT STATE AND FUTURE EVOLUTION OF THE UNIVERSE Expansion forever vs. recontraction of universe Einstein's field equations.

Thus, the 21-cm line of hydrogen, with 400,000 times the wavelength of the central region of the visible, undergoes a redshift that agrees (within the errors of the measurements) with the redshifts of lines in the visible for recession velocities of the order of v - 0.005, according to observation of thirty objects by Dieter, Epstein, Lilley, and Roberts (1962) and further observations by Roberts (1965). No one has ever put forward a satisfactory explanation for the cosmological redshift other than the expansion of the universe (see below). The idea has been proposed at various times by various authors that some new process is at work (\"tired light\") in which photons interact with atoms or electrons on their way from source to receptor, and thereby lose bits and pieces of their energy. Va. B. Zel'dovich (1963) gives a penetrating analysis of the difficulties with any such ideas: (I) \"If the energy loss is caused by an interaction with the intergalactic matter, it is accompanied by a transfer of momentum; that is, there is a change of the direction of motion of the photon. There would then be a smearing out of images; a distant star would be seen as a disc, not a point, and that is not what is observed.\" (2) \"Let us suppose that the photon decays, y -- y' + k, giving up a small part of its energy to some particle, k. It follows from the conservation laws that k must move in the direction of the photon (this, by the way, avoids a smearing out), and must have zero rest mass. Because of the statistical nature of the process, however, some photons would lose more energy than others, and there would be a spectral broadening of the lines, which is also not observed.\" (3) If there does exist any such decay process, then simple arguments of special relativity that Zel'dovich attributes to M. P. Bronshtein, and spells out in detail, demand the relationship ( probability per) (a uni:ersal. constant With) second of = _t_h_e_d_I_m_e_n_s_1O_n_s_s_e_c_-_ 2 _ \"photon decay\" (frequency of photon in sec-I) \"Thus,\" Zel'dovich concludes, \"if the decay of photons is possible at all, those in radio waves must decay especially rapidly! This would mean that the Maxwell equation for a static electric field would have to be changed .... There is no experimental indication of such effects: the radio-frequency radiation from distant sources is transmitted to us not a bit more poorly than visible light, and the red shift measured in different parts of the spectrum is exactly the same ....

The atom excites an n-node standing wave in the universe. The number n stays constant during the expansion. Therefore wavelengths increase in the same proportion as the dimensions of the universe. One sees immediately in this way that the redshift is independent of all such details as (I) why the expansion came about (spherical symmetry, but arbitrary equation of state); (2) the rate-uniform or nonuni- form-at which it came about; and (3) the distance between source and receptor at emission, at reception, or at any time in-between. The reasoning in the diagram appears to depend on the closure of the universe (standing waves; k = + I rather than 0 or -I). That closure is not required for this simple result is seen from the further analysis given in the text. Not the least among the considerations that lead one to accept the general recession of the galaxies as the explanation for the redshift is the circumstance that this general recession was predicted [Friedmann (1922)] before the redshift was observed [Hubble (1929)]. The cosmological redshift is easily understood (Figure 29.1) in terms of the standard big-bang model for the universe. A detailed analysis focuses attention on three processes: emission of the light, propagation of the light through curved spacetime from emitter to receiver, and reception of the light. Emission and reception I occur in the proper reference frames (orthonormal tetrads) of the emitter and receiver; they are special-relativistic phenomena. Propagation, by contrast, is a general-relativistic process; it is governed by the law of geodesic motion in curved spacetime.

(29.5) (One who wishes to forego any appeal to symmetry can examine the geodesic equation in the (t, X, B, cp) coordinate system, and discover that if dB/d\"A = dcp/d\"A = 0, then d 2 B/d\"A 2 = d 2 cp/d\"A 2 = O. Consequently a geodesic that is initially radial will always remain radial.) Consider, now, emission. A galaxy at rest (moving with the \"cosmological fluid\") at (X e , Be' CPe) emits two successive crests, A and B, of a wave train toward Earth at coordinate times t Ae and tBe. It has been arranged that proper time as measured on the galaxy is the same as coordinate time (t = 'T + const. was part of the con- struction process for the coordinate system in §27.4). Consequently the period of the radiation as seen by the emitter is P em = teB - teA; and the wavelength is the same as the period when geometrized units are used: (29.6) Next examine propagation. Wave crests A and B propagate along null geodesics. This fact enables one to read the world lines of the wave crests, XA (t) and XB(t), directly from the line element (29.4): ds 2 = 0 guarantees that aCt) dX = -dt (-, not +, because the light propagates toward the Earth at X = 0).

(2) [equation (29.10)], consider the radiation emerging from the hoLbi-& bang. Because it is initially in thermal equilibriumWfth matter, this primordial radiation initially has a Planck black-body spec- trum. Subsequent interactions with matter cannot change the spectrum, because the matter remains in thermal equilibrium with the radiation so long as interactions are occurring. The cosmological redshift can and does change the spectrum, how- ever. It was shown in exercise 22.17, using kinetic theory, that radiation with a Planck spectrum as viewed by one observer has a Planck spectrum as viewed by all observers; but the observed temper- ature is redshifted in precisely the same manner as the frequency of an individual photon is red- shifted. Consequently, as seen by observers at rest This is true after plasma recombination, when the radiation and matter are decoupled, as well as before recombination, when they are interacting. And it is true not only for the primordial photons but also for thermalized neutrinos and gravitons emerging from the hot big bang. There is another way to derive the redshift equation (2).

Box 29.3 USE OFREDSHIFT TO CHARACTERIZE DISTANCES AND TIME Distance: When discussing objects within the Earth's cluster of galaxies, astronomers typically describe distances in units of lightyears or parsecs. But when dealing with more distant objects (gal- axies, quasars, etc.), astronomers find it more con- venient to describe distance in terms of what is actually observed: redshift. For example, the statement \"the galaxy 3C 295 is at a redshift of 0.4614\" means that \"3C 295 is at that distance from Earth [given by equation (29.16)] which cor- responds to a redshift of z = 0.4614.\" Time: When discussing events that occurred dur- ing the last few 10 9 years, astronomers usually measure time in units of years. Example: \"The solar system condensed out of interstellar gas 4.6 X 10 9 years ago\" [see Wasserburg and Burnett (1968)]. But when dealing with events much nearer the beginning of the universe, all of which have essentially the same age, of about 12 X 10 9 years, astronomers find it more convenient to describe time in terms of redshift. Example: \"The primor- dial plasma recombined at a redshift of 1,000\" means that \"If a photon had been emitted at the time of plasma recombination, and had propa- gated freely ever since, it would have experienced a total redshift between then and now of z = 1,000.\" Equivalently, since 1 + z = (ao/a) [see equation (29.11 )], \"the plasma recombined when the universe was a factor of 1 + z ;:::; 1,000 smaller than it is today.\" [Application: In Figure 28.1, where the past evolution of the universe is sum- marized, one can freely replace the horizontal scale a/a o by 1/(1 + z), and thereby see that pri- mordial element formation occurred at a redshift of z ;:::; 10 9 .)

That distance (\"present distance\") is defined on the hypersurface of homogeneity that passes through Earth today, since that hypersurface agrees locally with the surface of simultaneity of the receiver today, and it is also, locally, a surface of simultaneity for any observer moving today with the \"cosmological fluid.\" The distance between emitter and observer today [the distance along the spatial geodesic of constant (t, (), cf» connecting (t.., 0, () e' cf>e) and (t.., X e , () e' cf>e)] can be read directly from the line element (29.4): (29.12) Using expression (29.9) for X e , one finds (29.12')"},{"pageNumber":808,"pageContent":"§29.3.

But it is very difficult to obtain reliable measurements of the distances .£ to galaxies that are so far away! C. Procedure by which H o has been measured [Sandage and Tamman, as summar- ized in Sandage (l972a)1: 1. Cepheid variables are pulsating stars with pulsation periods (as measured by oscillations in light output) that are very closely correlated with their luminosities L-or, equivalently, with their absolute (bolometric) magni- tudes, M: M= (apparent magnitude star would have were it at a) - distance of 10 parsecs = 32.6 light years (1) = -2.5 10glO (L/3.0 X 10 35 erg sec-I) [see equation (29.20).] By measurements within our Galaxy, astronomers have obtained the \"period-luminosity relation\" for cepheid variables. 2. Cepheid variables are clearly visible in galaxies as far away as -4 Mpc (4 Megaparsecs 4 X 10 6 parsecs). In each such galaxy one measures the periods of the cepheids; one then infers their absolute magnitudes M from the period-luminosity relation; one measures their apparent magnitudes m; and one then calculates their distances .£ from Earth using the relation m - M = 5 10glO (1/10 pc). (2) By this means one obtains the distances .£ to all galaxies within -4 Mpc of our own. Unfortunately, such galaxies are too close to participate cleanly in the universal expansion. (They include only the \"local group,\" the \"M81 group,\" and the \"south polar group.\") Thus, one must push the distance scale out still farther before attempting to measure H o ' 3. Galaxies of types Sc, Sd, Sm, and Ir within -4 Mpc contain huge clouds of ionized hydrogen, which shine brightly in \"Ha light.\" These clouds, called \"H II regions,\" exhibit a very tight correlation between diameter D of the H II region and luminosity L of the galaxy (or, equivalently, between D and absolute magnitude of galaxy, M). In fact, for a given galaxy luminosity L, the fractional spread in H II diameters is a(,1D/D) ~ 0.12. Using (a) the distances (~4 Mpc) to these galaxies as determined via cepheid variables, (b) the apparent magnitudes of the galaxies, and (c) the angular diameters of H II regions in the galaxies, one calculates"},{"pageNumber":814,"pageContent":"§29.4.

Unfortunately, this is still not far enough away for local motions to be negligible compared with the universal expansion. 5. Within -60 Mpc reside enough galaxies of type Sc I for one to discover that their luminosities (absolute magnitudes) are rather constant (difference in L from one Sc I galaxy to another :s 50 per cent). Using the distances to such Sc I galaxies, as measured via H II regions, and using measurements of their apparent magnitudes, one calculates their universal absolute magnitude (measured photographically) to be M pg = -21.2.

Correction for this effect would lower the most probable value of qo from 1 to 0 [Sandage (1972c)]. 2.

After a year of practice he became fed up and, in his own words, \"chucked the law for astronomy, and I knew that even if I were second-rate or third-rate it was astronomy that mattered.\" He chose the University of Chi- cago and Yerkes Observatory as the site for his astronomy education, and three years later (1917) completed a Ph.D. thesis on \"Photographic Inves- tigations of Faint Nebulae.\" When Hubble entered astronomy, it was sus- pected that some nebulae lie outside the Galaxy, but the evidence was exceedingly weak. During the subsequent two decades, Hubble, more than anyone else, was responsible for opening to man's purview the extragalactic universe. Working with the 60-inch and IOO-inch telescopes at Mount Wil- son, Hubble developed irrefutable evidence of the extragalactic nature of spiral nebulae, elliptical nebulae, and irregular nebulae (now called gal- axies). He devised the classification scheme for galaxies which is still in use today. He systematized the entire subject of extragalactic research: deter- mining distance scales, luminosities, star densities, and the peculiar motion of our Galaxy; and ob- taining extensive evidence that the laws of physics outside the Galaxy are die same as near Earth (in Hubble's words: \"verifying the principle of the uniformity of nature\"). He discovered and quan- tified the large-scale homogeneity of the universe. And-his greatest triumph of all!-he discovered the expansion of the universe. The details of Hubble's pioneering work are best sketched in his own words: \"Extremely little is known of the nature of nebulae; and no classification has yet been suggested . ... The agreement [between the velocity of escape from a spiral nebula and that from our galaxy] is such as to lend some color to the hypothesis that the spirals are stellar systems at distances to be measured often in millions of light years. \" (1920; Ph.D. THESIS; PUBLICATION DELAYED 3 YEARS BY WORLD WAR I) This box is based largely on the biography of Hubble by Mayall (1970)."},{"pageNumber":820,"pageContent":"§29.4.

The curving of light rays has little effect on the apparent size of nearby objects. However, distant galaxies- galaxies from a quarter of the way up to halfway around the universe-are expected to have greatly magnified angular diameters [Klauder, Wakano, Wheeler, and Willey (1959)]. To see a normal galaxy at such a distance by means of an optical telescope seems out of the question. However, radio telescopes resolve features in quasistellar sources and other radiogalaxies at redshifts of z = 2 or more. Moreover, paired radio telescopes at intercontinental distances (for example, Goldstone, California, and Woomera, Australia) resolve distant sources to better than 0\".001 or 4.8 X 10- 9 radians or 15 lightyears for an object at a distance of 3 X 10 9 lightyears (Euclidean geometry temporarily being assumed). A radio telescope in space· paired with a radio telescope on earth will be able to do even better on angular resolution. Will one be able to find any fiducial distance characteristic of anyone class of objects that will serve as a natural standard of length, for very great distances (z = 2 to z = 3) as well as for galaxies closer at hand? Perhaps not. However, it would seem unwise to discount this possibility, with all the advantages it would bring, in view of the demonstrated ability of skilled observers to find regularities elsewhere where one had no right to expect them in advance. Let L denote the actual length of a fiducial element (if any be found) in a galaxy; and let S() (radians!) denote the apparent length of the object, idealized as perpendi- cular to the line of sight, as seen by the observer. The ratio of these two quantities defines the \"angle effective distance\" of the source, The hope for a fiducial length in distant objects Angle effective distance defined (angle effective distance) = r aed = LIS(). (29.38a) In flat space and for objects with zero relative velocity, this distance is to be identified with the actual distance, r, to the source or with the actual time of flight, t, of light from source to observer. The situation is changed in an expanding universe. To calculate the angle effective distance as a function of redshift, place the Earth (receiver) at X r = 0; and place the object under study (emitter) at X e • Let the fiducial length L lie on the sphere at X e (perpendicular to line of sight), and let it run from () e to () e + S() [one end of fiducial element at (X e , () e' cfJ e ); other at (Xe, () e + 88, cfJ e )].

It is evident that the angle effective distance has a maximum for a redshift roughly of the order z -- I, provided that the universe is closed. However, there is a big difference if the universe is open (Figure 29.2). The rapid improvements taking place in radio astronomy make increasingly attractive the possibility it provides for testing whether the universe is closed, as Einstein argued it should be [Einstein (1950), pp. 107-108]. Moreover, even with optical telescopes, in 1973 one may be on the verge of measuring qo by studies of angle effective distance: preliminary studies [Sandage (1972b)] suggest that the optical size of the brightest E-type galaxies may be a usable fiducial length. §29.6. DENSITY OF THE UNIVERSE TODAY It is exceedingly difficult to measure the mean density P mo of the universe today. A large amount of matter may be in forms that astronomers have not yet managed to observe (intergalactic matter, black holes, etc.). Therefore, the best one can do is to add up all the luminous matter in galaxies and regard the resulting number as a lower limit on P mo ' Even adding up the luminous matter is a difficult and risky task, so difficult that even today no analysis is more definitive than the classic work of Oort (1958).

If it is gravitationally bound, then the mean velocity of its galaxies relative to each other, when combined with the virial theorem, yields an estimate of the cluster's total mass. That estimate is 25 times larger than the value one gets by Oort's method of adding up the luminous mass of the cluster.

But these limits, like others obtained in other ways [see Chapter 4 of Peebles (1971) for a review] are far from definitive; they depend too much on theoretical calculations to make one feel fully comfortable. §29.7.

Motivation for studying inhomogeneous and anisotropic cosmologies: Why is universe so uniform? The last three chapters studied the Friedmann cosmological models and the relatively satisfactory picture they give of the universe and its evolution. This chapter describes less simplified cosmological models, and uses them to begin answering the question, \"Why are the very simple Friedmann models satisfactory?\" This question is intended to probe more deeply than the first, obvious answer-namely, that the models are satisfactory because they do not contradict observations. Accepting the agreement with observations, we want to understand why the laws of physics should demand (rather than merely permit) a universe that is homogeneous and isotropic to high accuracy on large scales. Because this question cannot be answered definitively in 1972, many readers will prefer to omit this chapter on the first reading and return to it only after they have surveyed the major results in other areas such as black holes (Chapter 33), gravitational waves (Chapters 35-37), and solar-system experi- ments (Chapter 40). The approach described here to the question \"Why is the universe so highly symmetric?\" is to ask Einstein's equations to describe what would have happened if the universe had started out highly irregular. The first step in this approach is to ask what would have happened if the universe had started a little bit irregular. This problem can be tackled by analyzing small perturbations away from the high symmetry of the Friedmann models. Such an analysis is most fruitful in its discussion of the beginnings of galaxy formation, and"},{"pageNumber":828,"pageContent":"in its ability to relate small upper limits on the present-day anisotropy bf the microwave background radiation to limits on density and temperature irregularities that might have existed ten billion years ago, when the radiation was emitted. These studies are described so well in the book by Zel'dovich and Novikov (1974) [see also Field (1973), Peebles (1969), Peebles and Yu (1970), Jones and Peebles (1972), and references cited therein] that we omit them here. . Another approach is to allow large deviations from the symmetry of the Friedmann universes, but to put the asymmetries into only a few degrees of freedom. §30.2. KASNER MODEL FOR AN ANISOTROPIC UNIVERSE 801 §30.2. THE KASNER MODEL FOR AN ANISOTROPIC UNIVERSE The prototype for cosmological models with great asymmetry in a few degrees of freedom is the Kasner (192Ia) metric, Kasner metric: an example of an anisotropic model universe (30.1 ) which was first studied as a cosmological model by Schiicking and Heckmann (1958). In this metric the Pi are constants satisfying (30.2) Each t = constant hypersurface of this cosmological model is a flat three-dimensional space. The world lines of constant x, y, z are timelike geodesics along which galaxies or other matter, treated as test particles, can be imagined to move. This model represents an expanding universe, since the volume element v=g=pg=t is constantly increasing. But it is an anisotropically expanding universe. The separa- tion between two standard (constant x,y, z) observers is t PI Ax if only their x-coor- dinates differ. Thus, distances parallel to the x-axis expand at one rate, 1. 1 ex: t P1 , while those along the y-axis can expand at a different rate, 1. 2 ex: t P2 • Most remarkable perhaps is the fact that along one of the axes distances contract rather than expand. This contraction shows up mathematically in the fact that equations (30.2) require one of the p's, say PI' to be nonpositive: I -\"3 SP1 SO. (30.3) As a consequence, in a universe of this sort, if black-body radiation were emitted at one time t and never subsequently scattered, later observers would see blue shifts near one pair of antIpodes on the sky and red shifts in most other directions. In terms of this example, the fundamental cosmological question is why the Friedmann metrics should be a more accurate approximation to the real universe than is this Kasner metric."},{"pageNumber":829,"pageContent":"Kasner model with matter becomes isotropic in \"old age\" Anisotropy energy 802 30. ANISOTROPIC AND INHOMOGENEOUS COSMOLOGIES §30.3. ADIABATIC COOLING OF ANISOTROPY In seeking an answer, ask a question. Ask, in particular, what would become of a universe that starts out near t = 0 with a form described by the Kasner metric oL equation (30.1). This metric is an exact solution of the vacuum Einstein equation G = O. It approximates a situation where the matter terms in the Einstein equations are negligible by comparison with typical non-zero components of the Riemann tensor. Schiicking and Heckmann (1958) give solutions with matter included as a pressureless fluid. In this situation, the curvature of empty spacetime dominates both the geometry and the expansion rate at early times, t -+ 0; but after some characteristic time t m the matter terms become more important, and the metric reduces asymptotically to the homogeneous, isotropic model with k = O. This example illustrates the possibility that the universe might achieve a measure of isotropy and homogeneity in old age, even if it were born in a highly irregular state. Whether the symmetry of our universe can be explained along these lines is not yet clear in 1972. The model universe just mentioned is only a hint, especially since the critical parameter t m can be given any value whatsoever. The standard Einstein general-relativity physics of this model can be described in other language (Misner, 1968) by ascribing to the anisotropic motions of empty spacetime an \"effective energy density\" Paniso' which enters the Goo component of the Einstein equation on an equal footing with the matter-energy density, and thereby helps to account for the expansion of the universe: (30.4) Adiabatic cooling of anisotropy The anisotropy energy density is found to have an equation of state while P ex: (3)g-Y/2 - (volume)-Y matter - . For pressureless matter y = 1; for a radiation fluid y = 4/3; for a nonrelativistic ideal gas y = 5/3). This arrangement of the Einstein equation allows one to think of the anisotropy motions as being adiabatically cooled by the expansion of the universe, just as the thermal motions of an ideal gas would be. Since the adiabatic index for homogeneous anisotropy is y = 2, the anisotropy will be the dominant source of \"effective energy\" in a highly compressed state, whereas the matter will dominate in an expanded state. §30.4. VISCOUS DISSIPATION OF ANISTROPY The model universe sketched above can be further elaborated by introducing dissi- pative mechanisms that convert anisotropy energy into thermal energy. Suppose that"},{"pageNumber":830,"pageContent":"such an anisotropic universe were filled at one time with thermal radiation. If the radiation were collisionless or nearly so, the quanta moving parallel to the contracting x-axis would get blueshifted and would develop an energy distribution corresponding to a high temperature. The quanta moving parallel to the other (expanding) axes would be redshifted to an energy distribution corresponding to a low temperature. Any collisions taking place between these two systems of particles would introduce a \"thermal contact\" between them, and would transfer energy from the hot system to the cold one, with a corresponding large production of entropy. This provides an irreversible dissipative process, which decreases Paniso and increases Pradiation relative to the values they would have had under conditions of adiabatic expansion. [For further details, see, e.g., Matzner and Misner (1972).] It is possible that both the adiabatic cooling of anisotropy and the dissipation of anisotropy by its action on a gas of almost collisionless quanta have played significant roles in the evolution of our universe. In particular, neutrinos above 10 10 K may have undergone sufficient p-e scattering to have provided strong dissipation during the first few seconds of the life of the universe. §30.5. PARTICLE CREATION IN AN ANISOTROPIC UNIVERSE 803 §30.5. PARTICLE CREATION IN AN ANISOTROPIC UNIVERSE Adiabatic cooling and viscous dissipation might not be the chief destroyers of anisotropy in an expanding universe. More powerful still might be another highly dissipative process, which might occur at still earlier times, very near the initial \"singularity.\" This is a process of particle creation which was first treated by DeWitt Creation of particles by (1953), then explored by-Parker (1966 and 1969) for isotropic cosmologies and finally anisotropy of expansion by Zel'dovich (1970) in the present context of anisotropic cosmologies. In this process one again turns to the Kasner metric for the simplest example, but now quantum- mechanical considerations enter the picture. One realizes that not only would real quanta propagating in different directions be subject to red shifts and blue shifts, but that virtual quanta must be considered as well. Vacuum fluctuations (zero-point oscillations) entail a certain minimum number of virtual quanta, which are subject to the redshifting and blue shifting action of the strong gravitational fields. Virtual quanta that are blue shifted sufficiently violently can materialize as real particles, thanks to their energy gain. In this context \"sufficiently violently\" means not adia- batically. In an adiabatic expansion, the number of particles does not change, although the energy of each one does. This adiabatic limit is just the geometric-optics approxima- tion to wave equations, which was discussed in §22.5. There one saw that, if spacetime were not flat on the scale of a wavelength, then the wave equation could not be replaced by a particle description with conserved particle numbers. Thus, the adia- batic limit (geometric-optics approximation) is violated in the conditions of high curvature near the singularity at the beginning of the universe. By studying wave equations in the Kasner background metric, Zel'dovich and Starobinsky (1971) find quantitatively the consequences of the failure of the adia-"},{"pageNumber":831,"pageContent":"batic approximation near the singularity. Classically, the amplitudes of waves at frequencies comparable to the Hubble constant for any given epoch increase faster than a simple blue-shift calculation would imply (amplification through parametric resonance). Quantum-mechanically, the same amplification, applied to zero-point oscillations, leads to the creation of particle-antiparticle pairs. The calculations indi- cate that this effect is very strong at the characteristic time t q = V Gfi/ c 5 ~ 10- 43 sec. (All calculations performed thus far are inadequate when the effect becomes strong, thus for t ~ t q ). For the creation of massless particles, it is essential that an anisotropically ex- panding universe be postulated (except for scalar particles, for which particle creation occurs already in the Friedmann universe, unless the particle satisfies the conformal- invariant wave equation). The isotropic Friedmann universes are all conform ally flat, so that solutions of the wave equation for a field of zero rest mass can be given in terms of solutions for flat-space wave equations where there is no particle creation. There is some particle creation even in the isotropic Friedmann universe when the particle has finite rest mass and low energy. However, the particle-creation process normally uses anisotropy energy as the energy supply that it converts into radiation energy. The pioneering work by Parker and Zel'dovich suggests that one should study in detail cosmological models in which the initial conditions are a singularity, and in which quantum effects near the time t = t q dissipate all anisotropies and simulta- neously give rise to the matter content of the model. This program of research, which is in its infancy, seems to require extrapolating laws of physics down to the very natural looking but preposterously small dimension VGfi/c 5 ~ 10- 43 sec, or equiv- alently VGfi/c 3 - 10- 33 cm, Anisotropy might have created the matter content of our universe, damping itself out in the process 804 30. ANISOTROPIC AND INHOMOGENEOUS COSMOLOGIES Inhomogeneous cosmological models: (1) with spherical symmetry (2) with (rather symmetric) gravitational waves (3) near a singularity, with few or no symmetries §30.6. INHOMOGENEOUS COSMOLOGIES The model universes considered above were all homogeneous although anisotropic. It is also crucial to study inhomogeneous cosmological models, in which the metric has a nontrivial dependence on the space coordinates. One class of such models is spherically symmetric universes, where the matter density, expansion rate, and all other locally measurable physical quantities have spherical symmetry about some preferred origin. Models of this sort were first considered by Lemaitre (1933a,b), Tolman (1934b), and Datt (1938), and were also treated by Bondi in 1947. These models provide a means for studying density perturbations of large amplitude. A recent tool is making it possible to study large-amplitude, spatially varying curvature perturbations of other symmetries; this tool is the Gowdy (1971, 1973) metrics. These metrics, which are exact solutions of the Einstein equations, represent closed universes with various topologies (5 3 ,5 1 X 52, T3) containing gravitational waves. The wave form in these solutions is essentially arbitrary, but all the waves propagate along a single preferred direction and have a common polarization. A rather different approach to understanding the behavior of inhomogeneous and anisotropic solutions of the Einstein equations has been developed by Khalatnikov,"},{"pageNumber":832,"pageContent":"Lifshitz, and their colleagues. Rather than truncate the Einstein theory by limiting attention to specialized situations where exact solutions can be obtained, they have sought to study the widest possible class of solutions, but to describe their behavior only in the immediate neighborhood of the singularity. These studies give a greatly enhanced significance to some of the exact solutions, by showing that phenomena found in them are in fact typical of much broader classes of solutions. Thus, in the first large class of solutions studied [Lifshitz and Khalatnikov (1963)], it was found that near the singularity solutions containing matter showed no features not already found in the vacuum solutions. Furthermore, space derivatives in the Einstein equations became negligible near the singularity in these solutions, with the consequence that a metric of the Kasner form [equation (30.1)] described the local behavior of spacetime near the singularity, but with a different set of Pi values possible at each point of the singular hypersurface. Subsequently, broadened studies of solutions near a singularity [Belinsky and Khalatnikov (1970)] showed that the mix master universe [Misner (1969b); Belinsky, Khalatnikov, and Lifshitz (1970)] is a still better homogeneous prototype for singularity behavior than the Kasner metric. §30.7. THE MIXMASTER UNIVERSE 805 §30.7. THE MIXMASTER UNIVERSE The simplest example of a mixmaster universe is described in Box 30.1. It shows how, near the singularity, the Kasner exponents Pi can become functions of time. The result is most simply described in terms of the Khalatnikov-Lifshitz param- eter u: PI = -u/(l + u + u 2 ), ----P2 = (1 + u)/(1 + u + u 2 ), P3 = u(1 + u)/(l + u + u 2 ). (30.5) Mixmaster universe: (1) \"anisotropy oscillations\" explained in terms of Kasner model. As one extrapolates backward in time toward the singularity, one finds that the expansion rates in the three principal directions correspond to those of the Kasner metric of equation (30.1), with Pi values corresponding to some fixed u parameter. In these mixmaster models, however, the metric is not independent of the space coordinates (the spacelike hypersurfaces can, for instance, have the same 3-sphere topology as the closed Friedmann universes). The Kasner-like behavior at fixed u can persist through many decades of volume expansion before effects of the spatial derivatives of the metric come into play. The role then played by the space curvature is brief and decisive. The expansion is converted from a type corresponding to a parameter value u = U o to a type corre- sponding to the value u = - U o (which is equivalent, under a relabeling of the axes, to the value u = U o - 1). Extrapolating still farther back toward the singularity, one finds a previous period with u = U o - 2. Throughout an entire sequence u = u o , U o - 1, U o - 2, Uo - 3, ... , with U o ~ 1, nearly the entire volume expansion is due to expansion in the 3-direction, whereas the 1- and 2-directions change very little, alternating at each step between expansion and contraction. Sufficiently far in the past, however, such a sequence leads to a value of u between 0 and 1. This value"},{"pageNumber":833,"pageContent":"can be interpreted as the starting point for another, similar sequence, through the transformation u -+ l/u, which interchanges the names of axes 2 and 3. The extrapolation of the universe's evolution back toward the singularity at t = 0 therefore shows an extraordinarily complex behavior, in which similar but not precisely identical sequences of behavior are repeated infinitely many times. In terms of a time variable which is approximately log (log I-i), these behaviors are quasi- periodic. In the generic example to which the Khalatnikov-Lifshitz methods lead, one has a metric whose asymptotic behavior near the singularity is at each point of the singular hypersurface described by a mixmaster-type behavior, but with the principal axes of expansion changing their directions as well as their roles (as characterized by the u parameter) at each step, and with the mixmaster parameters spatially variable. [For more details see Belinsky, Lifshitz, and Khalatnikov (1971), and Ryan (1971, 1972).] It is not yet (1972) known whether there are important solutions or classes of solutions relevant to the cosmological problem, with asymptotic singularity behavior no! described by the Khalatnikov-Lifshitz generic case. The difficulty in reaching a definitive assessment here is that Khalatnikov and Lifshitz use essentially local methods, confined to a single coordinate patch, whereas the desired assessment poses an essentially global question. The global approaches (described in Chapter 34) have not, however, provided any comparable description of the nature of the singularity whose necessity they prove. One attempt to bridge these differences in technique and content is the work by Eardley, Liang, and Sachs (1972). (2) as a prototype for generic behavior near singularities Are there any other generic types of behavior near singularities? 806 30. ANISOTROPIC AND INHOMOGENEOUS COSMOLOGIES (continued 0/1 page 815) Box' 30.1 THE MIXMASTER COSMOLOGY A Generalized Kasner Model For the purposes of this paragraph only, define Two generalizations must be implemented in order to progress from the Kasner example (30.1) of a cosmological singularity to the Mixmaster exam- ple. The first is to allow a more general time- dependence while preserving some of the sim- plicity of the conditions (30.2) on the exponents Pi' Note that these exponents satisfy, e.g., Pz = din g22/ din g. Therefore one is led to parametrize the 3 X 3 spatial metric as gij = e2 a ( e 2 /3)ij (1) or equivalently, (ln g)i; = 2a 8ij + 2f3 i ;, where f3ij is a traceless 3 X 3 symmetric matrix, and the exponential is a matrix power series, so det e 2 /3 = 1 and The Mixmaster Cosmology is a valuable example. As described in §30.7, it shows a singularity be- havior which illustrates most of the features of the most general examples known. In particular, it shows how properties of empty space reminiscent of an elastic solid become evident near the cos- mological singularity.

Negative curvatures, however, arise in-this closed universe from large shear (13) deformations near the singularity and become large enough to reverse one Kasner shear motion [u-value, etc.; equation (10)] and change it to another. These conclusions and further details of the time-evolution of the \"Mixmaster\" metric (11, 12) require, in principle, the study of all the Einstein equations, not just equation (13) for TOo. As de- scribed in Chapter 21, however, this TOO constraint equation is central, and actually contains implicitly the full content of the Einstein equations when formulated properly. Variational Principles One adequate formulation, adopted here, involves treating equation (13) not as an energy equation (involving velocities), but as a Hamiltonian (in- volving momenta). Take the Einstein variational principle (21.15) in ADM form (21.95) and carry out the space integration, using (17) (15) (16) 6p\\ = p+ + p_ 0, 6p 2 2 = P+ - p- 0, 6p 3 3 = -2p+ with to obtain the action integral in the form I = ('iT) f ('iT ii dg ii + Ne 3a [3 R IX + e- 6a (; ('iTJ£f - 'iTik'iTik)]dt}.

If equation (13) is interpreted in terms of an anisotropy energy density contributing, with TOo, to the volume ex- pansior: a 2 , then there are not only kinetic energy terms 13 2 [as in equations (5) and (7)], but also a potential energy term. This term shows that nega- tive scalar curvature, which can be produced by anisotropy (13 j:. 0), is equivalent to a positive po- tential (or \"internal\") energy, and suggests that empty space has properties with analogies to an elastic solid and resists shear strains.

Note, however, that one does not remove the arbitrariness in the lapse function by taking it to be some specified function N(t) of the coordinates. Instead the procedure adopted here is to eliminate N from the variational princi- ple (21) by choosing it (coordinate condition!) to be some chosen function of the field variables and momenta, N = N (a, f3±>Pa'P±>, Any such choice, inserted in equation (21), leaves a variational inte- gral in canonical Hamiltonian form.

Mixmaster Dynamics If matter terms with no additional degrees of free- dom are included, the super-Hamiltonian in equa- tion (29) is modified simply. For an example, choose TOO = - TOo = (3/4)2(p.e- 3a + Fe- 4a ) (30) for. the energy density of matter in a frame with time-axis eo = N-I(O lot). The two terms represent a nonrelativistic perfect fluid (p ex: V-I) and a radiation fluid (p ex: V-4/3), respectively, and lead to 2X = -Pa 2 + p+ 2 + p_ 2 + e 4a (V - 1) 31 + p.&a + Fe2 a . ( ) This Hamiltonian, with its simple quadratic mo- mentum dependence, differs in only two ways from the Hamiltonians of elementary mechanics, namely, (1) in the sign of the Pa 2 term and (2) in the detailed shape of the \"potential\" term as func- tion of ex and f3±, the study of which reduces to a study of the function V(f3). Hamilton's equa- tions, from varying ex, f3±> Pa' and P± in equation (29), yield d 2 f3± oX 1 4a a V --2 = --= --e - (32) d\"A of3± 2 of3± and d 2 ex \"+ 0:7{ 2 4a(V 1) 3_'ln d\"A2 = a;;- = e - + \"2 p.e-- + Fe 2a . (33) Thus the sign of the Pa 2 term causes ex to accelerate toward (rather than away from) higher values of the \"potential\" terms e 4a ( V-I) + p.e 3a + Fe 2a . When I VI ~ 1 (small anisotropy), equation (33) is identical to its form in the isotropic Friedmann model, and allows a deceleration only when ex is large enough that the positive curvature term (- e 4a ) dominates over matter (p.&a) and radiation (Fe2 a ). Near the singularity (ex -+ -00), the positive curvature term is always negligible compared to radiation and matter. For studies of the singularity behavior, it is sufficient to study the simplified super-Hamilton- ian since the other terms obviously vanish for ex -+ - 00. This form retains only the V term in 3 R Ix = ie- 2a (1 - V), which dominates when the cur- vature of this closed universe becomes negative, V ~ 1.

Set /3+ = (/3+ - ~ a) /V3/4, a = (a - ; /3+ ) / V3/4, and find 2X = -p(/ + p/ + p_ 2 + ; exp (-4v3iJ+). (40) For this super-Hamiltonian both Pa and p_ are constants of motion, whereas the 7:J -Hamiltonian P+ , P+ 2 + ~e-4V3iI+, represents a simple bounce against a one-dimensional potential wall with the initial and final values of P+ different only in sign. The behavior of the anisotropy parameters /3± near the singularity thus consists of a simple Kasner step (where d/3±/da = const., with the d/3+/da ~ ~, or conditions equivalent by symmetry, satisfied rela- tiv~ to one of the three walls), followed by a bounce against that wall, beginning a new Kasner step with other Kasner parameters. [The most de- tailed description of this behavior and its relation to more general cosmological models can be found in Belinsky, Khalatnikov, and Lifshitz (1970)-see also the briefer report, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz (1970)-using quite different methods. For de- tailed developments by Hamiltonian methods, which supercede the partial Lagrangian methods of Misner (1969b), see Misner (1970, 1972a), and Ryan (1972a,b).) Steady-State, Quasiperiodic Infinity of \"Bounces\" Approaching the Singularity Some comprehensive features of the singularity behavior, involving many Kasner-like steps, can be exhibited by another transformation of the parameter space (superspace) of the metric field. 30. ANISOTROPiC AND INHOMOGENEOUS COSMOLOGIES The transformation introduces a \"radial\" 1- coordinate out from the origin of a/3± space, wllile respecting the metric properties of this superspace implied by the form of the super-Hamiltonian. Thus one defines (for any constant ao) a o - a = e t cosh S, /3+ = e sinh s coscj>, (41) /3_ = e t sinh s sin 9, and finds 2.'7{= e- 2t [( -Pt 2 + p./ + p/ sinh- 2 n + e2 t e 4a V). (42) The advantage of this transformation is that in the limit I ---+ 00 (a ---+ - 00, singularity) the po- tential terms become, in first approximation, inde- pendent of I. Thus equation (37) gives, for one potential wall, e2 t e4\" V - ; e 2t exp [ 4a o (43) - 8e t ( sinh s cos cj> + ; cosh s ) l For I ---+ 00 this expression evidently tends to either zero or infinity, depending on the sign of the expr~ssion in parentheses. Therefore define the asymptotic potential walls by 1 tanh s + 2\" sec cj> = 0 (44) in the sector Icj> - 'IT I < 'IT/3, and equivalent for- mulae in which cj> is replaced by cj> -+- (2'IT/3) for the other sides of the triangle. Consequently, an asymptotic approximation to the super-Hamil- tonian is 2X = e- 2t [-Pt 2 + p./ + p\",2 s inh- 2 s + V'(s,cj»), (45) where V'(s, cj» vanishes inside the asymptotic walls (44) and equals + 00 outside.

[More de- tailed studies based on this asymptotic super- Hamiltonian show that the motion is even ergodic, with sep approaching arbitrarily close to any given value infinitely many times as t ---+ 00; see Chitre (1972a).] Summary One has found the singularity behavior in this Mixmaster example to be extraordinarily active. In the simple Kasner singularity, two axes col- lapse, but the thircns stretched in a simple tidal deformation accompanied by volume compres- sion. But in the Mixmaster example, every such collapse attempt is defeated by the high negative curvature it implies. Or rather it is divened to another attempt as compression continues in- exorably, but the tidal deformations attempt first one configuration, then another, in an infinitely recurring probing of all possible configurations. Speculations on Time and the Singularity The cosmological singularity (in all examples where its character is not known to be unstable) involves infinite curvature and infinite density. One's abhorence of such a theoretical prediction is panicularly heightened by the correlative pre- diction that these infinities occurred at a finite proper time in the past, and would-if they 813 recur-occur again at some finite proper time in the future. The singularity prediction would be more tolerable if the infinite densities could be removed to the infinitely distant past. The universe could then, as now, find its natural state to be one of expansion, so every finite density will have been experienced at some suitably remote past time, but infinite density becomes a formal abstraction never realized in the course of evolution. To push infinite curvature out of the finite past might be achieved in two ways. It is not known which, if either, works. One way is to change the physical laws which require the singularity, chang- ing them perhaps only in obvious and desirable ways, such as stating the laws of gravity in a proper quantum language. Computations of quantum ge- ometry are not yet definitive, however, and some (perhaps inadequate) approximations [Misner (1972a)] do not remove the singularity problem. Another way to discard the singularity is to accept the mathematics of the classical Einstein equations, but reinterpret it in terms of an infinite past time. There are, of course, simple and utterly inadequate ways to do this by arbitrary coordinate transformations such as t = In T which change a T = 0 singularity into one at t = - 00. But an arbitrary coordinate is without significance. The problem is that the singularity occurs at a finite proper time in the past, and proper time is the most physiCally significant, most physica1ly real time we know. It corresponds to the ticking of physical clocks and measures the natural rhythms of actual events. To reinterpret finite past time as infinite, one must attack proper time on precisely these grounds, and claim it is inadequately physical. On a local basis, where special relativity is valid, no challenge to the physical significance of proper time can succeed. It is on a more global scale that the physical primacy of proper time needs to be reviewed. \"The cosmological singularity occurred ten thousand million years ago.\" In this statement, take time to mean the proper time along the world line of the solar system, ephemeris time. Then the statement would have a most direct physical sig-"},{"pageNumber":841,"pageContent":"814 30. ANISOTROPIC AND INHOMOGENEOUS COSMOLOGIES Box 30.1 (continued) nificance if it meant that the Earth had compleied 10 10 orbit,s about the sun since the beginning of the universe. But proper time is not that closely tied to actual physical phenomena. The statement merely implies that those 5 X 10 9 orbits which the earth may have actually accomplished give a standard of time which is to be extrapolated in prescribed ways, thus giving theoretical meaning to the other 5 X 10 9 years which are asserted to have preceeded the formation of the solar system. A hardier standard clock changes the details of the argument, but not its qualitative conclusion. To interpret 10 10 years in terms of SI (Systeme Intemationale) seconds assigns a past history con- taining some 3 X 10 27 oscillations of a hyperfine transition in neutral Cesium. But again the critical early ticks of the clock (needed to locate the singularity in time by actual physical events) are missing. The time needed for stellar nucleo- synthesis to produce the first Cesium disqualifies this clock on historical grounds, and the still earlier high temperatures nearer the singularity would have ionized all Cesium even if this element had predated stars. Thus proper time near the singularity is not a direct counting of simple and actual physical phenomena, but an elaborate mathematical extrapolation. Each actual clock has its \"ticks\" discounted by a suitable factor-3 X 10 7 seconds per orbit from the Earth-sun system, 1.1 X 10- 10 seconds per oscillation for the Cesium transition, etc. Since no single clock (because of its finite size and strength) is conceivable all the way back to the singularity, a statement about the proper time since the singularity involves the· concept of an infinite sequence of successively smaller and sturdier clocks with their ticks then discounted and added. \"Finite proper time,\" then, need not imply that any finite sequence of events was possible. It may describe -a necessarily infinite number of events (\"ticks\") in any physically conceivable his- tory, converted by mathematics into a finite sum by the action of a non-local convergence factor, the \"discount\" applied to convert \"ticks\" into \"proper time.\" Here one has the conceptual inverse of Zeno's paradox. One rejects Zeno's suggestion that a sin- gle swing of a pendulum is infinitely complicated- being composed of a half period, plus a quarter period, plus 2-n ad infinitum-because the terms in his infinite series are mathematical abstractions, not physically achieved discrete acts in a drama that must be played out. By a comparable stand- ard, one should ignore as a mathematical abstrac- tion the finite sum of the proper-time series for the age of the universe, if it can be proved that there must be an infinite number of discrete acts played out during its past history. In both cases, finiteness would be judged by counting the num- ber of discrete ticks on realizable clocks, not by assessing the weight of unrealizable mathematical abstractions. Whether the universe is infinitely old by this standard remains to be determined. The quantum influences, in particular, remain to be calculated. The decisive question is whether each present- epoch event is subject to the influence of infinitely many previous discrete events. In that case statisti- cal assumptions (large numbers, random phases, etc.) could enter in stronger ways into theories of cosmology. The Mixmaster cosmological model does have an infinite past history in this sense, since each \"bounce\" from one Kasner-like motion to another is a recognizable cosmological event, of which infinitely many must be realized between any finite epoch and the singularity."},{"pageNumber":842,"pageContent":"§30.8.

HORIZONS AND THE ISOTROPY OF THE MICROWAVE BACKGROUND 815 The fundamental cosmological question-\"Must a universe that is born chaotic necessarily become as homogeneous and isotropic as our universe is, and do so before. life evolves?\"-entails one further issue. This issue is horizons. As was discussed in §27.l0, at any given epoch in the expansion ofa Friedmann universe (e.g., the present epoch), there may be significant portions of the universe from which no light signal or other causally propagating influence will have yet reached Earth in the time available since the initial singularity. \"If we should live so long,\" the question would arise, \"will the new portions of the universe which first come into view during the next ten billion years look statistically identical to the neighboring portions which are already being seen?\" Fortunately, this question need not be posed only for the future. It Can be asked as of some past time, and the answer then is yes. Microwave background radiation arrives at the earth from all directions in the sky with very nearly the same tempera- ture. [The data of Boughn, Fram, and Partridge (1971) and of Conklin (1969) show zjT!-T~~ 0.004.] The plasma that emitted the microwave radiation coming to earth from one direction in the sky had not been able, before the epoch of emission, to communicate causally with the plasma emitting the radiation that arrives from other directions. If one adopts a Friedmann model of the universe, then different sectors of the microwave sky are disjoint from each other in this sense if they are separated from each other by more than 30°, even if the microwaves were emitted as recently as z = 7. (The critical angle is much smaller if the microwaves were last scattered at z = 1,000.) From this, one concludes that the foundations for the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe were laid long before the universe became approximately Friedmann, for if statistical homogeneity and isotropy of the universe had not already been achieved at the longest wavelengths earlier, these horizon limitations would have prevented any further synchronization of conditions over large scales while the universe was in a nearly Friedmann state, and small amplitude (10%) deviations from isotropy should be observed now. The mixmaster universe received its name from the hope that it could contribute to the solution of this problem. The very large u values that occur sporadically an infinite number of times near the singularity in a mixmaster universe give a geometry close to that of the Kasner model with PI = 1, pz = P3 = O. This model can be written in the form Horizons in a Friedmann universe Observed isotropy of microwave radiation proves foundations for homogeneity were laid before universe became Friedmann-like What made the universe homogeneous and isotropic?

CHAPTER 31 SCHWARZSCHILD GEOMETRY §31.1. INEVITABILITY OF COLLAPSE FOR MASSIVE STARS There is no equilibrium state at the endpoint of thermonuclear evolution for a star containing more than about twice the number of baryons in the sun (A > A max -- 2A 0 ). This is one of the most surprising-and disturbing-consequences of the discussion in Chapter 24. Stated differently: A star with A > A max -- 2A 0 must eject all but A max of its baryons-e.g., by nova or supernova explosions-before settling down into its final resting state;_otherwise there will be no final resting state for it to settle down into. What .is the fate of a star that fails to eject its excess baryons before nearing the endpoint of thermonuclear evolution? For example, after a very massive supernova explosion, what will become of the collapsed degenerate-neutron core when it contains more than A max baryons? Such a supercritical mass cannot explode, since it is gravitationally bound and it has no more thermonuclear energy to release. Nor can it reach a static equilibrium state, since there exists no such state for so large a mass. There remains only one alternative; the supercritical mass must collapse through its \"gravitational radius,\" r = 2M,leaving behind a gravitating \"black hole\" in space. The phenomenon of collapse through the gravitational radius, as described by classical general relativity, will be the subject of the next chapter. However, before tackling it, one must understand more fully t.han heretofore the Schwarzschild spacetime geometry, which surrounds black holes and collapsing stars as well as static stars. This chapter will concern itself with two topics that, at first sight, appear to be disconnected.

That this asymmetry irons itself out will therefore give one some preliminary insight into how more complicated asymmetries also iron themselves out. In brief, the motion of the test particle and the dynamics of the Schwarzschild geometry (for this geometry will prove to be dynamic), two apparently different problems, have the happy ability to throw light on each other. §31.2. THE NONSINGULARITY OF THE GRAVITATIONAL RADIUS The Schwarzschild spacetime geometry (31.1 ) The Schwarzschild line element becomes singular at r = 2M (\"gravitational radius\") appears to behave badly near r = 2M; there gil becomes zero, and grr becomes infinite. However, one cannot be sure without careful study whether this pathology in the line element is due to a patl!~!~gy in the __ ~Lry_~ts~lf, or _~e.rely to ~ Rath0.!9gy of the (t, r, e, 1» coordinafesystem near r = 2M. (As an example of a coordinate:Iil(luce<tpaffiOIOgy, consider the neighborhood of e = 0 on one of the invariant spher~s, t = const and r = const. There g;; becomes zero because the coordinate system behaves badly; however, the intrinsic, coordinate-independent geometry of the sphere is well-behaved there. For another example, see Figure 1.4. The worrisome region of the Schwarzschild geometry, r = 2M, is called the \"grav- itational radius,\" or the \"Schwarzschild radius,\" or the \"Schwarzschild surface,\" or the \"Schwarzschild horizon,\" or the \"Schwarzschild sphere.\" It is also called the \"Schwarzschild singularity\" in some of the older literature; but that is a misnomer, since, as will be shown, the spacetime geometry is not si~lgular there. To determine whether the spacetime geometry is singular -at the gravitational radius, send an explorer in from far away to chart it. For simplicity, let him fall freely and radially into the gravitational radius, carrying his orthonormal tetrad with him as he falls. His trajectory through spacetime [\"parabolic orbit\"; radial geodesic of metric (31.1)] is 2~ = - ; C~ Y/2 + constant, _t ~ (..!-)3/2 _ (-!-)1/2 In I (rj2M)1/2 + 11 2M 3 2M 2 2M + (rj2M)1/2 _ 1 + constant.

Of all the features of the traveler's trajectory, one stands out most dearly and disturbingly: to reach the gravitational radius, r = 2M, requires a finite lapse of proper time, but an' infinite lapse of coordinate time: §31.2. NONSINGULARITY OF THE GRAVITATIONAL RADIUS 821 An infalling observer reaches r = 2M in finite proper time but infinite coordinate time (313) r/2M = 1 - (7 + constant)/2M when near r = 2M; r/2M = 1 + constant X exp (-t/2M) in limit as t -+ 00. (see Fig. 25.5.) Of course, proper time is the relevant quantity for the explorer's heart-beat and health. No coordinate system has the power to prevent him from reaching r = 2M. Only tIie-coordinate-i~d~p~de\"llt geometry of spacetime could possibly -dothat; and equation (31.3) shows it does not! Let the explorer approach and reach r = 2M, then.

The tidal forces felt by the explorer as he passes a given radius r are measured by the components of the Riemann curvature tensor with respect to his orthonormal frame there (equation of geodesic deviation). To calculate those curvature compo- nents at r, proceed in two steps. (1) Calculate the components, not in the traveler's frame, but rather in the \"static\" orthonormal frame .

The payoff of this calculation: according to equations (31.6), none of the compo- nents of Riemann in the explorer's orthonormal frame become infinite at the gravitational radius. The tidal forces the traveler feels as he approaches r = 2M are finite; they do not tear him apart-at least not when the mass M is sufficiently great, because at r = 2M the typical non-zero component Ra!JY~ of the curvature tensor is of the order I j M2. The gravitational radius is a perfectly well-behaved, nonsingular region of spacetime, and nothing there can prevent the explorer from falling on inward. By contrast, deep inside the gravitational radius, at r = 0, the traveler must encounter infinite tidal forces, independently of the route he uses to reach there. One says that \"r = 0 is a physical singularity of spacetime.\" To see this, one need only calculate from equation (31.4b) or (31.6) the \"curvature invariant\": (31.7) Box 31.1 THE \"SCHWARZSCHILD SINGULARITY\": HISTORICAL REMARKS Although Eddington (1924) was the first to con- struct a coordinate system that is nonsingular at r = 2M, he seems not to have recognized the sig- nificance of his result. Lemaitre (1933c, especially p. 82) appears to have been the first to recognize that the so-called \"Schwarzschild singularity\" at r = 2M is not a singularity. He wrote, \"La singu- larite du champ de Schwarzschild est done une singularite fictive, analogue a celIe qui se presen- tait a l'horizon du centre dans la forme origin ale de l'univers de de Sitter\". He also provided a coordinate system to go through r = 2M. How- ever, his coordinate system, like Eddington's, cov- ered only half of the Schwarzschild geometry: regions I and II of Figure 31.3. Synge (1950) was the first to discover the incompleteness in the Ed- dington and Lemaitre coordinate systems, and to provide coordinates that cover the entire geometry (regions I, II, III, IV of Figure 31.3). Fronsdal (1959), unaware of Synge's work, rediscovered the global structure of the Schwarzschild geometry by means of embedding diagrams and calculations. The coordinate system that provides maximum insight into the Schwarzschild geometry is the one generally known as the Kruskal-Szekeres coordi- nate system. It was constructed independently by Kruskal (1960) and by Szekeres (1960)."},{"pageNumber":850,"pageContent":"In every local Lorentz frame this will be a sum of products of curvature components, and it will have the same value 48M2/ r 6.

BEHAVIOR OF SCHWARZSCHILD COORDINATES AT r = 2M EXERCISE Since the spacetime geometry is well behaved at the gravitational radius, the singular Nature of the coordinate behavior there of the Schwarzschild metric components, gtt = - (1 - 2M/r) and pathology at , = 2M: grr = (1 - 2M/r)-I, must be due to a pathology there of the Schwarzschild coordi- nates t, r, 0, cp. Somehow one must find a way to get rid of that pathology-i.e., one must construct a new coordinate system from which the pathology is absent. Before doing this, it is helpful to understand better the precise nature of the pathology .. , The most obvious pathology at r = 2M is the reversal there of the roles of t and \\(1) t and, reverse roles as r as timelike and spacelike coordinates. In the region r > 2M, the t direction, a/at, i timelike and spacelike coordinates is timelike (gtt < 0) and the r direction, a/or, is spacelike (grr > 0); but in the region r < 2M, a/at is spacelike (gtt > 0) and a/or is timelike (grr < 0). What does it mean for r to \"change in character from a spacelike coordinate to a timelike one\"? The explorer in his jet-powered spaceship prior to arrival at r = 2M always has the option to turn on his jets and change his motion from decreasing r (in fall) to increasing r (escape). Quite the contrary is the situation when he has once allowed himself to fall inside r = 2M. Then the further decrease of r represents the passage of time. No command that the traveler can give to his jet engine will turn back time. That unseen power of the world which drags everyone forward willy-nilly from age twenty to forty and from forty to eighty also .drags the rocket in from time coordinate r = 2M to the later value of the fime coordinate r = O. No human act of will, no engine, no rocket, no force (see exercise 31.3) can make time stand still. As surely as cells die, as surely as the traveler's watch ticks away \"the unforgiving minutes,\" with equal certainty, and with never one hO~t~long the way, r drops from 2M to O. At r = 2M, where rand t exchange roles as space and time coordinates, gtl vanishes while gTT is infinite.

SEVERAL WELL-BEHAVED COORDINATE SYSTEMS The well-behaved coordinate system that is easiest to visualize is one in which the radially moving test particles of equations (31.10) remain always at rest (\"co moving coordinates\"). Such coordinates were first used by Novikov (1963). Novikov attaches a specific value of his radial coordinate, R*, to each test particle as it emerges from the singularity of infinite tidal forces at r = 0, and insists that the particle carry that value of R* throughout its \"cycloidallife\"-up through r = 2M to r = r max , then back down through r = 2M to r = O. For definiteness, Novikov expresses the R* value for each particle in terms of the peak point on its trajectory by (31.11) (2) line element As a time coordinate, Novikov uses proper time T of the test particles, normalized so T = 0 at the peak of the or~it. Every particle in the swarm is ejected in such a manner that it arrives at the s·tiinmitof its trajectory (r = r max' T = 0) at one and the same value of the Schwarzschild coordinate time; namely, at t = O. Simple th~ugh-:they may be conceptually, the Novil<;v coordinates are related to the original Schwarzschild coordinates by a very complicated transformation: (1) combine equations (31.10b) and (31.11) to obtain 1/(T, R*); (2) combine 1/(T, R*) with (31.l0a) and (31.11) to obtain reT, R*); (3) combinq(T, R*) with (31.10c) and (31.11) to obtain t(T, R*).

The resulting coordin~t~~stem is related to Schwarzschild coordinates by [see equations (1)] v - D = 2r*, V + D = 2t; and the line element in terms of the new coordinates reads (6a) (6b) (7) Contrary to one's hopes, this coordinate system is pathological at r = 2M. Second thoughts about the construction reveal the trouble: the surfaces D = constant (outgoing null surfaces) used in constructing it are geometrically well- defined, as are the surfaces V = constant (ingoing null surfaces); but the way of labeling them is not. Any relabeling, u = F( D) and v = G( V), will leave the surfaces unchanged physically. What one needs is a relabeling that will get rid of the singular factor 1 - 2M/r in the line element (7). A successful relabeling is suggested by the equation exp [( V - D)/4M] = exp (r*/2M) = (r/2M - 1) exp (r/2M), (8)"},{"pageNumber":859,"pageContent":"Box 31.2 (continued) which follows from equations (6a) and (Ic).

In terms of these new coordinates, the line element reads Here r is still defined by 4\"r 2 = surface area, but it must be regarded as a function ofv and Ii: (r/2M - 1)e T / 2M = -liv. (lOb) One can readily verify that this equation determines r uniquely (recall: r > O!) in terms of the product liv [details in Misner (I969a)]. The coordinates, Ii, v, which label the ingoing and outgoing null surfaces, are null coordinates; i.e., a/eli, a/ali = gil;; = 0, a/avo a/av = g;; = 0 [see equation (lOa)]. If one is not accustomed to working with null coordinates, it is helpful to replace Ii and v by spacelike and timelike coordinates, u and v (Kruskal- Szekeres coordinates!) defined by so that u = ; (v - Ii) = (r/2M - I)l/2 e T/4M cosh (t/4M), v = ; (v + Ii) = (r/2M - 1)1/2 e T/4M sinh (t/4M), dv 2 - du 2 = dV dUo (Ila) (ll b) (I2) In terms of these coordinates, the line element has the Kruskal form (31.14), which is fully well-behaved at the gravitational radius. Although the Kruskal-Szekeres line element is well behaved at r = 2M, the transforma tion (ll) from Schwarzschild to Kruskal-Szekeres is not; it becomes meaningless (u and v \"imaginary\") when one moves from r > 2M to r < 2M. Of course, this is a manifestation of the pathologies of Schwarzschild coordinates. By trial and error, one readily finds a new transformation, to replace (II) at r < 2M, leading from Schwarzschild to Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates: u == (l - r/2M)1I2 e T/4M sinh (t/4M), v = (l - r/2M)1/2 e T/4M cosh (t/4M).

To understand this covering more clearly, transform back from Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates to Schwarzschild coordinates (see Figure 31.3). The transformation equations, as written down in.

This question is most readily answered by means of embedding diagrams analogous to those for an equilibrium star (§23.8; Figure 23.1; and end of Box 23.2) and for Friedmann universes of positive and negative spatial curvature [equations (27.23) and (27.24) and Box 27.2]. Examine, first, the geometry of the spacelike hypersurface v = 0, which extends from u = + 00 (r = 00) into u = 0 (r = 2M) and then out to u = - 00 (r = 00). In Schwarzschild coordinates this surface is a slice of constant time, t = 0 [see equation (31.18b)]; it is precisely the surface for which an embedding diagram was calculated in equation (23.34b).

This bridge is sometimes called the \"Einstein-Rosen bridge\" and sometimes the \"Schwarzschild throat\" or the \"Schwarzschild wormhole.\" If one so wishes, one can change the topology of the Schwarzschild geometry by connecting the two asymptotically flat universes together in a region distant from the Schwarzschild throat [Fuller and Wheeler (1962); Fig. 31.5b]. The single. unique universe then becomes multiply connected, with the Schwarzschild throat providing one spacelike path from point {/ to point !13, and the nearly fiat universe providing another. For concreteness, focus attention on the interpretation of the Schwarzschild geometry, not in terms of Wheeler's multiply connected single universe, but rather in terms of the Einstein- Rosen double universe of Figure 31.5,a. One is usually accustomed to think of the Schwarzschild geometry as static. However, the static \"time translations,\" t ----+- t + Lit, which leave the Schwarzschild geometry unchanged, are time translations in the strict sense of the words only in regions I and III of the Schwarzschild geometry. In regions II and IV, t ----+- t + Lit is a spacelike motion, not a timelike motion (see Fig. 31.3). Conse- quently, a spacelike hypersurface, such as the surface t == const of Figure 31.5,a, which extends from region I through u == v == 0 into region III, is not static. As this spacelike hypersurface is pushed forward in time (in the + v direction of the Kruskal diagram), it enters region II, and its geometry begins to change. In order to examine the time-development of the Schwarzschild geometry, one needs a sequence of embedding diagrams, each corresponding to the geometry of a spacelike hypersurface to the future of the preceding one. But how are the hyper- surfaces to be chosen? In Newtonian theory or special relativity, one chooses hyper- surfaces of constant time. But in dynamic regions of curved spacetime, no naturally preferred time coordinate exists. This situation forces one to make a totally arbitrary choice of hypersurfaces to use in visualizing the time-development of geometry, and to keep in mind how very arbitrary that choice was. Figure 31.6 uses two very different choices of hypersurfaces to depict the time- development of the Schwarzschild geometry. (Still other choices are shown in Figure 21.4.) Notice that the precise geometry of the evolving bridge depends on the arbitrary choice of spacelike hypersurfaces, but that the qualitative nature of the evolution is independent of the choice of hypersurfaces. Qualitatively speaking, the two asymptotically fiat universes begin disconnected, with each one containing a singularity of infinite curvature (r == 0). As the two universes evolve in time, their singularities join each other and form a nonsingular bridge. The bridge enlarges, until it reaches a maximum radius at the throat of r == 2M (maximum circumference of 4'1TM; maximum surface area of 16'1TM2). It then contracts and pinches off, leaving the two universes disconnected and containing singularities (r == 0) once again. The formation, expansion, and collapse of the bridge occur so rapidly, that no particle or light ray can pass across the bridge from the faraway region of the one universe to the faraway region of the other without getting caught and crushed in the throat as it pinches off. (To verify this, examine the Kruskal-Szekeres diagram of Figure 31.3, where radial light rays move along 45-degree lines.)"},{"pageNumber":866,"pageContent":"v 839 -v F' E E' -II D D' II C' B' §31.6.

The embedding diagrams are skeletonized in that each diagram must be rotated about the appropriate vertical axis in order to become two-dimensional surfaces analogous to Figure 31.5,a. [Notice that the hypersurfaces of which embedding diagrams are given intersect the singularity only tangentially. Hypersurfaces that intersect the singularity at a finite angle in the u,v-plane are not shown because they cannot be embedded in a Euclidean space. Instead, a Minkowski space (indefinite metric) must be used, at least near r = O. For an example of an embedding in Minkowski space, see the discussion of a universe with constant negative spatial curvature in equations (27.23) and (27.24) and Box 27.2C.1 Figure 21.4 exhibits embed- ding diagrams for other space like slices in the Schwarzschild geometry. From the Kruskal-Szekeres diagram and the 45-degree nature of its radial light rays, one sees that any particle that ever finds itself in region IV of spacetime must have been \"created\" in the earlier singularity; and any particle that ever Jalls into region II is doomed to be crushed in the later singularity. Only particles that stay forever in one of the asymptotically fiat universes I or III, outside the gravitational radius (r > 2M), are forever safe from the singularities. Some investigators, disturbed by the singularities at r = 0 or by the \"double-uni- verse';- nature of the Schwarzschild geometry, have proposed modifications of its topology. One proposal is that the earlier and later singularities be identified with each other, so that a particle which falls into the singularity of region II, instead of being destroyed, will suddenly reemerge, being ejected, from the singularity of region IV. One cannot overstate the objections to this viewpoint: the region r = 0 is a physical singularity of infinite tidal gravitation forces and infinite Riemann curvature. Any particle that falls into that singularity must be destroyed by those Creation and destruction in the singularities Nonviable proposals for modifying the topology of Schwarzschild spacetime"},{"pageNumber":867,"pageContent":"840 31. SCHWARZSCHILD GEOMETRY EXERCISES forces. Any attempt to extrapolate its fate through the singularity using Einstein's field equations must fail; the equations lose their predictive power in the face of infinite curvature. Consequently, to postulate that the particle reemerges from the earlier singularity is to make up an ad hoc mathematical rule, one unrelated to physics. It is conceivable, but few believe it true. that any object of finite mass will modify the geometry of the singularity as it approaches r = 0 to such an extent that it can pass through and reemerge. However, whether such a speculation is correct must be answered not by ad hoc rules, but by concrete, difficult computations within the framework of general relativity theory (see Chapter 34). A second proposal for modifying the topology of the Schwarzschild geometry is this: one should avoid the existence of two different asymptotically fiat universes by identifying each point (u, u. B, 9) with its opposite point (- U, -II, B, <1» in the Kruskal-Szekeres coordinate system. Two objections to this proposal are: (1) it pro- duces a sort of \"conical\" singularity (absence of local Lorentz frames) at (u, u) = (0,0), i.e., at the neck of the bridge at its moment of maximum expansion; and (2) it leads to causality violations in which a man can meet himself going backward in time.

RELEVANCE OF SCHWARZSCHILD GEOMETRY The story that unfolded in the preceeding chapter was fantastic! One began with the innocuous looking Schwarzschild line element (32.1 ) The roles and relevance of the Schwarzschild geometry which was derived originally as the external field of a static star. One asked what happens if the star is absent; i.e., one probed the nature of the Schwarzschild geometry when no star is present to generate it. One might have expected the geometry to be that of a point mass sitting at r = O. But it was not. It turned out to represent a \"wormhole\" connecting two asymptotically fiat universes. Moreover, the wormhole was dynamic. It was created by the \"joining together\" of two \"r = 0\" singularities, one in each universe; it expanded to a maximum circumference of4wM; it then recontracted and pinched off, leaving the two universes disconnected once again, each with its own \"r = 0\" singularity. As a solution to Einstein's field equations, this expanding and recontracting wormhole must be taken seriously. It is an exact solution; and it is one of the simplest of all exact solutions. But there is no reason whatsoever to believe that such worm- holes exist in the real universe! They can exist only if the expanding universe, -10 X 10 9 years ago, was \"born\" with the necessary initial conditions-with \"r = 0\""},{"pageNumber":870,"pageContent":"Schwarzschild singularities ready and waiting to blossom forth into wormholes. There is no reason at all to believe in such pathological initial conditions! Why, then, was so much time and effort spent in Chapter 31 on understanding the Schwarzschild geometry?

This chapter explores the role of the Schwarzschild geometry in gravitational collapse; the next chapter explores its role in black-hole physics. §32.2. BIRKHOFFS THEOREM 843 §32.2. BIRKHOFF'S THEOREM That the Schwarzschild geometry is relevant to gravitational collapse follows from BirkhojJ's (1923) theorem: Let the geometry of a given region of spacetime (1) be spherically symmetric, and (2) be a solution to the Einstein field equations in vacuum. Then that geometry is necessarily a piece of the Schwarzschild geometry. The external field of any electrically neutral, spherical star satisfies the conditions of Birkhoff's theorem, whether the star is static, vibrating, or collapsing. Therefore the external -fietdmust be a piece of the Schwarzschild geometry. Birkhoff's theorem is easily understood on physical grounds. Consider an equilib- rium configuration that is unstable against gravitational collapse and that, like all equilibrium configurations (see §23.6), has the Schwarzschild geometry as its external gravitational field. Perturb this equilibrium configuration in a spherically symmetric way, so that it begins to collapse radially. The perturbation and subsequent collapse cannot affect the external gravitational field so long as exact spherical symmetry is maintained. Just as Maxwell's laws prohibit monopole electromagnetic waves, so Einstein's laws prohibit monopole gravitational waves. There is no possible way for any gravitational influence of the radial collapse to propagate outward. Not only is Birkhoff's theorem easy to understand, but it is also fairly easy to prove.

EXTERIOR GEOMETRY OF A COLLAPSING STAR Consider a star that is momentarily static, but will subsequently begin to collapse. Its space geometry at the initial moment of Schwarzschild coordinate time, t = 0, has two parts: in the exterior, vacuum region (r > R > 2M), it is the Schwarzschild geometry (Birkhoff's theorem!); but in the star's interior, it is some other, totally different geometry. Whatever the interior geometry may be, it has an embedding diagram at time t = 0 which is qualitatively like that of Figure 23.1. (For discussion and proof of this, see §23.8.) Notice that the star's space geometry is obtained by discarding the lower universe of the full Schwarzschild geometry (Figure 31.5,a), and replacing it with a smooth \"bowl\" on which the matter of the star is contained. To follow the subsequent collapse of this star in the Schwarzschild coordinate system, or in the Kruskal-Szekeres coordinate system, or in an ingoing Eddington- Finkelstein coordinate system, one can similarly discard that part of the coordinate diagram which lies inside the star's surface, and keep only the exterior Schwarzschild region. (See Figure 32.1.) In place of the discarded interior Schwarzschild region, one must introduce some other coordinate system, line element, and diagram that correctly describe the interior of the collapsing star. From truncated coordinate diagrams (such as Figures 32.l,a,b,c), one can readily discover and understand the various peculiar features of collapse through the gravi- tational radius. (1) No matter how stiff may be the matter of which a (spherical) star is made, once its surface has collapsed within the gravitational radius, the star will continue to collapse until its surface gets crushed in the singularity at r = O. This one discovers by recalling that the star's surface cannot move faster than the speed of light, so its world line must always make an angle of less than 45 degrees with the v-axis of the Kruskal-Szekeres diagram. (2) No signal (e.g., photon) emitted from the star's surface after it collapses inside the gravitational radius can ever escape to an external observer. Rather, all signals emitted from inside the gravitational radius get caught and destroyed by the collapse of the surrounding geometry into the singularity at r = 0 as space \"pinches off\" around the star. (3) Consequently, an external observer can never see the star after it passes the gravitational radius; and he can never see the singularity that terminates its col- lapse-unless he chooses to fall through the gravitational radius himself and pay the price of death for the knowledge gained."},{"pageNumber":874,"pageContent":"Does this mean that the collapsing star instantaneously and completely disappears from external view as it reaches the gravitational radius? No, not according to the analysis depicted in Figure 31.1,c: Place an astrophysicist on the surface of a collapsing star, and have him send a series of uniformly spaced signals to a distant astronomer, at rest at r ~ 2M, to inform him of the progress of the collapse. These signals propagate along null lines in the spacetime diagram of Figure 31.1 c. The signals originate on the world line of the stellar surface, and they are received by the distant astronomer when they intersect his world line, r = constant ~ M. As the star collapses closer and closer to its gravitational radius, R = 2M, the signals, which are sent at equally spaced intervals according to the astrophysicist's clock, are received by the astronomer at more and more widely spaced intervals. The astrono- mer does not receive a signal emitted just before the gravitational radius is reached until after an infinite amount of time has elapsed; and he never receives signals emitted after the gravitational radius has been passed. Those signals, like the astro- physicist who sends them, after brief runs get caught and destroyed by the collapsing geometry in the singularity, at r = O. It is not only the star that collapses. The geometry around the star collapses. Hence, to the distant astronomer, the collapsing star appears to slow down as it approaches its gravitational radius: light from the star becomes more and more red-shifted. Clocks on the star appear to run more and more slowly. It takes an infinite time for the star to reach its gravitational radius; and, as seen by the distant astronomer, the star never gets beyond there. The optical appearance of a collapsing star was first analyzed mathematically, giving main attention to radially propagating photons, by J. R. Oppenheimer and H. Snyder (1939). More recently a number of workers have reexamined the problem [see, e.g., Podurets (1964),- Ames and Thorne (1968) and Jaffe (1969)]. The most important quantitative results of these studies are as follows. In the late stages of collapse, when the distant astronomer sees the star to be very near its gravitational radius, he observes its total luminosity to decay exponentially in time §32.3.

As time passes, these photons gradually leak out the diffuse spherical shell of trapped photons at r = 3M and fly off to the distant observer, who measures them to have redshift z :::: 2.

The region of spacetime inside the collapsing star is grey, that outside it is white. Only the geometry of the exterior region is that of Schwarzschild. The curve separating the grey and white regions is the geodesic world line of the surface of the collapsing star (equations [31.10) or [32.10) with r max = R i = 10 M). This world line is parameterized by proper time, .,., as measured by an observer who sits on the surface of the star; the radial light cones, as calculated from ds 2 = 0, are attached to it. Notice that, although the shapes of the light cones are not all the same relative to Schwarzschild coordinates or relative to Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, they are all the same relative to Kruskal- Szekeres coordinates. This is because light rays travel along 45-degree lines in the u,v-plane (dv = ±du), but they travel along curved paths in the r,l-plane and r, V-plane. The Kruskal-Szekeres spacetime diagram shown here is related to the Schwarzschild diagram by equations (31.13) pius a translation of Schwarzschild time: 1-+1 + 42.8 M. The Eddington-Finklestein diagram is related to the Schwarzschild diagram by V = I + r· = 1+ r + 2 Min Ir/2 M - Ii (see Box 31.2). It is evident from these diagrams that the free-fall collapse is characterized by a constantly diminishing radius, which drops from R = 10 M to R = 0 in a finite and short comoving proper time interval, .11.,. = 35.1 M. The point R = 0 and the entire region r = 0 outside the star make up a physical \"singular- ity\" at which infinite tidal gravitational forces-according to classical, unquantized general relativity-can and do crush matter to infinite density (see end of §31.2; also §32.6)."},{"pageNumber":876,"pageContent":"849 ...

COLLAPSE OF A STAR WITH UNIFORM DENSITY AND ZERO PRESSURE 851 When one turns attention to the interior of a collapsing star and to the precise world line that its surface follows in the Schwarzschild geometry, one encounters rather complicated mathematics. The simplest case to treat is that of a \"star\" with uniform density and zero pressure; and, indeed, until recently that was the only case which had been treated in detail. The original-and very complete-analysis of the collapse of such a uniform-density \"ball of dust\" was given in the classic paper of Oppen- heimer and Snyder (1939). More recently, other workers have discussed it from slightly different points of view and using different coordinate systems. The ap- proach taken here was devised by Beckedorff and Misner (1962). Because no pressure gradients are present to deflect their motion, the particles on the surface of any ball of dust must move along radial geodesics in the exterior Schwarzschild geometry. For a ball that begins at rest with finite radius, R = R i , at time t = 0, the subsequent geodesic motion of its surface is given by equations (31.10): The collapse, from rest, of a uniform-density ball of \" dust\": R = (RJ2)(1 + cos 1)), t = 2Mln I (RJ2M - 1)1/2 + tan (1)/2) I (R i /2M - 1)112 - tan (1)/2) + 2M(R/2M - 1)112[1) + (R/4M)(1) + sin 1))]. (32.10a) (1) world line of ball's surface in exterior Schwarzschild coordinates (32.1Ob) Here R is the Schwarzschild radial coordinate (i.e., 4 'IT R2 is the star's surface area) at Schwarzschild time t. This world line is plotted in Figure 32.1 for R i = 10M, in terms of Schwarzschild coordinates, Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates, and Eddington- Finkelstein coordinates. The proper time read by a clock on the surface of the collapsing star is given by equation (31.10b): (32.1Oc) Note that the collapse begins when the parameter 1) is zero (R = R i , t = 'T = 0); and it terminates at the singularity (R = 0,1) = 'IT) after a lapse of proper time, as measured on any test particle falling with the dust, equal to It is interesting, though coincidental, that this is precisely the time-lapse required for free-fall collapse to infinite density in Newtonian theory [see equation (25.27'), -------BFrgule 25.3, and a~_iateddiS€ussion]. What is the behavior of the interior of the ball of dust as it collapses? A variety of different interiors for pressureless dust Can be conceived (exercise 32.8). But here attention focuses on the simplest of them: an interior that is homogeneous and isotropic everywhere, except at the surface-i.e., an interior locally identical to a dust-filled Friedmann cosmological model (Box 27.1). Is the Friedmann interior to be \"open\" (k = - 1), \"flat\" (k = 0), or \"closed\" (k = + I)? Only the closed case (2) interior of ball is identical to a portion of a closed Friedmann universe"},{"pageNumber":879,"pageContent":"y 852 32. GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE is appropriate, since one has already demanded [equation (32.10)] that the star be at rest initially (initial rate of change of density equals zero; \"moment of maximum expansion\"). Using comoving hyperspherical coordinates, x, B, ep, for the star's interior, and putting the origin of coordinates at the star's center, one can write the line element in the interior in the familiar Friedmann form (32.11 ) Here a(or) is given by the familiar cycloidal relation, (32.12) and the density is given by [see equations (1), (9), (4), and (5) of Box 27.1, with 1) replaced by 1) + 'IT]. There is one possible difficulty with this interior solution. In the cosmological case, the solution was homogeneous and isotropic everywhere. Here homogeneity and isotropy are broken at the star's surface-which lies at some radius (3) the join between Friedmann interior and Schwarzschild exterior x = Xo (32.13) (32.14) for all or, as measured in terms of the hyperspherical polar angle x, a comoving coordinate (first picture in Box 27.2). At that surface (i.e., three-dimensional world tube enclosing the star's fluid) the interior Friedmann geometry must match smoothly onto the exterior Schwarzschild geometry. If the match cannot be achieved, then the Friedmann line element (32.11) cannot represent the interior of a collapsing star. An example of a case in which the matching could not be achieved is an interior of uniform and nonzero pressure, as well as uniform density. In that case there would be an infinite pressure gradient at the star's surface, which would blow off the outer layers of the star, and would send a rarefaction wave propagating inward toward its center. The uniform distribution of density and pressure would quickly be de- stroyed. For the case of zero pressure, the match is possible. As a partial verification of the match, one can examine the separate and independent predictions made by the interior and exterior solutions for the star's circumference, C =lwR, as a function of proper time or at the star's surface. The external Schwarzschild solution predicts the cycloidal relation, C = 2'lTR = 2'IT(RJ2)(l + COS1)), or = (R i 3j8M)l/2(1) + sin 1)) (32.15) [equations (32.10)].

Thus whether one region of the star collapses first, or another, or the entire star collapses simultaneously, is a function both of the spacetime geometry and of the choice of slicing. The party of explorers has this choice of slicing at their own control, and thus they themselves to this extent govern what kind of spacelike slices they will see as their exploration moves forward in time. The spacetime geometry that they slice, however, is in no way theirs to control or to change. To the extent that their masses are negligible and they serve merely as test objects, they have no influence whatsoever on the spacetime. It was fixed completely by the specification of the initial conditions for the collapse. In brief, spacetime is four-dimensional and slices are only three-dimensional (and in the -- pictures here look only two-dimensional or one-dimensional). Anyone set of slices captures only a one-sided view of the whole story. To see the entire picture one must either examine the dynamics of the geometry as it reveals itself in varied choices of the slicing or become accustomed to visualizing the spacetime geometry as a whole."},{"pageNumber":884,"pageContent":"§32.5. SPHERICAL COLLAPSE WITH PRESSURE §32.5. SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC COLLAPSE WITH INTERNAL PRESSURE FORCES 857 So far as the external gravitational field is concerned, the only difference between a freely collapsing star and a collapsing, spherically symmetric star with internal pressure is this: that the surfaces of the two stars move along different world lines in the exterior Schwarzschild geometry. Because the exterior geometry is the same in both cases, the qualitative aspects offreefall collapse as described in the last section can be carried over directly to the case of nonnegligible internal pressure. An important and fascinating question to ask is this: can large internal pressures in any way prevent a collapsing star from being crushed to infinite density by infinite tidal gravitational forces? From the Kruskal-Szekeres diagram of Figure 32.l,b, it is evident that, once a star has passed inside its gravitational radius (R < 2M), no internal pressures, regardless of how large they may be, can prevent the star's surface from being crushed in a singularity. The surface must move along a time-like world line, and all such world lines inside r = 2M hit r = O. Although there is no such theorem now available, one can reasonably conjecture that, if the surface of a spherical configuration is crushed in the r = 0 singularity, the entire interior must also be crushed. The details of the interior dynamics of a spherically symmetric collapsing star with pressure are not so well-understood as the exterior Schwarzschild dynamics. However, major advances in one's understanding of the interior dynamics are now being made by means of numerical computations and analytic analyses [see Misner (l969a) for a review]. In these computations and analyses, no new features (at least, no unexpected ones) have been encountered beyond those that occurred in the simple uniform-density, free-fall collapse of the last section.

GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE The effect of tidal forces on the body of a man falling into the r = 0 singularity: Stage 1: body resists deformation; stresses build up §32.6. THE FATE OF A MAN WHO FALLS INTO THE SINGULARITY AT r = 0 Consider the plight of an experimental astrophysicist who stands on the surface of a freely falling star as it collapses to R = O. As the collapse proceeds toward R = 0, the various parts of the astrophysicist's body experience different gravitational forces. His feet, which .are on the surface of the star, are attracted toward the star's center by an infinitely mounting gravita- tional force; while his head, which is farther away, is accelerated downward by a somewhat smaller, though ever rising force. The difference between the two acceler- ations (tidal force) mounts higher and higher as the collapse proceeds, finally be- coming infinite as R reaches zero. The astrophysicist's body, which cannot withstand such extreme forces, suffers unlimited stretching between head and foot as R drops to zero. But this is not all. Simultaneous with this head-to-foot stretching, the astrophysicist is pulled by the gravitational field into regions of spacetime with ever-decreasing circumferential area, 4'1Tr 2 . In order to accomplish this, tidal gravitational forces must compress the astrophysicist on all sides as they stretch him from head to foot. The circumferential compression is actually more extreme than the longitudinal stretch- ing; so the astrophysicist, in the limit R -+ 0, is crushed to zero volume and indefinitely extended length. The above discussion can be put on a mathematical footing as follows. There are three stages in the killing of the astrophysicist: (l) the early stage, when his body successfully resists the tidal forces; (2) the intermediate stage, when it is gradually succumbing; and (3) the final stage, when it has been completely over- whelmed. During the early stage, one can analyze the tidal forces by means of the equation of geodesic deviation, evaluated in the astrophysicist's orthonormal frame w T , w P , we, wJ, (see §31.2). In this frame, the nonvanishing components of the Riemann curvature tensor are given by equations (31.6): R TPTP = -2M/r 3 , RliJ,liJ, = 2M/r 3 , R···· - R···· - -Mjr 3 pBpB - p</Jp</J -. • (32.24a) The equation of geodesic deviation says that twofreefy moving particles, momentarily at rest in the astrophysicist's local inertial frame, and separated by the 3-vector must accelerate apart with a relative acceleration given by D21J/d-r2 = _RL,.l:.k = _R, ..• l:.k '.> 1'''1''.> ,TkT'.> = _R·,·,l:.k 1\"1''''.> •"},{"pageNumber":888,"pageContent":"§32.6.

From the form of equations (32.24), it is evident that the principal directions of the stress will be e p , eo, and e;p (i.e., in the e p ' eo, e;p basis, the stress tensor will be diagonal). The longitudinal component of the stress, at the astrophysicist's center of mass, can be evaluated as follows. A volume element of his body with mass dp., located at a height h above the center of mass (distance h measured along e p direction) would accelerate with a = (2M/r 3 )h away from the center of mass, if it were allowed to move freely. To prevent this acceleration, the astrophysicist's muscles must exert a force dF = a dp. = (2M/r 3 )h dp..

By the time the star is much smaller than its gravitational radius, the baryons of the astrophysicist's body are moving along geodesics; his muscles and bones have completely given way. In this final stage of collapse, the timelike geodesics are curves along which the Schwarzschild \"time\"-coordinate, t, is almost constant [ef the nar- rowing down of the light cones near r = 0 in Figure 32.l,a; also equation (31.2) in the limit r ~ 2M].

(32.26c) Review of spherical collapse This crushing of matter to infinite density by infinitely large tidal gravitational forces can Occur not only on the surface of the collapsing star, but also at any other point along the r = 0 singularity outside the surface of the star. Hence, any foolish rocketeer who ventures below the radius r = 2M of the external gravitational field is doomed to destruction.

REALISTIC GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE- AN OVERVIEW Instability, implosion, horizon, and singularity; these are the key stages in the spherical collapse of any star. Instability: The star, having exhausted its nuclear fuel, and having contracted slowly inward, begins to squeeze its pressure-sustaining electrons or photons onto its atomic nuclei; this softens the equation of state, which induces an instability [see, e.g., §§lO.l5 and 11.4 ofZel'dovich and Novikov (1971)"},{"pageNumber":890,"pageContent":"for details]. Implosion: Within a fraction of a second the instability develops into a full-scale implosion; for realistic density distributions, the stellar core falls rapidly inward on itself, and the outer envelopes trail along behind [see, e.g., the numerical calculations of Colgate and White (1966), Arnett (1966, 1967), May and White (1966), and Ivanova, Imshennik, and Nadezhin (1969)]. Horizon: In the idealized spherical case, the star's surface falls through its gravitational radius (\"horizon\"; end of communication with the exterior; point of no return). From the star's vantage point this happens after a finite, short lapse of proper time. But from an external vantage point the star requires infinite time to reach the horizon, though it becomes black exponentially rapidly in the process [e-folding time - M - 1 0-5(M/ M 0 ) sec]. The result is a \"black hole\", whose boundary is the horizon (gravitational radius), and whose interior can never communicate with the exterior. Singularity: From the star's interior vantage point, within a short proper time interval.1T - M - 1O-5(M/ Md sec after passing through the horizon, a singularity is reached (zero radius, infinite density, infinite tidal gravitational forces). Does this basic picture-instability, implosion, horizon, singularity-have any relevance for real stars? Might complications such as rotation, nonsphericity, mag- netic fields, and neutrino fluxes alter the qualitative picture? No, not for small initial perturbations from sphericity. Perturbation theory analyses described in Box 32.2 and exercise 32.10 show that realistic, almost-spherically symmetric collapse, like idealized collapse, is characterized by instability, implosion, horizon; and Penrose (1965b; see §34.6) proves that some type of singularity then follows. Highly nonspherical collapse is more poorly understood, of course. Nevertheless, a number of detailed calculations and precise theorems point with some confidence to two conclusions: (1) horizons (probably)form when and only when a mass M gets compacted into a region whose circumference in EVERY direction is e :s 4'1TM (Box 32.3); (2) the external gravitational field of a horizon (black hole), after all the \"dust\" and gravitational waves have cleared away, is almost certainly the Kerr-Newman generalization of the Schwarzschild geometry (Chapter 33). If so, then the external field is determined uniquely by the mass, charge, and angular momentum that went \"down the hole.\" (This nearly proved theorem carries the colloquial title \"A black hole has no hair.\") The interior of the horizon, and the endpoint (if any) of the collapse are very poorly understood today. The various possibilities will be reviewed in Chapter 34. That a singularity occurs one can state with much certainty, thanks to theorems of Penrose, Hawking, and Geroch. But whether all, only some, or none of the collapsing matter and fields ultimately encounter the singularity one does not know. -~~--~~-------- - §32.7.

GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE Box 32.2 COLLAPSE WITH SMALL NON-SPHERICAL PERTURBATIONS [based ondetailed calculations by Richard H. Price (1971, 1972a,b)]. A. Density Perturbations 1. When star begins to collapse, it possesses a small nonspherical \"lump\" in its density distri- bution. 2. As collapse proceeds, lump grows larger and larger [instability of collapse against small per- turbations-a phenomenon well known in Newtonian theory; see, e.g., Hunter (1967); Lin, Mestel, and Shu (1965)]. 3. The growing lump radiates gravitational waves. 4. Waves of short wavelength (A. ~ M), emitted from near horizon (r - 2M :S M), partly prop- agate to infinity and partly get backscattered by the \"background\" Schwarzschild curvature of spacetime. Backscattered waves propagate into horizon (surface of black hole; gravita- tional radius) formed by collapsing star. 5. Waves of long wavelength (A. > M), emitted from near horizon (r - 2M :S M), get fully backscattered by spacetime curvature; they never reach out beyond r - 3M; they end up propagating \"down the hole.\" 6. Is lump on star still there as star plunges through horizon, and does star thereby create a deformed (lumpy) horizon? Yes, according to calculations. 7. But external observers can only learn about existence of \"final lump\" by examining defor- mation (quadrupole moment) in final gravita- tional field. That final deformation in field does not and cannot propagate outward with infinite speed (no instantaneous \"action at a distance\"). It propagates with speed of light, in form of gravitational waves with near-infinite wave- length (infinite red shift from edge of horizon to any external radius). Deformation in final field, like any other wave of long wavelength, gets fully backscattered by curvature of spacetime at r :S 3M; it cannot reach external observers.

Result is de- struction of all deformation in external field and in horizon! 9. Final black hole is a Schwarzschild black hole! B. Perturbations in Angular Momentum 1. When star begins to collapse, it possesses a small, nonzero intrinsic angular momentum (\"spin\") S. 2. As collapse proceeds, S is conserved (except for a tiny, negligible change due to angular mo- mentum carried off by waves; that change is proportional to square of amplitude of waves, i.e., to square of amplitude of perturbations in star, i.e., to S2). 3. Consequently, external field always and every- where carries imprint of angular momentum S (on imprints, see Chapter 19). There is no need for that imprint to propagate outward from near horizon. Moreover, it could not so propa- gate even ifit tried, because of the conservation law for S (absence of dipole gravitational waves; see §§36.1 and 36.10). 4. Hence, the final external field is that of an undeformed, slowly rotating black hole: ds2 = _ (1 _ 2M) dt2 + dr 2 + r 2 d{22 r 1- 2M/r , .I Schwarzschild geometry ( 4S sin 8)( . 8 A ) d - r Sin ucp t. r 2 rotational imprint, see exercise 26.1; also Chapter 19.

Star possesses a magnetic field generated by currents in its interior, and an electric field due to an arbitrary internal charge distribution; and electromagnetic radiation is emitted by its hot matter. For simplicity, S is assumed zero. 2. Evolution of external electromagnetic field is similar to evolution of perturbations in external gravitational field. Distant observer can never learn \"final\" values of changeable quantities (magnetic dipole moment, electric dipole mo- ment, quadrupole moments, ... ). Final values try to propagate out from horizon, carried by electromagnetic waves of near-infinite wave- length. But they cannot get out: spacetime cur- vature reflects them back down the hole; and they superpose destructively with their outgoing counterparts, to produce zero net field. 3. By contrast with all other quantities, which are changeable, the electric monopole moment (total flux of electric field; equal to 4'1T times~ total electric charge) is conserved. It n~ver: changes from before star collapses, through the; collapse stage, into the quiescent black-hole stage. 4.

For proof of Price's theorem in the case of a scalar field, see exercise 32.1 O. 6. Price's theorem states that, as the nearly spheri- cal star collapses to form a black hole, all things that can be radiated (all multi poles 1 2 s) get radiated completely away-in part \"off to in- finity\"; in part \"down the hole\" (\"what is per- mitted is compulsory\").

[Ignore the instability of breakup into \"beads\"; see, e.g., Hunter (1967), Chandrasekhar (1968).] The radial collapse veloc- ity approaches the speed of light and the gravita- tional energy approaches the rest mass-energy only when the thread has become exceedingly thin, R.':S R crit - 1 exp (-1/4>-..).

Let the spheroid be highly Newtonian (r »> 2M) in its initial, momentary state of rest; and let it be slightly flattened (oblate). In Newto- nian theory, any homogeneous, nonrotating spheroid of dust remains homogeneous as it col- lapses; but its deformations grow [see, e.g., Lin, Mestel, and Shu (1965) for details]. Hence, the spheroid of interest implodes to form a pancake of infinite density but finite mass per unit surface area. The final kinetic energy of the dust particles is roughly equal to their final potential energy: 1 2 M IV - (812'17) M = mass of spheroid, e = circumference of final pancake. Consequently, so long as 812'17 > 2M, the collapse velocities remain much smaller than light, and the gravitational energy remains much smaller than the rest mass-energy. This means that for 8/2'17 > 2M, the Newtonian analysis is an excellent ap- proximation to general relativity all the way down to the pancake endpoint. Hence, no horizon can form, hardly any gravitational waves are emitted, and the whole story is exceedingly simple and fully Newtonian. However, since the pancake endpoint is not a singularity of spacetime (see the remarks at end of exercise 32.8), the evolution can proceed beyond it; and as e contracts to .':S4'17M, the evolu- To produce a black hole (horizon from which nothing can emerge), must one compact matter strongly in all three spatial dimensions, to circum- ferences 8 .':S 4'17M (quasispherical compaction); or C. is it sufficient to compact only in one or two di- mensions?

GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE Box 32.3 (continued) the pancake approaches zero, the vertical pull of gravity remains finite, but the pressure gradient caused by any finite pressure goes to infinity. Hence, pressure halts the collapse. Subsequently the rim of the pancake contracts toward the relativ- istic regime e j2'1T ~ 2M. In the collapse of a cylinder according to Newtonian theory, with a pressure-density relation p a: p Y, the gravitational acceleration a g and pressure-buoyancy accelera- tion a p vary as a g = -2AjR, Hence, for y > I (the most common realistic case) pressure halts the collapse, but for y < I it does not. Whether this is true also after the relativistic domain is reached, one does not yet know. Actually, the ability of pressure to halt the col- lapse is of no importance to the issue of black holes and horizons. The important thing is that in oblate collapse with final circumference e> 47TM, and also in prolate collapse with final thread length 1 > 2M, nO horizons are created. This, coupled with the omnipresent horizons in nearly spherical collapse (Box 32.2) suggests the following conjec- ture [Thorne (1972)]: Black holes with horizons form when and only when a mass M gets compacted into a region whose circumference in EVER Y direc- tion is e ~ 4'1TM.

P. S. LAPLACE (1798) §33,1, WHY \"BLACK HOLE\"? A dialog explaining why black holes deserve their name Sagredus. What is all this talk about \"black holes\"? When an external observer watches a star collapse, he sees it implode with ever-increasing speed, until the relativistic stage is reached. Then it appears to slow down and become \"frozen,\" just outside its horizon (gravitational radius). However long the observer waits, he never sees the star proceed further. How can one reasonably give the name \"black hole\" to such a frozen object, which never disappears from sight? Salvatius. Let us take the name \"black hole\" apart. Consider first the blackness. Surely nothing can be blacker than a black hole. The very redshift that makes the collapsing star appear to freeze also makes it darken and become black In the continuum approximation, where one ignores the discreteness of photons, the intensity of the radiation received by distant observers decreases exponentially as time passes, L a: exp ( - 1/3 V3M), with an exceedingly short e-folding time T = 3 V3M = (2.6 X 10- 5 sec)(MI M 0 ). Within a fraction of a second, the star is essentially black Discreteness of photons makes it even blacker. The number of photons emitted before the star crosses its horizon is finite, so the exponential decay cannot continue For a more detailed exposition of the foundations of \"black-hole physics,\" see DeWitt and DeWitt (1973)."},{"pageNumber":900,"pageContent":"§33.1. WHY THE NAME \"BLACK HOLE\"? 873 forever. Eventually-only 1O-3(M/ M 0 ) seconds after the star begins to dim' (see exercise 32.2)-the last photon that will ever get out reaches the distant observers. Thereafter nothing emerges. The star is not merely \"essentially black\"; it is \"absolutely black.\" Sagredus. Agreed. But it is the word \"hole\" that concerns me, not \"black.\" How can one possibly regard the name \"hole\" as appropriate for an object that hovers forever just outside its horizon. True, absence of light makes the object invisible. But couldn't one always see it by shining a flashlight onto its surface? And couldn't one always fly down to its surface in a rocket ship and scoop up a few of the star's baryons? After all, as seen from outside the baryons at its surface will never, never, never manage to fall into the horizon! Salvatius. Your argument sounds persuasive. To test its validity, examine the collapse of a spherically symmetric system, using the ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein diagram of Figure 33.1. Let a family of external observers shine their flash- lights onto the star's surface, as you have suggested. Let the surface of the star be carefully silvered so it reflects back all light that reaches it. Initially (low down in the spacetime diagram of Figure 33.1) the ingoing light beams Figure 33.1.

After an external observer, moving forward in time, has passed through the surface of last influence, he cannot interact with and influence the star before it plunges through the horizon. Thus, one can think of the surface of last influence as the \"birthpoint\" of the black hole. Before passing through this surface, the external observer can say his flashlight is probing the shape of a collapsing star; afterwards, he can regard his signals as probes of a black hole.

But there is a critical point-an in going radial null surface :?l- beyond which reflection is impossible. Photons emitted inward along '3l reach the star just as it is passing through its horizon. After reflection these photons .fly \"outward\" along the horizon, remaining forever at r = 2M. Other photons, emitted inward after the flashlight has passed through :?l, reach the surface of the star and are reflected only after the star is inside its horizon. Such photons can never return to the shining flashlights. Once inside the horizon, they can never escape. Thus, the total number of photons returned is finite and is subject to the same blackness decay law as is the intrinsic luminosity of the star. Moreover, if the observers do not turn on their flashlights until after they pass through the null surface:?l, they can never receive back any reflec- ted photons! Evidently, flashlights are of no help in seeing the \"frozen star.\" Sagredus. I cannot escape the logic of your argument. Nevertheless, seeing is not the only means of interacting with the frozen star. I have already suggested swooping down in a rocket ship and stealing a few baryons from its surface. Similarly, one might let matter fall radially inward onto the frozen star. When the matter hits the star's surface, its great kinetic energy of infall will be converted into heat and into outpouring radiation. Salvatius. Thus it might seem at first sight. But examine again Figure 33.1. No swooping rocket ship and no infalling matter can move inward faster than a light ray. Thus, if the decision to swoop is made after the ship passes through the surface :?l, the rocket ship has no possibility of reaching the star before it plunges through the horizon; the rocket and pilot cannot touch the star, sweep up baryons, and return to tell their tale. Similarly, infalling matter to the future of:?l can never hit the star's surface before passing through the horizon. The surface:?l is, in effect, a \"surface oflast influence.\" Once anybody or anything has passed through :?l, he or it has no possibility whatever of influencing or interacting with the star in any way before it plunges through the horizon. Thus,from a \"causal\" or \"interaction\" standpoint, the collapsing star becomes a hole in space at the surface :?l. This hole is not black at first. Radiation from the collapsing star still emerges after :?l because of finite light-propagation times, just as radiation still reaches us today from the hot big-bang explosion of the universe. But if an observer at radius r ~ 2M waits for a time 2r after passing through :?l (time for :?l to reach horizon, plus time for rays emitted at R - 3M to get back to observer), then he will see the newly formed hole begin to turn black; and within a time .1t - (10- 3 seconds)(M/ M 0 ) thereafter, it will be completely black. Sagredus. You have convinced me. For all practical purposes the phrase \"black hole\" is an excellent description. The alternative phrases \"frozen star\" and \"col- lapsed star,\" which I find in the pre-1969 physics literature, emphasize an optical-illusion aspect of the phenomenon.

THE GRAVITATIONAL AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS OF A BLACK HOLE The collapse of an electrically neutral star endowed with spherical symmetry pro- duces a spherical black hole with external gravitational field described by the Schwarzschild line element ds 2 = -(1 - 2M/r) dt 2 + dr 2 + r 2 (d()2 + sin 2 ()dcj>2). 1 - 2M/r (33.1 ) The surface of the black hole, i.e., the horizon, is located at r = 2M = (gravitational radius). Only the region on and outside the black hole's surface, r 22M, is relevant to external observers. Events inside the horizon can never influence the exterior. The gravitational collapse of a realistic star (nonspherical, collapse with small but nonzero net charge of one sign or the other) produces a black hole somewhat different from the simple Schwarzschild hole. For collapse with small charge and small asymmetries, perturbation-theory calculations (Box 32.2) predict a final black hole with external field determined entirely by the mass M, charge Q, and intrinsic angular momentum S of the collapsing star. For fully relativistic collapse, with large asym- metries and possibly a large charge, the final black hole (if one forms) is also characterized uniquely by M, Q, and S. This is the conclusion that strongly suggests itself in 1972 from a set of powerful theorems described in Box 33.1. Why M, Q, and S should be the complete governors of the final external field of the black hole, one can understand heuristically as follows. Of all quantities intrinsic to any isolated source of gravity and electromagnetism, only M, Q, and S possess (and are defined in terms of) unique, conserved imprints in the distant external fields of the source (conserved Gaussian flux integrals; see Box 19.1 and §20.2). When a star collapses to form a black hole, its distant external fields are fOrCed wmaintain unchanged the imprints of M, Q, and S. In effect, M, Q, and S provide anchors or constraints on the forms of the fields. Initially other constraints are produced by the distributions of mass, momentum, stress, charge, and current inside the star. But ultimately the star plunges through a horizon, cutting itself off causally from the external universe. (The nonpropagation of long-wavelength waves through curved spacetime plays a key role in this cutoff; see Box 32.2.) Subsequently, the only anchors remaining for the external fields are the conserved imprints of M, Q, and S. Consequently, the external fields quickly settle down into unique shapes corresponding to the given M, Q, and S.

BLACK HOLES Box 33.1 A BLACK HOLE HAS NO \"HAIR\" The following theorems come close to proving that the external gravitational and electromagnetic fields of a stationary black hole (a black hole that has settled down into its \"final\" state) are determined uniquely by the hole's mass M, charge Q, and intrin- sic angular momentum S-i.e., the black hole can have no \"hair\" (no other independent characteris- tics). For a detailed review, see Carter (1973). I.

Werner Israel (1967a, 1968): Any static black hole with event horizon of spherical topology has external fields determined uniquely by its mass M and charge Q; moreover, those exter- n~l fields are the Schwarzschild solution if Q = 0, and the Reissner-Nordstmm solution (exercises 31.8 and 32.1) if Q f. 0 (both special cases of Kerr-Newman; see §33.2). III. Brandon Carter (1970): \"All uncharged, sta- tionary, axially symmetric black holes with event horizons of spherical topology fall into disjoint families not deformable into each other. The black holes in each family have external gravitational fields determined uniquely by two parameters: the mass M and the angular momentum S.\" (Note: the \"Kerr solutions\"-i.e., \"Kerr-Newman\" with Q = 0 -form one such family; it is very likely that there are no others, but this has not been proved as of December 1972. It is also likely that Carter's theorem can be extended to the case with charge; but this has also not yet been done.) IV. Conclusions made by combining all three the- orems: (a) All stationary black holes are axially sym- metric. (b) All static (nonrotating) black holes are characterized uniquely by M and Q, and hllve the Reissner-Nordstmm form. (c) All uncharged, rotating black holes fall . into distinct and disjoint families, with each black hole in a given family charac- terized uniquely by M and S. The Kerr solutions form one such family. There may well be no other family. V. Remarks and Caveats: (a) The above statements of the theorems are all somewhat heuristic. Each theorem makes several highly technical assump- tions, not stated here, about the global properties of spacetime. These assump- tions seem physically reasonable and in- nocuous, but they might not be. (b) Progress in black-hole physics is so rapid that, by the time this book is published, there may well exist theorems more pow- erful than the above, which really prove that \"a black hole has no hair.\" (c) For insight into the techniques of \"global geometry\" used in proving the above the- orems and others like them, see Chapter 34; for greater detail see the forthcoming book by Hawking and Ellis (1973).

And, of course, the external fields must then readjust themselves to the new M and S. But the process will quickly converge, producing a black hole with specific final values of M, Q, and S and with external fields determined uniquely by those values. The problem of calculating the external fields for given M, Q, and S and their given imprints, is analogous to the problem of Plateau-to calculate the shape of a soap film anchored to a wire of given shape.* One calculates the shape of the soap film by seeking a surface of minimum area spanning the bent wire. The condition of minimum area leads to a differential equation describing the soap film, which must be solved subject to the constraint imposed by the shape of the wire. To calculate the external fields of a black hole, one can extremize the \"action integral\" f(&l + E) -v:::g d 4 x for interacting gravitational and electromagnetic fields (see Chapter 21) subject to the anchored-down imprints of M, Q, and S at radial infinity, and subject to the existence of a physically nonsingular horizon (no infinite curvature at horizon!). Extremizing the action is equivalent to solving the coupled Einstein-Maxwell field equations subject to the constraints imprinted by M, Q, and S. and the existence of the horizon. The derivation of the solution and the proof of its uniqueness are much too complex to be given here. (See references cited in Box 33.1.)

Symmetries (§33.4): The metric coefficients in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates are independent of t and </>, and in Kerr coordinates are independent of V and ;Po Thus the spacetime geometry is \"time-independent\" (stationary) and ax- - ially symmetric. The \"Killing vectors\" (§25.2) associated with these two sym- metries are (0/ot)r,8,¢ = (0/0 V)r,8,¢ and (0 /o</> )t,r, 8 = (0 /o;P)v,r, 8· B. Dragging of inertial frames and static limit (§33.4): 1. The \"dragging of inertial frames\" by the black hole's angular momentum produces a precession of gyroscopes relative to distant stars. By this preces- sion one defines and measures the an- gular momentum of the black hole (see §§19.2 and 19.3). 2. The dragging becomes more and more extreme the nearer one approaches the horizon of the black hole. Before the horizon is reached, at a surface de- scribed by -- --~~ - r = r o (8) = M + YM2 _ Q2 _ a 2 cos 2 8, (7) the dragging becomes so extreme that no observer can possibly remain at rest there (i.e., be \"static\") relative to the distant stars. At and inside this surface (called the \"static limit\"), all observers with fixed rand 8 must orbit the black hole in the same direction in which the hole rotates: a sin8 - VL1 >----_---=._-- (r 2 + a 2 ) sin 8 - VL1a sin 2 8 (~ 0 for a = S/ M > 0 and r ::::;; r o ). No matter how hard an observer, at fixed (r,8) inside the static limit, blasts his rocket engines, he can never lialt his angular motion relative to the distant stars. 3. The mathematical foundation for the above statement is this: world lines of the form (r, 8, </» = constant [tangent vector ex a/at = \"Killing vector in time direction\"] change from being timelike outside the static limit to being space- like inside it. Therefore, on and inside the static limit, no observer can remain at rest. C. Horizon (§33.4): 1. The horizon is located at r = r+ = M + yM2 - Q2 - a 2 . (8) 2. As with the Schwarzschild horizon of a nonrotating black hole, so also here, particles and photons can fall inward through the horizon; but no particle or"},{"pageNumber":907,"pageContent":"880 33. BLACK HOLES Box 33.2 (continued) photon can emerge outward through it. 3. The horizon is \"generated\" by outgoing null geodesics (outgoing photon world lines). D. Ergosphere (§33.4): 1. The \"ergosphere\" is the region of space- time between the horizon and the static limit. It plays a fundamental role in the physics of black holes (Box 33.3; §33.7). 2. The static limit and the horizon touch at the point where they are cut by the axis of rotation of the black hole (8 ::: 0, '17); they are well-separated else- where with the static limit outside the horizon, unless a::: ° (no rotation). When a ::: 0, the static limit and hori- zon coincide; there is no dragging of inertial frames; there is no ergosphere. Qualitative representation of horizon, ergosphere, and static limit [adapted from Ruffini and Wheeler (l97Ib»). E. Singularity in Boyer-Lindquist coordi- nates: 1. For a nonrotating black hole, the Schwarzschild coordinates become sin- gular at the horizon. One manifestation of the singularity is the infinite amount of coordinate time required for any particle or photon to fall inward through the horizon, {-+ 00 as r -+ 2M. One way to remove the sin- gularity (Eddington-Finkelstein way) is to replace t by a null coordinate V::: t + r + 2Mlnlr/2M - 11 attached to infalling photons [so (0/or)V,8,¢ is vector tangent to photon world lines]. 2. For a rotating black hole, the Boyer- Lindquist coordinates, being generali- zations of the Schwarzschild coordi- nates, are also singular at the horizon. It requires an infinite coordinate time for any particle or photon to fall in- ward through the horizon, t -+ 00 as r -+ r +. But that is not all. The drag- ging of inertial frames forces particles and photons near the horizon to orbit the black hole with .[J = dcp/dt > 0. Consequently, for a particle falling through the horizon (r -+ r +), just as t -+ 00, so also cp -+ 00 (infinite twisting of world lines around horizon). 3. To remove the coordinate singularity, one must perform an infinite compres- sion of coordinate time, and an infinite untwisting in the neighborhood of the horizon. Kerr coordinates achieve this by replacing t with a null coordinate V, and cp with an untwisted angular coor- dinate ;p: dV::: dt + (r 2 + a 2 )(dr/ .1), d;P ::: dcp + a(dr/ .1). Both of the new coordinates are at- tached to the world lines of a particular family of infalling photons; (0/or)V,8,¢ is the field of vectors tangent to the world lines of this family of photons (ingoing principal null congruence; §33.6)."},{"pageNumber":908,"pageContent":"§33.2. PRINCIPAL FEATURES OF HOLES F. Spacetime diagram: 1. A spacetime diagram in Kerr coordi- nates looks much like an Eddington- Finkelstein diagram for the Schwarzs- child geometry. In both cases, one plots the surfaces of constant V not as hori- zontal planes, but as \"backward light cones\" (\"45-degree surfaces\"), because they are generated by the world lines of ingoing photons. Equivalently, one plots surfaces of constant 7 = V - r as horizontal planes. 2. The key differences between a Kerr diagram and an Eddington-Finkelstein diagram are: (a) Because the Kerr- Newman geometry is not spherical, a Kerr diagram with one rotational de- gree of freedom suppressed loses infor- mation about the geometry. Kerr dia- grams are usually made for the equatorial \"plane,\" 8 = 7T/2. (b) Just as the horizon pulls the light cones inward, so the dragging of inertial frames tilts the light cones in the direction of in- creasing ;p, for a > 0 and r = constant. (c) The ingoing edge of a light cone (dr/dV-=--oo) does not tilt toward in- creasing ;P; the transformation from Boyer-Lindquist coordinates to Kerr coordinates untwists the tilt with de- creasing r, which would otherwise be produced by \"frame dragging.\" 3. The shapes of the light cones reveal the special features of the static limit and horizon. At the static limit, a vertical world line [r, 8,;P constant; (0/0 V)r,e,¢\" = (%t)r.e,¢ = tangent vector] lies on the light cone. At the horizon the light cones tilts fully inward, except for a single line of tangency to the horizon. Notice that the line of tangency has d<;/ dV = a/(r + 2 + a 2 ) i= O. Equiva- lently, the outgoing null geodesics, which generate the horizon, twist about it (\"barber-pole-twist\")-yet another manifestation of the dragging of inertial frames. 881 Kerr diagram for equatorial slice (6 = 'IT /2) through the spacetime of an \"extreme Kerr\" black hole (Q = O. a = M).

The Kerr diagram, like the Eddington- Finkelstein diagram,- describes infall through the horizon in a faithful, non- singular way. 5. [The term \"Kerr diagram\" is a misno- mer. Kerr has not published such dia- grams himself, though nowadays others construct such diagrams using his coor- dinate system. Penrose is the originator and greatest exploiter of such diagrams (see, e.g., Penrose, 1969). But several other types of diagrams bear Penrose's name, so it would be confusing to name them all after him.] G. Maximal analytic extension of Kerr-New- man geometry: 1. When one abstracts the Schwarzschild geometry away from all sources (Chap- ter 31), one discovers that it describes an expanding and recontracting bridge, connecting two different universes. But in the context of black holes, only half of the Schwarzschild geometry (regions I and II) is relevant. The other half (regions III and IV) gets fully replaced by the interior of the star that collapsed to form the black hole. Because only a Surface of collapsing star part of the Schwarzschild geometry comes into play, ingoing Eddington- Finkelstein coordinates-which de- scribe I and II well, but III and IV badly-are well-suited to black-hole physics. 2. Similarly, when one abstracts the Kerr- Newman geometry away from all sour- ces, one discovers that it describes a much larger, and more complex space- time manifold than one might ever have suspected. This \"maximum ana- lytic extension\" of the Kerr-Newman geometry has been analyzed in de- tail by Boyer and Lindquist (1967) and by Carter (l966a, 1968a). But it is totally irrelevant to the subject of black holes, for two reasons. First, as with Schwarzschild, the star that collapsed to form the black hole replaces most of the inward extension of the Kerr-Newman manifold. Second, even outside the star, the Kerr-Newman geometry does not properly represent the true geometry at early times. At early times the star has not got far down the road to collapse. Gravitational moments of the star arise from mountains or prominences or tur- bulence or other_ particularities that have not yet gone into the meat grinder. The geometry departs from flatness (1) by a term that varies for large distances as mass divided by distance, and (2) by another term that varies as angular mo- mentum divided by the square of the distance and multiplied by a spherical harmonic of order one, but also (3) by higher-order terms proportional to higher-order mass moments multiplied by higher spherical harmonics. These higher-order terms normally will devi- ate at early times from the correspond- ing terms in the mathematical analysis of the Kerr-Newman geometry- though the deviations will die out as time passes. For a system endowed with spherical symmetry, no such higher- order terms do occur or can occur. Therefore the geometry outside is"},{"pageNumber":910,"pageContent":"§33.2. PRINCIPAL FEATURES OF HOLES Schwarzschild in character at all stages of the collapse. However, when the sys- tem lacks spherical symmetry, the ge- ometry outside initially departs from Kerr-Newman character. Only well after the collapse occurs (asymptotic future), and in the region at and outside the hori- zon, is the Kerr-Newman geometry a faithful descriptor of a black hole. This region is described in a nonsingular manner by Kerr coordinates and Kerr diagrams; and it is the only region that this book will explore. H. Test-particle orbits See §§33.5-33.8 and Box 33.5.

By searching for observable phenomena as- sociated with these processes, astronomers have a good chance of discovering the first black hole sometime during the 1970's. This box lists some possible astrophysical processes, and a few rele- vant references. 883 These reveal that Q = charge of black hole, q)Jl = Qa = magnetic dipole moment of black hole. B. Notice that the gyromagnetic ratio, y = (magnetic moment)/(angular momentum), is equal to Q/ M = (charge/mass), just as for an electron! . C. Notice that the value of the magnetic mo- ment, like all other features of the black hole, is determined uniquely by the hole's mass, charge, and angular momentum: q)Jl = QS/ M. This illustrates the theorem (Box 33.1) that a black hole has no \"hair.\" D. Other electric and magnetic moments are nonzero, but are determined uniquely by M, S, and Q. E. Near the black hole, the curvature of spacetime deforms the electric and mag- netic fields produced by the charged, rota- ting black hole. For a mathematical de- scription of this deformed field, see Cohen and Wald (1971); for a diagrammatic rep- resentation, Hanni and Ruffini (1973). I. Mechanisms of Formation A. \"Direct, in isolation\": A massive star(M > 3M 0 ) collapses, almost spherically, pr;- ducing a collapsed neutron-star core that is too massive to support itself against gravity.

Some acquire energy and move out into a halo. Others lose energy and make a more compact cluster. This process of segregation con- tinues. The cluster becomes so compact that collisions ensue and gas is driven off. The gas moves toward the center of the gravitational potential well. Out of it new stars form. The process continues. Eventu- ally star-star collisions may become suffi- ciently energetic and inelastic that the cen- ters of the colliding stars coalesce. In this way supermassive objects may be built up and may evolve. Ultimately (1) many \"small\" stars may collapse to form \"small\" . black holes (M - M 0 ); (2) one or more supermassive stars may collapse to form huge black holes (M- 10 4 M 0 to 10 9 M 0 ); (3) the entire conglomerate of stars and gas and holes may become so dense that it collapses to form a single gigantic hole. [Sanders (1970), Spitzer (1971), Lynden- Bell (1967, 1969), Colgate (1967), §§24.5, 24.6, 25.7 of this book.] D. \"Primordially\": Perturbations in the initial density distribution of the expanding uni- verse may produce collapse, resulting in \"primordial black holes.\" Those holes would subsequently grow by accretion of radiation and matter. By today all such holes might have grown into enormous objects [M - 10 17 M 0 ; Zel'dovich and Novikov (1966)]; but some of them might have avoided such growth and might be as small as 10- 5 grams [Hawking (1971a)]. II. How many black holes are there in our galaxy today? Peebles (1972) has given an excellent review of this issue and of prospects for finding black holes in the near future. He says \"a good fraction of the mass of the disc of our galaxy was deposited [long ago] in stars capable of collapsing to black holes .... The indication is that the galaxy's disk may contain on the order of 10 9 black holes.\" III. \"Live\" black holes versus \"dead\" black holes A. A Schwarzschild black hole is \"dead\" in the sense that one can never extract from it any of its mass-energy. One aspect of this \"deadness\" -the fact that a Schwarzs- child black hole is stable against small perturbations-is essential (1) to the iden- tification of a black hole with the ultimate \"ground state\" of a large mass, and (2) to any assertion that general relativity theory predicts the possible existence of black holes. [For a proof of stability see Vish- veshwara (1970). The problem was formu- lated, and most of the necessary tech- niques developed, by Regge and Wheeler (1957), with essential contributions also by Zerilli (1970a).] Thus a small pulse ofgravi- tational (or other) radiation impinging on a Schwarzschild black hole does not initi- ate a transition of the black hole into a very different object or state. B. A Kerr-Newman black hole-which is ro- tating or charged or both-is not dead. The rotational and electromagnetic contri- butions to the mass-energy can be extracted. (See §§33.7 and 33.8 for mathematical de- tails.) Thus, such black holes are \"live\"; they can inject energy into their sUITound- -ings. By a suitable arrangement of external apparatus, one can trigger an exponen- tially growing energy release [Press and Teukolsky (1972).] But for a perturbed"},{"pageNumber":912,"pageContent":"§33.2. PRINCIPAL FEATURES OF HOLES black hole in isolation, the release is al- ways \"controlled\" and damped; i.e., Kerr black holes are stable in any classical con- text [Press and Teukolsky (1973)]. C. Most objects (massive stars; galactic nu- clei; ... ) that can collapse to form black holes have so much angular momentum that the holes they produce should be \"very live\" (a nearly equal to M; S nearly equal to M2). [Bardeen (1970a).] D. By contrast, it is quite probable (but far from certain) that no black hole in the universe has substantial charge-i.e., that all black holes have Q < M. A black hole with Q - M (say, Q > 0 for concreteness) would exert attractive electrostatic forces on electrons, and repulsive electrostatic forces on protons, that are larger than the hole's gravitational pull by the factor (electrostatic force) = eQ _!.... _10 20 (gravitational force) JlM Jl . Here e is the electron charge and Jl is the electron (or proton) mass. Such huge differential forces are likely to pull in enough charge from outside the hole to neutralize it. E. But one has learned from the \"unipolar induction process\" for neutron stars [Gold- reich and Julian (1968)] that charge neu- tralization can sometimes be circum- vented. Whether any black-hole process can possibly prevent neutralization one does not know in 1972. IV. Interaction of a black hole with its environ- ment A. Gravitational pull: A black hole exerts a gravitational pull on surrounding matter and stars. The pull is indistinguishable, at radii r ~ M, from the pull of a star with the same mass. B. Accretion and emission of x-rays and y- rays: Gas surrounding a black hole gets 885 pulled inward and is heated by adiabatic compression, by shock waves, by turbu- lence, by viscosity, etc. Before it reaches the horizon, the gas may become so hot that it emits a large flux of x-rays and perhaps even y-rays. Thus, accreting mat- ter can convert a black hole into a glowing \"white\" body [for a review of the litera- ture, see Novikov and Thorne (1973)]. Accretion from a nonrotating gas cloud tends to decrease the angular momentum of a black hole [preferential accretion of particles with \"negative\" angular momen- tum; Doroshkevich (1966), Godfrey (1970a)]. But the gas surrounding a hole is likely to be rotating in the same direc- tion as the hole itself, and to maintain S - M2 [more precisely, S;:::; 0.998M2; Thorne (1973b)]. C. A lump of matter (an \"asteroid\" or a \"planet\" or a star) falling into a black hole should emit a burst of gravitational waves as it falls. The total energy radiated is E - 0.0 lJl(Jl/ M), where Jl is the mass of the object. [Zerilli (1970b); Davis, Ruffini, Press, and Price (1971); Figure 36.2 of this book.] D. An object in a stable orbit around a black hole should spiral slowly inward because of loss of energy through gravitational ra- diation, until it reaches the most tightly bound, stable circular orbit. It should then fall quickly into the hole, emitting a \"last- gasp burst\" of waves. The total energy radiated during the slow inward spiral is equal to the binding energy of the last stable circular orbit: Eradiated = Jl - Elastorbit = (0.0572 Jl for Schwarzschild hole, 0.4235Jl for Kerr hole with S = M2, Q = O. Here Jl is the rest mass of the captured object. [Box 33.5.] The total energy in the last-gasp burst is E - O.OlJl(Jl/ M) if Jl < M. [Fig. 36.2.]"},{"pageNumber":913,"pageContent":"886 33. BLACK HOLES Box 33.3 (continued) E. When matter falls down a black hole, it can excite the hole's external spacetime geometry into vibration. The vibrations are gradually converted into gravitational waves, some of which escape, others go down the hole. [Press(197l, Goebel (1972).] These vibrations are analogous to an \"incipient gravitational geon\" [Wheeler (1962); Christodoulou (1971) ]-except that for a vibrating black hole the background Kerr geometry holds the vibration energy together (prevents it from propagating away immediately), whereas in a geon it is curvature produced by the \"vibration energy\" itself that prevents disruption. F. By a non-Newtonian, induction-zone (i.e., nonradiative) gravitational interaction, a black hole gradually transfers its angular momentum to any non-axially-symmetric, nearby distribution of matter or fields. [Hawking (1972a); Ipser (1971), Press (1972), Hawking and Hartle (1972).] G. A star or planet falling into a large black hole will get torn apart by tidal gravita- tional forces. If the tearing occurs near but outside the horizon, it may eject a blob of stellar matter that goes out with relativis- tic velocity (\"tube-of-toothpaste effect\"). Moreover, the outgoing jet may extract a substantial amount of rotational energy from the hole's ergosphere-i.e., the hole might throw it off with a rest mass plus kinetic energy in excess of the rest mass of the original in falling object. [Wheeler (197ld); §§33.7 and 33.8.] H. The magnetic field lines of a charged black hole may be anchored to surrounding plasma, may get wound up as the hole rotates, and may shake, twitch, and excite the plasma. V. Collisions between black holes A. Two black holes can collide and coalesce; but there is no way to blast a black hole apart into several black holes [Hawking (1972a); exercise 34.4]. B. When two black holes collide and coalesce, the surface area of the final black hole must exceed the sum of the surface areas of the two initial black holes (\"second law of black-hole dynamics\"; Hawking (197la,b); Box 33.4; §34.5). This constraint places an upper limit on the amount of gravitational radiation emitted in the colli- sion. For example, if all three holes are of the Schwarzschild variety and the two ini- tial holes have equal masses M12, then 4'1T(2M final )2 ~ 4'1T[2(MI2)j2 + 4'1T[2(MI2)]2, M final ~ M I Vi, so the energy radiated is Eradiated ::::;; M - MI Vi = 0.293M VI. Where and how to search for a black hole [For a detailed review, see Peebles (1971)]: A. When it forms, by the burst or bursts of gravitational radiation given off during formation [Figure 24.3]. B. In a binary star system: black-hole compo- nent optically invisible, but may emit x-rays and y-rays due to accretion; visible component shows telltale Doppler shifts [Hoyle, Fowler, Burbidge, and Burbidge (1964); Zel'dovich and Guseynov (1965); Trimble and Thorne (1969); Pringle and Rees (1972); Shakura and Sunyaev (1973)]. The velocity of the visible compo- nent and the period give information on the mass of the invisible component. If"},{"pageNumber":914,"pageContent":"§33.2. PRINCIPAL FEATURES OF HOLES mass of this invisible component is four solar masses or more, it cannot be an ordi- nary star, because an ordinary star of that mass would have (4)3 = 64 times the lu- minosity of the sun. Neither can it be a white dwarf or a neutron star because ei- ther object, so heavy, would instantly col- lapse to a black hole. Therefore, it is attrac- tive-though not necessarily compelling [see Trimble and Thorne (1969)]-to iden- tify the invisible object as a black hole. C. [But one must not expect to see any no- ticeable gravitational lens action from a black hole in a binary system: if it taxed the abilities of astronomers for decades to see the black disc of Mercury, 4,800 km in diameter, swim across the great face of the sun, little hope there is to see a black hole with an effective radius of only -3 km, enormously more remote, occult a companion star. Significant lens action re- quires that the lens (black hole) be sepa- rated by a normal interstellar distance from the star it focuses; whence the impact parameter of the focused rays is more than a stellar radius, so the lens ,action is not more than that of a normal star. Moreover, Box 33.4 THE LAWS OF BLACK-HOLE DYNAMICS 887 even with 10 9 black holes in the galaxy, only one per year would pass directly be- . tween the Earth and a more distant star, and produce significant lens action (Refsdal, 1964). Chance of watching the right spot on the sky at the right time with a sufficiently strong telescope: nil!] D. At the center of a globular cluster, where a black hole may settle down, attract nor- mal stars to its vicinity, and thereby pro- duce a cusp in the distribution of light from the cluster. [Cameron and Truran (1971), Peebles (1971).] E. In the nucleus of a galaxy, including even the Milky Way, where a single huge black hole (M - 10 4 to 10 8 M 0 ) might sit as an end-product of earlier activity of the ga- lactic nucleus. Such a hole will emit gravi- tational waves, light, and radio waves as it accretes matter. Much of the light may be converted into infrared radiation by surrounding dust. The black hole may also produce jets and other nuclear activity. [Lynden-Bell (1969), Lynden-Bell' and Rees (1971), Wheeler (197ld), Peebles (1971).] The black-hole processes described in Box 33.3 are governed by the standard laws of physics: general relativity, plus Maxwell electrodynamics, plus hydrodynamic, quantum mechanical, and other laws for the physics of matter and radiation. From these standard laws of physics, one can derive certain \"rules\" or \"constraints,\" which all black-hole processes must satisfy. Those rules have a power, elegance, and simplicity that rival and resemble the power, elegance, and simplicity of the laws of thermodynamics. Therefore, they have been given the analogous name \"the laws of black-hole dynamics\" (Israel 1971). This box states two of the laws of black-hole"},{"pageNumber":915,"pageContent":"888 33. BLACK HOLES Box 33.4 (continued) dynamics and some of their ramifications. Two additional laws, not discussed here, have been formulated by Bardeen. Carter, and Hawking (1973). I. The First and Second Laws of Black-Hole Dynamics. A. The first law. 1. Like the first law of thermodynamics, the first law of black-hole dynamics is the standard law of conservation of total energy, supplemented by the laws of conservation of total momentum, angular momentum, and charge. For detailed discussions of these conservation laws, see Box 19.1 and Chapter 20. 2. Specialized to the case where matter falls down a black hole and gravita- tional waves pour out, the first law takes the form depicted and discussed near the end of Box 19.1. 3. Specialized to the case of infalling electric charge, the first law says that the total charge Q of a black hole, as measured by the electric flux emerging from it, changes by an amount equal to the total charge that falls down the hole, .::1Q = qthatfalls in' 4. Specialized to the case where two black holes collide and coalesce (example given in Box 33.3), the first law says: (a) Let PI a.nd P 2 be the 4-momenta of the two black holes as measured gravitationally, when they are so well-separated that they have negligible influence on each other. (PI and P 2 are 4-vectors in the surrounding asymptotically flat spacetime.) Simi- larly, let J I and J 2 be their total angular-momentum tensors (not intrinsic angular-momentum vectors!) relative to some arbitrarily chosen origin of coordinates, tj' 0' in the surrounding asymptotically flat spacetime (J I and J 2 contain orbital angular momentum, as well as intrinsic angular mo- mentum; see Box 5.6.). (b) Let P 3 and J 3 be the similar total4-momentum and angular momentum of the final black hole. (c) Let P r and J r be the total4-momentum and angular momentum radiated as gravitational waves during the collision and coalescence. Then [Note: to calculate the mass and intrinsic angular momentum of the final black hole from a knowledge of P 3 and J 3 , follow the prescription of Box 5.6.

When anything falls down a black hole, or when several black holes collide and coalesce or collide and scatter, or in any other process whatsoever involv- ing black holes, the sum of the surface areas (or squares of \"irreducible masses\"-see equation 3 below) of all black holes involved can never decrease.

Its surface area, at any moment of time, is given in terms of its momentary mass M, charge Q, and intrinsic angular momentum per unit mass a _ Sj M by A = 4'17[r+ 2 + a 2 ] = 4'17[(M + yM2 - Q2 - a 2 )2 + a 2 ] (1) (exercise 33.12). Interaction with matter and fields may change M, Q, and a in various ways; M can even be decreased-i.e., energy can be extracted from the black hole! [Penrose (1969); §33.7.] But whatever may be the changes, they can never reduce the surface area A. Moreover, if any change in M, Q, and a ever increases the surface area, no future process can ever reduce it back to its initial value. B. Thus, one can classify black-hole processes into two groups. 1. Reversible transformations change M, Q, or a or any set thereof, while leaving the surface area ~hed. They can be reversed, bringing the black .JJ,ole back to its original state. 2. Irreve~~lble transformations change M, Q, or a or any set thereof, and increase the surface area in the process. Such a transformation can never be reversed. The black hole can never be brought back to its original state after an irreversible transformation. C. Examples of reversible transformations and of irreversible transformations induced by infalling particles are presented in §§33.7 and 33.8. D. The r~ersible extraction of charge and angular momentum from a black hole ~----l--~--7Qeecc:nrease in Q and a holding A fixed) necessarily reduces the black hole's mass (energy extraction!).

Since a black hole's irreducible mass is proportional to the square root of its surface area, one can restate the second law of black-hole dynamics as follows: In black-hole processes the sum of the squares of the irreducible masses of all black holes involved can never decrease. (33.6) The metric far outside a black hole: imprints of mass and angular momentum §33.3. MASS, ANGULAR MOMENTUM, CHARGE, AND MAGNETIC MOMENT It is instructive to verify that the constants M, Q, and a, which appear in equations (33.2)-(33.5) for the Kerr-Newman geometry and electromagnetic field, are actually the black hole's mass, charge, and angular momentum per unit mass, as claimed above. Mass and angular momentum are defined by their imprints on the spacetime geometry far from the black hole. Therefore, to calculate the mass and angular momentum, one can expand the line element (33.2) in powers of l/r and examine the leading terms: ds 2 = - [ 1 - _2~_~ 0 (}2)] dt 2 - [4a r M sin 2 8 + 0 (}2)] dt d</> + [ 1 + 0 ( ~ )] [dr 2 + r 2 (d8 2 + sin 2 8 d</>2)]. The rest of this chapter is Track 2. To be prepared for it, one needs to have covered the Track-2 part of Chapter 32 (gravitational collapse). In reading it, one will be helped greatly by Chapter 25 (orbits in Schwarzschild geometry). The rest of this chapter is needed as preparation for Chapter 34 (singularities and global methods). The examination is facilitated by transforming to asymptotically Lorentz coordi- nates-x = r sin 8 cos </>, y = r sin 8 sin </>, z = r cos 8: ds 2 = - [ 1- 2~ + 0 (}2 )] dt 2 - [4~~ + 0 (r 14 ) ] [x dy - Y dx] (33.6') + [1 + oe )][dx 2 + di + dz 2 ]. Direct comparison with the \"standard form\" [equation (19.13)] of the metric far from a stationary rotating source reveals that (1) the parameter M is, indeed, the mass of the black hole; and (2) the intrinsic angular momentum vector of the black hole IS S = (aM) %z = (aM).

Just as the rotation of the black hole produces a magnetic field, so it also produces nonspherical deformations in the gravitational field of the black hole [see Hernandez (1967) for quantitative discussion].

SYMMETRIES AND FRAME DRAGGING (2Mr - Q2)a sin 2 8 p2 893 (33.l2a) (33.l2b) (33.l2c) Since Killing vectors are geometric propert'ies of spacetime, with existence inde- pendent of any and all coordinate systems, their scalar products also have coor- dinate-free meaning. It so happens (not by chance, but by careful choice of coordi- nates!) that the Boyer-Lindquist metric components gtt' gt¢' andg¢¢ are equal to these coordinate-independent scalar products. Thus gtt' gt¢' and g¢¢ can be thought of as three scalar fields which embody information about the symmetries of spacetime. By contrast, the metric coefficients grr = p2 l;:j and g88 = p2 carry no information at all about the symmetries. * They depend, for their existence and values, on the specific Boyer-Lindquist choice of coordinates. Any observer who moves along a world line of constant (r, 8) with uniform angular velocity sees an unchanging spacetime geometry in his neighborhood. Hence, such an observer can be thought of as \"stationary\" relative to the local geometry. If and only if his angular velocity is zero, that is, if and only if he moves along a world line of constant (r, 8, </», will he also be \"static\" relative to the black hole's asymptotic Lorentz frame (i.e., relative to the \"distant stars\"). The precise definition of \"angular velocity relative to the asymptotic rest frame\" -or simply \"angular velocity\" -is Stationary observers Static observers Angular velocity and 4-velocity of a stationary observer (33.l3a) (33.l3b) (see exercise 33.2).

The stationary observers at given r,8 cannot have any and every angular velocity. Only those values of [J are allowed for which the 4-velocity u lies inside the future light cone-i.e., for which \"This is not quite true.

The following features of these limits are noteworthy. (I) Far from the black hole, one has rQ rnin = -I and rQ max = +1, corresponding to the standard limits imposed by the speed oflight in flat spacetime. (2) With decreasing radius, Q rnin increases (\"dragging of inertial frames\"). Finally, when gtt reaches zero, i.e., at (33.17) Q min becomes zero. At and inside this surface, all stationary observers must orbit the black hole with positive angular velocity. Thus, static observers exist outside and only outside I' = 1'0(8). For this reason I' = 1'0(8) is called the \"static limit\"; see Box 33.2. (3) As one moves through the static limit into the \"ergosphere,\" one sees the allowed range of angular velocities become ever more positive (ever more \"frame dragging\"). At the same time, one sees the allowed range narrow down, until finally, at the horizon (33.18) EXERCISES the limits Q min and Q max coalesce (w 2 = gtt/g</></». Thus, at the horizon there are no stationary observers. All timelike world lines point inward. There is no escape from the black hole's \"pull.\" Further features of stationary observers and \"frame dragging\" are explored in the exercises. Exercise 33.1.

OBSERVATIONS OF ANGULAR VELOCITY An observer, far from a black hole and at rest in the hole's asymptotic Lorentz frame, watches (with his eyes) as a particle moves along a stationary (nongeodesic) orbit near the black hole. Let II = dep/dt be the particle's angular velocity, as defined and discussed above. The distant observer uses his stopwatch to measure the time required for the particle to make one complete circuit around the black hole (one complete circuit relative to the distant observer himself; i.e., relative to the hole's asymptotic Lorentz frame). (a) Show that the circuit time measured is 2'lT /ll. Thus, II can be regarded as the particle's \"angular velocity as measured from infinity.\" (b) Let the observer moving with the particle measure its circuit time relative to the asymptotic Lorentz frame, using his eyes and a stopwatch he carries.

LOCALLY NONROTATING OBSERVERS (Bardeen 1970b) (a) Place a rigid, circular mirror (\"ring mirror\") at fixed (r, 0) around a black hole. Let an observer at (r,O) with angular velocity II emit a flash of light. Some of the photons will get caught by the mirror and will skim along its surface, circumnavigating the black hole in the positive-ep direction. Others will get caught and will skim along in the negative-ep direction. Show that the observer will receive back the photons from both directions simulta- neously only if his angular velocity is II = w(r, 0) = expression (33.16). Thus in this case, and only in this case, can the observer regard the +ep and -ep directions as equivalent in terms of local geometry. Put differently, in this case and only in this case is the observer \"nonrotating relative to the local spacetime geometry.\" Thus, it is appropriate to use the name \"locally nonrotating observer\" for an observer who moves with the angular velocity II = w(r,O). (b) Associated with the axial symmetry of a black hole is a conserved quantity, p¢ = P' f(¢), for geodesic motion. This quantity for any particle-whether it is moving along a geodesic or not-is called the \"component of angular momentum along the black hole's spin axis,\" or simply the particle's \"angular momentum.\" (See §33.5 below.) Show that of all stationary observers at fixed (r, 0), only the \"locally nonrotating observer\" has zero angular momentum.

Were there no charge down the black hole, the test particle would move along a geodesic (zero 4-acceleration). But the charge produces an electromag- netic field, which in turn produces a Lorentz force on the particle: p.a = eF' u. (Here u is the particle's 4-velocity, and a \"'uu is its 4-acceleration.) The geodesic equation, a = 0, for the uncharged case is equivalent to Hamilton's equations dp,/dA. = -oX/oxlJ., (33.27a) where A. is an affine parameter so normalized that d/dA. = p = 4-momentum, and where X \"super-Hamiltonian\" = ~ gIJ.\"p~\" (33.27b) (33.27c) (see exercise 25.2).

There is good reason for going through all this formalism, rather than tackling head-on the Lorentz-force equation in its most elementary coordinate version, The Hamiltonian formalism enables one to discover immediately two constants of the motion; the elementary Lorentz-force equation does not. The key point is that the components All of A [equation (33.30)] and the components gil\" of the metric [inverse of gil\" of equation (33.2); see (33.35)] are independent of t and cp (stationarity and axial symmetry of both the electromagnetic field and the spacetime geometry). Consequently, the superhamiltonian is also independent of t and cp; and therefore Hamilton's equation guarantees that TT t and TTq, are constants of the motion.

If the black hole were to possess an additional symmetry-e.g., ifit were spherical, rather than merely axially symmetric-then automatically there would be a fourth constant of the motion. But in general, black holes are not spherical; so test-particle motion around a black hole possesses only three obvious constants. It is rather remarkable, then, that a constant turns out to exist. It was discovered by Carter (1968a), using Hamilton-Jacobi methods. As of 1973, nobody has given a cogent geometric explanation of why this fourth constant should exist-although hints of an explanation may be found in Carter (l968c) and Walker and Penrose (1970).

[Hint: Examine the light cone.] §33.7. STORAGE AND REMOVAL OF ENERGY FROM BLACK HOLES [Penrose (1969)] When an object falls into a black hole, it changes the hole's mass, charge, and intrinsic angular momentum (first law of black-hole dynamics; Box 33.4). If the infalling object is large, its fall produces much gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. To calculate the radiation emitted, and the energy and angular momentum it carries away-which are prerequisites to any calculation of the final state of the black hole-is an enormously difficult task. But if the object is very small (size of object ~ size of horizon; mass of object ~ mass of hole). and has sufficiently small charge, the radiation it emits in each circuit around the hole is negligible. For example, for gravitational radiation (energy emitted per circuit) (rest mass of object) (rest mass of object) (mass of hole) (33.48) [see §36.5; also Bardeen, Press, and Teukolsky (1972)]. Because the energy emitted is negligible, radiation reaction is also negligible, and the object moves very nearly along a test-particle trajectory. In this case, application of the first law of black-hole dynamics is simple and straightforward. Consider, initially, a small object that falls directly into the black hole from far away. According to the first law, it produces the following changes in the mass, charge, and angular momentum of the black hole: (2) hole's mass. charge. and angular momentum change by 41M = E, 410 = e. 41S = L z JM = E = (\"energy at infinity\" of infalling object), JQ = e = (charge of infalling object), (33.49a) (33.49b) LiS JI51 = L = (component of object's angular momentum).

Not unexpectedly, these changes can be written more simply in terms of the constants of motion for object B, which went down the hole. View the explosion \"A ~ B + C\" in a local Lorentz frame down near the hole, which is centered on the explosive event.

Straightforward extensions of the above thought experiment produce this general- ization: In any complicated black-hole process that involves infalling, colliding, and exploding pieces of matter that emit negligible gravitational radiation, the total changes in mass, charge, and angular momentum of the black hole are ( sum of values of energy-at-infinity, E, ) JM = for all objects which cross the horizon-with , E evaluated for each object at event of crossing JQ = (Similar sum, of charges, e, fOr) all objects crossing horizon ' J (Similar sum of axial components of angular ) S = momentum, L z ' for all objects crossing horizon .

It is precisely what one might expect from the most naive of viewpoints. Not so expected, however, is the following consequence [Penrose (1969)]: By injecting matter into a black hole in a carefully chosen way, one can decrease the total mass-energy of the black hole-i.e., one can extract energy from the hole. For uncharged infalling objects, the key to energy extraction is the ergosphere [hence its name, coined by Ruffini and Wheeler (1971 a) from the Greek word \"Wyov\" for \"work\"]. Outside the ergosphere, the Killing vector (t) a/at is timelike, as is the 4-momentum P of every test particle; and therefore E = - P • (t) is necessarily positive. But inside the ergosphere (between the horizon and the static limit), (t>"},{"pageNumber":934,"pageContent":"§33.8.

The orbits of negative E are confined entirely to the ergosphere. Thus, to inject an uncharged object with negative E into the black hole-and thereby to extract energy from the hole-one must always change its E from positive to negative and therefore also change its orbit, after it penetrates into the ergosphere.

GLOBAL TECHNIQUES VERSUS LOCAL TECHNIQUES This chapter is entirely Track 2. §22.5 (geometric optics) and the Track-2 portions of Chapters 32 and 33 (collapse and black holes) are necessary preparation for it. It is not needed as preparation for any later chapter. Local techniques of analyzing spacetime physics contrasted with global techniques Until the 1960's, computations in gravitation theory used local techniques almost exclusively: the Einstein field equation describes how the stress-energy tensor Tat a given event generates curvature G at that same event (local physics). When reduced to differential equations for the metric coefficients, G = 8'7TT relates ga/3' aga/3/ax IL , and a 2 ga/3/ax IL ax V at each given event to T YB at that same event (local equation). The solution of these differential equations is effected, on a computer or in any initial-value-type analysis, by integrating forward in time from event to event to event (local integration). The nongravitational laws of physics are obtained by invoking the equivalence principle in a local Lorentz frame at each individual event in spacetime. To build up an understanding of the global structure of spacetime, one performs local computations near each event, and then patches the local results together to form a global picture. Why this great reliance on local analyses? Because the laws of gravitation physics take on particularly simple forms when stated locally. That gravitation physics is also subject to powerful and simple global laws, physi- cists did not realize until the mid 1960's. But since 1963, studies of black holes and of singularities have revealed global laws and global properties of spacetime that rival in their simplicity and elegance even the (local) equivalence principle. An example is the second law of black-hole dynamics: \"In an isolated system, the sum of the surface areas of all black holes can never decrease.\" As a result, there has developed a powerful body of knowledge and techniques for analyzing directly the global properties of spacetime. To give a full treatment of global techniques would require many chapters. Fortunately, a full treatment is being published, almost simultaneously with this book, by Hawking and Ellis (1973). Because Hawking and Ellis are much better qualified to write on this subject than are we (Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler), we have chosen to not write a \"competitive\" treatment. Instead, we give in this chapter only a brief taste of the subject-enough of a taste to make the reader acquainted with the types of techniques involved and several of the most important results, but"},{"pageNumber":944,"pageContent":"not enough to give him a working knowledge of the subject. The topics we have chosen to treat are those that contact most closely the rest of this book: properties of \"infinity\" in an asymptotically flat spacetime (§34.2); causality and horizons (§§34.3 and 34.4); a proof of the second law of black-hole dynamics (§34.5); and theorems about the evolution of singularities in spacetime (§34.6). For greater detail on global techniques, one can consult not only the book of Hawking and Ellis (1973), but also review articles by Geroch (1971), by Penrose (1968a, 1972), and by Hawking (1973), the thesis of Godfrey (1970b), and the more specialized papers cited in the body of this chapter. §34.2. \"INFINITY\" IN ASYMPTOTICALLY FLAT SPACETIMES 917 References on global techniques §34.2.~NITY\" IN ASYMPTOTICALLY FLAT SPACETIMES When performing calculations in asymptotically flat spacetime, one often must examine the asymptotic forms of fields (e.g., the metric, or the curvature tensor, or the electromagnetic field) \"at infinity.\" For example, the mass and angular momen- tum of an isolated system are determined by the asymptotic form of the metric (Chapter 19). It is rarely sufficient to examine asymptotic forms near \"spatial infin- ity.\" For example, if one wishes to learn how much mass was carried away by gravitational and electromagnetic waves during a supernova explosion, one must examine the asymptotic form of the metric not just at \"spatial infinity,\" but at \"future null infinity\" (see Figure 34.1). Penrose (1964, 1965a) has developed a powerful body of mathematical technique for studying asymptotic properties of spacetime near \"infinity.\" The key to his technique is a \"conformal transformation\" of spacetime, which brings \"infinity\" in to a finite radius and thereby converts asymptotic calculations into calculations at \"finite points.\" Penrose's technique also provides rigorous definitions of several types of \"infinity\" that one encounters in asymptotically flat spacetimes. The details of Penrose's technique are not of importance to the rest of this chapter. However, this chapter will refer frequently to the various types of \"infinity\" defined by Penrose. In heuristic terms, they are as follows (see Figure 34.2a). 1+ \"future time like infinity\": the region t ---+ + 00 at finite radius r (region toward which timelike lines extend). 1- \"past timelike infinity\": the region t ---+ - 00 at finite radius r (region from which timelike lines come). 1° \"spacelike infinity\": the region r ---+ 00 at finite time t (region toward which spacelike slices extend). 1+ \"future null infinity\": the region t + r ---+ 00 at finite t - r (region toward which outgoing null lines extend). 1- _ \"past null infinity\": the region t - r ---+ - 00 at finite t + r (region from which ingoing null lines come).

CAUSALITY AND HORIZONS Restriction of discussion to asymptotically flat, time-oriented manifolds Turn now to global* techniques for analyzing black holes. The goals ofthe discussion will be (1) to define the concept of horizon (this section), (2) to deduce global geometric properties of horizons (next section), and (3) to prove the second law of black-hole dynamics (following section). The entire discussion will be confined to spacetime manifolds that (I) contain at least one asymptotically flat region (\"the external universe\"; region \"outside black holes\"), and (2) are \"time-oriented.\" By \"time-oriented\" one means that at each event in spacetime a distinct choice has been made as to which light cone is the future cone and which is the past, and moreover that this choice is continuous from event to event throughout spacetime. The discussion begins with definitions of a variety of causal relationships between events and regions of spacetime (see Figure 34.5). Definitions of several causality concepts Definition: q> ~ !:2 or equivalently !:2 ~ q> (\"the event q> precedes the event 2\"; \"the event !:2 follows the event tJ''') means that there exists at least one smooth, future-directed timelike curve that extends from tJ' to 2. Definition: A causal curve 8(\\) is any smooth curve that is nowhere spacelike-i.e., that is timelike or null or \"zero\" [8(\\) = some fixed tJ', for all \\] or some admixture thereof. Definition: tJ' -< !:2 or equivalently 2 >- tJ' (\"the event tJ' causally precedes the event ·Global, but not fully global; the \"universe\" of §§34.3-34.5 is asymptotically flat; no account is taken here of possible closure or collapse of the universe or of their consequences."},{"pageNumber":950,"pageContent":"~ 52\"; the event 52 causally follows the event ~\") means that there exists at least one future-directed causal curve that extends from ~ to 52. Definition: J-W), called the causal past of~, is the set of all events that causally precede ~-i.e., J-W) = {521 52 -< ~}. Definition: rw), called the causal future of~, is the set of all events that causally follow ~-i.e., rw) = {52152 >- ~}. Definition: If S is a region of spacetime-e.g., a segment of a spacelike hyper- surface-then J-(S) (the causal past of S) is the set of all events that causally precede at least one event in S-i.e., §34.3. CAUSALITY AND HORIZONS 923 J-(S) = {52152 -< ~ for at least one ~ E S}. Definition: Similarly, r(S) (the causal future of S) is the set of all events that causally follow at least one event in S-i.e., r(s) = {521 52 >- ~ for at least one ~ E S}. Definition: j+(S) is the boundary of r(s), j-(S) is the boundary of J-(S). Definition: One defines the future of~, /+W); the past of~, /-W); the future of S, /+(S); the past of S, /-(S); the boundary of the future of S, j+(S); and the boundary of the past of S, j-( S) in precisely the same manner as above, except that the phrase \"causally precede\" is replaced by \"precede,\" and \"causally follow\" is replaced by \"follow.\" Example: /+(S) = {521 52 ~ ~ for at least one ~ E S}. Not all these definitions are needed in the following discussion; but the literature on global methods uses these concepts so extensively that the reader should be familiar with them. Focus attention on a specific spacetime manifold, and in that manifold select out a specific asymptotically flat region. [In the external field of a star, there is but one asymptotically flat region. In the vacuum Schwarzschild geometry without source (Figure 34.3), there are two. In the Reissner-Nordstr0m geometry without source (Figure 34.4), there are infinitely many different asymptotically flat regions.] The selected asymptotically flat region (\"external universe\") has one future timelike infinity /+, one past timelike infinity /-, one spacelike infinity /0, one future null infinity 1+, and one past null infinity 1-. It may also possess black holes, which form by stellar collapse, and which collide, coalesce, accrete matter, and generally wreak havoc in their immediate vicinities. The surfaces of all black holes (\"future horizons\") separate the external universe, which can send signals out to 1+, from the black-hole interiors, which cannot. One thus has the definition: Definition: The totality (or \"union\") of all future horizons (surfaces of all black holes) is the region j-(1+)-i.e., it is the boundary of the domain J-UI+) that can send future-directed causal curves out to future null infinity.

[Similarly, one can define the totality of all past horizons to be j+(1-). But past horizons are of little interest for astrophysics. Whereas gravitational collapse pro- duces future horizons in a quite natural manner, past horizons must be primordial in origin-i.e., they must be postulated as initial structure in the origin ofthe universe [Novikov (1964), Ne'eman (1965)]. There is no good reason to believe that the universe began with or should have begun with such strange initial structure.] Any given spacelike slice S through spacetime will intersect j-(1+) in a number of disjoint, closed, two-dimensional surfaces. Each such 2-surface is the horizon of a single black hole at the \"moment of time\" S. See Figure 34.6. §34.4. GLOBAL STRUCTURE OF HORIZONS The union of all future horizons, j-(1+), has an especially simple global geometric structure, as follows. THEOREM [Penrose (1968a)]: j-(1+) is generated by null geodesics that have no future end points.

PROOF OF SECOND LAW OF BLACK-HOLE DYNAMICS [Hawking (1971 b, 1972a, 1973)] All the tools are now in hand for a proof of the second law of black-hole dynamics. Consider the union of all future horizons, j-(1+), in an asymptotically flat space- time, as depicted in Figure 34.8. Divide up the null-geodesic generators of j-(1+) into a large number of infinitesimal bundles, and give each bundle an identifying number, K. As one moves from past toward future along j-(1+), one occasionally sees new bundles of generators created in \"caustics\" of the 3-surface j-(1+). The caustic sources of new generators are created by such processes as the infall of matter through the horizon (example: bundle #42 in Figure 34.8), and the collision and coalescence of two black holes (example: bundle #29). But each bundle, once created, can never be destroyed (no termination of null generators as one moves from past toward future).

At a specific event ':'F along that bundle, let various observers, moving with various velocities, 'measure its (two-dimensional) cross-sectional area Cl K('3'). As shown in Figure 22.1, exercise 22.13, and exercise 22.14: (l) the cross-sectional area Cl K('3') is independent of the velocity of the observer who measures it-i.e., Cl K('3') depends only on location tJ' along the bundle; and (2) Cl K changes from event to event along the bundle in a manner governed by the \"focusing theorem\" if the energy density Too, as measured by all observers along the bundle, is nonnegative. (34.6) Proof assumes nonnegative energy density Here A K is affine parameter along the bundle. Assume-in accord with all physical experience and the best assessments of modern physics-that energy density Too can never be negative. (This assumption underlies the second law of black-hole dynamics. If it were ever found to be invalid, then one would have to abandon the second law.)

At the point where Cl //2 reaches zero, adjacent null geodesics in the bundle cross each other, giving rise to events in j-(1+) through which pass more than one null geodesic generator. But this violates Penrose's theorem on the global structure of horizons (§34.4). Thus either the supposition of negative dCl//2/dA K is wrong; or else dCl K l/2/dA K goes negative, but then, before the generators get a chance to cross [before the finite lapse (34.7) of affine parameter], the generators hit a singularity and cease to exist. To prove the second law of black-hole dynamics, one must assume that no singularity is hit by the horizon, and thereby conclude that dCl //2 / dA K never goes negative. Hawking (l971b, 1972a) makes an alternative assumption which implies dCl//2/dA K ;::: 0: Hawking assumes that spacetime is \"future asymptotically predictable. \" In essence this means that spacetime possesses no \"naked singularities\"-i.e., no singularities visible from 1+. (Naked singularities could influence the evolution of the external universe; and, therefore, unless one knew the laws of physics governing singularities- which one does not-they would prevent one from predicting the future in the external universe.) Under either assumption (no naked singularities; or horizon never hits a singular- ity), one concludes that Proof assumes that horizon never hits a singularity (no naked singularities) dCl //2/ dA K is nonnegative everywhere along bundle K. (34.8) This result says that the cross-sectional area Cl K of each bundle can never decrease as one moves toward the future along j-(1+). Since new bundles can be created, but old ones can never be destroyed as one moves toward the future, the total cross-sectional area of j-(1+) cannot decrease toward the future. Equivalently, (see Figure 34.8), if Sl and S2 are spacelike hypersurfaces with S2 everywhere to the future of Sl' then the cross-sectional area of j-(1+) at its intersection with S2' Cl(S2)' cannot be less than the cross-sectional area at Sl' Cl(SI)' This is the second law of black-hole dynamics, reformulated in more precise language than that of Chapter 33, and finally proved.

GLOBAL TECHNIQUES, HORIZONS, AND SINGULARITY THEOREMS §34.6. THEOREMS ON SINGULARITIES, AND THE \"ISSUE OF THE FINAL STATE\" Just as global techniques are powerful tools in the analysis of horizons. so they also are-powerful in the analysis of spacetime singularities. In fact, it was the proof of Penrose's (1965b) pioneering theorem on singularities that gave birth to global techniques for studying spacetime. For a detailed introduction to the global analysis of singularities, one can read the book of Hawking and Ellis (1973). Now that the reader has had a taste of global techniques, attention here will focus on a qualitative description of results: How does gravitational collapse terminate? Is the singularity at the end point of spherical collapse typical, or can asymmetries remove it? That singularities are very general phenomena, and cannot be wished away, has been known since 1965, thanks to theorems on singularities proved by Penrose, Hawking, and Geroch. [For a full list of references, see Hawking and Penrose (1969) or Hawking and Ellis (1973).] Before examining the theorems on singularities, one must make precise the concept of a singularity. This is not easy, as Geroch (1968) has emphasized in a long treatise on the wide variety of pathologies that can occur in spacetime manifolds. However, after vigorous efforts by many people, Schmidt (1970) finally produced a definition that appears to be satisfactory. Put in heuristic terms, Schmidt's highly technical definition goes something like this. In a spacetime manifold, consider all spacelike geodesics (paths of \"tachyons\"), all null geodesics (paths of photons), all timelike geodesics (paths of freely falling observers), and all timelike curves with bounded acceleration (paths along which observers are able, in principle, to move). Suppose that one of these curves terminates after the lapse of finite proper length (or finite affine parameter in the null-geodesic case). Suppose, further, that it is impossible to extend the spacetime manifold beyond that termination point-e.g., because of infinite curvature there. Then that termination point, together with all adjacent termination points, is called a \"singularity.\" (What could be more singular than the cessation of existence for the poor tachyon, photon, or observer who moves along the terminated curve?) Another concept needed in the singularity theorems is that of a trapped surface. This concept, devised by Penrose (1965b), is motivated by a close examination of the two-dimensional, spherical surfaces (r, t) = const. inside the horizon of the Schwarzschild geometry. These surfaces signal the nearness of a singularity (r = 0) by this property: light rays emitted from one of these surfaces in the perpendicular outward direction (i.e., outgoing, orthogonal, null geodesics) converge toward each other as they propagate; and inward light rays perpendicular to the 2-surface also converge. Penrose gives the name \"trapped surface\" to any closed 2-surface, spherical or not, that has this property. In Schwarzschild spacetime, the convergence of light rays, both outgoing and ingoing, can be attributed to the \"intense pull of gravity,\" which sucks the photons into the singularity. That this might also be true in asym- metric spacetimes is suggested by the Hawking-Penrose (1969) theorem [the most powerful of a wide class; see Hawking and Penrose (1969) for references to others; and see Boxes 34.2 and 34.3 for introductions to Hawking and Penrose]:"},{"pageNumber":962,"pageContent":"A spacetime M necessarily contains incomplete, inextendable time/ike or null geo- desics (and is thus singular in the Schmidt sense) if, in addition to Einstein's equations, the following four conditions hold: (1) M contains no closed timelike curves (reason- able causality condition); (2) at each event in M and for each unit timelike vector u, the stress-energy tensor satisfies §34.6. THEOREMS ON SINGULARITIES 935 The Hawking-Penrose theorem on singularities (reasonable energy condition); (3) the manifold is \"general\" (i.e., not too highly symmetric) in the sense that every timelike or null geodesic with unit tangent u passes through at least one event where the curvature is not lined up with it in a specific way: (4) the manifold contains a trapped surface. All these conditions, except the trapped surface, seem eminently reasonable for any physically realistic spacetime! Note, especially, that the energy condition can be violated only if, as measured by some local observer in his proper frame, the total energy density E is negative or the principal pressures (eigenvalues of stress tensor) Pi are so negative that 2 Pi < -E. i The relevance of the Hawking-Penrose theorem for collapse follows from the general expectation that, in the real universe, trapped surfaces will always exist just below all future horizons,j-(1+). (Exceptions, such as the Kerr metric with a = M, are probably a \"set of measure zero.\") Since horizons and accompanying trapped surfaces are necessarily produced by slightly nonspherical collapse (Box 32.2), and since they probably also result from moderately deformed collapse (§32.7), such collapse presumably produces singularities-or a violation of causality, which is also a rather singular occurrence! If the singularities are really such a general feature of collapse, then the exact nature of the singularity is oflife-and-death importance to anyone who falls through a horizon! Here one is on very shaky ground. Although the main results and conjectures described up to now in this section will probably survive all future research, opinions about the nature of the singularities are likely to change several times more before the whole story is in. Hence, it is safe only to describe the possibilities, not to attempt to judge them. Possibility 1 The singularity at the endpoint of a realistic collapse is a region of infinite tidal gravitational forces (infinite curvature), which crushes the collapsing matter to infinite density.

However, while at Cambridge from 1952-55 and again from 1957-60, his interest in general relativity was aroused by Hermann Bondi and Dennis Sciama. Because of his pure mathematical background, his approach to the subject was different from those which had been adopted hith- erto. He was particularly interested in the global light-cone structure of spacetime and in the equa- tions of zero rest-mass fields, both of which are preserved under conformal transformations, He exploited this conformal invariance to give an elegant and powerful treatment of gravitational radiation in terms of a null surface 1+ at infinity. More recently this interest has led him to develop the theory of twistors, which are the spinors corre- sponding to the conformal group of Minkowski space. These offer a new and very promising ap- proach to the quantization of spacetime. His interest in conformal geometry also led him to study the properties of the causality relation- ships between points of spacetime. These in turn led him to the theorems on the occurrence of sin- gularities in spacetime, which are probably the most important predictions of general relativity, since they seem to imply that spacetime has a beginning or an end. \"If spacetime is considered from the point of view of its conformal structure only, points at infinity can be treated on the same basis as finite points\" [PENROSE, IN INFELD (1964l] \"The argument will be to show that the existence of a trapped surface implies- irrespective of symmetry-that singularities necessarily develop\" [PENROSE (1965bl] \"While the quantum effects of gravitation are normally thought to be significant only when curvatures approach 10 33 cm- l , all our local physics is based on the Poincare group being a good approximation of a local symmetry group at dimensions greater than 10- 13 em.

GLOBAL TECHNIQUES. HORIZONS. AND SINGULARITY THEOREMS Box 34.3 STEPHEN W. HAWKING: Born January 8, 1942, Oxford, England As a research student of Dennis Sciama's in Cam- bridge, Stephen Hawking's early interest in rela- tivity theory centered mainly on the question of spacetime singularities. With Ellis, he showed that a large class of homogeneous cosmological models must be singular. Then, encouraged by work of Penrose on the singularities arising in gravitational collapse, he developed new techniques which, in a series of papers in the Royal Society of London during 1966-67, established the important result that any plausible general-relativistic cosmology must be singular. The major portion of his later research has been concerned with black holes. He devised a series of arguments of great ingenuity which, together with the work of Israel and Carter, established to all intents and purposes the result that (vacuum) black holes in general relativity are described by Kerr metrics, that topologies other than spherical cannot occur, and that a certain limit on the en- ergy emitted when two black holes congeal into one must be satisfied. Some of this work has had substantial pure mathematical interest (e.g., singularity theorems), some of it is concerned with astrophysics (e.g., work with Taylor on helium production in the big bang), some with observations (work with Gibbons on the possibility of black holes in binary star systems) and even experimental developments (with Gibbons on gravitational-wave detectors). In such scope is exhibited not only a considerable insight, depth, and versatility, but also the gift of an extraordinary determination to overcome se- vere physical handicaps, to seek out and compre- hend the truth. \"The observed isotropy of the microwave background indicates that the universe is rotating very little if at all. . . . This could possibly be regarded as an experimental verification of Mach's Principle\" [HAWKING (1969)] \"Undoubtedly, the most important results are the theorems . .. on the occurrence of singularities. These seem to imply either that the general theory of relativity breaks down or that there could be particles whose histories did not exist before (or after) a certain time. The author's own opinion is that the theory probably does break down but only when quantum gravitational effects become important. \" \"Although we have omitted the singular points from the definition of spacetime, we can still recognize the 'holes' left where they have been cut out by the existence of incomplete geodesics. \""},{"pageNumber":966,"pageContent":"§34.6.

GLOBAL TECHNIQUES. HORIZONS, AND SINGULARITY THEOREMS Will quantization of spacetime save the universe from singularities? Possibility 2 The singularity is a region of spacetime in which timelike or null geodesics terminate, not because of infinite tidal gravitational forces or infinite crushing, but because of other, more subtle pathologies. Example: \"Taub-NUT space\" [see Misner and Taub (1968)]. For other examples created specially to exhibit various pathologies, see Geroch (1968). Possibility 3 The singularity may be sufficiently limited in \"size\" and influence that all or most of the collapsing matter successfully avoids it. The matter cannot then explode back outward through the horizon that it went down; the horizon is a one-way membrane and will not let anything back out. Instead, the matter may reach a stage of maximum but finite contraction, and then reexplode into some other region of spacetime (multiply connected spacetime topology; \"wormhole\"). Analytical solutions for collapsing, charged spheres do reexplode in this manner [Novikov (1966); de la Cruz and Israel (1967); Bardeen (1968); see Figure 34.4]. Such a process requires that the \"exploding\" end of the wormhole be built into the initial conditions of the universe, with mass and angular momentum (as measured by Keplerian orbits and frame dragging) precisely equal to those that go down the black-hole end. This seems physically implausible. So does the \"explosion.\" Other Possibilities Various combinations of the above. If, as one suspects today, the singularities are of a very physical, infinite-curvature type, then one must face up to John Wheeler's (1964a) \"issue of the final state\" in its most raw and disturbing form. Wheeler, when faced with the issue, argues that infinite-curvature singularities signal a breakdown in classical general relativity-a breakdown forced by the onset of quantum gravitational phenomena (see Chapter 44). Whether quantization of gravity will actually save spacetime from such singu- larities one cannot know until the \"fiery marriage of general relativity with quantum physics has been consummated\" [Wheeler (1964a); see also Misner (1969c), and the last section of Box 30.1]."},{"pageNumber":968,"pageContent":"PART VIII GRAVITATIONAL WAVES Wherein the reader voyages on stormy seas of curvature ripples, searching for the ripple-generating storm gods, and battles through an electromagnetic and thermal fog that allows only uncertain visibility upon those seas."},{"pageNumber":970,"pageContent":".'\" -------------------------------- ......

Ripples in the shape of the ocean's surface; ripples in the shape (i.e., curvature) of spacetime. Both types of waves are idealizations. One cannot, with infinite accuracy, delineate at any moment which drops of water are in the waves and which are in the underlying ocean: Similarly, one cannot delineate precisely which parts of the spacetime curvature are in the ripples and which are in the cosmological background. But one can almost do so; otherwise one would not speak of \"waves\"! Look at the ocean from a rowboat. Waves dominate the seascape. Changes in angle and level of the surface occur every 30 feet or less. These changes propagate.

Notice from a spaceship the large-scale curvature of the ocean's surface-curvature because the Earth is round, curvature because the sun and the moon pull on the water. As waves propagate long distances, this curvature bends their fronts and changes slightly their simple wave equation. Also important over large distance are nonlinear interactions between waves, interaction with the wind, Co rio lis forces due to the Earth's rotation, etc. Spacetime is similar. Propagating through the universe, according to Einstein's theory, must be a complex pattern of small-scale ripples in the spacetime curvature, ripples produced by binary stars, by supernovae, by gravitational collapse, by explosions in galactic nuclei. Locally (\"rowboat viewpoint\") one can ignore the interaction of these ripples with the large-scale curvature. of spacetime and their nonlinear interaction with each other. One can pretend the waves propagate in fiat spacetime; and one can write down a simple wave equation for them. But globally one cannot. The large-scale curvature due to quiescent stars and galaxies will produce redshifts and will deform wave fronts; and the energy carried by the waves them- selves will help to produce the large-scale curvature. This chapter treats both view- points, the local (§§35.2-6), and the global (§§35.7-15). §35.2. REVIEW OF \"LINEARIZED THEORY\" IN VACUUM Idealize, for awhile, the gravitational waves of our universe as propagating through fiat, empty spacetime (local viewpoint). Then they can be analyzed using the \"lin- earized theory of gravity,\" which was introduced in Chapter 18. Linearized theory, one recalls, is a weak-field approximation to general relativity. The equations of linearized theory are written and solved as though spacetime were fiat (special-relativity viewpoint); but the connection to experiment is made through the curved-space formalism of general relativity. More specifically, linearized theory describes gravity by a symmetric, second-rank tensor field lip.v' In the standard (\"Lorentz,\" or Hilbert) gauge, this field satisfies the \"gauge\" or \"Subsidiary\" conditions (coordinate conditions) (1) Lorentz gauge condition h -p.a -0 ,a - .

Turn attention now away from plane waves to arbitrary gravitational waves in (2) for any wave linearized theory. Any electromagnetic wave can be resolved into a superposition of plane waves, and so can any gravitational wave. For each plane wave in the superposition, introduce the special gauge (35.8). Note that the gauge conditions are all linear in hl'v' Therefore the arbitrary wave will also satisfy conditions (35.8). Thus arises the theorem: Pick a specific global Lorentz frame of linearized theory (i.e., pick a specific 4-velocity u). In that frame (where u a = 8 a o ), examine a specific gravitational wave of arbitrary form. One can always find a gauge in which hl'v satisfies the constraints (35.8). Moreover, in this gauge only the h;k are nonzero.

Notice from Figure 35.2 that, at any moment of time, a gravitational wave is invariant under a rotation of 180° about its direction of propagation. The analogous angle for electromagnetic waves (Figure 35.1) is 360°, and for neutrino waves it is 720°. This behavior is intimately related to the spin of the zero-mass particles associated with the quantum-mechanical versions of these waves: gravitons have spin 2, photons spin 1, and neutrinos spin 1/2. The classical radiation field of a spin-S particle is always invariant under a rotation of 360° / S about its propagation direction. A radiation field of any spin S has precisely two orthogonal states of linear polarization.

GRAVITATIONAL WAVES IN THE FULL THEORY OF GENERAL RELATIVITY Curving up of the background spacetime by the energy of the waves is but one of many new effects that enter, when one passes from linearized theory to the full, nonlinear general theory of relativity. In linearized theory one can consider a localized source of gravitational waves (e.g., a vibrating bar) in steady oscillation, radiating a strictly periodic wave. But the exact theory insists that the energy of the source decrease secularly, to counter- balance the energy carried off by the radiation (energy conservation; gravitational radiation damping; see §§36.8 and 36.11). This makes an exactly periodic wave impossible, though a very nearly periodic one can certainly be emitted [Papapetrou (1958); Arnowitt, Deser, and Misner as reported by Misner (1964b)]. In the real universe there are spacetime curvatures due not only to the energy of gravitational waves, but also, and more importantly, to the material content of the universe (planets, stars, gas, galaxies). As a gravitational wave propagates through these curvatures, its wave fronts change shape (\"refraction\"), its wavelength changes"},{"pageNumber":984,"pageContent":"§35.9. AN EXACT PLANE-WAVE SOLUTION 957 (gravitational redshift), and it backscatters off the curvatures to some extent. If the wave is a pulse, the backscatter will cause its shape and polarization to keep changing and will produce \"tails\" that spread out behind the moving pulse, traveling slower than light [see exercise 32.10; also Riesz (1949), DeWitt and Brehme (1960), DeWitt and DeWitt (1964a), Kundt and Newman (1968), Couch et. al. (1968)]. However, so long as Cl ~ I and A/&!' ~ I, these effects will be extremely small locally. They can only build up over distances of the order of &!'~and sometimes not even then. Thus, locally, linearized theory will remain highly accurate. Even in an idealized universe containing nothing but gravitational waves, back- scatter and tails are produced by the interaction of the waves with the background curvature that they themselves produce. If the reduced wavelength A = \"A/2'iT and the mass-energy m of a pulse of waves satisfy A ~ m, it is possible (in principle) to focus the pulse into a region of size r < m, whereupon a part of the energy of the pulse will undergo gravitational collapse to a singularity, leaving behind a black hole [see Ruffini and Wheeler (1970), and pp. 7-24 of Christodoulou (1971)]. Short of a certain critical strength, no part of the pulse undergoes such a collapse. But it does undergo a time delay before reexpanding. This time delay is definable and measurable in the asymptotically flat space, far from the domain where the energy a little earlier underwent temporary focusing into dimensions of order A. All these effects can be analyzed in general relativity theory using approximation schemes which, in first order, are similar to or identical to linearized theory. Later in this chapter (§§35.13-35.15), one such approximation scheme will be developed. But first it is helpful to study an exact solution that exhibits some of these effects. §35.9. AN EXACT PLANE-WAVE SOLUTION Any exact gravitational-wave solution that can be given in closed mathematical form must be highly idealized; otherwise it could not begin to cope with the complexities outlined above. Consequently, mathematically exact solutions are useful for peda- gogical purposes only. However, pedogogy should not be condemned: it is needed not only by students, but also by veteran workers in the field of relativity, who even today are only beginning to develop intuition into the nonlinear regime of geometrodynamics! From the extensive literature on exact solutions, we have chosen, as a compromise between realism and complexity, the following plane wave [Bondi et. al. (1959), Ehlers and Kundt (1962)]: (3) redshift (4) backscatter (5) tails (6) self-gravitational attraction The rest of this chapter is Track 2. No earlier Track-2 material is needed as preparation for it, but Chapter 20 (conservation laws) and §22.5 (geometric optics) will be found to be helpful. It is not needed as preparation for any later chapter.

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE EXACT PLANE WAVE Spacetime is completely flat both before the arrival of the plane-wave pulse (u < - T) and after it has passed (u > T). This is the message of the last paragraph. Complete flatness outside the pulse is very atypical for gravitational waves in the full, nonlinear general theory of relativity. It occurs in this example only because the wave fronts (surfaces of constant u and v, i.e\" constant z and t) are perfectly flat 2-surfaces. If the wave fronts were bent (e.g., spherical), the energy carried by the pulse would produce spacetime curvature outside it. To see nonlinear effects in action, turn from the flat geometry outside the pulse to the action of the pulse on freely falling test particles. Consider a family of particles that are all at rest in the original t, x,y, z coordinate system (world lines: [x,y, z] = constant) before the pulse arrives. Then even while the pulse is passing, and after it has gone, the particles remain at rest in the coordinate system.

Their metrics are identical (A --+ 0 and «13')2) = const. imply 13 --+ 0), and their jigglings of test particles are too small to be seen. Only their curving up of spacetime (L f:. 1) and the associated gravitational pull of their energy are detectable. §35.12. A NEW VIEWPOINT ON THE EXACT PLANE WAVE The above comparison suggests a viewpoint that was sketched briefly in the intro- duction to this chapter and in §35.S. Think of the exact gravitational plane-wave solution [Figure 35.3; equations (35.29) and (35.33)] as ripples in the spacetime curvature, described by f3(u), propagating on a very slightly curved background spacetime, characterized by L(u). The most striking difference between the back- ground and the ripples is not in the magnitude of their spacetime curvatures, but in their characteristic lengths. The ripples have characteristic length A = (typical reduced wavelength, A/2'iT, of waves); (35.46) the background has characteristic length (\"radius of curvature of background geometry\")"},{"pageNumber":990,"pageContent":"§35.12.

THE SHORTWAVE APPROXIMATION The remainder of this chapter extends the above viewpoint in a rigorous manner to very general gravitational-wave solutions. This extension is called the \"shortwave formalism\"; it was largely devised by Isaacson (l968a,b), though it was built On foundations laid by Wheeler (l964a) and by Brill and Hartle (1964). Versions that are even more rigorous have been given in the W.K.B. or geometric-optics limit by Choquet-Bruhat (1969), and by MacCallum and Taub (1973). Consider gravitational waves propagating through a vacuum background space- time. As in §35.7, let tJl be the typical radius of curvature of the background; let A and d be the typical reduced wavelength (.\\j2'iT) and amplitude of the waves; and demand both d ~ 1 and .1/(>il ~ 1. The background curvature might be due entirely to the waves, or partly to waves and partly to nearby matter and nongravi- tational fields. The analysis uses a coordinate system closely \"tuned\" to spacetime in the sense that the metric coefficients can be split into \"background\" coefficients plus perturba- tions with these properties: (I) the amplitude of the perturbation is d hp.v ~ (typical value of g~,!) • d; (2) the scale on which gj,B,! varies is ~ (>il g (B) < (typical value of g(B»/(>il' p.v,Cl. __ J.l.P , (3) the scale on which hp.v varies is -A hp.v,o:. - (typical value of hp.v)/.1.

One begins by selecting out of expression (35.57) the part linear in the amplitude of the wave d, and setting it equal to zero. The action of the waves to curve up the background is a nonlinear phenomenon (linearized theory shows no sign of it); so R~B; cannot be linear in d.

Thus, it can be applied whenever the waves are weak, even if the wavelength is large! All nonlinear interactions of the wave with itself are neglected in this first-order propagation equation. Absent is the mechanism for waves to scatter off each other and off the background curvature that they themselves produce. Also absent are any hints of a change in shape of pulse due to self-interaction as a pulse of waves propagates. There are no signs of the gravitational collapse that one knows must occur when a mass-energy m of gravitational waves gets compressed into a region of size ~m. To see all these effects, one must turn to corrections of second order in {f and higher [e.g., equations (35.59c) and (35.60)]. Actually contained in the propagation equation are all effects due to the linear action of the background curvature on the propagating wave. These effects are explored, for short wavelengths (A/~ ~ 1) and for nearly flat wave fronts, in exercises 35.15-35.17 at the end of the chapter. The effects considered include a gravitational redshift of gravitational radiation and gravitational deflection of the direction of propagation of gravitational radiation, identical to those for light; and also a rotation of the polarization tensor.

Consider a classical radiation field, whose associated quantum mechanical particles have integer spin S, and zero rest mass. Resolve that radiation field into spherical harmonics-i.e., into multipole moments. All components with I < S will vanish; in general those with I ~ S will not; and this is independent of the nature of the source!

GENERATION OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES tional radiation (S = 2) is ordinarily quadrupolar (I = S = 2). Closely connected with this theorem is the \"topological fixed-point theorem\" [e.g., Lifshitz (1949)], which distinguishes between scalar, vector, and tensor fields. For a scalar disturbance, such as a pressure wave, there is no difficulty in having a spherically symmetric source. Thus, over a sphere of a great radius r, there is no difficulty in having a pressure field that everywhere, at anyone time, takes on the same value p. In contrast, there is no way to lay down on the surface of a 2-sphere a continuous vector field, the magnitude of which is non-zero and everywhere the same (\"no way to comb smooth the hair on the surface of a billiard ball\"). Likewise, there is no way to lay down on the surface of a 2-sphere a continuous non-zero transverse-traceless 2 X 2 matrix field that differs from one point to another at most by a rotation. Topology thus excludes the possibility of any spherically symmetric source of gravitational radiation whatsoever. §36.2.

The wave amplitude goes down in proportion to the fraction of the mass in motion, and the power is reduced in proportion to the square of that fraction.) Clearly, the maximum power output occurs when the system is near its gravitational radius; and because nothing, not even gravitational waves, can escape from inside the gravitational radius, the maximum value of the output is -- L o = 3.63x 10 59 ergs/second, regardless of the nature of the system! Actually, the above derivation of this limit and of equation (36.11 c) uses approxi- mations to general relativity that break down near the gravitational radius.

The time required for radiation-reaction forces to affect a system substantially [equation (36.8)] is of the order Radiation reaction in astrophysical SOurces (36.l1d) where T is the characteristic time (36.l1a) of rotation or free fall. (Note how one inserts and removes the factor L o = 1 at will!) Consequently, the effect of radiation reaction, as integrated over one period, is unimportant except when the system is near its gravitational radius. When a system such as a pulsating star is settling down into an equilibrium state, the radiation reaction will damp its internal motions. On the other hand, when the system, like a binary star system, is far from any state of equilibrium, then loss of energy (and angular momentum) to radiation under certain circumstances may speed up the angular velocity or speed up the internal motions and augment the radiation. §36.5. GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE, BLACK HOLES, SUPERNOVAE, AND PULSARS AS SOURCES Since L GW - (Mj R)5L o ' the most intense gravitational waves reaching Earth must come from a dynamic, deformed system near its gravitational radius (L GW drops by a factor 100,000 with each increase by 10 of R!). The scenario of Figure 24.3 gives an impression of some of the dynamic processes that not only may happen but probably must happen. The sequence of events sketched out there includes pulses of gravitational radiation interspersed with intervals of continuous radiation of gradually increasing frequency. Pulse number one comes at the time of the original collapse of a star with white-dwarf core to a pancake-shaped neutron star. The details of what then goes on will differ enormously depending on the original mass and angular momentum of this \"pancake.\" In the illustration, this pancake fragments into a constellation of corevolving neutron stars, which then one by one undergo \"pursuit and plunge.\" Whether in this kind of scenario or otherWise, perhaps the most favorable source of gravitational radiation is a star (the original very temporary \"pancake\" or one of the fragments therefrom) collapsing through its gravitational radius in a highly nonspherical manner. Such a star should terminate life with a last blast of gravita- tional waves, which carry off a sizeable fraction of its rest mass. Thus an order-of- magnitude estimate gives Gravitational waves from: (1) stellar collapse and formation of a black hole .

GENERATION OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES (2) the fall of debris into a black hole (Whether the energy radiated is 0.9M, or O.IM, or O.OIM is not known for certain today; but it must lie in this range of orders of magnitude.) The radiation should be weak at low frequencies; it should rise to a peak at a frequency a little smaller than I! M; and it should cut off sharply for circular frequencies above w -- 1/ M. Matter (\"debris\"; see Figure 24.3) falling into a black hole can also be a significant source of gravitational waves. The infalling matter will radiate only weakly when it is far from the gravitational radius; but as it falls through the gravitational radius (between r -- 4M and r = 2M), it should emit a strong burst. If m is the mass of an infalling lump of matter and M is the total mass of the black hole, then the total energy in the final burst is (36.13) and it comes off in a time -- M with a power output of L GW -- (m/ M)2 La' (See exercise 36.2.) Actually, this is an extremely rough estimate of the energy output. In the limit where the infalling lump is small in both size and mass [(size oflump) ~ (gravitational radius of black hole); m ~ M; \"delta-function lump\"], one can perform an exact calculation of the spectrum and energy radiated by treating the lump and the waves as small perturbations on the Schwarzschild geometry of the black hole. The foundations for such a treatment were given by Zerilli (1970b). Zerilli's formula was corrected and applied to the case of head-on impact by Davis, Ruffini, Press, and Price (1971). They predict the spectrum of Figure 36.2 and the total energy output Eradiated = 0.0104m 2 /M (36.14) (3) collisions of black holes (4) supernova explosions for m ~ M and (size of lump) ~ M. A collision between black holes should also produce a strong burst of gravitational waves-through such collisions are probably very rare! Not quite so rare, but still not common, are supernova explosions (about one per galaxy per 100 years). According to current theory as verified by pulsar observations, a supernova is triggered by the collapse of the core of a highly evolved star (see §24.3). The collapse itself and the subsequent wild gyrations of the collapsed core (neutron star) should produce a short, powerful burst of gravitational waves. The characteristics of the burst, as estimated with formulas (36.11), and assuming large departures from sphericity, are (energy radiated) -- (neutron-star binding energy) -- M2/R -- O.1M -- 10 53 ergs, (mean frequency) -- liT -- (M/ R3)1/2 -- 0.03M-l -- 3000 Hz, (36.15) (power output) -- (M/ R)5 La -- 10- 5 La -- 3 X 10 54 ergs/sec, time for gravitational radiation to damp the motion if turbulence, =: 7' -- M(M/ R)-4 -- 0.1 sec -- 300 periods. heat conduction, and other effects do not damp it sooner"},{"pageNumber":1010,"pageContent":"§36.5.

The total energy radiated is distributed among multipoles according to the empirical law (energy in I-pole waves)::::: (0.44 m 2 /M)e- 21 , and the total spectrum peaks at angular frequency w max = 0.32/ M. These results were calculated by treating the infalling lump and the gravitational waves as small perturbations on the Schwarzschild geometry of the black hole. The relevant perturbation-theory equations were derived by Zerilli (1970), and were solved numerically to give these results by Davis, Ruffini, Press, and Price (1971). In the last stages of the stellar pulsations, when the amplitude ~ = Sr has dropped to Sr/r ~ 1, one can calculate the pulsation frequencies and damping times exactly by treating the fluid motions and gravitational waves as small perturbations of an equilibrium stellar model. The results of such a calculation, which are in good agreement with the above rough estimates, are shown in Box 36.1. Long after the pulsations of the neutron star have been damped out by gravita- tional radiation reaction and by other forces, the star will continue to rotate; and as it rotates, carrying along with its rotation an off-axis-pointing magnetic moment, it will beam out the radio waves, light, and x-rays that astronomers identify as \"pulsar radiation.\" In this pulsar phase, gravitational radiation is important only if the star is somewhat deformed from axial symmetry (axial symmetry ==>- constant quadru- pole moment ==>- no gravitational waves).

GENERATION OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES EXERCISES Binary stars as sources of gravitational waves: Of the sources discussed in this section, most are \"impulsive\" rather than continu- ous (star collapsing through gravitational radius; debris falling into a black hole; collision between black holes; supernova explosion). They give rise to bursts of gravitational waves. An order-of-magnitude method of analyzing such bursts is spelled out in Box 36.2. It is difficult and risky to pass from the above description of processes that should generate gravitational waves to an estimate of the characteristics of the waves that actually bathe the earth. For such an estimate, made in 1972 and subject to extensive revision as one's understanding of the universe improves, see Press and Thorne (1972). Exercise 36.2.

No one has seen how to bring a macroscopic mass up to a speed v - 1. These conditions are also satisfied by every gravitationally bound, nearly Newtonian system. Thus, for such a system of mass M, the condition for gravitational binding, ~Mv2 ~ M2/ R guarantees that v ~ (M/ R)l/2 ~ 1. The conditions M/R ~ R/A\" and ITikl/TOo ~ R/A\" are satisfied by all nearly Newtonian sources of conceivable interest. Typical sources (e.g. binary stars) have §36.7. FORMULAS FOR RADIATION FROM SLOW-MOTION SOURCES 991 (virial theorem). In those rare cases where (M/R or ITikl/TOO) ~ R/A\" (e.g., a mar- ginally stable, slowly vibrating star), the motion is so very slow that the radiation will be too weak to be interesting. For any nearly Newtonian slow-motion system, there is a spacetime region deep inside the near zone (r ~ A\"), but outside the boundary of the source (r > R), in which vacuum Newtonian gravitation theory is nearly valid. An observer in this Newtonian region can measure the Newtonian potential fJj and can expand it in powers of I / r: Definitions of mass, dipole moment, and reduced quadrupole moment for a slow-motion source where n i = xi/r. (36.l9a) He can then give names to the coefficients in this expansion: M \"total mass~energy\" = \"active gravitational mass\"; d i \"dipole moment\" [if he chooses the origin of coordinates (36.l9b) carefully, he can make d i = 0]; f ik \"reduced quadrupole moment\" {because the system is nearly Newtonian, f ik is given by expression (36.3)]. As this Newtonian potential reaches out into the radiation zone, the static portions of it (-M/r - d i n i /r 2 ) maintain their Newtonian form, unchanged. But the dynamic part (-~fiknink /r 3 ) ceases to be describable in Newtonian terms. As retardation effects become noticeable (at increasing r values), it gradually changes over into outgoing gravitational waves, which must be described in the full general theory of relativity, or in linearized theory, or in the \"shortwave\" approximation of §35.13. If one chooses to use linearized theory in the radiation zone, and if one imposes the transverse-traceless gauge there (hf{;. = 0, hT! = 0, hf,{,k = 0), then the gravita- tional waves take the form [derived later as equation (36.47)] Properties of gravitational waves in terms of reduced quadrupole moment: 2 ..

RADIATION REACTION IN SLOW-MOTION SOURCES 993 §36.8. RADIATION REACTION IN SLOW-MOTION SOURCES· The conservation laws discussed in Box 19.1 and derived in §20.5 guarantee that the source must lose energy and angular momentum at the same rate as the gravita- tional waves carry them off. The agent that produces these losses is a tiny component of the spacetime curvature inside the source, which reverses sign if one changes from a (realistic) outgoing-wave boundary condition at infinity to the opposite (unrealistic) ingoing-wave condition. These \"radiation-reaction\" pieces of the curvature can be described in Newtonian language when the source obeys the nearly Newtonian, slow-motion conditions (36.18). The dynamical part of the Newtonian potential, in its \"standard form\" Outgoing-wave boundary condition gives rise to a Newtonian-type radiation-reaction potential has no retardation in it. (Newtonian theory demands action at a distance!) Conse- quently, there is no way whatsoever for the standard potential to decide, at large radii, whether to join onto outgoing waves or onto ingoing waves. Being undecided, it takes the middle track of joining onto standing waves (half outgoing, plus half ingoing). But this is not what one wants. It turns out (see §36.11) that the join can be made to purely outgoing waves if and only if fJj is augmented by a tiny \"radia- tion-reaction\" potential fJj _ fJj + fJj(react) - standard Newtonian theory , (36.26a) Form and magnitude of the radiation-reaction po!ential (36.26b) If, instead, one sets fJj = fJj standard - fJj(react), the potential will join onto purely ingoing waves.

However, at the inner boundary of the radiation zone (r ....... tl), it is of the same order of magnitude as the dynamic, quadru- pole part of the standard potential. The radiation-reaction part of the Newtonian potential plays the same role as a producer of accelerations that any other part of the Newtonian potential does.

One does not have to know the inner workings of a star to define its mass (influence on Kepler orbits outside) nor does one have to know those inner workings to define its quadrupole moment as sensed externally.

A Newtonian physicist views the equation of motion (4) in a rather different manner. Having been told that the spatial coordinates xi measure proper distance and direction away from the detector's center of mass, he thinks of them as the standard Euclidean spatial coordinates of Newtonian theory.

These eight detectors, and others, can be analyzed easily using the force-line diagrams of Box 37.2. A qualitative discussion of each of the eight detectors is given below. (A full quantitative analysis for each one would entail experimental techni- calities' for which general relativity is irrelevant, and which are beyond the scope of this book. However, some quantitative details are spelled out in §§37.5-37.8.) 1 . The Relative Motions of Two Freely Falling Bodies As a gravitational wave passes two freely falling bodies, their proper separation oscillates (Figure 37.3). This produces corresponding oscillations in the redshift and round-trip travel times for electromagnetic signals propagating back and forth between the two bodies. Either effect, oscillating redshift or oscillating travel time, could be used in principle to detect the passage of the waves. Examples of such detectors are the Earth-Moon separation, as monitored by laser ranging [Fig. 37.2(a)]; Earth-spacecraft separations as monitored by radio ranging; and the separation between two test masses in an Earth-orbiting laboratory, as monitored by redshift measurements or by laser interferometry. Several features of such detectors are explored in exercises 37.6 and 37.7. As shown in exercise 37.7, such detectors have so Iowa sensitivity that they are of little experimental interest. Figure 37.3. Time of round-trip travel between two geodesics responds to oscillations in the curvature of spacetime (diagram is schematic only; symbolic of a laser pulse sent from the Earth to a comer reflector on the Moon and back at a time when a very powerful, long-wavelength gravitational wave passes by; the wave would have to be powerful because a direct measure of distance to better than 10 cm is difficult, and such precision produces a much less sensitive indicator of waves than the vibrations in length [10- 14 cm or less) of a Weber bar; see exercise 37.7). The geodesics are curved toward each other in regions where the relevant component of the Riemann curvature tensor, call it R zoz 6' has one sign, and curved away from each other in regions where it has the opposite sign. The diagram allows one to see at a glance the answer to an often expressed puzzlement: Is not any change in round· trip travel time mere trumpery flummery? The metric perturbation, 8h pp , of the wave changes the scale of distances slightly but also correspondingly changes the scale of time. Therefore does not every possibility of any really meaningful and measurable effect cancel out? Answer: (I) The widened separation between the geodesics is not a local effect but a cumulative one. It does not arise from the local value of 8h pp directly or eve~ from the local value of the curvature. It arises from an accumulation of the bending process over an entire half· period of the gravitational wave. (2) The change in separation of the geodesics is a true change in proper distance, and shows up in a true change in proper time (see \"ticks\" on the world line of one of the particles). See exercise 37.6. Note: When one investi· gates the separation between the geodesics, not over a single period, as here, but over a large number of periods, he finds a cumulative, systematic, net slow bending of the rapidly wiggling geodesics toward each other. This small, attractive acceler- ation is evidence in gravitation physics of the effective mass-energy carried by the gravitational waves (see Chapter 35)."},{"pageNumber":1043,"pageContent":"§37.3. TYPES OF MECHANICAL DETECTORS 2. Normal-Mode Vibrations of the Earth and Moon 1015 A gravitational wave sweeping over the Earth will excite its quadrupole modes of (2) Earth and Moon vibration, since the driving forces in the wave have quadrupole spatial distributions [see Fig. 37.2(b)). The fundamental quadrupole mode of the Earth has a period of 54 minutes, while that of the moon has a period of 15 minutes. Thus, the Earth and Moon should selectively pick out the 54-minute and 15-minute components of any passing wave train. Section 37.7 will analyze quantitatively the interaction between the wave and solid-body vibrations. By comparing that analysis with seismometer studies of the Earth's vibrations, Weber (1967) put the first observational limit ever on the cosmic flux of gravitational waves: I. d / flux < 3 X 10 7 erg cm- 2 sec- 1 HZ-1 at v = 3.1 X 10- 4 Hz. (37.8) .' requency 3. Oscillations in the Earth's Crust If the neutron star in a pulsar is slightly deformed from axial symmetry, its rotation (3) Earth's crust will produce gravitational waves. The period of the waves is half the period of the pulsar (rotation of star through 180 0 produces one period ofwaves)-i.e., it should range from 0.017 sec for NP0532 (Crab Pulsar) to 1.87 sec. for NP0527. Such a wave train cannot excite the 54-minute quadrupole vibration or any of the other normal, low-frequency modes of vibration of the Earth. The kind of vibrations it can excite allow themselves in principle to be described in the language of normal modes. However, they are clearly and more conveniently envisaged as vibrations of localized regions of the Earth; or, more particularly, vibrations of the Earth's crust. Dyson (1969) has analyzed the response of an elastic solid, such as the Earth, to an incident, off-resonance gravitational wave. He shows that the response depends on irregularities in the elastic modulus for shear waves, and that it is strongest at a free surface [Figure 37.2(c)). For the fraction of gravitational-wave energy crossing a flat surface that is converted into energy of elastic motion of the solid, he finds the expression (fraction) = (8'ITGp/w 2 )(s/C)3 X sin 2 0lcosOI- 1 [1 + cos 2 0 + (s/v) sin 2 0). (37.9) Here s and v are the velocities of shear waves and compressive waves, respectively, and 0 is the angle between the direction of propagation of the waves and the normal to the surface. Considering a flux of 2 X 10- 5 erg/cm 2 sec (an optimistic but con- ceivable value for waves from a pulsar) incident horizontally (0 = 'IT /2; \"divergent\" factor Icos 01- 1 cancels out in calculation!), and taking s to be 4.5 X 10 5 cm/sec and w to be 6 rad/sec, he calculates that the I-Hz horizontal displacement produced in the surface has an amplitude of ~o -- 2 X 10- 17 cm, too small by a factor of the order of 10 5 to be detected against background seismic noise. He points to the possibilities of improvements, especially via resonance (elastic waves reflected back and forth between two surfaces; Antarctic ice sheet)."},{"pageNumber":1044,"pageContent":"(4) elastic bar (5) elastic bodies of other shapes (6) rotating bars (\"heterodyne detector\") 1016 37. DETECTION OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES 4. Normal-Mode Vibrations of an Elastic Bar As of 1972, the most often-discussed type of detector is the aluminum bar invented by Jos.epn Weber (1960, 1961) [see Figures 37.1 and 37.2(d)]. Weber's bars are cylindrical in shape, with length 153 cm, diameter 66 cm, and weight 1.4 X 10 6 g. Each bar is suspended by a wire in vacuum and is mechanically decoupled from its surroundings. Around its middle are attached piezoelectric strain transducers, which couple into electronic circuits that are sensitive to the bar's fundamental end-to-end mode of oscillation (frequency v = 1,660 Hz). When a gravitational wave hi ts the bar broadside, as shown in Figure 37.2( d), the rela tive accelerations carried by the wave will excite the fundamental mode of the bar. As of 1972, Weber observes sudden, simultaneous excitations in two such bars, one at the University of Maryland, near Washington, D.C.; the other at Argonne National Laboratory, near Chicago [see Weber (1969, 1970a,b)]. No one has yet come forward with a workable explana- tion for Weber's coincidences other than gravitational waves from outer space. However, the history of physics is rich with instances where supposedly new effects had to be attributed in the end to long familiar phenomena. Therefore it would seem difficult to rate the observed events as \"battie-tested.\" To achieve that con- fidence rating would seem to require confirmation with different equipment, or under different circumstances, or both; experiments to provide that confirmation are now (1972) underway. If one makes this tentative assessment, one can be excused for expressing at the same time the greatest admiration for the experimental ingenuity, energy, and magnificent persistence that Joseph Weber has shown in his more than decade-long search for the most elusive radiation on the books of physics. Mechanical detectors of the above four types represent systems on which meas- urements have been made; so practical difficulties and realizable noise levels can be estimated properly. In the continuing search for improved methods, more elaborate detectors are being studied, and in 1972 one can list a number of interesting pro- posals, as below. For these it is hard to know how JP.uch development would be required in order to achieve the desired performance. 5. Normal-Mode Vibrations of Elastic Bodies of Other Shapes The \"bar\" of a Weber detector need not be cylindrical in shape.

TYPES OF MECHANICAL DETECTORS 1017 out. But the tidal accelerations contain, in addition to a length-changing component, also a tangential, rotation-producing component. In picture (a) of Box 37.2, the length-changing component dominates near the x and j axes, whereas the rotation- producing component dominates half-way between the axes. Vladimir B. Braginsky was the first to propose a detector that responds to the rotation-producing accelera- tions [see Braginsky, Zel'dovich, and Rudenko (1969); Braginsky and Nazarenko (1971)]. It consists of two metal rods, oriented perpendicular to each other, and rotating freely with angular velocity W o in their common plane [see Fig. 37.2(0]. (The rotation is relative to the gyroscopes of the proper reference frame of the detector; equivalently, it is relative to the Lorentz frame local to the detector.) Let monochromatic gravitational waves of angular frequency w = 2wo (change of phase per unit of time equals twice the angular velocity at which the pattern of lines of force turns) impinge broadside on the rotating rods. The righthand circularly polar- ized component of the waves will then rotate with the rods; so their orientation in its lines-of-force diagram will remain forever fixed. With the orientation of Fig. 37.2(0, rod A will undergo angular acceleration, while rod B will decelerate. The experimenter can search for the constant relative angular acceleration of the two rods (constant so long as the angle between them does not depart significantly from 90°). Better yet, the experimenter can (all too easily) adjust the rotation rate W o so it does not quite match the waves' frequency w. Then for iwo/lw - 2w o l rotations, rod A will accelerate and B will decelerate; then will follow !wo/lw - 2w o l rotations in which A decelerates and B accelerates, and so on (frequency beating). The experimenter can search for oscillations in the relative orientation of the rods. One need not worry about the lefthand polarized waves marring the experiment. Since they do not rotate with the rods, their angular accelerations average out over one cycle. Such a device is called a \"heterodyne detector\" by Braginsky. He envisages that such detectors might be placed in free-fall orbits about the Earth late in the 1970's. Heterodyne detectors would work most efficiently for long monochromatic wave trains such as those from pulsars; but even for short bursts of waves they may be more sensitive than vibrating bars [see Braginsky and Nazarenko (1971 )]. 7. Angular Accelerations of Driven Oscillators Andrei D. Sakharov (1969) has proposed a different type of detector for the angular accelerations of a gravitational wave. Instead of two rotating bars, it consists of two identical, driven oscillators, initially parallel and nonrotating, but oscillating out of phase with each other. Each oscillator experiences angular accelerations in one direction at one phase of a passing wave, and in the opposite direction at the next phase, but the torques do not cancel out. When the oscillator is maximally distended, it experiences a greater torque (acceleration ex length; torque ex length 2 ) than when it is maximally contracted. Consequently, if the driven oscillations have the same angular frequency as a passing, monochromatic wave, and if the phases are as shown in Figure 37.2(g), then oscillator A will receive an angular acceleration in the right- hand direction, while B receives an angular acceleration in the left hand direction.

Pumping of Fluid in a Rotating Loop of Pipe A third type of detector that responds to angular accelerations has been described by William Press (1970). This detector would presumably be far less sensitive than others, \"and therefore not worth constructing; but it is intriguing in its novel design; and it illustrates features of gravitational waves ignored by other detectors. Press's detector consists of a loop of rotating pipe, containing a superfluid. The shape of the pipe and its constant rotation rate are chosen so that the gravitational waves will pump the fluid around inside the pipe. One conceivable pipe design (a bad one to build in practice, but an easy one to analyze) is shown in Fig. 37.2(h). Note that use is made of the variation in tidal acceleration along the direction ofpropaga- tion of the wave as well as perpendicular to that direction. To analyze the response of the fluid to a righthand circularly polarized wave, one can mentally place the rotating pipe in the three-dimensional line-of-force diagram of Box 37.2(c). Exercise 37.6. RELATIVE MOTION OF FREELY FALLING BODIES AS A DETECTOR OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES [see Figures 37.2(a) and 37.3.] Consider two test bodies initially at rest with respect to each other in flat, empty spacetime. (The case where other, gravitating bodies are nearby can be treated without too much more difficulty; but this exercise concerns only the simplest example!) A plane, nearly monochro- matic gravitational wave, with angular frequency wand polarization e+, impinges on the bodies, coming from the -z direction. As shown in exercise 35.5, the bodies remain forever at rest in those TT coordinates that constituted the bodies' glo~bal inertial frame before the wave arrived. Calculate, for arbitrary separations (Ax, Ay, Az) of the test bodies, the redshift and the round-trip travel time of photons going back and forth between them. Compare the answer, for large Ax, Ay, Az, with the answer one would have obtained by using (without justification!) the equation of geodesic deviation. Physically, why does the correct answer oscillate with increasing separation? Discuss the feasibility and the potential sensitivity of such a detector using current technology. ~ Exercise 37.7. EARTH-MOON SEPARATION AS A GRAVITATIONAL-WAVE DETECTOR In the early 1970's one can monitor the Earth-moon separation using laser ranging to a precision of 10 cm, with successive observations separated by at least one round-trip travel time. Suppose that no oscillations in round-trip travel time are observed except those (of rather long periods) to be expected from the Earth-moon-sun-planets gravitational interac- tion. What limits can one then place on the energy flux of gravitational waves that pass the Earth? The mathematical formula for the answer should yield numerically ~ Flux ~ 10 18 erg/cm 2 sec for OJ cycle/sec ~ v ~ I cycle/day, corresponding to a limit on the mass density in gravitational waves of Density ~ 10- 13 g/crn 3 .

When Evibration ~ kT, the driving force of the waves dominates over the detector's random, internal, Brownian-noise forces (\"wave·dominated detector\"); when Evibration ~ kT, the driving force of the waves must compete with the detector's random, internal, Brownian-noise forces (\"noisy detector\").

However, in principle one can envisage a larger system and conditions where the reradiation is not at all negligible. In such an instance one is dealing with scattering. No attempt is made here to analyze such scattering processes. For a simple order-of-magnitude treatment, one can use the same type of Breit- Wigner scattering formula that one employs to calculate the scattering of neutrons at a nuclear resonance or photons at an optical resonance. A still more detailed account will analyze the correlation between the polarization of the scattered radiation and the polarization of the incident radiation. The kind of formalism useful here for gravitational radiation with its tensor character will be very much like that now used to treat polarization of radiation with a spin-l character. Here notice especially the \"Madison Convention\" [Barschall and Haeberli (1971)] developed by the collaborative efforts of many workers after experience during many years with a variety of conflicting notations. Considering the way in which the best notation that is available today for spin-l radiation was evolved, one can only feel that it is too early to canonize anyone notation for describing the scattering parameters for an object that is scattering gravitational radiation.

Unfortunately, all experiments today (1973) are faced with noisy detectors. Nobody has yet found waves so strong, or constructed a detector so sensitive, that the detector is wave-dominated. Consequently, a key experimental task today is to pick a small signal out of large noise. Many techniques for doing this have been developed and used in a variety of fields of physics, as well as in astronomy, psychology and engineering [see, e.g., Davenport and Root (1958), Blackman and Tukey (1959), and"},{"pageNumber":1065,"pageContent":"§37.B.

The key point is always to find some feature of the signal that is statistically more prominent than the same feature of the noise, plus a correlation to show that it arises from the expected signal source and not from elsewhere (\"protection from systematic error\"). Thus to detect steady gravitational waves from a pulsar, one might seek to define very precisely two numbers (N2) and «N + S)2) = (N2) + (S2), where Nand S are the noise and signal amplitudes respectively. A long series of observations (with the pulsar out of the antenna beam) gives one value of (N2). Another equally long series of observations, interspersed with the first series, will be expected in zeroth approximation to give the same value of (N2). In the next approximation one recognizes and calculates the influence of normal statistical fluctuations. In an illustrative example, theory, confirmed by statistical tests of other parameters drawn from the same data, guarantees that the fluctuations are less than 1O-5(N2) with 95 per cent confidence (only 5 per cent chance of exceeding 1O-5(N2); this limit is set by time and money, not by absolute limitations of physics).

DETECTION OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES (molecular) energy exchanges with a heat bath. The calculations below estimate the typical rate of change of amplitude that a series of such molecular \"knocks\" can produce in a detector, and compare it with the rapid amplitude change produced by a \"hammer-blow\" pulse of radiation. The calculations show that sudden thermally induced changes, even of very small amplitude, are rare. Thus sudden changes are a suitable feature for the observations to focus on. The actual detection of pulses requires a more extended analysis, however, which goes beyond the estimates made below. Such an analysis would calculate the probabilities that rare events (sudden changes in amplitude) occur by chance (i.e., due to thermal fluctuations) in specified periods of time, the still smaller probabilities that they occur in coincidence between two or more detectors, and the correlations with postulated sources. Consider a realistic detector of the type described in Box 37.4. But examine it at a time when it is not radiation-dominated. Then its motions are being driven by internal Brownian forces (thermal fluctuations), and perhaps also by an occasional burst of gravitational waves. Focus attention on a particular normal mode (mode \"n\"), and describe that mode's contribution to the vibration of the detector by the vector field (37.47) Description of thermal noise in resonant detector Since un is dimensionless with mean value unity (Jpu n 2 d 3 x = M), the complex number ~:Bn(t) is the mass-weighted average of the amplitudes of motion of the detector's mass elements. This amplitude changes slowly with time (rate ~ w n ) as a result of driving by Brownian forces; but averaged over time it has a magnitude corresponding to a vibration energy of kT: (37.48) l.e., (37.49) Example: for Weber's detector (M -- 10 3 kg, W o - 10 4 /sec), the fundamental mode at room temperature has ( 2 X 1.38 X 10- 16 X 300 erg )1/2 !t3rms = = 3 X 10- 14 em. o 106 g X 10 8 sec 2 (37.50) ~ One's hope for detecting weak hammer-blow radiation lies not in an examination of the detector's vibration amplitude (or energy), but in an examination of its rate of change (Figure 37.5). The time-scale for large Brownian fluctuations in amplitude (1.:i!t3 n l - !t3~ms), when the detector is noisy, is the same as the time scale Tn for internal forces to damp the detector, when it is driven to Evibration ~ kT. Thus, the amplitude !t3 n does a \"random walk\" under the influence of Brownian forces, with the mean time for \"large walks\" (1.:i!t3 n l - g'1~ms) being .:it ;:::: Tn\" The change in g'1n over shorter times .:it is smaller by the \"1/ VN factor,\" which always enters into random-walk processes:"},{"pageNumber":1067,"pageContent":"§37.8.

(37.55) Ways to improve sensitivity of detector Non-mechanical detectors The future of gravitational-wave astronomy Thus, only a burst that arrives in phase with the initial motion of the detector or with reversed phase will be measurable. But for such a burst, the criteria (37.54) are suffi cien t. Equations (37.54) make it clear that there are three ways to improve the sensitivity of vibratory detectors to hammer-blow radiation: (l) increase the detector's integrated cross-section [which can be done only by increasing the rate A GW at which it reradiates gravitational waves; see equations (lOb) and (l1 b) of Box 37.4]; (2) cool the detector; (3) increase the detector's damping time. Box 37.5 applies the above detectability criteria to some detectors that seem feasible in the 1970's, and to some bursts of waves predicted by theory. The conclu- sions of that comparison give one hope! To be complete, the above discussion should have analyzed not only noise in the detector, but also the noise in the sensor which one uses to measure the amplitude of the detector's displacements. However, the theory of displacement sensors is beyond the scope of this book. For a brief discussion and for references, see Press and Thorne (1972). §37.9. NON-MECHANICAL DETECTORS When gravitational waves flow through matter, they excite it into motion. Such excitations are the basis for all detectors described thus far. But gravitational waves interact not only with matter; they also interact with electromagnetic fields; and those interactions can also be exploited in detectors. One of the most promising detectors that may be built in the future, one designed by Braginsky and Menskii (1971), relies on a resonant interaction between gravitational waves and electro- magnetic waves. It is described in Box 37.6. §37.10. LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE As this book is being written, it is not at all clear whether the experimental results of Joseph Weber constitute a genuine detection of gravitational waves. (See §37.4, part 4.) But whether they do or not, gravitational-wave astronomy has beglJn, and seems to have a bright future. The technology of 1973 appears sufficient for the construction of detectors that will register waves from a star that collapses to form a black hole anywhere in our galaxy (Box 37.5); and detectors of the late 1970's and early 1980's may well register waves from pulsars and from supernovae in other galaxies. The technical difficulties to be surmounted in constructing such detectors are enormous. But physicists are ingenious; and with the impetus provided by Joseph Weber's pioneering work, and with the support of a broad lay public sincerely interested in pioneering in science, all obstacles will surely be overcome."},{"pageNumber":1069,"pageContent":"§37.10.

TESTING IS EASIER IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM THAN IN REMOTE SPACE For the first half-century of its life, general relativity was a theorist's paradise, but an experimentalist's hell. No theory was thought more beautiful, and none was more difficult to test. The situation has changed. In the last few years general relativity has become one of the most exciting and fruitful branches of experimental physics. A half-century late, the march of technology has finally caught up with Einstein's genius-not only on the astronomical front, but also in laboratory experiments. On the astronomical front, observers search for phenomena in which relativity is important, and study them: cosmology, pulsars, quasars, gravitational waves, black holes. Unfortunately, in pulsars and quasars, and in the sources of cosmological radiation and gravity waves, gravitational effects are tightly interwoven with the local hydrodynamics and local plasma physics. There is little hope of separating the several effects sufficiently sharply to get clean tests of the nature of gravity. Instead, astro- physicists must put the laws of gravity into their calculations along with all the other laws of physics and the observational data; and they must then seek, as output, information about the doings of matter and fields \"way out there.\" Thus, for clean tests of general relativity one turns to the laboratory-but to a laboratory that is much larger today than formerly: a laboratory that includes the entire solar system.

Such a framework must lie outside general relativity. It must scrutinize the foun- dations of Einstein's theory. It must compare Einstein's theory with other viable theories of gravity to see which experiments can distinguish between them. It must be a \"theory of theories.\" At present, in 1973, there are two different frameworks in broad use. One, devised largely by Dicke (1964b),* assumes almost nothing about the nature of gravity. It is used to design and discuss experiments for testing, at a very fundamental level, the nature of spacetime and gravity. Within it, one asks such questions as: Do all bodies respond to gravity with the same acceleration? Is space locally isotropic in its intrinsic properties? What are the theoretical implications of local isotropy? What types of fields, if any, are associated with gravity: scalar fields, vector fields, tensor fields, affine fields? Although some of the experiments that tackle these questions will be discussed below, this book will not attempt a detailed exposition of the Dicke framework. The second framework in broad use is the \"parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism.\" It has been developed to higher and higher levels of sophistication by Eddington (1922), Robertson.(1962), Schiff (1962, 1967), Nordtvedt (1968b, 1969), Will (1971c), and Will and Nordtvedt (1972). The PPN formalism is an approximation to general relativity, and also to a variety of other contemporary theories of gravity, called \"metric theories.\" It is a good approximation whenever, as in the solar system, the sources of the field gravitate weakly (14'11/ c 2 ~ 1) and move slowly (v 2 / c 2 ~ 1). The PPN formalism contains a set of ten parameters whose values differ from one theory to another. Solar-system experiments (measurements of perihelion shift, light deflection, etc.) can be regarded as attempts to measure some of these PPN parameters, and thereby to determine which metric theory of gravity is correct-general relativity, Brans-Dicke (1961)- Jordan (1959) theory, one of Bergmann's (1968) scalar-tensor theories, one of Nordstrom's theories, Whitehead's (1922) theory, or something else. [For reviews of Nordstrom and Whitehead, see Whitrow and Morduch (1965), Will (1971 b), and Ni (1972). For a significant nonmetric theory, see Cartan (1920) and Trautman (1972).] Chapter 39 will discuss the concept of a metric theory of gravity and will construct the PPN formalism; and then Chapter 40 will use the PPN formalism to analyze the systematics of the solar system, and to discuss a variety of past and future experiments that distinguish between various metric theories of gravity. But first, as a prelude to those topics, this chapter will examine experiments that test the foundations of general relativity-foundations on which most other metric theories also rest. For a more detailed discussion of most of these experiments, see Dicke (1964b). §38.2.

TESTS OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE UNIQUENESS OF FREE FALL: EOTVOS-DICKE EXPERIMENT One fundamental building block common to Einstein's theory of gravity and to almost all other modern theories is the principle of \"uniqueness oj Jree Jail\": * \"The world line oj a Jreely Jalling test body is independent oj its composition or structure. \" By \"test body\" is meant an electrically neutral body, small enough that (1) its self-gravitational energy, as calculated using standard Newtonian theory, can be neglected compared to its rest mass (M/ R ~ 1), and (2) the coupling of its multi pole moments to inhomogeneities of the gravitational field can be neglected.t The uniqueness of free fall permits one to regard spacetime as filled with a set of curves, the test-body trajectories, which are unique aside from parametrization. Through each event, along each timelike or null direction in spacetime, there passes one and only one test-body trajectory. Describe these trajectories mathematically: that is a central imperative of any theory of gravity. When translated into Newtonian language, the uniqueness of free fall states that any two test bodies must fall with the same acceleration in a given external gravita- tional field. Experimental tests of this principle search for differences in acceleration from one body to another. The most precise experiments to date are of a type devised by Baron Lorand von Eotvos (Box 38.2), redesigned and pushed to much higher precision by the Princeton group of Robert H. Dicke (Box 38.3), and extended with modifications by the Moscow group of Vladimir B. Braginsky. (See Figure 1.6 and Box 1.2 for experimental details.) These E5tvos-Dicke experiments are \"null experiments.\" They balance the accel- eration of one body against the acceleration of another, and look for tiny departures from equilibrium. The reason is simple. Null experiments typically have much higher precision than experiments measuring the value of a nonzero quantity. Eotvos, Pekar, and Fekete (1922) checked to an accuracy of 5 parts in 10 9 that the Earth imparts the same acceleration to wood, platinum, copper, asbestos, water, magnalium (90% AI, 10% Mg), copper sulphate, and tallow. Renner (1935) checked, to 7 parts in 1010, the Earth's acceleration of platinum, copper, bizmuth, brass, glass, ammonium fluoride, and an alloy of 30% Mg, 70% Cu. Dicke, and later Braginsky, chose to use the sun's gravitational acceleration rather than the Earth's, since the alternation in the direction of the sun's pull every 12 hours lends itself to amplifica- tion by resonance. (See Figure 1.6.) Roll, Krotkov, and Dicke (1964) reported an 38. TESTING THE FOUNDATIONS OF RELATIVITY 1050 Eotvos-Dicke experiment' to test uniqueness of free fall The rest of this chapter is Track 2. No earlier Track-2 material is needed as preparation for it. but Chapter 7 (incompatibility of gravity and special relativity) will be helpful. This chapter is not needed as preparation for any later chapter. but it will be helpful in Chapters 39 and 40 (other theories; PPN formalism; experimental tests). y *R. H. Dicke calls this principle \"The weak equivalence principle.\" We prefer to avoidJconfusion with the equivalence principle (Chapter 16). tIn general relativity, one often uses an alternative definition of test body, which places no constraint on the self-gravitational energy [abandon condition (I) while retaining (2»). Such a definition is preferable, in principle, because the theory of matter has not been developed sufficiently to decide whether (and no objective test has ever been proposed to decide whether), gravitational energy at the su bnuclear scale is a small fraction, a large fraction, or the entirety of the rest mass. But for present purposes a definition constraining test bodies to have M/ R < I is preferable for two reasons. First, most theories of gravity that currently \"compete\" with Einstein's (a) agree with the principle of uniqueness of free fall when the macroscopic, Newtonian, self-gravitational energy is neglected (M/ R < I), but (b) violate that principle when macroscopic, Newtonian self-gravitational energy is taken into account See §40.9 for details. Second, the test bodies used in the EOtvos-Dicke experiment have M/ R so small that their macroscopic, Newtonian, self-gravitational energies are, in fact, negligible (M/ R - Egrav/ M _ 10- 27 )."},{"pageNumber":1079,"pageContent":"Theoretical implications of Eotvos-Dicke experiment 1051 (continued on page 1054) §38.3.

From this agreement, one can infer the response of neutrons, protons, electrons, virtual electron-positron pairs, ·nuclear binding energy, and electrostatic energy to the sun's gravity. Gold is 60% neutrons, while aluminum is only 50% neutrons. Therefore even from the 1964 results one could conclude that neutrons and protons must have the same acceleration to within [0.6 - 0.5 = 0.1]-1 parts in 1011 = 1 part in 1010. Similarly, electrons must accelerate the same as nucleons to 2 parts in 10 7 ; virtual pairs (being more abundant in gold than in aluminum) must accelerate the same to 1 part in 104; nuclear binding energy, to 1 part in 10 7 ; and electrostatic energy to 3 parts in 10 9 • This accuracy of testing gives one confidence in the principle of the uniqueness oj Jreejall.

His 1870 Heidelberg Ph.D. thesis dealt with an issue of relativity: can the motion of a light source relative to an \"ether\" be detected by comparing the light intensities in the direction of the motion and in the opposite direction? Studies of his at the same time resulted in the Eotvos law of capillarity, (surface tension) ;::::; 2.12 (T crit - T)j(specific volume)2/3.

He showed that the so-called \"ratio between gravitational mass and inertial mass\" cannot vary from material to material by more than 5 parts in 10 9 • He investigated the paleomagnetism of bricks and other ceramic objects, and studied the shape of the earth.

He founded a school which trained high-school teachers, to whose leavening influence one can give some of the credit for such outstanding scientists as von Karman, von Neuman, Teller, and Wigner. He served one year as rector of the University of Budapest. \"I can never forget the moment when my train rushed into the railroad station of Heidelberg along the banks of the Neckar . ..

EOrvOS-DICKE EXPERIMENT Box 38.3 ROBERT HENRY DICKE May 6. 1916. St. Louis. Missouri Cyrus Fogg Brackett Professor of Physics at Princeton University During 1941-1946, Dicke was a leader in replacing the outmoded concept of lumped circuit elements by a new microwave analysis based on symmetry considerations, conservation laws, reciprocity rela- tions, and the scattering matrix-concepts that led, among others, to the lock-in amplifier and the microwave radiometer. Searching for a means to reduce the Doppler width of spectral lines for precision measurements, Dicke discovered recoil- less radiation in atomic systems held in a box or in a buffer gas. This development led to (1) the discovery of the basic idea of the gas-cell atomic clock and (2) a much more precise measurement of the gyromagnetic ratio of electrons in the Is and 2s levels of hydrogen and of the hyperfine struc- ture of atomic hydrogen. A fundamental paper by Dicke in 1954 set forth the theory of coherent fadiation processes and of the superradiant state, and laid the foundation for the future development of the laser and the maser, to which he also contributed. His patent no. 2,851,652 (filed May 21,1956) was the first disclo- sure of a device for- the generation of infrared radiation by a coherent process, and supplied the first suggestion for combining the use of an etalon resonator with an amplifying gas. Beginning in the 1960's, Dicke brought his talent for precision measurement to the service of experi- mental cosmology, and with his collaborators: (1) checked the equivalence principle with the up- to-then unprecedented accuracy of 1 part in 10 11 ; (2) determined the solar oblateness; and (3) sug- gested that the primordial cosmic-fireball radia- tion, a tool for seeing deeper into the past history of the universe than has ever before been possible, should be observable, and therefore should be hunted down and found. \"For want of a better term, a gas which is radiating strongly because of coherence will be called 'superradiant.

TESTS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF A METRIC GOVERNING LENGTH AND TIME MEASUREMENTS, AND PARTICLE KINEMATICS Special relativity, general relativity, and all other metric theories of gravity assume the existence of a metric field and predict that this field determines the rates of ticking of atomic clocks and the lengths of laboratory rods by the familiar relation - dr 2 = ds 2 = gaP dx a dx p . The experimental evidence for a metric comes largely from elementary particle physics. It is of two types: first, experiments that measure time intervals directly, e.g., measurements of the time dilation of the decay times of unstable P51rticles;* . 1 t second, expenments that reveal the fundamental ro e played by the Lorentz group in particle kinematics and elsewhere in particle physics.t To cast out the metric tensor entirely would leave one with no theoretical framework adequate for interpreting such experiments. *For a 2 per cent test of time dilation with muons of (I - zr)-1/2 - 12 in a storage ring, see Farley, Bailey, Brown, Giesch, Jostlein, van der Meer, Picasso, and Tannenbaum (1966).

First, they do not guarantee that there exist global Lorentz frames, i.e., coordinate systems extending throughout all of spacetime, in which gap = T/ap. However, they do suggest that at each event tJ' there exist orthonormal frames with eci:(tJ')· ep(tJ') = T/ap, which are related to each other by Lorentz transformations. These orthonormal frames provide one with a definition of the inner product between any two vectors at a given event-and, thereby, they define the metric field. Second, particle experiments do not guarantee that freely falling particles move along geodesics of the metric field, i.e., along straight lines in local Lorentz frames. (Here, in §§38.4 and 38.5, the phrase \"local Lorentz frame\" means a \"normal\" co- ordinate system at an event tJ', in which gaP(tJ') = T/ap and gaP,itJ') = O. The term \"inertial frame\" is avoided because no assertions are made, yet, about test-body motion.) In particular, one does not know from elementary-particle experiments wheth~r the local Lorentz frames in the laboratory are freely falling (so they fly up from the center of the earth and then fall back with Newtonian acceleration g = 980 cm/sec 2 ), whether they are forever at rest relative to the laboratory walls, or whether they undergo some other type of motion. All one is led to believe is that a metric determines the nature of the spacetime intervals (dr 2 = - gp.p dxP. dx P ) measured by atomic clocks, that the various local Lorentz frames in the laboratory therefore move with uniform velocity relative to each other (they are connected by Lorentz transformations), and that electric and magnetic fields and the energies and momenta of particles undergo Lorentz transformations in the passage from one local Lorentz frame to another. Third, elementary particle experiments do suggest that the times measured by atomic clocks depend only on velocity, not on acceleration. The measured squared interval is ds 2 = gap dx a dX P , -independently of acceleration (until the acceleration becomes so great it disturbs the structure of the clock; see §16.4 and Box 16.3). Equivalently, but more physically, the time interval measured by a clock moving with velocity v j relative to a local Lorentz frame is §38.5.

TESTING THE FOUNDATIONS OF RELATIVITY Physical meaning of a comparison between test-body trajectories and geodesics of metric Pound-Rebka-Snider redshift experiment as a test of geodesic motion is also another family of preferred curves, the geodesics of the metric g. It is tempting to identify these geodesics with the test-body trajectories. Einstein's geometric theory of gravity makes this identification (\"equivalence principle\"). One might conceive of theories that reject this identification. What is the experimental evidence on this point? In order to see what kinds of experiments are relevant, it is helpful to elucidate the physical significance of the geodesics. A geodesic of 9 is most readily identified locally by the fact that it is a straight line in the local Lorentz frames. Put differently, a body's motion is unaccelerated as measured in a local Lorentz frame if and only if the body moves along a geodesic of g. Hence, to determine whether test-body trajectories are geodesics, one must compare experimentally the motion of the spatial origin of a local Lorentz frame (as defined by atomic-clock readings) with the motion of a test body (material particle). It is easy to study experimentally the motions of test bodies; relative to an earth- bound laboratory, they accelerate downward with g = 980 cm/sec 2 ; and this accel- eration can be measured at a given location on the Earth to a precision of I part in. 10 6 . Unfortunately, it is much more difficult to measure the motion of a local Lorentz frame, once again as defined by atomic-clock readings. The only direct experimental handle one has on this today, with sufficient precision to be interesting, is gravita- tional redshift experiments. (See §§7.2-7.5 and §25.4 for theoretical discussions of the gravitational redshift in the framework of general relativity.) The redshift experiment of highest precision is that of Pound and Rebka (1960), as improved by Pound and Snider (1965); see Figure 38.1. It used the Mossbauer effect to measure the redshift of 14.4 keY gamma rays from Fe 57 • The emitter and absorber of the gamma rays were placed at rest at the bottom and top of a tower at Harvard University, separated by a height h = 74 feet = 22.5 meters. The meas- ured redshift agreed, to I percent precision, with the general relativistic prediction of L1A/A = gh = 2.5 X 10- 15 • (38.2) This result tells one that the local Lorentz frames are not at rest relative to the Earth's surface; rather, they are accelerating downward with the same acceleration, g, as acts on a free particle (to within 1 percent precision). To arrive at this conclusion, one analyzes the experiment in the laboratory reference frame, where ev~rything (the experimental apparatus, the Earth, the Earth's gravitational field) is static. Relative to the laboratory a local Lorentz frame, momentarily at rest, accelerates downward (horizontal accelerations being ruled out by symmetry) with some un- known acceleration a. Equivalently, the laboratory accelerates upward (in +z direc- tion) with acceleration a relative to the local Lorentz frame. Consequently, the spacetime metric in the laboratory frame has the standard form (38.3)"},{"pageNumber":1085,"pageContent":"4th fl. gr. 69.55' Counts, N Source velocity (V.II - v J ) t Counter for inverted operation Figu re 38.1.

Moreover, in the laboratory frame the metric is static, gravity is static, and the experimental apparatus is static. Therefore the crest of each electro- mag~etic wave that climbs upward must follow a world line t(z) identical in form to the world lines of the crests before and after it; thus, wave crest #0: t = to(z), wave crest # 1: t = to(z) + LIt, wave crest #n: t = to(z) + n LIt. [Here, as in Schild's argument (§7.3) that redshift implies spacetime curvature, no assumption is made about the form of the wave-crest world lines to(z); see Figure 7.1.] Hence, expressed in coordinate time, the interval between reception of successive wave crests is the same as the interval between emission.

After all, how could spacetime possibly be flat if Lorentz frames in Washington, Moscow, and Peking all accelerate toward the Earth's center with g = 980 crn/sec2?] Of all redshift experiments, the Pound-Rebka-Snider experiment is the easiest to interpret theoretically, because it was performed in a uniform gravitational field. Complementary to it is the experiment by Brault (1962), which measured the redshift of the sodium D 1 line emitted on the surface of the sun and received at Earth (Figure 38.2).

TESTING THE FOUNDATIONS OF RELATIVITY Tests of the equivalence principle: (1) geodesic motion §38.6. TESTS OF THE EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE Of all the principles at work in gravitation, none is more central than the equivalence principle. As enunciated in § 16.2, it states: \"In any and every local Lorentz frame, anywhere and anytime in the universe, all the (nongravitational) laws of physics must take on their familiar special-relativistic forms. \" That test bodies move along straight lines in local Lorentz frames (geodesic motion) is one aspect of the equivalence principle. Other aspects are the universality of Maxwell's equations (38.5) in all local Lorentz frames; the universality of the law of local energy-momentum conservation T a f3 - o· .f3 - , (38.6) and the universality of the values of the dimensionless constants that enter into the local laws of physics: (l' = £ = 1 = (electromagnetic fine-); e - nc 137.0360 . . . structure constant mneutron = 1.00138 ... , mproton melectron = -:-::c:-::\"--:l,...\".-_ mproton 1836.12 ... ' etc. (38.7) (2) physical laws are locally Lorentz-invariant (3) laws do not vary from event to event (Attention here is confined to dimensionless constants, since only they are independ- ent of one's arbitrary choice of units of measure.) If one focuses attention on a given event and asks about invariance of the form of the physical laws [equations (38.5), (38.6), etc.] from one Lorentz frame to another, one is then in the province of special relativity. Here a multitude of exp!eriments verify the equivalence principle (see §38.4). If one asks about variations in the form of the laws from one event to another, one opens up a Pandora's box of possibilities that one hardly dares to contemplate. However, no experimental evidence has ever given the slightest warrant to consider any such \"departure from democracy\" in the action of the laws of physics. Moreover, astronomical observations provide strong evidence that the laws of physics are the *For a review of other, less-precise red shift experiments, see Bertotti, Brill, and Krotkov (1962)."},{"pageNumber":1089,"pageContent":"§38.6.

(See, in Box 29.5, Edwin Hubble's expressions of joy upon discovering this.) Constancy of the dimensionless \"constants\" from event to event can be tested to high precision, if one assumes constancy of the physical laws. Dirac (1937, 1938), Teller (1948), Jordan (1955, 1959), Gamow (1967), and others have proposed that the fine-structure \"constant\" a e might be a slowly varying scalar field, perhaps governed by a cosmological equation. However, rather stringent limits on such variations follow from data on the fine-structure splitting of the spectral lines of quasars and radio galaxies.

With a cos- mological interpretation of the quasar redshift, this corresponds to a limit (l/ae)(dae/dt) ~ 1/10 11 years. An even tighter limit has been obtained from radio- galaXy data, where there is no question about the interpretation of the redshift. Bahcall and Schmidt (1967) measured fine-structure splitting in five radio gal- axies with z z 0.20, corresponding to an emission of light 2 X 10 9 years ago. They obtained aiz = 0.20)/aiEarth) = 1.001 -+- 0.002, which yields the limit I (1/a e )(da e /dt)1 ~ 1/10 12 years. Dyson (1972) points out that comparison of the rate of beta decay of Re 187 in times past (via osmium-rhenium abundance ratios in old ores) with the rate of beta-decay today provides .. means to check on any possible variation of a e with time more sensitive than redshift data and more sensitive than any changes in rates of alpha decay and fission between early times and now. He summarizes the available data on Re 187 and arrives at the limit For further evidence of the constancy of the fundamental constants see Minkowski and Wilson (1956), Dicke (1959a,b), Dicke and Peebles (1962b). Spatial variations of ae' mneutron/mproton' and other \"constants\" in the solar system can be sought by means of Eo tv os-type experiments. The reasoning [by Dicke (1969)] leading from such experiments to limits on any spatial variation of the constants is indirect. It recalls the reasoning used in standard treatises on polar molecules to deduce the acceleration of a polarizable molecule pulled on by an inhomogeneous electric field. It proceeds as follows. Suppose one of the dimensionless \"constants,\" \"a,\" depends on position. This will lead to a position-dependence of the total mass-energy of a laboratory test body. For example, if a e depends on position, then the coulomb energy of an atomic nucleus will also (E COU1 ex: e 4 ex: a/; oM/ E cou1 = 2oa e /a e ). One can calculate the change in a test body's mass-energy when it is moved from xll- to xll- + oxll- by assuming no change at all in the body's structure during its displacement: (4) fundamental constants do not vary from event to event Eotvos-type experiments as tests for spatial variation of fundamental constants oM = (ilM/ila)fixedstructure(ila/ilxll-) oxll-.

TESTING THE FOUNDATIONS OF RELATIVITY may cause a change in structure, but that change will be accompanied by a con- version of internal potential energy into internal kinetic energy, which conserves M. Now consider the following thought experiment [an elaboration of the argument by which Einstein first derived the gravitational redshift (§7.2)]: Take n particles, each with mass-energy JL. Make the particles with a structure such that a negligible fraction of JL is associated with the \"constant\" of interest, ex: (l/JL)(oJLloex) = o. (38.9) Place these particles at a height h in a (locally) uniform Newtonian field. Combine them together there, releasing binding energy EB(h), to form a composite body of mass which depends in a significant manner on the \"constant\" ex, (II M)(oMloex) i O.

In contrast, \"free\" fall of the assembled body M is not really free fall, because of the supplementary \"polarization force\" pulling on this object. Hence the assembled body in \"free\" fall experiences an acceleration, a, a little different from g. However, the mass that is accelerated is precisely M, and therefore the force required to produce this acceleration is given by the product Ma. The energy gained in lowering the body and the bag is E(down) = F oh = Ma oh + EB(h)g oh. Put this energy in the bag.

Coulomb energy, which is proportional to a/, amounts in a gold nucleus to 0.4 per cent of the mass, and to 0.1 per cent in an aluroin urn nucleus. Hence, a spatial variation in a e should lead to a fractional difference in the gravitational accelerations of these two nuclei equal to i.e., ~ I dae I ~ 1 X 10- 9 g::::::.; 1 X 10- 9 cm/sec 2 = 1 X 1O- 30 /cm a e dh at the Earth due to the sun.

TESTS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF UNKNOWN LONG-RANGE FIELDS Whether or not one accepts the assumption that test bodies move on geodesics of the metric, it remains conceivable that previously unknown long-range fields (fields with \"l/r\" fall-off at large distances) are somehow associated with gravity. If \"new\" long-range fields (not metric, not electromagnetic) do exist, waiting to be discovered, then there are two ways by which they could influence matter. First, they could couple directly to matter, producing, for example, slight deviations from geodesic motion (deviations smaller than the limits of §38.5), or slight dependences of masses of particles on position (dependences smaller than the limits of §38.6). Second (and harder to detect), they could couple indirectly to matter by being mere possible existence of new long-range fields associated with gravity Direct vs. indirect coupling"},{"pageNumber":1092,"pageContent":"y 1064 38. TESTING THE FOUNDATIONS OF RELATIVITY Experimental limits on direct-coupling fields: (1) Hughes-Drever experiment (2) ether-drift experiments participants in field eq uations that determine the geometry of spacetime. This section will describe tests for direct-coupling effects. Theories with fields that couple indi- rectly will be described in Box 39.1, and tests for such fields will be discussed in Chapter 40. Dicke (l964b), using his framework for analyzing tests of gravitation theories (§38.2), has shown that several null experiments place stringent limits on unknown, direct-coupling, long-range fields. One of these experiments is the \"Hughes-Drever Experiment\" [Hughes, Robinson, and Beltran-Lopez (1960); Drever (1961)]. It can be thought of as a search for a symmetric second-rank tensor field h a (3 that produces slight deviations of test-body trajectories from geodesics of the metric ga(3. Unless one's experiments happen to be made in a region of spacetime where h a (3 is a constant multiple of ga(3 (\"mere rescaling of all lengths and times by a constant factor\"), this tensor field must produce anisotropies in the properties of spacetime-which, in tum, will cause anisotropies in the inertial mass of a nucleon, and in tum will cause in an atomic nucleus relative shifts of degenerate energy levels with different magnetic quantum numbers. The Hughes-Drever experiment places stringent limits on such shifts, and thereby on a possible tensor field haW To quote Dicke (1964, p. 186), \"If two [tensor] fields are present with the one strongly anisotropic in a coordinate system chosen to make the other isotropic, the strength of [direct] coupling to one must be only of the order of 10- 22 that of the other. ... [Moreover], on the moving Earth with ever-changing velocity, anisotropy would be expected at some season.\" From the experiments of Hughes and Drever, then, one concludes that there is not the slightest evidence for the presence of a second tensor field. For further details see Dicke and Peebles (1962a). Another series of experiments, called \"ether-drift experiments,\" places stringent limits on any unknown, long-range vector field that couples directly to mass-energy. One can imagine such a field of cosmological origin. Being cosmological, the 4-vector would most naturally be expected to point in the same direction as the 4-vector u of the \"cosmological fluid\" (identical with the time direction eo of a frame in which the cosmic microwave radiation is isotropic). The 4-vector of the new field would then have spatial components in any other frame. In principle an observer could use them to discern his direction of motion and speed relative to the mean rest frame of the universe. The ether-drift experiments search for effects of such a field. For example, the experiment of Turner and Hill (1964) searches for a dependence of clock rates on such a vector field, by examining the transverse Doppler~shift as a function of direction for an emitter on the rim of a centrifuge and a receiver at its center (Figure 38.3).

OTHER THEORIES Role of alternative gravitation theories as foils for experimental tests Criteria for viability of a theory: (1) self-consistency Among all bodies of physical law none has ever been found that is simpler or more beautiful than Einstein's geometric theory of gravity (Chapters 16 and 17); nor has any theory of gravity ever been discovered that is more compelling. As experiment after experiment has been performed, and one theory of gravity after another has fallen by the wayside a victim of the observations, Einstein's theory has stood firm. No purported inconsistency between experiment and Einstein's laws of gravity has ever surmounted the test of time. Query: Why then bother to examine alternative theories of gravity? Reply: To have \"foils\" against which to test Einstein's theory. To say that Einstein's geometrodynarnics is \"battle-tested\" is to say it has won every time it has been tried against a theory that makes a different prediction. How then does one select new antagonists for decisive new trials by combat? Not all theories of gravity are created equal. Very few, among the multitude in the literature, are sufficiently viable to be worth comparison with general relativity or with future experiments. The \"worthy\" theories are those which satisfy three criteria for viability: self-consistency, completeness, and agreement with past experi- ment. Self-consistency is best illustrated by describing several theories that fail this test. The classic example of an internally inconsistent theory is the spin-two field theory of gravity [Fierz and Pauli (1939); Box 7.1 here], which is equivalent to linearized general relativity (Chapter 18). The field equations of the spin-two theory imply that all gravitating bodies move along straight lines in global Lorentz reference frames, whereas the equations of motion of the theory insist that gravity deflects"},{"pageNumber":1095,"pageContent":"§39.2. METRIC THEORIES OF GRAVITY 1067 bodies away from straight-line motion. (When one tries to remedy this inconsistency, one finds oneself being \"bootstrapped\" up to general relativity; see route 5 of Box 17.2.) Another self-inconsistent theory is that of Kustaanheimo (1966). It predicts zero gravitational redshift when the wave version of light (Maxwell theory) is used, and nonzero redshift when the particle version (photon) is used. Completeness: To be complete a theory of gravity must be capable of analyzing from \"first principles\" the outcome of every experiment of interest. It must therefore mesh with and incorporate a consistent set of laws for electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and all other physics. No theory is complete if it postulates that atomic clocks measure the \"interval\" dr = (- gafJ dx a dx fJ )1/2 constructed from a particular metric. Atomic clocks are complex systems whose behavior must be calculated from the fundamental laws of quantum theory and electromagnetism. No theory is com- plete if it postulates that planets move on geodesics. Planets are complex systems whose motion must be calculated from fundamental laws for the response of stressed matter to gravity. For further discussion see §§16.4, 20.6, and 40.9. Agreement with past experiment: The necessity that a theory agree, to within several standard deviations, with the \"four standard tests\" (gravitational redshift, perihelion shift, electromagnetic-wave deflection, and radar time-delay) is obvious. Equally obvious but often forgotten is the need to agree with the expansion of the universe (historically the ace among all aces of general relativity) and with observations at the more everyday, Newtoni~n level. Example: Birkhoff's (1943) theory predicts the same redshift, perihelion shift, deflection, and time-delay as general relativity. But it requires that the pressure inside gravitating bodies equal the total density of mass-energy, p = p; and, as a consequence, it demands that sound waves travel with the speed of light. Of course, this prediction disagrees violently with experiment. Therefore, Birkhoff's -theory is not viable. Another example: Whitehead's (1922) theory of gravity was long considered a viable alternative to Einstein's theory, because it makes exactly the same prediction as Einstein for the \"four standard tests.\" Not until the work of Will (197lb) was it realized that Whitehead's theory predicts a time-dependence for the ebb and flow of ocean tides that is completely contradicted by everyday experience (see §40.8). §39.2. METRIC THEORIES OF GRAVITY Two lines of argument narrow attention to a restricted class of gravitation theories, called metric theories. The first line of argument constitutes the theme of the preceding chapter. It examined experiment after experiment, and reached two conclusions: (1) spacetime possesses a metric; and (2) that metric satisfies the equivalence principle (the standard special relativistic laws of physics are valid in each local Lorentz frame). Theories of gravity that incorporate these two principles are called metric theories. * In brief, Chapter 38 says, \"For any adequate description of gravity, look to a metric theory.\" *For a slightly narrower definition of metric theories, see Thorne and will (1971).

OTHER THEORIES OF GRAVITY AND POST-NEWTONIAN APPROXIMATION Exception: Cartan's (1922b, 1923) theory [\"general relativity plus torsion\"; see Trautman (1972)] is nonmetric, but agrees with experiment and is experimentally indistinguishable from general relativity with the technology of the 1970's. The second line of argument pointing to metric theories begins with the issue of completeness (preceding section). To be complete, a theory must incorporate a self-consistent version of all the nongravitationallaws of physics. No one has found a way to incorporate the rest of physics with ease except to introduce a metric, and then invoke the principle of equivalence. Other approaches lead to dismaying complexity, and usually to failure of the theory on one of the three counts of self-consistency, completeness, and agreement with past experiment. All the theories known to be viable in 1973 are metric, except Cartan's. [See Ni (1972b); Will (1972).] In only one significant way do metric theories of gravity differ from each other: their laws for the generation of the metric. In general relativity theory, the metric is generated directly by the stress-energy of matter and of nongravitational fields. In Dicke-Brans-Jordan theory (Box 39.1, p. 1070), matter and nongravitational fields generate a scalar field 1>; then 1> acts together with the matter and other fields to generate the metric. Expressed in the language of §38.7, 1> is a \"new long-range field\" that couples indirectly to matter. As another example, a theory devised by Ni (1970, 1972) (Box 39.1) possesses a flat-space metric 11 and a universal time coordinate t (\"prior geometry\"; see §17.6); 11 acts together with matter and nongrav- itational fields to generate a scalar field 1>; and then 11, t, and 1> combine to create the physical metric 9 that enters into the equivalence principle. All three of the above theories-Einstein, Dicke-Brans-Jordan, Ni-were viable in the summer of 1971, when this section was written. But in autumn 1971 Ni's theory, and many other theories that had been regarded as viable, were proved by Nordtvedt and Will (1972) to disagree with experiment. This is an example of the rapidity of current progress in experimental tests of gravitation theory! Henceforth, in this chapter and the next, attention will be confined to metric theories of gravity and their comparison with experiment. §39.3.

Such a \"weak-field, slow-motion expansion\" gives: (1) flat, empty spacetime in \"zero order\"; (2) the Newtonian treatment of the solar system in \"first order\"; and (3) post-Newtonian corrections to the Newtonian treatment in \"second order\". The formalism of Newtonian theory plus post-Newtonian corrections is called the \"post-Newtonian approximation.\" Each metric theory has its own post-Newtonian approximation. Despite the great differences between metric theories themselves, their post-Newtonian approximations are very similar. They are so similar, in fact, that one can construct a single post-Newtonian theory of gravity, devoid of any reference to indirectly coupling fields (</> in Dicke-Brans-Jordan; 11, t, and </> in Ni; see Box 39.1), that contains the post-Newtonian approximation of every conceivable metric theory as a special qlse. This all-inclusive post-Newtonian theory is called the \"Parametrized Post-Newtonian (P P N) Formalism.\" It contains a set of parameters (called \"P PN parameters\") that can be specified arbitrarily. One set of values for these parameters makes the PPN formalism identical to the post-Newtonian limit of general relativity; another set of values makes it the post-Newtonian limit of Dicke-Brans-Jordan theory, etc. Subsequent sections of this chapter present a version of the PPN formalism devised by Clifford M. Will and Kenneth Nordtvedt, Jr. (1972). [See also Will (1972).] This version, containing ten PPN parameters, encompasses as special cases nearly every metric theory of gravity known to the authors. The few exceptions [Whitehead (1922) and theories reviewed by Will (1973)] all disagree with experiment. One can include them in the PPN formalism by adding additional terms and parameters. The ten parameters are described heuristically in Box 39.2, for the convenience of readers who would skip the full details of the formalism (§§39.4-39.12). How accurate is the PPN formalism? Or, stated more precisely, how accurately does the post-Newtonian approXimation agree with the metric theory from which it comes? In the solar system, where 14'1, v 2 , l1}kl/P o ' and II are all ~ 10- 6 , the post-Newtonian approximation makes fractional errors of ~ 10- 6 in quantities of post-Newtonian order, and fractional errors of ;S 10- 12 in quantities of Newtonian order.

This post-Newtonian approximation can then be used (and has been used extensively) to calculate general relativistic corrections to such phenomena as the structure and stability of stars. * Historical and Notational Notes The earliest parametrizations of the post-Newtonian approximation were performed, and used in interpreting solar system experiments, by Eddington (1922), Robertson (1962), and Schiff (1962, 1967). However, they dealt solely with the vacuum gravita- tional field outside an isolated, spherical body (the sun). Nordtvedt (1968b, 1969) devised the first full PPN fOrmalism, capable of treating all aspects of the solar -~~. --- system; he treated the sun, planets, and moon as made from \"gases\" of point-particles (atoms) that interact gravitationally and electromagnetically. Will (197lc) later used techniques devised by Chan<Jrasekhar (1965a) to modify Nordtvedt's formalism, so that it employs a stressed, continuous-matter description of celestial bodies.

This chapter is not needed as preparation for any later chapter, but it will be helpful in Chapter 40 (solar-system tests) Description of matter (In this sense the PPN formalism is like linearized theory; see Chapter 18.) The velocity of the coordinate system (i.e., 4-velocity of its spatial origin) is so chosen that the solar system is approximately at rest in these coordinates. (Whether the center of mass of the solar system is precisely at rest, or is moving with some low velocity v ~ (M 0 / R 0 )l/2 - 10- 3 - 300 km/sec, is a matter for the user of the formalism to decide. For more on the options, see §§39.9 and 39.12.) The PPN coordinates provide one with a natural \"3 + 1\" split of spacetime into space plus time. That split is conveniently treated using the notation of three-dim en- sional, flat-space vector analysis-even though spacetime and the three-dimensional hypersurfaces xO = constant are both curved. The resultant three-dimensional for- malism will look more like Newtonian theory than like general relativity-as, indeed, one wishes it to; after all, one's goal is to study small relativistic corrections to Newtonian theory! §39.5. DESCRIPTION OF THE MAnER IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM Relative to the PPN coordinates, the matter of the solar system (idealized as a stressed medium) has a coordinate-velocity field V j = dx/dxo.

Orient the spatial axes ej of this comoving frame so that they coincide as accurately as possible with the PPN coordinate axes. (This requirement will be made more precise in §39.10.) In the orthonormal comoving frame, define the following quantities, which describe the state of the matter: (density of total mass-energy) .

(39.6)"},{"pageNumber":1103,"pageContent":"For many purposes, especially inside the sun, one can ignore the anisotropies, thereby approximating the solar-system matter as a perfect fluid.* The isotropic part of the radiation field gives a significant contribution to the pressure, p, and the density of internal energy, Poll, inside the Sun. However, the anisotropic radiation flux is ignored in the stress-energy tensor. This approximation is allowable because in the sun the outward energy flux carried by radiation is less than 10- 15 of the internal energy density poll; in planets it is even less. §39.6. NATURE OF THE POST-NEWTONIAN EXPANSION 1075 §39.6.

Moreover, changes with tim~ of all quantities at fixed x j are due primarily to the motion of the matter.

Consequently, the radiation zone must be excluded from the analysis when one makes a post-Newtonian expansion. To treat it requires different techniques, e.g., those of Chapter 36. Conditions 39.7 and 39.8 suggest that one expand the metric coefficients in powers Rules of the expansion of the small parameter f, treating U, v 2 , p/p o ' Ii/Po' and II as though they were all of 0(f2) (often they are smaller!), and treating time derivatives as O(f) smaller than space derivatives. In this \"post-Newtonian\" expansion, terms odd in f (i.e., terms such as J Po(x', I)Vj(x', I) d 3 M 3 X'--V-f Ix- x'i R (39.9) whose total number of v's and (a/al)'S is odd) change sign under time reversal, • In the solar system, post-Newtonian corrections due to anisotropic stresses are so much smaller than other post-Newtonian corrections that there is no hope of measuring them in the 1970's.

Time reversal (xu = _X O ) also changes the sign of gOj(gOj = - gOj)' but leaves goo and gjk unchanged. Therefore, gOj must contain only terms odd in f; whereas goo and gjk must contain only even terms. (Actually, this ceases to be the case when radiation damping enters the picture. In the real world-one always insists on outgoing-wave boundary conditions. But time reversal converts outgoing waves to ingoing waves; so an extra sign change is required to convert back to out. Therefore, radiation damping terms in the near-zone metric are even in f for gOj' but odd for goo and gjk. However, radiation damping does not come into play until order f5 beyond Newtonian theory-see Chapter 36-so it will be ignored here.)

VELOCITY OF PPN COORDINATES RELATIVE TO \" \"UNIVERSAL REST FRAME\" Thus far it has been assumed tacitly that the center of mass of the solar system is at rest in the PPN coordinate system. Is this really a permissible assumption? Put differently, can one always so adjust the PPN coordinate system that its origin moves with any desired velocity (e.g., that of the solar system); or is the PPN coordinate system rigidly and irrevocably attached to some \"universal rest frame\"? In general relativity, the geometry of curved spacetime picks out no preferred coordinate frames (except in cases with special symmetry). Therefore, one expects the velocity of the PPN coordinate frame to be freely specifiable. Put differently, one expects the entire PPN formalism, for general relativity, to be invariant under Lorentz transformations of the PPN coordinates [combined, perhaps, with \"in- finitesimal coordinate transformations\" to maintain the gauge conditions that the \"I\" and \"U;k\" terms of (39.24) and (39.23a) be absent]. By contrast, in Ni's theory of gra vity (Box 39.1) the geometry of spacetime always picks out a preferred coordi- nate frame: the \"rest frame of the universe.\" One would not be surprised, in this case, to find the PPN coordinate frame rigidly attached to the universal rest frame. The above intuition is correct, according to calculations by Will (1971d) and by Will and Nordtvedt (1972). When dealing with general relativity and other theories with little or no \"prior geometry,\" one can freely specify the velocity of the PPN coordinate system (at some initial instant of time). But for theories like Ni's, with a preferred \"universal rest frame\" (\"preferred-frame theories\"), only in the preferred frame can the post-Newtonian metric assume the form derived in the last section [equations (39.23)]. This restriction on the PPN metric does not mean that one is confined, in preferred-frame theories, to perform all calculations in the universal rest frame. Rather, it means that for such theories the PPN metric requires generali- zation to take account of coordinate-frame motion relative to the universal rest frame. The required generalization can be achieved by subjecting the PPN metric (39.23) to (1) a Lorentz boost from the preferred frame {x'OLD} to a new PPN frame {x~lEw}' which moves with velocity w, plus (2) a change of gauge designed to keep the metric coefficients as simple as possible.

SUMMARY OF PPN FORMALISM §39.12. RELATION OF PPN COORDINATES TO SURROUNDING UNIVERSE 1091 One crucial issue remains to be clarified: What is the orientation of the PPN coordi- nate system relative to the surrounding universe? More particularly: Does the PPN coordinate system rotate relative to the \"fixed stars on the sky;\" or is it \"rigidly attached\" to them, in some sense? In order to answer this question, imagine using the PPN formalism to analyze the solar system. Make no assumptions about the solar system's velocity through the PPN coordinate frame. Then, as one moves outward from the Sun, past the Earth's orbit, past Pluto's orbit, and on out toward interstellar space, one sees the PPN coordinate frame become more and more Lorentz in its global properties [ga,8 = 1J a ,8 + O(M 0 /r)]. Thus, far from the solar system the PPN coordinates become a \"Lorentz frame moving through the galaxy.\" This means, of course, that the spatial axes of the PPN coordinate frame behave as though they were attached to gyroscopes far outside the solar system. Equivalently: The PPN coordinate system Fermi-Walker-transports its spatial axes through the spacetime geometry of the galaxy and universe. §39.13.

MANY EXPERIMENTS OPEN TO DISTINGUISH GENERAL RELATIVITY FROM PROPOSED METRIC THEORIES OF GRAVITY This chapter analyzes experiments using PPN formalism Complexity of solar system's spacetime geometry No audience will show up for a fight if in everyone's eyes the challenger has zero chance to win. No battle-hungry promoter desperately trying to finance the fight can afford to put into the ring against the champion-any but the best contender that he can find. Against Einstein's metric theory of gravity, the judgment of the day (as §39.2 showed) leaves one no option except to put up another theory of gravity that is also metric (or metric plus torsion). To put on a contest, then, is to design and perform an experiment that distinguishes general relativity from some not completely implausible metric theory of gravity. This chapter describes such experiments--some already performed; some to be performed in the future-and analyses their significance using the PPN formalism of Chapter 39. In most of the experiments to be described, one investigates the motion of the moon, planets, spacecraft, light rays, or gyroscopes through the spacetime geometry of the solar system. That spacetime geometry is very complicated. It includes the spherical fields of the sun and all the planets, nonspherical fields due ~o their quadrupolar and higher-order deformations, and fields due to their momentum and angular momentum. Moreover, the spacetime geometry results-or at least in the post-Newtonian formalism it is viewed as resulting-from a nonlinear superposition of all these fields. * * Of course, from the point of view of Einstein's full general relativity theory, all that legalistically counts is the one and only curved-spacetime geometry of the real physical world. All these \"individual fields\" are mere bookkeepers' discourse, and they are best abandoned (they cease to be useful) when one passes from the post-Newtonian limit to the full Einstein theory."},{"pageNumber":1125,"pageContent":"Fortunately for this discussion, several of the most important experiments are free of almost all these complications. The effects they measure are associated entirely with the spherical part of the sun's gravitational field. A description of these experi- ments will come first (§§40.2-40.5), and then attention will tum to experiments that are more complex in principle. To discuss central-field experiments, one needs an expression for the external gravitational field of an idealized, isolated, static, spherical sun. In general relativity, such a gravitational field is described by the Schwarzschild line element, §40.1. EXTERNAL FIELD OF SUN 1097 Idealization of geometry to that of isolated. static. spherical sun: (1) in Schwarzschild coordinates But this line element is not what one wants, for two reasons: (1) it is \"too accurate\"; (2) it is written in the \"wrong\" coordinate system. r Why too accurate? Because it is simple only when unperturbed and unmodified; whereas some modified theories show up new effects that are so complex they are tractable only in the post-Newtonian approximation. Why wrong coordinate system? Because physicists, astronomers, and other celestial mechanics have adopted the fairly standard convention of using \"isotropic coordinates\" rather than \"Schwarzs- child coordinates\" when analyzing the solar system. Example: post-Newtonian expansions, including the PPN formalism of Chapter 39, almost always use isotropic coordinates. Another example: the relativistic ephemeris for the solar system, pre- pared by the Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory [Ohandley et al. (1969); Anderson (1973)] and used extensively throughout the world, employs isotropic coordinates. Modify the Schwarzschild'line element, then. First transform to isotropic coordi- nates (Exercise 31.7); then expand the metric coefficients in powers of M 0 /r, to post-Newtonian accuracy:-Thereby obtain ds 2 = - [1 - 2 ~0 + 2 (~0 fJ dt 2 + [1 + 2 ~0 J [dr 2 + r 2 (d0 2 + sin 2 0 dIf>2)] 2 (40.1) = - [ 1- 2 ~0 + 2 (~0) J dt 2 + [1 + 2 ~0 J [dx 2 + dyZ + dz 2 ].

(The reader who has not studied §39.6 will discover in the next section why one keeps terms of order M 0 2/ r 2 in goo but not in gjk') Note: this post- Newtonian expression for the metric is a special case of the result derived in exercise 19.3. If one calculates the gravitational field of the same source (the sun) in the same post-Newtonian approximation in other metric theories of gravity, one obtains a very similar result:"},{"pageNumber":1126,"pageContent":"1098 40. SOLAR· SYSTEM EXPERIMENTS (3) in PPN formalism (see exercise 40.1). Here y and f3 are two of the ten PPN parameters described in Box 39.2. Recall from that box that y measures \"the amount of space curvature produced by unit rest mass,\" while f3 measures \"the amount of nonlinearity in the superposition law for goo'\" These heuristic descriptions find their mathematical counterparts in the above form for the idealized metric surrounding a spherically symmetric center of attraction. By measuring the parameter y to high precision, one can distinguish between general relativity (y = 1) and the Dicke-Brans-Jordan theory [y = (1 + w)j(2 + w), where w is the \"Dicke coupling constant\"]; see Box 39.2. But general relativity and Dicke-Brans-Jordan predict the same value for f3 (f3 = 1). This identity does not mean that f3 is unworthy of measurement. A value f3 ::j: 1 is predicted by other theories [see Ni (1972)]; so measurements of f3 are useful in distinguishing such theories from general relativity. Actually, the above form (40.3) for the sun's metric is not fully general. In any theory with a preferred \"universal rest frame\" (e.g., Ni's theory; Box 39.1), there are additional terms in the metric due to motion of the sun relative to that preferred frame (exercise 40.1): (4) including preferred-frame M (1 ) M effects ds 2 = (expression·40.3) + (0: 2 + 0: 3 - 0: 1 ) ----f w 2 dt 2 +2 0: 2 - 2\" 0: 1 ---!- w;dx; dt -0: 2 [~0 x;x k - ~~ (x;xk - ~ r 2 8;k) ] w; dt(2 dx k + w k dt).

(Theories such as general relativity and Dicke-Brans-Jordan, which possess no preferred frame, have 0: 1 = 0: 2 = 0: 3 = 0, and therefore have no preferred-frame terms in the metric.)

For further discussion see exercises 40.9 and 40.10 below.) §40.2. THE USE OF LIGHT RAYS AND RADIO WAVES TO TEST GRAVITY In the Newtonian limit, pla;J.etary and spacecraft orbits are strongly influenced by gravity; but light propagation and radio-wave propagation (at \"infinite\" velocity) are not influenced at all. For this reason, experimental studies of orbits are beset by the problem of separating the relativistic effects from much larger standard Newtonian effects. By contrast; experimental studies of light and radio-wave propa- gation do not contend with ~my such overpowering Newtonian background. Not surprisingly, they are to date (1973) the clearest and most definitive of the solar- system experiments. Mathematically, the parameter that distinguishes a light ray from a planet is its high speed. In the geodesic equation, the magnitude of the velocity determines which metric coefficients can influence the motion. Consider, for example, a weak, static field gaf3 = 1J a f3 + h af3 , and a particle at (x, y, z) = (r, 0, 0) moving with velocity (v\"\" Vy' v z ) = (0, v,O); see Figure 40.1.

Note that here y is a PPN parameter; it is not (1 - V~-l/2. Notice what happens as one boosts the velocity of the particle. For slow velocities [v 2 - (post-Newtonian expansion parameter €2) ;:::: M 0 /R 0 ], the Newtonian part of h oo dominates completely; and the tiny post-Newtonian corrections come equally from the €4 part of h oo , the €3 part of hOi' and the €2 part of h ik . [This was the justification for expanding h oo to 0(€4), hOi to 0(€3), and h ik to 0(€2) in the post- Newtonian limit; see §39.6.] But as v increases, the ordering of the terms changes. In the high-v regime (v - I ~ €2), the bending of the trajectory has become almost imperceptible because of the high forward momentum of the particle and the short time it receives transverse momentum from the sun. What bending is left is due to the €2 (Newtonian) part of h oo ' and the €2 (post-Newtonian) part of h ik . Nothing else can have a significant influence. Notice, moreover, that-even when onf allows for \"preferred-frame\" effects-these dominant terms, Light rays are governed solely by Newtonian potential and PPN parameter y depend only on the Newtonian potential U= -iP and the PPN parameter y. This is a special case of a more general result: Aside from fractional corrections of €2 ~ 10- 6 , relativistic effects on light and radio-wave propagation are governed entirely by the Newtonian potential U and the PPN parameter y.

LIGHT DEFLECTION 1101 §40.3. \"L1GHT\" DEFLECTION Consider a light or radio ray coming into a telescope on Earth from a distant star Light deflection: or quasar. Do not assume, as in the usual discussion (exercises 18.6 and 25.24), that the ray passes near the sun. The deflection by the sun's gravitational field will probably be measurable, in the middle or late 1970's, even when the ray passes far from the sun! [The calculation that follows is due to Ward (1970), but Shapiro (1967) first derived the answer.] Orient the PPN spherical coordinates of equation (40.3) so that the ray lies in (1) derivation the \"ptane\" 0 = 'fT/2. By symmetry, if it starts out in this plane far from the Earth, it must lie in this plane always. Let the incoming ray enter the solar system along the line <p = 0; and let the Earth be located at r = r E , <p = <PE when the ray reaches it. (See Figure 40.2.) One wishes to calculate the angle a between the incoming light ray and the center of the sun, ~s measured in the orthonormal frame (e;, e:;,) of an observer on Earth. If the sun had zero mass (flat, Euclidean space), a would be 'fT - <P-E (see Figure 40.2). However, the sun produces a deflection: a = 'fT - <PE + Sa. The deflection angle Sa is the true objective of the calculation. In the calculation, ignore the Earth's orbital and rotational motions. They lead to aberration, for which correction can be made by the usual formula of special relativity (Lorentz transformation in the neighborhood of the telescope.) Also ignore deflection of the light ray due to the Earth's gravitational field (deflection angle -- 2 M E / R E -- 0\".0003), which might be detectable in the late 1970's. t .......

SOLAR-SYSTEM EXPERIMENTS As the first step in calculating the deflection angle, determine the trajectory of the ray in the r, <1>-plane. This can be calculated either using the geodesic equation, or using the eikonal method of geometric optics (Hamilton-Jacobi method; §22.5 and Box 25.4). The result of such a calculation (exercise 40.2) is an equation con- necting r with <1>; thus, b . (1 + y)M -; = Sin <1> + b 0 (1 - cos <1». (40.6) Notice that b has a simple geometric interpretation: far from the sun, the ray trajectory is <1> = b/r + O(M 0 b/r 2 ). Consequently, b is the impact parameter in the usual sense of classical scattering theory (see Figure 40.2). The ray makes its closest approach to the sun (assuming it is not intercepted by the Earth first) at the PPN coordinate radius = b [I _ (1 + Y)M 0 ] - b r m1n b _. (40.7) Thus, b can also be thought of as the radius of the ray's \"perihelion.\" Notice that the ray returns to r = 00, not at an angle <1> = 'fT, but rather at <1>(r = 00) = 'fT + 2(1 + y)Mdb. Thus, the total deflection angle is (40.8a) (angle of total deflection) = 2(1 + y)M 0 /b I . (40.8b) = \"2 (1 + y)l \".75 for a ray that just grazes the sun. But this is not the quantity of primary interest. Rather, one seeks the position of the star as seen by an astronomer on Earth. The angle a = 'fT - <1>E + Sa between the sun and the star as measured by the astronomer is given by (see Figure 40.2) tan('fT - <1>E + Sa) = -tan <1>E + Sa/cos 2 <1>E = ~ = [(1 + yM 0 /r)rd<1>/dA] = [rd<1>] (40.9) u r (1 + yM 0 /r) dr/dA E dr E = _ [(b/r) d<1>] , d(b/r) E where u f3 = dx f3 IdA are the components of a tangent to the ray at the Earth.

They show that the PPN parameter y has its general relativistic value of 1 to within an uncertainty of about 20 percent. By the middle or late 1970's, measurements of the deflection of radio waves from quasars should determine y to much better than 1 percent. Also, by that time radio astronomers may be making progress toward setting up high-precision coordinates on the sky using very long baseline interferometry. If so, they will have to use equation (40.11) to compensate for the \"warping\" of the coordinates caused by the sun's deflection of radio waves in all regions of the sky, not just near the solar limb.

Lists of all the results and references are given by Bertotti, Brill and Krotkov (1962), and by Kliiber (1960). Dicke (l964b) sum- marizes the results as follows: \"The analyses [of the experimental data] scatter from a deflection at the limb of the sun of 1.43 seconds of arc to 2.7 seconds [compared to a general relativistic value of 1.75 seconds].

The monitoring uses radio interferometers.

Let a radar transmitter on Earth send a radio wave out to a reflector elsewhere in the solar system, and let the reflector return the wave to Earth. Calculate the round-trip travel time, as measured by a clock on Earth. For simplicity of calculation, idealize both Earth and reflector as nonrotating and as at rest in the static, spherical gravitational field of the Sun. At the end of the calculation, the effects of rotation and motion will be discussed separately. Also ignore time dilation of the transmitter's clock due to the Earth's gravitational field; it is easily corrected for, and it is so small that it will not come into play in these radar experiments before the middle or late 1970's. The gravitational effects of the other planets on the radio waves are too small to be discernible in the foreseeable future, unless the beam grazes the lim b of one of them. However, the effects of dispersion in the solar wind and corona are discernible and must be corrected for. These corrections will not be discussed here, since they are free of any general-relativistic influence. The calculation of the round-trip travel time can be simplified by using a general- relativistic version of Fermat's principle: In any static field (goi = 0, gap,o = 0) consider all null curves between two points in space, xi = a i and xi = b i . Each such null curve, xi(t), requires a particular coordinate time interval Lit to get from a i to b i . The curves of extremal Lit are the null geodesics of spacetime. The proof of this theorem is outlined in exercise 40.3. Because of Fermat's principle, the lapse of coordinate time between transmission of the radar beam and reflection at the reflector, t TR , is the same for a straigft path in the PPN coordinates as for the slightly curved path which the beam actually follows. (The two differ by a fractional amount LltTR/t TR - (angle of deflec- tion? ~ 10- 12 , which is far from discernable.) Hence, in the computation one can ignore the gravitational bending of the beam. Adopt Cartesian PPN coordinates with the sun at the origin; the transmitter, sun, and reflector in the z = 0 \"plane\"; and the transmitter-reflector line along the x direction (see Figure 40.3).

Any reader is reasonable who objects to the form (40.14) in which the time-delay has been written. The quantities a R , a1\" and b are coordinate positions in the PPN coordinate system, rather than numbers the astronomer can measure directly. They differ from coordinate ~~itigns in other, equally good coordinate systems by amounts of the order of M 0 - 1.5 km. The objection is not mathematical in its origin. The quantities a R , a1\" and b are perfectly well-defined [with post-post-Newtonian uncertainties of order b(M 0 /b)Z ~ 10- 6 kmj, because the PPN coordinate system is perfectly well-defined. But they are not quantities which the experimenter can measure directly, with precision anywhere near that required to test the relativistic terms in the time-delay formula (40.14). In practice, fortunately, the experimenter does not need to measure a R , a1\" or b with high precision. Instead, he checks the time-delay formula by measuring the changes in LIT as the Earth and reflector move in their orbits about the Sun; Le., he measures LIT as a function of Earth-based time T.

Such a long \"arc\" of data is needed to determine the reflector's orbit with high precision, and to take full advantage of the slow, logarithmic falloff of Lh with b (40.14). When the beam is far from the sun (b ~ Rd, the simplifying assumptions behind equation (40.15) are not valid; and the relativistic time-delay gets intertwined with the orbital motions of the Earth and the reflector. The. analysis then remains straightforward, but its details are so complex that one resorts to numerical integrations on a computer to carry it out. Because the orbital motions enter, the time-delay data then contain information about other metric parameters (f3 is the dominant one) in addition to y.

The constant 8<po merely makes the ellipse precess: for r to go through a complete circuit, from perihelion to aphelion to perihelion again, (1 - 8<po/2'fT)<p must change by 2'fT; so <p must change by 2'fT + 8<po. Thus, the perihelion shifts forward by an angle 8<po with each circuit around the ellipse. Relative to what does the perihelion shift?

PERIHELION SHIFT IN GEODESIC ORBITS 1111 The perihelion shift is not the only rela tivistic effect contained in the orbital motion for a test body. There are other effects, but they are all periodic rather than cumula- tive with time; so, with the limited technology of the pre-space-age era, it was impossible to detect them. But the technology of the 1970's is bringing them within reach. Moreover, many space-age experiments are necessarily of short duration (~ one orbit)-particularly those involving spacecraft and transponders landed on planets. For these, the periodic perturbations in an orbit are of almost as much experimental valu_e-1l~ the Cu_ml!l£itive perihelion shift. The periodic effects are not obvious in the PPN orbital equation (40.17); it looks like the simplest of precessing ellipses. But the quantities the observer measures directly are not a, e, and 8<po. Instead, he measures the time evolution of round-trip radar travel times, .1r(T), and of angular positions on the sky [Oo( T), <Po( T )]. To compute these quantities is perfectly straightforward in principle, but in practice is a very complex task. The calculations predi! relativistic effects periodic with the frequency of the orbit and all its har- monics. The amplitudes of these effects, for the lower harmonics, must obviously be of the order of M 0 - I km - 10 p.sec - 0\".01 arc on the sky. (The distance M 0 = 1.48 km is the characteristic length for all relativistic effects in the sun's spherical field!) The most favorable orbits for experimental tests of the perihelion shift and of periodic effects are those that go nearest the sun and have the highest eccentricity [see equation (40.18)]-the orbits of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and the asteroid Icarus. But how does one know that these orbits are geodesics? After all, planets are not \"test bodies\"; they themselves produce nonnegligible curvature in spacetime. It turns out (see §40.9 for full discussion) that there should exist tiny deviations from geodesic motion, but they are too small to compete with the perihelion shift or with the periodic effects disciiSs\"e<fabove, at least for these five bodies. Extensive astronomical observations of planetary orbits, dating back to the mid- nineteenth century and aided by radar since 1966, have yielded accurate values for planetary perihelion shifts (accurate to ±0.4 seconds of arc per century for Mercury).

SOLAR·SYSTEM EXPERIMENTS Box 40.3 PERIHELION SHIFTS; EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Relativistic corrections to Newtonian theory are not the only cause of shift in the perihelion of a planetary orbit. Any departure of the Newtonian gravitational field from its idealized, spherical, inverse-square-Iaw form also produces a shift. Such nonsphericities and resulting shifts are brought about by (1) the gravitational pulls of other planets, and (2) deformation of the sun (\"solar oblateness\"; \"quadrupole moment\"). In addition, when the primary data are optical posi- tions of planets on the sky (right ascension and declination as functions of time), there is an ap- parent perihelion shift caused by the precession of the Earth's axis (\"general precession\"; observer not on a \"stable platform\"; see exercise 16.4). The perihelion shifts due to a general precession and to the gravitational pulls of other planets can be calculated with high precision. But in 1973 there is no fully reliable way to determine the solar quadrupole moment. It is conventional to quantify the sun's quadrupole moment by a dimensionless parameter J 2 , which appears in the following ex- pression for the Newtonian potential, U = ~0 [I _ J 2 ~~2 C cos~ - I ) l If the sun were rotating near breakup velocity, J 2 would be near 1. Very careful measurements of the optical shape of the sun [Dicke and Golden- berg (1967)] show a flattening, which suggests J 2 may be near 3 X 10- 5 • The total perihelion shift produced by relativity plus solar quadrupole moment is (see exercise 40.5) The Haystack radar antenna, which Irwin Shapiro and his group have used to collect extensive data on the systematics of the inner part of the solar system. Those data are rapidly becoming the most important source of information about perihelion shifts. (Picture courtesy of Lincoln Laboratories, MIT.) Note that relativistic and quadrupole shifts have different dependences on the semimajor axis a and ecentricity e of the orbit. This difference in depen- dence allows one to obtain values for both tte quadrupole moment parameter J 2 , and the PPN parameter i(2 - f3 + 2y) by combining measure- ments of 8<p for more than one planet.

Looking toward the future, one cannot expect data on orbits of spacecraft to give decisive tests of general relativity, despite the high precision (-10 meters in 1972) with which spacecraft can be tracked. Spacecraft are buffeted by the solar wind. They respond to fluctuations in this wind and in the pressure of solar radiation, and respond also to \"outgassing\" from leaky jets. Unless one can develop excellent \"drag-free\" or \"conscience-guided\" spacecraft, one must therefore continue to rely on planets as the source of data on geodesics. However, planetary data themselves can be greatly improved in the future by placing radar transponders on the surfaces of planets or in orbit about them, by improvements in radar technology, and by the continued accumulation of more and more observations.

It is not needed as prepara- tion for any later chapter. 3-body effects in lunar orbit: (1) theory (2) prospects for measurement For the significance of this result, see Box 40.3. §40.6. THREE-BODY EFFECTS IN THE LUNAR ORBIT The relativistic effects discussed thus far all involve the spherical part of the sun's external gravitational field, and thus they can probe only the PPN parameters f3 and y plus the \"preferred-frame\" parameters aI' a 2 , and a 3 . Attempts to measure other PPN parameters can focus on three-body interactions (discussed here), the dragging of inertial frames by a rotating body (§40.7), anomalies in the locally measured gravitational constant (§40.8), and deviations of planetary and lunar orbits from geodesics (§40.9). There is no better place to study three-body interactions than the Earth-moon orbit. The pulls of the Earth, the moon, and the sun all contribute. Perturbations in the motion of Earth and moon about their common center of gravity can be measured with high precision using laser ranging (earth~m6on separation measured to -10 cm in early 1970's) and using a radio beacon on the moon's surface (angular position on sky potentially measurable to better than 0\".001 of arc). Over and above any Newtonian three-body interactions, the Earth and the sun, acting together in a nonlinear manner, should produce relativistic perturbations in the lunar orbit that are barely within the range of this technology. These effects depend on the familiar parameters y (measuring space curvature) and f3 [measuring amount of nonlinear superposition, (U Earth + U sun )2, in goo]. In addition, they depend on f3 2 , which regulates the extent to which the sun's potential, U sun ' acting inside the Earth, affects the strength of the Earth's gravitational pull, causing it to vary as the Earth moves nearer and farther from the sun. These effects are expected to depend also on r, .1 1 ' and .1 2 , which regulate the extent to which the Earth's orbital momentum and anisotropies in kinetic energy (caused by the sun) gravitate. Bromberg (1958), Baierlein (1967), and Krogh and Baierlein (1968) have calculated the three dominant three-body effects in the Earth-moon orbit using general relativity and the Dicke-Brans-Jordan theory. These effects are noncumulative and have amplitudes of -100 cm, -20 em, and -10 cm. The 100-cm effect [which was originally discovered by de Sitter (1916)] is known to depend only on y. The precise dependence of the other effects on the PPN parameters is not known. The prospects for measuring these effects in the 1970's are dim; they are masked by peculiarities in the orbit of the moon that have nothing to do with relativity."},{"pageNumber":1145,"pageContent":"§40. 7. THE DRAGGING OF INERTIAL fRAMES §40.7. THE DRAGGING OF INERTIAL FRAMES 1117 The experiments discussed thus far study the motion of electromagnetic waves, spacecraft, planets, and asteroids through the solar system. An entirely different type Gyroscope precession: of experiment measures changes in the orientation of a gyroscope moving in the gravitational field of the Earth. This experiment is particularly important because it can measure directly the \"dragging of inertial frames\" by the angular momentum of the Earth. It is useful, before specializing to a rotating Earth, to derive a general expression for the precession of a gyroscope in the post-Newtonian limit. (Track-l readers, and others who have not studied Chapters 6 and 39, may have difficulty following the derivation. No matter. It is the answer that counts!) Let sa be the spin of the gyroscope (i.e., its angular momentum vector), and let (1) general analysis u a be i!s 4-velocity. The spin is always orthogonal to the 4-velocity, sa ua = 0 (see Box 5.6). Assume that any nongravitational forces acting on the gyroscope are applied at its center of mass, so that there is no torque in its proper reference frame. Then the gyroscope will \"Fermi-Walker transport\" its spin along its world line (see §6.5): a = VuU = 4-acceleration. (40.27) The objective of the calculation is to write down and analyze this transport equation in the post-Newtonian limit. The gyroscope moves relative to the PPN coordinate grid with a velocity v j = dx j Idt = dx;Jdt. Assume that v j :S f, where f is the post-Newtonian expansion parameter (f 2 :::: Mol R o )' As the gyroscope moves, it carries with itself an orthonor- mal frame e \"\" which is related to the PPN coordinate frame by a pure Lorentz boost, plus a renormalization of the lengths of the basis vectors [transformation (39.41 )]. The spin is a purely spatial vector (SO = 0) in this comoving frame; its length (SjSj)1/2 remains fixed (conservation of angular momentum); and its direction is regulated by the Fermi-Walker transport law. The basis vectors e\", of the comoving frame are not Fermi-Walker transported, by contrast with the spin. Rather, they are tied by a pure boost (no rotation!) to the PPN coordinate grid, which in turn is tied to an inertial frame far from the solar system, which in turn one expects to be fixed relative to the \"distant stars.\" Thus, by calculating the precession of the spin relative to the comoving frame, (40.28) one is in effect evaluating the spin's angular velocity of precession, il j , relative to a frame fixed on the sky by the distant stars.

Equations (40.33) describe in complete generality at the post-Newtonianilevel of approximation the precession of the gyroscope spin S relative to the comoving ortho- normal frame that is rotationally tied to the distant stars. For an electron with spin S in orbit around a proton, only the first term, -!v X a, is present (no gravity). This term leads to the Thomas precession, which plays an important role in the fine structure of atomic spectra [see, e.g., Ruark and Urey (1930)]. For other ways of deriving the Thomas precession, see exercise 6.9 and §41.4. The Thomas precession comes into play for a gyroscope on the surface of the Earth (a = Newtonian acceleration of gravity), but not for a gyroscope in a freely moving satellite."},{"pageNumber":1147,"pageContent":"If one ignores the rotation of the Earth and preferred-frame effects, and puts the PPN coordinate frame at rest relative to the center of the Earth, then gOj vanishes and 0 is given by §40. 7.

(40.35) The general-relativistic precession ~v X V U was derived by W. de Sitter (1916) for the \"Earth-moon gyroscope\" orbiting the sun. Eleven years later L. H. Thomas (1927) derived the special relativistic precession -~v X a for application to atomic physics. The Earth's rotation produces off-diagonal terms, gOj' in the PPN metric (exer- (5) specialization: precession cise 40.7): due to Earth's rotation (40.36) Here J is the Earth's angular momentum. These off-diagonal terms contribute an amount (40.37) -- to the precession of the gyroscope. Notice that this contribution, unlike the others, is independent of the linear velocity of the gyroscope. One can think of it in the following way. The gyroscope is rotationally at rest relative to the inertial frames in its neighbor- hood. It and the local inertial frames rotate relative to the distant galaxies with the angular velocity 0 because the Earth's rotation \"drags\" the local inertial frames along with it. Notice that near the north and south poles the local inertial frames rotate in the same direction as the Earth does (0 parallel to J), but near the equator they rotate in the opposite direction (0 anti parallel to J; compare 0 with the magnetic field of the Earth!). Although this might seem paradoxical at first, an analogy devised by Schiff makes it seem more reasonable. * Consider a rotating, solid sphere immersed in a viscous fluid. As it rotates, the sphere will drag the fluid along with it. At various points in the fluid, set down little rods, and watch how the fluid 'This analogy can be made mathematically rigorous; see footnote on p. 255 of Thome (1971); see also, §21.12 on Mach's principle."},{"pageNumber":1148,"pageContent":"1120 40. SOLAR-SYSTEM EXPERIMENTS rotates them as it flows past. Near the poles the fluid will clearly rotate the rods in the same direction as the star rotates. But near the equator, because the fluid is dragged more rapidly at small radii than at large, the end of a rod closest to the sphere is dragged by the fluid more rapidly -than the far end of the rod. Conse- quenfly, the rod rotates in the direction opposite to the rotation of the sphere. In order of magnitude, the precessional angular velocity caused by the Earth's rotation is {} - lEI R1- 0.1 seconds of arc per year. (40.37') (6) prospects for measuring precession EXERCISES Both this precession, and the larger one [equation (40.35)] due to motion through the Earth's static field, may be detectable in the 1970's. Equipment aimed at detecting them via a satellite experiment is now (1973) under construction at Stanford Univer- sity; see Everitt, Fairbank, and Hamilton (1970); also O'Connell (1972).* The gyroscope precession produced by motion of the Earth relative to the preferred frame (if any) is too small to be of much interest. • The dragging of inertial frames by a rotating body plays important roles elsewhere in gravitation physics, e.g., in the definition of angular momentum for a gravitating body (§19.2), and in black-hole physics (Chapter 33). The effect was first discussed and calculated by Thirring and Lense (1918). More recent calculations by Brill and Cohen (1966) of idealized situations where the effect may be large give insight into the mechanism of the effect. See also the discussion of Mach's principle in §21.12. Exercise 40.6. PRECESSIONAL ANGULAR VELOCITY- Derive equations (40.33) for the precession of a gyroscope in the post-Newtonian limit.

SPIN-CURVATURE COUPLING Consider a spinning body (e.g., the Earth or a gyroscope or an electron) movin& through curved spacetime. Tidal gravitational forces produced by the curvature of spacetime act on the elementary pieces of the spinning body. These forces should depend not only on the positions of the pieces relative to the center of the object, but also on their relative velocities. Moreover, the spin of the body, s = J (pr X v) d(volume) in co moving orthonormal frame, is a measure of the relative positions and velocities of its pieces. Therefore one expects the spin to couple to the tidal gravitational forces-i.e., to the curvature of spacetime-producing"},{"pageNumber":1149,"pageContent":"deviations from geodesic motion. Careful solution of the PPN equations of Chapter 39 for general relativity reveals [Papapetrou (1951), Pi rani (1956)] that such coupling occurs and causes a deviation of the worldline from the course that it would otherwise take; thus, §40.8. IS THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT CONSTANT? 1121 (40.39) Evaluate, in order of magnitude, the effects of the supplementary term on planetary orbits in the solar system. [Answer: They are much too small to be detected. However, there are two other material places to look for the effect: (I) when a rapidly spinning neutron star, or a black hole endowed with substantial angular momentum enters the powerful tidal field of another neutron star or black hole; and (2) when an individual electron, or the totality of electrons in the \"Dirac sea of negative energy states,\" enter a still more powerful tidal field (late phase of gravita- tional collapse). Such a tidal field, or curvature, pulls oppositelY on electrons with the two opposiit directions of spin [Pirani (1956); DeWitt (1962), p. 338; Schwinger (1963a,b)] just as an electric field pulls oppositely on electrons with the two opposite signs of charge [\"vacuum polarization\"; see especially Heisenberg and Euler (1936)]. In principle, the tidal field pulling on the spin of an electron need not be due to \"background\" spacetime curvature; it might be due to a nearby massive spinning object, such as a \"live\" black hole (chapter 33) [\"gravitational spin-spin coupling\"; O'Connell (1972)]. §40.8. IS THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT CONSTANT? The title and subject of this section are likely to arouse confusion. Throughout this book one has used geometrized units, in which G = c = 1. Therefore, one has locked oneself into a viewpoInt that forbids asking whether the gravitational constant changes from event to event. False! One can perfectly well ask the question in the context of G = c = 1, if one makes clear what is meant by the question. In §§ 1.5 and 1.6, c was defined to be a certain conversion factor between centi- meters and seconds; and G/c 2 was defined to be a certain conversion factor between grams and centimeters. These definitions by fiat do not guarantee, however, that a Cavendish experiment* to measure the attraction between two bodies will yield If general relativity correctly describes classical gravity, and if the values of the conversion factors G and c have been chosen precisely right, then any Cavendish experiment, anywhere in the universe, will yield \"Force = -m 1 m 2 /r 2 \". But if the • See any standard textbook for a description of Cavendish experiments. By his original version of the experiment, with two separated spheres suspended by fine wires, Henry Cavendish (1798) inferred the mass and hence the density of the Earth. He reported: \"By a mean of the experiments made with the wire first used, the density of the Earth comes out 5.48 times greater than that of water; and by a mean of those made with the latter wire it comes out the same; and ... the extreme results do not differ from the mean more than 0.38, or 1/14 of the whole.\" The most precise method of measuring G today [Rose et af.

In some theories, such as Dicke-Brans-Jordan, the Cavendish constant is deter- mined by the distribution of matter in the universe. As a result, the expansion of the universe changes its value: I dG c (0.1 to I) - I G c --;]'t -- - age of universe -- 1010 or 1011 years [see, e.g. Brans and Dicke (1961 )]. A variety of observations place limits on such time variations. Big time changes in G c during the last 4.6 billion years would have produced marked effects on the Earth, the sun, and the entire solar system. The expected geophysical effects have been summarized and compared with observations by Dicke and Peebles (1965). It is hard to draw firm conclusions because of the complexity of the geophysics involved, but a fairly certain limit is (I/GC>(dGc/dt) ~ 1/10 10 years (geophysical). (40.42 a) Eventually, high-precision measurements of the orbital motions of planets will yield a better limit. For the present, planetary observations show (l/GC>(dGc/dt) ~ 4/10 10 years (planetary orbits) (40.42b) Spatial variations in G c [Shapiro, Smith, et al. (1971 )]. These limits are tight enough to begin to be interesting, but not yet tight enough to disprove any otherwise viable theories of gravity. If G c is determined by the distribution of matter in the universe, then it should depend on where in the universe one is, as well as when. In particular, as one moves from point to point in the solar system, closer to the Sun and then fartlfer away, one should see G c change. Indeed this is the case in most metric theories of gravity, though not in general relativity. Analyses of Cavendish experiments using the PPN formalism reveal spatial variation in G c given by L1G c = -2G c (f3 + y - f3 2 - l)U (40.43) [Nordtvedt (1970, 197Ia); Will (197Ib)].

Despite great ingenuity and effort, the most accurate experiments measuring the value of G c have precisions in 1972 no better than I part in 10 4 [see Beams (1971)].

For Cavendish experiments with two equal masses separated by distances large compared to their sizes, G c varies as §40.8.

Here v is the velocity of the Cavendish apparatus relative to the preferred frame, and n is the unit vector between the two masses.

However, other theories with universal rest frames-e.g. Papapetrou's (1954a,b,c) theory-are ruled out by this limit; see Ni (1972), Nordtvedt and Will (1972).] Whitehead's theory of gravity (which is a two-tensor theory with a rather different type of prior geometry from Ni's) predicts that the galaxy should produce velocity- independent anisotropies in G c .

DO PLANETS AND THE SUN MOVE ON GEODESICS? Crucial to solar-system experiments is the question of whether the sun and the planets move on geodesics of spacetime. This question is complicated by the contributions to the spacetime curvature made by the moving body itself. To elucidate the question-and to obtain an answer in the framework of general relativity-consider an \"Einstein elevator\" type of argument. The astronomit:al object under consideration has an outer boundary, and each point on this boundary describes a world line. These world lines define a world tube. Some distance outside of this world tube construct a \"buffer zone\" as in §20.6. Tailor its inner and outer dimensions, according to the mass and moments of the object and the curvature of the enveloping space (\"strength of the tide-producing force of the external gravi- tational field\"), in such a way that the departure ( (cf. §20.6) of the metric from flatness in this buffer zone takes on values equal at most to twice the extremal achievable value (extrem (a minimum with respect to variations in r, a maximum"},{"pageNumber":1155,"pageContent":"§40.9.

Then, apart from errors of order fextrem' the object can be regarded as moving in an asymptotically flat space. The law of conservation of total4-momentum applies. It assures one that the object moves in a (locally) straight line with uniform velocity. Consider, next, a \"background geometry\" that agrees just outside the buffer zone with the actual geometry to accuracy f extrem or better, but that inside is a source-free solution of Einstein's field equation. Then, to an accuracy governed by the magnitude of f extrem , the locally straight line along which the astronomical object moves will be a geodesic of this background geometry. Insofar as one can give any well-defined meaning to the departure of the actual motion from this geodesic (a task complicated by the fact that the background geometry does not actually exist!), one can calculate this departure by making use of the fPN formalism or some other approximation scheme [see, e.g., Taub (1965)]. This deviation springs ordinarily in substantial measure, and sometimes almost wholly, from a coupling between the Riemann curvature tensor of the external field and the multipole moments of the astronomical object (angular momentum associ- ated with rotation; quadrupole and higher moments associated with deformation; see, e.g., exercises 40.8 and 16.4). This coupling is important for the Earth-moon system, but one need not use relativity to calculate it; Newtonian theory does the job to far greater accuracy than needed-or would, if one understood the interiors of the Earth and the moon well enough! For the planets and sun, the effect is negligible. (Exercise: use Newtonian theory to prove so!). Thus, in general relativity as applied to the solar system, one can approximate the orbit of the sun, the Earth-moon mass center, and each other planet, as a geodesic of that \"background spac~time geometry\" which would exist if its own curvature effects were absent. This is the approach used to analyze the perihelion shift for planets in §40.5 in the context of general relativity, and to derive in exercise 39.15 the post-Newtonian \"many-body equations of motion.\" In most other metric theories of gravity, including the Dicke-Brans-Jordan theory, there are substantial departures from geodesic motion. The \"Einstein elevator\" argument fails in these theories because spacetime is endowed not only with a metric, but also with a long-range field that couples indirectly (cf. §§38.7 and 39.2) to massive, gravitating bodies. This phenomenon is best understood in terms of Dicke's argument about the influence of spatial variations of the fundamental constants on experiments of the Eotvos-Dicke type (see §38.6). In a theory where the Cavendish gravitational constant G c depends on position (as it does not and cannot in general relativity), a body with significant self-gravitational energy Egrav must fall, in a perfectly uniform external Newtonian gravitational field, with an anomalous acceleration: Deviations from geodesic motion: (1) due to curvature coupling (2) due to spatial dependence of gravitational constant (Nordtvedt effect) ( acceleration Of) _ (aCCeleration Of) = ~(aEgrav) VG c massive body test body M aGc = Egrav VG MG c c (40.54)"},{"pageNumber":1156,"pageContent":"1128 40. SOLAR-SYSTEM EXPERIMENTS Nordtvedt effect in Earth-moon orbit [see equation (38.15)]. In Dicke-Brans-Jordan theory, G c is essentially the reciprocal of the scalar field; and it contains a small part that is proportional to the Newtonian potential, U [equation (40.43) with the appropriate values of the parameters from Box 39.2]. As a result, the sun falls with an acceleration smaller by one part in 10 6 than the acceleration of a test body; Jupiter falls with an acceleration one part in 10 9 smaller; and the Earth, one part in 10 10 smaller. Translated into relativistic language: the scalar field, by influencing the gravitational self-energy of a massive body, produces deviations from geodesic motion. One can use the full PPN formalism of Chapter 29 to calculate the motion of massive bodies in any metric theory of gravity. Nordtvedt (l968b) and Will (l971a) have done this. They find that a massive body at rest in a uniform external field experiences a (Newtonian-type) PPN coordinate acceleration given by where E jk is a quantity depending on the body's structure: E jk = 8 jk { 1 - (7 .1 1 - 30y - 4/3) E mav } - (2/3 + 2/3 2 - 30y + .1 2 - 2) ~k , (40.55) g. = _ ~f Pop~(Xj - xj)(x k - x k ) d 3 d 3 ' E = \"\" goo Jk 2 /X-X'/3 X x, gray L.\" 11' Here m is the body's total mass-energy, gjk is the \"Chandrasekhar potential-energy tensor,\" and Egrav is the body's self-gravitational energy. [Note: Dicke's method of calculating the anomalous acceleration (40.54) breaks down !n theories that are not \"conservative\" (Box 39.5).] In general relativity, the combinations of PPN coefficients appearing in E jk vanish; so E jk = 8 jk , and the body falls with the usual acceleration-i.e., it moves along a geodesic. But in most other theories of gravity E jk ::P 8 jk ; the body does not move on a geodesic; and its acceleration may even be in a different direction than the gradient of the Newtonian potential! This predicted departure from geodesic motion is called the UNordtuedt effect.\" - The possibility of such an effect was first noticed in passing by Dicke (1961c), but was discovered independently and explored in great detail by Nordtvedt (1968a,b). The Nordtvedt effect in a theory other than general relativity produces a number of phenomena in the solar system that are potentially observable. [See Nordtvedt (1971 b) for an enumeration and references.] The effect most suitable for a test is a \"polarization\" of the Earth-moon orbit due to the fact that the moon should fall toward the sun with a greater acceleration than does the Earth. This \"polarization\" results in an eccentricity in the orbit that points always toward the Sun and has the amplitude"},{"pageNumber":1157,"pageContent":"8r = 840 [3oy + 4[3 - 7.1 1 - j (2[3 + 2[32 - 30y + .1 2 - 2)] em (40.56) = 67 meters in Ni's theory (Boxes 39.1 and 392) = ~ meters in Dieke-Brans-Jordan theory (Boxes 39.1 and 39.2) 2+\", = 0 in Einstein's theory. §40.9.

In November 1971, there were three such refiectors on the moon: two American, and one French-built and Soviet-landed. A pulsed ruby laser projects a beam out of the 107 -inch reflecting telescope of the McDonald Observatory of the University of Texas, on Mount\"Locke, 119 miles east of El Paso. This beam makes a spot of light on the moon's surface about 3.2 km in diameter. Laser light is bounced straight back to the earth by the \"laser ranging retroreflectors\" (LR3). Each consists of an aluminum panel of 46 cm by 46 cm with 100 fused silica comer cubes each 3.8 cm in diameter. The first reflector ever set up appears in the first inset, near the lunar landing mOdule. It is tilted with respect to the landscape of the moon. The photograph was made shortly before astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., took off for the earth. The second inset is a photograph made by D. G. Currie of the field of view in the guiding eyepiece of the McDonald 107-inch telescope in an interval when the laser was not firing at the Apollo 11 site. One guides the telescope to Tranquility Base (small circle) by aligning flducial marks on more visible moonscape features. In November 1971, the LR~ experiment and continuing time-of-fiight measurements were the responsibility of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and a Lunar Retroreflecting Ranging Team of representatives from several centers of research. One of the members of this team, Carroll Alley, of the University of Maryland, is hereby thanked for his kindness in providing the photographs used in this montage. Thanks to this NASA work, the distance between the laser source on the earth and the reflectors on the moon is known with an accuracy now better than half a meter. The astronauts left behind on the moon not only LR3 and a seismometer and other equipment, but also a plaque: \"We came in peace for all mankind.\" By the mid 1970's, lunar laser-ranging data will probably be able to determine the amplitudes of this polarization to a precision of one meter or better [see Bender et al.

A rotation described by R 1 followed by a rotation described by R z gives a net change in orientation described by the single rotation (41.4) This is Hamilton's formula for the combination of two rotations -(steps towarn--n-- by Euler in 1776; obtained by Gauss in 1819 but never published by him).

The combination of the two reflections in the two planes separated by the angle 8/2 produces the same end result (transformation from A to C) as rotation through the angle 8 about the line PQ. According to Hamilton's rule (41.3), this result implies a net rotation through 120° abo\\lt a line that makes equal angles with the x-axis, the y-axis, and the z-axis, in conformity with what one already saw in Figure 41.1 (axis of rotation running from center of cube through the comer A). What one has just done in the special example one can do in the general case: obtain the parameters 0a, aa, f3 a , Ya of the net rotation (four unknowns!) by identify- ing the four coefficients of the four Hamilton units 1, - ia z ' - ia ll , - ia z on both sides of the equation R a = RzR 1 • In this way one arrives at the four prequatemion formulas of Olinde Rodrigues (1840) for the combination of the two rotations. Why do half-angles put in an appearance? And what is behind the law of combi- nation of rotations? The answer to both questions is the same: a rotation through the angle 0 about a given axis may be visualized as the consequence of successive reflections in two planes that meet along that axis at the angle 0/2 (Figure 41.2). Two rotations therefore. imply four reflections. However, it can be arranged that reflections no. 2 and no. 3 take place in the same plane, the plane that includes the two axes of rotation. Then reflection no. 3 exactly undoes reflection no. 2. By now there remain only reflections no. 1 and no. 4, which together constitute one rotation: the net rotation that was desired (Figures 41.3 and 41.4). The rotation c R = cos (0/2) - i sin (0/2)(a z cos a + all cos f3 + a z cos y) is undone by the inverse rotation R-l = cos (0/2) + i sin (0/2)(a z cos a + all cos f3 + a z cos y).

This preces- sion accounts for a factor two in the effective energy of coupling of spin and orbital angular momentum of an atomic electron. In a nucleus it contributes a little to the coupling of the spin and orbit ofa nucleon. The evaluation of the Thomas precession affords an illustration of spin-matrix methods in action. The precession in question can be discussed quite without reference either to angular momentum or to mass in motion. It is enough to consider a sequence of inertial frames of reference Set) with these two features. (1) To whatever point the motion has taken the mass at time t, at that point is located the origin of the frame Set). (2) The inertial frame Set + dt) at the next succeeding moment has undergone no rotation with respect to the inertial frame Set), as rotation is conceived by an observer in that inertial frame. However, it has undergone a rotation (\"Thomas precession\") as rotation is conceived and defined in the laboratory frame of reference. How is it possible for \"no rotation\" to appear as \"rotation\"? The answer is this: one pure boost, followed by another pure boost in another direction, does not have as net result a third pure boost; instead, the net result is a boost plus a rotation. This idea is not new in kind. Figure 41.1 illustrated how a rotation about the z-axis followed by a rotation about the x-axis had as resultant a rotation about an axis with not only an x-component and a z-component but also a y-component. What is true of rotations is true of boosts: they defy the law for the addition of vectors. Let the frame So coincide with the laboratory frame, and let the origin of this laboratory frame be where the moving frame is at time t. Let Set) be a Lorentz frame moving with this point at time t. Let one pure boost raise its velocity relative to the laboratory from 13 to 13 + df3. The resulting final configuration cannot be reached from So by a pure boost. Instead, first turn So relative to the laboratory frame (\"rotation R associated with the Thomas precession\") and then send it by a simple boost to the final configuration. Only one choice of this rotation will be right to produce match-up. Thus, distinguishing the spin matrices for pure boosts and pure rotations by the letters Band R, one has the relation Origin of Thomas precession: composition of two boosts is not a pure boost Derivation of Thomas precession using spin matrices 1146 B(f3 + df3)R(w dt) = \"B(df3)\"B(f3) 41.

It appears as a pure boost only in the comovin r frame. Take care of the second difficulty first. It is only a difficulty because the fotmalism for combination of transformations, R a = R 2 R l , as developed in §41.1 presupposes all operations R l , R 2 , •.• , to be defined and carried out in the laboratory reference frame. In contrast, the quantity \"B(df3)\" is understood to imply a pure boost as defined and carried out in the comoving frame. Such an operation can be fitted into the formalism as follows.

It is also a pure boost in the spin-matrix formalism. Then transform back from laboratory to moving frame. Thus have the relation \"B(df3)\" = B(f3)B(acomoving dT)B-l(f3). The equation for the determination of the Thomas precession now reads B(f3 + df3)R(w dt) = B(f3)B(acomoving dT) or, with all unknowns put on the left, R(w dt)B-l(a como ving dT) = B-l(f3 + df3)B(f3).

Now rotate the cube through 2'lT = 360 0 • The threads become tangled. Nothing one can do will untangle them. It is impossible for every .thread to proceed on its way in a straight line. Now rotate the cube about the same axis by a further 2'lT. The threads become still mure tangled. However, a little work now completely straightens out the tangle (Figure 41.6). Every thread runs as it did in the beginning in a straight line from its corner of the cube to the corresponding corner of the room. More generally, rotations by 0, -+-4'lT, -+-8'lT, ... , leave the cube in its standard \"orienta- tion-entanglement relation\" with its surroundings, whereas rotations by -+-2'lT, -+-6'lT, -+-1O'lT, ... , restore to the cube only its orientation, not its orientation-entanglement relation with its surroundings. Evidently there is something about the geometry of orientation that is not fully taken into account in the usual concept of orientation; hence the concept of \"orientation-entanglement relation\" or (briefer term!) \"version\" (Latin versor, turn). Whether there is also a detectable difference in the physics (contact potential between a metallic object and its metallic surroundings, for exam- ple) for two inequivalent versions of an object is not known [Aharonov and Susskind (1967)].

The 4-vector is also unaffected by the choice of the angle o. In other words, this null 4-vector is uniquely fixed by the spinor; but the spinor is not fixed with all uniqueness by the 4-vector. To a given 4-vector corresponds a whole family of spinors. They differ from one another by a multiplicative phase factor of the form e iu (\"flag factor\"). Looking further to see the influence of the flag factor showing up, turn from a real vector (four components) generated out of the spinor ~A to a real bivector (six components) generated out of the same spinor: . .

To unfold the meaning of this bivector, look in (41.88) for every app~arance of the alternating factor fAB. Wherever such a factor appears, insert the expression (41.84) for this factor in terms of the starting spinor ~A and insert the additional spinor 1jA that is needed, along with ~A, to supply a basis for all spinors.

Turn now to an application where not all that informa- tion is needed. Look at the night sky and ask (1) how to describe its appearance and (2) how to change that appearance. As one way to describe its appearance, give the direction of each star. Abandon any concern about the distance of the star, and any concern about any rotation 1/J about the flagpole. In other words, the complex factor common to ~1 and ~2 drops from attention. All that is left as significant is the ratio r of these spinor components: Spinors used to analyze \"Lorentz transformations\" of appearance of night sky r = ~2/~1 = tan (O/2)e i r/>. (41.100) To give the one complex number r (\"stereographic coordinate;\" Figure 41.8) for each star in the sky is to catalog the pattern of the stars. Let the observer change his stance. The celestial sphere appears to rotate. Or let him rocket past his present location in the direction of the North Star with some substantial fraction of the velocity of light. To him all that portion of the celestial sphere is opened out, as if by a magnifying glass. To compensate, the remaining stars are packed into a smaller angular compass.

SPINORS implies a transformation of the complex stereographic coordinate of any given star of the form (41.102) In the special case of a boost in the z-direction with velocity parameter a (velocity f3 = tanh a), the off-diagonal components Liz and L2 1 vanish. The magnification of the overhead sky then expresses itself in the simple formula or 4>new = 9, tan (Onew/2) = e Q tan (0/2). (41.103) Contrary to this prediction and false expectation, no magnification at all is achieved of the regions around the North Star by moving with high velocity in that direction. On the contrary, any photon coming in from a star a little off that direction, with a little transverse momentum, keeps that transverse momentum in the new frame; but its longitudinal momentum against the observer is augmented by his motion. Thus the ratio of the momenta is decreased, and the observed angle relative to the North Star is also decreased. The consequence is not magnification, but diminution (\"looking through the wrong end of a telescope\"). The correct formula is not (41.103) but tan (Onew/2) = e- Q tan (0/2) (41.104) (reversal of the sign of a). The reason for this correction is not far to seek. The spin or analysis so far had dealt with an outgoing light pulse, and a 4-vector with positive time component. That feature was built into the formula adopted to tie the spinor to the 4-vector, (41.105) In contrast the 4-vector that reaches back to the origin of an incoming photon has a time component that is negative (or, alternatively, sign-reversed space compo- nents)! For any null 4-vector with negative time component, one employs instead of (41.105) the formula (~1.106) It is enough to mention here this point of principle without going through the details that give the altered sign for a in (41.104). From now on, to preserve the previous arithmetic, change the problem. Deal, not with incoming photons, but with outgoing photons. Replace the receiving telescope by the projector of a planetarium. It projects out into space a separate beam of light for each star of the Big Dipper and also one for the North Star itself. Let an observer move in the positive z-direction with velocity parameter a. In his frame of reference the beams actually will be widened out in full accord with (41.103). \"The magnification process changes the size of the Big Dipper but not its shape.\""},{"pageNumber":1190,"pageContent":"This statement is at the same time true and false. It is true of the Dipper and of any other constellation to the extent that the angular dimensions of that constellation can be idealized to be small compared to the entire compass of the sky. It is false in the sense that any well-rounded projected constellation, however small it may appear to an observer at rest with respect to the earth, can always be so \"opened out\" by the observer putting on any sufficiently high velocity, the observer still being near the earth, that the constellation encompasses a major fraction of the sky. That the \"Lorentz-transformation-induced magnification\" of a small object does not change its shape can be seen in three ways. (1) Stereographic projection (Figure 41.8) and \"fractional linear transformation\" (41.102) are both known to leave all angles unchanged [\"conformal invariance;\" see for example Penrose (1959)] and known even to turn every old circle into a new circle. (2) Consider a given star, M, in the constellation and immediate neighbors, Land N, just below it and just above£it in the count of the members of that constellation. Consider the flagpole pointed at M and the flag pointed first from M to L, then from M to N. The flag has turne<J....about the flagpole through an angle ..p. The two corresponding spinors therefore differ by a phase factor e i if,/2. They differ in no other way. After an arbitrary Lorentz transformation they still differ by the phase factor e i if,/2, and in no other way. The angle between the arcs ML and MN on the celestial sphere therefore remains at its original value ..p after the Lorentz transformation (again conformal invariance of patterns on the celestial sphere!). (3) An even more elementary calcu- lation shows that infinitesimal arc lengths on the unit celestial sphere in the direction of increasing 0 and arc lengths in the direction of increasing 4> are magnified in the same proportion, thus leaving unchanged the angle between arc and arc (confor- mal invariance). Thus, consider a photon shot out from the planetarium projector to a point on the celestial sphere (\"planetarium version of a Big-Dipper star\") with inclination 0 to the z-axis, as seen by an observer at rest relative to the earth.

SPINORS Spinor formalism in curved spacetime Spinors needed when analyzing fermions in gravitational fields Equivalence of spinor and tensor formalisms §41.11. SPINORS AS A POWERFUL TOOL IN GRAVITATION THEORY Just as vectors, tensors, and differential forms are easily generalized from flat space- time to curved, so are spinors. Each event 9 in curved spacetime possesses a tangent space. In that tangent space reside and operate all the vectors, tensors, and forms located at 9. The geometry of the tangent srace is Lorentzian (\"local Lorentz geometry at 9\"), since the scalar product of any two vectors u and v at 9, expressed in an orthonormal frame at '1', is u' v = g(u, v) = T/aPUav P . Thus, there is no mathematical difference between the tangent space at 9 on the one hand, and flat spacetime on the other. Whatever mathematical can be done in the one can also be done in the other. In particular, the entire formalism of spinors, developed originally in flat spacetime, can be carried over without change to the tangent space at the arbitrary event 9 in curved spacetime. Let it be done. Now spinors reside at every event in curved spacetime; and at each event one can translate back and forth between spin or language and tensor language, using the equations (valid in orthonormal frames) of §§41.6 and 41.7. Spinors in curved spacetime are an indispensible mathematical tool, when one wishes to study the influence of gravity on quantized particles of half-integral spin (neutrinos, electrons, protons, ... ). Consider, for example, Hartle's (1971) proof that a black hole cannot exert any long-range, weak-interaction forces on external matter (i.e., that a black hole has no \"weak-interaction hair\"). His proof could not function withQut a spinor description of neutrino fields in curved spacetime. Similarly for Wheeler's (1971 b) analysis of the quasibound states of an electron in the gravitational field of a small black hole (gravitational radius _10- 13 cm): it requires solving the Dirac equation for a spin-~ particle in the curved spacetime geometry of Schwarzs- child. For a detailed discussion of the Dirac equation in curved spacetime see, e.g., Brill and Wheeler (1957). To use the mathematics of spinors, one need not be dealing with quantum theory or with particles of half-integral spin. The spinor formalism is perfectly applicable in situations where only integral-spin entities (scalars, vectors, tensors) are in view, and where in fact, the spinor formalism is fully equivalent to the tensor formalism that pervades earlier chapters of this book. Equations (41.77) and (41.78) provide the translation from one formalism to the other, once an orthonormal frame has been chosen at each event in spacetime. Certain types of problems in gravitation theory are far more tractable in the language of spinors than in the language of tensors. Examples are as follows."},{"pageNumber":1192,"pageContent":"§41.11. SPINORS AS A POWERFUL TOOL IN GRAVITATION THEORY (1) Geometric Optics (the theory of \"null congruences of geodesics\") 1165 Here spinors make almost trivial the lengthy tensor algebra needed in derivations of the \"focusing theorem\" [equation (22.37)]; and they yield an elegant, simple formalism for discussing and calculating how, with increasing affine parameter, a bundle of rays alters its size (\"expansion\"), its shape (\"shear\"), and its orientation (\"rotation\"). See, e.g., Sachs (1964), Pirani (1965), or Penrose (1968a) for a review and the original references. Applications of spinor formalism in classical gravitation theory (2) Radiation Theory in Curved Spacetime (both gravitational and electromagnetic) Spinors provide the most powerful of all formalisms for decomposing radiation fields into spherical harmonics and for manipulating their decomposed components. See, for example, Price's (1972a,b) analysis of how a perturbed Schwarzschild black hole radiates away all its radiatable perturbations, be they electromagnetic perturbations, gravitational perturbations, or perturbations in a fictitious field of spin 17; see, similarly, the analysis by Fackerell and Ipser (1972) and by Ipser (1971) of electro- magnetic perturbations of a Kerr black hole, and the analysis by Teukolsky (1972) of gravitational perturbations of a Kerr hole. Spinors also yield an elegant and powerful analysis of the \"l/r\" expansion of a radiation field flowing out from a source into asymptotically flat space. Among its results is a \"peeling theorem,\" which describes the algebraic properties of the coefficients in a l/r expansion of the Riemann tensor. See, e.g., Sachs (1964) or Pirani (1965) for reviews and original references. (3) Algebraic Properties of Curvature Tensors The spinor formalism is a more powerful method than any other for deriving the \"Petrov-Pirani algebraic classification of the conformal curvature tensor,\" and for proving theorems about algebraic properties of curvature tensors. See, e.g., Sachs (1964) or Pirani (1965) or Penrose (1968a) for reviews and references. Of course, the spinor formalism, like any formalism, has its limitations. For - - ---example, ma.ny of the elementary problems of gravitation theory, and a large fraction of the most difficult ones, would be more difficult in the language of spinors than in the language of tensors!

This chapter is entirely Track 2. As preparation for it, Chapter 21 (variational principle and initial-value formalism) is needed.

The need for Regge calculus as a computational tool Approximation of smooth geometries by skeleton structures Gravitation theory is entering an era when situations of greater and greater com- plexity must be analyzed. Before about 1965 the problems of central interest could mostly be handled by idealizations of special symmetry or special simplicity or both. The Schwarzschild geometry and its generalizations, the Friedmann cosmology and its generalizations, the joining together of the Schwarzschild geometry and the Friedmann geometry to describe the collapse of a bounded collection of matter, the vibrations of relativistic stars, weak gravitational waves propagating in an otherwise flat space: all these problems and others were solved by elementary means. But today one is pressed to understand situations devoid of symmetry and not amenable to perturbation theory: How do two black holes alter in shape, and how much gravitational radiation do they emit when they collide and coalesce? What are the structures and properties of the singularities at the endpoint of gravitational collapse, predicted by the theorems of Penrose, Hawking, and Geroch? Can a Universe that begins completely chaotic smooth itself out quickly by processes such as inhomogeneous mixmaster oscillations? To solve such problems, one needs new kinds of mathematical tools-and in response to this need, new tools are being developed. The \"global methods\" of Chapter 34 provide one set of tools. The Regge Calculus provides another' [Regge (1961); see also pp. 467-500 of Wheeler (1964a)]. §42.2. REGGE CALCULUS IN BRIEF Consider the geodesic dome that covers a great auditorium, made of a multitude of flat triangles joined edge to edge and vertex to vertex. Similarly envisage space- time, in the Regge calculus, as made of flat-space \"simplexes\" (four-dimensional"},{"pageNumber":1194,"pageContent":"item in this progression: two dimensions, triangle; three dimensions, tetrahedron; four dimensions, simplex) joined face to face, edge to edge, and vertex to vertex. To specify the lengths of the edges is to give the engineer all he needs in order to know the shape of the roof, and the scientist all he needs in order to know the geometry of the spacetime under consideration. A smooth auditorium roof can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a geodesic dome constructed of sufficiently small triangles. A smooth spacetime manifold can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a locked-together assembly of sufficiently small simplexes. Thus the Regge calculus, reaching beyond ordinary algebraic expressions for the metric, provides a way to analyze physical situations deprived, as so many situations are, of spherical symme- try, and systems even altogether lacking in symmetry. If the designer can give the roof any shape he pleases, he has more freedom than the an~yst who is charting out the geometry of spacetime. Given the geometry of spacetime up to some spacelike slice that, for want of a better name, one may call \"now,\" one has no freedom at all in the geometry from that instant on. Einstein's geometrodynamic law is fully deterministic. Translated into the language of the Regge calculus, it provides a means to calculate the edge lengths of new simplexes from the dimensions of the simplexes that have gone before. Though the geometry is deterministically specified, how it will be approximated is not. The original spacelike hypersurface (\"now\") is approximated as a collection of tetrahedrons joined together face to face; but how many tetrahedrons there will be and where their vertices will be placed is the option of the analyst. He can endow the skeleton more densely with bones in a region of high curvature than in a region of low curvature to get the most \"accuracy profit\" from a specified number of points. Some of this freedom of choice for the lengths of the bones remains as one applies the geometro- dynamic law in the form given by Regge (1961) to calculate the future from the past. This freedom would be disastrous to any computer program that one tried to write, unless the programmer removed all indefiniteness by adding supplementary conditions of his own choice, either tailored to give good \"accuracy profit,\" or otherwise fixed. Having determined the lengths of all the bones in the portion of skeletonized spacetime of interest, one can examine any chosen local cluster of bones in and by themselves. In this way one can find out all there is to be learned about the geometry in that region. Of course, the accuracy of one's findings will depend on the fineness with which the skeletonization has been carried out. But in principle that is no limit to the fineness, or therefore to the accuracy, so long as one is working in the context of classical physics. Thus one ends up with a catalog of all the bones, showing the lengths of each. Then one can examine the geometry of whatever space like surface one pleases, and look into many other questions besides. For this purpose one has only to pick out the relevant bones and see how they fit together. §42.3.

REGGE CALCULUS Second-and this is the rationale of Regge calculus-one can use the skeleton calculus to deduce a previously unknown 4-geometry from Einstein's geometrody- namic law, proceeding in the direction initial conditions translated into information about some of the edge lengths Einstein's equations expressed as con- ditions on the curvature (deficit angle of each hinge) fix remainder of the edge lengths (apart from natural options in fineness of zoning) In the changes contemplated in this variational principle, certain edge lengths are thought of as being fixed. They have to do with the conditions specified at the boundaries of the region of spacetime under study. It is not necessary here to enter into the precise formulation of these boundary conditions, fortunately, since some questions of principle still remain to be clarified about the precise formulation of boundary conditions in general relativity (see §21.12). Rather, what is important is the effect of changes in the lengths of the edges of the blocks in the interior of the region being analyzed, as they augment or decrease the deficit angles at the various hinges. In his basic paper on the subject, Regge (1961) notes that the typical deficit angle 8\" depends in a complicated trigonometric way on the values ofnumer- ous edge lengths lp. However, he proves (Appendix of his paper) that \"quite reo markably, we can carry out the variation as if the 8\" were constants,\" thus reducing the variational principle to the form H (1/8'17) 2: 8\" 8A\" = O. hinges 1!=1 (42.5) Here the change in area of the h-th triangle-shaped hinge, according to elementary trigonometry, is (42.6)"},{"pageNumber":1200,"pageContent":"§42.5.

THE CHOICE OF LATTICE STRUCTURE Two l4.uestions arise in the actual application of Regge calculus, and it is not clear that either has yet received the resolution which is most convenient for practical applications of this skeleton analysis: What kind of lattice to use? How best to capitalize on the freedom that exists in the choice of edge lengths? The first question is discussed in this section, the second in the next section. It might seem most natural to use a lattice made of small, nearly rectangular blocks, the departure of each from rectangularity being conditioned by the amount and directionality of the local curvature. However, such building blocks are \"floppy.\" One could give them rigidity by specifying certain angles as well as the edge lengths. But then one would lose the cleanness of Regge's prescription: give edge lengths, and give only edge lengths, and give each edge length freely and independently, in order to define a geometry. In addition one would have to rederive.the Regge equations, including new equations for the determination of the new angles. There- fore one discards the quasirectangle in favor of the simplex with its 5· 4/2 == 10 edge lengths. This decided, one also concludes that even in flat spacetime the simplexes cannot all have identical edge lengths. Two-dimensional flat space can be filled with identical equilateral triangles, but already at three dimensions it ceases to be possible to fill out the manifold with identical equilateral tetrahedrons. One knows that a given carbon atom in diamond is joined to its nearest neighbors with tetrahedral bonds, but a little reflection shows that the cell assignable to the given atom is far from having the shape of an equilateral tetrahedron. Synthesis would appear to be a natural way to put together the building blocks: first make one-dimensional structures; assemble these into two-dimensional struc- tures; these, into three-dimensional ones; and these, into the final four-dimensional structure. The one-dimensional structure is made of points, 1, 2, 3, ... , alternating with line segments, 12, 23, 34, .... To start building a two-dimensional structure, pick up a second one-dimensional structure. It might seem natural to label its points 1', 2', 3', ... , etc. However, that labeling would imply a cross-connection between 1 and 1', between 2 and 2', etc., after the fashion of a ladder. Then the elementary cells would be quasirectangles. They would have the \"floppiness\" that is to be excluded. Therefore relabel the points of the second one-dimensional structure as If, 2f, 3f, etc. The implication is that one cross-connects 2~' with points 2 and 3 of the original one-dimensional structure, etc. One ends up with something like the The choice of lattice structure: (1) avoiding floppiness (2) necessity for unequal edge lengths (3) construction of two- dimensional structures"},{"pageNumber":1201,"pageContent":"y 1174 42.

The same construction, extended, fills out the plane with triangles. One now has a simple, standard two-dimensional structure. One might mistakenly conclude that one is. ready to go ahead to build up a three-dimensional structure: the mistake lies in the tacit assumption that the flat-space topology is necessarily correct. Let it be the problem, for example, to determine the development in time of a 3-geometry that has the topology of a 3-sphere. This 3-sphere is perhaps strongly deformed from ideality by long-wavelength gravitational waves. A right arrangement of the points is the immediate desideratum. Therefore put aside for the present any consideration of the deformation of the geometry by the waves (alteration of edge lengths from ideality). Ask how to divide a perfect 3-sphere into two-dimensional sheets. Here each sheet is understood to be separated from the next by a certain distance. At this point two alternative approaches suggest themselves that one can call for brevity \"blocks\" and \"spheres.\" (1) Blocks. Note that a 3-sphere lets itself be decomposed into 5 identical, tetra- hedron-like solid blocks (5 vertices; 5 ways to leave out anyone of these vertices!) Fix on one of these \"tetrahedrons.\" Select one vertex as summit and the face through the other three vertices as base. Give that base the two-dimensional lattice structure already described. Introduce a multitude of additional sheets piled above it as evenly spaced layers reaching to the summit. Each layer has fewer points than the layer before. The decomposition of the 3-geometry inside one \"tetrahedron\" is thereby accomplished. However, an unresolved question remains; not merely how to join on this layered structure in a regular way to the corresponding structure in the adjacent \"tetrahedrons\"; but even whether such a regular joinup is at all possible. The same question can be asked about the other two ways to break up the 3-sphere into identical \"tetrahedrons\" [Coxeter (1948), esp. pp. 292-293: 16 tetrahedrons defined by a total of 8 vertices or 600 tetrahedrons defined by a total of 120 vertices J. One can eliminate the question of joinup of structure in a simple way, but at the price of putting a ceiling on the accuracy attainable: take the stated number of vertices (5 or 8 or 120) as the total number of points that will be employed in the skeletonization of the 3-geometry (no further subdivision required or admitted). Considering the boundedness of the memory capacity of any computer, it is hardly ridiculous to contemplate a limitation to 120 tracer points in exploratory calculations! (2) Spheres. An alternative approach to the \"atomization\" of the 3-sphere begins by introducing on the 3-sphere a North Pole and a South Pole and the hyperspherical angle X (X == 0 at the first pole, X == 'TT at the second, X == 'TT /2 at the equator; see Box 27.2). Let each two-dimensional layer lie on a surface of constant X (~ equal to some integer times some interval .1X). The structure of this 2-sphere is already to be regarded as skeletonized into elementary triangles (\"fully complete Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome\"). Therefore the number of \"faces\" or triangles F, the number of edge lengths E, and the number of vertices V must be connected by the relation of Euler: F _ E + V == (a topology-dependent ) == {2 for 2-sphere, (42.8) number or \"Euler character\" 0 for 2-torus. It follows from this relation that it is impossible for each vertex to sit at the center"},{"pageNumber":1202,"pageContent":"§42.5. THE CHOICE OF LATIICE STRUCTURE 1175 (42.9) of a hexagon (each vertex the point of convergence of 6 triangles). This being the case, one is not astonished that a close inspection of the pattern of a geodesic dome shows several vertices where only 5 triangles meet. It is enough to have 12 such 5-triangle vertices among what are otherwise all6-triangle vertices in order to meet the requirements of the Euler relation: n 5-triangle vertices V - n 6-triangle vertices F = (V - n)(6/3) + n(5/3) triangles E = (V - n)(6/2) + n(5/2) edges V = (V - n)(6/6) + n vertices 2 = F - E + V = n/6 Euler characteristic n = 12 Among all figures with triangular faces, the icosahedron is the one with the smallest number of faces that meets this condition (5-triangle vertices exclusively!) If each 2-surface has the pattern of vertices of a geodesic dome, how is one dome to be joined to the next to make a rigid skeleton 3-geometry? Were the domes imbedded in a flat 3-geometry, rigidity would be no issue. Each dome would already be rigid in and by itself. However, the 3-geometry is not given to be flat. Only by a completely deterministic skeletonization of the space between the two 2-spheres will they be given rigidity in the context of curved space geometry. (1) Not by running a single connector from each vertex in one surface to the corresponding vertex in the next (\"floppy structure\"!) (2) Not by displacing one surface so each of its vertices comes above, or nearly ab6ve,- the center of a triangle in the surface \"below.\" First, the numbers of vertices and triangles ordinarily will not agree. Second, even when they do, it will not give the structure the necessary rigidity to connect the vertex of the surface above to the three vertices of the triangle below. The space between will contain some tetrahedrons, but it will not be throughout decomposed into tetrahedrons. (3) A natural and workable approach to the skeletonization of the 3-geometry is to run a connector from each vertex in the one surface to the corre- sponding vertex in the next, but to flesh out this connection with additional structure that will give rigidity to the 3-geometry: intervening vertices and connectors as illustrated in Box 42.3. In working up from the skeletonization of a 3-geometry to the skeletonization ofa 4-geometry, it is natural to proceed similarly. (1) Use identical patterns of points in the two 3-geometries. (2) Tie corresponding points together by single connectors. (3) Halfway, or approximately halfway between the two 3-geometries insert a whole additional pattern of vertices. Each of these supplementary vertices is \"dual\" to and lies nearly \"below\" the center of a tetrahedron in the 3-geometry immediately above. (4) Connect each supplementary vertex to the vertices of the tetrahedron immediately above, to the vertices of the tetrahedron immediately below, and to those other supplementary vertices that are its immediate neighbors.

THE CHOICE OF EDGE LENGTHS So much for the lattice structure of the 4-geometry; now for the other issue, the freedom that exists in the choice of edge lengths. Why not make the simplest choice and let all edges be light rays? Because the 4-geometry would not then be fully determined. The geometry ga/3(x JL ) differs from the geometry ;\\.(x JL ) ga/3(x JL ), even though the same points that are connected by light rays in the one geometry are also connected by light rays in the other geometry. If none of the edges is null, it is nevertheless natural to take some of the edge lengths to be space like and some to be timelike. In consequence the area A of the triangle in some cases will be real, in other cases imaginary. In 3-space the parallelo- gram (double triangle) spanned by two vectors Band C is described by a vector 2A=BXC perpendicular to the two vectors. One obtains the magnitude of A from the formula In 4-space, let Band C be two edges of the triangle. Then, as in three dimensions, 2A is dual to the bivector built from Band C. In other words, if B goes in the t direction and C in the z direction, then A is a bivector lying in the (x,y) plane. Consequently its magnitude A is to be thought of as a real quantity. Therefore the appropriate formula for the area A is (Tullio Regge) The choice of edge lengths: (1) choose some timelike, others spacelike (42.10) The quantity A is real when the deficit angle S is real. Thus the geometrically important product AS is also real."},{"pageNumber":1205,"pageContent":"1178 42. REGGE CALCULUS (2) choose timelike lengths comparable to spacelike lengths When the hinge lies in the (x,y) plane, on the other hand, the quantity A is purely imaginary. In that instance a test vector taken around the cycle of simplexes that swing on this hinge has undergone change only in its z and t components; that is, it has experienced a Lorentz boost; that is, the deficit angle S is also purely imaginary. So again the product AS is a purely real quantity. Turn now from character of edge lengths to magnitude of edge lengths. It is desirable that the elementary building blocks sample the curvatures of space in different directions on a roughly equal basis. In other words, it is desirable not to have long needle-shaped building blocks nor pancake-shaped tetrahedrons and simplexes. This natural requirement means that the step forward in time should be comparable to the steps \"sidewise\" in space. The very fact that one should have to state such a requirement brings out one circumstance that should have been obvious before: the \"hinge equations\" 2: Sh cotan () ph = ° hinges h that haveedgep in common (p = 1,2, ... ), (42.7) (3) why some lengths must be chosen arbitrarily Deficit angles in terms of edge lengths Past applications of Regge calculus though they are as numerous as the edges, cannot be regarded as adequate to determine all edge lengths. There are necessarily relations between these equations that keep them from being independent. The equations cannot determine all the details of the necessarily largely arbitrary skeletonization process. They cannot do so any more than the field equations of general relativity can determine the coordi- nate system. With a given pattern of vertices (four-dimensional generalization of drawings in Box 42.3), one still has (a) the option how close together one will take successive layers of the structure and (b) how one will distribute a given number of points in space on a given layer to achieve the maximum payoff in accuracy (greater density of points in regions of greater curvature). To prepare a practical computer program founded on Regge calculus, one has to supply the machine not only with the hinge equations and initial conditions, but also with definite algorithms to remove all the arbitrariness that resides in options (a) and (b). Formulas from solid geometry and four-dimensional geometry, out of which to determine the necessary hyperdihedral angles a and the deficit angles S in terms of edge lengths and nothing but edge lengths, are summarized by Wheeler (1964a, pp. 469, 470, and 490) and by C. Y. Wong (1971). Regge (1961) also gives a formula for the Riemann curvature tensor itself in terms of deficit angles and number of edges running in a given direction [see also Wheeler (l964a, p. 471)]. §42. 7. PAST APPLICATIONS OF REGGE CALCULUS Wong (1971) has applied Regge calculus to a problem where no time development shows itself, where the geometry can therefore be treated as static, and where in addition it is spherically symmetric.

THE FUTURE OF REGGE CALCULUS 1179 (3)R = 16'17 (energy density) on the 3-space (§2l.5) gives a recursion relation that determines the dimension of each icosahedron in terms of the two preceding icosahedra. Errors in the skeleton representation of the exact geometry range from roughly 10 percent to less than 1 percent, depending on the method of analysis, the quantity under analysis, and the fineness of the subdi vision. Skeletonization of geometry is to be distinguished from mere rewriting of partial differential equations as difference equations. One has by now three illustrations Partial skeletonization that oIlf can capitalize on skeletonization without fragmenting spacetime all the way to the level of individual simplexes. The first illustration is the first part of Wong's work, where the time dimension never explicitly makes an appearance, so that the building blocks are three-dimensional only. The second is an alternative treatment, also given by Wong, that goes beyond the symmetry in t to take account of the symmetry in () and cp. It divides space into spherical shells, in each of which the geometry is \"pseudo-flat\" in much the same sense that the geometry of a paper cone is flat. The third is the numerical solution for the gravitational collapse of a spherical star by May and White (1966), in which there is symmetry in () and cp, but not in r or t. This zoning takes place exclusively in the r, t-plane. Each zone is a spherical shell. The difference as compared to Regge calculus (flat geometry within each building block) is the adjustable \"conicity\" given to each shell. The examples show that the decision about skeletonizing the geometry in a calculation is ordinarily not \"whether\" but \"how much.\" §42.8. THE FUTURE OF REGGE CALCULUS In summary, Regge's skeleton calculus puts within the reach of computation prob- Hopes for the future lems that in practical terms are beyond the power of normal analytical methods. It affords any desired level of accuracy by sufficiently fine subdivision of the space- time region under consideration. By way of its numbered building blocks, it also offers a practical way to display the results of such calculations. Finally, one can hope that Regge's truly geometric way of formulating general relativity will someday make the content of the Einstein field equations (Cartan's \"moment of rotation\"; see Chapter 15) stand out sharp and clear, and unveil the geometric significance of the so-called \"geometrodynamic field momentum\" (analysis of the boundary-value problem associated with th~yariatitmal probleITI of general relativity in Regge ~:see §21.l2):----'"},{"pageNumber":1207,"pageContent":"y CHAPTER 43 SUPERSPACE: ARENA FOR THE DYNAMICS OF GEOMETRY Traveler, there are no paths.

The dynamics of Einstein's curved space geometry runs its course in superspace as the dynamics of a particle unfolds in spacetime. This chapter gives one simple version of superspace, and a little impression of alternative versions of superspace that also have their uses. It describes the classical dynamics of geometry in superspace in terms of the Hamilton-Jacobi principle of Boxe~ 25.3 and 25.4. No version of mechanics makes any shorter the leap from classical dynamics to quantum. Thus it provides a principle (\"Einstein-Hamilton-Jacobi or EHJ equation\") for the propagation of wave crests in superspace, and for finding where those wave crests give one the classical equivalent of constructive interference (\"envelope formation\"). In this way one finds the track of development of 3-geometry with time expressed as a sharp, thin \"leaf of history\" that slices through superspace. The quantum principleheplaces this deterministic account with a fuzzed-out leaf of history of finite thickness.

Honl (1962); see also §21.l2] or because that requirement simplifies the mathematical analysis, or for both reasons together. One can approximate a smooth, closed 3-geometry by a skeleton 3-geometry built out of tetrahedrons, as indicated schematically in Figure 43.1 (see Chapter 42 on the Regge calculus). Specify the 98 edge-lengths in this example to fix all the features of the geometry; and fix these 98 edge-lengths by giving the location of a single point in a space of 98 dimensions. This 98-dimensional manifold, this \"truncated superspace,\" goes over into superspace [Wheeler (1964a), pp. 453, 459, 463, 495] in the idealization in which the tracer points increase in density of coverage without limit. Accounts of superspace with more mathematical detail are given by DeWitt (1967a,b), Wheeler (1970), and Fischer (1970). Let the representative point move from one location to a nearby location, either in truncated superspace or in full superspace. Then all edge-lengths alter, and the 3-geometry of Figure 43.1 moves as if alive. No better illustration can one easily supply of what it means to speak of the \"dynamics of space.\" The term \"3-geometry\" makes sense as well in quantum geometrodynamics as in classical theory. So does superspace. But spacetime does not. Give a 3-geometry, and give its time rate of change.

The approximation can be made arbitrarily good by going to the limit of an arbitrarily fine decomposition. The curvature at a typical location is measured by a deficit angle. This angle is completely determined by the edge lengths (L l , [2' ... L 8 in the figure) of the simplexes that meet at that location.

In the real *orld of quantum physics, however, one cannot give both a dynamic variable and its time-rate of change. The principle of complementarity forbids. Given the precise 3-geometry at one instant, one cannot also know at that instant the time-rate of change of the 3-geometry. In other words, given the geometrodynamic field coordinate, one cannot know the geometrodynamic field momentum. If one assigns the intrinsic 3-geometry, one cannot also specify the extrinsic curvature. The uncertainty principle thus deprives one of any way whatsoever to predict, or even to give meaning to, \"the deterministic classical history of space evolving"},{"pageNumber":1210,"pageContent":"in time.\" No prediction of spacetime, therefore no meaning for spacetime, is the verdict of the quantum principle. That object which is central to all of classical general ,/ relativity, the four-dimensional spacetime geometry, simply does not exist, except in a classical approximation. These considerations reveal that the concepts of spacetime and time are not primary but secondary ideas in the structure of physical theory. These concepts are valid in the classical approximation. However, they have neither meaning nor application under circumstances where quantum geometrodynamic effects become important. Then one has to forego that view of nature in which every event, past, present, or future, occupies its preordained position in a grand catalog called \"spacetime,\" with the Einstein interval from each event to its neighbor eternally established.

THE DYNAMICS OF GEOMETRY DESCRIBED IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE SUPERSPACE OF THE (3)J.j'S Given a spacetime, one can construct the corresponding leaf of history slicing through superspace. Conversely, given the leaf of history, one can reconstruct the spacetime. Consider the child's toy commonly known as \"Chinese boxes.\" One opens the outermost box only to reveal another box; when the second box is opened, there is another box, and so on, until eventually there are dozens of boxes scattered over the floor. Or conversely the boxes can be put back together, nested one inside the other, to reconstitute the original package. The packaging of(3)-b's into a (4)-b is much more sophisticated. Nature provides no monotonic ordering of the (3)-b'S. Two of the dynamically allowed (3)-b's, taken at random, will often cross each other one or more times. When one shakes the (4)-b apart, one therefore gets enormously more (3)-b's \"spread out over the floor\" than might have been imagined. Conversely, when one puts back together all of the (3)Hs lying on the leaf of history, one gets a structure with a rigidity that might not otherwise have been foreseen. This rigidity arises from the infinitely rich interleaving and intercrossing of clear-cut, well-defined (3)Hs one with another. In summary: (1) Classical geometrodynamics in principle constitutes a device, an algorithm, a rule for calculating and constructing a leaf of history that slices through superspace. (2) The (3)Hs that lie on this leaf of history are YES 3-geometries; the vastly more numerous (3)Hs that do not are NO 3-geometries. (3) The YES (3)Hs are the building blocks of the (4)-b that is classical spacetime. (4) The interweaving and interconnections of these building blocks give the (4)-b its existence, its dimen- sionality, and its structure. (5) In this structure every (3)-b has a rigidly fixed location of its own. (6) In this sense one can say that the \"many-fingered time\" of each 3-geometry is specified by the very interlocking construction itself. Baierlein, Sharp and Wheeler (1962) say a little more on this concept of \"3-geometry as carrier of information about time.\" How different from the textbook concept of spacetime! There the geometry of spacetime is conceived as constructed out of elementary objects, or points, known as \"events.\" Here, by contrast, the primary concept is 3-geometry, in abstracto, and out of it is derived the idea of event. Thus, (1) the event lies at the intersection of such and such (3)Hs; and (2) it has a timelike relation to (earlier or later than, or synchronous with) some other (3)-b, which in turn (3) derives from the intercrossings of all the other (3)-b'S. t When one turns from classical theory to quantum theory, one gives up the concept of spacetime, except in the semiclassical approximation. Therefore, one gives up any immediate possibility whatsoever of defining the concept, normally regarded as so elemental, of an \"event.\" The theory itself, however, here as always [Bohr and Rosenfeld (1933)], defines in and by itself, in its own natural way, the procedures- in-principle for measuring all those quantities that are in principle measurable.

Were one to take, instead of a physically rele~ant probability amplitude function, a typical solution of the relevant wave equation, one would have to expect to see not one trace of anything like classical geometrodynamics. The typical probability amplitude function is spread all over superspace. No surprise! Already in classical theory one has to reckon with a Hamilton-Jacobi function, S = S( 3l -b), (43.2) (43.3) , spread out over superspace.

Constructive interference occurs where the phases of the several individual waves agree: (43.5) This is the condition that distinguishes YES 3-geometries from NO 3-geometries. It is the tool for constructing a leaf of history in superspace. It is the key to the dynamics of geometry. Moreover, it is an equation that says not one word about the quantum principle. It is not surprising that the equation of constructive interfer- ence in (43.5) makes the leap from classical theory to quantum theory the shortest. §43.3.

The problem of a particle moving in two-dimensional space, as treated by the Hamilton-Jacobi method in Boxes 25.3 and 25.4, required for complete analysis a solution containing two distinct and independently adjustable parameters, the energy per unit mass, E, and angular momentum per unit mass, l; thus S(r, (J, t; E, l) = -Et + l8 + fr [E2 - (1 - 2M/r)(1 + £2/r 2 )jl/2 1 ~ + 8(E, l). • (43.20) ( - M/r) • Here the additive phase 8(E, l) is required if one is to be able to arrange for the particle to arrive at a given r-value at a specified t value and at a specified value of (J.

Another way out is to formulate the dynamics quite differently, in the way proposed by Kuchar (see Chapter 21), in which the resulting equation is of first order in the variable analogous to time. The exploration of quantum geometrodynamics is simplified when one treats most of the degrees of freedom of the geometry as frozen out, by imposition of a high degree of symmetry. Then one is left with one, two. or three degrees of freedom (see Chapter 30, on mixmaster cosmology), or even infinitely many, and is led to manageable problems of quantum mechanics [Misner (1972a, 1973)]. §43.4.

The additional field brings about in the most elementary approximation the displacement .dx = f(ejmw 2 )E.(w)e- iwt dw. The average vanishes but the root mean square «(.dx)2) does not. In consequence the electron feels an effective atomic potential altered from the expected value V(x,y, z) by the amount .dV(x,y, z) = f «(.dx)2) v 2 V(x,y, z). The average of this perturbation over the unperturbed motion accounts for the major part of the observed Lamb-Retherford shift .dE = (.d V(x,y, z» in the energy level.

Still another familiar way of speaking about electromagnetic field fluctuations gives additional insight relevant to geometrodynamics. One considers a measuring device responsive in comparable measure to the magnetic field at all points in a region of dimension L. One asks for the effect on this device of electromagnetic disturbances of various wavelengths. A disturbance of wavelength short compared to L will cause forces to act one way in some parts of the detector, and will give rise to nearly compensating forces in other parts of it.

Similar considerations apply in geometrodynamics. Quantum fluctuations in the geometry are superposed on and coexist with the large-scale, slowly varying curvature predicted by classical deterministic general relativity.

By comparison, the quantum fluctuations in the curvature of space are only LJR -- 10- 33 cm- 2 , (43.34) even in a domain of observation as small as 1 cm in extent.

Later work of Tolman (1934a), Avez (1960), Geroch (1967), and Hawking and Penrose (1969) generalizes the conclusion. A model universe that is closed, that obeys Einstein's geometrodynamic law, and that contains a nowhere negative density of mass-energy, inevitably develops a singularity. No one sees any escape fr~m the density of mass-energy rising without limit.

BEYOND THE END OF TIME of harmony, cacophony, is the impression that comes from sampling the literature of the 'teens on the structure of the atom. (1) Change the Coulomb law of force between electric charges? (2) Give up the principle that an accelerated charge must radiate? There was little inhibition against this and still wilder abandonings of the well-established. In contrast, Bohr held fast to these two principles. At the same time he insisted on the importance of a third principle, firmly established by Planck in quite another domain of physics, the quantum principle. With that key he opened the door to the world of the atom. Great as was the crisis of 1911, today gravitational collapse confronts physics with its greatest crisis ever. At issue is the fate, not of matter alone, but of the universe itself. The dynamics of collapse, or rather of its reverse, expansion, is evidenced not by theory alone, but also by observation; and not by one observation, but by observations many in number and carried out by astronomers of unsurpassed ability and integrity. Collapse, moreover, is not unique to the large-scale dynamics of the universe. A white dwarf star or a neutron star of more than critical mass is predicted to undergo gravitational collapse to a black hole (Chapters 32 and 33). Sufficiently many stars falling sufficiently close together at the center of the nucleus of a galaxy are expected to collapse to a black hole many powers of ten more massive than the sun. An active search is under way for evidence for a black hole in this Galaxy (Box 33.3). The process that makes a black hole is predicted to provide an experi- mental model for the gravitational collapse of the universe itself, with one difference. For collapse to a black hole, the observer has his choice whether (1) to observe from a safe distance, in which case his observations will reveal nothing of what goes on inside the horizon; or (2) to follow the falling matter on in, in which case he sees the final stages of the collapse, not only of the matter itself, but of the geometry surrounding the matter, to indefinitely high compaction, but only at the cost of his own early demise. For the gravitational collapse of a closed model universe, no such choice is available to the observer. His fate is sealed. So too is the fate of matter and elementary particles, driven up to indefinitely high densities. The stakes in the crisis of collapse are hard to match: the dynamics of the largest object, space, and the smallest object, an elementary particle--and how both began. §44.2. ASSESSMENT OF THE THEORY THAT PREDICTS COLLAPSE No one reflecting on the paradox of collapse (\"collapse ends physics\"; \"oollapse cannot end physics\") can fail to ask, \"What are the limits of validity of Einstein's geometric theory of gravity?\" A similar question posed itself in the crisis of 1911. The Coulomb law for the force acting between two charges had been tested at distances of meters and millimeters, but what warrant was there to believe that it holds down to the 1 0- 8 cm of atomic dimensions? Of course, in the end it proves to hold not only at the level of the atom, and at the 10- 13 cm level of the nucleus, but even down to 5 X 10- 15 cm [Barber, Gittelman, O'Neill, and Richter, and Bailey et al. (1968), as reviewed by Farley (1969) and Brodsky and Drell (1970)], a striking"},{"pageNumber":1226,"pageContent":"example of what Wigner (1960) calls the \"unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences.\" No theory more resembles Maxwell's electrodynamics in its simplicity, beauty, and scope than Einstein's geometrodynamics. Few principles in physics are more firmly established than those on which it rests; the local validity of special relativity (Chapters 2-7), the equivalence principle (Chapter 16), the conservation of momen- tum and energy (Chapters 5, 15 and 16), and the prevalence of second-order field equations throughout physics (Chapter 17). Those principles and the demand for no \"extraneous fields\" (e.g., Dicke's scalar field) and \"no prior geometry\" (§ 17.6) lead to the conclusion that the geometry of spacetime must be Riemannian and the geometrodynamic law must be Einstein's. To say that the geometry is Riemannian is to say that the interval between any two nearby events C and D, anywhere in spacetime, stated in terms of the interval AB between two nearby fiducial events, at quite another point in spacetime, has a value CD / AB independent of the route of intercomparison (Chapter 13 and Box 16.4). There are a thousand routes. By this hydraheaded prediction, Einstein's theory thus exposes itself to destruction in a thousand ways (Box 16.4). Geometrodynamics lends itself to being dis proven in other ways as well. The geometry has no option about the control it exerts on the dynamics of particles and fields (Chapter 20). The theory makes predictions about the equilibrium configura- tions and pulsations of compact stars (Chapters 23-26). It gives formulas (Chapters 27-29) for the deceleration of the expansion of the universe, for the density of mass-energy, and for the magnifying power of the curvature of space, the tests of which are not far off. It predicts gravitational collapse, and the existence of black holes, and a wealth of physics associated with these objects (Chapters 31-34). It predicts gravitational waves (Chapters 35-37). In the appropriate approximation, it encompasses all the well-tested predictions of the Newtonian theory of gravity for the dynamics of the solar system, and predicts testable post-Newtonian corrections besides, including several already verified effects (Chapters 38-40). No inconsistency of principle has ever been found in Einstein's geometric theory of gravity. No purported observational evidence against the theory has ever stood the test of time. No other acceptable account of physics of comparable simplicity and scope has ever been put forward. Continue this assessment of general relativity a little further before returning to the central issue, the limits of validity of the theory and their bearing on the issue of gravitational collapse. What has Einstein's geometrodynamics contributed to the understanding of physics? First, it has dethroned spacetime from a post of preordained perfection high above the battles of matter and energy, and marked it as a new dynamic entity participating actively in this combat. Second, by tying energy and momentum to the curvature of spacetime, Einstein's theory has recognized the law of conservation of momentum and energy as an automatic consequence of the geometric identity that the boundary of a boundary is zero (Chapters 15 and 17). Third, it has recognized gravitation as a manifestation of the curvature of the §44.2.

BEYOND THE END OF TIME Electric charge as lines of force trapped in the topology of space geometry of spacetime rather than as something foreign and \"physical\" imbedded in spacetime. Fourth, general relativity has reinforced the view that \"physics is local\"; that the _ analysis of physics becomes simple when it connects quantities at a given event with quanti-ties at immediately adjacent events. Fifth, obedient to the quantum principle, it recognizes that spacetime and time itself are ideas valid only at the classical level of approximation; that the proper arena for the Einstein dynamics of geometry is not spacetime, but superspace; and that this dynamics is described in accordance with the quantum principle by the propagation of a probability amplitude through superspace (Chapt~r 43). In conse- quence, the geometry of space is subject to quantum fluctuations in metric coefficients of the order 5 (Planck length, L· = (fiG / C 3 )1/2 = 1.6 X 10- 33 em) g - (linear extension of region under study) . Sixth, standard Einstein geometrodynamics is partial as little to Euclidean topology as to Euclidean geometry. A multiply connected topology provides a natural de- scription for electric charge as electric lines of force trapped in the topology of a multiply connected space (Figure 44.1). Any other description of electricity postulates a breakdown in Maxwell's field equations for the vacuum at a site where charge Figure 44.1. Electric charge viewed as electric lines of force trapped in the topology of a multiply connected space [for the history of this concept see reference 36 of Wheeler (l968a)]. The wormhole or handle is envisaged as connecting two very different regions in the same space. One of the wormhole mouths, viewed by an observer with poor resolving power, appears to be the seat of an electric charge. Out of this region of 3-space he finds lines of force emerging over the whole 477\" solid angle. He may construct a boundary around this charge, determine the flux through this boundary, incorrectly apply the theorem of Gauss and \"prove\" that there is a charge \"inside the boundary.\" It isn't a boundary. Someone caught within it-to speak figuratively-can go into that mouth of the wormhole, through the throat, out tte other mouth, and return by way of the surrounding space to look at his \"prison\" from the outside. Lines of force nowhere end. Maxwell's equations nowhere fail. Nowhere can one place a finger and say, \"Here there is some charge.\" This classical type of electric charge has no direct relation whatsoever to quantized electric charge. There is a freedom of choice about the flux through the wormhole, and a specificity about the connection between one charge and another, which is quite foreign to the charges of elementary particle physics. For ease of visualization the number of space dimensions in the above diagram has been reduced from three to two. The third dimension, measured off the surface, has no physical meaning-it only provides an extra dimension in which to imbed the surface for more convenient diagrammatic representation.

No one has ever found a way to describe electricity free of these unhappy features except to say that the quantum fluctuations in the geometry of space are so great at small distances that even the topology fluctuates, makes \"wormholes,\" and traps lines of force. These fluctuations have to be viewed, not as tied to particles, and endowed with the scale of distances associated with particle physics (_10- 13 em) but as pervading all space (\"foam-like structure of geometry\") and characterized by the Planck distance (_10- 33 em). Thus a third type of gravitational collapse forces itself on one's attention, a collapse continually being done and being undone everywhere in space: surely a guide to the outcome of collapse at the level. of a star and at the level of the universe (Box 442). I Box 44.2 THREE LEVELS OF GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE 1. Universe 2. Black hole 3. Fluctuations at the Planck scale of distances Recontraction and collapse of the universe is a kind of mirror image of the \"big bang,\" on which one already has so much evidence. Collapse of matter to form a black hole is most natural at two distinct levels: (a) collapse of the dense white-dwarf core of an individual star (when that core exceeds the critical mass, -1 M 0 or 2M 0 , at which a neutron star is no longer a possible stable end-point for collapse) and (b) coalescence one by one of the stars in a galactic nucleu~ to make a black hole of mass up to 106M 0 or even 109M 0 . In either case: no feature of principle about matter falling into the black hole is more interesting than the option that the observer has (symbolized by the branch- ing arrow in the inset). He can go along with the infall- ing matter, in which case he sees the final stages of collapse, but only at the cost of his own demise. Or he can stay safely outside, in which case even after in- definitely long time he sees only the first part of the collapse, with the infalling matter creeping up more and more slowly to the horizon. In the final stages of the collapse of a closed model universe, all black holes present are caught up and driven together, amalgamating one by one. No one has any way to look at the event from safely outside; one is inevitably caught up in it oneself. Collapse at the Planck scale of distances is taking place everywhere and all the time in quantum fluctuations in the geometry and, one believes, the topology of space. In this sense, collapse is continually being done and undone, modeling the undoing of the collapse of the universe itself, summarized in the term, \"the reproc- essing of the universe\" (see text)."},{"pageNumber":1229,"pageContent":"1202 44.

VACUUM FLUCTUATIONS: THEIR PREVALENCE AND FINAL DOMINANCE If Einstein's theory thus throws light on the rest of p'hysics, the rest of physics also . throws light on geometrodynamics. No point is more central than this,· that em\"pty space'is not empty. It is the seat of the most violent physics. The electromagnetic field fluctuates (Chapter 43). Virtual pairs of positive and negative electrons, in effect, are continually being created and annihilated, and likewise pairs ofmu mesons, pairs of baryons, and pairs of other particles. All these fluctuations coexist with the quantum fluctuations in the geometry and topology of space. Are they additional- to those geometrodynamic zero-point disturbances, or are they, in some sense not now well-understood, mere manifestations of them? Put the question in other words. Recall Clifford, inspired by Riemann, speaking to the Cambridge Philosophical Society on February 21,1870, \"On the Space Theory of Matter\" [Clifford (1879), pp. 244 and 322; and (1882), p. 21], and saying, \"I hold in fact (1) That small portions of space are in fact of a nature analogous to little hills on a surface which is on the average flat; namely, that the ordinary laws of geometry are not valid in them. (2) That this property of being curved or distorted is continually being passed on from one portion of space to another after the manner of a wave. (3) That this variation of the curvature of space is what really happens in that phenomenon which we call the motion of matter, whether ponderable or etherial. (4) That in the physical world nothing else takes place but this variation, subject (possibly) to the law of continuity.\" Ask if there is a sense in which one can speak of a particle as constructed out of geometry. Or rephrase the question in updated language: \"Is a particle a geometrodyna~ic ~xdton?\" What else is there out of which to build a particle except geometry itself? And what else is there to give discreteness to such an object except the quantum principle? The Clifford-Einstein space theory of matter has not been forgotten in recent years. \"In conclusion,\" one of the authors wrote a decade ago [Wheeler (1962)], \"the vision of Riemann, Clifford, and Einstein, of a purely geometric basis for physics, today has come to a higher state of development, and offers richer prospects-and presents deeper problems-than ever before. The quantum of action adds to this geometro- dynamics new features, of which the most striking is the presence of fluctuations of the wormhole type throughout all space. If there is any correspondence at all between this virtual foam-like structure and the physical vacuum as it has come to be known through quantum electrodynamics, then there seems to be no escape from identifying these wormholes with 'undressed electrons.' Completely different from these 'undressed electrons,' according to all available evidence, are the el~ctrons and other particles of experimental physics. For these particles the geometrodynamic picture suggests the model of collective disturbances in a virtual foam-like vacuum, analogous to different kinds of phonons or excitons in a solid. \"The enormous factor from nuclear densities _10 14 g/ cm 3 to the density of field fluctuation energy in the vacuum, _10 94 g/cm 3 , argues that elementary particles represent a percentage-wise almost completely negligible change in the locally violent conditions that characterize the vacuum.

Instead, they represent a first-order correction to vacuum physics. That vacuum, that zero-order state of affairs, with its enormous densities of virtual photons and virtual positive-negative pairs and virtual wormholes, has to be described properly before one has a funda- mental starting point for a proper perturbation-theoretic analysis.\" \"These conclusions about the energy density of the vacuum, its complicated topological character, and the richness of the physics which goes on in the vac- uum, stand in no evident contradiction with what quantum electrodynamics has to say about the vacuum. Instead the conclusions from the 'small distance' analysis (10- 33 cm)-sketchy as it is-and from 'larger distance' analysis (10- 11 em) would seem to [be able] to reinforce each other in a most natural way. \"The most evident shortcoming of the geometrodynarnic model as it stands is this, that it fails to supply any completely natural place for spin ~ in general and for the neutrino in particular.\" Attempts to find a natural place for spin l' in Einstein's standard geometrodynamics (Box 44.3) founder because there is no natural way for a change in connectivity to take place within the context of classical differential geometry. A uranium nucleus undergoing fission starts with one topology and nevertheless __ ~!1ds_!!p with an6ther topology. It makes this transition in a perfectly continuous way, classical differential geometry notwithstanding. There are reputed to be two kinds of lawyers. One tells the client what not to do. The other listens to what the client has to do and tells him how to do it. From the first lawyer, classical differential geometry, the client goes away disappointed, still searching for a natural way to describe quantum fluctuations in the connectivity of space. Only in this way can he hope to describe electric charge as lines of electric force trapped in the topology of space. Only in this way does he expect to be able to understand and analyze the final stages of gravitational collapse. Pondering his problems, he comes to the office of a second lawyer, with the name \"Pregeometry\" on the door. Full of hope, he knocks and enters. What is pregeometry to be and say? Born of a combination of hope and need, of philosophy and physics and mathematics and logic, pregeometry will tell a story unfinished at this writing, but full of incidents of evolution so far as it goes. §44.4. NOT GEOMETRY, BUT PREGEOMETRY, AS THE MAGIC BUILDING MATERIAL An early survey (Box 44.4) asked whether geometry can be constructed with the help of the quantum principle out of more basic elements, that do not themselves have any specific dimensionality. The focus of attention in this 1964 discussion was \"dimensionality without dimen- sionality.\" However, the prime pressures to ponder pregeometry were and remain (continued on page 12(6) No place in geometrodynamics for change of topology; therefore turn to \"pregeometry\""},{"pageNumber":1231,"pageContent":"1204 44.

What, then, has any purely geometric description to offer in explanation of spin ~ in general? More particularly and more im- portantly, what place is there in quantum geomet- rodynamics for the neutrino-the only entity of half-integral spin that is a pure field in its own right, in the sense that it has zero rest mass and moves with the speed of light? No clear or satisfac- tory answer is known to this question today. Un- less and until an answer is forthcoming, pure geo- metrodynamics must be judged deficient as a basis for elementary particle physics.\" A later publication [Wheeler (1968a)] takes up this issue again, noting that, \"A new world opens out for analysis in quantum geometrodynamics. The central new concept is space resonating be- tween one foamlike structure and another. For this multiple-connectedness of space at submicroscopic distances no single feature of nature speaks more powerfully than electric charge. Yet at least as impressive as charge is the prevalence of spin ~ throughout the world of elementary particles.\" Repeating the statement that \"It is impossible to accept any description of elementary particles that does not have a place for spin 1,\" the article adds to the discussion a new note: \"Happily, the concept of spin manifold has come to light, not least through the work of John Milnor [see Lich- nerowicz (1961a,b,c) and (1964); Milnor (1962), (1963), and (1965a,b); Hsiang and Anderson (1965); Anderson, Brown, and Peterson (1966a,b); and Penrose (1968a)]. This concept suggests a new and interesting interpretation of a spinor field within the context of the resonating microtopology of quantum geometrodynamics, as the nonclassical two-valuedness [Pauli's standard term for spin; see, for example, Pauli (1947)] that attaches to the prob- ability amplitude for otherwise identical 3-geome- tries endowed with alternative 'spin structures.'\" More specifically: \"One does not classify the closed orientable 3-manifold of physics completely when one gives its topology, its differential struc- tures, and its metric. One must tell which spin structure it has.\" [On a 3-geometry with the topol- ogy of a 3-sphere, one can lay down a continuous field of triads (a triad consisting of three orthonor- mal vectors). Any other continuous field of triads can be deformed into the first field by a continuous sequence of small readjustments. One says that the 3-sphere admits only one \"spin structure,\" a po- tentially misleading standard word for what could just as well have been called a \"triad structure.\" In contrast, a 3-sphere with n handles or worm- holes admits 2 n \"spin structures\" (continuous fields of triads) inequivalent to one another under any continuous sequence of small readjustments what- soever, and distinguished from one another in any convenient way by n \"descriptors\" wl' w z ' .... , w k ' •••• w n .] It is natural in quantum geometro- dynamics to expect \"separate probability ampli- tudes for a 3-geometry with descriptor W k = + I and for an otherwise identical 3-geometry with descriptor Wk = - 1. Does this circumstance imply that quantum geometrodynamics supplies all the machinery one needs to describe fields of spin 1 in general and the neutrino field in particular? ... That is the only way that has ever turned up within the framework of Einstein's general relativity and Planck's quantum principle. Is this the right path? It is difficult to name any question more decisive than this in one's assessment of 'everything as geometry.''' Why not spell out these concepts, reduce them to practice, and compare them with what one knows about the behavior of fields of spin 1? There is a central difficulty in this enterprise. It assumet and demands on physical grounds that the topol- ogy of the 3-geometry shall be free to change from one connectivity to another. In contrast, classical differential geometry says, in effect, \"Once one topology, always that topology.\" Try a question like this, \"When a new handle develops and the number of descriptors rises by one, what boundary condition in s·uperspace connects the probability"},{"pageNumber":1232,"pageContent":"amplitude 0/ for 3-geometries of the original topol- ogy with the probability amplitudes 0/+ and 0/- for the two spin structures of the new topology?\" Classical differential geometry not only gives one no help in answering this question; it even forbids one to ask it. In other words, one cannot even get the enterprise \"on the road\" for want of a natural mathematical way to describe the required change in topology. The idea is therefore abandoned here and now that 3-geometry is \"the magic building material of the universe.\" In contrast, pregeometry (see text), far from being endowed with any frozen topology, is to be viewed as not even possessing any dimensionality. Box 44.4 \"A BUCKET OF DUST\"-AN EARLY ATTEMPT TO FORMULATE i THE CONCEPT OF PREGEOMETRY [Wheeler (1964a)] \"What line of thought could ever be imagined as leading to four dimensions-or any dimensionality at all-out of more primitive considerations? In the case of atoms one derives the yellow color of the sodium D-lines by analyzing the quantum dynamics of a system, no part of which is ever endowed with anything remotely resembling the attribute of color. Likewise any derivation of the four-dimensionality of spacetime can hardly start with the idea of dimensionality.\" \"Recall the notion of a Borel set. Loosely speak- ing, a Borel set is l!_ collection of points (\"bucket of dust\") which have not yet been assembled into a manifold of any particular dimensionality .... Recalling the universal sway of the quantum prin- ciple, one can imagine probability amplitudes for the points in a Borel set to be assembled into points with this, that, and the other dimensional- ity .... More conditions have to be imposed on a given number of points-as to which has which for a nearest neighbor-when the points are put together in a five-dimensional array than when these same points are arranged in a two-dimen- sional pattern. Thus one can think of each dimen- sionalityas having a much higher statistical weight than the next higher dimensionality. On the other hand, for manifolds with one, two, and three di- mensions, the geometry is too rudimentary-one can suppose-to give anything interesting. Thus Einstein's field equations, applied to a manifold of dimensionality so low, demand flat space; only when the dimensionality is as high as four do really interesting possibilities arise. Can four, therefore, be considered to be the unique dimen- sionality which is at the same time high enough to give any real physics and yet low enough to have great statistical weight? \"It is too much to imagine that one has yet made enough mistakes in this domain of thought to explore such ideas with any degree of good judg- ment.\" Consider a handle on the geometry. Let it thin halfway along its length to a point. In other words, let the handle dissolve into two bent prongs that touch at a point. Let these prongs separate and shorten. In this process two points part company that were once immediate neighbors. \"However sudden the change is in classical theory, in quan- tum theory there is a probability amplitude func- tion which falls off in the classically forbidden domain. In other words, there is some residual connection between points which are ostensibly very far away (travel from one 'tip' down one prong, then through the larger space to which these prongs are attached, and then up the other prong to the other tip). But there is nothing dis- tinctive in principle about the two points that have happened to come into discussion. Thus it would seem that there must be a connection ... between every point and every other point. Under these conditions the concept of nearest neighbor would appear no longer to make sense. Thus the tool disappears with the help of which one might oth- erwise try to speak [un]ambiguously about dimen- sionality. \""},{"pageNumber":1233,"pageContent":"1206 44. BEYOND THE END OF TIME Sakharov: gravitation is the \"metric elasticity of space\" The stratification of space Comparison with everyday elasticity two features of nature, spin ~ and charge, that speak out powerfully from every part of elementary particle physics. A fresh perspective on pregeometry comes from a fresh assessment of general relativity. \"Geometrodynamics is neither as important or as simple as it looks. Do not make it the point of departure in searching for underlying simplicity. Look deeper, at elementary particle physics.\" This is the tenor of interesting new consider- ations put forward by Sakharov [the Sakharov] (1967) and summarized under the heading, \"Gravitation as the metric elasticity of space,\" in Box 17.2. In brief, as elasticity is to atomic physics, so-in Sakharov's view-gravitation is to elementary particle physics. The energy of an elastic deformation is nothing but energy put into the bonds between atom and atom by the deformation. The energy that it takes to curve space is nothing but perturbation in the vacuum energy of fields plus particles brought about by that curvature, according to Sakharov. The energy required for the deformation is governed in the one case by two elastic constants and in the other case by one elastic constant (the Newtonian constant of gravity) but in both cases, he reasons, the constants arise by combination of a multitude of complicated individual effects, not by a brave clean stroke on an empty slate. One gives all the more favorable reception to Sakhorov's view of gravity because one knows today, as one did not in 1915, how opulent in physics the vacuum is. In Einstein's day one had come in a single decade from the ideal God-given Lorentz perfection of flat spacetime to curved spacetime. It took courage to assign even one physical constant to that world of geometry that had always stood so far above physics. The vacuum looked for long as innocent of structure as a sheet of glass emerging from a rolling mill. With the discovery of the positive electron [Anderson (1933)], one came to recognize a little of the life that heat can unfreeze in \"empty\" space. Each new particle and radiation that was discovered brought a new accretion to the recognized richness of the vacuum. Macadam looks smooth, but a bulldozer has only to cut a single furrow through the roadway to disclose all the complications beneath the surface. Think of a particle as built out of the geometry of space; think of a particle as a \"geometrodynamic exciton\"? No model-it would seem to follow from Sakharov's assessment-could be less in harmony with nature, except to think of an atom as built out of elasticity! Elasticity did not explain atoms. Atoms explained elasticity. If, likewise, particles fix the constant in Einstein's geometrodynamic law (Sakharov), must it not be unreasonable to think of the geometrodynamic law as explaining particles? Carry the comparison between geometry and elasticity one stage deeper (Figi44.2). In a mixed solid there are hundreds of distinct bonds, all of which contribute to the elastic constants; some of them arise from Van der Waal's forces, some from ionic coupling, some from homopolar linkage; they have the greatest variety of -strengths; but all have their origin in something so fantastically simple as a system of positively and negatively charged masses moving in accordance with the laws of quantum mechanics.

The vacuum is animated with the zero-point activity of distinct fields and scores of distinct particles, all of which, according to Sakharov, contribute to the Newtonian G, the \"elastic constant of the metric.\" Some interact via weak forces, some by way of electromagnetic forces, and some through strong forces. These interactions have the greatest variety of strengths. But must not all these particles and interactions have their origin in something fantastically simple? And must not this something, this \"pregeometry,\" be as far removed from geometry as the quantum mechanics of electrons is far removed from elasticity? If one once thought of general relativity as a guide to the discovery of pre geometry, nothing might seem more dismaying than this comparison with an older realm of physics. No one would dream of studying the laws of elasticity to uncover the principles of quantum mechanics. Neither would anyone investigate the work-hard- ening of a metal to learn about atomic physics. The order of understanding ran not Work-hardening (1 em) ---+ dislocations (10- 4 em) ---+ atoms (10- 8 em), but the direct opposite, Atoms (10- 8 em) ---+ dislocations (10- 4 em) ---+ work-hardening (l em)"},{"pageNumber":1235,"pageContent":"1208 44. BEYOND THE END OF TIME Search for the central principle of pregeometry One had to know about atoms to conceive of dislocations, and had to know about dislocations to understand work-hardening. Is it not likewise hopeless to go from the \"elasticity of geometry\" to an understanding of particle physics, and from particle physics to the uncovering of pregeometry? Must not the order of progress again be the direct opposite? And is not the source of any dismay the apparent loss of guidance that one experiences in giving up geometrodynamics-and not only geo- metrodynamics, but geometry itself-as a crutch to lean on as one hobbles forward? Yet there is so much chance that this view of nature is right that one must take it seriously and explore its consequences. Never more than today does one have the incentive to explore pregeometry. §44.5. PREGEOMETRY AS THE CALCULUS OF PROPOSITIONS Paper in white the floor of the room, and rule it off in one-foot squares. Down on one's hands and knees, write in the first square a set of equations conceived as able to govern the physics of the universe. Think more overnight. Next day put a better set of equations into square two. Invite one's most respected colleagues to contribute to other squares. At the end of these labors, one has worked oneself out into the door way. Stand up, look back on all those equations, some perhaps more hopeful than others, raise one's finger commandingly, and give the order \"Fly!\" Not one of those equations will put on wings, take off, or fly. Yet the universe \"flies.\" Some principle uniquely right and uniquely simple must, when one knows it, be also so compelling that it is clear the universe is built, and must be built, in such and such a way, and that it could not possibly be otherwise: But how can one discover that principle? If it was hopeless to learn atomic physics by studying work-hardening and dislocations, it may be equally hopeless to learn the basic operating principle of the universe, call it pregeometry or call it what one will, by any amount of work in general relativity and particle physics. Thomas Mann (1937), in his essay on Freud, utters what Niels Bohr would surely have called a great truth (\"A great truth is a truth whose opposite is also a great truth\") when he says, \"Science never makes an advance until philosophy authorizes and encourages it to do so.\" If the equivalence principle (Chapter 16) and Mach's principle (§21.9) were the philosophical godfathers of general relativity, it is also true that what those principles do mean, and ought to mean, only becomes clear by study and restudy of Einstein's theory itself. Therefore it would seem reasonable to expect the primary guidance in the search for pregeometry to come ftom a principle both philosophical and powerful, but one also perhaps not destined to be wholly clear in its contents or its implications until some later day. Among all the principles that one can name out of the world of science, it is difficult to think of one more compelling than simplicity; and among all the simplicities of dynamics and life and movement, none is starker [Werner (1969)] than the binary choice yes-no or true-false. It in no way proves that this choice for a starting principle is correct, but it at least gives one some comfort in the choice, that Pauli's \"nonclassi- cal two-valuedness\" or \"spin\" so dominates the world of particle physics."},{"pageNumber":1236,"pageContent":"§44.6. THE REPROCESSING OF THE UNIVERSE 1209 It is one thing to have a start, a tentative construction of pregeometry; but how does one go on? How not to go on is illustrated by Figure 44.3. The \"sewing machine\" builds objects of one or another definite dimensionality, or ofrnixed dimensionalities, according to the instructions that it receives on the input tape in yes-no binary code. Some of the difficulties of building up structure on the binary element according to this model, or anyone of a dozen other models, stand out at once. (I) Why N = 10,000 building units? Why not a different N? And if one feeds in one such arbitrary number at the start, why not fix more features \"by hand?\" No natural stopping point is evident, nor any principle that would fix such a stopping point. Such arbitrariness contradicts the principle of simplicity and rules out the model. (2) Quantum mechanics is added from outside, not generated from inside (from the model itself). On this point too the principle of simplicity speaks against the model. (3) Tl;J.e passage from pregeometry to geometry is made in a too-literal-minded way, , with no appreciation of the need for particles and fields to appear along the way. The model, in the words used by Bohr on another occasion, is \"crazy, but not crazy enough to be right.\" Noting these difficulties, and fruitlessly trying model after model of pregeometry to see if it might be free of them, one suddenly realizes that a machinery for the combination of yes-no or true-false elements does not have to be invented. It already exists. What else can pregeometry be, one asks oneself, than the calculus of proposi- tions? (Box 44.5.) §44.6. THE BLACK BOX: THE REPROCESSING OF THE UNIVERSE No amount of searching has ever disclosed a \"cheap way\" out of gravitational collapse, any more than earlier it revealed a cheap way out of the collapse of the atom. Physicists in that earlier crisis found themselves in the end confronted with a revolutionary pistol, \"Understand nothing-or accept the quantum principle.\" Today's crisis can hardly force a lesser revolution. One sees no alternative except to say that geometry fails and pregeometry has to take its place to ferry physics through the final stages of gravitational collapse and on into what happens next. No guide is evident on this uncharted way except the principle of simplicity, applied to drastic lengths. Whether the whole universe is squeezed down to the Planck dimension, or more or less, before reexpansion can begin and dynamics can return to normal, may be irrelevant for some of the questions one wants to consider. Physics has long used the \"black box\" to symbolize situations where one wishes to concentrate on what goes in and what goes out, disregarding what takes place in between. At the beginning of the crisis of electric collapse one conceived of the electron as headed on a deterministic path toward a point-center of attraction, and unhappily destined to arrive at a condition of infinite kinetic energy in a finite time. After the advent of quantum mechanics, one learned to summarize the interaction between (continued on page 1213) A first try at a pregeometry built on the principle of binary choice A more reasonable picture: pregeometry is the calculus of propositions The role of the black box in physics"},{"pageNumber":1237,"pageContent":"1210 Figure 44.3. \"Ten thousand rings\"; or an example of a way to think of the connection between pregeometry and geometry, wrong because it is too literal-minded, and for other reasons spelled out in the text.

Take an automatic fastening device that will cut open a ring, loop it through another ring, and resolder the joint. Pour the brass rings into the hopper that feeds this machine. Take a strip of instruction paper that is long enough to contain N(N - 1)/2 binary digits. Look at the instruction in the (jk)-th location on this instruction tape (j,k = 1,2, ... , N; j < k). When the binary digit at that location is 0, it is a signal to leave the j-th ring disconnected from the k-th ring. When it is I, it is lin instruction to connect that particular pair of rings. Thread the tape into the machine and press the start button. The clatter begins. Out comes a chain of rings 10,000 links long. It falls on the table and the machine stops. Pour in another 10,000 rings, feed in a new instruction tape. and push the button again. This time it is not a one-dimen- sional structure that emerges, but a two-dimensional one: a Crusader's coat of mail, complete with neck opening and sleeves. Take still another tape from the library of tapes and repeat. Onto the table thuds a smaller version of the suit of mail, this time filled out internally with a solid network of rings, a three-dimensional structure. Now forego the library and make one's own instruction tape, a random string of O's and I's. Guided by it, the fastener produces a \"Christmas tree ornament,\" a collection of segments of one-dimensional chain, two-dimensional surfaces, and three-, four-, five-, and higher-di- mensional entities, some joined together, some free-floating. Now turn from a structure deterministically fixed by a tape to a probability amplitude, a complex number, o/(tape) = 0/(n 12 , n 13 , n 14 '··· ••• , nN-1,N) (n i ; = 0, I), (I) defined over the entire range of possibilities for structures built of 10,000 rings.

Instead, couple together amplitudes, for structures that differ from \"each other by the breaking of a single ring, by linear form ulas that treat all rings on the same footing. The separate o/'s, no longer entirely independent, will still give non-zero probability amplitudes for \"Christmas tree ornaments.\" Of greater immediate interest than these \"unruly\" parts of the structures are the following questions about the smoother parts: (I) In what kinds of structures is the bulk of the probability concentrated? (2) What is the dominant dimensionality of these structures in an appropri- ate correspondence principle limit?

Propositional formula ~ is said to be equivalent (\"eq\") to propositional formula ~ if and only if ~ +--+~ is a tautology. The letters A, B, etc., serve as connectors to \"wire together\" one proposition with another. Proceeding in this way, one can construct propositions of indefinitely great length. A switching circuit [see, for example, Shannon (1938) or Hohn (1966)] is isomor- phic to a proposition. Compare a short_proposition or an elementary switching circuit to a molecular collision. No idea seemed more preposterous than that of Daniel Bernoulli (1733), that heat is a manifestation of molecular collisions. Moreover, a three-body encounter is difficult to treat, a four-body collision is more difficult, and a five- or more molecule system is essentially intractable. Nevertheless, mechanics acquires new elements of simplicity in the limit in which the number of molecules is very great and in which one can use the concept of density in phase space. Out of statistical mechanics in this limit come such concepts as temperature and entropy. When the temperature is well-defined, the energy of the system is not a well-defined idea; and when the energy is well-defined, the temperature is not. This complementarity is built ines- capably into the principles of the subject. Thrust the finger into the flame of a match and experience a sensation like nothing else on heaven or earth; yet what happens is all a consequence of molecular collisions, early critics notwithstanding. Any individual proposition is difficult for the mind to apprehend when it is long; and still more difficult to grasp is the content of a cluster of propositions. Neverthe- less, make a statistical analysis of the calculus of propositions in the limit where the number of propositions is great and most of them are long.

Nothing could seem so preposterous at first glance as the thought that nature is built on a foundation as ethereal as the calculus of propositions. Yet, beyond the push to look in this direction provided by the principle of simplicity, there are two pulls. First, bare-bones quantum mechanics lends itself in a marvelously natural way to formulation in the language of the calculus of propositions, as witnesses not least the book of Jauch (1968). If the quantum principle were not in this way already automatically contained in one's proposed model for pregeometry, and if in contrast it had to be introduced from outside, by that very token one would conclude t~at the model violated the principle of simplicity, and would have to reject it. Second, the pursuit of reality seems always to take one away from reality. Who would have imagined describing something so much a part of the here and now as gravitation in terms of curvature of the geometry of spacetime? And when later this geometry came to be recognized as dynamic, who would have dreamed that geometrodynamics unfolds in an arena so ethereal as superspace? Little astonishment there should be, therefore, if the description of nature carries one in the end to logic, the ethereal eyrie at the center of mathematics. If, as one believes, all mathematics reduces to the mathematics of logic, and all physics reduces to mathematics, what alternative is there but for all physics to reduce to the mathematics of logic? Logic is the only branch of mathematics that can \"think about itself.\" \"An issue oflogic having nothing to do with physics\" was the assessment by many of a controversy of old about the axiom, \"parallel lines never meet.\" Does it follow from the other axioms of Euclidean geometry or is it independent? \"Independent,\" Bolyai and Lobachevsky proved. With this and the work of Gauss as a start, Riemann went on to create Riemannian geometry: Study nature, not Euclid, to find out about geometry, he advised; and Einstein went on to take that advice and to make geometry a part of physics. \"An issue oflogic having nothing to do with physics\" is one's natural first assess- ment of the startling limitations on logic discovered by GOdel (1931), Cohen (1966), and others [for a review, see, for example, Kac and Ulam (1968)]. The exact opposite must be one's assessment if the real pregeometry of the real physical world indeed turns out to be identical with the calculus of propositions. \"Physics as manifestation oflogic\" or \"pregeometry as the calculus ofpropositioIlf\" is as yet [Wheeler (l971a)] not an idea, but an idea for an idea. It is put forward here only to make it a little clearer what it means to suggest that the order of progress may not be physics --+ pregeometry but pregeometry --+ physics."},{"pageNumber":1240,"pageContent":"1213 §44.6. THE REPROCESSING OF THE UNIVERSE Figure 44.4. The \"black-box model\" applied (I) to the scattering of an electron by a center of attraction and (2) to the collapse of the universe itself. The deterministic electron world line of classical theory is replaced in quantum theory by a probability amplitude, the wave crests of which are illustrated schematically in the diagram. The catastrophe of classical theory is replaced in quantum theory by a probability distribution of outputs. The same diagram illustrates the \"black-box account\" of gravitational collapse mentioned in the text. The arena of the diagram is no longer spacetime, but superspace. The incident arrow marks no longer a classical world line of an electron through spacetime, but a classical \"leaf of history of geometry\" slicing through superspace (Chapter 43). The wave crests symbolize no longer the electron wave function propagating through spacetime, but the geometrodynamic wave function propagating through superspace. The cross-hatched region is no longer the region where the one-body potential goes to infinity, but the region of gravitational collapse where the curvature of space goes to infinity. The outgoing waves describe no longer alternative directions for the new course of the scattered electron, but the beginnings of alternative new histories for the universe itself after collapse and \"reprocessing\" end the present cycle. center of attraction and electron in a \"black box:\" fire in a wave-train of electrons traveling in one direction, and get electrons coming out in this, that, and the other direction with this, that, and the other well-determined probability amplitude (Figure 44.4). Moreover, to predict these probability amplitudes quantitatively and correctly, it was enough to translate the Hamiltonian of classical theory into the language of wave mechanics and solve the resulting wave equation, the key to the \"black box.\" A similar \"black box\" view of gravitational collapse leads one to expect a \"proba- bility distribution of outcomes.\" Here, however, one outcome is distinguished from another, one must anticipate, not by a single parameter, such as the angle of scatter- ing of the electron, but by many. They govern, one foresees, such quantities as the size of the system at its maximum of expansion, the time from the start of this new cycle to the moment it ends in collapse, the number of particles present, and a thousand other features. The \"probabilities\" of these outcomes will be governed by a dynamic law, analogous to (1) the Schrodinger wave equation for the electron, -or, to cite another black box problem, (2) the Maxwell equations that couple together, at a wave-guide junction, electromagnetic waves running in otherwise separate wave guides. However, it is hardly reasonable to expect the necessary dynamic law to spring forth as soon as one translates the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of general relativity (Chapter 43) into a Schrodinger equation, simply because geometrody- namics, in both its classical and its quantum version, is built on standard differential geometry. That standard geometry leaves no room for any of those quantum fluc- tuations in connectivity that seem inescapable at small distances and therefore also inescapable in the final stages of gravitational collapse.

BEYOND THE END OF TIME \"Reprocessing\" the universe All conservation laws transcended in the collapse of the universe Little as one knows the internal machinery of the black box, one sees no escape from this picture of what goes on: the universe transforms, or transmutes, or transits, or is reprocessed probabilistically from one cycle of history to another in the era of collapse. However straightforwardly and inescapably this picture of the reprocessing of the universe would seem to follow from the leading features of general relativity and the quantum principle, the two overarching principles of twentieth-century physics, it is nevertheless fantastic to contemplate. How can the dynamics of a system so incredibly gigantic be switched, and switched at the whim of probability, from one cycle that has lasted 1011 years to one that will last only 10 6 years? At first, only the circumstance that the system gets squeezed down in the course of this dynamics to incredibly small distances reconciles one to a transformation otherwise so unbe- lievable. Then one looks at the upended strata of a mountain slope, or a bird not seen before, and marvels that the whole universe is incredible: mutation of a species, metamorphosis of a rock, chemical transformation, spontaneous transformation of a nucleus, radioactive decay of a particle, reprocessing of the universe itself. If it cast a new light on geology to know that rocks can be raised and lowered thousands of meters and hundreds of degrees, what doe~jt mean for physics to think of the universe as being from time to time \"squeezed through a knothole,\" drastically \"reprocessed,\" and started out on a fresh dynamic cycle? Three considerations above all press themselves on one's attention, prefigured in these compressed phrases: destruction of all constants of motion in collapse; particles, and the physical \"constants\" themselves, as the \"frozen-in part of the meteorology of collapse;\" \"the biological selection of physical constants.\" The gravitational collapse of a star, or a collection of stars, to a black hole extinguishes all details of the system (see Chapters 32 and33) except mass and charge and angular momentum. Whether made of matter or antimatter or radiation, whether endowed with much entropy or little entropy, whether in smooth motion orfhaotic turbulence, the collapsing system ends up as seen from outside, according to all indications, in the same standard state. The laws of conservation of baryon number and lepton number are transcended [Chapter 33; also Wheeler (1971 b»). No known means whatsoever will distinguish between black holes of the most different prove- nance if only they have the same mass, charge, and angular momentum. But for a closed universe, even these constants vanish from the scene. Total charge is automatically zero because lines of force have nowhere to end except upon charge. Total mass and total angular momentum have absolutely no definable meaning whatsoever for a closed universe. This conclusion follows not least because there"},{"pageNumber":1242,"pageContent":"§44.6. THE REPROCESSING OF THE UNIVERSE 1215 is no asymptotically flat space outside where one can put a test particle into Keplerian orbit to determine period and precession. Of all principles of physics, the laws of conservation of charge, lepton number, baryon number, mass, and angular momentum are among the most firmly estab- lished. Yet with gravitational collapse the content of these conservation laws also collapses. The established is disestablished. No determinant of motion does one see left that could continue unchanged in value from cycle to cycle of the universe. Moreover, if particles are dynamic in construction, and if the spectrum of particle masses is therefore dynamic in origin, no option would seem left except to conclude that the mass spectrum is itself reprocessed at the time when \"the universe is squeezed through a knot hole.\" A molecule in this piece of paper is a \"fossil\" from photochemical synthesis in a tree a few years ago. A nucleus of the oxygen in this air is r fossil from thermonuclear combustion at a much higher temperature in a star a few 10 9 years ago. What else can a particle be but a fossil from the most violent event of all, gravitational collapse? That one geological stratum has one many-miles long slope, with marvelous linearity of structure, and another stratum has another slope, is either an everyday triteness, taken as for granted by every passerby, or a miracle, until one understands the mechanism. That an electron here has the same mass as an electron there is also a triviality or a miracle. It is a triviality in quantum electrodynamics because it is assumed rather than derived. However, it is a miracle on any view that regards the universe as being from time to time \"reprocessed.\" How can electrons at different times and places in the present cycle of the universe have the same mass if the spectrum of particle masses differs between one cycle of the universe and another? Inspect the interior of ~particle of one type, and magnify it up enormously, and in that interior see one view of the whole universe [compare the concept of monad of Leibniz (1714), \"The monads have no window through which anything can enter or depart\"]; and do likewise for another particle of the same type. Are particles of the same pattern identical in anyone cycle of the universe because they give identically patterned views of the same universe? No acceptable explanation for the miraculous identity of particles of the same type has ever been put forward. That identity must be regarded, not as a triviality, but as a central mystery of physics. Not the spectrum of particle masses alone, but the physical \"constants\" themselves, would seem most reasonably regarded as reprocessed from one cycle to another. Reprocessed relative to what? Relative, for example, to the Planck system of units, L * = (fiG / C 3 )l/2 = 1.6 X 10- 33 cm, T* = (fiG / C 5 )l/2 = 5.4 X 10- 44 sec, M* = (flC/G)l/2 = 2.2 X 10- 5 g, the only system of units, Planck (1899) pointed out, free, like black-body radiation itself, of all complications of solid-state physics, molecular binding, atomic constitu- tion, and elementary particle structure, and drawing for its background only on the simplest and most universal principles of physics, the laws of gravitation and black- body radiation.

Never has any explanation appeared for their enormous magnitude, nor will there ever, if the view is correct that reprocessing the universe reprocesses also the physical constants. These constants on that view are not part of the laws of physics. They are part of the initial-value data. Such numbers are freshly given for each fresh cycle of expansion of the universe. To look for a physical explanation for the \"big numbers\" would thus seem to be looking for the right answer to the wrong question. In the week between one storm and the next, most features of the weather are ever-changing, but some special patterns of the wind last the week. If the term \"frozen features of the meteorology\" is appropriate for them, much more so would it seem appropriate for the big numbers, the physical constants and the spectrum of particle masses in the cycle between one reprocessing of the universe and another. A per cent or so change one way in one of the \"constants,\" ne/e 2 , will cause all stars to be red stars; and a comparable change the other way will make hll stars be blue stars, according to Carter (1968b). In neither case will any star like the sun be possible. He raises the question whether life could have developed if the deter- minants of the physical constants had differed substantially from those that charac- terize this cycle of the universe. Dicke (1961) has pointed out that the right order of ideas may not be, here is the universe, so what must man be; but here is man, so what must the universe ·Values based on the \"typical cosmological model\" of Box 27.4; subject to much uncertainty, in the present state of astrophysical distance determinations, not least because the latitude in these numbers is even enough to be compatible with an open universe."},{"pageNumber":1244,"pageContent":"be?

So why on this view is the universe as big as it is? Because only so can man be here! In brief, the considerations of Carter and Dicke would seem to raise the idea of the \"biological selection of physical constants.\" However, to \"select\" is impossible unless there are options to select between. Exactly such options would seem for the first time to be held out by the only over-all picture of the gravitational collapse of the universe that one sees how to put forward today, the pregeometry black-box mode! of the reprocessing of the universe. Proceeding with all caution into uncharted territory, one must nevertheless be aware that the conclusions one is reaching and the questions one is asking at a given stage of the analysis may be only stepping stones on the way to still more penetrating questions and an even more remarkable picture. To speak of \"reprocessing and selection\" may only be a halfway point on the road toward thinking of the universe as Leibniz did, as a world of relationships, not a world of machinery. Far from being brought into its present condition by \"reprocessing\" from earlier cycles, may the uni verse in some strange sense be \"brought into being\" by the participa tion of those who participate? On this view the concept of \"cycles\" would even seem to be altogether wrong. Instead the vital act is the act of participation. \"Participator\" is the incontrovertible new concept given by quantum mechanics; it strikes down the term \"observer\" of classical theory, the man who stands safely behind the thick glass wall and watches what goes on without taking part. It can't be done, quantum mechanics says. Even with the lowly electron one must participate before one can give any meaning whatsoever to its position or its momentum. Is this firmly estab- lished result the tiny tip of a giant iceberg? Does the universe also derive its meaning from \"participation\"? Are we destined to return to the great concept of Leibniz, of \"preestablished harmony\" (\"Leibniz logic loop\"), before we can make the next great advance? Rich prospects stand open for investigation in gravitation physics, from neutron stars to cosmology and from post-Newtonian celestial mechanics to gravitational waves. Einstein's geometrodynamics exposes itself to destruction on a dozen fronts and by a thousand predictions. No predictions subject to early test are mOi\"e en- trancing than those on the formation and properties of a black hole, \"laboratory model\" for some of what is predicted for the universe itself. No field is more pregnant with the future than gravitational collapse. No more revolutionary views of man and the universe has one ever been driven to consider seriously than those that come out of pondering the paradox of collapse, the greatest crisis of physics of all time. §44.6.

For more extensive bibliographies of certain segments of the literature, see, for example, Lecat (1924), Boni, Russ, and Laurence (1960), Chick (1960, 1964), and Combridge (1965). Citations are sometimes not to the earliest publication, but to a later and more accessible source. For ease of reference, conference and summer-school proceedings are cited both under editors' names and under the more familiar place names (Brandeis, Les Houches, Varenna, etc.). Persons mentioned in the text without explicit biblio- graphical reference are also indexed here. Most doctoral dissertations in the United States are available from University Microfilms, Inc., Ann Arbor, Mich. 48106. Appreciation is expressed to Gregory Cherlin for preparing the initial version of this bibliography, to Nigel Coote for numerous subsequent amendments, and to colleagues without whose help some of the most elusive, and most important, of these references would have escaped capture.
