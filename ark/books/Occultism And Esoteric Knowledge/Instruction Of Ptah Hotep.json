They desireabove all things that, in their humble way, these books shall be the ambassadorsof good-will and understanding between East and West, the old world of Thought,and the new of Action. In this endeavour, and in their own sphere, they are butfollowers of the highest example in the land. They are confident that a deeperknowledge of the great ideals and lofty philosophy of Oriental thought may helpto a revival of that true spirit of Charity which neither despises nor fears thenations of another creed and colour. Finally, in thanking press and public forthe very cordial reception given to the \"Wisdom of the East\" series, they wishto state that no pains have been spared to secure the best specialists for thetreatment of the various subjects at hand.L. CRANMER-BYNG.S. A. KAPADIA.4, HARCOURT BUILDINGS,INNER TEMPLE,LONDON.THE INSTRUCTION OF PTAH-HOTEPINTRODUCTIONMemorials of the Past—The Land of Darkness—The Time of Ptah-Hotep—Concerning theBook—The Treatise of Ke'Gemni—Date of the Manuscript—An EgyptianChesterfield—Who was Ptah-Hotep?—His Teaching—Views on Women—The Gods ofEgypt—Previous Translations—The Oldest Book KnownIs there anything whereof it may be said,See, this is new!It hath been already of old time,Which was before us.There is no remembrance of former things;Neither shall there be any remembranceOf things that are to comeWith those that shall come after.In these days, when all things and memories of the past are at length become notonly subservient to, but submerged by, the matters and needs of the immediatepresent, those paths of knowledge that lead into regions seemingly remote fromsuch needs are somewhat discredited; and the aims of those that follow themwhither they lead are regarded as quite out of touch with the real interests oflife. Very greatly is this so with archaeology, and the study of ancient andcurious tongues, and searchings into old thoughts on high and ever-insistentquestions; a public which has hardly time to read more than its daily newspaperand its weekly novel has denounced—almost dismissed—them, with many other nobleand wonderful things, as 'unpractical,' whatever that vague and hollow word maymean.As to those matters which lie very far back, concerning the lands of severalthousand years ago, it is very generally held that they are the proper andpeculiar province of specialists, dry-as-dusts, and persons with an irreducibleminimum of human nature. It is thought that knowledge concerning them, not theblank ignorance regarding them that almost everywhere obtains, is a thing ofwhich to be rather ashamed, a detrimental possession; in a word, that thesubject is not only unprofitable (a grave offence), but also uninteresting, andtherefore contemptible. This is a true estimate of general opinion, althoughthere are those who will, for their own sakes, gainsay it.When, therefore, I state that one of the writings herein translated has an ageof nearly six thousand years, and that another is but five hundred yearsyounger, it is likely that many will find this sufficient reason against furtherperusal, deeming it impossible that such things can possess attraction for onenot an enthusiast for them. Yet so few are the voices across so great a span ofyears that those among them having anything to tell us should be welcomeexceedingly; whereas, for the most part, they have cried in the wilderness ofneglect hitherto, or fallen on ears filled with the clamour of more instantthings.I could show, if this were a fitting place, that Archaeology is not at alldivorced from life, nor even devoid of emotion as subtle and strange, as swiftand moving, as that experienced by those who love and follow Art. She,Archaeology, is, for those who know her, full of such emotion; garbed in animperishable glamour, she is raised far above the turmoil of the present on thewings of Imagination. Her eyes are sombre with the memory of the wisdom drivenfrom her scattered sanctuaries; and at her lips wonderful things strive forutterance. In her are gathered together the longings and the laughter, the fearsand failures, the sins and splendours and achievements of innumerablegenerations of men; and by her we are shown all the elemental and terriblepassions of the unchanging soul of man, to which all cultures and philosophiesare but garments to hide its nakedness; and thus in her, as in Art, some of usmay realise ourselves. Withal she is heavy-hearted, making continual lamentationfor a glory that has withered and old hopes without fulfilment; and all herhabitations are laid waste.As for the true lover of all old and forgotten things, it may justly be said ofhim, as of the poet, Nascitur, non fit. For the dreams and the wonder are withhim from the beginning; and in early childhood, knowing as yet hardly the namesof ancient peoples, he is conscious of, and yearns instinctively toward, animmense and ever-receding past. With the one, as with the other, theunaccountable passion is so knitted into his soul that it will never, among athousand distractions and adverse influences, entirely forsake him; nor can suchan one by willing cause it to come or to depart. He will live much inimagination, therein treading fair places now enwrapped in their inevitableshroud of wind-blown sand; building anew temples whose stones hardly remain oneupon the other, consecrate to gods dead as their multitudes of worshippers;holding converse with the sages who, with all their lore, could not escape theultimate oblivion: a spectator of splendid pageants, a ministrant at strangerites, a witness to vast tragedies, he also has admittance to the magicalkingdom, to which is added the freedom of the city of Remembrance. His care willbe to construct, patiently and with much labour, a picture (which is often lessthan an outline) of the conditions of the humanity that has been; and he neitherrejects nor despises any relic, however trivial or unlovely, that will help him,in its degree, to understand better that humanity or to bridge the wide chasmsof his ignorance. Moreover, great age hallows all things, even the most mean,investing them with a certain sanctity; and the little sandal of a namelesschild, or the rude amulet placed long ago with weeping on the still bosom of afriend, will move his heart as strongly by its appeal as the proud and enduringmonument of a great conqueror insatiable of praise. At times, moving among thetokens of a period that the ravenous years dare not wholly efface in passing, hehears, calling faintly as from afar, innumerable voices—the voices of those who,stretching forth in Sheol eager hands toward Life, greatly desire that somememorial of them, be it but a name, may survive in the world of men....Ancient Egypt fares perhaps better than other countries of antiquity at thehands of the 'general reader,' and sometimes obtains a hearing when they do not,by reason of its intimate contact at certain periods with the nation that hasbrought us the Old Testament. Because of this the report of it has been with usconstantly, and it has nearly become a symbol in religion. The stories of Mosesand the magicians, and of the dealings of Abraham and Joseph with Pharaoh,together with the rude woodcuts of Egyptian taskmasters and cupbearers in familyBibles, have invested the venerable land with a dreamy mystery; while every onehas heard of 'Rameses, the Pharaoh of the Oppression,' and 'Meneptah, thePharaoh of the Exodus.' And it is possible that for the sake of suchassociation, if not for his own sake, Ptah-hotep will be considered worthy ofnotice.But in spite of the fact that the Ancient Egyptians enjoy rather more popularitythan their contemporaries, it is evident that the books which they wrote areclosed books to those who have not the glamour of vanished peoples, and thefascination of mighty cities now made desolate, strong upon them.Yet in the heterogeneous and pitiful flotsam that reluctant seas have washed tous piecemeal from a remote past, there are, as will be shown later, many thingswhich, although proceeding from a culture and modes of thought as far removedfrom our own as they may well be,[1[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn1]]are worth the reading, which do not require any special knowledge for theirunderstanding; and of these are the translations in this book.The following pages, which, although addressed to the 'general reader,' may yetbe of some assistance to those especially interested in Egypt, give, among othermatters, the place of the Instructions of Ptah-hotep and Ke'gemni in the'literature' of Egypt; their place—their unique place—in the literature of theworld; their value historically; a description of the document in which theywere found; what is known of their authors; a discussion of their contents.The land of which the Father of History declared that no other country held somany wonders, has bequeathed us, by various channels, the rumour and remnant ofa strange knowledge. She has devised us enigmas insoluble, and rendered up to ussigns and messages whose meaning is dark for all time. And she has left areligion, 'veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbol,' as fascinating asimpenetrable for those who approach it. For into our hands the keys of thesethings have not been delivered; wherefore much study of them is a weariness tothe flesh, and of the hazarding of interpretations there is no end.But apart from the mazes of mythology, the broken ways of history and the emptyletter of a dead faith, there are, as is known to some, and as this little bookprofesses to show, many documents which are antique, but not antiquated,possessing interest above the purely archaeological—the interest called human.Of these are the tales which recall, in incident as in style, those of theimmortal collection, full of the whole glamour of the East, the Thousand Nightsand a Night. Such are the love-songs, full of the burning utterance of desire;the pathetic and even bitter dirges, whose singers have seen all the works thatare done under the sun, and found all to be vanity and vexation of spirit. Andsuch also are the didactic poems for the instruction of youth, which—in poeticphrase and in great detail—inculcate, among other things, the practice of rightconduct as the price of happiness; a courtesy hardly less considerate than ourown; and a charity which, when certain inevitable shortcomings are allowed for,bears comparison with almost any later system. Out of these there are many thatmay properly claim a place in a series bearing the seal of the Wisdom of theEast, though they belong only to the more objective and 'practical' side of thatWisdom.But, as touching the books here translated—the Instructions of Ptah-hotep and ofKe'gemni—they possess, apart from the curious nature of their contents, afeature of the greatest interest, and an adequate claim on the notice of allpersons interested in literature and its history. For if the datings andascriptions in them be accepted as trustworthy (there is no reason why theyshould not be so accepted), they were composed about four thousand years beforeChrist, and three thousand five hundred and fifty years before Christ,respectively. And the significance of those remote dates is, that they are theoldest books in the world, the earliest extant specimens of the literary art.They stand on the extreme horizon of all that ocean of paper and ink that hasbecome to us as an atmosphere, a fifth element, an essential of life.Books of many kinds had of course been written for centuries before Ptah-hotepof Memphis summarised, for the benefit of future generations, the leadingprinciples of morality current in his day; even before the Vizier, five hundredyears earlier, gave to his children the scroll which they prized above allthings on earth;[2[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn2]]but those have perished and these remain. There are lists of titles which have alarge sound, and prayers to the Gods for all good things, on the tombs andmonuments of kings and magnates long before the time of Ke'gemni; but those arenot books in any sense of that word. Even the long, strange chants and spellsengraven in the Royal Pyramids over against Memphis are later than the time ofPtah-hotep, and cannot be called books in their present form, although some ofthem apparently originated before the First Dynasty.[3[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn3]]Nor do the oldest books of any other country approach these two in antiquity. Todraw comparisons between them let us, in imagination, place ourselves at theperiod at which Ptah-hotep lived, that is, about B.C. 3550, 'under King Isôsi,living for ever,' and take a glance at futurity.The Babylonians are doubtless exercising their literary talents; but they willleave nothing worthy the name of book to the far posterity of fifty-fourcenturies hence. Thirteen centuries shall pass before Hammurabi, King ofBabylon, drafts the code of laws that will be found at that time. Only after twothousand years shall Moses write on the origin of things, and the Vedas bearranged in their present form. It will be two-and-a-half thousand years beforethe Great King of Jerusalem will set in order many proverbs and write books somuch resembling, in form and style, that of Ptah-hotep;[4[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn4]]before the source and summit of European literature will write his world epics.For the space of years between Solomon and ourselves, great though it seem, isnot so great as that between Solomon and Ptah-hotep.The number of extant texts of the class to which the subjoined immediatelybelong is not large in proportion to the rest of Egyptian MSS., but they seem tobe representative of the class, being diverse in date and subject, but similarin form. There is great uniformity in the arrangement of most of them, in thefollowing respects. They have as title the word 'Instruction' (seb'ôyet), andare written by a father for the advantage of his son; they are very poetic intheir arrangement of words and phrases, and are usually divided into shortsections or paragraphs by the use of red ink for the first sentence of each.Such is the Instruction of Ptah-hotep on morality (the finest of its class); theInstruction of King Amenemhê'et on the hollowness of friendship and othermatters; the Instruction of Deu'of, the son of Kherti, on the excellence of theliterary life; and others. In many respects and in many details they greatlyresemble the didactic works of the Old Testament and Apocrypha.These 'Instructions' were held in high esteem as text-books and writingexercises in schools—a circumstance to which we owe the preservation of many ofthem. For a considerable number of important and interesting poems, letters, andnarratives are only known to us from school exercise-books. The pupil at the'Chamber of Instruction' wrote out about three pages of these each day, as ameans of improving his writing, as a model of style in composition, and forpurposes of edification. These exercises abound in errors of spelling andgrammar, having sometimes the master's corrections elegantly written above inred. As may be imagined, a schoolboy's scrawl over three thousand years old isno easy thing to translate; but faute de mieux the Egyptologist welcomes anyversion, even the most barbarous. Fortunately, the MS. from which thesetranslations come is not of this kind; a detailed description of it may interestsome of my readers.The Prisse Papyrus, which is well known by name and a few extracts to allpersons conversant with Egyptian matters, was acquired in Egypt by M. Prissed'Avennes, a French archaeologist of distinction, and published by him in1847.[5[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn5]]The exact place of its discovery is unknown. M. Prisse is said to have bought itof one of the fellahîn whom he employed to make excavations at the burial-groundof Thebes. This man pretended that he had no knowledge of its finding, as he wastrying to sell it for a friend. It is believed that it was actually taken by theArab from the tomb of one of the Kings 'Entef;[6[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn6]]but this is not certain. If it were, it would perhaps enable us to fix aterminus ad que, for the writing of this copy, although tombs often containobjects of later date. The papyrus was presented in about 1847, by M. Prisse, tothe Bibliotheque Nationale (in those days the Bibliotheque Royale) at Paris,where it still is, divided and glazed in the usual manner.Spread out flat, it measures about 23 ft. 7 in., with an average height of 5 7/8in., which is about the usual height of papyri of the Eleventh and TwelfthDynasties. It contains at present eighteen pages of heavy and bold black and redwriting, in the so-called hieratic character. At first sight it appears to be inperfect preservation, being entirely free from the cracks and decay which marmany fine manuscripts of far later date; but an examination of the contentsshows that an unknown quantity has been torn off from the commencement.Originally the roll contained at least two books, of which we have the latterpart of one and the whole of the other. Between these there is a blank space ofsome 53 in.The characters are clearly and carefully made, but are not always correct, asthough the copyist had a badly written or very cursive copy before him, and wasnot always sure of his spelling.The first of these books, of which only the last two pages remain to us, is atreatise on deportment, and is here called the Instruction of Ke'gemni. It hasalways been attributed to this person since its discovery, but examination of asmuch of the book as exists will show that it is not said to have been written byhim. Because his is the only name mentioned, Egyptologists have concluded thathe is the author. The unnamed Vizier, who called his children to him, can hardlybe Ke'gemni, who was not raised to the rank of Vizier and Governor of a cityuntil afterwards. Ke'gemni may well have been a son of the author. This is notof material importance, however, as the date of writing is given as the end ofthe reign of Heuni, the last King of the Third Dynasty, who died about 3998 B.C.This book, then, which argues a society of some refinement, is, so far as itgoes, the oldest in the world.After a long stretch of blank papyrus, from which a third book has perhaps beenerased, we come upon the Instruction of Ptah-hotep in its entirety, divided intosections by red writing, as aforesaid.[7[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn7]]In this, also, we get a definite date, for we learn in the opening lines thatits author (or compiler) lived in the reign of King Isôsi. Now Isôsi was thelast ruler but one of the Fifth Dynasty, and ruled forty-four years, from about3580 to 3536 B.C. Thus we may take about 3550 as the period of Ptah-hotep.Of these two kings there is hardly anything to say. Heuni is only known to us bymention of his name; we have no record of any act of his. Of Isôsi the onlyexploit that remains is this: that he sent his Treasurer, Be'wêrded, toSomaliland[8[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn8]]to obtain for him a certain kind of dwarf; this the Treasurer brought back, andreceived much reward therefor. That is all that is left of the reigns of twokings, who ruled long, who perhaps ruled greatly and wisely, having just causeto hope that their fame and the report of their good deeds might never passaway. Such is the fate of kings.The copy of these Instructions that we have, the only complete copy,[9[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn9]]is far later than the later of these dates. An examination of the writing showsthat it is not earlier than the Eleventh Dynasty, and is probably of theTwelfth.[10[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn10]]More than this cannot be said; where it was written, by whom, and when, are notstated, as they are in many cases. The writing lacks the fine regularity of thatof the professional scribes of the Twelfth Dynasty, and has many points ofdivergence therefrom; but the papyrus is assigned by the best judges to thisperiod. This gives it an antiquity of about four thousand five hundred years;and it looks good to last as long again, if only it be not examined over-muchnor brought out into the light too often. It is as fresh and readable as in theyear after it was written. Will the books of our time last one-tenth so long? Itis not without a feeling of awe, even of sadness, that one with any sense of thewonder of things gazes for the first time on the old book, and thinks of all ithas survived. So many empires have arisen and gone down since those words werepenned, so many great and terrible things have been.And we are fortunate indeed in having such a book as this of Ptah-hotep for themost ancient complete literary work extant. For not by any magical texts, orhymns and prayers, should we be so well shown the conditions of that early time;but our moralist, by advancing counsels of perfection for every contingency, hasleft us a faithful record of his age. The veil of five-and-a-half thousand yearsis rent, and we are met with a vivid and a fascinating picture of the domesticand social life of the 'Old Kingdom.' We read of the wife, who must be treatedkindly at all costs; the genial generosity of the rich man, and the scowlingboor, a thorn in the side of his friends and relations, the laughing-stock ofall men; the unquenchable talkers of every station in life, who argue high, whoargue low, who also argue round about them, as common as now in the East, andthe trusted councillor, weighing every word; the obstinate ignoramus who seeseverything inverted, listening open-mouthed to the disjointed gossip of thosenear him, and the scholar, conversing freely with learned and unlearned alike,recognising that, measured against the infinite possibilities of knowledge andskill, we are all much of the same stature; the master of the estate orprovince, treated with infinite respect by his subordinates in rank and wealth,and the paid servants that are never satisfied, who leave after presents havebeen made them; the hard-working clerk who casts accounts all day, and thetradesmen who will perhaps give you credit when money is dear, if you havepreviously made friends of them; the well-bred diner-out, lightly passing on hisfavourite dish, contenting himself with plain fare, and the gourmand who visitshis friends at meal-times, departing only when the larder is entirely exhausted.Not only do we find such characters as these in Ptah-hotep's hand-book, butinteresting scenes are brought near to us by the writing-reed of that primaevalChesterfield. We find ourselves taking supper at the table of a great man. Hissubordinates sit round, scarcely daring to raise their eyes from their food, notspeaking to their host until spoken to. He serves the food that is before himaccording to his liking for each guest; and the less favoured find solace in thereflection that even the distribution of food is according to Providence. Wepass on. Now we are in the hall of council with the other overseers andofficials of the province, and our overlord presiding. We notice withastonishment the extreme solemnity and strict observance of custom andprecedence in this archaic period. Many of those who have met report on thematters under their charge, and others debate on them. The one now speaking isdiscussing a trade about which he knows nothing, and an expert rises and makesvery short work of his opponent's arguments. Now we are among some peopledividing up property. One of them has tried, of course, to bully his friendsinto giving him more than his due share, and, having failed, leaves the house ina rage. He will regret it later. And so on.Nothing definite is known concerning these two nobles beyond what is said ofthem in their works. A fine tomb of a certain Ke'gemni exists at Memphis; histitles, so far as can be ascertained,[11[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn11]]are: Judge of the High Court: Governor of the Land unto its Limit, South andNorth: Director of every Command. He has sometimes been supposed to be identicalwith our Ke'gemni; but I am assured by those most competent to judge that thistomb cannot be earlier than the Fifth Dynasty (a good three hundred years fromthe date assigned to the moralist), so that the theory that they are one personmay be dismissed as highly improbable. No other person of the name is known.The position is much the same with Ptah-hotep. There are near Memphis the tombsof several nobles of this name, of whom two lived in the reign of Isôsi; and inthis case, again, it has been assumed that one[12[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn12]]of these two must be the writer of the Instruction. But in neither instance dothe titles coincide with or include those assigned to him. The highest titlewhich he bears, Eldest Son of the King, does not anywhere appear in these tombs.It is true that one of these contemporaries was Hereditary Chief; but we knowthat Ptah-hotep was a common name at this time, and in the absence of morecertain proof it will be well to abstain from the identification of like namesupon insufficient grounds. Thus it is only by the chance discovery of thisscroll that these two princes of old time, whose bodies are blown about thedesert dust these many centuries, are secured from utter oblivion; men 'such asdid bear rule in their kingdoms, men renowned for their power, giving counsel bytheir understanding, and declaring prophecies: Leaders of the people by theircounsels, and by their knowledge of learning meet for the people, wise andeloquent in their instructions.' And against such as these, that from remoteyears 'have left a name behind them, that their praises might be reported,' howmany are there 'which have no memorial; who are perished, as though they hadnever been; and are become as though they had never been born; and theirchildren after them.'[13[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn13]]I had intended to make a detailed analysis of the moral sense of Ptah-hotep andKe'gemni, but it appears unnecessary; since they give their advice so clearlyand simply, they may safely be left to speak for themselves. But as especiallynoteworthy I would point to the gracious tolerance of ignorance enjoined in § 1(Ptah-hotep), and the fine reason given for that injunction, in contrast withthe scorn expressed for the obstinate fool (Ph. 40); the care due to a wife (Ph.21), which is in signal contrast to the custom of other Eastern nations in thisrespect;[14[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn14]]the great stress laid on filial duties (Ph. 38, 39, 41, 42, 43); the enthusiasmfor obedience, expressed in a jargon of puns (Ph. 38), which, once thehigh-watermark of style among Egyptian literati, has long since lost its savour;the interesting matter on manners at table (Kg. 2, 3, Ph. 7, 9), in society (Kg.4, Ph. 14, 18, 20, 34), and in official positions (Ph. 5, 8, 13, 15, 16, 17, 24,28). A rough classification including many sections is here given:Duties toward superiors (Ph. 2, 7, 8, 10, 16, 27, 31).Duties toward equals (3, 6, 14, 18, 20, 26, 29, 33, 35, 37).Duties toward inferiors (1, 4, 5, 16, 17, 22). The whole teaching resolves intothe maxim, \"Be good, and you will be happy;\" not at all in the sense that virtueis its own reward—I do not think that that would have seemed an adequate returnto Ptah-hotep—but in the sense of material welfare rewarding, as a matter ofcourse, an honourable life. Following his reasoning, if a man be obedient as ason, punctilious as a servant, generous and gentle as a master, and courteous asa friend, then all good things shall fall to him, he shall reach a green old agehonoured by the King, and his memory shall be long in the land. This theory,which is not found satisfactory in our day, is insisted on by most of theancient moralists, who appear to regard it, not as a substitute for conscience,but rather as a raison d'être or justification thereof. Yet, centuries before aKing of Israel had seen all things that are, and found them vanity, a King ofEgypt had left it on record that he had done all good things for his subjects,and that 'there was no satisfaction therein.'It has been said with some truth of codes of morals and laws that what isomitted is almost as important as what is included. But we must not carry thistoo far; we should be foolish indeed did we assert that those things omittedfrom such a code as Ptah-hotep's were not practised or not held to be importantin his day. For example, he 'knows nothing'—as a Higher Critic would say—ofkindness to animals; but we know from many things that the Egyptians treatedanimals kindly and made much of them as pets. In the very tomb of thatPtah-hotep mentioned above,[15[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn15]]who may be our author, is depicted the bringing of three dogs and a tame monkeyto him while he is dressing; possibly so that he may feed them himself. And thiskindly feeling obtained throughout Egyptian history. They treated animals moreas 'dumb friends' in those days than might have been a priori expected, andmore, perhaps, than any other nation of antiquity. Again, he 'knows nothing' ofduties to the mother, although he is so insistent on duties to the father; butthe high position of women and their matriarchal privileges oppose any deductionthat Egyptian manners were somewhat to seek in this direction. Ke'gemni says ofthe unsociable man that he is a grief to his mother, and another moralist ofuncertain date (perhaps Twelfth Dynasty, about B.C. 2700), named 'Eney, isexplicit on this matter. He says to his son, 'I gave thee thy mother, she thatbore thee with much suffering.... She placed thee at the Chamber of Instructionfor the sake of thine instruction in books; she was constant to thee daily,having loaves and beer in her house. When thou art grown, and hast taken to theea wife, being master in thy house, cast thine eyes on the one that gave theebirth and provided thee with all good things, as did thy mother. Let her notreproach thee, lest she lift up her hands to the God, and He hear her prayer.'And, most remarkable of all omissions, there is nothing said as to duties to theGods. In Egypt, whose Gods are beyond counting, where almost everybody was apriest, Ptah-hotep—himself a 'Holy Father' and 'Beloved of the God'—has no wordto say on religious obligations, devoting his work entirely to the principles ofcharity and duty to one's neighbour. It is seemingly sufficient to him that onedo the right in this world, without thinking overmuch about the other. This isthe more curious in that other writers of the same class have many injunctionsregarding worship and sacrifice; and so complete is his reserve touching thismatter, so important in the eyes of other Egyptians, that it is easy to believethat it was intentional. We may even discern in him a protagonist of the modern'Ethical School,' whose adherents may be interested to find their viewsimplicitly held so long ago.Notwithstanding this singularity, he is by no means unmindful of Deity. Wenotice that he has occasion to speak several times of 'the God'[16[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn16]]in His relation to humanity and human affairs. If we collect these references tothe God, we shall find that the following qualities are attributed to Him. Herewards diligence (9, 10) and punishes sin (6, 10; also Kg. 5); He is the giverof good things (Ph. 22, 30, 43), dispenses fate and preordains events (6, 7, 9,26), loves His creation (26), observes men's actions (10), desires them to befruitful and multiply (12). All this is in complete accord with the belief ofother religions—including Christianity—regarding the Godhead. And here we touchanother pleasing characteristic of this most ancient of books—its catholicspirit and disregard of those mythological and esoteric riddles that mostEgyptian works propound to us continually. It will be noticed that 'the God' isnot anywhere mentioned by name. Osiris (5) and Horus (41) are alluded to, butonly historically, in respect of their rule upon earth, not as present powers.The reason is this, that at that time the Gods, even the great Gods, were onlylocal, that is to say, their worship was confined to certain towns or districts('nomes'), and beyond the boundaries of these their names lost that power andinfluence which they exerted in their peculiar provinces. A book, therefore,which spoke of one God only—by name—would have been found much limited as topopularity and use. Hence the old moralists and didactic writers, whatever Godthey might themselves worship, forebore to mention Him, since by many readers Hewould not be recognised as paramount; they wrote instead, 'The God,' that is,'the God of your allegiance, whoever He may be.' Thus, were the reader a nativeof Heliopolis, his God would be Atômu, the Setting Sun; of Memphis, Ptah, theRevealer; of Hermopolis, Thoth, Master of Divine Words and Chief of the Eight.It was for this reason that the unknown author of what is called the 'NegativeConfession'[17[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn17]]makes the deceased say, 'I have not scorned the God of my town.' And, indeed, sosimply and purely does Ptah-hotep speak of the God that the modern reader can,without the least degradation of his ideals, consider the author as referring tothe Deity of monotheism, and if he be of Christendom, read God; if of Islam,read Allah; if of Jewry, Jehovah.[18[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn18]]No doubt the gulf fixed between teaching and practice was as great then as now.We have the teaching, we know that the teaching was current all over Egypt invarious forms, but of the practice we know very little. Human nature being muchthe same at all times and places, we must beware of measuring the one by theother, the unknown by the known, and must be content to take such counsels asshowing the Egyptian—Not what he was, but what he should have been.It is established that they were a kindly, peace-loving people, genial andcourtly; but whether law-abiding is another matter. We know nothing about theirlaws, but we know that the law-courts were busy, and that legal officials werenumerous; and we know, further, that their duplicity and lack ofstraightforwardness were proverbial among the Greeks and Romans, and persists tothis day.I have noted above the resemblance of the Egyptian Instructions to the Jewishdidactic books (Proverbs and Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament, Wisdom ofSolomon and Ecclesiasticus in the Apocrypha); this will be obvious to allreaders. Compare, e.g., the opening of Ptah-hotep (§B) with the opening ofProverbs. It is not necessary to point out all the parallels in detail.I come, lastly, to speak of other translations.[19[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn19]]The first into any language was that of the Rev. D. I. Heath, Vicar of Brading,Isle of Wight. This version, which first appeared in 1856, was ruined by thetranslator's theory that the Prisse Papyrus contained references to the Exodus,and was written by the 'Shepherd-King,' Aphobis. How he obtained that name fromPtah-hotep, how he read the Exodus into his book, or how he got three-fourths ofhis translation, it is not possible to say. Written in a style which is initself a matter for decipherment, it is full of absurdities and gratuitousmistakes, and is entirely worthless. It is one more instance of the lamentableresults that arise when a person with a preconceived Biblical theory comes intocontact with Egyptian records. In the following year M. Chabas did part of thepapyrus into French, and, as might be expected of an Egyptologist of suchattainments, his version was infinitely more accurate than the foregoing. In1869 Herr Lauth made a translation—also partial—into Latin, and in 1884; M.Philippe Virey published a careful study and complete translation of both books.His rendering[20[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-0.htm.html#chap01fn20]]was subsequently translated into English and published (with some alterations)in Records of the Past, 1890, and has remained the only complete translation inEnglish. It has been taken bodily (even the footnotes) into Myer's Oldest Booksin the World, and has been put into charming verse by Canon Rawnsley in hisNotes for the Nile. Thus it appears to be, in a sense, the standard version.Nevertheless, it leaves very much to be desired in point of accuracy, althoughthe general sense of each section is usually caught. Of later years Mr. Griffithhas done important work on this text, and I am indebted to his translations forseveral readings.As regards the version here offered, I will only say that it has been done withconsiderable care, without prejudice, and, it is thought, in accordance withscientific methods of translation; and that it has been compared with allprevious renderings, and will be found to be, on the whole, the most accuratethat has yet appeared.And now I will leave Ptah-hotep to speak for himself. It may be thought that hehas been introduced at too great length; but I would point out that his book hasbeen strangely overlooked by the educated public hitherto, although it would bedifficult to over-estimate its importance, to literature as the oldest completebook known, to ethics and theology as the earliest expression of the mystery wename Conscience, and to lovers of antiquity as one of the most instructive andtouching relics of a people and a power that once were great and are now broughtto nothing. By a happy chance the words of our sage have been justified, in thathe said, 'No word that hath here been set down shall cease out of the land forever.' Would indeed that we had more of such books as this, whereby we may alittle lighten the darkness that lies behind the risings of a million suns; andlearn how little the human heart, and the elements of human intercourse, alterthroughout the ages. And what of the other writers of that time, whose works andwhose very names are entirely swept away? To this there is no better answer madethan in the lamentation made by the harper close upon five thousand years ago,which was written up in the tomb of King 'Entef:Those that built them tombs, he sang, have now no resting-place. Lo! what oftheir deeds? I have heard the words of Yemhotep and of Hardedef, whose sayingsmen repeat continually. Behold! where are their abodes?

The Governor of his City, the Vizier, Ptah-hotep, he said: 'O Prince, myLord, the end of life is at hand; old age descendeth [upon me]; feeblenesscometh, and childishness is renewed. He [that is old] lieth down in misery everyday. The eyes are small; the ears are deaf. Energy is diminished, the heart hathno rest. The mouth is silent, and he speaketh no word; the heart stoppeth, andhe remembereth not yesterday. The bones are painful throughout the body; goodturneth unto evil. All taste departeth. These things doeth old age for mankind,being evil in all things. The nose is stopped, and he breatheth not for weakness(?), whether standing or sitting.'Command me, thy servant, therefore, to make over my princely authority [to myson].

Be not proud because thou art learned; but discourse with the ignorant man,as with the sage. For no limit can be set to skill, neither is there anycraftsman that possesseth full advantages. Fair speech is more rare than theemerald that is found by slave-maidens on the pebbles.2. If thou find an arguer talking, one that is well disposed and wiser thanthou, let thine arms fall, bend thy back,[3[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@30508@30508-h@30508-h-1.htm.html#chap02fn3]]be not angry with him if he agree (?) not with thee.

If thou find an arguer talking, thy fellow, one that is within thy reach,keep not silence when he saith aught that is evil; so shalt thou be wiser thanhe. Great will be the applause on the part of the listeners, and thy name shallbe good in the knowledge of princes.4. If thou find an arguer talking, a poor man, that is to say not thine equal,be not scornful toward him because he is lowly. Let him alone; then shall heconfound himself. Question him not to please thine heart, neither pour out thywrath upon him that is before thee; it is shameful to confuse a mean mind. Ifthou be about to do that which is in thine heart, overcome it as a thingrejected of princes.5.

Cause not fear among men; for [this] the God punisheth likewise. For there isa man that saith, 'Therein is life'; and he is bereft of the bread of his mouth.There is a man that saith, 'Power [is therein]'; and he saith, 'I seize formyself that which I perceive.' Thus a man speaketh, and he is smitten down. Itis another that attaineth by giving unto him that hath not; not he that causethmen dread.

If thou be an emissary sent from one noble to another, be exact after themanner of him that sent thee, give his message even as he hath said it. Bewareof making enmity by thy words, setting one noble against the other by pervertingtruth.

He [that is covetous] cometh empty from among hisneighbours, being void of the persuasion of speech. One hath remorse for even alittle covetousness when his belly cooleth.21.

Repeat not extravagant speech, neither listen thereto; for it is theutterance of a body heated by wrath. When such speech is repeated to thee,hearken not thereto, look to the ground.

It is written in a terse and pointed style,combined with the parallelism and antithesis which was the prevailing vehicle ofpoetic thought in Egyptian. The rank of its author and the exceeding bitternessof his mood make it a document of great interest. There is no reason to doubtits authenticity.This King was the founder of the glorious Twelfth Dynasty, a period which hasbeen called the Golden Age of Egypt. He ruled from about 2778-2748 B.C., and,although he describes himself as over-lenient, was really one of the mostvigorous and powerful of all the Sons of the Sun who for five thousand yearswore the double crown of the Two Egypts.The circumstances in which the new dynasty arose are not known; nor have we anyother record of the attempt on his life, here recounted. In the twentieth yearof his reign he associated his son, Senwesert I., with him in a co-regency whichlasted ten years. From §8 we gather that the attempted assassination took placejust before the dual rule; while the Instruction was evidently penned shortlybefore the writer's death. The 'house' referred to is presumably hispyramid-tomb, called Ke'-nôfer-amenemhê'et. Amenemhê'et is exalted and good. Thesite of this building is not known.This Instruction was popular as a school exercise in the 'New Kingdom,' and wepossess several copies or parts of copies. There is no good text for the latterpart (§§ 12 ff), which is corrupt in such MSS. as contain it.I have used the critical text of Mr. Griffith, published in the Zeitschrift fürägyptische Sprache, 1896.It is hoped that the Bibliography will be useful to students of the books ofPtah-hotep and Ke'gemni.B.
