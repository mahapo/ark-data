The intellect of Plato has merited universal admiration for he combined extraordinary mental capacity with a lofty idealism. Plato was an initiate of the State Mysteries. He had intended to follow in the footsteps of Pythagoras by journeying into Asia to study with the Brahmins. But the wars of the time made such a trip impractical, so Plato turned to the Egyptians, and, according to the ancient accounts, was initiated at Sais by the priests of the Osirian rites. Having concluded his journeys, Plato established in Athens a school which he called the Lyceum. This school has been referred to as the first university and the archetype of all the great institutions of learning that now flourish in human so - ciety. The Lyceum was unhealthily located, being surrounded by swampy ground. Plato was taken ill but refused to leave the place, declaring that wisdom could adjust itself to any environ - ment. He proved his point, regained his vigor, and continued to teach until his eighty-first year when he died in his sleep with the books of Sophron for a pillow. To Plato, philosophy and theology were one body of learning. He taught that the physical world was the shadow or reflec - tion of the divine world; that all forms were suspended from principles; and that all extensions of energy bore witness to a INTIATION OF PLATO"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 Initiation of Plato sovereign unity, the splendid source of life and the nurse of all living things. As we look about us in modern society, we find among the contemporary learned no mind even comparable to that of Pla - to. We ask ourselves why ancient Greece was able to produce over five hundred immortal philosophers and mathematicians, and the greater privileges of our day result in only an occasion - ally outstanding figure. Some advance the opinion that all men today possess so much knowledge that greatness is not the contrast that it used to be. It seems to me, however, that such an explanation is in - sufficient. The truth is that the type of civilization under which we live is not conducive to true greatness. The materialist can - not be great. The Babbit cannot be great. Small attitudes cannot produce broad minds, and the ado - ration of wealth and power is so evidently false that nothing very fine can be expected to rise therefrom. The greatness of the ancients is directly traceable to their re- ligio-philosophical institutions now called the Mysteries. The Greek Mysteries were the foundation of the State and protec - tors of communal security. The temples of the Mysteries rep - resented the finest achievements in architecture and art, and housed the literature and learning of many earlier generations. The temples of initiation were often buildings of great size; the great shrine of Eleusis in Attica, according to the old records, could hold 25,000 persons at one time. The Mystery Schools were more than cultural forces; they were the culture and civilization of the time. The Greek educational system included initiation into the State Mysteries. The Lesser Mysteries were given quarterly and were conferred upon any person of good character who applied for initiation. At certain times women were initiated, and chil - dren above the sixth year were admitted."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 Introduction The rituals of the Lesser Mysteries were in the form of dra - matic pageantry. In the Eleusinian system, the first degree in - cluded the abduction of Persephone by Pluto as its principal theme. From among those who excelled in the Lesser Mysteries, the priests chose such as they considered worthy to compete for the Greater Mysteries. Those who passed successfully the tests of the higher degree formed a group apart. They were the heroes, the race that dwelt between gods and men, and they were honored by all society. The door of every house was open to them. Even princes had to show them due reverence. The initiate was above even the king unless the sovereign also was, as in Egypt, the high priest of the temple. The initiates gave allegiance only to the temple that initiated them. The Mysteries were truly the high spot of the State. The rituals of the Greater Mysteries involved mortal haz- ards. The candidate must face bodily danger, emotional dan - ger, and mental danger. Only a person of sound body, normal emotions, and balanced mind could possibly succeed in pass - ing the tests. In addition, the candidate had to reveal to his initiators a profound knowledge of the arts and sciences and universal learning. From the scanty records available it appears that only a few hundred people passed successfully the Greater Mysteries and achieved the divine estate. At the end of the initiations, the successful candidate re- ceived the secrets of personal development and the arcane of the temple; that is, the key to the interpretation of the reli - gious fables. The Mysteries bestowed upon their initiates some peculiar internal dignity which they had not previously pos - sessed. It is said of Pythagoras that perfect strangers meeting him upon the road fell upon their knees before him, overcome by some mysterious force which he emanated. The same is told"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 Initiation of Plato of Apollonius of Tyana who quelled a riot by merely standing before the contending persons without speaking. So complete were the vows and obligations of secrecy that the inner mysteries of the initiatory rites have never been exposed, divulged, or desecrated. Only an occasional hint enables us to trace even a part of the old rites. Fertile sources of these hints are the comedies of Aristophanes and the books of Plato. The best evidence of the significance of the Mysteries is to be found in the lives and writings of those who received the initiations. Among the most famous are the names of Plato, Pythagoras, and Aristotle. These men were among the wisest of mortals, yet they acknowledged that in comparison to the wisdom contained in the adytum of the Mysteries, everything they knew and taught was as nothing. Incredible as this may seem it bears out the thoughts of Porphyry, who wrote that the initiates during their trials participated in a divine splendor and the gods themselves attended the initiators. The Greek Mysteries gradually retired into obscurity after the rise of the Roman Empire. By the twelfth century of the Christian Era they had entirely disappeared from public view. Fragments of them survived in the early Christian mystical sects. The initiation of Plato as here reproduced was translated by John Yarker from the French of Charles and Auguste Beau - mont. The rite forms the prologue to a Masonic comedy in three acts entitled The Freemason which was printed in Paris in 1867. There is every evidence that the work is a modern pro - duction, but its value lies in its splendid summary of the early mystery rituals compiled from various Greek and Egyptian au - thors. There is a record in the British Museum that Plato received the Egyptian rites of Isis and Osiris in Egypt when he was"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 Introduction forty-seven years old.

THIRD PRIEST: He has made amongst them, in a single year, most extraordinary progress. (He goes to open a peep- hole in the wall, looks out and returns.) SECOND PRIEST: But this swan of the Academy, as his Master calls him, is above everything a man of imagination; will he have sufficient strength of soul to support the rude trials which commence from this moment?

He puts his lamp across the airhole, and passes through head first. Rising, he looks around.) Into what place have I descended so painfully? (He advances to the grating and opens it, after he has passed it closes with an extraordinary noise.) How can this door, closing of itself, produce so great a noise?

What is science?"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 Initiation of Plato PLATO: It is the comprehension of causes and their effects, when the spirit of God descends into the bosom of man. FIRST PRIEST: And wisdom? PLATO: The knowledge of good and evil, justice and injus - tice; it is the love of the one and the hatred of the other. FIRST PRIEST: In order to reach it, know thou thyself. (He goes out and a flame rises behind him.) Scene Fourth PLATO: I aspire to comprehend, O Sage! Why disappear thus? Know thou thyself! This profound sentence of the King Sesostris is graven upon the Temple of Delphos, I am charged not to forget it, the divine Socrates incessantly recalled it to us.

Thunder is heard, then great noise of chains rattling in the distance; some lights pass on the scene; sud - denly there is absolute silence.)

SECOND PRIEST (indicating the ruined palace) : If they do not practice justice, the sole providence of empires, what remains of the most powerful kings of the earth? A handful of ashes and the scorn of posterity. PLATO: The benevolent and modest man leaves at least a respectful remembrance, sympathetic regrets, a noble example. It is consoling, also, that man by his labors may prolong his existence through the centuries, and speak, so to say, from the foot of his tomb, to all generations that may come after him. SECOND PRIEST: It is beautiful, without doubt, to live honored in the memory of men, and it is the noble ambition of great hearts. But know that life and death succeed each other, as do night and day. Everything changes, transforms itself un - ceasingly; the ephemera in an hour; man in a century, more or less; the stars in millions of years. Even the innumerable suns, which roll over our heads, have had also, as we, their birthdays. Each instant which passes sees some extinguished and others setting out anew at incalculable distances!

(After some violent efforts he releases himself of the fevers.) Thus I liberate myself from foolish passions, and from fool- ish beliefs, based only on hypothesis! SECOND PRIEST: Thou has but in effect liberated thy body, if thy spirit still remains accessible to suggestions of intolerance and error. Know thou, that perseverance is the secret of perfection. Inspire thyself amongst these illustrious dead, read their inscriptions, or rather their sentiments, and pursue thy route. It is strewn with stones, and the way is yet long; but the knowledge of important truths will be the price of thy efforts.

Whoever thou art, O dead! I thank thee, and salute thee. (Passes to another coffin and reads.) “I often repented of having spoken, rarely of be- ing silent.” Yes, speech is silver, but silence is gold.

Deprived of a calendar, the laborer called those stars of the Bull which arose in affinity with the sun at the period of their labor; stars of the Virgin those which arose at the epoch of harvest, and so of the others. Then forgetting the reason why their fathers had thus denominated the stars, the people began to believe that the Virgin, the Bull, the Lion, actually existed in the heavens whence they favored their labors and the productions of the earth; they made of them gods!

Knowest thou the signification of the red cross traced upon the banner of Egypt? PLATO: It is the symbol of the renewal of the seasons, or of immortality.

PLATO: No, it is, on the contrary, the maintenance of the condemnation of an innocent man, were he to die, that would lessen their authority. THIRD PATRIARCH: Where doth justice and morality take their source? PLATO: In the very conscience of humanity."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30 Initiation of Plato THIRD PATRIARCH: How dost thou distinguish good and evil? PLATO: All that which wounds the dignity or restrains the rights of man is evil; all that which is favorable to them is good. THIRD PATRIARCH: Thy replies are sufficiently precise. Dost thou think that woman is inferior to man? PLATO: No, I believe that she is his equal and his best friend. THIRD PATRIARCH: And what sayest thou to corporeal punishment and the penalty of death? PLATO: I say that they are the signs of a still barbarous civi - lization. THIRD PATRIARCH: Then, what will be to thy mind the signs of a civilization superior to our epoch? PLATO: The absence of priests. (Explosion of murmurs amongst the audience.) A PRIEST (rising) : We are then useless? So the observance of thy pretended rule of good and evil suffices to render man happy? Plato, thou art ungrateful! SECOND PRIEST (rising) : Thou slanderest the first want of society! THIRD PATRIARCH: Calm yourselves, my brothers, it were better to praise the frankness of the Neophyte than throw stones at him. (To Plato) In what dost thou make true happi - ness to consist? PLATO: In the approbation of the conscience. THIRD PATRIARCH: Yes, it is in the depth of the heart that infallible justice dwells to console the victim, chastise the criminal, and rejoice the good name."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31 Third Tableau (The Ceryce presents to Plato a cup to empty, and the Etangi.) FIRST PATRIARCH: It is the beverage of the lotus; drink and forget all sentiments of hatred, envy, and intolerance; and put on this robe in sign of devotion to science and virtue. (Plato empties the cup, and assisted by the Ceryce puts on the Etangi. The audience goes out.) Thou goest to be initiated into the last mysteries. Scene Third Three Patriarchs, the Ceryce, Audience of Priests, Plato, an Aged Patriarch (The aged Patriarch rises from the floor, and is preceded and followed by a flame.) FIRST PATRIARCH: In the presence of this triangle of fire, swear to obey our sacred laws, to submit thy passions to the empire of reason, and to labor incessantly for the good of hu m a n it y. (The Ceryce dips a reed pen in ink and presents it to Plato be - fore whom the aged Patriarch holds open the golden book. Having signed the book, Plato receives from the aged Patriarch the decora- tion which he carries.) AGED PATRIARCH: This decoration is that of Minerva or Isis, it represents an owl; symbol of a child which is blind at birth, and only becomes a man by experience and the light of philosophy. May Minerva always inspire thee! (He retakes the golden book which he had laid down to decorate Plato and disappears in the floor, and a flame rises behind him. The Patriarchs descend from their seats, surround and congratulate Plato. The First Patriarch moves aside; the others place themselves in procession and advance. A gust of wind; the floor is raised.)"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32 FOURTH TABLEAU The floor of the theater, which alone is changed, represents the face of a temple. of which the steps are terminated by two li - ons; an obelisk to right and left; avenues of green trees; rays of light. Scene First The Patriarchs, the Ceryce, Plato, the Demiurgos, the King, Priests, Soldiers. (The soldiers are ranged before the temple, and the priests and patriarchs to right and left of the scene. In the midst and at the back of the plane is the Demiurgos and the King. The First Patri - arch and Plato occupy the front of the scene to the left. Music a little lively, then slow.) FIRST PATRIARCH (low to Plato) : Yes, dear Plato, these are our last, our grand mysteries. PLATO (low to the First Patriarch) : Yes, I foresee it! They cannot for a long time yet be revealed to the people! FIRST PATRIARCH (low to Plato) : Who knows? In two thousand years perhaps! But listen! The usual procession in honor of the Initiate is composed thus: First, the Chanter, bearing the symbol of music; next the Aurispice or observer of times; the Sacred Scribe marches after him bearing a book, an inkhorn, and a reed pen; he is followed by the Standard Bearer, who carries the cubit of justice; he who bears upon his breast a cruse, symbol of the thirst for science, is the Prophet. The others who follow the Loaf Bearer, precious gift of Isis, are the Aspirants for initiation; they follow the various classes of medicine, mathematics, architecture, painting, and so forth. But advance and lend thine ear to the Demiurgos. DEMIURGOS: Plato, ever remember that all men hold from nature equal and sacred rights.

Honor and serve well thy country, but in fighting for it forget not that all people are thy brothers! Exercise and develop thy faculties constantly; let temperance and moderation preserve thy prosperous health. In thy pleasures taste not those which may give pain to any one; and remember that mankind is only happy and great by justice. (He takes the glaive from the glaive-bearer and in plac - ing the blade upon the shoulder and head of Plato says:) In the presence of the King of Egypt, Initiate, just and beneficient, I the Demiurgos, humble representative of T. S. A. O. T. U., constitute and proclaim thee a Patriarch of our immortal insti - tution. Go, spread upon earth the sublime truths which thou comest to learn; but accord this signal favor only to those cho - sen souls, who have been slowly prepared as worthy of receiving them; build not upon sand; write not upon snow! THE KING: Plato, by thy long labors, by thy constancy under great trials, by thy ardent love of truth, thou deservest this decoration, which symbolizes these qualities, and I am happy in bestowing it upon thee. (He puts round the neck of Plato his decoration, the Alidee.) Now follow us. Let us show to a people, simple but enthusiastic admirers of the good and the beautiful, the triumph of perseverance and virtue. Although they are unable to appreciate the extended science of the Ini - tiates, yet they know that by their lights, their courage, and their labors, they aim at intellectual enfranchisement, and the general happiness of the human race; they love to feast the Ini - tiates, and to applaud them.
