Is there one, above all D others, that secretly he feels is the apple of his eye? More often than not, despite all protestations to the contrary, there certainly is. So it is with me. In having been asked to write an introduction to this new edition of The Tree of Life, I feel a warm inner glow which combines a number of quite separate emotions. This book has special meaning for me that none of my other writing ever had. Primarily, there is the basic fact that it was the first book that emerged from my burgeoning spirit. A Garden of Pomegranates, a prior publication, simply expanded itself from a set of Qabalistic notes I had kept for several years-and that is all it ever was. The Tree of Life has been said to be the most comprehensive introduction available to the numerous, complex, and sometimes obscure mystical writing of Aleister Crowley. Both these books were dedicated to him whom I served as a secretary for several years. Symbolically, both came to be gestures of independence from him. The Tree of Life also resulted in a correspondence all over the world that has eventuated in several deep and abiding friendships. For these I am most grateful. Though this book contains many minor typographical errors- principally due to haste and the carelessness of youth-it has been found useful as a guide to the vast, complicated and ~vonderful Golden Dawn system of initiation to which I am obligated; a debt which must here be acknowledged. The two volumes of The Golden Dawn (Llewellyn Publications, St. Paul, Minn. 1970) are alleged by some students to contain such a diversified mass of information that a clear guide is a pre-requisite to hew an intelligible pathway through its papers, rituals and instructions. This new edition should provide such a guide. In the writing of The Tree of Life I learned much. It consoli- dated many isolated fragments of disconnected knowledge and ex- perience. Correspondence indicated it has served others equally well.

A British psychiatrist was so kind as to admit to a sense of awe and, indeed, admiration that one in his mid-twenties could have shown as much spiritual insight and capacity for synthesis evidenced in this book. Should this con- clusion be valid, much credit has to be given Aleister Crowley to whom I owe very much. To his ultimate vindication from the idiocy of biographers and muck-raking journalists I have dedicated many years of my life. His material will never die, it will remain an inspira- tion to students of the distant future as it has to me. Credit must also be given to my higher and divine Genius, to use the lovely Golden Dawn language-for without this inner direction, no literature however profound, beautiful or ecstatic would mean very much. Because the guidance obtained later from The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn resulted from the publication of The Tree of Life, its writing was not influenced by the Order. Subse- quently, however, it did play a prominent part in my inner growth and the writing of later books. In retrospect, this testimony of my independence from Crowley resulted in a letter from the Chief of one section of the Golden Dawn condemning both me and the book in no uncertain terms. On the other hand, it resulted in an invitation to become a member from the Chief of another branch of the Order. I accepted the latter. Though later years brought about a separation from the Order, I now regret my youthful presumption and arrogance. Nevertheless, destiny must have intervened, resulting in a re-issuance of the secret Order teachings, the first exposure having been essayed just before World War I by Crowley in the Equinox. With due respect to Crowley's abundant genius, it has been said my presentation did more justice to the Order than did his. It is worth repeating a second time that this new edition of The Tree of Life will give the student a bird's eye view of the Western magical tradition. In this .connection, despite minor doctrinal and ritualistic deviations, Crowley stands in direct line of descent from the Adepts of the Golden Dawn; nothing that he has written can be understood without reference to its teachings.

Finally, a former caution is still essential. I have long realized modern psychological analysis should be wedded to methods of the Great Work-a task yet to be Ecilly accomplished. It is strongly recommended that the serious student undergo a course of some kind of psychotherapeutic treatment before proceeding too far with these practices. At the very least, he will have gained in self-awareness, and eliminated a few bodily and emotional tensions exacerbated by the magical art. So to this new edition of The Tree of Life, I can only say with humility, sincerity and conviction, go forth and spread the word. It depicts a good teaching, a noble philosophy, and an archaic though practical system of attainment, of reaching sun-drenched heights to which all mankind ultimately must aspire and rest.

Few are there to-day who would appear to possess even the vaguest idea as to what constituted the high objective of that system considered by the sages of antiquity the Royal Art and the Trans- cendental Magic. And because there have been even fewer in number prepared to defend to the last its philosophy and disseminate its true principles amoiigst those found worthy of receiving, the field of war strewn with the mangled reputations of its Magi was relinquished to the charlatans. These, alas, made good usc of their opportunity for wholesale despoliation. So much so, that the word Magic itself has now become synonymous with all that is odious, and is conceived to be an obnoxious thing. For several centuries in Europe was this unrighteous condition of things permitted. It continued for some while until about the middle of the last century, when Eliphas Levi, a writer with a certain facility of expression and a flair for synthesis and surface exposition, endeavoured to restore to Magic its age-old lofty reputa- tion. How his efforts would have fared had not they been succeeded and abetted by the advent of the philosophy of the Theosophical Movement in 1875, together with the open discussion of occult and mystical matters which thereafter ensued, is exceedingly hard to say. Even so, they have been none too successful. For despite nearly eighty long years of attention to and the unconcealed discussion of the esoteric philosophy and practice in various of its branches, there can be found in the Catalogue of the British Museum Reading Room, for instance, no single work on Magic which attempts to provide a lucid, unambiguous, and exact exegesis, unhampered by too great an employment of symbol and figure of speech.

As a consequence enquiries would frequently be addressed to him as to its nature. So numerous did they become as time went on, and so abysmal was the uninten- tional ignorance of the subject that all displayed, that it seems high time to make available for that public a synthetic and definitive exposition. Inasmuch as no other individual has attempted this task of paramount importance, upon the writer devolves this difficult work. He does not propose to limit himself by specious remarks concerning the incommunicability of occult secrets. Nor will he mention the impossibility of conveying the true nature of the mysteries of ancient time, as some recent authors have done. Though all this is true, nevertheless there is enough in Magic which is communicable. In spite of hundreds of pages to elucidate, against these writers also must be levelled the grim accusation of having done much to confirm public opinion in the already firm belief that Magic was ambiguous, obscure, and fatuous. A greater misconception than this could hardly be held. For Magic, let me insist, is lucid. It is definite and precise. There are no vague formulae or dubieties comprehended within the sphere of its exactitude ; all is clear-cut and devised for practical experiment. Its system is absolutely scientific, and each part thereof is capable of verification and demonstrable proof. The Tree of Life is pub- lished, somewhat hesitatingly it is true, with the sole object of filling in the existent gap. The writer desires to render intelligible and comprehensible to the ordinary intelligent layman, to the student of the Mysteries and those versed in the lore of other mystical systems and philosophies, the root principles from which the tremendous high-towering structure of Magic is built. With one exception, not known or suitable to the public at large unfor- tunately, this necessary task has never previously been accom- plished. The frequency of long quotations from the writings of magical authorities which the writer has inserted herein is quite simply explainable. It was due solely to the desire to demonstrate that the larger essentials of this exposition are not the outcome of any inventiveness of the writer, but are firmly rooted in the wisdom of antiquity. That there are crudities of expression, possible misinter- pretations of fact or theory, sins of omission and commission, the writer needs hardly to be informed.

Death-dealing and with octopus-like tentacles of destruction, this morass clutches him more and more firmly to its breast, albeit with great subtlety and with stealth. Civilization, curiously enough, modern civilization, is its name. The tentacles which are the unwitting instruments of its catastrophic blows reach out from the diseased structure, false and loathsome, of the decaying social system and the set of values wherein we are involved. And now, the entire fabric of the social world appears in process of disintegration. The structure of national organization would appear to be veering from economic ruin to that final crazy lurch which may see it disappear over the gaping preci- pice to complete destruction. Rooted firmly in the fullness of the individual life, the hitherto stout bulwarks of our life are threatened as never have they been before. More and more impossible does it seem with the setting of each sun for anyone to retain even the slightest portion of his divine heritage, individuality, and to exert that which makes him man. Despite being born in our age and time, those few individuals who are aware with a certainty in which there is no doubt of a destiny propelling them imperiously forward to the fulfilment of their ideal natures, constitute perhaps the sole exceptions. These, the minority, are the born Mystics, the Artists and Poets, those who see beyond the veil and bring back the light of beyond. Included within the mass, however, is yet another minority who, while not fully conscious of an all-compelling destiny, nor the nature of its deeper self, aspires to be different from the complacent masses. With an inner anxiety it is restless to obtain an abiding spiritual integrity.

The attitude, singularly unwise, adopted by the greater part of modern \" intelligent \" European humanity to- wards this aspiration constitutes a grave danger to the race. It has permitted itsel only too eagerly to forget that upon which it actually depends, and from which it is constantly nourished and sustained in both its inward and outward life. Avidly seizing upon the fluctuating evanescence of the hasty exterior existence, its negli- gence of affairs spiritual, as well as its impatience with the more far-seeing of its fellows, is a mark of extreme race-weariness and nostalgia. It is a well-worn saying but one none the less true and none the less worthy of repetition, inasmuch as it expresses peculiarly the situation now widely prevalent, that \" where there is no vision the people perish.\" Mankind as a whole, or more particularly the Western element, has lost in some incomprehensible way its spiritual vision. An heretical barrier has been erected separating itself from that current of life and vitality which even now, despite wilful impediment and obstacle, pulses and vibrates passionately in the blood, pervading the whole of universal form and structure. The anomalies presented to-day are due to this rank absurdity. Man- kind s slowly accomplishing its own suicide. A self-strangulation is being effected through a suppression of all individuality, in the spiritual sense, and all that made it human. It continues to with- hold the spiritual atmosphere from its lungs, so to speak. And having severed itself from the eternal and never-ceasing sources of light and life and inspiration, it has deliberately blinded itself to the fact-than which no other could compare in importance-that there is a dynamic principle both within and without from which it has accomplished a divorce. The result is inner lethargy, chaos, and the disintegration of all that formerly was held to be ideal and sacred. Laid down centuries ago, the doctrine tallght by the Buddha commends itself to me as providing a possible reason for this divorce, chaos and decay. To the majority of people existence is inevitably bound up with suffering and sorrow and pain. Now although Buddha did teach that life was fraught with pain and misery, I am inclined to believe, when remembering the psychology of Mysticism and of Mystics, whose peer he undoubtedly was, that this viewpoint was adopted by him only to spur men forward from chaos to the attain- ment of a superior mode of life.

What of the rain falling through the leaves of trees towering to the gates of heaven, and the dew in early morning creeping over the grass, tipping it with spear-points of silver ? Most readers will have heard of the experience of the great German Mystic, Jacob Boehme, who, after his divine beatific vision, walked into the green fields close to his village, beholding the whole of Nature ablaze ~ith so glorious a light that even the tender blades of grass were .esplendent with a divine loveliness and beauty that never had he ;een before. Great Mystic that the Buddha was-beyond perhaps my other within the knowledge of the average reader-and great lis insight into the working of the human mind, it is impossible to ~ccept on its face value his pronouncement that life and living are t curse.

Because he is ignorant of uhat he really is in himself, ignorant of his true way in life, man is, IS the Buddha taught, so beset with sorrow and so sorely afflicted with distress. According to the traditional philosophy of the Magicians, every man is a unique autonomous centre of individual consciousness, :nergy and will-a soul, in a word. Like a star shining and existing by its own inward light it pursues its way in the star-spangled heavens, solitary, uninterfered with, except in so far as its heavenly course is gravitationally modified by the presence, near or far, of other stars. Since in the vast stellar spaces seldom are there con- flicts between the celestial bodies, unless one happens to stray from its appointed course-a very rare occurrence-so in the realms of humankind there would be no chaos. little conflict and no mutual disturbance were each individual content to be grounded in the reality of his own high consciousness, aware of his ideal nature and"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"26 THE TREE OF LIFE his true purpose in life, and eager to pursue the road which he must follow. Because men have strayed from the dynamic sources inhering within themselves and the universe, and have forsaken their true spiritual wills, because they have divorced themselves from the celestial essences, betrayed by a mess of more sickly pottage than ever Jacob did sell to Esau, the world in this day presents a people with so hopeless an aspect, and a humanity impressed with so despondent a mien. Ignorance of the course of the celestial orbit, and the significance of that orbit inscribed in the skies for ever, is the root which is at the bottom of universal dis- satisfaction, unhappiness and race-nostalgia. And because of this the living soul cries for help to the dead, and the creature to a silent God. Of all this crying there comes usually-nothing. The lifting up of the hands in supplication brings no inkling of salvation. The frantic gnashing of teeth results but in mute despair and loss of vital energy. Redemption is only from within and is wrought out by the soul itself with suffering and through time, with much endeavour and strain of the spirit. How, then, may we return to this ecstatic identity with our deeper selves ? In what way may this necessary union be accom- plished between the individual soul and the Essences of universal reality ? Where is the road which leads eventually to the improve- ment and betterment of the individual and consequently to the solution of the perplexing problems in the world of men ? 9 The appearance of genius, regardless of the several aspects and fields of its manifestation, is marked by the occurrence of a curious phenomenon whose accompaniment is most always vision and ecstasy supreme. This experience to which I have reference is indubitably the hall-mark and essential stigmata of genuine accom- plishment. Not to mediocrity is this apocalyptic experience vouch- safed. To the commonplace person, burdened as he is with dogma and an out-worn tradition, there seldom comes that flash of spiritual light making descent in splendid tongues of flame like the Pente- costal Holy Ghost, radiant with joy and the highest wisdom, pregnant with spontaneous inspiration.

But little importance think need be attached to the oft-iterated definition concerning certain very high percentage of perspiration plus a very small mainder of inspiration. No matter how great the value of per- spiration, it cannot produce the magnificent effects of genius. In every field of endeavour in daily life, on every side do we see per- 1 formed a vast amount of excellent work, indispensable for what it is, and the shedding literally of quarts of perspiration without in fact the evocation of a fractional part of a creative idea or exaltation. These outward expressions in genius-care, patience, perspiration -are simply the manifestations of a superabundance of energy roceeding from a hidden centre of consciousness. They are but ie media by which the genius distinguishes itself, striving to make nown those ideas and thoughts which have been hurtled into the ~nsciousness and penetrated that border-line which successfully larks off and divides the profane from that which is divine.

In reality it is that goal whither evolution tends and which is envisaged by all the kingdoms of Nature. From the beginnings of time when intelligent man first appeared on the scene of evolution. there have existed technical methods of s~iritual attainment by means of which might be ascertained the true nature of man, and by which, moreover, genius of the highest order developed. The latter, I might add, was conceived to be but the by-product and terrestrial efflorescence of the discovery of the orbit of the starry Self, and at no time, by the authorities of this Great Work, was in itself considered to be a worthy object of aspiration. \" Know thyself\" was the supreme injunction giving impetus to their high endeavour. If the creativity of genius followed as a result of the discovery of the innermost self and the tapping of the sources of universal energy, if inspiration by the Muses ensued or a stimulus in the direction of some art or philosophy or lay occupation, so much the better. At the outset of training, however, these Mvstics-for so these authorities came to be known-were completely indifferent to any result other than a spiritual one. Self-knowledge and self-discovery-the word \" self \" being used in a lofty, noetic and transcendental sense-were the primary objectives. If the arts have their origin in the expression of the Soul that listens and sees where for the outer mind are silence and the dark, then evidently Mysticism is one and perhaps the greatest of the arts, the apotheosis of artistic expression and endeavour. Mysticism by some sweet ordinance of Nature has been always and at all times the most sacred of the arts. The Mvstic indeed bears within his bosom that tranquillity which oft-times is registered on the quiet face of the priest uplifted to the altar. He is a recognized inter- mediary and mouthpiece, the dual keys being laid in his hands. He is, both the ages and his fellows in the other arts admit, more directly admitted to the Sanctuary within and more immediately controlled by the psyche. It is for this reason that his successes are a success for all men at all times. But bitterly reprobated, as almost a new ruin of Lucifer, are his quite frequent failures.

It was the belief of those who were Mystics, and experience repeatedly gave confirmation thereto, that it was only by transcending the mind, or that into the mind emptied of all content and made calm like a lagoon of still blue water, could a glimpse of Eternity be mirrored. When the modifications of the thinking principle had been stilled or transcended, when the constant whirling which is a characteristic of the normal mind has been quelled, and a serene tranquillity cllbstituted, only then could there occur that vision of spirituality, iat lofty experience of the ages illuminating the whole being with armth of inspiration and profundity and a depth of imaginings ' the highest and all-embracing kind. The technique of Mysticism divides itself naturally into two ajor divisions. The one is Magic, with which this treatise will :a1 ; the other is Yoga. Now it is necessary to register a vehement -otest against those critics who, in opposition to Mysticism-by hich term some such process as Yoga or Contemplation is under- ood-posit Magic as a thing completely apart, unspiritual and of ie earth gross.

However often abused and misused as a word, Mysticism is throughout this book used because it is the correct term for that Mystical or ecstatic relationship of the Self to the Universe. It expresses the relation of the individual to a more comprehensive consciousness either within or without himself when, going beyond his own personal needs, he discovers his adjust- ment to larger, more harmonious ends. If this definition be in consonance with our views then it is obvious that Magic, also devised to accomplish that same necessary relationship, albeit by different methods, may not satisfactorily be placed against the other, and the advantages of one system panegyrically chanted as against the inadequacies of the other. For the finer aspects of Magic are a part, as the best of Yoga is also a part, of that all-inclusive system- Mysticism. On the subject of Yoga much has been written ; some of it rubbish, some little exceedingly worth while. But the whole secret of the Way of Royal Union is contained in the second aphorism of the Patanjali Yoga Sutras. Yoga seeks to arrive at Reality by undermining the foundations of the ordinary waking consciousness, so that upon the tranquil sea of mentality which follows upon the cessation of all thought, the inner eternal Sun of spiritual splendour could shine to shed an irradiation of light and life and immortality, to enhance the whole worth of man. All the practices and exercises in the Yoga systems are so many scientific steps, having as their one objective the complete abeyance of all thought at will. The mind must be thoroughly emptied at will of its content. Magic, on the other hand, is a mnemonic system of psychology in which the almost interminable ceremonial details, the circumambulations, conjurations, and suffumigations are deliberately intended for the exaltation of the imagination and soul, with the utter transcending of the normal plane of thought. In the one case, the spiritual axe is laid to the root of the tree, and the effort made consciously to under- mine the whole structure of consciousness in order to reveal the soul below. The Magical method, as opposed to this, endeavours to rise altogether beyond the plane where trees and roots and axes exist. The result in both cases-ecstasy and a marvellous outpouring of gladness, wildly rapturous and incomparably holy-is identical. It may be realized without difficulty then that the ideal means of finding the perfect pearl, the jewel of untold price, through which one may see the holy city of God, is a judicious combination of A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE both techniques. In any event, Magic proves more efficacious and puissant when combined with the control of the mind which it is the object of Yoga to achieve. And likewise the ecstasies of Yoga I acquire a certain rosy hue of romanticism and inspirational worth I when associated with the art of Magic. I Needless to say, then, when I speak here of Magic I have reference to the Divine Theurgy praised and reverenced by antiquity. It is of a quest spiritual and divine that I write ; a task of self-creation and reintegration, the bringing into human life of something eternal I and enduring. Magic is not that popularly conceived practice 1 which is the child of hallucination begotten by savage ignorance, 1 and which panders to the lusts of a depraved mankind. Because of the ignorant duplicity of charlatans and the reticence of its own scribes and authorities, Magic for centuries has been unduly confused with Witchcraft and Demonolatry. With the exception of but a few works which have either been too specialized in their appeal or I distinctly unsuitable for the general public, nothing has hitherto I been issued to act as a definitive statement of what Magic really is. ~ This work does not pretend to deal in any way with love-charms, I philtres and potions, nor with amulets preventing one's neighbour's cow from giving milk, robbing him of his wife, or to ascertain the whereabouts of gold and hidden treasure. Such vile and stupid practices rightly deserve that much-abused term \" Black Magic.\" With this aspect of things this study has naught to do ; although at the same time it is not to be understood that I deny the reality or efficacy of these methods. But if any man is anxious to discover the eternal font wherefrom the flame of Godhead springs, should there be one who is desirous of awakening in himself a more noble and lofty consciousness of the spirit, and within whose heart burns the aspiration to dedicate his life to the service of mankind, let such one turn eagerly to Magic. In its technique, peradventure may be ~und the means to the fulfilment of the loftiest dreams of the soul. From academic sources Magic is defined as \" the art of applying ltural causes to produce surprising effects.\" With this definition -and also with the view of a writer such as Havelock Ellis that it a name given to the whole stream of individual human action- e are in complete accord, inasmuch as every conceivable act in the hole span of life is a magical act.

What more marvellous and surprising tha,n the growth of a tiny babe to the full maturity of manhood ? Any and every exertion of the will-the uplifting of an arm, the utterance of a word, the silent germination of a thought-all these are by definition magical acts. The \" surprising \" effects, however, which Magic seeks to encompass occupy a somewhat different plane of action than do those just enumerated, although the latter, because they are so common, are none the less surprising and thaumaturgic. The result which the Magician above all else desires to accomplish is a spiritual reconstruction of his own conscious universe and incident- ally that of a11 mankind, the greatest of all conceivable changes. The technique of Magic is one by which the soul flies, straight as an arrow impelled from a taut bow, to serenity, to a profound and impenetrable repose. But it is only man hinlself who may tauten the string of the bow ; none else may accomplish this task for him. It is of course in this qualifying clause that lurks the flaw. \" Salvation \" must be self- induced and self-devised. Thc universal essences and cosmic centres are ever-present, but towards them man must take the first step and then, as Zoroaster has said in the Clzald~a+z Ovncles, \" the blessed immortals are swift to come.\" The cause and maker of fate and destiny is man himself. As he acts so must the course of his future existence be. Not only so, but in the hollow of his palm rests the fate of all mankind. Xot a large number of individuals will feel equal to awakening the dormant courage and the grim determination which masters the universe, that thus by a road direct and free of obstacle mankind may be led to a nobler ideal and a fuller and more harmonious mode of life. Were only a few men to exert themselves to discover what they really are, and ascertain beyond all cavil the scintillating refulgence of bright glory and wisdom burning in the innermost heart, and discover the bonds connecting them with the universe, then I think they will have accomplished not only their own individual purpose in life and fulfilled their own destiny, but, what is infinitely more important, they will have fulfilled the destiny of the universe considered as one vast living organism of consciousness.

If only a few people in each country, each race, each people throughout the world Ji%d themselves and enter into a hallowed communion with the very Source of Life, then they because of their illumination become the wick of humanity and cast a resplendent and glorious aureole of gold over the universe. In those individuals who constitute a minute, almost microscopic minority of the populace of this globe, willing and eager to devote themselves to a spiritual cause, lies the only hope for the ultimate redemption of mankind. Eliphas Levi, the celebrated French Magician, hazards a novel view which I think may have some bearing on this problem and throws an illuminating ray on this proposition. \" God creates eternally,\" he writes, \" the great Adam, the universal and perfect man, who contains in a single spirit all spirits and all souls. Intelligences therefore live two lives at once, one general which is common to them all, and the other special and individual.\" This protoplastic Adam is called in that Qabalistic work named The Book of Splendour the Heavenly Man, and it comprises in one being, as the erudite Magus observes, the souls of all men and creatures and dynamic forces which pulse through every portion of stellar space. I do not wish to enter metaphysics just at this moment, to discuss whether this primordial universal being is created by God or whether it has simply evolved from infinite space. All I desire to consider now is that the totality of all life in the universe, vast and widespread, is this heavenly being, the Oversoul as some other philos- ophers have known it, created for ever in the heavens. In this cosmic body we, individuals and beasts and Gods, are the minute cells and molecules, each having a separate function to perform in the social polity and welfare of that Soul. This philosophical theory admirably suggests that as in the man of earth there is an intelligence governing man's actions and thoughts, so there is likewise, figura- tively speaking, in the Celestial Man a soul which is its central intelligence and its most important faculty. \" All that which exists upon the Earth has its spiritual counterpart on high, and there exists nothing in this world which is not attached to something Above, and is not found in dependence upon it.\" So wrote the doctors of the Qabalah.

They accomplish the work of redemption and fulfil the destiny of Earth.

In consequence of this classification it is not difficult to anticipate that the whole Theurgic technique will be roundly condemned as \" psychism \" in, for example, Theosophical circles. As a matter of fact, as but little study need demonstrate, the condemnation is misplaced and totally unjustified. To correct this view for all time is Tlze Tree of Life issued to the reading public. I loathe this Theosophical glibness of expression. I must be permitted to register a hatred of their too-facile classification, their perpetual readiness to apply labels of scathing opprobrium to things not altogether understood. Were it not that I feel so deeply concerning Magic-holding that in it may be found the means to storm the kingdom of heaven by violence-this Theosophical abuse and intended censure would be deservedly ignored and relegated to that sphere of contempt to which it so rightly belongs. There has been altogether too much misunderstanding of what Magic is and what it sets out to do, and it is time to clear up once and for all this constant source of confusion by laying down the elementary principles of its art. In her renowned Stanzas of Dzyan, upon which the entire Secret Doctrine is arranged as commentary, Madame Blavatsky informs us that each man is a shadow or a spark of a divinity of superlative wisdom, power and spirituality. These sentient beings are called by one of the Theurgic authorities Gods or universal Essences. A present-day Theosophical authority, Dr. Gottfried de Purucker, writes : \" The finest part of the constitution of the human being is, in each case, a child of the spiritual part of one or another of the glorious suns scattered through frontierless space. Ye are gods in your inmost parts, atoms of some spiritual sun. . . .\" The definition 35"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"36 THE TREE OF LIFE accorded a God in The Secret Doctrine is of an hierarchical being which in remotest epochs of evolutionary endeavour, long, long ago, was once a human being such as we are now. By dint of effort and conscious progress it unified itself with that Spiritual Reality diffused throughout the ramifications and foundations of the universe. At the time of union, however, the essential individuality of experience was retained. But the personality transcended, the being resumed its natural r81e of ruler, as it were, or Regent of the universe, or some particular portion or aspect of the universe. Since, therefore by this definition, man is the spark of so lofty a consciousness, a child of the cosmic gods, there is no alternative to the tenor of his life than that to his spiritual progenitors he should aspire for union. It is to effect this union that Magic owes its origin and its raiso?z dJ&tre. Within these pages I hope to show that the technique of Magic is in closest accord with the traditions of the highest antiquity, and that it possesses the sanction, expressed or implicit, of the best authorities. Iamblichus, the divine Theurgist, has much to say in his various writings about Magic ; likewise Proclus and Porphyry, and even in modern authoritative Theosophical literature there are obscure references, though unexplained and never enlarged upon, to the Divine Magic. Several fine invocations from Gnostic records and the various recensions of the Book of the Dead will be presented towards the close of this book, and disquisitions based on Egyptian and Qabalistic magical conceptions will be found in other of these chapters. Any casual summary of Magic then in a single word \" psychism \" is utterly absurd, to say the least. I know Theosophists, however, and realize the necessity of anticipating their objections with a comprehensive counter. The Magician must be in control of the whole of his nature ; every constituent eIement in his being must be developed under Will to the topmost pitch of perfection. No one principle must be repressed ; each is an aspect of the supreme spirit and must fulfil its own purpose and nature. If the Theurgist engages, for instance, in astral travelling-to which part of the Great Work Theosophical objections will in the main be levelled-it is so for three principal reasons. First that in the so-called Astral Light he may perceive an exact reflection of himself in all his several parts and qualities and attributions, an examination of that reflection tending naturally to a species of self-knowledge. A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE Second, the definition of the Astral Light from the magical point of view is an exceedingly broad one, including all subtle planes above or within the physical, and it is the objective of the Magician con- stantly to rise to the more fiery and lucid realms of the spiritual world. The grosser elements of the sphere of Azoth, with its sensuous images and clouded opaque visions, must ever be transcended and left far behind. Eliphas Levi goes so far as to make for practical purposes but two major plane divisions in the universe : the physical world and the spiritual world. Third, before this particular portion of the invisible world can be transcended, it must be conquered and mastered in each of its aspects. All the denizens of that sphere must be made to submit to the Magician, to his magical symbols and to obey unequivocally the reality of Royal Will which these latter symbolize. On our plane and in our wake-a-day realm of ordinary experience, symbols are merely arbitrary representations of an inner intelligible significance. They are the visible signatures of a metaphysical or a spiritual grace, as it were. In the Astral Light, however, these symbols assume independent existence revealing their tangible reality, and hence they are of the utmost importance. Evocations are under- taken by the Magician not out of curiosity nor to satisfy a thirst for power, but with the sole object of bringing these hidden facets of his own consciousness within the scope of his will, and thus subjecting them to his domination. Psychism may perhaps be defined as having for its object the stimulation and preservation of the lower self at the expense or in ignorance of the Higher Self. This is an abomination deserving of the severest censure. In Magic no attempt is made to acquire powers for their own sake, or for any base or nefarious purpose. Any power acquired must instantly be subordinated to the Will, and kept in its own place and proper perspective. This question of powers is a most curious one I might add, obtaining major prominence in the public eye only since the advent of the cult of Spiritualism and the formation of Theosophical organisations. Why individuals-particu- larly some Theosophists-should lust after, or contemplate as they do, astral or other occult powers for their own sake is a pathological morbidity, and as such is a thing which surpasses my comprehension. At the commencement of his career, the Magician is obliged to com- prehend that his one aspiration is to his Higher Self, to his Holy Guardian Angel, and that any faculties which are obtained must"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE be harnessed to that aspiration. Any lesser work undertaken must be with a definite spiritual motive. An aspiration to anything other than the Holy Guardian Angel constitutes in reality, and with but few exceptions, an act of black magic which is, therefore, to the last degree abhorrent. It must be obvious, then, to all, that psychism, as the desire for abnormal psychic powers to serve as an end in them- selves, is quite foreign to the intent and purpose of this technique. Another objection likely to be raised is that Magic may lead to Mediumship. Now this also is an erroneous censure for a large number of reasons. It has been correctly observed that both the medium and the Magician cultivate trance. But there the accuracy of the observation ceases, for in the respective states of conscious- ness there is all the difference in the world. In popular parlance there is the hackneyed expression that genius and madness are allied. The real distinction is that in the one case the balance of gravity is above the normal centre of consciousness. In the latter it is below, and the waking consciousness has become invaded by the inchoate horde of uncontrolled subconscious impulses. The same idea applies with even greater force to the comparison of medium and Magician. For the medium cultivates a passive and negative trance which hurls her centre of consciousness below into what we may call the Nephesch. The Magician on the other hand is intensely active from both a mental and spiritual point of view, and though he too strives in noetic trance to hold the ratiocinative processes in abeyance, his method is to rise above them, to open himself to the telestic rays of the Higher Self rather than to descend haphazard into the relative slime of the Neplzesch. This constitutes the sole difference. The cultivation of the magical Will and the consequent exaltation of the soul, is the technique of Magic. The spiritualistic trance is nothing more nor less than an unnatural descent into inertia and the animal consciousness. All humanity and divinity is abdicated in the passive negative trance for the substitution of animal life and demoniac obsession. The abdication of the rational ego in the Magician takes place in favour of a noetic spiritual attainment, not the torpor of instinctive and vegetative life. Magic therefore has no association from any possible point of view with passive mediumship. Before proceeding to the exposition of the fundamental principles of Magic, it is necessary to make clear my position so far as concerns the sources of theoretical philosophy underlying my personal inter- pretation of its technique. It will be fairly obvious that I am deeply A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE obligated to Theosophy. Many of the magical practices have their basis in the Practical Qabalah of the Hebrew philosophers, and in the sacerdotal Theurgy of the Egyptians. Fragments have been culled from several sources, and to a great number of thinkers both before me and in my time am I greatly indebted, and these I gladly acknowledge. As regards Theosophy, I think it only honest to confess-despite derogatory remarks registered against the behaviour of individual Theosophists-that for Blavatsky I have nothing but the highest admiration and respect. Much of the philosophical superstructure revealed in The Secret Doctrine commands but mute acquiescence and cordial agreement. My own conception of the magical philosophy owes what little of it which is consistent and clear to the developments in comparative religion and philosophy with which Blavatsky has provided me. Yet my attitude is one of eclecticism, choosing here, rejecting there, and forming of the whole a coherent and consistent synthesis pleasing to the mind and satisfying to the soul. The entirety of Blavatsky's teaching is one which, in various of its rami- fications, I feel I cannot accept. There is much with which I am wholly in sympathy, which one would be proud and happy to assimilate into personal philosophy, and at the same time there is much which is displeasing and repugnant to the inner sense. To the works of Arthur Edward Waite, with particular reference to his summaries of Qabalistic teaching, I am also in no little degree indebted. There is a considerable quantity of fine literature written by this now aged contemporaly which is exceedingly graceful, informative and sublime, singing at times with incomparable eloquence. And it is this aspect of excellent scholarship and lyricism which I think should not be forgotten, marred though it sometimes may appear to be by the frequency of passages in his writing which elicit justifiable censure. They are of abysmal turgidity and pomp- osity, and exhibit an unnecessary tendency to destructive criticism. But I, so far as personal feeling is concerned, have a warm place in my inner heart for Mr. Waite, and owe him far more than mere words can tell, and as a supplement to present study would enthusi- astically recommend to every reader his Secret Doctrifie irz Israel and The Holy Kaballah.

I must confess however to being quite unimpressed in every way by his own record of his capabilities as a practical Magician, since for one thing his so-called Evocation of the shade of Apollonious of Tyana eventuated in a complete paucity of result. He is a difficult problem for most readers. In addition, he has burdened himself with a confusion of, or a silly attempt to reconcile, Magic with Roman Catholicism. Without, therefore, a firm grasp of the fundamental principles of the Qabalah and comparative philosophy the student will be bound to be hurled headlong into the several pits which he provides for the unwary. S. L. McGregor Mathers and W. Wynn Westcott have also provided me with much to serve as fundamental in this Magical philosophy, particularly the former, and much useful material may be gathered from the works of them both. The world must ever be grateful to Mathers for his translation of The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage ; and The Introduction to the Study of the Kaballah by Westcott is perhaps one of the most sympathetic of all elementary treatises on that subject. To accept, however, the entire views of these writers is to receive acute mental indigestion. In each one there are several elements of truth-at least truth for the individual student-and lurking at the bottom there is a slight residuum of exaggeration, misunderstanding or error. It will be noted, too, that I have quoted frequently from Aleister Crowley, and it is imperative clearly to define my attitude towards this man of genius. Ignoring the opprobrium of black magic hurled by many individuals who are completely unaware of what he taught, there is much which is important in Crowley, a great deal of philosophy and original thought on both the Qabalah and Magic, beautifully expressed in prose and verse, and profound in conception. It is a pity, as I see it, that the public should be robbed of that super- lative freshness and originality which are his, and deprived of those aspects of his teaching that are fine, ennobling and enduring, simply because of a certain proportion of his literary output which is cer- tainly banal, petty, unimportant, and no doubt very reprehensible. The personalities and private lives of these individuals concern me not at all, and I do not feel inclined to discuss them. Nearly all of them have at some time or other suffered the stings and arrows A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 41 of misjudgment from a leering crowd. With that crowd and with the nature of the invectives hurled I also have nothing to do, for Magic is not for them in any way. On each stuclent, therefore, is the task incumbent to ascertain for himself what must be considered true and reliable, and set UD on his own score an incontrovertible standard of reference. And this standard must be spiritual experience. For this reason has the Qabalistic Tree of Life been adopted as the framework of practical Magic, since it is, in the first place, open to synthetic and construc- tive classification, and because it provides what may suitably be called a magical alphabet. It must be noted that the word \" alpha- bet\" is used, and-it is so used in preference to language an; the developments therefrom. The Qr~balah does not attempt to provide a complete magical language or an entire philosophy. Only by spiritual experience may the latter be acquired.

Indeed there can hardly be a real under- standing of the rationale of Magic, and certainly no realization of the complexities taking place within and without the constitution of the Magician, if the corner stone of philosophy is not firmly laid in his mind. If there is danger in the pursuit of Magic, that danger only arises where the Operator has no precise knowledge of what it is that he is doing. It is upon an intelligent understanding of the meaning of the occuli symbols and the realities that they are prim- arily intended to convey, that the efficacy of the rites largely depends. The symbols and the appurtenances of Magic in the profane hands of one not acquainted with the foundations of the art, would most assuredly fail to produce the proper thaumaturgic results. The mere intellectual familiarity with these arcane principles, however, is of little avail if there is no spiritual experience. On the other hand, magical investigation of the universe, and its consequent spiritual realization in consciousness, assumes a greater dignity and a richer implication and profundity when well buttressed by a theoretical understanding. In his recent work The Mysteries of Egypt, Lewis Spence affirmed that the philosophical system of Magic gathered up \" and made manifest all the wisdom and arcane knowledge of the ancient world, which was thus crystallized and systematized in such a manner that, had it been preserved in an unadulterated form, would most assuredly have saved later ages from many religious catastrophes and much false mysticism. But through the supineness and neglect of its conservators and perhaps through the cynical influences which impinged on them from abroad, its early divine beauty was gradually lost until at last only the skeletal forms of its ritual and ceremony remained.\" A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 43 It was in the orthodox exoteric religions that some of the several scattered fragments of the magical skeleton were retained, uneffi- cacious in the main and incomprehensible to most by reason of unscrupulous tampering. But the essence of Magic, its \" early divine beauty,\" has been preserved by unselfish hands and cherished in lofty minds, and if much care be exercised, can be gleaned even in published books. In the Gnostic works, included within the Neo- platonic writings, in the wilful obscurities of the Alchemists, among the literatures emanating from the Rosicrucians-in all of these we may find luminous vestiges of the philosophy and practice of that Magic of Light which, pieced carefully together upon the synthetic foundation provided by the Tree of Life, form a sublime and workable system bestowing the radiance of understanding on whomsoever will see. The principal ingredients of the magical system are the source of reference which is the Tree of Life of the Qabalists, and the hieratic religion of the sacerdotal caste of Egypt. There is, I might mention-leaving the reader to interpret as he will-the legend that the Qabalah was received by Moses as a sacred trust on Sinai, and that he handed it down to Joshua, who delivered it to the Judges, and they to the Sanhedrin, until finally it was seized upon and elaborated by the Tanaim and the later Qabalistic Rabbis. Other people firmly maintain that if ever such a person as Moses existed historically, and if the Qabalah and its corollaries emanated from him, then he obtained it from the Egyptian priests with whom he indubit- ably studied in the Nile Temples. Few other countries in the world, except India perhaps, can boast of so eloquent a chronicle of mystic and magical tradition as Egypt, which rightly has been styled the Mother of Magic. Whether or not the Qabalah is actually derived from the Egyptians or any other people is a moot point, and despite legend and fanciful speculation there is no authenticated historical evidence of any substance in this direction. Yet the practical Theurgy of the Egyptians harmonizes remarkably well with the philosophical theories of the Qabalah, and the experience of a multitude of Magicians tends to the belief that there could hardly be a more suitable or satisfactory combination. Hence a presentation of the underlying principles of the universe as conceived by the Magicians, and a study of which must form the basis of all practical work, will heie be given. This conception of the Universe will be briefly stated in the philo- sophical terms of the Qabalah, and woven around the central struc-"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE ture of the Tree of Life. \" On penetrating into the sanctuary of the Kaballah, one is seized with admiration at the sight of a doctrine so sim~le and at the same time so absolute. The necessarv union of ideas and signs, the consecration of the most fundamental realities by primitive characters, the trinity of words, letters and numbers; a philosophy simple as the alphabet, profound and infinite as the Logos ; theorems more luminous and complete than those of Pythagoras; a theology which may be epitomized by counting on the fingers ; an infinity which can be held in the hollow of an infant's hand : ten numerals and twentv-two letters, a triangle, a square, and a circle-such are the elements of the Kabal- lah, such are the primary principles of the written word, shadow of that Spoken Logos which created the world ! \" So thought Levi, and in truth one must wholeheartedly agree with him. For the admiration-compelling foundation of the Qabalah is a simple mathematical structure of symbols and numbers and names, utiliz- ing ten numbers and the letters of the Alphabet of the Angels, as the Hebrew Alphabet has been named. Mathematics has for ever been considered a divine science by the votaries of the esoteric philosophy, particularly among the Pythagoreans, adumbrating as it does by means of Number the creative processes both of the universe and the development of the human being. It was the view of several Magicians that by the ideas expressed in number was Nature con- ceived in the bosom of infinite space. From these ideas or universals issued the primordial elements, the immense cycles of time, the cosmic bodies, and all the host of heavenly changes. Since Numbers were the means or the symbols by which the meaning of the abstract universal Ideas could be grasped, in the course of time they came to be substituted for the ideas themselves. The number-philosophers were taught at the beginning of their studies to think of growth and development in terms of Number, to consider cosmic realities in their progressive states as the sequence of numerical advance. To these various states numbers became identified. I-Ience in the magical philosophy to refer to Zero, for instance, is to imply primarily the unmanifest Essence of the Uni- verse before yet the worlds had come to birth, the boundlessness and immutability of infinite space in which were neither stars nor suns, planets nor men. The Circle, a Zero (0) in shape, was thus considered to be a fitting representation of that primordial Reality which had given existence to all living things and beings in the vast A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE expanses of space. The Point, metaphysical and spiritual, which appears in strict accordance with cyclic law, was represented by a dash or a line extending from top to bottom of the circle, an upright figure One. The number itself then came to indicate the process of the germination of the worlds. Each number by virtue of the evolutionary process to which it originally applied, accordingly stood for the process itself. We have in consequence the rationale of the geometrical figures and sigilla: and symbols employed in magical ceremonies. As the philosophy of the Qabalah is unfolded, the reader will see what are the fundamental implications at the root of the signs and symbols which Theurgy uses. And it will be clearly perceived that no longer are they arbitrary signs of dubious connotation, but stern realities invested with an august truth. I must beg of the student, however, to bear patiently with me for a while in this and subsequent chapters, since I am dealing with a highly complex and difficult subject. No matter how fine a simplifi- cation is provided for general study, always must it call for close attention and much application. First of all, the philosophy of the Qabalah is a philosophy of evolution. The universe, with all its planets and worlds and independent beings, was conceived to be the emanation from a primeval substance-principle which some have called God, the Absolute, the Infinite, the All, and so forth. In the Qabalah, this principle which is the One Reality is named Ain Soph, the Infinite. The Sepher IzaZohar, the most important perhaps of all Qabalistic texts, conceives it to be unchangeable, unknowable to the mind, illimitable, unmanifest and absolute. Beyond all intellectual com- prehension in Itself, inasmuch as it could never be grasped by a mentality which is but a segment of its all-inclusiveness, It is stated to be Ain-h'othing. Since it does surpass all finite understanding, immutable and boundless as its exDanses are to the human mind whose most profound speculation could not approach to the faintest adumbration of what It is in Itself, it must ever remain a mysterious emptiness-No-thing. In this connection, the graphic conception of the early ~~~~tians is very forceful as well as picturesque. The Sky, or Space anterior to all manifestation, was conceived as the naked body of the goddess Xuit, the queen of infinite space, and , from her breasts the milk of the Stars, the primordial waters of substance, were portrayed as issuing forth. All that can be said with truth of this Absolute and Supreme"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE Reality is that IT IS. This must suffice. Omnipresent, eternal and self-existent-these are ideas which transcend even the loftiest flights of the trained imagination, abstractions beyond the grasp of mortal minds. One of the symbols of this potentiality of the Ain during a period of quiescence is a Circle, signifying that all having been withdrawn into homogeneity, motion returns perpetually into itself, as in the glyph the snake's tail returns into and is swallowed by the head. The circle is only broken so to speak by the law of periodicity. This law, affecting all, and inhering in the very nature of things, governs the constant flux and reflux, appearance and disappearance of the worlds. The potentiality of the Ain Soph is only mirrored forth with the outgoing from itself of the breath of creativity, with the commencement of a cycle when the One Life is polarized into spirit and matter. The breaking of the circle of un- ceasing motion is accomplished by a contraction of its Infinite Light, by a positing of a minute point of scintillating refulgence within the confines of space. How this concentrktion of Light into a cosmic centre was effected, what its obscure origin, we are unable to tell. There are confused explanations concerning the Will of Ain Soplz or the law of Cycles, but they do not really tend to intelligent satis- faction. In the one case it is completely impossible to conceive of so infinite and so abstract a spiritual condition as A~N Soph possessing a Will which can be put into operation, any more than that it possesses a mind or a body. The philosophic tradition is that Ai.n Soph is not Spirit or Will but the underlying cause of both ; not force or matter but that which underlies them, their ultimate Cause. In the second case, this postulate of the cyclic law to account for the appearance of the Centre of Light bespeaks of something independent of or imposing necessity upon Ain So;hJz. If the Cyclic Law is identified with the Absolute, the postulate becomes identical with the Will to manifest. In any event, since we are agreed in Theurgy that reason cannot be the final arbiter so far as concerns this and similar metaphysical questions, the philosophical tradition must simply be accepted in its bald statement, without endeavouring to provide rational explanations for a cosmic centre of radiance appearing in Space. This cosmic n~etaphysical centre is called Keser, the Crown, and is the first manifestation from the Unknown, a concentration of its Infinite Light. It, too, in a certain sense is unknown, the Zohar naming it the Concealed One. Blavatsky regards it as the first A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE Logos, unmanifested, for from it both spirit and the root of cosmic matter will yet be born. Its number is One, for the point in the circle elongated and drawn as an upright dash is that number. As the Crown surmounting the emanation system, as the apex of the Tree of Life which has its roots in the heavens, descending in growth towards the earth, Keser is the deepest sense of selfhood constituting the substratum of human consciousness and the ultimate root of substance. This central sensitive spiritual point, this metaphysical centre or monad of consciousness, fulfils both of these requirements, existing as the real individuality, and the ultimate division of matter. From the Monad issues duality, two distinct principles of activity permanent throughout an entire period of manifestation, co-existent and co-eternal. These are Consciousness and the metaphysical substantive basis on which consciousness ever acts, cosmic root Substance. The one is named Chokmah-Wisdom ; and to the other is attributed the title of Binah -Understanding. To render abstract things somewhat more com- prehensible to the minds they were endeavouring to instruct in this metaphysic, one of the characteristics of the Qabalistic philosophers was to explain, so far as is possible, their complex and difficult theorums in terms of human conduct and human activity and human emotion. So given to Chokmnh we find given the title of the Father, and to Birzah the Mother. All the Sephiros, as these emanations are called, below that named the Crown are given mascu- line and feminine attributions, and the activity between male and female Sephiros in reconciliation is a \" child,\" so to speak ; a neutral Sephirah acting in equilibrium. Thus the Tree of Life, comprising these ten emanations, develops from the highest abstraction to the most concrete material in several triads of potencies and spiritual forces. Male, female and child ; positive, negative and their resultant commingling in a third reconciling factor. These two principles or Sephiros, in being entitled the Father and the Mother, are also attributed to letters of the so-called Tetra- grammaton, whose four letters are YHVH. In connection with this doctrine of the Tetragrammaton, I must remind the reader that the attributions of this name and the modes of exegetical employment are exceedingly important and in so far as his under- standing of them is clear and precise so will be his insight into practical formulae of Magic later to be considered. The Father is given the letter \" Y \" of this name, and the first \" H \" is attributed"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"48 THE TREE OF LIFE to the Mother. From the union of the Y and the H flow the rest of all created things. In other words, from consciousness and its vehicle are all things formed, and every conceivable being, god or human, divine or animal, has its basis in the Y and the H of the divine name. In passing, it should be mentioned that the attitude adopted by what is known as Christian Science in denying the existence of matter obtains no confirmation in the philosophy of the Theurgists. It is true that the latter claim that the physical world is an illusion ; that is, in the sense that its outward forms are constantly changing, that it is in a state of perpetual flux. From this point of view, when looked at from \"above,\" the universe is believed to be an illusion. But its existence is grounded in a reality, the root-substance of Binah as distinct and separate from the consciousness aspect of Choknzah. In this one respect alone, ignoring several other openings for argu- ment, Magic has no interest in or sympathy with Christian Science. Both spirit and matter are real, real that is to say during a period of manifestation. In themselves they are but passing modes of the activity, as it were, of Ain Soph. Expanding throughout the entirety of Space, using Binah as an immediate vehicle, the energies of Chokmah give rise to the remain- ing seven emanations which result in the appearance of the tangible physical world. In Chokmah, the ideal or imaginative world-plan is formulated by the Logos who is in Keser, ideas upon which will be based the world-to-be. In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the god Tahuti or Thoth, the deity attributed to Chok+tzaJz inasmuch as the essential characteristics of both are identical, is there con- ceived to have been the \" tongue \" of the creator Ptah, and he at all times voiced the Will of the great God, speaking the words which commanded every being and thing in heaven to come into existence. Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, the distinguished Egyptologist, remarks in the informative British Museurn brochure dealing with the Book of the Dead, that \" Thoth framed the laws by which heaven, earth and all the heavenly bodies are maintained ; he ordered the courses of the sun, moon, and stars.\" This is all in harmonious accord with the nature of Choknzah, the Ideation or Imagination of the Cosmos, in which all things were first conceived and then executed and made manifest in substance. The Mother of every form, this is Bi+zah, the third Sephirah. According to the great sixteenth century Qabalist, Rabbi Moses A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE )rdovero, this number is the root of things. Cosmic root substance I I ~d primordial energy are the terms used by Blavatsky for this I particular manifestation, called in the Qabalah the Great Sea. The shape of the letters of the Hebrew word for Sea is a glyph eloquently indicative of the rise and swell of waves in the bosorn of the waters. The ancients very wisely symbolized by sea the I untouched virgin substance spread through space ; for water is plastic, ever changing in form, and assuming the shape of whatever containing vessel it is poured into. Sea is a most adequate symbol I 1 of this plastic substance from which all forms are to be made, as I well as representing a ceaseless yet passive energy. The colour of I I I Bitzalz is said to be black, since black absorbs all other colours just as all material forms after numberless transformations and mutations I return to and are absorbed back into the root substance. These three emanations are unique in a special way. The Crown with its two derivatives, the Father and Mother, are conceived to ! be Supernal Sephiros, bearing no relation with the emanations proceeding from them. On the chart of the Tree of Life the Supernals are seen to exist beyond the Abyss, that great gulf fixed between the Ideal and the Actual, separating them from those urhich are the Inferiors, the Above from that which is Below. Just as waves rise and sink below the normal level of the waters without having any lasting effect on the waters themselves, so is considered the relation of the actual universe to the Supernal Sephiros, for the latter lie on a plane altogether removed from anything that we can intel- lectually comprehend. It is only with the appearance of the fourth emanation that we have anything which is really cognizable by the human mind. For this reason there is a second method of numbering, additional to that already given. The Supernals are thought to be utterly inde- pendent of the lower Sephiros, and while the latter are given birth from and within their own divine essence, the being of Supernals is by no means affected. As light shines into the darkness and illmni- nates it without suffering a diminution of its own esistence, so the workings of the Supernals overflow from their central being ~vitliout thereby diminishing in any degree the reality of their source. Hence They exist alone beyond the Abyss, although throughout space is their essence diffused, and their numbering is complete in Three. Begin ning with the Inferiors below the Abyss, the plane of conditioned finite existence, the numeration begins once again with the number"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"50 THE TREE OF LIFE One. Thus each Sephirah, in this sense, has two numbers, indicating a distinct dual development of the life-current. Chesed is both number Four and One, inasmuch as it is the first Sephirah on the plane of causality below the Abyss. Jupiter, as the father of Gods, is sometimes assigned to Keser in the magical alphabet. But he also pertains to Chesed in another manner, since Chesed on a lower plane is the reflection of the Crown. The straightforward numbering is retained to avoid the confusion of two different series of numbers, and continues from one to ten without a break. It is only mentioned because this fact alone is able to explain the isolated fragments belonging to the Pythagorean number system which, when applied to the Tree of Liie without remembering the dual numeration, may lead to untold confusion. From the first triad, then, a second triad of emanations is reflected or projected below the Abyss. They, likewise, are composed of a male and female potency with a third Sephirah produced in direct reconciliation to harmonize and balance their powers. The fourth is named both Chesed meaning Grace, and Gedulah meaning Great- ness, and to it the ancient philosophers allocated the astrological quality called Jupiter. Four is a number signifying system and order, these latter being the qualities attributed by astrological tradition to the planet Jupiter. According to some authorities, this is the first number to show the nature of solidity, and since we have seen above that Chesed is the first Sephirah below the Abyss, and is the first of the \" Actual \" Sephiros, these remarks obtain justification. The male Sephirah Chesed is symbolical of the potentialities of objecti- vized Nature, and by way of confirmation of the astrological attribution of Jupiter, including also the mythological figure of the tutelary deity by that name, the Pythagoreans called Four, \" The greatest miracle, a God after another manner than the triad.\" The fifth is Gevurah-Might, and although a feminine emanation in quality, its nature would appear to be highly masculine. Some of the ancients have said that five is a symbol of the creative power, and in this concept of creativity and power we have the character of Gevurah. It is a formative force, as its name Might and the planetary attribution of Mars would lead one to imply, by which the plan formulated in the Cosmic Imagination and projected as an image into the root substance below the Abyss in Chesed, is whirled into activity and manifestation. Five is composed of three and two, the former representing the passive energy of the Mother and A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE the latter the wisdom of the Father. It exprzsses not so much a state of things as an act, a further passage and a transition of ideality into actuality. Six is the Sephirah which is evolved to give harmony and equilib- rium to the former forces, and is named Tiphayas, a Hebrew word meaning Beauty and Harmony. The number is a symbol of all that is well balanced, harmonious and of pleasing proportion, and inasmuch as it is the double of three, reflects again the variegated ideas represented by that number. Since, therefore, three represents the real motivating powers of evolution, the Macroprosopus or the Logos, likewise in Tipharas we find a due and equable reflection in a lesser Logos, the Microprosopus. To this Sephirah the Qabalists attributed the Sun, the lord and centre of the solar system. By consulting the chart, the reader may perceive that Tipharas occupies a conspicuous position in the centre of the whole structure of the Tree of Life. The Pythagorean number philosophers said that six vas the symbol of the soul, and later we shall discover that in the luman being Ti$haras, the harmonious emanation of the Sun, is the iephirah of the soul of Man, the centre of the microcosmic system, and the luminous intermediary between the brooding Spirit above aud the body with the instincts below. The Zoharic doctors of the divine philosophy allocated the third letter \" V\" of the divine name to Tiphayas, and since the latter is the child of the Celestial Father and Mother it is called the Son. The Seal of Solomon, the interlaced triangles, a true symbol of equilibrium, is the appropriate token. The processes of reflection continue still further, and the second triad composed of the numbers four, five and six-though they themselves were projected by the Supernal Sephiros-in turn give rise to a third triad, by reproducing themselves on a yet lower plane. The first of these Sephiros is male-Netsach, meaning Triumph or Victory. Seven is conceived to be a complete number, representing a consummation of things, a completion of a cycle, and its return into itself. So in the Seventh Sephirah, beginning a new triad and in closing the second series of Sephiros, is summed up anew all the former potencies. Its nature is one of love and the force of attrac- tion ; the power of cohesion in the universe, binding one thing to another thing, and acting as the instinctual intelligence among living creatures. The planet Venus, the emblem of love and emotion, is the planet attributed by the magical philosophers to this"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"52 THE TREE OF LIFE Sephirah ; likewise the colour green, which, traditionally, belongs to Aphrodite, as the forces pertaining to that Sephirah are peculiarly connected with growth, harvest and agriculture. In opposition to Netsach as the second Sephirah of the third triad is Hod, the Splendour or Glory, which is a feminine quality repeating the characteristics of Chokmah although on a plane less exalted and sublime. It represents essentially a mercurial quality of things--ever flowing, shifting, and in constant flux, and it has been termed, I believe, \" change in stabiIity.\" With it, possessing a nature very similar, is the ninth Sepirah Yesod, the Foundation, which is \" stability in change.\" Just as the tremendous speed of the electronic particles ensures the stability of the atom, so the fleeting forms and the motion of Yesod constitute the permanence and surety of the physical world. It is the ninth Sephirah and hence the ninth digit, comprehending in itself all preceding numbers. Commonly termed the Astral Plane or the Soul of the World, Yesod is that foundation of subtle electro-magnetic substance in which all the higher forces are focussed, and constitute the basis or final model upon which the physical world is built. Yesod is lunar in nature, the Moon being the luminary attributed, inasmuch as a curious relation- ship exists between the earth's dead satellite and the Astral Light. It completes the three triads, pendant to which is Malkus, the tenth and final Sephirah, representing in concrete form, in a com- plete crystallization visible and tangible to the senses, all the qualities of the preceding planes. The word itself means the Kingdom, the kingdom of the physical world, and the scene of the activities and incarnations of the souls exiled from above, the dwelling-place of the Holy Ghost. In the Zohar Malkus is given the letter \" H \" of the divine name and is called the Daughter, being the mundane reflection of the first \" H,\" which is the Mother. This tenth Sephirah is called elsewhere the Bride, the Daughter, and the Virgin of the World. Admittedly this outline gives only a brief and a very hasty glance at the numerical system of evolution and cosmic development which commanded so much of Levi's respect and which elicited from him so bountiful and eloquent an admiration. In this elementary sketch it will clearly be perceived that numbers relate to creative or evolutionary processes, and that fundamentally understood the nature of Number is rhythm.

There is another viewpoint of the Tree of Life upon which I should like to touch. It concerns what are called the Four Worlds. I These worlds are metaphysical regions both of consciousness and matter, for Theurgy holds that each state of consciousness has its own vehicle, an appropriate grade of substance. These worlds may be viewed from two distinct points of analysis, the first of which places a Tree in each one of the four worlds, thus yielding us forty Sephiros in all. The four worlds are named the Archetypal World, where the primordial archetypes or emanations are developed in the form of a Tree of Life. This Archetypal Tree of Life may be imagined also to represent a human form, which, in the Book of Sfilendour, is named Adam Kadmon, the Heavenly Man, containing within itself all souls, spirits and intelligences in every part of the cosmos. It is the Universal Soul, the divine parent and progenitor of all others. This soul it is, this Divine Man, concerning which Levi speaks and to which reference was previously made ; that Soul in the great life of which every individual being and separate consciousness participates. Too numerous are the developments arising from this single postulate, and too numerous are the sug- gestive ideas which it raises, to enter into at this place. It was my intention in the first place to present only a brief outline of the magical philosophy, leavinz the reader to fill out for himself the many gaps which have been left open. The totality of the Sephiros in the Olam Atsilus, the Archetypal World, occupies the highest plane of spiritual consciousness, the first appearance of consciousness from the Ain Soph. As the processes of evolution proceed, Adam Kadmon gradually projects itself further into matter, somewhat more dense, its unity being split up apparently, being mirrored in many facets, forming the Creative World, Olam Briah.

Here, too, a omplete Tree of Life is developed through reflection. From the ieative World, the Tree is projected on to a third plane, the ,?ormative World, Olam Yetsirah, where the imaginative ideas of the Logos, the spiritual monadic sparks already clothed in the subtle mental substance of the Creative World, are formed into definite coherent entities, the astral models which give rise to, or erve as the stable foundations of the physical world. The Physical Norld, Olam Assiah, is the fourth and last plane, and as the crystal- ized projection of the Formative World is the summarization and ,oncrete representation of all the higher worlds. In this conception we see the justification of the Hermetic axiom, ' As above, so below.\" For that which exists below has its ideal rrchetypal counterpart in the higher worlds. In variegated forms, the drchetypal ideas find their particular representation below ; stones, jewels, perfumes and geometrical forms all being peculiarly indica- tive in the mundane sphere of a celestial idea. This metaphysical formula also provides Levi with adequate reason for speaking of ' the single dogma of magic-that the visible is for us the pro- ~ortional measure of the invisible.\" The French Magus also remarks n another place that \" the visible is the manifestation of the risible, or in other terms, the perfect Logos is, in things which are preciable and visible, in exact proportion with those which are lppreciable to our senses and invisible to our eyes. . . . The -:m bears proportion to the idea . . . and we know that the nnate virtue of things has created words, and that there exists an :xact proportion between ideas and words, which are the first forms ind articulate realizations of ideas.\" It is this philosophical state- :nt of the relation between ideas and things which gives the ~damental rationale of much that holds true in Xagic. To this : shall have to revert at a later place, there being in the mean- lile a few further ideas demanding elaboration. The formula of Tetragrammaton is also applied to the Four orlds, and tlie primordial four elements. To the Archetypal orld the letter \" Y \" is given. Hence the Archetypal World is e Father, the all-begetter, the all-devourer of the worlds. The Y \" also represents, in this instance, the element of Fire, showing rth the fierce, active, spiritual nature of the Father. The \" H \""},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE primal of the Tetragrammaton is allocated to the Creative World to which, being receptive and passive, the element of Water pertains. This plane represents the Mother who, before the Son can be given birth, awaits the creative energy and the influx of divine life from the Father. The Formative World is assigned to the letter \" V,\" the Son, and the latter, like the Father, is active, male and ener- getic ; hence the element Air is the attribution. Completing the divine name is a second \" H,\" this letter being similar to the Mother, passive and inert, receiving whatever influences are poured into her. \" H \" is called in the Book of Splendour, the King's Palace, and the Daughter, representing the Physical World, which is the synthesis of all the worlds. The second method is slightly different from the one outlined above. In this instance a single Tree is employed, and the four planes placed on it thuswise. Keser, the Crown, occupying by itself the one plane, is the Archetypal World, the realm of the Logos. The second and third Sephiros, the Supernal Father and Mother constitute the Creative World, receiving and executing the divine imagination. The third plane, or the Formative World, the astral plane proper--concerning which more will be said in the following chapter-is comprised of the next six Sephiros, in which world all is prepared for visible manifestation. Malkus, the King- dom, is the Physical World. All the attributions following the first description of the Four Worlds hold true of this second method with the exception that I have just noted, that they are arranged on one Tree. Before closing this chapter, but one more series of conceptions must be mentioned. From the Theurgical point of view, the whole universe is consciousness, life and intelligence, embodied in visible and invisible form. Throughout the cosmos there thrills and vibrates one intelligence, one spiritual consciousness adumbrated in myriads of sparks or monads, permeating every form, and from which nothing in that cosmos is in any wise exempt. Just as there are various grades of mineral, animal and vegetable life and innumerable degrees of intelligence among men, so according to the magical traditions, this same hierarchical scale of intelligence exists beyond and above man. Not only does it hold true of our own universe, but elsewhere in the infinitudes of space are other hierarchies of lofty spiritual beings and divine intelligences. From the unknown incom- prehensible Darkness which is Air, Soph there is but one indivisible A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 57 consciousness, alike in the lowliest dog-faced demon as in the greatest celestial hierarchy. There are hierarchies of consciousness which are celestial and there are those which are terrestrial ; some divine, others demoniac, and still others including the highest Gods and universal Essences. This is the pivotal centre of the whole of the magical philosophy. It is at one and the same time a monotheism and poly- theism in a single philosophic system. The whole universe is permeated by one Life, and that Life in manifestation is represented by hosts of mighty Gods, divine beings, cosmic spirits or intelligences, call them by what name you will. The spiritual state and diversity ascribable to them is great and tremendous ; among them are those deific forces of the rosy dawn of cosmic manifestation, from whom we are sprung, spiritual sparks thrown downwards from their divine essence. It is now possible to amplify the conception of the Tree of Life and the Four Worlds in terms of consciousness. The first manifesta- tic f 0. ir -- dl' Ins are Gods or beings of the highest consciousness who, issuing rth from the Crown, comprise the Mind of the Logos or the mediate administrators of the formulated plan. These beings e the Gods, Dhyan Chohans, Elohim, Teletarchae-whatever .me is chosen, the fundamental idea should be firmly grasped. That ere are vast hierarchies of beings in space, in an orderly sequential ale of descent from the highest Gods in the highest worlds to lesser erarchies of angelic beings in the lower worlds, is fundamental to is schema. Connected with every Sephirah and every World lich has emanated from Ain Soph is a certain hierarchy of Gods, ch having a specific task in the evolution and governance of the liverse, and a characteristic nature. Just as Keser, the Crown, oduced the other Sephiros, so do the highest Gods evolve from ernselves other deities less exalted and less sublime than them- selves. Inasmuch as numbers were assigned to the Sephiros to sym- bolize creative processes in the cosmos, and since the Gods are allocated to the Sephiros, the Gods may also be symbolized by numbers, and the ideas associated with a particular cosmic process can apply equally well to the nature of a given God. Pythagoras has well said that \" there is a mysterious connection between Gods and numbers.\" \"As above, so below.\" All things on earth have their spiritual prototypes eternal in the heavens, and all beings are the childlike reflections, faint and feeble, of the Gods. The more distant (meta-"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE physically and relatively) that any emanation is from its source the more feeble and faint a reflection is it of that from which it came. The Gods or universal Essences express more clearly and brilliantly the ineffable spiritual nature of Ailz, and in their terrestrial eidolons, the lesser gods, does this limpid brilliance become more veiled and pale, and hindered from expression. In man, the shadow of the image of the Gods, the brilliance of the Brahmic splendour in most cases appears altogether repressed. As heat is to fire, growing less and even less as it sends out its influence from the flame, so is man to the Gods. The further he drifts from them, by so much does he accomplish a self-destruction. This relationship between the order of life and the Sephiros, between the Gods and mm and numbers, provides an explanation for the efficacy of the magical symbols and the parts they play in the Theurgic rites. The signs and seals are profoundly indicative of inner realities, and each particular symbol is representa- tive of some of the hierarchies of Gods and spiritual intelligences. By this doctrine of signatures each phenomenon is indissolubly connected with an ideal noumenon, the efficacy of Theurgy thus being assured. The object of Magic, then, is the return of man to the Gods, the uniting of the individual consciousness during life with the greater being of the universal Essences, the more embracing consciousness of the Gods who are the everlasting sources of light and life and love. Only thus, to the human being, may there come liberty and illumina- tion, and the power to see the beauty and the majesty of life as it really is. By returning in spirit to the sources from which he came, only by re-opening himself to them as a golden flower opens and turns to the Sun to imbibe anxiously and eagerly of its sustenance and light, so to man may come illumination, and the lifting of the earthly bonds and chains. By the discovery of his own inner God in the first place and forming an indissoluble relationship with the Gods of the universal life, herein lies the solution to the problems of man and the world. In this nobler consciousness of illumination devolving from divine union, may be resolved the intricacies of world-chaos. The cords which bind man with a strength beyond all mortal chains and fetters may thus be severed. There is no dissolution of these irons other than by the magical knowledge of his own inner self and the Gods of all existence. \" If the essence and perfection of all good are compre- hended in the gods, and the first and ancient power of them is with us priests (theurgists), and if by those who similarly adhere to more A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 59 excellent natures and genuinely obtain a union with them, the begin- ning and end of all good is earnestly pursued ; if this be the case, here the contemplation of truth, and the possession of intellectual science are to be found.

Vibrating at another rate of motion than does the gross substance of the physical world, and thus existing on a higher plane, the Astral Light contains the builder's plan or model, so to speak, projected downwards by the Ideation or Imagina- tion of the Father ; the plan on which the external world is con- structed, and within whose essence lies latent the potentiality of all growth and development. All the forces and \" ideas \" from the Creative and Archetypal realms are represented and focussed in this plastic agent, the Formative World. It is at once substance and motion, the movement being one which is \" simultaneous and per- petual in spiral lines of opposite motion.\" It was the late Lord Salisbury, I may interpolate here, who defined the ether as the nominative of the verb \" to undulate.\" In many respects this Formative World, the recipient of the higher creative forces, is comparable in its lowest aspects to the Ether of Science, There is, however, this exception. The Astral Light has been in the past and may in the future be verified by direct visional experience. The scientific conception of ether to-day is radically different from what the scientist of fifty years ago meant by the luminiferous ether. So much so, that judged by his standards and speaking his language, the modern idea of ether and its radiation waves are not realities at all. And yet, strangely enough, remarks Sir James Jeans in The Mysterious Universe, the ether is one of the most real things \" of which we have any knowledge or experience, and so is as real as anything possibly can be for us.\" The entity which the experimental physicists to-day would define as ether must be one which would respond qualitatively and quantitatively to their instruments and mathematical equations.

It lies, as already stated, on an altogether different plane of existence and consciousness, and its particles vibrate in such a way and at such a high rate of motion as to be quite invisible and imperceptible to our ordinary exterior sense-apparatus. Recent years have seen in the realm of scientific speculation the development of the electro-magnetic theory which for practical purposes of physics discards as unnecessary the Victorian hypothesis of an all-pervading undulating luminiferous ether. In its stead, there has been set up as on a lofty throne, crowned and worshipped with devotion, an even more abstract mathematical conception-the Space-time manifold or continuum. One group of scientists are wholly in favour of retaining the ether hypothesis ; while several others, no less well-known and no less authoritative, are equally certain that no such subtle structure as an ether is existent or even possible. They admit it only as a theoretical frame of reference, in which case it assumes the rBle of a working hypothesis, without any degree of objective actuality. Yet an examination of the scientific definitions of both these scientific groups reveals the fact that by the Ether and the Four-dimensional Space-time Continuum one and the same concept is entertained. Sir Arthur Eddington, in one of his recent works, when making reference to these two scientific concepts, expressed the belief that both parties mean exactly the same thing and are divided only by words. Sir James Jeans, in his previously mentioned work, observes cautiously with regard to this obscure question, that it seems appropriate to discard the word \" ether \" in favour of the more modern term \" manifold \" or \" continuum,\" although the essential principle of function is almost entirely unchanged. Elsewhere in the same learned book the statement is made by the erudite scientist that all the phenomena of electro- magnetism may be thought of as occurring in a continuum of four dimensions-three of space welded to one of time-in which it is impossible to separate the space from the time in any absolute manner. I recommend particularly this observation because it is more or less in the nature of an exact confirmation of what the more eminent magicians of all times have written concerning the Anima Mundi or the Azoth. Jean's further remarks may very roughly be stated that if we wish to visualize the propagation of light-waves and electro-magnetic forces by thinking of them as disturbances A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 63 in an ether, our ether may be thought of as a four-dimensional struc- ture, filling up the whole continuum, and so extending through all space and all time, in which case we all enjoy the same ether. This scientific ether which all can enjoy and which extends through space and time, serving as the medium for vibrations of all kinds, differs in few essentials from Levi's Astral Light. The definition perennially insisted upon by the Theurgists concerning this etheric plane is that it is a grade of refined plastic substance, less dense and gross than that which we normally see around us, magnetic and electric in nature, serving as the real ground upon which the forms and congeries of atoms in the physical universe arrange them- selves. It is that plane which, in its lowest aspect, is the veriest cess-pool of the universe, comprising that facet of consciousness which directs the instincts and energies of animals ; in its higher ramifications, soaring beyond this mundane sphere, it actually borders on the divine. That this is so may be realized by reference to the Tree of Life, on which the Formative World is seen to include not only the sphere of Yesod, but in that classification of the Tree into the Four Worlds, it will be perceived to extend far beyond Yesod to include Ti$haras, the house of the Soul, even to the edge of the Abyss. The sphere of the Foundation is only its most inferior phase. As Yesod alone it is that gross region of the metaphysical cosmos containing the cast-off astral remnants of living creatures, the bestial and mental filth sloughed off by human beings in the ascent after death to higher spheres. In its aspects of Chesed and Gevz~rah, it is the most celestial heaven, so to speak, the devachanic abode. With reference to this mode of consideration it is occasion- ally termed the divine Astral, and the Soul of the World. \" It is in itself a blind force but can be directed by the leaders of souls, who are spirits of action and energy. This is at once the whole theory of prodigies and miracles. How, in fact, could both bad and good force Nature to expose her exceptional forces ? . . . How could the reprobate, erring, perverse spirit have in some cases greater power than the spirit of Justice, so powerful in its simplicity and wisdom, if we do not assume the existence of an instrument which all can make use of, under certain conditions, on the one side for the greatest good, on the other for the greatest evil.\" I wish-to insist most strongly upon this dual interpretation of the magical ether which Levi gives here, that in it is included a base inferior element and an ennobling superior element. The former is seat of the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"64 THE TREE OF LIFE self-made cause of many of the ills of mankind, the latter being the central fire and the Soul of the World. The Divine Astral is solar and celestial in nature, whereas the gross Astral is lunar, reflective, and purely automatic. Blavatsky confirms this hypothesis of the dual nature of the Astral Light in these words : \" The Astral Light or Anima Mundi is dual or bi-sexual. The (ideal) male part of it is purely divine and spiritual, it is the Wisdom, it is Spirit or Purusha ; while the female portion is tainted in one sense, with matter, is indeed matter, and therefore is evil already.\"l Needless to say, it is entirely with the higher superior regions of the Astral Light, the solar fires, that the Theurgist is concerned. From the practical viewpoint, this plane is the magical agent to which the accumulated trained vision of Theurgists has assigned the power of transmitting vibrations and impressions not alone of physical light, heat, and sound, but those more subtle and less tangible vibrations, none the less real however because of their imperceptibility, which pertain to projected currents of Will, thought, and feeling. Levi terms this instrument the Imagination of Nature, inasmuch as it is ever alive with rich forms and exotic dreams, luxurious images, the immediate vehicle of the mental and emotional faculties. The control of this plane constitutes from one point of view the Great Work. Some Magicians, including the distinguished Levi, were of the opinion that the central magical secret is that of the willed direction of this arcanum. Being the vehicle wherein are dynamically recorded the passions and thought impressions of all mankind, the memory of lower nature, and being present on the earth all the time, inasmuch as it is all-permeant and but one plane removed from the physical, its contents must influence enormously the minds of weak and sensitive men. Not only the latter, but most of the children of earth are influenced in some way by the currents rippling through its substance. Hence to place oneself in isolation from its blind undulations, and to transcend it utterly as to move in that higher stratum which is its soul, is no mean accomplishment, but one worthy of all the energies of men. One modern magical authority, the pseudonymous Therion, states that in the upper strata of the Astral Light \" two or more objects may occupy the same space at the same time without interfering with each other or losing their outlines.

The same thing can reveal itself in an infinite number of different aspects.

On this plane, which is the magical agent par excellence, symbols and emblems and sigillae are not intellectual conventions nor even arbitrary representations of universal ideas and natural forces. They are absolute living entities, having on this plane an independent real life and existence of their own. At first sight this may not appear important; but this statement is actually of the utmost importance in magical work. Symbols represent, on the Astral plane, real and tangible entities. In a previous chapter it was endeavoured to demonstrate that Numbers were profoundly indica- tive of evolutionary and developmental processes, and were syntheti- cally expressive both of cosmic rhythm and certain occult Forces and Intelligences which we have named Gods, Dhyan Chohans, and Essences. To these Numbers representing tremendously powerful forces, various sigillae and pictographs are applicable, having in this Formative World an existence which is not at all symbolic in the sense in which we normally understand this term, but real, vital and living. In the plastic malleable substance of the Astral Light these symbols can be galvanized into activity by a trained Will and Imagination. Its substance is peculiarly susceptible to the flights and working of the imagination, the latter possessing the power to transform its perpetual flux and shapelessness into moulds and matrices which the will can stabilize and energize powerfully in a given direction. Instances among numerous others are on record of a pregnant woman receiving a nervous shock and the impression is immediately transferred through the medium of the imagination acting upon the Astral Light to the forming foetus borne within her womb.

It has always been considered as the planet of change, of generation and fertility. In The Secret Doctrine there is a good deal of out-of-the-way information and speculation con- cerning the occult relationship of the Moon to our planet, although merely to know that such a relationship does exist is enough for practical purposes on the part of the novice. The connection of the Moon with the Astral Light however is quite valid, most authorities on this point being in complete accord. Astrologically the Moon is the planet symbolising change and flux and the continual alterations of forms, the shifting of conditions. On the Astral Plane the trained vision has recorded that forms change their shape, colour and size there in the most extraordinary way ; and to the novice in Skrying it is a most disconcerting and puzzling phenomenon to have one set of perceptions fade away under one's very nose, to be replaced by another shifting of scenes to which the same fate very soon after occurs. It is a fluctuating kaleidoscope of phenomena ; the figures, forms and energies being never for a moment quiescent. Hence to establish a relationship between the Moon and the Astral Light is a perfectly obvious correspondence. Moreover, it was observed that the Moon did not shine by its own inward and self-generated light, but reflected the radiance from the Sun. Yesod, the sphere of Luna, on the Tree of Life is placed immediately under Tiplzaras, the sphere of the Sun, thus reflecting the creative forces from above. There are a number - of other highly significant reasons too numerous to mention here accounting for this association of the Moon with the Astral Light, although study and magical experience will prove the validity and accuracy of the correspondence. In the legends of every people, even the most primitive savage tribes, there enters the conception of the Astral Light as the medium of thought vibrations and of magical acts. Sir J. G. Frazer, the eminent anthropologist and authority in folk-lore, records a number of them in his Golden Bough. A number of others have also discussed the nature of this hypothetical force recognized by the primitives, without having approached to any clear formulation of its nature as the great magical agent. This could hardly be expected, inasmuch as their studies and researches never for an instant leave the academic plane. The Melanesians of the South Sea Isles believe, as Professor Bronislaw Malinowsky records in his booklet on Myths, in a storehouse or a reservoir of supernatural or A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 67 magical force which they have called mana and, like a similar force conceived as Orenda by the North American Indians, is believed to have its centre in the Moon. The latter seems to contain a huge tank, as it were, of this occult power which would appear to be associated by them with the source of life and energy. Not difficult is it to see that this conception-whether imperfectly recorded by the anthropologists or inaccurately described by the primitives it is hard to say; the probability is that the fault lies with both parties -this conception, I say, is a very vague formulation of that reality which in Magic we call the Astral Light. It was recognized quite clearly however by the Egyptian Theur- gists, and in connection therewith one is troubled by no vague theories or descriptions. For we observe that almost every yard of the so-called Upper and Under Worlds, Amentet and the Tuat, which are the two aspects, inferior and superior, of the Astral Plane, is carefully mapped out and its qualities noted. Not only so, but in some of the chapters of the Book of the Dead each sub-division is described with precision for the benefit of the deceased-and in- cidentally for the Theurgist-together with thenames of the guardians and watchers of the Pylons through which the defunct soul had to pass in order to gain admission to some other of the halls in the Kingdom of Osiris. In repeating the Egyptian view, Budge quotes that the Tuat was not considered underground nor in the sky or on its confines ; but it was located on the borders of the visible world. That it was not a particularly happy place is described in the Book of the Dead, when the Scribe Ani arrived there, seemingly be- wildered. \" There is neither water nor air here, its depth is un- fathomable, it is as dark as the darkest night and men wander about here hopelessly.\" A final observation from the venerable Keeper of Egyptian antiquities in the British Museum is that the Tuat was a region of destruction and death, a place where the dead rotted and decayed, a place of abomination and horror and terror and annihil- ation. That this coincides perfectly with the inferior astral spheres of disintegration or kama loka goes without saying. The Divine Astral was known as the Kingdom of Osiris or Amentet ; also named the Island of Truth whither no soul could be conveyed after his decease until after he had been declared \" true of word \" by the gods at the Great Reckoning. One corner of this region was specially set apart for the dwelling place of beatified souls, where Osiris as the God of Truth was the hope and eternal consolation of"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"68 THE TREE OF LIFE the spiritually-minded. Theosophically, Amentet could be named Devachan, the abode of the Gods; and from a Theurgic view- point it would occupy that part of the Azoth which we have termed the Divine Astral. According to the Book of the Dead, there are Seven Great Halls and twenty-one Pylons giving entry to this celestial region, to each of the twenty-one pylons there being two sacred watchers or guardians. In another portion of this Book, the names of the heralds and doorkeepers, together with the formulae of practical magic by which they may be overcome and an entry effected to the Island of Truth, are given at some length. So very precise in their thinking were the Egyptian Magicians that they imagined correspondences between the various divisions of Egypt and the metaphysical realms of the Tuat and Amentet. Each of the several strata or regions in the Astral World, both gross and divine, was mapped out with a precision which even to-day has neither rival nor equal. There is another very significant comparison to which attention should be directed. Among official psycho-analysts there is the concept of the Unconscious. This term implies a dynamic stream of thought, memory and tendency which runs below the level of our normal individual consciousness, serving as the receptacle of in- stincts and race-memories, and those complexes which are ofttimes the result of conscious conflict. As this collection of instincts and automatic impulses has an evolutionary origin long anterior to the formation and development of the intellect in man, it is hence more powerful and urgent within him. It is from this strata of habit and inherited race-consciousness that the primitives are supposed to have drawn in the fabrication of their eloquent myths and legends. These latter are thus not only a record of pre-historic race history but a dynamic expression of what these psychologists would call the Collective Unconscious, inasmuch as with every primitive race and people, regardless of whether there was social inter- course and communication or not, the myths and legends essen- tially are identical. Since what the analysts call the Unconscious is practically synonymous with one aspect of what the Qabalists term the Nephesch, and since the latter is grounded in the Astral Light in much the same way as the physical body is grounded upon and formed from gross matter, then between the Astral Light and the concept of the Collective Unconscious there is a clear correspondence. Just as the Unconscious with A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 69 some individuals is a subterranean volcanic entity tearing asunder the integrity and unity of the consciousness, so also the magical tradition is that it is to the lower aspect of the Astral Light, the storehouse of race-memories, predatory lusts, instincts and all animal impulses, that a greater part of mankind owes its troubles, ills, and regrettable sources of conflict. It is upon this part of the hJe$Jzesch or the Unconscious that the Magician, avers Levi, must set his foot, that it must be conquered, controlled, and kept in its proper place. At the same time, however, the so-called Unconscious with its wealth of animated material, its fertility of impressive ideas and suggestions may be for some people the source of poetic and artistic inspiration. This aspect of the Unconscious, the higher or divine aspect of the Astral Light, or the Neschamah in man, it is which the Magician seeks to cultivate and expand, since with its growth, development and facility of expression pro- ceeds also his own individual integrity and the ability to surpass himself. Within this Astral Light which individually we carry with us at all times and in all places, we live and move and have our being. Every thought that we think stamps an indelible impress on the impressionable substance of that plane-in fact tradition has it that it coalesces with one of the creatures of that plane and then passes away from our immediate control into this pulsating ocean of vitality and feeling to influence other minds for good or for ill. Every living thing breathes and intakes this Light freely, and to none is it exclusive or private. Indeed in it we live very much as a fish lives in water, surrounded on all sides and in every direction ; and like a fish we constantly breathe it in and out through astral gills, as it were, taking energy therefrom and adding a variety of impressions thereto with the passing of each moment. Not only is this magical agent the Imagination of Nature, but it also fills the rBle of the Memory of Nature, for each act that we perform, each thought that enters our brain, each emotion as it leaves the heart, registers itself on the astral matter, remaining there for all time as an eternal record so that those who are able to may see and read. On this topic Eliphas Levi has significantly remarked that \"The Book of Con- sciences which, according to the Christian doctrine, will be opened on the Last Day, is nothing more than the Astral Light in which are preserved the impressions of every Logos, that is every action and every form. There are no solitary acts and there are no secret acts ;"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"70 THE TREE OF LIFE all that we truly will, that is, all that we confirm by our deeds, is written in the Astral Light.\" While some might think that for the Theurgist there could scarcely be anything more interesting and illuminating than to examine the memory of that Light, yet in reality the Theurgist does not do so, for it possesses neither interest nor practical utility for him. His one object being the acquisition of self-knowledge and divine union, it would be little short of a waste of valuable time to engage in the transliteration of this record. Although it is necessary for the Magician to investigate the nature of this Light in his Body of Light, and to have familarized himself with the variegated aspects of consciousness which this plane continually presents, so far as his own work is concerned he ever seeks to ascend to the more fiery spiritual realms. His interest in the Astral Light is,, that being a dynamic magnetic plane, it serves more readily and adequately than anything else to focus the forces and intelligences with which he aspires to come into contact. Secondly, because in that Light, or in its superior strata, he may perceive himself in reflection, as others see him, as it were, and thus acquire reliable data leading to self- knoyledge. Separating the good from the evil, the solar divine ether from the malefic lunar ether, a division automatically occurs in this Light. On this plane the impure thoughts of men would appear to continue for a longer period of time than the good, because the latter apparently ascend to the higher strata, to the regions of Harmony and the upper portions of the Formative World. The result is that the Astral Light, whose lunar space is peopled with the coarser and malicious elements of being, gradually becomes more and more contaminated, its filth hanging over mankind like a toxic death-dealing shroud. In the books of the Qabalah the constituents of this poisonous pall are likened to the Qliphos or the excremental shells of the lowest grades of existence. They are the averse cortices, \" dog-faced demons \" according to the Chaldaean Oracles \" in whom there is no trace of virtue, showing never to mortals any sign of truth.\" It is this aspect of the Astral Light which for each man is the evil seducing serpent of Genesis, and it is that blind aspect which must be transcended by the Theurgist since being represented in his own constitution it is that which hinders the ac&omplishment of the Great Work. Were this prokess of filling the Astral Plane with Qliphos to continue indefinitely, without any adequate means A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 71 of ridding it and affecting a purification, it would result in the total poisoning of the human race by its own vile emanations. Despite all the efforts of the meagre band of Mystics and Theurgists down through the ages, who transmute by their own life and spiritual attainment the base elements into an abiding and gracious good nevertheless the evil becomes top-heavy, so to speak. The excessive malefic force is then precipitated in accordance with natural and cyclic laws. In the forms of disastrous convulsions of Nature do these precipitations of astral impurity occur. Earthquakes, elemen- tal fires and floods, and cataclysmic crimes and diseases, are some of its manifestations. Writing profoundly in confirmation of this view, Eliphas Levi registers the conviction that the Astral Light is \"the mysterious force whose equilibrium is social life, progress, civilization, and whose disturbance is anarchy, revolution, barbarism, from whose chaos a new equilibrium at length evolves, the cosmos of a new order, when another dove has brooded over the blackened and disturbed waters. This is the force by which the world is upset, the seasons are changed, by which the night of misery and misrule may be transfigured into the day of Christ . . . into the era of a new civilization, when the morning stars sing together and all the sons of God utter a joyful shout.\" Thus, at the same time, the Astral Light is a nimbus of the utmost sanctity as well as a vile serpent of destruction ; the highest conception of a celestial realm as well as the basest hell of depravity. If it is through the channels of the Astral Light that universal calamities are effected, and if anarchy and catastrophes are the result of its inequilibrium and disturbance, it follows that by this means also can a new and improved order of equilibrium and harmony be instituted upon the earth even in our own time. A more gracious civilization may thus be the outcome of our present haphazard passage through chaos and ignoble confusion. Here, then, lies a key to hand. Some have accused the Theurgist of being selfish in that he first appears to strive for his own salvation. In reality it is to this great accomplishment, to this transfiguration of the world of misrule into a brighter aon, that he is sworn ; to be the unseen and silent herald of a new and better world. On the surface it may seem that he attempts to obtain a degree of spiritual consciousness for himself alone, and that he cares not at all for the welfare of mankind. But his efforts to attain divinity eventually reacts to the utmost advan-"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"72 THE TREE OF LIFE tage upon the normal run of mankind. \" I,\" said one sage, \" if I be lifted up, will lift all mankind with me.\" So it is with the Theurgist. Proclus has observed that by means of the magical invocations and the spiritual union the divine essences seem after a manner to come down to the world and incarnate among the ranks of men. When the Theurgist has consummated union with the Universal Soul, and become one with the great Essences constituting the Soul and directing Intelligence of Adam Kadmon, the Heavenly Man, to be actually of incomparable service to mankind lies well within his power. For mankind will have been supremely exalted by the descent of the Gods. To make the necessary changes in the plastic substance and archetypes of the Formative World, which will work themselves out accordingly on the physical plane and help to elevate the minds of men and restore the eternal harmony and order of the spheres, sources of life and being, will then be a definite possibility. But until the Magician has himself instituted harmony within the sphere of his own consciousness, his power is limited. Until beauty and illumination are the order of his own life, and until he has equilibrated that sphere with the Universal Essences, the everlasting centres of Light and Life sustaining the universe in all its branches, he cannot bring ultimate fulfilment to this utopian dream of mankind. A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE I N connection with the complex philosophical controversy of centuries relating to the subjectivity or the objectivity of phenomena, there are some highly abstruse problems to be resolved by each individual Theurgist. Each one clamours im- periously for response. The Qabalah leaves the whole question open to be answered eventually in the light of spiritual experience. Not lightly to be passed over is this great problem, although the magical practice need not necessarily be affected by one view held in preference to another. Many Theurgists have preferred the obvious straightforward view of consideration free of all complexities of metaphysics. It considers all individual things, the Gods, and all the forces of Nature to exist independently of one another, and exterior to the individual consciousness ; that the Theurgist is but an infinitesimal portion of the majestic grandeur of universality. This theory presupposes that the spiritual hierarchies exist in the most objective fashion conceivable. Somewhere in the universe on some subtle invisible plane, is an intelligence named Taphthar- tharath, for example, who is as real a being in his own way as one's tailor is in his, and that like the tailor he responds when called forth by the appropriate methods. Taphthartharath is thus as independent of the sensorium and consciousness of the Magician, as the latter is independent of that of a common house fly. Both exist objectively each on his own plane and in his own way. The same remarks apply to the various subtle planes of Nature with which the Magician comes in contact. Though they are invisible, and are composed of a very subtle and rarefied substance, yet they likewise are objective to his own mind. Thus progress in Theurgy implies an actual union between the lesser consciousness of the Magician and the greater consciousness of the God. The former is assimilated into the very fabric and nature of the Other. One of the fundamental postulates of Magic is that Man is an exact image in miniature of the universe, both considered object- 73"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"74 THE TREE OF LIFE ively, and that what man perceives to be existent without is also in some way represented within. One interpretation provided to this idea by Blavatsky-and indeed by all occult philosophers, including Steiner and Heindl-is that man was formed through the agency of several creative hierarchies, each of whom not only contributed some part of itself to the being in process of formation, but actually descended and incarnated themselves in human nature. Evidences likewise exist in the Book of the Dead demonstrating that among the Egyptians no part of man was not related to the Universal Essences ; that each member and part of his nature, in fact, was the member of some God. By this theory, the Gods and the Universal Essences come to be apprehended within the interior constitution of man, lending itself to the interpretation that by the Theurgic art is implied not the calling forth of extraneous entities, as is the case with the objective theory, but the unfolding of the faculties inherent in man himself. From this point of consideration, the mystical experience has no primary reference to any external sub- ject. Putting the matter a little more precisely, the spiritual change of union is fundamentally a readjustment of psychic elements to each other, enabling the whole machine to work harmoniously. There is no necessary introduction through the channels of the magical ritual of new ideas, or Gods. By its means there is a casting out of decaying ideas which have clogged the vital process with disastrous consequences. The psychic organization or the soul had not been in harmony with itself, and through the machinery of Magic it now revolves truly on its own axis, and in doing so it simultaneously finds its true orbit in the cosmic system. In becoming one with itself, in making this dynamic readjustment, this resumption of the integrity of its consciousness, it becomes one with the universe, or with some part of the universe. The process is analagous to one which on the physical plane ensues in a person whose jaw, for instance, is dislocated. The miserable man with a dislocated jaw is not only out of harmony with himself but with the universe ; neither his own efforts nor those of his friends can help him. But along comes a surgeon, and with the application of a slight pressure the jaw springs into place ; the man is restored to harmony-and of course the universe is ecstatically transformed. Thus \" union with a god \" and the consequent ecstasy are the outcome of harmonizing, or equilibrizing by means of Magic, the various hitherto conflicting or separated portions of the consciousness.

Certain centres of his mind or powerful ideas, hitherto dormant within the departments of his own being, have been stimulated to the extent that a higher synthesis and a better world is revealed. Since it is upon his own consciousness that the Magician desires to impinge, to expand and elevate its limits, a brief review must be given of the methods by which the Theurgists conceive that con- sciousness. Previously, the Tree of Life was considered as a numerical symbol of the orderly progression of the universe from ideality ; as a classifying medium to which to refer systematically the spiritual hierarchies ; and third as the frame of reference for ideas, symbols and signs which enter into practical Magic. The Sephiros may be thought of as cosmic forces ; as emanations whose chief sphere of operation is in the macrocosm. By analogy, and since man is by definition the microcosm, similar principles prevail in the human economy. The hierarchies of Gods, being cosmic in their activities, are also, from the very greatest to the least, repre- sented in some part of the principles which in their totality comprise what we know as man, just as they in themselves, as the totality of cosmic forces, are included in the unifying conception of The Heavenly Man. The Celtic poet A. E., in his most recent work, Song and Its Foz~ntains, in which he contrives to trace the source of lyrical creation to an inner spiritual entity beyond the imagination, perceives most beautifully this conception. \" I think we might find if our meditation was profound that the spokes of our egoity ran out to some celestial zodiac. And, as in dream the ego is dramatically sundered into This and That and Thou and I, so in the totality of our nature are all beings men have imagined, aeons, archangels, dominions, and powers, the hosts of darkness and the hosts of light, and we may bring this multudinous being to a unity and be inheritors of its myriad wisdom.\" From the great beings who issued at the dawn of time down to the lowest elemental and aeon, all the heavenly gods and forces are contained in man who is the living Temple of the Holy Ghost.

The whole man is one spirit, one eternal centre of consciousness, all the other principles being variations of its activities, enclosing sheaths of its own sub- stance, spirituality and corporeality being but two facets of one and the same essence. The Monad is like a mirror, and although immutable in itself, reflects at the same time the harmony of all other Monads with whom, in the body of Adam Kadmon, it is in indivisible congress. Its direct vehicles are the powers of Chokmah and Binah-Wisdom and Understanding, the two manifested poles of the creative instrument which it employs. Yet not only are they instruments, but they are in reality the highest aspects of the activity of the spiritual being whose hallowed light is infinite and eternal. In man these two Sephiros are represented by principles named Chiah and Neschamah, the Will and the Spiritual Soul whose nature is Intuition. Existing on the creative plane, reflecting the potencies emanating from the Divine Self in the Archetypal World, the Will and Soul constitute with the Monad, the imperishable unchanging Man. Not the Monad alone, for as a principle it is too abstract and too spiritually aloof ever to be conceived of as man, but this trinity of Sephiros form collectively a metaphysical unity which is the Inner God, the Creator in the individual life, the artist and the poet, the Genius whose ideal creations are projected from its own divine essence into the wake-a-world consciousness of its immediate vehicle. It is this celestial triad, the Monad with its vehicles of Will and Intuition, which is actually a God, a divine intelligence on earth for the obtaining of experience and self-con- sciousness. The more one enters into communion with this entity, and the more firmly is the personal consciousness entrenched in its all-embracing, more tender, and more extensive consciousness, so does one realize more fully the sacrament of incarnation, achieving the full splendour of that eternal miracle-Manhood. In the creator of the individual universe, do we live and move and have our being. Yet so absurd are the ways of men, and so far have we drifted from essentials, that few of us consciously realize our godhood ; that we, like Christ, like Buddha, like Krishna, are sons of God, Gods in all verity.

It is also as the active aspect of the Theosophical Buddhi, normally the casket of the Monad, peculiarly connected with the coiled serpent splendour, the Kundalini, symbolized by the Uraeus found on the forehead and headdress of many an Egyptian deity. As the Chiah is the active energetic creative power, and inasmuch as in practical magic the Wand is the ceremonial instrument of creation, so is the Wand the true symbol of the Spiritual Will, one, upright, towering to the heavens, a mighty and irresistible power of creation. The Neschanzah being in opposition to Chiah on the Tree, is feminine and passive, representing the true spiritual vision of Intuition or Imagination. Like the Chalice on the altar it is ever open to receive the dictates and commands issuing from above. To it also is referred the spiritualized imagination called Kriyasakti, which, with the will, is the power par excellence utilized in Magic. These three principles, like the Supernal Sephiros, exist beyond the Abyss, reflecting themselves downward into the phenomenal universe of human consciousness where the human soul with the lower will, memory and imagination holds sway. But while these latter do exist below the Abyss, their noumena exist above the Abyss without the limitation and restriction that the lower mind and human conditions generally impose upon them. The more one opens oneself to the divine Will and the divine Imagination of the inner God the greater does one become in the manifestation of one's godhood, an oracle of the most high, an unsullied vehicle of the purest spiritual fire. Just as a poet or a musician is only so and never otherwise when the apocalyptic inspiration is being poured into him from his own divine source, which fact, however, in most cases is hardly even recognized let alone understood and encouraged, so does a man exist as a better Mystic and a greater Magician who abdicates in devout sacrifice the oblation of his own human will and ego, that the Will of his Father in heaven may be done on earth. As the Supernal Sephiros and the Cosmic Essences project them- selves into denser forms and into less subtle matter, so also do the human Sephiros in obedience to the law of the macrocosm. Below the Abyss, the next five Sephiros are named the Human Soul or the Ruaclz, a composite principle of Reason, Will, Imagination, Memory and Emotion centred in the Sephirah of Harmony.

This Ruach calling itself \" I,\" changing momentarily with the passing of time, upset by the flux and pressing surge of mutable thoughts and convulsive emotions, is just the one thing which is not \" I \". Simply a vehicle, it has assumed-as an ape simulates the actions of its master-the prerogative of a separate existence, divorcing itself from its own divine lord, the energy which alone gives it life and sustcnance. In Magic it is this empirical ego, this lower self which must be offered up in sacrifice to the Holy Guardinn Angel. As the concept of sacrifice implies that that which is renounced should be the best and the greatest sacrifice, so a well-developed Ruach, well- trained in all the processes of logic and thought, well stored with knowledge and observation, and perfect so far as is possible in the things of its own realm, is the greatest sacrifice which the hlagician can lay upon the altar, as an offering to the most High. \" He that loses his life shall find it.\" Normally, because of the illusory nature of the mind in which is focussed the centre of consciousncss, and because of its own pre- dilection to things cold and illusory, our vision of the Higher Self is obscured, preventing our cIoser contact with the real, permanent, and immortal conscioksness which is reallv ours.

When the smugness and the false egoism in the Ruach is rooted out, it is an instrument of the soul than which few could be better. The ninth Sephirah is the foundation of the lower man. It is called the Neplzesch, and it is that lunar vegetative and instinctual principle which is concerned solely with the act of living. This animal soul is at one and the same time a principle of energy and plastic substance, the totality of the vital life currents as well as the invisible astral mould on which the gross atoms arrange themselves as the physical body. As a substantive principle it is the astral body, the plastic double built of astral substance and serving as the basis or design of the physical body. Nourished by the Astral Light, upon which it draws precisely as the physical body is nour- ished by the produce and energies of earth, it is comparable to what is termed the Subconscious-although possessing neither mind nor intelligence of its own-in that every thought that we think, every emotion felt, every action performed, leaves an indelible impress or memory upon that substance, thus preserving in the Astral body the reflection and automatic record of the past life. All, or nearly all of the characteristics attributed by psycho-analysts to the Subconscious are likewise attributable to the Nephesclt, or at least that aspect of the Nephesch pertaining to the instincts and impulses, and which acts as an automatic storehouse of sensations and impressions, just as the term the Collective Unconscious may well be applied to our concept of the Astral Light. All the funda- mental instincts of a man, the primal root impulses which he experiences are of the Sephirah of Yesod, the Foundation from which all life-energy flows. All these principles obtain in and function as a living organism in the principle of the physical body, the Guph, attributed to the tenth and last Sephirah of the Kingdom, the seat of every force and function of all the subtle planes of nature, and every spiritual power of man. In all truth, and in this sense, the human body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost. It is with the Ruach or the lower Manas with which I wish in particular to occupy myself at some little length.

Another problem which concerns the Magician is the fact that inherent in the Ruach is a principle of self-contradiction which prevents its use, independent of any superior assistance, in the quest for truth and light. Else- where I have contrived to deal somewhat with this question of the inability of the rational man to transcend the phenomenal world, and a great deal more in elaboration of this theme may be found in Kant's splendid treatment of the Four Antinomies of Reason in the Prolegomena, in Bradley's Appearance and Reality, and an excellent summary is in Tertium Orgalzum by P. D. Ouspensky. Using the reason alone man can never come to any true realization of what he is in himself ; that is, he can never understand by the mind alone that he is an eternal spiritual entity, a brilliant star shining by the light of its own essence within the bespangled body of Kuit, the Queen of Infinite Space. To really know oneself as a God and to enter into the communion with the personal creator, man must use other instruments and other faculties. Iamblichus lays the law down quite clearly in The Mysteries, that not by discursive reasoning or through philosophic thinking alone does one come into fellowship with the Gods. It is through the awakening of the higher spiritual powers by means of the rites of Theurgy that the consummation of the long ages is effected. \" For a conception of the mind does not conjoin Theurgists with the Gods ; since if this were the case, what would hinder those who philosophize theoretic- ally from having a theurgic union with the Gods ? . . . Now, how- ever, in reality this is not the case. For the perfect efficacy of ineffable works, which are divinely performed in a way surpassing all intelligence, and the power of inexplicable symbols, which are known only to the Gods, impart theurgic union. Hence we do not perform these things through intellectual perception.\" It is a common observation that an individual who has but little intellectual power is frequently more in touch with a spiritual presence, 2nd more open to intuitions than his more gifted intel- lectual brother. Paracelsus has assured us that the great Mysteries may often better be apprehended by a simple woman at her spinning- wheel than by scholarship the most profound.

It is not the lack of mentality or intellect which makes the peasant superior. In that the peasant lacks mentality he is indeed the inferior, since obviously it is mind which differentiates man from the beasts of the field. But when that mentality is corrupted by complacency, by the persuasion that it is supreme, by egotistical sophistry as is more often than not the case, then the lack of it becomes a high virtue in comparison. Havelock Ellis cites an instance in corroboration of the above. He narrates that during a long ride through the Australian bush with a quiet unsophisticated settler, the latter suddenly confided that at times he would ascend to the top of a hill and become lost to himself and to everything as he stood in con- templation of the scene around him. Those moments of ecstasy, of self-forgetful union with the divine beauty of all-surrounding Nature were entirely compatible, observes Ellis, with the outlook of a simple hard-working man unencumbered by theology, dog- matic tradition, and the sophistication of civilized ways. Now, it is true that the Mysteries were and are more easily com- prehended, and intuitions more frequently opened within the unsophisticated and the unintellectual (I do not say unintelligent)- because in them is no rational barrier to the telestic rays of the Neschamah. Nevertheless since the RuacK has been developed by virtue of long evolution it should not be wholly neglected but should be encouraged to develop in its own field and on the plane of applica- tion which has been accorded it. And here is, in a sense, where a certain danger of Theurgy intrudes. It is not enough for the Theurgist to be god-intoxicated and enwrapt in the knowledge and conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel and the Essences of the Gods. Great as this is in itself, it is not yet sufficient. For into him whose mind is disorderly and ignorant and ill-disciplined the Gods pour their wine in vain. Because the reason is abdicated to reach a higher synthesis and a nobler kind of consciousness, there is no cause to neglect the application of that faculty to the matters pertaining to its own place in nature. That is why, under the system of Pythagoras, grammar, rhetoric, and logic were taught to cultivate and improve the mind ; and mathematics too, because the methods of that science were disciplinary and orderly. Geometry, music, and astronomy were also inculcated and a system of symbols was developed therefrom. This outline of intellectual training the"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"82 THE TREE OF LIFE modern Theurgist can make no mistake in following. The cultiva- tion of the intellectual insight is an essential task ; but this done, there remains a step still to be taken. \" The wizard king,\" writes Vaughan, \" builds his tower of speculation by the hands of human workmen till he reaches the top story, and then summons his genii to fashion the battlements of adamant, and crown them with starry fire.\" It is little use contemplating the battlements of the tower until the tower itself is a possibility. Nor is it particularly advisable to build the apex of the pyramid before providing the basis whereon the pyramid may stand. But once the basis is there, and the tower of reason is built, the battlements and the apex of spiritual experience are an urgent necessity. Thus the supreme object of all magical ritual is the building of the pyramidal apex, and the installation of the battlements on the intellectual tower ; in other words, the communion with the Higher Self. For every man is that the most important step, and no other compares with it in importance and validity until this one union has been accomplished. It brings with it new powers, new exten- sions of consciousness, and a new vision of life. It throws a brilliant ray of illumination on the hitherto dark phases of life, removing from the mind the clouds which inhibit the glory of the spiritual light. With the attainment of the Vision and the Perfume one sees, as did Jacob Boehme perceive, the entire field of natural existence literally ablaze with a divine incomparable splendour, so that even the trees lift up their heads to the skies, and the grasses in the green meadows chant gently in praise and thanksgiving, offering hymns of glory to the Supernal Light. In the fullness of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, the Theurgist is able to foresee with the extension of the light of reason what further steps are to be taken in the great quest which has not ended with the illumination of the Angel, but one, he sees, which has only just begun. The whole universe is a vast range of spiritual hierarchies, and the Holy Guardian Angel stands on but one rung of that great ladder which extends above and below into Infinity. The Theurgist perceives that he is but a spark thrown off from the spiritual essence of a God, and amazingly brilliant though his own Angel be, if, as the principles of his Art teach him, that Angel is but a spark, how much more glorious is the God who gave it birth ? Thus his aspiration under the guidance of his Angel is ever directed upwards and onwards, furthering his inner A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 83 vision to the One Life, to Ain Soph, the Unnameable Source of all. Nature does not proceed by jerks or with unbridgeable gaps or leaps. Hers is a graduated march, and this steady forward surge of progress the Theurgist seeks to emulate. Union with Ain Soph cannot be effected at once ; he must slowly climb the ladder of Life, uniting himself on each rung in love and wisdom with each superior hierarch, until the Boundless Eternal Light is reached. Iamblichus con- ceives the same procedure in these words : \" And when the soul has received Him as its leader, the daemon immediately presides over the soul, giving completion to its lives, and binds it to body when it descends. He likewise governs the common animal of the soul, and directs its peculiar life, and imparts to us the principles of all our thought and reasonings. We also perform such things as he suggests to our intellect, and he continues to govern us till, through sacerdotal Theurgy, we obtain a God for the inspective guardian and leader of the soul. For then the daemon either yields or delivers his government to a more excellent nature, or is sub- jected to him as contributing to his guardianship, or in some way is ministrant to him as to his lord.\" It is not so much that the Holy Guardian Angel yields the govern- ment of the human soul to the presence of the God, but that the soul, already united with the Angel and thus forming one complete being, unites likewise with the God. Or it may be that the Angel who bas taken unto itself the life of the soul is correspondingly assumed into the large and superior life of the God, who to the Angel is as the Angel was formerly to the soul. Proceeding yet further, Iamblichus adds : \" Moreover, after it (that is Theurgy) has conjoined the soul to the several parts of the universe, and to the total divine powers which pass through it ; then it leads the soul to, and deposits it in the whole Demiurgos, and causes it to be independent of all matter, and to be co-united with the eternal reason alone. But my meaning is, that it peculiarly connects the soul with the self-begotten and self-moved God, and with the all- sustaining intellectual and all-adorning powers of the God, and likewise with that power of him which elevates to truth, and with his self-perfect, effective, and other demiurgic powers ; so that the theurgic soul becomes perfectly established in the energies and demiurgic intellections of these powers. Then also it inserts the soul in the whole demiurgic God.

By the \" divine \" the Theurgists recognized an eternal spiritually dynamic principle and its refracted manifestation in Beings whose conscious- ness, individually and severally, are of so lofty and sublime a degree of spirituality as actually to merit the term Gods. This is, obviously, the objective view, and I shall speak of the Gods in this chapter solely from this viewpoint, leaving the reader to interpret them otherwise if he so will. A caveat must be entered in this place, however. It must not be thought that the Theurgists and the divine Philosopliers were polytheists in any ordinary sense. Such a conclusion would indeed be very far from what is actually true. Even for the Egyptians, who possessed a well-filled pantheon of hierarchies and celestial gods and who are accused so frequently of being primitively and crudely polytheistic, E. A. Wallis Budge proffers a defence. For although the uneducated loved a plurality of gods, \" the priests and educated classes who could read and understand books adopted the idea of One God, the creator of all beings in heaven and on earth who, for want of a better word, were called ' gods.' \" This is much the position of the viewpoint employed in Magic. Primarily there is but one Omnipresent Life pervading the whole cosmos. It permeates and thrills in every corner and portion of space, sustaining the individual life of every being existing in any of the infinite worlds. Unknown in itself, since being omnipresent and boundless in every direction and exalted beyond intellectual reach, it could never be comprehended by the human mind. But this much must be realized, that from It come forth all the gods, all human souls and spirits, and every conceivable thing that is. 85"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"86 THE TREE OF LIFE In some way, incomprehensible to our finite understanding, the negative and passive energy homogeneously scattered throughout space became enlivened, forming itself into primeval active centres which, with the passing of aeons of time, expanded and gradually evolved into the cosmos. With these centres, the first manifesta- tions, there sprang from the latent homogeneity a heterogeneous group of divine entities or cosmic Intelligent forces who became the architects and builders of the universe. From their own individual spiritual essence, lesser hierarchies were born, and these in turn emanated or created from themselves yet other groups until eventually the human souls came into being, the reflected offspring of the blessed Gods. These intelligent forces have been variously named Gods, Daimons, Universal Essences, Dhyan Chohans, Aeons, Teletarchae and many other names. They all imply the same fundamental idea of conscious (though not necessarily self-conscious, intellectual) centres of force, wisdom, and intelligence who emanate or create, in one wav or another, from themselves the manifested finite universe. By the Egyptian Theurgists these cosmic forces or Gods were very closely studied, and their attributes carefully observed and recorded in the form of parables, allegories, myths, and legends. Even in the conventional pictographs of their deities, each of the emblems has a high significance which is at once profound in implica- tion as it is simply eloquent in description of the characteristics of the God. For instance, a blue Plume carried in the hand of one of the Gods, or else surmounting the headdress, implied Truth, Stead- fastness and Uprightness ; whereas a Sceptre was intended to convey the idea that such a God carried with him supreme authority and sovereignty. Each separate symbol and sigil born by the God on some part of his person was a clue to his inherent nature. The myths and legends passed down to posterity by the Egyptian priests concerning the Gods were not mere idle inventions by ignorant though imaginative men who, having nothing else better to do, occupied themselves in story telling and in weaving pleasant and unpleasant fictions about the figments of their minds. On the contrary, so far from being puerile, in each one of these legends and pictorial descriptions of the Gods is concealed a wealth of trans- cendental knowledge for whomsoever has the ability to perceive it. With so astute a race of people as the Egyptians, a people who evolved a hardy civilization whose remains stand as noble A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 87 memorials even to this day, it could hardly be believed that their myths should be but interesting yarns, any more than the Gods recognized by them were non-existent or, at least, child- like fantasies. It should never be considered that the Egyptian Pantheon, particularly the Gods associated with the Theurgic cults, were in any degree mythical in the sense that they were the result of the playful sporting of a fertile inventive faculty. Prirnitive man did not \" create \" the Gods, as think so many modern students of Comparative religion who are destitute of all sympathy and religious genius. What he really did, perhaps unconsciously, was to apply names (and even these names were significant) and quasi-human faculties to these \" powers \" or great forces of Nature which he so accurately observed, and which he believed rightly enough to be manifestations or symbols of the divine. All the thoughts and ideas, all the great learning and knowledge of the Egyptians, found their pictorial expression in allegory, parable and paintings. Thus have we received them to-day. To dismiss their well- developed system of instructive legend and mythology as prepos- terous and childish, is but indicative of a puerile and shallow intelli- gence. It can be demonstrated that only a little study is necessary to reveal a depth of insight which was never before realized to exist. In addition, the vignettes and painted symbols of the Gods with which the Egyptians were wont to decorate their papyri, by the same token are not merely infantile drawings of vague intellectual opinions. Each God in the Egyptian myth had a precise well-defined function to perform in the cosmos-creative, preservative or destructive, as the case may be-and that function had been accurately ascertained by observation, both secular and theurgic, carried over a long period of time, and the qualities and nature of the God were expressed in pictures. That the Egyptians con- ceived lia the Sun-God to exist actually in such a conventional art-form as that in which they painted him, I am not to be construed as believing. Nor that they considered the Sun at midnight to assume the form of a beetle. What they actually did believe was that the symbol of the scarabeaus expressed in various subtle ways the nature of the Sun after the hour of setting. The Cow, likewise, was a symbol of exuberant fertility ; the Ibis a symbol of Wisdom and supreme Intelligence.

The whole subject should be carefully studied, and if half as much care and attention is given by the reader to the study of the Gods as the average man devotes to his daily newspaper, a great deal of useful knowledge of profound importance in Magic will be gained. The evolution and development of the Cosmos, spiritual and physical, were first recorded by philosophers in geometrical changes of form. Every esoteric cosmogony used a circle, a point, a triangle and a cube and so on. These later were incorporated into a simple geometrical form such as is called in the Qabalah \" The Tree of Life.\" To each cosmic development a number was applied, and existing as the specific meaning of the number or the particular phase of evolution was the activity of a God or a hierarchy of Gods. Thus in the Qabalah we have ten primary emanations. To each of these is a number assigned, and in each number therefore is implied a God. There are ten series of hierarchies of cosmic forces, spiritual, dynamic and intelligent, whose concerted operations result in the formation of the physical universe. The tradition of the Theurgists classifies them in a descending scale of purity and spirituality, from the Gods to Archangels, Intelligences and Spirits. Since, in Magic the object is to achieve in one way or another a close and abiding spiritual union with these cosmic deities who are the underlying realities and the sources of sustenance and vitality, it is advisable to give a brief description of them as understood by the Egyptians. The table below will classify them according to their hierarchies and graduated scale, and the interpretation will be assisted if the reader remembers the statements made concerning the Sephiros in a previous chapter. Of each one of these Gods, I shall present a short description based on Egyptological texts, leaving the reader to interpret as he will. The nature of the archangels, intelligences and spirits named on the table below will be revealed by the attributes of the ruling Deity. Corresponding to the cosmic development represented among the Qabalists by Keser, the Crown, Ptah is the Egyptian deity the meaning of whose name is the Opener. For the Egyptologists this seems to have been a stumbling block in their classifications, for in the event that he is assumed to be associated with the opening of the day by the Sun, singularly enough he never forms one of the important groups of the Sun gods in the hieratic texts.

Budge, in confirmation, also points out that the etymological root of Ptah is cognate with the meaning of another word meaning to carve or to chisel. This cognate root places the God excellently, as does the word \" artificer \" appearing in the texts. For not only does Ptah open the evolutionary cycle but it is he who, issuing from the thrice- unknown darkness, is the Great Architect of the Universe, giving, together with Thoth and Isis, birth to manifested things. He was called \" the very great god who came into being in the earliest time,\" and to conclusively indicate his nature, he was also considered"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"90 THE TREE OF LIFE to be the \" father of the beginnings and creator of the egg(s) of the Sun and Moon.\" In the same category with Ptah, as a correspondence of the same series of philosophic ideas connected with The Crown, is the god Amoun or Amen. He was the invisible creative power which was the source of all life in heaven, on earth, and in the underworld, eventually making himself manifest in Ra the Sun-God. The name itself indicates that which is hidden or concealed, and in Ptolemaic times the name became associated with a word meaning \" to abide,\" and also \" to be permanent.\" In one of the sacerdotal documents the God is hailed in such terms as provide us with a telling description of his real nature. \" The holy soul who came into being in the beginning . . . the first divine substance which gave birth unto the other two divine substances; the being through whom every other god hath existence.\" There is, in addition, a considerable amount of evidence leading one to believe that Osiris might be assigned to this same category. Thc British Museum brochure on the Book of the Dead makes the statement with regard to an Egyptian princess that she was able to regard Amen-Ra and Osiris not as two different Gods but as two aspects of the same God. She believed that the \" hidden \" creative power vested in Amen was but another form of the same power typified by Osiris. In all accuracy, however, Osiris must be regarded as the human incarnation of the creative power, the assumption in manhood of the most High God ; an Avatara, if you will, of the Supreme Spirit. There is every reason to believe that this viewpoint of Osiris is the correct one. For he also stood for renewed birth and a spiritual resurrection, typifying the illuminated Adept, purified by trial and suffering ; one who died, and after descending to the Underworld, miraculously rose again glorified, to reign eternally in the heavens. In so far as this is the case, he will be considered as a type pertaining to Tiphayas. There is nevertheless one aspect of him, Asar-Un-Nefer, Osiris made Beneficent or Perfect, in which deific form he is a most apt representation of that phase of Keser which is the most real and deepest aspect of selfhood. The nature of Thoth or Tahuti and the description of the charac- teristics which the Egyptians ascribed to him, leave not the slightest room for doubt as to his immediate allocation to Chokwtah.

The name, Tahuti, appears to be derived from the supposed oldest name of the Ibis, which was a bird suggesting by its very posture, meditation and consequently wisdom. There is an excellent description of the attributes of Thoth in Budge's Tlze Gods of the Egyptians and I cite as follows : \" In the first place, he was held to be both the heart and the tongue of Ra, that is to say, he was the reason and the mental powers of the God, and the means by which their will was translated into speech ; from one aspect he was speech itself and in later times he may well have represented, as Dr. Birch said, the Logos of Plato. In every legend in which Thoth takes a prominent part we see that it is he who speaks the word that results in the wishes of Ra being carried into effect, and it is evident that when he had once given the word of command, that command could not fail to be carried out by one means or another. He spoke the words which resulted in the creation of the heavens and the earth. . . . His knowledge and powers of calcu- lation measured out the heavens, and planned the earth, and every- thing which is in them ; his will and power kept the forces in heaven and in earth in equilibrium ; it was his skill in celestial mathematics which made proper use of the laws upon which the foundations and the maintenance of the universe rested ; it was he who directed the motions of the heavenly bodies and their times and seasons.\" He was, in fine, the personification of the mind of God or the Logos, and as the all-pervading and governing and directing power of the heaven, he forms a feature of the Egyptian religion \" which is as sublime as the belief in the resurrection of the dead in a spiritual body, and as the doctrine of everlasting life.\" Pallas Athena is the Greek Goddess of Wisdom, fabled to have sprung full-armed from the brain of the mighty Father, Zeus. Uranos, the god of the starry heavens, might also be placed in this same category with Thoth and Athena, for it must be mentioned that traditionally Chokmah is also called the Sphere of the Fixed Stars. Isis, corresponding to Binah, was regarded as the parent of the universe, the first offspring of the ages, ruler of the sky, the sea, and all things on earth, and was the Supernal Mother whom the whole of the ancient world worshipped under many names. It was in connection with the Queen of Heaven, as the compassionate and omnipotent mistress of both worlds, that she drew to herself so great a crowd of devotees and sincere votaries. To briefly sum-"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"92 THE TREE OF LIFE marize Budge concerning her, we may state that Isis was considered the great and beneficent Mother whose influence and love pervaded all heaven, earth, and the abode of the dead, she being the personifi- cation of the great passive reproductive power which conceived immaculately and brought forth every living creature and thing. What she brought forth she protected, cared for, fed and nourished ; she employed her own life in using her power graciously and success- fully, not only creating new things but in restoring those that were dead. She was, besides all these things, the highest type of faithful and loving wife and mother. It was in this capacity that the Egyptians honoured and worshipped her most. According to the now familiar legend, Osiris her husband was slain through the cunning of his brother Typhon or Set (emblematic of the destructive aspect of Nature), and his body thrust iilto a box which, after being thrown into the Nile, was carried out to sea. After a long wearisome search Isis found it, and set it as she thought in a safe hiding place, where it was found however by Typhon, who maliciously cut the corpse into a number of pieces. The incidents of her search for the mutilated body, and of the conception and birth of her child Horus, powerfully impressed the imaginations of the Egyptians. Particularly so, when the legend narrates her seeking help from Thoth the God of Wisdom and Magic, and he by his consummate skill in the Theurgic Arts was able to tell her of processes and words of power which temporarily restored Osiris to life, and enabled him beget upon her the god-child Horus. In addition to the above there is the obscure legend relating to the helping part that Isis, paradoxically, extended to Typhon in the battle waged by Horus who, so enraged by the seeming treachery of his mother, killed and decapitated her. Immediately, however, Thoth transformed her head into that of a cow which he attached to her body. In its own way, this legend indicates the relation which exists between Isis the Mother and the cow-goddess Hathor, many of the attributes of the latter appearing to coincide in a number of significant respects with those of Isis. The Tree of Life, adumbrating diagrammatically the process of evolution, should aid somewhat in the comprehension of the idea underlying this legend, as should the Greek legend attaching to Kronos, who is also a Binah attribution. In that legend Kronos is described as depriving his father Uranos of the government of the world, and in turn was deprived by his own son Zeus. Blavatsky provides a A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 93 suggestive explanation of this parable in The Secret Doctrine. Roughly, it implies that Kronos stands for endless Duration, begin- ningless and endless, beyond divided Time and Space. Those Gods who were born to act in space and time, that is to break through the circle of the spiritual realm into the terrestrial plane, are said allegorically to have rebelled against Kronos and fought the (then) one living and highest God. In his turn, when Kronos is represented as mutilating his father, the meaning of the mutilation is simple. Absolute Time is made to become the finite and condition ; a portion is robbed from the whole, thus showing that Kronos, the father of the gods, has been transformed from Eternal Duration into a limited period of time. The same interpretation may also be attached to the decapitation of Isis, resulting in her transition as a supernal creative goddess to a lower terrestrial plane. Maat, the goddess attributed to the sphere of Chesed, is in the ancient Egyptian system closely allied with Thoth ; so closely, in fact, that she may almost be regarded as his feminine counterpart. The type and symbol of this goddess is the ostrich feather, single or double, which is always fastened to her headdress or held in her hand. Primarily indicating \" that which is straight,\" the word \" maat \" was used in a physical and moral sense, so that eventually it came to mean \" right, true, upright, righteous.\" This goddess, then, embodies the ideas of physical and moral law, order, truth, and cosmic regularity. It may be noticed that many of these attributes of Maat are likewise significations assigned by astrologers to the planet Jupiter which is one of the correspondences of the same Sephirah to which Maat is attributed. As a moral power, Maat was conceded to be the greatest of the goddesses, and she came to be the lady of the Judgment Hall in the Tuat, or the underworld, where the weighing of the heart took place in the presence of Osiris. Usually figured as a woman seated or standing, she holds in one hand the sceptre of sovereignty, and in the other the Ankh, the symbol of life. Some pictures show her to be provided with a pair of wings which are attached one to each arm, and in some few cases she is portrayed bearing the plume of Truth upon her head, upright, without any headdress at all. The Roman Jupiter was originally an elemental deity, and was worshipped as the god of rain, storm, thunder and lightning. The Lord of heaven, and the prince of light, he was the god who foresaw the future, and the events he foresaw happened as the result of his"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE will. Zeus is his Greek equivalent, and they both are assigned to Chesed. The translation of the fifth Sephirah Gevurak as \" Might \" together with its astrological correspondence of Mars, most appropriately sums up the characteristic of Horus. He is the Egyptian God of Might who has many forms, the most important of which are two- Hoor-paar-Kraat and Heru-Khuti. As the former, the Greek Harpocrates, he is represented wearing a lock of hair, the symbol of radiant youth, on the right side of his head ; sometimes, too, he wears the triple crown with plumes and disks upon his head as headdress, and occasionally the disk with plumes alone. In most cases he is pictured with his forefinger raised to his lips, in the sign of silence. As Heru-Khuti, \" Horus of the two horizons,\" he is usually represented as a hawk, wearing a solar disk encircled with a Urzus serpent, or with the triple or ateph crown. With the Sun- God he was closely connected, and represented the solar disk in its daily course across the skies from sunrise to sunset. But it is as Horus, the offspring of Isis and Osiris, that he connects with Gevurah ; in his aspect of the avenger of the murder and violation of his father. Figured as a hawk, he was able from the heights of heaven to see his father's enemies, whom he chased, so runs the legend, in the form of a great winged disk. With such wrath and vigour did he attack these enemies that they all lost their senses, and could neither see with their eyes nor hear with their ears. The statements concerning Horus made in the British Museum brochure are so interesting in this connection that they are given as follows : \" When Horus arrived at years of maturity he set out to find Set and to wage war against his father's murderer. At length they met and a fierce fight ensued, and though Set was defeated before he was finally hurled to the ground, he succeeded in tearing out the right eye of Horus and keeping it. Even after this fight Set was able to persecute Isis, and Horus was powerless to prevent it until Thoth made Set give him the right eye of Horus which he had carried off. Thoth then brought the eye to Horus, and replaced it in his face, and restored sight to it by spitting upon it. Horus then sought out the body of Osiris in order to raise it up to life, and when he found it he untied the bandages so that Osiris might move his limbs, and rise up. Under the direction of Thoth, Horus recited a series of formulz as he presented offerings to Osiris. . . . He embraced Osiris and so transferred to him his ka., i.e. his own living A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE personality and virility, and gave him his eye which Thoth had rescued from Set and had replaced in his face. As soon as Osiris had eaten the eye of Horus he . . . recovered thereby the complete use of all his mental faculties, which death had suspended. Straight- way he rose up from his bier, and became the Lord of the Dead and King of the Under-World.\" Mars and Ares are the Greek and Roman equivalents, being worshipped as the gods of war and battle, continuing the essential idea of Gevurali, strength, might and energy. It is with Ti$haras and the gods associated with it that I wish to deal at somewhat greater length, inasmuch as they are those concerning more than any others the aspiration of the Magician. Since Tipliaras is the sphere of Beauty and Harmony, as well as the \"house of the soul,\" the gods traditionally associated there- with are peculiarly symbolic and representative of the glorified soul, or the Holy Guardian Angel. Dionysius, Osiris, Mithra, and many others are all types of immortality, beauty and equilib- rium. Maurice Maeterlinck has rather splendidly sumnlarized the whole philosophic position in this respect. \" Dionysius,\" he says, \" . . . is Osiris, Krishna, Buddha ; he is all the divine incarna- tions ; he is the god who descends into or rather manifests himself in man ; he is death, temporary and illusory, and rebirth, actual and immortal ; he is the temporary union with the divine that is but the prelude to the final union, the endless cycle of the eternal Becoming.\" The deities typical of TiPJzaras, hence, represent the illuminated soul, exalted through suffering, perfected through trial, and re-arisen in glory and triumph. Osiris may be assumed to be fairly representative of these rejuvenescent divinities, and there are evidences to the fact that from first to last Osiris was to the Egyptians the god-man who suffered and died, and rose again, to be King of the spiritual realm. The Egyptians believed that they could inherit the eternal life as he had done, provided that what was done for him by the gods was done for them, this providing the rationale for the performance of the so-called Dramatic Ritual. They celebrated rituals in order that they might compel or persuade Osiris and the gods who had brought about his resurrection (that is Thoth, \" the lord of divine words, the scribe of the gods,\" Isis who employed the magical words Thoth had given her, and Horus and the other gods who performed the rites which produced the resurrec- tion of Osiris) to act on their behalf even as They had acted for the god."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"96 THE TREE OF LIFE The worship of Biithi-a and Dionysius springs from the same underlying root. It connects too with the spiritual triumph of the God-Man, and the return of the Sun-God who, as a symbol of the perfected soul, has entered the human consciousness of man, and having enlightened the mind and redeemed the darkness of his life, makes light and joyous the imprisoned spirit. Rrishna hke- %vise is a symbol of the God-&Pan, for in him spirit and matter were equilibrated, and in becoming an Avatara, the earthly abode of the universal spirit, he resumed in one human personality the dual qualities of a God, immortal, and ecstatic, together wit11 all the characteristics typical of mankind, To T+lzaras the Sun is also attributed. Thus Ra-including also Turn and Khephra, the setting and midnight Sun-belong to this series of Gods. To the Egyptians so holy was the conception of the Sun, that to Ra thcy gave the attributes of divine light and life ; he was the personification of right, truth, goodness, and con- sequentIy the destroyer of darkness, night, wickedness and ed. His rehiions with Usiris, who was part god and part man and the cause and type of immortality for man, were at once those of a god, father and an equal. It was in Ra that some of the noblest religions conceptions of the Egyptians concentred, and from the solar god, the giver of sustenance and vitality, both physical and spiritual, to thc d\\vcllcrs of earth, he became identified with Amoun, the hidden creative power which had given rise to the whole manifested unis-erse. The nature of Osiris is well show in the legends that to men he taught the use of corn and the cultivation of the grape, and in this latter phase he is clearly identified with Dionysius-Bacchus, the god of abounding vitality anrl ccstasy ol the Greeks. In time Osiris came to be regarded as the rnonarcll of the dead and the guide of soul; out of the darkiless of cart11 into the bI~ssful realm where, according to their theology, they u70uld have iull. view of the divin~ty without restraint. The departed from this life, if the life had becn well-lived, is in a mystic manner identified with Osiris ; in the life of the God he too has no insignificant part. Dionysius was ~vorsl~ipped in Greece as the power bringing forth leaves and blossoms and fruit in the trees. Thc vine with its clusters of grapes, whence springs the wine gbddenhg the hearts of men, was his greatest but by no means his only work. As the god of the tree and the vine, lie is a kindly and gentle deity, ennobling man and his A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"HATHOR The Egyptian Aphrodite"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 97 life, delighting in peace and plenty, bestowing wealth and exuber- ance upon his worshippers. Though, in the legend, storm-beaten, torn and tortured by his persecutors, though the thyrsus-bearing God flies from his persecuting enemies, he rises once again to new life and renewed activity. Under the name of Iacchos, the brother or the bridegroom of Persephone, he had his part with her and Demeter in the rites of Eleusis. It may be interesting to point out in passing that Persephone is an attribution of the Kingdom, named in the Zolzar the Virgin, the Bride of the Son who is in Tiplzaras. It was this gracious youthful Dionysius, the deity suffering and transformed, at once evanescent and everlasting, dying and spring- ing again to a new spiritual life, who was the chief divinity of the poets and mystics of the sect called Orphic, in whose Mysteries the soul and its fortunes when released from the body became the prominent object. A similar god, expressing the same idea of spiritual equilibrium and transformation, a god possessing almost identical character- istics as Dionysius, was Mithra, the Persian God of Light, the light of the body and the light of the soul. He typified the brilliant power of the Sun which, unfailingly, conquers day after day and year after year the powers of darkness and its terrors. Mithra, commonly worshipped in a cave which, originally perhaps repre- senting the recess under the earth wherein the Sun at night was supposed to hide, came to signify to devout worsllippers the abyss of incarnation into which the soul must descend. Then, like the god himself, they could arise, purified by many trials and sufferings, with glory and with exaltation. The goddess Hathor, together with Aphrodite and Demeter, are associated with the Sephirah Netsach, Victory. In the earliest times in Egypt, Hathor was considered as a cosmic goddess, and she was believed to have been, as the cow-goddess, the personifica- tion of the generative power of Nature which was perpetually conceiving and creating, bringing forth and maintaining all things. She was the \" mother of her father, and the daughter of her Son,\" which at once recalls the traditional formula of the Tetragram- maton. There seems to have been no little connection between her and Isis and Nuit, the queen and personification of space. We have already described the legend in which Horus killed Isis, whose head is transformed by Thoth into the head of a cow, the head of Hathor. This was suggested to imply the evolutionary A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"98 THE TREE OF LIFE transformation of the cosmic generative energies of Isis from above the Abyss into a more mundane sphere of manifestation. There are various forms in which she is portrayed, the more frequent being that of a Cow. Sometimes Hathor is represented as a woman wearing a pair of horns within which rests the solar disk ; at others with a vulture tiara, in the front of which is the Uraeus serpent, surmounted by five other Uraei. On the back of her neck there is usually found a symbol signifying joy and pleasure, and on her back also is a kind of saddle cloth with a linear design, and the whole of her body is sometimes marked with crosses, which are probably intended to represent stars. In the latter picture she undoubtedly represents Nuit from whose breasts the milk of the stars is said to flow. She represented, as Hathor, not only what was true, but what was good, and all that is best in woman as wife, mother and daughter ; she was also the patron goddess of all singers, dancers, and merry- makers of every kind, of beautiful women, and of love, of artists, and of artistic works. It is in this association that she compares with Aphrodite the Lady of Love. As an equivalent of Demeter, she stands for the apparently inexhaustible fecundity, the generation of plants and animals succeeding each other on earth, and which to the earth return. It was undoubtedly as the fertile goddess of vegetation and agriculture that she was worshipped, particularly as the ancients considered growth and development as an act of love. Hermes and Anubis are correspondences of Hod, the Glory. Hermes is an intellectual god, and represents in a much lesser degree the qualities of Thoth. Whereas the latter is a cosmic and a transcendental deity, Hermes is a terrestrial god, described as having invented astrology and geometry, medicine and botany; who organized government and established the worship of the gods ; he invented figures, and the letters of the alphabet, and the arts of reading, writing and oratory in all its branches. He was also employed to conduct the shades of the departed from the upper to the lower world. Here he is associated in idea with Anubis or knpu, the jackal-headed god of the Egyptians, there being also the Greek combination of these two names in Hermanubis. The head which was the type and symbol of Anubis was the jackal. This seems to prove, according to Budge, that in earliest times Anubis was merely the jackal god associated with the dead, simply because the jackal was generally seen prowling about the tombs."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE But he may additionally be conceived of as the dog-headed deity. The dog is a watcher and a guardian, in which function Anubis is portrayed in the Tuat. By analogy he represents the reason in man, which is also the guardian of the human consciousness, watch- ing impressions and reactions to the exterior world. Tradition declares of Anubis that he was the god who embalmed the body of Osiris and that he swathed it with the linen swathings made by Isis. From various other passages in the Book of the Dead it is clear that Anubis was a great god in the Underworld, and his rank and importance seems to have been as great as that of Osiris. In the Judgment scene in the Tuat, Anubis the Watcher appears to act for Osiris with whom he is intimately connected, for it is he whose duty it is to examine the tongue of the great Balance, and to take care that the beam is exactly horizontal. The goddess Bast or Pasht, who is the deity correspondence of Yesod the Foundation, is usually represented in the form of a woman with the head of a Cat. She also has at times the head of a lioness surmounted by a snake, holding in her right hand a sistrum, and in her left hand an zgis surmounted by either the head of a cat or a lioness. She was a personification of the moon, especially as Khensu her son was aIso a Iunar god. With the head of a lioness which is usually painted green she symbolized the sunlight ; but when cat-headed-her connection with the moon is undoubted. Associated with the sphere of the Foundation, as expressing the dual aspect of the Astral Light, was not only Bast but Shu. Change and stability are the two paradoxical characteristics of that Light, Bast expressing the lunar aspect of change and perpetual flux, and the idea of stability and a firm foundation to things is expressed in the form of ~hu. Sometimes he is seen gasping a scorpion, a serpent, or a hawk-headed sceptre, and was worshipped as the god of the space which existed between the earth and the sky. It was he who held up the sky with his hands, one supporting it at the place of sunrise, and the other at the place of sunset. He has been identified with the vital principle of things, which is in accord with the implicit theory of the Astral Light which is the direct vehicle of the five pranas or vital currents. In his capacity of sky- bearer, there is an interesting myth. When the great god Ra ruled over the gods and men, mankind on earth began to utter seditious words against him, causing him to determine to destroy them. Summoning various gods to conference, at the suggestion A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"100 THE TREE OF LIFE of Kuit he commissioned Hathor to effect the world-wide destruction of men. Soon after this, he wearied of the earth itseIf, and Nuit having assumed the form of a cow, Ra seated himself on her back. Before long, the cow began to shake and tremble because of the elevation above the earth, and so Shu was commanded to support her and hold her up in the sky. When Shu had taken his place beneath the cow and was bearing up her body, the heavens above and the earth beneath came into being, and the four legs of the cow became the four props of the heavens at the four cardinal points. Thus came the god Seb into separate existence. Seb was the god of the earth, and the earth formed his body and was called the House of Seb, just as the air was called the House of Shu, and the heavens the House of Ra. He is represented as a man bearing the Ateph Crown, and sometimes the form of a goose is added thereto. Corresponding to Malkus, the Kingdom, Seb represents the fertility of the surface of the earth, and in the mythology of the underworld he played a prominent part, retaining those of the departed who were unable to pass into the Tuat. The Greek goddess of the earth, similar to the Egyptian Seb, was Persephone, known among the Romans under the name of Proserpine. The story of her rape by Hades, and her enforced imprisonment under the earth is too well known to require mention here. Some interpreters refer to it as the disappearance in the body and the subsequent rebirth of the Soul, while others see in Proserpine a simple myth of the vegetation cult, the goddess being the seed-corn which remains concealed in the ground part of the year, and when she returns to her Mother Demeter, is like the corn rising from the earth, the nourishment and food of man and beasts. Though this must conclude the examination of the Gods so far as this subject may be gone into here, it cannot be too frequently iterated that this highly complex subject should be well studied in its various aspects and philosophical connections before the practical work of invocation is undertaken. Before there can be any degree of real success in invocation, and in firmly establishing a union and fellowship with the Gods, the Theurgist should be well acquainted, at least in theory, with the nature of the Gods, what principles or functions they fulfil in the natural and universal economy, and what they really are.

The Theurgist should endeavour to understand as far as is possible why the forms of animals are adopted as masks of the Gods, and there being many interpretations of this, a synthesis should be made from those which seem the most probable and the most sensible. And I might add as a suggestion that a study of the painted representations of the Gods will be well repaid. The interested student could do no less than visit the Egyptian galleries of the British or any other Museum, and thoroughly acquaint himself with the conventional art-forms by which the Gods are represented.

It is a technical system of training wllich has a divine objective, rather than a mundane terrestrial one. If it be thought by some too casual observers that the Theurgist busies himself exclusively with objective things it is only because that it is through them and the noumena they sym- bolize that he is able to attain his ends. The equipment used by the Magician is not the sole means which he utilizes, nor the only instrument to his ends, though the invisible aspect of his worltings could never have been grasped by the profane without elucidation. All things, physical and mental, were of necessity to enter into his work, and it was not for the purpose of deluding either himself or his votaries that the Magician surrounded himself with what may be considered to be highly impressive \" stage apparatus \" of wands, cups, incenses and perfumes, strange signs and symbols, bells and barbarous sounding invocations. It was in connection with the symbols and sigilla that Iamblichus wrote that \" they (Theurgists) imitating the nature of the universe and the fabricative energy of the Gods, exhibit certain images through symbols of mystic, occult and invisible intellections ; just as nature . . . expresses invisible reasons through invisible forms. . . . Hence the Egyptians, per- ceiving that all superior natures rejoice in the similitude to them of inferior beings, and thus wishing to fill the latter with good, through the greatest possible imitation of the former, very properly exhibit a mode of theologizing adapted to the mystic doctrine concealed in the symbols.\" This, however, fails fully to supply an adequate and satisfactory answer to the common question why it is that the Magician is equipped with such \" props \" as robe, bell and circle, all of which to the average person are quite incomprehensible, somewhat repugnant, and smacking no little of charlatanism. This opinion is of course wholly incorrect. Actually, it is just as erroneous and as unjustifiable as to accuse a physicist of quackery because 105 A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE in his laboratory he has several microscopes of differing strengths, fitted with wheels, tubes and slides, and that his desk is littered with papers, bearing incomprehensible physical and mathematical formula. The latter are but means whereby the physicist comes to understand germs, bacilli and microscopic organisms, and so forth with the study of which he has occupied himself. The magical apparatus is likewise the means-just as incomprel~ensible to the layman-by which the Magician is able to understand himself, and commune with the invisible but no less real parts of nature. We have already defined Magic as the science having for its objective the training and strengthening of Will and Imagination. More than aught else, it is thought and will which really count in Magic, and the magical hypothesis is that by the use of the instruments of art and the sigillze with which the Theurgist surrounds himself in his cere- monial work that this enhancement of the creative faculties is obtained. Eliphas Levi is very definite on this point, and observes that \" ceremonies, vestments, perfumes, characters and figures being necessary as we have said to employ the imagination in the education of the Will, the success of the magical operations depends on the faithful observance of every rite.\" It might also be added, upon the presence and faithful use of all the correct sigilla. Hieratic, suggestive, and no little impressive, the important point about these instruments and robes, these signs and tokens, is that they are symbols representing either an inherent occult force in man or an Essence or principle obtaining as an intelligent moving force in the universe. Their prime intention is to arouse an auto- matic current of harmonious thought, or an irresistible impetus in the imagination which will exalt the Magician's being in the direction arranged by the character of the ceremony and by the individual nature of the symbols. In short, magical ritual is a mnemonic process so arranged as to result in the deliberate exhilaration of the Will and the exaltation of the Imagination, the end being the purification of the personality and the attainment of a spiritual state of consciousness, in which the ego enters into a union with either its own Higher Self or a God. By each act, word and thought, this one object of any particular ceremony is constantly being indicated. Even the sigillz are different for each ceremony so as to indicate its unique purpose, and one kind of symbol is applicable only to the invocation of one species of universal essence. \" There is not anything,\" believed"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 107 Iamblichus, \" which in the smallest degree is adapted to the Gods to which the Gods are not immediately present and with which they are not conjoined.\" For the assault on the Holy City, every sense and every faculty is deliberately mobilized, and the whole individual soul of the operator must enter into the act. Each of the several fumigations, each minute detail of banishing, invocation and circumambulation is actually to serve as a reminder of the single purpose which alone exists for the Magician, a means both of concentration of his powers and exaltation. When symbol upon symbol has affected his consciousness, when emotion beyond emotion having been roused to stimulate the imagination of the Magician, then the supreme orgiastic moment arrives. Every nerve of the body, every force channel of mind and soul is strained in one over- whelming spasm of bliss, one ecstatic overflowing of the Will and the whole of the being in the predetermined direction. Every impression, by means of the Qabalistic method of associa- tion of ideas, is made the starting point of a series of connected thoughts eventuating in the supreme idea of the invocation. When, during a ceremony, the Theurgist stands within an octagon, then the names around the circle, the eight candles merrily burning without, the predominance of the colour orange, the rising of the incense Storax in a wisp-like column of cloud from the thurible, will all suggest the meaning of Mercury and Hermes to his mind. Mysticism ordinarily conceives the senses as barriers to the light of the soul, and that the presence of the latter is debarred from manifestation by reason of the seductive influence and turbulence of the senses and mind. In Magic, however, the senses are considered to be, when under control, the golden gateways through which the King of Glory may come in. In the work of invocation, every sense and every faculty must be made to participate. \" Understanding must be formulated by signs and summarized by characters or pentacles. The Will must be determined by words and the words by acts. The magical idea must be translated into light for the eyes, harmony for the ears, perfumes for the sense of smell, savours for the mouth, and shapes for the touch.\" This quotation from the thought of Eliphas Levi will adequately convey in what manner the entire man must participate in the Theurgic rites. Since, as we have seen, the Egyptian ritualist uttered that there is no part of him which is not of the Gods, to utilize the senses and powers of the mind in a well-ordered ritual is the ideal method for invoking the A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE Gods. Each individual part of man, each sense and power must be brought within the scope of a rite in which it plays a part. It is our preoccupation, normally, with the separate perpetual require- ments of the body and mind and emotions which blind us to the presence of that inner principle, the sole reality of the interior life. Hence one of the requirements of ritual is that it must either fully occupy or tranquillize those particular portions of one's being that the transcendental union with the Daimon may not be interfered with. The elaborate system of God forms, vibration of divine names, gestures and signs, signatures of spirits, the prominence of geometric symbols and penetrative perfumes, besides their osten- sible purpose to invoke the desired idea to manifestation, have this auxiliary motive. It is to fully occupy the attention of each of the lower principles, or to exhilarate them, that is one of the functions of ritual, leaving the soul free to be exalted and wing its way to the celestial fire, where eventually it is wholly consumed, to be reborn in bliss and spirituality. In one sense, the effect of the ritual and the ceremony is to keep the senses and vehicles engaged each with its own specific task, without distracting the higher concentration of the Magician. And, moreover, it separates them by assigning a definite task to each. Thus, when the moment of exaltation arrives, when the mystical marriage is consummated, the ego is naked, stripped utterly of all its enclosing sheaths, left free to turn in what- soever direction it will. At the same time, the most important function of the ceremony is fulfilled ; there being aroused in the heart of the Operator so intense an intoxication as to serve as the preliminary to the ecstasy of union with the God or Angel. From another point of view, the effect of the ritual and the apparatus is to create so completely in the imagination of the Magician, through the channels of the senses, an idea which-by reason of its supreme reality, illumination, and power when evoked -has been named a God or Spirit. This is the subjective position which, in anticipation, was outlined on a former page. \" All the spirits, and as it were the essences of all things, lie hid in us, and are born and brought forth only by the working, power (will) and phantasy (imagination) of the micro~osm.\"~ Barrett, in the quoted sentence, argues that the gods and hierarchies of spirits may be reasonably supposed to be but previously unknown facets of our own consciousness. Their evocation or invocation by the Magician The Magus. Francis Barrett."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 109 is certainly not incomparable to a stimulation of some part of the mind or imagination, resulting in ecstasy, inspiration and the expansion of the consciousness. The observation and experience of Theurgists, carried out over a long period of time, has more or less shown that between certain words, numbers, gestures, perfumes and shapes not particularly significant in themselves, there is a peculiar natural relationship. The imagination is a powerful creative agency and when stimulated in various ways its creations take on a semblance of the highest reality. Any rudimentary or dormant idea or thought in the imagination-or as the Theurgists prefer, a Spirit-may be called forth or created within the individual con- sciousness by the use and combination of those things which are harmonious with it, expressing particular phases of or sympathies with its nature. Little does it matter whether to describe it we use the archaisms of mediaval philosophers, the laboratory language of the psycho-analyst, or the dream phantasy world of the poet. We may call it the release of the subconscious, the restoration of the twilight of race-memory, or we may dare be courageous enough to use the ringing old-fashioned word \" invocation \" or inspiration. The words are nothing ; the fact is all. Just as the letters \" d. o. g.\" in themselves and in isolation one from the other have no particular import, but in combination convey the idea of a dog, so also magical words, incenses, pentacles, and the stimulus of the Will may produce within the imagination an idea of great power. In fact, so powerful can this creation prove, that it may confer inspiration, illumination, and react to great advantage on the human mind. I wish now to consider the various appurtenances that are used. Perfumes and incenses have always been employed in magical rites, and the ancient Thaumaturgists made an especial study of the physical and moral reaction of different odnurs. Their employment in ceremonial is for a threefold purpose. In some operations it is occasionally necessary to provide a material vehicle or basis for the manifesting spirit. Quantities of the appropriate incenses are burnt, so that from the heavy particles floating as a dense smoky cloud in the atmosphere a physical basis or body can be constructed by the evoked spirit, to be used for the purpose of a temporary vehicle. Moreover, perfumes are offered as a sweet-smelling offering or sacrifice to the spirit or Angel itself, the incense varying with each class of intelligence. Benzoin and sandalwood are used for A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE Venusian spirits ; mace and storax for Mercurial ; sulphur for Saturnian ; galbanum and cinnamon for Solar forces, and so on. Thirdly there is the all-important intoxicant effect of the powerful and penetrative incenses on the consciousness itself, a separate one being assigned to accompany the invocation of each deity. There is also another interpretation of the use of incenses. Each letter of the Hebrew alphabet has attributed to it a long number of corre- spondences, of spirits, intelligences, colours, gems, ideas and incenses. By taking the letters in the name of a spirit, and consult- ing the proper authorities, a compound of incenses may be made which will spell, through the sense of smell, the name of the spirit. From this compound of perfumes alone the appropriate spirit may be suggested in the imagination and called forth by the proper rites. There can be little doubt as to the essential suggestiveness of these perfumes, since even for ordinary individuals some incenses are definitely seductive and excitant, such as musk and patchouli ; yet others overwhelmingly fragrant and generous, and others which are sedative and tranquillizing. As for sound, its formative power is more or less well known, and will be considered a little more fully on a later page in connection with the so-called \" barbarous names of evocation.\" Suffice to state for the moment that sound connects with the law of vibration, whose forces are powerful enough to shatter or build anew whatso- ever form the vibration is directed towards. The Egyptologist, Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, has made the observation that to words uttered under certain conditions the greatest importance was attached by the Egyptian priests. In fact, the whole efficacy of the Theurgic invocations appear to have depended upon the manner and tone of voice in which the words were spoken. Invocation, says Iamblichus, \" is the divine key which opens to men the pene- tralia of the Gods ; accustoms us to the splendid rivers of supernal light ; and in a short time disposes them for the ineffable embrace and contact of the Gods ; and does not desist till it raises us to the summit of all.\"' The sacrament for the sense of Taste, is a more difficult problem. Its rationale as the Eucharist amounts simply to this. A substance is ceremonially consecrated and named after a spiritual principle having a special affinity for it. A wheaten wafer would be in close affinity to Ceres or Persephone ; wine for Bacchus and Dionysius. The Mystcvies. Iamblichus."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 111 Some substances will be more in accord with Jupiterian or Mercurial intelligences than others. Study of the magical alphabet will enable the student to ascertain what should be used. Thus named, the substance is charged by invocation with that divine presence, and being consumed it is anticipated that, through the assimilation of elements, the God or the divine essence invoked invariably incar- nates in the Magician's being, by means of the consecrated substance. This incarnation is another form of the Union of the Theurgist with the God, which union by definition of those in authority among the ancients is one of the most important aspects of Magic. This particular species of Union, if continued in over a period of time, assists the communion with the divine Essences, as the vehicles become more refined and more highly sensitive to the presence of the God. So far as the sense of Sight is concerned, it will be necessary to deal more fully with the different symbols used. Certain of these symbols are, naturally, common to every ceremony ; while others pertain strictly to a particular ceremony. For example, the spear is a martial weapon to which a rBle would be given in an operation devoted to the invocation of Horus and Mars. In a ceremony arranged for the calling forth, say, of Aphrodite or of Isis, it would be unsympathetic, and altogether out of harmony with their nature, and consequently the whole of the proceedings would be nullified. An accessory such as the rose, expressing love and the declaration of Nature to be like grace the daughter of God, would be most appropriate in a ceremony in which the Theurgist wishes to develop his higher emotions. But working for the invocation of the Lady Maat, the Queen of Truth, it would have no place at all. The principal symbol common to every operation is the Magical Circle. By definition this figure implies a confining space, a limita- tion, separating that which is within from that which is without. By the use of the Circle, the Magician asserts that within this self- imposed limitation he confines his labours ; that he limits himself to the attainment of a specific end, and that no longer is he in a maze of illusion and perpetual change as a blind wanderer without aim, objective or aspiration. The Circle, in addition to being, as is evident, the symbol of the infinite, also typiiies tlie astral sphere of the Slagiciau which, in one sensc, is the i~ldividual co~~sciousness, his universe, outside of which nothing car1 exist. In this instance, as a. rlleans of explanation, tllc subjective idealist theory is again A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"112 THE TREE OF LIFE convenient. The Circle in which the Magician is enclosed represents his particular cosmos ; the conquest, self-inaugurated, of that universe is part of the process to attain complete self-consciousness. Since the cosmos is a creation of the transcendental Ego, as a Magician enlarges the scope of his universe, acquainting himself with its structure and diversity, by so much more does he approach to self-realization. From another point of view the Circle may be considered to be Ain Soph, and the central Point of the Circle the Self, whose duty is to expand itself to include the circumference, and become, too, the Infinite. Around this Circle are inscribed divine names. Many of them will differ with the nature of each ceremony, and it is upon the innate power and influcnce inherent in the names that the Magician relies as a protection against the vicious demons without-the hostile thoughts of his own ego. Mention of the guardian names about the Circle raises the question as to the process of protecting the interior astral circle, the universe of consciousness, and how suitable pro- tection for the astral sphere as for the outer Circle may be obtained. It is not enough for the Magician to paint the divine names on the circumference of the Circle on the floor in his temple ; that is but one part of the actual process, and is but an external visible sign of an inward spiritual grace. To produce an astral Circle which will be as impregnable as a steel fortress, and of which the painted Circle will be a worthy symbol, banishings should be performed for months several times daily. The consecration and invocation which are implicit in the Banishing Ritual, should perseveringly be performed day after day, and a subtle spiritual substance from higher planes infused into the astral sphere, making it resilient and flashing with corruscations of light. This sharply-glittering aura constitutes the real magical Circle of which the visible one on the temple floor is but an earthly symbol. A few further remarks on the Magical Circle would not be amiss to explain the real position of Magic against the opprobrium cast by William Q. Judge-one of the founders of the Theosophical Society with Madame Blavatsliy in 1875-in his Notes on tlze Ultaga- vad Gita. William Q. Judge cherishes the illusion in that work, as do so many othcr writers elsewhere, that all magical operations are exclusively devoted to the evocation of elementals. That this is an erroneous assumption this book will go far, I hope, to show. It is by no means inconceivable, however, that Judge so gives it this"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 113 interpretation to restrain the weaker brethren, and keep them out of danger and from tampering with things beyond them. Judge expresses the belief that the use of the Circle as a protective device to restrain the entry of demons and other astral entities is due to fear of them, and he rightly concludes that fear is the outcome of ignorance, which very properly he deplores. Theoretically, these remarks are all very fine and plausible. Ignorance does give rise to A MAGICAL CIRCLE fear and is at the root of failure and a vast amount of trouble. In everyday life, however, do we decry and prohibit the use of surgical prophylactics and disinfective devices on the ground that they have their roots in the fear of infection ? Are sidewalks and pave- ments to be abolished and removed from our streets because they are eloquent reminders and expressions of our panic fear of automobile accidents ? In reality the entire argument in this direction is an absurdity. In any event it implies a complete misunderstanding of the nature, the purpose, and the function of the Circle. When danger A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE is foreseen from any given source one naturally takes such steps as one thinks will prevent it, all ideas of fear and ignorance being beyond the point ; that is the reason why men exist on the earth to-day. If, for example, I am engaged in a ceremony having for its object the invocation of my Holy Guardian Angel, am I to remain content to have my mind, my soul, and the sphere of operation generally, invaded by a host of loathsome entities, the lowest deni- zens of the astral plane who, without doubt, would be attracted by the magnetic influences emanating from my circle ? To do so would vitiate my every effort, and foredoom the operation, if ceremonially performed, to dismal failure. Not only so, but obsession might be the result, one far removed from the original purpose of the en- deavour. The function of the Circle is simply to set a spatial limit within which spiritual work may proceed unmolested and without fear of intrusion by demoniac and extraneous forces. Anyway, to enter upon a career of Magic with craven fear in one's heart is simply to invite trouble. And there is usually enough trouble in the normal span of life without assuming the heroics of asking for more. Indicating the nature of the work, within the Circle is usually inscribed another geometrical figure, such as a square, an octagon, a tau-cross, or a triangle. A five-pointed figure will denote a Martial operation and represents the empire of the Will over the elements. An Octagon will indicate ceremonial work of a mercurial nature, since eight is the number of Hod, the Sephirah to which Mercury is attributed. Erected within this figure, as the foundation of all his work, the symbol of the lower Will, is thc Altar on which are arrayed the magical instruments to be employed. It is the fundamental centre of the Magician's work, the pivot to which he again and again returns from the circumambulation. It should be so built, this altar, that its shape and size, the very materials from which it is constructed, are all in accord with the fundamental philosophic principles of the Qabalah, thus serving to remind him of the work on hand. Cedar wood, for instance, if employed in the construction of the Altar, would bring about an imaginative association with Jupiter; whereas Oak is an attribution of Mars. The wood of the Laurel or Acacia, both of which are attributed to Tiphayas, would how- ever be harmonious for no matter what kind of working, inasmuch as Tiplzaras and its correspondences symbolize harmony and equilib- rium. This altar should so be made that it can act as a cupboard, in the interior of which all the instruments may be safely kcpt and"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 115 guarded. One exception, however, exists to this general rule. The lamp must always hang above the Theurgist's head, and is never kept in the altar cupboard. It symbolizes in every system the undimmed radiance of the Higher Self, the Holy Guardian Angel to whose Knowledge and Conversation he so ardently aspires. Whenever that lamp is shining, illuminating the magical work, that operation bears the immortal seal of legitimacy and the abiding sanction and approval, as it were, of the Holy Ghost. Moreover, the oil which this lamp consumes is olive oil, sacred to Minerva, the goddess of Wisdom. Those weapons, the so-called elemental weapons, are arrayed on the top of the Altar prior to the operation. These consist of the Wand, the Sword or Dagger, the Cup and the Pentacle, representing the letters of Tetragrammaton, and the four elements from which the whole gamut of heterogeneity in the cosmos has been built. To the element Fire is attributed the Wand ; the Cup is Water, while to Air is allocated the Sword, and the Pentacle symbolizes the fixedness and inertia of earth. There is no weapon to represent the fifth and crowning element of Spirit or Akasa ; for that is invisible, and its tattvic colour is black or indigo. There is a series of correspondences which may prove of interest to the Magician. Each of the Gods is characterized by some particu- lar weapon or symbol which expresses more clearly and perfectly than anything else his essential nature. Thus when the Magician flourishes the Wand it is to be conceived that he takes upon himself the authority and wisdom of Tahuti before the council of the cosmic Gods. When with the sceptre he announces his relationship with Maat, the Lady of Truth and Sovereignty ; while the flail or scourge denotes his authority and self-sacrifice and connects him at once with Osiris. The Wand is the Will, representing the wisdom and spiritual presence of the creative s-If, the Chialz, and it should be upright and mighty, a worthy figure of his divine force. Passive and receptive, the Cup or Chalice is a true symbol of his fieschamah, the intuition and understanding which is ever open awaiting the supernal dew which daily descends, according to Thc Book of Splendoz~r, from the highest regions for the pure of soul. In ceremonial, the Cup is used but rarely, and then only in the highest invocations, to bear the libations ; in evocations it plays no part at all.

By this symbol is understood the Ruach, or the mind, which, when without training, is volatile and in a state of constant motion, without stability or easy concentration. Since it is a cutting instrument, one used for analysis and dissection, banishing in cere- monial magic is its prime function, and it should never be employed at all in works having as their climax the invocation of the highest. Round, inert, and constructed of wax, a fitting symbol of the earth, plastic and awaiting cultivation by intelligence, the Pentacle is a token of the body, the Temple of the Holy Ghost, about to receive through the theurgic and telestic rites the influx of the divine spirit. A Pentacle, according to Levi, is a synthetic character resuming the whole magical dogma in one of its special phases. It is thus the real expression of a complete thought and act of will ; it is the signature of a mind. The Triangle of Art wherein the evoked spirit is conjured into visible appearance is, in itself, a perfect philosophic symbol of mani- festation. Representing the first cosmic manifestations or the three major Sephiros of the Supernal Worlds, the Triangle is the ideal representation of generation, of the manifestation into tangible coherent existence of that which formerly was thought, invisible, and metaphysical. Just as the first triad represents the first com- plete manifestation from the Circle of Ain Soph, so in Magic does the Triangle stand for the calling forth into daylight of the powers of the dark and the night. \"There are three which give testimony on earth,\" and those three are the points of the Triangle, bounded by the three great names of God. From the Circle of consciousness, which is the Magician's universe, a partitive and special idea is called forth into manifestation within the Triangle. The robe worn by the Theurgist represents his inner concealed glory. As in Buddhism, the yellow robe worn by the Bhikkhu symbolizes the golden splendour of his inner solar body, made glorious through the awakening of the higher powers, so is the robe to the Magician. The colour of this robe will differ with the type of Operation, red for Martial work, blue for Jupiterian work, and yellow or gold for Solar operations. The other symbols which are utilized in Magic may now be worked out with ease by the reader. Concerning the Wand, although many Magi including Abramelin advise that it should be a fairly long instrument, Eliphas Levi"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 117 remarks that it should not exceed the length of the Operator's arm, and that it should be made of almond or hazel wood, a single length of the finest steel wire running through its centre from end to end. Some Magicians place symbols on the apex of this baculum. An Ibis head occasionally employed is referred to Tahuti, the Lord of Wisdom and the patron of Magic. One of the finest symbols for a Wand is a triune prong of gold, representing the Hebrew letter Shin, whose significance is that of the Holy Spirit of the Gods. Yet another is the Lotus, which surmounting the Wand, indicates the regeneration and rebirth which the Magician seeks to accomplish. In this case, the shaft is painted in two colours, the lower part black and the upper part white. Very similar in implication to the Lotus Wand is that crowned by a Phcenix, the symbol also of regeneration through fire. Since the Wand is the symbol of the Creative Will, its construction should be accompanied by a distinct exertion of that Will, and in this idea is the rationale of many of the apparently absurd and far-fetched injunctions given by Theurgists in connection with the acquisition of suitable magical weapons. On the surface, and at first sight, it may seem as though the commo- tion attending the instruments is gross exaggeration, and exceedingly child-like. But if this opinion is countenanced then tlie essential underlying idea of these directions will have been overlooked. Were Levi's advice to be followed, for instance, in connection with the Wand, then that instrument should be fashioned from a perfectly straight branch of the almond or hazel tree, cut without hacking or boggling with a single blow from the tree with a sharp knife before the sun rises, and at the season when the tree is about to blossom. It should be subjected to a meticulous process of preparation, stripping the branch of leaves and twigs, removing the bark, and neatly trimming the ends and smoothing down the knots, followed by various other significant processes which can be ascertained by consulting Travtscende~zfal Magic. Underlying all these processes is the development of the Will. And the Magician who has troubled himself to the extent of rising two or three times at midnight on behalf of his Wand and denied himself rest and sleep, will, by the very fact of his self-denial, have benefited considerable in Will. In such an instance, the Wand actually will be a dynamic symbol of the creative Will, and it is such syinbols and instruments as this which in Magic are required. \" The peasant who each morning rises at two or three o'clock and goes far from home to gather a A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE sprig of the same herb before the sun rises may perform innumerable prodigies by simply carrying this herb about him, for it will become all he wants it to be in the interests of his desires.\"l Similar processes to those mentioned above in the instance of the Wand should be the accompaniment to the construction of the other elemental weapons, inasmuch as they must be the visibIe embodiment of the BIagician's own condition of soul and mind, without which they fail of effect as thaumaturgic symbols. If the Magician's mind, for instance, be not sharp and analytic, and if this quality of mind be not contributed to the making of the sword, how should the elemental spirits and dog-faced demons obey his commands to get themselves gone from the circle of invocation ? The chalice. too. as the svmbol of the Intuition as well as of the divine magin nation, must iikewise be fashioned in such a way and attended by high thoughts and great deeds as to embody some intuitional idea, either bearing on the exterior a design or word of supreme significance, or exemplifying by the shape of the Cup alone a divine idea. To each reader must it be left to decide in what way the other instruments will bear the stamp of the spiritual faculty or principle which they are intended to represent. 3 Reference frequently having been made to the fact that the two faculties which are mainly utilized in Magic are Will and Imagination, a few pages must be devoted to their consideration, giving the opinions of Theurgists together with a few useful sugges- tions. One of the highest powers we have, a power marvellously creative beyond description or expression, is Imagination. It is, postulates Iamblichus, \" superior to all nature and generation, and through which we are capable of being united to the Gods, of transcending the mundane order, and of participating eternal life, and the energy of the supercelestial Gods. Through this principle, therefore, we are able to liberate ourselves from fate.\" Now this faculty is conceived by most people to be identical with fantasy and with day-dreaming, and any definite coherent value it may have is denied. A greater mistake could hardly be made. As the word itself goes to show it is an image-making faculty, an image-creating power which when developed may prove of the utmost importance as assisting the soul in its forward journey. The sceptical philosopher 1 Tvanscendental Magic. Eliphas Levi."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE Hume speaks of it as a kind of magical faculty in the soul which is always most perfect in the genius, and is properly what we may call the geniusitself. Even themetaphysician Immanuel Kant, the inventor of the heavy and sometimes creaking intellectual d priovi machinery, believed that the understanding may be spoken of as simply imagina- tion which has attained to a consciousness of its own activities. I\\Iagicproposes an accelerated soul-development by means of an inten- sive culture, in which imagination plays an important part. It is a travesty, therefore, and a cause for no little regret, when one con- siders how little is this faculty utilized, and how rarely do most people bring it into activity in the course of everyday life. Yet, in reality, without it, and the variegated aspects of wonder and new- ness which it gives to our activities in every field of endeavour, cramped and restricted though it be by sense and mind, nothing enduring and of actuality could be done. Not only does the poet, the artist, the musician, the mathematician, and the inventor continually testify to and sing of its greatness, inasmuch as the accomplishments of all are due to its abiding mystery, but likewise the business magnate, the organizer and the statesman must use this faculty if success is to come his way. More than half the rich, colou~ful savour of life is lost to the unimaginative man, while those who are fortunate or wise enough to utilize it most actively reap the keenest pleasure possible to man. The finest example of creative imagination is one that is con- stantly parading in eloquent pageant before om eyes-the play of little children. A few bits of stick and string, a couple of stones, a little mud and a puddle of water will supply the normal healthy boy with all the crude material from which he will construct in his own mind an awe-inspiring navy of dreadnoughts and battleships, together with a magnificent harbour for them. The most unsiglltly doll is, for the little girl, usually the favourite and the most beautiful, for somehow the \" ugly duckling \" seems to give more scope for the imagination of the child ; the finely-dressed one with moveable eyes, flaxen hair, and rosy cheeks actually destroying the keen edge of the active and vivid imagination. By watching children at play one perceives with how few properties they can build up a whole drama and a moving tragedy as well.

Why it is that a painter can see in a mournful tramp a character study for a great picture is likewise attributable to the same cause-the mystery of the imagination. How can we explain the mystery of this individual creative power, which, leaping upon us as it were, becomes the master of images and words ? Taking control of these from the reasoning mind, it gives them symbolic and deeper meanings, until images, ideas and words, swept together and reassembled, become an organism by some transcendental formative power superior to all reason. It is as mysterious actually as the growth of an organism in nature ; no less wonderful than the plant which draws from earth by some occult power the essences it transmutes and then makes subservient to itself. In past centuries, in the arduous intellectual quest to ascertain the fundamental root of existence, philosophers were wont to lay down as law that existence is grounded in Reason and Thought- that is, when they were not material monists, claiming that matter is the one reality. Now the magical view, as has heretofore been laid down, is that it is neither reason nor thought which lies at the root of things, for thought is simply an aspect of the cosmos itself. It is an unnameable spiritual essence which is not mind but the cause of mind ; not spirit but the cause that spirit exists ; not matter but the cause to which matter owes its being. To explain the unbridge- able gulf between Reason and the concrete universe was a severe exercise for the philosophical mind. The main idealistic position was that just as in Logic the conclusion follows hard upon the footsteps of the premise, so also is the universe the logical outcome of the Absolute Reason and its development follows the deduction of rational categories of thought. In recent years, however, one philosopher named Fawcett was gifted with a stroke of supreme genius, when it occurred to him that the process by which the universe evolved and came into being was an imaginative creative process, and that Imagination, not Absolute Reason or even an instinctual Will ever rushing into manifestation, was the key to the solution of the perplexing philosophic problem. This imagination he defines as the plastic, creative, psychical stuff in which all human activities and faculties have their being. I do not wish to place myself on record as being in strict accord with all of Fawcett's conclusions, inasmuch as my own views are those of the Qabalah and are elsewhere laid down at some length. But it is wbrth noting"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE that this idea seems partly in agreement with that of the Theurgists. They postulated Ideation as the first manifestation, that by its activities was the universe brought into being. Nevertheless it is obvious that not Thought or Reason as we know it was implied, but a more abstract creative faculty allied in some way to Imagination. Reason is to the Imagination as matter is to form. as the instrument u is to the agent, as the body is to the ruling spirit, and as a shadow is to its reflecting substance. It is this power in man which Blavatsky calls Kriyasakti, defined in Tlze Secret Doctri+ze as \" the mysterious power of thought which enables it to produce external, perceptible, phenomenal results by its own inherent energy,\" and as such it would also appear to be closely connected with the Will. Rituals and ceremonies now regarded simply as a waste of time by those who know not how to conduct them, and condemned as procuring no real effect, had a most potent reaction when the symbolism of each action of the ceremony was fully recognized and understood, and when the Imagination was extended and the Will firmly concentrated on the object to be accomplished. The whole human ego, being in a state of theurgic excitation, the higher Self or a Universal Essence descended upon or elevated the ego, which thus became a luminous vehicle of a supra-human power. What we call so casually the Imagination in the ordinary man is, according to the Theurgists of all time, the inherent faculty of the soul to assimilate the images and reflections of the divine Astral, and Eliphas Levi volunteers the suggestion that by itself, and with the aid of its diaphane or the imagination, the Soul can perceive without the mediation of the corporeal organs those objects, whether spiritual or physical, which exist in the universe. In other words, the imagination is the vision of the soul whereby it perceives directly and immediately ideas and thoughts of every kind. Thus also, clairvoyance is seen to be an extension of the power of the Imagi- nation. Admitting as we do Levi's claim that Will and the Imagination are those creative faculties brought to bear upon natural forces during the ceremonies of Theurgy, the question may arise in the mind of the reader \" What if one's faculties are only average ? What if there is a poverty of spiritual creativity ? If these powers are not particularly potent and capable of magical formulation, may they be developed and strengthened ? \" The answer is definitely in the affirmative, for without a doubt they may.

He who is dead in the spirit may so re- fashion himself and reshape his energies as to possess a most puissant faculty of creation and genius. With two methods shall I deal here, that holding prominence among the Hindus and that practised by some Christians ; the Egyptian method being one which I have delineated and explained on a later page under another title. Al- though holding no brief for Catholicism with its luminary Jesuitism, nevertheless there is a remarkable book, indispensable and invaluable to the student, written by a Jesuit Mystic, St. Ignatius of Loyola. Outlined in this slight volume is a most extraordinary system of training, having particular reference to the imagination. Extra- ordinary, that is, when followed for its own sake, divorced from all dogma and Catholic theology. It is, of course, Christian in intent, with symbols of sectarian appeal to Catholics. With a little dis- crimination, however, the heart of this method may easily be separ- ated from the doctrinal chaff of dogma. It was by this experimental method that St. Ignatius became the man of towering genius that he was ; a man who earned the reputation of being, according to Professor William James, one of the most powerful engines of human organization and consrruction ever seen on the face of the earth. In this book, The Spiritz~al Exercises, Loyola counsels his disciples to re-live in the sphere of the imagination all the events in the outward historic life of their Master, Jesus Christ. By this method they are to force their imaginations to see, touch, smell and taste those invisible things, and rehearse those incidents long since accomplished and vanished, which were perceived through the senses or' their incarnated Lord. St. Ignatius desires the imagination to be exalted to its uttermost. If you are meditating on an article of faith, he would have you construct the locality clearly and with exactitude before the vision of the mind's eye, to observe it carefully and closely, even to touch it as it were. If it be hell, he gives you burning rocks to handle ; he makes you float in a frightful darkness as thick as pitch ; he places liquid sulphur upon your tongue. Your nostrils are filled with an abominable stench as of hell itself, and he shows you terrible torments, causing you to hear excruciating groans. He would have you construct the vision of Calvary with the glorified Christ, crowned with thorns, on the Cross, accomplishing the redemption of mankind, surveying the heavens with painful eyes,"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 123 while calling upon His Father in Heaven. He would have you envisage the startling wonder of the resurrection and the miracles performed long ago in Palestine-all this St. Ignatius bids your will to create in imagination by constant exercise. Franz Hartman wiote some years ago, on this same subject, that \"the exercises prescribed by Loyola are calculated to develop the powers of the soul, especially the imagination and will. The disciple has to concentrate his mind upon the accounts given in the Bible of the birth, suffering and death of Jesus of Nazareth, as if these were actual historical facts. He thus regards them, as it were, as a mental spectator, but by gradually working upon his imagination he becomes, so to say, a participator of it ; his feelings and emotions are raised up to a state of higher vibrations ; he becomes himself the actor in the play, experiencing himself the joys and sufferings of Christ, as if he were the Christ Himself ; and this identification with the object of his imagination may be carried to such an extent that even stigmata, or bleeding wounds corresponding to those on the body of the crucified Christ, will appear on his own body.\" Now although the Theurgist need not carry the practice so far as to produce the effects of which Hartman speaks, yet without doubt the method is an infallible one for stimulating that creative faculty in which one is deficient. Perseverance and continual application will assuredly bestow upon the student a will which is indomitable, a mind capable of prolonged concentration, and above all an imagi- nation which is the apotheosis of creativeness. Should he not approve of the religious import which the Saint makes of these exercises-and should he evince a profound disapproval of Catholic dogma and theology-then let the student use his own imagination to construct his own exercises which will be more favourable and suited to his individual temperament. Let him picture to himself that he is sitting by a mighty waterfall, a Niagara, and before his inner eye let him create an image of the river high up in its source, murmuring and rambling peacefully along. Then let him conceive of its gradual approach tothe precipice, wild torrents of maddened waters, swirling hither and thither in churning cascades of whitened foam, tumbling against the rocky boulders, and being irresistibly hurled forward over the edge. Let him further imagine these tons, thousands of tons of water, surging headlong over the precipice with the constant reverberating echo of thunder. Conceive, then, the spray being shot out in all directions, the beauty of the snowy A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE surf refracting the sunlight into iridescent rainbows, full of brilliant colour and hue. And let him hear, and upon hearing marvel, at the deep thunderous voice of the terrific impact of their volume against the lower rocks and waters. The student may also construct in imagination more familiar things : the noise of a speeding train, the taste of chocolate in his mouth, the smells of sweet perfumes and fragrant penetrative incenses, and the touch of burning coal. Not only must the imaginative formulation of the sense be distinct, that is, the taste of chocolate and not of sweet caramels for instance should be clearly imagined, but also the Magician should so train himself as to sustain the image or impression. By these stimulations of the imagination, its power will germinate and grow, developing beyond conception, and with the passing of time a new power of spiritual construction and vision will come to him. Similarly, the Hindus prescribe meditation for much the same purpose on the Tattvas or the coloured symbols of the elements, of which they claim five. Combinations of these five produce thirty elements and sub-elements, the pictorial symbols of which make remarkably good objects for the exercise of the imagination. There is a red equilateral triangle, Tejas; Apas, a horizontal silver crescent ; Vayu, a blue circle ; a yellow square being Prithivi, and a black egg for Akasa. The combinations of any two symbols, such as a red triangle surmounting a silver crescent, or a small blue circle placed centrewise in a yellow square, seem in a most singular way to stand out from the dark background of the inner vision and to stimulate all the powers of the imagination. But a short time suffices to pro- cure efficiency in the visualizing of these symbols. So that when the Operator approaches the more important tasks of practical Magic, such as formulating the Body of Light or the Mayavi-rupa, and constructing in imagination the symbolic masks or forms of the Gods, he will find that within him is a mighty creative force which will serve him in good stead. All such training as the exercises of St. Ignatius or the tattva symbols is never wasted and never ap- proaches futility, inasmuch as the training bestowed is the foundation of all Theurgical work, without which very little of permanence and significance can be accomplished. We agree with the French Magus, in so far as his remarks regarding the imagination are concerned, that it is the greatest magician in t5e universe.

It is the crystalline lens of the creative self, this power being that which works miracles, healing the sick, bringing succour to the weak, and for the benefit of men generally bestows the revelations of the spirit.

Judge makes the statement that the ancient Hindu Sages knew the secret of the development of the Will, and how to increase tenfold both its potency and efficacy. This secret of the ages, the enhancing of the power of Will and Wisdom, has never been lost. Will to the student of the divine Theurgy is the primary factor in the production of whatever spiritual changes he proposes, and consequently anything which tends to increase that potential and to arouse its latent possibilities, to transform it into an absolute irresistible force capable of being consciously manipulated, is in the nature of a transcendental benediction. The Will is neither good nor bad ; it is power only, and vitalizes all things alike. There are various suggestions proposed by Levi in his Transcendental Magic, a few of which are as follows : \" If you would reign over yourselves and others, learn how to will. . . . How can we learn to will ? . . . Observances which are apparently the most insignificant, and in themselves foreign to the end which they propose, conduce to that end notwithstanding, through education and the exercise of will. . . . Man can be changed by habit which, according to the proverb, becomes his second nature. By means of persevering and graduated athletic exercises, the energies and agility of the body are developed or created in an astonishing degree. It is the same with the soul's powers.\" The essence of his suggestions, which cannot strike one as being anything but sensible, amounts to this. By means of a consciously imposed asceticism, by denying oneself while in training certain things normally considered necessary, to learn in short the art of self-conquest and how to live, is to set oneself free from the vicissitudes of the eternal flux and reflux which is life, and obtain a highly trained will. It is imperative that the words \" self-imposed asceticism \" be noted, and that they precede the phrase \" while in training \" ; this is highly important as the opening key to the Gates of Will. Before elaborating this statement it is worth reflection on 126"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 127 how it can be termed \" self-dcnial \" wliich denies only the +tot-self of the things for which it craves, in order to open that blind darkness to the light of the True Will, the Inner Vision and the Real Self, The latter is denied nothing at all. It is only the desires of the Ruaclz, that entity whose egoism changes with the passing of each hour, which is denied and disciplined that it may become a useful instrument through which the Holy Guardian Angel and its Peers may work without restriction and useless delays. The noteworthy factor in this connection is that the vow of asceticism must be kept in its proper place. For a well-defined purpose, and a clearly understood one, beyond which it should never be permitted to stray, should this vow be taken. With wandering all is lost. When the vow does go beyond the confines of premeditated intention, then asceticism like extreme voluptuous- ness is an inordinate vice, one pertaining to the subtle tendencies of the ego, and hence definitely to be discouraged and obliterated. There are critics who claim that asceticism is a form of selfishness and egoism. When these strictures are pointed only at those who abuse it, those who would have their denials and their flagrantly advertised scourgings considered as supreme virtues and who derive much pleasure when their vice is acclaimed in public, the accusation is correct. But not otherwise. Now let it be understood that asceticism is neither a vice nor virtue, just as Will itself is neither good nor bad. It possesses in itself no merit of any kind other than being a matter of convenience to whomsoever embraces it for the purpose of training. Just as in the training of a boxer, for example, such luxuries as drinking and smoking are scrupulously removed from the list of his indulgences, denials in which obviously there can be imputed no moral virtue, so also is the asceticism which the Theurgist takes upon himself. The asceticism of which Magic speaks, and to which Levi refers, is an entirely different matter from the ordinary egotis- tical vice, inasmuch as it has for its objective precisely the strengthen- of the Will and the mystical abnegation of that ego. It is that false ego to which the egoist and the would-be ascetic in name only clings so devotedly, though to his eternal detriment, and which the Magician seelis to offer in sacrifice so that the Holy Ghost descending upon the Altar in shooting tongues of fire may consume the offering and live in him for ever. Referring to the Mysteries of old time, Levi observes that the more terrible and dangerous that they were, the more severe the A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"128 THE TREE OF LIFE rigours they imposed, the greater was their efficacy. Thus it is with this asceticism. The greater the denials of the personality, the more luxurious necessities are removed from the customary mode of life, the greater the acquisition of Will-power, and the more easy does it become to destroy the egoic bonds. Yet the asceticism must not be so terrible as to damage the instruments with which the Magician is obliged to work. The astronomer does not destroy his telescope in a fit of blind rage. To cut one's throat to spite one's brain is a folly, and is completely unintelligent. If the aspirant is prone to indulge in absurdities of this type, it were better for him to refrain from Magic altogether, and stay by the warmth and quiet of his parlour fireside. An extremely efficient technique has been evolved by a con- temporary Magician ; a most practical system free from a11 the unpleasant implications and moral tendencies of the older systems. According to this system,l the technique is so arranged as to cover the whole field of human action, speech and thought, and thus is applicable to the entire constitution of man. At base, it is in agree- ment with the general conception of asceticism that a certain action, word or thought, which has become habitual and a part of the Ruach, should be denied one. Such as, for example, vowing for a provisional period of, say, a week, to refrain from crossing the legs over the knee when sitting down, or perhaps forming the decision not to raise the left hand to head or face. The great advantage of this system is that there is no moral bias in these suggestions. It is not virtuous to refrain from crossing the knees or not touching the face with the left hand. Thus the Operator is delivered from the tendency of making a foolish virtue of his asceticism. It is necessary to observe, too, that there is no suggestion to apply the ascetic principle in this scheme to what is commonly termed a bad habit, such as smoking, drinking, or swearing. To do so would be to invite certain individuals to regard their abstinence from smoking or drinking as a virtue, to be highly commended, instead of realizing that the denial is simply a matter of convenience and training, a personal idiosyncrasy to which neither credit nor blame can be attached. A completely impersonal attitude of detachment should be maintained, and the application of the scheme is necessary to those actions, words, and thoughts to which it is altogether im- possible to attribute a moral worth.

This attitude, a supreme essential, should be cultivated in every branch of Magic. Now for every violation of this oath to refrain from a certain course of action, a certain punishment should be inflicted. It is in this discipline that Will derives its training and strength. For instance, assume the Operator to have taken a magical oath to refrain for a period of forty-eight hours from crossing the right knee over his left leg when seated. During a moment of forget- fulness, it may be that the Magician performs the proscribed deed. That violation should be punished, so as to make a deep and lasting impression on the mind, by cutting the arm with a razor. The forbidden action is thus engraved on the forearm with a sharp slash to assist the slack memory. In the second section concerning speech, some word frequently employed in everyday parlance such as \" I \" or \" and \" or any other expression which is common to the usual speech of the Magician is to be proscribed for a period of several days, a week, or months as the case may be. During this time, the word is either completely omitted, or some other word is in its place substituted. A certain thought which is impersonal and free from moral bias, is the subject of the last section, when one has become sufficiently proficient in, and having derived benefit from, the previous two sections. In every case of forgetfulness the effraction and penalty is a sharp cut on the arm. This latter section has very far-reaching extensions, particularly as regards the training of the mind. If some thoughts have been forbidden entry through the unguarded gates of the mind, and some skill has been obtained in enforcing this decision, it will require a little further extension of the practice to close the gates, and bar all thoughts of whatsoever kind from the mind. In this way one achieves the identical object of Yoga ; the emptying at will of all content from the mind. Now as to the result of this disciplinary technique. First of all, no arbitrary question of ethics or morals enters into this technique of asceticism ; it is simply an elaborated species of athletic training, as it were. The body is not tortured, on the common principle and according to usual custom, that the eternal soul may live and find bliss in its release from the body.

The root principle involved in the practice of fakirs who sleep on nail or wire beds, holding their arms upright for the full span of their lives, tearing living flesh from long-suffering bodies, all this is reprehensible to the Theurgist, and is altogether opposed in principle to the method outlined above. The body is not a thing of evil, for we have previously defined corporeality and spirituality as different degrees of one divine substance. All the vehicles of the spirit are instruments through which it may act, obtain experience, and arrive at a know- ledge of itself ; and though in matters pertaining to celestial com- munion some are bound to be a hindrance if untrained, the observa- tion simply proves the necessity for training, not for this cruel and senseless destruction. By the ascetic technique of Theurgy, one simply decides to obtain a conscious control over certain aspects of one's physical and mental organization, and this control tends to the acquisition of a greatly increased potential of Will. The cutting of the arm does cause some little pain, it is true ; though this pain is useful and necessary as setting up certain currents in the inhibitory centres of the brain or mind. Thcse result in the establishment of a curious vigilance on the part of the Will, a free unconscious flow of Will-force being ever-present and ready to execute the wishes of the Master. One will discover, in the event of a decision talten not to cross the legs, that when chatting in casual conversation with a group of people and in a state of utter forgetfulness of the oath, any automatic tendency of the legs to repeat instinctively the habit to which they have long become accustomed will immediately be detected by the Will before the proscribed act is even half-way completed, and the tendency will be stopped in its inception. It has been noticed again and again that just as the legs are about to cross, even during the deepest sleep when the body makes spasmodic automatic motions, the Will operating from the inhibitory centres of the mind causes a spontaneous warning to be flashed, with the result that the action is prevented. If asleep, there is an immediate awakening with full consciousness of the intended act. At least, this is the rationale obtaining after the Operator has failed about a dozen times or so, and when his forearm has become beautifully adorned by as many cuts. It is particularly so in the case of the prohibition of the word \" I \" which one may well use as the object of the practice. A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE Normally, we are so personal, and so attached to all things egoic that in ordinary conversation we are more eager to talk about ourselves, and the phrases \" I did this,\" and \" I did that \" enter more fully into speech than almost any other. Hence in the beginning, when the benefits of judicious silence are very forcibly conveyed to the personality, the arm suffers in no little way. It may even be neces- sary to resort to the decoration of both forearms before the rebellious ego and its voice respond to training, deciding to obey forthwith the dictates of the \\Vill. The conscquence is obvious. As time progresses through this technique the Magician accomplishes two separate things, both of them being major aspects of tlle Great Work. A perpetual vigilance approximating to a most powerful current of \\\\'ill-power has been generated. This, from the beginning, tends to bring the nlultifarious activities of the human being under conscious control of the Will. If, as tlie Abbk Constante so accurately observed, magical opera- 'tions are the exercise of a power which though natural is superior to the common forces of nature, that power being the result of a knowledge and a discipline exalting the will beyond its normal limits, then this practice fulfils in the most conceivable way all the requirements that even he would have demanded of it. And the advantage of this to the Keophyte who has sworn himself to the attainment of no less than the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy One, the Angel that guardeth him, cannot be overestimated. In his hancls is placed a tremendous power of Will, spiritual in its significance, inconceivably crea- tive in its application. The second aspcct of accomplishment is that not only does the Magician find himself in possession of an enhanced il'ill, but that the Rzlnch itself, all the faculties comprised in the ego previously so troublesome and lacking in concentration, has gradually, because of the dynamic Will and the shrinking from bodily pain, placed itself under control. The Practitioner will have survived the pre- liminary horror and dislilie of inflicting this slight penalty upon his arm, seeing his body for the first time in its proper place, as a servant to be used and commanded, and whose rebellious refusals to obey orders issuing fro111 a higher source are sternly to be repri- manded and penalized.

So powerful a force can this Will become under discipline and training that in the directions appended to a recent version of an Invocation, the editor has suggested that the Will should be formulated in the Creative World in the shape of a magical wand, its true symbol, or a beam of light issuing in a straight and upright line from the Magician towards and into Infinity. This remark suggests that far from being an intangible metaphysical impalpa- bility, an incoherency which is usually the case with the average individual, to the Magician the Will is a definite controllable spiritual force, which like all the other faculties of the soul, may be employed -. by its overlord and master. There is yet another method of training the Will. Though it belongs rightfully to the processes of Yoga its importance cannot be overestimated. It is that branch of the eight-limbed Yoga which is called Pranayama, a practice yielding to whomsoever pursues it a threefold harvest. First, the intaking of large quantities of oxygen and prana has an unmistakable effect on the endocrine glands. It is indubitable that the interstitial glands particularly receive a tremendous stimulus. As a con- sequence, from a purely physical point of view, the entire personality is flooded with a wealth of creative energy bound to react favourably, when conserved, on the mind and Will and every other aspect of the human constitution. In fact, one may go so far as to state that this creative energy, physical though-it-may seem, goes to form the basis of the spiritual vision. Secondly, in his Raja Yoga the late Swami Vivekananda provides an admirable explanation of the effect of regulated rhythmic breathing, which strengthens and stimulates the Will into a most formidable con- centration of power. Briefly, his theory is that by making all the cells in one's being vibrate in unison, a powerful electric current of Will is established in the body and mind. And the means for establishing this unison of vibration is a rhythmic intaking and exhalation of the breath. Ignoring, for the purpose of argument, the theory that Pranayama does have any such effect as is outlined in the former paragraph, and barring all mystical theory from consideration, there is yet another result which can be doubted by none. Any individual who has attempted Pranayama steadily for even a few moments A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE will understand at once what is meant. Anything more tedious and laborious and heart-breaking than this simple set of exercises could hardly be imagincd. For the Magician to seat himself quietly for two or three hours during the course of each day for a period of say three or four months, making the attempt to breathe in a measured regulated rhythm, simply observing carefully the inhala- tion and exhalation of the flow of breath, is one of the most arduous tasks of which thc human imagination can conceive. It calls for the exertion of the utmost will-power, and the gritting most firmly of the teeth in the determination to continue. In doing this, the individual is brought sharply to face the inertia and lassitude of the body, requiring no little austerity and self-conquest and adamant will-power to persist in that appointed task to which he has vowed himself. If the Practitioner obtained no technical book-described result whatsoever, such as the slowing of the motion of the mind or the occurrence of various psycho-physiological changes, he will at least have gained an immeasurable increase in will-power and indomitability of purpose in having trained himself to overcome the slothfulness of bodily circumstances and the mental inertia and opposition to training. \" To learn self-conquest is, therefore, to learn how to live, and the austerities of stoicism were no idle boast of liberty. . . . To resist and overcome nature is to achieve for oneself a personal and imperishable existence ; it is to set oneself free from the vicissitudes of life and death.\"l It is an acknowledged and demonstrable fact that the discipline and patience imposed by Pranayama, apart from all Yoga theory, will stand the Magician in good stead when the more complex and difficult tasks of Magic are forced upon him. There are some individuals on whom Magic falls as upon sterile ground. Believing that the conscious development of genius through magical training is an impossibility in nature, they claim that the greatest deeds and the finest creative works are done unconsciously and not at will ; that the noblest examples of art, literature and music receive their primary inspiration from a part of man which is independent of his conscious will and knowledge. This fact, without doubt, is true, and it is here that the Magician is superior to the ordinary artist. With the artist inspiration is automatic, independent of his own wishes and knowledge even, and in this sense he is a passive instrument, a medium. The Mysteries of Magic.

The ultimate objective is the identification of the magical Will with the whole being, so that its exertion demands no more conscious effort than the movement of the lips, the raising of the hand ; a force as constant and ever present as gravitation. Ceremonial Magic, let it be understood, as a means of acquiring the requisite potential of will-force, is principally of use for the beginner. \" Ceremonies being as we have said artificial methods for creating a habit of will, become unnecessary when the habit is confirmed. . . . But proceclure must be simplified progressively before it is dispensed with altogether.\"l If a schedule of practice is rigidly adhered to, the Magician will discard after a time the ceremonial altogether, relying upon impromptu work within tlie limits of his interior magical Circle, and still later apply himself exclusively to that magical practice called the Mass of the I-Ioly Ghost. The skilful application of this reverberating magical engine should result in the development of a high-powered centre of Will. With this achievement all techniques may bc discarded, for having served their purpose in improving the welfare of the individual, no longer are exercises required. The principle is comparable to one recognized in sport. During a game of tennis, for example, a player might produce some really wonderful lobs and volleys in a minute fraction of a second when conscious decision would be quite out of the question. The best shots in billiards, as many well know, are those accidentally made. For the aspirant to tennis, or a player desirous of improving, only a vast amount of delibevate practice will produce that consummate skill which will operate freely at all times. So it is with the Magician. In such a one, the verendurn of art which was jealously hidden from public gaze, is even more secreted in the depths of his spiritual consciousness, so that by no one in the whole world is its existence divined. So powerfully strong is this wand that by one flick could the worlds be destroyed ; with another flourish, could new worlds be brought into being. 1 Transcenderilal Magic. Eliphas Levi.

To officiate at magical ceremonies, conducting each minute detail with care, performing the external banishings and suffumigations and circumambulations, bellowing sonorously the conjurations and moaning the barbarous names of evocation, is no real criterion that the invocation will succeed in its ostensible purpose, or that the ecstatic climax of the operation will \" come off.\" The failure to realize this lies at the bottom of a good many rathcr humorous stories about Magic told by people who, having bccome intellectually interested in its technique, and having followed carefully the instructions laid down in the ordinary easily obtainable grimoires, have been disappointed with the paucity of result.

Some members of a famous research society were confirmed in the belief that it was high time to expose Magic in all its branches, to show that it possessed no reality at all ; and with this very worthy aim, they made arrange- ments to conduct a ceremony, based on the garbled instructions in some grimoire, on the top of a hill on the Continent. The con- jurations were duly recited in accordance with said instructions by a white-robed virginal maid over a goat, which the grimoire promised would be transformed into a youth of most ravishing beauty. This transformation, naturally, failed to occur, and a great deal of publicity was given to this ceremony which was to put an end to all ceremonies.

I do not believe this farcical ceremony requires much comment. It exposes the extraordinary kind of intelligence which cannot distinguish between a silly book on witchcraft and the genuine Telestic Magic ; also the inability to realize the truth of the fre- quently stated injunction that it is thought, will and intention which enter most prominently into ceremonial magical work, the exterior symbols and sigilla being secondary and less important. Barrett's Magzds would offer, in any event, to the consideration of these \" scientific \" researchers that \" the reason why exorcisms, charms, incantations, etc., do sometimes fail of their desired effect, it is because the unexcited mind or spirit of the exorcist renders the words dull or ineffectual.\" Here then in a short sentence is the secret of success.

Success implies above all enthusiasm. And the enthusiasm which the Magician should cultivate is an indescribable species of excitement or frenzy, by means of which he is carried completely outside of and beyond himself. It is an altogether incomprehensible quality, and hence indefinable. The Magician should inflame himself, and this is hislalzabus or self-intoxication, which the Qabalists conceived to be the very cup of grace, and the wine of life. Every nerve, every fibre of the individual-physical, astral, mental ; every atom in whatsoever department of man's constitution should be keyed up to fever pitch and all the faculties of the soul exalted to the uttermost. Just as the artist-the poet, the dancer, the lover even-is carried away in a madness of white- hot passion, a frenzy of creativity, so also must it be for the Mngician. He should be propelled in his ceremony by a mantic enthusiasm which, although in him and a necessary part of the forces which compose him, is by no means that which he normally includes in his Kuack. It has no part in the wake-a-day worldly ego, although it exalts this ego on a crest of bliss, so that all consciousness of its existence is transcended, suffering a new birth with a larger and a wider horizon. Affirms Iamblichus, \" the enthusiastic energy, however, is not the work either of body or the soul, or of both conjoined.\" It is impossible to lay down theorctical rules for the induction of this frenzy, for the acquisition of this stimulus, for the production of this mantic spasm. In different people various factors will enter to produce the stimulus and excitation.

As in the Rosicrucian legend, the life of thc yo111lg pelicans was sustained by the sacrificial resource of the mother, so the exterior forces of the Magician are fed, when the ego succumbs to the intoxication, both from the spirit within and its liege lord, the Gods from above invoked.

That sound, for instance, has a creative or formative power has long been recognized and known to most of mankind. The Hindu mantram and its effects uDon both brain and the nervous ramifica- tions of the body has beeithe repeated subject of no inconsiderable amount of scientific and lay experiment. A rational theory concerri- ing the sacred mantram is that its action in the brain may be likened to that of a swiftly revolving wheel through the spolies of which no object can pass. It is held that when the mantram is firmly established, and the brain has automatically taken up its licluid accents, all thoughts even that of the mantram are hurled off, and in the mind emptied of all content the mystical experience may ensue. There is another theory held by other occult schools which claims that the vibration set up by a mantram has a purifying effect on the whole constitution of man ; that by its vibratory action the coarser elements in the body are gradually expelled, a refining process taking place which affects not only the body of flesh and blood and brain and nerve, but including both the Body of Light and the entire mental structure within the scope of its action. In the admirable biography of Milarepa the Buddhist Yogi pub- lished by the Oxford University Press there is the following footnote : \" According to the hlantrayana school, there is associated with each object and element of nature . . . a particular rate of vibration. If this be known and formulated in a Mantra and used expertly by a perfected Yogi, such as Milarepa was, it is held to be capable of impelling the lesser deities and elementals to appear, and the superior deities to emit telepathically their divine influence in rays of grace.\" It is held in Magic that the vibration of certain god or divine- names conduces to the production of its psychological and spiritual phenomena. \" Why ? \" asks Blavatsky in her Secret Doctrine."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"140 THE TREE OF LIFE Answering her own question, she states \" Because the spoken word has a potency unknown to, unsuspected and disbelieved in, by the modern ' sages.' Because sound and rhythm are closely related to the four elements of the ancients ; and because such or another vibration in the air is sure to awaken corresponding powers, union with which produces good or bad results, as the case may be.\" The legend pertaining to the Hebrew Tetragrammaton is interest- ing. He who knows the correct pronunciation of YHVH, called the Slzem ha-Mephoresh, the Unpronounceable Name, possesses the means of destroying the universe, his own particular universe, and hurling that individual consciousness into Samadhi. Moreover, the magical theory has it that the vibration set up by the human voice has the power not only of moulding the plastic substance of the Astral Light into variegated shapes and forms depending upon the tone and volume, but also of compelling the attention of meta~hvsical entities and Essences to that mould. a d Quite easily the power of sound can be proved by means of a few trifling but most interesting experiments. The utterance of the monosyllable Om in a high shrill voice will be felt without a doubt to vibrate noticeably in both the throat and the chest. By repetition the ability to increase the potency or frequency of the vibrations and the area of its detonation can be very coqsiderably increased. With a certain amount of judicious practice, always with the exercise of intelligence, the practitioner will find himself enabled to vibrate a single word so as to make the whole body shudder and tremble beneath the impact of its power. On the other hand, practice will also enable the student to limit at will the vibra- tion to a certain area or locality in his body. Needless to say, a great deal of care should always be employed, for it is not required of this practice that the body should be shattered or torn asunder by catastrophic vibrations. There are well-known examples of the destructive power of sound caused by the detonation of thunder or the bursting of shells. There is the oft-repeated story, well worth mention here, of a trick played by a great singer. He would tap a wineglass with his finger-nail so that it rang ; then, picking up the note with his voice, he would sing the same note with his mouth right over the glass. After a moment, when his voice was vibrating in unison with the note emit- ted by the glass, he would suddenly change the note to a higher one, and the wineglass without the least warning would fall, shattered A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 141 into fragments. He was playing with the law of vibration, for all things, seen and unseen, come within its scope, and every conceivable object exists on a definite plane, possessing a different rate of vibra- tion. Every organic and inorganic mass is composed of a multitude of infinitely small centres of energy which, in order to adhere one to the other, must vibrate all together. The changing of that vibration either destroys the form, or brings about mutations and alterations in the shape. There being a destructive aspect to sound, it follows there is one of formation and creation, to be discovered through constant and patient experiment. The actual formative power may quite easily be demonstrated. Let the reader sprinkle a little fine sand on the sounding box of a violin, and without disturbing the sand, draw the bow lightly over one of the strings. It will be found that the vibra- tion exerts a formative influence, for, with the sounding of the note and its amplification in the sound-box, the sand arranges itself into curious geometrical shapes ; a square, on occasion, will be formed quite clearly ; or a triangle, an ellipse, or a design which is com- parable to the structure of a snowflake-crystalline and a thing of rare beauty. The same experiment may be performed over a sheet of glass, and depending on whether the bow is drawn slowly or rapidly against the edge, lightly or with much pressure, so will the shape of the sand be. On the violin a soft deep note will naturally produce a different sound shape to a long piercing wail ; brusqueness has a different shape-value to a slow vibrato. There is somewhere in the writings of Madame Blavatsky the testimony that she herself, at one time on the verge of death, was recalled to life and cured of her ills through the powers inhering in sound. All these things will go far to show that sound does possess a creative value, and it should be the aim of each would-be Magician by practice to ascertain what tone of voice is most suitable for magical work. Experience shows that a shrill humming of the names to be pronounced is the most satisfactory method, a voice which vibrates rather than clearly pronounces being that which is required. The vibration of God-names is hence an important essential in the practice of Magic, since, for one thing, the knowledge of the name of any being-and by knowledge is included the ability to vibrate and pronounce it correctly, as well as an understanding of its Qabalistic implications-is to possess a species of control over it. The knowledge of the name may be acquired by the application of"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"142 THE TREE OF LIFE Qabalistic principles, so that in the name may be found a summary of the forces and powers inhering therein. In a word is Magic con- tained, and a word properly pronounced is stronger, says Levi, than the powers of heaven, earth or hell. Nature is commanded with a name ; the kingdoms of Nature likewise are conquered, and the occult forces comprising the invisible universe are obedient to him who pronounces with understanding the incommunicable names. \" To pronounce these great names of the Kaballah, according to science, we must do so with full understanding, with a will unchecked by anything, with an activity which nothing can rebuff.\" The vibration of God-names, then, constitutes one of the most important divisions in a ceremonial invocation. The incenses, perfumes, colours, sigils and lights around the magical circle will assist in evoking the desired idea or spirit from the imagination and to manifest itself in an appropriate garb coherent and tangible to the exorcist. Not alone must there be intention and thought, but there should be the concrete expression of thought in an action or a word which, to the idea, must be as a logos. To illustrate the mode of vibration, let it be supposed that an exorcist is desirous of invoking the powers pertaining to the sphere of Gevurah. Its planct will be ascertained to be Mars ; its essential quality being one of cosmic energy and force, summarized in the divinity Horus, its archangel will be Icamael, its spirit Bartsbael, and the Sephirah to which these are attributed bears the divine Name Elohim Gibor. When, in the magical ceremony which the Theurgist instigates, the time arrives for the pronouncing of the divine name, let him inhale very deeply, slowly and forcefully. At the moment when the air from without strikes against the nostrils, the realization should be clearly imagined that the name of the God, Elohim Gibor, is being inhaled with the air. Picture the name borne aloft in great letters of fire and flame, and as the air slowly fills the lungs, the name should be imagined to permeate, and vibrate throughout the whole frame of the body, gradually descending through the thorax and the abdomen, down the thighs and legs to the feet. When the force appears to strike the lowest portion of the legs, expanding and spreading to every atom and cell in the foot-and practice will render this feat of iniagi- nation less difficult than it sounds-he should assume one of the characteristic poses of the god Horus shown in the vignettes of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. One of them, the Sign of the Enterer, consists of throwing the left foot forward and inclining the body A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE I43 to the front, both arms being first drawn up to the head and flung forward as though projectingthe magical force towards the Triangle of Evocation. As this sign is being assumed, while the lungs are exhaling the air charged with the name, the latter should be strongly imagined to rise swiftly from the feet, through the thighs and body, and so be forcibly hurled forth with a mighty sliout of triumph. If the whole body of the Magician feels aflame with force and energy, and thundering into his ears from every surrounding portion of space he hears the resounding echo of the name just magically vibrated, he may rest assured that the pronunciation has been correctly accomplished. The effect of the vibration of the God- names is to set up a strain in the upper astral light, in response to which the intelligence evoked hastens. Other gestures and other signs exist for each of the Gods, and a study of the Egyptian God- forms will confer a knowledge of what these signs are. Closely allied with the vibration of divine names, is another branch of Magic. In some rituals the student may have noticed numbers of incomprehensible words in a foreign or unknown tongue known technically as the \" barbarous names of evocation \" which, we are counselled by the Chaldaan Oracles, never to change, \" for they are names divine having in the sacred rites a power ineffable.\" originally all that was meant by the \" barbarous names \" was that these words were in the dialect of the Egyptians, Chaldaans and Assyrians, regarded as barbarians by the Greeks, and G. R. S. Mead renders the phrase as \" native names.\" Iamblichus, in answering Porphyry's enquiries on this point, states : \" Those who first learned the names of the Gods, having mingled them with their own proper tongue, delivered them to us, that we might always preserve im- moveable the sacred law of tradition, in a language peculiar and adapted to them. . . . Barbarous names likewise have much emphasis, great conciseness, and participate of less ambiguity, variety and multitude.\" Experience confirms that the most puissant invocations are those in which are words of a foreign, ancient, or perhaps forgotten tongue ; or even those couched in a degenerate, and it may be meaningless, jargon. The most outstand- ing quality of these conjurations is that the language used is always very vibrant and sonorous. That is their sole virtue, for they are peculiarly effective when recited with magical intonation, each syllable being carefully vibrated. For some reason or other it has been found that the recitation of these names is conducive to the"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"I44 THE TREE OF LIFE exaltation of the consciousnes~, exerting a subtle fascination on the mind of the Magician. \" The Magic of the ancient priests consisted in those days,\" thought Madame Blavatsky, \" in addressing their gods in their own language. . . . It is composed of sounds, not words ; of sounds, numbers and figures. He who knows how to blend the three, will call forth the response of the superintending Power. Thus this language is that of incantations or of Mantras as they are called in India, sound being the most potent and effectual magic agent, and the first of the keys which opens the door of communication between Mortals and Immortals.\" The rationale and explanation of the exaltation is not far removed from general experience. It is not unique, nor does it confine itself exclusively to ceremonial or Theurgical work. One very frequently reads of poets becoming entranced, as it were, by the repetition of rhythmic verse and names ; indeed many of the poems of Swin- burne are a splendid example of such poetry. One hears too of precocious children being singularly affected by those readings from the Bible in which occur long lists of weird Hebrew names and places. Thomas Burke, the eminent novelist, once informed the writer that when a young man the names of cities and countries in the South American continent were to him as magical spells almost of enchant- ment, occult in their power. Names such as Antofagasta, Tuerra del Fuego, ~ntanonoiiva, and Venezuela are indeed barbarous names to conjure with. I remember too reading at one time a poem by William J. Turner, the music critic, in which he recounts that as a boy, Mexican words and names exerted a fascinating charm : Popocatapetl, Quexapetl, and Chimborozo, and the like. The names themselves convey nothing to a fertile and developed imagination ; the exaltation of consciousness is due almost entirely to rhythm and its music, the witchery of the names entering into the realm of the imagination, where it is seized upon to arouse a peculiar frenzy or excitation. In any event little doubt can be entertained that the numbers of barbaric, formidable, and almost fearful- appearing words rolling and bellowing through so many of the better invocations which have come down from antiquity should have an exhilarating effect on the conscio~~sness, and exalt it to the pitch required in Magic. The \" Bornless \" Invocation, whose basic elements are found in some Gr~co-Egyptian fragments, and which will be found reprinted in my last chapter, is perhaps the most notable example. As a ritual it is considered by many to be one of A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 145 the best, and is replete with strange words rich in music and primitive excitations, sonorous to the utmost degree. Many of the rituals and invocations utilized by the Elizabethan astrologer, Dr. Dee, working in collaboration with his colleague Sir Edward Kelly, are also remarkably good specimens of such language. In fact, the rituals of Dee may be assumed to be unique ; they are written almost entirely, with the exception of a few Hebrew words, in a curious language called Angelic or Enochian, which he claims was dictated to him by the Angels. Regardless of their origin, the invocations couched in this language have been found to work with a peculiarity and a force found in no other language. Typical of the barbarous words, citations from several rituals may be given. The following is one from the Dee conjurations : \" Eca, zodocare, Iad, goho. Torzodu odo kikale qaa ! Zodacare od zodameranu ! Zodorje, lape zodiredo 01 Noco Mada, das Iadapiel ! Ilas ! hoatahe Iaida ! \" Occurring in Chapter CLXV of the Saite Kecension of the Book of the Dead, there is a petition to Amen-Ra, wherein the most powerful of the magical names of the God are recited : \" Hail thou Bekhennu, Bekhennu ! Hail Prince, Prince ! Hail, Amen. Hail, Amen I Hail Par, Hail Iukasa ! Hail God, Prince of the Gods of the eastern parts of Heaven, Amen-Nathekerethi-Amen. Hail thou whose skin is hidden, whose form is secret, thou lord of the two horns born of Nut, thy name is Na-ari-k, and Kasaika is thy name. Thy name is Arethi-kasatha-ka, and thy name is Amen-naiu-anka- entek-share or Thekshare-Amen Rerethi ! Hail ! Amen, and let me mike supplication unto thee for I know thy name. . . .

Thy name is Ba-ire-qai, thy name is Marqatha, thy name is Rerei, thy name is Nasa-qebu-bu, thy name is Thanasa-Thanasa ; thy name is Sharshathakatha.\" Another very fine example, perhaps one of the best, so far as the apparent unintelligibility of the names are concerned, occurs in the Harris Magical Papyrus, an English translation of which may be found in the Facsimiles of Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum. \" Adiro-Adisana !

Since the Magician is intent upon making his life comprehensible, and to interpret every incident therein as a dealing of God with his soul, that all things might tend towards his spiritual enlightenment, it may seem incon- gruous were he to contradict that decision by incorporating meaning- less and senseless words into his invocations. Above all things consistency and internal coherence typifies the mind of the Magician. Hence to neglect the exegetical principles of the Qabalah is to leave unguarded the channels through which chaos and inconsistency may invade the sanctum of cognition. Every barbarous word should be as carefully studied and understood with a degree of attention and erudition as one would bring to the analysis of Kant's Critik of Pure Reason ; the hidden significance being permitted to penetrate below the level of consciousness where, during the cere- mony, it may assist in the production of the requisite excitement. And to unearth the real spirit of the barbarous names a good working knowledge of the Qabalah cannot be dispensed with. For example, consider with me the word \" Assalonoi \" appearing in another section of the Grzco-Egyptian fragment. The first letter will suggest Harpocrates, the Lord of Silence, who is the l3abe in the Lotus and the Pure Fool of the Tarot ; the Innocent Parsifal who silently sets out in quest of the I-Ioly Grail. It is only he who, because of his worldly foolishness but his divine wisdom and innocence, may arrive unscathed at the end. \" S \" will be seen to have reference to that card of the Tarot depicting the Holy Guardian Angel who bears, on his breast, a sigil engraved with the letters of the Tetragrammaton. \" A1 \" may be interpreted as being the Hebrew word for \" God \" ; as also is \" On \" a Gnostic name.

Consider again, \" Phalarthao,\" which is a word in the same invocation. \" Phal \" is obviously an abbreviation for the phallus which, according to Jung, is the symbol of the creative faculties of a man. He defines it, in fact, as \" a being moving without limbs, seeing without eyes, and knows the future ; and as symbolic repre- sentative of the universal creative power, existent everywhere, immortality is indicated in it. It is a seer, an artist, and a worker of miracles.\" By subjecting the two letters \" ar \" to the Qabalistic process called Temurah, we have \" Ra \" the Sun God, shedding his bounty of sunlight and warmth and sustenance on all in the world of matter, and giving spiritual grace and illumination in the interior life. \" Th \" is Tes, the leonic serpent which is the essence of the physical life, giving substance to the spiritual vision. \" A \" again is the Thunderbolt of Thor, the magical forces of the Adept set in motion ; the \" 0 \" representing the mountain goat, and the creative fecund aspect of man's being. The word \" Adisana,\" which occurs very frequently in the list of barbarous names furnished by the Harris Magical Papyrus, recalls to mind a Theosophical allusion. The Stanzas of Dzyan, given in The Secret Doctrine, mentions the Sanskrit word \" Adi- Sanat.\" This Blavatsky explains to imply the equivalent of Brahma and the Qabalistic Sephira of Keser, and means the One Creator. The Egyptian word may be assumed by the Magician, in the absence of more precise and definite knowledge, to be, then, a reference to the Crown, the Monad in Man and Cosmos. Yet other methods may be devised for rendering intelligible the barbarous words, so that in the rites no flaw may mar the integrity and consistency of one's consciousness. So far as their practical use is concerned-the exaltation of the soul-a method outlined by Therion may be of some service. Assum- ing the ceremony to culminate in a major invocation, the crisis of which includes a number of these special words, a specific technique may be employed, one, however, which implies a modicum of training of the imagination. This faculty should so be developed that any picture of any object can clearly be formulated before the mind's eye with vivid distinctness and completeness ; and not only so, but that the formulation can be sustained for some while. During the invocation, the Theurgist should imagine that the first"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"148 THE TREE OF LIFE of these intoxicant words is like a pillar of fire extending as a vertical or upright column in the Astral Light. As the letters of the name leave his lips and are propelled forth into the ether, let him imagine that his own consciousness in the Body of Light follows those letters in their journey through subtle space, and is shot violently along that shaft. The next barbarous word should be conceived to occupy a column perhaps twice as long or as high as the preceding one, so that by the time the last word of the invocation is reached- ignoring for the moment the action and power inherent in the invoca- tion itself-the consciousness will be supremely intoxicated, and the ego will be overwhelmed by a feeling of bewilderment and fatigue. The shaft should be seen at the end to increase in stature before the spiritual eye, to tower up ever higher till the imagination is almost stricken by the looming greatness and immensity which it has created. This sense of awe and wonder produced by this travel- ling on the fiery shaft of each barbarous word is the right precursor of magical exaltation and ecstasy. And with practice the Theurgist will invent other methods, more suitable to his own temperament, for the satisfactory use of these words. 9 For the enlivening of ceremonial work Dancing, Music and the striking of knells are other subsidiary accompaniments. So far as the knells or knocks are concerned, they should be in harmony, so far as number is concerned, with the type of operation. Their use is to announce mastery, to register the note of the triumph of the Magician, and to restore the wandering attention. Music is a much more complicated matter, inasmuch as its appreciation varies so widely with different individuals. It is better omitted in most invocations, since it is more or less bound to distract the attention of the Theurgist, although as a prelude it may assist in the ecstasy and exaltation. It requires the presence of a musician or musicians, and any sign of self-consciousness or a flaw in their technique spells discord and failure. The violin or the harp has the most transcendent and exalting note and may, occasionally perhaps, be employed. The tom-tom with its fierce passionate drubbing is useful in other kinds of work where it is required to stir up energy, or even to still the mind. It is a simple matter to force the mind to follow the rhythmic beat of the tom-tom, which can be increased or gradually A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE slowed down until, when it has faded away into a subdued silence, the peace of a tranquil mind ensues. Oriental music consists mainly of this monotonous kind, thus implying a religious or mystical motive. At a ballet performance to which a friend of the writer was invited in Java, there were about a dozen dancers in grotesque yet gorgeously coloured costumes and masks, typical of the ostentatious Orient. The orchestra consisted of five players ; three upon an instrument resembling a huge xylophone, comprising but five notes, and two thumping on Javanese drums. In an outdoor theatre the dancing, principally with the hands and fingers, continued for five hours without a single interlude. All the time the industrious members of the native orchestra were zealously beating out their monotonous rhythms until it seemed to the Europeans as though the senses and mind would succumb to its dull rhythm, and pass at last into silence. A tripping dance, in the form of a simple two-step, for instance, may be useful, and, accompanied by a tom-tom and a mental mantram, within a consecrated circle or chamber, may be employed as the precursor of ecstasy. It is of particular interest to the Magician, this dance, since its characteristic is rhythm, and the whole of nature is the embodiment of rhythm and grace, both aspects of the dance. The dance in Nature is shown in growth and motion, for motion is the essential element of life, the theme enacted on an infinite stage. The ecstasies of Nature and her creatures have passed into common usage, recurring again and again in popular parlance. The music of the spheres, and the dance of the hosts of the planets and heavenly bodies in the infinitudes of space, have received due attention always at the hands of the greatest philosophers and poets who have seen into the heart of things. Frequently too one speaks-in clichks it is true-of the frisking of lambs, and the kids leaping in green meadows ; the floating dance of clouds, and the forward surge and retreat of the billows of the sea. These phenomena-what are they, if not joint participation in the Dance of Life which day in and day out, year after year, century upon century, proceeds unchanged and unaltered, and which in its perpetuity must be considered as the very incarna- tion of joy ?

In the beginning it is precisely the opposite. Underlying its performance there is a high religious motive-ecstasy and union with Allah. From a stationary position they gradually increase the speed of their rotation, and with arms outstretched whirl with such rapidity that they seem to move not at all. Within a short while, this rotary movement induces a giddiness of both mind and body which, by sheer effort of will, is postponed in its effect and thrust out of consciousness. The dance eventually culminates in the collapse of the Darwesh in a state of complete unconsciousness, not only so, and this I think is important, but in a state of the highest ecstasy. Some may also be familiar with such names as Shri Chai- tanya and his disciple Nityananda who wandered over India in the fifteenth century, singing and preaching and gaily dancing the doctrine of Bhakta or union with God by devotion. There is also within fairly recent years the eminent religious teacher Shri Rama- krishna Paramahamsa, whose frequent songs and devout dancings were so fraught with fervour and great emotion that it is said that moral and spiritual changes were wrought in those who were privileged to see them. Many of these people, runs the report, were so overcome by deep emotion and the ravishment of bliss at the sight of the Master dancing that they fell into ecstasies and swoons. So far as concerns the modem Theurgist, the principal object of the Dance is to acquire a physical exhaustion and a cessation of all thought. Within this negativity, if it have been induced within a properly consecrated and banished area, through which no entity dare intrude other than the force previously made manifest by the invocations, the spiritual presence invoked may incarnate. This is the fundamental idea to the Dance, although some may prefer to omit it altogether from their ceremonies. Each type of force, pertaining to the various Sephiros, will have its own kind of Dance, with its own step and its own tempo. A motion common to most invocations, which is less like a Dance than the actual tripping or whirling, is the circumambulation. Occasionally the Magician is required to walk from some one of the cardinal points a certain number of times around the circle, the specific number determining the nature of the force to be invoked. Again, the direction of the circumambulation, whether to the east or west, will determine whether he is invoking or banishing.

I propose to go further into the question of this employment of the Imagination, inasmuch as the most fundamental task in Magic is concerned therein. Since the plastic substance of the Astral Light is peculiarly susceptible to the manipulation of imaginative currents, and since the images made in that Light produce perceptible changes, if the Will be strong enough to vitalize those images, the Magician seeks to apply these facts to his own sphere. Attention should be redirected to the fact that by all authorities is the Astral Light considered dual in nature. There is the base astral aspect, the deceiving serpent so-called, occupied by the decaying shells and phantasmagoria ; and the superior plane, wherein is a wealth of real images, ideas, and spiritual intimations. To rise beyond the astral serpent through to the higher Astral is obviously a primary magical task. Invocations of the Holy Guardian Angel and the telestic union with the Gods and universal Essences constitute the supreme methods of transcending the lowest etheric planes ; but these are ultimate ends, to which all methods and techniques are made subservient. To make the difficult ends of invocation and union more easily attained and less arduous, the Theurgists recom- mend a practice in which success confers the ability consciously to transcend the inferior astral and deliberately rise even beyond the higher astral towards the formless divine fires of the spiritual realms. Inasmuch as all the planes of nature, and all the forces which obtain in the universe are represented in the interior constitution of man, the astral plane in its dual aspect is likewise found within him. The lowest aspect, the lunar phase, corresponds to the human principle of the Nephesclt, whereas the higher plane might be assumed to correspond to the central Sephirah of the Tree of Life, Tipharas, the pulsating heart of Ruach, and even extend to the confines of the 152 A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE I53 Neschamah. With the lower lunar aspect of the astral, the region of Qliphotic shells and demons and decaying phantoms of the dead, the Magician has little or naught to do ; his aspiration is directed towards that which is above, in the upper strata of the living Tree. \" Stoop not down,\" admonishes the Chaldaan Oracles, \" into the darkly splendid World ; wherein continually lieth a faithless depth, and Hades wrapped in clouds, delighting in unintelligible images, precipitous, winding ; a black ever-rolling Abyss ; ever espousing a Body unluminous, formless and void. . . . Stay not on the precipice with the dross of Matter, for there is a place for thy Image in a realm ever splendid.\" It is the \" realm ever splendid \" which does concern the Theurgist, since in it are the forces and powers which may prove of the utmost assistance to him in his quest. Within the dual Nephesch is a substantive and vital energetic principle. The former is the so-called Astral body, or the subtle duplicate to which the physical body owes its continued existence and persistence. While the development of this Nepheshic body does constitute a certain branch of Magic, it is not proposed to deal with it here, since it has but little association with the higher Theurgy. Pertaining to the realm of Tifiharas is a higher aspect of this astral body which does enter very largely into practical Theurgy. It is not really an astral body, in the sense of a vital model giving life to the physical, but it is a mental or thought body, the direct vehicle of the ideal and spiritual faculties, whose substance is that of the higher or divine Astral. According to Blavatsky this is the Mayavi-rupa, the thought or dream body, the sheath of the mind and memory and emotion, known and named in Theurgy as the Body of Light. Now, the Theurgists hold that this Body of Light may consciously be separated and projected from the body-and Blavatsky expresses the opinion that he who can do this is an Adept ! \" Thou shalt separate the fine from the gross, acting with great sagacity,\" counsels the Thrice Great Hermes. This Body of Light, as the vehicle of the higher principles, may be made to investigate the interior world with the view of ascertaining its real nature, thus of the nature of man himself, inasmuch as the laws of the universe are those of the mind, and vice versa. The higher Astral, with which one becomes acquainted through the instrumentality of the Body of Light, is thus used as a ladder, as it were, by means of which the Theurgist mounts to the realm of the supreme spirit, fiery, creative and ecstatic."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"I54 THE TREE OF LIFE Hence to project this fine Body, to acquire the faculty of function- ing in it with ease as one does in the gross body, to train and educate this Body of Light to fulfil the wishes of the Theurgist, is naturally a fundamental of practical Magic. The ability to succeed in this particular phase of the work depends entirely 011 whether the Magician has trained his Imagination, for that is the magical lever for the proposed projection. The technique, briefly, is as follows. Seating himself com- fortably in a chair-or if he be trained in the assumption of a Yoga posture and is easy therein, so much the better-and tran- quillizing his mind and emotions as far as may be possible, the Magician should try to imagine standing before him an exact duplicate of his own body. Should the Magician have engaged in much practice of the tattva symbols or the spiritual exercises of St. Ignatius and those described in a former section of this study, no great difficulty will be encountered in formulating this image. The Theurgist should conceive vividly that a simulacrum of his own body stands before hinl in the mind ; and that it is clothed as the Magician is clothed, in magical robe with wand or sword, as the case may be, and that it stands upright, or seated on a chair, or curled in an easy and comfortable Asana. Should the Magician be seated, the image likewise should be seen to be seated. By a suprerne effort of will that irnage should be made to move in the mind and, observed very closely all the time, to rise standing upright on its feet. The most difficult part of the Magician's task now approaches. To the Body of Light he must transfer his own consciousness, and it is this transfer which may prove a little difficult, for sometimes it simply will not go. In this case, exerting every ounce of his Will and putting forth all the power of his Imagination as far as possible so that he imagines and wills himself to be in the thought-body, the Theurgist should cause it to perform various actions. The performance of some such ritual as the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram is a splendid exercise, since by its means the Body of Light is made to move, to turn on its own axis, and to utter words. Persisted in, the Magician may find after several attempts that instead of this Body of Light performing the Ritual like an automaton while he observes, he himself will be performing it within the thought-body itself. These rnethods loosen the girders of the soul, and open the fast-locked gates of the mind. Furthermore, it may be that as the Magician A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE recites an invocation, following mentally each of the Ritual points with attention and care, he will find himself almost without knowing it in the Body of Light. The exhilarating effect of the words, the suggestions that they embody, should in some cases materially assist in the transfer. \" I tread upon high ! I tread upon the firmament of Nu ! I raise a flashing flame with the lightning of mine eye, ever rushing onwards in the splendour of the daily glorified Ra giving my life to the dwellers of earth ! \" \" I rise, I rise like a hawk of gold ! \" The first two sentences particularly, if recited with understanding and feeling, should quite conceivably suffice with some individuals to bring about the desired result. Even physically these words force one to rise on tip-toe, as though to tread on the firmament of Nu, and the subtle vehicles without doubt will follow suit. Success once reached, the transfer should be practised again and again, until eventually the Magician can slip in and out of his physical frame as an ordinary man slips out of his winter overcoat. But when once the actual projection has been accomplished the real task commences ; for the Body of Light must be trained to move and see on the Astral Plane, although but a short while suffices before it responds to training, and is able to move and see with the very lightning rapidity of thought itself. Immediately he has succeeded in indwelling the Body of Light, the Theurgist should exert himself to see with his astral senses. He should try to see the physical things and objects existing in the apartment from which he has just departed, noting the body, his former earthly habitation, the furniture, the walls and ceiling and all else. When he discovers that this can be done quite simply, and that the astral senses respond quite easily, then let him rise straight up towards the heavens and observe what there can be seen. The whole question is principally one of education. The Body of Light, the flashing solar vehicle of the Angel, must be made a worthy instrument, and just as a year-old child is taught to speak, to crawl, and to walk, so must this fine body of thought be trained to function perfectly on its own plane. It will be in practice of this kind that the Theurgist will discover that what were conventional symbols in the exterior world are dynamic realities, living their own existence in this Astral or thought world. It should be his aim to investigate this realm thoroughly in the multitude of the aspects and departments that it continually presents, inasmuch as it actually coincides with the"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"156 THE TREE OF LIFE limits of his own conscious and subconscious knowledge. With that one object in view, various comprehensive tasks should be undertaken. Those tattva symbols which previously were the objects of concentration and the exercise of imagination may be utilized as sigillze wherewith to provide visions which will reveal the invisible nature of the symbol. In the Body of Light a door could be imagined, on which is inscribed a red equilateral triangle for Tejas, as an instance. Going through that door, and observing the type of landscape, the angelic beings who speak to him, and the conversations which ensue, should give the Theurgist a fair idea of the implicit significance and meaning of the symbol. NOW there seems to be an absolute relationship between symbols and visional realities on the astral plane. The vision of the tattva should have proved this beyond all question. On record there are numberless instances of a symbol being given to a Skryer, one with which he was never previously acquainted and had never previously seen. Only to the owner of the symbol is the meaning known. The result of the vision obtained is illuminative and corroborative of the knowledge of the owner. Time and time again has this procedure been followed, and as many times has a vision been obtained which accurately concerns the nature of the symbol. This procedure should be pursued with regard to the other symbols and sub-elements of the tattvas. Likewise the astrological symbols of the planets and the zodiacal signs should be investigated by these means, as well as the pictures of the Tarot cards. This should open up a vast field of research for each Magician, since for one thing an entirely new species of knowledge may thus be acquired. The nature of a symbol hitherto unknown to him may be investigated, and a significance based upon observation and experience attached to it. A host of comprehensive experiments should be devised for the purpose of acquainting himself with the nature of the plane. When these astral visions do not confer any actual knowledge, they should be dismissed as mere technical exercises whereby to attain proficiency. Skill once having been obtained, and these visions of vital experience are no longer encountered, nor new knowledge acquired, the value of the practice disappears. It is known that some foolish people who are able to travel in the astral do nothing else, without gain or benefit. To them, an astral vision has no spiritual significance, and astral intoxication is the insidaous form of spiritual corruption which then overtakes them, and they A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 157 are lost, degenerating into mere astral \" tramps.\" Let the student take this warning to heart. The astral must be used either to obtain definite knowledge or to serve as a stepping stone, a rung on the celestial ladder to yet more subtle planes ; otherwise there is life- long stagnation there, overcome by intoxication, entangled in the seductive serpent-snares tempting the unwary and foolhardy. It is a reflecting world where one easily may get lost, unless the aspiration is pure and strong. Hours, days, and years even, may be spent in futile vision with as little gain as if one looked for long hours in a mirror of glass. \" For those to whom in their spiritual evolution these apparitions arise I would say : try to become the master of your vision, and seek for and evoke the greatest of earth memories, not those things which only satisfy curiosity, but those which uplift and inspire, and give us a vision of our own greatness ; and the noblest of all Earth's memories is the august ritual of the ancient mysteries, where the mortal, amid scenes of unimaginable grandeur, was disrobed of his mortality and made of the company of the gods.\"l Certain methods, it must be advised, are extant by which the Theurgist may test the accuracy of his vision and ascertain whether he has not been grossly deceived by elementals or the nature of his own phantasy-creating mind. By these methods also the possibility of getting lost in the maze of astral phantasmagoria is precluded. Assuming the Theurgist to have obtained a vision of Mercury let us say, by having used the Mercurial seals of Henry Cornelius Agrippa or the Key of Solomon the King, upon returning to his body, his first task should be to write up the experience in a special diary kept for that purpose. In passing, it should be made the order of the Magician's life to keep a scientifically entered diary of the magical experiments and visions, since this is conducive to order and equi- librium which is the direction whither his aspiration tends. More- over, in true scientific fashion these visions should be recorded inasmuch as the entry deletes many possibilities of ambiguity, since memory is not always fallible or trustworthy after a period of time has elapsed, and lays down in writing the procedure which may again be followed in the verification and checking of the vision. Immediately after each experience and vision the diary should be attended to. In the columns of Barrett's Magus or Agrippa's de Occulta The Candle of Vision. By A. E."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"158 THE TREE OF LIFE Philosophia, upon which much of the former is based, Crowley's Liber 777, and in my own Garden of Pomegrafiates will be found a wide series of natural and symbolic correspondences to each of the Thirty-two Paths of the Tree of Life. To these attributions the Magician should have recourse in verifying his vision, since experi- ment has proved, as I have said above, a real connection between the symbols and the attributions of the magical alphabet and subjective realities. If the vision of Mercury contains irregular elements, either of colour or number, which these columns attribute to, say, Mars or Saturn the student may be certain that something radically wrong has occurred, and steps should at once be instigated to repeat the entire vision, making sure that no errors or confusion of vision re-occur. As experience increases, the Magician retaining within his memory a comprehensive alphabet of correspondences, and as he becomes more familiar with the nature of that plane, he will become aware instantaneously as to whether the vision proceeds aright, and his growing intuition will warn him when some danger to coherency threatens. It cannot be too frequently uttered that the checking of the vision by reference to the magical alphabet is one of the most important tasks devolving upon the Magician. To neglect this scientific verification and critical examination of the vision is to find oneself sooner or later wallowing in the clogging mire of astral intoxication, with the prospect of advance and progress imperceptibly vanishing into thin air. A few precautions, however, should be observed prior to projecting the Body of Light. To leave the physical body by itself without the guiding intelligence and control of the inner Self is tantamount in most cases to extending an open invitation to whatever astral entity, malignant or otherwise, is in the vicinity to take possession. There is ac~ually no need to enterrain any apprehension for the physical welfare of the body, inasmuch as the Nephesch, the seat of the vital forces and the design body, remains within it to provide the continuation of its functions and physical life. But obsession at all costs rnust be avoided. 'I'he possession of the human frame by a dog-faced denion is subversive to magical aim and procedure. Hence certain rnethods have been devised to prevent the possibility of obsession, leaving the body quite safe while the soul wings its way to the sacred fires. Some authorities believe that the surround- ing of the body with an imaginary circle of white light is one of the most effective of all protective methods, since white being the A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE I59 colour of the Throne of the highest spirit, no lesser spirit would dare attempt to challenge its guard. Others favour the projection within a properly drawn magical circle, painted i11 colour with all the divine names outside, and the geometrical figures within. In this case, however, the circle must be consecrated and ceremoniallv banished by an appropriate ritual, a rather cumbersome and arduous pro- cedure for so frequent a practice. For this reason it is held that the Banishing ~itualof the Pentagram alone suffices to secure adequate protection and eliminates all possibility of demoniac possession. The return to the body after a vision must be attended to with care and judicious precaution. Upon entering the physical frame a few deep breaths should be deliberately undertaken in order to ensure the close conjoining of the two organisms, and it has been suggested that a God-form should be physically assumed and a Name vibrated. Usually the Harpocrates form suffices ; that is to stand upright, with the left arm in front of the body, with the forefinger held to the lips in the sign of silence, accompanied by the audible ~ronunciation of the God's name. Failure to ensure the cornmingling of the two essences of the thought body and the physical body may lead to disastrous consequences. If the Egyptian Book of the Dead is consulted, the reader will benefit very considerably in knowledge, for therein the Tuat and the Amentet, the sub-divisions of the Astral Light, have been the subject of close observation and precise classification. In the second part of Chapter CXXV, the god Osiris is seen seated at one end of the Hall of hlaati, accompanied by the Goddesses of Law and Truth, together with the forty-two assessors to assist him. Each of these forty-two Gods represents some one of the nomes of Egypt, and bears a symbolic magical name. In this conception one sees the towering ingenuity of the Egyptian theurgic-priests who made correspondences between the planes of the Astral Light and the nomes or county-divisions of the Upper and Lower Nile Country. By carefully studying this and subsequent chapters the Theurgist will glean much useful information concerning the Astral Light and the Guardians and Keepers of the Pylons through which he must pass in his self-initiation. Although the Book of the Dead represents these Pylons as those through which the deceased must pass on his way to rest in Amentet, they are also applicable to the Gates through which the Skryer in the spirit vision must enter. They should not be considered fictions, these guarded Gates with"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"160 THE TREE OF LIFE their god-like Watchers, for as will be discovered in the course of investigations, the Magician will approach certain of these closed gates and no amount of magical artifice or cajoling of the guardians of the sealed sanctuaries and mansions will provide him entry. Refusal to enter is a sure sign of unworthiness, and indicates above all the inability to exist in that rarefied condition. It intimates, moreover, that the Body of Light must be purified, made glowing and glittering, iridescent and self-shining, a solar organism which emits the radiant light of the Spirit within. It is only thus that he may attain to more fiery and exalted states, and gain admission from the ~n~el-guardians with flaming swords to the sacred Pylons and the inner Gates. The means of effecting this purification are the frequent performances of the Pentagram Ritual, thus formulating more clearly and radiantly the thought body, and the daily celebration of some form of the Eucharist which infuses into the Body of Light the refining substance of the spiritual essence. The visions which will then be acquired will be of a very high order. It may be after some little while has elapsed that the Theurgist will be astonished to find that his rBle of a detached observer of a vision has ceased and that, in some way, the vision is taking place about his own being, and that he is plunged into a tremendous spiritual experience never to be blotted out from conscious memory throughout the number of his days on earth. Initiations, in the real sense, and not in the implication of a formal lodge room ceremony, may there be instigated, the Theurgist taking part therein as a candidate to the sacred mysteries. To these initiations, needless to state, application is not made in any written form. They simply occur. And when they do, there is no doubt or vagueness as to what is occurring. As a type of the really moving experience which the highest type of astral vision may assume, I quote the following : \" There was a hall vaster than any cathedral, with pillars that seemed built out of living and trembling opal or from some starry substances which shone with every colour, the colours of eve and dawn. A golden air glowed in this place, and high between the pillars were thrones which faded, glow by glow, to the end of the vast hall. On them sat the Divine Kings. They were fire-crested. I saw the crest of the dragon on one, and there was another plumed with brilliant fires that jetted forth like feathers of flame.

I saw where their hands waved how sparkles of fire like the flashing of jewels broke out. There rose out of that dark body a figure as tall, as glorious, as shining as those seated on the thrones. As lle woke to the hall he became aware of his divine kin, and he lifted up his hands in greeting. He had returned from his pilgrimage through darkness, but now an initiate, a master of the heavenly guild. While he gazed on them the tall golden figures from their thrones leaped up, they, too, with hands uplifted in greeting, and they passed from me and faded swiftly in the great glory behind the throne.\"l In addition, the Qabalistic Tree of Life should be made the object of nluch research and experiment on that plane. The Slcryer should practise rising from one Sephirah to another, analysing the nature of that sphere carefully ; climbing all the branches of this Tree which grows out of the glowing heavens above descending in glory to the many-coloured earth beneath. All the Paths radiating from and joining together the Ten Sephiros should be carefully explored and registered in the scientific diary. It is thus that self-knowledge is attained, inasmuch as the Tree is a symbolic map not only of man's own inner constitution but of the structure and forces of the entire universe in every one of its multitudinous phases. \" Tlle Universe,\" wrote Crowley, \" is a projection of ourselves ; an image as unreal as that of our faces in a mirror, yet, like that face, the necessary form of expression thereof, not to be altered save as we alter ourselves. . . . In that Light, therefore, all that we do is to discover ourselves by means of a sequence of liieroglyphics and the changes which we apparently operate are in an objective sense illusions. . . . It enables us to see ourselves, and therefore to aid us to initiate ourselves by showing us what we are doing.\" By studying this synlbolic map in the astral, through the means of the Body of Light, the Magician will come to be acquainted with every aspect of his own consciousness and the universe itself.

For disclosing the various layers of mind and soul, together with their contents in dynamic form, the Astral Light and its investigation in the fiery solar body is the means $av excellence, than which there is none better. Thus is self-knowledge procured. Thus also is self-consciousness, in the true sense, attained, serving as a prelude to the symphonic har- monies of the celestial union. The results of this practice are very tangible and salutary. To brush aside the possibility of the conscious projection of the Body of Light, and to dismiss as of no account the vital experiences and self-linowledge obtained in the Divine Astral, with the superficial slul- that \" it is all imagination \" is absurd, to say the least. Experi- ment alone, and nothing else, will demonstrate whether the adventure in the empyrean is a supreme reality or a figmcnt of phantasy, even though it is admitted that the preliminary steps were , encompassed through the channels of the Imagination. \" Pro- metheus Unbound \" was first conceived in the fertile creative imagination of Shelley, but who is there foolish enough to reject the intrinsic beauty of this poem, or deny its undying reality because of its immaterial origin ? ,4 very similar mode of con- sideration is applicable here. By means of the Imagination, the blagician creates a subtle thought-instrument with which to measure, investigate and explore an already existent but hitherto unknown plane of consciousness in the universe. In any event, in but a short while it may be borne upon the ~a~ician, sceptical though he may and should be, that the Angelic entities he encounters ill the course of his visions, their conversations and their treatment of him, are hardly the products of his imagination. Nor are they seen to be subjective creations, especially when, perhaps to his consternation at first, things \" begin to hum.\" But I wish at this moment to consider one of the most important results which develops from this highly important branch of Theurgy. Prior to the attainment of success in the projection of the Body of Light, the human consciousness was inseparable from the physical body. The appetites and desires of that vehicle had become identified with the Rziaclt itself. With the ability to transfer the coiisciousness to the created Body of Light in the imagination there follows this significant philosophical conclusion. The soul is quitc distinct from the being of the body, and by the right methods A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 163 may be separated from and made independent of it. At first, the hasty conclusion must not be drawn that the soul is undying and immortal, for that has not as yet been verified by experience. It is still the Runclz, however, the false ego, which obtains in the transfer. There is no change at all in the individual being or in the nature of the consciousness itself, for the projection of the thought body is not analogous to the Mystical experience which annihilates duality, and brings ecstasy and illumination. The Theurgist remains the same person he was before, and duality still abides within his consciousness. Yet a supreme change of outlook or viewpoint has been accomplished. While in the Body of Light, when the transfer of consciousness has successfully been effected, he may see lying before him, as though asleep, the physical body which only a moment or so previously he vacated. So he krcows, by an act of ordinary observation, that he is not his body, for that physical body he may leave at will. He is a spiritual entity, the realization comes, which may function independently of his bodily organism. What now becomes imperative is the annihilation of duality. The immediate objective is the transcending of the Ruach, of opening wide its gates, so that the True Spiritual Ego may be found. With this discovery, when illumination and ecstasy invade the sphere of mind, is also the great realization that the Soul itself is immortal ; that mind, emotion and body are but the vehicles of that Soul, instruments to be employed for its own high purpose. And the means of ctiscovery is the pursuit of the Magical Path. Invocations, God-forms assumed while in the subtle body, and the Rising on the Planes are highroads to communion with the inner God. Let these Dractices be continued for some little while and the persistent effort to encompass the purification of the enclosing mental sheath, and it develops ever so gradually into a spiritualized organization. The old principle of inertia, slothfulness and of blackness, called by the Hindus Tamas, becomes broken up and is ejected from the magical sphere. The hollows of the brain, formerly heavy, impenetrable and dark, become light and strangely luminous. And a curious phenomena manifests, bringing jubilation to the heart of the hfagician when once its significance has been grasped. Whereas in old time the night was passed in the deep oblivion of sleep, or at best in the phantastic adventure of dream, now the consciousness is retained even during sleep. There is no long gap of oblivion ; all is one continl~ous free-flowing strea~n of awareness"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"164 THE TREE OF LIFE while the body sleeps, not sundered during the day or night by unconscious lapses. The importance of this attainment cannot be over-estimated. A new quality of purity, in the Hindu sense of Sattva, gradually manifests ; a quality of rhythm, continuity and bliss. With this infiltration of the Sattva quality, and the ejection of the tamasic elements from the sphere of the personality, the lightness and luminosity grows in the brain, and consciousness not of the Rzrnch but of the highest Soul persists in every hour. Thus life is conquered, for the Soul is above its lo~vly grasp. Death, the grey horror and awful fear of mankind, and the last despair of the philosophers, is transcended. Only the body dies. The mind and the emotions suffer death also. But ever continues unchanged and unaffected the divine Angel of the Sacred Light, purified through trial, triumphant over the mutations of life and death-calm, serene and imperturbable in the knowledge of its own Immortality. Thus the results of Skrying in the Spirit Vision cannot be too highly lauded. For this practice can lead the Magician to thc loftiest pinnacles of the Tree of Life where the air is pure and the viewpoint clear and unsullied. There is, of course, the preliminary danger of either getting lost on the uncharted by-ways of that plane, or become ensnared within the seductive grasp of bright forms and the flceting astral visions of the depths. However, all this is elementary. If the aspiration be hept untarnished and pure, and if the sceptical principles of the Qabalah are applied, there should be little danger of this happening. Then inay the Magician calmly wing his way beyond his personality, beyond the glittering phantoms of the Astral, past the splendid faithless visions with their allure and witchery, to the inner heart of the Heavenly Man, where the Lord of all is enthroned. 9 Before the commencement of a vision, or any operation in Magic, it is advisable for the student to perform a thorough banishing, which is both puriiying and protective. The quickest and best methcd of banishing is through the Banishing Ritual of the Penta- gram. The Pentagram espresses, according to Levi, \" the mind's domination over the elements, and it is by this sign that we bind them. . . . It is the symbol of the Word made flesh and, according to the direction of its rays, it represents good or evil, order or disorder. . . .

One of the divine names by which the Jews conceived the universal creative force was YHVH, which, denominated the Tetragrammaton, came to be considered as the equivalent of the Four Elements in the Cosmos. It was also conceived to represent the ordinary unenlightened man in whom the light of spirit had not yet made its appearance ; the unregenerate being of earth, air, fire and water, given up to the things of the unredeemed self. By means of Magic it was considered that into these four elements on which the flesh is based, the Holy Spirit amidst fire and glory and flame descended. In Hebrew the element Spirit is typified by the letter Slzin, with its three darting prongs of spiritual fire united under the form of one principle. Bursting asunder the fleshly being, and carrying with it the germs of enlightenment and inspiration and revelation, the Holy Spirit forms by its presence in the heart a new species of being, the Adept or Master YHS~VH. This word, in Hebrew, is the name of Jesus, the symbol of the God-Man, a new type-species of spiritual being, greater than Whom there is nothing in all the heavens and planes of nature. Because of this fact, and the ideology summarized in the sign of the Pentagram, the symbol of the four elements sur- mounted by the crowning and conquering flame of the Holy Ghost, it owes its incomparable efficiency and power to subdue all astral opposition and cast out gross substance from the being of the Magus. Depending entirely on the direction towards or away from any of the five points in which this figure is traced by the Magician, so will the result be. Proceeding from the topmost point and descend- ing in a straight line to the lower right-hand point, the powers of Fire will be invoked. On the other hand, if the Magician traces with his wand the figure from the left-hand corner to the top he will banish the elements of Earth. It may also be remarked that it is this latter type of Pentagram which is used in the Pentagram ritual, it usually sufficing to banish beings of whatsoever class."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"166 TIIE; TREE OF LIFE And the sword to represent the dispelling critical faculty of the Ri!nclz is usually the instrunlent cmploycd in this connection. The so-called Ritual of the Pentagram has acquired the significance of being purely a banishing ritual, although in reality it is a composite structure. Before entering upon its consideration, I quote it : I. Touching the forehead, say Atoh (unto Thee). 2. Touching the breast, say Malkus (the Kingdom). 3. Touching the right shoulder, say ve-Gevurah (and the Power). 4. Touching the left shoulder, say ve-Gedulah (and the Glory). 5.

Turning to the South, the same, but say ADNI. 8. Turning to the West, the same, but say AHIH. g. Turning to the North, the same, but say AGLA. 10. Extending the arms in the form of a cross, say : 11. Before me Raphiel. 12. Behind me Gabriel. 13. On my right hand Michael. 14. On my left hand Auriel. 15. For about me Flames the Pentagram. 16. And in the column stands the six-rayed Star. 17. Repeat I to 5, the Qabalistic Cross. In this connection it may prove of intereat to the reader that Aleister Crowley has remarked that those \" who regard this ritual as a mere device to invoke or banish spirits, are unworthy to possess it. Properly understood, it is the Medicine of Metals, and the Stone of the Wise.\" Within its performance there is, as I have remarked, a complex movement. The ritual first invokes, and, having banished by the Pentagram all the elements from the four cardinal points with the aid of the four names of God, it then evokes the Four Archangels as divine guardians to protect the sphere of magical operation. In closing, it once again invokes the Higher Self, so that from beginning to end the entire ceremony is under the surveillance of the Spirit. The first section, comprising points one to five, identifies the Holy Guardian Angel of the Magician with the highest aspects of the Sephirotic universe ; in fact, it affirms the soul's identity with Adam Kadmon. In the second A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE section, points six to nine, the Magician traces a protecting circle, while his imagination is formulating an astral Circle of Fire within which to pursue his work. At the North, South, East and West of this Circle banishing Pentagrams of the element Earth are traced with the wand or sword. As these Pentagrams are formed in mid- air with the elemental weapon, every effort should be made to impart vitality and reality to them. The blind performance of this ritual, as is so true of every aspect of Theurgy, is quite useless, and is a waste of both time and energy. The imagination, simultaneously, should be stimulated to create these Pentagrams about the Magician on the Astral Plane in glowing figures of fire, so that through the streaming lines of light and power, representative of the spiritual being, no lesser entity of any kind dare make its way. It is necessary that the Magician make certain that he does not lower the elemental weapon after formulating a Pentagram in mid-air. The Circle must be complete, continuing in an unbroken line from Pentagram to Pentagram. The blazing five-pointed star is llke the flamlng sword which debarred Adam from the Edenic paradise. The four Archangels, the spiritual regents of the four elements, are then in- voked to give legitimacy to the working, and spiritual power and protection to both the surrounding Pentagrams and the Circle where- in the Magician is enclosed. The last phrase of the ritual declares the Pentagrams aflame about him,and Invokes once again the Holy Guardian Angel so that the operation is sealed with the stamp of the divine light. One of the highly significant and important results of this ritual, if rightly performed in the manner indicated, is the cleansing of the entire sphere of personality. Only a little practice will demon- strate to the young Theurgist as to whether he is succeeding in obtaining the required effect. It is extremely difficult, I regret to state, to describe the result of the banishing, as of course are most matters pertaining to the subjective realm of sensation and per- ception. There should be a clear sense, unmistakable in its mani- festation, as of cleanliness, even of holiness and sanctity, as though the whole being were gently but thoroughly purged, and that every impure and unclean element had been dispersed and annihilated. Just as a plunge into a cool running stream on a hot midsummer day leaves one blessed with the sense of refreshment and purification, so also should be this ritual. The rationale of its action depends on the purification of the"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"168 THE TREE OF LIFE constituents of the nature of the Magician. Every molecule, every cell-astral, mental and physical-is concerned, inasmuch as the basis of each principle is grounded in centres of energy and spiritual force. These microscopic points or monads, are the minute sensitive points of spiritual consciousness, and in the reality of their existence and function is based not only the deepest sense of individuality but the basis of matter itself, and its concomitants of energy and physical life. These monads are at the root of the cell as of a mineral, brain matter as well as of vegetable life. The result of the formulation of the Circle of Fire and the flaming Pentagrams, the vibration of the God-names and the Invocation of both the Angels of the Cardinal Points and the Holy Guardian Angel, is that gradually the coarser cells or monadic atorns are ejected from the sphere of consciousness. To take their place other lives, more sensitive and refined, of a finer grade of spiritual substance, are attracted to the sphere of being, and infused into the very substance of the physical and invisible constitution. Thus a vital purification takes place, enabling the influence of the Holy Guardian Angel to penetrate the refined brain and mind to diffuse throughout the personality its presence and grace, an important preliminary to magical progress. The history of this particular ritual is somewhat obscure. I have seen no other instance like it which devolves from antiquity, although obviously some similar form of banishing must of necessity have been used. In Levi may be found the first references to the particular ritual in question. In Dogme et Rit~el de la Haute Magic we find the following statement : \" The sign of the Cross adopted by Christians does not exclusively belong to them. It is also Kabbalistic and represents the oppositions and tetradic equilibrium of the elements. There were originally wo methods of making it, the one reserved for priests and initiates, the other set apart for the neophytes and profane. Thus, for example, the initiate, raising his hand to his forehead, said : ' Thine is,' then brought his hand to his breast, 'the kingdom,' then transferred it to the left shoulder, ' Justice,' finally to the right shoulder, ' and mercy ' ; then joining his hands, he added, ' through the generating ages.'

It is to the Ritual of the Pentagram indubitably that Levi makes reference. In the now defunct Order of the Golden Dawn, under the leadership of the late S. L. McGregor Mathers, this ritual was used extensively and, after his demise and the destruction of parts of his Order, it was appropriated and perpetuated by Aleister Crowley in the latter's periodical the Equifzox. Previous to this reprinting, I have been unable to trace any authoritative reference to anything which bears the slightest resemblance to this ritual. Evidence exists, however, showing that some form of protection or a preliminary banishing was recognized by the medieval Magicians from whom, judging by the contents, Francis Barrett received his methods. To Cornelius Agrippa and Pietro de Abano, he was no little indebted. In Barrett's work The Magus there is the statement that before beginning the invocations there should be some \" prayer or psalm or gospel for our defence in the first place,\" and on a later page he gives a form of consecration of the Circle in which the idea of defence is distinctly formulated. In addition, moreover, there is the method of the employment of the Pentagram mentioned in the magical instructions of the Goetia and the Key of Solomon and expatiated upon by the French magus. The magical figure is drawn as a sigil, with its appropriate words and symbols, on metal or virgin parchment, for use during the ceremony. Should danger threaten the Exorcist, or he finds himself unable to accommodate the evoked intelligence to his Will, the Pentagram should be held aloft in the hand, and carried in circumambulation to the Four Quarters where a short address to the Lord of the Universe is recited. The result actually is identical with the tracing and formulation of the figure in the air with the verendum of art. There is also a variation which might be mentioned, although it is a form which should figure in all ceremonial work. It is called the License to Depart, and occurs in those ceremonials wherein an intelligence has been conjured to visible appearance in the Triangle of Art. When the operator has no further desire for the spirit to remain in the Triangle, the licence is recited enabling the spirit to dematerialize, and depart from the scene of operation. \" O thou Spirit N, because thou hast diligently answered unto my demands, and hast been very ready and willing to come at my call, I do here license thee to depart unto thy proper place, without causing harm A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE or danger unto man or beast.

Amen ! \" Barrett gives a slight variation of the above Goetia licence : \" In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, go in peace unto your places ; peace be between us and you ; be ye ready to come when you are called.\" He adds later than when tlie spirit has departed, the Magician is not to go out of the Circle for some lninutes, but that a short prayer should be made giving thanks for the success of the operation, and \" praying for future defence and coliservation, which being orderly performed you may depart.\" As a footnote, giving additional warning, Barrctt adds rhat they who neglect the licensing of the spirit are in very grave danger, because instances have been known of the operator experiencing sudden death. It cannot be said that these various metbods seen1 as scientific or as reliable as the Pentagram ' Banishing Ritual described above. The ritual as given is one of tlie most unique extant, and should ncvcr under any circumstnnces be omitted from any magical work, whether it be formal Ceremonial Magic, the celebration of the hlass of the Holy Ghost, or Skrying in the Spirit Vision. The sphere of personality is kept pure and elean, pr&enting any extraneous entity from breaking through into the radius of perception, thus destroyicg the continuity and coherency of that particular work. Two other methods of banishing remain to be described. When. ., in a ceremony, it is required to make a more t'tiorough banishing than is afforded by tlie Pentagram ritual, it is customary to employ a technique resembling somewhat an official exorcism. A few drops of water are sprinkled around the Circle, a burning candle represent- ing the element fire is deliberately extinguished, a fan is waved in tlie air and a few grains of salt are dropped on the edge of the Circle. At the same time, there should be uttered the magical words \" Exarp, Bitom, Hcoma and Nanta,\" each of which controls tlie spirit of Air, Fire, Water and Earth. A conjuration should also be recited for the departure of the elementals ruled by those names, and, of course, it is best preceded by the Pentagram ritual. Several of the versicles from The Ckaldann. Ovacles may be employed to great advantage with each of the ceremonial actions just mentioned. The other rllethod is one that was employed by the Egyptian"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 171 priests, and is contained in one of the chapters of the Harris Magical Papyrus. It is a ritual of Banishing to be performed at the Four cardinal points, formulating in the Imagination a Guardian in the shape of a Dog, which was supposed to be terribly destructive to any attacking force. I shall not attempt to describe it, but I give it verbatim from the Papyrus. \" Arise, Dog of Evil, that I may instruct thee in thy present duties. Thou art imprisoned. Confess thou that it is so. Horus it is who has given this commandment. Let thy face be terrible as the storm-parted sky. Let thy jaws close pitilessly. . . . Make thy hair stand up like rods of fire. Be thou great as Horus and terrible as Set ; equally to the South, to the North, to the \\Vest and to the East. . . . Nothing shall stop thee, while thou settest thy face in my defence . . . while thou settest thy face to protect my paths, opposing thyself to the enemy. I bestow upon thee the power of banishing, of becoming noiseless and invisible. For thou art my guardian, courageous and terrible.\" This form of banishing, in any event, should be accompanied by the Pentagram Ritual. It is used mainly in difficult operations of evocation, where there might be some danger of a particularly malignant entity attracted to the Temple breaking rhrough an ordinarily consecrated Circle to the detriment of the Magician. It has also been used in the invocation of Horus, or the inteIligences of the planet Mars, when the astral sphere was particularly desired to be thorougllly clean and pure. It need not be emphasized, I feel sure, that if this method is employed the formulation in the imagination of the dog guardian should be just as precise as that given to the Pentagram, and the Theurgist should attach importance, so far as concerns the figure in his mind's eye, to the data given in the conjuration itself.

Monsieur Franqois J. Chabas in his now out-of-print book Le PaPy~us ilfagique Hawis presents the highly significant information, hardly to be found elsewhere in definite form, that the most powerful magical formula known to the priests of the sacerdotal castes of ancient Egypt was the identification of the Ritualist in imagination with the divinity he was invoking. Iamblichus presents the statement that \" The priest who invokes is a man ; but when he commands power it is because through arcane symbols he, in a certain respect, is invested with the sacred Forms of the Gods.\" Whether the clause \" in a certain respect \" indicates the formula about to be considered, is a problem which may be left open, although it well may be that it is the Assumption of the God-form to which he has reference. Scattered here and there throughout the Book of the Dead, in some of the rituals and hymns to the Gods, one ascertains that the scribe of that book identifies himself with them. There are numerous examples of separate verses confirming this belief. \" I have united myself with the divine Apes who sing at the dawn and I am a divine Being anlong them.\" In Chapter One Hundred the verse, \" I have made myself a counterpart of the goddess Isis and her power (khu) hat11 made nle strong,\" would appear most definitely to countenance the view, which also obtains additional confirnlation from other sources, that the assumption of the God- form constitutes one of the most important factors to be noted in the Magic of the Egyptians. Remembering all that which has been postulated with regard to the plastic, magnetic nature of the Astral Light, in both its inferior and superior aspects, and the creative potentiality of the trained 172"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE Imagination, as well as the remark made by Levi in connection with the astral body that \" it can assume all forms evoked by thought,\" the student should make it a point of studying the conventional forms by which the Gods are portrayed. I have gone to some length in a previous chapter in describing briefly the forms and some of the philosophic characteristics of the more important Gods connected with the Tree of Life in order to simplify the requirements of the general reader. Now experience has demonstrated to Western Theurgists that the pictorial representations of the Egyptian Gods are perfect for the purpose of this particular practice-more so than those of India- and comprise in themselves a most marvellous and recondite system of symbolism. The forms of those universal powers and cosmic intelligent essences, which the priestly castes of Egypt denominated the Gods, stood each complete behind a human or animal mask, every attribute being symbolized by some emblem or artistic ornamentation. The divinity of a God was symbolized by the type of, and emblems on, the head-dress, such as the Ur~us Serpent, or the Disk of the Rising Sun, or the double feathers of Truth, divine and mundane. There were the representation of powers by the Ibis wand, the Sceptre or the Ankh, borne in the hand of the God. Yet other symbols carried by the God were suggestive of his ability to confer resurrection or rebirth, authority and power, ecstasy or stability, or representative in some way of llis particular function in the cosmic economy. The conventional form of the God thus summarizes in a most astounding way a vast aggregation of ideas, legends and myths, epitomizing at the same time special forces of nature, or, it may be, unconscious powers in the spiritual make-up of man. To provide an instance of the procedure to be followed in making application of this hypothesis, let us assume for the moment that the task on hand is the invocation and the identification of the human consciousness with that divinity, or aspect of cosmic life, known as Ra-the indwelling deity of the Sun. At first the Magician will occupy himself with the task of discovering all that is possible about the nature of the God. The legends which have grown around the God's character should be minutely analysed, inasmuch as it is a commonplace that in the fanciful legends and myths of old time much spiritual knowledge and wisdom was stored. Moreover, the legend attached to a particular God will indicate aspects of the nature and the ideal temperament of the deity, and suggest also A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"174 THE TREE OF LIFE various powers in the god-like Personality which the student previously had never suspected. The danger of Magic, at least one of the important dangers, is the unintelligent pursuit of a given part of the Theurgic technique without a real understanding of the processes performed, and the philosophic principles of the practice. Let the student therefore arrive at a more or less complete realization, so far as is possible, of what it is he is desirous of becoming, of what force or spiritual power he wishes to invoke; and then, being certain and well- informed in mind, proceed. Some such informative work as The Gods of the Egyptians, by Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, one-time Keeper of Egyptian Antiquities in the British Museum, will be distinctly helpful. From the half-tone plates provided herein and the coloured ones in the book just mentioned he should familiarize himself with the shape and form of the God, the postures in which that God is usually portrayed, the gestures customarily employed, and the colours which are used in the artistic rendition. This reading can also be supplemented by a visit to the Egyptian Galleries in the British, or any other, Museum. The reader will, I can assure him, be well repaid. With all these facts in memory, the student should proceed to the more difficult phase of the work which consists of the appli- cation of the Imagination and the Will, trained by his former practices. In his working-not necessarily ceremonial-he should endeavour to construct before his mind's eye a perfect image or mask of the God. The form must stand out boldly and clearly in the vision of the Imagination, gigantic, resplendent and irradiating the light of the spiritual Sun, of which Ra is the conventional exoteric symbol. He will note that the God carries an Ibis wand in his left hand-the Ibis being the symbol of wisdom and divine will ; in his right hand is borne the holy Ankh, the symbol of light and life which the Sun, from day to year, throughout the unnumbered centuries, bestows freely to the whole of mankind, and to all his creatures on the earth. Upon his head as a crown is a nimbus, a golden aureole of inimitable splendour, confronted by an unlifted Ur~us serpent, the symbol of the inner spiritual fire. Pictured as a hawk whose head is orange in cdour, the nernyss of the God des- cends from the crown dark blue, almost black, in hue, the colour of the tattva symbol of Spirit ; and the God's skin is flaming like the fire of the sun at noon.

It is a tremendous task of creative imagination, and an arduous one. But day after day it must be contiillled with ardour and devotion, until the sacred task is consummated, and, complete and glowing, the God stands forth, a God in truth to his devotee. With this image held firmly in the astral light, the Theur- gist should endeavour to envelop his own form with the shroud of the God, and then to unite himself with the Form enshrouding him. As Levi has already been quoted as saying, the Astral bodp will assume the form of any powerful thought which the mind evokes. This Astral effigy of the God, previously but an imagc external to the body of the Theurgist, should now be arranged as a. divine figure around his own astral forin until they coincide, his owil Body of Light being changed and transmuted into the Body of the God. Only when the Theurgist actually fcels the superb influx of spiritual power, the acquisition of the solar force and energy and spiritual illumination, only when lie knows in the intuition of the deific trance that the identification lias been accomplished, is the task of creaticn complete. \" The images of the Gods,\" wrote Iamblichus, the divine Theurgist, \" are replete with a. fulgid light . . .\" and \" the fire of the Gods, indeed, shines forth with an indivisible and ineffable light, and fills all the profundities of the world \" in an empyrean celestial marzner. Of the Theurgist or the Priest-King of Egypt who had accomplished this excellent commingling of essences with the glory of the God of the Sun, there is a description in the form of an address quoted by G. Maspero, the Egyptologist, showing the power of the spirit which has entered the votary as the result of the identification. The address goes : \" Thou resemblest Ra in all that thou doest. There- fore the wishes of thy heart are always fulfilled. If thou desirest a thing during the night, at dawn it is already there. If thou sayest Come up upon the mountains, the celestial waters shall flow at thy word. For thou art Ra incarnate, and Khephra created in the flesh. Thou art the living image of thy Father Temu ; Lord of the city of the Sun. The God who commands is in thy mouth, and a God sits upon thy lips.

In brief, the invocation of the God should be couched in such language as will tend to produce a mental exhilaration and ecstasy. The following, adapted from the Book of the Dead, is an instance of some such ritual, although it is given here not as an example to be rigidly and slavishly imitated, but only to serve as an intimation and to assist perhaps the sincere student. \" Homage to thee, 0 Ra, at thy beauteous rising.

As the Theurgist cries \" Thou shinest at the dawn,\" the astral form of the God should be seen and actually felt with the senses to emit a refulgence before which the brightest midday sunshine would seem as but black darkness, a light so sharp and keen, and rich with a brilliance and golden glory, that its essence should suffuse with great subtlety the heart and mind and soul.

In him, and in his soul, the God will seek his eternal dwelling-place. Within the heart will be a sanctuary and a serene habitation of a tremendous spiritual force, a divine consciousness which throughout all duration will live in him, trans- forming the child of earth to a veritable Son of the eternal Sun. \" For, as darkness is not adapted to sustain the splendour of the glittering light of the sun, but suddenly becomes totally invisible, entirely recedes, and immediately vanishes ; thus also, when the power of the Gods, which fills all things with good, abundantly sliines forth, no place is left for the turnult of evil spirits.\" So the Magicians of old have taught. Modern efforts repeatedly give their teachings and experiments added confirmation. In this way, increasing himself to an immeasurable greatness in conjoining himself with the greatness of the Gods, the Theurgist leaps like the mountain goat beyond all forms to ideas and essences abiding at the summit of manifestation, and transcending time becomes eternity and infinity.

That which formerly was gross becomes divested of all its sensual commonplace to take on an alluring beauty, passionately exquisite, stolen as it were from the spirit. Within himself latent unfolding spiritual faculties will be felt, and the faint memory of experience gained in time long since past and dead will gradually arise to illuminate the mind and pulse anew in the heart, expanding the horizon of con- sciousness.

It seems to be iterated by almost every authority, dogmatically and with certainty by some, somewhat vaguely by others who band on what they themselves have received half- understood and half-digested from their forbears. All are agreed, nevertheless, that with the pursuit of the magical arts there must be purity and sanctity. I wish to enquire into what is ineant by this \" purity.\" Into a discussion of ethics and morals I do not wish to enter, for this would lead me far from the subject of Magic, and I have purposely refrained herein from touching upon this contro- versial subject which seems to have created more confusion and difference of opinion than almost any other. So far as Purity in Magic is concerned, however, tlle student may rest assured with the truth of this one statement, reading into the rest whatever inter- pretation of morals he so chooses. The whole of one's life should point in one direction, and be concentrated upon and devoted to one set of objectives. When we say, for instance, that milk or butter is pure, what do we mean by this statement ? Only this. To the milk we are considering has been added no water or chemicals or any other estraneous s~bstance, and the entirety of its contents is consistent with the main ingredient. Now purity of magical life is to be considered in much the same way. The life of the Magician must above all things be ekn-grata, one-pointed, and the sum total of his thoughts, elnotions and actions, whatever they be, should always be made to interpret and give impetus to the spiritual aspiration. Whatever virtue morality may have in itself, and for some individuals it is pregnant with divine possibility, it is completely outside tlie Magician's sphere.

Such a man is usually by a natural impulse in harmony also with all other men. But the Mystic or the Magician is not necessarily a moral man in any con- ventional sense. That is to say we must by no means expect to find that the Magician, even when he is in fundamental harmony with his fellow beings, is necessarily in harmony with the moral and ethical laws of his age. Morals, in short, have nothing to do with Magic. This idea has been clearly stated by Waite who, in his Studies in Mysticism, suggests that \" The object of religion is the development and perfection of humanity by a series of spiritual processes, and its union with what is highest in the universe, while morality pro- poses the amelioration of the race with the assistance only of natural law. . . . We must know God in order to be good, but no moral goodness can bring us to divine knowledge. . . .\" So far as the Magician is concerned this only is important. Whatsoever it is that he is doing, whether eating, drinking or working, that action must be transfigured into a symbol of and dedicated to the service of that Ideal treasured above all wealth and other values in his heart. His whole life should be one continuous concentration. All his training in Dharana and the development of the magical Will otherwise will have been utterly wasted ; so much useless energy thrown away as on a dust heap if he does not bring this concentration and this sacramental attitude to bear upon the press of daily life. Now the ideal which to the Magician constitutes his greatest treasure, and to which the whole tenor of his life's activities is directed, is the recovery of the knowledge of his Holy Guardian Angel, the Augoeides, that nobler part of his consciousness which is real, permanent, and the bountiful, undying source of inspiration and spiritual sustenance. Hence there is, in reality, one perfect ritual in Magic ; one goal which takes precedence over all others : the invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel, union with whom should even precede the invocations of the Gods or the Universal Essences, following the procedure laid down by Iamblichus. The soul seeks first and delivers its life into the governance of its Daimon, under whose guidance the Gods themselves may be supplicated ; and proceeding from them the return should be made to the Supernal Mansion of Rest. But the Augoeides invocation must have pre- cedence over all others. Should it be found necessary to perform"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 181 any subsidiary operation anterior to that for the Knowledge and Conversation of the I-Ioly Guardian Angel, it should be a necessary well-defined purpose. Its motive, a spiritual one of course, is intended as a preliminary to the possibility and success of the major ritual. However, in the best systems of Magic, evocations are always represented as following the major attainment of the invocation of the great cosmic life forces or the inner Daimon, the Holy Guardian Angel, though the latter is usually given precedence as has been said. Union with the Gods and Adonai is sought by means of love, and the commingling of essences is encompassed by surrender of the ego, and the spontaneous renunciation of all that is mean and petty and irrelevant. The supreme invocation implies above all other things the sacrifice of attachment to earthly things. As one who, entering into the interior of the heavenly Adytum, leaves behind him all statues in the outer temple, or as those who enter the inner sanctuary of the Holy of Holies purify themselves, laying aside their garments to enter naked and unashamed, so should the soul approach its goal. In the Abramelin Operation, shortly to be described, the procedure to be followed is very similar. First the Angel is invoked in a specially consecrated chamber, and after the attainment the Angel bestows upon the Magician special instruc- tions and authority pertaining to the evocation of the Four Great Princes of the Evil of the World. The outcome of the invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel does not result identically with various people. Adonai appears in various manners and guises, according to the individual. \" Moreover,\" Iamblichus also confirms, \" the gifts arising from the manifestations are not all of them equal, nor have the same fruit. But the presence of the Gods, indeed. im~arts to us health of bodv, virtue of soul, . * \". purity of intellect, and in one word elevates everything in us to its proper principle.\"l Whatsoever the man cherished during his life, and to whatsoever conception of his Angel he aspired, so will the outcome of the mystical marriage be. According to his love, so will be the offspring. Each student, as he ascends or enters into the mystic Mount Abiegnus of the Rosicrucians, will see before him, stretching forward on the far horizon of the holy land of promise, just that panorama which existed potentially within him before the Vision gave it birth. For the Mount is a symbol for that peak of soul when, gone inward into itself, it draws-nigh to its divine root. 1 The Mysteries. Iamblichus.

Our inspiration will be in like manner to the aspira- tion, and the type of genius which will be manifested to the world following the mystical union may be poetic, artistic, musical, or any other recognized manifestation. I remember a passage in some one of the Upanishads which deals with this same theme. If one approaches the Self which is Brahma believing that it is Power and Might, that one becomes might and power. Let him, however, approach it seeing in its majesty supernal knowledge and wisdom, and he as a result becomes filled with the Wisdom of the Self. And if he aspires towards it as the creator of Song, he likewise becomes the singer. In other words, just what the Theurgist has conceived in imagination his Angel to be, in just that form does the Angel manifest, welling up from the deepest font of being within the heart, as revelation and inspiration. Should there be aspiration towards the Angel solely as the symbol of Iove and peace and kindliness so does Adonai show to the world that gracious and benign aspect. St. Francis of Assisi is the most outstanding instance of the one, as is the Buddha who aspired to Wisdom that he might find for mankind the solution of their woes and sorrows, the symbol of the other. And this supplies the answer to the question \" If Mysticism and Magic endow a inan with genius, why is it that so many successful Mystics and Magicians seem to manifest not one scrap of genius ? \" It is because their aspiration has been a humble one ; to become no great figure an earth was their desire, neither did they aspire towards any of the forms of Art. Of their lives they made a sublime work of artistic creation, and applied their inspiration to the walk of every- day life, appearing but humble men and women of gentle mien and aspect. But like the cowled and gowned Hermit of the Tarot they bore the angel light within them, secretly, that all with whom they came into contact day by day might be blessed with Adonai's love, and impressed with the holiness of the spirit and the purity of its efful- gence rather than with their own personal attainment. This is the key; for when one inflames oneself in prayer towards the Holy Guardian Angel, as the secret aspiration of the soul will have been, upon that will the Angel seize, in the ecstasy of bliss which ravishes the soul away, to convey his manifestation to the world.

The majority of old grimoires and magical books such as the Petit Albert, Rouge Dragon and Enchiridion, are purposely unintelligible, ambiguous, or else, apart from all questions of recondite symbolism, puerile nonsense. Those which are straight- forward and workable as a rule contain undesirable sections more appropriate to the aspirations of a love-sick farm labourer and to ignorant primitives than to those of educated people with a serious purpose. But to all these there is one startling exception. The general rule is broken by the existence of The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelifl the Mage. Written in an exalted style this book is perfectly coherent and consistent ; it does not demand fantastic ~ninutig of ritual nor even the customary calculations of day and hour. There is nothing at all to insult the intelligence. On the contrary, the operation proposed by this magical author is the apotheosis of simplicity, and the method itself is in entire accordance. There are, naturally, certain preliminary prescriptions and injunctions to be observed, but these really amount to little more than common-sense counsel to observe decency in the performance of so august an operation. One must, for instance, possess a house where proper precautions against disturbance can be taken ; this being arranged, there remains little else to do but to aspire with increasing concentration and ardour for six months towards the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The book itself is one of the most extraordinarv documents on Magic extant in this day, and the system which is taught therein of entering into communion with one's inner self, or the Holy Guardian Angel, is of all systems of Magic perhaps the most simple. Above all it is effective. It is written in three sections, the first one containing general advice concerning Magic, and a description of the author's travels and experiences, as well as mention of the marvellous works he had been able to accomplish by means of its technique. There follows then a general and-complete description of the methods of obtaining the ecstatic crisis of the Operation, and the style of the book here differs in a salutary manner from the former and subsequent chapters. The last section deals with the methods of applying the powers which are conferred through the consumma- tion of the Operation. The system is described by one Abraham the A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE Jew to his younger son Lamech, and he claimed in the first instance to have received it from an Egyptian Magician named Abramelin. Abraham the Jew is a dim and shadowy figure, unknown and secre- tive, behind the tremendous complications of the central European upheaval of his day, when that part of the world was engulfed in a vast conflict. The history of Abraham as told by himself in the first book is indeed simple. What strikes one, however, is the tremendous simplicity of the man's faith, as witnessed by his many and dangerous journeys for so many years through wild and savage regions difficult of access even in our own day with its facilities of transportation. This part of the book narrates his failures and disappointed hopes and a few of the cul-de-sacs through which he was led, until the culmination of his wanderings when he met Abramelin the Egyptian Mage, who conferred the instruction forming the major, or second, section of the book. In accord with the customs of his own people Abraham the Jew instructed his elder son in the philosophy of the Holy Qabalah, and upon his younger son Lamech conferred this system of Magic. Regardless of its origin, its date, and its authorship, all of which are challenged and criticized in this day, this work cannot fail to be of value to the sincere student, whether as an encourage- ment to that most rare and necessary quality-unshaken faith, or as presenting an assemblage of directions whereby to distinguish the true from the false magical systems. Abraham makes no impossible demands such as are perceived in fraudulent grimoires concerning the blood of bats caught at midnight, the fourth feather from the left wing of a completely black cock, or the stuffed eye of a virgin basilisk, and so on. Though perhaps some of the requirements set down by Abraham are a little difficult to follow, there is always an excellent reason for their statement, and they are not meant at all as subtle tests of the skill of the operator. Had S. L. McGregor Mathers accomplished nothing more for mankind other than the translation of this book from the French manuscript and thus placed its contents at the disposal of those students who are interested, he would still deserve our gratitude. And I may add that his translation is an excellent one, coherent, and expressing most sympathetically the thought of the medieval writer. It is only because this highly important book has been out of print for so many years and is at this day so difficult to obtain that I venture to give here a summary of the Operation which the book proposes. At the beginning Abraham warns his son against impostors."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"HORUS The Lo:d of Force and Fire. A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE This Magus, like a number of our modern contemporaries, was unfair in that he considered anyone who did not use his particular system to be a charlatan ; thougll it is probable that in his day there was just as much need for stringent warning against quacks as there is to-day. IIe then lays down the rule that the chief thing to be considered is \" Whether ye be in good health, because the body being feeble and unhealthy, it is subject to divers infirmities, whence at length result impatience and want of power to operate and pursue the Operation ; and a sick man can neither be clean and pure, nor enjoy solitude ; and in such a case it is better to cease.\" The true, that is the most convenient, time for cominencing this Operation, a time when all the forces of Nature are propitious to the effort, is the first day after the cclebration of the Feast of Passover or Easter, just about the time of the Vernal Equinox. Then the Sun commences its northward journey, bringing with it light, warmth, sustenance and grace, and the whole of the living world, plants, trees, birds and beasts, respond to its resurrection eagerly and joyfully. It is thus the most appropriate season for upward growth and interior development, wcll suited to the growth and manifestation of the spirit. The time necessary to bring the Operation to a successful conclusion is six lunar months, so that should it be commenced on March 22nd it would end about the Autumnal Equinox in September. The whole period of six months is divided into three definite periods of two months each, each period being characterized by the severity of self-denials, but mainly by the addition of further invocations, thus malting the concentration towards the Holy Guardian Angel more intense and fervent. There is a great deal of preliminary discussion as to the nature of the scene of the Operation. If possible it should be performed in the country where actualsolitude can be obtained. I say\" actual solitude\" advisedly, since, as all know, it is possible in the heart of a big city to isolate oneself from the rest of the world simply by withdrawing within. The solitude this book suggests is a physical retreat from the teeming life of town and city, mention being made that Abraham, Moses, David, Elijah, John and other holy men retired into desert places until they had acquired this holy science and Magic. The best place is, Abraham suggests, \" Where tllere is a small wood, in the midst of which you shall make a small altar, and you shall cover the same with a hut of fine branches, so that the rain may not"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"186 THE TREE OF LIFE fall thereon and extinguish the Lamps and the Censer.\" If recourse to a quiet wood is impossible, other suggestions are made. All magical works insist that much care and discrimination be exercised in the choice of a suitable locality wherein to carry on these operations. Apart from the considerations above enumerated, the Magician should ascertain that his chosen magical theatre is not on a site where witchcraft, for example, has been carried on, and that it has not been used for spiritualistic seances. It should be quite obvious that inasmuch as one of the results of Magic is to render the Magician's constitution more sensitive, he should not place himself in a position wherein that sensitivity could be invaded by disturbing and hostile influences. Numbers of quite ordinary in- dividuals are susceptible to atmospheres, and for the Magician particularly the place of working should certainly be free from any deleterious association so that the sensitive sphcre of conscious- ness may not be unduly affected. Mention is made by Abraham of the type of house required if the work is to be performed in a town or village, and emphasis is laid on the construction of the Oratory which is to be the really important chamber inasmuch as it is to serve as the magical Temple. From this Oratory a window is to open out on to an open balcony or a Terrace, as it is called, the floor of which is to be covered with a layer of fine river sand. Xow one of the things which more perhaps than any other item of furnishing impresses the beginner who reads Abramelin is that no nlention is made of a protective magical circle wherein the invocations are to be pursued, although in no uncertain terms numbers of demons and malignant spirits likely to be harmful to the Operator are referred to and described. This is so, because in this particular arrangement of the Work, the author is seeking to reduce the whole ceremony to fundamental principles with as few devices as possible, and the Terrace is assumed to serve in lieu of the 'Triangle wherein the spirits would appear after the Conversation with Adonai. Both the bedroom and the Oratory, being con- secrated over a long period of time by continual prayers and invocations and suffumigations, would perform the same function as 3 Circle, setting a natural astral barrier around the limits of the Oratory through the sanctity and security of which no demon could penetrate. It is for this reason that no visible symbolic circle is required, inasmuch as the effect of the continuous invocations will have so exalted the constitution of the Operator, and so elevated A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 187 the vibration of the inolecules in his various vehicles, that the entire astral and spiritual sphere will be purified to the extent that, as previously suggested, it will securely serve in itself as the real magical circle. It should be mentioned here for the benefit of students to-day who may think of engaging upon this Operation of Sacred Magic that these rules need not be scrupulously obeyed, so long as the essence and their spirit is followed. With only a little ingenuity is it possible to construct a whole new set of external circumstances favourable to the satisfactory execution of this conception of the Great Work. It must be clearly understood, however, that once devised and adopted this set of regulations, although clearly under- stood to be arbitrary, should be rigidly adhered to. In his magical poem Aha, Aleister Crowley gives a beautiful rendition of a possible variant of the scene of the Operation : \" . . . Choose tenderly A place for thine academy. Let there be an holy wood Of embowered solitude By the still, the rainless river, Underneath the tangled roots Of majestic trees that quiver In the quiet airs ; where shoots Of the kindly grass are green, Moss and ferns asleep between, Lilies in the water lapped, Sunbeams in the branches trapped -Windless and eternal even ! Silcilced all the birds of heaven By the low insistent call Of the constant water fall. There, to such a setting be Its carven gem of deity, A central flawless fire, enthralled Like Truth within an emerald.\" Within the consecrated Lodge or Oratory should be an altar built like a cupboard, above which, suspended from the ceiling, should burn a lamp of Olive oil. A brass censer should be kept on the Altar, and throughout the whole period of six months of the Operation it should never be removed from the Oratory. A robe"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"188 THE TREE OF LIFE of Crimson silk trimmed with Gold to reach down to the knees is required, and anothcr tunic of white lincn is also mentioned. \" As for these vestments there is no particular rule for them ; nor any especial instructions to be followed ; but the more resplendent, clear and brilliant they are the better will it be.\" \" You shall also have a wand of Almond tree wood, smooth, straight, of the length of about from half an ell to six feet.\" So far as concerns the pre- paration of all these things, the principles laid down in previous chapters apply just as well even although no mention of them is made by our author. During the first period of two months, the counsel is for the Operator to rise every morning precisely a quarter of an hour before sunrise, enter the Oratory, after having washed and dressed in clean clothing, open the window, and kneeling at the Altar which faces the window that leads on to the balcony, invoke the divine names of God with the will and mind extended. \" After which you should confess to him your entire sins.\" The latter injunction, of course, is simply to produce the tranquillity of mind and emotion necessary to the inspiration and illumination of the Angel. It is hardly necessary to dilate upon the fact that one who is perpetually bothered by the revolt of conscience or the memory of a previous misdemeanour is thereby prohibited from concentrating the mind with ease ; nor will his invocations be intense and one-pointed. Such a person would be well advised to refrain altogether from even contemplating a magical operation of this kind, for it would be bound to eventuate not only in the failure to invoke the Angel, but in disasters of the most catastrophic kind. The powers which attend the Abramelin operation have little use for meddlers. This calmness and serenity acquired, the Magician should supplicate the Lord of the Universe \"that in time to come He may be willing and pleased to regard you with pity and grant you His grace and good- ness to send unto you His Holy Angel, who shall serve unto you as a guide.\" It need not be stressed too much, I suppose, that Abraham was of the Jewish persuasion, and consequently was addicted to the prevail- ing-that is medieval-Jewish conception of personal Monotheism. The theological tinge given to this Magic by the Hebrew Adept, and which must have been inserted by him after he received it from Abramelin, can therefore be calmly ignored by the reader if he so will, since it has no part whatsoever in the true significance A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 189 of the Operation. Each student can intelligently adapt the tenor of Abraham's injunctions on this point to the magical theory of the universe as laid down here in an earlier chapter, or to his own particular religious beliefs. But I must emphasize that dogma and exoteric religious faith have no place at all within the Sanctuary of Magic. It must be impressed upon the reader that Magic is dependent upon rigid experimental principles as trustworthy and as exact as any science. Before commencing the Operation, it would be well for the Magician to formulate an oath that he will perform this sacred Magic, and to put it clearly in writing. The will and the deter- mination to succeed must be expressed in words, and these words by deeds. For, during the Dark Night of the Soul, when the spiritual eye is closed and all insight has departed, when the acolyte is weakened by temptation and distress of mind, it is only by adhering to the letter of the oath that the Magician may hope to bring this operation to a satisfactory climax. The direct expression of Will, in any event, is speech, and the recording of a willed determination in a written oath is in accord with the fundamentals of the magical philosophy. In the above exercise of prayer the one great point to observe, as Abraham himself impresses his son in the following words, is \" It serveth nothing to speak without devotion, without attention, and without intelligence. . . . It is absolutely necessary that your prayer should issue from the midst of your heart, because simply setting down prayers in writing, the hearing of them will in no way explain unto you how really to pray.\" Later on, too, he gives the counsel to his son Lamech to \" Enflame yourself with praying.\" Upon this injunction it is necessary to dwell for a brief space, as success or failure in the art of invocation will depend entirely on whether this advice is observed or not. To carry out a series of invocations several times a day over a period of six months, repeating the same invocation, confession and prayer during the first period twice daily, is indeed a task before which the Operator who is not confirmed by habit in this Way of Light well may baulk. Pause, reader, and reflect on what this implies I A simple piece of magical work persisted in for so long a period of time is actually one of the most arduous and tedious tasks ,conceivable. Only he who per- sistently can adhere to the letter of his oath assumed beforehand can hope to succeed. Yet these invocations should not be recited"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE in dull treadmill fashion, or in a tone of voice indicative of boredom, without fervour, sincerity or devotion. Such an attitude will defeat its own ends. Without these qualities in the invocation a common market-cry would be just as useful and have just as much or as little effect as any other. Every faculty of the Magician should be thrown into the work of invoking. Every power of soul should be exerted, every ounce of sincerity and enthusiasm and spiritual exhilaration should bc brought to bear upon the invocations which should issue from the very heart and soul of his being. During this first period, other injunctions are mentioned which must be scrupulously followed according to the writer. Some of them may appear rather trivial or even ridiculous ; but that final judgment must be left to the individual reader. I simply mention them for the sake of tolerable completeness. Both the bedchamber and the magical Oratory are to be kept in a state of absolute cleanliness and order, the whole attention of the Theurgist being given to \" purity in all things.\" Every Saturday the sheets of the bed are to be changed, and the chamber is to be thoroughly perfumed and incensed, thus impregnating even that room with the charge of sanctity, and expanding the confines of the Circle. The ingredients mentioned for the incense are a composition of Olibanum, Storax and Lignum-aloes, all reduced to fine powder and well mixed.' Abraham the Jew is quite firm, in addition, that no animal is to be permitted to approach or come near the house where the Operation is being carried on. There should be absolute solitude as far as is humanly possible. \" If you be your own Master, as far as lieth in your power, free yourself from all your business, and quit all mundane and vain company and conversation ; leading a life tranquil, solitary and honest. . . . Take well heed in treating of business, in selling or buying, that it shall be requisite that you never give way unto anger, but be modest and patient in your actions.\" These are common-sense rules with which no one, I believe, would cavil. Another suggestion proferred is that the Holy Scriptures may be read and meditated upon for two hours each day, the time being specially scheduled and put apart for that purpose after dinner, and no other task should be allowed to interfere or take precedence. Almost any devotional book would do if the student is not disposed towards Bible study, particularly that which l The proportions required for the blend are four parts of Olibanum, two parts of Storax, and one part of Lignunl-aloes.

This meditation will also provide clues assisting in the composition of the supreme rituals. So far as the ordinary habits of life are concerned, Abraham suggests moderation in all things, and eating and drinking and sleeping should not be overmuch or too little. None of the things engaged in by the Magician should partake in the least of super- fluity. On the subject which to most students of Magic and Mysti- cism is surrounded by a veil of obscurity Abraham advises in addition to the injunction of moderation that \" you may sleep with your wife in the bed when she is pure and clean \" and never otherwise. The sole question involved in celibacy is simply that of the conservation of energy, and nothing else. Since all the forces of the individual are being transformed by the Operation, and directed towards a noble spiritual end, any waste or leakage of the force which is so important on matters apart from that one end are thus grossly immoral, in the sense that they partake of folly and self-destruction. Few people during the Operation should occupy the house with him ; \" as for that which regardeth the family, the fewer in number, the better ; also act so that the servants may be modest and tranquil.\" Charity is suggested, also modesty concerning dress and clothing ; and all vanity should be severely shunned. Thus far for the first period. The tasks in these two months are comparatively easy, indicating but a simple meditative life, wherein repose and tranquillity are insisted upon. Twice daily, at sunrise and at sunset, when certain occult forces in Nature are at their ascendancy and at their purest, should the invocations be performed ; and the remainder of the day is to be spent in perfecting in various ways the concentration of the mind in fervour towards the \" Holy Angel who shall serve unto you as a Guide.\" The schedule proposed by Abraham can easily be supplemented by other items of Magic, conforming to the main aspiration, which the in- genuity of the individual may suggest. During this period, the Magician should devote all the faculties he has acquired through attention to other phases of the technique, towards strengthening the main aspiration. Banishing rituals may usefully be performed, and Rising on the Planes may prove a most useful adjunct to the invocations. The continual repetition of a sacred mantram, con- gruous to the Magician's conception of the nature of his Angel,"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"192 THE TREE OF LIFE should prove of no little help in keeping the concentration of the mind one-pointed. With the advent of the second period much the same procedure is followed except that the operator is exhorted to cause his in- vocations to be more intense and fiery, and \" ye shall lengthen your prayers to the utmost of your ability.\" The invocations are to be continued morning and evening as in the previous two months, but \" before entering into the Oratory ye shall wash your hands and face thoroughly with pure water. And you shall prolong your prayers with the utmost possible affection, devotion and submission ; humbly entreating the Lord God that He would deign to command His Holy Angels to lead you in the True Way.\" It is easy to perceive the psychological idea which Abraham gradually formulates. The invocations to the Holy Guardian Angel should be made the more frequent, ardent and imperious, so that when towards the end of the period of six months the counsel is given to the Theurgist to enflame himself with the invocation, the previous practice will cause him to fly like an arrow impelled from a bow towards the glory of the Angel, and no difficulty will be experienced in arousing the requisite enthusiasm and devotion which will bring about the Mystical Union. Other injunctions to be observed in the second period may be briefly summarized as follows. \" The use of the rites of Marriage is permitted, but should scarcely if at all be made use of.\" \" You shall also wash your whole body every Sabbath eve.\" \" As to what regardeth commerce and rules of living, as in the first period,\" but now \" it is absolutely necessary during this period to retire from the world and seek retreat.\" The observations previously made as to eating and drinking and clothing should continue to- be en- forced. As the second period draws to a close, and with it the fourth month of continuous invocation, the mind of the Operator should be gradually drawing to a single point by virtue of these modes of serene and calm living, and the increasing fervourwhich he is to insert into his invocations, now occupying greater periods of time. By this time also he will have entered that state of Dryness of which Mystics of all time have spoken, that horrid psychological state in which all the powers of the soul seem. dead and the mind's vision closes in dumb protest, as it were, against the harsh discipline of the oath. A thousand and one seductions will tend to lure the Operator A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE I93 from the contemplation of the end he has chosen, and a thousand and one means of breaking the Oath in spirit without breaking it in letter will be presented. And it will appear that the mind itself will run wild, warning the Theurgist that it were better for him to omit, for instance, a period devoted to invocation and do something else, profane and pleasurable. Constantly will it seek to frighten him with inordinate fears relating to health of body and the mind. Against all of these madnesses-fatal if he so much as succumb to one temptation-there is only one remedy, the discipline of the Oath taken at the beginning ; to continue in the labour of invoking for six months the Holy Guardian Angel. There is nothing to do but to go through the ceremonies and invocations, now temporarily meaningless and hideous, inasmuch as the spiritual sight is dark and the inner eye is closed. It may be that with the third and last period this \" Dark Night of the Soul \" will pass slowly and im- perceptibly, and then ivill arise the soft rose and pink grandeur of tlie Dawn, to be followed by the bright daylight of the Knowledge and Conversation, with the Beatific Vision and the Perfume so sweet and sustaining to sense and soul, of the Holy Guardian Angel. With the advent of the last two months, it is advised that the man who is his own master should leave all business alone, except perhaps works of charity towards his neighbour. Care, however, should be exercised even in the performance of so high a virtue as this, for the concentration and aspiration towards the highest mcst not be broken. \" You shall shun all society except that of your wife and of your servants. . . . Every Sabbath eve shall ye fast and wash your whole body, and change your garment.\" These rules concern the mode of life and conduct. But the advice which has reference to the magical aspect of the Operation is as follows : \" Morning and Noon ye shall wash your hands and face on entering (that is, of course, before) the Oratory ; and first ye shall make Confession of all your sins ; after this, with a very ardent prayer, ye shall entreat the Lord to accord unto you this particular grace which is, that you may enjoy and be able to endure the presence and conversation of His Holy Angels and that He may deign by their intermission to grant unto you the Secret Wisdom, SO that you may be able to have dominion over the Spirits and over all creatures.\" This is the procedure recommended for the last two months, by"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"I94 THE TREE OF LIFE which time most of the day will be spent in, as the Chaldzean Oracles also advise, \" Invoking Often,\" concentrating all the powers of the mind, body and soul together, focusing them by means of invoca- tion that thereby the Angel may appear and lift up the Theurgist to His greater and wider life. The third period of two months having been completed on the zrst of September, the Magician is to rise 011 the following morning very early, \" neither wash yourself at all nor dress yourself at all in your ordinary clothes ; but take a Robe of Mourning, enter the Oratory with bare feet, go unto the side of the Censer, and having opened the windows return unto the door. There piostrate yourself with your face ag,~inst the ground and order the Child (who is used in this system as assistant and clairvoyant, but unnecessary I think in the latter capacity if the operation has been carefully followed) to put the Perfume upon the Censer, after which he is to place himself upon his knees before the Altar ; follow- ing in all things and throughout the instructions which I have given you. . . . Humiliate yourself before God and His Celestial Court, and commence your prayer with fervour, for then it is that you will begin to enflame yourself in praying and you will see an extraordinary and supernatural Splendour which will fill the whole apartment and will surround you with an inexpressible odour and this alone will console you and comfort your heart so that you shall call for ever happy the Day of the Lord.\" Abraham, wise man and Mage that he was, does not burden himself, it will be noticed, nor the mind of his son to whom this magical technique is delivered, with any intellectual quibbling or any metaphysical enquiry as to the nature of the Angel. There is no discussion as to whether the latter enjoys an objective, that is independent, existence, or whether it inheres subjectively within the psychological structure of the Theurgist. He himself having gone through this training and reached its consummation in the Vision and the Perfume well knew the fallacy of intellectual bondage. And that one may assume is why he chose in preference to all other terms the very words \" Holy Guardian Angel,\" which are so palpably absurd from a rational point of view that no sensible person would dare engage in speculation concerning them. Thus intellectual bondage and the pit of error is avoided. The greater the strength and the enthusiasm of this act of faith in an irrationallv named and conceived entity the more efficacious is the crisis of the con- juration.

On the day of the Consecration, the Holy Guardian Angel will have appeared to the Theurgist and bestowed grace and splendour upon his soul, sustenance into his spirit, and flooded the whole sphere of the mind with an all-encom- passing illumination, which no words may adequately describe. Then follows, at the injunction of the Angel, aThree-Day Convocation when the Good and IIoly Spirits will be conjured to visible appear- ance on the Terrace, and entered within the domination of the renewed Will of the Magician ; and a second iliree days for the Evocation of the Evil Spirits. On the second day, advises Abraham, \" you shall follow the counsels your Holy Guardian Angel shall have given you and on the third you shall render thanks.\" \" And then you shall first be able to put to the test whether you shall have well employed the period of your Six Moons, and how well and worthily you sllall have laboured in the quest of the Wisdom of the Lord ; since you shall see your Guardian Angel appear unto you in unequalled beauty ; who also will converse with you, and speak in words so full of affection, of goodness, and with such sweetness, that no human tongue could express the same. . . .

Lie open, a chameleon cup, And let Him suck thine honey up ! \" So ends the most important section of the system advocated by Abrarnelin the Mage, who may well have been one of the greatest masters of Magic in the West. With perfect lucidity and sweet simplicity of spiritual conception, with clarity of expression and instruction, and no burdening of the mind with details and in- essentials, with symbols of purity and of cleanliness, Abraham the Jew brings the Theurgist gradually, step by step, up the wonderful ladder which is the Tree of Life growing earthwards from the Ancient of Days, towards the Ineffable Master. He is the Augoeides, Adonai, the Higher Self, the Holy Guardian Angel, call him what you will. And the illumination and spiritual glory which the Angel brings is so fair and holy and terrible a vision that in the devotee is induced a rapture, an adoration, a transport of ecstasy which is beyond all human conception and human speech. No saint or poet yet has been able to suggest more than a distant retreating echo of that incomparable experience. The attainment marks the com- mencement of the career of Adeptship, and it is only then, when the soul having been lifted up on high and seen things not lawful to tell, that the true nature of life may be seen. Infiltrated by a wealth of wisdom and bliss and clarity of the inward vision, then may the world be appreciated for what it is. Hitherto the eyes of the soul were closed, and blind, affrighted, and ignorantly dumb, the individual was whirled on the ever-moving wheel of life and pain. With the attainment of the angelic splendour, the centre of con- sciousness having been for ever exalted beyond the empirical ego, a flood of ecstasy causes the realization that it is only the Angel who is and always has been the Ego, the Real Self never previously known.

It may seem at first sight that such a section following upon the exaltation of the preceding section of the book is a descent from sublimity, and is in the nature of an anti-climax. It can scarcely be denied that the ecstasy and the high spiritual irreproachability of the Book is marred somewhat by the addition of these things to the impressive dignity of the Abramelin Operation. Aleister Crowley endeavoured at one time to provide a suitable rational explanation for it. \" There is,\" he argues, \" a reason. Anyone who teaches a new world must conform with all the conditions of it. It is true, of course, that the hierarchy of evil appears somewhat repugnant to science. It is in fact very hard to explain what we mean by saying we invoke Paimon, but, to go a little deeper, the same remark applies to Mr. Smith next door. We do not know who Mr. Smith is, or what is his place in nature, or how to account for him. We cannot even be sure that he exists. Yet in practice, we call Smith by that name and he comes. By the proper means, we can induce him to do for us those things which are consonant with his nature and powers. The whole question is therefore one of practice ; and by this standard we find that there is no particular reason for quarrelling with the conventional nomenclature.\" The method proposed by Abramelin for calling forth the Four Princes of the Evil of the World is by means of magical squares containing, in certain formations, various letters and names. These squares when charged and energized by the magical will set up a magnetic or electrical strain in the Astral Light to which certain beings consonant to that strain respond in the performance of acts ordered by the Magician. Apart from the Evocation of the Demons I99"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE on the Terrace there are squares designed and described by Abraham for the fulfilment of almost every wish which might occur to a human being. It is not intended to describe this final chapter of the Abramelin book containing the squares and practical formula of Evocation, inasmuch as the latter constitutes the least important branch of that system. In any event, this particular subject touches upon other magical writings which it was my wish briefly to describe. These works, like The Sacred Magic of Abramelin, have unfortunately been allowed to go out of print, and to all intents and purposes are practically unobtainable except by those who have access to a museum or a large library. It is my intention to touch upon them here because they deal with that branch of Magic which is placed in opposition to Invocation, and concerns the Evocation and control of planetary spirits and angelic beings. I wish to warn the reader, howevcr, and recall his attention to the fact that the pro- cedure laid down by Abramelin is the best. First there should be the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, and the~z the Evocations. And I only mention the latter in order that the reader may be cognizant of the entire formula, although I do not intend reproducing many of the practical instructions. Thc books referred to are by name Tlze Key of Solonzo~z tthe Ki~zg, The Goctia or Lesser Key of Sololno?z the King, and The Book of the Afzgel Ratxiel. The last-mentioned work unfortunately has never been translated from the Ilebrew into English. Of course, Icing Solomon, the model through the ages of the highest erudition and wisdom, was naturally the figure to whom the unknown authors of these works attributed their own compositions, so that the latter might be made the more impressive and authoritative. Not that this palpable fraud makes the slightest difference, for if the system is workable, then Solomon is as good or as bad a peg on which to hang the magical discourse and instructions as, for example, a hypo- thetical nonentity like Yossel ben Mordecai. Moreover, it irnplies a certain abnegation of the ego for an author to omit his own name and give credit to some other individual for his own work. The b001is themselves and the magical system within them constitute the matter of interest ; the authorship in these cases docs not matter at all. The ncccssity for tlie rites of Evocation is quite a simple one actually. Although the supreme object of Magic is the knowledge of the Higher Self, and although to will anything clse but this A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 201 supreme object is Black Magic, it is sometimes necessary to re- arrange both the materials and the scene of operations, as well as to make preparations for the improvement of the Ruach which is to be offered up in sacrifice to the Beloved. For different individuals at different times these preparations must naturally vary. Since the Ruacl~ is to be renounced and immolated on the sacrificial altarstone as an offering to the Most High, and since it denotes a certain cheapness and puerility of devotion to sacrifice a blemished victim, it may be necessary for some Theurgists to engage upon all sorts of practices for the attainment of ends which for others may be quite unnecessary. For instance, one student may find himself hampered with a bad memory which may hinder the sacred recollection of the Vision and the Perfume ; another may be in- capable of responding to certain emotional stimuli, and a third may find himself burdened with a stultified outlook upon life, whose poverty is altogether opposed to the intense generosity and the fecund abandon which is Nature's. The immediate magical task in such cases is to perfect the immediate vehicle through which the Holy Guardian Angel is to manifest. It is in vain that the elixir of life and the ambrosial wine of the high Gods is poured into a broken or dirty vessel, and an adequate remedy to these deficiencies must be sought. Ultimately, when there is the final surrender of the Ego in the mystical marriage with the Beloved, and the Ego is immolated upon the altar, no ugly complex will mar th ravish- ment of the spiritual ecstasy of union, nor will the sacrificid victim be deficient in aught that is pleasing to the Gods, or lac c any faculty to prove a handicap to the growth or the further life of the golden flower within his soul. Thus it may be found imperative to postpone for a while the Holy Guardian Angel Operation in order to provide suitable instruction for the Bride in her duties to the King's Son ; to devote oneself at the beginning not to the Magic of Light but to the Evocations of the Goetia. Various parts of the mind and soul may be so faulty as to require special magical effort for their stimulus and repair-that is, when ordinary secular methods have proved of no avail. In such cases it i'? germissible and legitimate to engage in a preliminary attention to he rites of Evocation, so that by its means every faculty of the ldividual may resume full and normal functioning. Some of the entities, for instance, referred to among the Seventy-two Hierarchies of The Lesser Key of Solomon tlze King may need to be evoked to enhance the emotional faculties,"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"202 THE TREE OF LIFE to benefit logic, reason, memory or some other department of thought and mind. Thus, when the Goetia advises that the spirit named \" Foras \" teaches \" the arts of logic and ethics \" it means that through the stimulation of a certain aspect of the mind resulting from a particular kind of magical operation, the logical faculties are improved and stimulated. I should like to call attention to a magical hypothesis giving legitimacy to the continued use of the evocation of angelic and planetary beings antecedent to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. It holds that the pursuit of the arts of Evocation may be for the purpose of filling in the gaps in the ladder by which the soul may climb to the heights of heaven. It is by this method that the Theurgist acquires a solid four-square base to his pyramid of attainment. It is useless, argue the pro- ponents of this system, to contemplate so exalted an edifice as the apex of a pyramid soaring high in the clouds unless the foundation is very firmly established beneath the ground, to serve as a sure unshakeable base and support for the aspiring spirit. So long as the aspiration of the soul is pure, clean-motived and unsullied by the mere selfish desire for power, then little harm can come to the Magician in pursuit of the Evocation technique, provided, of course, that the ordinary precautions of thorough banishing and con- secration of both Circle and Triangle are attended to. But by this method, it is said, the Magician imitates the working and progress of the whole of Nature. In her, his great guide and exemplar, he sees that no step towards growth is taken suddenly without long preliminaries or preparation of some sort ; all proceeds orderly and harmoniously and gradually, step by step, with proper care and sequence and gradation. It is this harmony and order which he seeks to bring to his own work. At the bottom of the superstructure must he commence his work, building each brick to be incorporated into his great pyramid with the utmost care, zeal and devotion, placing layer upon layer, missing no single level upon which the tower should ever mount. Gradually, as his broad pyramidal base of accomplishment proceeds, and it towers both within and above upon 3 firm foundation, made secure by the evocations and sustained by his aspiration, he tends to discard the lesser things, as their necessity becomes less obvious, and becomes more one-pointed and devout until the culmination of his efforts overflows into the supreme attainment. In this case, the attainment is grounded upon A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 203 a solid base, one not built on shifting sands and which the merest breath of wind could overthrow ; the Knowledge and Conversation is rooted in the very spirit and body of the whole being, and no danger is there at all of an illumination obsessing him with a fanatical idea, or overthrowing the balance of his mind. The rationale of the powers conferred by Evocation and the reality of the spirits is not very far to seek, if one glances at pathological psychol~gy for a brief-moment. The phenomenon of Evocation may be compared to a subtle neurosis or complex present in our minds, which we find ourselves unable to throw off or dispose of unless by some means we are enabled to define it clearly and ascertain its cause. This knowledge gives it a precise conscious and rational form, which may then be frankly faced and banished for ever from the mind as a persecuting and troublesome impulse. The psycho-analyst is unable to assist a particularly bad ncurotic patient suffering from a severe neurosis until he has delved into the Unconscious by means of his technique, and discovered the cause for the existence bf the conflicts typified by those neuroses. This examination of the contents of the mind, or of some portion of the mind and memory, gives clarity and coherence to the underlying neurotic cause, and the patient seeing clearly the form and cause of the evoked psychosis is thus able to dispel and banish it. So long as the complex is a hidden subconscious impulse, lurking without shape or form in the Unconscious of the patient, yet possess- ing sufficient force to disrupt conscious unity, it cannot be properly confronted and handled. The same subjective rationale may be extended to the Goetia aspect of Magic, the evocation of the spirits. While within the constitution of the Magician there lie hidden, uncontrolled and unknown, those subconscious powers or spirits which confer the perfection of any conscious faculty, the Magician is unable to confront them to the best advantage, examine them or develop them, to modify one and banish another from the entire field of consciousness. They nust acquire form before they may be used. By a programme of Evocation, ho~vever, the spirits or subconscious powers are called forth from the deep, and, giving them visible shape in the Triangle of manifestation, they may be controlled by nieans of the mnemonic system of transcendental symbols and brought within the dominion of the spiritualized Will of the Theurgist. So long as they are intangible and unformed one cannot adequately deal with them. It is only by giving tliem"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"204 THE TREE OF LIFE a visible appearance, by means of the incense particles, and evoking them into the magical Triangle that the Magician is able to dominate them and to do with them as he so desires. The subjective theory here used is highly convenient in providing an easily understood explanation of this phenomenon of Evocation. For the spirits may rightly be likened to the idea-content or the subconscious- thought-content of the mind, functioning unseen, unheard, and without form in the dark abysses of the mind. The bestowing upon them of a tangible form by an imagination propelled into a prodigious activity by the process of Evocation, enables the Magician to subdue the inchoate horde of undisciplined thoughts, passions and memories which they are, thus bringing form and order to the hierarchy of spirits, and subordinating the wealth of their particular knowledge and energy to his Will. This alone constitutes the reason and necessity for the undertaking of Evocations, prior to having attained the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, which is the supreme and major ritual of Magic. At once this rationale provides a definition of the two principal divisions of Magic as well as a distinct classification of the hierarchical spiritual entities. Invocation implies above all else the calling into the Circle of the human sphere of consciousness, which is the definition of the Magical Circle, of a God or the Holy Guardian Angel. In this higher form of Magic no exterior triangle is needed, for the Magician, both Circle and Triangle in one being, is desirous of mingling his own life with and surrendering his own being to the greater life of a God. The Triangle implies manifestation and duality, the separation of a lesser being from the Theurgist. In Invocation duality is an unmitigated curse ; the purpose of that aspect of Theurgy being to eliminate duality. The Evocation, on the other hand, is the deliberate conjuration or the calling forth of an incomplete or lesser entity into the Triangle of manifestation which is placed away from the circumference of the Circle. The definitions of the two major figures are very important and useful, and should, I think, always be remembered. The Circle is the sphere of consciousness; one, integral and complete. The Triangle re- presents manifestation and separation, and it is therein that a being of darkness is brought into light from the hidden confines of the inner circle. A God may be presumed to be a complete and har- monious idea ; coherent and absolute within its own sphere, an all-encompassing macrocosm to which the Magician, who is a A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE microcosm, unites himself within the protected limits of the Circle. On the other hand, a spirit or an intelligence is a lesser being, and although by definition it is a semi-intelligent force of Nature, it is an idea which is neither complete nor well-developed, and comprises but a limited and partitive consciousness. In the case of Evocation, the spirit is evoked into a Triangle bounded and protected by divine names, placed on the outside of the sacred Circle, and the Magician within the Circle stands in relation to the spirit as a Macrocosm and a superior being. Just as the invocation of a God floods the human consciousness with an ecstatic surge of the divine light and life, so does the Theurgist stand as a God and energizer to the spirit. The purpose of the evocatio~l is, in short, that some portion of the human soul which is deficient in a more or less important quality is made intentionally to stand out, as it were. Given body and form by the power of the imagination and will, it is, to use metaphor, specially nourished by the warmth and sustenance of the sun and given water and food that it may grow and flourish. The technique is the assimilation of s particular spirit into the consciousness of the Theurgist, not by love and surrender as is the case in the Invocation of a God, but by superior command and imperious gesture of Will. By this assimilation, the wound of Amfortas is healed, the deficiency is remedied, and thc soul of the Theurgist is stimulated in a special way, according to the nature of the spirit. The first of the three books concerning Evocation with which I propose dealing here, is The Key of Solomo~z tlze King. This book, by far the most notorious of all books of magical instruction, in 1889 was translated by S. L. McGregor Mathers into English from Latin and French texts. He himself, I am informed, was highly expert and successful in the use of the method given, and adapted from it for the use of his own students a scientific summary covering the process of Evocation in all its branches. It was the translator's view that in this work was the fountain-head and central storehouse of Qabalistic Magic. In it must be sought the origin of a good deal of the ceremonial Magic of medieval times, when Tlte Key was valued by the best occult writers and magical practitioners as a work of the highest authority. That it served as instruction, and furnished Eliphas Levi with the clata upon wliicli Transcc?zdentaZ Magic was based, is more than probable, for it should be evident to anyone who has studied Levi at all carefully that the Key of Solomon"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"206 THE TREE OF LIFE the King was his principal textbook of study and practice. Although he does not render open acknowledgment of his obligations in so many words, yet it is to this work that he refers in his florid remarks concerning the Clavicles of King Solomon. His Ritual of Tran- scendental ildagic cites an invocation which he attributes to Solomon, this ritual having a certain, although not exact, similarity in con- struction and tenor to the first conjuration of the Key, reproduced in the last chapter of this work. The Key as a whole, with the exception of several thoroughly despicable chapters which cater to the animal lusts of depraved ignoramuses, and which probably are later interpolations into the text, is one of the most practical systems of technical Magic extant. Its chief interest lies in the Evocation of the planetary spirits or regents. The obscure question as to whether there actually was a Hebrew original has been raised on several occasions, and both P. Christian in his Histoire de la Magie and S. L. McGregor Mathers were of the opinion that if there has been a Hebrew document from which the Latin and French renditions were made it has since been lost. Waite is more or less inclined to doubt that there was a Hebrew text, and other sceptical writers believe that it is simply a medieval forgery, mention of Solonlon and a Hebrew author being made simply to provide for credulous minds additional authority for whatever merit and validity the book possessed. In recent years, however, a Hebrew manuscript was discovered by Dr. Herman Gollancsz and a facsimile reprint was issued by the Oxford Univer- sity Press in 1914. After an examination of this work published under the title of Sepher Maphteah Shelomo, which is the Hebrew of The Book of the Key of Solomon, I cannot admit that, despite the fact that the English work in translation bears the same title, there is a necessary connection between the two. Their contents are quite different. The magical system expounded by The Key of Solomon the King is objective in the extreme, being rooted in the existence, inde- pendent of one's own consciousness, of the Gods or Angels abiding in the planets. Its raison d'ztre is the postulate that their being invoked by man is a distinct possibility, and that they may be made subject to his sovereign will. The magical philosophy postulates the existence of a spiritual entity which is the soul or nournenon behind the visible sliell of each planet. It is the governing regent or guardian in much the same way as the soul in man is the hidden A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 207 metaphysical reality functioning in the depths of his being. This is of course the objective view, and in developing this theory, the ancient systems attributed to the Gods of the planets hierarchies of lesser spirits and intelligences and elementals, tlie administrators of celestial motion and activity. A chart in classification of these entities is provided on an earlier page. It is comlnon knowledge that the days of the week have an astrono~nical significance, axid that Sunday is the day of the Sun, Monday the day of the Moon, Saturday the day of Saturn, and so on. By this arrangc~ncnt, as has been taught by Astrology, on some one particular day the influence of a given planet and its Regent predominates and exists in a more powerful form than on any other day. This classification is carried even farther in The Key, and the medieval Magicians systematically conceived that cei-tain hours in the day rnight be under the direct influence of the planets also. Hcnce there is provided in The Key a comprehensive list of the planetary hours, showing what particular hours on the seven weekdays are attributed to what planets, and the names of the Angels who are rulers during the course of the hour. Thus to render effective the evocation of a planetary ruler, or its spirit and intelligence, a ceremony should be performed not only on the correct day of the week, such as Wednes- day for Mercury, but during the corrcct hour. Inasmucfi as Mercury is attributed to the Eighth Sephirah on the Tree of Life, its signifi- cance in number is eight. Its appropriate hour would consequently be the eighth hour which, according to the table, is named Tafrac, and would be peculiarly susceptible to things Mercurial. On the eighth hour of the day of Mercury, which is Wednesday, enlploying such herbs, incenses, colours, seals, lights, forms, and divine names as are consonant and congruous to the traditional nature of Mercury, the Magician is thus the more easily enabled to stixnulate the creativity of the Imagination, and evoke either from his own mind or the Astral Light, the idea or spirit pertaining to that grade or hierarchy called Mercury. Having written the appropriate con- jurations, the ceremony is performed. The Magician, enshrouding himself astrally with the form of the God who is attributed to the same Sephirah of which Mercury is a correspondence-but not uniting himself with tlie form, in the event that only a spirit or intelligence is required-and forcibly directing a powerful stream of Will-force upon the sigil of the spirit, invokes the God, beseeches the Archangel and conjures the Angel that the appropriate spiritual"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"208 THE TREE OF LIFE entity may be constrained to manifest without the Circle in the consecrated Triangle of Art, in accord with the seals and other sympathetic consonants employed. Althougll this technique is not fully explicit in the Key-inasmuch as the crude method described there would be comparable to a small boy asking his father to give him some pocket money-experience and tradition have demon- strated that the Egyptian methods harmonize very well with the Qabalistic one of the Key, and are more conducive to the production of the desired results. There are chapters in the book carefully elaborating the essential qualities of the planets and the variety of different operations which pertain more distinctly to one than to some other, although all these instructions are supplemented by the principal counsel to perform every Operation when the Moon is waxing strong, in the days between its birth and its fullness. Thus the evocation of the forces of Mars in the days and hours of Mars confers courage and energy and will-power, while the times appropriate to the Sun, Venus and Jupiter are well adapted to any operations of love, of kindliness, and of invisibility. Operations for the acquisition of an abundance of eloquence, scientific knowledge, prophecy, and the ability to divine, would come under the scope of Mercury, and so on as have been laid down in astrology. The illngzls cnumcratcs the angels relating to the twelve Zodiacal Signs, and the times most propitious for their evocation would be on the day and hour of the planet ruling or exalted in that sign. The exact method of con- structing tlie magical Circle is given at some length, as also thc manner in which it should be specially consecrated. I might add that although the Key affirnls that the Circlc should be traced in tlle earth with the magical knife or sword, the modern Theurgist may draw the Circlc with its appropriate colours on a virgin length of canvas or on the floor of his Temple, whether it be tile, parquet, or linoleum, afterwards tracing it in the air with sword or wand. One fact rendering the Key one of the most unique and impel-tant magical works available is that it furnishes excellent illustrations of the Pentacles and seals appropriate to the seven planets, necessary for use as Lamen and sigill~ during the ceremonies, also showing how they should be constructed. When the Moon is in an airy or earthy Sign, during the days and hours of Mercury, is the most propitious time for the making of the pentacles and seals. The Magician should also have a special chamber, if possible, sct apart A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 209 for privacy where, after the proper consecration and suffumigation, the pentacles may be constructed either on metal or on clean unused paper. \" These pentacles are usually made of the metal the most suitable to the nature of the Planet . . .

They may also be made with exorcized Virgin paper, writing thereon with the colours adopted for each Planet, referring to the rules already down in the proper Chapters, and according to the Planet with which the Pentacle is in sympathy ; wherelore unto Saturn the colour of Black is appropriated ; Jupiter ruletll over Celestial Blue ; Mars over Red ; the Sun over Gold, or ttlc colour of Yellow or Citron ; Venus over Green ; Mercury over Mixed Colours (usually Orange, according to thc best Qnbalistic traditions), the Moon over Silver or the colour of Argentine Earth.\" A similar series of regulations arc given with regard to the robes and habiliments to be ceremonially worn by the Master of Art and his assistants. Each particular instrument to be used-wand, sword, dagger, etc., and all such accessories as incense, parchment for the seals, wax for the pentacles or talismans, and the silk cover- ings for the sigillx-are to be carefully exorcized so as to render them pure, following which they should be consecrated to the work under consideration. The system, in short, is a very complete method, giving several invocations and conjurations which eventuate in the evocation unto visible appearance of the desired spirit, and with a little ingenuity the Magician can utilize its scheme for almost any purpose. The actual procedure, briefly, of the Operation may be summarized as follou~s : First, there should be the consecr~~tion and preparation of the weapons, instruments, and the construction of the Circle. After a thorough banishing, let the Magician utter a general Oration or Invocation to the Lord of the Universe or his own Higher Self to give legitimacy to the operation. Instances of such a preliminary anthem will be provided in the final chapter of this book. This completed, the form of the God appropriate should be astrally assumed so that the Mask completely enshrouds the Magician in Imagination, although this need not be pushed to the extent of identification. A general conjuration should follow reciting the authority by which the Magician works, and enumera- ting the powers which in the past have been productive of great results by other hlagicians. By this* time, the consciousness of the"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"210 THE TREE OF LIFE Magician should have begun to exalt itself by reason of the burning of the incense, the psychology of the robes, the lyricism and the intoxicant value of the invocation with its long reverberating list of barbarous names and the enumeration of wonders and commands and imprecations, in addition to the bewildering effect, as it were, of the lights, figures and seals. The climax of the operation, the spirit's manifestation, then occurs almost automatically. The Key 1 of Solomon, then gives more or less the correct procedure until, when the Spirit has appeared in visible form and has obeyed the Magician, the License to Depart and the banishing ritual should once again be recited to close the entire ceremony.

He writes : A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 211 \"Therefore when you would consecrate any Place or Circle, you should take the prayer of Solomon used in the dedication and consecration of the temple ; you must likewise bless the place by sprinkling with holy water and with suffumigations, and commem- orate in the benediction holy mysteries ; such as these, the sancti- fication of the throne of God, of Mount Sinai, of the tabernacle of the covenant, of the holy of holies, of the temple of Jerusalem ; also the sanctification of Mount Golgotha, by the crucifixion of Christ ; the sanctification of the temple of Christ ; of Mount Tabor, by the transfiguration and ascension of Christ, etc. And by invocating all divine names which are significant to this ; such as the place of God, the throne of God, the chair of God, the tabernacle of God, the altar of God, the habitation of God, and the like divine names of this sort, which are to be written about the circle or place to be consecrated. \"And in the consecration of instruments, and every other thing that is used in this art, you must proceed after the same manner, by sprinkling with holy water the same, by fumigation, by anointing with holy oil, sealing it with some holy seal, and blessing it with prayer, and by commemorating holy things out of the Sacred Scriptures, collecting divine names which are agreeable to the things to be consecrated; as for example, in the consecration of the sword we are to remember in the gospel, ' he that hath two coates ' etc., and that in the second of the Maccabees, it is said that a sword was divinely and miraculously sent to Judas Macca- beus ; and if there is anything of the like in the prophets, as ' take unto you two-edged swords ' etc. And you shall also in the same manner consecrate experiments and books, and whatsoever of the like nature, as writings, pictures etc., by sprinkling, perfuming, anointing, sealing, blessing, with holy commemorations, and calling to remembrance the sanctification of mysteries ; as the table of the ten commandments, which were delivered to Moses by God in mount Sinai, the sanctification of the Old and New Testa- ments, and likewise of the law, prophets, and Scriptures, which were promulgated by the Holy Ghost ; and again, there are to be men- tioned such divine names as are convenient to this ; as these are, viz., the testament of God, the book of God, the book of life, the knowledge of God, the wisdom of God, and the like.

It was through their agency and by them that to Solomon was imparted that super- lative wisdom and spiritual knowledge which legend claims was his. Opening the book as a proem is a definition of Magic in these terms : \" Magic is the Highest, most Absolute, and Most Divine Knowledge of Natural Philosophy, advanced in its works and wonderful opera- tions by a right understanding of the inward and occult virtue of things ; so that true agents being applied to proper Patients strange and admirable effects will thereby be produced. Whence Magicians are profound and diligent searchers into Nature ; they, because of their skill, know how to anticipate an effect, the which to the vulgar shall seem to be a miracle.\" With Waite's judgment that The Goetia concerns itself with Black Magic I beg to differ. My own opinion is that Waite is inclined to dismiss as Black Magic any technical method which obtains outside the consecrated adytum of his own organization. The system out- lined by Francis Barrett in the section of his book entitled Ceremonial Magic is in reality based upon the Key and the book at present under discussion as well as upon Agrippa's de Occztlta Philosophia. Several of the rituals that he gives are taken word for word, and with only a few minor alterations and additions, from The Goetia. Although hardly to be compared with Abramelin in the matter of sublimity and power of spiritual conception, The Goetia nevertheless is a system which is comparatively easy both to understand and to operate. For here too the Magician is not burdened with such impossible fantastic demands as bat-blood, parricide skulls and virgin kids or lambs. All that the Operator must observe in order to achieve A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 213 success are a few more or less elementary rules.

I reproduce herewith one type of the Circle and Triangle which The Goetia recommends. The Hebrew words around the Circle are the names of the Sephiros with planetary attributions, the appropriate Divine Names, Archangels and Angelic choirs. The greater part of the book is concerned with a close description of the Spirits and their hierarchies. The Seventy-two hierarchs are classified into various grades : Kings, Dukes, Princes, Marquises, and so forth, comprising good, bad and indifferent natures. In the economy of Nature they have their own particular function, a specific task to perform, and when evoked and controlled by the Invocator and his symbols confer a certain faculty, power, or kind of knowledge as was previously explained. Several methods may be employed in their classification, inasmuch as their number may be distributed among the Four Elements, or referred to the Seven Planets, or to the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac. The strange-looking seals provided in The Goetia as representing the signatures of the Spirits should, during the ceremony, be worn on the breast of the Magician, on the reverse of the Pentagram engraved on a lamen of metal in accord with the rank, dignity and character of the Spirit to be called forth to visible appearance. Thus, the sigil of a King of Spirits is to be engraved on a lamen of gold ; whereas a Duke's sigil should be on copper ; that of a Prince on tin ; while silver is to be the material of the lamen for the evocation of a Marquise. By this method, the characters of the spirits are shown by the metals employed in the construction of the lamen. Of a Solar dignity are the Kings ; Venusian are the Dukes ; the Princes are Jupiterian, and pertaining to Luna are the Marquises. Special seasons and occasions are to be observed for the conjuration of the spirits, for \" thou shalt know and observe the Moon's Age for thy working.

There is Amaimon at the East, Corson at the West, Ziminiar at the North, and Goap at the South, and a specific cardinal quarter should be faced by the Magician, the Triangle also pointing in the same direction, in consonance with the ruler of the Spirit to be evoked. It is not to be assumed for one moment that these spirits referred to in The Goetia are mere elementals, nature spirits, or semi-intelligent forces performing the mechanical burden of Nature ; on the contrary, most of them are stated to have a large retinue or sub-hierarchy of subservient elemental spirits in attendance. One may assume them to be the so-called elemental kings whose function in the natural order of things is only secondary to the governance of the chief planetary gods or angels. In point of fact, Blavatsky proffers the suggestion in The Secret Doctrine that by no means are the kings or Gods of the elementals to be confused with the blind and brutal elemental spirits themselves. The latter at best are simply used by the bright elemental Gods as luminous vehicles and materials with which to clothe themselves. The description of Paimon, for instance, is that he teaches all arts and sciences and other secret things. \" He can discover unto thee what the Earth is, and what holdeth it up in the waters ; and what Mind is, and where it is ; or any other things thou mayest desire to know. He giveth dignity, and confirmeth the same. He is to be observed towards the West. He is of the Order of Dominions. He hath under him two hundred legions of Spirits and part of them are of the Order of Angels and the other part of Potentates.\" The Goetia also attempts the description of the manner whereby he makes his appearance in the Triangle of Art where evoked. Accompanying him in his visible manifestation \" there goeth before him also an Host of Spirits, like Men withTrumpets and well-sounding Cymbals, and all other sorts of musical instru- ments.\" Another lesser entity is Botis who is both a President and an Earl of Spirits and when evoked \" he telleth all things Past, and to Come, and reconcileth Friends and Foes.

Among the numerous seals provided in this book of magical instruction there is also a Pentagram to be used as a sigil during any magical operation, for the purpose of protecting the Operator from dangerous spirits, and also to restore his confidence in the power of the Will. The illustration facing page 168 gives the design of this figure. It is to be worn on the Magician's breast as a lamen, the reverse side bearing the Seal of the particular spirit to be evoked. At various stages in a ceremony this sigil should be borne aloft in the hand to the cardinal points, where the Magician recites a demand to the Spirits to render obedience to the sigils inscribed within the Pentagram. Furthermore, Tlze Goetia illustrates a Hexagram which should be painted on parchment of calf's skin, to be worn at the skirt of the mantle or short chasuble. The instructions accompanying the design are to the effect that this figure should be covered with a cloth of fine linen, white and pure, and \" is to be shown unto the Spirits when they do appear, so that they be compelled to take human shape upon them and be obedient.\" The type of Hexagram is reproduced in full colour facing page 214. Little known to magical students in these days, inasmuch as it has never received English translation, is a book entitled The Book of the Angel Ratziel. By Jews during the last couple of hundred years it was regarded as a sacred trust, and even to-day among a corrupted quasi-mystical sect called the Chassidim- formerly incorporating very fine spiritual teaching and aspiration -the book is greatly venerated. One of their Rabbis informed the writer that when a member of his congregation is ill, a copy of this magical work is immediately delivered to the sick bed that it may be placed beneath the pillow. It is a collection of magical writings and visions, not particularly impressive, most of it distinctly crude, purporting to date from the Adamic paradise, although there is enough internal evidence to warrant the belief that at least three different writers at no very early date contributed individually to its contents, the whole being synthesized by a skilful hand. At one time it was fairly easy to obtain, though nowadays, however, it is seldom that a copy is procurable. Like all the Jewish angelic names, the word \" Ratziel\" is a composite word, yielding when analysed the phrase \" The Angel of"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE M~tery,\" who is conceived to be the divine author of the magical mysteries communicated to Adam, the first being to receive this knowledge. Its tradition follows almost exactly that of the legend of Qabalistic orthodoxy, that driven out of Paradise which was barred to him by an Angel bearing a flaming sword, Adam in exile delivered the book to his son, who revealed it to Enoch. Enoch passed it on to the succeeding gencrations of patriarchs until, finally, it culmi- nated as the reader may have anticipated in the delivery of its mystery to Solomon the Icing who, by its means, acquired all knowledge, wisdom and wealth. The work as a whole is divided into three major sections, although there are shorter supplements giving the reader complex though ambiguous formulz for amulets, and some rather amusing-looking talismans and incantations, with highly elaborate instructions for their use and correct employment. A great deal of space is given over to the study of Angelology, from which a large number of later writers have drawn, and at the beginning there is advice concerning the visible evocation of these angels, the instructions varying accord- ing to the day, hour, month and season. Towards the close of the book there is a long prayer or invocation, apostrophizing God in an exemplary Hebrew manner as the King, going through the entire alphabet a number of times in order to describe Ilis distinctive attributes, all of which are phases of some particular force and function of the universe. As a system of magical technique it compares very unfavourably with the two books previously men- tioned so far as the actual nzodzts ofierandi and tenor of philosophic writing are concerned. The first part of the book, which alone wiII be considered in these pages since its latter sections are comparable to The Goetin and The Key already described, is unique for this reason. It attempts to describe the entire organization of heaven, or the several strata or planes of the Astral Light. The essence of the vision is a description of heaven to which Xoah was carried by two angzls of fiery sspect, although very little of this is impressive as adding to present knowledge or in providing one with new information elucidating that which lve already possess. One heaven, the third, is character- ized by the Seer to be the home, as it were, of the souls or inner gods of the Sun and the Stars, the former being attended by numberless phcenixes, which symbolize regeneration and im- mortality. Noall was attended by four hundred angels who, each A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"218 THE TREE OF LIFE evening, removed his crown to take it to the Lord of the Heaven, and returned it each morning when they themselves would crown him. Hosts of angels, armed with glittering swords for the judgment of mankind and the messengers of the decisions of the Most High, were seen in the fourth heaven, and simultaneously these armed spirits sang and danced to God with the accompaniment of cymbals. His vision extending to the fifth heaven revealed to Noah four different orders of Watchers who, while grieving over their fallen one-time fellow angels, were still singing and continually sounding four different kinds of trumpets in praise of God. In the sixth heaven were resplendent legions of angels, more glittering and splendid than the Sun when it shines at its fullest strength. There were archangels too, and in this heaven Noah saw how all things were ordered and planned, with the prototypes of all living things and souls of all mankind. In the midst of the glorious vision, he saw seven archangelic creatures, each with six wings, singing in absolute unison. The highest heaven was seen as a fiery light, crowded with archangels and incorporeal beings and powers, and there was also the face of God ablaze with celestial light, emitting sparks of the purest fire and flame. A great deal of the confusion characterizing amateur visions and attempts at Magic can largely be attributed, I think, to the omission of some such preliminary device as the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, with the result that despite the Seer's purity and high-mindedness the sphere of perception is invaded by whatever entities happen to be in the astral vicinity. Not always is obsession or elementary possession the culmination of failure to banish properly, but because undesirable entities pass without hindrance before the inner vision there is no continuity or consistency in the vision. Hence in recording them the Seer, more or less fearful of trusting to his own discrimination in such high matters, writes the whole vision together with the inessentials. This is the case in a number of instances, and it is only when the astral sphere is un- usually strong and radiant with a spiritual light through which no astral entity dare intrude, unless it be with the Seer's permission, that visions may be safely undertaken without the preliminary protective banishing. There is another matter of cautionary importance to be mentioned in the event that the reader is desirous of putting these things to the test. In making use of the seals and sigils displayed in such"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 2x9 works as The Book of the Angel Ratziel and The Magus, a great deal of danger is involved, principally because of the gross errors and misprints in Hebrew which have been perpetuated. Whether they are accidental or due entirely to the ignorance of copying scribes is hard to say. It is not difficult to realize that if the object of the seal is to set up a strain in the Astral Light to which a corresponding entity hastens to respond, then a mistake in the textual inscription will cause a similar mistake in the type of astral strain. The result will be that the effect will be far different to that anticipated, even detrimental and dangerous. This calls above all else for knowledge and the ability to ascertain whether mistakes exist and how to correct them. At the risk of making the injunction odious to the reader, it must be reiterated that a knowledge of the Qabalah is indispensable to the practising Magician. With Gematria, Notariqon and Temurah-the three methods entailing the esoteric use of number-should he be acquainted ; likewise with that aspect of philosophy which treats of the symbolism of Hebrew letters, the magical alphabet of symbols, names, numbers and ideas which attaches to the Thirty-two Paths of Wisdom. While there are a multitude of gross mistakes apparent in the sigilla: and Hebrew print which Barrett displays, nevertheless the English letterpress given is quite accurate and useful, and this could be consulted by the serious reader to great advantage. Waite's Secret Doctrine in Israel or his Holy Kaballah are perhaps the finest works obtainable giving a thoroughly good outline of the doctrinal content of the Qabalah. Cornelius Agrippa's works on Magic, Liber 777 and Sepher Se$hiroth of Aleister Crowley, and my own Garden of Pomegranates, will be of great use in providing the fundamental alphabet with the correct attributions necessary to the understanding of the seals and symbols. Now there is an important comparison between the processes of Magic and Yoga which I wish to consider. This comparison is well worth consideration, inasmuch as it has been argued herein that Yoga should not be posited in opposition and in superiority to Magic, but that these two systems constitute together what may be termed Mysticism. If we assume that our correspondences with the magical hierarchies represent facts in Nature-and not for a moment can there be my real doubt-the philosophic rationale which may be referred to Magic as I have here described it is not removed a very great distance from that of the Way of A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"220 THE TREE OF LIFE Royal Union as described by some such authority as Swami Vivekananda. At some length has it been expatiated here that to the Sephiros of thc Tree of Life various cosmic Gods are attributed, high beings who are the intelligent regents and guiders of the evolutionary processes ; to each God is subordinated an appropriate hierarchy, the immediate messengers who are Angels, Archangels, Spirits and Intelligences. Not only does this scheme of classification apply to the hlacrocosm, but also to the microcosm. The basis of the Tree of Life has been so elaborated as to refer not only to cosmic develop- ments but also to the various parts-psychic, mental and spiritual --of man himself, thus focusing the whole field of universal activity within man's own organism. To the Tree as a whole the twelve Zodiacal signs and the Seven Planets are attributed. Considering man as a microcosm of the great stellar and cosmic universe, then all the planets, elements and forces have course in him, and even the signs of the Zodiac are clearly represented in his nature. The energy of the Ram is in his head ; the Bull gives laborious endurance and strength to his shoulders ; the Lion represents the courage of his heart and the wild fire of his temper, while the knees, helping him to spring, are under the sign of the Goat. This, as an example, supplies the basis for a subjective theory both of ontology and epistemology ; the universe exists only within the consciousness of man, is conterminous with that consciousness, and its laws are the laws of the mind. In my former work A Gnrdele of Ponzegraltates a diagrammatic correspondence was drawn between the cosmic Sephiros, the various Parts of Man, and the Chakras or the astral nerve centres which exist in the psycho-spiritual department of man's constitution. Further attributions in the light of the preceding speculations immediately open themselves. As examples of these, describing whither my speculations tend, the following may be noted. The Anahata Chakra, which is the centre located in or near the physical heart, being a correspondence of the sixth Sephirah of Harmony and Equilibrium, is thus in direct correspondence with such sacred Essences as Osiris, Helios, Mithra and the self-glittering Augoeides. Thoth and all his divine attributes of Will and Wisdom enters into a perfect correspondence with the Ajna Chakra situated in the centre of the forehead above the eyes ; while the highest chakra of all, the resplendent lotus of the thousand petals, the Sahasrara"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE Chakra located at the crown, wherein Adonai disports himself, is in complete alignment with Ptah and Amoun, the hidden cosmic essence, the secret creative centre of both the macrocosm and the microcosm. The adoption of the subjective theory carries with it far-reaching conclusions, and a true understanding of this point of view will bring within conscious realization the oft-times glibly uttered statement that within man exists the entire universe and the vast concourse of universal forces. Now my theory is that to invoke Artemis and Chomse and to have connived to unite oneself with the Essence those names represent, for example, is to have accomplished a task of supreme importance which is identical, because of our correspondences, with the awakening of the forces of the Muladhara Chakra, thus setting in motion the serpent Icundalini in her ascent of the Tree of Life to the Crown. Whereas the one system obtained its results through ritual and invocations, the other obtained success through concentration and meditation. To have achieved through magical invocation an indissoluble identity with the supernal wisdom of Tahuti is to have gained the power clearly to see through the interior eye of True Wisdom, inasmuch as it is tantamount to a stimulation through meditation of the Ajna Chakra, the organ of spiritual clairvoyance and the Creative Will. Also to have united the individual consciousness through the rites of Theurgy with Asar-Un-Nefer, and to have been assimilated into his glory and ineffability, is comparable to having guided the Kundalini -~p the Sushumna to the brain, and aroused the forces potential in the Sahasrara Chakra. In Toga proper, as may clearly be perceived in such a work as Vivekananda's Raja Yoga, or in the approximately European adaptation of its fundamentals, The Way of Initiation by Rudolph Steiner, the results of that system-in so far as concerns the formula- tion and vivification of the Chakras-are produced almost entirely by the exercise of the Will and Imagination. Time and time again do these, and other authors, write \"Imagine a flame or a white triangle in the heart \" or \" a lotus above the head,\" and so on. The arousing of the coiled splendour of the Kundalini in the spinal chambers of the Muladhara Chakra is encompassed by intense concentration and the imagining of a new kind of spiritual activity in that region, causing the sleeping serpent goddess to straighten her coils and dart up the Sushumna to the seat of her Inner Lord.

With the vitalizing of the Chakras as with the invocation of the Gods followed by the evocation of the administrative spirits, various powers of tremendous strength and potency may be conferred upon the Practitioner. Those which Tlze Goetia attributes to the Spirits include a spontaneous growth of a hitherto dormant knowledge of science, philosophy and arts in their widest connotations, and an upwelling of the finest emotional faculties which will draw all men to one's central fire. The powers described by Patanjali in the Yoga Sutras as being conferred by Samyama on some Chakra or idea are almost identical with those given to the Magician as the outcome of The Goetia evocations.

Moreover, the serpent of the Ruach should be scotched beyond recovery, and it must be killed that the presence of the Angel may not be restricted. Then may the powers be taken, and being taken be used as the Angel sees fit. In both Yoga and Magic it is the consciousness aspect of meditation and the God invocations which is the most important aspect of work. If powers happen to come to the practitioner- well and good. But it is the expansion of the individual conscious- ness to infinite extent, and the discovery of the real centre of life which in both technical systems is the primary and sacred goal. Properly and honestly pursued, with a pure and single aspiration, Magic can lead the soul to the utmost heights of the Tree where it receives, according to Iamblichus, \" a liberation from the passions, a transcendent perfection, and an energy entirely more excellent and participate of divine love and an immense joy.\" And in addition the expansion of consciousness confers \" truth and power, rectitude of works and gifts of the greatest goods.\""},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEEN HERE a number of individuals are desirous of par- ticipating in a composite magical ceremony wherein all of them may play an active rBle, there is a form of group-ritual devised for this particular purpose, called the Dramatic Ritual. Thus each person participating contributes will-force and energy towards the creation of a spiritual manifestation. Nearly all the Mysteries of ancient days assumed this form, and the Initia- tion rites of the secret fraternities of every age were conducted according to this principle. It is an extremely well-known fact that rituals are particularly useful in matters of initiation. It is equally well corroborated that such ceremonies played a prominent part in the magical mysteries of Tibet where the acceptance of a lnlzoo was celebrated by a rite consecrating the disciple to the perform- ance of the Great Work. The history of the Buddhist-Yogi Milarepa is perfectly clear on the important point that at the hands of his Guru Marpa he received several ceremonial initiations, when various deities and spiritual powers were invoked into a Circle, or mandala, wherein he stood. In addition it is commonplace knowledge that the candidate for Brahmanical initiation witnesses a purifying and consecrating ritual. That there were initiatory rituals in ancient Egypt is also too well known to demand overmuch emphasis, and rumour of magical ceremonies in Egypt have come down to us enriched with many suggestive details and significant items of information. In point of fact if the underlying principle of the group Dramatic ritual, whether initiatory or magical, is the conse- cration to the Great Work and the exaltation of consciousness, then we have incontrovertible evidence that similarly conceived cere- monies were enacted throughout antiquity. The basic principle is identical with that of all magical ritual, the invocation in one sense or another of a God. But in the case of the dramatic ritual the method proceeds through an =sthetic appeal to the imagination, depicting in dramatic form the current 223 A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"224 THE TREE OF LIFE of major events in the life history of a God, and occasionally the terrestrial cycle of an ideal man-or God-man, such as ~ionysius, Krishna, Bacchus, Osiris, etc., one who himself attained that wisdom and spiritual plenitude of which the Theurgist likewise is in quest. Living in the atmosphere, created anew, and repeating the deeds performed by the God is a most excellent method for exalting the soul above. This idea is named the principle of Commemoration, and is an integral constituent of all magical ceremony. From de Occulta Philosophia it is abundantly evident that Henry Cornelius Agrippa, and those from whom he derived his knowledge, under- stood perfectly the theoretical principle involved in this form of Magic. It demands the rehearsal of the character of the God to be \" invoked, or a repetition of the events occurring in the life-cycle of his mundane emissary. Not only should this principle enter into the accredited Dramatic ritual, but every aspect soever of magical ceremony, whether performed by an indivihual or a group, should be marked by the enthusiastic repetition of a series of highly signifi- cant incidents in the history of the God, the rehearsal thus serving to give added magical authority and emphasis to the dual process of consecration and invocation. Even in so comparatively trivial an aspect as the preliminary preparation of the weapons and instru- ments Agrippa rightly recommends the repetition of holy deeds ; and as an instance of the commemorative principle which he advo- cates, the following procedure from The Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy for the consecration of the water may be advantageously cited : \" So then, in the consecration of water, we ought to com- memorate how that God hath placed the firmament in the midst of the waters, and in what manner that God placed the fountain of waters in the earthly Paradise . . . also how Christ was baptized in the Jordan, and hath thereby sanctified and cleansed the Waters. Moreover, certain divine names are to be invocated, which are conformable hereunto ; as, that God is a living fountain, living water, the fountain of mercy, and the names of the like sort.\" The reader may also notice the commemorative form of The Goetia ritual quoted in my last chapter. The invocation attempts to trace the authoritative words which were employed in the Scriptures for the accomplishment of certain deeds. It is not a particularly good example of this type of ritual, however. The Baccha of Euripides is a first-rate instance of what form a complete dramatic ritual should assume. The ritual should so be constructed"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 225 that each celebrant plays a part, without at the same time making the action of the drama scattered and incoherent. The rules of theatrical Art and drama apply perfectly to the construction of these rituals. The historical evidence at our disposal demonstrates clearly that the annual \" passion-play \" of the life of the great God Osiris, King of the Tuat, was really a complex dramatic ritual invoking him, a commemorative ceremony involving the repetition of almost every act which occurred to Osiris in the course of his legendary life on earth among men. Underlying this celebration and all other similar types is the invocation of a God, or the Avatara in whom He dwells, and by means of this dramatic rehearsal the Theurgist seeks to exalt his imagination and consciousness so that it may culminate in the ecstatic crisis of divine union. For the individual whose zsthetic and poetic sense is highly developed this species of cere- mony is by far the most effective. It is perfectly evident that a symbolic representation of what was formerly an actual spiritual process in a highly revered Personality cannot but assist in the reproduction of the Union by placing the Theurgist in sympathy and magical harmony, through the effect upon his imaginatiorl, with the upward trend of the play towards the supreme goal. In short, the Theurgist imagines himself in the drama to be the God who himself has suffered similar experiences, and the various parts of the play and the rituals recited serve but to render more complete the identification. It is this fact which led certain generations of not highly initiated Magicians to adopt for ceremonial use actual masks, grotesques and legitimate theatrical artifice. We have here the central theme of dramatic ritual, whether we choose as our exemplar the Mass of the Roman Catholic Church, the performance of the Adeptus Minor Ritual of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the Third Degree of Freemasonry, or the ceIebration of the Dionysian revels as adumbrated in The Baccha. In each case the life of an enlightened Adept is rehearsed in full ceremonial form ; that is to say, the history of a being whose consciousness has been made divine is magically celebrated. The method of enactment portrays a man who dies actually or mystically, and accomplishes his own resurrection as a God, radiating forth divine wisdom and power.

The dramatic ritual which the Egyptians performed for the invocation of Osiris at Abydos was a play which seems to have consisted of eight acts. \" The first was a procession in which the ancient god of death, Upwawet, made straight the way for Osiris. In the second the great deity himself appeared in the sacred barque, which was also placed at the disposal of a limited number of the more illustrious of the visiting pilgrims.

This event seems to have taken place during the third act, which was an allegory of the triumphs of Osiris. The fourth depicted the going out of Thoth, probably in search of the divine victim's body. Then followed the ceremonies in preparation for the burial of Osiris, and the march of the populace to the desert shrine beyond Abydos to lay the god in his tomb. A great battle between the avenging Horus and Set was next staged, and in the final act Osiris appeared, restored to life, and entered the temple of Abydos in triumphal pro~ession.\"~ Not only were there the Mysteries of Osiris, at which time the myths attached to the god were rehearsed, but group rituals for the invocation of Isis, Hathor, Amoun and Pasht and ihe others were celebrated without reference to any human individual whose relation to them was that of avatar. In the Catholic Mass the divine life and ministrv of the Son of the Christian God is celebrated, then the crucifixion of their Saviour, and His final resurrection in glory, and the subsequent assumption into heaven. In earlier days this celebration of the Mass was attended by gorgeous processions and mystery pageants of great splendour and pomp ; though it must be confessed that with the magical technique absent the whole external array counted for little.

Its purpose, too, is that through sympathy acting upon a refined imagination the Theurgist may identify himself with the exemplary consciousness of which Rosencreutz was the symbol, and whose history is being rehearsed before him. In one scene, the most important and eloquent in this ritual, the chief hierophantic officer is seen lying as though dead in the Pastos or mystical Tomb. By means of prayers and invocations the Adept is symbolically resurrected from the grave in fulfilment of the prophecy of the great founder. At the solemn hour of resurrection, when the Ceremony reveals the rising of the Adept as Christian Rosencreutz from the Pastos where he was interred, the Chief Adept utters triumphantly : \" For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth. I am the Way, the Truth and the Life ; no man cometh unto the Father but by Me. I am the Purified ; I have passed through the Gates of Darkness unto Light; I have fought upon Earth for Good : I have finished My Work ; I have entered the Invisible. I am the Sun in his rising. I have passed through the hour of cloud and of night. I am Amoun, the Concealed One, the Opener of the Day. I am Osiris Onnophris, the Justified One.

Let the White Brilliance of the Divine Spirit descend ! \" This paan of ecstasy is not to be construed as a mere speech of fine-sounding words. If the Adept have properly performed his magical work, and have perfectly shrouded himself with the proper magical form, and identified himself with the God's consciousness, then the other participants in the ceremony will experience an exaltation proceeding parallel to the triumphant address. The most customary forms of the dramatic Ritual as applied to Initiations proceed roughly somewhat in this manner. Following his entry into the outer chambers of the Temple of Initiation, where he is immediately blindfolded with a hoodwink, clothed with a black gown and bound thrice around the waist with a cord, the Neophyte is led by a Guardian to the stations where are presiding Officers at the cardinal points.

The Neophyte circumambulates the Temple several times, during which the Officers who are in the future to be his magical instructors, and who also represent the high beneficent Gods, demand of the Neophyte state- ments of his aims and aspirations. This procedure automatically recalls one's attention to the Book of the Dead, where in Chapter CXLVI and those subsequent to it, the Angels and Gods in charge of the sacred Pylons or the great stations to be passed by the deceased on his way to Amentet, demand of the latter his business. In answer to his response that the guardian's name is known-with the knowledge of which the name is but a symbol-and that he comes to make response to Thoth, hence to seek the supernal wisdom, they each in turn give him permission to proceed. \" Pass on, says the Watcher of the Pylon. Thou art pure ! \" There is to be seen in the British Museum an excellent initiatory ritual entitled \" The Mystery of the Judgment of the Soul,\" recon- structed by M. W. Blackden from those chapters in the Book of the Dead which deal with the deceased's ascent to the Hall of Judgment, and his beatification in the Island of Truth. It demonstrates in an extremely fine manner that it may well have been that the texts which have come down to us under the title of the Book of the Dead were fragments of an initiatory ritual used in the days when Egypt was flourishing with the Priest-King-Adepts at her helm. The Golden Dawn Ritual of the Neophyte likewise has incorporated in it very similar Egyptian elements. In that ritual various officers, representing the cosmic Gods, retard the progress of the Neophyte in his circumambulation of the stations of the Temple. \" Thou canst not pass me by, saith the Guardian of the West, unless thou canst tell me my Name.\" And the answer on behalf of the candidate is made : \" Darkness is Thy Name ! Thou art the Great One of the Path of the Shades.\" To which the injunction is proffered : \" Child of Earth, fear is failure. Be thou therefore without fear ! For in the heart of the coward Virtue abideth not ! Thou hast known me, so pass thou on ! \" As the ritual proceeds with many such challenges and responses various points of magical instruction are given, followed by consecrations by fire and water, thus purifying the"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 229 Neophyte for the further journey. These consecrations by the ~em~lk representatives of the ~od~at the cardinal points prepare for the accomplishment of the Great Work. By means of invocations the celestial forces from beyond are infused into the being of the Ne- ophyte, endowing him with courage and will to enable him reso- lutely to persevere unto the end. Then the hoodwink, cord and black garment are removed, giving place to a white robe or sash flung round the shoulders to symbolize the purity of life and the loftiness of aspiration which has come to the candidate. The consecrations at an end, and the invocations of the essences completed, certain knowledge fundamental to Magic and the philosophical alphabet is imparted under a vow of secrecy. This, as a whole, and omitting a large number of inessentials and trivial variations, constitutes the basis of the initiatory ritual of the Neophyte. Without, however, the pursuance of practical magical work on his own behalf these initiations and rituals are of no avail whatso- ever to the Neophyte. That they do serve as preparation is true, and they do also impart a certain consecration and sacramentalism rendering his task more comprehensible and perhaps less perilous by their virtue. In confirmation, it will be remembered that Milarepa after his initiations was at once counselled by Marpa to commence practical work, which in his case was meditation and concentration. To the student prepared either by training or by some peculiarity of birth-which, in any event by reason of rein- carnation implies a former attention to these things-the ceremonial initiation has a distinct effect in bestowing upon him a brief though resplendent vision of the spiritual goal which he seeks and which he he now dimly envisages. This is particularly so, if the officers of the Temple are hierophants not in name alone but in actuality, well versed from a practical point of view in the magical routine and technique. For when an officer in the Temple rehearses the part of a God, if he be acquainted with magical technical methods, he will assume the Form of that God so perfectly that the magnetic emana- tions from the God in him flow forth into the innermost soul of the Neophyte. This assumption of God-forms as previously described can be carried very far, even to the extent of actual transformation, and authentic instances are on record where the Neophyte, when sufficiently sensitive, sees in the distance of the Hall not simply a human being arbitrarily acting as a hierophant, but a gigantic divine figure, glowing and awe-inspiring, of the God whom the man A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE ceremoriially represents. When, as I have also stated, the hiero- phants are trained Magicians, as they were in the days of ancient Egypt, the Initiation of Keophytes is no meaningless formal service but a ceremony of the utmost reality and power. This concerns initiatory rituals. The dramatic ritual in which no question of Initiation is implied is very similar in conception and execution. Several individuals rehearse in concert for their own mutual benefit the life of a God, and by means of repeated invoca- tions, commemorating in speech and action incidents and happenings in the history of that God, succeed in calling forth the God into a consecrated area. By following the magical technique, and in exalting themselves sufficiently beyond the normal dualistic plane of consciousness, an abiding union between the participants and the divinity takes place. The Bncclze is an outstanding example of a Greek dramatic ritual. In fact, from a cerenlonial point of view it is all that a dramatic ritual should be in form. So excellent is it that those who find interest in it to-day do so because of their feeling that it is a splendid theatrical tragedy. With an initiated company of individuals well acquainted with invocation, working sympathetically one with another, and exerting Will and Imagina- tion in the prescribed magical form, the play may be transformed into a most puissant dramatic invocation of Dionysius. The rhyming verse translation by Professor Gilbert Murray is a classic master- piece of creative poetry rather than a literal translation from the Greek, and it conveys most faithfully the religious atmosphere and the dithyrambic spirit of Bacchic worship. There is, in this play, a supplication of the God in the exalting style so typical of all invoca- tions : \" Appear, appear, whatso thy shape or name 0 Mountain Bull, Snake of the Hundred Heads, Lion of Burning Flame ! 0 God, Beast, Mystery, come ! . . . \" Bearing on the same magical theme, there is a splendid hymn to Dionysius, from The hilystical Hyn~gzs of OY$/ZCZIS, translated by Thomas Taylor : \" Come, blessed Dionysius, various-nam'd, Bull-fac'd, begot from thunder, Bacchus fam'd.

Without the latter nothing at all can be accomplished. The astral technique of Rising on the Planes, investigating the symbols by vision, the formulation of the Forms or Masks of the Gods, and the vibration of the Names, as well as the celebrations of some form of Eucharist, these are necessities in the Way of Magic. True, a vast amount of patience is required. But that is true of all things which are worth while in any way or form. Day by day must the Theurgist continue in these practices of invoca- tion and ritual before he arrives at the stage where he feels that he has the power at his control. In fact, the major essential to success in all forms of Magic-whether dramatic ritual or anything else-is perseverance. No matter what else is accomplished, the Magician should cultivate patience. To a pre-arranged programme of magical work, let him steadfastly adhere without dismay. The course which he has laid down and sworn to perform represents the logos of his Will, from which he dare not deviate one inch or the fraction of an inch. Fears and doubts alike will certainly assail him. Friends and enemies alike will threaten peace of mind and serenity of soul, and attempt their utmost to disturb his spiritual equilibrium with much idle gossip of the danger of Magic and the insecurity of its results. The whole host of heaven, to make but little mention of the myriad legions of the pit, will conspire and be loosed against him. Only if he gives up, discarding his vow and rejecting his aspiration, is the Magician irrevocably lost. Horrid disaster looms ahead ! Once the magical vow is taken to succeed, he must resolutely persevere without regard to whatever happens. If death overtakes him in the progress of his work, let him nevertheless go on and on, from one life to another, with soul well concentrated and the spiritual gaze fixed firmly on the heights, swearing a mighty oath to continue that work. Levi once remarked that the Magician must work as though omnipotence were his and that eternity-were at his disposal.

Hardly known at all in these days and seldom referred to, it occurs in a little book entitled The Book of the Heart Girt with the Serpent, by Aleister Crowley. Although I hold no brief for this poet I nevertheless believe it to be one of the most exquisite and profound yet penned. The quotation below will serve as an instance of both its prose and ideas with regard to the question now under consideration. \" There was also an humming bird that spake unto the homed cerastes, and prayed him for poison. And the great snake of I<hem the Holy One, the royal Uraus serpent, answered him and said : I sailed over the sky of Nu in the car called Millions-of-Years, and I saw not any creature upon Seb that was equal to me. The venom of my fang is the inheritance of my father, and of my father's father; and how shall I give it unto thee ? Live thou and thy children as I and my fathers have lived, even unto an hundred millions of generations, and it may be that the mercy of the Mighty Ones may bestow upon thy children a drop of the poison of eld. \" Then the humming bird was afflicted in his spirit, and he flew into the flowers, and it was as if naught had been spoken between them. Yet in a little while a serpent struck him that he died. \" But an Ibis that meditatedupon the bank of Nile the beautiful god listened and heard. And he laid aside his Ibis ways and became as a serpent, saying, Peradventure in an hundred millions of millions of generations of my children, they shall attain to a drop of the poison of the fang of the Exalted One. And behold ! ere the moon waxed thrice he became an Uraus serpent, and the poison of the fang was established in him and his seed even for ever and for ever.\" It is this sublime spirit of indomitable will and determination that nothing can overcome which, to the Magician, is indispensable. It is the power of Will which de facto constitutes the Magician, and without that power nothing of any consequence can ever be accom- plished. Attainment is not encompassed within four and twenty hours, nor within several settings of the sun ; the Vision resplendent and the Perfume which consumes the very substance of the soul may lie several years in the future--even many incarnations in the vague darkness of time to come.

For the soul grows and progresses as comprehension and intuition expand through successive acts of the spirit on the road of the Magic of 'light. The wings then grow stronger, the flight itself grows longer, and the inner lamp fed on the oil of wisdom remains con- stantly burning. That light within must the Magician ever regard, and carry it patiently with him into the byways and highways of men, until he becomes that light. What is required first of all is that imperturbable aspiration and indomitable Will ; then work ! Let the Magician aspire to be like the wise Ibis bird of Khem.

Daily should the Theurgist rise on the planes seeking to ascend higher and higher, and to fight his way into the translucent spheres of the limpid light of the Fire. The passing of every season will see his aspiration growing stronger, presenting him with the force to pursue his task of magical conquest and union. All things must be brought within the scope of his Will. The highest heavens, and the lowest hells too. On the lowest denizens of the astral must that Will be imposed, and to his every wish and domination must they bend the knee. Resting upon the Magician, obviously, is a tremendous responsi- bility, increasing with every step forward that he takes, and with the passing of every hour in his career. \" Nature teaches us, and the Oracles also affirm, that even the evil germs of matter may alike be made useful and good.\"l Hence the responsibility devolving as a sacred trust upon the Magician is this.

And this is the redeniption of the world. Very soon our whole being circles around an invisible Sun of splendour, and we are drawn more and more to it, like a steel to a magnet. Though it may be zons before we at last come nigh, yet we feel as perhaps Adam must have felt if he had seen flickering through the darkness of the exile in which he struggled the shining of the Heavenly Paradise, and knew that it was not really lost but, after his purification, it would be given him a little to ~valk and enter in. To have this surety is no little thing. It is a vision not lightly to be envisaged. Though inevitably we must fail and fall time and time again, there are hours and minutes of delight and joy when the angels of the heights begin to wear again in our sight their ancient aspects of glory, and we are melted in the heat and fire of ecstasy and gladness, knowing that we, the dead for centuries and long ages, may yet rise again."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEEN T HE theoretical relationship which modern Spiritualism occupies in connection with Magic is bound at some time or other to be questioned. Some answer, consequently, must be here provided. Only a brief discussion of this matter will be entered upon, inasmuch as it does not seem to the writer to be of particular importance. A few words alone will suffice to show in what guise that relationship exists. Although some previously may have thought otherwise, there is no actual connection between the phenomena of Spiritualism and those which occur in Magic. But one word separates the one from the other. A word, however, which is a great gulf fixed between the two. 1 ! All spiritualistic phenomena of trance and materialization are passive. They are altogether beyond the conscious control of the medium who, in no way at all, is able to modify, alter or even fix the time of such phenomena as occur to her. (From force of habit one says \" her.\" Automatically a medium is conceived to be a woman. Exceptions there are, of course.) The Magician, on the other hand, endeavours so to train his Will that nothing happens in his Operations of Light without its use. Whatever he does in Magic is performed consciously, deliberately, and with full intent. The only important exception to this occurs when the Will has developed into such a mighty thaumaturgic engine that the whole organization of the Magician has become utterly identified with that Will, and all phenomena of form and consciousness occur automatically withits extension. Its working may be likened to the movement of any limb or muscle which, although taking place outside conscious volition, is nevertheless accomplished by the force of Will. Even so far as concerns what is vulgarly called \" materialization,\" the Magician controls the apparition of a spirit. Not only so, but he may cause that spirit to appear through his conjurations and to limit its activities to a certain prescribed area through the power of his Will. The visible form of the spirit is A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"236 THE TREE OF LIFE composed of the coarse smoke-particles of incense, deliberately burned for that purpose. In addition, the Magician has the power of causing that spirit to answer questions intelligently, and of banishing it when no longer is there necessity for its presence. This is, let me repeat, only so far as concerns the lower aspect of the work, inasmuch as Evocations are universally recognized to partake of the lesser grades of Theurgic technique. What then of the Magic of Light ? This also is in accord with the magical Will. When there arrives that supreme crisis in the Invocation when the ego is rendered passive to the advent of the Bridegroom and, fear- fully and with trembling, it surrenders its own being, that abdication is according to a conscious and willed determination. These few remarks should suffice to show conclusively that the two orders of phenomena lie altogether on different planes and that no connection exists between the two. Spiritualism seems concerned almost entirely with the production of physical phenomena for their own sake, and in any event these are hardly conducive to any sort of proof for the survival and continued existence of the soul. The other system, Theurgy, concerns itself with a noble realm and with the development of great powers in man. The Magician seeks to conjoin his essence with a deep, abiding reality, aspiring to a spiritual knowledge, that he may apprehend with wisdom and intuition his supreme immortality, incorruptibility and eternity. To discuss Spiritualism intelligently it is necessary to return to fundamental principles laid down on an earlier page. Theurgy conceives the removal of the enclosing sheaths from the soul after the death of the physical body in very much the same way as does the Theosophy of Madame Blavatsky. Following the death of the body, which is the visible vehicle of the higher principles, the Real Man, perfectly intact though minus the physical body, is thrust on to the Astral Plane. Gradually he ascends to the several Palaces which have been self-created by the mode of the life just passed ; Palaces wherein he rests before the Ancient of Days, assimilating his earthly experience, and building them into faculty for a further incarnation. Magic, following the Qabalists, embraces the philo- sophic idea of the Reincarnation or Gilgolent of souls. Indeed, so far do Magicians go in the direction of this philosophic theory that they claim that at certain stages of development, when the human organism by repeated consecrations and invocations becomes luminous, refined and sensitive, the recollections of the Nesclzamah"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 237 with its higher emotions and powers infiltrates the Ruach, bringing with it the clear memory of existences of the past. After physical death, the trinity of principles which is the Real Man remains on the Astral enclosed within the Ruach and its Nephesch. Disintegration, having already been set in motion by the occurrence of physical death, continues yet further. The Nejhesch, which is the vehicle of the passions, emotions and in- stinctual processes, is then sloughed off from the constitution. It remains, however, as an entity on that plane, animated to a certain extent by the forces and blind energies with which it comes into contact. Slowly but steadily it disintegrates if left to itself, until just as the physical body is resolved into the dust of the earth so is the Nephesch resolved to the elements of the Astral Plane. For this reason, the Theurgists prohibit visions and experiences in this lower astral realm. Nothing of spiritual value may there be found, inasmuch as it is the world of decaying Ne#heshic matter and dis- integration. The Nephesch discarded, the Inner Man enclosed in the Ruach \" rises \" to the middle strata of the Astral, where slowly the essence of the finer thoughts, the nobler experiences and emotions are distilled from the grosser parts, and are assumed into the very nature of the Nesclzamah. This separation of affinities at an end, they are assimilated and expanded in the divine Astral, Amentet. It is necessary at this moment to mention the use of the verb \"rise \" and other verbs employed in a similar sense. Needless to say, a metaphysical sense is implied, inasmuch as the subjective planes of the invisible worlds are not placed one on top of the other like the storeys of a skyscraper ; nor do they surround the other like the layers of, for instance, an onion. Being metaphysical, all the worlds interpenetrate and intermingle with all the others, and the physical or the outermost world is thus penetrated by the innermost and the subtlest spheres. Rising on the Astral, therefore, though a misleading term l~erally, is intended to convey that fact of departure from a grosser plane, and making an ascent to a more rarefied and less dense world. Now the magical tradition when applied to Spiritualism is that it is with the astral corpses or the Qliphos, as they are termed, that Spiritualists mainly occupy themselves. Through the passive and negative trance, the higher principles are forced to withdraw, leaving no link with or protection to the lower vehicles of the medium. The door is left open for the admission of whatever A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"238 THE TREE OF LIFE entities are in the astral vicinity. Since the souls of men and angelic beings ascend to the divine Astral, the greater part of those entities on the lower astral are the grosser elementals, the adminis- trators of natural phenomena, and the decaying Qliphos or averse cortices. Hence the negative Spiritualistic trance fundamentally implies obsession from the decaying remnants and filthy remains inhering on that plane. The question may follow upon this : \" Why, if spirits who communicate with mediums are mere astral shells, is it that occasionally there is a display of intelligence and reason ? \" The word \" occasionally \" is very gratifying. One of the facts most always referred to by investigators is the absence of coherence and intelligence in the messages obtained from \" the other side.\" In the event, however, that a faint glimmer of intelligence is seen in the verbose nonsense usually given to mediums, the rationale provided by Levi is clearly applicable. It will be remembered that Levi defines the Astral Light as the magical agent, and that in its substance are recorded every thought, emotion and deed. The astral body, an aspect of the ATe$hesch, being composed of the subtle matter of the Astral Light, partakes of Levi's definition. On a previous page, I have indicated the connection between the formal academic conception of the Unconscious and the Qabalistic concep- tion of the Nephesch, of which the astral body is one aspect. In this vehicle, then, are recorded all the thoughts which an individual thought during life, all the perceptions and sensations which he received, and all the actions which he performed. When, after death, this discarded Nephesch is galvanized into the activity of a seeming living being, animated by intelligence, through the energy displaced both by the medium in trance and the thoughts of the sCance sitters, this astral corpse can display a replica of the intel- ligence which in life used it. This broad outline accounts for most of the communications received through Spiritualistic sources, although it must be stated in all fairness that to this, as to all other, generalizations there are exceptions, though mediums able to penetrate to the higher planes of the spirit are extremely rare. The medium, once she has opened the door of her astral and psychic organization, is unable to control herself. Nor is she able to exert discrinlination as to what shall or shall not enter by the open door and take possession of her person- ality. Naturally, these remarks have sole reference to those cases where the phenomena are genuine. Inasmuch as there are so many"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE cases of deliberate fraud and trickery, the above statements are also adequate to provide an explanation. Being a passive, the medium has no control of the power to produce phenomena when the psychic current is cut off, as it were ; and when the phenomena are required of her through the receipt of money, it is quite a simple matter to simulate genuine possession. It is simpler still to utter a rigmarole of nonsense which compares favourably with the messages received from the \" departed.\" Moreover, because the obsessing entity is of the lowest and of the pit earthy, its association with the medium can hardly be considered elevating or ennobling. It is bound to be a deteriorating influence, causing whatever evil tendencies or traits are in the medium to expand and develop. Thus fraud, moral decay and profligacy are matters of no great exertion. An explanation of the more general physical phenomena, so much a part of Spiritualism, may have been anticipated here, but since the magical theory on this subject is in complete accord with that of Blavatsky, there is little need to repeat those theories at any length. Suffice to note that most of the psychic demonstrations, when genuine, have their origin in the behaviour and the powers of the astral body. The substance of this vehicle having been defined as plastic, magnetic and of great tensile strength, it follows that various of its members, due to abnormal development, may be exuded from within the physical body and stretched out some distance. This theory explains apportation of objects without physical contact, the phenomena of the Poltergeist, and many others of a similar character. Nearly all are due to a disturbance of equilibrium in the substantive aspect of the Ne9hesch. They, quite obviously, are not spiritual and prove not one of the claims made by Spiritualists on their behalf. In the case of the high-minded medium who, realizing the in- herent truth of the above remarks, is desirous of turning her passive powers to account, the magical technique can be recommended. In Spiritualism there is no technique of trance ; nor are there protective or selective methods to be employed. Once the astral door is left ajar haphazard, whoso will enter may do so without restraint. The medium is as open to obsession, and even more so because of the nature of the astral plane, as to divine inspiration. With the assistance, however, of some such device as the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, this predisposition to elementary obsession is easily obviated.

The recitation of a suitable invocation of a divine force, and the astral assumption of a God-form anterior to the trance, may ensure an altogether different category of result, one indeed occupying a far higher plane. Whereas previously the medium was a helpless prey to whatever astral presence visited her auric sphere, bringing with it contamination and the rank odour of corruption and foul decay, with the adoption of magical methods these excreta may successfully be restrained from entering the sphere of personality. And not only so, but entities of a definite category, divine and spiritual in their nature, completely opposed to ordinary Spiritualistic \" spooks,\" may be invoked to the ultimate advantage of the medium and the growth of her spiritual power. I have not thought fit to describe a number of different types of magical operations in this book inasmuch as they have no eternal place in the building of the heavenly sanctuary. Nor do they pertain to the proper limitations which must be circumscribed about the Temple of the Holy Magic of Light. Although not necessarily included within the connotation of the term \" Black Magic,\" these methods border very closely on that phase of things. Since their tendency is in that direction, they are of little use to the aspirant in quest of Adonai and the felicity of the Gods. A host of minor operations exist for the acquisition of wanted objects, such as books, gold, women and the like. There are works of destruction and fascination, divination and transformation and so forth. These are but a few which receive entirely too much emphasis and attention at the expense of more important matters in grimoires and the lesser books of instruction. Divorced of the higher aspirations they are reprehensible beyond word. One fairly important branch of the lesser, though not black, Magic, is the control of the Tattvas or the vital pranic currents operating in Nature. With the employment of the tattva symbols, accompanied by a knowledge of the specific hours of the day when those forces acquire predominancy and purity, the Magician who so desires may open the gates of the body and mind to the vivifying and reanimating forces of those occult currents. By these means he obtains physical and psychic refreshment when at a low ebb and when the forces of his being are devitalized.

I cannot say that the aspirant to the Augoeides has much use for such dubious powers and attainments. The nature of Black Magic which seems a great bother to so many hysterics consists almost entirely in the motive held in the operator's mind. When Levi deals with this subject and that of sorcery in his writings he flies off completely at a tangent, and his superb exaggerations, coloured with all the flamboyance and rhetoric at his disposal, make amusing reading. That some have seriously quoted him on this subject for literal interpretation, instead of dismissing it as mere verbosity, surpasses my-comprehension. His observations about the goat of Mendes and the worship of Baphomet in connection with the Templars are simply ridiculous. What comment can one make to the absurd directions provided by him as being the supposed steps taken by those engaged in the black arts, other than that they would make splendid material for present- day \" thrillers \" ? I have yet to learn in what department store candles manufactured of human fat may be purchased. What human being could be asinine or mad enough to think of procuring incense mixed with the blood of a goat, a mole and a bat ? Other frightful necessities consist of the head of a recently deceased black cat, a bat drowned in blood, the horns of a virgin goat and the skull of a parricide ! Yet in his Book of Ceremonial Magic Mr. Waite has gone to the trouble of uttering a fearful warning against Goetia together with Levi's ludicrous drawing of the goetic circle for employment with the afore-mentioned \" props.\" In preparation for an overwhelming offensive on Black Magic, Waite manceuvred his heaviest artillery into position when, in reality, a peashooter would have been much more effective against such enemy as this. Little doubt can be entertained that Levi was \" pulling the leg \" of some readers, and that he was simply indulging in his gift for impossible lurid rites, the children of a curious but exuberant imagination. Hypnotism, and the act of depriving another person of choice or use of will, does constitute one of the most loathsome forms of Black Magic.

The ordinary absurd feats concerning the manufacture of philtres, potions and wax figures for works of fascination or malice, exist altogether beneath the dignity of the sincere Magician. What may perhaps be constituted true Black Magic is the use of charged seals and talismans made by a person who has acquired magical power for the deprecation and harm of his fellow-man. Operations whose purpose it is to evoke the shade of a departed friend or relative to visible manifestation consist of manipulations of astral substance, and can serve no useful purpose, inasmuch as they are dist~lrbing to the tranquil processes of assimilation and faculty-building proceeding in the higher astral after physical death. Only insane vanity and inordinate curiosity could be satisfied by Necromancy. This particular branch of sorcery is akin to Spiritualism, although in all fairness and justice it must be admitted that the motives in the latter cult do exist on a higher and more sincere plane. In both cases, however, motive is no excuse, for they are an abomination against the entire trend of Nature's processes. Inasmuch as this chapter deals largely with the Astral, I wish once more to have further reference to the technique of astral travelling which is pursued by the Magician. It is an imperative duty for the Theurgist to thoroughly investigate, as has been laid down in a former chapter, in his glittering and iridescent Body of Light the upper levels of the Astral Light, those which border on the creative and archetypal worlds. He must also penetrate daunt- lessly into every guarded sanctuary therein, familiarizing himself with the essential nature and the varying aspects which this plane presents, although never must he lose sight of one important fact ever to be present in his mind. Always must he endeavour to transcend that plane. It is but a Hall of Learning. Necessary though its lessons are, once they are assimilated and learned, the need for remaining there ceases, and the ever-splendid Mansions of Fire and Wisdom should be sought. The spiritualized Body of Light should be continuously trained and educated, and its substance should be made the more sensitive and refined so that from a vague, shapeless, lunar body it is reborn as a brilliant solar body. It is in this body that the Magician may ascend to the translucid spiritual heights and the formless fire which abides beyond.

Despite the power of the Pentagram, the magical gestures and signs, the invocation of the Four Angels of the Quarters, and other magical devices for rising and passing, these guardians will under no circumstances give him the right of entry, nor will they extend permission to pass through the gates they guard. The Candle of Vision mentions an effort by -4. E. to describe this experience of mystical nature. \" Then I was whirled away again, and I was the tiniest figure in vast mid-air, and before me was a gigantic gate which seemed lofty as the skies, and a shadowy figure filled the doorway and barred my passage. That is all I can remember. . . .\" Some mention of this fact also was attempted by the scribe of the Book of the Dead, for in those chapters relating to the names of the Pylons, together with the names of the Watchers, Guardians and angelic Porters, some veiled magical hints are given as to how they may be entered. At this juncture, before entering further upon this subject of Rising upon the Planes, it is necessary to acquaint the reader with one most important aspect of Astral technique which should always be retained in memory. To the Pentagram, the denizens of the Astral Plane respond in two different and quite distinct ways. The experience of modern Theurgists on this point is amply corroborated by the whole of the magical tradition of the ancients. It is their testimony that when faced by the flaming five-pointed Star, formulated by the Magical Will, some astral beings will shrink perceptibly, and appear to fade away. Another class of beings, however, will grow and expand to cover the whole horizon with a splendid luminosity and radiance. Now the experience of all ages of Magicians demonstrates that the being which shrivels up in fear of the Pentagram or hastens rapidly away is either a dog-faced demon or an elementary, and must be treated accordingly. On the other hand, the being whose appearance does not suffer by the Pentagram and the appropriate banishing ritual is a spiritual intelligence, an Angel, a lofty celestial being to be respected, and loved, and venerated. A variation of the Pentagram symbol employed by other people with a certain degree of success is a golden cross surn~ounted by a crimson rose. The symbolism in both cases is identical, although the cross may be considered by some to have unpleasant theological associations. It is a token of the four elements extended into the A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE cardinal quarters, while crowning them is the Rose, the symbol of beauty, nobility and the spiritual life. In practice, its application is somewhat different from the Pentagram, for it is less simple to formulate the Rose-cross with the Wand than the former symbol ; the Magician interposes in imagination this symbol between the other being and himself without attempting to trace it. The fact, therefore, that an Angel clothed with fire and glory, and bearing a sharp sword of flame, bars his entrance to the Pylon, should cause the Theurgist to pause, and pausing to reflect. For one thing, it implies that so far he is not sufficiently purified and sensitive in his Body of Light to be able to pass through that particular Pylon from which he is debarred. It should be construed his solemn duty to consider, as a prime necessity, the means whereby further purification can be effected. Into the Body of Light should be infused a spiritual substance from higher and more celestial planes. The persistent assumption of God-forms, and the transmut- ing of his own astral form into that of the God and the identification with the sublime moral and spiritual character of the God, will be found to be as unfailing a method as any. By this method, the substance of the Body of Light will in time come to participate in the fiery splendour and effulgence of the substance of the God. Perhaps the finest God-form to assume for this purpose is that of the lotus-seated Harpocrates, the Lord of Silence, who is the twin of Horus, Lord of Strength and Fire. The conventional form wherein he is usually pictured is that of an innocent babe, finger to lip, curled up like an embryo upon a white lotus arising from the sea. Around him is a deep blue-black colour, not unlike that of the tattva symbol of Spirit, representing the all-embracing Night. The lotus is the perennial symbol of resurrection and eternal youth, and the babe represents innocence, spirituality and supreme repose. \" By the God ' sitting above the lotus,' \" affirms Iamblichus in The Mysteries, \" a transcendency and strength which by no means comes into contact with the mire, are obscurely signified, and also indicate his intellectual and empyrean empire. For everything belonging to the lotus is seen to be circular, viz. both the form of the leaves and the fruit ; and circulation is alone allied to the motion of intellect, which energizes with invariable sameness, in one order, and according to one reason. But the God is established by himself, and above a dominion and energy of this kind, venerable and holy, superexpanded, and abiding in himself, which his being seated is"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"HARPOCRATES ON THE LOTUS The Lord of Silence. A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE intended to signify.\" The magical assumption of this form, par- ticularly the surrounding of the astral body with the egg of blue- black or indigo, is sufficiently powerful to banish any unwanted influence, inasmuch as it elevates the Magician above that realm. This particular technique of the Harpocrates God-form has a special significance even so far as daily life is concerned. When assailed by undesirable thoughts and hateful emotions, relief from their pressure, even spiritual assistance and strength, may be gained from assuming the form of this God. By this assumption one's being is transmuted to the shape of the God, and the mind is elevated beyond worldly pettiness by assimilation into the character and nature of divinity. It implies, certainly, a strength of imagination and will, but pictorial images are more easy for most people to retain in the mind than an abstract idea, and any individual with a little practice may be trained to visualize so simple and beautiful a form as the babe on the lotus. The sole difficulty may be encountered in the transfiguration of the Body of Light and the subsequent identification and union with the God. In this, naturally, training is indispensable. The vibration of divine names is a practice which under no circumstances should be omitted since, as this exercise is proceeded with, the coarse elements are forcibly expelled from the whole constitution, physical, astral and moral, and other finer and more sensitive elements are introduced to take their place. Frequent celebrations of the Eucharist are also an excellent means of trans- muting and exalting the substance of the entire being. On an earlier page this operation was briefly described, and by way of emphasis I shall recapitulate the theory which there obtains. Divorced of all dogma, the essence of the Eucharist is this. You take a simple substance such as, for example, a wheaten host ; baptize it your highest conception of God or, as the case may be, in the name of a particular spiritual Essence, and consume it. In this way, by means of sympathetic magic, an actual transub- stantiation of elements takes place under stress of the Will. That which was formerly terrestrial becomes celestial. That which was of the earth earthy is transformed into a thing of the heavens. A wheaten wafer and the wine appear to become almost directly assimilated into the blood, and absorbed by the ego itself.

The fact that this telesmata is consumed by the Magician introduces into his being a spiritual power which by virtue of its inherent energy, thrusts out impure elements from his being, elevating and transmuting the whole man on to a loftier plane. In this manner is the transformation of the Body of Light from a dark lunar body into a Solar body accomplished, an organism which is glittering, clear-cut and well- formulated in shape, glowing like brightly burnished steel, capable of passing through every Pylon, penetrating the most carefully guarded Sanctuaries and enlisting the assistance of the angelic wardens. With this Solar body of spiritualized substance, the gorgeous garment of the Wedding Feast, the Theurgist will experience no difficulty in rising on the planes from Malkus through the Path of Saturn to the Sphere of the Foundation. From the Foundation, he may rise through the Arrow of Aspiration and the Power of armo on^ and Beauty, upwards-ever upwards beyond the barren desert of the Abyss, over which he rides on the Qabalistic Camel, received with joy and adulation by the Queen in the King's Palace, which is the holv Crown of the Tree of Life. Arrived in '1 he Crown. the Magician is no more. There still exists, however, that supernal consciousness of Eternal Life which is the real individuality of the Magician-that real part of him of which, perhaps, he wis rarely conscious during his former lives on earth-that primal universal spirit, pulsing and vibrating unseen in the core of the heart of all. It was written by Porphyry that \" the souls in passing through the spheres of the planets-put on, like successive tunics, the qualities of those stars.\" Since the Planets and Zodiacal Signs have been attributed to the Tree, and are included within the implication of the Ten Sephiros, the Magician, by means of this process of Rising on the Planes, assimilates the highest qualities and characteristics of each planet and Sephirah. As the Skryer ascends to the Supernal Light of the Undying Flame of Life, he incorporates into himself the innate power of the planes through which he passes, and as the lower characteristics of his being are hardly compatible with the fiery impersonal majesty of the celestial realm, the former are ejected, leaving the latter the august guardians of the field of consciousness. All the characteristics of the higher worlds are successively assumed by the Magician, and transcended, until in the end of his magical journey, he is merged into the being of the Lord of every Life.

Because there has been in the past so much wilful obscurity and intentionally misleading matter, it seemed high time to provide a statement which could be utilized once and for all as a clear, definite exposition. The writer hopes that he has kept to this intentioq throughout, although that is a point of which the reader must be the sole judge. Ambiguity and sometimes deliberate attempt to deceive, through the employment of difficult symbolism and mention of large series of authoritative names, have characterized a number of magical books, thus vitiating whatever value was theirs. There remains to be outlined in this work one secret formula of Practical Magic of such a tremendous nature-shrouded as it always has been in the past by the glamour of recondite symbols and hidden by heavy veils-that the writer is doubtful as to whether it would be wise or politic to adhere to his original decision. It might, of course, have been omitted from the general contents, but to render this treatise moderately complete so far as the major, though elementary, aspects of the Higher Magic are concerned it was necessary to include it in some form. The method of which it is proposed to speak is so puissant a formula of the Magic of Light, and one so liable to indiscriminate abuse and use in Black Magic, that if a conception of its technique and theory is to be presented at all then the original intent of the writer must be discarded. It will be necessary to resort to the medium of an eloquent symbolism which for centuries has been utilized for the conveyance of these and similar ideas. And the reader must be assured that the symbolism has not been purposely muddled, nor has it been rendered ambiguous, obscure and meaningIess.

The Mass of the Holy Ghost ! Thus is this particular technique named. It is unique in the whole of Magic, for therein are comprehended almost every known form of Theurgic procedure. Simultaneously, it is the quintessence and the synthesis of them all. Among other things it concerns the Magic of Talismans. By this method a living spiritual force is bound into a specific telesmatic substance. Not dead or inert is this telesmata as obtains in the customary ceremonial talismanic evocation ; but it is one at once vibrant, dynamic, and containing in germ and potentiality the possibility of all growth and development. In a very special way, it concerns moreover the formula of the Holy Grail. A golden Chalice of spiritual grace is employed, into which the very essence and life-blood of the Theurgist must be poured for the redemption not of his own soul but that thereby all mankind might be saved. The Eucharist too is implicit, and the Chalice is used as the com- munion cup, the hallowed contents of which-thaumaturgic and iridescent ; the sacramental wine, in short-must be dedicated and consecrated to the service of the Most High. The Oblation to be consumed with the Eucharistic wine is, by this interpretation, the secret essence of both the intoxicated Magician and the supreme God whom he has invoked. In this method also is imputed to a very large degree the alchemical technique, inasmuch as it concerns for the most part the production of the potable Gold, the Stone of the Philosophers, and the Elixir of Life which is Amrita, the Dew of Immortality. Above all should the reader retain in mind the philosophical formula of the Tetragrammaton which is the method of this Mass. This demonstrates the necessity for a practical acquaintance with the numerical principles of the Holy Qabalah, for the more know- ledge one possesses and has systematically classified under the index system of the Tree of Life, the more meaning and significance attaches itself to the Tetragrammaton formula. In the chapter sketching the magical theory of the universe the general implications of the sacred Name were briefly explained in those connections. These ideas should be thoroughly assimilated in relation to the Tree. With that understanding the reader should apply his powers to the symbolic scheme which now follows.

To her breasts her hands are held, and there issue therefrom two streams returning into the sea. In explanation of this figure Hzrt- man wrote that \" The figure represents the foundation of things and from which all things are born. It is a dual principle of nature ; its parents are the Sun and the Moon ; it produces water and wine, gold and silver, by the blessing of God. If you torture the Eagle the Lion will become feeble. The ' Eagle's tears ' and the ' red blood sf the Lion ' must meet and mingle. The Eagle and the Lion bathe, eat, and love each other. They will become like the Sala- mander and become constant in the fire.\" In elaboration of the above, the following principles may be postulated. The Y of the sacred Name in this system is called the Red Lion, and the first H is the White Eagle. These two letters are conceived to be the representations of two cosmic principles, two rivers of scarlet blood which pour from the breasts of the mermaid into the sea, two distinct ever-flowing streams of life and light and love which proceed eternally from Life itself. In them is the power of touching and communing, making new one the other, without any breaking of the subtle confines of the flowing streams, nor any confusion of substance. Mutually complementary and opposite in nature are they ; yet in them is grounded the entirety of existence. All alchemical operations according to authority require two major instruments : \" one circular, crystalline vessel, justly proportioned to the quality of its contents \" or the Cucurbite, and \" one theosophic, cabalistically sealed furnace or Athanor.\"l The Athanor is assigned to the Y, and the Cucurbite is an attribution of the H. Now although the pure Gold of which mention was made is a homogeneous substance, one and indivisible, dynamic and pregnant with infinite possibility, nevertheless two separate substances are used in its production. These are named the Serpent or the Blood of the Red Lion, and the Tears or the Gluten of the White Eagle. The Serpent is an attribution of the V of Tetragrammaton, and to the last H of that Name the Gluten is allocated. These two substances are the offspring, as it were, of the Lion and the Eagle. The al- chemical instruments aforementioned are to be considered as the storehouses or generators of these two divine principles or swift- flowing streams of blood and fire and force, the Athanor being the Amfihithealvum.

The manufacture of the alchemical gold which is the Dew of Immortality consists of a peculiar operation having several phases. Through the stimulus of warmth and spiritual fire to the Athanor there should be a transfer, an ascent of the Serpent from that instrument into the Cucurbite, used as a retort. The alchemical marriage or the mingling of the two streams of force in the retort causes at once the chemical corruption of the Serpent in the men- struum of the Gluten, this being the solve' part of the general al- chemical formula of solve' et coagula. Hard upon the corruption of the Serpent and his death, arises the resplendent Phcenix which, as a talisman, should be charged by means of a continuous invocation of the spiritual principle conforming to the work in hand. The conclusion of the Mass consists in either the consumption of the trans- substantiated elements, which is the Amrita, or the anointing and consecration of a special talisman. Prior to proceeding further with the analysis of aspects of this Operation, I should like to place before the reader a quotation wherein this Mass is repeated at some length, using the conventional nomenclature of alchemy. \" I am a goddess for beauty and extrac- tion famous, born out of our proper sea which compasseth the whole earth and is ever restless. Out of my breasts I pour forth milk and blood ; boil these two till they are turned into silver and gold. 0 most excellent subject, out of which all things are generated, though at first sight thou art poison, adorned with the name of the Flying Eagle. . . .

But consider, 0 man, what things God bestows upon thee by this means. Torture the Eagle till she weeps and the Lion be weakened and bleed to death. The blood of this Lion incorporated with the tears of the Eagle is the treasure of the earth.\" This, without doubt, is also in explanation of the figure reproduced by Franz Hartman. By some authorities, it is roughly estimated that from the pre- liminary Invocation, with the binding of the force in the elements, to the act of partaking the Communion itself from the consecrated Chalice, the operation should not take less than an hour. Sometimes, indeed, a much longer period is required, especially if it is required that the charging of the talisman be complete and thorough.

There is the possibility of actual leakage or an overflowing from the Cucurbite, and the assimilation or evaporation of the corrupted elements within that instrument is also an accident greatly to be deplored. It cannot be stressed too strongly or too frequently that if the elements are not consecrated aright ; or in the first place if the invoked force does not properly impinge upon or is insecurely bound within the elements, the whole operation may be nullified. And it may easily degenerate to the lowest depths, resulting in the creation of a Qliphotic horror to exist like a vampire upon the unnaturally sensitive and those who are inclined to hysteria and obsession. If the elixir be properly distilled, serving as the medium of the invoked spirit, then the Heavens are opened, and the Gates swing back for the Theurgist, and the treasures of the earth are laid at his feet. \" If you discover it be silent and keep it sacred. Trust to nobody but to God.\" The problem of the link to connect the magical operation with the desired result should be considered in all its numerous aspects. If the Operation is one actually requiring an exterior talisman for the visible production of its effect, a suitable seal should be con- structed in metal, wax, or on parchment. It may be consecrated and anointed with the elixir which has been created through the channels of the Hermetic Work. Those seals and talismans described in the Key of Solomon the King and The Magus are for the purpose quite suitable. Should it be that the operation proposed by the Theurgist is one pertaining to the qualities of Jupiter, a suitable pantacle should be prepared before the Operation. During the manufacture of the Elixir, the God-Mask of Maat should be assumed, and a conjuration of the required angel or intelligence recited. Upon the completion of the Mass a minute quantity of the supernal dew should be placed on the sigil or talisman of Jupiter thus charging it with an insuperable force for the production of the desired results. Variations of this procedure will probably occur with practice. No question of a link enters into a ceremony conducted for an end wherein the Circle and the Triangle, so to speak, or the demon and the exorcist, occupy the same plane. That is, when the Theurgist works solely upon his own consciousness without reference to any exterior effect. The Mass of the Holy Ghost, in such a case, is auto- matically climaxed by the consumption of the charged elements, the invoked force incarnating within the Magician as a matter of course. It is in this type of operation, I think, that the Mass of the A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE Holy Ghost generates the greatest amount of force and ascends to the highest level of efficiency. Even for ordinary operations, the great advantage of this method is that ceremonial may be dispensed with almost-altogether. The Magician quite easily can perform the banishing ritual on the Astral, and the invocations may be silently recited so that no Magic of a ceremonial nature may be perceived by the profane. In the instance of operations, however, where the result desired exists on another plane or exterior to the consciousness of the Magician, effects do not always seem to follow with the same infallibility and sequence as they do in subjective workings. The perusal of private records kept by Magicians who have utilized this magical engine tend to show that it is best employed for works within the consciousness of the Magician. It is in these matters that the Mass of the Holy Ghost is the most puissant and efficacious. For the development of the Magical Will, the enhancement of the Imagination, and the Invocation both of Adonai and the Universal Gods to indwell the consecrated temple of the Holy Ghost, a better or more suitable method could hardly be devised. No expenditure of vital energy is involved, for any energy so utilized in the operation returns at the end to the Magician enhanced and enriched with the birth of the golden Phoenix. the \" symbol of resurrection and rebirth. The supreme power operating in this technique is love. Trite though it may seem, and hackneyed though the word itself has become, it must be reiterated that love is the motivating power ; a love force held always in leash by the Will and controlled by the Soul. The destructive power of the Sword and all that the Sword implies, the dispersive character of the dagger or any of the other elemental weapons, has no place herein. This method therefore commends itseif as being of the very highest. Since it does partake of love, it is of the stuff and essence of life itself. In Operation, this Mass is extraordinarily simple. Indeed, one Magus has observed that it is no more complicated than the riding of a bicycle ; that is to say, when once certain preliminaries and training have been encompassed. More than anything else it requires a peculiarly potent and detached Will, arguing of course previous discipline, and a mind which has been trained to concen- tration for long periods of time. One of the peculiarities of this technique is that unless one is exceptionally wary and alert from the beginning it is an easy matter for the Magician to lose control of"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"254 THE TREE OF LIFE his alchemical instruments, and thus spoil the entire oper n t' ion.

One may even state for that true success in all JIagic a thorough grounding in Yoga technique is an absolute essential. A further observation may not be out of place. On the surface and at first sight it may appear that between this type of magical operation, so hesitatingly described, and the usual cere- monial working there exists a wide gap. It is true that the Mass of the Holy Ghost is an advance on the cumbrous and slow working of ceremonial, even although the latter is an essential at the com- mencement of magical training. This method is considerably more direct and to thc point, and because of the peculiar class of energies which it brings to bear upon Sature, its effects are es- ceedingly more powerful and far-reaching than those of ceremonial alone. Nevertheless, although subsisting as two distinct clnises of work, they can with great advantage be combined and used one in conjunction with the other. The general consensus of opinion of the alchemical authorities, by whom this method was esteemed, was that lofty as it ivas its results could not be encompassed without prayer. Without sincere prayer nothing permanent or divine could be accomplished. Hence while the Operation of the Mass is in progress, and the fire in the Athanor becomes more intense, an enthusiastic invocation, either astral or audible, should be recited. It should be in the nature of a short mantram appropriate to the nature and type of working, rhythmical in composition. The operation as a ~vhole could be preceded by a more general invocation to legitimize the work. As the astral work of creation proceeds, the rhythmical mantram will help to formulate and vivify the moulds caused by Will and Imngin- ation, attracting the spiritual force desired. Then, when the Serpent is transferred from the Athanor and the alchemical cor- ruption commences in the Gluten of the White Eagle, the Cucurbite will be the receptacle of a new substance, living and dynamic, bearing the indelible impress of the invocations that will have A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 25.5 endowed its plasticity and potentiality with an overwhelming impetus in a given direction.

Before closing this book, however, I wish to give a few examples of the various kinds of rituals and invocations which are included within a complete ceremony. Several kinds of ritual have been mentioned in the previous pages, and it is necessary now to render these references more explicit. A complete cere- monial operation is comprised of a number of lesser cycles, as it were. Apart from all questions of preparation and consecration of the weapons of Art, the Circle and Triangle, and Talismans, the method of which having been described, the Ceremony proper may include as many as eight distinct phases, not mentioning at all the fact that many of them may be required to be repeated two or three times by way of emphasis. The ceremony opens with a thorough Banishing Ritual, which has already been quoted, in order to render pure and clean the sphere of working. There usually follows a general invocation or Oration to the Lord of the Universe. Precise work then follows. There should be an invocation of the God governing the operation, the recitation of an appeal to the Arch- angel or Angel, succeeded by a powerful conjuration of the Spirit or Intelligence to visible appearance. Its manifestation in the Triangle is hailed by a special welcome, when incense is burnt as an offering and to give it body. The License to Depart then follows, and the Operation is closed by a complete ceremonial Banishing. It is proposed, then, in this final chapter, to give several examples of each of the more important cycles of the work, reproducing those invocations which are considered by authorities to be exemplary. The preparation of a suitable Temple or room to be used as the scene of magical operations is one of the most important of the preliminaries to be attended to by the Theurgist.

A simple form of ceremony consecrating a special chamber for a magical purpose may quite easily be devised by incorporating the Pentagram ritual with several of the aphorisms of the Chaldaan Oracles, as for example in the following ritual. \" Let the Magician face the East, and holding the Lotus wand by the black part, say the following words : HEKAS, HEKAS, EST1 BEBELOI ! \"Then let the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram be performed so that a Circle is formed embracing the area of the entire Chamber, after which the Wand should be laid upon the Altar. \" Purify the outer limits of the Circle with water, saying : ' So therefore first the Priest who governeth the works of Fire must sprinkle the water of the loud resounding sea.' \" Purify with fire, saying : ' And when after all the Phantoms thou shalt see that Holy Formless Fire, that Fire which darts and flashes through the hidden depths of the universe, Hear thou the Voice of Fire.' \"Then take up again the Lotus wand by the white end, and repeat the Adoration : \" ' Holy art Thou Lord of the Universe. Holy art Thou Whom Nature hath not formed. Holy art Thou the Vast and Mighty One, Lord of Light and of the Darkness.' \" Immediately after the initial banishings have been performed, and just before the Ceremony is to commence, an Invocation of the Higher is advised. Just as the lower will aspires to that which is above, so also is it conceived that the higher will aspires to union with that which is below. To equilibrate the Ceremony, an invoca- tion to the Higher Will-whether conceived as the Augoeides or the Lord of the Universe-is considered an indispensable part of any operation. The prayer given below first appears in Tlze Secret Symbols of the Rosicrucians, by Franz Hartman, and it is one of the most eloquent and exalting anthems, suitable for the above- mentioned purpose, which has come to be written : \" Eternal and Universal Fountain of Love, Wisdom and Happi- ness; Nature is the book in which Thy character is written, and"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"258 THE TREE OF LIFE no one can read it unless he has been in Thy school.

Sanctify me also with the Oil of Thy Sanctification, wherewith Thou hast sanctified all Thy Prophets ; and purify in me therewith all that appertaineth to me, so that I may become worthy of the Conversa- tion of Thy Holy Guardian Angels, and of Thy Divine Wisdom, and grant unto me the Power which Thou hast given unto Thy Prophets over all the evil Spirits.\" Perhaps one of the finest preliminary anthems known to the writer is one which was written by Xleister Crowley. It occurs in a mystical play entitled The Sltifi, composed a number of years ago, and it is free of all the unpleasant metaphysical implications, present in other orisons, which tend to grate on one's philosophic sensi- bilities. Since it is also in verse, the effect is cumulative, rendering exaltation a far easier process : \" Thou who art I, beyond all I am, Who hast no nature, and no name, Who art, when all but Thou are gone, Thou, centre and secret of the Sun, Thou, hidden spring of all things known And unknown, Thou aloof, alone, Thou, the true fire within the reed Brooding and breeding, source and seed Of life, love, liberty, and light, Thou beyond speech and beyond sight, Thee I invoke, my faint fresh fire Kipdling as mine intents aspire.

In point of fact, there is one volume translated by Taylor in 1787 from the Greek entitled The Mystical Hymns of Or$heus, in which there are invocations addressed to almost each one of the major Gods. Hence for the student of Theurgy this volume is bound to be of the utmost assistance in his practical work, particularly in view of the fact that Taylor was of the opinion that the contents of the book were employed in the Eleusinian Mysteries. Of the type of general oration to precede a Ceremony, there is an outstanding Hymn to Heaven which for this purpose is incomparable. \" Great Heav'n, whose mighty frame no respite knows, Father of all from whom the world arose ; Hear, bounteous parent, source and end of all, For ever whirling round this earthly ball ; Abode of Gods, whose guardian pow'r surrounds Th' eternal world with ever during bounds ; Whose ample bosoih, and encircling folds The dire necessity of nature holds.

It is distinctly worth quotation : \" Mother of Gods, great nurse of all, draw near, Divinely honour'd, and regard my prayer. Thron'd on a car, by lions drawn along, By bull-destroying lions, swift and strong, Thou sway'st the sceptre of the pole divine, And the world's middle seat, much fam'd, is Thine.

It contains a number of the barbarous names of evocation, and was uttered by Jesus for the purification of His disciples : \" Hear me, oh my Father, Father of all Paternity, Infinite Light, render these my disciples worthy to receive the Baptism of Fire, forgive their sins, purify the iniquities which they have committed consciously or unconsciously, those which they have committed from their childhood even unto this day, their thoughtless words, their evil speech, their false witness, their thefts, their lies, their deceitful calumnies, their fornications, their adulteries, their covet- ousness, their avarice, and all the sins that they may have com- mitted, efface them, purify them from them, and let the ZORO- KOTHORA come in secret and bring them the Water of the Baptism of Fire of the Virgin of Treasure. \" Hear me, 0 my Father : I invoke Thy Incorruptible Names Hidden in the Bons for ever.

A pronoun here, and a word there, and the result is a personal ritual. The same is also true of the rituals of the Book of the Dead, many of which are lyrical and panegyric. Chapter CLXXXII gives a short Invocation, wherein Thoth is represented as being identified with the deceased. \" I am Thoth, the perfect scribe, whose hands are pure. I am the Lord of purity, the destroyer of evil, the scribe of right and truth, and that which I abominate is sin. \" Behold me, for I am the writing reed of the god Neb-er-tcher, the lord of laws, who giveth forth the word of wisdom and under- standing, and whose speech hath dominion over the double land.

It has been necessary to edit it somewhat, inasmuch as it was too long and scattered. \" Hail, lord Osiris. Hail, lord Osiris.

The fish Teshtu guard the waters around thy bark. Thou orderest the dwelling of the monster Oun-ti, which Nub-ti strikes with his sword. \"This is the God who seized the heaven and the earth in his tempest. His virtue is powerful to destroy his enemy. His spear is the instrument of death for the monster Oubn-ro. Suddenly seizing him he holds him down ; he makes him master of him and forces him to re-enter his abode ; then he devours his eyes and there- in is his triumph ; then is the monster devoured by a burning flame ; from the head to the feet all his members burn in its heat. Thou bringest thy servants to the haven with a favourable wind. Under thee, the winds find peace. Thy bark rejoices, thy paths are enlarged, because thou hast overcome the ways of the author of evil. \" Sail, wandering stars !

It is an extremely good peroration. These rituals should have a great deal of study devoted to them, and in the light of principles of the Qabalah, a considerable amount of philo- sophy may be extracted from, and perceived in them. A ritual which has since become known generally as the \" Bornless Invocation \" appears to the writer to be, perhaps, one of the best rituals known to him. The earliest record discovered of this is in a work entitled Fraggnerzt of a Grgco-Egy$tian Work zdpon Magic, by Charles Wycliffe Goodwin, M.A., published in 1852 for the Cambridge Antiquarian Society. Reprinted in the late 'nineties by Budge in his Egyptian Magic, it became widely known among the devotees of Theurgy, and was carefully edited and elaborated by experienced Magicians. Reproduced below is the improved version : \" Thee I invoke, the Bornless One. \" Thee that didst create the Earth and the Heavens. \" Thee that didst create the Night and the Day. \" Thee that didst create the darkness and the Light. \" Thou art Osorronophris ; Whom no man hath seen at any time. \" Thou art Iabas.

Dee, for example, would have before him one or more of these tables, as a rule 49\" x 49\", some full, some lettered only on alternate squares, on a writing-table. Sir Edward Kelly would sit down at what they called the Holy Table and gaze into a Shewstone or Crystal in which, after a while, he would see an Angel, who would"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"274 THE TREE OF LIFE point with a wand to letters on one of these charts in succession. To Dee would Kelly report that the Angel points, for example, to column 4, rank 29, of the chart, and so on, apparently not mention- ing the letter, which Dee found on the table before him and wrote down. When the Angel had finished his instruction, the message was rewritten backwards. It had been dictated the wrong way round by the Angel since it was considered too dangerous to communicate in a straightforward manner, each word being so powerful a con- iuration that its direct ~ronunciation and mention would have evoked powers and forces not wanted at that moment. Rewritten backwards, these invocations appeared written in a language which the two Magicians called Enochian. Far from being a meaningless jargon it has a grammar and syntax all of its own, as may be seen by consulting Casaubon who gives a translation of many of the keys. By many it is considered far more sonorous and impressive than even Greek or Sanskrit, and the English translations, though in some places difficult to understand, contain marvellous passages of a sustained sublimity and lyrical power that many poets and even the Bible do not surpass. For example : \" Can the Wings of the Wind understand your voices of Wonder ? 0 ye the Second of the First, whom the burning flames have framed in the depths of my Jaws ! Whom I have prepared as cups for a wedding or as flowers in their beauty for the chamber of Righteousness. Stronger are your feet than the barren stone : and mightier are your voices than the manifold winds 1 For you are become a building such as is not, save in the mind of the All-Powerful.\" Nineteen of these Keys exist ; the first two evoke the element called Spirit; the next sixteen invoke the four elements, each having four subdivisions ; the nineteenth may be employed to invoke any of the so-called Thirty Aethyrs by the change of one or two special words. I propose quoting another of these Keys in Enochian followed by an English translation : \" 01 Sonuf Vaoresaji, gohu IAD Balata, elanusaha caelazod; sobrazod 01 Roray i ta nazodapesad, Giraa ta maelpereji, das hoe1 ho qaa notahoa zodimezod, od comemahe ta nobeloha zodien; soba tahil ginonupe perje aladi, das vaurebes obolehe giresam.

He entitles this ritual the Prayer of the Sylphs : \" Spirit of Light, Spirit of Wisdom, whose breath gives and takes away the form of all things ; Thou before whom the life of every being is a shadow which transforms and a vapour which passes away; Thou who ascendest upon the clouds and dost fly upon the wings of the wind; Thou who breathest forth and the limitless immensities are peopled ; Thou who drawest in and all that which came forth from Thee unto Thee returneth ; endless movement in the eternal stability, be Thou blessed for ever ! \" We praise Thee, we bless Thee in the fleeting empire of created light, of shadows, reflections and images: and we aspire without ceasing towards Thine immutable and imperishable splendour. May the ray of Thine intelligence and the warmth of Thy love descend on us ; that which is volatile shall be fixed, the shadow shall become body, the spirit of the air shall receive a soul, and dream be thought.

The form of the Second Conjuration of The Goetia, the best of all in that work, is thus : \" I do invocate, conjure and command thee, 0 Thou spirit N., to appear and to show thyself visibly unto me before this Circle in fair and comely shape, without any deformity or tortuosity ; by the name and in the name IAH and VAU, which Adam heard and spake ; and by the name of God AGLA, which Lot heard and was saved with his family ; and by the name IOTH which Jacob heard from the Angel wrestling with him, and was delivered from the hand of Esau, his brother; and by the name ANAPHAXETON, which Aaron heard and spake and was made wise ; and by the name ZABAOTH, which Moses named, and all the rivers were turned into blood ; and by the name ASHER EHYEH ORISTON, which Moses named, and all the rivers brought forth frogs, and they ascended into the houses destroying all things ; and by the name ELION, which Moses named, and there was great hail such as had not been since the beginning of the world ; and by the name ADONAI, which Moses named, and there came up locusts, which appeared upon the whole land, and devoured all which the hail had left ; and by the name SCHEMA AMATHIA, which Joshua called upon, and the sun stayed his course; and by the name ALPHA and OMEGA, which Daniel named, and destroyed Bel, and slew the Dragon ; and in the name EMMANUEL, which the three children, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, sang in the midst of the fiery furnace, and were delivered ; and by the name HAGIOS ; and by the Seal of ADONAI ; and by ISCHYROS, ATHANATOS, PARACLETOS; and by 0 THEOS, ICTROS, ATHANATOS, and by these three secret names AGLA ON TETRAGRAMMATON, do I adjure thee and constrain thee.

Wherefore, come thou, visibly, peaceably and affably, now without delay, to manifest that which I desire, speaking with a clear and perfect voice, intelligibly, and to mine under- standing.\" In The Magus Barrett gives a slight variation of the above ritual. Identical with the Goetia version to the verse mentioning Kora, Dathan and Abiram, with the exception of a few minor changes in names principally, there follows a whole section which is unique only to Barrett's ritual, and because of the barbarous words therein, it deserves quotation : \"And in the power of that name PRIMEUMATON, commanding the whole host of heaven, we curse you, and deprive you of your office, joy and place, and do bind you in the depth of the bottomless pit, there to remain until the dreadful day of the last judgment ; and we bind you into eternal fire, and into the lake of fire and brim- stone, unless you forthwith appear before this circle to do our will ; therefore, come ye, by these names ADONAI, ZABAOTH, ADONAI, AMIORAM; come ye, come ye, come ye, Adonai commandeth ; Sadai, the most mighty King of Kings, whose power no creature is able to resist, be unto you most dreadful, unless ye obey, and forthwith affably appear before this circle, let miserable rain and fire unquenchable remain with you; therefore, come ye, in the name of Adonai, Zabaoth, Adonai, Amioram ; come, come, come, why stay you ?

Inasmuch as it is an evocation of the Spirit King Amaimon, who figures as one of the Hierarchs in The Goetia, and since its commemoration is Christian in tenor, it is reproduced below that a comparison may be made with the preceding ritual, the tenor of which is Jewish. \" 0 thou Amaimon, King and Emperor of the Northern parts, I call, invoke, exorcise and conjure thee, by the virtue and power of the Creator, and by the virtue of virtues, to send me presently and without delay, Madael, Laaval, Bamlahe, Belem and Ramath, with all other spirits of thine obedience, in comely and human form !

I conjure thee by the Holy Trinity, by the sign of the Cross, by the most precious blood and water which flowed from the side of Jesus, by the sweat which issued from the whole of His body, when He said in the Garden of Olives : ' hly father, if it be thy will let this Cup pass from me ' ; by His death and passion, by His burial and glorious resurrection,by His ascension, I conjure thee furthermore by the crown of thorns which was set upon His head, by the blood which flowed from His feet and hands, A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE 279 by the nails with which He was nailed to the tree of the Cross, by the holy tears which He shed, by all which He suffered willingly through great love of us, by all the members of our Saviour Jesus Christ. \" I conjure thee by the judgment of the living and the dead, by the Gospel words of our Saviour Jesus Christ, by His preachings, by His sayings, by all His miracles, by the child in swaddling clothes, by the crying child borne by the mother in her most pure and virginal womb, by the glorious intercession of the Virgin Mother of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and by all which is of God and of the Most Holy Mother, as in heaven so on earth.

It is a Qabalistic invocation, however, and it contains no Christian elements at all. The major point of interest is that after the proem, each paragraph is a conjuration by and through the name and power of each of the Ten Sephiros of the Tree of Life. This ritual is the first ritual of evocation in the Key, the second one being very similar indeed to the second conjuration of the Goetia. \" O ye Spirits, ye I conjure by the Power, Wisdom and Virtue of the Spirit of God, by the uncreate Divine Knowledge, by the vast Mercy of God, by the Strength of God, by the Greatness of God, by the Unity of God, and by the Holy Name EHEIEH, which is the root, trunk, source and origin of all the other divine names, whence they all draw their life and their virtue which Adam having invoked, he acquired the knowledge of all created things. \" I conjure ye by the indivisible name IOD, which marketh and expresseth the Simplicity and the Unity of the Nature Divine, which Abel having invoked, he deserved to escape from the hands of Cain his brother. \" I conjure ye by the name TETRAGRAMMATON ELOHIM, which expresseth and signifieth the Grandeur of so lofty a Majesty, that Noah having pronounced it, saved himself, and protected himself with his whole household from the Waters of the Deluge. \" I conjure ye by the name of God EL strong and wonderful,"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"280 THE TREE OF LIFE which denoteth the Mercy and Goodness of His Majesty Divine, which Abraham having invoked, He was found worthy to come forth from the Ur of the Chaldeans. \" I conjure ye by the most powerful name of ELOHIM GIBOR, which showeth forth the strength of God, of a God all-powerful, who punisheth the crimes of the wicked, who seeketh out and chastiseth the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation ; which Isaac having invoked, he was found worthy to escape from the sword of Abraham his father. \" I conjure ye and I exorcise ye by the most holy name of ELOAH VA-DAATH, which Jacob invoked when in great trouble, and was found worthy to bear the name of Israel, which signifieth Van- quisher of God, and he was delivered from the fury of Esau his bro2her. \" I conjure ye by the most potent name of EL ADONAI TSABAOTH, which is the God of Armies, ruling in the Heavens, which Joseph invoked, and was found worthy to escape from the hands of his Brethren. \" I conjure ye by the most potent name of ELOHIM TSABAOTH, which expresseth piety, mercy, splendour and knowledge of God, which Moses invoked, and he was found worthy to deliver the people Israel from Egypt, and from the servitude of Pharaoh. \" I conjure ye by the most potent name of SHADDAI, which signifieth doing good unto all ; which Moses invoked, and having struck the Sea, it divided into two parts in the midst, on the right hand and on the left.

The ritual for Sunday for instance is : '( I conjure and confirm upon you, ye strong and holy angels of God, in the name Adonai, Eye, Eye, Eya, which is he who was, and is, and is to come, Eye, Abray ; and in the name Saday, Cados, Cados, Cados, sitting on high upon the cherubim ; and by the great name of God himself, strong and powerful who is exalted above all the heavens; Eye, Saraye, who created the world, the heavens, the earth, the sea, and all that in them is, in the first day, and sealed them with his holy name Phaa ; and by the name of the angels who rule in the fourth heaven, and serve before the most mighty Salamia, an Angel great and honourable ; and by the name of his star, which is Sol, and by his sign, and by the immense name of the Living God, and by all the names aforesaid, I conjure thee, Michael, 0 great Angel ! who art chief ruler of this day ; and by the name Adonai, the God of Israel, I conjure thee, 0 Michael ! that thou labour for me, and fulfil all my petitions according to my will and desire in my cause and business.\" When, during the ceremony of Evocation, signs are apparent that the manifestation of the Spirit is taking place, when the incense smoke is being whirled towards the Triangle and assuming a tangible form, an Oration or Welcome to the Spirits should be recited. The form recommended by Barrett is : \" BERALANENSIS, BALDACHIENSIS, PAUMACHIA, and APOLOGIA SEDES, by the most mighty kings and powers, and the most powerful princes, genii, Liachidae, ministers of the Tartarean seat, chief prince of the Seat of Apologia, in the ninth legion, I invoke you, A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFE and by invocating, conjure you ; and being armed with power from the supreme Majesty, I strongly command you, by Him who spoke and it was done, and to whom all creatures are obedient ; and by this ineffable name, Tetragrammaton Jehovah which being heard the elements are overthrown, the air is shaken, the sea runneth back, the fire is quenched, the earth trembles, and all the host of the celestials, and terrestrials, and infernals do tremble together, and are troubled and confounded ; wherefore, forthwith, and without delay, do you come from all parts of the world, and make rational answers unto all things I shall ask of you ; and come ye peaceably, visibly and affably now, without delay, manifesting what we desire, being conjured by the name of the living and true God, Helioren, and fulfil our commands, and persist unto the end, and according to our intentions, visibly and affably speaking unto us with a clear voice, intelligible and without any ambiguity.\" In the same book, Francis Barrett gives us another short address to be recited when the manifestation of the required entity is com- pleted ; that is when the Spirit stands perfectly clear and visible in the Triangle. \" Behold the pentacle of Solomon which I have brought into your presence ; behold the person of the Exorcist in the midst of the exorcism, who is armed by God, without fear, and well pro- vided, who potently invocateth and calleth you by exorcising ; come, therefore, with speed, by the virtue of these names: :lye Saraye, Aye Saraye : defer not to come, by the eternal names of the living and true God, Eloy, Archima, Rabur and by the pentacle of Solomon here present which powerfully reigns over you ; and by the virtue of the celestial spirits, your lords ; and by the person of the exorcist in the middle of the exorcism ; being conjured make haste and come, and yield obedience to your master, who is called Octinomos.
