Certain difficulties, however, have had to be faced. The author is dead and no authoritative revision is therefore possible. The original text was set up by Italian compositors whose work was obviously not carefully corrected. The result is th at is teems with errors of spelling and punctuation. In addition to this certain of the documents contained were evidently translated into English by foreigners and the translations were not revised. This results at times in some very quaint English. Furth er, the apparent lack of opportunity of correcting proofs has also caused a certain lack of uniformity as to the precise spelling of names, titles of books, forms of references and the like. While none of these defects can be said to detract from the inter est or value of the book, to perpetuate them in a new issue seemed inadvisable. On the other hand, short of many months or even years of work by an editor qualified to deal with the material, who is not easily to found, the kind of revision, rearrangement and amplification which should at some time be undertaken is impossible. We have therefore made only such corrections as are unquestionable; for example, in punctuation, spelling, uniformity (where the correct form is known), grammar (where the sense is ab solutely unaltered); otherwise the text has been left precisely as it first appeared. For the illustrations blocks have had to be made from the badly printed pages of the original. We have been able by careful workmanship to improve on them, but we disclai m any idea of their being as satisfactory as if we could have worked from the original documents, pictures and photographs.

She has traveled far and wide over Europe, visiting famous libraries, in order to collect, with long perserverance and unwearied exertion, the materials which we read at our ease, in comfortable armchairs, with their feet on the fender. So we owe her attention and our gratitude. The great Occultist and Brother of the White Lodge, fragments of whose life are herein given, was th e greatest force behind in the intellectual reforming movement which received its deathblow in the outbreak of the French revolution. Phoenix - like, it has re - arisen, and it reappeared in the 19th Century as the Theosophical Society, of which this Great Br other is one of the recognized leaders. Still living in the same body the perennial youth of which astonished the observers of the 18th - century, He has fulfilled the prophecy made to Mme. d 'Adhémar that he would show himself again a century after his far ewell to her, and, in the growing spiritual movement which is seen around us on every side, He will be one of the acknowledged Chiefs. Profoundly interesting, therefore, must be every detail that can be gathered of His eighteenth century life, and much is gathered here. ANNIE BESANT President of the Theosophical Society LONDON, 1911"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 PREFACE I have thought it better, in preparing the first part of the monograph on the Life of the Comte de St. Germain, to reprint the articles which were published in 1 897 in the “Theosophical Review” with some additional matter, rather than rewrite an entirely new book, since to many persons those magazine articles are not easily accessible. Perhaps some critics may think that there is too much quoted matter; this I hav e done on purpose in order that the opinions of those persons who were in actual contact with the Comte de St. Germain may be considered, rather than my own. In the eighteenth century every one of any education kept a diary, and in these diaries we get a l iving picture of the period; this is very decidedly the case in the Memoirs of Madame d’Adhémar. It has been suggested, by one writer in the Nineteenth Century, that these Memoirs are apocryphal. I do not think so, as the present Comtesse d’Adhémar inform ed me that they have documents about the Comte de St. Germain in their possession. In the second part of this study there is much additional political material; unfortunately, in the English Record Office, all the ciphers which were between the written lin es were carefully erased, before the papers were consigned to me. Evidently there was some mystery about this political work which is even now not to be made public. I take this opportunity of thanking the many friends, and specially Mon. G. Mallet, who ha ve helped me with the arduous work of copying and translating. Without their valuable help this study could not have been printed. I am now collecting more material which will form the second part of this monograph when complete. ISABEL COOPER - OAKLEY LO NDON, 1911 "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 THE COMTE DE ST.

The friend of humanity, wishing for money only that he might give to the poor, a friend to animals, his hear t was concerned only with the happiness of others. — Mémoires de Mon Temps, p.135. S.A.LE LANDGRAVE CHARLES, PRINCE DE HESSE. (Copenhagen, 1861.) DURING the last quarter of every hundred years an attempt is made by those Masters, of whom I have spoken, to he lp on the spiritual progress of Humanity. Towards the close of each century you will invariably find that an outpouring or upheaval of spirituality — or call it mysticism if you prefer — has taken place. Some one or more persons have appeared in the world as t heir agents, and a greater or less amount of occult knowledge or teaching has been given out. — The key to Theosophy (p.194). H. P. BLAVATSKY. THE Comte de St. Germain was certainly the greatest Oriental Adept Europe has seen during the last centuries. — Theo sophical Glossary , H. P. BLAVATSKY. AMONG the strange mysterious beings, with which the eighteenth century was so richly dowered, no one has commanded more universal comment and attention than the mystic who was known by the name of the Comte de St. Germa in. A hero of romance; a charlatan; a swindler and an adventurer; rich and varied were the names that showered freely upon him. Hated by the many, loved and reverenced by the few, time has not yet lifted the veil which screened his true mission from the vu lgar speculators of the period. Then, as now, the occultist was dubbed charlatan by the ignorant; only some men and women here and there realized the power of which he stood possessed. The friend and councilor of kings and princes, an enemy to ministers wh o were skilled in deception, he brought his great knowledge to help the West, be stave off in some small measure the storm clouds that were gathering so thickly around some nations. Alas! his words of warning fell on deafened ears, and his advice went all unheeded. Looking back from this distance of time it will be of interest to many students of mysticism to trace the life, so far as it may yet be told, of this great occultist. Sketches are to be found here and there from various writers, mostly antagonist ic, but no coherent detailed account of his life has yet appeared. This is very largely owing to the fact that the most interesting and important work, done by M. de St. Germain, lies buried in the secret archives of many princely and noble families. With this fact we have become acquainted"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 during the careful investigations which we have been making on the subject. Where the archives are situated we have also learned, but we have not yet in all cases received permission to make the necessary researches. It must be borne in mind that the Comte de St. Germain, alchemist and mystic, does not belong to the French family of St. Germain, from which descended Count Robert de St Germain; the letter was born in the tear 1780, at Lons - le - saulnier, was first a Jesuit, and entered later in turn the French, Palatine, and Russian military services; he became Danish Minister of War under Count Strunensee, then re - entered the French service, and at the beginning of the reign of Louis VI . , he tried, as Minister of War, to int roduce various changes into the French army ; these raised a violent storm of indignation; he was disgraced by the king and finally died in 1778. he is so often confounded with his mystic and philosophic namesake, that prevails showing the difference betwe en the two men; unfortunately the disgrace into which the soldier fell is but too often attributed to the mystic, to whom we will now turn our entire attention. That M. de St. Germain had intimate relations with many high persons in various countries is qu ite undeniable, the testimony on this point being overwhelming. That such relations should cause jealously and unkindly speculation is unfortunately not rare in any century. Lets us, however, see what some of these princely friends say. When question by th e Herzog Karl August as to the supernatural age of this mystic, the landgrave von Hessen - Phillips - Barchfeld replied: “We cannot speak with certainty on that point; the fact is the Count is acquainted with details about which only contemporaries of that per iod could give us information; it is now the fashison in Cassel to listen respectfully to his statements and not to be astonished at anything. The Count is known not to be an importunate sycophant; he is a man of good society to whom all are pleased to att ach themselves..... He at all events stands in close relation with many men of considerable importance, and exercises an incomprehensible influence on others. My cousin the Landgraf Karl von Hassen is much attached to him; they are eager Freemasons, and work together at all sorts of hidden arts..... He is supposed to have intercourse with ghosts and supernatural beings, who appear at his call.” 1 Herr Mauvillon, in spite of his personal prejudice against M. de St. Germain, is obliged to acknowledge the feeling o f the Duke towards the great alchemist. For on his supposed death being mentioned in the Brunswick newspaper of the period, wherein M. de St. Germain was spoken of as “a man of learning,” “a lover of truth,” “devoted to the good” and “a hater of baseness a nd deception,” the Duke himself wrote to the editor, expressing his approbation of the announcement. 2 In France M. de St. Germain appears to have been under the personal care, and enjoying the affection of Louis XV., who repeatedly declared that he would n ot tolerate any mockery of the Count, who was of high birth. It was this Minister, the Duc de Choiseul, to become a bitter enemy of the mystic, although he was at one time friendly to him, since the Baron de Gleichen in his memoirs says: “M. de St. Germain frequented the house of M. de Choiseul, and was well received there.” 3 The same writer, who later became one of his devoted students, testifies to the fact that M. de St. Germain ate no meat, drank no wine, and lived according to a strict regime .

Baron de), Souvenirs, Paris, 1868, p.126"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 spent whole evenings at Versailles with the King and thr royal family. One of the chief difficulties we find in tracing his history consists in the constant changes of name and title, a proceeding which seems to have aroused much antagonism and no little doubt. This fact should not, however, have made the public (of the period) dislike him, for it appears to have been the practice of persons of position, who did not wish to attr act vulgar curiosity; thus, for instance, we have the Duc de Medici traveling in the years 1698 and 1700 under the name of the Conte di Siena. The Graf Marcolini, when he went from dresen to Leipzig to meet M. de St. Germain, adopted another name. The Kur - Prinz Friedrich - Christian von Sachsen traveled in Italy from 1738 to 1740, under the name Comte Lausitz. Nearly all the members of the royal families in every country, during the last century, and even in this, adopted the same practice; but when M. deSt. Germain did so, we have all the small writers of that period and later calling him an advernturer and a charlatan for what appears to have been, practically, a custom of the time. Let us now make a list of these names and titles, bearing in mind that they cover a period of time dating from 1710 to 1822. the first date is mentioned by Baron de Gleichen, who says: “I have heard Rameau and as old relative of a French ambassador at Venice testify to having known M. de St. Germain in 1710, when he had appearance of a man of fifty years of age.” 4 The second date is mentioned by Mme. D’Adhemar in her most interesting Souvenirs sur Marie Antoinette. 5 During this time we have M. de St. Germain as the Marquis de Montferrat, Comte Bellamarre of Aymar at Venice, Chevali er Schoening at Pisa, Chevaller Weldon at Milan and Leipzig, Comte Soltikoff at Genoa and Leghor, Graf Tzarogy at Dresden, and Comte de St. Germain at Paris, the Hague, London, and St. Petersburg. No doubt all these varied changes gave ample scope and much material for curious speculations. A few words may fitly here be said about his personal appearance and education. From one contemporary writer we get the following sketch: ? “He looked about fifty, is neither stout nor thin, has a fine intellectual countenance, dresses very simply, but wit h taste; he wears the finest diamonds on snuff - box, watch and buckles. Much of the mystery with which he is surrounded is owing to his princely liberaltity.” Another writer, who knew him when at Anspach, says: “He always dined alone and very simply; his wa nts were extremely few; it was impossible while at Anspach to persuade him to dine at the Prince’s table.” M. de St. Germain appears to have been very highly educated. According to Karl von Weber, 6 “he spoke German, English, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish very well, and French with a Piedmontese accent.” It was almost universally accorded that he had a charming grace and courtliness of manner. He displayed, moreover, in society, a great variety of gifts, played several musical instruments excellently, and sometimes showed facilities and powers which bordered on the mysterious and incomprehensible. For example, one day he had dictated to him the first twenty verses of a poem, and wrote them si multaneously with both hands on two separate sheets of paper ? no one present   4 GLEICHEN (E. H.

In order to arriver at some orderly sequence, it will be well to divide our material into three parts: ? i. Theories about his birth and character, with personal details, some of which we have briefly noticed. ii. His travels and knowledge. iii. His political and mystical work. Beginning, then, with our first division, the theories about his birth and nationality are many and various; and different authors, according to their prejudices, trace his descent from prince or tax - gatherer, apparently as fancy dictates. Thus, among other parentages, we find him supposed to be descende d from: ? 1. The widow of Charles II. (King of Spain) ? the father a Madrid banker. 2. A Portuguese Jew. 3. An Alsatian Jew. 4. A tax - gather in Rotondo. 5. King of Portugal (natural son). 6. Franz - leopol, Prince Ragoczy, of Transylvania. This last seems to have been the cor rect view, according to the most reliable sources that have been found, and other information to which we have had access on this point. This theory is also held by Georg Hezekiel in his Abeteuerliche Gesellen, i., 35, Berlin, 1852. Karl von Weber (op. cit ., i., 318) also says that M> de St. Germain openly appeared in Leipzig in 1777 as Prince Ragoczy, and that he was often known as the graf Tzarogy, which latter is merely an anagram for Ragotzy (Ragoczy). This lastfact we have verified in another interesti ng set of articles, to which we shall refer later, written by a person who knew him at Anspach under the name Tzarogy. Another writer remarks: “His real origin would, perhaps, if revealed, have compromised important persons.” And this is the conclusion to which, after careful investigation, we have also come. Prince Karl of Hesse, 7 writing of M. de St. Germain, says: ? “Some curiosity may e felt as to his history; I will trace it with the utmost truthfulness, according to his own words, adding any necessary explanations. He told me that he was eight - eight years of age when he came h ere, and that he was the son of Prince Ragoczy 8 of Transylvania by his first wife, a Tekeli. He was placed, when quite young, under the care of the last Duc de Medici (Gian Gastone), who made him sleep while still a child in his own room. When M. de St. G ermain learned that his two brothers, sons of the Princess of Hesse - Wahnfried (Rheinfels), had become subject to the Emperor Charles VI., and had received the titles and names of St. Karl and St. Elizabeth, he said to himself: ‘Very well, I will call mysel f Sanctus Germano, the Holy Brother.’ I cannot in truth guaratee his birth, but that he was tremendously protected by the Duc de Medici I have learnt from another source.” Another well - known writer speaks on the same point, an author, moreover, who had acc ess to the valuable Milan archives; we refer to the late Casare Cantu, librarian of the great library in Milan, who in his historical work, Illustri Italiani, ii., 18, says: “The Marquis of San Germano appears to have been the son of Prince ragotzy (Ragocz y) of Transylvania; he was also much in Italy; much is recounted of his travels in Italy and in   7 HESSE - CA SSEL (Karl, Prinz de), Memoires de Mon Temps, p. 133 Copenhagen, 1861. 8 Ragoczy is the German spelling of this name. In Hungary it is written Rakoczy."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 Spain; he was greatly protected by the last Grand Duke of Tuscany, who had educated him.” It has been said that M. de St. Germain was educated at the University of Siena; Mne, de Genlis in her Memoires mentions having heard of him in Siena during a visit that she paid to that town. The whole life of M. de St Germain seems to have been more or less shadowed by the political troubles and struggles of his father. I n order to understand this we must take a brief survey of his family history, a survey which will moreover give us some clues, helping us to unravel the tangled web of mysterious elements which surrounded the life and work of the great occultist. Few pages of history are more deeply scored with sorrow, suffering and impotent struggle than those which tell the life story of the efforts of one Ragoczy after another to preserve the freedom of their principality, and to save it from being swallowed up by the ra pidly growing Austrian Empire under the influence of the Roman Church. In an old German book, Genealogische Archivarius aus dem Jahr 1734, pp. 409, 410,438, Leipzig, a sketch is given, on the death and descendants, from which we will quote some leading fac ts: Francis Leopold Racozi, or Rakoczy, according to the later spelling ? the father of the famous mystic ? made ineffectual efforts to reagin his throne, the principality of Siebenburgen. The Ragoczy property was wealthy and valuable, and Prince Francis, grandfather of the mystic of whom we are writing, had lost his life in a hopeless struggle to retain his freedom; on his death, his widow and children were seized by the Austrian Emperor, and hence the son, Francis Leopold, was brought up at the Court of V ienna. As our informant says: “The widowed Princess (who had remarried Graf Tekeli) was forced to hand over her children with their properties to the Emperor, who said he would become their guardian and be responsible for their education.” This arrangement was made in March, 1688, when, however, Prince Francis came of age, his properties, with many restrictions and limitations, were given back to him by the Emperor of Austria. In 1694 this Prince Ragoczy married at Koln - am - Rhein, Charlotte Amalia, daughter of the Landgraf Karl von Hesse - Wahnfried (of the line of Rhein - fels). Of this marriage there were three children, Joseph, George and Charlotte. Almost immediately after this period Prince Ragoczy began to lead the conspiracies of his noblemen against the A ustrian Empire, with the object of regaining his independent power. The history of the struggle is most interesting in every way, and singularly pathetic. The Prince was defeated and all his properties were confiscated. The sons had to give up the name of Ragoczy, and to take the titles of St. Carlo and St. Elizabeth. Let us notice what Hezekiel 9 has to say on this point, for he has made some very careful investigations on the subject: “We are, in fact, inclined to think the Comte de St. Germain was the you nger son of the Prince Franz - Leopold Ragoczy and the Princess Charlotte Amalia of Hesse - Wahnfried. Franz - Leopold Ragoczy and the Princess Charlotte Amalia of Hesse - Wahnfried. Fran - Leopold was married in 1694, and by this marriage he had two sons, who were taken prisoners by the Austrians and brought up as Roman Catholics; they were also forced to give up the dreaded name of Ragoczy. The eldest son, calling himself the Marquis of San Carlo, escaped from Vienna in 1734. In this year, after fruitless struggles , his father died at Rodosto in Turkey, and was buried in Smyrna. The eldest son then received his father’s Turkish pension, and was acknowledged Prince of Siebenburgen (Transylvania). He carried on the ame warfare as his father, fought against   9 Op. cit., I., 45."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 and was dri ven away by Prince Ferdinand of Lobkowitz, and finally died forgotten in Turkey. The younger brother took no part in the enterprises of his elder brother, and appears, therefore, to have been always on good terms with the Austrian Government.” Adverse writ ers have made much mystery over the fact that the Comte de St. Germain was rich and always had money at hisdisposal; indeed, those writers who enjoyed calling him a “charlatan and a swindler” did not refrain also from hinting that his money must have been ill - gotten; many even go so far as to say that he made it by deceiving people and exercising an undue influence over them. If we turn to the old Archivarius already mentioned, we find some very definite information that not only shows us whence the large f ortune possessed by this mystic was derived, but also why he was so warmly welcomed by the King of France, and was so well known at all the courts of Europe. No obscure adventurer is this with whom we are dealing, but a man of princely blood, and of almost royal descent. Turning back to the old chronicle we find in the volume for 1736 the will of the late Prince Franz - Leopold Ragoczy, in which both his sons are mentioned who have been already named, and also a third son. 9 It also states that Louis XIV, had bought landed property for this Prince Ragoczy from the Polish Queen Maria, the rents of which property were invested by the order of the King of France in the Hotel de Ville in Paris. We also find that considerable legacies were left which were to be dema nded from the Crown of France. The executors of this will were the Duc de Bourbon, the Duc de Maine and the Comte de Charleroi and Toulouse. To their care Prince Ragoczy committed his third son, to whom also he left a large legacy and other rights on this valuable property. Hence we must cast aside the theories that M. de St. Germain was a homeless and penniless adventurer, seeking to make money out of any kindly disposed person. These were the views and ideas of the newspaper and review writers of that day , put forward in the leading periodicals. Unfortunately the law of heredity prevails in this class of people, and there is a remarkable similarity between the epithets hurled by the press of the nineteenth century at the venturesome occultist of today and those flung at M. de St. Germain and other mystics of lesser importance and minor merit. We will now pass from this portion of our subject to some of the personal incidents related of M. de St. Germain; perhaps the most interesting are those given by one w ho knew him personally in Anspach during the period that he was in close connection with the Markgraf. It appears that the mystic made two visits at different times to Schwalbach, and thence he went to Triesdorf. We will let the writer speak for himself on this point: ? “On hearing that a stranger, both remarkable and interesting, was at Schwalbach, the Markgraf of Brandenburg - Anspach invited him to come to Triesdorf in the spring, and the Graf Tzarogy (for this was the name under which he appeared) accepte d this invitation, on the condition that they would allow him to live in his own way quite unnoticed and at peace. He was lodged in the lower rooms of the Castle, below those occupied by Mademoiselle Clairon. The Markgraf and his wife lived in the Falken h aus. The Graf Tzarogy had no servant of his own; he dined as simply as possible in his own room, which he seldom left. His wants were extremely few, and he avoided all general society, spending the evenings in the company of only the Markgraf, Mademoiselle Clairon, and   9 This is the son, mentioned by Prince Charles of Hesse, who was placed under the ca re of the last of the Medici."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 those persons whom the former was pleased to have around him. It was impossible to persuade the Graf Tzarogy to dine at the Prince’s table, and he only saw the Markgrafin a few times, although she was very curous to make the acquaintance of t his strange individual. In conversation the Graf was most entertaining, and showed much knowledge of the world and of men. He was always specially glad to speak of his childhood and of his mother, to whom he never referred without emotion, and often with t ears in his eyes. If one could believe him, he had been brought up like a Prince. One day Tzarogy showed the Markgraf an invitation which he had received, sent by a courier, from the Graf Alexis Orloff, who was just returning from Italy; the letter pressed Graf Tzarogy to pay him a visit, as Graf Orloff was passing through Nuremberg.... The Markgraf went with Graf Tzarogy to Nuremberg, where the Graf Alexis Orloff had already arrived. On their arrival Orloff, with open arms, came forward to meet and embrace t he Graf Tzarogy, who now appeared for the first time in the uniform of a Russian General; and Orloff called him several times, ‘Caro padre,’ ‘ Caro amico.’ The Graf Alexis received the Markgraf of Branden - burg - Anspach with the most marked politeness, and t hanked him several times for the protection which the Markgraf had accorded to his worthy friend; they dined together at midday. The conversation was most interesting; they spoke a good deal of the campaign in the Archipelago, and still more about useful a nd scientific discoveries. Orloff showed the Markgraf a piece of unignitable wood, which when tested produced neither flames nor cinders, but simply fell to pieces in light ashes, after it had swollen up like a sponge. After dinner Graf Orloff took the Gra f Tzarogy into next room, where they remained for some considerable time together. The writer, who was standing at the window under which the carriages of Graf Orloff were drawn up, remarked that one of the Graf’s servants came, opened one of the carriage doors and took out from the box under the seat a large red leather bag, and carried it upstairs to the other room. After their return to Anspach the Graf Tzarogy showed them, for the first time, his credentials as a Russian General with the Imperial seal a ttached; he afterwards informed the Markgraf that the name Tzarogy was an assumed name, and that his real name was Ragotzy, and that he was the sole representative and descendant of the late exiled Prince Ragotzy of Sievenburgen of the time of the Emperor Leopold”. 10 So far this narrative is tolerably accurate, but after this point the author proceeds with the history of what he considers the “unveiling” of the “notorious Comte de St. Germain,” in which all the various theories about his birth, to which we h ave already referred, are retold withembellishments. Amongst other wild reports, it was stated that M. de St. Germain had only become acquainted with the Orloffs in Leghorn in 1770, whereas there are various historical proofs showing, without doubt, that h e was in 1762 in St. Petersburg, where he knew the Orloffs well. We have moreover heard in Russia that he was staying with the Princess Marie Galitzin at Archangelskoi on March 3rd, 1762. The following details were found in Russia, and sent by a Russian fr i end: ? “The Comte de St. Germain was here in the time of Peter III. And left when Catherine II. Came to the throne. M. Pyliaeff 11 thinks even before Catherine’s time. “At St. Petersburg St. Germain lived with Count Rotari, the famous Italian painter, who wa s the painter of the beautiful portraits which are in the Peterhof palace. “The street where they lived is supposed to be the Grafsky Pereoulok (‘pereoulok’   10 Curositdten der Literarisch - historischen Vor - und Mitwell, pp. 285,286.

St. Germain was a splendid violinist, he ‘played like an orchestra.’ In the ‘story of the Razoamovsky family’ Alexis R. was reported to have spoken of a beautifu lmoonstone St. Germain had in his possession. “M. Pyliaeff has seen (he c annot remember where now) a piece of music, some air for the harp, dedicated to Countess Ostermann by St. Germain’s own hand signed. It is bound beautifully in red maroquin. The date is about 1760. “M. Pyliaeff thinks that St. Germain was not in Moscow. He says the Youssoupoff family has many MSS. In old chests and that St. Germain was in relations with a Prince Youssoupoff to whom he gave the elixir for long life. He says, too, that St. Germain did not bear the name of Saltykoff (Soltikow) in Russia but th at in Vienna he did take this name. “About the music signed by St. Germain, M. Pyliaeff now recollects that it belonged to him himself. He bought it at some sale and had it for some time. Then he gave it to the famous composer Peter Charkowsky as a present . It must now be in Chaikowsky’s papers, but as the great musician had very little order, M. Pyliaeff thinks it very unlikely that it could be found, especially as at Chaikowsky’s sudden death all was left without any directions being given about the prope rty.” We have said that the political events in his family ahd to some extent shadowed the life of M. de St. Germain; one remarkable instance of this we will now cite: it is, as far as we know, the only one in which he himself makes any direct reference to it, and it occurs some time later than the events which we have just been relating. After the return of the Markgraf from Italy, whither he had gone in 1776, and where he had heard some of the legends and favrications above referred to, he appears to have sent the writer whom we have quoted to Schwalbach to see the Graf Tzarogy, and to test his bona fides. We will continue the history as he gives it. “On his arrival, he found M. de St. Germain ill in bed. When the matter was explained to him, he admitted w ith perfect coolness that he had assumed from time to time all the names mentioned, even down to that of Soltikow; but he said he was known on all sides, and to many people, under these names, as a man of honour, and that if any calumniator were venturing to accuse him of nefarious transactions, he was ready to exculpate himself in the most satisfactory manner, as soon as he knew of what he was accused, and who the accuser was who dared to attack him. He steadily asserted that he had not told the Markgraf a ny lies with reference to his name and his family. The proofs of his origin, however, were in the hands of a person on whom he was dependent (i.e., the Emperor of Austria), a dependence which had brought on him, in the courses of his life, the greatest esp ionage.... When he was asked why he had not informed the Markgraf about the different names under which he had appeared in so many different places, the Graf Tzarogy answered that he was under no obligations to Markgraf, and that since he offended no one and did no person any harm, he would only give such personal information after and not before he had dealings with them. The Graf said he had never abused the confidence of the Markgraf; he had given his real name.... After this he still remained at Schwalbach. ” A little later the author of the paragraph just quoted remarks: “What resources M. de St. Germain had, to defray the necessary expenses of his existence, is hard to guess.” 12 It appears curious to us that the writer knew so little of contemporary history. As we   12 Curiositaten, op. cit., pp. 287, 289, 293, 294."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 have seen, all the sons of Prince Ragoczy were amply provided for, and the proofs were even more accessible than they are in our day. He goes on to say in conclusion: “It would be an ungrateful task to declare that this man was a swindler; for this proofs are required and they are not to be had.” This is truly an ingenious statement, but borders somewhat on libel; to speak of any one as a swindler without any proof is beyond the bounds of ordinary fairness, and it is especially incongruous in view of the final paragraph, which is as follows: “As long as the Graf had dealings with the Markgraf, he never asked for anything, and never received anything of the slightest value, and never mixed himself up in anything which did not concern him. On account of his extremely simple life, his wants were very limited; when he had money he shared with the poor.” If we compare these words with those spoken of M. de St. Germain by his friend Prince Charles of Hesse, we shall find they are in perfect accord. The only wonder is that a writer who speaks such words of praise can even hit that his subject might be a “swindler.” If such words can be rightly spoken of an “adventurer,” then would it be well for the world if a few more of like sort could be found. We shall fin d similar extraordinary contradictions in various writers as we proceed further with the life of M. de St. Germain.

LET us now trace, as far as we can with any detailed information, the steps of M. de St. Germain in some of his extended travels. That he had been in Africa, India and China we gather from various hints he gives us, and also from facts stated by many writers at different times. That such travels should seem aimless and trivial to the same writers is not a matter of surprise, but to students of mysticism, and especially those to whom the “Great Lodge” is a fact mankind, to those students the widely extended travels of this “messenger” from that Lodge will not be surprising; rather they will seek below the surface ,and try to understand the mission and the work that he came to do among the children of men. We must bear in mind, moreover, t hat in the ancient world the arts and sciences were regarded as divine gifts; the gifts of the gods. “Kings of the ‘Divine Dynasties,’ they gave the first impulse to civilization, and perfection of all the arts and sciences.” 13 Conceited in their shallow i gnorance the generality of mankind scorn the gifts and turn away from the givers. Some few centuries ago such givers and teachers were silenced at the stake, like Giordano Bruno, and many others whom time has now justified in the eyes of men. Then, later, after the reaction of free thought in the eighteenth century we find Mesmer and the Comte de St. Germain giving up, not their lives, but their good names and characters in trying to help those to whom they were sent by the Great Lodge. Let us now take up t he thread of these travels, and in order to make them as clear as possible follow them in the order of their dates. These range, as we have seen in our last chapter from 1710 to 1822, we shall, however, not be able to deal very fully with each period, for M. de St. Germain often disappeared for many months at a time, the earliest records we can gather are as follows: ? “There appeared at the Court 14 in these days an extraordinary man, who called himself   13 BLAVA TSKY (H. P.). The Secret Doctrine, ii., p. 380. London, 1893. 14 The Court of Louis XV."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 Comte de St, Germain. At first he distinguished himself through his cleverness and the great diversity of his talents, but in another respect he soon aroused the greatest astonishment. “The old Countess v. Georgy who fifty years earlier had accompanied her husband to Venice where he had the appointment of amba ssador, lately met St. Germain at Mme. De Pompadour’s. For some time she watched the stranger with signs of the greatest surprise, in which was mixed not a little fear. Finally, unable to control her excitement, she approached the Count more out of curiosi ty than in fear. “ ‘Will you have the kindness to tell me,’ said the Countess, ‘ whether your father was in Venice about the year 1710?’ “ ‘No, Madame,’ replied the Count quite unconcerned, ‘ it is very much longer since I lost my father; but I myself was living in Venice at the end of the last and the beginning of this century; I had the honour to pay you court then, and you were kind enough to admire a few Barcarolles of my composing which we used to sing together.’ “ ‘Forgive me, but that is impossible; the Comte de St. German I knew in those days was at least 45 years old, and you, at the outside, are that age at present.’ “ ‘Madame,’ replied the Count smiling, ‘I am very old.’ “ ‘ But then you must be nearly 100 years old.’ “ ‘That is not impossible.’ A nd the Count recounted to Mme. V. Georgy a number of familiar little details which had reference in common to both, to their sojourn in the Venitian States. He offered, if she still doubted him, to bring back to her memory certain circumstances and remarks , which.... “ ‘No, no,’ interrupted the old ambassadress, ‘ I am already convinced. For all that you are a most extraordinary man, a devil.’ “ ‘For pity’ sake! ’ exclaimed St. Germain in a thundering voice, ‘ no such names!’ “He appeared to be seized with a cramp - like trembling in every limb, and left the room immediately. “I mean to get to know this peculiar man more intimately. ‘St. Germain is of medium height and elegant manners; his features are regular; his complexion brown; his hair black; his face mobi le and full of genius; his carriage bears the impress and the mobility common only to the great. The Count dresses simply but with taste. His only luxury consists of a large number of diamand, with which he is fairly covered; he wears them on every finger, and they are set in his snuffboxes and his watches. One evening e appeared at court with shoebuckles, which Herr v. Gontaut, an expert on precious stones, estimated at 200,000 Francs. “A matter worthy of remark is that the Count speaks French, English, Ge rman, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese equally perfectly; so much so that he converses with any of the inhabitants of the above countries in their mother tongue, they are unable to discover the slightest foreign accent. The learned and the Oriental scholars have proved the knowledge of the Count St. Germain. The former found him more apt in the languages of Homer and Virgil than themselves; with the latter he spoke Sanscrit, Chinese, Arabic in such a manner as to show them that he had made some lengthy stay in Asia, and that the languages of the East were but poorly learned in the Colleges of Louis The great and Montaigne. “The Comte de St. Germain accompanied on the piano without music, not only every song but also the most difficult concerti, played on var ious instruments. Rameau was"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 much impressed with the playing of this dilettante, and especially struck at his improvising. “The Count paints beautifully in oils; but that which makes his paintings so remarkable is a particular colour, a secret, which he ha s discovered, and which lends to the painting an extraordinary brilliancy. In his historical pieces, St. Germain always introduces into the dress of the women, sapphires, rubies and emeralds of such brilliant hue that they seem to have borrowed their beaut y from the original gems. Banloo, who never tires in his admiration of the surprising colouring, has often requested the Count to let him participate in his secret; the latter, however, will not divulge it. “Without attempting to sit in judgement on the kn owledge of a fellow - being, of whom at this very moment that I am writing, bother court and town have exhausted all surmises, one can, I think, well asset that a portion of his miracles is due to his knowledge of physics and chemistry in which sciences he i s well grounded. At all events it is palpable that his knowledge has laid the seeds for him of sound good health; a lif e which will ? or which also endowed him with the means of preventing the ravages of time from affecting the body. Among other statements, concerning the Count’s astounding qualities, made to the Favourite by Mme. V. Georgy after her first meeting with the Count after her first meeting with the Count after this lapse of years, was that during her frist stay in Venice, she received from him an Elixir which for fully a quarter of a century preserved unaltered the youthful charms she possessed at 25. elderly g entlemen, whom Mme, de Pompadour questioned concerning this peculiar incident, gave the assurance that this was the truth, adding that the standing still in youthful appearance of Mme. V. Georgy supported by the testimony of these old men would make it app ear still more probable. “One evening at a party St. Germain accompanied several Italian airs for the young Comtesse afterwards so celebrated under the name of Comtesse de Genlis, then aged ten years. “When she had finished singing, the Count said to her: ‘ in five or six years you will have a very beautiful voice, which you will have a very beautiful voice, which you will preserve a longtime; in order to perfect the charm you should also preserve your beauty; this will be your happy fate between your 16th and 17th year.’ “ ‘But, Count,’ answered the child, while allowing her pretty fingers to glide over the notes, ‘that does not lie in any one’s power.’ “ ‘Oh yes,’ answered the Count carelessly, ‘only tell me whether it would give you pleasure to remain at that age?’ “ ‘Truly that would be charming.’ “ ‘Well I promise it you.’ And St. Germain spoke of other matters. “Encouraged by the friendliness of this fashionable man, the Countess’ mother ventured to ask him if Germany was his Fatherland. “ ‘Madame,’ sai d he, sighing deeply, ‘there are some things of which one may not speak. Suffice it to know that at seven years of age I was wandering in woods, and that a price was set upon my head. On my birthday my mother, whom I was not to see again, bound her portrai t round my arm; I will shew it to you.” “At these words St. Germain threw up his sleeve and shewe the ladies the miniature of an exceptionally beautiful woman, but represented in rather a peculiar costume. “ ‘To what date does this dress belong?’ asked the young countess. Without answering this question, the Count put down his sleeve again, and brought forward another topic."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 Every day one was surprised by a fresh miracle in Count St. Germain’s company. Some little time previously he had brought Mme. Depompa dour a bonbonniere which was universally admired. It was worked very beautifully in black enamel, and on the lid was an agate. The Count begged the Marquise to place the bonbonniere near the fire; a few minutes later she went to take it away. How great was the astonishment of all present: the agate had disappeared, and in its place was to be seen a pretty shepherdess in the midst of her flock. “After the bonboniere had again been placed near the fire, the shepherdess disappeared, and the agate re - appeared.” 15 this epsode was written down in 1750, but the facts mentioned took place in 1723. It must be carefully noticed that all the personal friends of M. de St. Germain were in high position, chiefly Austrians and Hungarians, all men of high birth and noble fam ily, his own kith and kin; among them we find Prince Kaunitz, Prince Ferdinand Lobkowitz, Graf Zobor, Graf Maximilian Joseph von Lamberg, men of public position, and well known families. From 1737 to 1742, our mystic was at the Court of the Shah of Persia, and it is here that he probably acquired his knowledge of diamonds and precious stones, for according to his own very credible statement, it was here that he began to understand the secrets of Nature; but his arduously acquired knowledge leads us to infer a long period of careful study. These hints we gather from F. W. von Bathold 16 in his interesting work, and they confirm the statement made by another writer that M. de St. Germain had been pursuing his researches in Persia. We next find him in England, du ring the Jacobite Revolution of 1745, suspected as a spy, and arrested. Two interesting extracts can here be quoted. The first is from Horace Walpole’s 17 amusing letters to sir Horace Mann, the British Envoy at Florence. Writing on Dec. 9th, 1745, Walpole, after relating all the excitements produced by the Revolution, says: “The other day they seized an odd man who goes by the name of Count St. Germain. He has been here these two years, and will not tell who he is or whence, but professes that he does not go by his right name. He sings and plays on the violin wonderfully, is mad, and not very sensible.” The second reference to this stay in England may be found in Read’s Weekly Journal or British gazetteer, may 17th, 1760, and is as follows: “The author of the Brussels’ Gazette tells us that the person who styles himself Comte de St. Germain, who lately arrived here from Holland, was born in Italy in 1712. He speaks German and French as fluently as Italian, and expresses himself pretty well in English. He has a smattering of all the arts and sciences, is a good chemist, a virtuoso in musick, and a very agreeable companion. In 1746 [1745 according to Walpole], he was on the point of being ruined in England. One who was jealous of him with a lady, slipt a letter i nto his pocket as from the young Pretender (thanking him for his services and desiring him to continue them), and immediately had him taken up by a messenger. His innocence being fully proved on his examination, he was discharged out of the custody of the messenger and asked to dinner by Lord H.

Maubert) to hear that he has incu rred the Christian King’s displeasure.” This last paragraph alludes to what occurred at a later period. After this date, 1745, it seems that M. de St. Germain went to Vienna, and spent some time, in that city, 18 and in 1755 went to India, for the second tim e, as we gather from a letter of his written to the Graf von Lamberg, to which we shall refer again later on. “I am indebted,” he writes, “for my knowledge of melting jewels to my second journey to India, in the year 1755, with General Clive, who was under Vice Admiral Watson. On my first journey I had only a very faint idea of the wonderful secret of which we are speaking; all the attempts that I made in Vienna, Paris and London, are worthless as experiments; the great work was interrupted at the time I ha ve mentioned.” Every writer, adverse or favourable, mentions and lays stress on the wonderful power of improving precious stones that was possessed by M. de St. Germain. Indeed almost every sort of art seems to have been more or less known to him, judging by the many testimonies that we have on these points. Our next date, 1757, brings us to the period which is best known to the public. M. de St. Germain was introduced at Paris by the then Minister of War, Marechal and Comte de Belle - Isle; but as we have se en from the records already cited, neither M. de St. Germain nor his family were unknown to Louis XV. Hence we do not wonder at the cordial and gracious reception with which he met, nor can we be astonished that the king assigned him a suite of rooms at th is royal Chateau of Chambord. Here there was a laboratory fitted up for experiments, and a group of students gatered round our mystic. Among these we find the Baron de Gleichen, and Marquise d’Urfe and also the Princess of Anhalt - Zerbst, mother of Catherin e II. Of Russia. Madame de Genlis, 19 speaking of him at this period, says: ? “He was well acquainted with physics, and was a very great chemist. My father, who was well qualified to judge, was a great admirer of his abilities in this way.... M. de St. Germain never would consent to give up his secret.” Madame du Hausset relates in her memoirs an interesting instance of his knowledge of precious stones. “The King,” says she, “ordered a middling - sized diamond which had a flaw in it, to be brought to him. After having it weighed, his Majesty said to the Comte: ‘The value of this diamond as it is, and with the flaw in it, is six thousand livres; without the flaw it would be worth at least ten thousand. Will you undertake to make me a gainer of four thousand livres?’ St Germain examined it very atten tively, and said, ‘It is possible; it may be done. I will bring it to you again in a month.’ “At the time appointed the Comte de St. Germain brought back the diamond without a spot, and gave it to the King. It was wrapped in a cloth of amianthos, which he took off. The King had it weighed immediately, and found it very diminished. His Majesty then   18 “He had lived as a prince in Vienna from 1745 to 1746, was very well received, and the first minister of the Emperor [F rancis I.], Prince Ferdinand von Lobkowitz, was his most intimate friend. The latter introduced him to the French Marechal de Belle - Isle who had been sent by King Louis XV. On a special embassy to the Court at Vienna. Belle - Isle, the wealthy grandson of Fo uquet, was so taken with the brilliant and witty St. Germain, that he persuaded him to accompany him on a visit to Paris.” Historische Herinneringen, van C. A. Van SYPESTEYN; ‚sGravenhage, 1869. 19 GENLIS (Comtesse de), Memoires Inedits pour servir a l’Hist oire des XVIII. Et XIX. Siecles, p. 88.

The King, however, sent for the diamond back again, and said he would keep it as a curiosity. He could not overcome his surprise, and said M. de St. Germain must be worth millions, especially if he possessed the secret of making large diamonds out of small ones. The Comte neither said that he could or could not, bu t positively asserted that he knew how to make pearls grow, and give them the finest water. The King paid him great attention, and so did Madame de Pompadour. M. du Quesnoy once said that St. Germain was a quack, but the King reprimanded him. In fact, his Majesty appears infatuated with him, and sometimes talks of him as if his descent were illustrious.” One fact in this Parisian period must not be omitted; it appears from statements made by Madam du Hausset, 20 Herr von Barthold and the Baron de Gleichen, th at a yound Englishman, at that time resident in Paris, Lord Gower by name, used to amuse himself and other idle people by passing himself off as M. de St. Germain, so that most of the silly and foolish tales about him, which ran riot in the gossiping “salo ns” of the period, originated in the say ins of this idle young fellow. V arious details of his doings are to be found, but they are not worth further notice, beyond the fact that M. de St. Germain had to bear the blame for utterances which did not originate with him. Says Heer van Sypesteyn: 21 “Many of the wild stories had probably nothing to do with M. de St. Germain and were invented with the object of injuring him and making him ridiculous. A certain Parisian wag, known as ‘Milord Gower,’ was a splendid mi mic, and went into Paris salons to play the part of St. Germain ? naturally it was very exaggerated, but very many people were taken in by this make - believe St. Germain. Meanwhile our philosopher worked on with those whom he was able to help and teach in v arious ways. In 1760 we find him set by Louic XV. To the Hague on a political mission: the circumstances are variously told by different writers. In April, 1760, we find M. de St. Germain passing through East Friesland to England. 22 Next, in The London Chro nicle of June 3rd, 1760, we have a long account of a “mysterious foreigner,” who had just arrived on England’s shores. It is also said by one writer that he was well received at Court, and may papers of the period mention him as a “person of note” to whom marked attention was paid.²(² Gasette of the Netherlands. Jan. 12th, 1761. The Hague, Jan. 2nd. “Letters from Paris state that when starting for this country, to which he came without asking permission of the King, M. de St. Germain returned his Red Ribb on: but it is practically certain that he has an understanding with the King of Denmark. “The 3rd. “The so - called Count of St. Germain is an incomprehensible man of whom nothing is known; neither his name nor his origin, nor his position; he has an incom e, no one knows from whence it is derived; acquaintances, no one knows where he made them; entry into the Cabinets of Princes without being acknowledged by them!”) In the British Museum ther are pieces of music composed by the Comte de St. Germain on both his visits, for they are dated 1745 and 1760. It was said everywhere, by enemies as well as by friends, that he was a splendid violinist; he “played like an orchestra.” There is one most interesting souvenir of M. de St. Germain, which we have had the goo d fortune to see. It is preserved in the library of the grand old castle of Raudnitz in Bohemia, the property of Prince Gerdinand von Lobkowitz.   20 HAUSSET (Madame du), Memoires, p. 148, seq.; Paris, 1824. 21 Op. cit. 22 HEZEKIEL i.

And other treasures of that rare collection we found a book of music composed by M. de St. Ger main, from which, by the gracious permission of the present Prince, we have had traced the inscription and autograph. It runs thus: ? “Pour le Prince de Lobkowitz, Musique Raisonee, selon le bon sens, aux Dmaes Angloises qui aiment le vrai gout en cet art.  “Par... de St. Germain.” The first letter, or letters, of the signature are quite undecipherable, although they have been most carefully traced for us by the librerian at Raudnitz. We next have to pass on to St. Petersburg where , according to the words of the Graf Gregor Orloff to the Margrave of Brandenburg - Anspach, M. de St. Germain had “played a great part in their revolution.” ¹(¹Curiositaten der Literariseh - historischen Vor und Mitwelt, pp.285, 286. Weimar, 1818.) He is ment ioned as having been in St. Petersburg by another writer, or rather in an anonymous book, the translation of the title of which runs: “A few Words about the First Helpers of Catherine II.” (xviii. BK. 3, p. 343, 1869). The writer has other details in her p ossession, but as fragments, it is better to wait for more accurate information, which she hopes to procure. Various hints, however, lead us to suppose that M. de St. Germain passed some time in Russia. As we have noticed already the Princess of Anhalt - Zer bst, the mother of Catherine II., was very friendly to him; indeed he passed much time at her house in Paris. In 1763, however, we get a deeply interesting account of our philosopher in the shape of a letter from the Graf Karl Cobenzl to the Prince Kaunitz , the Prime Minister. The details it gives are so interesting that it is better to quote it in full: ?  “BRUSSELS, April 8th, 1763. “GRAF KARL COBENZL TO KAUNITZ. “It was about three months ago that the person known b y the name of the Comte de St. Germain passed this way, and came to see me. I found him the most singular man that I ever saw in my life. I do not yet precisely know his birth; I believe, however, that he is the son of a clandestine union in a powerful and illustrious family. Possessing great wealth, he lives in the greatest simplicity; he knows everything, and shows an uprightness, a goodness of soul, worthy of admiration. Among a number of his accomplishments, he made, under my own eyes, some experiments, of which the most important were the transmutation of iron into a metal as beautiful as gold, and at least as good for all goldsmith’s work; the dyeing and preparation of skins, carried to a perfection hitherto unknown; the like dyeing of woolens; the dye ing of wood in the most brilliant colours penetrating through and through, and the whole without either indigo or cochineal, with the commonest ingredients, and consequently at a very moderate price; the composition of colours for painting, ultra - marine is as perfect as is made from lapis lazuli; and finally, removing the smell from painting oils, and making the best oil of Provence from the oils of Navette, of Colsat, and from others, even the most. I have in my hands all these productions, made under my o wn eyes; I have had them undergo the most strict examinations, and seeing in these articles a profit which might mount up to millions, I have endeavoured to take advantage of the friendship that this man has felt for me, and to learn from him all these sec rets. He has given them to me, and he asks nothing for himself beyond a payment proportionate to the profits that may accrue from them, it"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 being understood that this shall be only when the profit has been made. As the marvelous must inevitable seem uncerta in, I have avoided the two pints which appeared to me to be feared, the first, the being a dupe, and the second, the involving myself in too great an expenditure. To avoid the first, I took a trusty person, under whose eyes I had the experiments made, and I was fully convinced of the trality and the cheapness of these productions. And as to the second, I referred M. de Zurmont (which is the name that St. Germain has taken) to a good and trustworthy merchant at Tournay, with whom he is working, and I have ha d advances made which mount up to very little, through Nettine, whose son, and the son - in - law of Walckiers, are the persons who will carry on these manufactures, when the profits of the first experiments place us in a position to establish them, without ri sking anything of our own. The moment for deriving the profit is already close at hand”. 23 From another source, also, we hear of de St. Germain at Tournay, namely, from the memoirs of Casanova. “Casanova on the road to Tournay was informed of the presence o f M. le Comte de St. Germain, and desired to be presented to him. Being told that the Comte received no one, he wrote him to request an interview, which was grated under the restriction of coming incognito, and not being invited to partake of food with him . Casanova found the Comte in the dress of an Armenian with a long beard.” In this interview, M. de St. Germain informed Casanova that he was arranging a Fabrique for the Graf Cobenzl. 24 From 1763, the date at which we have now arrived, up to 1769, we onl y get the details of one year in Berlin, and this account comes from the memoirs of M. Dieudonne Thiebault, who gives the space of a year a remarkable man, who passed by the name of the comte de St. Germain. The Abbe Pernety was not slow in recognizing in him the characteristics which go to make up an adept, and came to us with wonderful stories.” The author then goes on to relate that the Princess Amelie went to call on him, and he also remarks that the old baron Knyhausen was always addressed by M. de St. Germain as “my son.” Says our author: ? “Madame de Troussel was also anxious to see him. The Abbe Pernety arranged the matter for her, and the Comte came to her house one evening to supper. They chanced to make mention of the ‘Philosopher’s stone,’ and th e Comte curtly observed that most people who were in persuit of that were astonishingly illogical, inasmuch as they employed no agent but fire, forgetting that fire breaks up and decomposes, and that consequently it was mere folly to depend upon it for the building up of new composition. He dwelt much upon it for the building up of a new composition. He dwelt much upon this, and finally led the conversation back to more general topics. In appearance M. de St. Germain was refined and intellectual. He was cle arly of gentle birth, and had moved in good society; and it was reported that the famous Cagliostro (so well known for his mystification of Cardina Rohan and others at Paris) had been his pupil. The pupil, however, never reached the level of his master and , while the latter finished his career without mishap, Cagliostro was often rash to the point of criminality, and died in the prison of the inquisition at Rome.... In the history of M. de St. Germain, we have the history of a wise and prudent man who never w illfully offended against the code of   23 ARNETH (A.

Marvels we have without end, never anything mean or scandalous.” 25 The exact date of this visit to Berlin w cannot accurately give, but it comes in before the stay in Venice, where he was found by the Graf Max von Lamberg, 26 at this time Chamberlain to the Emperor Joseph II., and in his book we have some most interesting details. The Graf finds M. de St. Germain under the name of Marquis d’Aymar, or Belmare, mak ing a variety of experiments with flax, which he was bleaching to look like Italian silk; he had established quite a large place, and had about a hundred workers. It would appear that he then traveled with the Graf von Lamberg, for in a paper published at Florence Lenotizie del Mondo (July, 1770), under the heading “News of the World,” we find the following paragraph: ? “TUNIS, July 1770. “The Comte Maximilian de Lamberg, 27 Chamberlain of M. M. L. L. II. And RR. Having paid a visit to the Island of Corsica t o make various investigations, has been staying here since the end of June, in company with the Signor de St. Germain, celebrated in Europe for the vastness of his political and philosophical knowledge.” No further details are given of this journey, but we hear of M. de St. Germain being in Mantua in the year 1773. One important point which belongs to the year 1770 has been omitted. M. de St. Germain was at Leghorn when the Russian fleet was there; he wore a Russian uniform, and was called Graf Saltikoff by the Graf Alexis Orloff. It was, moreover, in this year that he returned to Paris, on the disgrace of the Prime Minister, his enemy, the Duc de Choiseul. “All his abilities, especially his extraordinary kindness,” says Heer van Sypesteyn (op. cit.), “yes, even magnanimity, which formed his essential characteristics, had made him so respected and so beloved, that when in 1770, after the fall of the Duc de Choiseul, his arch enemy, he again appeared in Paris, it was only with the greatest expressions of sorro w that the Parisians allowed him to depart.... M. de St. Germain came to the Hague after the death of Louis XV. (May 10th, 1774), and left for Schwalbach in 1774. This was the last time he visited Holland. It cannot be ascertained with accuracy how often he was there.... It is stated in a German biography that he was in Holland in 1710, 1735, 1742, 1748, 1760 and 1773.” This last date brings us to the period that we have already noticed, the stay at Triesdorf and at Schwalbach, where many alchemical and other e xperiments were carried on by the Markgraf and the Comte. The former we hear was proud of his medical knowledge, and obtained from the English Consul at Leghorn a copy of the prescription for the “Russian Tea” or “Aqua Benedetta,” made by M. de St. Germain , which was used in the Russian fleet, then in the Archipelago, to preserve the health of the troops under the severe heat. From 1774 until 1776 we have the visit to Triesdorf; in 1776 we hear of our mystic in Leipzig, and the following year in Dresden; wi th these period we shall have to deal in our   25 THIEBAULT (D.), Mes Douvenirs de Vingt Ans de Sejour a Berlin, iv., p. 83.

London, 1775 27 Some interesting matter concerning the Comte de St. Germain is printed in a most interesting book lately published, Casanova et son temps, by E. Maynial. One entirely new and most interesting fact is given by him: a correspondence has been found at Prague between the Comte de Lamberg and M. de St. Germain and is no w in the hands of a well known Austrian writer, who is putting it in order; no doubt before long M. Gugitz will publish these cocuments."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 next paper. About 1779 we hear of M. de St. Germain at Hamburg; thence he goes to Prince Karl of Hesse and stays with him for some time as his loved and honoured guest. They began various experiments together, e xperiments which were in all cases to be of use to the human race. Writing of the knowledge and alluding to the early education of M. de St. Germain by th eDuc de Medici, the Prince says: “This House (Medici), as is well know, was in possession of the high est knowledge, and it is not surprising that he should have drawn his earlier knowledge from them; but he claimed to have learned that Nature by his own application and researches. He thoroughly understood herbs and plants, and had invented the medicines o f which he constantly made use, and which prolonged his life and health. I still have all his recipes, but the physicians ran riot much against his science after his death. There was a physician, Lossau, who had been an apothecary, and to whom I gave 1,200 crowns a year to work at the medicines which the Comte de St. Germain taught him, among others and chiefly his tea, which the rich bought and the poor received gratis.... After the death of this physician, disgusted by the talk I heard on all sides, I withd rew all the recipes, and I did not replace Lossau.” 28 Looking back at the record of all the powers and abilities possessed by this great man, one point comes out clearly: either he was following some definite plan, a plan not known to the general world, or he wandered from place to place without aim, without family, without human ties ? a sorrowful life, truly, for so gifted a mortal, if this were so. But since he appeared always contented, though knowing more than those with whom he came into cantact, alway s giving, and never in need, ever helping, but never claiming aid ? surely with such evidence it becomes obvious to even the critical sceptic that some power, some plan, must have guided the footsteps and life of the Comte de St. Germain. Indeed, one of th e writers before quoted says: “Sometimes he fell into a trance, and when he again recovered, he said he had passed the time while he lay unconscious in far - off lands; sometimes he disappeared for a considerable time, then suddenly re - appeared, and let it b e understood that he had been in another world in communication with the dead. Moreover, he prided himself on being able to tame bees, and to make snakes listen to music.” 29 The author seems unaware that the ordinary Yogic of India have this power over snak es; and doubtless M. de St. Germain learned his knowledge in India. The power, also, of communicating with thedead has had more light thrown on it in this nineteenth century, thanks to those who follow in the footsteps of M. de St. Germain and who are aidi ng in the same great work. Nevertheless, although the above - quoted writer is skeptical on these points , he awards a tribute of Honest merit to our philosopher worth noticing, when writing: ? “However this may be, St. Germain was in many respects a remarkable man, and wherever he was personally known he left a favourable impression behind, and the remembera nce of many good and sometimes of many noble deeds. Many a poor father of a family, many a charitable institution, was helped by him in secret... not one bad, nor one dishonourable action was ever known of him, and so he inspired sympathy everywhere, and not least in Holland.” Thus clearly stands out the character of one who by some is called a “messenger” from   28 HESE - CASSEL, op. cit., p. 135. 29 SYPESTEYN (J. van) Historische Herinneringen."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 that spiritual Hierarchy by whom the World’s evolution is guided; such is the moral worth of the man whom the shallow critics of the earth call “adven turer.”"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 CHAPTER III THE COMING DANGER THE following extracts are translated from the very rare and valuable Souvenirs de Marie - Antoinette, by the Countess d’Adhemar, who had been an intimate friend of the Queen, and who died in 1822. I have not b een able to find a single copy of this rare work 30 in any library in England, or on the Continent, to which I have so far had access. But fortunately a copy exists at Odssa in the library of Madma Fadeef, the aunt and friend of Madmae H. P. Blavatsky, and t his may lend it an additional interest in the opinion of some of our readers. One of our members has been kindly permitted to make some extracts from the four volumes, and thanks are due to Madame Fadeef for so graciously lending the work for this purpose. Madame d’Adhemar appears to have kept a daily diary, after the fashion of the period, and to have later written her Souvenirs from this diary, occasionally interjecting an explanatory remark. They cover a long period of time, ranging from 1760 to 1821. On e very interesting fact as to dates occurs in a note written by the hand of the Countess, fastened with a pin to the original MS. and dated May 12 th 1821. She died in 1822. It refers to a prophecy made to her by St. Germain about the year 1793, when he war ned her of the approaching sad fate of the Queen, and in response to her query as to whether she would see him again, he replied, “Five times more; do not wish for the sixth.” The Countess writes: “I saw M. de St. Germain again, and always to my unspeakabl e surprise: at the assassination of the Queen; at the coming of the 18 th Brumaire; the day following the death of the Duke d’Enghien [1804]; in the month of January, 1813; and on the eve of the murder of the Duke de Berri [1820]. I await the sixth visit wh en God wills.” These dates are of interest because of the generally received opinion that St. Germain died in 1784; some few writes say he only retired from public work. These varying opinions will be treated later. Says Madame d’Adhemar 31 : — “ Since my pen is again writing the name of the Comte de St. Germain, I will say something about him. He appeared (that is the word) at the Court of France long before   30 Since this was written I have been a ble to get this work; and the present Comtesse d’Adhemar informed me that there are documents concerning the Comte de St. Germain in their family papers. Madame H. P. Blavatsky was visiting the family and stayed at the Chateau d’Adhemar in 1884. This was one of the numerous aristocratic families which were ruined in the Revolution. The present Comtesse d’Adhemar is an American; the documents are in America. 31 ADHEMAR, op. cit., vol. ? , p. 294"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30 me. It was in 1743; the rumour spead that a stranger, enormously rich to judge by the magnificence of his jewellery, had just arrived at Versailles. Whence did he come? That is what no one has ever been able to learn. His countenance, haughty, intellectual, acute, struck one at first sight. He had a pliant, graceful figure, delicate hands, a small foot, an elegant leg which set off a well - fitting silk stocking. The small - clothes, very tight, also suggested a rare perfection of form; his smile showed the most beautiful teeth in the world, a pretty dimple adorned his chin, his hair was black, his eyes were so ft and penetrating. Oh! what eyes! I have nowhere seen their equal. He appeared about forty to forty - five years old. He was met again in the smaller apartments where he had free admission, at the beginning of 1768. He did not see Madame du Barry, but he wa s present at the catastrophe of Madame de Chateauroux. “ When this lady died, the King who had only known the Count for a year, had nevertheless so much confidence in him that he asked him for an antidote for the dying Duchess. The Count refused, saying: ‘ It is too late.’” She continues: “ At this same period a very singular adventure befell me. I was alone in Paris, M. d’Adhemar having gone to visit some relations of his own name that he had in Languedoc. It was one Sunday at eight o’clock in the morning. I am accustomed to hear Mass at noon, so that I had to go out. I rose hurriedly, then, and had scarcely thrown on my morning wrapper when Mdlle. Rostande, my head waiting - woman in whom also I placed entire confidence, came in to tell me that a gentleman w ished to speak to me. “ To pay a visit to a woman at eight o’clock was against all accepted rules. ‘ Is it my procurator, my lawyer?’ I asked. For one has always one of these gentlemen at one’ heels, however little property one may possess. ‘ Is it my arch itect, my saddler, or one of my farmers?’ “ To each question a negative answer. “ ‘ But who is it, then, my dear?’ “ I treated my maid with familiarity. She was born the same day as myself, in the same house, that of my father, with the difference that I c ame into the world in a handsome apartment and she in the lodge of our house porter. Her father, a worthy Languedoc man, was a superannuated pensioner in our service. “ ‘ I thought,’ answered my maid, ‘ with all due respect to Madame la Comtesse, that the devil had long since made a mantle out of the skin of this personage.’ “ I passed in review all those of my acquaintance who could have deserved any special treatment by Satan, and I found so many of them that I did not know on whom to fasten my conjecture s. “ ‘ Since Madame does not guess,’ continued Mdlle. Rostande, ‘ I will take the liberty of telling her that it is the Comte de Saint - Germain!’ “ ‘ Comte de Saint - Germain!’ I exclaimed, ‘ the man of miracles.’ “ ‘ Himself.’ “ My surprise was great on find ing that he was at Paris and in my house. It was eight years least what had become of him. Heeding nothing but my curiosity. I ordered her to show him in. “ ‘ Did he tell you to announce him to me under his own name?’ “ ‘ It is M. de Saint - Noel that he cal ls himself now. No matter, I should recognize him among a thousand.’ “She went out, and a moment after the Count appeared. He looked fresh and well, and"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 almost grown younger. He paid me the same compliment, but it may be doubted whether it was as sincere a s mine. “ ‘You have lost,’ I said to him, ‘a friend, a protector in the late King.’ “ ‘I doubly regret this loss, both for myself and for France.’ “ ‘The nation is not of your opinion; it looks to the new reign for its welfare.’ “ ‘It is a mistake; this re ign will be fatal to it.’ “ ‘What are you saying?’ I replied, lowering my voice and looking around me. “ ‘The truth . . . . A gigantic conspiracy is being formed, which as yet has no visible chief, but he will appear before long. The aim is nothing less th an the overthrow of what exists, to reconstruct is on a new plan. There is ill - will towards the royal family, the clergy, the nobility, the magistracy. There is still time, however, to baffle the plot; later, this would be impossible.’ “ ‘Where have you se en all this? Is it in dreaming, or awake?’ “ ‘Partly with the help of my two ears, and partly through revelations. The King of France, I repeat, has no time to lose.’ “ ‘You must seek an audience of the Comte de Maurepas, and let him know your fears, for h e can do everything, being entirely in the confidence of the King.’ “ ‘He can do everything I know, except save France; or rather, it is he who will hasten her ruin. This man will undo you Madame.’ “ ‘You are telling me enough about it to get yourself sen t to the Bastille for the rest of your days.’ “ ‘I do not speak thus except to friend of whom I am sure.’ “ ‘Nevertheless, see M. de Maurepas; he has good intentions, though wanting in ability.’ “ ‘He would reject the evidence; besides, he detests me. Do y ou not know the silly quatrain which caused his exile? ‘Beautiful Marquise, they praise your charms. Lovely are you and very frank; But all that does not prevent Your flowers being flowers.’ “ ‘The rhyme is inaccurate, Count.’ “ ‘Oh! the Marquise paid little attention to it; but she knew that M. de Maurepas was the author of it, and he pretended that I had taken away the original manuscript from him to send it to the haughty Sultana. His exile followed the publication of these wretched verses, and from that time he included me in his schemes of vengeance. He will never forgive me. Nevertheless, Madame la Comtesse, this is what I propose to you. Speak of me to the Queen, of the services that I have rendered to the government in the missions that have been entrusted to me at the various courts of Europe. If her Majesty will listen to me, I will reveal to her what I know; then she will judge whether it will be well for me to enter into the King’s presence; without the intervention, however, of M. de Mau repas — that is my sine qua non .’ “ I listened attentively to M. de Saint - Germain, and I understood all the dangers that would again fall on my head, if I interfered in such an affair. On the other hand, I knew the Count to be perfectly conversant with Europ ean politics, and I feared to lose the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 32 opportunity of serving the State and the King. The Comte de Saint - Germain, guessing my perplexity, said to me : — “ ‘Think over my proposal; I am in Paris incogito ; do not speak of me to anyone; and if to - morrow you w ill come to meet me in the church of the Jacobins in the Rue Saint - Honore, I will await your answer there at eleven o’clock precisely.’ “ ‘I would rather see you in my own house.’ “ ‘Willingly; to - morrow, then, Madame.’ “ He departed/ I pondered all day on this apparition, as it were, and on the menacing words of the Comte de Saint - Germain. What! we were on the eve of social disorganization; this reign, which was ushered in under such happy auspices, was brewing the tempest! After long meditation on this te xt, I determined to present M. de Saint - Germain to the Queen, if she consented to it. He was punctual to the appointment, and delighted at the resolution that I had made. I asked him if he was going to settle in Paris; he answered in the negative, his plan s on longer permitting him to live in France. “ ‘A century will pass,’ he said, ‘before I shall re - appear there.’ “ I burst out laughing, and he did the same. That very day I went to Versailles; I passed through the small apartments, and finding Madame de Misery there, I begged her to let the Queen know that I wished to see her as soon as she could receive me. The head chamber - woman returned with the command to conduct me in. I entered; the Queen was sitting in front of a charming porcelain writing - table, w hich the King had given her; she was writing, and turning her head she said to me with one of here gracious smiles : — “ ‘What do you want with me?’ “ ‘A trifle, Madame; I merely aspire to save the monarchy.’ “ Her Majesty looked at me with amazement. “ ‘Ex plain yourself.’ “ At this command I mentioned the Comte de Saint - Germain; I told all that I knew of him, of his intimacy with the late King, Madame de Pompadour, the Duke de Choiseul; I spoke of the real services that he had rendered to the State by his d iplomatic ability; I added that since the death of the Marquise he had disappeared from retirement. When I had sufficiently piqued the Queen’s curiosity, I ended by repeating to her what the Count had said to me the previous day, and had confirmed that mor ning. “ The Queen appeared to reflect; then she replied. “ ‘ It is strange; yesterday I received a letter from my mysterious correspondent; he warned me that an important communication would shortly be made to me, and that I must take into serious consider ation, on pain of the greatest misfortunes. The coincidence of these two things is remarkable, unless, however, they come from the same source; what do you think about it?’ “ ‘I scarcely know what to say of it. Here has the Queen been receiving these myste rious communications for several years, and the Comte de Saint - Germain re - appeared only yesterday.’ “ ‘Perhaps he acts in this way in order the better to conceal himself.’ “ ‘That is possible; nevertheless, something tells me that one ought to put faith in his words.’ “ ‘After all, one is not sorry to see him, were it only in passing. I authorise you, then, to bring him to - morrow to Versailles, disguised in your livery. He shall remain in your apartments, and as soon as it is possible for me to admit him, I will have you both"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33 summoned. I will not listen to him except in your presence; that, too, is my sine qua non .’ “ I bowed profoundly, and the Queen dismissed me with the usual signal. I own, however, that my confidence in the Comte de Saint - Germain was les sened by the coincidence of his coming to Paris with the warning received the day before by Marie - Antoinette. I fancied I saw in it a regular scheme of trickery, and I asked myself if I ought to speak to him about it; but, considering all, I resolved to be silent, certain that he was prepared beforehand to answer this question. “ M. de Saint - Germain was awaiting me outside. As soon as I perceived him, I stopped my carriage; he got into it with me, and we returned together to my house. He was present at my d inner, but according to his custom he did not eat; after this he proposed to go back to Versailles. He would sleep at the inn, he added, and rejoin me the next day. I consented to this, eager as I was to neglect nothing for the success of this business. “ We were in my dwelling, then, in quarters which at Versailles were called a suite of apartments, when one of the Queen’s pages came to ask me on her Majesty’s behalf for the second volume of the book that she had desired me to bring her from Paris. This wa s the signal agreed upon. I handed the page a volume of some new novel, I know not what, and as soon as he had gone, I followed, accompanied by my lackey. “ We entered through the cabinets ; Madame de Misery conducted us into the private room where the Quee n was awaiting us. She rose with affable dignity. “ ‘Monsieur le Comte,’ she said to him, ‘Versailles is a place which is familiar to you.’ “ ‘Madame, for nearly twenty years I was on intimate terms with the late King; he deigned to listen to me with kindn ess; he made use of my poor abilities on several occasions, and I do not think that he regretted having given me his confidence.’ “ ‘You have wished Madame d’Adhemar to bring you to me; I have great affection for her and I do not doubt that what you have t o tell me deserves listening to.’ “ ‘The Queen,’ answered the Count in a solemn voice, ‘will in her wisdom weigh what I am about to confide to her. The Encyclopadist party desire power; they will only obtain it by the absolute downfall of the clergy, and t o ensure this result they will overthrow the monarchy. This party, who seek a chief among the members of the royal family, have turned their eyes on the Duc de Chartres; this prince will become the tool of men who will sacrifice him when he has ceased to b e useful to them; the crown of France will be offered him, and he will find the scaffold instead of the throne. But before this day of retribution, what cruelties! What crimes! Laws will no longer be the protection of the good and the terror of the wicked. It is these last who will seize power with their blood - stained hands; they will abolish the Catholic religion, the nobility, the magistracy.’ “ ‘So that nothing but royalty will be left!’ interrupted the Queen, impatiently. “ ‘Not even royalty! . . . but a greedy republic, whose scepter will be the axe of the executioner.’ “ At these words I could not contain myself, and taking upon me to interrupt the Count in the Queen’s presence: “ ‘Monsieur!’ I cried, ‘do you think of what you are saying, and before wh om you are speaking?’ “ ‘In truth,’ added Marie - Antoinette, a little agitated, ‘these are things that my ears are not accustomed to hear.’"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 34 “ ‘And it is in the gravity of the circumstances that I find this boldness,’ coolly replied M. de Saint - Germain. ‘I h ave not come with the intention of paying a homage to the Queen of which she must be weary, but indeed to point out to here the dangers which threaten here crown, if prompt measures are not taken to avert them.’ “ ‘You are positive, Monsieur,’ said Marie - A ntoinette, petulantly. “ ‘I am deeply grieved to displease your Majesty, but I can only speak the truth.’ “ ‘ Monsieur,’ replied the Queen, affecting a playful tone, ‘ the true, perhaps, may sometimes not be the probable.’ “ ‘I admit, Madame, that this is a case in point; but your Majesty will permit me in my turn to remind you that Cassandra foretold the ruin of Troy, and that they refused to believe it. I am Cassandra, France is the kingdom of Priam. Some years yet will pass by a deceitful calm; then from all parts of the kingdom will spring up men greedy for vengeance, for power, and for money; they will overthrow all in their way. The seditious populace and some great members of the State will lend them support; a spirit of delirium will take possession of the citizens; civil war will burst out with all ist horrors; it will bring in its train murder, pillage, exile. Then it will be regretted that I was not listened to; perhaps I shall be asked for again. Bu the time will be past . . . the storm will have swept all before it.’ “ ‘I confess, Monsieur, that this discourse astonishes me more and more, and did I not know that the late King had an affection for you, and that you had served him faithfully . . . . You wish to speak to the King?’ “ ‘Yes, Madame.’ “ ‘But without the concurrence of M. de Maurepas?’ “ ‘He is my enemy; besides, I rank him among those who will further the ruin of the kingdom, not from malice, but from incapacity.’ “ ‘You are a severe judge of a man who has the approbation of the majority .’ “ ‘He is more than Prime Minister, Madame, and by right of this he is sure to have flatterers.’ “ ‘If you exclude him from your relations with the King, I fear that you will find it difficult to approach his Majesty, who cannot act without his chief adv iser.’ “ ‘I shall be at their Majesties’ command as long as they subject, all obedience on my part is a gratuitous act.’ “ ‘Monsieur,’ said the Queen, who at this period could not treat any matter seriously for long together, ‘where were you born?’ “ ‘At J erusalem, Madame.’ “ ‘And that was . . . when?’ “ ‘The Queen will permit me to have a weakness common to many persons. I never like to tell my age; that brings misfortune.’ “ ‘As for me, the Royal Almanac does not allow of any illusion about my own. Farewe ll, Monsieur; the pleasure of the King shall be communicated to you.’ “ This was a dismissal; we retired, and in returning home with me M. de Saint - Germain said to me : — “ ‘I too am about to leave you, Madame, and for a long time, for I do not propose to r emain more than four days in France.’ “ ‘What is it that makes you decide to start so quickly?’ “ ‘The Queen will repeat to the King what I have said to her, Louis XV. will draw up"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 a warrant ( letter de cachet ) against me, and the head of the police will ha ve orders to put it into execution. I know how there things are done, and I have no desire to go to the Bastille.’ “ ‘What would it matter to you? You would get out through the key - hole.’ “ ‘I prefer not to need recourse to a miracle. Farewell, Madame.’ “ ‘But if the King should summon you?’ “ ‘I will return.’ “ ‘How shall you know it?’ “ ‘I have the means of doing so: do not trouble yourself on that point.’ “ ‘Meanwhile, I shall be compromised!’ “ ‘Not so; farewell.’ “ He departed, as soon as he had taken off my livery. I remained greatly troubled. I had told the Queen that in order to be the better able to carry out her wishes, I would not leave he chateau. . . . Two hours after, Madame de Misery came to seek me on behalf of her Majesty. I augured no good from this eagerness. I found the King with Marie - Antoinette. She appeared to me embarrassed; Louis XV., on the contrary, came up to me in a frank way, and took my hand, which he kissed with infinite grace, for he had charming manners when he pleased. “ ‘Ma dame d’Adhemar,’ he said to me, ‘what have you done with your wizard?’ “ ‘The Comte de Saint - Germain, Sire? He has started for Paris.’ “ ‘He has seriously alarmed the Queen. Had he previously spoken in the same way to you?” “ ‘Not with so many details.’ “ ‘I bear no ill - will to you for it, nor does the Queen either, for your intentions are good; but I blame the stranger for daring to foretell reverses to us which all the four quarters of the globe could not offer in the course of a century. Above all, he is wrong in concealing himself from the Comte de Maurepas, who would know how to lay aside his personal enmities if it were necessary to sacrifice them to the interests of the monarchy. I shall speak to him on the subject, and if he advises me to see Saint - G ermain, I shall not refuse to do so. He is credited with intellect and ability; my grandfather liked his society; but before granting him a conference, I wished to reassure you as to the possible consequences of the fresh appearance of this mysterious pers onage. Whatever may happen, you will be held clear.’ “ ‘My eyes filled with tears at this striking proof of the kindness of their Majesties, for the Queen spoken to me as affectionately as did the King. I returned calmer, but vexed, nevertheless, at the tu rn that this affair had taken, and I inwardly congratulated myself that M de Saint - Germain had foreseen all. “ Two hours later, I was still in my room, absorbed in my own thoughts, when there was a knock at the door of my modest dwelling. I heard an unusua l commotion, and almost immediately the two folding doors opened, and Monseigner4u le Comet de Maurepas was announced.i rose to receive him with rather more briskness than if it had been the King of France. He came forward with a smiling countenance. “ ‘Pa rdon me, Madame,’ he said, ‘for the unceremoniousness of you, and politeness required that I should come to seek you.’ “ The courtiers of this period showed an exquisite politeness to women, which was no longer to be found in its purity after the storm whi ch overturned everything. I replied, as I"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 was bound to do, to M. de Maurepas, and these preliminaries over : — “ ‘Well!’ he resumed, ‘our old friend the Comte de Saint - Germain has returned? . . . He is already at his old tricks, and has recommenced his jugg lery.’ “ I was about to exclaim; but stopping me with a gesture of entreaty : — “ ‘Believe me,’ he added, ‘I know the rogue better than you do, Madame. One thing only surprise me; the years have not spared me, and the Queen declares that the Comte de Saint - Germain presented the appearance of a man of forty. However that may be, we must know whence he has gained this information, so circumstantial, so alarming. . . . He did not give you his address, I will warrant?’ “ ‘No, Monsieur le Comte.’ “ ‘It will be di scovered, our police hounds have a keen scent. . . . Further . . . the King thanks you for your zeal. Nothing grievous will befall Saint - Germain, except the being shut up in the Bastille, where he will be well fed, well warmed, until he condescends to tell us where he has got at so many curious things.’ “ At this moment our attention was diverted by the noise made by the opening of the door of my room. . . . It was the Comte de Sanit - Germain who entered! A cry escaped me, while M. de Maurepas hurriedly rose , and I must say that his countenance changed a little. The thaumaturgist, approaching him, said : — “ ‘M. le Comte de Maurepas, the King summoned you to give him good advice, and you think only of maintaining your own authority. In opposing yourself to my seeing the Monarch, you are losing the monarchy, for I have but a limited time to give to France and, this time over, I shall not be seen here again until after three consecutive generations have gone down to the grave. I told the Queen all that I was perm itted to tell her; my revelations to the King would have been more complete; it is unfortunate that you should have intervened between His Majesty and me. I shall have nothing to reproach myself with when horrible anarchy devastates all France. As to these calamities, you will not see them, but to have prepared them will be sufficient memorial of you. . . . Expect no homage from posterity, frivolous and incapable Minister! You will be ranked among those who cause the ruin of empires.’ “ M. de Saint - Germain, having spoken thus without taking breath, turned towards the door again, shut it, and disappeared” 1 * * * All efforts to find the Count failed!    1 ADHEMAR, op.cit., ? ., pp. 52 - 72"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37  CHAPTER IV TRAGICAL PROPHECIES The most deeply interesting of all the incidents re corded in this diary of Madame d’Adhemar are those which show how M. de St. - Germain strove to warn the Royal Family of the evils which were overshadowing it. He had evidently watched over the unfortunate young Queen from the time of her entry into France. He was the “mysterious adviser” of whom mention is frequently made. He it was who strove to make the King and Queen understand that M. de Maurepas and their other advisers were wrecking their kingdom. The friend of Royalty, he was yet the one most accus ed by the Abbe Barruel of leading the Revolution. “Time proves all,” and time has allowed the accuser to sink into a well - deserved oblivion, while the accused stands out as true friend and true prophet. Let the voice of the dead woman bear its own witness: -- “The future was darkening; we were nearing the terrible catastrophe which was about to overwhelm France. The abyss was at our feet; yet averting our heads, struck with a fatal blindness, we hurried from fete to fete , from pleasure to pleasure. It wa s like a kind of frenzy which thrust us gaily on to our destruction. Alas! How can a storm be controlled when one sees it not? “Meanwhile, from time to time, some troubled or observant minds tried to snatch us from this fatal security. I have already sa id that the Comte de St. - Germain had tried to unseal the eyes of Their Majesties, by making them perceive the approach of danger; but M. de Maurepas, not wishing the salvation of the country to come from any one but himself, ousted the thaumaturgist, and h e re - appeared no more.” 1 The date at which these events were taking place was 1788; the final crash, however, did not culminate until 1793. Madame d’Adhemar is reviewing events and does not in every case put the exact date. The attacks upon the King and Throne were increasing in violence and bitterness year by year, owing to the fatal blindness already alluded to by our writer. The frivolity of the Court increased pari passu with the hatred of its enemies. The unfortunate Queen, indeed, did make efforts to understand the condition of affairs, but in vain. Madame d’Adhemar gives some of the details as follows:   1 ADHEMAR, op. cit., iv .,i."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 38 “I cannot refrain from copying here, in order to give an idea of these sad debates [in the National Assembly], a letter written by M. de Sailler, parliamentary adviser to the Chambres de Requetes, and addressed to one of his friends, a member of the parliament at Toulouse ... This account was spread abroad and read with avidity; many copies of it were circulated in Paris. Before the original reached Toulouse, it was spoken of in the drawing - room of the duchesse de Polignac. “The Queen, turning to me, asked me if I had read it, and requested me to procure it for her. This request caused me real embarrassment; I wished to obey Her Majesty, and at the same time I feared to displease the ruling Minister; however my attachment to the Queen prevailed. “Marie - Antoinette read the article in my presence, and then singing, ‘Ah! Madame d’Adhemar,’ she said, ‘how painful all these attacks on the authority of the king are to me! We are walking on dangerous ground; I begin to believe that your Comte de St. - Germain was right. We were wtong not to listen to him, but M. de Maurepas imposed a skillful and despotic dictatorship upon us. To what are we coming? 2 “... The queen set for me, and I hastened to her sacred order. She held a letter in her hand. ‘Madame d’Adhemar,’ she said, ‘here is another missive from my unknown. Have you not heard people talking again of the Comte de St. - Germain?’ “ ‘No,’ I replied; ‘I have not seen him, and nothing has reached me from him.’ “ ‘This time,’ added the Queen, ‘the oracle has used the language which becomes him, the epistle is in verse; it may be bad, but it is not very cheering. You shall read it at your leisure, for I have promised an audience to the Abbe de Ballivieres. I wish that my friends could live on good terms!’ “ ‘Especially,’ I ventured to add, ‘as their enemies triumph in their quarrels.’ “ ‘The unknown says the same as you do; but who is wrong or right ?’ “ ‘The Queen may satisfy both parties by means of the first two vacant Bishoprics.’ “ ‘You are mistaken; the King will give the Episcopal mitre neither to the Abbe d’Erse not to the Abbe de Ballivieres. The protectors of these ill - will is on my si de; you might, since you are compared to the heroes of Ariosto (the speech of the Baroness de Stael had occurred to the Queen), play the part of peace - maker of the good King Sobrir; behold the Countess Diana, make her listen to reason. “ ‘I will talk re ason to her,’ said I, trying to laugh in order to dispel the melancholy of the Queen. “ ‘Diana is a spoilt child,’ replied Her Majesty, ‘however, she loves her friends.’ “ ‘Yes, Madame, even to showing herself implacable to their enemies! I will obey the Queen.’ “ ‘They came to inform Marie - Antoinette that the Abbe de Ballivieres had arrived according to her command. I passed into the small closet, where having asked Madame Campan for pen, ink, and paper, I copied the following passage, obscure the n, but which afterwards became only too clear. “ ‘The time is fast approaching when imprudent France, Surrounded by misfortune she might have spared herself, Will call to mind such bell as Dante painted.   2 ADHEMAR, op. cit., iv ., p.63"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 39 This day, O Queen!

And more than one usurper triumphs in command, More than one heart misled is humbled and repents. At last, closing the abyss and born from a black tomb There rises a young lily, more happy, and more fair.’ “These prophetic verses, written by a pen we already knew, astonished me. I racked my brains to guess their meaning; for how could I b elieve that it was their simplest meaning that I ought to give them! How imagine, for instance, that it was the King and Queen who would die a violent death, and as the result of iniquitous sentences? We could not, in 1788, have such clear sight; it was an impossibility. “When I returned to the Queen, and no indiscreet person could listen, she said: -- “ ‘What do you make of these threatening verses?’ “ ‘They are dismaying! But they cannot affect your Majesty. People do say incredible things, follies; if, h owever, the prophetic words turn out to be true, they will concern our posterity.’ “ ‘Pray heaven you speak truly, Madame d’Adhemar,’ replied the Queen; ‘however, these are strange experiences. Who is this personage who has taken an interest in me for so m any years without making himself known, without seeking any reward, and who yet has always told me the truth? He now warns me of the overthrow of everything that exists and, if he gives a gleam of home, it is so distant that I may not reach it.’ “I strove to comfort the Queen; above all, I told her, she must make her friends live on good terms with each other, and not let their private quarrels be known outside.

I am the center of a crowd of intrigues, which I ha ve difficulty in avoiding. Everyone complains of my ingratitude. This is not the role of a Queen of France. There is a very fine verse which I apply to myself, making a change in the reading: “Kings are condemned to magnificence.” I should say with more re ason: “Kings are condemned to be weary in utter loneliness.” “ ‘So I should act were I to begin my career again.’ ” 1 Madame d’Adhemar does not give any very definite dated in her diary, and it is chiefly by the historical episodes, which led up to the fin al crash, that we are able to mark the passage of time. Passing on from the general events, deeply interesting in themselves, but not bearing on the Comte de St. Germain, we come to the proscription which was passed against the Royalties in 1789, and once more the unfortunate Queen received a warning from her unknown adviser, whose advice alas! Fell on ears too weak to understand. Hearing of the proceedings against the Polignacs, Marie - Antoinette sent to warn the Duchess about her approaching fall. Madame d ’Adhemar graphically tells the tale as follows: -- “I areose, and showing the pain that this commission gave me, I went off to Madame de Polignac. I could have wished to find her alone. I met there the Duke, her husband, her sister - in - law, the Count de Vau dreuil and M. l’Abbe de Ballivieres. On seeing my solemn look when I entered, my swollen eyes still wet with the tears that had mingled with those of the Queen, they felt that I had come for a sad reason; the Duchess held out her hand to me. “ ‘What have y ou to tell me?’ she said; ‘I am prepared for every misfortune.’ “ ‘Not,’ said I, ‘for that which is about to burst upon you. Alas! My sweet friend, bear it with resignation and courage ...’ “ ‘These words died away on my lips, and the Countess, taking up the words, said: -- “ ‘You are causing my sister a thousand sufferings by your reticence. Well, Madame, what is the matter?’ “ ‘The Queen,’ I said, ‘in order to avoid the proscription that threatens you — you and yours — wishes you to go for some months to Vienna .’ “ ‘The Queen drives me away, and you come all to tell me!’ cried the Duchess, rising. “ ‘Unjust friend!’ I answered, ‘let me tell you all that remains to be told.’ “ ‘Then I went on and repeated word for word what Marie - Antoinette had charged me to tell her. “There were more cries, more tears, more despairings; I did not know to whom to listen; M. de Vaudreuil showed no more firmness than the Polignacs.’ “ ‘Alas!’ said the Duchess, ‘it is my duty to obey, I will certainly depart, since the Queen wills it ; but will she not permit me to repeat verbally my gratitude for her innumerable kindnesses?’ “ ‘Never,’ said I, ‘did she think of your going before she had consoled you; go then to her chamber, her reception will make amends to you for this apparent disfa vor.’ “ ‘The Duchess begged me to accompany her, and I consented. My heart was broken at the sad interview between these friends who loved each other so warmly. It was a flood of complaints, tears, sighs; they embraced each other so closely that they could not tear themselves apart; it was truly pitiful to see.   1 ADHEMAR, op. cit., iv ., pp.74 - 97.

Her Majesty then proceeded to say: “ ‘From the time of my arrival in France, and in which my interests have been concerned, a mysterious protector has disclosed what I had to fear; I have told you something of it, and to - day I doubt not that he is advising me what to do.’ “ ‘Here, Madame d’Adhemar,’ she said to me, ‘read this letter; your eyes are less tired than Madame de Polignac’s and mine.’ “Alas! the Queen referred to the tears that she never ceased to shed. I took the paper and having opened the envelope I read w hat follows. “ ‘Madame — I have been a Cassandra; my words have fallen on your ears in vain, and you have reached the period of which I informed you. It is no longer a question of tacking but of meeting the storm with thundering energy; in order to do this a nd to increase your strength, you must separate yourself from the persons whom you most love so as to remove all pretext from the rebels. Moreover these persons run the risk of their lives; all the Polignacs and their friends are doomed to death and are po inted out to the assassins who have just murdered the officers of the Bastille and the provost of the merchants. The Comte d’Artois will perish; they thirst for his blood; let him take heed to it. I hasten to tell you this, later on I will communicate furt her with you about it.’ “We were in the stupor which such a menace inevitably causes, when the Comte d’Artois was announced. We all started, and he himself was astounded. He was questioned, and, unable to keep silence, he told us that the Duc de Liancourt had just told him as well as the King, that the men of the Revolution, in order to consolidate it, had made up their minds to take his life (that of the Comte d’Artois), and that of the Duchesse de Polignac, and of the Duc, and also the lives of Messieurs de Vaudreuil, de Vermont, de Guiche, of the Ducs de Broglie, de la Vauguyon, de Castries, the Baron de Breteuil, Messieurs de Villedeuil, d’Amecourt, des Polastrons — in a word a real proscription. . . . 1 “On returning home, a note was given to me, thus wor ded: — “ ‘All is lost, Countess!

Why had he come to France? Was he then never to have done with life?

I found myself in this condition under present circumstances; besides, the immediate danger of the Queen p re - occupied me.

I am lost in astonishment’.” 1 These are the la st words that the Countess d’Adhemar writes in connection with the Comte de St. Germain or that friend who had tried so vainly to save them from the storm which was then raging on all sides. One important note which has been already noticed may, however, h ere again be fitly quoted. It is evidently from the pen of the biographer that we get this important little memo, which is as follows: “Note written by the hand of the Countess, fastened with a pin to the original MS. and dated the 12 th May, 1821. She died in 1822. “ I saw M. de St. Germain again, and always to my unspeakable surprise: at the assassination of the Queen; at the coming of the 18 th Brumaire; the day following the death of the Duc d’Enghien; in the month of January, 1813; and on the eve of the murder of the Duc de Berri. I await the sixth visit when God wills.’” Thus does a voice from the dead contradict the malicious diatribes made against this teacher, and also refute the unfounded assertions about his death in 1784, made by Dr. Biester of Ber lin, which have been already fully noted. Perhaps the most interesting passages are those which give the utterances of the Comte de St. Germain with regard to the future of France. It is now a hundred and thirty years since those words were uttered, and we can see that they have been accurately correct in every detail. The Bourbons are now but a private family. The honour of France has been wrecked by those who had arrogated to themselves positions of honour and trust, in which their moral characters were n ot able to stand the strain; cases may be cited as instances illustrating, but too clearly, the truth of the sorrowful forecast made by the Mystic Messenger of the last century. He might have fitly quoted the words of the Prophet forerunner, “ I am the voi ce of one crying in the wildnerness.” 1 But, alas for France, neither prophecies nor warnings availed her; slowly and sadly has the wheel of her life turned round, proving the veracity and accuracy of that prophet who was sent to warn her of the doom to com e.   1 ADHEMAR, op. cit.,iv .,pp.254 - 261. 1 Isaiah, xl .3."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46 CHAPTER V POLITICAL WORK THE earliest definite hint of any political work on the part of the Comte de St. Germain is from the pen of Madame d’Adhemar. 33 When sketching the portraits of those who were received into intimacy by Louis XV .at Ve rsailles, she says: “ The King was also much attached to the Duchesse de Choiseul, nee Crozat; her simplicity, her frankness, more virtues than were necessary to make a success at Versailles, had triumphed over the drawback of her birth, and she was freque ntly present at the suppers in the smaller apartments. One man also had long enjoyed this favour, the celebrated and mysterious Comte de St. Germain, my friend who has not bee rightly known, and to whom I shall devote some pages when I have to speak of Cag liostro. From 1749, the King employed him on diplomatic missions and he acquitted himself honourably in them.” This passage would remain incomprehensible, unless we glance briefly at the history of the period. Dark and stormy is the scene on which we enter ; difficult indeed is it to disentangle the knotted web of European politics which enmeshed the various nations. Austria and France had signed in 1756 an offensive and defensive alliance, especially directed against England and Prussia; Russia was with the m; during the Seven Years’ War the throne of Prussia tottered more than once, until the Austrians were defeated at Torgau in 1760. Poland, that “ Niobe of Nations,” was watching the clouds gather slowly on her horizon; racked within by strife stirred up by Russia, she struggled vainly against the stronger Powers; her day was slowly ending. England, at war in America and with France, striving also to conquer India, was also a center of discord. All Europe was in dissension. Into this arena of combat the Comt e de St. Germain was asked to step by the King of France, in order to make that peace which his Ministers — involved in their own plans — could not, or would not, make. Louis XV.was practically the originator of the whole system of secret diplomacy, which in t he eighteen century seems to stand out as a new departure in the diplomatic political world. The Gordian knot which could not be disentangled, Louis XV tried to cut; hence we find the King of France employing secret agents, men who could be trusted with de licate missions, men foredoomed to bear the blame of failure, fated never to be crowned with the palm of success. Outside the various Foreign Offices, or beyond the pale of their secret archives, it is very little known that the Comte de St. Germain had an y diplomatic mission whatsoever.   33 Souvenirs sur Marie - Antoinette, ? ., p. 8"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 47 In many histories and memoirs there it is necessary to cite such writers as are available to bear their testimony on this point. Not least amongst these stands Voltaire, the sceptic, who in his voluminous correspondence wit h Frederick of Prussia says, April 15 th , 1758: “ Your ministers are doubtless likely to have a better outlook at Breda than I; M. le Duc de Choiseul, M. de Kaunitz, and M. Pitt do not tell me their secret. It is said to be only known be a M. de St. Germain , who supped formerly at trent with the Council Fathers, and who will probably have the honour of seeing your Majesty in the course of fifty years. He is a man who never dies, and who knows everthing.” 34 The allusion “supped at Trent” is a reference to the gossip which originated from Lord Gower’s impersonation and misrepresentation of M. de St. Germain, of which mention has already been made. The important point in this letter is that Voltaire refers to a political connection of M. de St. Germain with the P rime Ministers of England, France and Austria, as if he were in the intimate council of these leaders. The Baron de Gleichen gives some details in his memoirs, and as he became later deeply interested in the mystical work of the Comte de St. Germain, his v ersion is of much value, giving as it does an insight into some of the complications in France. He writes: “The Marshal [de Belle - Isle] was incessantly intriguing to get a special treaty of peace made with Prussia, and to break up the alliance between Fran ce and Austria, on which rested the credit of the Duc de Choiseul. Louis XV .and Madame de Pompadour wished for this special treaty of peace. . . . The Marshal drew up the instructions; the King delivered them himself with a cipher to M. de St. Germain.” 1 T hus, then, is the mission duly signed and sealed by the King himself, but, as we shall see, even the royal protection could not avert the suspicion and incurred, and when M de St. Germain arrived at the Hague he came into collision with M. d’Affry, 2 the ac credited Ambassador from France. Before entering on the ambassadorial dispatches there are a few words from Herr Barthold to be noticed, giving an interesting account of this diplomatic mission; he — after criticising somewhat severely, and with good reason, the unreliable statements about our philosopher made by the Marquise de Crequi and the Markgrafin von Anspach — goes on: “But of this mysterious mission of the Adept, as financier to the crown and diplomatic Agent, to which he was initiated, not at the mini sterial desk, but in the laboratory of Chambord, she makes no mention. Nor has this point — so essential to the understanding of the way business was conducted in France, both in Cabinet and State, at this period — ever been much commented on. About this time we find St. Germain at the Hague, evidently on a private mission, where the Comte d’Affry was French Ambassador, but the two had no relations with each other. Voltaire, who is generally a good Secret Treaty of Peach.” 3 The date mentioned by this author is not quite accurate, as we shall see. That the Duc de Choiseul was profoundly annoyed when this information reached him, is to be understood; his pet schemes were in jeopardy, his intrigues against England   34 VOLTAIRE, Ceuves.

M. de Ch oiseul immediately sent back the courier, ordering M. d’Affry to make a peremptory demand to the States - General to deliver up M. de St. Germain and, that being done, to send him bound hand and foot to the Bastille. The next day M. de Choiseul produced in C ouncil the dispatch of M. d’Affry; he then read his own reply; then, casting his eyes haughtily on his colleagues, and fixing them alternatively round on King and on M. de Belle - Isle, he added: ‘If I did not give myself time to take the orders of the King, it is because I am convinced that on one here would be bold enough to desire to negotiate a Treaty of Peace without the knowledge of Your Majesty’ s Minister for Foreign Affairs!’ He knew that this Prince had established, and always maintained, the princi ple, that the Minister of one department should not meddle with the affairs of another. It turned out as he had foreseen. The King cast down his eyes like a guilty person, the Marshal dared not say a word, and M. de Choiseul’s action was approved; but M. d e St. Germain escaped him. Their Highnesses, having made good their assent, dispatched a large body of guards to arrest M. de St. Germain, who, having been privately warned, fled to England. I have some grounds for believing that he soon left it again to g o to St. Petersburg.” 1 No better account could be given than this, by one present at the French Cabinet Council, of the way in which Louis XV., weak and irresolute, allowed his arrangements to be cancelled without a word. Passing, however, rapidly on to fo llow the events at the Hague, we next have some interesting dispatches from M. de Kauderbach, Minister from the Saxon Court at the Hague, wherein he recounts much that has already been given in these pages in praise of the Comte de St. Germain, of his powe rs and knowledge and then goes on to say: “ I had a long conversation with him on the causes of the troubles of France, and on the changes in the choice of Minister in this kingdom. This, Monseigneur, is what he said to me on the subject: ‘The radical evil is the monarch’s want of firmness. Those who surround him, knowing his extreme good nature, abuse it, and he is surrounded only by creatures placed by the Brothers Paris, 2 who alone cause all the trouble of France. It is they who corrupt everything, and t hwarted the plans of the best citizen in France, the Marshal de Belle - Isle. Hence the disunion and jealousy amongst the Ministers, who seem all to serve a different monarch. All is corrupted by the Brothers Paris; perish France, provided they may attain th eir object of gaining eight hundred millions! Unhappily the King has not so much sagacity as good nature; he is not, therefore, aware of the malice of the people around him who, knowing his lack of firmness, are solely occupied in flattering his foible, an d through it are ever preferably listened to. The same defect as to firmness is found in the mistress. She knows the evil and has not courage to remedy it.’ It is he then, M. de St. Germain, who will undertake to cure it radically; he takes upon himself to put down by his influence and operations in Holland the two names so prejudicial to the State, which have hitherto been regarded as indispensable necessary. Hearing him speak with so much freedom, one must look upon him either as a man sure of his ground, or else as the greatest fool in the world. I could entertain your Excellency much longer with this singular man and with his knowledge of   1 GLEICHEN (C. H.

I have this moment heard that the courier whom the Comte d’Affry received last Monday brought him an order to demand from the State the arrest and extradition of the famous St. Germain as a dangerous character, and one with whom his most Christian Majesty has reason to be dissatisfied. M. d’Affry, having communicated this order to the Pensionnaire, this Minister of State reported it to the Council o f Deputy Commissioners for the province of Holland, an assembly of which the Comte de Bentinck is President. The latter gave the man warning, and made him start for England. The day before his departure, St. Germain was four hours with the English Minister . He boasted of being authorized to make peace.” Later on, in another dispatch, this wary diplomatist returns once more to the attack. “The adventure gave himself here the airs of a secret negotiator, selected by the Marshal de Belle - Isle, from whom he sho wed letters in which there were in fact some traces of confidence. He wished it to be understood that the principles of the Marshal, differing from those of M. de Choiseul, and more in accordance with the inclination of Mme. De Pompadour, were warmly in fa vour of peace; he darkened the picture, painting in the strongest colours the cabals, the difficulties and the dissension that he declared reigned in France, and by these flatteries he thought to gain the confidence of the English party. On the other hand he had written to the Marshal de Belle - Isle, that M. d’Affry knew not how to appreciate or carry out the plans of the Comte de Bentinck - Rhoon, who was a man of the best intentions in the world, and desired only to make himself useful to France in order to promoter the success of her negotiations with England. These letters were sent back to M. d’Affry, with any transactions, on pain of expiating his rashness for the rest of his days in a dungeon on his return to France.” 1 Truly ludicrous is the difference i n the tone of these documents; M. de St. Germain was endeavouring to carry out the wishes of the King, and trying to help an exhausted country; these effort for peace were frustrated by de Choiseul, who had his own schemes to forward with Austria. Nothing more natural could have occurred than that the new helper should be attacked by the opposite party. It is evident, from the paper cited, that M. de St. Germain was in the confidence of the Marshal de Belle - Isle — who also wanted peace — for the Saxon Ambassado r uses the phrase “some traces of confidence,” when speaking of the correspondence he had seen and the evidence of confidence he was forced to admit. From this distance of time we can see that the picture of France sketched by M. de St. Germain was by on m eans too dark: France impoverished, rushing wildly on to greater ruin, the end of which was to be a scene of blood and butchery. He who had the power of seeing the evil days that were drawing so steadily nigh, could he paint that picture too darkly, when e ndeavouring to   3 TAILLANDIER, SAINT - RENE, Un Prince Allemand du XUIII.

But we must take up some other threads of this tangled skein. The King of Prussia was, at this Period, in Freyberg, and his own agent, M. d’Edelsheim, had just arrived in London to confer with the English Minist ers; the following account is given later by Frederick II. Of the condition of affairs: “On his arrival in that city [London], another political phenomenon appeared there, a man whom no one has been able to understand. He was known under the name of the Co mte de St. Germain. He had been employed by France, and was even so high in favour with Louis XV., that this Prince had thought of giving him the Palace of Chambord” (De l’hiver de 1759 a 1760). 2 The mission of M. d’Edelsheim is not clearly stated, but we find that not only did M. de St. Germain have to leave London, failing to bring about the peace so sorely desired, but that the Prussian agent fared even worse; the details are given by Herr Barthold 3 : “The Prussian negotiator . . . returning from London v ia Holland to fetch his luggage from Paris, was induced to remain a few days with the Bailly de Froulay, and then, receiving a Letter de Cachet , he was put into the Bastille. Choiseul assured the prisoner that it was only y these means that he could silenc e the suspicions of the Imperial Minister, Stahremberg, but this ‘scene indecente’ was simply a trap to get hold of the Baron’s papers. Choiseul, however, found nothing and hold him to decamp, advising him on his leaving Turin not to re - enter the kingdom. Frederick takes care not to find fault with his agent, who through over - zeal had drawn discredit on himself in Paris; on the other hand, one may conclude that it was he who, through an article in the London Chronicle, succeeded in frustrating St. Germain’s project.” In this extraordinary maze of secret negotiations it is difficult to find the truth, for in the work just cited we hear that St. Germain was seen in the Bois de Boulogne in May, 1761. When the Marquise d’Urfe informed the Duc de Choiseul of his presence in Paris that Prime Mininster replied: “Je n’en suis pas surpris, puisqu’il a passé la nuit dans mon cabinet.” 1 This informant proceeds: “Casanova is therefore satisfied that de Choiseul had only pretended to be annoyed with M. de St. Germain, so as to make it easier for him to be sent to London as agent; Lord Halifax however saw through the plan.” This would indeed be one method of cutting the political entanglement of France! — an intrigue of a pronounced sort arranged by the King, apparently with out the knowledge of his chief Minister, in order to arrive at a peace for which the whole country pined. In this difficult situation the Marshal de belle - Isle selected the Comte de St. Germain as the messenger of peace. Alas! Missions of peace rarely resu lt in anything but discomfort and slander for the bearer of the message, and the history of the world recorded one more failure, a failure caused by the ambitions of the political leaders. Leaving now the condition of affairs in France and passing on to En gland, we find some very interesting correspondence between General Yorke, the English representative at the Hague, and Lord Holdernesse in London. By especial permission from the Foreign Office we have been kindly permitted to make use of these extracts. The full correspondence is to lengthy to print in the limited space permissible in these pages. The first dispatch is from General Yorke to the Earl of Holdernesse; it is dated March 14 th , 1760, and gives the full account of a long interview between the Co mte de St. Germain   2 FREDERIC II., Roi de Prusse, CEuvres Posthumes.

The former claims, he says, to have been sent by France to negotiate concerning the Peace, but says that Mons. d’Affry is not in the secret. The answer to this document comes from “Whtehall, March 21 st , 1760,” and is from Lo rd Holdernesse to General Yorke; in this he directs the latter “to tell M. de St. Germain that by the King’s orders he cannot discuss the subject with him unless he produces some authentic proof of his being employed with the consent and knowledge of the F rench King.” In the next dispatch, dated Whitehall, March 28 th , 1760, “the King directs that the same answer should be returned to Mons. d’Affry as has already been given to M. de St. Germain. The King thinks it probable that M. de St. Germain was authoriz ed to talk to General Yorke in the manner he did, and that his commission is unknown to the Duc de Choiseul.” The insight of George III. in this case is remarkable, unless in his private correspondence with Louis XV. some hint as to the real condition of t hings may have been given by one king to the other. In any case the fact remains that owing to M. de Choiseul the Treaty of Peace was not arranged; and, as we have seen, M. de St. Germain passed on from England to Russia. Turning now to some other witnesse s, we find M. Thiebault in his memoirs saying: “While this singular man was at Berlin, I ventured one day to speak of him the French envoy, the Marquis de Pons Saint - Maurice; I privately expressed to him my great surprise that this man should have held pri vate and intimate relations with persons of high rank, such as the Cardinal de Bernis, from whom he had, it was said, confidential letters, written at the time when the Cardinal held the portfolio for Foreign Affairs, etc.; on this last point the envoy mad e me no reply.” 2 This passage implies other diplomatic missions, of which no details are to be found. Another writer, who has been quoted, makes an important statement to the effect that when M. de St. Germain was in Leipzig the Graf Marcolini offered him a high public position at Dresden. Our philosopher was at Leipzig in 1776, under the name of Chevalier Weldon, and did not at all conceal the fact that he was a Prince Ragotzy. This informant says: “The Lord High Chamberlain, Graf Marcolini, came from Dres den to Leipzig and made to the Comte — in the name of the Court — certain promises; M. de St. Germain refused them, but he came in 1777 to Dresden, where he had much intercourse with the Prussian Ambassador, von Alvensleben.” 1 This statement can be corroborate d by the writer of the life of Graf Marcolini, which has been carefully compiled from the secret archives of the Saxon Court (with especial permission) by the Freitherr O’Byrn. The Graf Marcolini was a man renowned for his intefrity and upright character; his biographer says: “Considering the strong opposition shown by the Graf Marcolini to the swindling in the Schropfer affair, the sympathy he extended to the Comte de St. Germain on his arrival in Saxony is all the more wonderful.... Graf Marcolini repaired to Leipzig with the intention of interviewing St. Germain on hearing of his arrival under the name of Welldoun, October 1776...the meeting resulted in the Graf offering St. Germain an important post in Dresden if he would render a great service the State; th e ‘Wonder Man’ however refused these offers.” 2 Nowhere are to be found the details of any of these diplomatic missions; we can only gather the fragments and, piecing them together, the fact stands clearly proved, that from Court to Court, among kings, prin ces, and ambassadors, the Comte de St. Germain was   2 THIEBAULT, D., op, cit ., iv., p. 84; 3 rd ed. 1 HEZEKIEL, G., Abenteuerliche Gesellen , i., p. 46.

The details given are interesting and important links in that chain of events which brought M. de St. Germain to England. Chance, good - fortune, or some beneficent power gave the clue to these hidden records. Th e “Mitchell Papers,” in which these interesting letters have been so long concealed, have never yet been entirely published. It appears that George III. requested that these documents should not be made public during his life, and they were not be made pub lic during his life, and they were accordingly consigned to the personal care of Mr. Planta, Keeper of the British Museum. This correspondence was bought by the Trustees of the Museum from Sir William Forbes, the heir of Sir Andrew Mitchell, who had been E nvoy at Berlin during the time that all these events took place. A certain portion of the record of his diplomatic career was published by Mr. Bisset in 1850; no mention, however, was made of M. de St. Germain, and the letter which treated of him were unno ticed. There appears, curiously enough, to have been a “conspiracy of silence” amongst the diplomatists and writers of this period and later, for it is a constantly recurring experience to find all reference to our philosopher carefully excluded, even in c ases where the original sources contain much information about him. A striking instance of such omission is found by searching the different editions of works in which M. de St. Germain is mentioned; the later editions usually exclude the information given in the earlier ones. Notably may this be seen in a work 35 already referred to, by Dr. Carl von Weber, Keeper of the Saxon Archives in Dresden. In the first edition of this work there is a long article on M. de St. Germain, which is not to be found in the l ater editions of these volumes. Instances might be easily multiplied of this steady omission wherever possible. Now the Foreign Office records contain a voluminous correspondence, which is by permission at length being gathered together; this includes the letters of Prince Galitzin, who was at the period Russian Minister in England. All the correspondence is marked “secret,” and can only be seen when sanctioned. The British Museum records have no such restrictions, hence the documents which make up this pap er have been copied without delay. The first paper appears to show that Lord Holdernesse already knew of M. de St. Germain, but no facts have so far been found on this point. The language is quaint, and the style somewhat heavy, but the   35 W EBER (Dr. Carl von). Aus vier Jahrhunderten.

It must be remembered that the mission undertaken by the Comte de St. Germain was a secret one, and that he had to disguise how far he was in the confidence of Louis XV.; with this point in mind it will be easier to un derstand the difficulties in which he was involved. Turning now to the documents, we find that the first letter is from General Yorke. MITCHELL PAPERS, VOL. XV. LD. HOLDERNESSE’S DESPATCHES, etc. 1760; 6818, PLUT. P. L., CLXVIII. I. (12).

Secret. “Hague, March 14 th , 1760. “MY LORD, “My present situation is so very delicate, that I am sensible I stand in need of the utmost indulgence , which I hope I shall continue to find from His Majesty’s unbounded goodness, and that your lordship is convinced that whatever I say, or do, has no other motive but the advantage of the King’s service. As it has pleased His Majesty to convey to France Hi s sentiments in general upon the situation of affairs in Europe, and to express by me His wishes for restoring the public tranquility, I suppose the Court of Versailles imagines the same channel may be the proper one for addressing itself to that of Englan d. This is, at least, the most natural way of accounting for the pains taken by France to employ anybody to talk to me. “Your Lordship know the history of that extraordinary man, known by the name of Count St. Germain, who resided some time in England wher e he did nothing; and has within these two or three years resided in France where he has been upon the most familiar footing with the French King, Madame Pompadour, M. de Belleisle, etc.; which has procured him a grant of the Royal Castle of Chambord, 36 and has enabled him to make a certain figure in that country. “He appeared, for some days, at Amsterdam where he was much caressed and talked of, and upon the marriage of Princess Caroline alighted at the Hague. The same curiosity created the same attention t o him here. His volubility of tongue funished him with hearers; his freedom upon all subjects, all kinds of suppositions — among which his being sent about Peace not the least. “M. d’Affry treats him with respect and attention but is very jealous of him and did not so much as renew my acquaintance with him. He called, however, at my door. I returned his visit; and yesterday he desired to speak with me in the afternoon, but did not come as he appointed, and therefore he renewed his application this morning and was admitted. He began immediately to run on about the bad state of France — their want of Peace — their desire to make it, and his own particular ambition to contribute to an event so desirable for humanity in general; he ran on about his predilection for En gland and Prussia which he pretended at present made him a good friend to France. “As I knew so much of this man, and did not choose to enter into conversation without being better informed, I affected at first to be very grave and dry — told him that those affairs were too delicate to be treated between persons who had no vocation and therefore   36 An Apartment in the Castle: v.

I supposed this style was irksome to him, for immediately afterwards he produced to me, by way of credentials, two letters from Marshal l Belleisle, one dated the 4 th , the other the 26 th of February. In the first he sends him the French King’s passport en blanc for him to fill up; in the second he expresses great impatience to hear from him, and in both runs out in praises of his zeal, his ability, and the hopes that are founded upon what he is gone about. I have no doubt of the authenticity of those letters. “After perusing them, and some commonplace compliments, I asked him to explain himself, which he did as follows: — the King, the Dauphi n, Madame Pompadour, and all the Court and Nation, except the Duke Choiseul and Mr. Berrier, desire peace with England. They can’t do otherwise, for their interior requires it. They want to know the real sentiments of England, they wish to make up matters with some honour. M. d’Affry is not in the secret, and the Duke Choiseul is so Austrian that he does not tell all he receives; but that signifies nothing, for he will be tured out. Madame Pompadour is not Austrian, but is not firm, because she does not kno w what to trust to; if she is sure of Peace, she will become so. It is she, and the Marshal Belleisle, with the French King’s knowledge, who send St. Germain as the forlorn hope. Spain is not relied upon; that is a turn given by the Duke Choiseul, and they don’t pretend to expect much good from that quarter. This, and much more, was advanced by this political Adventurer. I felt myself in a great doubt whether I should enter into conversation; but as I am convinced he is really sent, as he says, I thought I should not be disapproved if I talked in general terms. I therefore told him that the King’s desire for Peace was since, and there could be no doubt of it, since we had made the proposal in the middle of our success which had much increased since; that wit h our Allies, the affair was easy, without them impossible; and that France knew our situation too well, to want such information from me; that as to particulars, we must be convinced of their desire, before they could be touched upon, and that, besides, I was not informed; I talked of the dependence of France upon the two Empresses, and the disagreeable prospect before them even if the King of Prussia was unfortunate, but declined going any farther than the most general, thought the most positive, assuranc e of a desire for Peace on His Majesty’ part. “As the conversation grew more animated I asked him what France had felt the most for in her losses, whether it was Canada? No, he said, for they felt it had cost them thirty - six millions, and brought them no r eturn. Guadaloupe? They would never stop the Peace for that, as they would have sugar enough without it. The East Indies? That he said was the same place, as it was connected with all their money affairs. I asked him what they said of Dunkirk? He made no d ifficulty to demolish it, and that I might depend upon it. He then asked me what we thought about Minorca? I answered, that we had forgot it, at least, nobody ever mentioned it; that, says he, I have told them over and over again, and they are embarrassed with the expense. “This is the material part of what passed in the course of three hours’ conversation which I promised to relate; he begged the secret might be kept, and he should go to Amsterdam, and to Rotterdam, till he knew whether I had any answer; w hich I neither encouraged, nor discouraged him from expecting. “I humbly hope His Majesty will not disapprove what I have done; it is not easy to conduct oneself under such circumstances, though I can as easily break off all intercourse as I have taken it up."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 56 “The King seemed desirous to open the door for Peace, and France seems in great want of it; the opportunity looks favourable, and I shall wait for orders before I stir a step farther.

But as it was evident that he was not authorized, even by that part of the French Ministry in whose name he pretended to talk, as his sejour here could be of no use, and might be attended by disagreeable consequences, it was thought proper to seize h im upon his arrival here. His examination has produced nothing very material. His condut and language are artful, with an odd mixture which it is difficult to define. “Upon the whole it has been thought most advisable not to suffer him to remain in England , and he set out accordingly on Saturday morning last with an intention to take   37 This letter from Lord Holdernesse is to Mr. Mitchell, who was the English Representative at th e Prussian Court.

This Baron Knyphausen has been already mentioned as a friend of M. de St. Germai n by Mons. Dieudonne Thiebault (Mes Souvenirs de vingt ans de sejour a Berlin, vol.

MITCHELL.” There is a mystery about this visit of M. de St. Germain to England which his not solved by the letter of Lord Holdernesse. Even if he did leave at once, his return must hav e been almost immediate, since the newspapers and magazines of the period comment on his arrival in May and June, 1760. In the London Chronicle , June 3 rd , 1760, there is a long account of his arrival in England, speaking of him in favourable terms. There a re hints to be found in various places that he did not really leave; but so far the actual facts of what occurred are not quite clear. There is more yet to be learned in this curious bye - way of European politics. Peace appears more difficult to arrange tha n war, and the personal desires of the French Ministers blocked the way of this mission. Difficult indeed must have been the undertaking for the Comte de St. Germain, thankless the work; at every turn he met opposition, and could not count on support. All this forms a deeply interesting study, but we must now pass on to the mystical and philosophical side of this little understood life."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 60 CHAPTER VII MASONIC TRADITION SONNET PHILOSOPHIQUE ATTRIBUE AU FAMEUX ST.

The “Veil of Isis” ever hides the earnest student of the Great Science from the vulgarly curious; hence in approaching the philosophic and mystic side of this mysterious life the difficulties of research become even more complicated by reason of that veil which hides this Initiate from the outer world. Glimpses of knowledge rare among me; indications of forces unknown to the “general”; a few earnest students, his pupils, striving their utmost to permeate the material world with their knowledge of the unseen spiritual life; such are the signs that surround the Comte de St. Germain, the evidences of his connection with that great Centre from which he came.

Careful research, however, into the Masonic archives proves this to be untrue; indeed, the exact contrary can be shown, for M. de St. Germain was one of the selected representatives of the French Masons at their great convention at Paris in 1785. As one account says: “The Germans who distinguished themselves on this occasion were Bade, von Dalberg, Forster, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick, Baron de Glei chen, Russworm, von Wollner, Lavater, Ludwig Prince of Hesse, Ross - Kampf, Stork, Thaden von Wachter.... The French were honourably represented by St. Germain , St. Martin, Touzet - Duchanteau, Etteila, Mesmer, Dutrousset, d’Herecourt, and Cagliostro.” 40 The same category of names, but with more detail, is given by N. Deschamps. 41 We find Deschamps speaking of M. de St. Germain as one of the Templars. An account is also given of the initiation of Cagliostro by the Comte de St. Germain, and the ritual used on this o ccasion is said to have been that the Knights Templar. It was in this year also that a group of Jesuits brought the wildest and most disgraceful accusations against M. de St. Germain, M. de St. Martin and many others, accusations of immorality, infidelity, anarchy, etc. the charges were leveled at the Philaletheans, or “Rite des Philaletes ou Chercheurs de la Verite,” founded 1773 in the Masonic Lodge of “Les Amis - Reunis.” Prince Karl of Hesse, Savalette de Lange (the Royal Treasurer), the Vicomte de Tavann e, Count de Gebelin, and all the really mystic students of the time were in this order. The Abbe Barruel 42 indicted the whole body, individually and collectively, in terms so violent and on charges so unfounded that even no - Masons and anti - Mystics protested . He accused M. de St. Germain and his followers of being Jacobins, of fomenting and inciting the Revolution, of atheism and immorality. These charges were carefully investigated and rejected as worthless by J. J. Mounier, a writer who was neither Mystic n or Mason, but only a lover of honest dealing. Mounier says: “There are accusations so atrocious, that before adopting them a just man must seek the most authentic testimony; he who fears not to publish them, without being in the position to give decided pr oofs, should be severely punished by law and, where the law fails, by all right - minded people. Such is the procedure adopted by M. Barruel against a Society that used to meet at Ermenonville after the death of Jean Jacques Rousseau, under the direction of the Charlatan St. Germain.” 43 This view appears to be well corroborated, and is upheld by various writers; in fact, the proof is conclusive that M. de St. Germain had nothing to do with the Jacobin party as the Abbe Barruel and the Abbe Migne have tried to insist. Another writer says: “At this time Catholic Lodges were formed in Paris; their protectore were the Marquisese de Girardin and de Bouille. Several Lodges were held at Ermenonville, the property of the first - named. Their chief aim was d’etablir une c ommunication entre Dieu et l’homme par le moyen desetres intermediaries.’” 44   40 Magazin der Beweisfuhrer fur Verurtheilung des Freimaurer - Ordens, i., p. 137; von Dr. E.

Again, both of these Catholic nobles were personal friends of M. de St. Germain; hence it hardly appears possible that the assertions of the Abbes Barruel and Migne had any veracious foundation, since the establishing of “Catholic Lod ges” certainly does not appear atheistical in tendency, nor the close friendship of true Royalists alarmingly revolutionary. According to the well - known writer Eliphas Levi, 45 M. de St. Germain was a Catholic in outward religious observance. Although he was the founder of the Order of St. Joachim in Bohemia, he separated himself from this society as soon as revolutionary theories began to spread among its members. Some of the assemblies in which the Comte de St. Germain taught his philosophy were held in the Rue Platriere; other meetings of the “Philaletes” were held in the Lodge “des Amis - Reunis” in the Rue de la Sourdiere. According to some writers, there was a strong Rosicrucian Foundation — from the true Rosicrucian tradition — in this Lodge. It appears the m embers were studying the conditions of life on higher planes, just as Theosophists of to - day are doing. Practical occultism and spiritual mysticism were the end and aim of the Philaletheans; but alas, the karma of France overwhelmed them, and scenes of blo odshed and violence swept them and their peaceful studies away. A fact that disturbed the enemies of the Comte de St. Germain was the personal devotion of his friends, and that these friends treasured his portrait. In the d’Urfe collection, in 1783, was a picture of the mystic engraved on copper, with the inscription: — “The Comte de St. Germain, celebrate Alchemist,” followed by the words: “Ainsi que Promethée, il deroba le feu, Par qui le monde existe et par qui tout respire; La nature a sa voix obéit et s e meurt. S’il n’est pas Dieu lui - même, un Dieu puissant l’inspire.” This copper - plate engraving was dedicated to the Comte de Milly, an intimate friend of M. de St. Germain, a well - known man of the period, and Chevalier de l’Ordre Royal et Militaire de St. Louis, et de l’Aigle Rouge de Braunschweig. This unlucky portrait, however, produced a furious attack from Dr. Biester, the editor of the Berlinische Monatschrift, in une, 1785. amongst some amusing diatribes, the following is worthy of notice, if only to show how inaccurate an angry editor can be. As we have already see, M. de St. Germain was in the year 1785 chosen representative at the Masonic Conference in Paris. Nevertheless, Herr Dr. Biester, in the same year, open his remarks with the astonishing st atement: “This adventurer, who died two years ago in Dnaish Holstein”! Our editor then proceeds to clinch the argument as follows: “I even know that tho’ he is dead, many now believe that he is till living, and will soon come forth alive! Whereas he is dea d as a doornail, probably mouldering and rotting as any ordinary man who cannot work miracles, and whom no prince has ever greeted.” Ignorance alone must excuse our editor from the charge of being a literary Ananias; but indeed in our own days critics of m atters occult are just as ignorant and equally positive as they were a century ago, no matter what their learning in other respects.   45 Histoir e de la Haute Magie , pp. 419. 420. Paris, 1860."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 63 And indeed there was some justification for the statements of Herr Dr. Biester, for a more recent writer says: — “The church register of Eckernforde shows St. Germain died on February 27 th , 1784 in this town in whose church he was entombed quite privately on March 2 nd , 1784 the so - called Comte de St. Germain and Weldom — further information not known — privately deposited in this c hurch.” In the church accounts it is said: “On March 1 st , for the here deceased Comte de St. Germain a tomb in the Nicolai Church here in the Burial - place sub N. 1, 30 years time of decay 10 Rthlr. And for opening of the same 2 Rthlr., in all 12 Rthlr.” Tr adition tells that the landgrave afterwards got St. Germain buried in Slesvig in the Friederiksberg churchyard there in order to consult his ghost in late hours of the night. On the third of April the mayor and the and the council of Eckernforde gave legal notice concerning his estate. In that it is said: “As the Comte de St. Germain, known abroad, as also here, under the name of Comte de St. Germain and Weldon, who during the last four years has been living in this country, died recently here in Eckernford e, his effects have been legally sealed, and it has been found necessary as well to his eventual intestate heirs, as until now nothing has been ascertained concerning a left will...etc.... Therefore all creditors are called upon come forward with their claims on October 14 th .” 46 This passage shows definitely that M. de St. Germain was well known under the name of Welldown (it is written in very many different ways). But — as to the death — we have much evidence that he did not die: Madame d’Adhemar says speaking of M. de St. Germain: “He is believed to have deceased in 1784, at Schleswig, when with the Elector of Hesse - Casse; the Count de Chalons, however, on returning from his Venetian embassy in 1788, told me of his having spoken to the Comte de Saint - Germain in th e Place Saint Marc the day before he left Venice to go on an embassy to Portugal. I saw him again on one other occasion.” 47 And again from a Masonic source we get the following statement: “Amongst the Freemasons invited to the great conference at Wilhelmsba d 15 th Feb. 1785 we find St. Germain included with St. Martin and many others.” 48 And again from a thoroughly Catholic source: the late Librarian of the Great Ambrosiana Library at Milan says: — “And when, in order to bring about a conciliation between the v arious sects of the Rosicrucians, the Necromantists, the Cabalists, the Illuminati, the Humanitarians, there was held a great Congress at Wilhelmsbad, then in the Lodge of the “Amici riuniti” there also was Cagliostro, with St. Martin, Mesmer and Saint - Ger main.” 49 Evidence there is on both sides, and “Church records” are not always infallible; how many a cause celebre has arisen from a fictitious death. If the Comte de St. Germain wished to disappear from public life, this was the best way to accomplish his wish.   46 BOBE (Louis), Johan Caspar Lavater’s Rejse til Danmark in Sommeren 1793 , viii., p. 156.

To give, then, a few extracts out of many: ST. GERMAIN AND MESMER “ An unknown man had come on a short visit to Vienna. “But his sojourn there extended itself. “His affairs had reference to a far - off time, namely, the twentieth century. “He had really come to Vienna to see one person only. “This person was Mesmer, still a very young man. “Mesmer was struck by the appearance of the stranger. ‘You must be the man,’ said he, ‘whose anonymous letter I received yesterday from the Hague?’ “ ‘I am he.’ “ ‘You wish to speak with me to - day, at this hour, on my ideas concerning magne tism?’ “ ‘I wish to do so.’ “ ‘It was the man who has just left me, who in a fatherly way has guided my ideas in this channel. He is the celebrated astronomer Hell.” 50 “ ‘I know it.’ “ ‘You would make me happy, sir.’ “ ‘I have to do so.’ “The stranger motio ned Mesmer to lock the door. “They sat down. “The kernel of their conversation centred round the theory of obtaining the elements of the elixir of life by the employment of magnetism in a series of permutations. “The conference lasted three hours.... “They a rranged a further meeting in Paris. Then they parted.” 51 That St. Germain and Mesmer were connected in the mystical work of the last century we know from other sources, 52 and that they again met and worked together in Paris, is verified by research among the records of the Lodge meetings already mentioned. This meeting in Vienna must have taken place before Mesmer began his work in Paris judging by the context. Vienna was the great center for the Rosicrucians and other allied   50 Maximilian Hell (Imperial Court Astronomer). To this highly respected scholar are due thanks for having given the impulse to take up magnetism scientifically and practicall y. See Oesterr. National Encyclopadie , art. “Mesmer.” 51 Kleine Wiener Memoiren , i., 81. Wien, 1846. 52 H. P. BLAVATSKY, Theos. Gloss., p. 214.

Among them we find a group of St. Germain’s followe rs. To quote Franz Graffer again: — “One day the report was spread that the Comte de St. Germain, the most enigmatical of all incomprehensibles, was in Vienna. An electric shock passed through all who knew his name. Our Adept circle was thrilled through an d through: St. Germain was in Vienna!... “Barely had Graffer [his brother Rudolph] recovered from the surprising news, than he flies to Hiniberg, his country seat, where he has his papers. Among these is to be found a letter of recommendation from Casanova, the genial adventurer whom he got to know in Amsterdam, addressed to St. Germain. “He hurries back to his house of business; there he is informed by the clerk: ‘An hour ago a gentleman has been here whose appearance has astonished us all. This gentleman wa s neither tall nor short, his build was strikingly proportionate, everything about him had the stamp of nobility.............. He said in French, as it were to himself, not troubling about anyone’s presence, the words: “I live in Fedalhofe, the room in which Leibn itz lodged in 1713.” We were about to speak, when he was already gone. This last hour we have been, as you see, sir, petrified.’................................................... “In five minutes Fedalhofe is reached. Leibnitz’s room is empty. Nobody knows when ‘the American gentleman’ wi ll return home. As to luggage, nothing is to be seen but a small iron chest. It is almost dinner time. But who would think of dining! Graffer is mechanically urged to go and find Baron Linden; he finds him at the ‘Ente.’ They drive to the Landstrasse, whit her a certain something, an obscure presentiment, impels them to drive post haste. “The laboratory is unlocked; a simultaneous cry of astonishment escapes both; at a table is seated St. Germain, calmly reading a folio, which is a work of Paracelsus. They s tand dumb at the threshold; the mysterious intruder slowly closes the book, and slowly rises. Well know the two perplexed men that this apparition can be no other in the world than the man of wonders. The description of the clerk was as a shadow against a reality. It was as if a bright splendour enveloped his whole form. Dignity and sovereignty declared themselves. The men were speechless. The Count steps forward to meet them; they enter. In measured tones, without formality, but in an indescribably ringing tenor, charming the innermost soul, he says in French to Graffer: ‘You have a letter of introduction from Herr von Seingalt; but it is not needed. This gentleman is Baron Linden. I knew that you would both be here at this moment. You have another letter f or me from Bruhl. But the painter is not to be saved; his lung is gone, he will die July 8 th , 1805. A man who is still a child called Buonaparte will be indirectly to blame. And now, gentlemen, I know of your doings; can I be of any service to you? Speak.’ But speech was not possible. “Linden laid a small table, took confectionery from a cupboard in the wall, placed it before him and went into the cellar. “The Count signs to Graffer to sit down, seats himself and says: ‘I knew your friend Linden would retir e, he was compelled. I will serve you alone. I know you through Angelo Soliman, to whom I was able to render service in Africa. If Linden comes I will"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 66 send him away again.’ Graffer recovered himself; he was, however, too overwhelmed to respond more than wi th the words: ‘I understand you: I have a presentiment.’ “Meanwhile Linden returns and places two bottles on the table. St. Germain smiles thereat with an indescribable dignity. Linden offers him refreshment. The Count’s smile increases to a laugh. ‘I ask you,’ said he, ‘is there any soul on this earth who has ever seen me eat or drink?’ He points to the bottles and remarks: ‘This Tokay is not direct from Hungary. It comes from my friend Katherine of Russia. She was so well pleased with the sick man’s paint ings of the engagement at Modling, that she sent a cask of the same.’ Graffer and Linden were astounded; the wine had been bought from Casanova. “The Count asked for writing materials; Linden brought them. The ‘Wundermann’ cuts from a sheet of paper two qu arters of the sheet, places them quite close to each other, and seizes a pen with either hand simultaneously. He writes with both, half a page, signs alike, and says: ‘You collect autographs, sir; choose one of these sheets, it is a matter of indifference which; the content is the same.’ ‘No, it is magic,’ exclaim both friends, ‘stroke, both handwritings agree, no trace of difference, unheard of!’ “The writer smiles; places both sheets on one another; holds them up against the window - pane; it seems as if th ere were only one writing to be seen, so exactly is one the facsimile of the other; they appear as if they were impressions from the same copper - plate. The witnesses were struck dumb. “The Count then said: ‘One of these sheets I wish delivered to Angelo as quickly as possible. In a quarter of an hour he is going out with Prince Lichtenstein; the bearer will receive a little box...’ “St. Germain then gradually passed into a solemn mood. For a few seconds he became rigid as a statue, his eyes, which were always expressive beyond words, became dull and colourless. Presently, however, his whole being became reanimated. He made a movement with his hand as if in signal of his departure, then said: ‘I am leaving ( ich scheide ); do not visit me. Once again will you see me. To - morrow night I am off; I am much needed in Constantinople; then in England, there to prepare two inventions which you will have in the next century — trains and steamboats. These will needed in Germany. The seasons will gradually change — first the spr ing, then the summer. It is the gradual cessation of time itself, as the announcement of the end of the cycle. I see it all; astrologers and meteorologists know nothing, believe me; one needs to have studied in the Pyramids as I have studied. Towards the e nd to this century I shall disappear out of Europe, and betake myself to the region of theHimalayas. I will rest; I must rest. Exactly in eighty - five years will people again set eyes on me. Farewell, I love you.’ After these solemnly uttered words, the Cou nt repeated the sign with his hand. The two adepts, overpowered by the force of such unprecedented impressions, left the room in a condition of complete stupefaction. In the same moment there fell a sudden heavy shower, accompanied by a peal of thunder. In stinctively they return to the laboratory for shelter. They open the door. St. Germain is no more there.... “Here,” continues Graffer, “my story ends. It is from memory throughout. A peculiar irresistible feeling has compelled me to set down these transactio ns in writing once more, after so long a time, just to - day, June 15 th , 1843. “Further, I make this remark, that these events have not been hitherto reported. So herewith do I take my leave.” 53   53 Op, cit ., ii., pp. 136 - 162. It is to be regretted that Graffer’s florid account opens the door to a slight suspicion of"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 67 The curious character of Franz Graffer’s sketches is striking. F rom other sources it can be learned that both of these Graffers were personal friends of St. Germain, both were also Rosicrucians. And though no date is given of the interview here recorded, we can deduce it approximately from another article in the same v olume, where it is said: “St. Germain was in the year ’88, or ’89, or ’90, in Vienna, where we had the never - to - be - forgotten honour of meeting him.” 54 That the Comte de St. Germain was also a Rosicrucian there is no doubt. Constantly, in the Masonic and Mys tic literature of the last century the evidences are found of his intimacy with the prominent Rosicrucians in Hungary and Austria. This mystic body originally sprang up in the central European States; it has, at various times and through different organiza tions, spread the Sacred Science and Knowledge with which some of its Heads were entrusted — the same message from the one Great Lodge which guides the spiritual evolution of the human race. Traces of this teaching, as given by our mystic, are clearly found, and are quoted by Madame Blavatsky, who mentions a “Cypher Rosicrucian Manuscript” 55 as being in his possession. She emphasizes also the entirely Eastern tone of the views held by M. de St. Germain. The fact that M. de St. Germain possessed this rare work shows the position held by him. Turning again to the The Secret Doctrine , 56 we find his teaching on “Numbers” and their values, and this important passage links him again with the Pythagorean School, whose tenets were purely Eastern. Such passages are of de ep interest to the student, for they prove the unity which underlies all the outward diversity of the many societies working under different names, yet with so much in common. On the surface it would appear that better results might have been attained had all these small bodies been welded into one large Society. But in studying the history of the eighteenth century, the reason is evident. In Austria, Italy and France, the Jesuits were all - powerful and crushed out any body of people who showed signs of occu lt knowledge. Germany was at war, England also at war; any large masses of students would certainly have been suspected of political designs. The various small organizations were safer, and it is evident that M. de St. Germain went from one society to anot her, guiding and teaching; of his constant connection with the Masonic circles we have other proofs; M. Bjornstahl writes in his book of travels: — “We were guests at the court of the Prince - Hereditary Wilhelm von Hessen - Cassel (brother of Karl von Hessen) at Hanau, near Frankfort. “As we returned on the 21 st of May 1774 to the Castle of Hanau, we found there Lord Cavendish and the Comte de St. Germain; they had come from Lausanne, and were traveling to Cassel and Berlin. “We had made the acquaintance of th ese gentlemen in Lausanne at the house of Broglio.” 57 This is a most interesting statement, for it shows also the continued intercourse of M. de St. Germain with the Benticnck family, with whom he had so much intercourse in       charlatanry in the mind of the modern student of occultism. It is probably, however, his way of looking at the matter which is at fault. A more experienced student would probably have described the interview far otherwise, although he might have testified as strongly to precisely the same facts. 54 Op. cit ., iii., p. 89 55 The Secret Doctrine , ii., p. 212, 3 rd ed. 56 ii., pp. 616, 617. 57 BJORNSTAHL, J.

Fr. A Sepulcro, “Gimmern, June 3 rd , 1777. “The ‘a Cygne tr’ (Gugomos) has most certainly not gone to Cyprus, but to England.... M. de St. Germain chiefly on my account has come to Dresden. If he does not disguise himself in an extraordinary manner, then he will not suit us, altho’ he is a very wise man.” 59 Evidently a visit was expect which had to be disguised; this gives a clue to the reason why M. de St. Germain was traveling in Le ipzig and Dresden under that name of Comte Weldon. According to Cadet de Gassicourt, he was traveling member for the “Templars,” going from Lodge to Lodge to establish communication between them. M. de St. Germain is said 60 to have done this work for the Pa ris Chapter of the “Knights Templar.” Investigation proves him to have been connected with the “Asiatische Bruder,” or the “Knights of St. john the Evangelist from the East in Europe,” also with the “Ritter des Lichts,” or “Knights of light,” and with vari ous other Rosicrucian bodies in Austria and Hungary; and also with the “Martinists” in Paris. He founded, according to Eliphas Levi, the Order of St. Joachim, but this statement is not supported by any historical evidence at present forthcoming, though man y of his students and friends were members of this body. Everywhere, in every Order where real mystic teaching is to be found, can we trace the influence of this mysterious teacher. A letter of his to the Graf Gortz at Weimar is quoted, saying that he had “promised a visit to Hanau to meet the Landgraf Karl at his brother’s house in order to work out with him the system of ‘Strict Observance’ — the regeneration of the Order of Freemasons in the aristocratic mind — for which you also so earnestly interest yourse lf.” A summarized account from the “Gartenlaube” 61 fits in here; the letters are said to be authentic; and from internal evidence there is little doubt about it; for the information has to do with the Masonic work on which the Comte de St. Germain was engag ed: — “Karl - August went to the Landgrave Adolf von Hessen - Philippsthal - Barchfeld. St. Germain was there and was duly presented to the Duke, was charming in conversation and the latter asked, after supper, his host about the count. “ ‘How old is he?’ “ ‘We do not know anything sure about it. It is a fact that the count knows details which only contemporains could tell in the same way. It is fashion now in Cassel to listen respectfully to his stories an to be astonished about nothing. The count does not prais e himself, neither is he an importune talk - teller, he is a man of good society, whom every one is glad to have. He is not much like by the head of our house, Landgraf Frederick II., who calls him a tiresome moralist. But he is in connection with many remar kable men and has an extraordinary influence upon others. My cousin, Landgrave Karl of Hesse, is much attached to him, they work together in Freemasonry and other dark sciences. Lavater sends him chosen men. He can speak in different voices and from differ ent distances, can copy any hand he sees once, perfectly — he is said to be in connection with   59 Der S ignatstern, oder die enthillten sammtlichen sieben Grade der mystischen Freimaurerei , iii., pt. 1.

Therefore in this moment of excitement he took the part of the marshal. “Gortz received the rare visit in a submissive way; when from slight hints he could notice that the duke was not desirous to speak about Goe the, his countenance was still more brightened. “ ‘At the beginning of May, dear Marshal, I made a highly interesting acquaintance at the Landgraves in Barchfeld,’ said finally the duke, not without embarrassment. ‘An acquaintance which I wish to keep up. It was a certain Comte Saint Germain, who is staying at Cassel; please write to this gentleman and invite him courteously to come over here.’ “Gortz promised to meet this request within the shortest time and to the best of his ability. “When the duke had g one away, he sat down to his writing table and wrote as follows: “Letter of Count Gortz: — “ ‘Triumph, dear count. Your knowledge of men, your addresses conquer. You have foretold well: our gracious master is enchanted with you and asks you hereby, in due form through me to come to his court. “ ‘You are really a wonder - worker, for his detested, plebeian favourite now totters ... a little help, one stroke of your genius and the advocate of Frankfurt, who intrudes upon us, is checkmated. Will you fight him open ly now, or do you prefer to make first an incognito personal survey of the territory? Put down one or two mines for him and show yourself only when he is totally beaten out of the field? And then take his place with far more right and power? “ ‘I leave all this to your sagacity. Rely upon me as before, entirely, and a small elite of faithful aristocrats, one or two of which you may wish to bind closer to you if you think it good. “ ‘Always yours truly’  “ ‘Count Gortz, marshal o f court.’ “St. Germain’s answer: “ ‘Dear Count! “ ‘I am quite ready to associate further with you and your companions in opinion, very grateful for the complaisant invitation. I will follow it later on. “ ‘In the present moment I have promised to visit han au, to meet the Landgrave Karl at his brother’s and work out with him the system of the “Strict Observance” — the regeneration of the order of freemasons in an aristocratic sense — which interests you too so much. “ ‘The Landgrave is to me a dear and sympathet ic protector, and if not a prince regnant, his position in Schleswig attached to Danish service, is very princely. I will, by all means, before I decide quite for the Landgrave, come to Weimar, liberate you from the hated intruder, and recognize the field there. Maybe I will prefer to do incognito at first. “ ‘Recommend me faithfully to your master, and promise my visit for some time to come."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 71 “ ‘In the name of prudence, silence and wisdom I salute you “ ‘Yours “St. Germain.’” From internal evidence this is an authentic letter, for the Comte de St. Germain would certainly have been helping in this body, based as it was on the old “Order of the Templar” which will be treated at length later on. It was, moreover, to save themselves from persecution that these members called themselves “Free and Adopted Masons,” and adopted the signs and words of Masonry. Undoubtedly the “Strict Observance” sprang from the most secret “Order of the Templar,” a truly occult organization in the olden time. At the suggestion of the Comte de St. Martin and M. Willermoz the name was changed because of the suspicions of the police; the new one chose was “The Beneficent Knights of the Holy City.” Baron von Hund was the first Grand - Master; on his death the general leadership was vested i n the Grand Duke of Brunswick, an intimate friend of M. de St. Germain. All these various organizations will be dealt with in order; at present they are merely mentioned to show the connecting link formed by M. de St. Germain between the separate bodies, w ith whom M. de St. Germain had work to do; an Austrian writer in a recent article says: — “ In the Masonic and Rosicrucian literature one often finds hints as to the relations of St. Germain’s adherents in Vienna was Count J. F. von Kufstein, in whose Lodge (in the house of Prince Auersberg0 magical meetings were held which generally lasted from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. St. Germain was present at one such meeting and expressed his satisfaction with the workings. “ ... St. Germain collected old pictures and portraits; he was addicted to alchemy, believed in universal medicine and made studies as to animal magnetism. He impressed people, especially the higher classes, by his French manners, his wide knowledge and his talkativeness. This ‘Bohemian’ so much attacked by hi storians, played the part of a political agent during the peace negotiations between France and Austria. Again, he is said to have distinguished himself in the year 1792 in the revolution. “He was the ‘Obermohr’ of many mystic brotherhoods, where he was wo rshipped as a superior being and where every one believed in his ‘sudden’ appearances and equally ‘sudden’ disappearances. He belongs to the picture of ‘Old Vienna’ with its social mysteriousness; where it was swarming with Rosicrucians, Asiatics, Illumina tes, Alchemists, Magnetopaths, Thaumaturgs, templars, who all of them had many and willing adherents. “Dr. Mesmer who knew the Comte St. Germain well from his stay in Paris, requested him to come to Vienna in order that he might pursue his study of animal magnetism with him. St. Germain stayed secretly here and was then known as the ‘American of the Felderhof’ which latter became later on ‘Laszia House’ in the Lugeck N. 3. Dr. Mesmer was much helped by the Count and here in Vienna his (Mesmer’s) teaching wa s written down. Soon Mesmer gained followers but he was obliged to leave the town. He went to Paris where his ‘Harmonious Society’ — a secret society of savants — continued to exist. In Vienna St. Germain came in touch with many mystagogues. He visited the fam ous laboratory of the Rosirucians in the Landstrasse behind the hospital where he instructed"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 72 for some time his brethren in the sciences of Solomon. The Landstrasse, situated on the outskirts of Vienna, was for many centuries a region of spooks. “Below in t he Erdberg the Templars and the estates of their order and outside town in the Simmering there was in the times of Rudolf II. the gold kitchen where the eccentric fraternity endeavoured to make gold. It is certain that the Comte de St. Germain has been in Veinna in the year 1735, and also later. The arrival of the Count (who enjoyed at that time a great prestige) at once created a great sensation in the initiated circles.” 62 The following is a list of some of the societies, more or less connected with Masonr y, which had “Unknown Heads.” Translated they are as follows: The Canons of the Holy Sepulchre. The Canons of the Holy Temple of Jerusalem. The Beneficent Knights of the Holy City. The Clergy of Nicosia in the Island of Cyprus. 63 The Clergy of Auvergne. The Knights of Providence. The Asiatic Brothers; Knights of St. John the Evangelist. The Knights of Light. The African Brothers. Then there are groups of various Rosicrucian bodies widely spread in Hungary and Bohemia. In all of these bodies enumerated can be traced clearly the guiding hand of that “messenger” of the eighteenth century, or of some of his immediate friends and followers. Again in all of these groups can be found, more or less clearly, those fundamental principles which all the true messengers o f the Great Lodge are bound to teach: such, for instance, as the evolution of the spiritual nature of man; reincarnation; the hidden powers of nature; purity of life; nobleness of ideal; the Divine power that is behind all and guides all. These are the clu es which show without possibility of doubt to those who search for truth, that Lodge whence came the Comte de St. Germain, the messenger whose life is here but roughly sketched. His work was to lead a portion of the eighteenth century humanity to that same goal which now, at the end of the nineteenth century, again stands clear before the eyes of some Theosophists. From his message many turned away in scorn, and from the present leaders the blind ones will to - day turn away also in scorn. But the few whose e yes are opening to the glad light of a spiritual knowledge, look back to him who bore the burden in the last century with gratitude profound.    62 MAILY, A. d e — Der Zirkel, March 1 st , 1908. 63 This is the Society mentioned by the Minister Wurmb in the letter quoted."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 73 APPENDICES"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 74 APPENDIX I DOCUMENTS CONCERNING THE APARTMENT IN CHAMBORD OFFERED TO THE COMTE DE SA INT GERMAIN BY LOUIS XV.

He replied briskly that if Messrs. Paris were allowed to become masters of it, they would soon become so of the whole finances of the kingdom, and that he had come to Holland solely to complete the formation of a Company adequate to the responsibility of this fund; in which case I think he would be annoyed to see it pass into other hands than those of his associates, if this scheme were adopted. “M. de St. Germain told me that M. Bentinck de Rhoone had complained to him of my reserve towards him, and that I never spoke to him on m atters of business. He added that M. Bentinck had assured him that no - one was less English than himself, that he was a true Patriot and more French that I believed.

De Goloffkin and de Reischach that M. de St. Germ ain was a man absolutely disavowed by us and that no trust or confidence should be placed in anything he might choose to say about our affairs or our Government. I said further to M. de Brunswick that when he had an opportunity, perhaps that very day, of s eeing Mr. Yorke, I begged him earnestly to make the same declaration to him for me. I also made it yesterday morning to the Pensionary and the Registrar. “ On my return from Riswick the evening before last, I sent to request M. de St. Germain to pay me a vi sit. He was not found at home; I sent him a card of invitation to come to me here yesterday morning at eight o’c. I was obliged to send again to find him, and he came at last. I did not think I ought to pass on to him the letters of M. Belleisle,"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 82 for fear of the bad use he might make of them, but I told him that M. le Marechal had told me by the express order of the king that I was to listen to all he had to say to me. I asked him if there were overtures relating to our soldiery, and he said ‘no.’ I asked h im if they concerned our Navy or our finances. And again he said ‘no,’ to which I replied that they could only be political, and thereupon I read him all that you wrote me as to the fate that awaits him if he returns to France. At first he affected great i ndifference, then he expressed astonishment at the treatment with which such a man as himself was threatened, but he seemed to me to be at last troubled by it. Since, however, he did not appear to me resolved to abandon the schemes which his disquietude su ggests, I warned him very seriously again, as we parted, that if he chose to meddle in any way whatever with His Majesty’s affairs and interests, I should report it to you, and I should say publicly here, that all that he had put forward was absolutely rep udiated by His Majesty and by His Ministry. I went at once to keep my appointment with Mr. Yorke, after having dismissed the matter which I reported to you in my dispatch under No. 575. I asked Mr. Yorke if M. de St. Germain had been at his house. He told me that he had been there twice; that on the first visit he had spoken to him of the Peace, and that he had replied second visit, he, Mr. Yorke, had become more reserved because he then knew that my house had been forbidden to M. de St. Germain. He added t hat the Duke of Newcastle had written to him with reference to the report he had given of this man’s first visit, that he might tell him in reply that overtures of peace on the part of France would always be welcomed in London, thro’ whatever channel they might come, but I don not know whether Mr. Yorke communicated this reply to him. “I beg of you, M. le Duc, to communicate this dispatch to M. le Marechal de Belleisle and I am very sure that he will cease all correspondence with a man whose conduct is such as I have described to you. I add here a packet for M. de Belleisle by private express, in which I return him with my letter the two letters which he had sent me for M. de St. Germain. “I ought to tell you further that M. de St. Germain has the assurance to assert everywhere, and even to tell me that his Majesty has been so good as to grant him Chambord, on the same terms as granted to the lat M. le Marechal de Saxe, excepting the revenues ... which he said he should not have wished to have.” D’AFFRY.

I replied that assertions so absurd could mislead no one, and that I should consider it derogatory to my Ministry to contradict them. This information was given to me by one of the Republican Chiefs who in fact is an enemy of M. de Bentinck, but whom I have always known as an honourable man. “M. de St. Germain is absolutely discredited, and he will meet with no credence here from any Foreign Minister or Minister of the Republic; but I considered it my duty to make you acquaintance with all this, because this man may give false impressions and"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 83 such as would be disadvantageous to us, as to a pretended division in our Ministry, which does not exist....’ D’AFFRY.

It is to the interest of all Sovere igns and of Public Faith that this kind of insolence should be put down, which with no authority, chooses to meddle with the affairs of such a Power as France. I think that the case in question should be regarded as at least as much ’privileged’ as those w hich usually demand the reclamation and extradition of a malefactor.

In short, M onsr., the King absolutely wills that this adventurer shall be cried down and disgraced in the United Provinces, and that he shall if possible be punished as his attempt deserves.

He asked me if knew of the departure of M. de St. Germain. I told him I did not; he informed me that the evening before last, between 7 and 8 o’c., M. de Bentinck had been to the house of this adventurer, that he had let it again before 9 o’c., that then M. Pieck de Zoelen had come there, that he did not stay very long, that afterwards M. de Bentinck had come again between 9 and 10, and that he had remained there until after midnight; that M. de St. Germain had gone to bed, and that at 5 o’c. in the morni ng he had taken his tea, and that a lackey of M. de Bentinck’s had appeared at the door with a hired carriage and four, into which this rascal stepped, but the landlord could not tell what road he had taken, nor could he say if m. de Bentinck’s lackey went with him. “This departure was so hasty that he left at the house “coepeaus” (?) either silver or tin, and some bottle of some unknown liqueur. I controlled myself enough to conceal from M. de Kauderbach the indignation that I felt at the conduct of M. de Bentinck. I said nothing to him as to my orders about the reclamation and extradition. I simply asked if he were certain of all the particulars that he had just given me. He told me that he had them from M. de St. Germain’s landlord himself, who was a Sxon . He suggested sending him to me. We sent for him; he came, and confirmed all that M. de Kauderbach had told me. “When M. de Kauderbach had left my house, I sent to request the Pensionary to let me see him; he had only returned home from a grand dinner at which he had been present at 7 o’c. and he put off my visit until this morning at 9 o’c. I went to him and asked him what about the affair of M. de St. Germain. He replied that he alone could not take the responsibility on himself, that I t was quite neces sary that I should present a memorial t o M. de Bentinck, President of the Committee of Rade; that he thought that this Tribunal would decide on the arrest of M. de St. Germain, but not on his extradition before being authorized so to do by the States of H olland at their approaching Convocation. I replied that I should certainly not present a memorial to M. de Bentinck, and that I would tell him why. I then told him the particulars of M. de St. Germain’s departure, and of what preceded it, excepting the cir cumstances which might compromise the host, and I told him these details in a way to make him believe that I had discovered the comings and goings of M. de Bentinck in the house, and the appearance of his hired lackeys with the carriage, only thro’ the car eful watching of my spies. He seemed to me to be honestly indignant at all that he heard. I said that since the escape of the adventurer had been furthered by the Hague, he had perhaps sought refuge at Amsterdam, and that I was going to write to our Commis sary of Marine, M. d’Astier, to request that this scoundrel be arrested in the name of His Majesty, and detained under safe guard until I received final"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 85 orders.

This last seemed to me to embarrass the Pensionary greatly, and I should not be surprised if he were arrested at Amsterdam on our requisition, but I am pers uaded that he will not be there, and that he will have already gained the frontier of the frontier of the Republic. The Memorial which I request your permission to present to the States General, and of which I here append the rough draft, may appear, if Hi s Majesty approves of it, in all the Gazettes, and will cast a stigma on this adventurer from which he can never recover.

He has borrowed from the Jew ‘Boas’ two thousand florins for which he has deposited with the Jew three opals, real or false, in a sealed paper. The two thousand florins should be repaid on the 25 th inst. And Boas told M. de Kauderbach yesterday that if th e letter of exchange for the money did not arrive on the 25 th , he should put up these opals for public sale. I shall act with regard to M. de Bentinck as you desired me in your last dispatch, unless His Majesty should give me fresh orders in this respect, and if I meet him one of these days I shall speak to him of M. de St. Germain and his departure, without committing myself, but so as to force him to disavow his conduct altogether, and his connection with this adventurer.” D’AFFRY.

I replied that this man had been to see me, that I had asked hi m if, as a subject of the King, he had offered this machine to our Ministry before taking it to foreigners; that Lignieres had told me that he had performed this duty, but that the machine had not been accepted; that I did not think much of it from what Li gnieres told me and from what I knew of forcing methods and their friction. I added that what gave me the worst opinion of this undertaking was the protection given to its promoters by the Comte de St. Germain, who had recommended them to me. Alaman told m e that he was very glad to have the opportunity of gaining information as to everything concerning this celebrated man, if I would kindly give it to him. I replied that I would conceal nothing from him that I was convinced that M. de Bentnck would altogeth er disavow what such an impostor had put forth in his name. Upon that I gave him a detailed account of all the impostures that the adventurer had practised here. He seemed surprised at it, and I did not conceal from him how much surprised I was myself at t he conduct of M. de Bentinck up to the moment of the adventurer’s escape. M. Alaman made but a poor defence for him on that point, and then leaving M. de St. Germain, he spoke of M. de Bentinck exactly as M. de St. Germain had done, telling among other thi ngs that M. de Bentinck throughout his conduct, had no other object than the interests and the welfare of the country; that my estrangement with regard to him was merely because I knew him only from the reports of his enemies, and that if I would take mean s to become personally acquainted with him I should soon give up my prejudices against him. I replied, that at the beginning of my residence here I had endeavoured to make M. de Bentinck’s acquaintance, and this is the simple truth, but that he had always refused the advances I had made, and I owned that they did not continue long, because I soon saw that he did not respond to them. “I said further that M. de Bentinck’s behaviour on the departure of M. de St. Germain from the Hague did not appear to me to s how any sign of the desire he suggested to oblige us. M. Alaman replied that he did not know what had occurred as to that, but that he could assure me that M. Bentinck had a real desire to know me. I replied coldly that he might assure him that I should al ways be glad to show him the courtesy due to a man of his rank and occupying one of the highest posts in the Republic. “If M. de Bentinck continues the desire to approach us, I shall behave towards him outwardly as His Majesty commands me, but in such a wa y, that the Republicans cannot take umbrage at it and that M. de Bentinck cannot take advantage of it in any way. “This new departure of his, coming from a man who has been uniformly devoted to him for the last twenty years, convinces me that the so - called Comte de St. Germain had really spoken in his name, since he had acted very much like Alaman."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 88 “M. de Bentinck has always openly opposed us, and with so much bitterness that it is impossible to believe that the wish to oblige us should make him renounce hi s principles in order to further our interests, and I am strongly of opinion that all he is doing to approach us is merely owing to his great desire and need to maintain and increase his credit here. “He must feel that the surest way of raising it would be to get into close relations with the principal foreign Ministers, who may be charged with endeavouring to promote Peace, and I think that on the contrary it is most essential that instructions should be issued here that M. de Bentinck should never have an y trust places in him by us.

I thought it my duty to put some questions to him, in order to see if this machine could really be of much use to us in the clearing of our ports or of our rivers, but his replies were so uncertain and showed so little capacity that I found he did not know even the first principles of mechanics. He undertook and carried out the construction of this machine in the town of Woorbourg, near hers, and he invited me some months ago, to go there to see it tested, which did not prove successful.... [here follows a des cription of the machine]. “There is a second one which has succeeded better. It is a pump which has much less friction than ordinary pumps, but I believe it is the same as that which has been used at Besancon for several years. “M. de Linieres, convinced t hat these machines are of great use, has begged me to allow him the honour of writing to you about them and of sending you the papers which he sent me on the subject, and which I here append. Your will find in them a request to the King, a scheme of privil ege, a memorial of observation concerning these inventions; a translation of an extract from the resolutions of the States of Holland respecting these machines and lastly an account of the precuts of the machine of (?) in order to compare them with the res ults of M. de Linieres’ new machine; but this last paper contains nothing but a calculation, which is absolutely false on consideration and after the experiment which I witnessed and which has not been verified since.

He (St. Germain) told me... that there would be no obstacles would come from France ... that the King of France and Mme de Pompadour, the whole Court as well as the whole of the country, were passionately longing for Peace; that one man alone prevented it. viz. the Duc de Choiseul, won over as he was by the Court of Vienna (the Queen of Hungary)... tha t all the confusion and misfortunes in Europe were due to the Treaty of Versailles in 1756 .. in which there was a secret clause giving the Flanders to the Infante, in exchange for Silesia, which latter had to be subdued, given up, and made over to the Que en of Hungary .... There was but one way to get out of it, and that was by concluding Peace between England and France; that the usual methods of “Preliminaries, Congresses, and Conferences” would mean spinning out things indefinitely and would cause War aga in, the mere idea of which makes one shudder; he was of opinion that if only some possible propositions were brought forward, or if only some honest men in whom people could put faith would intervene, Peace would be made ... it being as necessary to England as it was to France; that the King and Mme de Pompadour wished it fervently, that the King of England wished it not less, that the Duke of Newcastle and Count Granville (Charles Foronshead) were very much in favour of it (speaking of Chesterfield, he said firmly while looking fixedly at me to see what I would answer: “Chesterfield is a mere trifler”), that Pitt who now made common cause with the two others, had always crossed him hitherto, but that Pitt was hated by the King ... that a Scotchman of the name o f Crammon who lived in Paris had received a letter from Neuville in Amsterdam, in which he was warned to be prepared to receive him, that Crammon received another letter from London which came actually via Brussels, and that this latter contained suggestio ns for making a separate Peace between France and England; that these suggestions came from the Duke of Newcastle and from Lord Granville; that this letter had been communicated to him by Mme de Pompadour (he gave details ... “she was in bed”); that her deli ght was great, she told him to mention it to Choiseul; that he remonstrated but ended by obeying; that Choiseul rejected everything. ... Concerning Amsterdam, St. Germain spoke of its greatness, of the number of its inhabitants, its treasures, its money circ ulation, its superiority in this respect to London, Paris and any other city in the world.” Tues day, March 11 th , 1760. He told me that he had informed Mme de Pompadour of what had passed between himself and me ... and that he had also written to the Minist er to that effect. When I asked him how the Minister would receive the news, he said with a smiling but assured look that changes would be soon taking place at Versailles, giving me to understand that it would not be in Choiseul’s power to prevent Peace fo r long.

Sunday, march 16 th , 1760. The whole of the conversation was so var ied and so full of extraordinary anecdotes, together with the singularity of the man himself and other circumstances (which I, however, knew already more particularly from Yorke and d’Affry), dealing with his relations with the King and Mme de Pompadour, t hat it occurred to me to take advantage of it in order to fathom the depths of this business, and thus forestall the false information of various people engaged in it who are only thinking of their own interests, put right the wrong impressions which are r ife as to the policy of this Country, and insinuate myself into an affair which it is most important that I should understand clearly, despite the inclination which is shown to exclude me from it. in pursuance of this plan I egged him on by my queries to w hich he replied promptly and clearly. . . .(He speaks like a mere “rattlepate,” although I would not venture to say that he is one.) I evinced great impartiality for all humanitarian reasons alone, and to share the personal French Nation, of which he(St. G ermain) gave me a vivid and detailed picture, as that of a man who knew more than others on this subject. He spoke with so much precision of people, that I went on as I had begun and told him of my hopes, of the silly rumours and the absurd and ridiculous stories which the foreign Ministers here wrote to their masters. . . . I egged him on, making him speak (which is easy enough!) and he continued smoothly. . . . Wednesday, March 26 th , 1760. ... that he had decided on Monday to call on d’Affry, who told him t hat he had received letters from Versailles ordering him to tell him(St. Germain) that he had got himself into a bad scrape at Court by writing about me to Mme de Pompadour, into a bad scrape indeed! That he mixed himself up far too much with things which did not concern him! And that he (St. Germain) was ordered in the King’s name to mind his own business! That d’Affry had spoken as if he thought he could scare him into leaving the place; that he had also told him he had orders not to see him (St. Germain) , but to deny him admittance! Listening to him to the end, he (St. Germain) had finally answered that “if anyone had got into a bad ‘scrape’ it was not himself but d’Affry. . . that as regards what had been enjoined on him in the name of the King, he (St. Germain), not being his subject, the King could not order him to do anything; that moreover he believed that M. de Choiseul had written it all on his own initiative and that the King knew nothing about it! if he were shown an order (written) by the King hi mself he would believe it: but not otherwise. . . .” He (St. Germain) told me that he had written an” Instructive Memoir” which he intended to send d’Affry and which he read aloud to me. He laughed and I did the same, thinking of the effect that his “Instr uctive Memoir” would have on d’Affry. He called the latter “block - head,” “poor fellow” and “this poor d’Affry who thinks he can awe and bully me, but ... he has come to the wrong person, for I have trampled under foot both praise an blame, fear and hope, I, who have no other object but to follow the dictates of my benevolent feelings towards humanity and to do as much good to mankind as possible. The King knows very well that I fear neither d’Affry nor M. de Choiseul.” Thursday, March 27 th , 1760. The Comte d e St. Germain told me under pledge of secrecy, as “he did not wish to"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 95 conceal anything from me,” that he had spent this day, four hours with M. Yorke, who had shown him the answers that he had received from England on the 25 th , dated the 21 st , from the Duk e of Newcastle, Mr. Pitt and Lord Holdernesse, relating to what Yorke had written them about his previous conversations with him (St. Germain). He thereupon showed me three little notes which he had received and which he made me read; in one of these notes Yorke expressed the wish to talk with him and specified what was required from the Comte in order that they might speak with one another without being disavowed in their public or private positions ... it was demanded that he (St. Germain) should be “offici ally empowered” or something skin to that, in order that it might be possible for Yorke to speak openly with him, without fear of being compromised. He (St. Germain) told me that Yorke had given him the original letters of the before - named ministers to rea d; that he knew the handwriting of each of them except that of Pitt, and that these letters were most complimentary to him.... ... Do what he might, d’Affry was now powerless, and he (St. Germain) held the question of Peace in his own hands; the only remaining obstacle in his way was M. de Choiseul who might “perhaps fail to extract all the benefit possible for Europe in general and France in particular from this opportunity.” Upon this I told him he should find some device wherewith to control M. de Choiseul’s actions. He asked for my opinion (just as if I knew the French Court and the strong and weak points of the people in it!). I said it “was for him to find any such means,” etc.... he seemed to be anxious about the reply he would get from Choiseul, whom he da red not ignore but whose real desire for Peace he strongly doubted.... Monday, March 31 st , 1760. ... He told me he possessed something which would “knock Choiseul into a cocked hat,” that all decent people in France desired Peace ... that Choiseul alone wished to continue the war ... that he had a powerful weapon against Choiseul in the letters which Yorke had written him, and of which he kept the originals to use if necessary against Choiseul whom he did not fear in the least ... that d’Affry was the slave of Chois eul ... that Choiseul would not dare to conceal letters of which Mme de P. and the Marshal de Belle - Isle were informed. Friday, April 14 th , 1760. Councilor Pensionnnaire (Stein) told me that d’Affry had informed him that the orders he had received from Choi seul with regard to St. Germain consisted mainly in disavowing everything that St. Germain had done or would do here, with regard to the Peace ... that by them he was obliged to communicate this to St. Germain adding that if he mixed himself up in the matter he would be imprisoned on his return to France.... The Recorder Fagel said to me much the same thing as that which “had told him only this morning.” ... The same day St. Germain dined with me and told me that “d’Affry had communicated his orders to him and sh own him Choiseul’s letter”; he had answered that this “would not hinder him from returning to France, that these orders would never be put into force ... that they only emanated from Choiseul ... that he had known Yorke from his childhood, 17 years back, and t hat the Yorke family had always been kindness itself to him” ; ... that d’Affry had also objected to his frequently calling upon me, which St. Germain had owned to doing and had added that he “intended to continue doing so.” That"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 96 d’Affry had shown him Choise ul’s letter together with the one that he (St. Germain) had himself written about me to Mme de pompadour (to this he added that he was convinced that Choiseul had stolen from Mme de P.); also that d’Affry had repeatedly told him that France would never tru st me.... On the whole it seemed as if he cared very little for the orders which d’Affry had received with regard to him, and still less for M. de Choiseul! ... and that the whole matter remained undecided; ... that France would run the risk of War again and tha t if such a thing happened he (St. Germain) would “go to England and then see what he could do.” Tuesday, April 15 th , 1760. The Councillor Pensionnaire told me, in his room, that d’Affry had shown him the orders that he had received the night before by a courier declaring that St. Germain was a “mere vagabond,” and that everything that he might have said should be disowned! That a complaint should be drawn up against him, that he should be arrested and brought under escort to Lille to be handed over to Fra nce where he would be imprisoned.... I told him my view, which was that St. Germain had come to this country like other strangers trusting in the protecting of the Law and counting on his safety as one of the public; that he was not charged with any crime of such a nature that no Sovereign would give protection against it, such as murder, poisoning, etc., and that the right of sanctuary was considered very sacred in this Republic.... He agreed to this, but seemed very anxious about the feelings of France.... I we nt into the Recorder’s room and he told me in the presence of the Councillor Pensionnaire, that d’Affry had come to him and told him ... (follows the same discourse as with the Coun. Pen.), ... and that he had advised him to address himself to the Government e st.; ... but that he did not think that the Government etc.; ... but that he did not think that the Government would hand over a person who lived in this country trusting to its protection, and against whom there was no charge of any heinous crime against whic h no Sovereign would grant protection.... Wednesday, April 16 th , 1760. “... I told the Councillor Pensionnaire that M. de St. Germain had gone, of which he seemed very glad....” Wednesday, April 16 th , 1760. When I informed Yorke of what I had just heard about St. Germain I expected that he would shield him, for Yorke had begun to negotiate with St. Germain and had encouraged him; I have myself seen the originals of his letters to St. Germain, they are very friendly and encouraging. But, instead of shielding St. Germain, Yorke put on his hard, haughty and supercilious expression saying that he “would be very glad to see St. Germain in the hands of the Police.” I was thunderstruck, knowing what I did; I told him my opinion, very gently and diffidently so as not to offend him; but Yorke persisted in saying that “he washed his hands of St. Germain,” and refused to let me have a passport for the Packet Boat which I had asked him to give me. Pressed by me, Yorke said at last that if I asked him for a passport, as a per sonal favour, he would not refuse me “owing to my position.’ I agreed; ... mentioned that d’Affry might cause us a lot of trouble which might be prevented by giving St. Germain the means to escape, and Yorke then called his Secretary and bade him bring a pas sport."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" 97 He signed it and handed it to me “blank,” so that St. Germain might fill in his own name or whatever other name he might choose to take in order to avoid the pursuit of d’Affry or his minions. I carried away the passport without showing Yorke to wha t an extent I was shocked and revolted by what I had witnessed. Thursday, April 17 th , 1760. The Councillor Pensionnaire writes to tell me that d’Affry called on him in order to complain of me; that d’Affry said he was well informed of everything, that I h ad gone to see the Comte de St. Germain on Tuesday evening about 10, and had stayed with him until one hour after midnight, that a coach drawn by four horses had arrived before the house with a servant of mine and that M. de St. Germain had left in this co ach with my servant behind, and that he (d’Affry) was consequently unable to fulfill his instructions! April 18 th , 1760. Some months ago Mr. Yorke recommended to me very warmly a certain Mr. Linieres who came here in order to secure a patent for a machine of new invention.... D’Affry paid me a visit, and while speaking of Linieres mentioned that he was connected with St. Germain. The name struck me and excited my curiosity on account of all that I had heard about the Count in England, where he had stayed a c ountry like England, where there are practically no secret police, but what did astonish me was that in France the King alone knew it, and in England he believed the Duke of Newcastle knew it also. I repeated to M. d’Affry several particulars which I had h eard about St. Germain concerning his manners, wealth and magnificence, the regularity with which he paid his debts, the large sums he had spent in England where life is expensive, etc. M. d’Affry observed that he was decidedly a very remarkable man of who m all kinds of stories were told, each more absurd than the other; for instance that he possessed the Philosopher’s Stone, that he was a hundred years old, altho’ he did not look like fort, etc.! Having asked him if he knew him personally he answered “yes, ” that he had me him at the house of the Princesse de Montaubon, that he was a very welcome and well - known figure at Versailles and often called on Madame de Pompadour, that he was exceedingly sumptuous and magnificent... and amongst other things gave me par ticulars of his munificence with regard to paintings, jewels and curios; he told me still more which I do not remember, nor do I remember all the questions I put him.... Pondering over what occurred between the Comte d’Affry and myself, I have the impression that he was as astonished as I was myself at these particulars with regard to the figure which the Comte de St. Germain had cut in England and in France being discussed without a single imputation being made against him.... I will mention this in the course of conversation with Yorke.... Yorke spoke of him as being a very cheerful and very polite man, who had insinuated himself into the cabinet of Mme de Pompadour and to whom the King had given Chambord.... He mentioned that later on, he made St. Germain’s acqua intance when the latter had been in Amsterdam and came to the Hague.... It was in March he (St. Germain) came to see me owing to what Linieres had written him [viz. that Bentinck van Rhoon wished to make his acquaintance]; ... his conversation pleased me very much, being exceedingly brilliant, varied and full of details about various countries he had visited ... all very"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" 98 interesting.... I was exceedingly pleased with his judgment of persons and place known to me; his manners were exceedingly polite and went to prov e that he was a man brought up in the best society. He had come from Amsterdam with Madame Geelvinck and Mr. A. Hope and had been admitted daily to the house of Mayor Hasselaar; he had come to the Hague recommended to M. de Soele, by the Hassellaar family who had taken him to Mme de Byland and elsewhere. On the birthday of the Prince of Orange at the old Court (giving his name at the door) I took him to the Ball where he was spoken to by the Hasselaars, by Mme Geelvinck, Mme Byland and others. It had been h is intention to leave on the day after the Ball, and he had retained a coach from Amsterdam in order to drive home the two ladies who had come with him, but they made him stay three or four days longer. During this time he was daily with d’Affry and dined at d’Affry’s house before returning to Amsterdam; I had several talks with him of which most have slipped from my memory.... It is noteworthy that during the interval which elapsed between the day after the Ball and the day on which he left, d’Affry (believi ng him to be about to start) sent wine and meat for the journey to St. Germain every day. I can bear witness to this myself, as I was present when d’Affry’s servant brought them on two succeeding days. As St. Germain did not leave after all, he went and di ned at d’Affry’s house.... I went myself to the Comte de St. Germain and advised him in his own interests to leave as soon as possible. I told him I was informed, not directly, but thro’ a third person, that d’Affry had instructions to order his arrest and t o have him conducted under escort to the French frontier and given up to France in order that he might be imprisoned there for the rest of his life. He was exceedingly surprised, not so much at M. de Choiseul giving such an order, as at D’Affry daring to t hink of doing such a thing in a law - abiding country; he put a lot of questions each one more pertinent than the other, and with the greatest composure in the world; I did not wish to discuss the matter with him, as I should have found it rather difficult t o answer his enquiries and enlighten him on the points he raised. I told him there was no time for discussion, but that he should start at once if he considered his safety, that he had till the morrow to make his preparations, as even if M. d’Affry intende d to take steps he could not do so until 10 o’c. the next morning, and before then he (St. Germain) should have made and carried out his plans. The methods of his retreat was now discussed as well as the question of where to go.... With regard to the first, I offered him my services ... with regard to the second, I suggested England; its proximity, its laws, its constitution and the greatness of this nation offering him a nearer and safer refuge than that of any other country.... We agreed on this point; I said t hat I would procure him a passport from Mr. Yorke, as without it he could not embark on the Packet Boat. As a ship was crossing the next day, I said he would do well to go on board at Hellevoetsluis and to do so as quickly as possible; this done all d’Affr y’s proceedings would be too lat, etc.... In the evening about seven or eight o’clock I went to St. Germain and took him the passport. He put a lot of questions to me which I evaded answering, requesting him to think rather of more pressing matters than of q ueries which were abstruse and useless in the present emergency. He decided to leave; a none of his servants knew either the language or the roads or the customs of the country, he asked me to lend him one of mine, which I did, with pleasure.... I did more, I ordered a coach with four horses for the purpose of going to Leyden to be before my"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 99 house at 4.30. next morning, and told one of my servants to pick up the Comte de St. Germain on the way and stay with him until he should be sent back to me.... (A defence of his (entinck’s) conduct follows, saying that secret treaties have always been allowed.) If the Comte de St. Germain had shown as much prudence as he had shown zeal, he would have, I believe, much accelerated Peace; but he relied too much on his own inte ntions and had not a bad enough opinion of those of the men with whom he had to deal. What piqued Comte d’Affry was an underlined sentence in a letter which St. Germain wrote to Mme de Pompadour. (I have heard it from those who have seen it).... I have only to account for my conduct to God and my Sovereign ... as to what goes on in my house ... the people I see an admit, of these I need give no account. For thirty years I have been a member of the Nobility and I am known never to have mixed with adventurers or im postors, or to have received scoundrels. M. de St. Germain came here with very good recommendations, I saw him because I liked his company and conversation; he is an agreeable and polite man whose conversation is amusing and varied; one can see at a glance that he has been brought up in the very best Society; true I do not know who he is, but the Comte d’Affry told me that his Most Christian Majesty knows; ... that is enough for me! Should M. de St. Germain return to the Hague I shall again see him, unless th e States of Holland forbid it or unless I become convinced myself that he does not merit admittance to my house. April 25 th , 1760. I have been told that St. Germain was at Dijon and lived there very sumptuously. The Comte de Tavannes, the Governor, wrote to the Court enquiring what policy to pursue with regard to him ... as he “did not know who he was.” ... He got the reply hat he was to show the Comte de St. Germain all the consideration due to a man of his position, and to permit him to live in his own fashi on.

April, 1760. I have been told that Rhoon (Bentinck) had despicable relations with the E nglish, amongst whom there was a certain Paymaster named Nugent, although the Comte de St. Germain, who is away at present, considered him well disposed towards France. May, 1760. Doublet told me the following, declaring he had heard it from Hompesch: ... “ that Rhoon had several secret interviews with the so - called Comte de St. Germain, after which the Comte de St. Germain called on the French Ambassador telling him that Rhoon was not as friendly disposed towards England as was believed; that he (St. Germain ) had written to France to this effect and that this being so, such an influential man should be made use of.” D’Affry finally answered the repeated entreaties of the Comte de St. Germain by saying that he “knew the Sieur Rhoon well; who, being dependent o n England as he was, could not render services of any value to France.” He (d’Affry) consequently requested him (St. Germain) no long to frequent his house. Upon this followed the demand of France for the arrest of the Comte de St. Germain. He was however warned and left ... in a carriage with one of Rhoon’s servants, armed with a passport which Rhoon had procured him, by the help of the Minister Yorke. The latter, however, would only give it in “blank,” and Rhoon filled in the name himself, repeatedly saying that the move on the part of France was nothing but “Court intrigue.” March 20 th , 1762. I have been told that the so - called Comte de St. Germain has now taken up his residence at UBBERGEN near NIMEGUE; that he also owns some landed property near Zutphen; that he has a huge laboratory in his house in which he shuts himself up for whole days at a time; that he knows how to bestow the most lovely colours imaginable on things, for instance on leather, etc.; that he is a great philosopher and lover of Nature; a fine conversationalist; that he seems to be virtuous; that he looks much like a Spaniard of high birth; that he speaks with much feeling of Madmae his late mother; that he sometimes signs himself “prince d’Es.” ...; that he is proud that he is desirous of encouraging Manufactures in the Republic, but that it is not his intention to favour any one town or Province, in spite of the fact that Amsterdam has already made advantageous offers to him on condition that other places should be excluded; that he has re ndered great services to Gronsveld by helping him to prepare the colours for his China Factory in Weesp; that he is on the best of terms with Rhoon, on whom he often calls and with whom he corresponds; that he has besides an enormous correspondence with fo reign countries; that he is known at every Court; that the late Prince of Wales (who was a despicable character) treat him very badly, but that he (St. Germain) being innocent was again set free and rehabilitated; that he corresponds with most important pe ople in France; that he speaks very highly of Mme de Pompadour, etc. He often goes to Amsterdam, where he has called several times on G.

My Lord, I received this afternoon by Blackmore, the messenger, the honour of your Lordship’s secret letter of the 21 st instant; it is unnecessary perhaps for me to say that His Majesty’s gracious approbation of my conduct, in my conversation with Comte de St. Germain, was a great consolation to me, and I return your Lordship my humble thanks for the early information you have been so good as to give me of it, for you will easily imagine some anxiety must attend the touching upon such delicate points.

I shall not fail to explain very clearly what your Lordship prescribes, and endeavor to bring him still closer to the point than I thought it decent to insist upon before I knew His Majesty’s sentiments; of all that passes your Lordsh ip shall be immediately informed, and in the meanwhile I have the honour to Remain with the greatest respect.... JOSEPH YORKE. Hon. Gen. Yorke. (Secret.) Whitehall, March 28 th , 1760. Sir, His Majesty is of opinion, as well from the tenor of your several let ters, as by other advices that the Duc de Choiseul is the least inclined to pacific measures of any of those who are in credit at the Court of Versailles; and this in consequence of his predilection for the alliance of the House of Austria; but that findin g the pacific party too prevalent to be openly withstood, he has acquiesced in authorizing Mr. D’Affry to talk in the manner he has done, in order, at least, to have a share in the negotiation for peace, if that measure shall ultimately be determined, or t o delay of disappoint the measure itself, which he has"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 104 endeavored to do, by naming a erson whom he amagined could not be accepted here, and by even delaying the departure of that person, till the arrival of Mr. De Fuentes, which cannot be in less than two months. But notwithstanding the notion which is entertained of Mons. de Choiseul’s intentions, the King thinks it proper that the overture made by Mr. D’Affry should not be discouraged, but that pretty much the same answer should be returned to him as has already been given to Mr. St. Germain, as you will observe by my other letter of this date, there being no other difference but what relates to the new hint thrown out by Mr. D’Affry, of sending a person to London. You will observe, the King has no objecti on to it, if a proper person is chosen, but His Majesty is determined not to receive one of his own subjects in quality of negotiator from France, and of all others, Mr. Dunn would be the most unfit for such a commission, and most obnoxious here. The prece dent of Mr. Wall is not analogous to the present case; but were it so, His Majesty would still be at liberty to make this exception. It still appears to His Majesty probable enough that Count St. Germain was authorized to talk to you in the manner he has d one, and that his commission is unknown to the Duc de Choiseul: but as that minister will, in all likelihood, communicate the answer returned to Mr. D’Affry to a formal proposal, made, by order of his Court, to those persons who have employed St. Germain, His Majesty thought proper that there should be an exact uniformity in the answers given to both; as it as not the King’s intention to neglect either of these channels, you will therefore seek the earliest opportunity of having an interview with Mr. D’Affr y; and as my other letter is wrote in an ostensible manner, you may read it all to him, and even suffer him to take a note of what is underlined in it. To the Earl of Holderness. (secret)  The Hague, March 28 th , 17 60. My Lord, Count St. Germain came to me yesterday morning in consequence of my having acquainted him of my being desirous to speak to him; I was very free in explaining to him the impossibility there was of entering any farther into conversation with hi m, without he could produce an authentic authority from, or in the name of, His Most Christian Majesty, for negotiating upon the affair, which had made the subject of our last conversation. I told him that I was avowed and he was not, and therefore all he said might be disavowed at once; whilst what came from me would bear the respectable mark of the character the King honored me with. I was as strong as possible upon this point, by way of introduction to the communication I had leave to make to him, by the orders contained in your Lordship’s secret letter of the 21 st inst.; and added that, though it was evident there was more than one opinion at the Court of France, yet, we could not treat with different persons, some of whom were authorized and some not: t hat, as he knew the public step the King had made, in opening a congress to His generosity His Majesty had showed in permitting me to enter into Pourparlers with M. d’Affry, it was needless to expatiate upon the inutility and impropriety of farther measure s on our part, if he did not meet with a proper return. Having premised this, I told him that out of regard to the person whose letters he had communicated to me formerly, and from conviction that he was sincere in desiring to advance so salutary a work, I had the King’s permission to communicate to him His Majesty’s further sentiments about a reconciliation with the Court of France: which ought"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" 105 to convince every well - meaning person how sincere and how pure His Majesty’s sentiments are. I accordingly commun icated to him your Lordship’s dispatch, and at his desire permitted him to minute down the latter part of it: It is therefore His Majesty’s pleasure, to the end. Thus as we went in consequence of my orders; but as an incident had happened since my last let ter in relation to Court St. Germain, which M. d’Affry (who knows nothing as yet of his conversation with me) had talked of very freely, I was desirous to know how he told the story, which is as follows: On Sunday, M. d’Affry received a courier from the Du c de Choiseul, with nothing from the Court of France, that he (d’Affry) should let him know, that he should not frequent his house and even forbid him to come there. This M. d’Affry acquainted St. Germain with, on Wednesday, upon his waiting upon him in th e name of the French King; but upon the latter’s desiring to see the most Christian Majesty, M. d’Affry retracted that part and said it was not absolutely from the King, but from the Duc de Choiseul, as Secretary for Foreign Affairs. This was accompanied w ith great protestations of regard, and at the same time, a desire to have some further conversation with him the next day, which St. Germain declined, as unwilling to expose the Ambassador to any second breach of orders, which he had already broke thro’, b y letting him in. M. d’Affry let drop, that this order was occasioned by a letter St. Germain had wrote to Mme de Pompadour, which as he phrased it, lui avait fait une diable d’afaire a Versailles, tho’ he denied knowing anything of the contents of the let ter. St. Germain appealed to the proofs he had given him upon his arrival, of his not being unavowed, declared his being perfectly easy about the effect of any letter he had wrote, and in a manner set the Ambassador at defiance, and took leave of him abrup tly; notwithstanding which M. d’Affry sent after him again yesterday, and express his uneasiness at not having seen him, fearing he might be indisposed; whether he has been there since, I don’t know. This new episode in the romance of Count St. Germain did not much surprise me, nor should I wonder, tho’ he pretends to fear nothing, if some time or other a powerful French Minister puts a stop to his traveling. I was, however, curious to know what he proposed to do, in consequence of it, and in what manner to proceed, in the business he had undertaken. Here I think, for the first time, I caught him wavering a little: whether that proceeded from any apprehension of the Duc de Choiseul’s resentment, or from what he pretends, the indifference for business on the part of the French King, and the indecision of the Lady, I won’t pretend to say: but I found him in some doubt, whether he should not work, to bring the Duc de Choiseul himself, with the system he supposed to be reveled in the breasts of those in whose nam es he speaks. It was not my business to lead him in such an affair, and therefore I only threw out that that seemed to me a delicate affair at distance, and might embarrass those who protected him. I pushed him after that to inform me in what manner he int ended to make use of what I had leave to show him, and whether he intended to go himself to Versailles. This he declined for the present, as he said, he might be sent back again immediately, and should only give more umbrage; but he would send a servant of his with three letters, one to marshal Belleisle, one to Mme de Pompadour, and a third to the Comte de Clermont, Prince of the Blood, whom he mentioned for the first time, as his intimate friend, and as one, who had the French King’s confidence, independe ntly of his ministers, and who was a fast friend to the coming to an immediate accommodation with England. To remove all"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" 106 suspicion of his deceiving me, he did, in reality, produce a letter from the two last mentioned persons he made no doubt of receiving a nswers; from Mme de pompadour, he did not, he said, expect it, because it was a maxim with her, not to write upon state affairs, tho’ it was absolutely necessary to inform her, that he was strengthened, and able to work on her side. All this is very plausi ble, but the effect is still to be proved. In the meantime, it is plain, that these French ministers counteract each other, and consequently are in different systems; which is to prevail, don’t depend upon us, but it can’t be detrimental to His Majesty’s s ervice, that his sentiments should be known to the Court of France, by any channel they think fit to receive them thro’. M. d’Affry’s compliments, after his acquainting St. Germain with the Duc de Choiseul’s orders, are as extraordinary as the rest, especi ally as he knows very well his connxion with marshal Belleisle, and had seen the French King’s passport to him. All this mystery will be unveiled by degrees, and I shan’t fail to inform your Lordship of the further lights I can collect; I let Mr. St. Germa in know that he or any other person, duly authorized, was equal in England, the chief objection we had at present, and what stopt the whole, was the want of a proper and sufficient credential ...   JOSEP H YORKE. To the Earl of Holderness. (Secret)  The Hague, April 8 th , 1760. My Lord, It is rather to show my attention to all the material letters your Lordship honored me with, on the 28 th past, than from anything very particular I have to tro uble you with, that I take the liberty to acknowledge by themselves the honor of your Lordship’s secret letters of that date, and of the 1 st instant. I must acquaint you, however, that I spoke very plainly to Mr. D’Affry upon the subject of Mr. Dunn ... and explained to him in the strongest and fullest manner why it would be impossible to receive him as a negotiator from the Court of France. I must do the French Ambassador the justice to say, that he entered into the reasons alleged, but endeavored to persuad e me that the Duc de Choiseul could not mean to propose a man, whom he had not conceived a good opinion of; but that he hoped upon the representations he should now make to him, in form, that that would be waived. Mr. St. Germain is still at the Hague, but has not as yet produced anything new from France, and it is highly probable that after the noise his first letters made nobody will care to risk a direct correspondence with him, which may cross the Duc de Choiseul’s measures; Mr. D’Affry pretends that th at French Minister is desirous of Peace, because His Most Christian Majesty is, and that it is serving his Master according to his wishes. Indeed, the reserve the French Ambassador observes towards the Ministers of their Allies here, the awkward uneasiness he shewed lest they should know we had met, and several expressions he let drop about them and their Courts, would incline me to think, that Peace is the object of France, and that the pacific party is the most prevalent: but for the proof of that we must wait for the answer to the Communication I have just made, which is so fair and so confidential, that if they don’t come into it, there cannot remain the least doubt hereafter of their determination to try the fate of the Campaign."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" 107 I am infinitely oblige d to your Lordship for encouraging me with the assurance of His Majesty’s approbation of my conduct, and I humbly recommend myself to the indulgence of His Majesty and of His Servants, in the course of this delicate affair ... JOSPH YORKE. From Mr. Mitchell to Lord Holdernesse. Head Quarters at Freyburg. Thursday, March 27 th , 1760. My Lord, Twice I had the honor of your Lordship’s Courier of the 4 th by Badmore, and of the 14 th by a Prussian Courier; I have communicated the same to His Prussian Majesty’s f riendship, and unreserved confidence. He said he would follow the King’s example ... The King of Prussia thinks, that nothing certain can be concluded from all that has passed between Gen. Yorke and the French Ambassador, to the 4 th inst., but he added he wa s in daily expectation of hearing something from France, that might be depended upon; that he already had had accounts, that the person sent from the Court of Gotha had been well received: that the Bailli de Froulay, immediately upon reading his letter, we nt to Versailles; and that he had promised to the emissary, to procure him a permission for sending of expresses and couriers and passports for himself to return, when it should be thought proper: he concluded with saying that so soon as he had any certain notice of what was passing at Paris, he would send a courier directly to England. The King of Prussia was pleased then to give me some account of a most extraordinary conversation, which Count St. Germain had had with General Yorke, on the 15 th , at the Ha gue, the particulars of which need not be mentioned, as your Lordship will have them more authentically: he observed that though the manners were of the most uncommon kind, yet Gen. Yorke had done ... to give your Lordship an immediate account of what had pa ssed, that it was very probable the Vount may have been employed in this secret commission by the marshal Belleisle, without the knowledge of the other French Ministers as the Cabinet is extremely divided. He asked me if I was acquainted with this St. Germ ain, who, as he was informed, had been some time in England. I answered that he heard the Count had found a way to insinuate himself into the good graces of the French King, whom he had amused with some experiments in Chemistry, and that the French King ha d made him a present of the Chateau de Chambord. 1 A. Mitchell. Letter from Mr. Mitchell to Lord Holdernesse. Freyburg, April 9 th , 1760 My Lord, His Prussian Majesty mentioned me a letter from Monsieur de Bouille, lately intercepted, in which that minister says that the French Court are inclined to peace; that the disputes in Canada will be settled to the liking of the England; to whom, likewise, Minorca will be restored, and Cape Breton to the French, but he hesitates much about the cession of Guadeloupe. He also said that Count d’Affry had, by order of the Duc de Choiseul, disavowed to the allied ministers, everything that Count St. Germain had said to General Yorke; and that the Court of Vienna, at the solicitation of the French Ambassador, had at last co nsented to send Ministers to the congress; but Kaunitz hinted they should be empowered to do nothing.   1 Compare with Appendix I"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" 108 A.

The courier of M. de Reischach has at l ast returned, but he has not brought the answer so anxiously expected. This minister must receive his orders fro the Count de Stahremberg at Paris, just like the Count de Beschicheff. These gentlemen expect to receive them in two or three days. So we shall soon see what will be the end of this great affair. It is singular that we cannot ascertain whether England will really send a body of troops to Germany, and of what strength it will be. It is said that the King of Prussia and Prince Ferdinand earnestly r equest this transport, but they are not hurrying themselves about it in London. We have here a very singular man. It is the celebrated Count de St. Germain, known throughout Europe for his learning and his immense wealth. He is charged with an important co mmission in this country, and he talks much of saving France by different means from those formerly used by the famous Maid of Orleans. We must see how he will set about it. He has a store of precious stones of the greatest beauty. He claims to have snatch ed fro Nature her highest secrets and to know her throughout. But the most curious thing is that he is said to be over 110 years of age; he looks, however, not more than 45. Gaudeant bene nati. I wish I could get at his secret for your benefit, monsieur, a nd for my own also! He is a warm supporter of Mme de pompadour and of the marshal de Belleisle; and he detests the to brothers Paris, to whom he attributes all the misfortunes of France. He talks very freely of all that concerns this kingdom — from king to c lown. The letters from Germany have brought us nothing new. Copy of a letter from M. Kauderbach. (Rec. March 25 th , 1760).

You will already have seen, monseigneur, the List of the Prussian Armies which a co urier has brought to London, and which has also been communicated to M. Verelat at Berlin. The King of Prussia at the same time offers to verify its reality by causing a review of these force to be held before Mr. Mitchell. After this offer, how can the En glish Parliament fear to throw itself headlong into the projects of His Prussian Majesty and to"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 110 support him vigorously until his work is done and he can turn to something else? If you have read the Philosopher of Sans Souci, you will find like many other s that he keeps his foremost desires always at the bottom of his heart. This abominable work, which the Prussians extol as the masterpiece of the human intellect, has been blasted and anathematized as it deserves from the pulpits of Amsterdam, and has caus ed many enthusiasts to open their eyes to the fine principles of their Gideon. Others carry their blindness to the further point, and persist in looking on this production as a forgery by his enemies. We are still awaiting the famous Reply, of which, it is said, and the only difficulty lies with France. M. d’Affry received a courier on Thursday, but he says not a word of what he brought. It would seem that he is waiting for something before sending him back, for he still retains him here. I spoke to you in a former letter, monseigneur, of the famous St. Germain, who is at this moment in Amsterdam, where he is staying with Sieur Hoope. He has seem Mr. Yorke at his house and remained there three hours. He has neither sent nor applied here to M. D’Affry and yet he told myself that he was charged with an important commission. But, to tell the truth, he appears to me too presuming and too incautious to believe him to be a highly trusted negotiator. I place him in the category with the famous Macanas, whom your Exc ellency knew here in 1747, or at least in that of the Count de Sekkendorff, who came here last year. I shall be much mistaken in him if he succeeds in his commission. Our Dutchmen are too thick - skulled to indulge in refinements. However, I have no longer a ny doubt that there are important negotiations on hand ... This man told me that France would cede Guadaloupe ... if at this price she could obtain Peace; ... This would perhaps be no evil ... if England abandoned Prussia to her own forces ... what do you think abou t it? ... M. Wassemar informs me that the Count de Bristo. Has had a long audience of the King of Spain, immediately after which he dispatched a courier. All else is matter of speculation. Germany offers me nothing interest to communicate, except the cruel a nd ceaseless sufferings of unhappy Saxony. The Prussians loudly declare that they will make it a desert. May God have mercy on this poor country. Extract from the letter of Prince de Galitzin. (Rec. March 25 th , 1760.) London, March 25 th , 1760. To M. de Kau derbach.

This singular man as been staying for some time in this country, and I do not know whether he likes it. there is someone here with whom he appears to be in correspondence, and this person declare s that the object of the Count’s journey to Holland is merely some financial business.

(Rec. March 31 st , 1760.) (Decyphered> The Hague , March 28 th , 1760. To Prince Galitzin, People here are talking more than ever of a private negotiation between England and France, and if one could judge by appearances one would be tempted to believe these reports had some foundation. I know for a certai nty that Messrs. d’Affry and Yorke, after taking different route in order to meet at the Bois, did effect an interview there. I know further that they have had a second similar meeting on the Ryswick Road. I leave you to judge what may be the reason for th is affectation of conferring in public, and which of the two is most to the point. The Prussians here say loudly that if the two Empresses do not lend themselves to Peace, France will go her own way. I hope that this may be only presumption on their part. M. de Reichach says “fear nothing” and he is sure of the harmony that reigns between his Court and France; but I am not so easy as he is. I have spoken to you of the Comte de St. Germain, who is here just now. M. d’Affry, after receiving him at his house w here I have seen him in the best society, has just forbidden him the house, by order of his Court, and he has made this known to us. M. de ST. Germain says that this order comes from M. de Choiseul, that he is reproached with having meddled with the affair s of the Peace, and that in fact he has made a report to Marshal Belleisle, from whom he shows letters full of confidence, of certain dispositions which he discovered in a conversation with M. Yorke; that he also made it known that M. d’Affry was too negle ctful of a certain person of rank here, who appeared very well disposed. Indeed this story will make a sensation. It is certain that M. St. Germain has a passport signed by the King of France, which is very honourable to him, and in which mention is made o f his mission to Holland. It is also sure that he was charged with a commission the result of which M. de Belleisle awaited with keen impatience, as is shown by one of his letters. Mme de Pompadour, of whom M. de St. Germain is a great apologist, is also m ixed up with it. But it is better that I should not mix myself up with these stories. Your Excellency will see by the Leyden Gazette that the King of Prussia has, for urgent cause, just withdrawn the commissions of the Shipowners of Emden. That means somet hing. The Swedish Minister here has told me that in England they have set completely at liberty, with an indemnification of a thousand pounds, a Swedish vessel captured by a Prussian armateur, and that the latter has been declared a privateer. I add to thi s some remarkable writings of the philosopher of Sans Souci, and you will see that judgment is passed upon them in Switzerland. They have just accorded a kind of approbation to this book in Berlin, where it is to be reprinted by authority. It will be appla uded by miscreants, but abhorred by all honest people, and the Supreme Being who is infamously outraged in it, will one day confound the impiety of its author and of those who give him their plaudits.

This latest production of his perverse mind is worthy of his odious sentiments. I shall be greatly obliged to you, monsieur, if you will kindly send me some time the whole of this book. I am not astonished that on the complaint of the Count de Galofkin the sale of this wretched book has been prohibited, but I am very much so that ... dares to announce publicly the printing of such blasphemy; and it seems to me that he may be made to repent of his boldness. I am utterly i gnorant of what foundation there is for speaking, with you, of a private negotiation between England and France. Here, we do not hear the slightest hint of such as thing, and if it were so, I should have been able to learn something of it. those promenades spoken of in the Bois and at Reswyk do not appear of sufficient consequence to make one credit such remours, telling at most only of presumption on one side and of imprudence on the other. Nevertheless, perfectly innocent as this conduct may be, it is, I venture to say, very much out of place under present circumstances. Still less can one approve of this eager and confident affectation of insinuating to the same persons that it is only owing to a certain court that a certain Reply, so much wished for, doe s not arrive. Insinuations of this kind, being all reported here, cannot remain unknown to the persons interested. As to the language of the Prussians, it is well to pay no attention to it, and so all that they say about the two Empresses and France regard ing the peace, is unworthy of consideration. All the world is equally anxious to conclude a peace, but a peace stale and honorable. The behaviour of the Count d’Affry by order of his court towards the Count de St. Germain who has emancipated himself from w ishing to meddle with the affairs of the peace without the concurrence and participation of all the allied courts, sufficiently proved the falsity of the rumours which are current with you of a private negotiation, of which I have just spoken above. M. de St. Germain has everywhere been treated on the footing of an illustrious adventurer. Here, owing to his imprudence and his unguarded behaviour, he had been taken for a spy and treated accordingly. As for me, I, like yourself, think him somewhat of a fool. You, monsieur, have better means than I have f knowing the truth of the article in the Leyden Gazette that you have sent me concerning His Majesty the King of Prussia, who has just withdrawn their commissions from the ship - owners of Emden. All that I know about it is that the Baron de Kniphausen formerly gave these commissions from the King his master to all the English who wished to sail over the seas under the Prussian flag. Commissions of this kind were sold here by an Englishman, who was no longer of a mind to make use of them himself, to another. One may easily guess what disorder these kinds of venality would produce. I do not know whether it was owing to the representations of certain courts, which you will easily guess and of which the Swedish minist er ought no longer to be ignorant, or that justice alone has had the principal share in it, that these great abuses and disorders have been mentioned to M. de Kniphausen, who has withdrawn several of these commissions of the King his master, and if not all of them as yet, it is to be believed that, the above - mentioned Leyden Gazette showing the true mind of His Prussian majesty on this matter, the remainder of these instruments of pillage will be withdrawn forthwith."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 113 M. de Kniphausen yesterday received a co urier from the king his master, but up to the present he seems disposed to keep the contents of the present he seems disposed to keep the contents of the dispatch to himself.

Copy of the letter of Mr. Cornet to the Count de Haslang."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" 114 The Hague, April 29 th , 1760. A foreigner who calls himself the Comte de St. Germain, whose origin and native country no one knows, but who is said to be extremely rich and very well received at different Courts in Europe, especially at that of France, after a residence of about three months which he has made here, has just disappeared when it was least expected. He has been intimately connected with the French Ambassador though he has been assiduous in seeing the Anglo - Prussian Ministers and partisans. Then, he has confided to some persons of distinction his correspondence with the Marshal Duc de Belleisle, who according to him was inclined to the re - establishment of peace between France and England, which he had in his pocket. The Count d’Affry made this known to the Duc de Choiseul who commanded him to see him no more and to threaten him with the Bastille if he continued t o use such a language. The ambassador having given him this message in writing, the Count de St. Germain said publicly some days after that this minister had made enquiries about his health, that he had been extremely anxious about it and that he begged hi m to come and see him, the sooner the better; but that he had excused himself, on the pretext that having regard to orders received from his own court, he would not risk it. this contradictory conduct on the part of the ambassador is attributed to an order that had come to him from the Duc de Belleisle, and is regarded as a clear proof of the little unanimity reigning between the two French Secretaries of State. However that may be, the Count de St. Germain continued to say that what he had asserted was exa ct truth. On a second report that the Count d’Affry made on this to his Court, he was commanded to have him arrested and to demand his extradition to the King his master; getting wind of which, M. de St. Germain departed first for Helvoet Sluys. As we know that the Count was in the good graces of the King and in regular correspondence with the Duc de Belleisle, people are generally persuaded that he was charged with some commission, and that his disgrace was caused either by his indiscretion, or by the want of union which is said to exist in the French ministry.
