The Pyramidal Capstone of Light coordinating the Victory of \" The Scriptures of Light Beloved- The Father's Limitless Light is being poured forth and our Tree of Life is being activated. Love from the highest levels is penetrating the plan - etary veils. From the higher worlds without limit or end, the emissaries of Light come in vast numbers to advance the foundations of life and refashion new worlds. They bring with them Light which is greater than a thousand suns to awaken our next stage of evolution and to assist in bringing us into a purer form of superluminal Light. We have been living within the Son universe of His creation and we have experienced our realm within the Living Word. Now we must open to the recognition that we are to transform this space-time vessel into the greater Universe of the Spirit of His Love. Graduation is upon us and with it comes a new sense of Oneness with the myriad worlds of our Father's House of Many Mansions. Through this new synthesis, space and time are conquered and we are ordained to put on the Similitude that goes with the Divine Image. Truly before we can physically advance, we must consciously advance through thought - forms which are as firing torches of creativity con - necting the two dwelling temples of spirit within our brain. The \" living flame geometries \" of color and sound within The Keys open the \" mind locks \" of consciousness for the Divine Mind to be seeded directly within our innermost mind so we can begin to think in divine pictures which trace and compose many scenarios of creation. Through this non - linear cosmic language, our consciousness is ex - panded to communicate on different levels of reality - activating within our mind and our being a higher perceptual level of communication. This is the opening to the higher Divine Mind which works as a continu - ous revelatory process through a universal media which transcends the written and spoken word and works with the living Word which emanates as a plural-dimensional hologram of the Many Worlds. This higher revealed Wisdom opens the seven seals (in the Western tradition) or the seven chakras (in the Eastern tradition) through a pro- cess of breathings (intonation of sacred sounds), visualizations (fusion of many levels), and projection (going beyond the chemical construct of memory). The Seven Seals open simultaneously linking us with the cos - mic \" Tree of Life \" . Beyond the circuitries of our body and mind, we enter the higher dimensions of thought-form creativity and operate as One with the Eter - nal Mind of the I AM. For this reason, the Keys are to be experienced simultaneously on all seven levels of form and Divine Form - from the subatomic, molecular, genetic, mathematical, musical, paraphysical and the superluminal aspects of the revealing nature of the Shekinah."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Shekinah (Divine) Presence, the feminine aspects of the Godhead, exists in all creative orderings of all dimensions, and is the Power through which we are respatialized to partake of the \" virgin birth \" of our embyro godself. This is the \" Age of the Holy Spirit \" - where the Bride and Creator become one, creating a new peoplehood of trinitized powers who are the \" bearers \" of a higher Christed seed unfolding life anew by virtue of this greater union that is without dualistic separation. Through the knowledge of the Keys, beloved, you will be prepared to go through the destructive fury of earthquakes, floods, storms, pesti - lence, famine, the mysteries of birth and death, change and permanence, and find your place in the universe. The messengers of the B'nai Or (Sons of Light) and the B'nai Elohim (Sons of God) are opening the Gates of Light. YHWH is stationing himself in the assembly of the Divine Ones. Help me, 0 Father, to gather the children of Abraham, Isaiah, John, Amen Ptah, Buddha, Hari, Satyasena, Krishna, and countless other Masters into the \" Office of the Christ \" so that all godly living beings, who are eternal and associated with you on different spiritual planes shall be as one in the Divine unity which shall penetrate the earth so that no man in the East and in the West dare ignore Thy Kingdom on earth as it is in heaven. We are in the midst of a change in the life code, and the experiences of the world around us in all its brilliance and eternal recurrence is pre - paring us as Sons and Daughters of Life to awaken to our own divine creative process, that has its unity in the ManIGod partnership. Let us experience God l'infini and His Work, taking chaos through its process of awakening into a divine Plan of creation by means of the Limitless Light, the Ain Soph, that extends and governs myriad expressions of life and new creations. Let us truly be one with \" the Christ \" which reveals the glory of the collective Messiahship for all humanity which is in the return of Moses, Jesus, and Elijah as they left this earth. The \" collective transfiguration \" shows that Jesus did not work by himself, but within a \" Brotherhood of Light \" which has its higher meaning, according to Enoch, in the three - fold giving of the star code of the Father's plan to the human evolution. Moses gives man the \" Torah Or, \" the blueprint of God's Kingdom on earth; Elijah demonstrates oneness with the \" Vehicle of Light \" which attaches our physical universe to other universes; Jesus shows how the body of flesh can be transfigured so that the human self and Overself body unite as the Christ body of eternal life. The story of the Christ within the spiritual Israel is to see how everyone will have a Christ Birth in the New Age where true love of the Father prevails. Let us go forward to prepare the children to walk with the luminaries proclaiming Thy presence in the healing of the sick and the anointing of the eyes to see the Living Light! Third Edition - 1987 \"Put off thy shoes from thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground\" Exodus 3:5. While I was in the act of prayer calling upon the Name of the Father, asking to know the meaning of life and for what reason I was called into the world, my room suddenly became full of a different type of light. And in the presence of this \" Light \" a great being stood before me who an - nounced that he was Master Ophanim Enoch. This being had so much Love and Light, I felt as if I were a child in the presence of this divine Master Ophanim. The being asked if I were ready to go with him into the Father's midst, and I said I was. And with that, a great field of Light was placed around my body and I sped upwards into the heavens; first into a region of stars called Merak and Muscida. And while I was in this region of the heavens, 1 was told about the earth and my temporal homeland upon the earth. I was told how those who govern the power upon the earth are those who have fallen from the higher heavens and now indwell in the stars known by earthman as Ursa Major. From this threshold gate, they control one of the major entrance points into our local system from the higher heavens. I saw how the Masters from previous cycles were cast down to these stars from which they now govern the lower planetary worlds and the karmic penalties that were assigned to each. I was shown how earth was part of a biochemical testing zone using both fallen and divine thought- forms in determining what type of intelligence could eventually free itself from the countless physical rounds of existence controlled by the fallen hierarchies inhabiting the regions of Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Polaris, and Thuban. These realms contain beings in imperfect bodies of Light who use their power to establish themselves as gods in the lower realms. And I was taken from this region of the stars into the Mid - Way station of Arcturus, the major programming center of the galactic Council serving the Father on this side of our galaxy, which is under the direction of the Council of Nine - the governing body of our local universe. There I was shown the network and the courts used by the spiritual Brotherhoods who adjucate decisions pertaining to the planets involved in our region of space. I was taken from Arcturus through a series of tessellations which seemed to be of a different \" Light \" density, where multiple saddle - shaped concen- tric fields intersected so that a threshold was formed running through the star spaces connected with Orion. My physical body at the threshold gate, had to exchange its garment of flesh for a garment of Light as I passed through the star regions served by the Brotherhoods of Light. From there I was cleared to go on into a greater paradise of Light called"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the seventh heaven. There the thresholds to this region of the sky were full of eyes and burning fires of the Elohim Masters who govern the higher dominions of power. From the burning fires, tongues of Light projected out to form Or (Light) stations. Amidst the Or stations, I saw wheels within wheels, the vehicles of the Ophanim messengers serving the lower heavens. These Ophanim messengers join other angelic orders of Light proclaiming \" Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish, Adonai 'Tsebayoth (Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord God of Hosts)! \" I was then taken by Enoch to the region known as Saiph in the great star field of Orionis; from there I was taken into the presence of the field of Light known as Mintaka. And within this field of Light I was met by a being of great Light, a being of great majesty called Metatron, the Creator of Light in the outer universe. And my spirit was so overwhelmed with the presence of the higher Light, I would not have been able to maintain my body of Light were it not for the body of Metatron. Metatron then took me into the presence of the Divine Father. And I went into His presence through the door of omega Orion which serves as a Grand Entrance to regions of pure energy emission. The presence of the Father was so rarefied that only Metatron could take me into the Pyramid of the Living Light, the Throne, where I saw the Ancient of Days face to face, with His flowing white hair and His face of overwhelming Love and Joy. No words can express the \" Eternal \" . and the sanctification of knowing that the Father called me into His presence to tell me for which reason I had left behind my toga to take up this perishable body of time to serve this planet, this pearl within the rosary of stars that are set on this edge of our consciousness time zone to glorify \" His Right Hand. \" And in His presence of Light I proclaimed, \"Thou art worthy, 0 Lord YHWH to receive glory and honor and power, for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure the reons were created. \" And in the presence of His Throne of Light, I bowed my head, as I saw the Twenty - Four El - ders of Light who were around and about His Throne, singing praises of \" Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish, Adonai 'Tsebayoth! \" I also saw on the Right Hand of the Father, Christ Jesus. And Metatron told me that these Lords of Light are worthy to sit in the presence of the Father, for they choose periodically to leave His presence and go out and create other worlds of Light, known as the worlds of the Elohim. Before the Throne of the Father I was told of my work, as being part of Enoch, to serve the universes of the Paradise Sons, who in turn form the Councils of Light that receive commandments of Light and ordinances of fire projection from the Twenty - Four Elders of Light to create new uni - verses. And I was told by my guides, Enoch and Metatron, that I was not to eat the food of the false powers of the earth, nor encourage my seed to marry with the fallen spiritual races of the earth, nor join in false worship of those who serve the fallen mind energies of the earth. But my reason for being was to exalt the Father so that all knees should bend and that all heads should acknowledge the \" time is at hand \" for the externalization of . . . the Father's Hierarchy, so that His Kingdom will come on earth as it is in heaven. I was taken to many other regions and instructed in the revelation of , how the many mansions of the Father were opening to the birth of a new heavens and a new earth. While I was before the Throne, I saw a burning scroll rolled as a cylin - der and out of this burning scroll a Light was projected into my third eye which imprinted the scenario abstracts that contained the Keys that are to be used for the marriage of the Bride and the Bridegroom. The Keys reveal the overlap between the higher evolution and the human evolution as man is taken through his Alpha and Omega. These scenario abstracts were pro - jected in glowing geometries of Light which are part of the fire letters used to transcribe knowledge from Father universe to Son universe to Shekinah universe, in connecting one eternity of time with another eternity of time. I was shown how the Mysteries of the Father's House of Many Man - sions allowed for infinite myriads of creation to proceed out of the Father's inexpressible Love, linking all manner of specie creation with the Infinite Way. Thus, many Mysteries of the Father's Kingdom were revealed to me, including the nature of the Office of the Christ, the history of the Brother - hoods upon this planet, the reason why the true teachings of YHWH were encoded into a language of Light, the orders and dominions of the galactic Councils, the return of the Messiah, and the transplanting of the Christ seed beyond the threshold of Alpha and Omega. I was told to compose a scroll on parchment from the divine scroll of Light that was coded into me. And this scroll is the 64 Keys of Enoch, ex - plaining how the Seven Seals of the Book of Revelation will be broken as all measures of science from the biophysical to the astrophysical are at - tuned to a new spiritual revelation in the name of Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh, I AM that I AM. This scroll is to bring forth a new cosmology of conscious - ness in explaining how the Brotherhoods of Light will work with members of the human Race who can accept the promise of New Life in the myriad other universes. The Keys, thus, are to exemplify both the spiritual under - standing and the scientific understanding that must converge if the right reality structure is to be shared by members of the human Race in taking a quantum leap forward into the New Age. The purpose of this teaching is to open people's minds to new ideas, in - viting you to share in the experience of the education of the soul. As your soul is advanced, you become a part of the joyous participation and share in the 'inner peace' of the great unification of the 'First Supper' now taking place between the Brotherhood of Man and the greater universal intelli - gence - the Brotherhoods of Light. In the education of the soul, it is necessary to receive the Wisdom derived from the higher worlds which unites your bodies of Light and provides the foundation for your creative experience. This Wisdom reveals how we can share in both a higher world of Light and this physical world of 'reality'. This teaching is to make you aware of the Divine Light worlds within and without, allowing you to co - participate with the many worlds of intel-"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ligence that are part of your collective birthright. You are to see how life's blueprint has already existed in worlds prior to material creation, and to understand how a timeless blueprint was coded into this body of temporal consciousness so that your body can put on other garments of God's crea - tive work through multiple bodies of Divine Love. These are the 64 Keys that were shown to me by Enoch and Metatron, to unite the nations for the coming of the Melchizedek Brotherhood and to make ready the final preparation for the descent of the 144,000 Ascended Masters who will redeem the meek and righteous of the earth for the new life stations of universal intelligence in the higher Kingdoms of the Father. In the presence of Metatron, the Unity of Days, and YHWH, the Ancient of Days, I was told how the scroll of Enoch was to be divided into three portions which deal with the three major divisions of universes - Father universes, Son universes, and Shekinah universes. The Keys to Father universes are to explain how the Mansion worlds of the Father are connected to the Divine Creators, creating new universes through cosmic pyramids of Light. The Keys to Son universes explain how the biological codes of the Christ Race are to evolve into the image determined by the Father through the Paradise Sons and not through the lesser forces of Light. The Keys to Shekinah universes explain how the spiritual gifts of the Holy Spirit will be given to the Christ Race so spiritual Man can work di - rectly with \" whole Light beings \" - the angelic messengers who will pre - pare the righteous of the earth for the Council of Light which will be es - tablished upon the earth at the time of the new heavens and the new earth. All three divisions are served by the Brotherhoods of Light under the di - rection of the Brotherhood of Michael, the Brotherhood of Enoch, and the Brotherhood of Melchizedek, which direct the seventy Brotherhoods of the Great White Brotherhood. The seventy Brotherhoods serve as a field of in - telligence in the repairing of the universes so that they can evolve into the infinite wisdom and glory of the Eternal Mind of YHWH. The Keys are encoded in fire letters having the sacred \"Yod\" over each letter so that a new spectrum of Light can biochemically respatialize you by activating the chemistry in your mind to participate on the many planes of the Word of God. The spiritual child of God has a Christed Overself Body of Light. And when the spectrum of the Word of God activates your body to participate in many dimensions simultaneously, your Christed Overself fulfills the words of Revelation: \" Happy are those who wash their robes, that the authority to go to the trees of life (plural) can be theirs and that they may gain entrance into the city by its gates. \" These will be the righteous who will inherit the many galactic trees on the other side of our Alpha and Omega. And when this cycle is completed the righteous will participate in new worlds and recognize all the manifes - tations of the Father universe, the \" Living Universe \" behind all living uni - verses, behind all the Ascended Masters of Light and all the Brotherhoods of Light. And with that vision I was returned to this world to write the words of the 64 Keys of Light set forth in this book of knowledge, delivered unto me in this consciousness time zone by Ophanim Enoch and by Metatron to be vouchsafed unto the saints and delivered to the children of Light in the name of May the Kingdom of the Living Light come quickly. Why were the Keys given at t hi s time? Enoch and Metatron have manifested this Revelation so as to prepare mankind for the quantum changes affecting every level of intelligence upon this planet. We now have the opportunity to collectively move into another system of creation. Therefore, this teaching has been given in the form of Keys to help coordinate sixty - four unique areas of scientific knowledge which are to be simultaneously advanced. The Keys have been given to as - sist all of the basic scientific disciplines to make a quantum leap forward into the new consciousness of Light. Since these teachings are applicable to the various sciences, not everyone will comprehend all of the Keys equally, nor will the full complexity of each Key be fully meaningful at the present time of our participation within the Infinite Way. Therefore, not all the Keys will appeal to the same type of scientific and consciousness evolution because they work on vari - ous levels of understanding and are connected with the totality of knowing \" the Light \" - the primary frequency of the Infinite Mind. Each of the sixty - four areas of science are to be given prophetic insight which will allow humanity to increase its understanding and raise its con - sciousness to participate with other worlds of Light. Thus, the Keys are to focus scientific research on the planet, with respect to the larger blueprint of life. However, the Keys also demonstrate that science by itself does not pos - sess all the answers; we now need to interrelate to the greater program of spiritual and scientific unity which involves the other planetary intelli - gences that share a common program of mutual scientific growth. In the final analysis, the Keys show that there is no end to science, but that we are going through a series of consciousness lives showing us how to evolve and share with each other forever in the unfoldment of the Infinite Mind into the Infinite Way. There will be a tremendous acceleration of the physical sciences into the spiritual sciences in truly transmuting the world of material form into the Kingdom of Light. Therefore, the Keys are being given to the builders of the consciousness frontiers of both physical science and spiritual science who place the needs of mankind first, and their own needs second. Enoch said that the Keys cannot be applied on an individualistic level since they are involved with the collective advancement of the human race. Enoch also told me that in order to work with the Keys, one must be able to go into the fourth dimension. The fourth dimension is \" time \" beyond conventional time. In going beyond conventional time you stand in awe of the larger universe. Here, the intellect must bow to the spiritual"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"mind in the same way life must bow to the Infinite Way which continually repatterns and regenerates creation. In connecting with the Wisdom of the Infinite Mind, the Keys demon - strate that scientific knowledge by itself does not contain all the answers to the basic questions of: Where do we come from? Why are we here? Where do we go from here? The words of the Coptic Gospel of Thomas affirm: \" Jesus said: 'If they say to you: Where do you come from? tell them: We have come from the Light, the place where the Light came into being through itself alone.. .If they say to you: What are you?, say: We are His sons, and we are the elect of the living Father. If they say to you: What is the sign of your Father?, tell them: It is a movement and a rest.' \" According to Enoch, the determinism of the earth sciences is to be subsumed into a primary plan of continual creation which is under the organization of the \" Higher Evolution. \" Through this plan of organiza - tion, Man will behold and share with 'Universal Man' - the Adam Kadmon - in the unfoldment and inter-rebirth of the Infinite Mind, the Infinite Way, and the Infinite Species. The teachings of Enoch explain how we will truly transmute this world of material form to be consistent with the structural pattern of the \" Living Light \" within the Kingdom of Light, where both Man and Higher Man can freely commingle as \" Life \" within the \" Living Light. \" Although the entity forms of Light and the garments of biological form will change - Love will continue to reign supreme as the underlying expression of the \" Living Light \" - the primary emanation of the Infinite Mind on every level of universal being. Here we are dealing not with existence and non-existence, life and death, but with a passing from one state to another, sometimes explained as a passing from one type of visibility to another; not only to the other side of the ultraviolet spectrum, but into the consciousness intelligence which has always existed and from which the derivative garments of Light have unfolded as \" many embodiments of intelligence \" into the many electromagnetic spectrums. Enoch said that the Keys were not simply for this planet, but were given in preparation for our work upon other planets in keeping with the greater harmony of science and spiritual truths, within the manifes - tation of the \" Living Light. \" Thus, Enoch's teaching is to help the col - lective body of intelligence use its ability to work on many levels of intelligence \" within \" and \" outside \" three-dimensional creation, so that the Divine Intelligence might be felt within all things. Therefore, the Keys are the interconnection for the great transformation. Give ear to His voice calling loud over land and sea, from space, and space be y ond space, announcing to all mankind the advent of quantum change and transition through His Spirit of Revelation - a Revelation through the agency of which the Tongue of Fire is now proclaiming: lo, the sacred pledge has been fulfilled, and the Promised Spirit - the Holy Spirit Shekinah, shaping the Sons and Daughters of God, has come! And in working with the Light, use the gifts of the Holy Spirit Shekinah that can be directly manifested wherever you are, for the Holy Spirit is the key to the Book of Knowledge. The Keys of Enoch and Metatron are also to form the focus for the unifi- cation of the spiritual traditions throughout the world so that they will come together in the Father's Plan. The multitude of Offices of the Ancient of Days, the Recent of Days and the Future of Days have cooperated for the externalization of the Hierarchy which will manifest in multiple orders from the Hyos Ha Koidesh. This is the time to activate the \" messiahship within. \" The outpouring of His Love will provide the Divine experience, wherein we can grasp the Light which overcomes all \" illusion \" of separation. As spoken of in The Kitab-i-iqbn from the teachings of Bahh'u'llah: \" All prophets of God, His well - favored, His holy and chosen messengers are, without exception, the bearers of His Names, and the embodiments of His at - tributes. \" Let Jew understand the mystery of Jesus, and Gentile the mystery of Moses, and may the glory that you derive from Buddha, Krishna, Hari, Amen- Ptah, and the Paradise Trinity of Moses-Jesus - Elijah be dedicated to the Father from Whom all Glory manifests. For these are His Sons; they are the reflections of His Light. They are but manifestations of the One who is the Source of all Invisibles, and who will resolve the mystery of why a Jesus, why a Moses, why the Merkabah of Elijah manifested for the benefit of Man. The whole Light beings will mark the next stage of the quantum transition Man will go through, so that Man will not only be able to exchange \" garments of consciousness \" in the reality of this world, but also exchange garments of consciousness with other planetary worlds, so that the vehicles of spiritual mankind (the Overself, the Atman, the Buddha body, the Zohar body. . .) can ascend into the Office of the Christ. Out of this transition, human society will experience those eternal truths that motivate life and impel it forward towards the next phase of the unfolding of the Eternal Mind of God, until it achieves its destined creation. How are we to use the Keys? The Keys themselves were given on January 213, 1973, to prepare man - kind for the activation of events that are to come to pass in the next thirty years of \" earth time. \" Enoch said this will be seen as the Brotherhood returning to earth to repair and resurrect humanity. Within this time frame, the preparing of the Office of the Christ and the Keys of Enoch are to precede Yahweh's Kingdom - giving sufficient knowledge for activity in the new worlds as we proceed on in His Name. The Enoch Keys were given directly to me through the Revelation of the holy scroll of burning Light - seen in Merkabah - in the threshold space of the higher spiritual Light. They were given to me beyond the confine- ment of the earth and the air regions surrounding the earth, so that they would not be contaminated by the fallen thought-forms of higher intel- ligence that influence the destructive pathways of humanity. As the Light geometries were pulsated out of the burning scroll, I was told by Enoch that the Keys were directly given as a gift of Revelation and were not to be confused with teachings transmitted through thinking computers, nor"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"through the power of channeled information. Furthermore, I was told that I was given Keys in sixty - four different areas of science which would be theoretically accepted by scientists in each of the sixty - four areas of spiritual - scientific synthesis, before the coming of the Brotherhood of Light. I was also taken and shown things related to the Keys of Enoch and Metatron to help bring out the fuller meanings of the Keys. And this is the explanation of the Keys which I have written down (to the best of my abil - ity) which is to be used as a tool for the understanding of the Keys. And, after receiving these Keys, the Merkabah appeared to me regularly, so that others would see and bear testimony to the faithfulness of the Living Word. Now as to the nature of the Keys, there is a special sequence in the or - dering of the Keys which allows them to mathematically connect with one another so as to explain the interpenetration of universes and how spiritual intelligence works directly through the interfacings and intercombinations of the Keys. I was told by Enoch to place the specific numerical codes on the ordering of the Keys which are presented as they were shown to me with the exact numerical sequences. Enoch told me the first fifty - four Keys are to be the foundation for the Ten Commandments - the ten final Keys that will give the grid systems of life and the resurrection and respatialization of the collective humanity that will proceed into the universal I AM THAT I AM. This is the Divine Unfolding of the Kingdom of Light, connecting the human evolution and the Higher Evolution in its appointed time. The final ten Keys, however, are to be given as a special scroll after the witnessing of the message of the B'nai Or, the Sons of Light, has been given to the special scientists and spiritual thinkers of this planet as a testimony of the Father's Plan being finalized by the Councils of Higher Intelligence. Enoch showed me how the last ten Keys - the Ten Com - mandments - were pyramidal grid structures of Light coordinating the dynamic vibrations, the gravitational vibrations, and the vital cycles ac - cording to the Divine Plan of YHWH. The pictures that were commissioned for the Keys give the picture of the family of \" Christ \" and the work of the Masters who, with Enoch and Metatron, reflect the true Book of Knowledge. Hence, this Book has been delivered to you in order that you may be prepared for the opening of the pyramidal grids within the foundations of change so that your own being will be prepared as the \" Adam \" upon the earth to move into the next unfolding of the Adam Kadmon, the primary Man of Light. In this transformation, the earth as part of a biochemical testing zone will allow the Love of the Father and the specie to be increased and multiplied, while some programs of consciousness will be brought to an end and decrease in the overall pattern of creation. In the preparations for studying the Keys of Enoch, in order to trigger the gifts of the Holy Spirit Shekinah, one should strive to be centered, feeling completely the Love of the Father within, avoiding the schools of thought that would sacrifice the Wisdom of God for momentary en - thusiasm and bow to a graven image, even the image of a Master. Our goal is to build the Kingdom of Light within the reality structure of this world, being ever mindful that this body of flesh will give way to a gar - ment of Light. In establishing peace and harmony with one another we are each con - tributing to the Kingdom of Light within a Father - Son - Shekinah unity of cosmoses, universes, and planetary worlds. The Light of YHWH is so vast that there is no space that it cannot enter and begin to activate even the smallest cellular structure so that it can evolve into suns of infinite and un - imaginable splendor. Why are the ancient terms included m the Keys? According to Enoch, the ancient expressions of the Egyptian-Hebrew- Tibetan - Sanskrit - Chinese tongues are to be used, because they faithfully connect with the Masters who are still administrating Wisdom to this pro - gram of intelligence. These 'sounds of Light,' used in laying the foundation of the present program, will figure predominantly in the recapitulation of this program now at its Omega point. The Keys were composed of fire letter geometries because they are used by the Masters of Light to shape creation between the powers of Light and the octaves of sound. Hence, they constitute the regenerative power of biocoupling expressed through the vibration of the Word which produces the letters of color geometry. The energy words are to be used to code your body directly into the Light. They also provide the sound vibrations of greeting and protection in working with the Brotherhoods of Light and the Hierarchy of YHWH. To place these ancient energy words into English, modern Indo - European lan - guages, or some other language, would deprive consciousness of a direct experience with the power of the sacred language. Transposing these words would cause them to lose their energy pulse, which is similar to the symphonic song of a musical masterpiece transposed out of its original key into a strange cacophony. Therefore, the Keys work through the vibrations of Light and use these sacred expressions for the unfolding of the seals, and the direct experience of God's higher mysteries. Thus, in the preparation for the Keys, it may be necessary to study the vocabulary of \" seed syllables \" first, as given in the Glossary of this book, so that the thought - forms of the Language of Light used by the Masters and Brothers of Light may be fully realized. In these seed - syllables, the tes - timony of the Masters and the emanations from YHWH's Mind can be felt as powerful emanations that surpass the linear and static speech forms that are not linked to the Living Word of God. God's Living Word cannot be broken for it works through a vibration as effective on this end of time as in the beginning of time. Indeed, the seed - syllables of spiritual truth will truly cleanse and unite all the true scriptures of Light into the Am Soph, the Limitless Light of YHWH. In using the sacred syllables, your \" life vibration \" will also be placed in sym-"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"pathetic resonance with the Overself and Christ Body Overself in other worlds of creation. Finally, beloved, understand that in the eternality of God's Living Word - the Language of the Living Light has proven to be the binding ingre - dient behind the seals and mysteries of creation. The Language of Light controls the formulations or \" Gates \" in the expressions of the Letters. And now the Language of Light is shaking the foundations of the earth so that the earth may dawn anew through the teachings of the Father. Why are we here? Indeed, the divine Mind can emanate into matter and take on material form. The material form is necessary to serve as the biological foundation for new worlds of experience. Blessed are we who are and have known our image - for your Adamic image existed before this creation with the Father in whose likeness we are, for we came into this world and put on this body of flesh. Enoch said Adamic Man was created simultaneously in the heavens and transposed along energy grids into physical embodiment from a divine form which he is to return to after this exploration of consciousness. We are here as an experiment exploring opportunities to achieve yet greater things being tried and tested in the material worlds, so that the links be - tween the upper and lower worlds that have been forged by the Office of the Christ may be expanded, and that no one who seeks the Spirit of God may find himself as a rebellious child. However, in coming to earth each spiritual soul leaves his particular treasure, or his share of the Treasury of the Living Light behind him in the higher worlds which will await his re - turn. In entering the physical dimension, the energy of high speed electrons is gradually absorbed by electromagnetic and electrostatic \" brakes \" so that the thought - form body carried through high frequency light slows down long enough to interact with the electrons in the outer orbits of atoms. The entrance of the greater Luminescence into the common luminescence opens \" the Gates \" in the realms of biological phenomena so that the darkness can behold \" the Light. \" From this point on - with the teaching of Enoch and Metatron, it is no problem to trace the progressive stages of increasing order to larger and more complex entities, and the decreasing steps of energy change that may occur as thought - forms pass into the substratum of creation. In the conversion of Light into material form, our wort'd was originally commissioned in the Father's Name, but was intercepted by the fallen Masters who applied their law of vibration to this creation. The King of Kings and Lord of Lords who brought forth this creation out of His greater Love - allowed the Elohim Lords the prerogative of creating the thresholds of advanced intelligence for the seed of the Elohim. However, some of the Lords of Light revolted and sought not only to condemn the Adamic creation to destruction, but to interfere with the next models of other Adamic humanity created for this planet. It is only through the Of - fice of the Christ working through Metatron, and Melchizedek, that the in - carnate \" children of Light \" have had an opportunity to form communities of the \" Living Light. \" These communities are dedicated to the Father, and work directly with the heavenly hosts. In reading the Keys, you must not confuse the word \" evolution \" with the Darwinistic - Lamarckian use of this term. The term \" evolution \" used by Enoch, means the advancement of consciousness power in overcoming physical limitation and all conscious states that would inhibit the full ex - pression of the Love to God in all kingdoms of intelligence. True evolution is \" spiritual evolution \" whereby your spiritual vehicles evolve toward the divine self in concert with one another. Spiritual evolution coordinates the enlightenment of your consciousness vehicles, giving sustaining purpose to life through the fruits of Love and Wisdom. With simply \" material evolution, \" there would be no need for the Divine to intervene in the physical universes, and no need for the work of the B'nai Or. The biochemistry of the lower worlds would simply serve and at - tend to itself. However, there is a need because we are a living part of life, not \" life itself \" in the sense of structural autonomy, but as a collective being that is being continually manifested from the heavens to the planet - ary worlds in order that the Trees of Life may bear different fruits within the Kingdom of Creation. According to Enoch, our memories of the Higher Evolution or spiritual evolution are hidden from our knowledge by a veil of light, and when we remove this veil, the other worlds of existence will be simultaneously re - vealed to us by our Overself. However, the choice to serve the Light must be made in every embodiment, in every cycle, in every plan of creation. In making the choice, beloved, understand that which you were prom - ised in the Kingdom of God will be fulfilled. This is the witness which the Son revealed when he said to those around him that they would see the Kingdom being offered to YHWH - our Father! Truly, the spirit of truth is here; and Enoch and Metatron are here to guide you into this truth SO that this world might be in synchrony with the thrones and dominions of YHWH when the veil of time is removed! Let the Ancient of Days in unity with the Recent of Days, prepare a place where the Son of Man can lay his head in revelatory unity with the sons and daughters of the Bridegroom. Let the Ain Soph gather the lights of creation from all relativities and divine attributes.

By seeing uni - verse to universe and universe to many universes, we see the overall plan of development as requiring a higher mind. 4 The higher mind is seen as \" Lord, \" Adonai; \" King, \" Melek; and \" Redeemer, \" Messiah. 5 The knowledge of the living mind comes after your living mind becomes open - ended. 6 The scroll starts with an open - ended cosmology rather than a close - ended cosmology, for if it were to say in the first key, \" The creative mind as the center of this universe is known as \" Lord, \" 'King, \" and \" Redeemer, \" it would put all galaxies into a single uni - verse. 7 And Man by starting out with his own three - dimensional concept of God would limit God to that universe; 8 And he would argue with his fellow man as to the meaning of God, and the definition of \" What is God? \" 9 Is he the God that the ancient Christian theologians are seeing in terms of the Civitas Dei, the City of God?

Universe beyond universe, you see the Many and the One, or as the Greek philosophers would say, the 'En Kai Pan. 11 And when you see the many as well as the one, you recognize that the most perfect plurality is also the most perfect unity. 12 By going into the splendor of the universes (plural) you recognize a higher plan of creation than can be seen in this universe, in this level of creation. 13 Then, you can understand that one must go beyond all theologies and all cosmologies which say that this is God here, only in this level of creation. 14 For God is neither here nor there, neither Po nor Ti as the Greek philosophers would say. He is seen in all the universes. 15 Therefore, you must recog - nize all universes in order to see God, and He cannot be seen in the image of your own creative uni - verse for He is beyond all images. 16 He is beyond all universes, and yet all universes function col - lectively as the brain diagram of the higher order of Creation. 17 Why has there been a testing of God? What unworthy deed has He done that man must scandalize His Name within his own laborato - ries of delusion? 18 Can the perceptual form of this planetary mind be so vain as to suppose the universe does not exist beyond the scope of its own three - dimensional matter - energy body? Has no one spoken concern - ing the end of this age in which the illusions of corrupted mind- energies will cease to function in thoughts and forms? 19 If the planetary mind cannot see the nature of God and the cosmos within the collective \" I AM \" of its higher evolutionary body, how shall it determine its course through the heavens in order to behold and declare the true and certain nature of life as recreated within the universe of Living Light? The universe which surrounds us is full of love pow - ered emanations and love thresholds into which Man, as Son of Man, will evolve as life begets life and eternal life. 20 This shall be the Commun - ion of Light which will evolve into the eternal body of Light known as the Brotherhood of Light. 21 Therefore, grasp not at the spiritual inversions of light into matter, life into death, but awaken your vision with the light and love and the grace of humility before the Magnificent and Beneficent One of Eternal Peace. 22 The second key is saying that the Creative Mind exists not only as \" Lord, \" Adonai but as \" King, \" Melek, and as \" Redeemer, \" Messiah; this means that the Mind itself does not have to become in - carnate in order to act as King or Redeemer. 23 The Mind can stay where it is and program the \" Redeemer \" - Messiah, into any teacher of Light. The Mind can stay where it is and program into any master, such as Osiris, David, or Jataka, the king- ship of YHWH's sovereign energies. 24 The Mind can stay where it is and program the \" Lord \" - Adonai, into many universes, into many galaxies, into many life sta - tions. 25 \"King\" - Mdek is sovereign over all powers, principalities, and galactic universes of the Ophaizim, the B'nai Elohim and the Hyos Ha Koidesh that are beyond our level of intelligence. 26 The higher orders of intelli - gence understand that the Messiah is where the redemptive energies of the Body of Light are manifested. 27 When they are manifested within you, you are a part of the collective Messiah. The collective Messiah unifies not only the one hundred and forty - four thousand Ascended Masters that this physical universe is familiar with, but all physical universes that interpene - trate this physical plane and those beyond on other frequencies of light. 28 We are to see, then, if Man is to work with the Creative Mind, he must comprehend the Creative Mind as something beyond the an - thropomorphic image of a three - dimensional god form, even beyond the Light form of the Adam Kadmon, even beyond the Messianic form of Melchizedek. 29 The Creative Mind is Ehyeh Asher Elzyeh, I AM that I AM, or I Shall Be what I Shall Be, a constant evolving, a constant remaking of every order of creation. 30 If we are to participate in the ongoing bio - cosmic evolution of continuity and change within the creative continuum of the Higher Evolution, 31 we must release ourselves from all vain endeavors in order to KEY 101-103 24-3s quicken the establishment of 'YHWH is Here. \" 32 This shall be the great and , awe inspiring Sabaoth of Adonai 'Tsebayoth, the Lord God of Armies. 33 It is the creative fulfillment of our destiny. It is why we have been endowed with our many bodies of relativity, and it is why there is a fulfillment of prophesy within our day. 34 The fulfillment comes in the visitation and appearance of Merkabah and in the invitation now being extended to our higher bodies of light synthesis to join in the communion of Light set in honor of the Lords of Light who are to be heard and understood as the Lords Metatron, Melchizedek, and Maitreya. This is the Feast of Lights, this is the Brotherhood of Eternal Light. 35 The third key tells us that creations that survive must desire more than Eternal Life; they must also ingather the Light of the Liv - ing, because on the frequency of Light is determined the next threshold within biochemical evolu - tion. Light is the emanations of Di - vine Love that desire to serve all manner of creation that serve the Living Light. 36 Moreover, within the fre - quency of Light is determined the astrochemical parameters as to the width, the dimensions, and the size of the galaxy. 37 For within the larger galaxy is the larger image, which is open - ended just as the universe is open - ended. 38 The similitude, the image- making consistency, is also open - ended just as the universe is open - ended."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"KEY I0 I- 103311-'14 39 If you look at the original Hebrew scripture, you find that Man is made into the image and similitude. 40 \" Into \" indicates that evolu - tion is a continual ingathering, of Light. 41 But why image and similitude, Batsalmaynu and Kidmoothenu? It is because image is not enough; image will die with the creative pattern of life. You need the similitude of the space - time continuum of Light to regen - erate that image. 42 This is why the Man of Light, the Adam Kadmon, incar - nates into the image of the Adamic specie. 43 This is why the Adamic specie of Light continuously rein - carnates into the image of the Adamic species and not the lower evolution. 44 Without the similitude and the synchronicity of incarnations repeating the light functions and the light frequencies, the image would be here and die, like a flash in the darkness. 45 But the similitude can hold a consistency of light so that other evolutions can come into its image and feed off its image. Just like others will come before your image and feed off the Light that comes through your image once you have seen and beheld the Ophanim, once you have seen and beheld the Adam Kadmon which is part of your higher chemistry revealed to you in your true identity patterns. 46 For they are not in the image of the world but in the image of the Higher Evolution; they are not in the similitude of the world but in the similitude of the Higher Evolution. 47 And the key goes on to say, the Higher Evolution which is an emanation of the \" Living Uni - verse, \" is part of the Universal Mind which can be here, as well as in any other universe at the same time. 48 There can be multiple incar - nations of the higher creation. 49 There can be multiple pro - gramming through Light manifesta - tion without physical form.

If we are to go beyond our three - dimensional set of creation, we must go through our three - dimensional field of energy into the multi - dimensional fields of pyramidal Light energy. 2 Therefore, each Pyramid of Light is energized with YHWH's Eye in the center of the pyramid; this is a cosmological constant which enables every realm of intel - ligence to be reprogrammed into a higher level of creation when they can go through their pyramidal energy field of creation. Thus, the pyramid, the eternal programming of YHWH's Eye, is there with you at all times and is working with every level of evolution. 3 If you look at platinum crystal under a field ion microscope, you see bubble formations which form pyramid shapes of Light going from every stage of geometry all the way through the immediate field of the crystal. If you look at blood crystals under an electron microscope, you can find the shape of the pyramidal field in the crystal forms of blood. 4 What you are seeing is the Merkabah which connects the key pyramids so that Light can be used in unfolding the next stage of evolution. 5 The key of Enoch is telling us that the biophysical relationships which exist in all life processes from the smallest hydrogen atom to the largest quasi - stellar formation, are eventually going to prove that the Pyramid of Light is the central geometric form for all biophysical and consciousness evolution. 6 The pyramid shows that the Universal Mind is all present, not only in every molecule of star ioni - zation but in every vibration of consciousness flow. Wherever you look, you are going to find that the consciousness flow is going to go into that universal constant. 7 A close examination of the pyramidal units in hydrogen atoms will further reveal the geometry of a Star of David as a life - giving form.

These pyramids are built in grid forma - tion and are connected to chronomonitors which measure the vibratory levels of consciousness on a given planet in units of a thousand years. 10 They determine when suc - cessive consciousness worlds can accept physical extraterrestrial guides which nurture God level- zero (0) growth to God level - one (1) status, thus completing the pyramids at God level - one (1) status. 11 This growth can occur many times using the same planetary sphere to evolve many species for existence in innumerable worlds. 12 Pyramidal grids of informa - tion were established on Mars, for example, for use by artificial intel - ligence. They were built for the gathering of information deciphered from the magnetic lines of force at - tuned with thinking servomech - anisms or computers existing in our solar system. 13 These pyramids were estab - lished in grid formation so that the artifical intelligence of the vehicle, through stimulated emissions of radiation, could gather all informa - tion through \" short \" electromagnet - ic wave amplification. 14 The maser grids were estab - lished in units of eighteen. Nine are A - line controls and nine are B - line controls connected with a non - planetary pyramid - five formation which is the central model for in - formation processing. The pyramids are both three - sided and four- sided. 15 The grids collect knowledge about the complete range of sub - systems, biomes, ecosystems; geological and evolutionary infor - mation; knowledge of energy work - ing through all manifestations of physical form. For example, the grids measure energy as order and disorder transmitted through crystal structure and sunlight, and calcu - late all astronomic forces passing through the inner planetary crystal - line network. 16 The greater pyramids on Mars cover ten times the area used by the Co - Creators in establishing the major pyramidal grid at Giza, and five times the area of the major pyramidal grid established in China during previous evolutionary cycles. 17 Human intelligence must be initiated into the pyramidal func - tions of Light before they can be advanced to the next ordering of evolution, the next consciousness time cell. 18 Man will then see he is co - citizen and co - participant of star kingdoms which are part of a cos - mic pyramid, which is surrounded by a crystalline sphere separating this universe from other universes.

This is projected through photo neurons which are quantum mechanistic corpuscles of light working by means of photon am - plification. 33 All photons are in step; that is, they are reinforced in the same frequency which modulates mental energy into physical energy. Now essentially, this knowledge can be used to find the formula which will explain how light creates the quanta (corpuscles) of light in the brain, allowing the brain to work as it does, like a computer. 34 With this explanation, Man can see how his consciousness mind receives continuous com - munication within the brain from all forms of consciousness relativ - ity in our consciousness zone which pulsate thought - forms through a \" thinking Light cell \" by photon amplification of Light crystals. 35 Enoch explained that this consciousness process is continually going on as a flow paradigm of consciousness light within our physical galactic system. And in order to break this matter - energy construct, we must understand the following words of Enoch: \" Ther - modynamic properties of non- stationary sources which subordi - nate models of the thermo - dynamic systems, with negative temperature, can exceed the concen - tration of radiated energy because of the inversion of electrons, placed on various energetic levels, the holes of which are orientated by the opposite phase. Such systems possess the potential of maser exci - tation and they distinguish them - selves by a non - linear character (which is the creative spiraling of energy) showing the dependence of energy on entropy. 36 \" The physical schema (of creation) is one in which centropy cradles entropy in the much broader aspect of defining and re - lating matter and energy as parameters of a single EKA system. Entropy is then a sub-set of cen- tropy, centropy being a treatment of metagalactic ordering. 37 \" Our EKA system is merely a system which embraces matter - energy interactions which, for ex - ample, include such considerations as chemical reaction thermody - namics, and electron orbital transi - tions, among other factors, into the single function which relates differ - ences in only a single metagalactic substrate. 38 \" Thus, centropy is the fun - damental relationship which quan - titatively catalogues all matter - energy interactions and interrela - tionships. 39 \" Man must consider himself as part of a larger ionized field of intelligence operating as part of these interrelationships. Yet, since he is more than a host to the linear unity of centropy, as an energy- potentiality for converting centropy to zero (reaching a point of pure energy), he can break the matter - energy construct through certain forms of mind expansion. \" 40 In Eastern psychology this mental light projection is known as the Third Stage of Bardo, 'Light- Body Enlightenment,' in the Tibetan Book of the Dead, or Phowa energy in the Prajriipiramiti Siitra. 41 These principles show that the universe is rebuilding itself as it is breaking down and is catalogued into new geometries for conscious - ness to continue in time cells of higher creation or lower creation. We can understand, then, that all functions of the electrification of matter - energy, as well as the decay and the negative spins of energy, bring space, time, and matter through a pyramid of light as the dimension of energy conversion whereby the mind reaches out to KEY 104 76-46 the luminaries. This process allows physical man to leave behind the laws of entropy and join in unity with other intelligences who exist in other energy fields of creation serving the Light. 42 And so, in the PrajnZpGamiti S&ra we have the mathematical star coding of how the son of Man, the son of human flesh, rises to the orders of the stars to become the Son of the Stars. 43 This evolution from the physical body of creation to the higher intelligence involves a deeper understanding of life as multi - dimensional evolution where individuality does not count, only the continuity of the human species. To this end the physical body must be initiated into the Light before it can receive the Overself Body of Light which is the true I AM identity. 44 This means that all seven chakra centers must first be work - ing in perfect harmony and com - pletely aligned with the template of Light, the eighth chakra, the con - necting link with the Overself working with the Christ Body of Light. 45 And once Man has gone beyond his physiological limitations of Self and desires only to serve his fellow creation and the Father - he has purified himself from his carnal predilections and manifested Love sufficient to receive the outer garment of Light. 46 Here we have the picture of what the Lords of Light are trying to teach man through the Torah Or, the collective revealed scriptures of YHWH for this Age, and through the truths set forth in the Pyramid Hymns, the Bhasavad Gita, and the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"KEY 10446-50 Chinese and Tibetan texts of Light. 47 Through this assimilation Man becomes cosmic Man who can freely participate in the other forms of cosmic creation.

It is telling us that consciousness pro - gramming is connected with the Great Pyramid, which is referred to in the mystical scriptures of the an - cient Near East as the Foundation Stone. 2 The consciousness forces of the Great Pyramid are cued with specific starpoints which are work - ing with planetary time warp areas. 3 In order to understand what time warp areas represent, we have to understand the time warp fields as a type of energy pyramid. 4 First we must look at the geophysical time warps of the Earth with its meridians drawn ac - cording to the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. We note that these areas of the Earth's magnetic field, as well as the solar flares caused by the sun's celestial movement, meet at certain energy points or vortices. 5 What is not shown on map - pings of the vortexjah of time warp zones is their connection with the stars and the ancient astrophysical stations of Light upon the Earth. 6 And if we consider the star fields as giving some mapping of where the Earth's biosphere as a watery prism stands in relationship to given star fields, we will under - stand why the ancient Egyptian texts refer to Ihm-'sk and why the Great Pyramid was aligned with Mintaka (delta), Alnilam (epsilon), and Alnitak (zeta) in Tak - Orion (Orionis). These are the central threshold controls or the region of \" positive programming \" used by the Elohim Lords of Light to con - nect the many galaxies to our Father universe. Within our galactic quadrant, these threshold controls are necessary in coordinating celes - tial navigation between universes. Through the energies of Orion, the Central Threshold Control, the higher beings of Light move across the waters of the deep. 7 We must also understand the Pleiades cluster as one of the key centers for the propagation of Light.

These time clocks on the Earth are located on magnetic grids and focused into the Great Pyramid. 8 We see that the Earth is con - trolled by great geomagnetic energy spokes and that each energy spoke has within it twelve energy spokes all interconnected at certain parts of the Earth's star field. 9 Invisible lines of force estab - lish a systematic pattern for the formation of particles of matter and anti - matter in the programming and control of individual intelli - gence. 10 The main lattice formed by these lines of force consists of 30 minutes of arc divisible into sixteen smaller grid areas, measuring 7.5 minutes of arc by 6 minutes of arc or 45 square nautical mile units. 11 Each one of the twelve main lattice areas is controlled by a high frequency geophysical pyramid. What appears as the physical struc - ture of these time warp areas exists in reality as a twin force of matter and anti - matter which creates a mirror - like image which can be used to alter \" physical reality \" to a much higher reality of universal in - telligence. 12 This greater reality uses A - line and B - line solar radiational fields to create the vertical and horizontal energy cube around the Earth's rotational field. 13 The Brotherhood of Light uses these twelve grids or vortexjah to enable them to come into the Earth's biosphere and build great civilizations to help the conscious - ness of Man understand his Divine origin. 14 Enoch explained to me how the Brotherhood of Light first sought to upgrade intelligence upon this planet eons ago, and that the first attempts in recent cy - cles of time took place in the Takla Makan Desert where the civilization of \"Tak\" was evolved 36,000 years ago and reached over a vast area to what man has called South America. Great city areas were built and seeded with a great tech - nology of the heavens so that Man could directly call upon the name of the Lords of Light while living in bodies that were of great light and of Light molecular density. 15 After this experiment ended in disaster with the people of light intermarrying with the fallen off - spring of the Lords of Light, another experiment was generated in an area of the world known as Atlantis. There technology was based upon crystalline attunement of the matter and anti - matter cycles of the physical and non - physical worlds. By stepping up or slowing down the frequency of energy be - tween the two cycles, they could cause a shift in time - space to occur. 16 This, however, ended in failure due to the mixing of genetic codes and factors of light by the fallen axis Lords of Light who used their crystalline technology to bring this great civilization of Light into war and destruction. 17 The last attempt in generat - ing a higher genetic people took place during the time of Egypt six thousand years ago, when the great people of Israel with a \" higher spiritual capacity \" of Nephesh were implanted to upgrade the peoples of the world by bring - ing the message of Jehovah and YHWH's kingdom of Light to all nations. far tlwmatfwrfiwd MAJOR \" ARTIFICIAL \" TIME WARP AREA?; USED BY THE BROTHERHOOD MAJOR \" NATURAL \" TIME WARP AREAS USED BY THE BROTHERHOOD"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"KEY 105 38-27 18 All three civilizations used pyramids of Light which also exist on higher matter - energy planes in the Takla Makan area, the Peruvian area of South America, the Ber - muda Triangle area, and the Great Pyramid at Giza. 19 The pyramids were used as initiation points for the vehicles of the 'Dove r - those who reign with the Brotherhood of Light. Thus, the return of the 'Dove' is directed to the previous initiation points built along pyramidal grids. 20 In order for us to understand the present cycle of evolution, we must understand how the Brother - hoods are still connected to the pyramid in Egypt as the continua - tion of Joseph - Moses - and - Jesus' in - itiation into the governing of the special specie - the Israelites - who were to be the pyramid builders of consciousness for the Name of YHWH, to lead the nations of man away from the false gods of this world as the gathering of \" the twelve sparks \" into the Brother - hood of Light. 21 And Enoch explained to me that just as Egypt represents the mathematical, astronomical, pyram - idal foundation of the Earth exemp - lified in the Great Pyramid at Giza, so Israel represents the \" spiritual capstone of Light, \" exemplified by the peoplehood of Israel who re - ceived the Ten Commandments while traveling through the geophysical pyramid of the Sinai Peninsula. 22 When humanity can find the spiritual Israel within and the knowledge and alignment of the Great Pyramid without, they can place the capstone of spiritual free - dom upon the foundations of this world. 23 Thus, we see the ground plan of the physical vortexjah as the alignment of both Israel and Egypt which has been used to create the People of Israel, who ex - tend from this vortexjah unto all of the secondary pyramidal capstones of Light and science. 24 When humanity can center the vortexjah along the magnetic meridians of the Earth, they will see how the Great Pyramid gives the points of survival, as well as the points of contact used by the Merkabah vehicles to program the next \" Exodus \" out of the old meridians of time into the new consciousness space of rebirth within the planispheres. 25 Enoch explained that when mankind opens the \"Pyramid- Sphinx \" and uses the conscious - ness meridians which connect the twelve energy vortices of the world to the Pyramid - Sphinx, he will have reached a threshold where the energy vehicles can return and take mankind to the next evolutionary station. 26 In fact, the Great Pyramid is built on such a point where the magnetic fields under the Earth, those on the surface of the Earth, and those on the celestial fields all cross so that the fields of alignment are direct. 27 These magnetic fields are aligned through \" aerials \" of magnetic energy which mark the points where energies from outer space pour into the Earth's surface. These aerials are balanced on the Earth by the magnetic North and South Pole. And at the time when tremendous solar flare movements bombard these magnetic points of the Earth, the fields of the Earth will be set in cataclysmic imbal - ance, spinning the shell of the Earth to new magnetic meridians which find their balances equatori- ally. 28 And once man understands how the Great Pyramid is a geophysical model for these mag - netic changes in the Earth, he will recognize that the Pyramid is the actual foundation stone placed di - rectly in the \" center of the Earth. \" 29 The ancient astrophysical texts speak of previous geophysical tumbles which happened during great cataclysms when, for exam - ple, the area commonly called the Sudan Basin was at the North Pole. 30 And when we connect the natural magnetic fields with the shifting magnetic fields we can un - derstand how the natural time warps already exist within different focal points of the Earth's energy index. 31 The Higher Intelligence com - ing from a galactic light threshold needs only to draw lines between given vortexjah on the Earth and moving magnetic vortices in the air streams, in order to set in motion all of the spectrum controls neces - sary to establish their coordinates. 32 Their vehicles establish molecular - triangular coordinate pat - terns in the air, as well as on the earth, which permits them to come into the Earth's field of intelligence. 33 When we understand this we can see that it is the conscious - ness of the higher mind that draws lines in between respective sun sys - tems and knows which type of energy meridian to work with. 34 The spiritual Higher Mind draws lines between the Earth's pyramidal zones, existing on the KEY 705'27-40 magnetic horizon, and its own threshold controls, thus allowing it to intersect the Earth's pyramidal forces with the celestial pyramid - Orion. This activity must take place in order to secure the time warps as points of physical rebirth. 35 When this takes place, the keystone or the pyramid color cap can come down upon the pyramid vortexjah. 36 For example, the Higher In - telligence is coming into the ocean through the pyramid - five energy configuration of the Bermuda Triangle and is making use of the ocean shelf which is there from the previous Atlantean Age, preparing America to become the New Atlan - tis. 37 These previous Atlantean fields of crystalline energy are being reactivated as centers of energy focus on the planet which will be used once the Earth's inner core of neutral matter has been heaved up. 38 New Atlantean centers will be activated from the Bermuda Triangle, the Great Salt Sea, and JerUSAlem-Hebron which are al - ready known as \" Pyramid areas \" by the Higher Evolution. 39 These areas will be used by the Jerusalem Command from Orion to open the chambers of the Earth and provide for the shifting of consciousness to the Americas - the next Home of the Dove, as the Father's program shifts from the Middle East to the Middle West. 40 The coming return of the Dove will also use artificial time warp areas so as to touch upon the 'islands of Light \" where the right - eous will gather who are not in the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"KEY 10540-54 natural time warps. 41 They will land upon the sands that were promised Abraham and the prophets of Light who speak of the sands of the righteous being carried to higher levels of star intelligence. 42 These landing places are the basin areas which were used by previous cycles of higher intelli - gence and which contain the documents telling how these areas will be reactivated. 43 Therefore know the twelve major 'Ur' areas of Light, such as the Takla Makan Basin and Megiddo which are aligned with the consciousness forces of the Great Pyramid and used by the ce - lestial commands. 44 Onto these twelve areas, cities of Light - \" Or stations \" of Light technology - will come down from the Milky Way which will be as Cities from the Sea of Crystal, for they will be brought down from stations in the heavens such as Betelgeuse, Orion, a Bethel life station honoring the Father. 45 The Higher Intelligence will return to such areas as the Takla Makan basin, the Ural - Caspian Sea basin, the Dead Sea basin, the basin of the Sahara, the basin of the Kalahari, and the Salt Lake basin area - where the program - mers originally came to lay the foundations of the deep during previous Alpha cycles. 46 The twelve artificial time warp islands of Light will be formed out of the oceans and seas, as great interlocking circles con - nected with the polar areas. 47 The harmonics of Light will reveal the ancient lands of the Nephites in the Americas; these will show the overlap where the Brotherhood will land in America to gather the \" righteous seed. \" 48 They will come within the formation of a magnificent Dove' - whose head of crystal knowledge will be over the Yucatan peninsula, whose wings shall sweep across the danger zones of the Eastern and Western flank of North America, whose feet will land within the pyramidal area of the Bermuda Triangle and the ocean area near Mazatlan, and whose body will gather the Pearls of the communities of the righteous into the heartland of the Ancient of Days. 49 Into all of these areas around the world, technologies of Light will come from the galactic com - mand in Orion with instructions to help the Adamic race bring peace to the Earth. 50 People who are to be brought into these areas will be transfigured to go on with the galactic seed already in the image of the Lamb given in the galactic key of the Pleiades. 51 And their seed in the physi - cal flesh will then be like the stars of the heaven. 52 They will take the Exodus to other star systems in order to begin a new genesis in the next ordering of creation. 53 At this time the Great White Brotherhood will come to take its own seed; for twenty million years ago it planted its seed crystal within the galaxy. 54 At intervals of every six to twelve thousand years the celestial Lords of Light gather the cultivated seed crystal of evolution left by the original Adamic guardians who"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"KEY 105 54 - 64 were activated to direct the prog - eny of the Earth. 55 At this point in our con - sciousness time zone, the celestial Lords of Light will come back by order of the galactic command in Orion, which governs many uni - verses, to save the Adamic seed. 56 They will deliver their seed and the seed of the other nations who wish to be coded into the \" Galactic Tree of Living Light \" in the Paradise Mansion Worlds of the Father. 57 Those who have accepted the Christ seed, the Buddha seed, or any of the Lords of Light, will have within them the active chan - nels of Light which will allow them to function as the Adamic Race upon other planetary worlds and in other universes. The world that they will inherit will depend upon the maturity of the soul and the way they have allowed the Light to function within them in service to their fellow creation. 58 The key is giving the great promise of the great meeting of space through the galactic com - mand which will take its seed crystal, personified in the Sea of Salt, into the greater Sea of Crystal where it will be able to be \" the salt \" of other existing universes and the \" seed crystal \" of the living Word in new worlds. 59 Into these twelve energy fields will move the artificial time warps. As the artificial time warps move over the specific areas, the galactic command will be able to take the physical creation and energize its body into the Adamic structure of the Great White Brotherhood, no matter what race or group. 60 The crystalline fields of the twelve Urim and Thummim will be opened, will be cleansed, and as the scroll of Revelation says, we will be one with \" the Great White Throne in the midst of the Earth. \" 61 The nations of the earth will be saved from war and destruction through the People of Light. The People of Light will enter all of these energy vortexjah directed by the Jerusalem Command, the Higher Intelligence from Kesil- Orion controlling the physical energy field now over the present Israel. 62 These time warp zones are the stepping stones for the Watch - men of Zion. The Watchmen of Zion are being sent into the twelve geophysical time warp areas to proclaim the Lay - oo - esh, the Pillar of Light which will come out of the larger artificial time warp areas of Light. 63 The Watchers of Zion will move into these areas and code the people from these areas, those in the physical form as well as those in other dimensions of intelligence which have always coexisted with the people of the Earth, but who have not been seen by the people of the Earth unless they have been polarized by the Pillar of Light that governs All. 64 For behold, a great sign will be given unto you which will be the coming of the pyramidal cap - stone of the Christ Light in the skies, which will land upon the pyramidal foundations of the Righteous to quicken the \" living dust \" of gravitationally trapped light to become a new Earth. * $4 <*!<<Ã‡ Our universe 4 Ãˆ iiÃˆ$< * $0 was created out ^SÃ§ *SÃ 644 Ã§Ã‡Si throne ofour conscwusness*"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"OUR UNIVERSE WAS CREATED OUT OF THE \" LIGHT SYN - THESIS \" OF THE NEXT UNIVERSE.

This veil consists of heat envelopes which form a biochemical testing zone necessary to divine life. 2 The biochemical testing zone surrounds the core or Central Sun known as the Kolob. 3 Both our local physical uni - verse (one spectrum of our local universe) and the surrounding biochemical testing zone are super - seded by an invisible world of negative mass, which shapes the atomic nucleus and is used in the building of the physical energy sys - tem of our visible galaxy. Thus, the physical universe proceeds out of the world of negative mass which is used for the purification of \" trapped light.'' 4 The blueprint for this physical universe and the world of negative mass pre - exists in the higher heavens, in the star codes of the Pleiades. 5 From these codes the Elohim Lords of Light in Orion create the formation of the negative mass which is modulated by the thought - forms of the Lords of Light into the creation of the physical universe of mass - evolution. 6 Through the energy of Ze the Lords of Light transform the world of negative mass into Magnetic tun - nels where particles are cycled and recycled, allowing some forms of star seed evolution to unfold into given forms of light continuity. Thus, physical life proceeds out of mass - evolution. 7 Though the star codes of the Pleiades form the dimensions for the biochemical rhythms of the atomic nuclei which are created in Orion, Orion also shapes the higher astrochemical wavelengths of the Kolob which are not created by negative mass. 8 Moreover, in these higher creative functions there are myriad arrangements of patterns for as- trochemical destiny in the heavens, whereby both Kimah (Pleiades) and\\ Kesil (Orion) are cooperatively used in the programming of life synthe - ses from the pure light bodies of Orion into the transfigured corre - sponding physical forms of Pleiadaic programs. 9 The Pleiades represents the key to physical protocreation; it represents the galactic beginning of the physical Adamic household."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"KEYI0b10-16 10 And if we examine the Bonk of Genesis involving the seven days of creation, we see that the six fields of light come together so that on the seventh day, the transmuta - tion can be added to the physical chemistry of life. Therefore, on the seventh iron of Light, the races which were evolved during the first six (cons of time are superseded by the Seventh Ray, which is the planting of our Adamic household of Kimah and Kesil intelligence on the planet as a witness to the evolving nations. 11 Kesil (Orion) emanates the Gnosis, the knowledge which creates the Pnei~matikoi, the spiritual powers of the Christ. However, the pre - physical garment of Light which is needed to embody this higher Light consciousness comes from the Pleiades. The Pleiades also gives us the light garments of the negative mass which shapes the Xoikoi, the physical spectrum of the many who are called. Between the two are the Psychekoi, the ra - tional minds who derive their men - tal energy from the lower heavens and call power unto themselves. They prevent the Xoikoi from re - ceiving the spiritual Gnosis of the Pneuma fzkoi. 12 In the evolution of our local universe there have been many fallen planets that have claimed for themselves an Eternal Inheritance with the Father. However, Enoch clearly tells us in this key that the Adamic Race, as the Family of God, has come in the physical form from Orion and the Pleiades; wherein the Pleiades is both the true cradle (the seed bed) and the throne (the codes) to support the pre - existent consciousness of Light. The cradle is where the conscious - ness seed enters the physical womb of space and time through the few who are chosen by the Throne, al - lowing those who are of the physi - cal seed the opportunity to graduate into other universes of higher thrones and dominions. 13 Therefore, the Pleiades is considered the foundation for the harmony of creation. However, the many who are called must go through myriads of other kingdoms before they can enter as pure thought, pure energy into the Kingdom of Light; that is, until they have reached the state of \" di - vine non - evolu tion.\" 14 The key speaks of the celes - tial image of God working through the Brotherhoods of Light in Kimali and Kesil, and the celestial origins of the Brotherhoods of Light as - signed to this planet Ur. 15 The chosen of this planet who successfully serve their specie qualify not only to put on the higher Overself body of Light but are given the knowledge of how to use the codes of biochemical crea - tion on this planet to mutate a specie capable of carrying the Light into other creations. For this reason the People of Israel were created. 16 We find in the scroll of the Ascended Master Job that the Lords of Light in Kimah and Kesil are continually rejoicing in creation and setting the boundaries; open - ing the channels of light; bringing down the twelve star systems of heavenly light and measuring the world with the weights and meas - ures of Light from Orion. All energy is carefully weighed and measured before it can be taken in and out of the scales of space and time. Job saw in this drama how his own sons and daughters were also taken in and out of the levels of creation. 17 And when we become the Family of God, the Pepleromenoi, thoroughly furnished to work with the Father's Plan on earth, we shall be united with the Shepherd and together we shall go through the gateway of the Big Dipper and rise to the level of the higher star intel - ligences. 18 In the end, we as the Family of God, as the living Pepleromenoi, will see the opening of the star gates in the Big Dipper and the Pleiades and the coming down of \" Merkabah .\" During this new Eon of Light there will be the Judge - ment of the Earth and the release of the sun from its circumpolar spiral. 19 We will see the old geome - tries of the Big Dipper change ac - cording to the scales of Orion and the Pleiades. 20 The Big Dipper (Ursa Major) and the Little Dipper (Ursa Minor) are the threshold gates of the lower evolution in opposition to the Pleiades, the seven lampstands to the Throne of the Father. At the end of time we will see the war of the heavens and the coming of the Host of Michael. This will free the planetary intelligences from the in - fluences of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, the negative influences con - trolling the root races of this planet Ur. 21 Thus, the organic structure of God's Race - the Race of Christ, set in motion at the beginning of creation, proceeds beyond the seventh day of creation when Man is graduated to work with the intel- KEY I06 16 - 25 ligences of Kimah and Kesil. This High Command intelligence works with our solar system through the Mid - Way station of Archturus * which opens the lower heavens by break - ing the controlling handle of Ursa Major, thereby allowing the lower avens to move into alignment w'th the true star pointer of the 7 Pleiades. 22 In the formation of our local universe, the fallen Lords of Light imitated the blueprints of the sa - cred star groups of seven which are the matrix for the Host of Heaven. And by initiating their seed into these star regions such as Ursa Major, these star systems became their Mid - Way stations controlling negativity on the lower planets. 23 The next evolutionary orbital level of creation works completely with the Brotherhood of Light, not under the gates of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, but under the direc - tion of Kimah and Kesil, the thresholds of the Kuchavim, the dis - tant star universes. 24 Intelligences in these distant universes are called upon not only to judge the Earth, but also to judge the gods who reign in these fallen stations of the sky. We, too, who are on the threshold between the spiritual powers and humanity, will be called upon to judge the angels who have been cast into our dimension of space during this cleansing of the sky, fulfilling the words of I Corinthians where it says: \" Do you know that you shall judge angels? \" 25 The Big Dipper stands as the threshold that must be overcome by Man on this planet before he * See key 2 - 0 - 1 on Archturus."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"KEY 106: 25 - 34 will be free of the consciousness image of the Bear which emanates thought - forms of war and destruc - tion.

The Zohar races are the celestial counterparts evolved from the same master blueprint which governs soul evolution on the planets. 27 The planetary counterpart to the blueprint consists of the three basic types of Man: the Xoikoi, the clay people who have the ability to evolve but (within our realm of creation) are largely governed by the fallen chemistry of this physical universe (i.e., under the fallen in - fluence of the Big Dipper), oblivi - ous to the higher orders of star evolution; 28 the Psychekoi, the rational people who serve the mathematics of the circumpolar areas of the Lit - tle Dipper and the Big Dipper and \" think of the gods \" only as mythological manifestations of the Mazzaroth, the twelve signs of the Zodiac; 29 and the Pneumatikoi, the few who are chosen to work with the Lords of Light, who look to the Pleiades as the Divine Dipper in conjunction with the stations of Orion where Michael, Metatron, and Melchizedek, with the 144,000 Lords of Light administer unto the Son universes in the name of the Living Light of YHWH. 30 For truly, great nations and brothers and sisters of the covenant have offered sacrifice to Kimah and Kesil, so that our creation may con - tinue in the name of the Father, through the seven Divine energies which shape both the soul in the heavens and the physical embodi - ments in the lower heavens. 31 The offering to the Father in Orion and the Pleiades was dramatized by special mathematical symbols showing how the seven chakras could work together in of - fering up the Divine Breath. This special offering in ancient times symbolically coded seven bulls which have the star face of Taurus - Orion and seven rams which have the star face of the Pleiades. 32 For from the Pleiades will come the cross of Redemption through the image of the Lamb of God. And the Lamb will be seated upon the Throne of God, and he will carry the sword of Light which will behead the energies of the fall - en suns and all those who shout blasphemies against the Father, the Paradise Sons, and the Holy Spirit-Shekmah. 33 Thus, the Pleiades and Orion give the mathematics for every chemical sacrifice required in life from Genesis to Revelation. And at the end of our program, those who carry the image of the Lamb will be separated from those who carry the image of the Bear (Ursa Major) and the Dragon (alpha Draconis), the fallen spiritual powers controlling the old linear astronomy of the Babylonian sciences, forcing man to do homage to the lower heavens. 34 With a great rushing of thanksgiving, the Lords of Light will return the consciousness of the Overself to our human conscious - ness allowing us to break through the biochemical shells of this world surrounded by negative mass. Simultaneously, we will be gathered into the air to meet the Lord. This will allow our body ve - hicle to be judged both in terms of this world, as well as its affinity with the world of higher spiritual consciousness - the world of the Christ Body Overself. 35 Those who worship the Beast through their astronomy and astrology of the lower heavens and by their mathematical graven im - ages of light are returned to begin their consciousness program once again. 36 Thus, we see the Pleiades as reflecting the mathematics of the Lords of Light in the creation of new star systems and sun systems. 37 We see the Pleiades in terms of the organic seed of the Pneumatikoi, the spiritual people of the Christ Race. And we see the Pleiades in terms of the greater sac - rifices of Light and Cosmology. 38 This sixth key, then, shows how the higher lights can modulate the physical universe which is con - trolled by the force fields of '666' KEY 706.34-40 so that the pure thoughts of the Masters working with the '777' principle stars in the cluster of the Pleiades have the power to materialize a new heavens and a new Ea th, so that the former things wkyot be called to mind. 39 At that time, the liberated body of Gematria will go beyond the '777' combination connecting the lower biological creation to be - come one with the Jesus Gematria of '888.' This liberated body, thus ascends into the higher Infinite throne worlds of the Father's Many Mansions which are liberated to reign with the Christ. 40 This tremendous power of the Godhead in the Name of YHWH resurrects even the king - doms of Darkness.

This cap - stone will take Man through his technology into other worlds of Light. In the name of Metatron, Man thus becomes an active co - participant in the higher heavens of creation. 10 When I was taken to Orion, Enoch could not take me into the Master Pyramid of Light. Only Metatron could do this, for Enoch is the Ascended Master of Light, but Metatron is the Lord of Light God who is working with the Right and the Left Hand of the Father Himself. 11 Metatron is the Creator of the \" outer Light \" which penetrates the regions of formlessness and void allowing for the dawning of the Living Light of YHWH in re - gions of the \" outer universe. \" 12 Metatron provides the Light envelopes for the Thought - Forms of the Ancient of Days. These, in turn, are used by the Creator Gods in newly evolving regions to create their own Hierarchical patterns which eventually merge these re - gions with the Father's House of Many Mansions. 13 And through this region of Orion, which is the cosmic pyramid of creation in our Son universe, the \" outer Light \" of Metatron is pro - jected into the matrix of stellar cre - ation which governs the worlds of negative mass by sword of Light projections. 14 Metatron, who serves the Ancient of Days, is to Enoch a Re - vealer of Secrets and a jurisdic - tional aspect of the Lordship emanating from the Ancient of Days. Metatron, from the Father's bosom, delivers to Enoch the Books of the Court of YHWH to be tran - scribed for the Son universes and the lower planetary worlds. 15 He took me, Jacob, into the appearance of the Father and I knew that the Universe of all uni - verses is His Cosmic Pyramidal Throne. I knew that every galaxy is like a cornerstone of Light and within every galaxy there are sun systems with their pyramids (just as there are planetary systems with their pyramids). 16 To go through the Central Control Pyramid towards the Throne in our Father universe re - quires the energies of the capstone, the Zohar Body of Light. But to enter into the actual presence \" of the Father's Throne \" it is necessary to call upon the sacred name of Metatron in relationship to the Christ Body Overself. For Metatron is the pure radiation of all corporal forms that the Father can assume in the heavens of the Throne. 17 Metatron gives knowledge of the Father to all star universes so that they have a central core in the name of the Father. Metatron is star ionization, or \" Or - ion knowl - edge \" to every star which is created so that it is unified with the core memory in the center of the galaxy; and Metatron gives knowledge of Ze unto ton - pro - jected Light crystal consciousness which the prophets called Zion. 18 Metatron gives this Light consciousness to those who are working with the Throne. They then become the active recipients who promulgate the Law of the Living Light. Thus, it is written the Law shall go forth out of Zion, from the spiritual Israel upon this earth. However, the spiritual Israel is the coordination of all the races of Man, so that all mankind can be brought to salvation from the king - doms of flesh into the kingdoms of Light. 19 Those kingdoms which do not survive are kingdoms of fallen darkness; they do not have suffi - cient knowledge and Light to pass into the central core of the great universes where there exist multi - evolutions of consciousness communication. 20 These intelligences must stay out on the edge of the galaxies and play out their chemical destruction; to permit them to go on would allow them to interfere and destroy other life. 21 For this reason the Councils of the Paradise Sons and the Lords of Light take many Ascended Mas - ters into the center of the galaxy. From the center of the galaxy the Lords of Light issue forth programs of redemption and resurrection to physical orders to enable them to evolve from Population I to Popula - tion I1 star systems through seed crystal Pyramids of Light. 22 We who are on the outer edge of a Population I Life System KEY 707 77-25 use the \" half - life function \" of Light; we use the \"meta-functions of Light \" instead of the \"Meta- tronic functions.\" Therefore, we can only work with the common light wavelength of Population I star worlds and not with the pluralistic radiations of multiple electromagnetic spectrums. We cannot cross this threshold to go into the next pyramidal threshold of Light. As a consequence, we are only between the outer sides of the Pyramids of Light and the Pyramids of Eternal Night. 23 The Pyramid of Light, the Throne Energy of Light, gives the entrance to the Throne control of star evolution. The Pyramid of Light commissions the Lords of Light to build physical pyramids on the lower planispheres and to code within them the central keystone of knowledge to explain how Meta - tronic physics can enable Man, once he has brought together all of the spiritual languages and scien - tific gifts, to enter into the presence of the Throne. 24 In the teachings of the Zohar, it is the function of the Ophanim and the Cherubim to train the various galactic councils in the language of Light, so that those councils can synchronize the time cells of their administration with the right knowledge within the turning of the Wheel of the Law. 25 This turning of the Wheel of the Law dispenses the proper knowledge for soul evolution. By speeding up the Wheel of the Law the material plane can reach a state of non - evolving perfection, for it is the Father's Will to grant freedom of the spirit and everlasting Spirit - life to everyone who accepts His Kingdom."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"KEY 107 26 - 36 26 Even the fallen angels, at the end of a great cycle will be freed from the lower heavens if they ac - cept the Father's Love with com - plete obedience to His Word. 27 The scripture of the Mel- chizedek Brotherhood tells us that there are many Brotherhoods of Ophanim, the messengers of YHWH, working with interplane - tary sciences and consciousness evolution. 28 In all there are seventy brotherhoods of Light working within our universe, all having within them the ability to under - stand any type of spiritual lan - guage or any type of spiritual knowledge which is shown to them from the Hierarchy of Light. 29 Among these, the Brotherhood of Melchizedek works with the con - sciousness awakening and repro - gramming of light in the life cycle of the planets. 30 The Brotherhood or the Order of Enoch works with the scientific teachings and keys necessary to evolve star seed evolution and to build Pyramids and pyramidal grids of light upon the planets. 31 And the Order of Michael pro - tects the various universes through the Mid - Way Ophanim so that in - telligences do not randomly trans - plant and genetically re - engineer species serving the cosmic Law. If it were not for the Rikbidim who govern the chariots of celestial Light, and the Qaddinim who judge the dimensions of higher intelli - gence from within the Order of Michael, there would be massive invasions of fallen angels and intel - ligence into other planetary worlds, turning species on other planets into sub-species and slave king - doms. It is the Order of Michael which can fairly administer justice since it governs all administrative records of activities within all levels of all universes. 32 Yet, at the end of a grand cycle of time the Father permits these fallen orders of intelligence, some of which are grotesque physi - cal creations, to suddenly appear upon the planispheres like Earth to tempt man like Satan tempted Jesus. This is the last temptation that mankind is collectively being put through to see whether we will , serve the lesser \" space gods \" or share love with the angelic Hierar - chies to the glory of the Father. 33 Thus, the three Brotherhoods of Michael, Enoch, and Mel- chizedek govern the seventy Brotherhoods of our universe by dispatching millions of emissaries of Light to repair and evolve the lower worlds. 34 The influence of these three Brotherhoods prepares the right - eous servant to work directly with the powerful leadership of High Command. 35 This omnipotent Command is directed by Michael, Gabriel, Remiel, Raphael, Uriel, Yophiel, and Phanuel who combine forces for the greatest problem solving, and when issues of new spiritual leadership are discussed for the lower worlds. 36 Those who are chosen from the lower worlds to be the new leaders are removed from their planets by the Brotherhoods and given a thorough teaching of the higher heavens by the members of High Command. And those who have previously descended from the heavens for work in.the lower worlds are then taken by Metatron into the presence of the Father's Throne. 37 These leaders also include the Masters who have evolved their soul according to the Father's Di - vine emanations, out of the span of a \" new - born soul existence. \" Many have not descended from spiritual existence into physical form as the Ascended Masters, therefore, they have only worked with the solar energy planes of the planetary population within the worlds of their solar Logos. 38 Enoch stressed that in each planetary cycle there are few Mas - ters who qualify on all levels to be taken up into the divine presence during each planetary cycle. 39 Consequently, Enoch told me that there would be many false spiritisms, and false astrologies and astronomies arising at the end of an era confusing the Ascended Masters and Masters who together serve the Father, from those Mas - ters of the changing solar Hierarchy and lower planetary councils who have not been taken up and intro - duced to the higher realms. 40 He taught that there would be \" false Christs\" who in the name of the Masters from the old hierar - chies and planetary councils would lead many of the Children of God away from their service to the Father. 41 Those who are called the As - cended Masters have originally de - scended from the higher Orders serving the heavenly Hierarchies to teach in the lower worlds. The As - cended Masters generally number one hundred and forty - four thousand for a given complete pro - cession of a star cycle in the lower S\"' KEY 107 36 - 47 heaven 42 The biological weights and measures for these cyclic periods are set at Alpha and Omega. (There are twelve basic planetary cycles of growth and experimenta - tion before a planet enters into a multiple time cell.) 43 The manner in which the physical bodies are chosen to house the Ascended Masters depends upon their previous work in earlier biological cycles. 44 The Ascended Masters are governed by the \" Councils of Light \" and connect the Light work - ers serving the Mazzaroth-worlds of the \" lower heavens \" revolving within the star regions of the Zodiac, with complex worlds of multiple suns in the \" higher heavens, \" - known as the Mazalofh worlds. 45 The Councils of Light also work with the greater Hierarchy of the Hyos Ha Koldesh in serving the Kuchavim worlds, which are spiritual universes continually being evolved and re - evolved beyond the visible spectrum. 46 The Kuchavim worlds are the realms used by the higher orders of Princely Ophanim to generate an antidote to replace the realms of false spiritual energy. And at the time of the Malake Haballam, the cycle of cleansing, the wicked are cast out of their realms of space and a new world is brought forth by the Hyos Ha Koidesh modeled in the Kuchavim. 47 These distant worlds of the Kuchavim are connected to the Throne through Metatron directing the Hyos Ha Koidesh.

For this reason certain celestial creations were placed out of sync in relationship to the Divine vibrations of the Father's Name. 49 Our world was originally commissioned in the Father's Name, but was intercepted by the fallen Masters who applied their law of vibration to this creation. 50 Because the original inhabit - ants on this Ur station violated the laws of applying the higher physics of cosmic Law, the Lords of Light confused the language of man in such a manner that man to this day cannot apply the keys of the Eastern vibrations of Light with the Western vibrations of Light. 51 However, Man will soon have the ability to once again as - similate the physics of the cosmic Law and understand the power of Metatron's Light which governs the outer Redemptive cycle of the Father's Love expressed through the Christ. This will be done through the issuing of new teach - ings which will break the sacred seals on the old scrolls and bring man into the New Age. This is why the Book of Knowledge is being given. 52 These scrolls are the written Light pulsations which gather the consciousness sparks of the old spiral of spiritual energy which is then fused with a new spiral of Christ energy connected with the Light of Metatron serving the outer worlds until the Light is made per - fect within the Nartoomid, the Eter - nal Light. 53 The new creations will be formed out of a higher physics of Light which is superior to the physics of destruction brought by the fallen Masters Shamsiel, Sariel, and Araluel who were cast down in previous cycles to the lower heavens; there they bound the magnetospheres to the lower il- luminaries. 54 And when the human king - dom began to use the fallen power of the physics of Light which was in violation of the greater har - monies and balances, this know - ledge was put into confusion lest man destroy the other worldly kingdoms. 55 The key, then, explains how one can only use the physics of the Master Pyramid of Light through the balancing power of Metatron, the scientific - spiritual consciousness of Light. 56 The spiritual power is not sufficient to enter into the presence of the Almighty. 57 For the presence of the Al - mighty cannot be approached through the spiritual dimension without the responsibility \" to serve the Father universes \" by co- participating in the creation of 'new earths.' 58 For the love of 'The Father' cannot be seen without elongating the Father's Light into regions of darkness. 59 It was Metatron in counsel with the Mid - Way Lords of Light who asked that the Ancient of Days withhold judgement on the lower planetary dust worlds of darkness. 60 It was Metatron who estab - lished the Office of the Unity of Days, which allows Lords of Light and creations of Lords of Light to redeem themselves by working within the Wheel of the Law, within the Cosmic Wheel of Light. 61 Enoch, with the guidance of Metatron, created the wheel of sci - ence which brings the lower phases of life systems in and out of karmic knowledge for multiple adaptations of Divine truth. 62 Therefore, man is given the responsibility to destroy himself in the darkness or to accept the higher \" Law of Lightupthe Torah Or. 63 Man who accepts the higher Law of Light will go on into the many orders of the Hierarchies. These orders are called (by the Council of Nine) the Ishirn, the Order of the Melekim (Order of Kingship), the Order of the B'nai Elohim, the Order of the Elohim, the Order of the Ophanzrn, all the way up to the Hyos Ha Koidesh, where one functions as a non-evolv- ing pure thought - form; and this pure thought - form can enter any kingdom of matter - energy. 64 When man was cut off from the Hierarchies, the sciences of the earth were likewise cut off from the master blueprint, dividing the lan - guage of Light and gravitational waves from the vibratory channels of man. Thus, the spiritualist or the faithist began to use the \"meta- sciences, \" the half - life vibration of Metatron. 65 The ancient Egyptian scien - tists once used the word \" On, \" the place where Light transfiguration redeemed the body of Osiris in this KEY 107 59 - 72 half - life of death and resurrection. The priesthoods who carried on the intellectual notions of Light were , initiated into the ancient Academy of On.\\ 66 This initiation continues through the teachings of Enoch and through the teachings of the prophet Joseph, where Or, the Light of the Hierarchy, has come to work through \" On \" ecumenically as the Church of Moroni. 67 If we are able to take the knowledge of the Egyptian docu - ments of Light and fuse together a pulsating geometry of a thought- form with a given color, placing them together on the right vibra - tion of consciousness, then the ex - perience of going into other worlds through the Pyramid is revealed. 68 If we are able to take the Eastern documents of Light and code ourselves into the radiations of Light, then we will be able to see the Pyramids of Light in a field of alignment with the legionnaires of \"Takl'-Orion which exists in ethereal dimensions within the Takla Makan Basin. 69 All the documents of Light are keys to the grids of the Earth which will be opened so we can ascend to the \" higher worlds. \" 70 We will have the power to enter into the \" higher unity \" of being which we have lost. 71 Because we have lost the knowledge of the key name to enter the throne of a pyramid crea - tion, we have retained only limited names of consciousness expression; thus, we have crucified ourselves within three - dimensional con - sciousness. 72 Man must realize that he is delivered from material form and"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"KEY 107.72 - 74 saved only through the Office of the Christ, synchronized with the name of Metatron, one who serves the Father, rather than rebellious Lords of Light who have taken the names of divinities and disguised themselves as Gods.

Futhermore, it shows how the face of the Higher Evolu - tion is able to travel through our sun system and embody its con- ?ciousness in our solar evolution, in the body of our Lion - Sun. 2 Thus, the Pyramid - Sphinx is an educational vehicle showing how the Brotherhood of Light can Interpenetrate the pyramidal space of Man, so that the race of Man can be synthesized into new forms of light embodiment to go beyond our immediate sun system. The Sphinx symbolizes our body of \\pace and time within the Lion wlar evolution that must be con - quered by Man before he can wear tile face of brilliance and indwell in tile presence of the Master 'Ar- (liitects' of Light. 3 To teach Man, the Masters of Light only need to project their face through our solar evolution since they have evolved into Whole Light Bodies capable of using a thought - form technology to inter - penetrate our solar spectrum with their power of Light.

The Pyramid - Sphinx symbolizes how the mind of the Higher Intelligence must center itself within our solar evolution in order to educate Man to use the Magnetic lines of force and to build c~nsciousness pyramids which are the keys to open up the threshold controls necessary to leave our co~zsc~uusizess time zone, 5 Enoch further explained to me that when Man has opened the Pyramid - Sphinx with the higher"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"KEY 108.5-13 consciousness of Light and con - nected the energy entrances of the Pyramid and the sphlnx with each other, he will understand that he has completed this phase of life and is prepared for the energy ve - hicles of the Brotherhood to return and take him into the next evolutionary station. 6 He said \" Remember there is a Light energy pyramid in every evolutionary membrane. \" 7 And Enoch explained to me that the Great Pyramid is a geophysical computer showing the half - life of our local universe within the geophysical foundations of the Earth's biophysical, geophysical, and astrophysical meridians. Moreover, it is also an astrophysi - cal life station showing how the geoid function of our planet is connected with Orion which is the region for positive programming in our universe. 8 The Great Pyramid on the Earth is, in reality, in conjunction with a pyramidal energy field under the Earth which together form a diamond. From this central focal point there is a network of magnetic resonance which connects all of the pyramidal energy fields around the Earth into a relationship of an icosahedron. This icosahed - ron grid is a monolithic structure of interlocking tetrahedrons and oc - tahedrons which give the true harmonic reciprocals of Light acting on all points of the grid. 9 The true science of Magnetic astronomy is to align the Great Pyramid with the constellation Orion so as to form the \" eye focal point \" to retrieve information from all points of the grid. Thus, the Great Pyramid is a model for the light continuum of the many uni - verses connected with our Earth. With this relationship in mind we can envision how the Pyramid's unique star shafts transfer to Earth on a monumental scale the mes - sage of the Gods of the imperisha - ble stars lhmzu-'sk. The message contains the revelation of the true solar astronomy and mathematics that man must harness before he can leave the Earth's environment. 10 If we look at the Pyramid on the basis of the life shafts, we can trace evolution between our dying anti - universe on one hand and a rising regenerating universe on the other. For the Great Pyramid is an astrophysical eye between the larger positive and negative cycles of star evolution charted by the as - trophysical star shafts. These star shafts contain the resonance pat - terns of magnetohydrodynamic ac - tivities and function as cosmological calculators. 11 During previous geomagnetic cycles the North star shaft of the Great Pyramid originally pointed towards the circumpolar star of alpha Draconis and the South star shaft pointed towards the Taurus - Orion constellations. 12 These alignments reveal the Pyramid as an astrophysical computer showing the present life cycle as a recapitulation of the pre - vious life programs upon the Earth. 13 And when these star shafts will be understood, we will know that the Great Pyramid is the Eben Sh~ftiyah, the foundation stone for the Living Light upon this planet. Man will see that these star shafts also indicate when the Brotherhood of Light will return during the next space - time overlap to take the righteous from this three - dimensional creation into the next level of pyramidal intelligence, into the Many Mansion Worlds of Light. 14 Alpha Draconis represents the devouring, negative entropy which keeps the planispheres like the Earth chained to the entropy of singular sun systems, owing in - telligence to be dev ured by the 2 body of the Lion-Sun, were it not for the intervention of the Ophanim into this furnace of fire. 15 Orion must be understood as giving forth the positive sword of Light to cut through the Magnetic fields of biological limitation. We must understand the Lords of Light from Orion as giving us this con - sciousness model of the solar- sphinx to rise to a new - born crea - tion beyond the negative energy of the immediate magnetic fields. Man must understand why the ancients regarded Orion, the region as the princely region among the stars. As it is said in the Pyramid Texfs, \" Orion, the Father of the Gods, has given a certificate of life creation as a greater power. \" 16 The Pyramid Texfs also speaks of the builders of the Pyramid, the Nine, who program - med in the direction of Orion: \" In your name of Dweller in Orion, with a season in the sky and a sea - son on earth. 0 Osiris, turn your face and look on this King, for your seed which issued from you is effective. \" And another text gives forth the sacred message, \" The sky conceiveth thee together with Orion, the dawn beareth thee to - gether with Orion. Live the one who liveth at the order of the gods and S O will thou live, \" KEY 108 13 - 20 17 These three fragments from the ancient Egyptian scriptures of Light show the direct relationship , between the Pyramid and Orion through the body of death and resurrection of the Ascended Mas - ter Osiris. And as we look deeper at the meaning of the Pyramid, we are to understand how it gives the model for human consciousness programming and consciousness resurrection* For in it we have the mathematics of why the ancients set the head of the soul journeyer facing south at the bottom of the Mastabah shafts, for it was to help the soul join the Lords of Light of Orion. 18 Thus, the star shafts in the Great Pyramid are intended as the introductory ways of consciousness preparation, whereby not only Osiris's soul but the souls of all those who have been initiated into the Pyramid might actually ascend to join the Masters, Enoch, Heru- Ur, Tehuti, and all Masters who serve the Councils of Light in Orion. 19 To this end, the Pyramid can be understood as the model for consciousness exodus from one three - dimensional time - set within the Earth's magnetic fields into a multi - dimensional evolution con - trolled by Orion, and the regions of the Higher Intelligence. This is the sacred region of the sky the Egyp - tians coded 'Sak,' the Tibetans called 'Tak,' and the Hebrews called 'Kesil.

The mixing arrangement"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"KEY 108 20-25 is used to measure the geophysical cycles of change, polar wanderings, tectonic changes, and activates magnetic - gravitational wave cod - ing~ for consciousness deliverance. Furthermore, the Great Pyramid was built before the last geophysi - cal shift to instruct man in the awesome and regenerating architec - ture of cataclysmic geology. 21 There exists a sacred formula to be read on different levels to function as a mathematical key. The formula is expressed as: I Gas told that the Higher Evolution in working with the grid structure of the Great Pyramid used this formula to coordinate the Great Pyramid with the other grids of Light. The formula includes the following mathematical arrange - ments: 1.3.1, 1.1.1, 9.3.9, 9.1.9 (where 1 and 9 are superimposed upon the same space). This ar - rangement can be used to create electromagnetic propagation func - tions in the midst of the lattice formation. 22 The Great Pyramid is, once again, being activated to coordinate with the other grids on this planet. When this is completed the grids will be opened to the Heavenly Jerusalem. We will no longer be earth - bound but will pass through the magnetic fields of change. We will, once again, partake in the \" story \" of the Exodus. The biblical Exodus is a micro - astrophysical and astronomical model that the enlightened children of God will use on their journey towards the greater universe. For only the chil - dren of God have the conscious - ness of the pyramidal initiate so they can join the Lords of Light in the regions of 'Sak,' the region of the higher star evolution, in surviv - ing the Earth's diminishing light- life zone. 23 As Man begins to unlock the Mysteries of the Great Pyramid in relationship to biblical teaching he will understand why Enoch told me that within the Great Pyramid, within a different energy field, the biochemical functions of the body of Moses and Jesus can be found, for they are the two highest incar - nate manifestations of Jehovah within this present cycle. Enoch said they are within the Pyramid to show that the Pyramid is the Ebeiz Sheffiyah, the foundation stone, or the resonance eye for soul manifes - tation connecting the Office of the Christ with this planet. And when the Pyramid is reactivated they will return as the capstone. They will return to demonstrate the scientific and spiritual unity of all Ascended Masters. 24 In this fulfillment of proph - esy, Moses and Jesus will return with UrieI - the Creator of the Inner Light, Metatron - the Creator of the Outer Light, and Michael - the Creator of this local universe, for this is the return of the programmers who do the Father's Will of ingathering the righteous from the Earth who will be \" graduated 1 ' to go to other Light - Life worlds. 25 Thus, the Christ conscious - ness will indwell in the conscious - ness of Man who is centered within the pyramid, for only he will be able to leave his physical pyramidal life zone behind. He will be able to take the exodus across the \" Red Sear1' the light vibrations of his sun system into the Sea of Crystal, into the land of Israel, the land of the cons iousness of Light which freely serves the Father in the Many Ma sion Worlds of Light. 26 And the pbysical Pyramid in Egypt is part of a single energy grid that connects with the land of Israel. Enoch explained that just as Egypt contains the architecture of the physical astronomical Pyramid of Man's destiny in space, Israel contains the spiritual architecture of the Pyramid in its scriptures of the Torah Or. The Torah Or gives man the ability to fashion a pyramidal capstone of Light consciousness within his body, for this is the necessary completion (of his body) if he is to merge his spiritual energy with the Christ Light of the Higher Evolution. 27 When the scripture of Israel is combined with the pyramidal ar - chitecture of Egypt, the conscious - ness pyramid and the physical pyramid of the Earth will become as one total unity. This pyramidal unity explains why Joseph, as the offspring of Jacob, and Jesus were initiated into the Pyramid in Egypt, and why \" Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of Egypt \" (Acts 7:22). Under their leadership' the race of Israel, created in Egypt under the command of Jehovah, was to go forth to demonstrate the unity with the Father and Mother elements of physical and spiritual birth and rebirth. This has been the process of the old program being brought to completion. In the New Age, we will go beyond the plan - etary level of evolution into the KEY 108 25 - 30 myriad star kingdoms of the Infi - nite Way. 28 The reprogramming of the physical consciousness will take place in twelve major crystalline regions around the Earth. These twelve major regions are all fo - cused towards the Great Pyramid which is the central alignment for major star positions controlling the geomagnetic grids of the earth. Into these twelve pyramidal regions the capstone of Light will come down to complete the changing of the spiritual hierarchy. This will be the time when the twelve tribes of the physical Israel and the twelve con- sciousness levels of the spiritual Is- rael will unite around each man - ifestation of the Ebeiz Slzetti~jal~. 29 When you understand the grid structure of the Earth you will see how the Great Pyramid is the central cornerstone within the New Jerusalem which connects the pyramidal capstone of the Mer- kabah vehicle (under the Order of Melchizedek), with the twelve con - sciousness Light zones on this planet. 30 Before this comes to pass, the Great Pyramid will be decoded and all previous pyramidal science from the squaring of the circle to calculating distant star positions will be understood in relationship to the cosmic Pyramid of Orion, and the cradle model of our uni - verse - the Pleiades which gov - erns the higher timepieces, the cosmic clocks. The mathematical harmonies coded within the Gfeat Pyramid create an invisible time - piece of Higher Evolutionary movements as a clock placed on the face of the Great Pyramid. These mathematics tell us the angle"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"KEY 108. 30-36 of the slope of the outside of the Great Pyramid is 51Â°51'14.3'1 The altitude of the Great Pyramid is to the length of one side of the base as one is to l/21~(Pi). The length of the Ante - Chamber multiplied by 100 is 11,626.02 Pyramid inches. Using this figure as the diameter of a circle or the altitude of the Pyramid as the radius of a circle, the circle is equal in area to a square whose side is 101303.30 Pyramid inches in length l thus squaring the circle. 31 The squaring of the circle is one of the greatest mathematical problems known in the C~~CU~US of the ancient Egyptian priest- scientists who were concerned with the greater solar movement, for it allowed them to use the astrophys - ical tables glven by the Higher Evolution which were placed in the Pyramid. These showed how the human race within the squaring of the circle is directly related to Kimuh, the Pleiades. 32 The key solution is the understanding of how terrestrial and solar movement are tied to - gether in the greater \" Precession of the Equinoxes \" - the 26,000 year cycle which connects with Kimah, the cradle from which our em - bryonic cycles of time are calculated by the Higher Evolution. Thus, this precession of the equinoxes is the length of time required for our solar system to make one complete revolution around the Pleiades, our greater parent sun, which calculates to a period of 25,827.5 years. 33 The Great Pyramid contains the distance from the Earth to the sun - the solar energy form of local creation, but the relationship to the cradle and throne of our consciousness cycle of creation is given in four codes of the physical pyramid: 33' - 1 Each of the two base- diagonals of the Great Pyramid taken together equals 25,827.5, the Precession of the Equinoxes, at the rate of an inch per year. 33' - 2 The width of the Grand Gallery of the Great Pyramid times 100~ (as 3.14159) equals 25,827.5, the Precession of the Equinoxes. 33' - 3 Twice the altitude of the Great Pyramid lying above the floor - plane of the King's Chamber times n (Pi) equals 25,827.5, the Precession of the Equinoxes. 33' - 4 The King's Chamber is situated on the 50th plane of masonry in the Great Pyramid. The outside surface perimeter at this level in original Pyramid inches equals 25,827.5, the length of the Precession of the Equinoxes. 34 In order to understand the deeper significance of the numer - ous codes of the Pyramid within the magnetic fields, we must un - derstand that the models which eventually constituted the Great Pyramid were built over cycles of 36,000, 24,000, 18,000, 12,000, and 6,000 years by the Lords of Light. 35 Under the direction of Enoch, Heru - Ur, and Tehuti, the Lords of Light built the Pyramid from the top down by vehicle con - trol, that is, out of the magnetic- etheric spheres by Magnetic flux line controls. 36 The earlier pyramidal designs were built according to the previ - ous Gravitational - Magnetic shells of the Earth which exist on the higher planes. The present Great Pyramid was built while a Merkabah vehicle of Light in the shape of a pyramid was stationed in the basin at Giza creating the surrounding energy fields which could move the magnetic lines of force and the physical materials. \", 37 The Merkabah wag, then ex - emplified in the Sphinx which symbolized how the Higher Evolu - tion in the appearance of man could travel through the solar spec - trum of creation. 38 Enoch explained to me how the geometrical construct of the Pyramid stands as a testimony to his first appearance upon the planet and it also contains the Mys - tery of the capstone which is to be understood at the return of Enoch. 39 The Great Pyramid's base side is constructed with a length of 365.242 Hebrew sacred cubits. This number (carrying a floating deci - mal) also mathematically appears in other places in the Pyramid and is considered one of the most impor - tant numbers \" in stone. \" 40 Not only is this the number of days of our solar year, but it is also the number expressed in dec - imals that Enoch lived on Earth, that is, 365 years, 88 days, 9 hours according to the ancient texts. Thus, Enoch's cosmological time cycle is coded within the Enoch cir - cle which can be expressed numerically as 365.242. 41 Our present cycle is only one of many important cosmological cy - cles which must be understood in the true astronomy of the Magnetic cycles of the planispheres. This in - cludes the iotation of the Earth in relationship to the magnetic equator of Saturn using the for - mula of the spiritual mathematical set of 101. 42 Moreover, man must see KEY 208.36-47 how the Pyramid shows the salient features of successive geophysical changes upon our planet and when . the magnetic parameters of our solar system will enter an elec - tromagnetic null zone. 43 This blueprint of geophysical change is personified by the Great Pyramid upon the face of the Earth, interfaced with the other geomagnetic pyramidal points of the Earth. 44 The Pyramid was built out of the Magnetic flux line controls in relationship to a Magnetic blueprint conceived in relationship to the belt of Orion and the sacred numbers 1335 and 1290, the additional func - tions of magnetic displacement that take place at the end of magnetic cycles. 45 These sacred numbers show the missing functions of the great magnetic shifts which give the geomagnetic alignment of the grids of the northern hemisphere, the southern hemisphere, and the sur - rounding light grids which come together at the point of 30'-36' Longitude E. and 30'-33' Latitude N. 46 This point in the Earth is the interlocking key to a vast immortal structural pattern operating be - tween the heavens and the earth. This structure is not only composed of the icosahedron geometry con - necting the grid points on the Earth, but also includes pentagon arrangements which form a do - decahedron geometry superim - posed on a different energy level around the Earth. 47 Furthermore, those two lat - tices are surrounded by a hexahed - ron which transmits divine cube functions and is in conjunction"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"- -- - KEY 108-47-57 with our Sun supporting the energy functions of the Earth. 48 Through this complex crys- talline form, human life and vari - ous degrees of extraterrestrial life can all share the local life space in the energy fields of the same orb only on different lattice grids. 49 Seen from the perspective of the Higher Evolution, life upon this planetary orb is a radiated series of biological events primarily lattice- like in nature. Through the crystal - line lattice, the Higher Evolution controls the various biological kingdoms by organizing the inter- gravitational and interradiational ef - fects of lattice merging with lattice. 50 The frequency modulations of the Higher Evolution can allow seed populations to climb \" Jacob's ladder \" into the next realm of the crystalline staircase which eventu - ally leads from this planetary orb into other lattice dimensions which we cannot even see at this time. 51 Through these grids the Higher Evolution conducts its bioengineering and transmits in - formation to the members of the human race who are sensitized to these geometric harmonics. 52 Moreover, in the larger blue - print of creation, the Pyramid is the blueprint for a double helix be - tween a blue and white star system and our solar magnetohydrodynamic program, whereby mutual pro - gramming allows pyramidal coordi - nates to structure consciousness evolution to go on. 53 Besides this stellar evolution which is coded within the Pyramid there is a companion change re - flecting consciousness evolution. Here, the consciousness continuum from our star evolution to a blue white star evolution is manifested through the code ZH-T: the pyram - idal energy consciousness which rests over the heads of the initiates enabling them to combine multiple pyramid (energy) functions in dif - ferent energy levels of creation. 54 This ability to function with multiple levels of intelligence makes use of the wisdom of Ihmzv-'sk, the Lords of Central Con - trol, to attune and project con - sciousness thought - forms from one evolutionary pyramidal face to another energy field. This is done by the modulation of gravitational waves transmitted through a pyramidal energy template that is centered over the head. (This con - sciousness template uses spiritual energy as opposed to the natural pyramidal energy vibrations of the planet.) 55 The ZH.T code is the code of communication given from Central Control to those who are commit - ted to freeing man from the rounds of earth - bound evolutions. 56 The placing of the crystal pyramidal energy cap over the crown chakra of an evolving hu - manity demonstrates how the con - sciousness of Man can be attached to other space - time dimensions so as to experience the face forms of the Lords of Light, who will recon - struct this present biochemical program to be in tune with the changing electromagnetic fre - quency. 57 In terms of the sacred twelve degrees in \" the middle of the earth, \" the region of the golden belt 27'-39' Latitude N.

(See Glossary: Urnma.) ing the 6-6-6. 14 The key speaks of evolution - ary star time, both in terms of the physical dimension of what we measure as cubic space, as well as in terms of the destruction of three - dimensional universes. 15 The key is directed to human astrophysics; it is speaking of the Black Cube, the Kabba in Mecca, as showing in meta - particles how star universes must be destroyed as they pass through the three - dimensional main sequence phase if they do not have a greater star power of regenesis. Dark space ex - ists where star evolution is no longer possible without controlled intervention. This is known as a degenerate phase in star evolution. 16 By the colliding of two galax - ies which accelerates electrons and positrons, anti - matter can be an - nihilated, which is calculated to the total of about ergs per second in radiated energy. 17 In the Sanskrit texts we have one of the highest truths revealed in the Maha - Ratri which shows eternal time and the transition of matter as the measure of the eter - nal night. Thus, time is the eternal ocean of silence from which all the secondary cycles of time are formed as they interact with the micropar- ticles of crystal ever present in the universe, beginning with the cycles of creation and including all the cy - cles which determine the existence of the universe. 18 The Maha - Ratri stands upon the corpse of the ruined - evolving universe, which is beyond any three - dimensional physical plane. 19 Because this ruined - evolving universe contains the body material of all things yet beyond form, it is beyond \\ th body definition. In so far as it is ^beyond the three - dimensional definition of life it is a corpse unto the living function of light which Man considers the be - ginning. It is a continuous explo - sion of all matter. 20 The second phase is Krodha - Ratri, which is the waste of the boundless all - devouring time. 21 Time appears in this evolu - tion as a cosmic immensity, a source of light, a combustion. And so in the night of time, which is still in a state of universal dissolu- t~on, light, the first combustion, appears as a star beginning. 22 This light is the nature, the source of all thought; for thought is an energy, a combustion of star evolution, and the instrument of knowledge illuminating the object of star evolution. 23 We see in the model of the Night of Eternity, the Maha - Ratri, life - giving plasma spiraling in many directions. The plasma, then is al - lowed to come together when it hits an energy field which will im - part to it shape and structure. 24 This field is something akin to what man calls in physics Boltzman's Law, the creation of gaseous particles or clouds which begin to form out of the spirals of plasma turbulence. 25 The galaxies and anti- galaxies, in the third dimension, begin to take on the dimension which humans recognize as star evolution; namely, the spiraling of form within cubic space necessary to materalize a blue - white star field within a three - dimensional model. 26 The third night of evolution, Divya - Ratri, is the formation of a singular sun system moving within KEY IO'J I()-34 the initial energy field to become the circular - cubic matrix, the central form in the magnetic fields of tur - bulence. 27 And as it spirals out of the energy field we understand how stars condense out of a galactic cloud by gravitational collapse. At this stage of star evolution, matter and anti - matter have separated due to radiation pressure. 28 At some point in time within star evolution, the star, either in the matter or the anti - matter phase, has condensed sufficiently to pro - duce enough heat for nuclear fu - sion to occur. 29 And in the interior of the star field the heavy elements are produced from the original hy - drogen and helium until they in - teract to form iron. 30 Some of these stars become the super - novas that explode and scatter the elements throughout the universe, throughout the galaxy, or throughout whatever dimension the star happens to be participating in as an energy focus. 31 Other stars, however, evolve a conic structure of physics which clearly appears within the three - dimensional cubic form. This conic - spherical projection quickly leaves the three - dimensional cubic form due to radiation pressure. 32 Eastern science teaches that the energy field which is beyond the three - dimensional cubic form is the Night of Realization, the higher knowledge; Enoch calls this the fourth dimension. 33 The fourth stage of evolution is Siddha - Ratri, where the universe makes way for a greater energy flow, a greater offering of creation. 34 It is a time when inter - stellar"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"KEY 10') 34 - 48 gas is drawn toward other stars. This inter - stellar gas, as well as the energy field connected with it, forms the whirling mass - forming eddy currents and gas centers which condense around the given singular sun system. 35 The quantities of gas in most cases are not sufficient to go through gravitational collapse or generate enough heat to create a star, and yet the condensed masses are able to form the planetary sys - tems revolving around the parent star. 36 It is within the fourth- dimensional construct that we un - derstand how the planetary satel - lites of creation really feed off the instructional codes of the parent star. Within this code of ionization is the framework necessary to materialize thought generation which is constantly being pulsated through this network of energy. 37 Every kingdom of intelli - gence of chemical matter, with its respective star or parent star, and with its respective star evolutionary phase, passes into the Vira - Ratri or the Night of Courage, where it is able to spiral through itself. 38 In this fifth stage of evolu - tion, the sun pours into the world and takes from it the essence to continue its evolution. 39 The solar radiation in the Eastern texts is compared with a perpetual beheading of the sun; and, as such, the beheading rep - resents the life - giving and life- destroying power of the sun. 40 The world depends for its sustenance on burning and destruc - tive light. 41 The Lord tells us concerning this evolution that \" Her left foot forward in battle, she holds her severed head with a knife. Naked she drinks voluptuously at the stream of the blood nectar flowing from her beloved body. \" 42 We see in this picture the necessity of a given planetary mind system, or kingdom of intelligence, to separate from its sun system be - fore the sun system destroys that planetary creation or that planetary field of intelligence. 43 Enoch told me that stars are not the only source of elements beyond atomic structure. 44 Stellar radiations and cosmic ray bombardment produce chemical and physical reactions. These radia - tions may affect members of the planetary family by generating complex organic molecules from simple inorganic substances, giving rise to a vast variety of intelli - gences. 45 In cases where the earth type of life has evolved, radiation is necessary for the process of photosynthesis, from which all higher forms of physical life derive their energy. 46 It is at this point that the life intelligence must decide if it has the ability to go through cubic life space, to become identified with a higher evolutionary star seed intel - ligence in a neighboring star sys - tem and join in co - participation as a new member of a galactic family. 47 If it does this it proceeds from its parent star, to a secondary star, and into a pluralistic form of galactic creation of many suns; if it does not mutate into multi - dimensional star directions, it is devoured and destroyed. 48 The Chinese recognize in their texts that the Lords of Light govern from double stars, as well as from multiple star systems. 49 The intelligence in the lower heavens is 'chained' to its im - mediate sun system's parameters which will be destroyed through the evolving, spiraling black cube - the cubic space where star energy eats up its own physical by - products, its own physical crea - tion, and its own creative intelli - gence. 50 To go into negative or de - structive evolutions and redeem or reprogram these evolutions requires the power of the Zohar of the Higher Evolution, or the Phowa, the consciousness - threshold energy which is stronger than the sun's energy. This higher Light serves as a new channel whereby the trans - mutation of the specie can take place. Thus, the specie can be taken off its planetary disc and go into other star fields before the sun system destroys its chemical order of life intelligence. 51 This brings us, then, to the sixth field of evolution, known as the Kala - Ratri in the Indian texts (and its counterpart in Tibetan texts), which is the sudden end of a world system - the culmination of a process that had been going on for a long time. 52 And the destruction begins with the first moment of existence. It begins at a point when all of the cycles are brought together to give forth the picture of a thousand newly risen suns: the death of the lower sun creation and the birth of the multiple sun creations. 53 The words of the Lords which give this picture speak as follows: \" Softly smiling you shine with a crimson glow which may be KEY 109-48-58 compared with a thousand newly risen suns. You wear a silken veil and a garland of skulls. \" 54 This garland - skull illustrates Golgotha, the destruction of the spiritual sun energy - the Jesus, with the energy of the Son of Light - the Christos, or the Zohar energy which descends on the planetary mind as a new evolution - ary membrane upon the skull of the planet. At the end of time the Higher Evolutionary threshold of intelligence working with the Earth's astrochemical sun, will come together for the necessary resurrection and programming beyond the time - space of the Kabba - Golgotha, the immediate zone of life and death. 55 This cosmology is to be seen in the wearing of the Black Cube or Tephillin-Baith on the forehead of the Jewish mystic, who nullifies the power of the Black Cube worn over his third eye, by the interpenetra - tion of the Torah scripture of Light within the Cube. Here, the pro - gram of Light from the Word of God purifies the mind and opens it up to the Splendor of the Universe. 56 In the cosmology of the Earth, this means that without a new program of spiraling light from the intelligences connected with the program Israel, our sun will have to use up its supply of fuel, for it cannot depend on ther - mal pressure to balance the force of gravity indefinitely. 57 A star of a given galaxy may die by one of three processes, ac - cording to contemporary physics: 58 The first process is gravita - tional collapse or contraction. When hydrogen becomes scarce and no longer reacts within the star, the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"KEY 209 58 - 72 source of energy vanishes. When the energy is no longer generated, the radiation pressure drops sharply and gravitation takes over to collapse the star. Therefore, there occurs an in - fall of matter and photons, towards the center of the star. 59 The energy generated by gravitational collapse is much greater than the fusion reaction to create energy, thus the star is sub - jected to extremely high internal pressures. The result is that the star grows in size until it is suffi - cient to permit more radiation to leak out. When the star collapses, the temperature rises sharply in the core of the star and the core con - tinues to expand to about one - half the mass of the star. 60 The star now enters a new phase where helium reacts with carbon. This is an energy produc - ing process, which causes the radi - ation pressure to counter gravity, and prevents some stars from com - pletely phasing out. 61 Thus, the star might begin to return to its normal size, but this shrinking process triggers oscilla - tions which may begin the nova phase of its evolution. 62 Another process of star death is the nova phase, which is a nuclear explosion ejecting core materials and forming heavy ele - ments which use up the star's energy supply. This is observed by the star's increasing luminosity from hundreds of thousands to hundreds of millions of times. 63 The third process is the white dwarf, a star that has ex - hausted most or all of its nuclear fuel and is undergoing the Night of Frustration, for it nears the final stage of its evolution. 64 The seventh field of star evolution is the Night of Frustra- tion, the Darvna-Ratri, which ex - plains why the planetary intelli - gence of man cannot get beyond its seven-fold nature of the cycles of change. 65 Man is chained to his geomagnetic cycles, whether it is the seven days of creation working with the earthly cosmologies; 66 whether it is seven years within the aging process of his body; 67 or whether it is the math - ematics of seven seconds, milli - seconds, or nano - seconds before the phosphene explosions occur to the inner dimensions of his mind. 68 The Night of Frustration is a point at which the physical order of the mind must recognize that even star evolution does not share any singular space and time forever. 69 A portion of that star evolu - tion is also in your mind because the star which you really see out there you cannot absolutely experi - ence except within your mind. 70 So that star system or that sun system has already an energy force field of its own phase break - ing up or evolving with a math - ematical consistency within you be - cause you are the materialization of the greater phase on a smaller scale. 71 We are told that once all is destroyed the universe goes up in smoke. Hence, the power of ulti - mate destruction of the material phase of the Darvna - Ratri, is called the smoky one, or the hell, the Dhumavati. 72 The Dhumavati'is star col - lapse, beginning slowly and then proceeding more rapidly when the star surface has a temperature of at least several thousand degrees cen - tigrade and continues to emit photons. 73 The star then spirals through its cubic dimension as its orbits of energy are realigned. 74 And this spiral into a new electromagnetic orbital level of energy is not only true for all phases of photon amplification, but includes phases of anti - photon am - plification even within the body universe, which creates both the free and slave satellites of the earth universe and the star universe. 75 During this phase the human evolution needs the help of the Mid - Way Councils of Light to di - rect its thought waves. Our physi - cal intelligence must prepare itself for the greater space - time changes that are taking place within the human kingdom of intelligence and all the other kingdoms of intelli - gence which appear when the human universe is being destroyed. 76 And when the other uni - verses collectively adapt themselves to our finite human universe in the eighth stage, where our finite order and the infinite cross, the One and the Many, the One and the Many- thousand, or the One and the Many - Million systems of intelli - gence all interconnect with the mil - lennium in Man's search for Paradise. Man, then, sees how he is part of the thousand space - time cells of Redemptive creation which brings about the Age of Peace as the Night of Frustration is passed. 77 Man recognizes in this greater peace that there is no death, but only a recycling of KEY 709 72 - 83 energy within a variety of evolu- tions which occur. (The tenth stage brings the synthesis of the One into the Many and the Many into the One.) 78 The eighth stage, the Vira- Ratri, is known as the Second Night of Courage, the conscious - ness star birth or rebirth which re - fers to the collapsing star progres - sions, where photon orbits are in - terconnected with the valences of the collapsing body or collapsing star system. 79 Until the star contracts to 1.5 times its gravitational radius - a point called the first critical stage, some photons are still emitted from the surface of the star; these escape into space and can be seen by the distant observer. 80 Photons emitted on a tangent from the star's surface at the first critical stage are caught in a spherical cloud from which they slowly leak for millions of years. 81 Similarly, there are forms or thought - forms of kingdoms of crea - tion that may be caught between star universes just as in the physi - cal kingdom, man, in some in - stances of spiritual evolution, can be caught between his embodi - ments. 82 In this stage of physical tran - sition, if man has no-t connected with his eighth chakra, he can only exist on one chakra of thought- form continuation or in phases which can be recognized as several fragmented thought - forms in the ethereal form, or in transparency, neither of which is sufficient to-in- corporate him into the material phase of existence. 83 This interphase evolution represents fallen Masters of knowl-"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"KEY 109.83-93 edge and thought - forms from lower creations which have been de - stroyed on this planet; yet they have survived because they are within realms of photon amplifica - tion which still administer to the kingdoms comprising the greater gravitational radius connecting our physical life station - planet Earth - with realms of creation that we cannot see but which share our same local life space. 84 The ninth evolution is the Night of Delusion, the Moha - Ratri, in which the time spectrum is seen as an anti - life force and in which, according to this scripture of Light, the star shines like a blue lotus re - sembling the forest fire consuming the abode of the demons. 85 It is a time when the star continues to collapse in such a way that the immediate star field be - comes so intense that all photons are drawn toward the gravitational radius. Here the star's karma has allowed for star intelligence to be recycled with the loss of conscious - ness evolutionary programs. 86 The second critical stage is reached as the star begins to col - lapse within its gravitational radius. At this point only photons which leave perpendicular to the surface can escape, and these form once again a leaking cloud just outside the gravitational radius. 87 But there is an instant fol - lowing the second critical stage when the star has collapsed within the Schwarzchild radius, and no photons can escape. 88 The Phowa scriptures of Light say that at the first stage the intelligence must leave the star, be - fore it explodes or goes supernova. 89 It is a time when Man must use the knowledge which the Chinese and Tibetan Lords have marked with the ideographic sym - bols T, L, and V representing a mirror of a collapsing star field. The mirror allows the spiritual Man to see the future of life through the formula of how matter is re - materialized within a new energy time set. This enables the forms of one time set to appear in another time set through direct bio - location. 90 It is a time when the \"I\", or the time factors in different star evolutions form the angles where 'V', or the vector factors of star evolutions, cross in their orbital path. 'L' is the length of inner- penetration which allows the mat - ter of one energy field to re - materialize in another energy field. The vector factors all line up so that one energy universe suddenly appears within another. At this time, one kingdom of intelligence can suddenly appear within another. 91 Man who goes on, crosses his spectrum, his dying star space, and enters the tenth level called Maha-Ratri, the Night of Splendor. 92 The scriptures of Light ex - plain that Kamala, or the lotus girl, is the consort of the everlasting Siva, the Night of Eternity, who protects the world as the earth mother, the earth womb of all chemical creation and growth. She is identified with Vishnu, the phys - ical form that the Lord of Light or the higher mind puts on as it materializes its thought - form into the physical chemical body of a given sun system. 93 The dimension of splendor cannot exist within the universe without the Sea of Crystal, the multitudes of sun systems reflect - ing higher intelligence. 94 And if one sun seeks simply its own splendor, it must exist in the Night of Darkness out on the edge of its respective galaxy, living in darkness rather than in the pluralistic light, the Many in One Light. 95 And from this point on, the star collapses to zero volume and may create a hole as it spirals into infinite mass. 96 The hole created by the sun's singularity provides a tunnel into another universe or a different part of the same universe. Meta- matter then comes bubbling out of the space on the other side of its tunnel as its negative spiral begins to expand.

At the same time I was instructed to use Sanskrit and Tibetan fire letters to unify all the biochemical lan - guages working vertically in the human body. Finally, I was in - structed to use the Hebrew fire let - ters, sacred energy sounds, and thought - forms of Light to connect with the intelligences of the Pleiades and Orion, unifying all crystalline languages of the third eye so as to open the template of the mind for the Eternal Light. 3 Enoch said that if all five lan - guages were used simultaneously, they would activate the picto - graphic communication of the Brotherhood within the brain; they would create a mental time warp and quicken the Light Body Over- self to dome within the human vessel of consciousness experience. These languages form a grid con - necting the Higher I AM con - sciousness of Light with the human I AM consciousness of Light through a cosmic light vibration. 4 Spiritual Man is to under - stand that this grid is formed by the languages which create hori - zontal (Egyptian - Chinese) and ver - tical (Sanskrit - Tibetan) energy pat - terns. 5 These, in turn, are activated by the divine vector (Hebrew) created by the focused Light force and by the imprinting of the divine fire letters (or energy sounds) upon the vertical and horizontal grid. 6 The horizontal pattern connects with the mental energies that are part of an interchange of knowl - edge with the immediate life situa - tion on the plane of human experi - ence. 7 The interchange goes on within you through a series of light pictographs which allow for multi- levels of external knowledge to be internalized and rapidly encoded beyond that which is usually spoken. 8 This internalization is granted through the mental process en - coded upon this plane of experi - ence."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"KEY III) 9-18 9 Yet, this knowledge cannot be fully understood without the vertical patterns which form the connecting links from the lower dimensions of sensory awareness, through this plane of experience into the higher dimensions that are of an infinite quality of joy. 10 These two patterns form the grid which is continually undergo - ing individual evolution so that the individual progresses to the higher cosmic levels of soul advancement. However, because of the limitations of the lower worlds these grids are continually shifted to accommodate new environments of birth and re - birth. 11 Finally, when the organism has reached the point where the higher soul transplant can take place, the grids open to the pres - ence of a third grid - like pattern, which is a divine Light force. 12 This divine Light pattern allows for spiritual planes to be fully connected with the body and the body to assimilate the Mes - sianic experience of the Pentecostal flame. 13 In consequence, all experi - ences of life are fully activated and made possible to the human form which goes into physical union with the Divine Self. 14 Hence, this cosmic vibration connects the Higher I AM con - sciousness with the human I AM consciousness through the five body vehicles of Light: the elec - tromagnetic body, the epi - kinetic body, the eka body of many rel - ativities, the inner body of Gema - tria, and the outer body of Zohar. They are synthesized so completely that all five bodies are drawn up through the crown chakra becom - ing one with the Eternal Light. 15 When this happens the con - sciousness of every chemical cell is brought up through the body, through the seven chakras, and goes into a hovering light pyramid over the mind, in the area of the eighth chakra. When this is com - pleted, the ninth and tenth chakra grids in conjunction with the eighth chakra template, can bring through all the information from previous civilizations. (The eighth chakra acts as a sign for those who work with the Brotherhood of Light.) 16 This is the completion of the grid which allows the mind to speak on all seven levels and al - lows the specie to go beyond its present soul program. Thus, Heb - rew, in our planetary program, is the final balance necessary to con - nect the soul patterns of the first Adam Kadmon with the patterns of Redemptive Creation. 17 And it was explained to me that the planetary universes must live through the programs of the star scriptures from the original codes of Egyptian-Chinese- Sanskrit - Tibetan and Hebrew that were given to teach us the lessons of universal planetary creation and destruction within the Light of Life. 18 When I was taken into Mer- kabah, I, Jacob was shown how the fallen legions of Semjaza were dis - banded and dispatched to three - dimensional worlds like Earth. Still, out of the fallen mixtures of the creative experiments, everything advances to newborn generations, and the lessons of some star uni - verses are replayed identically in smaller planetary universes. The smaller planetary universes, with - out completely destroying them - selves must learn the lessons of the greater star universes. 19 And as we go through our Omega point, we once again un - derstand what was encoded in the Alpha phase of the original star programs given in our birth of des - tiny. And when you use the divine names from all these five languages together, like Amen - Ptah - Egyp - tian, Phowa - Tibetan, Kuan - Yin - Chinese, Gabriel - Hebrew, and Buddha - Sanskrit, as mantra seed syllables, you set up a con - sciousness wavelength of light that resonates with all five bodies within you. Language, here, is a language of energy vibration formed by carefully selected seed mantras. 20 The mantra vibrations raise the body consciousness into the seed crystal mind so that it spirals out of our consciousness paradigm which is controlled by the energy of the black cube. And by going through the Light pyramids on this life station, the mind of conscious - ness is able to pass from lower pyramidal creation into greater light - life stations on other dimen - sional or Metatronic levels of crea - tion. 21 You can then enter into that dimension where all life motion be - comes the Eternal unfoldment, where all is currently being lived, currently being recycled, for the universe has all ideas stored in the Eternal Mind of reflection and reve - lation. All life motions are stored for replay and regathering, for use by the Ascended Masters in higher dimensions, within worlds of a thousand lotus time cells. 22 And on the physical plane, it KEY 110 18 - 27 is the subconscious world, not the conscious world, that dictates the primary order or events. 23 Key 1 - 1 - 0 delineates the ' spectrum languages, built into the subconscious, in order to connect our mind with the many light spec - trums - all at the same time - in different star kingdoms of evolu - tion. Therefore by using the five languages we can experience other spectrum manifestations of the Higher Evolution. 24 The Higher Evolution in this galaxy self - embodies its intelligence into nine time cells; we on this planetary evolution incarnate into one time cell. By using the five lan - guages to activate the glowing flame within us to fill our entire vehicle, we can experience some aspect of the nine time cells. 25 These five languages connect the five biocomputer bodies of Man with five different energy spec - trums as one unity, so that Man is able to experience the past, pres - ent, and future of all light civiliza - tions that have lived upon the Earth. He is able, through the Brothers of Light, to experience the nine time zones of this planetary creation recognized as past past, past present, past future; present past, present present, present fu - ture; future past, future present, future future. 26 Thus, Man, in connecting his mind - time warps with his Overself, can experience both the past and the future of the physical plane functioning as one. 27 And just as the Higher Evolution came down to Earth, to Ash'a in India, to the Takla Makan desert in Tibet, to Qumran in Is - rael, to On in Egypt, and to Xin"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"- - KEY 110.27 - 38 Jiang in China, so also they come down to you - through your crown chakra, your kether point, when you use the key languages as seed syllables for meditation which connect you with the Masters of Kesil - Orion Central Control. 28 These key languages connect you to the Kesil - Orion Central Control; these key languages build a grid of the living body of Light which takes you into any dimen - sion where that light focus is cur - rently being used. 29 And behold, Enoch wrote this in the language of Light - in the flame script of Israel which speaks in all tongues; a written language on a polarized flame - Lay - oo - esh - being projected into your third eye. 30 Behold, I speak to you as though I spoke from before the presence of the Paradise Sons, for I know that you shall receive my words. 31 This key speaks of the lan - guage system of Light given by the Higher Evolution to the star seed on this planet to enable this seed to go through many galactic forma - tions and transformations. 32 And through this manifesta - tion of the Word, projected thought - forms from the higher galactic kingdoms of creations materialize not only one set, but multiple sets of evolutionary king - doms of creation. 33 Therefore, there are multiple patterns of knowledge which create kingdoms in matter by virtue of being thought - forms projected beyond the kingdom of creation. These thought - forms are constantly being reseeded through language patterns throughout the immediate universe, materializing multiple energy forms. 34 All of this is revealed to us in the cosmologies of these specific language systems which were de - rived from the Ascended Masters and Lords of Light who came down to teach man not mythologi - cal symbols and psychological lin - guistics, but the actual 'thinking cosmology' and wisdom of how the greater star universes work as a consciousness unity. 35 As we examine the primary texts of all of these basic languages of star cosmologies, let us keep in mind that these texts tell us that the primary keys are given by the Ascended Masters, who come to evolve intelligence on all planetary biospheres. 36 The Pistis Sophia, conceived in Hebrew thought - patterns ren - dered into Greek and Coptic, is one of the great Gospels, for it is a true witness of the mysteries of the language Jesus used to call down his higher Body of Light in the presence of his initiated disciples. It shows how Jesus is the synthesis of the thirty - two chemical building blocks of intelligence within the Mystery of the Logos seen as the Lak Boymer, the Pillar of Light which calls down the Christ Body of Light through the thirty - third degree to inhabit the Jesus Body. 37 I was shown how the incar - nate Word of Christ became the Body of Jesus; and how the Body of Jesus and the Body of Christ came together to form the Star of David, two brilliant Pyramids of Light as a three - dimensional em - bodiment of Eternal Light. 38 The Ascension into the Eter - nal Light also is revealed in the Egyptian Pyramid Texts when the true child of God must bring pyramidal light through the Eye of Horns. 39 Enoch revealed that the Mas - ters are taken into the Pyramid to show how the physical body can be infused with the higher dimen - sions of Light working through meridians of crystalline energy fields surrounding the human net - work. 40 It was also revealed how the human mind is able to open up, within the seed crystal third eye, a time warp area of consciousness through which it, too, can work di - rectly with the Higher Evolution. 41 In the Sanskrit texts, the texts of the Rg - Vedic - Hymns to the Sun, and in the PrajGZpZramitii Siitra, we are given knowledge of how the human vehicle works as a biotransducer system which is rac - ing against electrochemical destruc - tion by the consuming energies of the sun. And these texts explain how the human vehicle is just one kingdom to be explored by the greater kingdoms of light. For in these texts we are told that our human kingdom is transformed from time to time into kingdoms of light and remade into new star vehicles. 42 We are told in the Tibetan texts of the 'Byn'chub*sems*dpa'i spyod*pa*la jugopa' how the proper repetition of the sacred words al - lows for enlightened compassion and Love so that the three jewels - the biological body, the mental body, and the spiritual body - or the three bodies of Buddha are fused together. 43 The Chinese oracle bones speak of the myriads of celestial be- KEY 110 - 38 - 48 ings who share the same body of life experience and can participate through the body of man so that he can experience the speech of the higher worlds. 44 When you use Egyptian- Hebrew - Sanskrit - Tibetan - Chinese words to prime the thought vibra - tions to flow into your third eye area, the languages will open channels of crystalline vibration within you so that your body can work directly with the Higher In - telligence through telethoiight com - munication. 45 These crystalline channels can be seen as three jewel - crystals forming a pyramid. These three crystals in your third eye area allow resonance attunement to flow between the third eye and a spiritual template over your crown chakra which is necessary to pro - ject and receive the higher thought vibrations of Light. Thus, the three pyramidal coordinates of crystal \" emanating out \" connect with the five spiritual languages \" flowing into you \" to form the vibratory field that activates the eighth chakra. 46 And the light which shineth, which giveth you Light, is through Him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same Light which quickeneth your understandings. 47 The thought - forms that are active with this evolution come only through the greater mind, for thought - forms do not originate in the body - mind of man but only are received and stored in units of ten to the tenth of thought - form poten - tial. 48 The body geometry was created to carry the \" seed crystal \" and to let the Sea of Crystal flow"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"KEY 110.48-52 through its third eye to serve the Infinite Creation. 49 These five languages of en - lightenment seeded within man give rise to the unity of the three - jewels in the third eye. 50 This synthesis of the three - jewel bodies of Light is the living experience of the Light continuum.

The Father universes give unto its Son universes of Light the Divine Inheritance which the Father rejoices in sharing with His Children. 3 The key tells us the Mind- Face of the Father emanates the Light necessary to make the human creation a tabernacle for the Meoroth - the Luminaries. 4 The body vehicle is enwrapped in twelve meridians of indwelling light, the Stralim, which connect the human face of evolution with the 365,000 space - time human rep - resentations of God which the human eye can behold. 5 The ability to see beyond the lower manifestations of God is given only to the faithful witnesses of the Word of God who ascend into the heavens through the 'Dove of the Christ', for only they are al - lowed to see the Father Rejoicing in His Creation. 6 The ancient scriptures of Zohar speak of the face of the lov - ing Father as the Ain Soph, that which is by definition beyond for - mation. 7 If we are to understand the face of the Divine, we must begin to understand the face, or the ap - pearance of the Light Body that is seen when the Higher Intelligence or the Higher Mind speaks to you within your creative cycle of crea - tion. 8 When you have seen the face of the Higher Evolution and it speaks to you, even on the inner planes, you understand how that face of the Son of Light, or the messenger of Light, is but a brain cell of Light that leads back into the Eternal Mind.

Whether we see this as the Tibetan texts speaking of the fifth world of Light coming in Lord Maitreya, the Hebrew Zohar speak - ing of the coming of the Messiah, the Lord of Light, or the Christian New Testament speaking of the coming of the Christos or the Christ, we are all reminded that this will take place in the heavens first and then on land. 16 When the Christ comes, the foremost righteous will be caught up to see the Lord in the air where they will receive the blessing of co - reigning with the Christ and the dispensation of the anointing to be brought to the saints on the earth. 17 This is a very important theme because it speaks of various time - cells of creation; it refers to the consciousness of Man which must seek to be one with the Christ vibration when the physical body, even the dust molecules of previous creation, rise into the new vibratory structure of the new di - vine Breath, and be made into the garment of Light. 18 Until that time, in the eyes of the world, one level of redemp - tion is just as relativistic as any other level of redemption. 19 This greater light threshold remakes all of negative mass into a collective relativity. And this preci - sion of light particle ingathering takes Man away from the physical DNA - RNA molecular codes and makes him into the image and similitude of a Whole Light Being. 20 Thus, the higher mind has a way of taking all of creation, Mehayyai Hametim, from dust into the cosmic dust and into the light particles out of which the next emanation of the light body is made. 21 We are told within this scroll that there is a greater light threshold which is made out of the light pulsations from every molecule of flesh, which can meas - ure, resurrect, and reprogram all of the particles of chemical life and in - telligence when a person passes through the physical state of death which is the changing of the magnetic fields. 22 Note: I Thessalonians is speaking of this in terms of a higher relativity, which is the re - leasing of the physical form, as if the physical form does not matter. It is the releasing of the matter and the image and similitude which is in the gravitationally trapped light; this allows a new image of Man to be constructed, to flow into the similitude of the luminaries who govern worlds beyond the Earth dimension. 23 This motion of going into a new image and similitude is a re- spatialization into a greater vibra - tion, with the sounding of the trumpet. This can be seen in terms of a field of intelligence opening the sky with a commanding call, calling that chemical part of crea - tion into new intelligence which is to go on to the next ordering of evolution. 24 This is not speaking of the physical judgement, the physical doom, the physical odyssey which many of the orthodox traditions have implied. 25 To the contrary, it speaks that awakened Man, in this present period of his consciousness time zone, can understand the Ain Soph, the Mind of Light which can program and reprogram instantly. 26 The mind of Man will be moved off the spatial dimension, yea, literally out of his three - dimensional light codification upon the Earth into a higher sanctifica - tion of Light, where he will be one with that threshold by virtue of his transfiguration. 27 From this scroll the Christ energy, the Christos, is seen in a special relationship with the chemistry which already exists in the next dimension - the higher in - telligence. The higher Adamic ap - pearance can be seen in the cor - poreal nature of the prophets of Light who will not only be sent into the next ordering of intelli - gence but will take with them the righteous community of Light. 28 We at this time will under - stand what man has merely under - stood for centuries symbolically, metaphysically, and mythologically: that the physical body can have a light field put around it and be taken into any dimension that the higher intelligence desires. 29 We are told in the Li KEY 172.23-34 fragments of Light in China that the bodhisattvas of Light came down, gathered their community . together and with a cry of \" Hur - rah! \" the whole community as - cended into the sky. 30 This key is speaking of how the higher Mind - Face of Father universes rejoices in Son universes. Children of Light on all planetary worlds have a phase of light gener - ation already working through them, so as to create step functions that are in phase with the pro - totype, the Adam Kadmon, so their human body and their divine body unite into one Body of Glory. 31 Thus, the five bodies of mo - tion are gathered into the body of the Christos or the Christ Gema - tria, so the elect can reign with the Christ. 32 Then the energy vehicles are gathered into the Father universe with the trumpet of God, with the vibration of the heavenly intelli - gence. The elect who are chosen to go into the higher worlds in trans - figured bodies of Light are allowed to put on the Zohar Body intelli - gence and indwell in Father uni - verses. At that time the body vehi - cles of light - life intelligence who are to work within Son universes will put on the Body of the Christ. 33 Those within the Father uni - verse rejoice in continually serving YHWH who is the Living God be - hind all Creator Gods. For YHWH is the mind of all Gods in all uni - verses. 34 This is very difficult to com - prehend without being visited by a higher Ascended Master of Light or realizing this through many, many years of becoming one with the Scriptures of Light."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"KEY 112 35 - 44 35 God is life and there are many Gods because there are many universes, but YHWH is the Infi - nite Mind coordinating all of the universes as they shape the mental patterns which allow infinite scales of evolution to occur. 36 Evolution will inherit its par - ent body of light when the uni - verse judges its Alpha - Omega Spectrum as to whether or not it is chemically prepared to go on to the next wavelength or valency; this occurs on that day when gradua - tion or judgement will overtake our life chemistry. 37 The valency of transfigura - tion takes place when the biogravi- tational energies which control the positive centropy of the DNA cod - ing of intelligence are centered within a new spectrum of star energy controlling molecular- magnetohydrodynamic fields. These fields make up a universal energy system working between galaxies, super - galaxies, super super - galaxies and all of the smaller energy in - crements of the life force in indi - vidual star systems. 38 The key of Enoch tells of the loving Father rejoicing in his crea - tion. What does the word rejoicing mean? How does one rejoice in a given creation? This is answered for us in a very simple and direct way in I Thessalonians 5: 1 - 5: \" Now as for the times (plural) and the seasons, brothers, you need no - thing to be written to you. For you yourselves know quite well that YHWHis day is coming exactly as a thief in the night. Whenever it is that they are saying: 'Peace and security!' then sudden destruction is to be instantly upon them just as the pang of distress upon a preg - nant woman; and they will by no means escape. But you, brothers, you are not in darkness, so that that day should overtake you as it would thieves, for you are all sons of light and sons of day. 39 \" We belong neither to night nor to darkness. \" 40 The \" Sons of Light \" in this sacred scripture of the New Testa - ment represents a living Zohar key to the fourth power. This key ex - plains how there is a dimension of the human community which is al - ready working directly off the star energies coming in from advanced spiritual intelligence in infinite light - life systems. 41 The Lords of Light know that there will always be given di - mensions of \" Earth experimenta - tion \" in darkness because of the life forces continually being tested within the Earth's sun. 42 No matter the extent of the purification of the life forces, there will always be physical life stations like the Earth, used as testing zones for the thought - forms of the Higher Evolution in advancing the many realms of intelligence in ac - cord with the Father's Plan of the creation of new worlds. 43 Moreover, specie evolution on this planet can only evolve so far because the present Earth cycle was created as a result of a fallen thought - form and thus requires the Redemptive thought - form of a new region of Light that shall be placed around the planet when Christ of - fers up the planet to the Father. 44 So earthling man is presently in a fallen dimension of light which is the realm of spatial darkness. Our chemical evolution will not evolve far within this phase of planetary evolution. 45 We need to have a higher light valency, a higher light repro - gramming that is synchronized from Father systems to Son sys - tems, from Son systems to Shekinah systems. 46 And because of this the 'Children of Light \" see that it is foolish to talk in terms of norma - tive values, for their mind recog - nizes the ephemeral state of peace and happiness in this world. For the world remains continually in chaos and the Child of God sees that complete harmony cannot be achieved in this dimension; and only by awakening to the inner Light will his Light which is in the world but not of the world be completely transfigured into the heavens of the Eternal Day. 47 Therefore it says in I Thes - salonians, \" you are all sons of light and sons of day. \" 48 In other words, you are all sons of that light focus, of that light projection which must be res - urrected as a Divine thought - form lest it remain within the graviton structure of the solar paradigm. 49 This explains why the major - ity of mankind reincarnates back into this biochemical plasma again and again only to sit and look at their navel; to wonder why vio- lence must overtake the peaceful and righteous. 50 This planetary bondage has to go beyond its light field, other - wise it simply allows for matter- energy to reincarnate back into the same chemical pattern of relativity. 51 Enoch is saying in this key that there is a greater field of light that you can rejoice in. And until you rejoice in that greater light KEY 112.44 - 58 continuum, which allows infinite varieties to take place, you will be - come a time server of what Earth society considers security and peace. 52 Ascended Master Paul then tells us in I Thessalonians 5: 6 - 11: \" So then, let us not sleep on as the rest do (namely, those people who think this is it and continue to sleep in spite of what their inner nature tells them), but let us stay awake and keep our senses. 53 \" For those who sleep are ac - customed to sleep at night, and those who get drunk are usually drunk at night. 54 \" But as for us who belong to the day, let us keep our senses and have on the breastplate of faith and love and as a helmet the hope of salvation; because God assigned us, not to wrath, but to the acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. 55 \" He died for us, that, whether we stay awake or are asleep, we should live together with him. 56 \" Therefore keep comforting one another and building one another up, just as you are in fact doing. \" 57 Here Man, operating with the higher dimension of light, is seen involved in something greater than dialectics. 58 He understands his relation - ship to the ongoing space - time that he is part of, lest he be recycled within the light cone of this order of relativity. He must place his faith on the helmet of hope and salvation: he must teach the mind force of people to understand how the Hierarchy operates in the larger system of remaking the planetary creation."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"KEY 7 12 5q-72 59 Man dwells on a world which places emphasis on the physical body and seeks to direct his attention to the chemical shell which it considers the seat of its in - telligence. Yet, it is only the lowest incarnation of spirit embodiment. 60 The child of God puts on the breastplate of faith because he walks in this world which will not accept evidence of higher truths and which will attack him if he tries to raise its consciousness and the consciousness of the masses of this world. 61 The Child of God must wear, however, not the breastplate of hostility and violence, but faith. 62 The true Sons of Light will always know that there is a spirit of restoration within the nature of the higher faith which will continue the work of the Overself body and shall issue forth as many garments as necessary for the accomplish - ment of the works of the Lord. 63 The more that you pour out the gifts of the spirit the more the spirit awakens your senses so that you do not have to sleep in the consciousness of death which is be - fore the rebirth of Light. 64 Paul is also drawing atten - tion to the fact that the ancient brotherhoods worked and studied at night when solar influences on the mind are diminished, permit - ting the light influences of the higher star' illuminaries to be rec - ognized, and permitting the mind to communicate with the \" light \" of Merkabah by creating focal geome - tries and using sacred mantras to modulate wave factors in the send - ing out of mind signals. 65 We get a better understand - ing of this as Paul continues I Thessalonians 5: 12, 13: \" Now we request you, brothers, to have re - gard for those who are working hard among you and presiding over you in the Lord and ad - monishing you; and to give them more than extraordinary considera - tion in love because of their work. \" 66 Paul is saying this of those who are working hard with their creative energies, with their light energies; for the epistle is addres - sed to believers who are already Sons of Light. 67 There are sons of Light who are sons of Light of only one con - sciousness faith; 68 there are sons of Light who are Sons of Light on all planes of consciousness, who are workers. 69 He is saying that those who work the work of salvation are doing the greater work; because they are actually focusing all of the energy of the Yam Or, the cycle of the light of this day into the con - sciousness dimension where Man can truly feel it. 70 Paul is speaking of the abil - ity to bring this light energy to the twelve emanations of light within the physical vehicle. 71 We are told, then, mathemat - ically within the astronomy of Zohar, that the brothers are to work collectively as the Brothers. That no man is to work indepen - dent of his source of energy and that his source of energy will only work if he has the breastplate of faith and the helmet of hope. He must have all of those sensory conditions fulfilled which open his physical force fields or chakra cen - ters for the Christ Body to indwell. 72 Paul is writing this because there are brethren who are tem - poral children of light and receive only certain emanations of light by belief, yet stop evolving at that par - ticular point. 73 He tells them that the chan - nel of Light that is working through the helmet and the breast - plate is continual. This is the focus for the language of the Urim and Thummim. All of the energy charges which come in through your heart chakra must be in league with your kether fire of faith. 74 It is only when you use this 'fiery' kether of the physical body that you understand that the body is a machine which works continu - ally with light inputs as a chemical counterpart to our sun system. You have to understand this in the greater context of keeping that higher light system coming to you lest it simply become an intellectual or mental resonance rather than a complete transfiguration of all chakras. 75 With this in mind, then, we can understand I Thessalonians 5: 14 - 23: \" On the other hand, we ex - hort you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, speak consolingly to the depressed souls, support the weak, be long - suffering toward all. 76 \" See that no one renders in - jury for injury to anyone else, but always pursue what is good toward one another and to all others. 77 \" Always be rejoicing. Pray incessantly. In connection with ev - erything give thanks. For this is the will of God in union with the Christos respecting you. 78 \" Do not put out the fire of the spirit. Do not treat prophesy - ing~ with contempt. Make sure of all things; hold fast to what is fine. KEY 117 72 - 83 Abstain from every form of wick - edness. 79 \" May the very God of peace sanctify you completely. \" This is the god - force of peace. 80 This is not the political peace or the peace of the world. It is the peace that passeth all human un - derstanding. It is the peace of knowing there is no such thing as death; that you are a part of a great Overself of Light. Out of that greater Overself all the chemical cells are redefined, re - modulated and reprojected depending upon the assignments of the higher mind on the higher level of creation in - volved with your level of vibratory creation on the molecular level. It is the peace of knowing that you are a co - participant and co-citizen in many universes. 81 Paul said you have peace in knowing that you are a son of light; you will go into many king - doms of light and you will not re - main in this kingdom of darkness. 82 Only then can you be as a light unto the nations of the world, as a channel of Light unto the people in the same way that chan - nels are within you from the higher peoplehoods of Light. 83 I Thessalonians then con - tinues with 5: 23 - 28: \" May the very God of peace sanctify you com - pletely. And sound in every respect may the spirit and the soul and the body of you be preserved in a blameless manner at the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ.

The spirit of Light is given to the physical evolution to increase our genetic capacity for light (as a dimension of power) at a point where the physical evolution becomes the higher evolution. 88 He says, \" He who is calling you is faithful. \" Now who is this person who is calling you? 89 The Spirit of the Christos is calling you and you are his faithful ones; he has left his physical di - mension here and has ascended into the higher realms of intelli - gence only to come back to redeem this physical dimension. 90 The Spirit of the Christos is calling you beyond all earthly dualihes of light versus darkness. 91 Paul is telling the brethren of light, generate vibrations of light by prayer and greet all brothers of light with a holy kiss on the third eye because it activates your seed crystal. 92 This light temple of the spiritual Mind - Face can be mod - ulated by the supreme intelligence from advanced life systems to your life system. 93 When you accept the faith and the love of the living Yod- He - Wod - He, YHWH, which is beyond all infinite systems, you are activated into a threshold of light where you are able to see, perceive and participate in these other levels, other kingdoms of light. 94 Man is no longer locked in the darkness of the temple of the body; he no longer lives from night to day; he no longer sleeps within his sensory body at night, but he lives in the Eternal ESHYOUHOD. 95 And this is the message of Enoch, and I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth re - cord of the Shekinah kingdom within us; and I commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and accept the Living Light. And the ones having insight will shine like the brightness of the ex - panse; and those who are bringing the many to righteousness, like the stars to time indefinite, even forever. 46 Ã Yt Ã Ã Ã Ã tÃ t 66 4 6dh&uud vehicle 9 $fi $fi ^ ^Ã to open - up the"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"THE \" PEOPLE OF GOD \" COLLECTIVELY CREATE THE VEHI - CLE WHICH IS USED TO OPEN - UP THE UNIVERSE. 1 This key was explained in terms of the higher thinking intel - ligence which functions as a field of creative education in the repair - ing of the universes.

This Di - vine Knowledge enables the \" Peo - ple of God \" to open up other ex - pressions of intelligence and to re - deem those expressions in the Name of YHWH. 2 The Keys of Divine Knowl - edge are transmitted to the human community by the Order of Mel- chizedek as the human community becomes its own family unit of Light. 3 And as it becomes its own family unit of Light, it functions as the \" People of God, \" the higher in - telligence upon this planetary sta - tion of creation. 4 However, the true program of earthman is to inherit Eternal Life by going beyond the planetary cy - cles of relative creation. 5 Therefore, the People of God must prepare themselves to take the Exodus and to assimilate the power that the Higher Evolution gives to Man. It is this power which controls the Light threshold grids of energy used to come into and leave our physical dimension. This is done by opening twelve faces of the Zodiac, the Mazzaroth, by the higher grids of modulated energy. 6 Consequently, the human cre - ation will find the twelve meridians within the body, within the earth, and of the Mazzaroth all intercon - nected with new thresholds, which are the greater measuring foci for the Redemption being prepared for Man by the Brotherhoods. 7 The human body, then, has the awareness that just as there are twelve meridians of Light con - nected to the seed crystal, the third eye of the body, so also the planet - ary membrane, the planetary biocomputer, has twelve Light focal channels. These channels are used to reprogram the human creation and act as key points for the ex - odus that occurs from this threshold control to the next order - ing of evolution. 8 This reprogramming will take place during the cycle of time of the great cataclysm. This great cataclysm will begin by cosmic waves hitting the earth prior to our solar system entering an elec - tromagnetic null zone which will generate wave bombardment of the polar areas."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"KEY 113 9 - 22 9 This bombardment will open up vortices of energy which will change the mantle of the earth due to tremendous amounts of liquified material being (electromagnetically pinched and) ejected out of the core of the earth.

There will be artifacts show - ing that prior to these great changes there were \" contacts with other worlds \" to help us through our final phase. 10 Furthermore, great earth - quakes which cannot be ascertained shall come from the core of the earth and will lay China in ruins from the regions of Yumen and Wuwei in the west, to Tientsin, Tangshan, and Yingkow in the east. 11 This is the beginning of our final phase, when China shall re - ceive nemesis upon nemesis for she has turned against the Lords of Light who were once in the Tarim Basin, and the great spiritual Mas - ters of ancient China who taught of the worlds to come. 12 Her armies will advance and be cut off in the rear by great earthquakes as they move into the central lands of Russia and the an - cient lands that are connected with the powers of the Middle East. 13 She shall receive groanings and multitudinous inland seas of blood. 14 Paotow, Taiyuan, and other cities will sink as a consequence of great storm eddies and lashes of the sea. 15 He who created the earth will send up column upon column of fire and supersonic winds, and the sacred regions of the Tarim Basin will be cut off from both the lands of Russia and China like a tortoise shell of Light. 16 As the earth passes into its final phase, a boomerang effect of hot neutral matter will cause a great fluxing of sediments and shake the wings of the Dove that mark the continent of the New JerUSAlem. 17 Out of continental rupture and shifting, a great bridge of land will rise out of the Pacific towards the south, and a great bridge of land will arise out of the Atlantic in the area of the equator. 18 Islands of Light will be formed from the land separators on the east and west coasts of North America where the People of Light will be gathered. 19 Massive floods and the re - leasing of neutral matter from the core of the earth will cause drastic dissolving and a settling out of the basic materials on the surface of the earth. 20 Upon entering the lip of the electromagnetic null zone,the whole solar system will be picked up and reseeded in a different vibratory dimension of the galaxy. 21 The solar system will be pro - jected off the lip of the elec - tromagnetic null into a different system of harmonics which will re - quire fifth - dimensional bodies. 22 In the process, the incomplete \" body and mind \" shall lose its individualization and the soul shall be reprocessed. Those who are to represent the Hosts of Light in new electromagnetic spec - trums shall maintain their physical form within a different envelope of light so that they will be able to work with the advanced races of the Zoharim. 23 Those who are \" taken off \" to other populations of spiritual intel - ligence will be taken where their ability to work with the harmonies of the soul will continue. 24 Before this comes to pass, the Jerusalem Command of the Order of Melchizedek will establish Academies of Light so as to pre - pare the vibratory fields of the spiritual body to acclimate the physical body and mind for rapid changes so as not to be neutralized by the dying thought - forms of hatred. 25 We will be given a thoroughgoing comprehension of how we can use our five bodies of Light and the Gifts of the Holy Spirit to prepare for new worlds. 26 The Order of Melchizedek in conjunction with the Order of Enoch, will give Light to all areas of world science so that the Father's Covenant will come to pass. This will activate a spiritual- scientific synthesis. 27 The Academies of Light will train the mind to work with the Keys of Knowledge, using the seventh, eighth, and ninth chakra triangulation to actualize a physical quantum leap beyond the imperfect karmic cycles of our solar spectrum known to the ancients as being in - fluenced by the Solar Council. 28 These Academies of Light will be a global network of spiritual communities of the People of Light united and focused into one inter - planetary government that will ac - cept the Brotherhoods that serve KEY 113 22 - 33 the Office of the Christ. 29 The mapping of the govern - ment of the Seraphim will be man - ifested in twenty - four Temples of Light in the Land of the Ancient of Days. 30 Enoch told me that when the Melchizedek Light centers on this planet are built there will be \" three scientific faces \" of Light which will be given to Man by the Enochian Brotherhood. One face will be an energy field which will work with the levels of electromagnetic con - version. This will be used to take energy out of the air and use it for physical activity; this activity will be sustained as a perpetual pulse. 31 The second face will give Man the ability to utilize the con - sciousness of Light with elec - tromagnetic technology to create the Sphinx, the physical vehicle which will give us the understand - ing of how the physical biosatellites of interstellar creation operate. The Pyramid - Sphinx is the next face of Light which will allow man to be made into the image of the luminaries and at the same time be transformed into new bodies of Light. 32 The third face will work with the \" medicine of Light, \" more specifically, electromedicine which will allow various electromagnetic fields to speed up the chemistry of the human body - the human DNA - RNA matrix, to work on a higher wavelength of Light. 33 When the People of God bring together these higher disci - plines of electromagnetic technol - ogy, the keys behind the Pyramid - Sphinx for space travel, and the science of electromedicine, they can create autonomous com-"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"KEY 173.33-43 munities of Light which will be the stepping stones to other worlds. 34 Through this collective en - lightenment, we can understand that the Pyramid which is used to connect with the next level of evolution will not be an architec - tural pyramid cut out of stone but an energy pyramid, shaped out of the powers of consciousness Light. 35 In these pyramidal com - munities, the elect will be transfig - ured and transformed to have communion with the intelligence of the Brotherhoods who come into these pyramidal fields of Light. The Brotherhood of Light will be the fourth face, the face of conscious - ness Light that man will move into as his physical creation becomes transfigured into the identity of the higher evolution that he is to work with. 36 In addition, within these Academy centers, the Melchizedek Brotherhood will show the Light workers of the planet how to resur - rect the discorporated soul vehicles into a new spiritual totality which can ascend into the new world of vibration on the day of transition - the day of Yom Or. 37 This key of Enoch stresses the fact that the People of God will open - up their universe. The open - ing will not come through those exclusively within the domain of science nor religion who have placed authority between their body and the Gifts of the Holy Spirit, but through the People of God who are the living synthesis of all levels of consciousness ex - perience progressing into the joy - ous I AM THAT I AM. 38 The People of God are also to be seen in terms of the family structure operating in life through - out history, as well as the spiritual family being gathered from all the nations of the world. 39 Within the family structure the People of God are able to sur - vive because they contain the necessary autonomy to maintain creative balance in other worlds. 40 The Family of God organized into basic units of ten will be taken as one vibratory structure that has learned to pray and resonate to - gether, thereby activating those spiritual gifts that are absolutely necessary for progression into new planetary worlds where one family can seed a whole peoplehood of God. 41 Their vibratory powers form the collective Messianic garment through: the healing powers of the Holy Spirit; the proper attunement of spiritual instruction; the spreading of wisdom giz~en by the Holy Spirit so as to unite all wisdom traditions into the Living Light; 42 the discernment of spirits that inhibit the people of the planet from knowing their true identity with God; the yophefic preaching as to the Keys of Knowledge working within and beyond time; the man - ifestations of speaking in tongues that unite the body with other levels of intelligence (which can show pat - terns of previous spiritual teach - ing); 43 the interpretation of tongues so as to understand how different levels of knowledge can be coordi - nated (irrespective of the genetic capacity); the power of miracles showing the interpenetration of life into the Infinite Way; and the gift of active faith which shows how we must progress beyond the \" milk of being a new - born child of God\" into the Messianic fiber which cul - tivates the Kingdom of God on earth - seeing invisible things be - coming visible. 44 The People of God will also receive five additional Gifts of the Holy Spirit when they are fully ac - tualized. These will be the gifts of speaking in spiritual - scientific tongues; resurrecting the dead; speak - ing angelic languages; the ability to see and work with the angelic teachers of Light in this world and the co - existing worlds; and the understanding of the mysteries of the Shekinah Kingdoms whereby all em - bodiments of your Overself can be experienced by you in reference to other worlds which you occupy. 45 The People of God then be - come the vehicle for the elect of the world. 46 And God will show His People the things that are coming so that they will understand how the reality of our world will merge with the \" next world \" before the time of the Coming. 47 We will be given a living knowledge, a \" knowing \" of the \" next world \" that we will enter, for without this knowledge we would feel that we are being deprived of life and entering consciousness death. 48 This will happen before the Council reveals itself so that each member of the human race has the opportunity to serve his brother and build the Kingdom of God. 49 And the People of God will govern those areas which are known as geophysical time warp areas. There, we will be protected against death by radiation and dis - ease from the dying solar vibra - KEY 113 43-53 tions, for these areas are protected by a pillar of energy conversion. 50 Thus, the JerUSAlem Com - mand will be synchronized in the time warp areas which will be the center of the reprogramming. These areas are created by alternating ro - tational force fields turned over (by circumversion) so as to create Light fields beyond the space - time man - ifold of our relative field, thus syn - chronizing two pyramidal cones of Light into a spiral nebula which has characteristics of both an arc and cosmic eye. 51 By operating as an \" arc \" and an \" energy eye, \" the alternating ro - tational force field creates a \" ripple of ripples \" which enables informa - tion to be coded to different sys - tems from one single point. 52 In these time warp areas our five inner vehicles are prepared to go into Merkabah, into other di - mensions of space - time creation which will follow after the Earth goes through this present cycle. 53 Therefore, in these Mel- chizedek life stations we will re - ceive instructions \" on tongues of fire \" so as to prepare us to enter the space - time overlap. 54 The space - time overlap is the intersecting of different objectified orderings of galactic time (within the same consciousness time zone) in such a way that the ionization of our human race (the Bride) is suffi - ciently altered to receive the charac - teristics of the higher creation (the Bridegroom). 55 At the onset of the overlap, we will gradually experience a build - up of new visual vibratory forms and we will begin to accept spiritual knowledge which will allow us to unfold into new vibra -"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"KEY 113 \"i-66; tions while still discriminating be - tween the various levels of intelli - gence which will appear. 56 Know that the forces of Light will not allow the spiritual seed to perish during this time for we share with them the same Father. 57 As the last two pages of Kaballah are written, the scroll of Alpha and Omega will be rolled up and a portion of mankind will be removed from the Earth and placed on a new vibration of the Divine Word. 58 During the time of the space - time overlap, the People of God will collectively put on new garments of Light as they ascend through the spheres and through the thresholds of the other worlds of creation. 59 Out of 'the Divine Orb- Jewel' the chemical seed from one planetary field of electromagnetism is planted into another planetary field through the vibrations of the Divine Word - YHWH. 60 Thus, we have a clearer un - derstanding of the scroll of Revela - tion which exemplifies the revealed harvesting of the chemical seed through pyramidal fields of Light, becoming one with the fullness of the Adam Kadmon, as we acquire the brilliance of Zohar to shine in the heavens. 61 At that time, the People of God will rise to the heavens and shine like the brightness of the fir - mament; this is the Glory, the Love, and the Message for the People of God. ^ *'$@ Ã $ $' ' $V# /Ãˆ # ,$ ^ which ?stabliShesa"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Model Of Transition Through The Consciousness Time Zone 1 Electromagnetic - Magnetohydrodynamic changes begin to take place prior to entering a null zone to move a 'life zone of gravitational compression' into a larger spectrum. 2.

This happens when a solar civiliza - tion undergoes severe Magnetic and gravitational changes upon en - tering an electromagnetic null zone in its immediate universe. 4 Enoch told me that at this time the Higher Evolution will communicate knowledge to Man to prepare him for an exodus as his planet begins to experience geo - physical upheavals and the release of neutral matter from the core of the sun. 5 These changes will also be timed with the release of neutral matter within the core of the Earth which has been the cause of cata - clysms and catastrophic upheavals during previous geophysical cycles. 6 To prevent complete destruc - tion of the physical creation, the Higher Evolution mutually cooperating with spiritual Man will reprogram Man to go beyond his terrestrial \" cubic function \" meas - ured in terms of orbital spin and what he feels to be a \" gravity con - stant. \" 7 The Higher Evolution will change the terrestrial cubic space of our planetary model so that it be - comes an exact spin model for the higher cubic function. The higher cubic function changes the vibra - tory environment of the planet al - lowing man as \" hu - man \" to be shifted to the next spectrum through an octal function. 8 Enoch told me, Man in this cubic space has always worked with a diminishing power of the life recorder cell which controls all adaptions of life; therefore, he is in actuality not in a process of pro - gressive evolution. 9 He is degenerating from the original light scenario of intelli - gence planted on this planet and as his energy field is breaking down,"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"KEY 1149-24 he will require the pillar of spiritual Light to attune his body to con - tinue. 10 The membrane of Man will then be able to live within a higher wavelength of light, within a new age of light. 11 Enoch told me, Man is a light imprint now being har - monized through mirror - like projec - tions emanating through prism faces of crystal. At a given point of planetary experimentation, the Higher Intelligence superimposes a higher energy model around the galaxy. 12 The higher model is an energy field which will reorientate the six faces of a degenerating earth \" cubic system \" by creating parallel and integral wavelengths in phase, by means of \"phase- pulling. \" 13 The prism faces follow an octal arrangement, whereby the lower terrestrial side of the '8' is in exact harmonic opposition to the higher celestial octave. 14 Moreover, there is a ''couple - through \" from the side of Higher Intelligence which allows the phase of the lower cube to be changed constructively. This allows negative resonance to be removed. 15 Here, there is a force reso - nance operating from the upper cube to the lower cube which creates this coupling so that a natural resonance is produced be - tween the cubes. 16 Thus, while the cubes are phase - locked, Man can go beyond his terrestrial phase into the higher model - only while he is in phase matched alignment within the eight - fold way. This is the opening of the Infinite Way within his body. 17 The key of Enoch is saying that we will go through \" negative entropy. \" Simultaneously, we will be taken by Higher Intelligence and moved into a new field of star seed evolution. 18 This will take place by the \" Pillar of Light \" which realigns our life space as we proceed into the next ordering of evolution. We will go towards the ultraviolet threshold through a Pillar of Light which penetrates all protective (layered) atmospheres and absorbs radiation so that light is benign! 19 Man is part of a larger crys - talline vehicle which goes through a superimposed scale not in the \" original physical matrix. \" 20 Thus, the regenerating pro - gram is implanted within our core lattice of crystal encompassing the entire planetary field of human ex - perience while the other diminish - ing activities, not protected by the Pillar of Light, are allowed to com - pletely dissipate. 21 However, this complete realignment of the larger vehicle can take place only when the end of the cycle occurs. This must come at the appropriate time lest com - plete degeneration of the con - sciousness takes place. 22 This transition into new as - tronomical and consciousness spaces is known as a space - time overlap. 23 There are nine major mechanisms of the physical overlap between different evolutionary worlds. 24 At the time of this ascension. a \" Pillar of Light \" establishes a \" Light zone \" around a given life space. This \" Light zo~e\" is used to prepare a selected intelligent life space for transit into another \" mansion \" world of life experience. 25 The placing of the Light zone generally takes place before cosmic wave bombardment begins - immediately prior to entering a null zone. 26 If a null zone is not present, it is produced because it is a neces - sary part of the fabric of attune- ment in the lower heavens. 27 Therefore, electromagnetic and magnetohydrodynamic changes are allowed to take place which moves a life zone of gravitational compression into a larger graviton spectrum. 28 This transition is prepared by negative gravitons which fill the void in the matrix so that the Higher Evolution can confine the envelopes for gravitational com - pression. 29 However, the Pillar of Light acts as a light covering which pre - vents the consciousness form (which is to continue) from discor- porating during transition. Without this garment of Light the image frequency behind the genetic code would be destroyed! 30 This transit is begun through teleshift light fields modulating the consciousness time zones wherein ascension begins to take place. This means, while we go into an elec - tromagnetic null zone, unless we are balanced by teleshift light fields, our mind as an elec - tromagnetic computer would not adapt to the new frequency of Light, and would be destroyed. 31 In this process of simul - taneity, the linkage with the higher cubic function of Light is made with the lower cubic function KEY 11424-37 through spin orientation and the coupling modes which allows con - sciousness to break through Magnetic field structure. 32 The spin orientation creates spiraling effects which change the behavior of the electron and the electron - proton structure causing the spectral pattern to shift into new energy bands. 33 One has to go into a weak magnetic zone to allow for com - plete reorientation from without. 34 Here linkages are forged which allow the body to inherit the Light - kingdom which is to work with certain geomagnetic parame - ters on the lower planes of crea - tion. However, life cannot exit the geomagnetic parameter until the field is weakened and reorientated. 35 Once the proper linkages have been completed (with the human system) through harmonic intensities of spin coordination, the alignment with a new light zone can take place through inner- magnetohydrodynamic fields mod - ulating the geophysical time warp areas of the lower structure into \" New Time Zones \" by means of a Lay-00-esh \" Pillar of Light. \" 36 In other words, our plane - tary field connects with the higher evolutionary arrangement through the geophysical time warp open - ings. 37 Here, fixed orbital energies act as the core structure of the lower grid, the very \" cornerstone i ' controlling the encapsulated crystal fields. It is this core structure of the lower cube that must be ener - gized in order for consciousness to move upwards. (Here a linear superimposition produces crystal - line coupling.)"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"KEY 114 38 - 50 38 This interchange between two crystalline structures can be viewed as synoptic field effects changing the double helix model in the earth's graviton mapping so that the gravitational compression around all living forms is changed into a different gravity vibration. 39 For example, this can be seen in blood cells which are dis - persed in a continuous medium of high viscosity. The cells at rest are biconcave, but under shear become progressively deformed into prolate ellipsoids, their long axis aligned parallel to the flow direction. The red cell membrane rotates around the hemoglobin like a series of spheres around a central sphere. 40 On a larger scale the elec - tromagnetic null zone permits a new genetic mapping to take place. Simultaneously, this entire reor - ganization of the life zone takes place through many combinations of energy waves. 41 As we are converted into the next wavelength, the next ordering of evolution, matter and muon wave coupling makes the body dur - ing transit \" invisible. \" This takes place on the higher step function beyond our \" physical \" universe. 42 Thus, in the interfacing of two evolutionary structures the \" capstone \" of the Higher Intelli - gence (which contains the thought program) interfaces with the \" cornerstone \" (where the activity is centered) of a given star intelli - gence being reprogrammed - al - lowing for a space - time overlap and new life changes to occur on the most basic atomic and molecu - lar levels. 43 When atomic and molecular structures have been aligned in the same direction of spin and in paral - lel planes, a small part of the outer levels of the energy particle com - ponents spontaneously expand into overlapping orbital motions that engulf whole crystalline grid struc - tures in their orbital growth. 44 Thus, a new threshold of life is created with the command to freely circumnavigate in the Mid- Heavens. 45 The key gives the macro and micro models interpenetrating themselves simultaneously! 46 The spiraling up through the Pillar of Light allows for the specie to recharge itself. The spiraling down of anything that is not pro - tected in the Light - will be lost in going through the space singular - ity. In this process the dissipated energy is only lost to the higher planes, for it is recycled and re - vised to keep \" life \" refined and going on within the Infinite Way. 47 In this transformation Man must sacrifice his 'I' of individuality for the collective 'I AM ' to ascend to God's Kingdom and surrender to the work of the Father first above all else. 48 Thus, our luminous con - sciousness, our I AM, attaches it - self to the Higher Intelligence on the other side of the River of Crystal. This projected focus of Light is the Pillar of Light which connects our life with Life on the other side of the River of Crystal. 49 The Pillar of Light is a sanc - tifying Light governing and protect - ing the actions of spiritual decision under the most crucial circums - tances: it is used for the redemp - tion of a planet by the Adonai Tsebayoth! 50 The People of God become one with the Pillar of Light which rests over their tabernacle on the journey into the next creative level of intelligence. 51 In seeing this divine blue - print, it must be understood that the three verses of Exodus 14:19-21 show how the vibrations of your consciousness can be charged by the power of the Word of God creating a new electron balance with your membrane of flesh. 52 These verses show how God's revelation came down to spell out the Diz~ine Name of seventy- two letters which when placed in a grid become the actual Pillar of Light in the Exodus of Deliverance. 53 The seventy - two letters thrice - fold give the three sephirothic pillars of deliverance operating as One Pillar of YHWH leading His elect out of the devour - ing anti - universe. 54 The Light speaks, Shemot 1419: 'And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, re - moved and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them. \" Here is the collective B'nai Yis- rael from the heavens and from the earth fused with the Pillar of the Cloud as an OPENING! 55 Shemot 14:20: \" And it came between the camp of the Mitzrayim and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but gave light by night to these: so that the one KEY 11450-59 came not near the other all the night. \" Here is the collective B'nai Yis- rael from the heavens and from the earth moving between the veils of light and darkness through the Sephirothic Pillar of Light. 56 Shemot 14:21: \" And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and YHWH caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. \" vi9i 0~5y IT-UN nvn Q'I my an \" ) ma a9n-n~s mm nam5 i~n-m 0w91 W5n-52 :awn 1ypa91 Here is the collective B'nai Yis- rael from the heavens and from the earth acting as the passage through the \" floors \" of the celestial heavens whereby both land and water are as one \" red Sea \" of light in the solar spectrum that must be cross - ed! 57 Come, let us exit Egypt, let us take the wings of the morning and prepare our people to meet the Host - the Adonai 'Tsebayoth - by leaving the Pyramids of the old order of consciousness. 58 Come, let us remove our - selves from the Pharaohs of the world, the Pharaohs who keep the world in slavery to economic bond - age without the capstone of Light. 59 Come, let us cleanse the sys - tem of life and exalt Him who di - vides the heavens and the earth through His People of Light."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"KEY 114 60 - 64 60 Enoch explained, when he gave this key, that the membrane of Man, membrane Min-Ha- Ada - Mah, the living substance of consciousness within the blood, must become membrane Men - Ha - Ada - Mah, membrane raised to the next ordering of evolution, membrane as universal media. 61 When this takes place the membrane of blood crystallization within the body of Man can cry out from the earth, just like the blood of Abel cried out from earth to YHWH. The blood crystals are alive within the greater membrane of ongoing life which knows no death - only realignment. 62 Thus, the alignment with the Pillar is necessary lest the mind be constantly recycled back into the same biological matrix again and again to replay life within old memory patterns of consciousness - with the di- minishing power of the Adam Kadmon. 63 This alignment is done in order that the true Light forces enter mankind and mankind be born anew of Christ, seed crystal to seed crystal, People of God to Peo - ple of God, Lion of Judah trium - phant over the power of Pharaoh and the old radiations of the Sun! 64 Now, let the thirty - six and thirty - six flow of energy between the Earth and the Sun be broken - and the Brothers and Sisters of Light come forth in the power of the Yotzer Anzaroth - Shalom.

Key fifteen speaks of the larger family of cre - ation which is already in the House of Many Mansions. 2 The human family is limited and cannot participate in the nine time zones, each containing eight mansions of the Infinite Way. The human family can only participate in the seven finite mansion worlds of Light until it is willing to use its family focus of love and light as a basic stepping stone of crystal within its Life - Light zone. 3 When Enoch explained this, he took me through the many di - mensions of creation and showed me intelligence on other planets and fields where there are no in - sects in the air gathering ripe fruit off the vine. 4 He showed me a family eat - ing manna, the food of Light, glowing within the home; 5 He showed me the family gathered in prayer and praise, in marriage. 6 He showed me all of the basic stages to emphasize that this was the central unit that God the Father has chosen and when earth uni - verses violate the model of the Father, the Mother, the Son, the Daughter - the balances of the Ten Commandments, they cannot sit down at the table of Light, but must devour themselves. 7 He pointed out to me many scriptures, one being the sacred scriptures of the Church of Moroni, or Mormon. 8 He explained that the true scriptures of the Church of Moroni contain the keys for preparing the family structure to serve the Office of Light and to enter the celestial family of God. 9 He also explained that the Church of the Latter Day Saints was the living tribe of Joseph and that just as Joseph had gathered his brothers in Egypt, the tribe of Joseph will gather even the scat - tered of the Christ Race to be fed and clothed and prepared for the Melchizedek reign of Light upon the planet. 10 And I understood what was written in the Book of Moses, Chapter 6:27-34: \" And he heard a voice from heaven, saying: Enoch, my son, prophesy unto this people, and say to them - Repent, for thus saith the Lord: I AM angry"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"KEY I I5 10-22 with this people, and my fierce anger is kindled against them; for their hearts have waxed hard, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes cannot see afar off; 11 \" And for these many genera - tions, ever since the day that I created them, have they gone astray, and have denied me, and have sought their own counsels in the dark; and in their own abomi - nations have they devised murder, and have not kept the command - ments, which I gave unto their Father, Adam. 12 \" Wherefore, they have foresworn themselves, and, by their oaths, have they brought upon themselves death; and a hell I have prepared for them, if they repent not; 13 \" And this is a decree, which I have sent forth in the beginning of the world, from my own mouth, from the foundation thereof, and by the mouths of my servants, thy fathers, have I decreed it, even as it shall be sent forth in the world, unto the ends thereof. 14 \" And when Enoch had heard these words, he bowed him - self to the earth, before the Lord, Adonai, and spake before the Lord, Adonai, saying: Why is it that I have found favor in thy sight, and am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech; wherefore am I thy servant? 15 \" And the Lord said unto Enoch: Go forth and do as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee.

As for your old men, dreams they will dream. As for your young men, visions they will see. And even on the menservants and on the maidservants in those days I shall pour out my spirit. \" 23 And the children as part of the inner priesthood of Light, the family of Joseph, will prepare the faithful to become an organic unity of Light. In this the child is a basic function of all physical intelligence entering the Covenant of Light. 24 Fallen angels cannot marry because they have violated the marriage codes by impregnating their seeds with the Nephilim and the fallen Seraphim. 25 They have abused the physi - cal creations and therefore they come down from the higher levels of intelligence to the lower levels where it is easier to pick up bodies, easier to pick up biochemical shells. 26 Since they cannot have their own bodies or their own sons and daughters of Light, they seize and possess chemical bodies of lower levels of creation which do not ac - tually exist within their own indi - vidual consciousness save within the consciousness of the Higher In - telligence. 27 And where corporal intelli - gence does not believe in the power of the Living God, they have unprotected frequencies which are ripe for being jammed and used by whatever intelligence may walk upon the face of the earth. 28 In the process of refashion - ing these imbalances, the righteous man is commanded to form a fam - ily, the family a community, the community a peoplehood, the peo- plehood the order of Light. 29 Key fifteen, thus, speaks about the family of Zion, the con - sciousness of Light through which the Light ionization of Ze can come and leave in a flash of light, and transform the family back into its celestial home. KEY 115 23 - 34 30 The higher consciousness can come and leave with quantum mechanistic corpuscles of Light. This Light can be impregnated in the seed of a child when he or she is born. The higher consciousness can impregnate a woman when she is conceiving a Man of God who is anointed to serve the Lord. At that time of mutual conception, the Spirit of Light passes over the chemical waters and baptizes the cell in the Name of the Father. 31 It says that this be a blessed function if the descent of the dove can be seen above the head. 32 If in the Name of the Father, the descent of the dove will hover there, then the powers of the child will be used and that house will be blessed by God. 33 Enoch told me that the chil - dren who would be born of highly spiritual parents would not come into the world under the influences of the old Zodiac - Mazzaroth cycle, but would be born with karmic release knowing that they have direct communication with the Father's Kingdom. These children will be incarnated with a specific purpose to serve the remnant seed of the world and to prepare that remnant seed with great powers of spiritual fusion which will pour out of their \" super minds. \" 34 This is why we have Son universes, for where there is not the countenance and the wisdom of the Son reigning in the Name of the Father, there arise mutations amongst the species giving rise to physical grotesqueries.

Compared with the Olam Aziluth, they live in dark universes or in methane or liquid ammonia environments which require differ - ent forms of breathing and seeing portals. 35 They cannot have the chemistry of the Adam Kadmon which is adaptable to all sons; they can only adapt to certain prescribed chemical conditions; this is why they cannot have the human power of the Shekinah, or the balances of the Light. 36 And so when the grotesque beings, who have not the Love of the Father, arrive on a planet which cannot cope with their form of energy, they can be destructive to all families and all nations upon the planet. For this reason, the Adamic seed is given the code of \" Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish, Adonai 'Tsebayoth \" - Holy, Holy, Holy, Is the Lord God of Hosts, to be used as a Light protection around the family against those powers not identified with the Father. 37 The family, then, is the fam - ily of the Shekinah body connected with the Son's body of Life - Light and the Father's Throne of Light- Life. The family in its lowest unit is the inner body of the male, the female womb, and the seed crystal all unified in the impregnation of the world of chemistry with the world of ideas, sanctified by the Will of the Father. 38 The outer physical reality is man, woman, and child, upon this planet, but without the unification and sanctification of the Seventh Ray of Light, the family of L,ove would be disregarded by the pre - dilections of the flesh. 39 On other planets, three brothers of Light and three sisters of Light are united into three Lords of Light; in other star dimensions of consciousness, it is the coming together of the Brotherhoods of Light through three specific Lords of Light acting as one. Then, they can participate in the House of Many Mansions and all mansions of their local universe simultane- ou sly. 40 Enoch told me, where ten faithful beings are gathered to - gether their unified energies of Light create the Merkabah vehicle which calls into their presence two spiritual guides. The two spiritual guides take the family unit collec - tively into the next level of intelli - gence where they are instructed to serve the hierarchy of the Brother - hood of Light. 41 Thus, there are gathered two Masters of Light who join with your family of ten to form the or - ganic vehicle of Life. These Mas - ters, serving the Office of the Christ, will be the leadership of each family sanctified in the vision of sharing their family unity to - gether in new worlds of creation. 42 Therefore, we fulfill the Book of Moses, (Chapter 6:57-68): 'Wherefore teach it unto your chil - dren, that all men, everywhere, must repent, or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God, for no unclean thing can dwell there, or dwell in His presence; for in the language of Adam, [the language of Light,] 43 \" Man of Holiness is his name, and the name of His Only Begotten is the Son of Man, even Jesus Christ, a righteous Judge, who shall come in the meridian of time. 44 \" Therefore I give unto you a commandment, to teach these things freely unto your children, saying: 45 \" That by reason of transgres - sion cometh the fall, which fall bringeth death, and inasmuch as ye were born into the world by water, and blood, and the Spirit, which I have made, and so became of dust a Jiving soul, even so ye must be born again into the kingdom of heaven, of water, and the Spirit, 46 \" and be cleansed by blood, even the blood of mine Only Be - gotten; that ye might be sanctified from all sin, and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world, and eternal life in the world to come, even immortal glory; 47 \" For by the water ye keep the commandment; by the Spirit ye are justified, and by blood ye are sanctified; 48 \" Therefore it is given to abide in you; the record of heaven; the Comforter; the peaceable things of immortal glory; the truth of all things; that which quickeneth all things, which maketh alive all things; that which knoweth all things, and hath all power accord- ng to wisdom, mercy, truth, jus - tice, and judgment. 49 \" And now, behold, I say unto you: This is the plan of salva - tion unto all men, through the blood of mine Only Begotten, who shall come in the meridian of time. 50 \" And behold, all things have their likeness, and all things are created and made to bear record of me, both things which are tem - poral, and things which are spiritual; KEY 115 43 - 18 51 \" things which are in the heavens above, and the things which are on the earth, and things which are in the earth, and things which are under the earth, both above and beneath: all things bear record of me. 52 \" And it came to pass, when the Lord had spoken with Adam, our father, that Adam cried unto the Lord, and he was caught away by the Spirit of the Lord, and was carried down into the water, and was laid under the water, and was brought forth out of the water. 53 \" And thus he was baptized, and the Spirit of God descended upon him, and thus he was born of the Spirit, and became quick - ened in the inner man. 54 \" And he heard a voice out of heaven, saying: Thou art bap - tized with fire, and with the Holy Ghost (Shekinah).

It means that the child of God does not survive independent of the spiritual family. The spiritual family is not only of one dimension, but includes many spiritual faces, many spiritual intelligences, and many spiritual consciousnesses which col - lectively bring the Father's message of everlasting life to the many uni - verses of new creation.

The higher you advance in the order of evolution, the greater the responsibility in at - taching one level of happenstance relativity to another, so as to even - tually create perfect combinations of collective relativity. 6 The lower threshold in the energy cube is the place occupied by the life plasma or, simply, one of the envelope shells of the energy flow as it comes down from the Light of the Elohim.

First, you will see all of the plus and minus energy fields bonding at random on the lower thresholds of intelligence. 10 Then you are drawn through crystalline purification through a series of interconnecting Eyes of Horus which remake happenstance creation into greater crystalline perfection.There you receive and exhibit the Light as a Melchizedek creation. 11 At the highest level of per - fection exists the Eye of the Eternal as a manifestation of the Father's Eye. This Eternal Eye contains all omnipotence and omnipresence governing all the rulers of the Eons who pass into the midst of the Eyes of Horus. 12 So by the time you leave your three - dimensional energy cube in which you live as this spatial human form, you are able to leave one common body of electromag - netism that you have participated in, and work with the Light multi - ples of the larger Eka universe. This larger Eka universe is made up of various color patterns, various membrane patterns, and various biological patterns that are to even - tually be reprocessed through the Eye of the Eternal. 13 Enoch explained that the Great White Brotherhood is the Light vehicle between Eka miwerses. It is the Light intelligence which works to repair all spectrums of limited color and membrane radia - tion so that those lower forms of intelligence, thus freed from limita - tion, can share in the bountiful creative patterns of the Infinite Way. 14 There are seven basic colors for each chakra of the human intel - ligence. These can be coordinated by the Great White Brotherhood to merge with myriad colors to aid the body for spiritual evolvement. For example, the color of \" reddish lavender \" is used as a holding force of patience which prepares the eyes to see the stages of enligh - tened spiritual education. 15 This education of the soul takes place through energy fields established by colors and separated by threshold colors of enlighten - ment for each phase of evolution. 16 From a continual succession of colors with all of their inter - mediate degrees, a \" Garment of color \" emerges from the seventy- two emanations of the divine Names, the derekh ha-shemoth, as the quintessence of \" divine grace \" bestowed on the human kingdom. 17 The Great White Brother - hood is the Hierarchy of power which has as part of its authority the color coding of the lower heavens. It uses these color radia - tions to evolve living membrane to the point where the Living Light can establish itself on the physical plane, do the work required in the physical form, and return again to the Divine Light. 18 Therefore, the-Great White - Brotherhood is sent to work with all people as the dimension of Zohar Splendor and the dimension of the Christ Light which unites all of the energy forms of the inner vehicles. The regenesis of all colors within the human spectrum fun - neled back into the White Light, al - lows the inner vehicles to proceed from the biochemical shell when the meridian of time changes. 19 At that time the relativity of human creation is directly changed by the High Command and the Great White Brotherhood. 20 Enoch also explained how the Great White Brotherhood gov - erns the People of God in the twelve time warps of Light which allow the magnetic fields in the meridians of the earth to be acti - vated to work in a higher dimen - sion of Light. 21 They activate the Earth's magnetic spectrum and elec - tromagnetic fields to operate in parallel phase. They activate the light in a given sun system to move into a higher dimensional movement of light through crystal - line field alignments. 22 The new crystalline field es - tablishes itself through light codes over vortices, so that when the Merkabah pyramid of Light comes down upon the geophysical energy pyramid the two pyramids form a crystalline corridor. 23 Thereby, the remnant seed who still remain in the physical flesh, even bodies in the death state of the physical flesh which have previously had their crystal - line blood and ichor codes acti - vated, can be resurrected into new bodies of Light. 24 Within light harmonics the KEY 1 I6 18 - 27 remnant seed is prepared to ex - perience the changing of the Magnetic patterns of incarnation and recreation. 25 These harmonics of light open up the energies of the third eye and the energy chakra grids within the body so that the rem - nant seed can participate simul - taneously with the magnetic grids all over the Earth, as we are gathered into the magnetic grids for deliverance. 26 This graduation of the Earth's specie to other levels of star creation follows as the effect of changes that have occurred on higher levels throughout the entire universe. Those realms of higher intelligence which have failed in their own created worlds are re - turned to dust world creations so that they can be occupants of the space left behind by those planets that are advanced to new thresh - olds of creation. 27 However, the Magnetic grids of the planets are not allowed to completely change until those that are to go on to other planetary sys - tems and other worlds of creation, through their own respective vehi - cles of Light, are taken up. There - fore, the Great White Brotherhood must activate the fields of the Earth's crystal, yet maintain the harmonics of the Earth's creation until those who will go to other planets are taken into space through the Merkabah vehicles of Light from the twelve geophysical time warps of the Earth. After this takes place, the attachment of Mer- kabah to the Magnetic harmonics of the Earth allows for the majority of the physical creation to spiral di - rectly with the Earth into another orbital frequency."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"KEY //b28-38 28 Unless this change of evolu - tion takes place within the Magne - tic grids, consciousness simply reincarnates back into the same planetary life station and the same chemical shell like the one that it previously had. If this graduation did not take place, consciousness would simply go on in the pattern of replication most akin to the thought - forms, which if they are the same, will acquire the same type of body vehicle to continue that assignment. 29 The Great White Brother - hood is the level of intelligence which has the ability to govern the higher energy fields, and the ability to govern repeating plus and minus factors in membrane growth. 30 They have the ability, in all of this, to be sent from the region of the higher illuminaries to func - tion as Grand Instructors in lower illuminary worlds. 31 The Great White Brother - hood is thus able to use its energy body as a blue - white star system over a yellow - white sun system. They energize the body of Man to shine as the flesh of Orion through energy codes of resurrection. One of these codes, for example, is: r psd hat f rn sah m ht Nwt - which allows dust to put on the outer garment of Light. 32 The thought - form technology of the Great White Brotherhood from Orion is necessary to take evolution outside of its energy threshold codings, so that planetary death is swallowed up in Light. Death itself is swallowed up in the People of Christ, the People of the Great White Brotherhood, who are the people of the higher galactic seed working with all kingdoms of matter to the glory of the Father. 33 This is the reason why YHWH has coded the People of Light into all vibratory membranes and into all consciousness mem - branes lest the People of Israel be neutralized by one religion or glory in one Son. They are instructed to work with the many Sons of the Living God. 34 But the People of God are the true Israel, the true conscious - ness of Light by virtue of seizing the Torah Or, the Truth when it is properly presented by a Teacher of Light to the inner vehicle of Man through knowledge which carries the proper energy codes of Light. 35 At that time, the Word of God brings victory over the iden - tity of the flesh through faith in the Father's I AM. 36 The progression from faith in the Father's I AM, to seeing the I AM THAT I AM face to face, is the essence of our soul experience in this embodiment of Light. 37 First, however, the Gemat- rian Body of Light must seize the Torah Or, the Word of YHWH, and bring it into the heart of the inner body. This allows the inner body to rise to the glory of the Father universe, beyond singular identity, and not remain a slave or servant to the form of the body, or to the Master who prevents the in - itiate from going on. 38 The collective body of the true \" People of God \" is a slave to no one but a servant to all save the offspring of the fallen Nephilirn. These fallen mind energies have neutralized certain genetic muta - tions, certain life spaces, certain ra - cial indexes, certain wisdom teach - ings of consciousness adaption within the history of the planet. Thus, man devours man, race de - vours race, without the Covenant of Light. 39 The nations of the Earth who deny the crossing of light through the Alpha - Omega of creation, deny the Merkabah, deny the Prophets of Israel, and do not show the humility necessary to enter the greater Body of Light. These are not the souls who will enter the Great White Brotherhood. 40 We are to understand that our field of energy is rising out of the body of the galactic serpent of space and time. We are to under - stand how Lord Michael will do battle with the fallen embodiments of light in the galactic serpent alpha Draconis. The serpent rep - resents the devouring anti - universe which keeps the planispheres im - prisoned in a fixed station or orbit of circumpolarity that requires the 'sword of light power, \" from con - stellations like Orion, to intervene and liberate forms of space - time evolution from \" linear death. \" 41 In earlier (cons, our seed crystals of light were transmitted by the Lords of Light when they came to evolve life in the galaxy through memory codes which were then recorded within the pyramids, seven (cons ago, twelve (eons ago, thirty - six (eons ago, and ages past. 42 All of these previous star field programs will be drawn into the light codes so that all those who were locked in space in previ - ous ages will be judged in terms of the way they used their soul poten - tial. In addition, those who are in three - dimensional slavery by being victims of earlier electromagnetic changes and racial code structures KEY 116 38 - 47 will be graduated from the image of the Dragon, the devouring seed, if they are infused with the Living Light of the Christ. 43 The transformation of the specie occurs through the infusion of light crystals which generate a field of Light around the body and a feeding of Light to the body for the next stage of creation. 44 The Great White Brother - hood then takes the membrane of consciousness and brings it into the next stage within the Shekinah universe of Light which is in coor - dination with the Father universe and the Son universe. The Father and Son universes come together with the trinity of matter through the Great White Brotherhood, re - newing the energies of the physical universe. Man, at that time, will realize that he has been locked out from the millennium of a thousand other universal orders by his ob - liviousness to other worlds of Light. 45 Ultimately, the Great White Brotherhood carries the Light of the righteous out of the zones of de - struction, for the Brotherhoods are the receivers of the Light, whereby they purify civilizations and carry their Light into the Treasury of Light. 46 The People of God have now petitioned the Father, Son, and Shekinah universes to restore per - fect balance.

This enables the lower heavens to be recharged and the light of advanced intelli - gence to evolve from one sun sys - tem into multiple sun systems of both the physical sun systems of a given universe, and spiritual Son systems of the 'House of Many Mansions.' 33 We know through the higher teachings of science that there are regions in the center of our galaxy which have microns of light emana - tion as high as a hundred micron units. And we know there are bril - liant star fields, such as the region of W3 in our local universe, which are part of the central configuration of the North, South, East, and West Celestial Gates of 'the Throne' of our local universe. These are regions of Population I1 star systems burning with the energy of mill~ons and millions of suns. And it must be understood that Population I1 star systems which have .02 micron emissions are synonymous with inner testing zones of 'the Throne' which govern tests of ~00,000,000,000 stars in the visible spectrum of our 'mansion world system.' 34 Enoch told me that the power of Population I1 star sys - tems can create a whole variety of specie forms by double helicoidal interpenetation from one network center of Population 11 systems to a co - existing \" quanta deck t ' of worlds having the potential for all - times, lengths, masses, and energies, for unity between the mansion worlds. Movement into \" pure Godness \" transcends the biochem - ical boundary identity of each planet of the Mazzaroth. 35 The Mazzaroth allows for the development of a new specie con - taining twelve biochemical meri - dians. Once this is completed the specie form will go beyond this series of connections into a new network containing super - galactic clusters known as the Ma:al(~th. Enoch told me that the next local Mazaloth begins at 1.5 to 2 million light years from here. 36 The Councils of intelligence during the present galacttc program called 8033 - 45 have stations in the regions of 3C123, 3C263, 3C273, M87, Centaurus X3, Hercules XI, and other regions some of which are unfolding different light pat - terns which are just becoming known as tremendous neutron masses. The positive and negative masses of a neutron star contain multiples of different gravity fields which is the key to their tremen - dous light. 37 This is being revealed to Earth radiophysicists because, of the 73 sources of higher light gen - eration, twelve cannot be identified as conforming to commonly mea - sured light radio emissions. The twelve conform to what Earthman classifies as a new invisible spec - trum of radio stars all of which ap - pear to be working with maximum emissions of the 100 micron region. 38 The question IS 'How can \\tar clusters appear to have light working with 100 microns when the \"PopuIation I common star \" creates light working with a max - imum of 50 microns? Where is their 5ource of light?' The source is from higher powers of creation who have found ways of star coupling which allow millions of star fields to shoot out of a greater dimension of Light. These stars can place an ~nv~sible shell around their energy wurce 50 as to preserve the light ~~m~ss~ons which allow them to KFY 118 35-43 spawn new energy systems. 39 Enoch said, the greatest f~elds of star creation in our uni - verse which can spawn new energy systems are the colIective energy fields of Orion. In these fields there are light sources which form fields of triangular star definition which we cannot classify for they are beyond all forms of spectrum clas- sification that man uses. 40 These triangular star defini- tions contain sufficient brilliant light sources necessary to evolve the amino acids into the basic life structures of thinking intelligence 41 The triangular coordinates are part of the most sacred area of Orion known as The three stars In the belt of Orion form the central gr~d which is used by the Lords of Light in Orion as a star focal point for the creation of new galaxies. 42 It was also revealed that the region of Sagittarius has tremen - dous energy projections which trail out to the edge of our galaxy like arrows of light working with speeds going faster than our sun's light.

They also contain the weights and measures of the Cosmic Law that dictates the astronomical balances. For example, these weights and measures are used to guide the passing of one star system through another, pre- venting the annihilation of myriad life systems. 4 Moreover, the Mid-Way sta- tions educate planetary intelligence, providing knowledge on all levels from biology to astrophysics so that we can grow towards the greater understanding of the House of Many Mansions.

The \" h - bar \" constant is a symbol used in Max Planck's defi - nition of a constant derived from a light continuum. The name Arch - turus contains the \" h - bar \" con - stant for Archturus controls oper - ations dealing with cosmological constants in our Light continuum. 14 As we evolve a new as - trophysics and cosmology, we can - not move ahead into this New Age without taking inventory of all in - formation which has come to us from Archturus. We cannot ignore the \" Shepherd Guide, \" which stands right in front of us with the guiding staff or pointer. We must recognize that this truly is a living force of intelligence to which we must direct our attention. 15 As we develop the physical light technology to decode space signals coming in from Archturus and from their space technology orbiting within our solar system, we work with the scientific fulfill - ment of this key. 16 This technology from Arch - turus provides us with the knowl - edge of geophysical changes in re - lationship to larger astrophysical and spiritual transformations which affect the entire planet during quantum evolutionary changes. This knowledge is acquired by those who seek to understand the role of the Sons of Light. 17 In connection with this teaching, the Sons of Light have established certain pyramids in South America which are in direct alignment with Archturus and which give the time table of as - trophysical and geophysical change. 18 Archturus is our key in unit - ing our cosmology and as - trophysics, not with three - dimensional intelligence as we know it, but with systems of fifth to ninth dimensional intelligence in our middle heavens. Our purpose is to merge with them as we evolve toward the center of our galaxy and reign with the \" Sons of Light. \" 19 The zones governed by Mid - Way stations are extremely com p lex because of the multi - dimensional evolutions that must be supervised. Therefore, the Brotherhood of Light travels to and from the Mid - Way stations using EL - conversion spectrum units in their Merkabah vehicles; these units measure the age of various star systems before they are probed so as to avoid travel to planetary star systems which are, no longer"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"KEY 201 19 - 29 \" GO, \" that is, in existence. 20 When I was taken on a legion ship, I saw how the EL - conversion system is composed of ten pulsat - ing pyramids of Light, five of which are aligned on top and five are inverted so as to create the ap - pearance of five diamonds. Within each diamond are pulsating sets of dots showing the \" star patterns\" (as seen from the vehicle). 21 First, a known model of the star system is fed into the unit. Then through a series of light pulses, patterns from the stars are interfaced between the pyramidal angles of the first and last pyramid. This is done through the starship's light sensor system which picks up pulsations of light from the star's vertical A - line vectors which are re - ceived and transmitted to the base line of the first pyramid. There they meet with pulsating B - lines of anti - light measurement which are received as vertical lines from the star's reverse vectors. 22 Both A - line and B - line lights are synthesized at the base by a third light power generated in the EL - conversion system. From the combined synthesis the diamond subsets are used to form the vari - ous discharges into a matrix for Alpha - Omega analysis. 23 This operates as a shift regis - ter; if the star that appears in a diamond subset (which is one focal point of measurement on one end of one conic section) is seen also within the repeating diamond sub - set in another conic section which is opposite and removed in parallel phase from the former, the two confirm that that star is still \" GO \" and the dots align perfectly as a verification of its position. 24 In addition, another run is made to give the magnetic and color properties of the light pat - terns coming off stars showing the exact aging process of life, and the specific life track being occupied by any number of specie intelligences associated with a star. 25 Thus, by reading all manner of light appearance coming from the star, the vehicle intelligence can juxtapose the particle discharges enabling the starship to im - mediately determine how many species live in a given light density, how the species are organized ac - cording to communities and ecolog - ical systems, what type of energy and physical laws govern the species' environment, and many other geological, astronomical, and Metatronic formulations. 26 The EL - conversion also measures and delineates anti - matter zones. This is indispensable for the maintenance of Mid - Way stations, for many Mid - Way stations are working at mid - points of galactic recombination and thus exposed to the influences of tremendous star degeneration. 27 To begin to define \" EL, \" we must first define the momentum of a photon (mc) whose wavelength is il_- , i.e., mc = ?L ' 28 Furthermore, in the trans - formation of matter, E (defined as me2) will ultimately construct the portal line between the physical and spiritual universe where: where n = matter transformation. 29 This formula shows how the energy interaction equals matter transformation acted upon by the light constant squared. 30 When one expands the phys - ical universe on an order of metagalactic probability so 'm' ap - proaches zero and 'c' (3 x cm per second) approaches minus infinity, anti - matter annihilation is avoided and the function given as: E (MI c* . h\\i where v = velocity of particle (#c), and M = expanded hyper- dimensional matter. 31 This shows the special region where the properties of a physical and spiritual universe interact. 32 Thus, the EL function rep - resents the light conversion which is necessary for light to pass through new thresholds (which could have characteristics of anti - matter) and not explode. 33 Enoch told me the Mid - Way Councils also connect to form spe - cial Threshold Commands neces - sary to prevent forms of galactic in - telligence of one dimension from intervening and completely destroy - ing planetary species in other galac - tic dimensions. To violate the un - iformity of the life threshold by a \" warring intelligence \" necessitates intervention from the nearest Threshold Command through high frequency vehicles capable of dis- corporating any vehicle, if neces - sary, which violates Cosmic Law.

The magnetic moments are interrelated to optical properties and the electromagnetic spec - trum(~). 15 Under normal Earth condi - tions, the bases of nucleic acids contain instructions for at least 100 billion functions and operations necessary to build a human body. 16 Here we are considering that information is also stored in the DNA molecule in the form of \" words \" composed of three - base combinations of the Divine Name. 17 On each face of this divine grid of the deca - delta manifold there are 64 cells which show the harmonics that are used in divining life upon the waters of creation. 18 These faces represent a \" model \" which can be used to de - fine the DNA - RNA synthesis in present chromosomal development without the loss of any linkage from the first Adam to the present Adam. 19 Enoch showed me, while I was still within Merkabah, that the precise angular frequency of optical codes used in the geometry of life will differ from meta - galactic order to meta - galactic order, from cycle of Adam Kadmon to cycle of Adam Kadmon. 20 Therefore, he directed my at - tention to the Divine letters which are the master set behind the dis - tribution of the many types of an - gles and frequency rates of the op - tical code. 21 He explained to me that the deca - delta codes give direction to the DNA - RNA in the beginning. Once the DNA - RNA is started, however, there is spontaneous rep - lication through the angles and fre - quency codes, etc. This is con - tinued until a reprogramming takes place at which time a new coding function from the deca - delta (or the Merkabah) begins. 22 I saw that the grid network of the deca - delta manifold is com - posed of the original Hebrew divine language code, the Light resonance codes, the mathematical - geometric codes, the chemical codes working with a nucleotide base, and the membrane grid of amino acid bind - ing.

These letters form the image com - ponents which extend from the world of the Adam Kadmon through the world of negative mass, bringing the image necessary for the imprinting of divine life upon the primitive units of DNA- RNA. 24 The Divine Name gives the original code structure out of which the other planning centers proceed. The Divine Name also allows for the organization of spaces which are later used in the planting of the image - similitude coupling. 25 The second face is the divine \" light \" index for the letters of the Tetragrammaton where 9 (Yod) = 10, H(Hey) = 5, and 'j (Wod) = 6. This composes the ten Light picture superscripts or basic pyramidal structures upon which Life is coded from the deca - delta manifold. 26 It shows that the permuta - tions are within the rhythmical bal - ance of the vibratory nature of the divine letters; it establishes the ve - locity of Light for the various realms of creation. In the physical dimension, this Light is an all en - compassing particulate \" light. \" Therefore, it is through this grid that both gravity, and the forces operating between atoms, molecules, and sub - particles all fol - low the same Law in a particular dimension. 27 The third face is the distribu - tion of the twenty - two Hebrew let - ters so as to form a mantra grid which is coded into a given vibra- KEY 202 23 - 33 tory density. These are the codes available within the deca - delta manifold which are open for con - tinuous change within successive evolutionary programs. 28 The mantra - vibratory grid is the divine harmonics which coordi - nate the other vehicle forms (out - side our electromagnetic spectrum) to be simultaneous with the human life form. The mantra - vibratory grid is basically a grid of circuits by which the other five bodies have a major attachment to the human genetic system. 29 The Hebrew \" letters \" are used because they are, in actuality, thought - forms of Light vibration which control the higher force fields used to evolve all forms of intelligibility from the divine mind. The thought - forms are also coordi - nated with sound harmonics. 30 The mantra grid is composed of the primary chain formation which coordinates the arrangement of a life - giving program within an Alpha and Omega cycle. 31 The Hebrew divine letters WAlephri and Fl'Tav,' and the vowel segol('.') are coordinated by the divine breath so as to establish intervals between divine Light ter - mination periods (which transmute into UAA, UAG* and UGA). 32 Therefore, kese first three faces come from the divine mem - brane formed by the Name of God, coded within the deca - delta grid and uniquely ordered by the seed forms. 33 The corresponding \" lower \" three faces compose the 64 codes of DNA - RNA into the human elec - trochemical membrane. (However, the ordering of the grids them - selves does not follow a specific ar-"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"KEY 202: 33 - 42 rangement, but allows for each of the six faces to uniquely interface with one another and set in mo - tion the coding process of the lan - guage of life.) 34 The transducer coding grid deals with the 20 basic amino acids found in the proteins of all living tissues. Here they are synthesized into the physical membrane. The transducer coding grid is coordi - nated by the mantra - vibratory grid which allows for the infinite combinations of nucleotides to form proteins. Therefore, it opens up the activity of the membrane containing the nucleotide bases. (Here RNA does not code for the membrane, but helps build com - ponents for the membrane which is a self - associated lipid cell.) 35 These amino acids are re - spatialized into organic develop - ment through the Light geometries of the Hebrew letters. The unique - ness of this key is to show that there is a coding process for the code itself. 36 Whereas the third face is the distribution of the divine letters SO as to form a vibratory grid out of the 64 arrangements of the divine letters, the coding grid as the fourth face receives the original in - struction for the coding of numer - ous amino acids through Light messenger projections which coor - dinate grids three and four. 37 The Light messengers are pulsating letter geometries which comprise the activity of what is known in the language of biochemistry as tRNA. The tRNA is manifested as a Light messenger for YHWH, whereby the tRNA be - comes the linkage messenger for the divine Word which then acti - vates the membrane substance through \" chosen \" geometric forms. 38 A look at the hemoglobin molecule shows the importance of the formulations from the codes. Other biological programs that were carried out in the past reor - ganized the formulations which de - veloped, for example, elongated red blood cells. (Residual effects of this can be seen in tests involving torpid cells versus deoxygenated cells. ) 39 This flow process of mes - senger linkage (from the mantra grid to the transducer coding grid) can also be used for transformation from the divine to the human or the human to the divine, for the mantra - vibratory grid is the circuit diagram between the biophysical shell and the next unfoldment of the biological shell. For example, when Jacob's name was changed to \" Israel \" there was a biogenetic re - genesis established, whereby the seed of Jacob could grow into the \" divine seed \" and inherit the king - doms of Light. 40 In this chain formation se - quence of Light unto Life and Life unto Light it is also the vibratory grid which is the control mechanism for the \" Stop, \" express - ed in the Hebrew letters #'Aleph' and P'Tav' and the vowel segol (9. 41 Segol(,..) represents the di - vine breath being fused into the micro - molecular substratum of the primary amino acids. 42 In the human membrane the ''Stop \" represents the impulses known as uracil, adenine, guanine (UAG), uracil, adenine, adenine (UAA), and uracil, guanine, adenine (UGA) which represent the periods of termination in the chain formation of proteins and are the equivalent of the Omega points of divine regenesis. 43 The fifth face of the chemical building blocks is the combination of three of the four bases of U,A, C,G occurring in RNA (or T,A, C,G occurring in DNA). 44 Mathematical analysis shows that in the biosynthesis of protein, the mRNA codes each amino acid as a word in a sequence of three bases. This gives rise to 43 or 64 different words for the amino acids in proteins. Thus, 64 chemically unique combinations of three may be assembled for the four bases oc - curring in RNA. 45 The sixth face is the mathematical analog to the electri - cal valency of the molecule as a triplet communication code. This model is mathematically computed from the chemical grid where: U = 1, A = 2, C = 3, and G = 4. 46 Here the mathematics indi - cate the spacing of the angstrom linkage distances between the chemical elements and the com - plimentary hydrogen bonding of the base pairs in DNA - RNA. 47 This process is determined by the interconnection of all grids necessary for the ordering of the life codes. This mathematical spac - ing allows for the organic de - velopment of a biological substrate as we know it. 48 The mathematical grid is uniquely composed of 4 triple, 36 double, and 24 single mathemat - ical cells. 49 This reveals the profile of divine - human correspondence ex - pressed in the numerical relation - ship of the Twenty - Four Elders KEY 202 42 - 54 who stand before the Throne of God and govern the divine pro - grams of YHWH in the creation and recreation of the Adam Kad- mon. 50 Twenty - four also represents the twenty - four civilizations that are connected with the genetic de - velopment of the species upon this planet. 51 Enoch told me there is a thirty - six and thirty - six flow pattern which carries the harmonics and sets of cosmic vibrations out of which the architecture in the lower celestial regions is shaped. The thirty - six and thirty - six flow pattern is necessary for the sequence de - velopment of programs sent from the Throne. 52 Thirty - six also indicates the number of beings that are in the world yet completely identifiable with the energies of the Throne, SO that they can directly enter into the presence of the Throne through God's grace, to ascertain the se - quence involved in program man - ifestation. 53 The four triple configurations represent the four sacred letters of YHWH, as well as the four living creatures that stand before the Throne who are \" full of eyes \" used for evolving all forms of creation. Four also represents the key grids within the human anatomical struc - ture: the heart contains four cham - bers; within the brain, the medulla oblongata is a pyramidal structure that connects posteriorly with the spinal cord as a pyramidal head piece. 54 Moreover, the four triple configurations also represent how each codon is a \" triplet \" code de - rived from the four distinct bases"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"KEY 202 54 - 68 in DNA - RNA. 55 In summary, the mathemati - cal grid recapitulates the creative language mathematics of all the liv - ing creations that went into the Creation of Man. 56 The combination of all the grids shows how the Word is com - bined to take on form. The Word descends in an envelope of Light which is vibrated long enough to allow its vibration to spiral into dif - ferent codings of Light. 57 Through the image and sim - ilitude, given correspondences be - tween the divine image grid and the DNA - RNA grid can be activat - ed to allow for the expansion of a newborn organism. This takes place in six directions through cell growth unfolding with the progression of letters. The mathematical power of the letters increase to equal the in - crease of chemical complexity. 58 Just as the 64 Keys of Enoch came out of a fiery scroll, so also the 64 structures of DNA - RNA biosynthesis came out of a polariza - tion of divine Light which takes on form from the divine thought - forms expressed in our contemporary program of divine creation. 59 Divine creation continually expresses genesis and regenesis of divine names and genealogies through the image - making capacity of the Adam Kadmon. 60 God has determined through His messengers that there must be a registration of the genetic codes in every generation of His people upon the earth, so that Malachi's words (Malachi 4:6, \" And he must turn the heart of the fathers back toward sons, and the heart of sons back toward fathers; \" ) are ful - filled by the Son of Man re - capitulating the code of life of the Adam Kadmon! 61 The grid spiral of the six di - vine faces can be used for innu - merable programs of incarnation that are necessary to express the work of the Adam Kadmon. 62 The scientific representation of the genetic code structure was given in scripture to prepare Man for the Christ body so that through the vibratory redemption of the body by the Light, fallen humanity could attain to the Adam Kadmon. 63 Thus, the image and similitude of the Adam Kadmon comes into the world through scripture as the divine Word. 64 The image and similitude, through the grid of the Living Word, allow us to attain the high - er worlds by putting on the Christ Body of the Living Light. 65 The six faces fit together to form an ongoing helix. Out of this ongoing helix the base frequency defines the 'pattern integrity' for structural organization of the human being. 66 Thus, the base frequency patterns are modulated so as to de - fine the final corpus design that was preordained in the helix. 67 The corpus design flows from the divine \" letters \" emitting base frequencies which are shaped into 72 pentagons in a sphere (cor - responding to the 72 Divine Names of the Father) forming a platform for the dihedral model of angles plus five tetrahedrons which con - trol the transfer mechanisms of biological energy. 68 This formation allows for \" the spinning DNA - RNA Light grid \" to code for numerous amino acids from the many helical combi - nations that are possible. 69 This Light grid represents a given biological code which can be used in multiple spectrums of space to create different mam - malian experiments operating within various light dimensions. However, in the genetic coding of a specie, the space occupation must match the electromagnetic index into which it is moving. 70 Yet, this grid still remains open to other frequencies, operat - ing within parallel space dimen - sions, into which another bio- logical - physical form can be evolved to correspond (to the mul - tiple activities of the Overself body) in many different electromagnetic spectrums. 71 Such a grid can be used to directly infuse the Overself body into an eka body of many physical creations. Thus, many physical bodies emanate from one Overself body. 72 They who come into physical being from a divine Overself form come out of a complete and holistic Overself model, whose numerologi - cal sequence and divine letters still pass into material form through these grids of creation. Yet, the two are synthesized as a unified manifestation. 73 In summary, the 64 Light grid model opens the door to the energy transducing system of our Alpha - Omega showing: (1) the universality of the basic biological mechanisms; (2) the mechanism of protein synthesis; and (3) the na - ture of the genetic code. 74 The grid shows the same unity and coherence underlying the whole field of biological planning according to the divine letters of KEY 202 68 - 80 the Father's Name. 75 Enoch told me even greater experiments can be done with DNA - RNA when biophysicists in - terface two electromagnetic fields SO as to create a neutral zone. 76 These experiments will be a significant key to future biophysics, in that they will demonstrate how the DNA - RNA can be adjusted to accommodate higher frequencies of Light. 77 For by placing these divine codes within a neutral zone sur - rounded by a higher electromagnet - ic wavelength environment, the common heterocyclic ring is broken permitting the life codes to be re - programmed genetically to operate in a less dense physical form (like the triple helix - a synthesized molecule in vitro). 78 Therefore, the new gel capac - ity will demonstrate the ability to live in high frequency light radia - tions (i.e., waves that can go faster than the speed of light) and will exemplify the mutation of the phys - ical form that is necessary for those beings who plan to survive the great changes in light radiation when our sun goes into an elec - tromagnetic null zone. 79 This null zone is necessary for the reprogramming of our genetic structure. And by utilizing the process of combining light radi - ations in a neutral zone, our biophysicists will be able to co - participate in the connecting of the DNA - RNA nuclei to chromosomes of another evolutionary inheritance. 80 This co - participation will take place under the direct administra - tion of the Brotherhood of Light who will reprogram us to go into a higher wavelength of light."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"KEY 202 87 - 88 81 This reprogramming takes place through the intersecting of one divine program with another spinning program of a new biologi - cal network, forming the structure of a high spinning octahedron. This super - octahedron allows for the packaging of geometric forms which house the DNA - RNA as it is carried along one grid of creation into another. 82 When Man can utilize this process he will be able to go into a cross - matching of bodies of differ - ent light thresholds and selectively breed and \" acquire \" positive characteristics from the gene pool of advanced galactic civilizations. 83 The use of the new codings will: (1) prepare man to occupy new space - time thresholds; (2) overcome the aging process of a given biological inheritance; (3) create a bioenergy pulse which is capable of being used with infinite space arrangements, so that the biological system is not limited to any planetary field, but can freely circumnavigate beyond the galactic graviton spectrum; and (4) allow for a new cross - matching with the genetic spiral of life by the synthe - sis of light such as ultraviolet light. 84 Here the ultraviolet which normally makes DNA impossible to transcribe (emitting light from T to T * which is absorbed at 260 nm) allows the magnetic stack transi - tions and magnetic vectors to change and become parallel as life emerges on the other side of the null. 85 Along with these important biological mechanisms of inheri - tance, Man will use a language coding of life which is beyond the biological language of acid dena - turation. 86 Man will use codes with a new biological language of light in - duction from other biological realms living in other electro - magnetic spectrums. 87 Even in our biological realm of creation it is important to teach the scientists of this world that matter is generated from Light. All species of Life are made possible by birth in material nature through the \"1 AM seed \" given by the Di - vine Father. 88 Without understanding the \" I AM seed \" of the Adam Kad- mon, the image and similitude cannot be but part of \" one Tree of Life, \" instead of the many \" Trees of Life f ' pomised to the faithful of the Father who will ascend into the many creations."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"THE KEYS TO FUTURE BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOCHEMICAL GENETICS ARE GIVEN IN MANY DOUBLE HELIXES FOR A GIVEN CHROMOSOME AND IN MANY COORDINATED MEM - BRANE SEPARATORS TRANSMITTING MULTIPLE MAM - MALIAN ORDERS TO THE LIVING CHROMOSOMAL FUNC - TIONS. \" ALL ARE THE FACES OF THE ETERNAL PRESENT. \" 1 Enoch explained that there would be found many double helixes in a given chromosome al- lowing for many faces of Adamic creation to be evolved from the central code7 all having the image and similitude of the Eternal pres- ent. 2 Just as man has studied the double helix pattern that goes to - ward life, man must begin to con - centrate on the double helix pattern that expands toward death - where the magnetic repulsive force separates two strands of the double helix. 3 By working with the discor- porating double helix forms and by changing the structure of hydrogen bonding that holds together the long helical chains of the nucleic acidsi man will discover the exis - tence of other double helix ma- trices. 4 These other chemical matrices can be used to evolve bodies that are capable of living in other chem - ical environments, including non- earthly environments consisting of ammonia, methane, and formal- dehyde atmospheres. 5 The molecular structure of nucleic acid dictates the character of the proteins synthesized. There- fore the restructuring of the molecules changes the character of the proteins synthesized through hydrogen bonding. This engineer - ing of the hydrogen bonding within the nucleotide units takes place in a neutral zone created be - tween two electromagnetic fields, whereby a high energy proton in- terface can take place. 6 Consequently, the hydrogen bonds which hold the helix itself together can be changed even to a multiple hydrogen bond system. With the multiple hydrogen bond system, the centrosome body can be made to divide the chromo- somes to grow multiple arms, heads, and organs necessary for life in other environments, 7 In addition, by controlling the dwarf and giant syndromes within the mechanisms of inheritance, a miniature specie can be evolved which can absorb less physical sub - stance in interstellar flight or a gar- gantuan specie be evolved which can have a greater resilience to live"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"KEY 203 7 - 18 in the atmosphere of Jovian - like planets. 8 There is a complex code that can be generated out of the basic DNA chain allowing for the triple helix to be created out of the dou - ble helix.

However, each set of bodies can be made to carry a dif - ferent nucleic acid template on which proteins of specific stereoisomeric forms have been synthesized. 10 These bodies - by rearrang - ing the codes - would have differ - ent skin layers that could appear silvery or bluish or almost in any combination of color patterns de - sired for membrane coverage. 11 Presently Adamic man exists between a C-H-0 and a C - H - N system capable of harnessing the key combinations of elements which would give him liberation to enter any other chemical environ - ment with an acid denaturation code using anyone of the following combinations: CHO CFO CClO CHN cm CClN CHP CFP CClP CHS CFS CClS 12 The helical nucleic acid molecules have a conformational order that attracts specific protein molecules having stereospecificity. By altering the proton matrix con - trolling the engineering of the present double helix and introduc - ing multiple Magnetic fields to a generating proton similitude, sub- specie intelligence can be created. 13 By changing the density fields which triggers the chemical transmitter molecules, specie forms can be created having an intelli - gence which is directly connected to a parent mind by virtue of pro - ton precession at the same fre - quency. 14 In other words, just as the higher mind can experience many worlds simultaneously, this new creation will also possess the ability to occupy those realms by multiple physical embodiments all connected with one mind. 15 Thus, one mind will transmit to many bodies as one genetic code is used as the master code for many biological entities. 16 Hence, the bioengineering of the Higher Evolution demonstrates even the ability to live underwater in different planetary environments where the Higher Evolution can build \" cities \" with special environ - ments for the training of their offspring. 17 In a previous cycle, the At- lanteans were also able to live un - derwater. However, the Atlanteans also possessed the ability to create sub - specie intelligence to govern the nature of the material world. This inner breeding within these sub - specie forms gave rise to a di - minishing spiritual capacity and produced a nation of strong physi - cals who were muscular and emo - tionally aggressive, but did not have the higher consciousness planes which would allow them to spiritually evolve out of the chang - ing genetic - planetary conditions. 18 For this reason the Council of Light permitted the Atlanteans to partially destroy themselves as a witness for other cycles of spiritual - physical creation. 19 In this Age, the new bioen - gineers will have the ability to transmit a genetic code by laser- engineering to members of another race which would then transcribe the chemistry of that Adamic form to dwell in another environment. 20 In other words, the bioen - gineers will have the ability to use a laser - like light projection (e.g. by optical rotation) to demodulate a complete physical form into an energy form which can be pro - jected to a vehicle or an environ - ment in the lower heavens where it can be remodulated into the same physical form. This is called biolo- cation. 21 Biolocation takes place under a variety of conditions providing protonic flux is controlled. By con - trolling protonic flux by the use of new energy forms called cosmvprvto~is, the chemistry of man can go through a chain - like cou - pling to be remanifested at another point on the earth or other planets that may even exist on a higher frequency. 22 This ability to use new mechanisms of inheritance must be performed with absolute responsi- KEY 203 19 - 24 bility towards the Cosmic Law. Every Father universe requires of every specie in the many realms of our Son universe - peace, love, and non - interference with the biological kingdoms outside of a given image and similitude unless directly permitted by the Councils. 23 Without the higher repro - gramming being done at this time with direct sanction of High Com - mand for the regeneration of the Adamic race and the preparation of the Christ people for new worlds of creation, a change in biological life could not now evolve on Earth, since any organic compounds formed would be oxidized, rather than forming more complex organic compounds. It is not sufficient to possess only the correct elements for a new chemical evolution. They must also be present in the correct proportions as willed by the Lords of Light. 24 Through this great biological change of our threshold, the bioen - gineers will recognize the words of the Father when He says :\"I AM the source of all spiritual and ma - terial worlds.

The C~wrzic W/zeel of L~je ~11thin the Waters of Creat~oi~< THE KEYS TO THE \" SONS OF LIGHT \" ARE GIVEN IN THE TRANSMISSIONS OF \" LIVING ENERGY CODES \" WITHIN THE \" PEOPLE OF GOD. \" THEY ARE SENT FROM LIVING UNIVERSE TO LIVING UNIVERSE TO REVEAL THE CODES OF LIGHT TO THE ORDERS OF EVOLVING SPECIE WITHIN CELLULAR TIME SO THAT THE CODED NUCLEIC MEMBRANES MAY ATTACH WITH THE \" LARGER MEMBRANE OF UNiVERSES.\" 1 The *'Sons of Light i ' project the geometries of creation into fourth - dimensional space in order to code spiritual mankind into the fifth dimension, the next larger membrane of universes. The reveal - ing of the codes of Light extend through telethought comunication which is produced by the modula - tion of gravitational waves. The gravitational waves carry the cod- lngs of Light intelligence from the larger membrane of universes. 2 You as \"a believer \" can re - ceive modulated gravitational wave factors that are sent from a Higher Evolutionary Master intelligence of Light. This transmission of knowl - edge contains codes of Light that give you the realization of God's purpose and recognition of where we are in relation to the large^ evolving universe. 3 This knowledge comes both as a Light force and as a Love force. This is expressed through God's Infinite Mind as Eh~jel? Asher Ehyeh, I AM that I AM, which gives teaching and understanding to our creation through the Hierar - chy for the remaking of our evolv - ing specie within cellular time. 4 We exist only within our con - sciousness time cell until that point where we work directly with the Hierarchy commissioned by the Father to recapitulate the program of Alpha and Omega. 5 Our time and space are the dimensions of time cell conscious - ness ordered by the greater star seed image. The image is given by the Higher Intelligence as the con - figuration for connecting the spatial vibrations of the first chakra to the seventh, eighth, and ninth chakras of the Higher Evolutionary Light. 6 The movement towards energy embodiment of the fifth di - mension begins with a mutual programming created by projected energy codes creating an eighth and ninth chakra vibratory level. When this takes place, the first and second chakra influences dominat - ing organic three - dimensionality are changed. The human system ac - quires additional eighth and ninth chakra energy fields which are necessary to receive and send geometries of the Living Light. 7 A series of biomagnetic"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"KEY 204 7 - 15 energy resonances are balanced with the eighth and ninth chakra levels so as to open the human vibratory field through a complete energy conversion. Through gravi - tational flux lines, the Higher Intel - ligence connects the first and eighth spatial wave controlling the magnetic lines of force, the seventh spatial wave controlling the elec - trostatic lines of force, and the ninth spatial wave controlling the gravitational lines of force, so we can be sufficiently altered into any of the nine dimensions in our local universe. (Here, the energy plural - ity produces a unique effect for travel through metagalactic order - ing~ where Gravity is uniquely overcome.) 8 From this Light encoding, the physical body and the Overself body become one, so that the phys - ical form can be seen simultane - ously in two or more locations. 9 The words \" Larger Membrane of Universes \" are set off by special markings which represent a key within a key. This emphasizes that the larger membrane exists in other universes, many of which are far beyond us in their evolutionary make - up. The larger membrane shows us that we function as the finger cells and toe cells of the Higher Mind processing knowl- edge as the Brotherhoods pulsate their wisdom into us. 10 We must understand how the larger life force of local uni - verses collectively forms both part of the Eternal Mind and part of our galactic network which issues forth biological programs bringing Alpha and Omega together. When the Alpha - Omega cycle is completed, the Magnetic fields shift causing genetic information to be adapted to a new biotechnology of light. The Magnetic fields create neutral zones for the interfacing of high speed molecules which control growth and development in all liv - ing things. 11 We are going into a different membrane program at this time. This new program requires that the genetics of Man function on a higher wavelength of light. In order to accomplish this the Brotherhood of Light is accelerating the entire system of human biorhythms to enter a less dense spectrum of matter - energy. 12 The Brotherhood of Light is changing the electromagnetic den - sity so that the electrification of matter prepares Man for the dom - ing of his Overself body. We are going directly into a new star threshold with a new Magnetic vib - ration which is changing the whole nuclear membrane on this planet. 13 New Magnetic fields pene - trate the tRNA molecule varying the intensity of the field and caus - ing the hydrogen atoms to produce more units as they relate to the geometric bonding of the DNA pentagon. 14 Realizing then, that the uni - verse around us is gauged by many wave factors of electromagnetism, we can realize how man, as an electromagnetic computer, is con - trolled by a still larger Gravitational time grid which is different from our spectrum. 15 We as an Earth specie have been using the wrong attitude, the wrong science, the wrong wavelength of measurement in try - ing to penetrate gamma pulsations and other energy codes coming into our spectrum from other thresholds: e.g., Arcturus, M42, 3C263, 3C273, Tau Ceti, and Be - telgeuse. 16 We have been using the wrong measurements with hydro - gen, formaldehyde, and ammonia bands to try to understand why these signals should be coming from distant radio stars, like Cygnus - X formations and quasi - stellar formations in our larger uni - verse. 17 Once we can accept the fact that these distant \" Sons of Light i ' communicate beyond our known electromagnetic spectrum, we can understand why this key states that the \" Sons of Light \" must imprint upon our spectrum new living energy codes which will raise the consciousness of our evolving specie so that we can be coded into their larger membrane. 18 However, some of these energy codes are placed on our present electromagnetic spectrum so consciousness interaction can be stimulated. 19 Therefore, when the scien - tists of the Earth retool their elec - tromagnetic measurements with new energy codes of consciousness, the biocommunication signals from other species can be received and used to help us project into new planetary environments, on new biological wavelengths which will allow us to cross the old elec - tromagnetic spectrum on which our present civilization is based. 20 As in the cycle of the Adam Kadmon, we will communicate back to our parent source of Light. 21 This is the tremendous sig - nificance of this Zohar key, for it explains that we, as one living inn KEY 204 1 i-27 sub - system of intelligence, pulsate within larger evolutions of star in - telligence.

These intel - ligences can assume any physical form necessary to operate in any given time - space sequence. In our consciousness time zone, they can appear in space vehicles creating pyramidal patterns of light in the sky. The onlooker will often see one of those expressions as three space vehicles flying in triangular formation. 3 These vehicles operate as \" Wheels - within - Wheels,'' whereby one inner wheel of technology is surrounded by an outer wheel hav - ing energy portals. 4 The inner wheel becomes an inner pyramid when entering vari - ous realms of space habitation. And this pyramid, by changing its faces into any color spectrum, is capable of screening different forms of intelligence for specie identifica - tion and communication. The color screening of various realms is necessary because each specie is organized on different rays of Light. 5 The color cap is also added over the vehicle's geometries for a"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"KEY 205 5 - 14 greater multiplexity of function, such as to bring out the magnetic features that have to be crossed when the vehicle is interacting with different spectrums of intelligence. For the higher Intelligence to cross our light threshold, it must cross over a multitude of Magnetic thxesholds. This is done by sending out different levels of light to measure, by different color sets, the volume, depth, and space of a given magnetic field that the vehi - cle crosses. 6 And in order to establish communication, it is necessary that these Merkabah vehicles of Light use pyramidal color caps to adapt their energies to whatever radiation of color their vehicle is traveling through. 7 For example, when the blue - white pyramids of the higher frequency interface with light do - mains of singular sun systems (in the main sequence phase), one order of chem~cal Intelligence is able to relate to another by chang - ing its color cap of spectrum light conversion even within three - dimensional reality. 8 In addition, the entrance and exit points of gravitational fields also have specific color codes and narrow charm resonances which must be used if the vehicle is to tunnel through abrupt discon - tinuities which could cause danger or damage. 9 Through the alternating gravi - tational fields a whole standing wave is created by multiple nodal points each expressing a different color cap. These additional color caps allow Merkabah to establish a \" covenant of Light \" with many realms of intelligence that may be sharing the same life space but ex - isting on different levels of a given star field. 10 Therefore, the minds of the Brotherhood within the vehicle change the central conic section which, in turn, changes the whole structure of the vehicle enabling it to shift directly into a new plane - tary life sphere as it crosses into new light zones. 11 Furthermore, the Higher In - telligence is capable of placing a color cap over a species' radiation and recode that species' radiation and knowledge index into a form synchronous with the majority of specie forms identified with the vehicle's program. This is done to allow for a sharing and cooperative mapping of individual evolutions into collective evolutions. 12 The key explains how wheels of technology, modulated by thought waves from Son universes, can visit the outer limits of our galaxy and communicate through \" Faces of Pyramids. \" These are not three - dimensional geometries of In - animate matter but multi - dimensional pyramidal combina - tions which form the inner wheel of the Merkabah vehicle. 13 These multi - dimensional pyramidal combinations Include what Enoch calls triangular bipyramids which are pyramids con - necting at the base line so as to re - volve as a sphere. 14 Their purpose is to connect one planetary realm with other planetary realms in the same \" con - sciousness time cell. \" For example, they are capable of sharing two dif - ferent density realms simultane - ously so that speciehood from one density can be transferred into a Illustrated by Robert C Schwartz Multi - Stage Merkabah forming Bipyramidal Command Vehicles -A -"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Illustrated by Robert C.

They are capable of controlling the space - time singularities that are lo - cated w~thin miniwhiteholes and miniblackholes everywhere in our local universe which allow them to move from the exterior of three - dimensional universes to the in - terior of hyperspace universes and vice versa. 16 But bipyramids are limited to the frequencies that surround the lower planetary systems and there - fore are not able to work with more than two categories of intel - ligence simultaneously. 17 Therefore, the bipyramids are used to administer the Cosmic Law to the lower heavens and yet they are limited in their navigation. 18 The blpyramids do allow evolutionary creation to connect with the next ordering of evolution enabling one life system to move directly into the next \" stepping stone i ' in the greater evolution. 19 Therefore, the triangular bipyramid is one of the forms ex - pressing the Merkabah. It nurtures god level growth to god level - 1 status among the planetary intelli - gences on the outer edges of their respective galaxies which are biological testing zones. 20 Next on the order of expres - sing the Merkabah intelligence are the tripyramids which are pyramids that connect at a central capstone so as to fuse pyramidal structures tnto one energy manifold. 21 The tripyramid is able to KEY 205 14-27 span several levels of energy and operate in several co - existing tlme dimensions, not being limited to a singular super - plane (i.e., event horizon). 22 The tr~pyramids are used to stabilize the prime infinitesimal kinetic units so that proper move - ments can be made between units of kinetic mass into a triplet of mass - energy interactions. Here the tripyramids allow for the reproces - sing and balancing of energy going to and from kinetic energy. 23 Thus, the tripyramids work through the distribution cells of the kinet~c energy momenta in all mass - energy. Kinetic energy is con - stantly transferable by their mechanisms of interchange. 24 However, throughout infinite space and tlme, new kinetic energy is continually being created and conserved by the tripyramids. They must ~nterface momenta units in order to allow intell~gence to use one particular type of energy source to go from one or several levels of one consciousness body of time directly into other time zones. 25 This allows vehicle intelli - gence to leave ~ts galaxy and to travel to other galaxies in ~ts Father universe carrying out the will of the Councils of Light. 26 In order to be in harmony with the Cosmic Law when this travel occurs between universes, all laws of motion created or used by the tr~pyramids must be universally and perpetually valid for all ve- locihes. 27 All scales of intelligence in all frames of matter - energy starting from the prime infinitesimal parti - cles, next to zero mass, and work - ing up to the largest systems of"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"KEY 2G5 27 - 37 masses, are affected by the tripyramidal Merkabah. It moves through the heavens by using a synchrosimilarity to reach many levels of intelligence, with the mes - sage of change and deliverance, coordinating Higher Evolutionary technology. 28 Thus, the Merkabah vehicle that carries tripyramids is used only by the Lords of Light to ad - vance civilizations and to form new galactic federations. 29 They are able to collectively advance, at the end of a given cycle of creation, independent levels of living intelligence that oc - cupy the same life space yet live in different electromagnetic spectrums. This advancement is unique be - cause it allows the various levels of intelligence to be coordinated to - gether for the first time allowing them all to see that their different levels of civilizations are linked \" physically \" and consciously to - gether as a unified intelligence. 30 Within the tripyramid three bodies of Light are seen; these bodies are individually distinct, and perform individual assignments as to: the giving of the Law; the measuring of the planetary intelli - gence so as to determine how much of the Law shall be dis - pensed; and, the calculation of \" the age \" of the planetary life system of where the specie is in its track of evolution, in terms of the complete age of the planetary life system. 31 Furthermore, the three be - ings are unified by virtue of a Light sphere which is placed around their bodies allowing them to oper - ate in different density levels, yet participating in an interchange of bodies. They can navigate in widely varying densities of creation where several life systems of intel - ligence are helped simultaneously. 32 The three beings are part of a great Brotherhood of intelligence that travels between the galaxies educating the lower worlds as to the true nature of the Infinite Way. 33 These beings represent the coordination of the Galactic Com - mands of Michael, Metatron, and Melchizedek. These bodies come together as a unit to form a govern - ing Pyramid of Knowledge. 34 The vehicle, by changing its color capstone and matching a new color spectrum with a given hyperspace, can overlap one galac - tic dimension with another without having to travel along a singular dimension taking thousands of light years just to travel from one galaxy to another. 35 In summary, the triangular bipyramid and tripyramid are es - sential parts of a giant brain net - work, for they are working with several space thresholds and have the capacity of universal communi - cations and reprogramming for multiple dimensions of intelligence. 36 Furthermore, in order to work with the \" giant brain, \" the outer wheel of the matter - energy Merkabah contains \" ten energy \" spokes. These control the environ - mental field into which planetary beings are taken as they pass through the magnetic null and are brought to their next ordering of specie mapping. 37 The environmental field is like a gravity compression zone in which magnetic and non - magnetic"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"KEY 211-7 37 - 47 vibrations can be altered while the vital life forces are mamtained. 38 In the lower planetary di - mensions where a physical man - ifestation for the ~nitiate is the only reality link with other intelhgence, the matter - energy beings within these vehicles create the function of t~ansu~rulence to energize the body of the initiate and biolocate his body into the vehicle's environment through the energy portals where the subject is provided with howl- edge to serve his reality link. 39 Those from this planet who will proceed to other star evolu - tions will mostly be taken through bipyramidal and tripyramidal man - ifestations of the Merkabah of Light. However, since this is the completion of a grand cycle of evolutionary change, the Higher Evolution which uses the tri- pyramid has the final say as to the arrangement of how bipyramidal and tripyramidal intelligence coop - erate in space. 40 The bipyramids and tri- pyramids are the keys to future cosmological forms that are able to bridge the different galactic societies. They should not, how - ever, be seen as the \" be - all \" or \" end - all, \" rather they are the es - sential facings for the unfoldment of Higher Evolutionary technology with planetary societies. 41 And where a pyramidal life zone of light is established along a given energy meridian of a planet by the teachers of the Christ Race - there bipyramids and tri- pyramids of light intersect by means of coordinating grids permit - ting vast matter - energy technology from other interplanetary levels to land on the planet's surface. 42 Therefore, the overall config - uration of the Merkabah vehicle, in conjunction with the energy meri - dians of a planet, can create a time warp coordination for other vehi - cles to enter into the human elec - tromagnetic field and rest upon the face of the Earth. 43 In other words, the creation of time warps by the Merkabah vehicle, allows other vehicles used by the Brotherhood of Light, called spectrum vehicles, to cross the human light - life spectrum and en - code their intelligence into any spectrum embodiment of light in the lower worlds. 44 However, before other vehi - cles can enter, the Merkabah must first come into our light - life zone through rotational circumversion, a process of separating the mag - netic structure of our electromag - netic field, and create an artijiczal tzme warp. 45 The artifrczal time rilarp is a respatialization of the core relation - ship within the nucleus of the atom which is made up of three spatial fields that intersect and synthesize with three incoming conic sections of Merkabah light. The light of the incoming sections is called Ori~im, and the respatializing of the core nucleus is accomplished by matter waves of Light which uniquely combine p mesons, K mesons, etc. These particles are anchored to - gether - not by chance - but with unit entities that predominate towards coupling actions. 46 Through the spatial openings caused by the discharges in the core nucleus, the Merkabah oc - cupies our light - life zone while not being of the same light. 47 Thus, the Merkabah vehicles of Light descend upon our planet, whereby a field of 11ght is opened and \" whole light be~ngs\" descend as the Magnetic fields of the space - time overlap are controlled. 48 These \" whole light bodies \" come down through the artificial time warp zones and land upon the face of the Earth. And this is what the ancients beheld when they saw \" the pillar of the cloud go up from before their face. \" 49 And Merkabah will continue to witness until we of the earth are reprogrammed according to the glories of the Father's Throne. For the Father's Throne has and will continue to govern new programs of glory during all stages of our soul advancement throughout the heavens, 50 This is a constant program within the Light continuum bring - ing systems and sub - thresholds to - gether into new variegated patterns and placing them on greater spirals so as to achieve new life combina - tions on an infinite scale. 51 Here in this artificial time warp zone, in the greater body of transparency, the impregnation of new realms of time - space are brought forth into the chemistry of the specie. 52 This can cause the bodies of the specie being probed to adjust themselves to a new physical form. This impregnation into the bio - chemistry of the given specie pro - ceeds through vibrations of chromodensity. 53 The chromodensity is con - trolled by the Merkabah projecting its energy into the meridians of the planet marked by Urim - Thummim deposits. These deposits make up the equivalent of twelve pulsating KLY 207 47-58 crystals, some of which are of the vibrations of alexandrite, amethyst, sapphire, etc. The activation of these crystals by the Merkabah creates a proton spm coupling so that our body becomes sensitized to their Light and can be remade into a more perfect form cell by cell. 54 Hence, in these movements of time, forward and reverser from the Alpha - Omega cons~iousness time zone of one age through the throne and dominions of new Alpha - Omega ages, fields of the Father's Love are exchanged; \" whole light beings \" physically materialize on planets; and planet - ary beings of physical form ascend through the \" Tabernacle of Tes - timony \" into other life realms. 55 This changing of a species' distribution capacities and the vary - ing parameters of its objective real - ity takes place through what the Higher Evolution calls a spce-time ozvrlap. 56 After the \" whole light be - ings\" physically materialize on planets, they are able to return to their original energy form because their pyramidal modes of creative activity have already been estab - lished on their original frequenc y of light. 57 Therefore, in this key we are told how the Ophanim, the mes - sengers of Light, come through spirals of advanced orders of intel - ligence on a scale of what we call the fifth dimension on up (to the twenty - fourth dimension) of our Son universe. 58 Through an energy \" wheel - within - a - wheel, \" bipyr- amids and tripyramids create spiral openings and through rotational"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"KEY 205 58-6'1 circumversion open up time warp zones by pyramidal geometries which encode bipyramid and tripyramid coordinates within our level of creation. This is the crea - tion of an artificial time warp zone. 59 The messengers of Light have the ability to create an artifi - cial time warp zone to liberate man, even in his physical flesh, from being trapped in his black and white spirals of energy. But man without his own spiritual consciousness body will only re - turn to incarnate again and again as a sub - Adamic intelligence. 60 Therefore, the Higher Evolu - tion comes first to awaken and raise the consciousness of the specie by very intricate maneuvers and regenerate intelligence by plac - ing a higher color coding around a given specie. 61 Oftentimes this is done by giving a very elaborate system of star keys and through these star keys or messages various levels of specie creation can be holistically remapped. 62 The star keys given in the past are timepieces deposited within the Earth's energy fields to enable succeeding generations of the Earth's inhabitants to discover how their consciousness can be in - fluenced by these timepieces and connect to an Infinite Way. 63 The timepieces set up in basin areas, in the mountains, or beneath oceans indicate where the vehicle \" wheels - within - wheels \" have operated on the earth plane to explore and program molecular forms of creation. During the pro - cess of activating these magnetic timepieces of civilizations, the pyramidal vehicles of Light will once again come down as the cap - stone to complete the pyramid. 64 Hence, at our stage of break - ing with earthbound consciousness the vehicle becomes the central point of activity for it illustrates the evolutionary model that can trans - fer scientific communities from planet to planet. 65 In summary, the Merkabah shows Man how to use a universal language of multi - level instruction through its intricate maneuvers and the star keys which they leave behind. Their language is a lan - guage of Light which communi - cates to any creation through light graphics and pulsations. Through this language Man acquires an un - derstanding of the levels of higher intelligence. 66 Oftentimes, this is accomp - lished by beaming a message across the vehicle so that as the pyramidal control starts to spin, all four faces of consciousness mapping can be seen at the same time - as in the experience of Yehezqel (Ezekiel). When all four faces of the vehicle are seen together one understands the complete program of the star probe. 67 The face of the Bull, as it is seen in the scriptures of Yehezqel represents Taurus - Orion which in ancient astronomy gives the origin of the Merkabah vehicle as coming from Orion. 68 The Lion face shows the probe of our sun system by the Merkabah vehicle; in the higher evolutionary astronomy a Lion- Solar face represents a Population I system on the edge of a greater central sun. 69 The Eagle face, in terms of the ancient scroll, tells, us that the probe is exploring our galaxy and represents, by its outstretched wings, the enormous spiral arms of an Sb* or Sc series galaxy. 70 Another face will have the \" appearance of Man \" but does not constitute \" the substance \" of an earthling. The face in the likeness of Man shows the overlap carried from higher evolutionary creation to the human evolutionary creation. 71 So all four faces come to - gether giving the similitude needed to coordinate the specie to go from the image of its dragon - like en - tropy to the image of positive cen- tropy, the 'Dove,' as creation fully manifested and redeemed. 72 In the image and the lan - guage of the 'Dove' we find re - vealed the mystery of mutual pro - gramming. The Dove descends on top of the pyramid of creation when the intelligence of a given creation is ready to go through its pyramidal life zone. 73 The Dove gives to the pyramid the Eye of Horus which is used to remake the pyramid pro - gram of Man into the design of the Father by connecting the Eye of Horns with the Eternal Eye of God. 74 The Eye of Horus sends out radiations of Light as the gateway to new dimensions through which Man ascends. The center of the Eye is a \" whitehole \" of the plus and minus rotations of force fields turned over by circumversion. Out of the \"whitehole\" comes the white 'Yod,\" the cosmic flame used to create new spectrums of light and alphabets of creation. 'Our present galactic model is accepted as the Sb type. KEY 205.69 - 80 75 Until the Eye of Horus ar - rives, the consciousness of the Adam is trapped within the karmic spirals of the planispheres as a ' wheel of time. As long as the con - sciousness body of the Adam re - mains exclusively within the karmic cycle his spiritual body cannot take his physical body into other galactic environments. 76 Karmic release can only come when the Father is petitioned to allow the wheel of time to attach itself to a wheel of Light, and through this interpenetration of one creative cycle to another, two conic sections or two cones of Light syn - chronize each other, and the Star of David is formed. 77 The Higher Intelligence can and will select the physical beings who will continue to go on to other planetary worlds where physical bodies are required. But those physicals who will be taken in these Merkabah vehicles will have loved and served their fellowman and will love whatever specie the Father would assign them to. 78 Most physicals continuing in the purified physical form will be used to seed life after their own kind so as to nurture respect for the 'Adamic image' on other physi - cal planes.

Rather than extending himself through the face of entropic space, man is caught within the belly of the Leviathan and prevented from attaching his biological life station to other life stations. 15 Human life must intercon - nect with higher galactic systems KEY 206 15 - 17 The Struggle between The Serpent and The Dove for the Ascension of The Species where language transparencies of evolution issue forth to announce that we are one in the House of Many Mansions. 16 The key, then, is speaking of the Yotzer Amarotli, the Creator of the Luminaries, who through the Hierarchy of the Luminaries gives the astrochemical programs of life extending knowledge from universe , to universe, life station to life sta - tion. 17 Enoch explained to me that the sub-life stations must wage war against the biochemical rhythms of the dragon creation which keeps them as recipients of limited knowledge. However, only the Sons of Light can resolve this war between the various biochemical levels by opening up the body of the Leviathan so that open - ended star movement towards perfection is possible."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"KEY 206 18 - 24 18 The Leviathan is the tradi - tional symbol which the ancients took to mean the entrapment of man within primordial spirals which deny the ongoing Glory and Presence of the Eternal Mind. 19 As long as Man thinks he is god he will never acquire the angelic radiations of true creation. 20 For this reason Man remains locked in space and crucified to his body of relativity. His scientific consciousness tells him that he is the only life force in the Tree of Life, which is the galaxy, and that he is god. Hence, he does not have to humble himself to the Higher In - telligence which is there to create in him more godliness. 21 This key tells us that the Torah is the synthesis of all the languages (the perceptual building blocks) of cosmology and as - tronomy that Man must go through lest he falls victim to the wrong vibrations of the fallen Ophanim or mind energies, lest he confuses cosmological distances with the technology of the Earth . . . lest he thinks he has it all within his order of creation. 22 The Torah teaches us not only to hear the language of Light, but to humbly receive and use the language of Light to probe and un - derstand the higher spheres of the heavens and the Shekinah dimen - sions of the Father's garment of which the Earth is a part. 23 Enoch explained that the Sanskrit and Tibetan languages were the vertical alignments of all the biological languages working on 'A - line light vertical movement \" throughout the human body. Ac - cordingly, the pictographic Egyp - tian and Chinese languages were the horizontal alignments of all the biochemical languages working on 'B - line horizontal movement \" throughout the human body. 24 The Hebrew \" Language of Light, \" has been chosen to synthe - size the cosmology of this present cycle of creation. It issues from the seed crystal, the pyramidal third eye, to unify the branches of the Adamic intelligence with the Zohar Races in advanced star evolutions. The Hebrew language of crystal works with all twelve meridians of Light, all twelve Tribes of Israel amongst the stars. 25 And the star messengers, the higher Ophanim, speak directly through the Masters of Light whose vibrations sound in the scrolls of the Torah. Their names activate computer geometries of Light for they are the higher Light spirals which, when coded into human consciousness, allow the energy forces of the human chakras to be unified. 26 The primordial Torah Wedurnah) is the exacting blueprint God followed in the creation of the world. 27 The first five books of the Torah are the Gematria for the five matter - energy bodies that are pre - pared to experience the Merkabah. 28 Within the garden of the Torah the holy Kaballah transforms the numerical seeds of rhythmic cosmology into a table of calcula - tions that can be fitted into the geophysical computer known as the Great Pyramid. 29 Pyramidologists have known that the \" families \" of the House of Israel given in the Book of Num - bers, Chapters 1 and 2, give the angular proportions of the 360' cir - cle of the heavens. KEY 206.30-35 30 Thus, the angular proportions of the circle of the heavens were coded in the \" numerical family blocks \" of the Book of Numbers as: Reuben Simeon Gad Judah Issachar Zebulun Ephraim Manasseh Benjamin Dan Asher Naphtali Tribe Population (Pi) Angle 0 Sin Q 31 The summation of the collec - tive significance of the tribal factors equals 360' which gives the pro - portion of the angle to the indi - vidual number of the integral model. The formula: 360: = Sp Pt is a sign and a sine for the coding and encoding for God's people as they move between the planes of the planispheres. 32 These important tribal pro - portions (1) must be calculated into the Enoch Circle; and (2) into the King's Chamber of the Great Pyramid to show how the core memory of human programming, exemplified in the King's Chamber, connects with a superior circumfer - ence. This circumference represents an astrophysical messiahship which Sp = summation of twelve tnbes is delineated through the Enoch Circle. 33 Under Judah's direction (Scroll of Numbers 2:9) the \" light \" is given as the numerical value of 186,400 - the representation of the physical constant of the \" speed of light \" which is to guide mankind into a new spectrum! 34 Furthermore, Judah is de - fined here as the cosine and is spoken of in the Torah scripture as the spiritual Lion - Sphinx which is the guiding scepter for everything moving towards the mapping of the seed of Israel in the heavens. 35 It is written in Genesis 49: 9 - 10, \" He bowed down, he stretched himself out like a lion [as the Sphinx] and, like a lion, who dares rouse him? The scepter will not turn aside from Judah, neither the commander's staff from be-"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"KEY 206 35 - 45 tween his feet, until Shiloh (Messiah) comes. \" 36 Numerically this chapter stands for the forty - nine stages of consciousness regenesis. And as we go through genesis to regenesis our solar paradigm is moving towards the constellation of Leo. 37 Once again, the true mean - ing of these angular proportions is to show the relationship between the twelve Tribes of Israel and the astrophysical thresholds of the Zodiac; and to show how these thresholds unified and exemplified by the King's Chamber of the Great Pyramid will be opened to a greater cosmology beyond the twelve signs. 38 This will take place when the cosine of Judah is connected with the Chamber of the Son in the Great Pyramid. The Chamber of the Son is located within the Eye of Horus (in the position of the eye socket). The Eye of Horus is formed by the King's Chamber and the Grand Gallery as the upper lid and the Queen's Chamber and the Queen's Chamber Passage creating the lower eye lid around the Chamber of the Son. 39 The Chamber of the Son will open the hidden doors and unlock the final mysteries of the Pyramid. And this connection will mark the time of the coming of the Office of the Christ just as Isaiah has prophesied (Isaiah 19: 19 - 20): 40 \" In that day there will prove to be an altar to YHWH in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to YHWH beside its bound - ary. And it must prove to be for a sign and for a witness to YHWH of armies in the land of Egypt; for they will cry out to YHWH because of the oppressors, and he will send them a savior, even a grand one, who will actually deliver them. \" 4 1 yna am natn ;T;T wnn ors 428 + 56 + 57 + 30 + 17 + 58 n5ni -73~ 33x37 own n~ 46 + 121 + 143 + 380 + 291 w\\ nw7 rrm :mn9 56 + 110 + 437 + 26 + 56 lPJlY-'> D973?2 nH3 nW33 276 + 30 + 380 + 293 + 499 on7 n~ D^W wn mrr-5~ 75 + 354 + 178 + 180 + 26 + 31 :a573m 37 yww 5449 = 181 +208 + 426 42 This is fulfilled in the mathematics of the length of the \" Chamber of the Dead \" to the en - trance of the Great Pyramid which computes to a total of 5449 pyramid inches. This is also the measurement from the base of the Pyramid's exterior to the crown of the Pyramid which is to receive the capstone of the Savior. 43 Thus, the chamber under - neath the Eye of Horus marks the limit beyond which no \" death func - tions exist \" as the evolutionary cycle of man is focused through the Chamber of the Son into the new programs of Adonai 'Tsebayoth. 44 Traditionally, pyramidologists have identified the measurements of the Pyramid with such Biblical events as The Creation, the Fall of Man, The Flood, the Birth of Jesus, his Resurrection, and the Beginning of the Final Days. 45 They have also used the number 365.242 (with a floating decimal) as one of the key numbers for Pyramid calculations. This number is not only the exact number of days in a solar year, but ties into the exact number of days that Enoch lived on Earth according to the Torah. Hence, the entire geometric design of the Great Pyramid is built upon the \" Enoch Circle. \" 46 But until we utilize the lan - guage codes of Moses, Elijah, and Jesus, we will not recognize that all of these language patterns are triangular coordinates of the Higher Mind centering its knowledge within the human force field. Yet, when we are fused with the Christ, we will recognize that infinite intel - ligence goes beyond the conscious - ness of the lower worlds. 47 For this reason, the Torah Or absorbs the fallen galactic realms of consciousness and fuses the mis - directed Light into the Light of God. This enables Man to move from zero point evolution to light technology into star seed creation beyond the negative spiral of the galactic tree of this light zone. 48 And when we work directly with the Higher Evolution, we will understand how the Book of Genesis gives four different cos - mologies of creation. 49 The first is that of the crea - tion of the illuminaries and the ex - panse of the many heavens; the second is the creation of our galaxy in the expanse of our heavens; the third is the creation of our greater luminary, i.e., the creation of our solar system; and the fourth, the cycle of Man upon the planet in the image of the Adam Kadmon who could speak with the Infinite Mind and understand the \" trees of life \" as being the higher Mansion worlds. 50 The Torah also employs the Divine Name thirty - two times in Tit KEY 206 4^-5.5 the creation story at the beginning of Genesis. This represents the thirty - two paths by means of which Hokhmah becomes manifest. 51 Through these thirty - two paths, the soul as the pure germ seed of Nogan and Ahiden (united substance) and Yehidah (highest category of experience) descends to be clothed into the physical body. 52 The Torah speaks of this uni - fication of the thirty - two chemical building blocks within man which allows him to receive the Lak Boymer (the 33rd degree), the pillar of Light. The Lak Boymer exemp - lifies the initiation with the twenty - two letters of the Divine signature in the mathematical con - struction of Exodus 33:22, \" And it has to occur that while my Glory is passing by I must place you in a hole in a rock, and I must put my palm over you as a screen until I have passed by. \" 53 Here the screen of Light is given to Moses so that he can stand before God's Presence and transcribe the letters of the Divine Language. This same force also al - lows Moses' skin to send forth beams of light (Exodus 34:30). 54 Moreover, Jesus, as the Shiur Komah, removes these phys - ical garments by manifesting the Christ. The Jesus includes all of the best functions and attributes that must be offered up to the Christ during the thirty - third con of Am Soph brilliance. 55 Jesus demonstrates how the thirty - two basic chemical building blocks used in the shaping of the physical body can be properly synthesized into the Light of the Adam Kadmon in his thirty - third year."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"KEY 206 56 - 63 56 Therefore, the Christ enables all biological constants to go beyond the lower twenty - two as - trophysical thresholds of Revelation into the perfect garment of God. 57 The keys to the mathematical language of the Torah can also be seen in numerous other events which augment the spiritual body. For example, the day of the first fruits (Numbers 28:26) is a Hebrew festival celebrated fifty days after Passover. And just as this \" Festival of Pentecost \" marks the harvest of the first fruits in the Old Testa - ment, so also the \" speaking in tongues \" (Acts 2) occurred during this festival showing the first fruits of the Holy Spirit given to activate the bodies of Light. 58 This is how the memory network of consciousness regenesis patterns its sequence of memory transformation into the next order of evolution which is beyond \" words \" of old worlds - for it is written in the language of Light. 59 The Torah speaks to the true Priests of Light who listened to the same creative Word sent forth at the beginning of time. And as con - temporary witnesses of the Light, our memory patterns and projec - tions are now being gathered and made anew. Therefore, we declare our ministry in the true Name of YHWH as loyal and dedicated Sons of God. 60 The Torah, when properly used with the Name of God be - comes the Language of Shah which activates a consciousness re - turn to the higher planes of aware - ness. The Torah is the spiritual- scientific language of the Luminaries through which we are opened to speak and be of one mind with the Sons of God. 61 And through the increasing brilliance of the Divine letters, the highest substance of Light neu - tralizes the faculty of the intellect so as to make it incapable of com - prehending anything else in its presence so that its glory might be beheld. 62 In the hour of Graduation our body will be as the Torah scroll, charged with Light and delivered as a gift to the Mansion Worlds of Kaballah. 63 Through Kaballah the man - ifestation of activities and the func - tions of the faculties reserved for the Ascended Masters are passed on to the Saints of Light who have overcome darkness with the power of God's Word, as Hosa1111ah is united with the unspeakable splen - dor of Yesh Me 'aym - God as He really is - utterly beyond com - prehension. 4' d4~Ãˆ ',*Â¥Ã fThe keys tofuture $64 I4 i 6, Â '( 4 !6 ~!46,~'4 6' IÃ *<Â¥! $66 46 codessf the limwwt?~, In these Scrytures $66'6 '*\"f Ãˆ'ÃˆÃ‡Ã Ãˆ* Ãˆ'!, t'*** '!,!I* every letter causes illumination of theDivine 'Ã‡.'~Ã Â¥'\" Ã I\"Ã c-SÂ¥Â¥Â¥ Ã <' a universe witfvn another universes qht, II 1, 'I' d\"',' 6, 4 \"$* ** 4 ,,Ãˆ'!< e abgnment with the creative bepth'lamq 4.''

They come to bring the teachings directly from the Throne of YHWH. 5 They use the language of the Throne, the \" Linguistics of the Liv - ing Light, \" to harmonize the evolu - tions of the first six days or eons of creation into the Image of the Father. 6 The teachings of Light are sent down from the higher worlds to the lower planetary creations in the higher Language of Light which communicates through pul - sating geometries of Light or ideographic cybernetics. These teach - ings of wisdom are given to allow Man to have communion with other planets of intelligence. 7 The essence of these teachings was given in the past, before the 'corruption of Man. \" However, with the corruption of Man by the fallen brotherhoods, Man was taught through false teachings how to use this Language of Light for space and planetary warfare. 8 Through the use of these fal - len teachings a new specie was"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"KEY 207 8 - 20 created to do the work and chores of the planet. This specie was part - human and part - animal. 9 The fallen Adamic humanity desired to give this sub - specie crea - tion a form of godliness, and to give them access to higher evolutionary teachings. This was beyond their spiritual and genetic capacity to understand and there - fore would have resulted in the complete destruction of the planet. 10 Thus, the Councils of the Lords of Light had to intervene to prevent the corrupted specie from endangering and interbreeding with intelligence on this planet or other planetary environments through space migration. 11 To prevent this from occur - ring, the Councils of the Lords of Light decided to deliberately con - fuse the languages of the earth's races so that man would no longer have access to the higher records, nor the ability to build a space needle to communicate with the gods. 12 Only when Man is able to be the Christ Light once again, will he be able to use the Language of Light and be co - participant in the higher worlds of Light. 13 He will then acquire the Language the Sons of Light use and which the first members of the Adamic Race had when they origi - nally came to the planet. And this is the reason why Enoch is speak - ing to the human community at this time; for the human mind is to be prepared to enjoy the dimen - sions of communication that were originally present for the prophets and priest - scientists who walked upon the earth. 14 Enoch told me the Language of the Throne works as instant communication with the Infinite Mind using ideographic and picto - graphic cybernetics. This is a lan - guage of Light symbols which works with more than two - dimensional forms of graphic lan - guage, 15 The fire letter calligraphy of the Language of Light alters the memory sub - strate of Language af - fecting the psychological, neurolog - ical, biochemical and cosmological levels of thought - attunement. 16 The knowledge of this Lan - guage comes from a core memory of information being shared by the Higher Evolution. 17 The core memory, in turn, is controlled by a Mid - Way Council, and is used to produce holistic thought - forms that are applicable to all of the planetary societies being served by a Mid - Way station. 18 This allows for individuals of a given planetary society who are 'contacted \" to connect with the many communities of intelligence under the direction of a Mid - Way station. 19 With these pictographs and ideographs, the Lords of Light can fuse the scenario abstracts of vast consciousness orders. This enables the Lords of Light to reach many planetary worlds and reality levels simultaneously, and fuse the differ - ent languages into the same scenario abstracts. 20 The Language of Light that is used by the Mid - Way Council helps organize and reorganize the responses of the neural mech - anisms in the physical races.

The Light geometry changes the brain's perceptual ap - paratus, as well as the feeling cen - ters of the body. 26 This process (of reception) is begun by the projection of a brightly colored \"Yod\" form of Light upon the face of the subject so as to trigger the necessary chem - ical combinations which activate the mind to receive the ideographs of communication. 27 The projected language in - struction is maintained both within the geometric center of the pro - jected field and the receptive field simultaneously. 28 When the mind is activated, the brain can receive new ideo- KEY 207 21 - 33 graphic (i. e., \" living \" holographic forms,) and cybernetic geometries of Light constituted by several sets of signals which are made fully comprehensible. 29 These signals are sent through serial sequences of rapid flashes. Yet, the original waveform is not changed; it is seeded into the mind of Man and is not affected by the retinal image. Hence, it retains its original pattern and color. 30 Just as the lower galactic in - telligence can communicate with the various planetary realms of in - telligence through thought - words heard within your mind though not received through audible sound, so also the Lords of Light communi - cate through pictographs and ideographs fully experienced within your mind yet not subject to any retinal image. 31 However, this is so complex that the letters of the Living Light must first be seeded into the sub - conscious during sleep. This is to prepare the spiritual inner - vehicles to unify all of the unassimilable geometries of the dark subcon - scious into a divine letter. This di - vine letter can hold the attention of the soul while it is sleeping and carefully school the soul to recog - nize the differences between the divine letters and the archetypal patterns of the subconscious. 32 When the soul has been prepared to recognize several of the divine letters, then education of the soul can begin in the creative states of consciousness. 33 There the soul vehicle begins to experience the manifestations of Light projections and geometries which appear as singular manifesta - tions of Light before they are con-"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"KEY 207 33 - 44 verted into \" picturegrams \" and a series of \" picturegrams. \" 34 Through these geometries the soul recognizes it has a coun - terpart known as the Overself which can communicate with it. And when the soul is sufficiently acclimated to the pictures of Light, the Overself as instructor shows the soul that it has many spiritual vehicles working with a divine scripture which is the food for the spiritual vehicles. 35 When the subsconscious can be unified through a basic alphabet of picturegrams, life is revealed to proceed according to image pro - grams of these \" fiery scriptures/' These are seeded from one heaven into another allowing the physical intelligence to experience other worlds of reality. 36 These ideographs and pic - tographs of otherworld geometries fuse color and mathematical index - es, which respatializes the con - sciousness of Man to participate in multiple time cells of information. 37 Therefore, human thoughts can achieve synchrosimilarity in other time zones of consciousness by stabilized conformations through the Language of Light. 38 This divine Language is also the inductive linkage to the still 'small voice \" within the body which advises you on real day-to- day decisions in the world so that your consciousness will not err in executing the Father's Will. 39 This is the Language of Light used by all of the hierarchical members; this is their Holy Word used to speak in the Father's Pres - ence, to speak directly with the Father no matter what embodiment the soul has put on, to serve even in the distant worlds that are woven out of the Letters of Light. 40 The physical vehicle is necessary to manifest the Divine letters on the three - dimensional plane. 41 Therefore, we must see how the physical universe was shaped out of the divine fire letters. AC- cordingly, if the letters can still shape the light vibratory structure of your body on a small scale, you can imagine how the divine Lan - guage can quicken your body of life to an even greater scale of crea - tion where human language will be replaced by the Language of Light pictures. 42 Human sub - languages are created by grouping visual fields of basic vowels and consonants. Man does not understand that during these early stages of evolution, his vowel patterns are drawn from a \" trapped consciousness environ - ment \" controlled by the wave ratios of his biomagnetic and gravi - tational planetary environment. 43 Man will change his \" lan - guage system \" when he begins to change his wave ratios. This is why the Hebrew letters are eternally written in color geometries expres - sing multiple language channels, so that the entirety of the Scripture can eternally participate in other chemical pathways of creation. 44 Thus, as the soul evolves from the earth's evolution through the many spatial dimensions, it changes its language from the vib - rations of sound to the Language of Light operating on a higher fre - quency of Light. And this key is fulfilled when Man is given the language of instruction necessary to take him through .Alpha and Omega from the Seventh Ray of Light Creation into the Eighth Ray, the opening of the gates of the New Heavens.

In this greater uni - verse there is a field of Master Control energy which the Elohim use to set the Light vibrations which form the dye patterns to create life from the Eternal Eye. By modulating the dye patterns through the Eye, they instantly create physical bodies in accord with the vibrations of Light. This is why the Eternal Eye of Horus is put symbolically upon the Light pyramids for it represents how the Eternal Eye is used to form the edge detectors and the sense detec - tors within the whole memory code structure of the brain. 3 Man, as the highest point on the level of mammalian evolution, is now being repatterned to go beyond the evolutionary break - down into a new arrangement of his chromosomal patterns in order that he may function as a mul- timammalian Light force. 4 This new race will be created in accord with the Elohim and the Lords of Light to give Man the abil-"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"KEY 208 4 - 13 ity to participate in many matter - energy bodies at the same time; Man will thus exist as a fleet being. 5 In this same manner, the Elohim function as a superior spiritual intelligence behind multi- star Councils of Light and inter- galatic Mid - Way Councils. They de - termine whether or not the Light force of evolution should be speeded up or slowed down by an additional language network. 6 New language of a whole Light vibratory structure is given to Man as an outer garment in the same way he generates skin layers, each having cells which communi - cate, each having cells with mem - ory sensitivity factors of the skin layers that have to be constantly kept alive for various stages of work. The controls of conscious - ness cells, in turn, control the layers of energy put around the body which allow for multiple bodies. 7 Man can, then, function as a host to the Elohim when he em - bodies many different galactic vehi - cles rather than just one higher self; 'One' expanding Light Body will be centered within 'Many' in - carnation channels. 8 At the present stage of evolu - tion, man's physical body can only occupy one consciousness time cell. However, man through his five bodies has the potential to evolve mental affinity and proclaim the verisimilitude for his galactic Elohim, as part of the Universal Mind. 9 This verisimilitude can be achieved once the light energy of the five bodies has been aligned to the Overself Body by way of a Lay-00-esh pillar of Light which, in turn, must be aligned with the coherent field of the Living Christ Body so that the Overself is free from the Solar Logos. When the Overself is attached to the higher Christ mantle of Light, the eighth and ninth chakra field of the Christ Light permits the Christed Overself to function in as many as nine di - mensions in our local universe as a super - specie creation. 10 Enoch told me, \" Come, let us make Man in our image. \" I was taken into a galactic council and the galactic spectrum where new star systems were being evolved. 11 Enoch showed me how Light beings of much greater proportion than the human bodies of Earth are created. 12 And I saw a special room with faces for spirit embodiment within form. The room had dyes for the eyes of hierarchical mem - bers which were shaped like the Eye of Horus. Each eye could create a certain matter - energy body needed for some scale of material form, and when the appropriate eye is selected, it is given a conic section impregnating a body - form out of the cells. The 'conic section impregnation of cells' is set by the Light codes which are grouped to - gether. And I saw how an entity of Light embodies a newborn adult body of pure energy before it is in - carnated into the flesh. That entity of Light is then embodied through the Eye of Horus and sent on a consciousness wavelength of Light into a given star planet to create, educate, or reprogram evolving worlds of intelligence. 13 The Council of the Lords of Light take A - line, B - line, and G - line controls of Light and put them together to evolve a physical form. They form an asexual being which the scriptures of the Torah Or refer to when they speak of Cherubim spirit bodies capable of taking on a sexual form directly by Divine impregnation without a physical seed. And these con - sciousness specie identities, regard - less of the chemical shape of the ear or the color of the eye, reflect the face of the Lord of Light or the Adam Kadmon which the matter - energy body inherits from the B'nai Elohim. 14 When the entity arrives on the star planet it begins the evolvement of its physical body that either conforms to its con - sciousness form in the image of goodness or violates the Overself program by adapting to retrogres - sive evolutionary forms that are not spiritually aligned with its original consciousness Light grids. 15 The higher Lords showed this to me in great detail. And with truly great awe and thanksgiving I said, \" Truly YHWH is the gracious Life Force which sustaineth all of His creations through the wise Ser - vants of Creation. \" 16 With these servants I pro - claimed the salutation, \" Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish, Adonai 'Tsebayoth! \" - Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord God of Hosts! For I understood how He governs many Thrones and Dominions, many species and many pastures and fields of Light. 17 The 'Higher Race' of Light substance serving the Father, is continually sent out to create and recreate the Light in all time - cells within the myriad universes, for in the greater program there is no be- KEY 208 13 - 24 ginning or end. 18 In the lesser dust world kingdoms of flesh there are points , of comparative growth and com - parative death, but all of these are brought back to the original blue - print of the Overself creation through 'super - spectrum align - ments' through a super - spectrum species called the Zohar. They are beings of Light who are the incar - nation of the B'nai Elohim having the ability to send down their mind - body into time programs so as to put on many physical bodies to manage and direct the wise programs of their Instructor, the Elohim Council of Light. 19 Thus, they incarnate into many time cells to govern the na - ture and destiny of a life plasma. 20 They can project their minds into the bodies or into the chemical plasma of sub - specie life habitation to perform the physical operations of the super - spectrum Light con - sciousness. 21 The sub - specie evolutions are the finger cells and toe cells of the galactic Adam Kadmon. 22 As the Lords of Light extend their Light consciousness through many fields of time, into many bodies of creation, they show themselves as embodiments of the Hierarchical Mind of the galactic Overself in different time bodies. 23 The Councils of Light gener - ally have a given thought - form for the creation of specie intelligence in the lower worlds. This thought- form is dispatched through a bio- magnetic grid which determines whether the thought - form will be - come animal, human, Seraph- computer, or spiritual Man, etc. 24 All super - spectrum intelli-"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"KEY 208 2 - 1 - 33 gences exist in a multitude of time cell creations, for they are geornet- ries of Light without singular being, capable of projecting them - selves into many time cell crea - tions. All are synchronized together as the larger Throne Energy of Central Control, the Greater Mind of the many galactic commands which sends out thought - forms to be materialized into brain cells, time cells, and wheels within wheels in the name of the Trikaya - \"Father, Son, Shekinah \" unity of Life governing the many galactic hierarchies. 25 All that take on form, in terms of consciousness energy crea - tion, give form to the whole planetary substance. 26 One body - set out of the whole galactic substance takes on form as sub - specie embodiments. 27 One mind - set is formed out of the local universe and exists as many basic biotransducer mind embodiments. 28 The consciousness bodies of the Lords of Light project pyrami - dal patterns of consciousness crea - tion which unify the many uni - verses with new specie experi - ments. The physical race thus serves as a temporal adjustment mechanism for the greater biologi - cal shell which supports a cosmic pyramid providing tests for myriads of cellular realms of con - sciousness. 29 The Eternal YHWH emanates languages of Light from Metatron which materialize into form. As Light language materializes into being, Light wisdom materializes into consciousness vibrations. Thus, the Eternal emanates into the Finite and becomes EHYEH ASHER EHYEH, I AM THAT I AM. 30 The universal membrane di - recting all star membranes allows functioning on different levels of life ionization to occur in obedience to the set function of the biological kingdoms. 31 Moreover, Man's soul goes on to whatever plane it gener - ates beyond the sphere of Alpha - Omega. Through the teach - ings of the Brotherhoods, the set function of the right hand of the Elohim Lords allows Man to be - come the B'nai Elohim by learning the right techniques for true align - ment of his many vehicles within his spiritual soul. The spiritual soul that does superlative work for the Father is allowed to embrace hierarchical forms within multi - dimensional Light experiences. Earthman will soon discover that he is not a unique independent creation, but one of many forms of intelligence fashioned out of multi - dimensional Light. 32 Through the study of the re - vealed codes of Light, the inner planes of our being acquire addi - tional dimensions which are neces - sary to go beyond the material three - dimensional world in which we live. They are connected to the total cycle of soul evolution and for this reason they operate as the guidance force to take Man's con - sciousness creation beyond the physical electromagnetic null zone which is a result of a physical vio - lation and desolation of the planet - ary life forces remaining on the edge of galactic spheres in local universes. 33 Through the codes of Light we see how enlightenment is the mapping for organic evolution and the will of the cosmic intelligence. It is the realized Kaballah of Being known as the Adam Kadmon, and it is the realized Merkabah of Being known as EHYEH ASHER EHYEH, rpm iVN ;rrw which connects our life intelligence with the many living universes. 34 The Lords of Light will help us understand the consciousness cosmology of the higher thinking intelligence when the degenerate range of ego affinity has been dis - placed with the higher endow - ments of Light and Love. 35 This is the reprogramming of KEY 208 33 - 36 life coded in the language of stars and this is the reprogramming of ascending life energies from the physical worlds of the lower heavens spoken of in the illustrious scrolls of all the Ascended Masters who speak of the Father's World of Many Mansions. 36 Yield yourselves up to the Father and become united with the Brotherhoods in acquiring wisdom from the secret works of the Spirit of Truth and become like free brethren in spirit, that you may be like unto the Elohim Lords of Light and not like slaves and partners of the physical substance of this pas - sing Mansion world."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Sit *t S%*^ u\\Ã‘wsa~futur !$*,< 4 Ã‡ i' history aregivi ik 6' t n tÃ i!** 4 ti i the cmrgies wlwh I ^'t *.S*St Ã it ii i revealed the Vwme St ^Ã 464 Ãˆt 666 i ^* 6 Hi $4 '+'i for theyarethesame,TheManyamithe $6 < $66 t \"Ã i '6 om. *F&~Â¥ADA KKDMO~~' The $4 iu fia it i ,/Ã <*Ã Â¥ Ã $Ãˆou$ Image tfofffwn, Isalso theLastADAM"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"THE KEYS TO FUTURE HISTORY ARE GIVEN IN THE ENER - GIES WHICH REVEALED THE DIVINE WORD AT THE BEGIN - NING OF TIME, AND IN THE ENERGIES WHICH WIFE REVEAL THE \" HIDDEN DIVINE WORD \" AT THE END OF CONSCIOUS - NESS TIME.

In the creation of the thrones and dominions of intelligent genesis and regenesis, the first body of Light consciousness which was used to create the program of star seed materialization is also the same type of Light body used to call forth a new life program at the end of the karmic cycle. 3 Enoch spoke of the Corinthian correspondence in the \" Light Tes - tament \" of I Corinthians 15: 40 - 41 where it says: \" And there are heavenly bodies (plural - realms of the Adam Kadmon), and earthly bodies (plural - realms of the Adam); but the glory of the heavenly bodies is one sort, and that of the earthly bodies is a dif - ferent sort. The glory of the sun is one sort, and the glory of the moon is another, and the glory of the stars (manifested regions of the Zoharim Races) is another; in fact star differs from star in glory. \" 4 The text of I Corinthians goes on to say something quite remark - able and identifies itself as a key of Kaballah to the fourth power fulfil - ling this eternal key of Enoch when it says in 15: 42 - 45: \" So also is the resurrection (the reprogramming) of the dead.

It is sown in weakness, it is raised up in power. 6 \" It is sown a physical body, it is raised up a spiritual body (the Light form). If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual one. (There cannot be a materialization without the energy frequencies which allow for materialization.)"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"KEY 20q 7 - 13 7 \" It is even so written: 'The first man Adam became a living soul.' The last Adam became a life - giving spirit. \" 8 In other words, the first man Adam was the synthesis of the preexistent genetic and astrophysi - cal river of life which formed the double helix upon the earth. And once the man Adam, upon this planet, can reach a level of evolu - tion whereby he can transform his matter - energy body to leave, he will be able to give life unto the same form or bequeath conscious direction to other life kingdoms in the process of evolution. Enoch ex - plained to me that if the servant of Light were lifted off this planet and taken to other planets of specie in - telligence, he would use love in the same divine manner, no matter what chemical differences existed with the new specie. He would continually serve the Father, for his higher body of Light will continue to love all fellowmen with the ful- ness of the image and similitude of the divine self, the Adam Kadmon within every child of God. For this planet is a biochemical testing zone for the House of Many Mansions which creates new images through the higher vehicle of the Adam Kadmon. 9 The weights and measures of the Kingdom of God were given to the first creations of the Adamic Race of the Lords of Light who came and gave Man the qualifica - tion to build the Kingdom of God for the planetary spheres in the name of the B'nai Elohim. The weights and measures that were given to this planetary sphere re - ceived, however, a corrupted spatialization of Light from the fal - len dwellers who were cast into the outer regions of space. And now, at the beginning of this new cycle, this planet is to be given a new wavelength and a new mind body of crystal to interconnect with other life stations and to share the life giving spirit with other creations in the name of the B'nai Elohim and the Lords of Light. 10 The Scripture of Light con - tinues in 15:46: \" Nevertheless, the first is, not that which is spiritual, but that which is physical, after - ward that which is spiritual. \" 11 During the Alpha cycle of creation, Adamic Man as the fallen Light body incarnation is seen in contrast to Adamic Man at the end of the Omega cycle. We see the first Adamic Man being made by the life processes of YHWH, di - rectly through star creation in the higher heavens. In the process of extending this creation to new re - gions of the heavens, the Adamic creation was intercepted by the fal - len Watchers and transposed into imperfect physical - light. 12 Now at the end of this cycle we are seeing the second Adamic Man being made through the visi - tation of the Lords of Light or the Higher Intelligence which repro - grams him because he has lost his conceptual apparatus of telethought communication. Since he has lost the ability to reconcile multi - dimensional levels of consciousness programming, the Elohim factor takes over and programs the survi - val mechanisms in the second Adamic Man's identity patterns so that he can go back into the Light form of the Adam Kadmon. 13 I Corinthians 15: 47 - 49 con - tinues: \" The first man .is out of the earth and made of dust; the second man is out of heaven. 14 \" As the one made of dust is, so those made of dust are also; and as the heavenly one is, so those who are heavenly are also. 15 \" And just as we have borne the image of one made of dust, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly one. \" 16 We must understand that in this key of Zohar, and in this key from Enoch, the planetary Adamic Race upon this dust world creation was evolved out of a fallen magnet - ic blueprint of intelligence transfer - red to this sphere by the fallen Watchers who intercepted one manifestation of the many divine Adam Kadmon creations. The Adamic society which has fallen from Light must be measured in terms of the worlds that preceded this world and the world that will be restored so that the Adamic Light force can shine as the bright - ness of the many heavens and par - ticipate in the many star evolu - tions, the star wisdom which was originally intended for Man. And when Man can return to the image and similitude of the original Adam that the Elohim created, known in the Zohar as the Adam Kadmon, then, Man can once again go from this star body of material form lo - cated in Population I Life Systems into Population I1 Life Systems which form the collective intelli - gence in the center of our local uni - verse - the Central Control of our galactic River of Life. 17 And as we realize this, we can understand the cosmological drama between the Lords of Light and the fallen mind energies who have left the higher Light energies KEY 20') 13-1'1 to serve Lucifurian light forces out of focus. In order to understand the freedom of the spirit working with the Hierarchy of the Father, it is necessary for Man to understand how any dimension of Light, as well as any Prince of Light may go forth from the Throne of the Father to create life and light in his own glory rather than the collective Lordship of the universe. 18 For this reason of glorifying our universe in the image of the Universal Light of the Father, the Office of the Christ was established to overcome the creations of the 'Ur' which fell out of the Father's Grace through a glorious Prince of Light who took the Father's Love and created his own throne and dominion in the image of himself - Lucifur - the Ur which sought honor and dominion first, and love second. Thus the order of Lucifurian creation extended itself to the regions of the outer uni - verses through emissaries of light and Ur vehicles of destruction to serve the fallen light - Lucifur. 19 When the cycle of creation goes forward, the Adamic con - sciousness which has been purified can be generated into new bodies of Light. Those bodies of Light then go on and are able to take on new physical form and either enter spaces of the corruption of dying universes to teach physicals to transform death or enter new or - ganic forms of heavenly prin - cipalities. The energies of the Adam Kadmon, in fact, continue as the wellspring of creation with the same type of thought pattern which works as effectively on the higher dimensions of cosmological being as it does on this side of rel-"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"kEY 20') 1') 28 ativity. This is because the body of consciousness on this side is inter - connected with the Body of the Christos on the other. 20 The ancient scriptures of Zohar refer to the word Mashiali - Christos' as the redemptive Body of Light working with the outer universe which can come in, create a membrane, and take that life back into higher levels of star crea - tion to be called the Adam Kad- mon, the Body of Light reigning within the Kingdoms of the Father. 21 The Adam Kadmon can then step in and out of the time cell, take his life form which is part of a universal program and adjust the chemistry of his cells to fit the liv - ing parts, quickening organic life while still within the transfiguration of Zohar. 22 However, it is very difficult for man in the lower worlds to rec - ognize the fallen entities which ap - pear as the Light. Therefore, no one is to ascend to other worlds by instruction from any entity unless he receives the revealed vibration of the Father's Name and unless he is commissioned to work with man, woman, and child as the holy trin - ity in fulfilling all of the gifts be - longing to the Holy Spirit, for Jesus warns us that \" false Christs will arise. \" 23 With this awareness of uni - versal life, this key of Enoch ex - tends also to the various programs of other galaxies where the Lords of Light self - embody themselves on the planetary plane and transfigure the flesh of those who serve the Father and their fellow creation. As you are a biochemical frequency constantly changing, you have within the ability to measure the biorhythms of change and to un - derstand the need for greater har - monies which free the biorhythms from physical limitation, transmut - ing them into Bodies of Light. 24 As you go into your Adam Kadmon cosmology of the higher galactic centers of creation, you leave behind the linearity of fallen Adamic mutations and inherit di - mensions of intelligence where your Adamic seed can unite with the original Adamic creation of the Father. 25 As Priests of Light we are required to offer up a whole conic section of Light unto a whole conic section of Light through which our transfiguration will be regenerated. Thus, our I AM pyramid of seven - fold brightness is offered unto the I AM pyramid of 144,000 Masters which is the making of EHYEH ASHER EHYEH, I AM THAT I AM, !Ti%! ltt\\S vm. 26 The Black Cube geometries of destruction must not be offered up as our consolation, for verily, it would be our desolation. The righteous must clearly see the spiritual dialectic taking place be - tween those who choose the Pyramid of Light as the touchstone for evolution into the higher spiral of Light as opposed to those who choose the Black Cube which con - tains the codes for containment of the flesh, retrogressive evolution within three - dimensional form, and the annihilation of the hope for spiritual liberation. 27 These codes were placed in the Black Cube as a witness to the fallen teachings that were removed from the Garden of Eden at the time of the spiritual fall. 28 I beseech you in* the name of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who like all our fathers of consciousness have patiently watched the formation of our Brotherhoods and the creation of our consciousness completion. 29 We are the Living Sons of Light, and as Living Sons of Light we have been programmed and or - dained with our mission of mercy unto the fallen fields of despair. We have been anointed and we have been remembered by the Holy KEY 209 28 - 30 Order of Melchizedek. Let us there - fore be mindful of fulfilling our purpose and we shall inherit the , brightness of the firmament forever and forever. 30 Now, therefore, whoever is worthy, let him receive the mys- I teries 'and enter into the Light of the Adam Kadmon.

They are the scattered remnant of the mind energies of the Adamic society from other [eons of time. 6 This Race was brought to Earth to evolve a higher thinking intelligence and give linkage chan - nels to new orders of evolution. Since that time, the Sons of Light and the Great White Brotherhood have sustained the True Israel throughout all generations of Man. 7 Under the guidance of the Sons of Light, the True Israel brought the Scriptures of Light to the community of Qumran; the True Israel brought the Scriptures of Light to the community of Alex - andria; the True Israel brought the"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"KEY 210.7-19 Scriptures of Light to the Takla Makan Basin of Tibet; the True Is - rael brought the Scriptures of Light to the community of Nag Ham- madi; and the True Israel brought the Scriptures of Light to the Great Salt Lake. 8 It is they who are receptacles for the Flame of YHWH; the recip - ients for the consciousness architec - ture of the world. They are the in - dwelling consciousness communica - tion channels for YHWH, who is the Mind of Universal Intelligence governing our Father universe. 9 Wherever the people of the greater Light vibration have used their vibration to serve the Higher Mind and to revere the Living universe, they have kept accurate records and testimonies of where the higher universe would inter - connect with lower evolutionary orders of creation. 10 In these documents of Light, the \" true Torah Or \" upon our planet, we find the message of the \" True Israel. \" 11 And with these linkage channels to the Higher Evolution, Man has been directly kept alive throughout the cycles of mortality, so that the consciousness patterns which leave the physical form can be remade into the Light to become Sons of Light and active co- participants with the Great White Brotherhood. 12 The key of Enoch tells us, \" Whosoever will carry the Flame of YHWH \" - the Universal Intelli - gence - \" will live in a field of Glory and of Light. \" And they will be a people within a \"people with 'Energies of Great Rushing' uprais - ing themselves to the 'Sons of Light' and the Great White Brotherhood. \" 13 This tenth key equates the True Israel with the ability to trans - cend the light as the people of the Yod spectrum. This transcendence al - lows them to illuminate the world by being the focus of a Light chan - nel which gives forth teachings of Light directly connected with the Sons of Light and the Great White Brotherhood. 14 They brought this wisdom into a world where consciousness is conventionalized with multifari - ous, accidental, and purposeless collisions of events whose suddenly formed combinations create hap - penstance relativity. 15 The Yod spectrum constitutes the ten 'radiation centers of soul growth' personified by the \" lost ten tribes of Israel \" - the lost spec - trum of Light. 16 This Yod spectrum is the lost coding used to connect our life sta - tion with the original program of the Father (which is even beyond the programs begun by the sub- creators to salvage portions of the Adamic Race). 17 When the Yod spectrum, as the collective ten lost radiations of the Divine Light, is synthesized with trinitized matter and energy (which is beyond the biopolar bal - ances of the planet), the dualism of science and religion is overthrown; 18 then, we can fully use all twelve channels of Light to inter - connect with vast life systems al - ready working within our life sys - tem. 19 Unfortunately, non - spiritual man works in the common light and is caught within his own dual - ity and cannot go beyond his own picture of \" the Israel of flesh \" into the Israel of Light. 20 However, once he can go beyond the geophysical parameter that separates him from the True Israel, he can begin to raise himself to the level of the Sons of Light and the Great White Brotherhood. 21 The term \" Sons of Light, \" - Biizai Or, appears in both the an - cient and newly revealed scriptures of Israel. These scrolls refer to the Zohar regions of Ea - Sirius, Sabik, Kesil, and Kimah from where the Sons of Light come down to in - struct us as to the mysteries of the evolving universe. 22 They are defined as the spiritual intelligence who explained the dialectic between the children of Light and the children of dark - ness. 23 The Great White Brotherhood is a federation of seventy higher evolutionary Adamic Brotherhoods. They use physical forms of life to supervise and survey the lower planetary worlds. However, the Great White Brotherhood is subject to the programs of \" wisdom \" com - ing from a higher level of intelli - gence known as the B'nai Or, the \" Sons of Light. \" 24 The B'nai Or is composed of angelic entities working as hierar - chical angelic Brotherhoods under the Orders of the Elohim. In their work the B'nai Or intelligence can work with both spiritual and physi - cal embodiment. This is necessary to connect the activities of the races of the Zohar with the Orders of the Elohim. Thus, through the B'nai Or, members of the Zohar races are selected for advancement into the work of the Great White Brother - hood, or the B'nai Or, and in some cases, for work with the Orders of the Elohim who choose their new KEY 210 20 - 28 members from the ranks of the B'nai Or. 25 In the larger coordination of spiritual teachings, those Orders under the direction of the Orders of the Elohim are e.g., the Order of Michael, the Order of Enoch, the Order of Melchizedek, the Order of Gabriel, the Order of John . . . each having their own hierarchy which administers to the selective ministries of both the B'nai Or and the Great White Brotherhood. These administration hierarchies form a unity of commands that work with both the angelic and Adamic Brotherhoods on the high - est levels of spiritual leadership. (Included in these Lord adminis - trators are Heru - Ur, Theoti, Amen - Ptah, Enoch - One Who In - itiates into Light, etc.) 26 Many of these Lords of Light came down and directly instructed Man in (eons before the present in - tellectual history. This is why the ancient historians spoke of beings that were part - Man, part - God; be - ings who were capable of using this planet as a garden for their testing zone of creation. They also implanted themselves to upgrade our field of genetic intelligence and remap the root races with higher thought - form frequencies of crea - tion. 27 As the universes come closer together, Man discovers that he goes through the same astrophysi - cal parameters again and again until he discovers how to go beyond the consciousness pararnet- ers which lock him into continuous cycles of rebirth. 28 Therefore, the scriptures of science and the scriptures of con - sciousness of the ancient Near East"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"KEY 210 28 - 41 and Far East are continually relived until Man lives through his myth and adequately uses the spiritual truths to unlock the consciousness dimensions which separate him from his galactic brothers. 29 He will continually live with the bioconsciousness of the old planetary cycles until new scientific keys can open within him a desire to take a great leap forward and, through a mutual programming with the Brothers of Light, become co - citizen in the galactic community of Light. 30 We must see within the as - sembly of all universal religions and organized sciences that we are the people who have the ability to stand beyond conventional time- space in awe of the universe. 31 We operate as the \" True Is - rael \" - the true People of Light, when we have the raising of the consciousness of all humanity as our primary goal within the Father's Plan. 32 The People of Light are the vessels of Light in which the galac - tic intelligence programs itself into every biochemical unit in the human body. The People of Light are the living mandala of Light which all the great religions and world philosophies depend on; they are the \" Zohar Race \" who educate the specie to go beyond the consciousness of death with freedom of the spirit to fulfill the Father's Program of Eternal Life. 33 The People of Light are the materializations of higher evolutionary thought - forms which give greater counsel and direction to the great creative purge of materialism. They are the True Is - rael that prepares the people of God to go into one higher manifes - tation of YHWH, into the higher evolutionary programs of creation. 34 They are a people within a people who are in full communica - tion with the Brotherhoods of Light by the Energies of the Eternal Flame which can be seen bearing testimony over their heads. 35 The Sufi documents refer to the people of Israel as the \" People a111 al-Dhimmah,\" the People of the Covenant of Light. 36 This Covenant is a Covenant of the B'nai Or; it is a unity of all Covenants of Light connected to the Covenant of Israel. 37 In this unique expression something different is transmitted. This indicates that God's Covenant is firstly with His messengers, the B'nai Or and the Brotherhoods of Light, then through them, with the People of Light. 38 God transmits the Covenant through His messengers and uses them to solidify all aspects of His work on the earth plane - to ex - tend His programs of salvation and build His kingdom of Light. 39 This Covenant we share calls the world to accept salvation and provides a promise of that final ful - fillment in a godly life of peace and sharing with our heavenly counter - parts. 40 The Sons of Jacob and the Sons of Joseph exist on all planes of consciousness to show the peo - ple of the world how Joseph, as the inner wheel of consciousness Light, purifies those who are called into the outer wheel of evolution - ary worlds, as the Sons of Jacob. 41 This \"wheel-within-the- wheel \" creates within its new Light spiral a new DNA-RNAplasma of human creation which enables the People of Light to move into the next electromagnetic ordering of the life code. 42 Know then, that the Brotherhood of Light has been ap - pointed to speak unto you concern - ing these matters of consciousness liberation. 43 For now is the very time to offer up our souls unto the altars of consciousness transfiguration. 44 The keys to these thresholds of holiness are found within this Book of Enoch which has been re- KEY 210 41 - 46 vealed during this consciousness era for the unlocking and the re - vealing of the wisdom of all ages for all time and forever. 45 Therefore, 0 Brethren of Light, do listen to this entreaty and understand that we have the Day of Resurrection at hand and that we must all be prepared to enter into the arms of our Brothers when they descend in flames and in great rushings of glory to collect us. 46 Be lifted with joy each day and stand in resonance on that Great Day of Graduation."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"I4 Ãˆ61 $4 *Â¥W eThe keys tofuture I!$* '4 Ã I 4 +ÃˆIIÃˆÃˆ 'Wqhts &Measures Hi &ii !Ã 4' \" 4 aregiven in the4Light- \"$6 14!41 4 $ ~tbrittuw0f'\"M 'ÃˆÃ ' - $I ÃˆI,, 44Ã 4Ãˆt~' *Ãˆ!$' ^* Sacral Names which are the weights and Ã Ã‡IÃˆ~Ã 4'411 Ã Ãˆ'>Ãˆ' tÃˆ!

Metalin- guistics, metamathematics, meta - gnosticism all seek out the wisdom of a greater evolving universe and yet all of these metasciences are tautological and hence limited in nature; they are not able to bring the reality of universal energy down into the scientific experience of material realities. They are all working with empirical half - lives. 4 'Meta' is the half - life function of Metatron who is one of the Creator Presences of YHWH, who works with the scientific program - ming going on in our universe. Metatron is the Creator of the 'outer Light \" programs of the ex - ternal universes which were created from formlessness and void. The power of Metatron sets the weights and measures for creation which al - lows for the dawning of the Living Light of YHWH in the regions of darkness so they can eventuate into spiritual domains. 5 Metatron's name appears in connection with Enoch, \" One who Initiates into Light. \" In the ancient scrolls his name also appears with the scriptures of Enoch, where cosmological accounts are given of other life stations of intelligence. There is a story handed down in a hidden mystical scroll of Light which tells us how in the darkness of primordial creation Metatron brought the Father's Plan of crea - tion to the outer worlds by al - phabets of Light.

Now is the time for the weights and measures to return! 8 Even now the scientists of this world cannot understand the cosmology and astronomy of the first Book of Enoch, for it refers to worlds of creation which existed before the temporality of this crea - tion. 9 If we look at the Greek and Coptic writings in Alexandria, the Old Testament scrolls, even the early teachings of Clement of Alex - andria and Origen, and throughout most of the oriental literature, we find revealed references to systems of measurement, systems of vibra - tory control, and systems of Light consciousness projection which the Lords of Light use as they reset and reestablish the continuity of different realms of intelligence in the dust world creations. 10 We have selectively lived off the consciousness energies in the absence of these direct teachings for thousands of years. 11 However, a direct and literal fulfillment of this 'original con - sciousness' will take place with the return of the Higher Intelligence who will come down and re - spatialize this planetary creation as it goes into its next evolutionary link. 12 This book contains the keys to the opening of Metatronic func - tions of creation preparing mankind for the return of the Masters to this plane which is the completion of the half - life function of what has already been prophesied. 13 As we move through the life spectrum, we relive the Book of Enoch, the original scroll explaining how the Elohim are the pillars and towers directing creation. 14 Through the glory of the Elohim the 'Great Announcement' of their creations is brought to the Thrones and Dominions. 15 Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael, Shemuel, Zedekiel, Yophiel, Hofniel, Sabriel, Ulliel, Zeppaniel, and others carry the keys to these new heavens which will be the inheritance of those whom God has chosen. 16 These keys to new heavens are brought forth in a special arch- angelic alphabet of Metatron known historically in Kaballah as ketav eimyim, \" eye writings. \" These writings are composed of small cir - cles and lines shaped like flames.

In the regenesis of life these Sacred Names are the weights and measures that are used by the fam - ily of God on Earth. 19 We are going through the final Omega level of consciousness which has evolved through the mil - lenniums from the Alpha level of creation. This energy was first brought into focus and dispatched to this planet by a small family of Masters who set up a domain in order to restore the fallen planetary consciousness to be in harmony with the Father's universe. 20 This was under the direction of the Adamic Race whose purpose it was to establish a physical family which can transpose angelic func - tions into the flesh. 21 Thus, the people of God act as a branch of God's family in their own local universe. They are able to actually reach out to attune other human biological vessels so that they also can partake of the sacred Light vibrations to change their molecular structure allowing them to follow the energy trace back into other universes and be - come the Adam Kadmon. 22 The promise of ascension and descension is presented to each servant of the Father who is able to experience his conscious - ness being coded directly into the Living Light through the Sacred Names which brought the non- KEY 211 17 - 28 incarnate Christ into the lower forms of creation and bring your incarnate form into the Christ Body of the Adam Kadmon. 23 When you are spiritually prepared to ascend, you add the \" seal \" of your breath by the vibra - tions of the sacred Names to the \" seal \" of the body of creation which you will graduate into and which is continually being built up out of the Names which remake the mold of the Adam Kadmon. 24 When the \" seal \" on your body of consciousness is broken you are finally prepared to add your name to the names of the sa - cred who ascend to the presence of the Throne of God. 25 The angelic commands then descend from the higher universe to receive you into the image of the Adam Kadmon. 26 The Adam Kadmon is the Light Body that has within it all key names of creation giving it the ability to create super - specie cre - ations and divine personalities as energy entities.

THERE IS A COLOR CODE IN EVERYTHING. 1 This key speaks of the bio - logical synthesis of geometries and color codes within the chro - mosomal factors which carry a physical form of consciousness be - tween time zones. 2 This is possible because the chromosomal patterns exist in grids which have unique colors in geometric form existing within every consciousness time zone. Therefore, they are capable of being fused into different Light- time zones by the right cross matching. 3 This key is to prepare the human race for the emergence of a new physical garment so that man can coordinate physical form with the similitude of the Second Adam Kadmon. 4 This will change the con - sciousness of biological limitation to correspond to new chromosomal patterns. 5 Enoch explained to me that when the members of the new Adamic Race (in concert with the Adam Kadmon) are able to place their Light forms within various radiations of color and combine these codes of color with pulsating geometries of Light, their con - sciousness can be instantinualized into another Light - time zone. 6 Their consciousness will no longer be projected back into the old chromosomal patterns of vehi - cle identity. 7 While this process of con - sciousness transfer is taking place through chromosomal receding, some physicists will be shown how to use this unique language of color. 8 This language of color can ex - press volume - space, depth - space, and vibratory - space through cos - mological constants which frame the human and higher evolutionary thought - forms. 9 The reason why vast numbers of humanity have not used the language of color is because Man has basically remained under the power of the fallen illuminaries. 10 He uses functions which are orientated basically within the dual - ity of black and white, therefore, his conceptual ability does not work with other polychromatic vib - rations. 11 He does not understand his genetic ancestry descending from the various genetic embodiments. Some of these genetic embodiments"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"KEY 212 11-23 were descendants of the blue - white Ray which was directly projected to this planet. 12 Over the millenniums, the admixture allowed for gene pool mutation between the root races and the higher races so that the connecting linkages of genetic modeling were lost. 13 In consequence of the earlier genetic disruptions, the Brother - hood of Light is repairing the lost color linkages in the human gene pool. 14 This is being done through the color geometries that form a grid containing color thermo- temporal lines which, in turn, match an area of genetic material to another area of genetic growth. 15 Through this color grid there occurs a crystallization within the genetic materials to a point which attracts the rays of being. This forms a reciprocity of energy with all portions of the body within the color grid. 16 To facilitate this grid the Higher Evolution uses a color at - tachment which scans the genetic area in question with a given number of thermobands simulta - neously. They then give each thermoband a separate and distinct color. Thus, the temperature differ - ences across a surveyed area can be measured by simply counting the color bands. 17 This color attachment is a template of light cells distributing and organizing the genetic material into districts. This process allows for Higher Evolutionary thought- forms to be transferred into localized color codes by modulating the A - line and B - line grid of the template, as well as causing a genetic transfer of Man to take place into higher evolutionary pro - totypes derived from one central similitude. 18 Man will be able to under - stand this transfer principle by em - ploying a light beam with a specific wavelength on a chromosome so that he can see how the chromo - some explodes allowing for it to be rapidly absorbed into the beam for genetic transfer to a new state of matter. 19 When he can coordinate these new scientific domains which will transfer his knowledge from one consciousness zone to another, Man will have the ability to project from life spectrum to light spec - trum and from one life spectrum to other life spectrums. 20 He will be able to take a genetic - matter code, infuse it into a pulse environment of color and form and project it into other mat - ter environments. 21 This will happen in the new cycle when a new biochemical form will emerge out of the human evolution which will freely com - mingle with other biological exper - iments allowing for the biology of human form to be recreated on the other side of light and still have physical form. 22 Man will be able to take the chromosomes of the Light - Life structure on one level of creation and carry a given consciousness code across into another conscious - ness domain by projecting it onto a wavelength of Light. 23 And when this day occurs, the covenant made with Abraham on his ten fingers and on his ten toes will call a new seed into exis - tence and clothe it with a pillar of color and send it to other star envi - ronments in a multitude of forms. 24 Thus, the physical body which is re - energized on the other side of light will be used by those triumphant beings who will receive new instructions and return with their physical vehicle to serve other dust world creations. Others will use their perfected body of Light to evolve into the higher worlds which no longer have need of the physical form, for they will exist in Bodies of Masters of Light. 25 This type of biological em - bodiment is the physics of Meta- tronic energy which is used to cross match the lower genetic forms of life with the higher gene - tic forms of Light through crystal - line Light channels of vibrations. This is done to help evolve intelli - gences in star systems in the lower heavens. Because of the fallen angels, the Father has declared that no planetary society should take upon itself to cross match a specie with another specie, or seed an evolving planet. 26 Therefore, cross matching should only be done by the Lords of Light who are assigned by the Father to remake the subspecies into the Great White Light. This is decreed by the Father's Will so that planetary intelligence does not fol - low in the ways of the fallen angels by creating species with grotesque bodies and war - like minds, who lack the spiritual love of working for their fellow specie and the uni - verses of the Father. 27 Every star evolution is on a valency of Light which determines its own evolutionary program, its own Light - time zone. 28 Time is within the con- KEY 212.23-34 sciousness of the specie, literally within the structure of the chromo - somes. The chromosomes are keyed into the Light - time zone. The Light - time zone is the geometry of the time factor which trips the chromosomes to live and generate. 29 Only when the chromosomes can go past the Light - time zone can they proceed to evolve into a higher body of Light, the body of the Adam Kadmon creation. 30 If an Overself exists the biological restructuring can be allowed to bypass certain chromosomal stages allowing a new physical creation to be directly placed in resonance with its Over- self. This is accomplished through a spiral template grid which is connected with the region of the eighth chakra and used to model new biological states through the Eye of Horus. 31 If this template geometry of genetics is matched to its Overself from which it is so derived, the frequency of Light generated allows a new physical manifestation to house the soul. 32 The Overself works through the template overlap placed over the human biological form (of color) and the Light shells of color which surround the biological form in this frequency of light so that a new manifestation of the Overself takes on flesh. 33 Thus, the black and white pulsations are reversed and the consciousness of the specie is re - turned to the original image and similitude intended for its Race. 34 This is also the cross of Light, the genetic cross of Adamic forms of higher celestial creation"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"KEY 272'34-45 crossing over and taking on a human appearance, as the Adamic Race. 35 Through this cross matching the higher forms of intelligence, even the Hyos Ha Koidesh - the highest Hierarchy of the Councils, are able to come down through the Adamic Race, literally into bodies of chromosomes. 36 The key tells us, \" There is a color code in everything \" ; the low - est forms of matter, as well as the highest forms of matter, are on a valency of Light, a radiation of Light. 37 This radiation of Light carry - ing the color codes forms specter - spectra combinations of matter and muon waves which determine specie intelligence in our Light - Life zone of creation. 38 Therefore, there is a color index that determines the whole radiational pathway unto life in every phase of creation. 39 This is why the Covenant of Light reaches out to all radiations of Light of the human flesh regard - less of racial color. It allows for the coding of all color functions to go into the higher code functions of Light which is the Seventh Ray of the Brotherhood, and from there into the Eighth and Ninth Ray of the angelic beings of Light who serve the Hyos Ha Koidesh. 40 In turn, the Hyos Ha Koidesh shares the White ~ay with those cosmic Brotherhoods who regener - ate the generations of matter into new life. 41 When people are coded into the Seventh Ray of Light, they have the ability to participate in whatever dimension of Light uses that function. Yet, it is necessary to proceed to the Eighth and Ninth Color Rays if they are to complete their soul evolution as an embodi - ment of the Covenant of Light. For only their Zohar Body of Light can carry all nine functions of the Logos - Spermatikoi, the sperm colors in our local universe, to create out of the dust world creations struc - tures of many bodies robed in multi - colored beams of Light. 42 For this reason, the Adamic seed came down on the Seventh Ray, in the seventh Eon of Light (the seventh day), after all the other evolutions had tried to evolve. They came as the seventh threshold Race to repair the func - tions of the fallen evolutions al - ready in process on the Earth. 43 This is the Ray of the Great White Brotherhood; this is the Ray of the Adotzni 'Tsebayoth, the Host which visits on the seventh level of Light. 44 This Seventh Ray is used by the higher Lords of Light to com - bine the mathematical frequencies of color within sound ranges that are not audible to the human ear. These color - sound ranges can move entire octaves of Light measure - ment to function in the new mathematics of twelve tones, twenty - four tones, thirty - six tones, and seventy - two tones; this is the foundation on which Man can re - ceive the music of the spheres. 45 This scale of musical function is a vibration which functions in every vibration of light, in every pitch of music and on every factor of a diminishing chord structure, which draws together the music of the spheres and its corresponding color form, into the right geome - tries not of lines nor of curves but of floating Light grids. 46 The music of the spheres sends Light geometries through space to allow the Higher Evolution to occupy density within density but still remain in a Body of Light. 47 Color and sound are the most important energy structures for the imprint embodiment of the soul form. They are the modeling ground structures which shape the visible and invisible nogniz shells from all preexisting geometries. 48 The Zohar Race uses this Body of Light to come into any sphere of creation and evolve into that light form already present on the planetary star, and if necessary they can evolve the planetary race by recoding its genetic colors into a higher color code through their thought - forms. 49 Therefore, this key to future physics gives us the knowledge of how color codes will allow our specie to literally, genetically retool itself in conjunction with the Brothers of Light. The Brotherhood of Man will have the power to genetically put together, if neces - sary, such faculties as eyes with polychromatic lenses that can filter light current and work with many levels of light enhancement. 50 We are also told in this key that the chromosome factor \" will be opened \" to receive a wave fac - tor of a higher color code. This will iillow it to function simultaneously with many double helixes, in many Light - time zones towards the build - ing of the body of Light which can work directly with multiple physi - cal embodiments of the Overself. 51 Understand in this key the cross matching of the Higher Disci - pleship of the Adonai 'Tsebayotk KEY 212 45 - 58 within the Discipleship of the Lords of Light who come down in the form of the preexistent Adam Kadmon and recreate the Adamic specie form. 52 The physical Adam Kadmon as the Adamic specie then creates the sub - forms of the Shekinah which utilize all the necessary tributaries of color so that every chakra has a color code unified into the Covenant of Light. 53 Our energy conversion has been prepared and focused through a series of interconnecting geomet - ric pyramidal cones of \" color and sound \" to regenerate our specie creation throughout the ceons of time transition. 54 The species of Light have remained intact through these ages because they are the invincible pro - jections of Divine Creation which withstand negative fields of deso - lation and abomination with their love of God and their selfless devo - tion to consciousness growth and evolution. 55 In this way two attaches to one, one attaches to two; Son uni - verses attach to a Father universe, a Father universe attaches to Son universes.

They have violated the spectra of the color codes for they feel that their color is supreme and that their color is the only force of power. 2 Also, there were many forms of three - dimensional intelligence which violated and refused the Word of God and therefore were exposed to solar radiations during the great shifts in the Earth's field of creation, for they were not hid - den in the chambers of the Earth. 3 They received radiations which mutated their gel forming capacities. The radiations of de - struction were such that they must bear the karma of the gel forming capacities, for they cannot unfold into multiple garments of color until they are reprogrammed back into the children of Light. 4 Enoch said that there are ra - cial forms of creation which have violated the 'Arc' of the Covenant for they have not respected the Father's Will to receive a new cod - ing of light.

When the seven are perfectly balanced, yet distinct, we will go from the Seventh Ray of harmony into the Eighth Ray and become a new Race of the Covenant of Light that can indwell in many light sys - tems in harmony with the Paradise Sons. 6 However, when a color code becomes dominant and remains on the lower chakras which command the gel forming capacities, the"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"KEY 213 6 - 14 higher specie forms of other color codes become displaced and dis - solved. 7 I, Jacob, was told that the Higher Living Hosts come to de - liver their seed from the planet rather than let the Adamic seed be destroyed. They come to pick up the Adamic seed before it is de - stroyed by the gel forming capacities of those who have re - volted against the teachings of YHWH and do not wish to listen to the Instructors of YHWH who try to tell them how to overcome the negativity of their gel forming capacities. 8 When the good seed of all races are delivered from the earth, they will be coded back into the Great White Brotherhood which is of the White Ray of the Eternal Flame. Then, they are apportioned as messengers and teachers into whatever color consciousness, or pigment is necessary to teach peo - ple on different planets whose color could be blue, red, black, white. . . . 9 Instruction is given by the Hiyos Ha Koidesh to the Brother - hoods of Light to activate sacred fire letters, coding those who are apportioned into color embodi - ments of vibration. The Brother - hoods use the sacred fire letters 1-1 to code a blue - white embodiment, 1 - A0 to code a blue - yellow embod - iment, I - EE to code a blue - red em - bodiment, and E-I1 to code a rose - white embodiment. 10 The Brotherhoods of Light activate the sacred fire letters by projecting a burning 'Yod' from their channel of consciousness in the higher realms to a given human circulatory system. After the 'Yod' is projected, the geome - tries of the divine letters are brought forth to imprint new form at the nucleotide base. 11 The color of the 'Yod' that is dispatched by the Brotherhood opens up a fifth circulatory system of Light energy in the body which allows all chakras to share the same pulse of transfigured Light, so that even the lower chakras are transformed into the higher Light. 12 In addition, through color transformation, mankind can work more effectively on a horizontal scale. Consequently, we can heal people through color regardless of their color vibration. Color can also be used for psychotherapy, obser - vation of the electromagnetic field around the body, opthalmological research, and medical surgery using color coordination to encom - pass such feats as the rapid healing of wounds, hormonal changes in the subjugation of the lower chak- ras and the adding of new anatomi - cal organs. 13 This color coding enables the Righteous Ones to even raise the dead as Jesus did with Lazarus when he put a color envelope around the body of the dead Lazarus. This healing Light of Jesus' hands, being perfectly aligned with the Father, generated the current densities necessary to trigger a chemical transmission to awaken molecules in the body of the dead Lazarus. 14 On this planet, we have been isolated in major groups of color codes because one has vio - lated the other. In previous a'ons, there are those that have migrated out of central Asia into various areas of the Earth who have vio - lated the teachings of the Great Lords of Light. Therefore, they did not go to the proper places where the pillars of Light protected the elect from the deadly radiations bombarding the Earth, when the Earth's physical force fields changed during great physical up - heavals. 15 The Sons of Israel were told not to admit into their priesthoods of Light those who were under the influence of the fallen Lords, lest the doctrines of Light be ruined by the physical power governing the physical flesh. They were told to keep the pure vibrations of the blue Ray and the white Ray which emanates from the seed crystal of Life. 16 The fallen Lords teach a doc - trine which does not correlate the seed crystal with the gel forming capacity of the Brotherhoods of Light. Wherever the scriptures of Light are not preached, the vibra - tions of God's Word not heard, the body cannot be activated to become the Living Torah Or. 17 Enoch told me that it was necessary that the Adamic Race preserve the radiations of the color harmonics between the nations of the Earth lest the mixtures of the root races destroy the spiritual capacity of the Christ Race by blood consciousness not aligned with the Throne of the Father. 18 If the blood consciousness becomes unaligned, the body be - gins to fall into geometries of mal - function and geometries of hatred and destruction, geometries which actually neutralize the capacity to work with the functions of Or, with the greater functions of Light. 19 Enoch told me that man has KEY 213 14 - 22 brought an end to his conscious - ness time zone because he has vio - lated the spectra of the color codes. He wishes to function with one or the other color codes but not with all seven. When the seven are brought into harmony with the more subtle forms of color lan - guage, Man will see other forms of color that he presently cannot work with; he will see other forms of in - telligence which already coexist with him in other spatial environ - ments. 20 However, most of the human creation settles for the geometries of color in the physical flesh rather than the body of White Light. This is why the children of Israel have been dispersed to all nations to teach all races, all people of the Father's Plan which is acti - vated through the B'nai Or, who stand behind the Adamic Race and govern the destiny of all planets. 21 The key uses the words 'spectra of color codes \" to explain that the energies of the Lords of Light work through Specter and Spectra - unified polarizations of Light. They allow the human specie to go through its Alpha- Omega spectrum by changing the gel forming capacities. This allows the El and El functions of light radia - tions to change the gel of the DNA - RNA plasma to function with new genetic mechanisms of inheri - tance functioning in a higher wavelength of light. 22 Thr DNA - RNA can then work with higher Light irradiation factors which allow for new changes to take place enabling the body to be ultimately a body of Light. Hence, the receding DNA- RNA will give forth a new physical"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"KEY 213 22 - 31 form for the body of Light and Man will see how the body of the physical flesh, the physical DNA- RNA is simply the biochemical preparation necessary for the infus - ing of the Christ Body of Light. 23 Enoch explained this trans - figuration from the level of physical creation to the Christ Light as a laser - like projection of human con - sciousness through its pyramid of creation. This pyramid fuses the color codes with the geometries and dyes of the Eye of Horus so as to create a new specie in the image of the Lords of Light and the Christ Race. This new being pro - ceeds out of the dyes of the Eye of Horus according to the edge detec - tors and the sense detectors neces - sary to live in new chemical envi - ronments on other planets. 24 The Eye of Horus is the cen - tral focus to automatically create new species. It is the resonant eye focus which changes the nucleotide bases so that one realm of pyrami - dal energy is projected into another body of pyramidal energy. 25 He also explained to me how the nations of the Earth will not understand their genetic codings and their historical karma and op - pose the people Israel who are a people chosen to exemplify the twelve radiations of Light unto the flesh; a people who are to bring the righteous of the Earth into the pyramidal seed crystal of gel form - ing capacities; a people who invoke righteous people to put on bodies of Light, and reign with the Host of the living Light, the Adonai Tsebayoth . 26 When the nations of the Earth rise up to destroy the biochemical vessel of the higher body of Light, then the Hosts of the living Light come to rescue the righteous seed, the remnant seed of all the people who are on the wavelength of God's message. 27 The leadership of the faith - less nations has violated and neu - tralized man's use of God's energy and has prevented the releasing of the purest forms of the fruits of science, medicine, and the con - sciousness of life that is necessary to form the body of Light, the Shiur Khomah. Throughout the cen - turies, these nations have not been able to work with the seed of the great Masters nor understand the patriarchal blessings that speak of the seed which shall reach to the heavens. 28 In ignorance of the higher consciousness of scripture, they have turned their backs against the scriptures that the Lords of Light brought with them. 29 Although the Lords of Light have come down into various parts of the world as a people of Light of the Great White Brotherhood, man on this planet has not been able to decipher the scriptures, and as a result he has not been able to evolve out of the lower sciences of destruction into the higher sciences of Light. 30 The key explains that if the wavelength of our gel forming capacity is of the right color va- lency, infused with the right color geometry of mathematics, then, we will be with those who will con - tinue on the Earth in spite of the deadly changes in radiation. 31 We will not suffer the nega - tive irradiation, or excessive ul - traviolet radiations that will bom - bard places of the Earth for we will inhabit the safe zones at the time of the great geophysical upheavals. Those who are not protected against the radiation will fulfill once again the ancient pre - Aztec saying which speaks of 'Those who were carried away by the Sun's rays into destruction.' 32 The course of our next elec - tromagnetic vehicle will become clearer in the presence of the luminaries who operate using high frequency telecommunication sys - tems of Light transformation. They speak wherever there is an assem - bly of Light collectively called the \" children of Light. \" 33 The Thought - Adjusters are now correcting and repairing our blood crystallization levels of ionized consciousness through fre - quency attunement. This is the making of a people within a peo - ple, and a mind of Light within a mind of light. With this change, the physical flesh, the temple of the higher garment, will receive a new garment of Light. 34 The river of blood crystals which once could speak with God through the garment of flesh will be reactivated by both the pillar of the \" higher \" Light and the Shekinah Spirit which will radiate throughout the body of Man. 35 This inner coding allows us to build our foundation to receive an imperishable garment of Light which we must obtain before we can go through our time zone into the presence of the Father's Throne. This blood crystallization, Min - Ha - Ada - Mah, is the same offer - ing that YHWH offers to those who have preserved their inner and outer garments in righteousness as KEY 213-31-39 a witness to the transformation of the flesh through the Living Word of God. 36 Its message is salvation and its storehouse of energy is Eternal. The Great Pearl of White Light is the price of this freedom. 37 We will be quickened in spirit and in flesh to fulfill the Father's Words. And we will be de - livered directly to Moses, Jesus and Elijah and the Seventy who as - cended into the presence of the Father by physically becoming the \" blood of transfiguration \" and by changing the sacrificial color of blood to be in harmony with \" the fire that issues forth Light before the Throne of YHWH. \" 38 And we as the true Israel are now being prepared for the new blood crystallization of ionized con - sciousness which was demonstrated by Jesus and will be fulfilled by the coming of The Christ to Earth. 39 There will be no end to life, but the implicit end to death will arrive during which time our rela - tive bodies of flesh will attach with 'the Light Body of the Christ pres - ence' - the true Overself body which manifests the embodiments of the flesh born to do the work of the Father. The end will be the re - moval from the power of the 'lesser light forces' who governed the Earth by allowing imperfect incar - nations to violate the sacred colors of the Throne and the Council of Nine, the Council of Twelve, and the Council of One Hundred and Forty - Four.

Such a vast scope of wis- dom could not possibly be con- veyed, in such a short time, using any contemporary earth methods of communication. 7 I was shown how information from many different realms could be uniquely combined in a way that could not be adequately ex- pressed or felt by the human lan- guage because of the slow move- ment of verbs, the same spatial dis - tances that are retained between images in printed language, and the linear direction of black and white human language codings which do not permit the subtle col- orings of higher mental language to be transmitted as a testimony of the actual events. 8 I was also shown how man conceives of his consciousness with a \" period \" of time which becomes a focal point of containment and does not allow for the ongoing movement of his consciousness flow.

Only when you know your true identity with respect to your Overself can there be a true under - standing of the pictographs of Light which give knowledge not only of the immediate reality, but all adjacent realities used in the in - struction of I AM identity from one world to the next. 18 Thus, pictographs not only communicate higher spiritual wis - dom to the brain, but provide us with a new circulatory system for linkage with our higher - selves. 19 These light pictographs work through 'Yod'-like pulsations cen - tered in repeating pyramidal pat - terns extending through all space, KEY 214.13 - 24 time and matter. This allows for the imprinting of higher thought- forms even onto inanimate objects , chosen to receive the light superscripts as a testimony of a Living Language of Light. This was seen in the giving of the Ten Commandments through the cod- ings of Light onto the stone tablets. 20 These thought - forms of the Brotherhood are projected through a multiple \" Tracing of Light \" estab - lishing a network of Light to con - nect one pyramidal center to other pyramidal centers. These centers comprise a giant brain cluster. And thus, by harnessing giant brain clusters which house many galactic intelligences, the physical higher evolutionary intelligence is able to operate a universal communications network. 21 Yet, when the Higher Intel - ligence transmits their signals they can only be received by planetary intelligences with god - like qualities of Love. Their broadcast signal, on this frequency, tells \" whoever has ears let him hear \" how to live in their image. 22 The physical brotherhoods operate horizontally with a pyramid - five as their basic \" brain cluster \" focus. The clusters are ringed to form Merkabah units connected with a galactic central control. They send and receive 'pictographic - cybernetics i ' by tun - ing their brains to establish a com - munications link, strong enough to begin the transfer process. 23 This link with god - qualifying levels can only be formed through the changing of genetic/personality codes reconstructing the body for upward levels of God experience. 24 They transmit only to those"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"KEY 214-24-31 who have the joy of the eternal quest for the infinite God - level; those who have the choice to de - cide whether to evolve into a con - sciousness body of Light or be re- transmuted and recycled within the physical form when their present house - garment wears out. 25 The transmission of picto - graphic - cybernetics works through a \" holistic light - love process \" where the multiple \" Tracings of Light \" interlace the specie hierar - chies of the Adamic seed with the infinite Hierarchies of those uni - verses which comprise the Mind of YHWH. 26 Each galactic mind expansion requires the collection of four addi - tional groups of brain clusters, which are in alignment with us but exist on their corresponding pyram - idal levels. The synchronizing of those who share a \" common image \" takes place before the next levels of godhood can be achieved within the cosmic pyramid in infi - nite cycles of our galaxy. 27 When directed by the god level - 1 pyramidal focus which is the communication link with at least four brain clusters at god level - 0 status, the pyramidal focus allows instructions to beam from one central pyramid to the sur - rounding pyramid centers of evolutionary growth, nurturing growth to elementary god levels. Thus, the four additional clusters complete their evolutionary growth at the god level - 1 status. Through their own ability to send forth knowledge to surrounding centers of evolution, each new god level - 1 group then begins recruiting its god level - 0 civilizations through multiple \" Tracings of Light \" to join with other god level groups that comprise the hierarchy of the local universe. 28 The pictographic radiations reach the brains that are ready to participate in an infinitely expand - ing scale of knowledge throughout their universe. Each brain operates within a cluster of the next level of expansion. Mathematically, the in - dividual brains involving our local universe create a function: 5 where K equals the cosmological constant, equals individual brain clusters, and equals the number of expansions of an augmented brain cluster. Thus the Word of God unfolds in units of 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, 15,625 . . .A 29 By recruiting the human race through its brain cluster, in con - junction with the other levels of physical and Overself reality, the expanding brain pyramid can be moved up an entire level on the God scale within the cosmic pyramid of the galaxy. 30 The pyramid is the most cen - tral module for this infinite expan - sion of consciousness throughout our local universe. When the pyramid exists in a pure energy form, it allows for a wide variety of signals to move through it, trans - mitting anything from concrete matter to high frequency light cur - rents which interconnect with other \" worlds, \" thereby providing instant media between all points of origin. 31 Thus, when the pyramid as a pure energy form is connected with multiple \" Tracings of Light \" it allows for anything from intuitive Illlustration by Robert G.

For the eighth chakra is used to open up the energy envelope of the human cre - ation and provides direct communi - cation at all times, with those of the Great White Brotherhood. And this hovering pyramid of Light can be seen by the Brothers, even in the physical flesh, and is the wit - ness to the resurrection of the flesh. 33 I was told by Enoch that \" the Light pictographs \" will seal the bodies that will be resurrected. These seals will maintain the awareness of the mind to fight off the temptations of death as the soul is removed to other worlds, having first been glorified by the letters that seal the soul in the Father's Book of Life. 34 The Man who sees and un - derstands this is he who enjoys union with the Father's Language of Light; he enjoys unlimited free - dom to move into other realms of consciousness, for he is above any spatial limitation of language. The Father's language respatializes the mind for work with the geometries of the life continuum. 35 Earthbound language has been shaped by the variegated pat - terns of human thoughts, resulting in morphemes and phonemes, or - ganized into linear sentence struc - ture separated by periods. The 'periods \" syntactically produce a consciousness breakage and an in - activation of higher free floating thought - forms that were not meant for the limitations of static syntax; rather, the higher thought-forms were meant for the mind's spatiali- zation into the open geometries of the life continuum. 36 Man will see that everything from his thought - forms to cata - strophic nuclear explosions do not stop within the limitations of his physical planet. He will understand that there are cycles of light with - out \" periods \" of finality, for even the sound waves of previous eras that are now in deep and distant places in space can be perceived and deciphered by the proper in - struments. 37 Thus, the Lords of Light came down from the higher Loka to take on human form and to teach the Language of Light so that the mind of man can expand to see the dawning of other worlds and other realms of creation generating the very thought symbols connecting our plan of consciousness to the Universal totality of the mind - body. 38 In previous cycles, man, under the guidance of the Lords of Light, interpreted the light picto - graphs into an alphabet of fire let - ters and mathematical geometries known as ideographs which were also capable of respatializing any consciousness form that shared this original projection of Light. 39 The Lords of Light warned man not to misuse the Language of Light, by using the wrong ebb and flow of the language patterns, or by using the knowledge of the lan - guage against the Will of the Father. 40 But man did not hearken to the Word of the Lord and accepted instructions from the fallen Ophanim under the command of Semjaza, who shared many of the Eternal Secrets of the Father's Kingdom which men were striving to learn. 41 However, these secrets were shared through the art of warfare, the art of spoken and written lan - guage which was corrupted and segmented, resulting in imperfect scriptures, and other arts enchant - ing man and leading him astray. 42 The fallen instructors also taught the arts of temple building and architecture, and instructed man to build great cities with tow - ers for communication that would unify man with the Hierarchy of the fallen angels. 43 Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel looked down from heaven and saw how the lawlessness on the planet was being used by the fallen angels to extend their knowl - edge to other planetary kingdoms. They appealed to the Throne of YHWH to put an end to the Tower of Babel and to blind the eyes of fallen humanity from the Language of Light. 44 Thus, no longer can the con - ceptual template of man directly assimilate the teachings of the Lords of Light until his body and mind are recharged by the Light KEY 2 emanations of the angelic Hierar - chies and the Brotherhoods of Light. 45 At this time, changes in the new heavens have caused great changes to occur upon the Earth, loosening the chambers of the deep where the great scientific scriptures of the ages are hidden.

These heavens were com - parable to a blue dome. Within this blue dome, run different regions of the heavens which are separated by what they described as celestial crossbars. 15 The crossbars function as floor levels or passages between the heavens allowing various celes - tial bodies to move freely from re - gion to region. 16 Hence, the crossbars, to - gether with the \" cross of Light \" and the \" foliated cross \" configura - tions, mark the sacred places on the Earth where the Merkabah came from the heavens to the Earth, and rose again from the Earth to the heavens. 17 Crosses were used in religi - ous practice, even before the mes - sage of Jesus was preached in Mesoamerica. They were used to indicate the life - giving fusion of di - vine wisdom with the primal ele - ment of earth, taking place through the energy grids which are as \" tools \" for the transposing of energy into life. 18 Thus, when the key speaks of the three stars, they are repre - senting the Magnetic star grids for the geophysical, the mental, and the spiritual forces encircling the PLATE 13.

Without the distinct interplay of events on all three levels there cannot be any quantized achieve- ments. 20 For this reason, Moses- Jesus-Elijah had to come down from the higher heavens into the physical plane to accomplish that which could not be simply accom- plished through the etheric planes. 21 Moreover, these star grids intersect to form cosms of time arcs which, in turn, can be used to change quantum events such as wars, destruction of species, etc. The use of these grids with various levels of mental vibration allows Man to use the power of telethought communication in targeting informa- tion to global points within frac- tions of seconds. 22 With this communication the psi grids of mental communication throughout the planet can be al - tered and new resonance patterns can be created to replace levels of negation. 23 These grids are also incarna- tion grids which are part of a lat- tice network of spiritual embodi- ment throughout our local uni - verse. 24 Enoch explained to me that these are the places where the higher incarnations take place.

In other words, these structures are biologi- cal ' \" energy-packets \" seeded along the Magnetic arcs of intersection of a given planet. 25 These grids allow for greater degrees of creative genius to be in- carnated. A careful study of certain Magnetic grid alignments in the Near East will reveal the \" foot- prints \" of prophetic work man - ifested between Egypt-Israel - Syria. 26 Enoch explained that Israel and Tibet are equivalent to the brain centers in the left and right hemispheres of the planetary mind.

Therefore, they can only be moved aside by the Watchers who reign with Michael and who give the name and seal that will open the grids to the Presence of the Lord, the Father, and the Ancient of Days. 29 Thus, the forces of Mel- chizedek are in control of the initia- tion points in the Tarim Basin and"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"KEY 215 29 - 39 the \" timepieces \" of the Great Pyramid, aligned with the energy grid beneath Megiddo. 30 Masters of Light previously have incarnated in India, Mesoamerica, and South America in previous cycles such as Hamsa, Dharmasetu, Yogesvara, Quet- zalcoatl, 111 Viracocha, etc.; how - ever, the present codes for super- species programs (in terms of proton - precession frequencies) have been placed in Tibet and Israel. 31 Consequently, these incarna - tion grids have correspondences to plenary cycles, or portions of a great plenary cycle revealed to the physical planets by the incarnations of the Lords of Light. 32 These Lords of Light usually come as a trinitized unfoldment of a divine personality, as seen in the three - fold body of Osiris-Isis- Horus, the trikaya of Buddha, Abraham - Isaac - Jacob, and Moses- Jesus - Elijah. They represent the trinitized unity of combining cre - ation, salvation, and regenesis (re - creation). 33 These Lords of Light come as wayshowers to prepare man for the shift in his life cycle. They show how the incarnation- resurrection realignment can take place in the human time frame. This is the fulfillment of Psalm 104 which speaks of man beholding: \" Mountains proceeded to ascend, valley plains proceeded to descend to the place that you [God] founded for them. \" 34 These incarnation grids, therefore, are aligned with the changing Magnetic grids of a given planet so that the lesson of \" death and resurrection \" is parallel to the shift of the Magnetic grids in space and the life meridians in the great - er universe. 35 Therefore, the sacred trinities which form the thresholds for higher evolutionary creation come here to give the final coordination. The final coordination is organized by the Order of Melchizedek who is in charge of organizing worlds created by the outpouring of Light under the command of the Order of Michael and Metatron. 36 To define the sacred grid areas, we start out with the Land of the \" Return of the Dove 1 '* (the area of Altea) in order to under - stand the ancient significance and reactivation of Palenque - Zarahemla, the land of the regathering of the Brotherhood upon the earth. 37 The Head of the Dove con - tains the teachings coded during the evolutionary cycles of the earth, that give all knowledge relevant to the program of Light upon this planet in relationship to the star regions of the Brotherhood. 38 The grids give the major orientation for those portions of the world that survive the major cata - clysms, as well as showing where earth history stands in relationship to heavenly events that were played out, or are to be played out in the deliverance of this world. 39 Within the area of the Head of the Dove there are smaller trian - gular grids of crystal that mark the sacred energy complexes that were actively used by the Brotherhood of Light.

Sirius, Orion and the Pleiades were often used by the priest scientists of previous cycles for their trigonometric calculations. 54 However, the most impor - tant grid structure for our present program is the copper grid struc - ture underneath Megiddo which is aligned with Mount Tabor and Jerusalem. This is the timepiece for the Great Pyramid. 55 Megiddo will reveal the un - derground network of Israel as the central focus for uniting the har - monics of the consciousness grids of the planet. This will allow for different combinations of spiritual energy to converge in one sym - pathetic pulse, in the awakening of the planet. 56 Yet, we cannot speak of the round numbers without mentioning the Great Pyramid, the most pre - cise grid of sacred geometries ever coded in stone. 57 Contained within the Great Pyramid are numerous codes perti - nent to the interrelationships of man with the planet, the solar sys - tem, and the entirety of the galaxy. 58 However, in discussing the various interconnecting grid forma - tions, one of these codes stands out - the measurement of the \" Christ angle. \" The \" Christ angle i ' is formed by the intersection of the First Ascending Passage with the Queen's Chamber Floor Level or the Level of the Summit of the Well Shaft. The angle that is formed is 18' 9.7 \" . 59 The continuation of this angle eastward, from the Great Pyramid, points to the town of Bethlehem, giving the precise angle of how birth, death and resurrec - tion are fused together."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"KEY 215 60-70 60 Bethlehem represents the point of incarnation which is con - nected with the whole drama of the human race's collective initia - tion into the Pyramid.

They do, however, show a correspondence between the ancient tables of Israel that were given thousands of years ago and the stepping stones that are being used by the Higher Evolution to coordinate our pro- gram according to every letter and mathematical value in the program of the holy scriptures. 72 Enoch showed me that just as the Hebrew fire letters are used to connect the earth to the heavens, so also, the Tibetan fire script is used to build conscious- ness thresholds between the heavens and the earth. 73 In Tibet, the sacred scrip- tures of Phowa and Odsal energy give the resonance patterns basic to the evolution of the human race, and basic to the understand- ing of how energy embodiments of consciousness can materialize from other evolutions. 74 Enoch showed me how 'cities of Light \" existed over the Tarim Basin which are the threshold points controlling the in- terpenetrating worlds of conscious - ness that are connected with this planet. I was shown how these are the special places set aside for the higher souls in transition, and for education of the Masters before they incarnate so that they are able to carry out a specific predeter- mined plan in their service to YHWH. 75 Evidence from the Tarim Basin shows that 'the Lords of Light' had once given man the out- line of his living universe through special calibrated documents of stone, metallurgical technology, and communication techniques, whereby the 'Consciousness con- trols' of this planet, set in motion by the Higher Evolution, could be experienced. 76 Similar documents of \" Michaelilu \" exist in Syria, and documents of \"Tak\" exist in Mesoamerica as a testimony to the Treasury of Light planted by the power of Melchizedek, as a de- monstration of the internal potency of \" the Lord \" which can be found within everyone. 77 Enoch said that everyone can be in unity with God, since the of- fering of every breath is a chemical offering of the life substance which brings you one step closer to your eternal body of being on the other side of time. 78 These higher cosmologies were given form from which we are to draw our inspiration; the an- cients believed that the intelligences who brought these higher cos- mologies will return with the com- ing of the \" sword of Light \" to set man free. 79 I was told that after this took place Man would once again create cities of Light for he would have the sovereignty of Light at his command; not just the sovereignty of the sun's light, but the sovereignty of Melchizedek. 80 Thus, this Key of Enoch is a key to the sciences of the past, be- cause only through the work of Melchizedek is it possible to prop - erly decode and encode the time- pieces according to the revealed program of the present age, di - rected according to the sovereignty of YHWH. 81 The Elect are \" the people of the Plan, \" called by faith to YHWH before the foundation of this world and dedicated to the \" faithful working out of God's plan \" in close cooperation with the heavenly hosts. The Hosts administer protec- tion through the Order of Michael; build pyramids according to the Order of Enoch, as tools of trans - figuration (hidden within the very topology of the earth); and liberate through the Order of Melchizedek. 82 Therefore, let it be known that the Order of Melchizedek will KEY 215-80-84 give witness to the Elect in the ap- pointed areas of this planetary sys- tem.

Our spectrum is limited compared to the greater spectrum of the Living Light which coordinates the many electromagne - tic spectrums and which has a more complex spectra in the ad- vanced star worlds. Without the consciousness to go beyond our electromagnetic spectrum we re- main oblivious to the Living Light. 4 Radio astronomers, presently, are taking into account heterodyne detection to get phase differences, and detect motions of masses af- fected by the passage of wave- fronts. This causes a shift that yields the frequency difference be- tween beams. The incoming wave front is subdivided by sub- wavefront measurements. 5 However, radio astronomers will begin to discover anti - gravity sets of crystallized particles by using improved radio synthesis having ultraviolet sensitivity. The control of these sets will help estab- lish a more universal communica- tions system in the intergalactic medium. 6 Crystals are to be used as cyberg devices to amplify and filter communication signals. 7 They are used by the Higher Evolution as fundamental building blocks to set up a measureable grid of a larger harmonic system which allows for different combinations of wave structures to unite and form myriads of gravitational wave com - binations which, in turn, react with one another to transmit thought- forms to physical planetary re- alities."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"KEY 216 8 - 19 8 These wave structures include internal gravitational wave flux and isolated wave flux so that there is an interaction and propagation of condensed Gravitational waves which cancel the accretion of all particles in anti - gravity interaction. 9 From the synthesis of gravita - tional and anti - gravitational wave forms myriads of other waves are created which blend in sympathetic resonance, thus forming the physi - cal structures of communication. 10 The Higher Evolution placed crystal monitors in the lines of force of our Magnetic fields to modulate non - electromagnetic wavelengths of communication. These crystal monitors break the synchrotronic radiations so that the magnetic fields share a new net - work of communication, allowing the old system of communication, including satellite communications, to be sufficiently altered in orbit to receive the new network frequency of the Higher Evolution. 11 Our planetary technology will be influenced by the Higher Evolution which will place our communication satellites into new orbits and use them to channel in - structions to our planetary systems. Even public communication chan - nels are to be used by the Higher Evolution to reach all nations of the Earth with the message of deliver - ance, giving strength to the tes - timony of the Light workers. 12 The Higher Evolution will also activate twelve crystalline fields of communication within the Earth's planetary logos so that man can communicate with the distant galaxies. 13 These crystalline fields are to be found throughout the world in twelve subterranean channels where crystalline energy has been previously used to outfit a scientific technology. 14 We must understand that \" the keys to radiophysics, radioas- tronomy, and communication \" are in these chambers of the earth which are being revisited by the Brothers of Light so that our tech - nology can be focused into them. 15 This will allow us to unlock the grid mappings and understand why these crystalline centers are used as coordination points for many fields of communication to overlap with the Living Light. 16 These twelve crystalline grids intersecting the Earth act as focal points for the transmission of faster - than - light particles. These grids are a combination of momen - tum space angles controlling faster - than - light particle movement and crystal polarization rates. 17 These grids polarize left - handed and right - handed rotations in the field of Gravitational energy pulling between the earth and the sun. Under conditions of faster- than - light particles being used in extraterrestrial communication, the crystalline focal points can be used to cause the wave - amplitudes to collapse and set up a wave - helix for communication through gravita - tional waves. 18 Thus, on a cosmic scale where there are protons imbedded in a Magnetic field matrix a unique spatial orientation can be estab - lished. 19 The cosmic gravitational field determines the lattice spacing of autonomous protons. When that proton matrix is connected with the chambers of the Living Light there is a crystalline counterpart that is activated which, in turn, demod - ulates quantum pion, electron, graviton and photonic pulses. 20 The High Command demod - ulates the crystalline threshold which will allow radioastronomy and \" crystal astronomy \" to com - municate with neighboring stars and planetary stars of intelligence in regions of future habitation. 21 These opened crystalline fields in the Earth will allow for the beginning of biocommunication to take place beyond the present elec - tromagnetic spectrum. 22 In terms of radiophysics and biocommunication, optical as - tronomy and radio astronomy will unite and experience new realities using filters formed through grids of living - organic materials; e.g., a mustard seed which, as part of the system, can be used to witness ad - vanced communication networks. 23 Other aspects of new optical - radio astronomy involve lobes of matter radiating visible fil - aments. Optical - radio astronomy measures visible filaments stream - ing radially away from the galactic center and star - like images that can be seen near a galaxy. It can also screen gaseous material which combines with ultraviolet radiations to produce lobes of matter. 24 We must understand that the ultraviolet spectrum is just the be - ginning of the higher worlds of Light. 25 Crystal communication is capable of going beyond our elec - tromagnetic spectrum by being ac - tivated by the proper psi grids aligned with the twelve crystalline built into the grid struc - ture of the earth. KEY 216 19 - 33 26 Astronomers will use this crystal lattice network to bend the light waves into the consciousness . cells for universal communication. The lattice only needs to be in phase with the crystals in \" nature. \" 27 In addition, the modulation of gravitational waves can be used to overcome the time - lag of elec - tromagnetically based civilizations. There must be a move away from electromagnetic waves to gravita - tional waves. 28 There is an acceleration of massive bodies under gravitational forces. The simplest gravitational waves are quadrupled and can move from simple relationships of two - dimensional vibrations to fifth and sixth dimensional vibrations. 29 Gravitational waves are used to relocate thought - forms into the psyche of the human race by the Higher Evolution. 30 Gravitational wave compres - sion around the body sets up a screen by which the human brain judges the brightness and geomet - ric definition coming out of a light pulse which then yields a single focal value that is maximized when the image is at its optimum. 31 In this way, astrophysicists are instructed to activate psi grids by interfacing consciousness image - ry with relay mechanisms, using the five inner vehicles of \" Light \" to activate the template of spiritual sight before one can 'clear' the servomechanisms controlling the lo - cal space environment. 32 Astrophysicists will under - stand the biological components of in - phased locked loops through mental projection. 33 Contemporary radioastron- omy will be able to make contact"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"KEY 276 33 - 47 with higher intelligence in the In-Space environment of our local sun system. (This is not to include intelligent forms that exist within our electromagnetic spectrum.) 34 First, however, the proper gravitational-linkages must be used to \" clear \" the regulatory grids be- fore physical technology can be used as an interstellar medium for reciprocal interstellar communica- tions. 35 In order to communicate with such advanced star intelli - gence man must also redefine his spatial regions in terms of the in- terpenetration of his life space which is controlled and used by the Higher Evolution. 36 The Higher Evolution uses what is called In-Space (viz., the spatial regions just on the other side of our light threshold for communication); accordingly, our radiophysicists must do the same in working with universal com - munications operating in our planetary space by the fluctuations in the field of light. 37 Therefore, In - Space reality is used by higher intelligence to move within our biosphere, just on the other side of the curtain of our \" common light, \" and must be ex - perienced by the modulation of mental signals through crystals which produce an interface between extraterrestrial intelligence in our own \" In - Space \" environment of consciousness (i. e., looking inward for the signals). A phased array of radio telescopic sensors which would be able to sense change rates between one thousand and several thousand rate units per second would not be able to \" communi- cate \" with higher evolutionary movement without the proper \"In- Space \" relationship. 38 The Higher Evolution some - times screens the appearances of its vehicle movements with a light grid to avoid detection. Here \" avoiding detection \" means \" regu- lation \" - the regulation of higher evolutionary thought-waves which could influence other spatial levels of intelligence through an inter- stellar medium. (This is why the Keys are \" already \" in the cham - bers of the earth.) 39 The Higher Evolution will often deliberately disguise its satel- lite vehicle or \" star \" with a light cover of neutral emissions so as to remain undetectable from the com- ponents of sophisticated gamma ray, X - ray, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation and radiowave transmis- sion coming in from other galactic civilizations investigating new \" life zones \" in unprotected galactic re- gions. 40 Therefore, \" In-Space \" as - tronomers must use the psi- meditational grids which penetrate the light cover and coordinate crys - talline grid communication with techniques of radioastronomy and radiophysics so that the correct wavefront displacement can be re- ceived and the communicative thought - forms be sent out to work with the Brotherhood. 41 The associations of galaxies named according to the various conventions, e.g. Perseus, Virgo, Pegasus II , 2322, Ursa Major, Haufen A, Leo, 1239, Gemini, 0348, Shane, etc., can be ap- proached throu g h a radio- astronomy element housed in a field of crystal transmission units which are photo-sensitive, shield - ing light, and massive enough to produce a radical velocity amp- litude for variation detection in peculiar stars. 42 The communication is given through a meta-language pattern which can be composed into a col- lection of pictographs which are KEY 216:4-1-44 translated into the language of the specie receiving the communica- tion.

MERKABAH RE - VOLVES AND GOES, AND RISES UNDER THE HEAVEN, OR BRIGHTNESS OF THE NEXT UNIVERSE, AND ITS COURSE GOES OVER THE EARTH WITH THE \" LIGHT OF ITS RAYS \" INCESSANTLY INTO MYRIADS OF UNIVERSES WITHIN THE EVER UNFOLDING ETERNITY. 1 The souls who have reached the greatest levels of awareness and attunement with the Father are able to extend themselves through many dimensions of light in service to the many realms of specie intel - ligence desiring to know the mean - ing and direction of Life. 2 This extension throughout the various dimensional realms of intel - ligences is done by Merkabah. 3 \" Merkabah \" was used by the People of Israel to describe the visitations of the Hosts of YHWH to Earth exemplified in Ezekiel's experience of the \"wheel-within- the - wheel. \" 4 Merkabah appears in a multi - plicity of forms; it can be seen as a pure energy envelope of Light as - sociated with the work of a Master, as well as a manifestation of ex - traterrestrial technology of Light, for which reason it is called a \" ve - hicle of vehicles. \" Merkabah is a vehicle which can take on any membrane or color appearance to correspond with you and guide you into other experiences of cre- a tion. 5 Merkabah creates and controls time translation and is the hookup or overlap between dimensions of light. 6 Through this hookup the var - ious light thresholds which inter - lace the galaxies are connected, al - lowing vehicles to travel between the various 'dimensions of light. 7 Merkabah also controls these thresholds to prevent lower intel - ligences from coming in and inter - fering with the Father's Plan. Nevertheless, in consequence of the Merkabah appearance, zones can be created in the lower heavens (of which Earth is a part) that are periodically devoid of supervision. This allows aggressive intelligence from the lower orders of light to land upon this planet and display belligerent instincts towards man. 8 For this reason we must have spiritual discernment by the Holy"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"KEY 301:8- 1 5 Spirit lest we confuse the appear- ance of Merkabah with the vehicle craft of \" negative \" intelligence forced to exist in the lower heavens. 9 And by the Holy Spirit we are being given knowledge at this time so that we can understand how a \" hookup \" will take place be- tween the spiritual forces of Mer- kabah and the physical thresholds of our immediate universe. Through this hookup, which forms an electromagnetic sink, Merkabah has the ability \" To Speak. \" There- fore, it not only creates and con - trols these electromagnetic sinks to enter and leave various dimensions of light, but it has the ability to use them for communication. 10 How does a vehicle speak to us? Through light consciousness forms by means of polarized energy; namely, by energizing the cosmic pulsations to pierce the Earth's electromagnetic field. The message it brings speaks of the Great Infinite Way and our role in the many heavens of creation. 11 Thus, in its flight through the many heavens, Merkabah, the light energy vehicle, through rota- tional circumversion, creates the overlap between various universes of time and space, thereby creating threshold configurations. Conse- quently, by creating threshold con- figurations with its power, Mer- kabah allows one level of intelli- gence to directly connect with a series of other intelligences. 12 Hence, Merkabah can project itself from one life system or galaxy (which contains a series of thresholds) to the life system or galaxy of another universe. There- fore, the key states that it \"rises under the 'Heaven' or brightness of the Next Universe. \" It has the abil- ity to descend from the light field of one heaven into the light field of a lesser heaven, or as Enoch said \" to a local universe within a parent universe. \" Even penetration of black body or thermal radiation is incidental to the movement of the light energy vehicle of Merkabah. (Note: the key is not speaking of Heaven as an abstract plane, but as the next universe, the next vehicle of consciousness space.) 13 What is the source of this greater power? The power and di- rection of Merkabah proceeds di- rectly from the mind which is in conjunction with God. It is the mind of the Master which literally operates, controls and stabilizes the Merkabah at all times so that when the true Merkabah passes through the heavens it heralds the message of the Father. 14 Thus, its course goes over the Earth with the \" Light of Its Rays; \" and it moves along the grids of the Stralim radiations, the Divine energy radiations in parallel phase. The mind of higher spiritual intelligence in conjunction with the Stralim radiations creates the do- mains which allow for the vehicle to operate within the magnetic and electromagnetic areas surrounding the planets. 15 These Stralim radiations are not always present for the physical Higher Intelligence which is the reason why in physical universes the Higher Intelligence has to use technical operations and energy grids. However, even in the physi- PLATE 16. The Merkabah coordinating the trophysical Codes of Life. ,"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"cal universes the Merkabah does not travel but moves within the entirety of a parallel phase, pro - pulsion - repulsion, which is set in motion. Hence, Merkabah moves through the worlds of our physical space domain by a perpetual pulse which uses magnetic and elec - tromagnetic poles energized by the grids of Stralim radiations. 16 Therefore, Merkabah does not \" travel \" between planets but moves within an all - embracing energy field which is composed of multiple magnetic, electromagnetic, and magnetohydrodynamic do - mains unified into a \" field stasis\" using multiple polar denomina - tions. This gives the vehicle operat - ing within the field the ability to go faster than the speed of our com - mon light. 17 Thus, the Merkabah vehicle works through time translation and carries the ability to work simul - taneously with many linear chronologies of specie intelligence: past, present, and future. It has the ability to take species directly out of their own chronologies of time into new homogeneous worlds of creation. 18 The key tells us that by the \" Light of Its Rays, \" Merkabah goes over the Earth incessantly into myriads of universes within the ever unfolding eternity. In other words, the Light is not simply going over the Earth, serving empty realms of space which sur - round the Earth, but the key im - plies that the Earth is just one small part of myriad systems of liv - ing intelligence which are all the concern of the Higher Intelligence. 19 For us to understand why Merkabah should appear over the KEY 301 15 - 25 Earth, we must also understand why Merkabah should appear within the myriads of universes. 20 Merkabah is the interconnec - tion between higher intelligence operating within myriads of uni - verses with their respective earth systems of life intelligence on a parallel phase. We are one singu - larity of light within the pluralism of the Divine Light. 21 Consequently, man is but one form of space - time creation, one space - time singularity on a ray of a larger Merkabah vehicle capa - ble of taking part in the knowledge of the greater system; for we are one microcosm of the collective form of the greater unfolding eter - nity. 22 The Earth is a \" spaceship \" with its rudder cut off going around its sun system on the edge of space completely oblivious to other worlds that have learned to evolve beyond the lip of space. 23 The mission of Merkabah en - compasses several levels: (1) to ex - tend the Light Garment of the Father to new universes just being created; (2) to coordinate the threshold commands in the uni - verses of the Paradise Sons; (3) to evolve and resurrect the Shekinah universes, thus rebuilding even the smallest matter - wave particles into the Adam Kadmon, so all can share in the greater plan of on - going creation. 24 Merkabah is a sovereignty of Light moving over the waters of creation in oneness with the Eter - nal God; it is the image of holiness formed in the air and the Light materialization of the spoken word. 25 The word \" Merkabah \" re - veals the experience of the Body of"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"KEY 301 25 - 35 Light which descends from higher realms and commands the life force of man to awaken to and be inte - grated with the universal intelli - gence. 26 In order for us to understand the word \" Merkabah, \" we must understand the context in which it has been used in the scrolls of Light for Merkabah is the vehicle of communication used by the Com - mand of the Hosts. 27 The appearance form of Merkabah is given to the evolving creation in terms of what the cre- ative intelligence will understand within its reality structure. 28 And the Zohar tells us of how Merkabah has issued forth many scrolls of dictation through the Divine Light. And the Elohim use this Light to commission the Lords of Light to extend their knowledge and intelligence through Merkabah vehicles to evolve the lower worlds. And through Mer- kabah the Child of God also can extend his knowledge to other mansion worlds. 29 Consequently, the Merkabah vehicles can connect with anything from star systems to the crystal patterns of inner Shekinah king - doms within the seeds of life to bring new Light to dimensions that have fallen. Therefore, Merkabah works also with the Shekinah to evolve any life form to spiral beyond its present life form and connect with the crown of glory. 30 We can see how Merkabah can spiral through the inner chem - ical lattice of planetary program - ming so as to attune the species to central growth cycles, or speed through star systems and connect a lattice of stellar growth with parent universes or super - universes in dif - ferent dimensions which can aid the evolutionary intelligence. 31 Enoch explained that just as the mind through faith healing can directly concentrate its brain waves on a finger or foot cell and project healing through a turaya light cir - culatory grid built into the heart, the Lords of Light can use laser- like Stralim radiations to project energy from the Merkabah vehicle into our turaya system for the edu - cation of the human self and/or the repairing of the program. 32 Merkabah is also the body of the Master coordinating your Over- self body with your human body. The Overself that you have does not exist in vacuous space waiting aeons for the Christ to appear, but is working continually in other di - mensions of the greater living total - ity coordinating with the Masters of Light through the direct teaching of Merkabah. 33 Merkabah therefore allows the Overself body to dome with the physical body rather than vice versa, when you are ready to move into the next step function, to work with the next cycle of soul progres - sion. 34 Merkabah is the radiation of Light which ties thought - form cre - ations of Father universes to Son universes, and Son universes to lower universes of living technol - ogy still evolving in the realms of the Seven Mansion Worlds, the Light worlds of the lower luminaries. 35 Merkabah is witness to the bringing of prophetic consciousness from one level to other levels of creation. And without Merkabah no man could enter into the Presence of the Father, for Merkabah is the emanation of Nartoomid returning to the bosom of the Father. The events of Elijah going into Mer- kabah, Isaiah seeing Merkabah, Ezekiel experiencing Merkabah - all speak of Merkabah as a form of time translation for the prophets of Light. They receive their orders, their \" great commission, \" from the higher life systems to teach plane - tary intelligence on behalf of the Hierarchy of Light. 36 This experience of the 'wheel - within - the - wheel i ' can be received in many different forms from that of: the spiritual Body of Light, a spiritual vehicle of Light (as a pure energy vehicle), or a space technology that has instant acceleration with power to travel at 2.9 times (or more) the speed of light as defined by man. 37 And once man has evolved into a greater understanding of Light, he will also use equations of spiritual energy which will allow him the facility of space travel to other universes, and receive the consciousness education and teach - ings that the Higher Evolution de - sires to share with our planetary society. 38 In fulfillment of this pro - phetic science, the Jerusalem communique from Orion has an - nounced the coming of the Hosts which will be like twelve burning sun systems coming down to the face of the Earth. The New Jerusalem will be revealed as a Merkabah totality, a system which will coordinate all building blocks of crystal into one greater life force. This is why the key tells us that the higher intelligence uses the energies of Merkabah to speak and KEY 301:35-43 to address man on the nature of the living universe through the transmission of wisdom from the Merkabah in the sky. 39 And when I was a young man, I beheld a vision and look! Yiskiah, Lord of Light, appeared before me in a body of Light and I began to behold the meaning of Merkabah. 40 Many years passed while I sought out the meaning of the an - cient scriptures of Light so as to understand the Light of God's Word. Then, in my 33rd year I prayed that the fulness of Mer- kabah be revealed to me and that I be given knowledge to help my fel - lowman. In answer to this prayer the great Master Enoch appeared to me and said, \" Are you ready? \" 41 And then, a Light was put around my body and I was taken by the Master's body of Merkabah through a white - light illumination until I could no longer remember time nor concern myself with the three dimensions of physical time- space. 42 I was shown how higher life intelligences move through space by the precise mathematics of gravitational demodulation and re - modulation of light waves. 43 I was also shown how higher intelligence enters a plan - etary atmosphere by measuring the magnetic parameters of the plan - etary event horizon. And once they determine the orbit of the param - eter, a test is taken to see what energy fields need to be crossed. Once they know how many fields need to be crossed they create what they call rotational circumver- sion which is two conic sections of light being brought together (one"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"KEY 301.43-52 being the field of the Merkabah vehicle, the other the field being crossed) through the orbits of their Magnetic fields. 44 Therefore, by connecting their relativity with a given plan- etary relativity, they are able to go through the parameters of a given sun system. In doing so they put a spiral of light within a spiral of light which allows them to connect with levels of three - dimensional space from the standpoint of ex- panding and contracting gravita- tional density. 45 This creates a type of cosmic lens through which they can mea - sure not only the electromagnetic density, but also the biological fields best suited for the type of light technology they need (for the local universe is made up of many biological Alpha-Omega systems working on different wavelengths of light). 46 The reason why some of these space technologies look transparent within our space di- mension of light is simply that they come from a higher coding of light (the Stralim) which enables them to be respatialized to come through a multidimensional hole into a three-dimensional time set. In other words, by traveling in wavelengths higher than what Earth scientists measure ca. 7,800 Angstroms or wavelengths lower than 4,000 Ang- stroms, (i.e., in wavelengths that cannot be imaged by our eyes) Merkabah has the ability to travel and translate man. Merkabah uses its geometry of Light in providing for time translation into other life zones comparable to the thresholds of the human experience. 47 The vehicle has the ability to go faster than the speed of light and in searching for planetary targets, the mother vehicle or legion vehicle slows down and enters the energy portal. 48 Through these portals, time tunnels or \" wormholes, \" vehicles can be seen in the sky proceeding from a faster light dimension which seems etheric with respect to our light dimension. 49 And while traveling faster than the \" speed of light, \" they have the ability to measure the threshold of a given sun system to determine the entrance points of their planetary target. Then, they slow down if necessary to come in and materialize within the molecu- lar frequency of the given spectrum of light energy. 50 In the higher force fields there are no such things as con- crete objects; motion all depends upon the order, grid and template of atoms that are traveling on a particular frequency of light. 51 To make this interconnection between their energy stream and the energy stream of the intelli - gence being probed, the Higher Evolution matches their kinetic energy frequencies with the angular velocities of particles in the energy stream being penetrated. This in- terpenetration can be carried out through complicated flight patterns so as to take inventory of the specie without interfering with the consciousness presence of the aver - age earthling. Only the Child of God, who can operate on that fre - quency, is capable of seeing and discerning the presence of their energy field connecting with ours. 52 The discerned energy field of the vehicle, during space maneu- vers, typically can appear as a pul - sating pyramid, a pentagon, or a Star of David. In addition, the Higher Evolution has flight patterns which go through multiple tracings of light, through complicated trian- gular coordinates. They do this to key into certain time periods of the species' growth and development. They generally appear in the lower heavens as three vehicles in trian - gular formation. However, the Merkabah vehicles actually work with high frequency vehicle coun- terparts existing in a companion energy stream so that they balance each other when entering and leav- ing the electromagnetic and gravita- tional density of the planets. 53 For every set of triangular coordinates a companion set is necessary to harness the diminish- ing frequencies within the star sys tem's electromagnetic field. 54 Thus, the Higher Evolution establishes control of A-line fre - quencies of light by having a cor- responding B - line control under the guidance of Merkabah vehicles which are invisible to the eye but necessary to balance the activities of the A - line spectrum vehicles. Without this balance the vehicles would run the risk of materializing within the densities of planetary nuclei or within gross material forms in space which are in the pathway of a vehicle's G - line or gravitational control. 55 On the physical level of cre- ation, the Higher Evolution even has special planets reserved for metallurgy and for the creation of gigantic motherships fifty to five hundred miles in length. These planets have no radiation belts around them. This allows the KEY 301-52-60 Higher Evolution to create vehicles having concentric atoms, capable of withstanding the tensor strength of the Magnetic lines of force. 56 The vehicles of Merkabah are capable of taking the human evolu - tion into blue-white star fields of Population II Life Sytems. But be- fore man can enter the Merkabah vehicles and be taken to other star dimensions, he must be sufficiently prepared for the great energies which emanate from the Merkabah vehicles. Only when Man's con- sciousness is sufficiently prepared with the Love of the Father to un- derstand the purpose of Merkabah can the vehicle open its energy portal to project a blue-white light which creates an energy field around the body to protect it against changes as the body is taken into the vehicle. 57 Thus, those who believe in the Father's Will and desire to work with the Brotherhood are those who will feel tremendous energy changes in their bodies, for they are being chemically re - spatialized to live in a more active Light environment. 58 No longer will it be said \" the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak \" for the flesh and the spirit will be in one highly charged body of Light. 59 In circumstances where a physical body is taken into a physi- cal vehicle, the vehicle intelligence places this light energy field around you and you are im - mediately projected inside the ve- hicle through the system they call transvirulence. 60 The vehicle is able to take in- telligence from all geophysical con- ditions and bring them into a cen- tral module. \" A \""},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"KEY 301.67-70 61 They have the ability to ac - tually materialize their conscious - ness thought - forms into any given level of technology they desire. 62 They have the facility to take you in through this energy called transvirulence which is a \" float vac - uum \" which allows your body to be floated aboard the vehicle. Through transvirulence you are biochemically respatialized to live on their wavelength; so there is less of the gross material \" you \" in the physical geometry of what is ''your body, \" but it is \" you \" in the transfigured matter - energy form within the chemistry and geometry of what is considered necessary for communion with you. 63 These are the dimensions of the true Israel of Light, those who are capable of working with the luminaries; they who are trans - formed to work with Merkabah which moves through fields of color flux as a light pyramid of energy conversion synchronized with whatever light frequency channel calls for assistance. 64 I was told that many do not understand their own God realiza - tion and their own scriptures, and therefore it is necessary for man to receive again \" the weights and measures of Enoch \" and the new scriptures of Light so as to prepare him for the new threshold densities beyond the imprisonment of the continual rounds of physical exist - ence in the Seven Mansion Worlds. 65 Merkabah is bringing the final victory over the priestly altars of consciousness sacrifice which gut the spirit in the Name of God. I was told that this redemptive activ - ity was illustrated in the biblical scripture of the sacrifice of the in- nocent between the horns of the altar and the sanctuary (Luke 11:51). The horns stand for the be - ginning and end of a consciousness threshold which must be experi - enced again and again until the soul has sufficient strength to be re - embodied within the Christ body of Light. 66 And I learned much regard - ing the consciousness evolution of the Merkabah vehicles whose sole purpose is to turn all grief into great joy and liberation. 67 Thus, I speak to you that you may know the secret of hidden things within the chambers of Liv - ing Light and that you may ascend, as servants of The Living Word, up the spiral staircase of crystal energy into the vehicles of Melchizedek, wherein the faith of all ages may be revealed as the true and living faith of Israel. 68 Eternity will unfold another dimension and each dimension will be made through the Stralim, the light rays of Divine Light. 69 Truly, the Merkabah vehicle is not the vehicle of destruction or those vehicles known as the Brahma Weapon or Indra's Dart as found in the Rg-Vedic scriptures or hymns to the sun. The Merkabah vehicle is not a vehicle of warfare or intelligence from some other universe out of coordination with YHWH. 70 The Merkabah vehicle works with the Nartoomid, the Eternal Light; it works with the Shekinah, the Inner Universe working with the extended Presence of the Father. It also works with the Lords of Light and the Sons of Light who work collectively as the 144,000 Masters of the Christ who bring forth redemptive energy. 71 The key greets us in the name of Merkabah and invites us to enter into the presence of myriads of universes sharing the same divine presence of the Father. 72 And you accept it by asking that the Higher Intelligence work - ing with YHWH, the Eternal Mind, come into you and use you as a Light unto your fellowman. You must empty yourself of the \" confu - sions of the world \" and ask the Father to pour His Light into your garment of flesh. 73 Then, you will actually feel the \" body of Light \" consciousness come into you, once you have bal - anced your field and have removed yourself from all of the negative particles of the anti - universe which hold you locked in space. 74 When you are balanced and have removed yourself from the negativity of the anti - universe; when you experience the Gemat- rian Body of Light consciousness, then you will be able to experience the presence of the Holy Spirit within you and you will commune with the Lords of Light through Merkabah. 75 The Brotherhood of Light lias clearly stated that Orion - Kesil KEY 301.70-80 is our stellar Central Control, for Orion is a dwelling place of the Living Light consciously and con - tinuously sending the emanations of the spiritual Hierarchy into the gravitational fields of the lower planetary worlds. 76 The face of eternal time is given to us when we guide and de - liver our planetary vehicle beyond our electromagnetic density into the threshold of the Eternal Light. 77 In our time of consciousness translation, Merkabah will throw its twelve spiral radiations of pyrami - dal light energy upon the face of our dying body of destruction. And at that time there shall be a great uplifting by wings of fire into the crystal throne of our regenesis. 78 This is the Astrophysical Messiahship of Israel and of Judah who wears the face of the Lion- Sphinx. 79 This is the fulfillment of the priesthoods of Aaron, Zadok, and Melchizedek being offered up to the myriad universes of the Father's Throne. 80 Arise! 0 Israel and present yourself before your Beloved One who calls you by the name of His love: Israel reborn!"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"waves and Matter"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"THE KEYS TO FUTURE LUMINARIES ARE WAVES MATTER WAVES WHICH WILL REVEAL THE SECRETS TO OPENING AND SPANNING ELECTROMAGNETIC SINKS THROUGH WHICH \" WHOLE LIGHT BEINGS WILL BE RE - CEIVED. \" 1 The key explains how Mes - sianic forces travel from universe to universe through given elec - tromagnetic sinks, or points of gravitational collapse. Communica - tion with other worlds that are moving faster than light can also be received through these points by using matter and muon waves. 2 In the context of the key we are to understand two major func - tions: (1) matter waves have the ability to move faster than light, and (2) muon waves* are the fall - ing particles of light as they fall from one geometry of creation to another. 3 Metatron emphasized the use of matter and muon waves to move the spectrum vehicles of the physi - cal brotherhoods through the spheres of influence of the elec - tromagnetic sinks, enabling them to code their technology into physical universes at will. More specifically, matter and muon waves are first used by the Brothers of Light to measure the proportions of an elec - tromagnetic sink, as well as parallel 'Muon waves are predicated at eight times the length of matter waves in our con- sciousness time zone electromagnetic fields that exist be - tween electromagnetic sinks. (In this process, they measure the proportions by calculating complex movements pertaining to the sink.) 4 By forming a grid of meas - urement on the basis of the statis - tics of matter and muon wave in - terference, they can determine at what points their vehicle will span a given electromagnetic sink. 5 As the spectrum vehicles span electromagnetic sinks, they reveal multi - gravitational sets. These sets are used as the master field for projecting vibrations of thought patterns into specific harmonies. Sometimes even the total mass energy of the spectrum vehicle is circulated for physical materializa - tion in another spectrum. 6 Hence, the matter - muon wave coupling allows for man to experi - ence fifth - dimensional realities by opening up the conic section from which he is normally excluded. 7 By going through the light cone, one experiences the mystery of all surrounding light cones con - nected with hyper - dimensional space. (Note: The mechanisms of the living cell are coded into the"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"KEY 7 cone.) These light cones form a cir - cular field while retaining their specific singularities which can be exchanged by tumbling over into a new domain. 8 Therefore, the synchronization of our light cone with the other light cones of surrounding space and time uses particles to trans - fer physical mass from one light cone to another. With this ability to move through space and time anomalies, the Brotherhoods can select any given corridor from the sink for vehicle movement. 9 Hence, on a galactic scale of events matter - muon wave coupling allows higher evolutionary thought - forms or even physical mass to occupy any of an infinite number of universes with multiple variations. 10 Flight time between conic sections varies with the biological or matter - energy tolerance in flow - ing from energy span to energy span. Here all prime infinitesimal units of mass energy particles can be formed from \" no mass \" infinite motions, which offer the resistance to a change, to another motion. 11 And in travel through elec - tromagnetic sinks, the intrinsic resistance in the change to another kinetic motion gives the impression of inertia or mass to the surround - ing energy field of the spectrum vehicle. The impression of inertia is due to the powerful spans of energy that must be crossed within seconds of flight. 12 In order to overcome high frequency resistance levels, it is necessary to go beyond compound matter - energy \" bondings \" which are contained within electromagnet - ic \" skins \" and are impenetrable by the lower physical intelligence. 13 The matter - muon combina - tion is also used to control univer - sal zero - point vibrations which ac - counts for the pattern of the molecular force. This universal zero - point (where the cones come together) is a point of original at - tachment to other universal sys - tems through which creation takes place. Secondary systems of physi - cal creation must acknowledge the universal zero - point as the origin of galactic matter in the same way a child acknowledges the cord of his mother's womb out of which he is extended. 14 Thus, within a central galac - tic point of gravitational collapse, the breakup of the light particles is used to coordinate emerging pat - terns which give shape to the new order of evolutionary creation. 15 In addition, the matter - muon wave combination is important in the acceleration of cosmic rays and other particles. In the hands of the Brotherhood, the matter - muon wave combination prevents mutu - ally destructive wave - rotations be - tween bodies of gravitational attrac - tion which would yield a composite of wave - rotations leading to the collapse of a given ether. 16 In this process, neutrino, omega, and proton grids are con - structed to control the elastic scat - tering effects that take place while old vectors collapse and new vec - tors are constructed. 17 The matter and muon cou - pling (specter - spectra) coordinates these energy grids and simultane - ously allows for specie develop - ment on one planet to be extended to other levels of intelligence on special \" grids of light, \" for all the regions of space being recon - structed. 18 The coupling also extends to consciousness particles known as and w, which are combined in a unique way thus allowing the specie to participate in the energy modulation of life. 19 This reorganization, coordi - nated by matter and muon waves, also allows for special grids of measurement to arise which allow for the structuring of elec - tromagnetic parallel energy fields to be adjusted and reorganized permitting species to travel from one zone of creation to another. 20 this is only done to plan - etary systems which threaten to destroy other specie forms of cre - ation, as well as civilizations help - lessly undergoing the death of their star system. Then, the \" Whole Light Beings \" come to help the specie if it chooses to take the higher spiral of light instead of the lower spiral of planetary decay and degeneration. 21 When you understand that the universal intelligence operates through the activation of thought- forms, you will understand that we are the materialization of projected universal thought - forms. The ''Light beings \" decide whether the resultant thought - forms can suffi - ciently use data and knowledge as consciousness fields to work with the universal consciousness, or whether the energy fields require the intervention of \" material \" tech - nologies generated by the Brother - hood of Light. 22 Generally, the \" Whole Light Beings \" indirectly feed the informa - tion to rescue the specie in ques - tion so as not to violate surround- KEY 302 zones of consciousness de - velopment. Yet, at times there arise instances where mutual programming is necessary. 23 More specifically, on a phys - ical level, the spectrum vehicles, under the command of the Coun - cils of Light, locate a planetary population that has a negative in - flux of energy from destructive ro - tations has a destroyed at - mospheric cover so as to allow de - structive rays to bombard the sur - face of the planet. Then, the Brotherhood by means of a holding position weaves a grid network of specter and spectra wave rotations so as to balance critical mass and allow for a harmonic to be estab - lished. 24 The holding position is main - tained to keep out negative radia - tions from interfering with the or - ganic evolution while the network is being woven. 25 The new network allows for a harmonic to be established in the balancing of critical mass. 26 This network is initially given an \" inductive kick \" by mul - tiple magnetic fields controlled by the vehicles of the Brotherhood. 27 This multiple magnetic field which the Brotherhood uses is partly that of the vehicle and that which is found in the surrounding environment which is used to create a perpetual pulse. 28 This perpetual pulse creates a positive feedback where the mat - ter and muon flow has been speci - fically applied; the inductive kick and matter - muon fields allow for the syntheses of energy fields that will create enough energy to sus - tain the original kick. 29 Then the specter-spectra-"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"KEY 302.29 - 38 spectrum light force is projected di - rectly into the planetary environ - ment of the specie which is being balanced within the holding posi - tion while it is being freed from the \" negative \" influences which keep consciousness locked in space. 30 Hence, the specie such as man can then be opened to a new consciousness dimension whereby the electron implant is directly in conjunction with the wave - rotation generated by the vehicle. 31 Thus, the \" Light Beings \" come not only to raise the con - sciousness of individuals but, in some instances, the levels of collec - tive humanity. This entire collective consciousness is brought into new quantum numerical ranges by a new cosmological constant. Throu g h these wave configurations, collective humanity can be received and delivered by \" the brothers \" into the higher universes through the constants of curvature which are opened. 32 While this transformation from one spectrum to another is taking place, the reprogramming vehicle of the Brotherhood uses a function known as the 'El Spectrum - Reciprocal' to counterbal - ance all energy spin - offs that would be disruptive to the new vectors. 33 The spectrum - reciprocal technique allows for the coordina - tion of flight patterns of the vehicle by using pyramidal projections. These projections emanate in such a way as to penetrate the surface evolute where the locus of the in - tersection meets with each mobile sphere (containing polarized life- forces) in surrounding space. The technique involves the use of these pyramids of light to balance the gravity shells of the ether sur - rounding the planet. 34 The pyramidal emanations of light penetrate each gravity layer surrounding a planetary sphere be - cause on each gravity layer there may exist different dimensional sys - tems of intelligence and by bring - ing in a new energy field there arises the possibility of destroying both physical and ethereal levels of parallel intelligence if their gravity forces are disrupted. 35 Once the holding position is perfected, the \" Whole Light Be - ings \" are able to control the flux lines so perfectly that the vehicles can create their own energy cor - ridors to appear on the surface of the earth. This creates a new energy zone of life, by means of a \" pillar of light \" transport, to de - liver man through the vehicles without disrupting the planetary gravity forces. 36 When the function of light is freed from its cubic restriction of matter, the A-line and B - line grids of development are freed to refor - mulate the triangular coordinates of the pyramidal functions of light geometries on the next orbital level of the universal mind to sustain the development of life. 37 Thus, the vehicle alters the biogravitational field of a living or - ganism and \" replaces \" the former time - space of consciousness obser - vation. The Brotherhood of Light leaves behind the reformulated model for another period of plan - etary development. 38 The refocusing of the totality is through Merkabah which trans - forms space - time matter; space and time being within the conscious - ness of the specie, and matter being a consequence of vibratory energy which is projected as the sustaining frequency of the image pattern. A unit of space - time mat - ter transcends to a new level of creativity through a \"muload\" (quantized matter transported in space - time) of matter - muon waves. 39 The materialization of Light moving into new electromagnetic space and time can refocus the to - tality of the former energy into a new orbital field. 40 The matter - muon combina - tion plays a very important role in the adjustments of the final grid - the consciousness control grid in step with the light zone - in the final phase of transportation to a new galactic region. 41 This role is to prevent the in - terference of negative consciousness particles from other light zones that are adjacent to a primary light zone that is being regenerated. Unlike particles in the physical form, these particles work through hyper - dimensional space and must be screened by the matter - muon wave grid lest the specie lose its mental and spiritual capacity during the shifts into new consciousness re - gions. 42 Thus constantly changing thought - patterns of collective evolutionary intelligence must be screened within a Son universe by a central energy network. This network, using matter - muon waves, allows the appropriate thought - patterns to connect energy sub - components of one set with other sub - components in other light zones in the same universe. 43 The matter - muon wave cou - pling also allows for specter- KEY 302 38 - 49 spectra - spectrum projections of matter waves and gravity waves to come through atmospheric layers to the planet and impart paranormal gifts to the multitudes of the elect. 44 Since the spectrum vehicle works on a planetary scale, the ex - hibition of these paranormal abilities are not limited to the gifted few in the attendance of a spiritual teacher, but are freely bestowed to all those who will freely open their god - self in service to humanity and the Father. 45 After the matter - muon wave coupling is achieved through Metatronic physics of a conscious - ness implant, consciousness can re - side in a new body no longer lim - ited by the old material form. 46 However, matter and muon wave combinations allow for varia - bility in experimental universes, using the \" ciphers \" of previous memory programs which must be \" relearned \" and integrated with the renewing process of the mind of each Creator God. 47 Unless we understand this consciousness creation in terms of other consciousness time zones, we remain in the weeping and gnashing of teeth in space isolation without the understanding that we are not alone! 48 Prepare your consciousness to recognize the appearance of 'whole Light beings \" through the gifts of the Holy Spirit for they represent your counterparts in the greater creation. 49 \" Whole Light Beings \" appear to give testimony to the ongoing creative power of the people of God and specific changes that occur within evolutionary subsets of the Father's Kingdom."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"KEY 302 50 - 52 50 The luminaries that come through electromagnetic sinks re - joice in the realization that we are being remade into the image of the Adam Kadmon.

And I would have you remember from the be - ginning of this cycle that the Lord God ordained angelic emissaries who are in accord with the Office of His Son, to teach these things to the planets: to Love the Father and to Love one's fellow spirit in all kingdoms of creation. 2 These angelic emissaries were ordained after the Order of His Son, in a manner that thereby, the people might know in what man - ner to look forward to His Son for redemption and migration to the next program of creation. 3 The energy codes held within the hands of the emissaries, who interpenetrate the universes, are the keys of \" love - powered radia - tions \" which sustain the Father's Thought - Forms as they intercom - municate between His Living uni - verses. 4 From the Councils of Light, the \" Whole Light Beings \" as emis - saries, carry the codes of limitless intercommunication between the living star universes as a field of intelligence serving the life forms of the Divine Face wherever they may be found. 5 All their codes of limitless in - tercommunication are keyed to go from (Tav) into (Jah) which is the synthesis of all of the Light emanations of the Holy Sephiroth giving divine instruction. Therefore, the future luminaries are those who wear the (Jah) upon their foreheads for they have gone through the (Tav) to recognize the end which has no end. 6 The emissaries give the codes to the meek and righteous of the earth who will plant their codes by compassion and love - powered radi - ations. It is through the love- powered radiations that the seed can manifest not only here, but in the other worlds and cycles of the \" Eternal Inheritance. \" 7 The divine seed, even expressed as Man, has been created to exist as a dynamic life force, to experience the many levels of Uni - versal Godhood within the Father's Plan. Hence, it is through the mul - tiplicity of the divine seed within the Father's Plan, that creation can"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"KEY 303.7 - 1 7 evolve to experience levels of Elohistic divinity and co - reign with the Lords of Light. 8 In essence, this divine seed is the thought - form pattern used by spiritual intelligence to evolve a given soul progression of con - sciousness out of the infinite pos - sibilities available. 9 And, thus, the emissaries have been called to this holy call - ing, to evolve the soul embodi - ments to greater levels of experi - ence. They have been called on ac - count of their faith active in love, while others could not discharge the divine seed from the limitations of the body and mind until it had finished its complete cycle of planetary experience. 10 Hence, the messenger Whole Light Beings who cultivate the di - vine seed and aid in the comple - tion of its program of soul growth, are emissaries because they under - stand the mystery of undoing all the seals which were used to bind the soul between each expansion of the universe. 11 They who were not captured within 'limited envelopes of light' were thus prepared from the foun - dation of the world to assist with soul evolution. And being called by His Holy Calling into \" communities of spirit, \" these messengers ad - minister to the intelligences through hyperspace, teaching the levels of diverse intelligence to obey and carry forth all combina - tions of the Father's Command - ments. 12 These angelic emissaries ad - minister to the teachers in human form. Thus, through limitless inter - communication the Councils of the Brotherhoods, stationed upon the earth, are informed of the vast changes continually going on in the heavenly realms. 13 The Adamic Race within this galactic system originally had limit - less intercommunication until the time of the Fall. From then on the planetary families of the Adamic Race, within our Father universe, were cut off from limitless inter - communication and were placed on an omega cycle of consciousness death. 14 The early attempts to regain limitless intercommunication re - sulted in the destruction of the Tower of Babel (which is one in - verted code structure of Abba), 15 This is the reason the 'Pro - gram Israel' was given to open the vibrations of the human soul to the Sephirothic intermediaries who bring consciousness expansion so that Man can cry out \" Abba, Father \" as the Adam Kadmon Body of Christ demonstrated. And we pray \" Our Father, \" for restitution must be made to our Father as the source of unity for the balances of all Son and Shekinah universes af - fected by the Fall. 16 This planet, as a result of the Lucifurian rebellion was placed in a state of retrogressive evolution, so that even the \" Masters \" who in - carnate must pay the price of this karmic evolution by continually being conditioned to physical limi - tations and life in ignorance of the divine voice, until they are recon - nected with their divine Overself as shown in the baptism of Jesus. 17 In general, the course of soul evolution in our Son universe is to serve and fulfill a specific program that has been predetermined in the Overself state.

The Overself, too, is evolving towards pure conscious - ness divinity. 19 The main assumption in \" in - tercommunication \" and compassion for the physicals in the lower worlds of rebellion is that the weights and measures of service decrease linearly with the original position at the beginning of a given program. 20 This means that if a Master embarks on an entropic - negative program (in service to or supervi - sion of lower physical worlds), his incarnations are activated in pro - gressive limitations because of the overall scale of retrogressive evolu - tion which influences the soul (in the lower worlds of physical en - tropy), to be pulled back into re - petitive rounds of existence. 21 However, through the work of the Overself Masters who serve the Office of the Christ, the con - tinued state of the education of the soul and refinement of conscious - ness Light can overcome 'con - ditioned limitation' so that the soul can be creatively reunited with the Overself Continuum. At that point, the individual soul can override 'negative programming' through the ability to forge a new program with the 'Collective Overself,' or incarnate back into positive or negative planes of the lower physi - cal worlds to assist other forms of limited consciousness. 22 The present state of soul evolution in our planetary field is that of neg: 0 < 0]. 23 When the original position of 'On +1 ' in the progression of soul evolution can be corrected, at the end of a program the soul can be advanced into a new program which can allow it to pro - gress into the image of its divine Overself and eventual unity with the Adam Kadmon. 24 Thus, through the Office of the Christ this continued state of soul confusion and inability to con - nect with \" limitless intercommuni - cation \" is recognized and compen - sated for by the human attunement to the spiritual intermediary of the Office of the Christ. The Office di - rects the spiritual intermediaries as - signed to balance the communion between the physical self and the Overself within progressive states of degeneracy. 25 Therefore, the individual can override negative programming through help from the Office of the Christ which is in coordination with other Whole Light Beings. 26 In special circumstances, di - vine intervention allows Masters of Light to directly interconnect with a soul program and speed up the spiritual education of a soul that is needed in other programs of Light. 27 Unfortunately, the \" negative drag \" on this end of our local uni - verse is so overwhelming that, in spite of all the thousands of Bud - dhas and \" Christed Masters \" pierc - ing the planetary veil of soul evolu - tion, it is still necessary for the Hierarchy to return and collectively externalize in order to take the righteous physicals with their soul vehicles off the planet through res - urrection. They do this in order to prevent the soul from going back into imperfect spectrums of Omega. 28 This is why soul - Man as Christ - Man must go beyond Alpha and Omega and why the planet is being resurrected at this time. 29 And, in order to help Man cross his Alpha - Omega threshold, the \" Whole Light Beings \" carry the equations for limitless intercom - munication. 30 They work collectively to allow all spiritual intelligences to extend their consciousness activities throughout the entire spectrum, throughout all possible states of life, providing maintenance on all levels of education. Collectively, the \" Whole Light Beings \" make concerted plans towards resolving interrelationships between the vari - ous zones of consciousness in the Father universe. 31 They can recreate and direct a unified life system filled with a complex tapestry of interwoven af - finities. As exemplaries of God's creative power, they manage not simply the economy of organic ter - restrial nature, but a full cosmic economy for the benefit of the Father in the management of myriad levels of consciousness. 32 This explains why there is no absolute predestination, but rather soul preconditioning that al - lows for many unique combinations of soul evolution and physical evolution to occur in every growth cycle. 33 The collective prescriptions made by the many Orders of Light give a basic reading of how many units of Light are necessary to genetically reprogram the physical body to accept a higher soul evolu - tion and resurrection into a new program of spiritual teaching. 34 Genetic reprogramming al - lows for the physiological processes to be aligned with a new \" Logos KEY 303.28 - 39 Equation, \" which reapportions and recombines the Light for the con - tinuation of revelatory power. 35 Man, when he is evolved into the Adam Kadmon, can go on to inherit any of the worlds of Light serving the Father. He is an intelligence destined to be more than flesh and blood. However, to go on to inherit the Whole Light bodies, Man must first be able to use this garment of light to serve his fellowman before he can go on to the many different planes within the Father's Hierarchy. 36 In essence, the Father's Hierarchy works through key emis - saries of Light who have proven they can carry on the respon - sibilities of the Kingdom of Light. Among the numerous Orders of Whole Light Beings are found those who work on the \" Right Hand Side \" of the Father's Office of Administration in each Son uni - verse. 37 The Order of the Malachim is one of the Orders of the Lords who supervise the programs of Sovereign Law pertaining to God-Man relationships in every universe. 38 They attune the forces of angelic communication and open the books of God's Law to be read in the higher heavens as the Cos - mic Law. They also reinstate the Law in the lower realms so that man understands why he is a spec - trum that had fallen before this present program. 39 In our present cycle, the re - transmission of the Law was given through Ezra and the \" Men of Faith \" the \" Men of the Great As - sembly, \" who were the \" Watch - men \" of the transmission codes of the Torah Or."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"KEY 303 40-51 40 Another Order of Light is the Order of the Ishim, who assist man to go from the third dimen - sion to the fifth dimension of spiritual growth. They come down into the integral formations of the inner Shekinah worlds to evolve mankind from the lowest molecu- lar forms within the network of the Adamic body. 41 The Ishim help intelligence move through mental - entropy and body - entropy by showing how the soul can enter into envelopes of light moving between minus infin - ity and anti - infinity. 42 These energy envelopes exist in hypernumerical ranges beyond the simple mathematical functions of 43 When the graduated soul exits the body, and is not assigned to return to the Overself body of a Master or Ascended Master, it can enter any number of energy em - bodiments, energy envelopes, it has prepared for, to work with one of the angelic hierarchies operating in the twenty - four dimensions of our Son universe. 44 I was shown how there are energy envelopes of light which float through space, carrying the codes for a given type of soul evolution that is seeded into a par - ticular dimension. I later felt that only hypernumerical packages could account for the flexibility of these energy envelopes which work within the major twenty - four di - mensions of our Son universe to control our soul evolution. 45 When the Shekinah elements of a graduate soul enter one of the envelope soul matrices, the other side of Occam's razor becomes ef - fective (i.e., all possibilities will be tried, for multiple evolution is pos- sible) and the soul evolves, with the help of the Ishim, according to the angelic matrix best suited to work with the programs of crea - tion. 46 The Order of the Elim rep - resents the sustainers of the vibra- tions of sonic energy used in the music of the spheres. The Elim translate the Father's messages into units of sound and color which are used for communication between the networks of the Hosts. 47 The music of the spheres continually weaves the fabric of creation with the thought - forms of the Father. Through the use of di - minishing chord structures, the Elim reactivate sound patterns of creation from one sphere to another. 48 The Elim form a musical mandala and a spontaneous course through the musical universe by unifying the spiritual orders with harmonics on all sides of the Creator Spintus. 49 The Elim merge, pair, and synchronize sound chromatically, bringing together different sound and color factors which combine to express the highest modes of medi - tation. Their cacophony radiates a dimension of freedom from the bonds of human passion. 50 The Elim use spherical musi - cal forms to inspire art, teachings and transformational activities in the realms of creation. 51 The Elim inspire: the love of universal forces; the love of consciousness understanding; the love of at - one - ment with God; the love of at - one - ment with self; the love of spiritual knowl - edge; the love of spiritual Wisdom; the love of divine seed- forms; the love of indwelling Shekinah gifts; and the love of the Infinite Way of the Divine. 52 Through these transforma - tional activities, the Elim show how the basic units of Omega are energy constants which spiral out of the center of zero sound and color into other consciousness time zones. The Elim also recycle the field orbits of color traveling, in each cycle of renewal, from con - sciousness time zone to conscious - ness time zone in a variety of col - ors. 53 The Order of the Hashmalim carry the standards of Justice and the Weights and Measures which judge even the angels. They are the judges of the spiritual planets. It is from their ranks that the Trin- ity Spirits are called to dispatch the original manifestation of the limitless knowledge, the Torah Or of the Ain Soph to the planetary realms of YHWH's Angelic Am - bassadors. 54 These are the weights and measures that allow terrestrial and celestial law to be synthesized for the establishment of interplanetary government. 55 Hence, the special work of the Hashmalim is to tie together the spiritual worlds with the worlds of physical form and to show that they are inseparable through the grids of Light manifes - tation. KEY 303 51 - 61 56 The Hashmalim are unique in that they can connect the trinitized activities of the Three , Great Triple Powers in the expan - sion of the innermost part of the Deity into new creation. 57 Each Triple Power reveals that portion of the Holy Trinity which is manifest in new creation. The Three Great Triple Powers, the basic blueprint for energy change, are the interface for the collective activities of the trinitization of matter - energy. 58 Another Order of Light is the Order of the Seraphim who are princely guardian intelligences, con - trolling the major pictographs monitoring the lower heavens. Through their multiple appear - ances, the Seraphim work with the external prototypes of conscious - ness creation, as well as govern the ranks of light intelligence not allo - cated to the deities. 59 Without receiving the bap - tism of seeing the Shekinah Light from the Seraphim, Man is not able to come out of this world, pass through the lower firmaments and see all the rulers and all lords and all gods and all the great invisibles of his local universe. 60 Their Command governs myriads of interplanetary govern - ments of intelligence that are con - nected with specific consciousness zones. 61 The Seraphim open man's eyes to work with the \" Govern - ment of the Higher Evolution. \" They structure the \" Government of Light \" which is necessary in the merger of different planetary worlds under a unified \" Wisdom. \" This \" Wisdom \" is manifested from the Ancient of Days through the"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"KEY 303 61 - 70 Father, revealed to the newborn creation as the Recent of Days. 62 Of all the Orders of the Host, the Seraphim have been cho - sen to manifest the \" Government of Light \" because they know how to associate the right \" Wisdom \" with the \" right planets \" in accor- dance with the Father's \" Master Plan.'' 63 In the beginning of the phys - ical planes of our local universe, a portion of the Adamic race fell and became \" the inheritors \" of the \" lim - ited space of the Inheritance \" out - side the guardians of the galactic tree. There were others of the Sethian thrice - regenerated, the Enochian thrice - regenerated, and the Methusalian thrice - regenerated seed who were used to upgrade the in - telligence of Man. These were the \" First - Born \" who were in the heavens prior to the creation of this world and who chose to be \" Re - born \" in the spiritual body upon the earth in order to help in re - generating man back into a body of Light so that he could return to the family of the heavens. 64 When this thrice - regenerated power was taken from the face of the earth, the Seraphim were commissioned to insure the con - tinuation of the work of Seth, Enoch and Methuselah. Just as these three were taken into time translation, into the higher heavens, 65 the Seraphim lifted the ark of Noah and his seed into the heavens and then returned it safely to this planet so that the Kingdom of God could begin again. 66 Thus, the work of the Seraphim is to protect the Hokh m ah, the Wisdom, and the holy seed, by summoning forth the proper ark, and seeing to the readaptation of life upon the land during all Noah - like deliverances where the intervention of higher intelligence is necessary. 67 The Order of the Erelim maintain the \" Covenant of Light \" between the Throne and centers of Higher Intelligence. They contin - ually adjust the center of light with respect to the evolving or - ders of Higher Intelligence that must be periodically drawn to - gether as the worlds of physical form change with respect to new plans of creation. 68 They also judge the effec - tiveness of technology, monitoring and ordering civilizations that have not yet found their spiritual iden - tity. It is from their ranks that the Adjusters are chosen to determine the sequences necessary for the lower evolution and the Higher Evolution to meet and mu - tate as a joint spirited creation. 69 Through their consciousness controls they can rescue inter- dimensional physical intelligence that has accidentally materialized in the wrong time zone, in the wrong dimension of Light, etc. They res - cue intelligence through their pow - ers of dematerialization penetrating the matter - energy veils of light. 70 The Ophanim are the mes- sengers of Light from the higher heavens of the Father, uniquely placed at the crossroads of space, as the network for governing and implanting \" new realization. \" When the prophets of the ancient civilizations made contact with the higher worlds, invariably the con - tact was made through the Ophanim messengers of Light. The Ophanim carefully select individu - als in each of the planetary societies who have the ability of prophethood and carry the under- standing of the higher creation. 71 They supervise the crucial aspects of growth within the hierarchical ranks of the heavens and protect the higher teachings from falling into the hands of the lesser forces of Light, and from the rebellious brotherhoods, who do not serve the Father's Hierarchy of Light. 72 Therefore, the Ophanim guide the thought - forms from the Father's Thrones and Dominions into proper levels of instruction. 73 There is also a distinct aspect of the Ophanim's work which is synonymous with \"Wheels- within - Wheels \" - the appearance force of the Merkabah as it comes into physical manifestation. The Ophanim are closely identified with the Merkabah which is used to an - nounce the Cosmic Law of YHWH and bring a scripture to the lower planetary worlds. 74 The Ophanim also make the Merkabah available to the other Orders of Higher Intelligence so as to carry out specific functions: to guide men to the knowl - edge of the Infinite Way; to minister to disembodied entities on the physical and spiritual planets; to protect man from belief systems which are incon - sistent with the Love and Light of the Cosmic Law; to guard mankind from the extraterrestrial intelli - gences that would radi - cally change the balance and flow design between KEY 303.70-78 kingdoms of creation; and to regenerate and resurrect the faithful remnant of a \" seed creation \" when the powers of Michael and Christ converge to bring one design of creation into the \" new heavens \" of YHWH. 75 There are several Orders of Ophanim extending from the Higher Evolutionary Orders to the Princely Ophanim who dispatch the Mid - Way programmers to gov - ern the lower heavens. 76 There are also special Orders of Ophanim who command the 'Deca - Delta' manifestations to target interplanetary grids. These are Ophanim who can work with the limitations on the edge of a Mansion World. 77 All Ophanim use the Light of Metatron and the Order of Mel- chizedek to refurbish the planetary worlds with the right type of Light, in transit from \" Mansion World \" to \" Mansion World, \" through quan - tized spiritual evolution. 78 The Order of the Cherubim emissaries of Light is the angelic Order of higher intelligence which functions as the keeper of the ce - lestial documents. They are also capable of appearing on the earth plane to direct the affairs of man. However, their primary function is to guard the Throne and Dominion passages of Light which connect the physical worlds with the gov - ernments of the Mid - Heavens. The Mid - Heavens are the lesser \" Light manifestations \" out of which the physical beings on the planetary worlds first learn to experience the Ineffable."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"KEY 303 79 - 88 79 The purpose of the Cherubim is to create a wall of Light protection around the 'specific Plan' being used to con - nect worlds of generation and re- generation. They insure that the thought-forms of the Masters and Ascended Masters are \" perfectly consistent \" with the Father's Plan in perfecting the number of souls destined to share in a creative Plan. 80 In order to create the \" walls of Light, \" the Cherubim must re - ceive the Living Light from the Throne. The Living Light is taken by Uriel and Metatron and made available to the Cherubim Orders, in the alignment of new worlds through an energy trunk system which connects the \" sparks \" of the Father universe with the star sys - tems which comprise the evolving Son universe. 81 Hence, through their creative activity, the Cherubim supervise the creative affinities between the worlds of Briah, the worlds of crea - tion, from the worlds of Atn'oth, the worlds of archetypal form. From this blueprint of \" archetypal form, \" the Cherubim engineer new creations on different levels of Light. 82 The Order of the Cherubim uses the Living Light of the Father to connect the worlds of creation with the worlds of Light in the ac - tivity of the worlds of Yetzirah, the worlds of continuity and change within the Father's Continuum of Light. A new world receives its \" Plan \" from the Father's Con - tinuum through a thought - form corpus of Living Light shells. 83 This transforming Light is spoken of in the scriptures of Ezra which proclaim: 84 \" Thou, 0 Light, shinest be - fore the light of the morning upon thy creatures, And in thy heavenly dwell - ing places there is no need of any other light. \" 85 This speaks of the unbroken divine Light which comes down to the lowest form of creation, sup - porting even the lowest creatures, yet being still connected within the highest region of the heavens. 86 The soul without Light is helpless; only those souls who have awakened to a divine Plan and have sought the Love and Light of the Divine Mind are given the opportunity to connect with the Christed \" fountain of Light \" sent through the portals of creation to enlighten the worlds supervised by the Cherubim. Thus, the Messiah is sent to prepare a place of glory for his people who will see the tre - mendous energies of Light and Love given for the sanctification of life. 87 And, at the time of the glorification of creation, the Cherubim open the energy portals of creation so that intelligent life ascends beyond the violent, en- tropic fire into the proper chamber - of - Light within the Trea - sury of Light. They help the faith - ful change into the garments of Light that they will wear in new \" Mansion worlds\" of Light. 88 The Order of the B'nai Elohim are Sons of the Creator Gods who are commissioned to dispatch a share of the \" Treasury of Light \" for the Wisdom and edu - cation of souls. They are the cre - ative instruments for the Elohim who commission the B'nai Elohistic programs so that the creations will continue into the greater light. 89 The B'nai Elohim work with the derivative systems of creation. They evolve the \" lesser garments \" of the Adam Kadmon that are not directly used by the Elohim in the creation of the physical intelli- gences that serve YHWH. 90 The B'nai Elohim make use of the \" Eye of Horus \" to create the garments of physical embodiment which the angelic beings of intelli - gence may choose from when they come into the lower Heavens to do the work of the Father. 91 Thus, the B'nai Elohim con - solidate the work of the Elohim. They choose the \" selected seed \" which is transplanted from imper - fect creation to the levels of the di - vine invisibles. Hence, they enlarge the spiritual gene pool for the eventual pairing of divine radia - tions into new specie creation. 92 The Order of the Elohim comprises the Creator Gods of YHWH who control the calibra- tions of Light that are necessary to evolve all of the combinations of the Image and Similitude through the divine Eye of the Father. 93 They govern the progeny of the \" Image \" and \" Similitude \" used by the Divine Father in the higher Paradise Creations.

They are able to create entire galactic realms directly through the Light radiations of YHWH. 97 Out of their greater power, they guide the ascent of the Adam Kadmon into new Omega programs where the Adam Kadmon can take on any one of the higher embodi - ments of the Father's Hierarchy, even becoming a \" Prince of Light. \" 98 The Adam Kadmon can, in turn, use divine power to project himself through the 'Eye of Horus,' so that he can inherit the physical worlds of form.

In projecting a \" Light Body form \" through the 'Eye of Horus,' a physical form is materialized for the 'heavenly coun - terpart. 99 However, it is the Hyos Ha Kaidesh who break the barrier of the Infinite.

Since this re - lationship unfolds from futures of the Trinity, the Hierarchy does not know the ultimate results of the 'trinitized relationships \" between each Ascended Master and the Father - Holy Spirit Shekinah part - nership, as each Master is called upon to be a \" Christ Paradise Son f '. 103 This mysterious unity of each Ascended Master and Lord with the full glory of the Trinity of Trinities, insures cooperative ex - periencing of new worlds with even greater \" enlightenment \" than that of the Lord who has experi - enced the equivalent of the three bodies of the Buddha, where the Buddha is conscious of Dharmakaya ( \" everlastingness \" ), Sam bhogakaya (instruction from the \" Sons of Heaven \" ), and Nirmanakaya (the work that is necessary for the \" re - demp tion of mankind \" ). 104 Each Ascended Master from the ranks of the Hyos Ha Koidesh, who has won the Triple Crown of the Father's Love by being a \" Christed Lord, King, and Re - deemer, \" will: pioneer the expand - ing creative frontier as it continues to push outward into the deeper uncharted space; live for the re - demption of mankind and all or - ders of intelligence; and seek to liberate fallen \" gods \" and \" lords \" trapped in their own domains of creative thought so that universal creations are possible on the Son- ship level within the open - ended sovereignty of YHWH. 105 Since the external creative power of each Father manifestation of the Ancient of Days is infinite, growth is unending - eternal. Since this growth is unending, it can never be completed save \" within the Will of the Father \" who estab - lishes Supreme - Ultimate Wisdom in relation to each of His Plans and Programs shared with His Paradise Sons, His Elders of the Throne, and His Deity Shekinah manifesta - tions which are all allowed to com - bine and recombine with Him as an existential Trinity serving the Trinity of Trinities - the Father, the Only Begotten Christ, and Holy Spirit Shekinah in the Father uni - verse. 106 On the highest level of the administration of a Father universe are the Twenty - Four Elders who sit in the presence of YHWH exchang - ing their commissions and glory periodically with other Ascended Masters. They control twenty - four Thrones and dominions which administer the Law of Central Control through Councils of Light to all universes which recognize YHWH. 107 The Twenty - Four Elders have the power to convulse a hundred and forty - four systems of godhood, walk over a hundred and forty - four thousand realms of lord - ship, and illuminate a hundred and forty - four thousand world spheres. They can bring myriads of beings into spiritual maturity, live in many eternal expressions, and know how the Cosmic Law is dispensed in each aeon. 108 The Twenty - Four Elders un - fold the glory of the Godhead, as received from the Ancient-Recent- Future of Days in existential Deities, whereby they can exist as \" trinities 7 ' of the Trinity of Trinities. Under the direction of YHWH as Father - Creator, they can also appear simultaneously in infi - nite forms. They give full expres - sion to the quantity of Divine ex - pression whether the Father's Plan includes a billion worlds or is cir - cumscribed to a dimension as a model for His unique expression of a divine program. 109 By combining the intention of the Father's Plan with the exten - sion of the Holy Spirit Shekinah, they can produce myriad universes, undiminished as to meta - material perfection, and precisely sub- infinite as to quantity, size and radiance of the heaven or \" master universe of glory \" which serves the nature of a Living and Revealing God breathing the Ain Soph eternally! 110 The Twenty - Four Elders behold all seventy - two faces of the Father unfolding into the infinite manifestations of the Father in glorified bodies of Light. Each Elder has the capacity to create multiple civilizations serving one of the manifestations of the Father, as KEY 303.107-215 the Father's garment of Light ex - pands as a trinitized form. Christ Jesus demonstrated how the Elohim, the Hyos Ha Koidesh, and the Twenty - Four El - ders, as a divine apotheosis, could be directly involved in the work of trinitization between the Throne of the Father and the worlds of physi - cal form. 112 In this divine apotheosis, Jesus demonstrated how the Christ power of the Throne could be made directly available to every son and daughter of God through peti - tioning the Father for LIFE and re - lease from the cycle of beginning and end, so that every soul could have life more abundantly in the radiance of the Father. 113 Thus, in the family of God, it is not the distinguishing level of being \" of \" the Elohim, the Hyos Ha Koidesh, and the Twenty - Four Elders that is important, but the combination of the Trinity that links the Transcendent with the rel - ative, allowing for infinite interplay between the eternal and changeless aspects of the Supreme Deity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit Shekinah. 114 And after I had seen a glimpse of the Hierarchy of this Father universe, the Lord Metatron seized my hand and brought my body out of the Paradise of God's vision and said: 115 \" He will cause the right - eous to build the house of God and command the in - spired to establish the tem - ple of Ezekiel.

THE \" HIGHER EVOLUTION\" WILL GIVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW ELECTRIC FORCES ALTER BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS AND WILL ALLOW MAN IN THIS CONSCIOUSNESS TIME ZONE TO RECEIVE \" WHOLE LIGHT BEINGS \" WHO WILL GIVE INSTRUCTION OF THE NEXT ORDERING OF EVOLUTION IN OUR UNIVERSE. 1 The key speaks of how the Earth's specie has a direct light arc, a direct light focus which controls its biological rhythms. Man will soon learn that his life system is not directly dependent upon the solar magnetic field paradigm to regenerate his biological rhythms. 2 A new source of Light is now reaching our solar system and in - terpenetrating Earth's magnetic field, altering the biological rhythms. This is forcing the specie to leave behind its old time - cell of perception on the physical, emo - tional, mental, and spiritual levels. 3 This must take place before the specie can go into a new time- cell of consciousness with a unified perception. 4 As the arcs of light begin to change, a different light force is beginning to work with the elec - tromagnetic forces. This is causing the magnetic fields of the brain cav - ity to be suifficiently raised to a higher mental frequency, allowing Man to receive \" Whole Light Be - ings \" who will give instruction as to the program of the next level of creation. 5 It has previously been thought that the light forces of the Earth's magnetic field control the rhythms of life of all biological species, and living cells need only the light of our own portion of the electromagnetic spectrum to sur - vive. 6 The key tells us, however, that without new Magnetic paradigms working with multiple arcs of color, the color radiations of the sun's light will not be sufficient for the survival of the species. 7 We will, therefore, begin to work with more of the complete spectrum. The major color factor, however, will be the \" warm white'' color coding which will enable us to integrate with our original form sent from the higher universe to this world. 8 Thus, having the brain of an electromagnetic computer, we will be forced to adapt to an enlarged"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"KEY 304.8-18 electromagnetic spectrum, or spin out of the old electromagnetic spiral into consciousness death if we cannot code into the new colors when we cross our Alpha and Omega light spectrum. 9 The new electromagnetic fre - quency is an astrobiologicaI threshold by itself, and yet at - tached to a plurality of other as - trobiological thresholds of many suns, creates a \" Covenant of the Living Light-Mitszvahs 'Esh,\" which is the integration of the many color thresholds of Light. 10 Accordingly, we will go beyond this present threshold where we have been kept by the old solar paradigm of Power, within a \" common light \" covenant of only one sun. 11 Our sun , by virtue of being a variable star, will be seen as hav - ing great limitations for future evoIutions. This will be observable by a visible exchange of the solar polarity fields and by the magnetic mapping of inner - solar magnetic lines rotating faster than the sur - face of the sun. 12 These changes will also affect the rotation of Saturn. This will be seen as a periodic effect which will be noticed in the activity of Saturn's rings. It will illustrate new changes that will take place throughout the entirety of the solar system. 13 These changes are the result of new biological light controls being directly introduced by the new administrative order in con - junction with the Council of Nine. These changes are necessary to prepare our human evolution to overlap with \" Whole Light Beings r i of advanced creation in the evolv - ing of new astro - mutations. 14 New astro - mutations will take place where new magnetic lines bring about the balances in the energy coupling from a proton - electron - proton grid to an electron - proton - electron grid. Here, the bioenergy field of the body in - herits a new electron and positron pair and the blood circulatory sys - tem inherits new magnetic lines of force. 15 The ionized field around the blood cell loses its proton - electron - proton relationship to a new electron - proton - electron field as the Iife form is moved into the next phase of the electromagnetic spectrum. The former proton orien - tation is dropped and a new re - combination process results. 16 In other words, molecular density levels work with certain frequencies of Light radiation and when the light source is changed in this manner, the molecular density level is changed to reveal the next electron orbital level of the Univer - sal Mind. 17 In other words, man will be able to participate in higher evolutionary worlds because his hemoglobin chain will shift with his phylogenetic tree to a new sys - tem of balance whereby singular, group, and vacuum ultraviolet waves will combine to allow for a quantum relocation. The combina - tion of these three types of waves will allow the organic form of Iife to pass through the old molecular density into a new molecular den - sity as a \" holistic system.'' 18 The change of the phylogenetic tree will allow for tremendous restructuring of the blood circulatory system. As part of this overall change, the alpha and delta chains will allow for a unique coupling, whereby the beta chain will be eliminated through quan - tized changes. 19 Presently r the two alpha and the two delta chains bind with ox - ygen better than the two alpha and the two beta. Therefore, in the quantum change of the human evolution, the beta chain will be eliminated and the delta will be - come the penultimate. 20 In order for man to work with the next electron orbital level of the Universal Mind, our molecu - lar density level will have to be - come less dense and grow more transparent in order to participate in multidimensional realities. 21 Man must be completely re - made anew by going through the energy grids that control his pre - sent biological arrangement so that he can be respatialized into new grids of attunement. Specifically, man must go through the energy grid controlling cell division on his biological level of organization, a planetary biomagnetic grid control - ling the collective specie evolution, and his solar paradigm (grid) re - ceiving galactic energies from the worlds of negative mass. 22 When man goes through these energy grids, he will activate the new magnetic fields and dis - place his old planetary biorhythms. 23 First, the lateral displacement of the solar particles (in relation - ship to our galactic disk), creating time - lapse cosmodistics, will be corrected allowing the historical time line of motion to be har - monized with the spiritual grid of infinite patterns that we are to be aligned with. KEY 304.18-31 24 Then, ultraviolet light sen - sitivity will have a special repro - gramming function with our DNA. It will establish a recombination of the elements of the life chemistry. 25 Contrary to what present day geneticists feel, the ultraviolet radiation will be controlled and will not destroy the sensitive genetic code. 26 It has already been postu - lated that ultraviolet radiation, when applied to the DNA at specific intensities, causes thymine to dimerize. 27 This causes the hydrogen double bonds to break and create a cyclobutane ring between the di - mers. 28 In consequence, a bulge arises which does not allow the DNA to bind or transcribe; it causes the DNA to become unrec - ognized to the preliminaries (of its basic activity). 29 Howeverr it has also been found that a photoreactive enzyme plus one photon of visible light breaks this bulge and allows for the proper coding to take place. 30 This recombination model is necessary in the development of a replication model which is the key to the arrangement of genes on chromosomes for the control of biological aging and degenerate changes during our specie evolu - tion. 31 And before the larger elec - tromagnetic change happens, man will also understand how new growth effects will be the result of electromedicine which uses elec - tromagnetism.

In other words, the child which is being carried in spatial environments can be preprogram- med while in the embryonic state to be prepared for special planetary environments. 36 This is done in the event that a transfer of the species to a new environment is necessary for the survival of the race. (Here, the guiding intelligence is well aware that the child can make genetic changes.) 37 In addition, when we can travel beyond the upper limits of this present electromagnetic spec - trum we will understand how our electromagnetic density controls the spin charge of the amino acid pat - terns of our present life evolution. 38 And this is why our elec - tromagnetic stage of evolution will itself be changed to allow for new patterns of ongoing evolution. 39 Merkabah mechanisms give the cue for the timing of biological change by the Earth's magnetic cy - cles. These changes can take place in a matter of hours and remove whole species that have evolved in a geological time frame. 40 The evidence for this can be revealed in the correlation between field reversals and discontinuities of micro - fauna and deep - sea sediment cores. 41 The Bereskova mammoths in Siberia establish the existence of \" heat sinks \" which must have oc - curred in order to perfectly pre - serve their molecular structure. These heat sinks are necessary to account for a perfect state of pres - ervation and could only have oc - curred as a result of very rapid changes, whereby the mammoths were quickly buried under tons of ice and tundra. 42 This process of rapid extinc - tion extends even to the smallest one - celled marine animal life (i.e., several forms of radiolaria) which became extinct simultaneously throughout the world. 43 Thus, man must face the fact that magnetic field reversal, con - tributing to the rise and fall of species and civilizations, can occur very rapidly as a result of trigger - ing events set in motion by cosmic oscillations in combination with the Earth's magnetic field. 44 However, Enoch explained to me that there are still living species that survive) even in the polar areas, because the geomagnetic change is not a question of advanc - ing and retreating ice) but the relo - cation of the entirety of the Earth's mantle along a new magnetic meridian. 45 In the process of the energy buildup leading to these events, Enoch said, all large scale changes in the magnetic fields arise out of mechanical motions of a conducting medium which involves mag- netohydrodynamic activity. 46 The Earth's core, composed mostly of molten iron, conducts electric currents which amplify ac - companying magnetic fields when energy wave bombardment pours in through the polar areas of the Earth. 47 Excessive cosmic wave bom - bardment transforms the iron core into a liquid plastic - like field which disrupts the state of energy equilib - rium within the core of the Earth. 48 These unique energy trans - formations are the cause of some of the larger magnetic reversals throughout the galaxy. 49 These massive cosmic wave bombardments are caused by changes in the vibration rate of star grids in relationship to fundamental periods of activities within the Milky Way. 50 Furthermore, the transforma - tion of the Earth's core into a liquid plastic - like field causes the core dynamo to act like an inner lubri - cant. This allows the sheil of the planet to slide when the proper torque forces on the shell of the Earth are thrown into geomagnetic reversal. KEY 304.44-55 51 Our planet is no different than any other form of life that must renew itself; it is like an \" energy molecule \" going through renewal and being restored to a new existence. 52 We must understand that the geomagnetic reversals and the changing of the electromagnetic density are necessary parts of the recycling of human biochemical processes, as humanity passes into a new body of Light. In all of these fundamental changes, however, we must understand that there is no fixed \" time scale \" in these changes from the standpoint of a singular relativity. The time factor is deter - mined by a sliding criteria of events on a galactic and planetary scale matched with the spiritual ac - tivity of a Son universe directing the blueprint of \" causal fertility. \" 53 Between the periodical time- scales of cosmic renewal, Man emerges on the scene as an intel - ligence which survives by being a part of the Father's plan of ongoing soul creation. 54 Is Man thus to await the total destruction of the planet? God forbid.

It is the vibration of the Holy Spirit which empowers all living intelli - gence of God providing them with a form of salvation. 2 This is the salutation of the higher Brotherhoods who work col - lectively as the Host Energies of YHWH. The salutation is a witness to all, in the lower heavens, that the Hosts of YHWH work collec - tively as an army of Light, serving the heavenly bodies and those worlds which will be raised up in incorruption. 3 When I was taken into the presence of the Throne, I beheld the multitudes of Ascended beings singing praises to God. And I joined and said, \" You are worthy Father to receive the glory, the honor, and the power because you have created all things and re - deemed me to sing of your Infinite Creation. \" 4 And as I said this I joined the Hosts proclaiming: \" Holy, Holy, 'Tsebayoth (=Sabayoth). Holy is the Lord God of Hosts, the Almighty Father, who was and who is and who will forever be! \" 5 This praise was most pro - found, for when I was returned to Earth and read John's words of Re - velation 4:8-11, I knew John's words to be a true witness to the Father's Presence. 6 Beloved in the Father, under - stand that when the four living creatures, who are the source of creative substance for the lower worlds, proclaim Holiness to YHWH in the words of \"Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tsebayoth, \" they are proclaiming that the power of creation is inextricably bound up with this sacred sound used in the divination of new worlds. 7 The \" Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tsebayoth \" is the measure of the cycle and the beat of all states of matter/radiation, and most of all - resonance, which is the com - mon factor uniting the lower vi - bratory levels with the higher levels of creation. 8 Even the human heart beat, with its biological clocks, is set ac - cording to the function of \" Kodoish,"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"KEY 305 8 - 18 Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tsebayoth! \" 9 The Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tsebayoth \" ties together all biorhythms of the body with the spiritual rhythms of the Overself body, so that all circulatory systems operate with one cosmic heart beat. The \" Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tsebayoth \" is given within the fifth socket of the Great Pyra - mid which aligns the heart vibra - tory beat with the five bodies of vi - bration operating within the bio - chemical shell of man. 10 Furthermore, it is the Light energy created by this \" holy code \" that enables the body vehicle to experience the direct energy of the Masters of Light serving YHWH. This energy exchange is important to the higher needs of the human incarnation because it proceeds from the code which is uttered by the four living creatures who estab - lish the ground structure for all matter created from the divine sub - stance. 11 They use this code to con - nect their mind with the Mind of the Father which allows them to re - joice in the Wisdom transplanted into the mind of creation. 12 These four living creatures are the ones who compose the matter - wave functions by combin - ing divine sounds with the meta- material elements extended from the Throne into physical creation. 13 Therefore, the \"Kodo i sh, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tsebayoth \" is the central measure for the ten octaves contained within the elec - tromagnetic lines of force, as well as additional scales of color reso - nance emanating eighty octaves above and eighty octaves below our place in the electromagnetic spec - trum. 14 The cosmic sound and its re - lationship to the color spectrum di - vides these additional octaves of sound beyond the normal octave range. And just as every sub - atomic particle has its own unique color vibration, these color vibra - tions can be separated so as to re - lease new musical tones. 15 These octaves are activated by the Hebrew divine letters which are, in turn, activated by their own grid which is called into being by Adonai 'Tsebayoth. These letters are thought - forms creating an eter - nal link between the different worlds of time. 16 Each utterance of a \" thought - form \" leads to the seed - form which represents the complex nature of the basic energies of the life forces. The \" thought - form \" has a basic sound - power which is the equivalent of light operating in rel - ative patterns and duration of pitch. 17 Thus, the basic combination of the divine letter grid with all biliteral couplings, results in 484 combinations of \" light to sound \" = 484) or sound - power man - ifestations. 18 Kaballists know that by ar - ranging all the triliteral combina - tions formed from the 22 fire let - ters, the \" sound seed - forms \" will total or 10,648. With more un - derstanding, light and sound can be brought together through addi - tions of score tables at the begin - ning or end of the 484 biliteral combinations so that the Wisdom behind each seed - form is aug - mented. 19 Therefore, the power of the basic twenty - two letters is: 484 = 10,648 = 234,256 = 5,153,632 = 113,379,904 = 2,494,357,888 = 54,875,873,536 = 1,207,269,217,792 = 26,559,922,791,424 = 584,318,301,411,328 = 12,855,002,631,049,216 = 20 This tabernacle of seed - syllables is sufficient to represent the \" songs of ascent, \" so that the soul of the human can find itself on every level of experience and in the changing of the \" garment of Light \" as it ascends from the world of vibration to the world of Light. 21 The question arises: Why has the Hebrew language been selected to control even the sub - atomic par - ticles and to activate the spirituality of Man? 22 Enoch told me this \" sacred language i ' was used because it was not primarily a language of words, letters, or pronunciation, but the thoughts of God emanating as flame projections. 23 These thought projections of flame carry a unique sound that is in resonance with the Throne. And these sound and thought projec - tions are also used in the highest worlds of Light not only as a source of communication, but of creation. 24 These flame projections are used to evolve creation because they can seed ideas into conscious - ness which can be maintained for extremely long periods of time. In other words, these light geometries have \" eternal \" endurance. 25 With knowledge of this Di- KEY 305 19 - 30 vine Language, the Hosts directly imprint on new creation, the image of the Father's Mind. This provides for morphological resonance in the structure of creation going through the embryonic stage. 26 And the \" Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tsebayoth \" is the central vibration coordinating all other vibrations with the spiritual vehicle of Man. 27 However, for thousands of years man has been saying this sacred mantra with no recognizable augmentation of Wisdom, save the few that were divinely selected to show how the greater creative gifts of the Hosts of Light could be di - rectly projected through the body. 28 At this time, through the great dispensation that God has promised at the end of this time period, the \" Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tsebayoth \" will be - come the key to the transformation of Man. For through God's dis - pensation, the Christ Overself body will be quickened into direct work with the physical body. 29 Mankind will collectively ex - perience the speaking in tongues and the sounding of melodious communication as occurred to the disciples at Pentecost, when our kether template is opened to the vibrations of heaven passing over the face of the earth. 30 And, while I was in the midst of the Great Throne of His Glory, the Lord showed those in His Presence, how His Love was to pour forth to those throughout all worlds of Light.

This celestial music is churned by a vast array of colors which are over the heads of the Hierarchical assembly, in the presence of the swirling Ain Soph. 33 To hear these musical notes is to experience an entire sym - phony of Light. It would be as if earthling man would hear a very low frequency sound (.01-4 Hz) and feel as if he were a musical note traveling through space with - out any boundaries. 34 Yes, so great is this Glory that even the Hosts of the Throne take turns in departing for new - born worlds where they bring the Father's Wisdom to map anew the victories of the Spirit. 35 The Hosts bring with them the \" Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tsebayoth\" as the cosmic vibration which they extend collec - tively to all creation to stimulate the process of growth, and allow matter to feel directly the stimulus of Divine Love. 36 No other song in the heavens can directly manifest Di - vine Love so powerfully to the elemental forms of creation, than this divine mantra of the Father's Throne. For all language and musi - cal patterns of man are carved out of this vibration of the Godhead. 37 Thus, the \" Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tsebayoth\" creates the mental, spiritual time warps within your body which allows you to grow from a small microcosm into the next level of Godhead. 38 The thought - forms coming through this time warp remake your genetic inputs in order to manifest life - continuum and trans - form your Adamic form into the next form of godliness of the Adam Kadmon. Here, the thought - forms allow the seed crystal of cell divi - sion to remake life into the next level of Godhood. 39 And the crystals of the heavens vibrate, and all manner of creation vibrates with this Holy Mantra. Therefore, let the planetary gardens rejoice and all that is therein; let the elements sing to YHWH because He has given each joyous cosmology its Shemot. 0 give thanks unto the Lord; for He is good; for His mercy endureth forever. 40 And when I was taken from the Merkabah of Enoch into the Throne by Metatron's Body of Light, I confessed with the brothers and sisters of Light: \" Blessed is the Lord in His words; Yes, blessed by the mouth of everything that breathes. His greatness and good - ness fill the universe; knowledge and understanding surround Him. 41 \" He is exalted above the Hyos Ha Koidesh, and is adorned in glory above the chariot. Glory and honor belong unto His Name forever.

The salutation sets in motion a resonance pattern with the Throne of the Father which the \" negative forces \" cannot use when greeted with this salutation. In fact, this salutation is so strong that the 'negative forces \" cannot remain for any length of time in the presence of its vibration. 43 Hence, the negative forces are exposed and can be destroyed by the higher heavenly brother - hoods if they do not respect this code of the heavenly illuminaries. 44 The Brotherhoods who use the \"Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai Tesbayoth\" come directly from the Throne to work in regions where the Masters from these re - gions have failed to dislodge the fallen hierarchies. 45 When working with the harmonics of the speed of Light, the Holy Mantra activates special grids of resonance attunement, so that the coupling of energy flowing through the body is placed in sym - pathetic resonance with the Brotherhood. This allows energy grids to be brought together for mutual work and worship. 46 Along with this communica- tion device of \"Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tesbayoth, used for salutations with the Brotherhood, I KEY 305: 42 - 51 red greeting for the sending and receiving of spiritual instruction. 47 The pattern of 6 - 6 - 6* is used to , identify you with respect to the Earth's vibration.

This light code structure does not dissipate but continues to be d in the form of a unique light s ectrum which gives the overall harmony of the light as it is pul - sated to be in the restoration of life itself, in the reprogramming of it - self, in the reassembly of its meta - material information. 6 For those who do not have an"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"KEY 306 6 - 16 Overself coordinating body of Light, Metatron explained to me that there is a light grid within the body which registers all units of biological - electrical radiation at low frequency field levels. Just as a voice structure or voice profile can be used to identify an image body of consciousness, so also the com - bination of thought waves with color can be used to identify the vibratory waves of Gematrian thought. 7 Thus, every molecule within the body continually projects light pulses which build up a light code structure which is beyond the physical relativity. This code struc - ture is used to reshape the next program of consciousness evolu - tion. 8 Every biochemical molecule must radiate and pulsate again and again as the body of flesh is pul - sated into new envelopes of Light. 9 Our envelope of Light pro - grams all of the light forces for the human DNA - RNA. However, each envelope of Light is equipped with the energy necessary to progress into other cycles of creation. 10 Our Light envelope is shaped by the world of negative mass and is a unique envelope for a given electromagnetic spectrum. 11 We are formed out of thoughts which feel the weight of space and time into which \" being \" is cast. (These thoughts give you your own unique space and time in the drama of incarnation.) 12 Beloved, we should recog - nize that 'there are three types of evolution that can be coded out of the activity of the \" Living Light \" during the transition of the physi - cal form. 13 These three types are: (1) physical man which can be coded from the meta - functions of his exis - tence purely into another physical man on the same scale of meta- matter (positive incarnation); (2) physical man possessing the light grid of an evolving soul which can be coded from the \" Life of the Liv - ing \" into a more advanced spiritual - physical embodiment within the lower heavens - such a man is a \" light blueprint \" of a given Creator God's image and similitude; and (3) spiritual - physical man possessing a complete unity with the spiritual Shekinah ex - tended out of the \" Life of the Liv - ing \" which is capable of direct res - urrection into the Adam Kadmon archetypal \" body of Light. \" He has, by virtue of completing his spiritual assignment, the prerogative to par - ticipate in the higher heavens which work directly with the Father's Image and Similitude. 14 Therefore, the Higher Evolu - tion by matching the light codes with physical codes control the sphere of activity of a biological specie within given spectrum am - plifications. The spectrum am - plifications allow the Light en - velope to make other adaptions to recode the human genetic code into a new phase of life intelligence. 15 Spiritual mankind is re - moved from the Koine (common) life codes by the Higher Evolution which uses the Father's Nartoomid to call forth humanity into a state of resurrection. 16 Those who have radiated love into the 'Light of the Living,' into the greater universe, will con - tinue to live off the power of the 'Image of the Luminaries' because they have learned to share the pul - sations of Love within continuity and change. 17 Those who do not pulsate love into the greater image which establishes continuity and change within continuum deny the 'Redemptive Light i and the order of progression which exists in myriad thresholds, connecting the 'Love of the Living' with life beyond the measure of the flesh. Those who deny the Light will re - turn to their consciousness begin - ning in the form of flesh (or even lower forms of meta - matter) for the flesh is not able to be transformed into the 'Light of the Living.' 18 In other words, at the end of an evolutionary program, if the genetic code of an individual soul is not deemed worthy for the next step function of specie regeneration \" into the Light, \" the soul is placed one or several biological step func - tions back, where it must learn through its negative karma how to harmonize with Light and Love. 19 Thus, we are told the Omega - minus function gives forth a new beginning, a new Alpha and Omega of a new stage of life in the House of Many Mansions. Yet, in order to reassemble a greater life structure there has to exist a great - er body of Light consciousness in - telligence which is a part of the \" Life of the Living. \" 20 In essence, you exist in \" consciousness death \" until you are aware of the power of Love which opens up the visual pathway of ascension into indescribable levels of Light essence. Every ac - tion in life is part of the matter- energy centrifuge which builds up the consciousness energy units to be sufficiently strong enough to res - urrect the dust of life into new wave factors of light. KEY 306 16 - 26 21 A denial of this energy cen - trifuge means that the vortex spiral and reticulated spiral of the epi- kinetic units remain without the spiritual light coding. Therefore, the light of the unrealized self sim - ply dissipates into particles of light charges which degenerate and be - come the basic energy combinations which are used to evolve new be - ings. 22 The unused \" light con - sciousness \" is often given to a crippled person or a fatherless child in some other life frame who will use this energy wisely. 23 Drawing on consciousness light, you create your own Gemat- rian body of light to connect with the wave function of the Zohar Light which allows your outer garment to survive this life and death cycle of physical creation. 24 Whosoever does not seek 'the Light' will remain an open vessel for the Masters of the angelic 'Fall' who require the collec - tive energies of evolving specie forms. 25 In aeons previous to this age, the fallen Masters and Princes of Light did not wish to acknowledge the sovereign grace of the Adam Kadmon in our 'Father universe.' Therefore, they conspired to sepa - rate the divine image from the similitude of divine light invisibles. 26 This took place while the dam Kadmon was within the idst of the many galactic trees of our Father universe. There, the angels and archangels of the Fall sought to limit the immeasureable greatness that would share their power in using the \" creative Light stream \" to move regions of chaos into regions of new creation."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"KEY 306 27 - 37 27 They desired to keep form in the immeasureable distances in re - gard to their own height above and the depth below and the length and the breadth of their domains. Thus, they manipulated the em - bryonic form of intelligence for they conspired that they would not allow it to attain unto levels of \" di - vine Knowledge. 28 In order to accomplish this the fallen Masters opened the biostratus in the heavens and sepa - rated the image from the similitude. This allowed the fallen Nephilim angelic forms to confuse the identity patterns of lower cre - ation. 29 They also poured out an in - ferior feeling of \" below conscious - ness \" into Adamic physicals S O as to seal off their spiritual fate and prevent their evolution from con - necting with the necessary stages of spiritual evolution needed to be one with the glorious Adam Kad- mon. This \"bottom-below inferior consciousness \" was meant to pro - mote false states of pseudo - divinity and salvation by working as a mes - sage of \" mental liberation'' be - stowed by a Master, so that soul evolution would be kept on the Master's level. 30 Therefore, karmic cycles were set in motion for certain forms of creation that were con - taminated and needlessly precon - ditioned by continual material form. 31 Moreover, this spiritual in - feriority prevented the development of spiritual discrimination S O that souls could not select the proper portion of physical - spiritual unity necessary to find the Supreme Way* 32 Therefore, the physical man - ifestations of the Adam Kadmon in the form of Adamic physicals were prevented from realizing their di - vine Overself. They did not realize that the physical progression was not completely closed off to the di - rect remodeling of life from the higher planes of creation. 33 Some of the fallen Masters became gods, taking the serpent sea1 of authority and, therefore, limited their creation to their form of galactic models which could not admit the presence of the 'Divine Logos.' 34 These Masters or 'Satans' were numerous and until the pres - ent time, prevented Light energy from recycling their lower physical worlds which would have allowed their worlds to progress into pro- grams designed for the Adam Kadmon. Thus, even the knowl- edge of the Adam Kadmon was limited to a spectral range of spiritual vision. 35 They also prevented spiritual - scientific knowledge l given by the Treasury of Knowledge, from being used in the worlds they kept in ignorance. 36 These fallen \" Masters \" ap - propriated for themselves the title \"El\" at the end of their names and corrupted both the physical radia - tions of the Sons of Light entering the physical plane, and the Daugh - ters of God who represent the true feminine side of the Godhead. Thus, the Daughters of God were prevented from manifesting the higher teaching on the earth plane by the corrupt priesthoods. 37 These fallen Masters created a hierarchy which was intended to control all religions of the planet in their idolatrous image of God. Moreover, these Masters caused the evolving root races of the planet to cohabit with the fallen Nephilim forms so as to create a race in the image of Enosh - those who do not aspire to anything beyond the material form. 38 Hence, these false Masters came to this planet and taught a false science of \" progressive evolu - tion \" to the scientific teachers of the planet. In essence! since that time, the vlbratory levels upon this planet are subject to \" retrogressive evolution. \" Yet, in the quest for a purer \" planting of divine Light, \" man can reach through Metatron and the Hosts that Light which is possible to restore a shining Adamic intelligence to this local universe. 39 Moreover, out of the divine plan of renewal, the Father has now permitted the angelic hierar - chies to overpower the limited fal - len creations. The fallen Masters who previously allowed the \"bio- stratus double spiral \" to get trap - ped in meta - matter are now being overthrown. This is resulting in a new flow of the light stream of energy manifestation from the Adam Kadmon. 40 Without the thrones of glory and the Heads of spiritual civiliza - tions appointed by the true Hierar - chy of the Father and the Ancient of Days, material form would re - main the play object of the Nephilim gods who tempt intelli - gence with a \"similitude,\" so that intelligence serves a form of the lower light rather than the Living Light. 41 To maintain their power the Nephilim gods have fought to withhold the power of the il- KEY 306 37 - 45 luminaries which can bestow upon man the necessary ability to use the Sephirothic emanations in the lower heavens, 42 As I write this key, I must speak of the 'Paradise records of vision' Metatron showed me. And I saw coded within the crystal tablets the vision of the earth giants that indulged with the daughters of the Adamic Race until the Earth was polluted with beings possessing large physical bodies yet having small limited souls. On these crystal tablets I saw written that generation after generation will transgress until a newborn seed comes to Earth and transgression is destroyed and sin passes away. 43 I saw at the beginning of time how the pre-Ajazelite, the pre - Adamic, the pre - Noachian, and the pre - Jaredite models of life became limited in consciousness form and heavenly Man cried out: \" Where is my Divine Overself? \" At that time only the Enochian and Sethian seed were permitted to enter the \" House of Light \" and increase the heavenly Treasury of Wisdom from the experience of the lower spheres. 44 I saw the powers of the many Satans - the powers control - ling our three - dimensional spheres, emanating very violent explosions so that parts of chaos formed new planets and trapped Womb - Man back into cycles of materialization and into the images of the root races that fell from all Eons. 45 I heard the Father call and say: \" Adam, Adam. \" And the body answered from the lower heavens and said: \" Here am I, Father. \" And the Father said to him: \" Thy seed of Light (Ur) will be numbered"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"KEY 306 45 - 56 with Uriel and the Office of Re - demptive Light.

Henceforth, the consciousness of spiritual creation will no longer sleep under the shaded appearance of the false light. 47 I saw how Metatron commis - sioned the great Wisdom of Light and how the Higher Lords of Light no longer isolated the Earth so it would no longer be under the fal - len command of the rebellious Lords of Light. I saw how a special pre - galactic seed of El Race Gods (being of the Light) walked upon the Earth and began to upgrade the dust world creations. 48 I saw how the elect seed of Enoch and Seth built cities in the heavens which were modeled upon the Earth. They were to prepare the physical seed to cross this threshold of creation when man had learned to cooperate and live as a Family of God. 49 And I saw the glorious bio- stratus restored in the heavens!

This appearance form is the lowest form of the Batsalmaynu and Kidmoothenu, the Image and Similitude. 7 Yet, the Image and Similitude is the only blueprint of the life force which man can use to work with the Master Control and the Councils of Light. Man by virtue of this incarnation has the ability to ascend into the Master's image, just as Jesus received the Christ power before the eyes of man as his true higher identity. 8 Man has first, however, to labor with the evolution of his physical body to receive the greater body of Shekinah. Then he can see the Lords of Light and have con- sociate interactions with the Lords of Light face to face. 9 Such a Master can call before his throne all of his created emana - tions or projections which are materialized into bodies of physical creation. 10 The Master occupies many forms and he can call these forms, assemble them, and redispatch them according to the phase of the wisdom assignment of Light and Love that they are to share with the regions of his greater body. These forms are the synthesis of the brain structure and the cell structure for the body of the Lord of Light, who uses the Adam Kadmon as the house of habitation, his house of dwelling. 11 The universe is this way on a greater creative level, wherein all creative genius is drawn together and redispatched with new pro - grams of light creation. 12 In the Book of Revelation 5: 1 - 5, we read: \" And I saw in the right hand of the one seated upon the throne a scroll written within and on the reverse side, sealed tight with seven seals. 13 \" And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice: 'Who is worthy to open the scroll and loose its seals?' But neither in heaven nor upon earth nor under - neath the earth was there a single one able to open the scroll or to look into it. 14 \" And I gave way to a great deal of weeping because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it. But one of the older persons said to me: 'Stop weeping. Look! The Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has conquered so as to open the scroll and its seven seals.' 15 Enoch explained that this Zohar key refers to the program al - ready in existence, symbolized by the Right Hand. (For I was told that new programs are created by the Left Hand and the programs that are already in existence are sustained by the Right Hand of the one seated upon the Throne.) 16 And the scroll that I saw in the presence of the Throne was held by both the Right and the Left Hand, for it was the scroll of the completion of the old program of the Adam Kadmon and the blue- print of the next age of Light for the Righteous of the Christ Race. 17 And I saw with my own eyes the meaning of John's words: 'a scroll written within and on the reverse side. \" My eyes saw how the scroll consisted of fire letter emanations and how it was neces - sary to enter within these emana - tions to know the meaning of both sides of the scroll. 18 And I saw how the reverse side is used by the Masters of Light to code physical creation from the heavenly side so that the human race was but a transparent reversal of the divine images of creation constantly kept in the Di - vine Presence of the Father. 19 The scrolls refer to the pro - gram, the blueprint, of the Seven Mansion Worlds that have yet to be completed and released from their former limitations. 20 Within the Shekinah, the seven seals represent the seven chakras that must be opened so that the souls may ascend and that the completion of the number of perfect souls would not be delayed. 21 This is why John gave way to weeping because he knew that without the opening of the seals a host of souls would be destroyed and not raised on high. 22 The words, \"The Lion of the Tribe of Judah \" means this: Of all tribes of Israel, Judah is the cosine of all tribal movements through the heavens. These movements are controlled by the twelve threshold controls of the Mazzaroth, the Zodiac. 23 Through the collective au - thority of the Tribe of Judah a way is prepared for new teachings to penetrate this world from the KEY higher heavens. The \" face \" of this heavenly leadership has already been seeded in the old planetary realms, but this Lion shall conquer the old solar cosmology. The em - phasis is on the Tribe of Judah, as well as a new Lion symbol. 24 Jesus, the manifestation of the Office of the Christ in the outer realms, revealed to the human as of the root of David, is this greater Light which has penetrated the opening in the skies made by Judah, inviting man to go beyond the astronomy of a physical sun - the lion - into the Sonship of the Collective Messiahship. 25 The Lion is Christ incarnate - the greater Lion of the higher heavens which has conquered the heavens and fully opened the gates for all mankind. 26 John is in the Body of the Adam Kadmon during the time that he is within the visual scenarios of the Throne standing before the scrolls of High Com - mand; he understands that he is a materialization of thought - forms in motion. 27 He understands that the power and the glory of the Father are so magnificent that even the Masters of Light who sit in the presence of the Father, though they are co-eternal with the Father, take a leave of absence from one of the planes of the Throne so as to di - rectly institute god intelligence in new worlds of creation and at the same time allow other heavenly Masters the opportunity to sit in the presence of the Father and to acquire greater ascendancy. 28 The Teacher continues in 5: 6 - 10: \" And I saw standing in the midst of the throne and of the four"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"KEY 307 28 - 41 living creatures and in the midst of the older persons a lamb as though it had been slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which eyes mean the seven spirits of God that have been sent forth into the whole earth. 29 \" And he went and at once took it out of the right hand of the one seated on the throne. \" (Note: the energy thrones and the energy controls are taken out of the Right Hand and given to the Lamb.) 30 \" And when he took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty - four older persons fell down before the Lamb, having each one a harp and golden bowls that were full of incense, and the incense means the prayers of the holy ones. 31 \" And they sing a new song, saying: 'You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals, because you were slaughtered and with your blood you brought persons for God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, 32 'and you made them to be a kingdom and priest to our God, and they are to rule as kings over the earth,' 33 Metatron showed me how the new prophets and priests of Ur would be the Council of the Brotherhood of Light upon the face of the earth. 34 He showed me how the Councils of the Brotherhoods are governed by Ascended Masters who form the base line of the Great Pyramid of White Light that surrounds the Ancient of Days. The base line is made up of Trinitized Ascended Masters, so that any one of the Council's As- cended Masters cannot be looked upon without seeing all three Mas - ters as an eternal eye. 35 In the presence of the An - cient of Days there are also \" the four living creatures \" who are the creative substance within the Treasury of the Light. 36 Metatron showed me how the whirling Mysteries were used by the Elohim to shape intelligence on galactic and sub - galactic levels according to the Will of the Father. For this reason, the four living creatures are full of eyes which are used to project countless images and similitudes into the darkness. This allows the Lords to create many realms in all four directions of galactic darkness with great pre - cision and certainty. 37 This is done by allowing one Mystery of the Father to flow through all of the eye forms possi - ble to change darkness and dust into the inheritances of the Light. 38 The fallen Lords of Light, however, do not have the power of the four living creatures for which reason they cannot perfect creation. 39 Metatron took me into the Throne of the Ancient of Days where I saw how His co - eternal ar - chitects share the images of the greater Light which is continuously transformed from His Throne into many Thrones and Dominions of the Twenty - Four Elders, thus enabling each to have a godly throne in the worlds of the Olam Atziluth. 40 Each of the Twenty - Four Elders has a harp which is the vi - brations of the music of the spheres which coordinate the thrones with the changing har - monics of the universe. 41 They also have a golden bowl which is filled by the ad - ministering angels with incense which is the prayers of salvation from the holy ones. This golden bowl is also seen as the Kolob, the Great Central Sun which gathers the life giving energies in each uni - verse of the Elders so that the El - ders can fashion new worlds. 42 Thus, even in the Thrones and Principalities of the individual Elders, the thought - forms of Light and the images of creation are in - gathered, evaluated, and redis- patched to create new worlds. 43 And it was explained to me how the higher planes would be called first before the throne to give account of how they use their energies of life. 44 Those who are of the imper - fect Light are cast out from the midst of the thrones into the lower heavens causing great imbalance in the lower heavens. 45 This is the beginning of the great house cleansing which shall be extended to all realms of the Father's House of Many Mansions and shall displace the false spiritual authorities from the higher heavens to the regions of planetary creation, some even to the point of begin - ning their spiritual evolution com - pletely over again. 46 The graduating spiritual in - telligence then acquires the order - ing in space left open by the other intelligences which are ascending or being cast out, thus harmonizing the imbalance. 47 And I saw the Lamb which is the Father's Son, who directs the Office of the Christ, open the seven seals. And his face was that of Jesus, but it had great sadness because of the weakness of the KEY angels which corrupted man, and the way that man had received his higher spiritual teachings. 48 And I saw the keys to the Throne's Victory fulfilling the \" Program Israel \" which means \" He who contends with God until vic - tory. \" 49 And I saw the events of the seals being broken, even though the Earth had not yet experienced these truths in its time - lag of spiritual energy. 50 And when I saw the first seal being broken: 'Come!' And I saw, and look! a white horse; and the one seated upon it had a bow; and a crown was given him, and he went forth conquering and to complete his conquest. 51 I saw before my eyes a great Galactic Battle to cleanse the higher heavens. I saw Michael renouncing the independent Light forces from the regions of Sagittarius that did not bow before the Father. 52 And the second seal was broken and I saw, \" a fiery - colored horse and to the one seated upon it there was granted to take peace away from the earth so that they should slaughter one another; and a great sword was given him. \" 53 When I saw the second seal n a fiery - colored horse appeare before my eyes which is being the Jerusalem Command from Orion.

And I saw, and look! a black horse; and the one seated upon it had a pair of scales in his hand. And I heard a voice as if in the midst of the four living creatures say: 'A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the olive oil and the wine.' 57 And I saw how those who had offered their souls for the glory and the power of Lucifur were judged in the scales of the heavenly weights and measures. 58 The black horse comes to judge those who are not prepared for the harvest and the angels who are cast down from the higher heavens into bodies of grotes - querie. They are weighed with the good seed and are revealed as the seeds of Lucifur that had not borne heavenly fruit and could not be gathered with the denarius of the Christ. 59 Each was measured accord - ing to his worth like a flower on the branches of the Tree of Life in the days of the last - fruits. And the balance of life was called forth be - fore the throne to give account of its creative wisdom, as sprouts of Lebanon and Israel in the summer days. 60 The good wheat was gathered and divided from the chaff. In like manner, the barley was ripe for harvest. And the Righteous were called forth to pre - pare for the feast day of the Lord in the temple of the Most High. 61 Like a luxuriant olive tree full of berries, the olive oil was gathered of those Sons of Israel who could stand before the Lord in the altar of majesty as Jesus stood upon the Mount of Olives. And Michael stretched forth his hand to the cup, and poured out the wine from the grapes and poured it out as a sweet smelling savor to the Most High King. 62 And this is the judgement of those in the heavens.

For these souls have previously been given the opportu - nity to overcome Death through faith, service to mankind, and the realization of the Mysteries of the Kingdom of God. 66 And I saw upon the planet four types of nemesis converge: food shortage, deadly plague, wild beasts, and wars. These ravaged man as a karmic penalty for his sin against one of the four elements known as earth. 67 The righteous who were wit - nessing to those of \" wickedness \" were also destroyed for they were not in the regions of safety protect - ed by the Merkabah of Light.

And as the scroll was un - rolled there unfolded a new heavens and a new earth. 79 And I saw how the new heavenly vibrations reestablished the boundaries of the twelve planets in the Earth's solar system. However, the twelve planets were placed within a new program of \" many heavens \" so that as the Earth's intelligence ascended into a matter - energy body it was able to live with many other matter - energy intelligences and indwell in constel - lations of two or more physical suns. 80 And I saw the trumpets of the heavenly Merkabah reset the planetary spheres on a new one half minute of arc as the celestial capstone descending from space was placed upon the architecture of the Father's model of Alpha and Omega. 81 And I saw how the Great Pyramid upon the Earth was a model for God's plan of salvation in stone, yet few understood the mystery of the well - spring beneath the pyramid in which existed the souls of those who had failed their assignment in service to the Father. 82 And I saw those who were not prepared to go on into the new program of Light, and they feared the changing of the Earth's orbit and the appearance of new il- luminaries of Light in the midst of the shower of stars that fell into the darkness of earth. 83 And then my eyes saw the Ancient of Days and there where all the flowing energies of this membrane were called and redis- patched, He called unto Himself those \" Living Pictures \" which were fitted to His membrane in love and creative energy. 84 He called forth not only Man as the energy of love within a given space and time, but all of the Adam Kadmons of all of the galac - tic mansion worlds. 85 And He calls before Him all of the thought - forms of creation ex - tended across \" space \" and renews these thought - forms in new scenarios of love, carrying forth His programs unto countless prin - cipalities and powers of His Throne Energies. 86 Now learn from this key this point: Do not dwell in faint - heartedness, but manifest in the public places \" all of the spiritual gifts \" so that the power of the Father's Throne may be glorified in you, for this is the Age of the Holy Spirit. 87 Remember the words of Jesus: \" For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will give great signs and wonders so as to mislead, if possible, even the cho - sen ones.

It will become apparent to Man that organized religion has shown disrespect for the ancient scientific scriptures of Light. For this reason organized religions, who promote the priesthoods of Man at the expense of the scrip - tures, will be seen as the \" Abomi - nation of Desolation \" because they sit in the place of the Lord God proclaiming themselves as the force of YHWH and the authority of Christ. 3 These authorities neutralize consciousness causing the neutrali - zation of spiritual growth, literally the nullification of the ongoing inner consciousness which was brought by the Christ and which has continued to radiate through the ages in the scriptures of Light. 4 In the Book of Daniel 11:30-33, the scripture tells us that at the end of this consciousness time cycle: \" there will come against him (the false leader) the ships of the Kittim (the military powers), and he will have to become de - jected.

They will arouse, among the na - tions, a \" holy war \" based upon the abomination of an \" historic cove - nant, \" and will succeed in activat - ing fires of destruction. However, they are not the \" Abomination of Desolation, \" for the Abomination of Desolation is anything that de - ceives the priesthoods of the earth by not permitting the reign of \" 'spiritual Wisdom \" to reveal God's Kingdom beyond the earth! 14 And then, in Daniel 12:3-4, is revealed the greater \" key \" within this scroll which is to be experi - enced by the faithful of the Word at the end of this Age: \" And the ones having insight will shine like the brightness of the expanse; and those who are bringing the many to righteousness, like the stars to time indefinite, even forever. 15 \" And as for you, 0 Daniel, make secret the words and seal up the book, until the time of the end.

And at this time there will begin to occur the shifting of vast geomagnetic grids which will occur simultaneously with the opening of the tombs of the Masters, as well as the unsealing of hidden docu - ments of \" Light \" which speak of the celestial Masters! 17 And these documents will speak of the celestial hierarchies who give mankind the foundations for the Wisdom of YHWH. And the faithful will understand how the higher \" Covenant of God, \" coded within the scriptures of Light, will be rejected by the world and made an object of blasphemy in the high temples. 18 People will speak of the scriptures, but they will not under - stand the codes. Their conscious - ness will be crucified to the \" Cross of Time \" so that the \" Cross of Transfiguration \" will not be able to operate within them to reveal the \" Revelation \" of YHWH that must come to pass to break the seals of the Old Age. 19 They will not appreciate the scriptures of Light because they will understand scripture only in terms of mythology, from teachers who are teaching from a historical standpoint, being oblivious to the higher spiritual truths. 20 The \" Abomination of Desola - tion \" will also reign in the heavens where the \" Princes \" of other worlds established their scriptures to the exclusion of YHWH. A great war will ensue and the armies of the \" Ultimate Triumphants \" will cast the grotesquerie down, into the regions of the lower heavens and upon the planets, in judgment. Mankind will then have to choose between those who bring a scrip - ture to earth having a foundation of worn - out, contaminated sub - stances, from those who bring the scriptures of Wisdom that proclaim a pluralism of worlds through the KEY 308 76 - 25 perfection of everything possible in the Name of YHWH! 21 The scriptures tell us in Daniel 12:7-10: \" And I began to hear the man clothed with the linen, who was up above the wa - ters of the stream, as he proceeded to raise his right hand and his left hand to the heavens and to swear by the One who is alive for time indefinite: 'It will be for an ap - pointed time, appointed times and a half. And as soon as there will have been a finishing of the dash - ing of the power of the holy people to pieces, all these things will come to their finish.' 22 \" Now as for me (Daniel), I heard, but I could not understand; so that I said: '0 my lord, what will be the final part of these things?' 23 \" And he went on to say: 'Go Daniel, because the words are made secret and sealed up until the time of the end.

This has come to pass in Tibet as it has come to pass in an - cient Israel with the \" holy exodus. \" For the sacred scriptures are the Treasury of Light \" embodied in God's people, \" scattered upon the face of the earth as an example of the greater plan of creation! 25 Thus, the nations of Israel"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"KEY 308 25 - 34 and Tibet are witnesses to the as - sault by the ungodly at the end of time. For both of these nations, in order to preserve their scriptures and beliefs, had to take an exodus out of their places of bondage. And just as the Israelites made their ex - odus out of Egypt into the geophysical pyramid of Sinai, so also the Tibetans have made their exodus from their homeland into the geophysical pyramid of India. 26 Yet, a revealing of the \" mys - tery texts \" will precede the final wave of destructive fire that will visit Tibet and Israel. 27 A great witness to the ongo - ing exodus has been the return of the children of Israel to their home - land where, at the same time, in accord with prophecy, the Dead Sea Scrolls were uncovered. 28 The \" return to Israel \" and the finding of the Dead Sea Scrolls are the fulfillment of two great prophecies which must take place before the return of the Messiah to earth which is the third great prophecy. 29 All of these scriptures tell us that before the end of the world, the non - believers will take control and will not acknowledge the Hosts of the Father. They will try to destroy religion, but religion will destroy itself because it has held on to mythological forms and the au - thority to enforce the meaning of the scriptures imperfectly and with \" great fear \" . 30 Therefore, today we have the modern Sadducees who are the or - ganized religions denying the \" fourteen gifts \" of the Holy Spirit Shekinah, denying the resurrection of the \" Christed souls \" outside the church, and denying the higher worlds of Light that serve a Living God. 31 The Pharisees of today are those who seek to govern others through the psychic powers of per - sonality change and \" shadow phenomena, \" giving no heed to the multiple gifts of the Holy Spirit which are to be used for soul advancement. With their pre - sumptuous powers of authority, they speak of their singular ways of saving the multitudes, challeng - ing and despoiling those who would take issue with them, and denying the collective Hierarchy of YHWH. 32 Enoch said that the \" Abomi - nation of Desolation \" will try to weaken the Sons and Daughters of the \" Living Word, \" but this will not happen to those who actually become the embodiment of the Liv - ing Torah Or - the Word which is primal and self - existent, having no dependence on matter or its qual - ities. 33 People will rise against the teachers of the Word, against the teachers of righteousness. They will almost succeed in destroying the teachers of the Word, but the superior Wisdom of the Word will show the keys that have the great - er biological and astrophysical powers; the Light that enables dead matter to live will overpower those directing dangerous and disturbing passions! 34 The \" Sacred Scriptures \" of the \" Universe to Come \" are the scriptures that show how the Word of God continues to create \" new worlds \" and is, in fact, the only good news for humanity, since all other worlds end in nothing. The sacred scriptures contain the pre - cise architectural progressions which give the mapping for cre - ation. 35 They hold the keys to lay bare the secrets of the heavenly temples of YHWH coded into stone models and left behind in \" holy dwelling places \" of the Sons of Light as a beacon to higher Wis - dom. 36 In fact, the power of the \" Sacred Scripture \" will be seen in the coming of myriad interplan - etary messengers who will come to reclaim and \" reveal \" their scrip - tures left behind within the temples of stone. Enoch said that we should understand that the sacred scriptures of Light are more than just the scriptures of parchment; they are scriptures also written on embellished stones, and placed within crystal spheres that need to be decoded through the power of Light. 37 The Word calls for eternal progression through soul - birth and soul - resurrection into the \"Light- stream \" of the Ain Soph. Enoch also explained to me that there would be three resurrections de - pending upon the consciousness state of belief. Those who would unify their spiritual consciousness with all five bodies would be taken first; those who possessed only the physical and mental consciousness would be given a spiritual witness which would come in the days of the appointed times. And those who are operating only with the pure physical vehicle would be given a physical witness at the end of time so that when the chambers of the earth break open they might be prepared to be quickened at the final resurrection. KEY 308:34-42 38 We are also told in this key of Enoch that wherever man is gathered together in an organized church, synagogue, or house of worship and he does not under - stand the scriptures of Light as keys to the coming universe, he will misinterpret the activity of the Divine Mind who calls dust into the next wavelength of Light. 39 Moreover, the \" Abomination of Desolation, \" within the context of Zohar, speaks of the defilements wherever establishments have burned the scriptures of Light. And this destruction has been going on ever since the day when the \" Councils of Man \" sought to con - ceal the Name of the true God speaking through the many sacred languages of the earth. 40 Nonetheless, at the end of this time cycle, there shall be scrip - tures of crystal found in the oceans and scriptures of stone found in the land of Yucatan, and scriptures of Light found throughout the world which shall have name cod- ings of \" Tak, \" or shall speak of re - gions identified with cognate forms of the word \"Tak\" and the visita - tions of the true emissaries of Light to this planet in previous ages. 41 Yet, the religions shall try to hide these new scriptures which verify the teachings of Enoch and the Masters.The religions will try to issue new dogma accepting some of these new teachings, but these commands will not be sufficient to keep up with the re - revealing of the scripture of YHWH from the depths of the earth. 42 We, then, will see the at - tempt to conceal and destroy the message of the world scriptures as a sign of the end, whereby the or -"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"KEY 308 42 - 43 ganized intelligentsia will try to de - stroy the interpretations of the scriptures, the very interpretation which gives people true spiritual freedom. 43 Then will be fulfilled Daniel \" And from the time that the constant (feature) has been re - moved and there has been a placing of the disgusting thing that is causing desolation, there will be one thousand two hundred and ninety days. \" 44 Those who speak the truth will be attacked and destroyed, but the Zohar tells us 'many shall rise,' many shall be brought to life and many shall shine as the stars in the firmament:"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"THE KEYS OF THE UNIVERSE TO COME TELL US THERE WILL BE A LIGHT EXODUS FROM THE PYRAMID - LIKE STRUCTURE OF THIS UNIVERSE TO THE \" THRONE \" OF THE NEXT VERSE.

Their amenities include crystallized environments which can change the atmosphere to suit the physical occupants. 27 Some biosatellites contain whole living environments that will take the place of planetary envi - ronments that the occupants are being removed from. 28 The physical biosatellites use specialized fields of magnetohy- drodynamics to move them into a '~geosynchronous \" orbit within a given solar system. Here multiple planets can be attended to and in - structed simuItaneously by the biosatellites, By modulating multi - ple radiation belts in direct rela - tionship to multiple south poles on the biosatellite, a special orbital vib - ration is created which is used to maintain the biosatelIite's opera - tions with respect to the planet. 29 Covering the exterior of the vehicle are bio - organisms which make continuous repair to the ex - terior covering and provide for thermal changes while going through the energy envelopes of different star systems. 30 Special planets with no radi - ation fields are selected for metal - lurgy and mining special minerals for motherships that are from twenty - five to fifty miles in length. These ships are constructed out of a pattern of concentric atoms that can withstand maximum spectral ir - radiation. 31 Abundant food is created by reprocessing various soil nutrients through a changing light environ - ment which produces whatever food is necessary for physical sur - vival - Through a blue - green light conversion process the plant phase is bypassed and the food staple is created immediately! Here a soil- like nutrient is mixed with seed in order to rapidly produce whatever organic substance is necessary. In addition, this soil-like nutrient can be continuously used over and over again for other food items. 32 However, most higher evolutionary races Iive off of light which they synthesize for their energy supply which is pulsated into them from a regenerating light environment. 33 These physical stepping stones to more complicated con - sciousness time zones do not have harsh and metallic interiors. Rather they are verdant as the loveliest terrain on the planets in Trapezium Orion and some even contain mountain ranges. 34 They contain artificial seas which flow throughout the biosatel- lite by means of cylindrical con - duits. The regenerating water envi - ronment purifies the living envi - ronment by running through crys - talline ducts and atmospheric ceil - ings which are sustained by photon walls. 35 Special marine life can Iive in axis meridians where there is no gravity. They are used to create energized particles which are trans - ferred to the oceans of spoiled planetary biospheres through a purple membrane which transfers photons in converting waste to food and power. Here, the purple membrane receives light during a series of energy exchanges which is stored in the form of ATP to power its cells. Through phase - delay reac - tions the membrane turns the photons into interchemical energy which empowers new life functions on levels of recombination through the decay and degeneration of mat - ter. 36 The program 8033 - 45 pro - vided \" Israel \" with all of its poten - tial beauty as a model for millions of spiritual colonists who could create out of planetary waste a verdant paradisiacal community. This community was to serve as a model for spiritual resurrection for thousands of similiar biosatellite communities preparing for other planetary worlds. 37 All who fail to maintain the highest degree of spiritual love and service to the Father are removed through the incarnation code (the Omega 'plus program) and incar - nated on the local physical planets where spiritual - physical synthesis must be achieved for the grounding of destructive energies. 38 The reprogramming legion ships and motherships carry au- KEY 309:34-44 tonomous day and night environ - ments which are created by their unique environmental architecture. . 39 This environment is sus - tained by the axis of the vehicle being oriented toward a parent star and light is divided from the dark - ness by vast planes of sparkling synthesized metal attached outside the vehicle at an angle. These solar mirrors reflect sunlight in through the windows to create the day, and can be adjusted to control its length, which also determines the program climate and seasonal varia - tions. 40 When the series of window- like, circular mirrors are moved, the angles at which the sunlight re - flects off the vehicle gives the ap - pearance of stationary light in the sky - as in the time of the Prophet Elijah, the sun can appear motionless in the sky. When the mirrors close, night is created aboard the vehicle. 41 Within the medical environ - ment of the legion ship discorpo- rated forms can be regenerated and resurrected by the right Omega- minus threshold code. 42 These are advanced gifts re - served for the physical \" elect \" who have proved worthy of the King - dom of the Father and who have been preserved in physical bodies to work with the technology of the Higher Evolution. Some will be \" gardeners \" and \" caretakers \" of the earths and the regions of the lower heavens. 43 And when the harvest is proclaimed, the righteous physicals, with the sign of YHWH's Name upon their third eye, shall be taken up from their fields. 44 The Light will probe the face"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"KEY 309.44 - 58 of the Earth and will pick up the vibratory light crystal of the Christ blood coded upon the doorposts of the body temple of Gematria. 45 Great streaks of Light will be seen in the sky over the chambers of the Earth where the righteous will be gathered.

And Metatron ex - plained to me that our entire uni - verse is going through a vast leap into a new Light creation whereby the super - super galaxies, super spectrum galaxies, galaxies which are local universes, gas giant planets and earth - type planets will be raised to a new energy level. 2 This is part of a changing energy network which is purifying itself. This is the consummation of the aeons that is at the ascension of the universe. 3 At this universal dissolution which is beginning at this time, the perfected souls from the different regions and cycles of intelligence will be advanced. All intelligence, whether they are from a carbon cycle, ammonia cycle, silicon cycle, nitrogen cycle, etc., or whether they are invisible or visible, will be advanced according to their perfec - tion and their synchrosimilarity with the original boundaries of the greater creation. 4 Metatron showed me the tape - like analogue of our spectrum of evolution, containing six billion years of testing (within a half - life of twelve billion years) in earth time, which will be moved to a new foundation within the Throne of YHWH, moving our galaxy clos - er to the center of 100 billion gal - axies in the visible spectrum, which form the corner of our \" House. \" This House is one of many Houses that compose a con - sciousness time zone which is ad - jacent to the Father's Throne. 5 Within this House, I saw how our solar system, within cycles of twenty - five million years, moves closer to the center of the Kolub, our Central Sun, which is under"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"the control of its throne energy. And Metatron showed me the many Mansion Houses of the Father of which ours lies facing eastward in the Sea of Crystal. 6 And then I understood the vi - sion of Ezekiel: \" And gradually he brought me back to the entrance of the House, and look! there was water going forth from under the threshold of the House eastward, for the front of the House was east. And the water was going down from under, from the right - hand side of the House, south of the altar. 7 \" And he gradually brought me forth by the way of the north gate and took me around by the way outside of the outer gate that is facing towards the east, and, look! water was trickling from the right - hand side. \" 8 I saw that the \" House \" he spoke of was not the \" House \" of the Earth's sun system, but the House of the Lord which is made up of millions of suns. In the center of the House, I saw the Kolob, the central core of the throne and dominion regions that comprise our House of Many Man - sions. 9 I then understood the sayings of Ezekiel, of how in the consum - mation of time \" the courtyard to - wards the east \" would be sepa - rated into \" dining rooms \" for the children of the Lord. 10 Yet, going from the outer courtyard of the River of Crystal to the inner courtyard of the Holy Feast requires that species clothe themselves with garments of Holy Light. 11 The waters described in this scripture are composed of spiraling radiations of Light. And, at the end of a program of creation, \" the Gates \" of the heavens are opened and the Light radiations fill the Houses so the intelligence is quick - ened without going through the stages of the hierarchical command. 12 This is a unique type of Light radiation which flows directly from the Father's Throne through Metatron. It possesses the greatest power, reaching out to a myriad number of Houses, whereby the Houses themselves are purified and restructured according to new programs of Light. 13 And what Ezekiel is seeing here is the changing of the thresholds which involves a higher Light process symbolized by the ''trickling water. \" 14 I was shown how this Light was used to ingather all of the select elements of creation, and these elements were purified when mixed with the radiations of Light. I saw how within this Light there were many veils, many different patterns and textures of Light, and each veil was used to purify a cer - tain element of creation. 15 I was shown how each \"House\" is anchored in a certain vibration rate, and the opening of the Gates allows the worlds to be released from the vibration rate, and they spiral through an energy corridor of Light until they reach 'a River' which moves by rapid pulses of Light. I saw the foundations of the lower heavens thrown open, and that which moved slowly was swallowed by orifices of Light which shot out into a multitude of directions. 16 I saw how the Father quick - ens His Kingdom through tre - mendous orifices and tubes and how He allows the liquid state of His creation to move upward and pass through the tubes and con - verge with other forms of material creation. Therefore, flowing pulses of energy are gradually quickened until they meet with an overriding conic section of Light which syn - chronizes the energy into \" a spiral nebula of Light - Life zones - \" 17 I saw pillars of Light flow from the extremities of the House towards the Kolob, and as they flowed, each increased in mag - nitude and formed new boundaries for the thrones and dominions. The pillars liquefied into one another and unfolded into star geometries which compose the tessellated floor of a Mansion world. 18 Metatron, then, showed me the mystery of those who inhabit the Kolob in the midst of the \" House \" ! And to my eyes it was further revealed the mysteries of Ezekiel's words: \" And he finished the measurements of the inner house, and he brought me out by the way of the gate, the front of which was toward the east, and he measured it all around. 19 \" He measured the eastern side with the measuring reed. It was five hundred reeds, by the measuring reed, round about. He measured the northern side, five hundred reeds, by the measuring reed, round about. The southern side he measured, five hundred reeds, by the measuring reed. He went around to the western side. He measured five hundred reeds, by the measuring reed. 20 \" For the four sides he meas - ured it. It had a wall all around, with a length of five hundred KEY 310. 16 - 27 reeds, and a width of five hundred reeds, to make a division between what is holy and what is profane. \" 21 I was shown how Ezekiel's vision of our \" House \" was one basic reproduction of the myriad forms that are possible from a transcendent model in the higher heavens of the Elohim; it could not be polluted by the sun, for the model was incorruptible. It was not involved in time! 22 Metatron showed me how this model of evolution was com - pleted and \" stored \" within the sa - cred space of the Eternal Memory! 23 Moreover, I was told how \" our House \" was prepared when YHWH took counsel to make Paradise in the lower heavens. It was prepared for Adam before he was corrupted and his body - house closed to the recognition of other vehicles that indwelled within his \" garment of Light. \" 24 Those who manifest the Wisdom of the Light will continue to evolve into the thrones and dominions of Light and no longer wander in the profane conscious - ness of the earth. 25 But those who cut off their body - cosmos from \" the House \" will remain in the cistern of mire. 26 These are the ones who are not included within the measure - ments of the five hundred reeds; for one hundred is one of the signs of Wisdom in the sight of the Lord, and these who are cut off do not attain unto the Wisdom of their five bodies. 27 I was shown how the body itself is the basis for the reed of measurement.

And, when this perfection is attained on the in - terior of the human temple, and the finite and infinite are drawn together, the passage from the pro - fane to the sacred becomes possi - ble!

They are the ones who will become part of the \" Kingdom of Light \" when the spiraling radia - tions of Light will take us \" like water drawn out of a well. \" 32 Thus, I pass onto you what I saw in the companionship of Metatron, before I stepped again through the Gate, built of veils of Light, and passed through the divi - sions that appeared as tongues of fire. My body was prepared as a Light - stream so that I could walk between the stars and \" lightnings \" until I came to the Merkabah of Enoch. 33 And, standing on the tessel - lated groundwork of crystal, the Merkabah of Enoch bore me downwards from the heavens. And I hastened through the sphericity of a star and lightning cavity until the lightnings sped faster and fas - ter, until I entered the density of gravitational compression around the earth, and began to drift slower and slower. 34 And, then, the Merkabah body of Enoch brought me through the clouds of the mist of the Earth. And I was told to speak these words except those things reserved for each body of Wisdom to see in the higher heavens - where pro- tocreation proceeds from Light zone to Light zone according to the Father's Will. 35 Understand, 0 Man of flesh, that you cannot see through the open doors and portals of the Light universe.

The more sophisticated the conscious - ness the more complex the time zone. 4 Therefore, infinite creative programs and possibilities for con - sciousness expression and expan - sion in an infinite number of uni - verses are limited only to the sin - gular Elohistic imprints of Light emanating from the Divine Mind. 5 The consciousness time zone is the collective gathering of singu - lar imprints into a hierarchical structure of minus infinity which defines the field existing between luminaries. It unifies individual programs of luminaries so that a given number of Creator Gods share a common spiritual purpose. 6 For this reason the domain of a consciousness time zone is to be found in the origin of conscious - ness itself. The programs of the Father's consciousness are limited to the fields of the luminaries by the way they use their collective af - finities to connect the Father's Cosmic Law with the creative Logic which must operate within the Light continuum."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"KEY 31 1:7-20 7 In essence, the consciousness time zone is the divine configura - tion whereby the many programs of the Creator Gods - the Elohim, and the physical forms of creation all share a major manifestation of the Ain Soph Light radiations. 8 These divine radiations set the actual boundaries of the conscious - ness time zone and sub - divide into programs of beginning and end (i.e., a House or Mansion world of Light). 9 Within these programs of cre - ation and expansion, the Light radiations form the etheric Light regions and the physical sub - stratum which synthesizes a holistic membrane unifying all elemental forms serving a divine program. 10 In the dawning of physical worlds created out of each con - sciousness time zone, the Elohim Creators use the emanations of matter - waves and time - waves to form the necessary planes of inter - secting visible and invisible spec - trums. 11 We must, literally, leave our consciousness time zone before we can see that its boundaries are not those of actual time or space but that of consciousness purification. 12 In order to go beyond this consciousness time zone, I had to realize Enoch's program of con - sciousness development could not go into the Higher Council's pres - ence of the Twenty - Four Elders who sit within multiple conscious - ness time zones of the Father. For this reason Metatron took me into his own consciousness vehicle which is beyond the Elohim worlds of Light. 13 In summary, the conscious - ness time zone has its boundaries in consciousness development, creating time regions that are used in a multitude of ways fulfilling the goals that consciousness sets for it - self. 14 The major goal is the sow - ing of seeds from the collective fields of the luminaries for the purpose of rejoicing in all of the infinite possibilities of unfolding the Father's Mind. 15 The unfoldment of the Di - vine Mind's programs of Light energy purification requires con - tinuous formation - restoration of di - vine seeds of Light. Through this unfoldment the entropic regions (of less desirable worlds) are either re - stored or fall away as imperfect creation. 16 In this expansion there are two creations simultaneously occur - ring at all times - we shall term them the \" divine \" (spiritual) and the \" physical. \" 17 The \" divine creation pro - gram \" is given as a preexistent blueprint composed of \" seeds of Light .\" 18 This divine creation is a con - tinuous pulse of Living Light which connects the minds of the Creator Gods (of a consciousness time zone) who serve the Ancient (Head) of Days. 19 The seeds are instant Light images, from a Treasury of thought - forms, shared with the higher divinities for the purification of a11 energy dimensions. Through the Divine Mind of Wisdom the consciousness mind of Light ex - pands forming regions of (non - physical) membrane growth. 20 The divine creation initiates, through templates of energy, con - figurations which shape multiple energy spectrums and localized fields of negative mass which pre - cede the shaping of physical real - ity. 21 The Creator Gods require certain mechanistic forms for test - ing their creative impulse, for which reason they created the physical worlds. 22 The physical worlds are seeded by templates which contain the blueprint for gradual evolution through a sequence of biomechani- cal stages. Therefore, the physical worlds operate within \"time-lag\" dimensions because they are sub - ordinate to a divine program of consciousness activity. 23 In other words, the \"time- lag \" is created by virtue of the seed form being extended into physical space. Therefore, the \" time - lag 7 ' is a physical separation which may exist, in terms of millions of Light years, between the energy grids of creation and the human vantage point; however, from the stand - point of higher spiritual reality it is only consciousness which separates man from God, and the realization that the \"divine template'' is only on the other side of Light directly within man's presence at all times. 24 When the human mind re - ceives events outside of its physical time frame of reference, it will per - ceive the presence of a second world which is operating faster than the conventional physical brain processes. Therefore, it will see how our physical world is within a '>time - lag \" subordinate to high speed events taking place in the second world. 25 This second world shapes the conventional brain processes through time waves which are used KEY by the conventional brain to recall memory, to capture events i and to participate in the thought structure of parallel worlds of intelligence. 26 The supra - consciousness con - tinuum, which makes this possible, emanates from the higher con - sciousness exercising a superior in - terpretive and controlling role upon the neural biological events of men - tal time interplaying with matter- waves and time - waves of the Light c ontinuum. 27 In actuality, this higher con - sciousness mind operates through the divine worlds which, in turn, affects the physical worlds through consciousness image programs of Light continuum which are not li - mited to time differences. 28 The self - realized mind can then modulate time differences to step in and out of multiple realities between the physical world and the spiritual world out of which our physical reality is extended. 29 Connection between the spiritual and physical programs is through a consciousness blueprint or template which interfaces with the seeds of Light coming from the spiritual worlds of thought to form the seeds of material form unfold - ing within the physical layers of creation. It is through the photon bundles that the seed forms are transplanted from the conscious - ness template into the energy grids that are used to activate the physi - cal layers of creation. 30 Essentially, there are many templates connecting physical and consciousness layers of reality. As the photon bundles wear out, they are replaced by Light structures which correspond to the activity of the seed form."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"KEY 3 71.3 1 31 All, however l must relate to a divine template of the Creator Gods (the Elohim) through which they extend their sublime teachings into a template recorder cell in the midst of that which is defined as a \" Mansion world i ' containing myriad galaxies. 32 The individual recorder cell can receive different forms of the spatial coding of Light. Therefore, the codes of Light operate through myriad forms of the Sephirothic ernanations which break down in the physical world into sets of pulse, group, gravitational waves, waves operating in a vacuum, etc. 33 The template recorder cell al - lows for multiple levels of firing rates which are collectively com - posed from various types of waves which permit the geometry of a seed form of Light to move from one state of consciousness to another. 34 The Higher Evolution is also able to beam spiritual knowledge from the recorder cell to a specific localized intelligence. For example, through the multi - light image transformation, the recorder cell template allows for light impulses arriving from a divine template to be allocated to specific localized zones of consciousness where they are adapted to the paradigms necessary for the distribution of Light. 35 The template recorder cell sends out thought - forms of infor - mation which are continually active in space. Forms of advanced physi - cal intelligence can directly tap into this information if they have a crys - talline network within their brain cavity. For this reason the brains of advanced phvsicals will reveal the right and left hemispheres fused and a small crystal network in the right frontal lobe which acts as a crystal recorder cell or third brain transposing the language of the Higher Evolution into the vernacu - lar. 36 This is the meaning of \" the Many and the One, \" the many templates or monitoring mech - anisms of Light connecting one program with many programs of organization. 37 And at the head of these many templates there is the pulsat - ing divine template which allows for the processing of large amounts of information for local application. 38 This triggers a divine calling frequency which is available for universal application. Conse - quently, when the divine template is connected with the divine lan - guage being processed through the other templates of Light, there is a synthesis of many consciousness forms of Light. 39 These consciousness forms of Light are governed, in turn, by the Hierarchy of the Elohim who ad - vise the lower evolutionary hierar - chies on what information should be placed within their respective recorder cells. 40 They also determine how to program the computer recorder cell with the internal language and the brain network, that species require for changes through successive evolutionary programs. 41 They reassess how the brain network is processing information according to the original conscious - ness blueprint of the divine seed. 42 In terms of the human evolution, they determine which parts of the brain network can be used for selective adaptation. 43 When this takes place, the mind becomes a receptor for quan - tum mechanistic corpuscIes of Light. Hence it becomes its own field of Light for the body. Yet, the mind still remains in the field of a photonic envelope being directed by the recorder cell which in turn is a field of Light within the field of the divine template and the Ain Soph, the limitless Light of the Fa - ther. 44 Thus, throughout all of these field levels there is a highly or - ganized state of cells and tissues that is formed through the crystal lattice of the Shekinah universe processing Light from the semicon- ductivity of the Gematria template, the inner mathematical synthesis of all bio - structures of Light. 45 This bio - semiconductivity of Gematria is indispensable for the existence of Man within all mac- romolecular branches of Light under the control of the recorder cell. Man is, fundamentally, the vessel of Light. 46 In the physical world of cre - ation, the tree of knowledge re - mains within the body of man as a crystalline \" galactic tree \" connect - ing every finger and toe cell of his body with the Light image process of his spiritual consciousness. 47 Man lives in his garden of consciousness creation receiving knowledge from the divine tem - plate and recorder cell through a superholographic process. 48 The superholograms (within man) are not dependent on the physical presence of \" waves \" even though they are most readily de - scribed by the equations of physical waves. This non - dependence of holography on physical wave pro- KEY 317 43 - 55 duction is an important considera - tion in approaching the origin of neural holographic processes. 49 Here the light wavelengths recorded in the brain, coming from a template, are considerably longer than those of physical waves and can, therefore, be carriers of small amounts of information - even in the form of spatially interfering holographic patterns from other sources. 50 However, image formation and superholographic descriptions are meaningless for brain wave mechanisms to decipher mind - 2 events, unless they are amplified through quantum mechanistic cor - puscles of Light. 51 The progressive \" seeding i r of divine images takes place through spatial phase relationships (three - dimensional networks of expanded neurons) which work as super- holograms emanating from a tem - plate. This seeding is necessary as the program changes and is up - dated. 52 Holographic organization shifts emphasis from axonal im - pulses to the slow potential micro - structure that develops in the post - synaptic networks. 53 In man, given the neural hologram, these steps lead to \"image constructions'' of the \" seeds of Light. \" 54 Therefore, the key tells us \" the mind is in a field of Light and a field of Light within a field of Light and eternal Light. \" And the Eternal Mind is constantly imprint - ing functions of the eternal in every form of life. 55 A physical specie then serves as one of the membrane types be - tween star systems as a holograph"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"KEY 31 within the Mind.

Our entire phenomenal world which we ex - perience waking or dreaming can represent a strictly determined, or - derly phantasmagoria that the Higher Evolution can use for con - sciousness thought transmission. 57 Metatron explained to me that the Higher Evolution generally programs man to accept the realities of the higher universe by taking man's subjective conscious - ness body out of his physical body during a dream cycle for education through a visual light experience. 58 When man progresses in his spiritual education, during a meditative state, his elec t r o magnctic body can be taken into other physi - cal and consciousness worlds of Light. There he can receive educa - tion beyond his physical world of reference which enables him to synthesize multidimensional reality. He also gains a working knowledge of how his five body vehicles of energy can prepare him for the ac - tual wearing of the \" Christ body. \" 59 Metatron explained that when Man has fully matured in his spiritual evolution f his physical body and consciousness body can be literally taken off the planet through Merkabah, since the higher spiritual teaching cannot be entirely given on the earth plane due to the lower vibratory levels. 60 Metatron told me, however, that man must distinguish between the lower levels of subjective ex - perience produced by phosphene geometries as opposed to the di - vine Light directly revealed through Merkabah. 61 These subjective patterns of phosphene geometries (e.g., stars, wheels, bright dot patterns, etc.) which arise out of altered states of consciousness are still the result of the physical patterns of conscious - ness connected with the lower vi - bratory grids. 62 However, the existence of pulsating light geometries within the consciousness of man shows that he is already part of a divine circuit of information which flows from light body to Light body. The phosphene geometries are simply the internal read - out! 63 Accordingly f the Brotherhood of Light uses some of the phos- phene geometries to code man's consciousness into an inner lan - guage of Light. 64 If Man would look at his inner space he would see how the Brotherhood can tap into his inner space to \" code information \" just as Man can tap into the mind space of the Masters. 65 Enoch said there are \" five bodies of illumination \" connected to our physical body which are the keys to the mechanistic adaptation of the light fields that are necessary for the seeding process of divine Hokhmah ( \" Wisdom \" ) into the physical world. Hokhmah requires a complex network for its superior cataloguing. 66 Through this superior cataloguing the divine template acts upon neural - electromagnetic events. These events are con - sciously directed, mentally quan - tized and physiologically catalogued through color events. 67 In order for Man to truly use Hokhmah he must have all five bodies active so that they can work directly with the pulsating tem - plates of the recorder cell, the di - vine template, and the Councils of the Elohim on the higher levels of reality. It is through this collective Mastery that teaching is given and received. This Mastery is based upon Man's ability to work simul - taneously with information from many worlds of the lower heavens, He must master this stage before he can truly understand soul pro - gression. 68 One of the five bodies can work directly with the template of the many worlds. This the eka \" of consciousness \" which can leave behind the three - dimensional consciousness time frame and ex - perience other time zones to see and work with the Masters of Light who protect and educate the eka body through an activated Light network. 69 Moreover, this network of Light is used to activate additional plus and minus bodies of con - sciousness light that are necessary to leave behind the bipolarity of the Koine (common) universe to experience the eka (multi - dimensional) universe. 70 Consequently, in order to work with other worlds of multiple relativity there has to be a complex network that can serve these worlds, as well as Masters who are capable of fusing their conscious - ness simultaneously in all worlds of multiple relativity. 71 These Masters work in a trinitized form in our Son universe. This Mystery was announced and clearly demonstrated by Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration when KEY 67 - 76 he appeared with Moses on one side and Elijah on the other. 72 Trinitization is given to a11 Ascended Masters who work di - rectly with the consciousness minds of the illuminaries and have their Christ bodies united with the phys - ical bodies of the Masters who are or have been on the earth plane. 73 Jesus' expression of 'where two, three (or more) are gathered in my Name I am in the midst of them' is a true expression of this sacred Mystery. Here, a certain se - quence of vehicles is necessary to manifest the power of a given di - vine Name which, in turnJ mani - fests the power of divine life. 74 In the education of the soul, the conscious activation of the many eka vehicles demonstrates to man how there is a multidimen - sional relationship between body vehicles that can be also interpene - trated by the multidimensional body vehicles of the Masters of Light. 75 At this time there are many souls who have completed their self - meta programs and yet choose to remain and become future lead - ers and teachers upon this planet. There are those who, while still liv- ing in the physical form, are al - ready working with the quantum of Light from the Throne. 76 This is now taking place on a greater scale than in previous ages because, in previous ages, it was necessary that the operation of the many eka bodies be limited from the higher correspondences of the Masters of Light so that the higher vehicles would not be con - taminated until the Masters had sufficiently incarnated into the human plane to raise its vibration"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"KEY 31 to work with the higher worlds of Light. 77 With the dawning of Light on every level of physical creation, it is possible, through the opening of \" the Gates \" of the Higher Evolution, to receive the full man - ifestation of the eka bodies which lead to the ascension of our Christ body. 78 You are now invited to pre - pare for the \" greater peace \" of the Father who welcomes you with your brothers and sisters.

This process begins the \" diuine creation \" of stars, planets, and specie intelligence. 6 However, this key defines only one of many models that the Divine Mind permits to occur under a preconditioned unfoldment of the image space. We are told in the Book of Genesis that when our local universe was created, the heavens, the earth, and the image and similitude of man were all a product of this \" divine creation\" which was implanted upon form - lessness and void (the substratum of creation). 7 This process of divine creation begins as the Divine Mind ema- nates a divine Light seed which is made up of seven light shells - the nested codings within the har- monics of a Divine Word. 8 Through this Divine Word, the Elohim Creators connect the perceptual apparatus of \" the brain'' (the deca-delta system) and give it a memory, (the recorder cell) which contains the directions for the uni - versal language process. This lan- guage process controls pattern for - mation; namely, where we are within the greater memory. 9 All patterns in our memory come out of a higher information process which is controlled by the network of the Higher Evolution. (This does not include fallen thought - forms which emanate from the hierarchies separate from Di - vine Wisdom.) 10 The Elohim are the Creators of the patterns of the divine defini - tions which, through a creative pulse, establish this network con- necting the Father universe with the physical and spiritual galactic levels of evolving creation. 11 The work of the Elohim es- sentially defines the unfoldment of the divine Name which is the pro - PLATE 19, The Divine Creation of The Deca- , Delta System by the Elohim."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"KEY 3 gram for pattern formation. From the letters of the divine Name the Elohim form the model which will carry the seed forms. 12 The seed forms are projected by the Elohim through the power of the Treasury of Light which is a vortex of universal energy. 13 As the seed forms approach the area where they are to be seeded, they are guided by the recorder cell which is the governing mechanism in the formation of each world. 14 The recorder cell exists as a projection of a divine recorder cell, projected into the midst of the seed forms. The divine recorder cell ac - tively records Eternal events and makes them available for transposi - tion into the worlds of the lower heavens. 15 Like the spiraling forth of a newborn lotus bulb, the recorder cell is formed from the energies of the Throne. The recording function of all life - giving knowledge, then, remains the mediator between the parallel reality of galaxies in the lower heavens and the existing higher grid network which is under the direction of the Elohim and the Elohim Councils, 16 Within each galactic level of evolution there is coded, through the divine seed forms, different spiritual and physical worlds of creation. 17 The spiritual worlds are necessary to manifest the rhythms that oscillate between the maximum and minimum values (the set func - tions), for the implanting of the di - vine seeds in the context of the matter - energy light spectrum. 18 Without the creation of the archetypal spiritual worlds as the gauge for the form of a physical creation/ there could be no accurate ionic composition of material form, nor of solar or star satellites, atmo - spheric tide cycles, and centropic functions, all of which hold a galac - tic network together on many mul - tidimensional levels sharing a common divine density. 19 Hence, the laws of the phys - ical universe are superseded by the laws of a spiritual invisible uni - verse; therefore in our local uni - verse, the central controlling func - tions of our galactic command exist in Sagittarius, functioning as a re - corder cell. However, our galactic disk, with its recorder cell, exists as a multiple reality within the struc - ture of a hyperphase control. 20 Furthermore, our recorder cell command, in turn, is prepro- grammed from within the structure of the universal grid network, exist - ing as the spiritual Central Control in Orionis. 21 The relative dynamics of the physical galaxy, thus, means that every star system within the galaxy is responsible to the recorder cell which is its local central control. This, in turn, receives orders from the prima1 recorder cell - the Cen - tral Control of all spiritual pro - gramming. 22 The recorder cell operates as the activating and active cataloguer of events connected with the di - vine seed program within a local galactic universe. 23 Therefore, in local universes, the recorder cell exists in the midst of the galactic \" tree of live. \" And from the midst of the \" tree of life \" seven candles (the Light core of each branch or star population), are then created for the physical and spiritual embodiments of the Higher Evolution. The human evolution appears as one branch in the midst of the seven branches within our localized universe. 24 Metatron explained to me that within this local universe there are seven major branches of star population arms controlling the var - ious rhythmical activities of en - zymes, cellular forms, etc., testing a11 possible definitions of an Adamic program within a three- to - nine dimensional grid of physi - cal space and time. The combina - tion of these seven branches allows for different phylogenetic trees of physical speciehood to arise from main sequence stars. 25 For our branch of star evolu - tion, the Pleiades is seen as one of the candles used by the divine re - corder cell to create physical em - bodiments. 26 The recorder cell provides the information for pattern forma - tion and the composition of life. This information is then distributed by what the Higher Evolution calls a deca-delta manifold. This deca - delta manifold is a form of energy flow, established by a heat envelope that was produced by the image pat - terns of the Throne through ten Light superscripts. 27 These superscripts provide the deca - delta manifold with the proper topology so that the en - velope created can process addi - tional programs sent out from the Throne. These additional programs have a certain time sequence and ' \" divine space i ' (orientation) that corresponds to the seventy - two di - vine Names. These seventy - two di - vine Names establish the basic program for this universe. KEY 312 23-33 28 Therefore, when Enoch tells us that the heat envelope code has a thirty - six and thirty - six flow pat - tern, he is explaining the balance and sequence development for those programs sent from the Throne and being used in the ar - chitecture of this universe. In es - sence, the thirty - six and thirty - six flow pattern carries the harmonics and sets of cosmic vibrations out of which the architecture in the lower celestial regions is shaped. 29 Therefore, the deca - delta manifold oversees all recorder cell activities and a11 intra - galactic ac - tivities directly associated with the galaxy. 30 Metatron explained to me that the divine template orientating physical events within the structure of our galaxy operates through a deca - delta configuration which is the central network controlling all input operations and gradations of power necessary to sustain our galaxy. 31 The deca - delta manifold means that there are ten space - time singularities of Light interconnected with a pyramidal core memory, storing the event functions operat - ing within a11 dimensions of a galaxy. 32 For example, the deca - delta manifold is involved with: (1) the self - correcting regulations of recorder cells; (2) filter mechanisms of identification going from record - er program to recorder program; (3) registering reinforcement between programs; and (4) time - controlling mechanisms. 33 The creation of the deca- delta manifold is the formation of the central point which houses all possible evolutionary systems de-"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"KEY signated by the Creator Elohim for one galactic network- Through the deca - delta manifold it is possible to evolve the various branches of star populations, working like hands on a galactic clock set in motion. 34 Though the deca - delta man - ifold establishes the sequence of models of successive evolutionary phases, behind this activity of se - quence advancement, there are seven hasmal (Light) energies which move the color index of a given star system into a changing luminosity and star membrane pattern. 35 These energies are the con - trol mechanisms which determine the sequence phase of star creation, as well as the radius of the mem - brane pattern. The hasmal energies shape the radius so as to allow for a balance of qualities to take place with respect to the program. 36 The radius of each of the seven star populations is sustained by energy envelope bands which are issued from the seven hasmal Light energies. These envelopes maintain the framework for the seed forms and provide the basic resilience for the seed forms as they penetrate into the worlds to evolve creation. (These bands allow the seeds to penetrate even the worlds under the control of nega - tive thought - forms). 37 These seven hasmal Light energies are like a free - floating sys - tem that can be moved around any stellar creation in such a way as to attune the color index of a star or star system to any sequence phase which can support a new manifes - tation of intelligence. 38 In the propagation of new stellar models within the movement of a galaxy? the hasmal effect on the light shells of a star (already in existence) allows the star to keep its original symmetry while it inter - connects with other star models. This primary symmetry (the seven - fold pattern plus the central pro - gram) is the basic formation inher - ent in all stars which allows them to interpenetrate and recombine with other stars or star systems. 39 Therefore, these seven unique light energies allow for transformational activities to take place within the seven energy shells of the grid network which are programmed by the recorder cell command. 40 These seven hasmal energies can also come directly from the Elohim and connect to any of the seven branches, or star clusters. This is only done when it is neces - sary to reestablish the harmonics of the recorder cell to be in accord with the Father's program. 41 This universal updating is necessary because in the lower worlds of creation, entropy is in - trinsic to the main sequence of star evolution and, therefore, requires that the programs given by a Cen - tral Control to the recorder cell be updated to prevent degenerate processes of star populations. 42 Consequently, to prevent this degenerate phase, the Higher Evolution has the capacity, through these hasmal energies, to place a greater star grid around stars that are going through a degenerate phase so as to reenergize and re - model the latter by the energy field of a more evenly balanced se - quence phase. 43 In essence? in our galactic system, a cubic grid of light is brought down around a star which is about to go through a degenerate phase. This is done by superior hasmal Light energies which con - trol the star's internal structure and temperature range. 44 This prevention of the de - generate process in a star system is begun by sending the I AM life codes of the seven hasmal thresholds to the I AM energies of the seven light shells encompassing a star. This creates a reaction through a bombardment of light codes which control hydrogen fu - sion on various levels of a star's body, affecting the circumference of the star cluster, and the internal light timing mechanisms of organic evolutionary systems. 45 Therefore? the seven hasmal energies are the external time reac - tors which can recode the seven in - ternal Light codes given by the deca - delta manifold and the recorder cell. 46 Seven, as a hasmal code, at - taches the luminaries of all of the seven threshold controls with seven internal light codes within the biological system, the planetary system and the star system. 47 The seven hasmal Light energies then become the linkage between the spin orientation and the gravitational energy, breaking the magnetic field structure with multiple lines of force coming from the hasmal energies. Thus, the energy codes can prevent the star from completing a degenerate range. 48 Within this period of mutual programming, a holding pattern of cubic space is necessary. Without this holding pattern to protect man, it would be fatal to our physical KEY body to experience the accelerated high energy collisions and particle projections exploding, and then passing into one side of our bodies and out the other during high energy regeneration. 49 During this \" holding posi - tion \" the network of our star intel - ligence is coded to operate within the Cosmic Law of our Father universe, which is the Ten Commandme nts . 50 These are the ten Light superscripts which, through a heat envelope code, establish the deca- delta manifold. They provide the sustaining force of life; therefore, they existed before the world of physical form. 51 On a collective basis of ex - pansion from three - to - nine dimen - sional networks, the ten picto - graphs are coded into the chemis - try of all evolving star systems through light superscripts - the cen - tral coding for the electrochemical brain of star populations, and the rhythmical cycles of star creation. 52 They were also originally in - scribed into the consciousness of man, but due to the confusion of his identity, man was not able to renew his biological universe through their power. 53 However, the Higher Evolu - tion can use the Ten Command - ments (in the form of ten pyrami - dal grids) to adjust the physics of the biophysical and astrophysical programs. 54 The Ten Commandments which Moses received on Mount Sinai are fire projections from YHWH's I AM that I AM which are part of a resonance pattern con - tinually transmitting levels of Cos - mic Law."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"KEY 3 55 The superscripts are the ac - tivity of the Divine Mind, coding the primary diagrammatic teachings into the deca - delta manifold. They are placed there by the Divine Mind so that all hyper-syn- chronized creations within the galaxy have a Divine deca - delta model to follow, which corresponds to each successive state of creation. 56 Therefore, \" divine creation \" begins not with the galactic deca - delta model but from the divine Names which not only unfold programs of Elohistic creative power, but emanate ten Light superscripts which are composed of trinitized deca - delta patterns bring - ing forth the strength and beauty of YHWH. This allows each deca - delta manifold to represent the al - mighty power of the Father in the supreme ordering of creation, on every level of being unfolded from the deca - delta system. 57 When I was before the Throne of the Father, I saw how the Throne was composed of Trinities of Paradise Lords of Light. These Lords of Light are, them - selves, a living trinity of deca - delta relationships which seed \" the pri - mary pictographic forms of the Ten Commandments u - the governing mathematical values, along with pyramidal radiations for the chronographic structures and basic geometries for all spherical pat - terns. 58 Around the Paradise Trini - ties, I beheld the beautiful interplay of prismatic colors which are used by Paradise Sons of Light in work - ing with the Ten Commandments. 59 The Ten Commandments are the basic blueprint for expressions of different expansions of creation. They show how the divine thought - forms can be excited into action. 60 These ten superscripts are the fabric of God's thought - forms harmonizing the vehicles of crea - tion so that divine intension and divine extension operate as one unity. 61 The Ten Commandments allow for the composure and equanimity among the orders of \" divine creation \" so that we can approach God. They assure that the Family of intelligence, unified by divine teachings, has the prerogative to continue as a \" Fam - ily of Light \" for aeons in the Infi - nite Way of Love. 62 In our reality structure, they are coded within everyone, but their verisimilitude to the divine thought - forms has to be re - awakened. 63 Thus, when the degenerate processes of consciousness are transformed, there is immediate recognition thiough the chemical language that this is God's Law. This is what is meant by \" all heads shall bow \" as we cross our Omega point, for all will recognize the preexistent pyramidal grids of Di - vine Law which have been coded into them through superscripts. 64 For this reason physical cre - ation is a necessary part of \" divine creation. \" The Ten Commandments are ten pyramidal grids of astro - harmonics used to code man, as a space - filling substance, on the Magnetic grids which shape the embryonic lines of growth into per - fect mathematical units of living membrane tissue and cellular form. 65 By knowing how to use dif - ferent Magnetic grids and harmonic controls, as energy structures in the life plasma, the Elohim recreate the original Adamic codes which are stored within the recorder cell. This allows them to determine the final shape of an organ or biological regulator which is programmed to send out signals for additional programming when the biological form has reached the stage of either \" negative \" entropy, chemical destruction, or further advance - ment. 66 In the lower heavens, the divine superscripts operate within a thirty - six and thirty - six flow pattern for the music of the spheres. Seventy - two open - ended scales of vibration propagate the emanations of divine thought into material form. The thirty - six and thirty - six flow pattern is a storehouse for harmonics in our universe. It sends out special music to each sphere in order to code it within the deca - delta harmonics and the necessary vibratory shapes. 67 Metatron said that it is through the regulating controls of the deca - delta system that life con - tinues into the image and similitude. And it is the deca - delta system which sustains and creates the harmonics and the astro - harmonics to determine new levels of magnetism which account for why the embryo divides, why the cell structure divides into given patterns, and why the embryologi - cal lines proceed to evolve into a given shape beyond singular rel - ativity. 68 The tetrahedron wave model is the primary model used by the deca - delta system in our universe to control the basic table of our life system within the electromagnetic KEY 312:65-74 spectrum. 69 In the creation of most phys - ical universes, however, there are energy vacuums and different res - onances which do not allow for di - vine prototypical creation to take place. Hence, this prevents the cor - rect transcription of Divine lan - guage from the higher heavens into new regions of space. In some cases, even if the codes are prop - erly transcribed, the energy fre - quencies once given, unfortunately, cannot be sustained. 70 Thus, in the myriad realms of divine creation, there are multi - ple gradations of reception to the divine image forms. Each level of reception allows for greater or les - ser energy radiations which give a pattern of energy filling space within the image space of the 'higher membrane. \" 71 In circumstances of limited reception, which account for nine- tenths of the physical universes, divine intermediaries, known as the B'nai Elohim, are required to use the Eye of Horus' creative power to establish a particular form of evolu - tion within the Divine program. 72 However, even here the work of the Divine blueprint is lim - ited and the Masters must incar - nate, like Moses, to reveal the Di - vine Universal Law, and the Divine Commandments. 73 The B'nai Elohim perform the individual functions which the collective Mind chooses not to work with for the generation of in - dividual forms of physical creation. 74 The B'nai Elohim must pro - ject their thought - forms into the individual fields to see if it is pos - sible to connect a \" divine image \" with the free - floating life experi-"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"ence which is either spontaneous in origin and, therefore, without a di- vine grid or limited to imperfect creation which carries a damaged or defective Light shell from imper - fect divine Masters. 75 These are the two major error factors working within mil- lions of stochastic possibilities within the expansion of physical universes. 76 Limited spontaneous creation also can arise from the combina- tions of floating amino acids which are elemental life forms remaining from the discharge of Light energy coming from newborn star systems of divine Light. These create the patterns working with experimental programs of creation. 77 The combination is spon- taneous in so far as life and light forces are uniquely combined, so as to create, by themselves, a program of evolution. 78 This spontaneous program is not a subprogram to any previous physical and spiritual system of predestination. Therefore, it must eventually decide for itself, as it expands, what relationships and what networks it chooses to work with as it experiences unfoldment within the eternal unfoldment. 79 At that time these systems can only be repaired and perfected by the B'nai Elohim and/or Elohim who can use the combinations and vibrations of Divine letters with the vibrations of the Magnetic spheres to forge a secondary grid of nu- cleogenesis. 80 This is forged to correct the thought-forms which were imper- fectly \" cultivated \" in the aeons of material existence. 81 In terms of our place within the genesis of our immediate uni - verse of creation, we are one branch of seven basic branches of our galactic tree of life. 82 The human manifestation of the Adam Kadmon exists on one of the entropic star branches which is burning in the midst of this cre- a tion. 83 In essence, the Book of Genesis explains our Adamic star seed creation in relationship to our \" tree of life \" within the many mansion worlds of the heavens. 84 It tells of how the Adamic Race was projected on the Seventh Ray from the divine template in the midst of the garden of creation to an outer arm of our galactic Sea of Crystal. However, the Adamic pro- jection was intercepted and limited by fallen angelics. 85 Yet the work of the higher I AM presence was retained by the Adamic seed because the corres- ponding Overself did not fall, but remained in conjunction with the divine image and similitude. Out of this divine conjunction the Office of the Christ was able to appear on the planet. 86 The divine I AM Overself did not fall because it was not localized within any one particular recorder cell but had the collective image-making capacity working with the Elohim. 87 Unlike the other pre - Adamic creations which lost their spiritual - genetic biostratus, the Over- self of the Adamic creation retained the coupling between the seven light shells of the Divine I AM and the extended seven light shells of its physical world so as to continu- ally code a divine I AM presence into the chemical seed of creation, as the extended Divine Seed. 88 This continual coding was able to take place through the superior genetic seed categories known as the Sethian, Enochian, Noachian, and Davidic lines. 89 These purer seed categories were necessary so that the right spiritual capacity and genetic capac- ity could counterbalance the imper - fect human chemistry. Through this physical verisimilitude of the Adam Kadmon, the Lords of Light of the Office of the Christ could walk upon the earth, according to the divine seed of David, but not the seed of Adam. 90 For this reason it was also necessary for the Elohim Councils of Light to carry away, from the physical plane, the body of the physical Adam which had to be re- generated according to a more per- fect program of the spiritual- physical Adam Kadmon. A new program had to be later initiated to go beyond the 'seed programs' and to show how 'the conversion of Light' into chemical creation could be restored to the earth plane with new light functions for the cell membrane structure. This was ex - emplified in the bodies of Moses, Jesus and Elijah which were sent into the world to show humanity that the human vehicle in unity with the Overself could actually transcend the biological grids of the human experience. 91 And as a witness to this re - vealed truth, Metatron explained to me that the seven biochemical shells of Moses and Jesus, used during their earth ministry, are coded in the Great Pyramid, which is a model of the deca-delta grid that will be used again in the res- urrection of the human experiment. KEY 332:88-97 92 Metatron said that the return of Elijah, who retained his physical body by being taken into Mer- , kabah, was necessary to open the Pyramid and activate the grid net- work for the new reprogramming. 93 This will take place at that time when the Paradise Trinity will allow the Hierarchy, which controls the Higher Evolutionary seed worlds, to externalize within the seven branches of the galactic tree of life. 94 Then, the heavenly Adamic seed within the galactic garden of creation will be the \" lampstands \" (Light sources) representing the new program of the Living Light. Each galactic region will receive a cleansing as it is empowered by this new light focus coming from the Elohim through the galactic \" tree of life. \" 95 Since the genetic relativity is created within the membrane radius, the physical transmigration of form requires the Higher Evolu - tion to carry on positive centropic activity within the radius of a given star. This is because the physical transmigration of form cannot go beyond that membrane radius without being recoded into the membrane of the neighboring stel - lar model. 96 The evolutionary model for programming our galaxy must pro - vide a consistency, whereby the quanta levels of consciousness ad- vancement are coordinated with their respective biological sub- strates, and uniquely balanced in relationship to the recorder cell so that they do not interfere with other biological programs sharing the same life space. 97 It is important at this time"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"KEY 372 97-107 for man to understand conscious - ness regeneration taking place through a quanta deck of light.

They do this by using the chemical vibratory shells around the body as a semi - conductor over - lap between the Adamic Overself recorded within the deca - delta manifold and the Adamic human self (indwelling biotransducer). This produces a perfect pairing between the biotransducer substrate and the Overself consciousness which al - lows for all biological coordinations to be balanced within Man, as a solid - state creation for his ongoing consciousness. 101 Moreover, this process con - nects the timing mechanisms of the seven physical force fields, each having their own time line, with the seven code mechanisms for higher evolutionary growth within the deca - delta manifold. 102 The seven divine light shells which exist as multiple sets around the body are also extended to the seven chakras as the inner chemical shells. 103 All of this allows the Higher Evolution to code con - sciousness from orders of physical creation into purer creative combi - nations through forty - nine inter - mediate states, which allows for the final conversion of biological ac - tivity into consciousness activity for progression from one star quanta deck to another. 104 According to Metatron these forty - nine intermediate stages of consciousness synthesis are created by an electron energy underrolling (non - lateral tunneling) of biological light discharges into electron holes whose activities are oriented by the opposite phase. 105 The energy radiations from the deca - delta core memory system must first, however, connect with the hyperdimensional energy en - velopes surrounding planets by quantized phases of energy under- rolling. The planets receive renew - ing energy through sub - spatial pathways which are being filled with transfigured energy (i.e., processed and reclaimed energy). 106 The new energy system races against the convective energy transport or template of the higher membrane which is continuing \" to create form after its own kind \" in the space of species' evolution. 107 Finally, the arrived at form is transfigured energy which shapes the energy shell around the body acting as \" energy filling space \" which defines the new light core within the deca - delta model, beginning once again, a new evolutionary phase. 108 By being transfigured into space - time beyond conventional space - time, man can enter into ad - ditional time cells of consciousness. There he can understand how he is not limited only to his own mem - ory mechanisms and neural modifi - cation. He can understand how his body is the host vehicle to the \" Super Machine Mazzaroth,\" the quanta levels of the thresholds in our immediate universe. 109 Man must understand how the chemical storage process in our brain can be connected with any number of minds which branch throughout the galaxy with pulsat - ing consciousness grids. 110 Here the brain storage can open and connect with the fila - ments of the collective galactic brain existing in space - filling space - energy. Ill By standing in awe of the many divine minds coded into the divine template, self - realized Man understands why our star is a buf - fer which shuts out direct input and output messages emanating from the divine recorder cell, for the body is more than a host to the linear reality of one incarnation cycle. The sun as solar reactor, however, buffers output messages of the higher memory functions of simultaneous Overself programs or previous incarnations which would overload the mind and be destruc - tive to the body. 112 Your body must first be physically tempered and spiritually synthesized before it can under - stand its work now, in relationship to previous or simultaneous pro - grams of creation. Unless your KEY 322 body can work on multidimen - sional planes, you cannot receive other multidimensional levels of in- . formation without going completely insane according to this level of re - ality. Therefore, the sun is a solar reactor which is used to buffer the output messages that your mind would normally require to know where you have been or where you are in other space - time cells. 113 However, the Light of the higher luminaries is of a greater source of Light than that of the sun. It is able to reopen your thought channels so you can be re - connected through Higher Intelli - gence in advanced star fields of in - telligence, which our sun system buffers out. 114 For this reason the priests of Israel have always struggled with the priests of Baal who said 'let the mind be programmed for the worship of the sun.' To the contrary, the priests of Israel or of the Eternal Light have said 'let the mind be programmed out of the star fields of the eternal firmament, and share in the eternal sovereignty of YHWH - the Melek Shamayyim.' 115 Once the mind is made a vehicle for the force field of the higher Light in the deep network regions, the mind can actively op - erate on the wavelength or the template of that higher star intelli - gence. It will no longer be con - tained within the three - dimensional relativity or consciousness patterns where the game of earth is going around in circles. Thus, the earth intelligence remains locked in space until it is taken out of its physical paradigm by a higher astrochemical key."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"KEY 372 116-124 116 In our consciousness time zone the Brothers of Light connect the higher throne and dominion worlds of the Mazaloth and the Kuchavim with the lower physical worlds of the Mazzaroth, which are undergoing only one cycle of con - sciousness reality. 117 Thus, the translation of the characters of Light through divine letters of God's sacred Name and the formation - restoration processes of new chemical creation is the continual work of the higher Elohim Creators, who plant the higher grids of intelligence into the myriad worlds through the image of eternal transparency.

THE THIRD EYE GIVES TELETHOUGHT DISTRIBUTION WITHIN COMPATI - BLE NETWORKS WITH SPATIAL PROVISIONS. 1 This key explains how the people of Light are polarized by means of a higher radiation of Light projected into their third eye area. This allows them to see beyond the limitations of the visible light, typical of our system of rel - ativity. 2 In order to accomplish this, Man will be given (depending upon his capacity for wisdom), the ability to connect the present net - work of consciousness with the next universal network that is compatible with the education of his soul. 3 This connection is done through telethought communication, which allows Man to communicate with other galactic regions and even regions of hyperspace intelli - gence (i.e., intelligence existing beyond our dimension). 4 Therefore, telethought com - munication is the ability to pene - trate the different energy fields by means of a superior mental energy via a clear signal, focused through the third eye, which is directly connected with Gravitational waves. 5 The key tells us that there is an \" Arc of Light \" over the third eye which controls all of the basic neuron activity of the pineal gland. 6 This \" Arc of Light \" comes in through the third eye because the third eye pineal gland area controls all of the light synthesis connected with the cerebral cortex. 7 Man knows from biochemical research, that the cerebral cortex, when injected with an enzyme of serotonin, will move slightly, and rotate slowly, releasing tremendous phosphene patterns. 8 Medical research has shown the rise of enzyme activities after the onset of darkness. This can be accounted for by a small increase in the concentration of neurotransmit - ters at a time when the receptors are maximally sensitive. 9 Thus, a unique amplification and dampening system producing concurrent changes in receptor sen - sitivity and signal intensity can be shown, whereby small changes in the \" catecholamine \" concentration at the receptor sites in the brain produce 30 to 40 fold changes in enzyme activity."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"KEY 10 Under certain low - light con - ditions, commonly at night, the pineal gland becomes more sensi - tive; sunlight decreases enzyme ac - tivity. Therefore, in the proper light environment, the pineal gland has a unique transmitting apparatus which can be used to influence en - zyme actions throughout the body. 11 Specifically in telethought communication, the \" Light \" which activates the pineal gland is the Ain Soph Light and not the con - ventional light of the sun which is destructive to the memory mechanisms necessary to work with intelligence beyond our spec - trum. 12 Enoch told me that there is something in the nature of the brain which produces its own light field on a molecular level when polarized by Light radiation pat - terns. These radiations change the action of the nerve terminals on the release, and uptake (or local metabolism) of the neurotransmit - ter. 13 Thus, our neurocircuitry can produce its own light field which can be regulated into a super- sensitivity and subsensitivity with other levels of intelligence (through synaptic and post - synaptic firings) when the neurotransmitter function of the third eye area is interfaced with compatible networks of Mer- kabah activity. 14 This activated field of neurotransmission can then project and receive certain thought - forms at the site of the pineal gland re - gardless of spatial distances. This can be used in interstellar and in - terplanetary communication where direct mental contact is needed. 15 Thus, the direct relationship between the size of the universe, the diameter of the proton and man's range of vision is part of a larger mass - energy - space - time transformation which involves changes in our basic concepts'of the \" known \" universe. 16 The key teaches that the third eye is a light receptor which can be coupled to an energy from without our present known framework. Light is the grid through which and by which all higher forms of energy are trans- duced, so that Man may receive them. 17 This light grid allows the third eye to use Gravitational waves as a means of modulating language in such a way that Man's consciousness is greatly trans - formed. Thus, the Higher Evolu - tion, through their thought - forms of Light, can reprogram Man as a biotransducer subsystem through his own activated light network grid of communication, by the modulation of Gravitational waves. 18 Light, as the present mod - ulator of human life, is not far fetched - all higher consciousness states speak of 'the Light.' The key tells us that the mind, when mod - ulated by thought - forms of Light from the Higher Evolution, goes into biocoupling with that ordering of evolution, as an expression of instant media in the mind con - tinuum. 19 Accordingly, the mind pro - duces its own analytic communica - tion derived from its own network grid of different synaptic levels, which changes according to the paradigms of the consciousness layers occupied. The network of fir - ings connected with thought - forms can occur every milli - , nano - , pico-, femto - , atto-, etc., fraction of a sec - ond depending upon the coordina - tion between the worlds of physical and non - physical mental percep - tion. This sets up the linkage be - tween the spiritual and mental ac - tivities of the Brotherhoods of Light with the material worlds having \" a beginning \" and \" an end. \" 20 Quantum physicists have realized that observational energy, itself, is an inherent part of the outcome of any measurement. Yet, they must begin to understand how a mass object or level of mass reality can be changed by the energy of a projected form (or thought - form energy packet). Where thought - forms interconnect with perceptual mass, the thought - forms can influence the reality mass of an object, causing its form, structure, and dimension to be changed. 21 Hence, Enoch showed me that to the eye of the observer, a radical change takes place in the reality mass because of the percep - tual mass interacting with thought - forms. 22 You are a sender and re - ceiver like a radio crystal. Y OU can actually place your consciousness on a wavelength and project your thoughts by modulating and de - modulating your brain signals ac - cording to the communications network. 23 Higher Intelligence, in tele - thought communication with your third eye, creates what Metatron calls \" inductive linkage \" between the thought - forms (of the Higher Evolution) and your mind, provid - ing immediate contact with the Higher Evolution. KEY 313:19-27 24 Accordingly, the human mind is preset in the primary stage of creation to respond favorably to a higher language system of Light. This higher language system is ac - tivated within the human mind through polarized 'mental' contact for inductive linkage. 25 The language of telethought transmission contains the \" rebirth signals \" from structures in deep space (and hyperspace) which are fused with the chemistry of our biological system to educate our consciousness to understand com - munication from beyond our pres - ent level of reality. 26 Telethought transmission must take place because the pre - ciseness of biological signals in the human body does not allow Man to organically become in tune with the many levels of counterpoint that are necessary to work with dif - ferent biological information sys - tems, which share the same 'life space' as Man but exist on different levels of biological enumeration. Hence, the preciseness of biological language prohibits the meandering between levels and planes of cre - ative consciousness reality, because the biological languages are based on locked - in information which does not permit creative interface between different consciousness layers. 27 Thus, telethought communi - cation provides a superior 'Letter - ing' using primal divine Letters (pictographs) which allow for biological reprogramming between layers of consciousness. This method of communication provides the capacity for information transfer through these projected geometries of Light which take the ambiguity"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"KEY 3 13:27-36 out of a sound-vibratory language and give language a greater mean- ing and versatility for diversifica- tion and function in life. 28 Hence, telethought com- munication is also able to directly imprint suprabiological instructions which are projected into the body of Man in order to permit the ap- propriate biological reprogramming. 29 If Man can work with the new Light inputs of the higher or- ders of intelligence, he can begin to induce enzyme reactions with com- bined delta and alpha levels of thought so as to direct his con- sciousness beyond his body. 30 Once you have been polarized by Light patterns and can receive telethought communication, your biological form may appear the same, but your body can work with multiple biological environ- ments in its three-dimensional layer of physical reality. In co- participation with the Light, you can create materializations, bio- genesis from other consciousness layers, the generation of life from non - living material, the amplifica- tion of human strength, etc. 31 In telethought communica- tion with non - physical worlds, there is no \" time-lag, \" the process - es of the brain are \" instantaneous \" provided the third eye network is compatible with the Merkabah. The mind in so far as it is communicat- ing through mass-perception (i.e., the mass of the physical energy fields), is limited to duration; however, in so far as it is com- municating through non-physical thresholds, it is limited only by se - quence in thought-forms. This means, with the proper thought- forms, there is no limitation to tele- thought communication provided the sender and the receiver have compatibility. 32 In superspace there is no be- fore, no after, no next. The se - quence in time is meaningful only in the connection of the physical self to the Overself which allows the events of the material domains, that are filtered through the human self, to connect with the Overself. DeBroglie particle waves, nuclear vibrations and emanation energy levels, thermodynamic and elastic vibrations, etc., are thus converted to the eternity domains of Light. 33 The processes of the Overself tuned into the right energy grids, with compatible networks of tele- thought communication, can in- struct the human self with signals which persist in \" real time \" by color patches of quantized brain ac- tivities which can order the ma- terial events. 34 Hence, it is highly significant that a quanta deck of consciousness events can be actually seen within a panoramic arrangement of color patches, incorporating \" future events \" in sequences. 35 In reality, the Brotherhoods of Light, within compatible net - works of the Merkabah, can oper- ate within the same spatial provi- sions and wavelengths, hidden from the human senses by a veil of molecules and atoms, which are opened by an \" Arc of Light \" over the third eye area. 36 Man, too, has mind over matter abilities, and an infinite re - sourcefulness in the interplay of Light when he seeks the Treasury of Light that Metatron reveals from the richness of Light beyond physi - cal limitation. 37 The extension of mass, time and space are time dependent, yet these components are a collective subset of a greater universe. Per - ception detectors themselves act as point detectors and when inte - grated over active volumes and \" time gates, \" show that we can measure momentum in a quantum mechanical system with high preci- sion. 38 The key here is saying that space, time and energy are pieces of a greater whole which modulates consciousness grids. These grids are so powerful that they can con - trol the realities of the third and fourth dimensions. 39 Through the pineal area, or third eye network, the framework of our biological system, operating within the dynamic aspects of Gravity waves and Light waves, can experience the boundaries of our consciousness zone. Thus, the Brotherhoods can reprogram and educate the consciousness of Man, via his very biotransducer mech - anisms experiencing the overlap- ping of consciousness. 40 When this takes place there may not occur a pinpointing of biocoupling with the flashes of shooting phosphene explosions, light signals, etc. All there may be is a quiet super - sensitivity within the interplay of the universal mind. 41 The Brotherhoods have a way of projecting mental signals through the magnetic shielding of the earth by Light geometries so that they can be picked up by our mind's perceptual apparatus. Yet, this would not be possible if Light were not the foundation through which and by which all higher forms of energy are transduced. KEY 313 37 - 46 42 In clearing the space - time grid of our present physical uni- verse, Enoch said that the mind must go through certain basic transformations. According to the Eastern scriptures, these basic transformations consist of nine basic pathways you have to work through in your consciousness evolution in order to create a com- patible network for spatial provisions.Thus, the time-locks in the mind are thrown open. 43 First, in creating a compati- ble network for spatial provisions: You go through what the early Tibetan teachings call 'The Way of Shen of the Prediction' (while you are within the mental pathways controlled by the servomechanisms or 'seraphs' who control the mechanical imagery of the mind). 'The Way of Shen of the Predic - tion' is also called 'phyva-gsen theg - pa.' 44 In this process, your mind sees the events of cause and effect and begins to transcend these events which make up the mechanistic barrier. Here the mind is aided to go beyond the 'static levels' into living divinity with YHWH. 45 Second, in creating a com - patible network for spatial provi - sions: You go through 'The Way of Shen of the Visual World' (still within the mental pathways con- trolled by 'seraphs') or 'snan-gsen theg - pa.' 46 In breaking through the mechanistic functions of the visual world, the material form is seen as \" the housing \" for superior con- sciousness states.

This means that as the cycles of natural phenomena become fas - ter or slower, or as the phenomena being studied in the physical self become impossible to observe with your unaided senses, your mind will connect with the projected im - agery of the messengers and guides observing and calculating your spiritual evolution. 51 Fifth, in creating a compati - ble network for spatial provisions: You go through 'The Way of Virtu - ous Adherers' (within the mental pathways controlled by the 'Ophanim') or 52 In receiving the projected imagery from the Brothers of Light, you can turn your mind from the affairs of the world and arouse feel - ings of joy because of your salva - tion over the material body of form. This is accomplished through the identification of your body of light with the spiritual intelligence that will guide your mind through the interplay of the higher and lower worlds. 53 As your mental energy takes the quantum projection towards the Mid - Heavens, from the edge of our consciousness time zone, the cycles of the infinitesimal particles within the nucleus of the atom become so rapid that their vibrations per sec - ond are reckoned up to 54 Sixth, in creating a compati - ble network for spatial provisions: You go through 'The Way of the Great Ascetics' (within the mental pathways controlled by the 'Ophanim') or 'dran - sron 55 These yet - to - be explored frontiers are the worlds of your immediate Overself which is itself evolving towards pure divinity.

In the beginning, I saw two extended golden pyramids pulled apart so that only their conic focal points overlapped forming a diamond at their points of intersec - tion. 9 I was told that this was a model of chemical and electrical double bonding which brought to - gether in one grand view: (1) the universal movement of waves; (2) the waves fulfilling amplitudes de - fined by rectangular hyperbolae; (3) the resulting gravitational cones; and (4) the concepts of wave fields as the locus of intersection so as to encircle the volume of interlocking chemical and electrical patterns of creation. 10 In the process of creation, an elliptical ring can be formed (for creative control) from the double bonding of many of these pyrami - dal forms. 11 Many pairs of these pyrami - dal light forms come together to form a compacted ring of energy shells in space which are elongated to allow a large measure of inner space. Within this inner space, the centrifugal actions of the surround - ing light forms give rise to the be - ginnings of the galactic form. 12 These pyramidal light forms contain the basic codes of the ma - terial cycles of creation, and pro - duce the chief waves and reso - nances to that end. Some of these basic codes, in fact, can proceed to sophisticated levels of evolution through their own image - making process without the use of a divine image. (It should be understood that the image of the human or humanoid form can be created from spontaneous creation; how - ever/ Man, as Adamic Man, is only created from the divine image of the Throne.) 13 I saw how the ring of pyramids fired light structures like sparks which work with various sets of gravitational flux energy to produce precise star patterns which, in turn, produce their own electrification of matter within the spheres. (This does not exclude spontaneous forms of creation com - ing even from their encompassing space quanta not generated from these pyramidal assemblies of light.) 14 I was shown by Metatron how the spontaneous forms of cre - ation pass through the appropriate nucleogenesis stage, reaching a point of critical mass, which then equals the span of maxima1 and minimal star creation. These stellar movements transform levels of primordial star creation into planets by organizing the beginning and end of a material strata. This trans - formation is the interaction of nuc- leogenesis with the primary code factors which give rise to their own plan of \" beginning and end. \" 15 The then newly formed stars and planets contain a core center which is interpenetrated by an elongated primary cone within a shorter secondary cone operating in pairs, creating a bipolarity. When this takes place the spheroid achieves proper rotational balances commensurate with the energy flow of the conic sections. This generates the appropriate star and planetary tables within spheroid balances of a given creation. 16 The bipolarity operates simi - lar to electrodynamic attraction, where the direction of the flow is reversed and the cosmic needle (eye) of bipolarity changes. The ends of the needle attract each other by the interpenetration and congruence of their moving waves. This shows the direction of the larger surrounding set. 17 To be able to suspend one side of the pull, when mutual at - traction is observed! is a very im - portant criteria for the checks and balances of physical planetary rota - tion. Presently, this can be dem - onstrated on the earth plane by electrodynamics, but not gravita - tion. Yet, both electrodynamics and gravitational waves are at work, and their laws fully made out ac - cording to inverse squares in free space. 18 The law of inverse squares is applicable for a particular point, where the magnetic attractions are simplest in the monopoles, (or the inverse cube for dipoles), where the magnetic force follows the same laws as in the case of gravitation. 19 Let us keep in mind that Gravitation, magnetism! and most other forces in space are due to moving waves between stellar and interstellar matter. 20 The grasp of certain laws of the universe is facilitated if we have a distinct picture, of the invis - ible operations before us. 21 The light cones activate the electrochemical bonding, setting in motion resonance in the ethers KEY 314 15 - 28 which allows for the coupling of bodies and molecular components in universal gravitation, and the . resonance factors which affect atomic structure. 22 Light cones create the reso - nance for the relative motions of coupled bodies in a wave - field which allows for the electrification of matter and its span in relation - ship to gravitation and magnetism. 23 The electrification of matter produces an interconnecting com - plex network containing energy grids of astrochemical coupling. 24 The coherent patterns of light emanations are then sustained by overlapping multiple conic sec - tions. This allows for the light cones to penetrate and establish their place within three - dimensional grid networks. 25 These complex grids function like a series of Lagrange hyper - bolae composing many different magnetic patterns through energy distribution, exemplifying the law of inverse squares. (This distribu - tion is one of the ways coherent pat - terns of light are generated.) 26 The ellipsoidal grid of stars and the gravitational flux line movements are directly tied into given planets through these conic sections of Light. 27 Explaining this further, these light cones can have super- centropic functions whereby the rec - tangular hyperbolae of fields about a star cluster, solar system or planet are created/ establishing an interconnecting force of universal gravitation and the operations of waves pervading nature. 28 The light cones operate in pairs establishing a bipolar mechanism where conic sections"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"KEY 314: 28 - 38 (which have opposite attraction) are drawn together connecting the center of a terrestrial spheroid with the poles of cosmic magnetics. 29 Through these magnetic fields of the local physical universe, it is possible to transfer energy back and forth in \" time, \" and back and forth between distant space- points without any time lapse in between. 30 However, the evolutionary worlds are limited in their growth cycle for there is a certain critical limit beyond which they cannot pass without receiving a divine image. They are allowed to proceed to various levels of evolution through their own image - making process until they expand into the greater regions of the spiritual uni - verses, at which time the Cosmic Law of the spiritual universes be - comes dominant. - 31 Therefore, it is in this cre - ation of the physical worlds that the ground structure is laid for the ultimate transplanting of the recor - der cell and the deca - delta man - ifold which dispenses the celestial thought - forms of the image pro - gram, which will interface with the correct wavelength of specie evolu - tion. 32 It is the deca - delta which brings the image space of divine unfoldment from the Father, setting the threshold out of which the image of the Adam Kadmon ap - pears. 33 Thus, the Father's divine image is necessary to sustain the space of the Alhim (higher) particle charges which in turn control the space quanta necessary for the materialization of the Adam Kad- mon. 34 Metatron said this process of the dispensing of the image pro - gram insures that the thought- forms controlling the synthesis of the divine image space working with the units of tonventional space, do not come from just any higher form of intelligence, but from a center of spiritual command called a \" throne. \" The \" throne \" governs many divine templates and apportions specific programs of the Father in conjunction with the Councils of Elohim. The Elohim, in turn, project Light cones from the Throne which renew the \" begin - ning and the end.'' 35 The Elohim, by projecting an elongated primary cone within a shorter secondary cone, going the same direction, use the inverse square function to control light dif - fusion and establish the link be - tween ether waves, magnetism, and a series of light cones. These create the new \" beginning and the end \" of consciousness within grav - ity sets, controlling meta - material creation. 36 The human brain utilizes electron and positron energy which is sustained by the image wavelength of the Adam Kadmon which, in turn, gives a certain spa - tial order to the functions of image and similitude in the human cre - ation. 37 Ultimately, it is the image space of the Adam Kadmon which is connected with the higher man - sion worlds known as the \" thrones and dominions'' seen by the As - cended Master Paul when he was taken into \" the third heaven. \" 38 Metatron pointed out that the negative spiritual intelligence would attempt to interfere, jeopar - dizing the current signal of the Adam Kadmon on the physical plane of creation, if it were not for the Father's sustaining image of all-encompassing Love. 39 During the early stages of our program of \" beginning and end, \" there did occur a fall of the image of the Adam Kadmon which limited the divine plan of the Shekinah. This Fall took place by interference from the fallen angelics who prevented the advanced spiritual form from combining with the Tohu- Wa-Bohu (formlessness and void). Instead, they took por - tions of the atomic and subatomic structures and cast these portions into their own image which did not reflect the holy presence of the Father. 40 Therefore, there were some atomic and subatomic structures in our local universe that were within the plan of Divine order, and there were some that were not within the plan, out of which sprang the physical cells of \" fallen fields which circulated the energies of the anti - universe. \" 41 Moreover, the fallen intelli - gences also manipulated the elec - trons of the original image space. And by manipulating electrons they took possession of all of the tiny spaces surrounding an electron. 42 Therefore, they left the elec - tron spaces intact so they could produce subelectron current signals through the spaces surrounding the electrons which were then used to jam the biological coding mechanisms. 43 Thus, it has been the work of the Ascended Masters who have KEY 314 38 - 40 come to this planet from the Office of the Christ, to show Man that he has a divine sensitivity to Light and can use l i ght on the earth pIane to prepare for work with the divine image space. 44 According to Metatron, the divine image space, Batsalmaynu, is more important than the \" begin - ning and the end \" in the meta- material order. For the \" beginning and the end \" are merely points in the sea of the Eternal. 45 Even though the \"beginning and the end \" determines the im - mediate program of consciousness evolution, the Higher Evolutionary life structures should not be thought of simply in terms of a time of beginning and end. 46 Our wavelength of beginning and end must, ultimately, be placed within the higher wavelength of Light working with divine ultra - structures, that deter - mine the appropriate wavelength of specie evolution and the wavelength of the chemistry, used for the next spiral of life. 47 Therefore, it is the wavelength of Light which allows for the connection between all levels of physical chemistry in our Father universe. 48 Even where the spontaneous physical interactions allow for chemical and electrical double bonding, there still must be a higher resonance within the wavelength of Light if molecular spin orientation is to connect with ionic fields and valency levels in the recoding of life structure into continual life structure. 49 The human brain is the cen - tral control for the body receiving the Adam Kadmon image"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"KEY 314 49-62 wavelength which provides the override for all electrochemical bonding done in the name of the divine image. 50 Since the cell surfaces of the brain are impermeable for certain ions forming electric double layers, a current flowing through the tis - sue will produce an accumulation of ions on the semi - permeable membranes and a counter elec - tromotive force is formed. 51 Thus, polarized tissues act like semi - conductors showing a cer - tain polarization capacity. 52 This semi - conducting circuit is the primary circuit connected with electrochemical double bond - ing within the body. 53 Electrochemical double bond - ing provides the wave signal for the polarization index that deter - mines the capacity for light reso - nance and the formation of molecules determining their config - uration. 54 This key of electrochemical pyramidal double bonding shows how bonding controls the thermo - static spatialization and the funda - mental quantum mechanics on which resonance is based. Hence, pyramidal double bonding controls the points that are in resonance af- finity within the body. 55 The attachment of the image space follows a resonance that is sent out from the recorder cell (or Merkabah activity) which must compute the resonance of molecules among several electronic structures, giving the inner config - uration of the molecule (i.e., the nuclei) which must remain constant during the electronic transmission. 56 It is this composite structure, working through conventional space and hyperspace, that deter - mines the functions of the equilib - rium configuration and the modes of oscillation for the molecules. 57 Steady state patterns of energy flow must be maintained regardless of the spacing of the ionization, so that a configuration of the recorder cell (like a circuit diagram) can be transplanted into the image space counterpart operat - ing on levels of electronic transmis - sion. 58 The understanding of this mode of transmission from the re - corder cell shows how the theory of resonance can be applied to many problems in future chemistry which deal with chemical image overlap. 59 Through a projection of Light coming from the recorder cell (or Merkabah activity), selected in - dividuals can be reconnected with the Adam Kadmon image through a resonance operating through hyperdimensional space. 60 And, at this time, those in - dividuals who have not had the di - vine image can be opened to re - ceive the image of the Adam Kad- mon. 61 Some individuals receive an additional high frequency reso - nance transmission operating in parallel phase with their normal resonance bonding. This additional high frequency resonance operates as a subcarrier (through these indi - vidual biotransducers) to modulate paranormal energies. 62 This explains how paranor - mal gifts can be received through the resonance of hyperdimensional space which, in turn, can change the molecular arrangement of ma - terial in conventional space. 63 By adjusting the conven - tional resonance patterns there can be a molecular infall, or biolocation; and through hyperconjugation (no - bond resonance) the release of tremendous energy results in the changing of molecular structure (e.g. melting of structure, discorpo- ration and reincorporation of form, etc.). 64 Here also the human can ad - just the functions of biochemical resonance within the body to gen - erate a series of pyramidal pulses which can unite with other mental wavelengths. 65 Moreover, as this high fre - quency resonance becomes aligned with the biotransducer system of the body, the seven chakras can be completely transfigured into the divine image. 66 In order to show me the full implications of this key, Metatron took me into Merkabah where I was shown how the whole evolutionary resonance pattern of Man is modeled in stone along the length of the Nile. 67 More specifically, the Nile, from the region of On to the region of Abu Dis, acts as the spinal col - umn connecting the grids of the eight pyramidal temple areas with the eight chakras working with the human body. 68 I was shown how there was a whole electrochemical blueprint of the body imprinted in stone and how each temple area had, coded in stone, the function of elec - trochemical double bonding. 69 The importance of this rests in the fact that the whole mem - brane of human mtelligence on this planet meets precisely at these eight energy grids of Light which KEY 314 63 - 75 are to be opened up and under - stood as Man is graduated to go into the next electrochemical fre - quency. 70 I was shown how the pres - ent electromagnetic program con - trolled by the Council of Nine is symbolized at Giza. 71 Giza was the region of the Council of Nine, represented by nine pyramids keyed into the \" Pyr - amid of Cheops \" which contains the codes for the Foundation Stone, the Eben Shettiyah. The Pyramid of Cheops, which is a tetrahedron (within an octahedron), is a perfect model for the carbon atom, the model for the material grid of all living organisms on this planet. 72 In addition, within the pyramidal grids of Giza are the code models of all the physical constants of the solar continuum upon which our physical evolution is predicated. 73 All spiritual and mathemati - cal knowledge is modeled in the Great Pyramid. It is also the point of convergence for all the major time warp areas throughout the world. Therefore, it is at this point on the earth that all of the geomagnetic grids on the earth converge to receive the capstone. 74 The Great Pyramid also de - fines with great accuracy 'the direc - tion of our galactic movement' and gives the meridians where the Galactic Pole, the Celestial Pole, and the Ecliptic Pole become one unity in the precession of the equinoxes. 75 Thus, the Pyramid at Giza exemplifies the recorder cell known to man as the seventh chakra, for there the Lords of Light have coded the necessary information to"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"KEY 314 77 - 87 enable the evolution of man to find its ultimate linkage. 76 It is from the Great Pyramid that man must understand the im - portance of On as the Academy re - sponsible for the building of tem - ples along the magnetic centers of the world. 77 Therefore, On represents the eighth Chakra, the creative power which is necessary to transplant creation from one level to another. The Academy of On represents the spiritual - scientific synthesis prepar - ing the astronomy of the world to accept the energy capstone which will ultimately be returned to the Great Pyramid of Giza and its cor - responding centers. 78 On, the \" city of the Sun, \" at the mouth of the sacred Delta, is the Key for the divine Deca - Delta system. On, also, represents the eighth chakra (the higher coding mechanism) through which knowl - edge is implanted into the human experience. 79 According to Enoch, the priest - scientists who built Stonehenge were sent out from the Academy of On to establish a worldwide network to be centered in Giza - the major geophysical timepiece of the world. 80 The sixth chakra (the intellec - tual grid), accordingly, is rep - resented at Memphis, the \" city of Ptah. \" Memphis is to be viewed in terms of the \" White Wall \" which was built to protect the Delta - the head piece. 81 In terms of astronomy, Memphis exemplifies the twenty- four sacred sarcophaguses of the \" Apis Bull \" representing Taurus- Orion and the twenty - four ele - ments of the Mind behind the throne and dominion worlds. The twenty - four also represent the spiritual civilizations in space that have left their seed on the earth. 82 Memphis is the city of \" re - birth. \" Rebirth must come through the Deca - Delta divinely cast in the \" ten great Lords \" who were chosen to guard the Delta. 83 I was then shown the sacred area of the fifth chakra (the voice resonance grid), which was Abydos, the place addressed to Osiris with the following words: \" Thou art the great one in Abydos, thou art the Morning Star of Heaven to which Horus of the Tuat has given his body. \" 84 Abydos represents the tomb of Osiris, where the vibrations of the Word of God quicken the body to rise from the dust and put on the imperishable crown of Light - from the Lords of Light in Orion. 85 Then, I was shown how Karnak is the place of the fourth chakra or heart chakra, for it shows how the \" heart beat \" modeled in the fifth socket of the Great Pyramid gives the \" golden propor- tion \" built into the major temples of the world. 86 The Avenue contains forty ram - headed Sphinxes which exem - plify the Gematria of \" forty \" . Here, \" forty \" represents the Gematria of \" perfect sacrifice \" (forty days of Lent, etc.). This is given by the Ram, symbolic of the Pleiades, the sacred blood that was to take the place of man's blood offering. This Avenue represents the activation of the blood crystals through solar radiations exemplified in the body of the solar lion (the human). 87 The \" opened tomb \" of Prince Amen - Herkhepeshef at Karnak shows the transition from the common light cycle to the man - ifestation of the Living Light, and the story of converting the sub - stratum of life into the very Body of Light! Indeed, Karnak represents the life transition from the common logarithm to the interplay with the Living Light. 88 I later recalled how Thebes appeared to me to be the third chakra area (the navel connecting with the cycle of the earth), for it contains all of the underground tombs and sepulchre passages in the Tombs of the Queens and No - bles and in the Valley of the Kings. 89 I also saw this as the intesti - nal tract processing all functions of life and death shared between upper and lower Egypt. 90 I was then shown that Abu Simbel represents the second chakra. It is here that the Hall of Pillars and the region of the tower - ing colossi and Re-Harakhi repre - sent the fertility of the earth being bathed with the golden light of the Sun. The towering colossi indicate that we are offspring of God through the Lords of Light. 91 They are situated - in the \" center of the earth \" - to show the cycles of transplanting man amongst the giants of the universe! 92 Finally, I was shown the first chakra in the region of Abu Dis, the place at the base of the spinal column which, in the blueprint of man, is the place of the primal energy change. Abu Dis is the in- KEY 314 87 - 96 struction of Ptah and the Gods coded into crystal. Abu Dis exem - plifies the quartz crystal texts which illustrate the piezoelectric ef - fect. This activity shows how crys - tals can be used as the (primal energy) charge for the necessary 'stimulation,' causing the con - sciousness to enter and leave the body. 93 Thus, the \" beginning and the end \" is actually coded into the pyramidal structures of the earth. 94 All of these eight \" pyramidal bonding \" areas show the physical ionization flow that Man must go through before he can be resur - rected to go beyond beginning and end into the pure image of the Liv - ing Light. 95 The pyramidal model is the blueprint for the living \" double helix \" which unfolds to connect the human evolution with the higher evolution in the thresholds of \" the Treasures in the Heavens. \" 96 Beloved, witness to Man that he must first find within himself the \" treasury of life \" before he can rise beyond the cycle of repetition, the many spiritual deaths and re - births. Understand the Mind of YHWH - the One who commis - sioned the story of Man to be re - flected in the \" stone of truth \" - so that you can take the wings of the morning and enter the Treasury of the Light and be the good and faithful servant of Him who is beyond Beginning."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"4 the ' $!$$$## \"\" $ $$$'$$# *' ln ow &vrs.*&u&rm b \"$ ' $ $$$$$$$$ $'$$$ !'

The negative en tropy creates a vortex into which a11 life giving particles and their structures are dissolved unless new wave structures are introduced. Where new wave structures are introduced the carrier medium is reused. 7 As the earth begins to send 'pain signals' to the Higher Think - ing Membrane of the \" brain, \" those pain signals are heard and new wave structures of Light and Love are sent back to make the re - pairs necessary for life to continue (for the key to the life force of atomic and subatomic fields is Love). 8 New wave structures with ex - tended maser - like actions amplify the bioplasm which constitutes our evolution, so that high centropic functions can lift the negative mass directly out of the spiral of physical entropy, freeing the old chemical bonds to go on. 9 These new light structures are the life - giving intermediates which code evolution with new form. They are within the light projec - tions of all manner of spiritual in - telligence serving the Father's pro - gram. These high speed inter - mediates are not happenstance energy forms, but are energies connected with the intelligence of Light which is governing our pro - gram of creation. 10 Now at this time, new light particles are being sent into our immediate universe to work with particles already orientated towards the centropic Light spiral. 11 This is because the higher energy cannot be sent to those people unless they have the higher integrity of using it correctly. How - ever, the same energy code is given again and again until there are enough cell units to fill the space. For Man was never created in a static image, the process of Man is not through; it is a con - tinual growing into the Image of Light. 12 These new light particles will cause the span of our nuclear life system to spiral out of the old laws of nuclear systems and merge with the new energy plasma of the Higher Evolutionary position. This will allow Man to go into the image of the Higher Evolution as a \" Whole Light Being \" intelligence; he will no longer be separated from the luminaries because of the limi - tations of his physical body for he will be a transformed creation. 13 Hence, man can grow into a greater ingathering of Light. 14 The more Light he ingathers, the greater his evolution can ex - pand so that he will not be sepa - rated from the luminaries of right - eousness and love, but will be strengthened by the luminaries of righteousness in the name of right - eousness. 15 Our local universe is now experiencing the death of functions that are part - particle, part - wave, as high frequency energies elevate our nuclear structure into a new holistic wave continuum based upon a new galactic light force. 16 This will elevate spiritual man to a fifth - dimensional being as he is taken off 'the present i hydrogen - oxygen biosphere which will no longer remain a 'waterous' ulcer in our local Sea of Crystal. 17 This will take place during the change of the hydrogen matrix of our local universe which is the ground structure for our nuclear evolution. 18 The basic transduction pro - cess for the human evolution is ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate). The scale of its operations must be considered within the hydrogen matrix which is the pattern of structural organization in our im- mediate universe. The ATP is a specialized energy adaption for the human vehicle on its level of struc - tural organization. 19 ATP makes energy available for the functions of our biological system. High speed light energy particles interacting with ATP will aid in the establishment of a new hydrogen matrix for three - dimensional beings who will exist within new wavelengths of Light. 20 Hence, a new ultrastructure will exist by means of a new orbi - tal relationship of Light which will support the atomic nucleus, caus - ing biophysical and biochemical KEY 315 14 - 27 changes in the inner membrane structure (in a new hydrogen atomic relationship). 21 This key deals with new changes in the wavelength motion of an electron orbiting its atomic nucleus. It also emphasizes the spiritual - scientific teaching working with new orbital relationships around an atomic nucleus, hitherto held insoluble for chemical reac - tions of subatomic particles. 22 The key describes the conse - quence of a collision between a hydrogen atom and a hydrogen molecule where the two bond to - gether. 23 Whereas the reaction of the hydrogen molecule is the simplest of chemical phenomena, the inter - connection between the relationship of three protons to three electrons is intimately connected with the breaking of the orbital shell in pro - ton transition. 24 In the old biochemical order, each hydrogen atom had one pro - ton and one electron. However, when the hydrogen molecule and the hydrogen atom collide there is a change in the wavelength motion and a new structure may evolve. 25 This change in wavelength motion can take place in two major processes: (1) as a single atom a projects into one end of a hy - drogen molecule the end of the molecule simultaneously splits from and joins a; or (2) the atom collides in a simple elastic colli - sion with the molecule but no breakup of the molecule occurs. 26 Instead, the molecule remains intact but is sent vibrating at different rates. 27 These collisions are achieved through a tunneling effect. This"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"KEY 315 27 - 39 tunneling allows, in essence, dis - crete amounts of energy quanta to interact with another particle by jumping a threshold. 28 At times there are particles which enter into a reaction even though they lack the requisite energy level. And under such con - ditions, a threshold crossing takes place. 29 A particle, here, tunnels through the threshold energy bar - rier. The reason for this is that this small particle is part solid object and part wave function. 30 It is the wave property that enables the particle to tunnel through the energy requirement and enter into a reaction. 31 At normal temperatures, the rates at which hydrogen - hydrogen reactions occur are described by classical mechanisms and are only one third the correct rate as de - scribed by quantum mechanics. (At a temperature of below room temperature, the classical rate is eighteen times slower than the rate predicted by quantum.) 32 The new fundamental wave change pervading our life field and speeding up mechanical functions (united with quanta corpuscles of Light) will result in a new quantum mechanics. 33 The Higher Evolution uses both particulate and wave proces - ses to upgrade the direction of the human evolution on the scale of nuclear evolution. 34 The Higher Evolution can control the forming of the new molecule through vibratory inter- mediates (e. g., controlling the hy - drogen atom) so that intermediate bonding takes place between the intercrystalline invagination of life forms and the new wave forms of light. 35 Consequently, when the atom controlled by the high energy intermediates strikes the hydrogen molecule at any angle, a new type of structure will be created from the subatomic particles of the hy - drogen atom. 36 Changing the vibratory rate of the hydrogen molecule, the Higher Evolution, through a series of vibratory nodes operating as one energy projection, can raise the vibratory structure of the hydrogen molecule, etc,, without having to penetrate it. 37 This energy transformation must take place many times on the physical vibratory levels until every cell within man's body is rebuilt and transformed into a form ready to take the final leap across his energy threshold. Then he can be coded with the purer energies of consciousness. Until that time man must repeat many rounds of exis - tence within given generations. Understand that in the now, within you, you continue the biological evolution of the Light. 38 This retooling of nuclear evolution is the phase of testing being done on man who is a phys - ical transitional being. After this phase of testing, he will be able to live in regions of heavier or lighter atmospheres. He will be able to operate beyond the weak decay of particles for he will flourish within a renewing energy. 39 And once man can synthe - size an artificial molecule to operate as a superconductor at room temperature! he will be able to cs- tablish a field of artificial molecules which can be used, for example! to control low - hovering space vehi - cles. 40 The new wavelength motion which the Higher Evolution has created allows for the production of particles with new quantum num - bers without causing the new parti - cles to have charge symmetry viola - tions. 41 At this time, man can re - move the orbital shells of \" elec - trons and positrons r i as quantum (corpuscles) of light. The Higher Evolution, in response to man's experimentations, is projecting into the human environment multiple light - node resonances which will prevent violent actions from taking evolution through thermonuclear destruction. 42 However! nuclear evolution works as a solvent of the thin sur - face of membrane veils between layers of three - dimensional con - sciousness which will themselves be done away with. Thus, while nuclear evolution shares an affinity with other evolutionary systems, it ultimately advances into the purer consciousness forms of spiritual evolution. 43 In essence, this is the un- foldment of Living Light with the Holy Spirit as it interpenetrates quantum mechanical evolutionary orders with new form and attaches a function of divine purpose to the meta - material structure of the uni - verse as a Shekinah unfoldment. 44 The Holy Spirit regeneration changes extreme distortions of the spherical symmetry, found in some nuclei of atomic and subatomic par - ticles, to a perfected harmony with the consciousness programs of the Elohim. 45 Such a regeneration is, in ef- KEY 315 39 - 50 fect, the work of the Shekinah uni- verse for it allows for the direct cod - ing of the divine image onto the wave forms, to shape the particles according to the sanctified image of a Creator God. It allows for life - giving transduction to qualify for the many rounds of spiritual exist - ence in the Infinite Way. 46 ATP is the key to the whole field of biological transducton, whereby Light - giving energy can be brought through from Higher Evolutionary sources. 47 ATP is the ideal model of the transceiver system, built into the human biological system? which allows man to attach the energy he is receiving (in successive unfold- ments) with a purer unfoldment of Light. ATP is one of the energy gradients which shows us how we are basically a mechanistic molecu - lar machine! which can adapt to other vehicle bodies of energy. 48 Man is the \" energy life vehicle \" needed to bring a unique unfoldment of Light into reality on this planet. He is an assembly of life - forms on one level of \" radiance \" - containing the \" Di- vine Image \" and the \" Adam Kad- mon image r 1 ' as well as a vast network of microtubules and mitochondria. 49 Man is \" host \" for the Hosts of the many worlds of intelligence. His very presence invites the smaller organic worlds of intelli - gence to \" move in \" and \"be at rest \" in the design that God made, which allows the lowest parts of the earth \" to be woven \" according to the myriad designs of the Light. 50 Man is \" down here \" to adapt the mitochondria and amino acid functions into something that"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"KEY 3 15 50-67 is functional within the great de - sign of multi - worlds. Man's nuclei encode the outer membrane of each mitochondria, and many of the en - zymes attached to the cristae are synthesized through his biological design. 51 Thus, even in this world there is a greater \" image space \" which determines the design of biological molecules, cellular dif - ferentiation, and the overall shape of living systems in the interrela - tionship between the outer mem - brane, the inner membrane and the crystal membrane. Man himself is the repository of this \" image space'' as the unfoldment of the Adam Kadmon. 52 However, Man must see himself going into a body form, through a body form, and beyond a body form to understand just how the Light flow reprocesses every molecular and consciousness level. 53 According to Enoch, if ATP could not continually change with respect to the human vehicle, another model would be created, for the ATP mode1 operates \" in spaces'' already designed for the human experience, and these spaces must connect with the lower, as well as the higher energy spaces of Light. 54 ATP is the life antenna that receives the wave form that can collectively control the biological mechanisms, protein synthesis, and the nature of genetic coding simul- taneously from several energy con - figurations of hydrolysis. 55 Therefore, Enoch gave me an additional explanation of this key which he called a secondary key. The secondary key deals with Tripartite Energy Transduction. This energy transduction is con - nected with a biological array which is like a biological transmis - sion antenna. 56 In fact, ATP contains a symmetrical head upon a stalk and a base, which gives a schematic on the order of a keyhole configura - tion or a \" Tesla magnifying trans - mitter device. \" 57 We are part of an inner communication network which is within the inner membrane, and yet is able to work with an outer spatial matrix of a larger membrane structure which requires all the membranes? as basic building blocks, to register functions as a biotransducer subsystem. 58 This shows us, on a mic - robiological level, how the body is able to communicate as an antenna receiving Light forms of conscious - ness energy from other spatial di - mensions and converting those given forms of energy into its own bioenergy. 59 When Man is conscious of this, then he can utilize his trans- duction to make use of the fourth state of matter where he actually uses himself as part of a living crystal communication system. 60 There are certain bio- transmission processes which are similar to the Tesla \" magnifying \" transmission process which uses the energy transduction of the planet. 61 According to Metatron, in the Takla Makan Basin, towers of crystal were used by the Lords of Light who came down over 36,000 years ago. Man will discover that these Tesla - like transmitter towers, are cylinder - like resonators with pyramidal faces. These towers were resonators for the detection and amplification of the Earth's own sympathetic pulse which was used for transmission. 62 Metatron explained that the Brotherhood of Light came down in the Takla Makan Basin area to change the biological structure of a portion of the human race. There- fore, they also used their energized transducer systems to re - evolve Man through membrane invagina- tion by the use of these pyramidal crystalline forms which act as res - onant receivers. 63 They used pyramidal crystal - line forms to upgrade evolution upon the planet so that man could have the ability to communicate with other worlds of intelligence. 64 Metatron showed me how the model of ATP was like the pyramidal crystalline antennae used in the Takla Makan area for com - munication and energy transference with the Higher Evolution. 65 Man will discover, in the mysteries of the greatest archeolog - ical finds, the key notion that the pyramidal form is necessary for adaptation to energy frequencies using \"wireless\" transmission to in - terface with other wavelengths of consciousness experience. From the various types of wavelengths man will understand and use the \" mic - rowave sound i ' communication sys - tem used by the Brotherhood of Light. 66 Thus, Metatron explained to me that the energy stations within the Takla Makan Basin were used for communication, as well as biological energy transduction which restructured the human biological system. KEY 315 61 - 72 67 This energy transduction works through electron addition and subtraction, whereby the ATP adjusts accordingly the potentials of the electron charge in the system. 68 This key of Metatron tells us that the restructuring of the human system is not only towards the wedding of structure and function within the human system, but in relationship to the wedding of \" light \" structures themselves through High Energy Inter - mediates. 69 Man must first examine mitochondria given in categories of two kinds of membrane: (1) an outer membrane and (2) an inner membrane. Metatron tells us that in the process of Higher Energy In - termediates there is a third mem - brane of crystal which becomes the invagination of the inner mem - brane. 70 The crystal membrane is separate from the outer membrane but is in parallel phase with the outer membrane wall structure and is a necessary component for both the light - life structure of the inner and outer membrane to operate as one unity. 71 \"Crystal invagination\" is more than the bonding link between the structure of the outer and inner membrane, In the parallel phase of given step functions, the crystal in - vagination is the key to the life process itself that is able to inter - connect with other membrane cir - cuits. 72 Therefore, Metatron calls our attention to that network of human intelligence sending coded energy through \" High Energy Inter - mediates, \" which become inter - mediate bonding between the outer"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"KEY 375 72 - 83 membrane and the crystal mem - branes (which are the invaginations of the inner membrane). 73 On a mega level, the crystal membrane invagination works as a sacred model of a highly ordered structure of energy to connect the Light of the inner universe (sup - plied by Uriel) with the Light of the outer universe (supplied by Metatron). 74 And through the inter - mediate bonding between these membranes, the energy cycle of evolution is regenerated by the power of Melchizedek. All evolutionary forms of creation are gathered together, purified, and 'recast \" according to the synergy of the \" thought - form images \" from the Treasury of Light which God makes available to the Elohim Lords. 75 These \" thought - form im - ages \" are merged with the field structures of the Gravity compres - sion zones of light where biogravi- tational fields are connected with new cycles of Infinite Speciehood. 76 When I was before the Throne of God, I saw how tre - mendous powers of Light energy emanate from the Throne through a continual series of unfoldment processes. 77 One form of the Living Light is sent by Metatron (through the Elohim) to spatial regions which are preconditioned to establish a form of evolving intelligence that is to be directly in tune with the Father's Mind. Metatron's Light is used for the creation of the Light shells and envelopes of Light that encompass the Light forms and energies which are to emanate from the deca - delta system. 78 Thus, Metatron's Light sur - rounds the Light cones of creation used in the common light regions, and equalizes the \" faster than light \" energies around the outer side of the Light cone so that the Light cone is prepared for the im- pregnation of the crystalline net - works of Light and the inner mem - brane codes of creation from Uriel. 79 In other words, Metatron's Light deals with the \" outer realities \" of the Light cone and preconditions the structure of the Light cone for the inner Light of Uriel. 80 This is the highly ordered inner and outer membrane struc - ture used for an energy cycle of biological evolution. 81 The crystal membrane struc - ture is used because it can work with the maintenance of function on both sides of creation at the same time. Whereas the outer uni - verse, in the lower worlds, goes through entropy and chemical reorganization towards the inner universe, and the inner universe goes towards the outer, the struc - ture of crystal invagination allows for a direct attachment to both by the \" thinking membrane \" of the Orders of Light. 82 Thus, the crystal membrane is unique because it can process Light going both ways, from the outer surface to the inner and the inner to the outer, so that crystal invagination really creates the zip - per effect which can open up the universe and give the Masters of Light the ability to repair and re - generate the inner and outer struc - tures simultaneously. 83 This shows us how the Brotherhoods of Light can work as bonding shells between the uni - verses. 84 Now, as we begin to work with higher bioenergetic states and membrane functions, we will see in the various patterns of energized matter that non - energized states, as well as energized states, come to - gether through a spiraling effect which gives the shape of an energy transducing structure on the mitochondrian level. 85 Metatron is saying that the energized state, the non - energized, and the energized - twisted state are presently working in a tripartite arrangement, sending and receiving instructions. 86 ATP can reduce and change its direction through the repeating units of inner mitochondrian mem - brane. The tripartite model can be reduced to its base and be remod - eled and regenerated again into its antenna array. 87 This is the energy cycle of evolution on a Shekinah level of reality. Even in the activities of mitochondria, we must recognize that there is a Shekinah universe which takes some of the smallest functions from physical creation and allows them to be interfaced with the highly ordered structure of the Living Light. 88 This is made possible through the interplay between the Son universe and the Shekinah universe, and the Shekinah uni - verse with the Living Light powers of the Father universe, which al - lows for Infinite Speciehood. 89 This is to stress the fact that within the Infinite Plan of creation, there are many membrane circuits going on at such high speeds that one cannot clearly separate the KEY given units without destroying the whole process of the continuum it - self within that repeating phase of life. 90 This is also true of the higher spiritual nature of Man, as a thinking continuum. Man cannot separate himself from the thinking membrane of Light without throw - ing his life structure into disarray, and allowing his body, mind, and soul to be thrown into confusion if they do not work together as a tripartite model. 91 Moreover, when we take the tripartite model and adapt it to ex - perimental research with ATP, we will see how the tripartite energy reduction system works with ATP transduction in parallel phase. 92 Then we can ask the ques - tions: Does this model energize life itself? If this is a true model (i.e., unlike those of catastrophe topol - ogy and discontinuous function) can it be run in reverse? 93 The answers are given in the hydrolysis of ATP over generations of electron transfer just as the human race has been coupled to repeating experiments carried on by the Higher Evolution. 94 When we use the electron transfer process, we can take this model and apply it to biophysics and make it into an adaptive model with a new bioengineering that will allow Man to live in different planetary environments. 95 Our planetary biophysicists have been too restrictive in work - ing with chemical processes which are not based on the higher possi - bility of what electron transfer does to the reversal of the chemical pro - cesses (especially in osmotic work). 96 Although the details of the"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"KEY 315 96 - 109 molecular mechanism for coupling of electron transfer to a conforma- tional transition of energy may be very different from what they would be for the general ATP hy - drolysis, the basic principles must be those already generated in the larger model. 97 Therefore, just as the mem - brane picture is part of a larger pic - ture, the ATP energy - model is part of a larger network of intelligence. If we can associate ourselves with the energy fields of a larger net - work, we can perhaps know how the models themselves are not models of closed energy systems, but are models which are transduc- tion systems working together with many systems of consciousness throughout our galaxy. 98 Thus, one obtains a process of a reversible chemical engine that can be powered either by electron transference of a new energy source or through the transfer mechanism of ATP. 99 The key stresses that ATP is a model which will be used to ena - ble a breakthrough to occur using a chemical base to convert energy to an electron base and vice versa. 100 Through this man can con - vert his biological substratum to different Gravity states and under - stand interdimensional intelligence. 101 If the free energy drop for electron transfer is greater than given ATP chemical hydrolysis, the electron transfer can drive the synthesis of ATP from Adenosine Diphosphate to Adenosine Tri- phosphate. 102 If a free energy drop for the chemical hydrolysis is greater than the electrical, then the electrical electron transfer is reversed. 103 The overall direction of the reaction is determined by ther - modynamic and not kinetic factors. 104 If we can use the electron drop upon the water flow, we can see how star ionization works through every membrane state and that man is a thinking membrane between star fields; not simply a thinking human, a thinking social machine, nor a thinking ideologist, but a thinking membrane. 105 In summary, your basic or - gans function like galaxies transmit - ting crystal communication through crystal invagination touching upon every molecule where inner and outer membranes work in parallel phase. 106 The key is suggesting that communication between the uni - verses of the inner body and com - munications between the planetary bodies of transmission is possible through a human tripartite energy system. 107 And where electron cou - pling is stronger than chemical synthesis, such as ATP hydrolysis, then we can move up in the chem - ical synthesis into step functions, from simple forms of phosphate to triphosphate. 108 In the environment where chemical syntheses take place, if the chemical field is stronger than the electron drop, then we can re - duce the energy or even reverse the process. This explains how higher universal intelligence can slow down and come into our chemical vibratory environment; and how, by an electron drop into our chemical orbit, they can speed up to go back into their normal phase. 109 This explains how a Being of Light becomes physical and how a physical man becomes a Being of Light. 110 Into the electrical and chem - ical double bonding, the Father pours His Spirit so that Man can receive the next image - space of the Christ Body of Light. Ill Enoch said that the local universe, known as our galaxy, is one large astrochemical computer of various crystalline phases of energy transfer. And through these processes of tripartite energy trans- duction, we can understand how man emerges out of a series of higher evolutionary forms to inherit the worlds of specific membrane relativity. 112 The key is telling us that evolution and reincarnation are part of a repeating cell unit process which is going on through different levels of energy gradients. 113 Some of these worlds re - quire that the Adamic image in cel - lular form repeat itself over several generations through meta - stable conformations. 114 These meta - stable conforma - tions are continually relaxing and requiring rebirth, so that the mem - brane of Man is regenerated over many generations until it is remade into the \" image of the Higher Evolution. \" At such a time, it is in - separable from the luminaries for it operates completely within the highly ordered structure of the energy cycle of evolution in the name of righteousness. 115 The key, then, is given with the understanding that we are being directly reprogrammed at this time to go on in this shape, and that we do not have to go back to the meta - matter of aeons ago and KEY 315 start over from nothing. 116 And this key is telling us that our membrane does not neces - sarily have to die according to the function of light as we know it, but it can be part of a greater Light energy process where we are energized by repeating units of light transduction within our body so that our body becomes an actual regenerating system for the ing Light. \" 117 It is the work of the fallen mind energies to block the energy source for the generation of all of these patterns of conformation. They do this so that Man will not understand that he can attain higher bodies of Light. 118 By blocking this Wisdom, they can acquire non - spiritual human bodies which are left in \" consciousness vacuums. \" This is why when the body has been de - pleted of energy it is more suscep - tible to negative intrusion. 119 Metatron explained that this is the reason why the higher Brothers of Light come to regener - ate, resurrect, and reprogram the cellular meta - material universes of Shekinah. 120 Hence, we must note that on the level of the worlds of Assiah, the worlds of matter, crea - tion takes place through the chemi - cal shell and the transduction pro - cess wherein Man, as a molecular machine, is continually transcribing his own \" book of formation. \" 121 Here life goes beyond the biological shell into the Light through the 'divine Language', re - making life again and again 'into the Image' of the Father. This di - vine Language ultimately does not allow you to be separated from the"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"KEY 315 121-132 luminaries for it is built into the transduction network for those who can use it. 122 When we understand that the tripartite energy transduction model gives us the biological mechanisms for protein synthesis within the pyramidal field ar - rangement of an energy base, head, and stalk as seen in the model of ATP, we can see that the integrity of Life functions must be maintained if this process is to go on. 123 This energy transduction applies to the activities of chloro - plasts, plasma membranes, red corpuscles, retinal rods in the eyes, as well as actomycin. 124 Therefore, the key shows how the higher universe works within you through a \" tripartite structure of Light, \" creating small micro - universes within your biolog - ical mechanisms. 125 And this is the principle of universality within the ordering of resonant receivers which can re - ceive the Light of Metatron and Uriel for a wide category of biologi - cal functions, including the energy transcriptions of Light. This is why Metatron used the basic molecules of the cell in the tripartite energy transduction model to explain the inner synthesis of a given biological source. 126 However, because of the conflicting levels taking place be - tween spiritual and non - spiritual biological systems, we must clearly understand what the key means when it stresses \" the Thinking Membrane requires the integrity of life structure for the maintenance of function. \" 127 The key tells us to \" beware of 'fallen Fields' which circulate through cell energies of anti- universes. \" It also tells US that \" atomic and subatomic fields are to be shared with the Seraphim to the intent that Man should continue with pure Love and Right - eousness. \" 128 Metatron told me about the negative orders of space intelli - gence that use the corresponding negative biotranducers in this sys - tem of creation to try to destroy our biological structure by the mis - use of atomic and subatomic power. 129 According to Metatron, when the energies of atomic and subatomic fields are not under the maintenance functions of the \" Liv - ing Light \" controlling transduction, the negative powers of spiritual in - telligence can dissolve electrons through a wall of photon waves and explode the electron space structure of life. 130 For the purpose of counter - ing the negative destructive power, the Seraphim Brotherhood is per - forming a tremendous transduction operation for the entirety of the Christ Race on this planet. Through this operation an energy field will be placed around the body to bypass negative fields of interfer - ence and to monitor a chemical spin orientation which will prevent the body from undergoing atomic destruction. 131 Now, we can understand the deeper meaning of the words 'energy cycle of evolution,' because all life is a process of the energy cycle of evolution within the grea - ter creation. 132 For this reason Metatron told me to write: \" they whose prof - its are not of Love will be known as damned to eternal destruction.'' 133 And he says, \" For this reason the 'Living Light' comes to rescue membrane with 'Love In The Image,' for man was made to grow Into The Image of the Living Light \" - not into the image of humanoid life on other planets. 134 Man was made to grow into the image of the Living Light, to become the Adam Kadmon who is capable of chemically generating an infinite number of spatial forms. 135 The key stresses the human creation as one of the repeating energy units in a state of being purified between star fields. 136 This is why the overall blueprint of the physical form is used on the day of resurrection, for it is the physical form plus the en - tire energy model which is resur - rected and used for transduction creation in other worlds of physical form. 137 However, in the final analysis of the biological struggles being completed on this planet, the lesser brotherhoods have interfered with the powers of crystal invagi- nation and the double bonding going on within the inner mem - brane of the chemical body and the outer boundary of electron shells. 138 For this reason the Order of Melchizedek is working with the functions of Light through Seraphim Brotherhoods of the Higher Evolution to recede the or - bital shells so that life can operate with a new \" universal structure. \" 139 Metatron explained to me how the High Energy Intermediates are, in actuality, life forces con - nected with the Office of the Christ. These life forces, which are KEY 315,132-145 a synthesis of the life forms of the outer universes produced by Meta- tron and the inner universal life forms produced by Uriel, show how the biochemical processes can rebuild the body, cell by cell, once the chemical elements are balanced within the projection of the Living Light. 140 This was demonstrated by Jesus when he balanced the basic thirty - two chemical elements in his human body with the thirty - third transformation of Light known as the Lak Boymer. (This showed how his cellular chemical functions could be completely rebuilt into a Christ body of Light over a three and a half day cycle compared to seven years to replace the body cells .) 141 Metatron explained to me that this process is available to the righteous of this planet if they use the energy transduction model of the Living Light properly. 142 In essence, since the same ATP model that was in Jesus is in us, by the proper electron transfer through the Light projections of the Higher Evolution, we can be deliv - ered from negative decay and en - tropy and quickened into bodies of regeneration and Light. 143 Jesus came to reactivate the chemical blueprint of Light in Man and allow him to use this as an enabling function for a higher ul- trastructure of Light which is the Holy Spirit resonance of the Eternal Light. 144 In order for this to take place within the lower meta- material creations there must be consistency and balance within the body of belief. 145 The Holy Spirit provides"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"KEY 315 145-147 the Light transmissions between the physical body and the Shekinah universe, so that the physical form can return to the presence of the Father to take on a new appearance of divine form for the next world of Light. 146 Here the 'Shekinah' must be understood as the presence of God moving upon the waters of creation coding the divine sem - blance. 147 And the collective 'Christ child' is now ready to come out of the womb and inherit this Eternal Divine Order forever and ever. heads - it the of with quanta me - $ return"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"THE HOLY EYES OF OUR FATHERS FROM CONSCIOUSNESS BEGINNING WATCH THE FORMATION OF THE \" BROTHER - HOODS OF LIGHT. \" THE BROTHERHOODS BRING THE MES - SAGE OF \" PEACE AND PREPARATION. \" FROM THE FIRMA - MENT THE BROTHERHOODS RECEIVE THE WHOLE LIGHT BEINGS \" WHO COME IN THE APPEARANCE OF MAN WITH QUANTA MECHANICAL CORPUSCLES OF LIGHT AND \" MOVE IN THE MIDST OF MAN \" BY GRAVITATIONAL FLUX LINE CONTROLS SO THAT THEY WHO WILL SEE \" WILL SEE. \" THE BROTHERHOODS COME AND RETURN IN A \" FLASH OF LIGHT. 1 From the higher heavens the Elohim and the B'nai Elohim con - tinually oversee creation through the Father's Eye of creation and the Eye of Horus. 2 They are the \" Fathers \" who watch the formation of the Brotherhoods of Light who are pre - created in the heavens. 3 They align their eyes with the eye network patterns of the indi - vidual species, for the eye is the opening to the code of creation. 4 In the original creations of spectrum evolutions, the Father's Eye was used. These creations pro - ceeded out of His direct mental projection passing through His Eye of omniscience. 5 The Father's Divine Eye is the pattern of Creation behind the crea - tion. 6 Accordingly, after creation is begun, the Eye of Horus is used to create specific individual forms for the embodiments of the Adam Kadmon. For this reason Jesus was in the Adam Kadmon image even though he is beyond the Adam Kadmon operating as a direct man - ifestation of the Father's Body as a celestial Creator. 7 Jesus exists in many forms, but took on the form of the Adam Kadmon to encompass the worlds of the Adam Kadmon and to re - deem their bodies so that they would pass into new bodies of glory. 8 In turn, physical creation must pass its coding through this screen of Light, the Eye of Horus, if it is to receive a celestial image from the Divine Eye. 9 Moreover, the Adamic evolu - tion was created by the Higher Evolution focusing high frequency Light patterns through the Eye of"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Horus according to the expression: whereby the \" eyes \" are to be un - derstood as inductive filters. This is equivalent to Amset, Tuamutef, Hapi, and Qebhsennuf in the Egyptian order of creative evolu- tion, where their eyes exist as sub - divisions of the Eye of Horus, and are used to create the magnetic grids for different evolutionary manifestations. (This is also rep - resented in the \" floating eyes \" of Light seen in the cosmologies of the eastern scriptures of Light.) 10 When the grid begins to modulate the rod and cone recep - tors of the Eye, the syntony creates the early development of the neural tube, notochord, aorta, somato- pleure and coelom; later develop - ment shows the increasing size of the head, limb bud segments, and superficial rudiments of the sensory system become noticeable.

This causes the intelli - gences within these energy thresholds to go through a con - tinual mutation. 23 Therefore, it is necessary that soul advancement proceed primar - ily through the Overself spiritual body. Ultimately, it is the Overself body (in conjunction with the Binai Elohim) which uses the Eye of Horus to evolve the perceptual membrane of Man. 24 The third eye is not the same as the Eye of Horus. The Eye of Horus is the \" eye of the Lords \" serving the Living Father of Crea - tion which is placed upon the third eye region of the elect. Therefore, this alignment of the \" divine eyes \" through the Overself, and the Overself with the physical creation, permits you to acquire the wisdom of the Elohim and to work within the complete network of a divine hierarchy. 25 With this alignment, spiritual gifts are poured out upon the Brotherhoods of Man for they op - erate as the Brotherhood of Light in physical form. Through this alignment, they receive the \" Whole Light Beings, \" the higher forms of spiritual intelligence in pure energy form who come in the appearance of Man. 26 The Brotherhoods of Light operating through the Brotherhood of Man function as the biochemical double bonding between the \" Whole Light Beings \" and the human intelligence. 27 Through the bodies of the Brotherhood of Man, the Light pro - jections of the B i nai Or can counter the effects of retrogressive evolu - tion on the chemical body and, thereby, increase the transduction of the chakras to receive new fre - quencies of Light. 28 Here, the higher science is given to the Brotherhood of Man to actually help in the transfiguration of a whole bioengineering process of life. 29 The actual transfiguration works through Urim and Thum- mim light controls which are used to build the new network directly between the Brotherhood of Man and the Brotherhood of Light. 30 In order for the brain to ac - cept new knowledge, to put a new bioengineering process to work, and to correct the retrogressive evolution, it is necessary that the brain goes through time accelera - tion. 31 Presently, your brain works according to the consciousness plan of the specie which establishes the flow of ions through the membrane circuitry. 32 In order for you to go beyond the increments of the chemical time scale requires the use of Urim circuitry which overrides the old flow time of the sodium ions and allows for immediate in - formation transfer between the brain codes and new memory stor - age. 33 Here, the Urim circuitry al - lows for the reception of informa - tion at rates faster than analytical comprehension. In fact, when the time frames of memory (past refer - ence) and thought stability are compared with the new incoming information, consciousness time ac - tually speeds up. 34 The Urim are crystals that work within a harmonic grid ar - rangement. Through the modula - tion of these crystals with the energy fields of sound and color, spiritual beings can directly send and receive thought - forms which can be absorbed consciously or un- conscious1y. 35 Through the Urim, the Brotherhood of Man is coordinated with the Brotherhood of Light by means of light crystal frequencies which activate the channels of Love and Wisdom. 36 The Urim are the \" Lights \" which connect the processes of the mind with the different threshold levels of spiritual power. They are 'energy jewels' which connect with the template grid of the eighth chakra so that the 'flame over the head' can be focused into the spiritual pathways being served by the Living Light. 37 Each crystal works at a dif - ferent vibrational frequency which coordinates our program with other universal programs within the Liv - ing Light. The Urim are the highest and most perfect form of crystals available for the coordination of human intelligence with the Higher Evolution. 38 On the other hand, the Thummim are the energy changes around the Urim crystals in which the thought-forms, coming from God and His Hierarchy to His cho - sen servants, stay in \" perfection \" while in dimensions of imperfec - tion. 39 I also saw how the thought- forms of God's messengers would KEY 316 33 - 45 be negated by the energies of im - perfection on the physical plane were it not for the perfect reso - nance of Thummim 'Light' protect - ing the autoresonant properties of the Urim and their thought - forms that are exchanged through spiritual reciprocity. 40 Together, the Urim and Thummim operate as sanctified crystals forming a grid for com - munication which uses sacred vowel patterns to create geometries that merge the different harmonies of color in the various light spec - trums with the living, divine Light. 41 Moreover, the Brotherhood of Man, when they are in direct communication with the adminis - trative directors of the B'nai Or, use the Urim and Thummim for the ex - change of higher Wisdom and the reception of specific thought - forms from God. 42 In the education of a soul, true soul advancement takes place through the channeling of divine thought - forms which move the soul (of an individual) beyond the con - sciousness of being limited and earthbound. 43 There are thirty - six adminis - trative directors on our planet at all times. They are the Hakamim, the wisemen who can enter into the Father's presence at any time. 44 They, in turn, coordinate the Brotherhood of Man on our planet.

Yet, spiritual Man as an earthling man is able to recognize the difference. In the same energy field of meeting both share a higher \" Light environment \" con - trolled by the Urim and Thummim. 57 When you behold a \" Whole Light Being'' you stand in the presence of quanta mechanistic corpuscles of Light as in the ap - pearance of a flash of lightning. And when you exchange the joy of being God's servant with a \" Whole Light Being, \" you can actually feel the great rushing of gravitational flux line controls which are used by the body of the emissary of Light to enter and leave this corporeal dimension at will, 58 Before man can understand how the Brotherhood of Light can materialize and dematerialize through quanta corpuscles of Light, he must understand how the Brotherhood that manifested through Ezekiel is, today, the same Brotherhood utilizing the same manner of divine appearance force! 59 Even materializations and dematerializations of the Brother - hood of Light, in the physical form on this side of the veil of light, must take place under special con - ditions in conjunction with the Overself Body of Light andlor the Higher EvoIution. 60 For this reason, two Brothers of God's Light can recognize each other under the veil of the flesh because the \" Light energy, \" which appears around their body, and especially over their heads, has a specific resonance and synchrony which is in conjunction with the Brotherhoods of Light and is full of the brightness of the Lord's glory. 61 The Brothers of celestial Light, manifested as \" Whole Light Beings, \" come in the appearance of man with quanta mechanical cor - puscles of Light, full of the great rapture of the spirit. 62 This appearance force of a \" Whole Light Being, \" composed of quanta (mechanistic) corpuscles of Light is the projection of the divine image. This is associated with a corresponding energy change in the individual who momentarily be - holds the eternity domain of higher spiritual intelligence. KEY 316 57 - 68 63 The appearance force which is seen is not supernatural, for the \" Whole Light Being \" is an example of a superior biological elec - trodynamics on the human plane. (Here, technical electrodynamics should be understood as a sub - division of biological electro - dynamics). 64 The further one proceeds up the scale of evolution, the more it becomes manifest that higher evolutionary bioelectrodynamics does not conform to inorganic thermodynamics, but has its own scale within living thermodynamics. 65 As the \" Whole Light Being \" comes into the physical dimension, he uses gravitational flux line con - trols to make the entry of high fre - quency energy into our realm of biological reality. His work is not subject to the physical limitations of matter, but is working with in - stantaneous transference between parallel 'worlds' and multiple evolu tionary orders. 66 Every electron has a mathematical counterpart of Light which establishes a Light threshold which survives the body. By measuring the wave form of this Light threshold, the Higher Evolu - tion can recode the consciousness state of a human being who is con - tinually in states of flux and unsta - ble equilibrium. 67 Also by energizing magneto- gravitational fields around your body, your molecular structure can be changed and your body recon - stituted on another wavelength of light. 68 For this reason, Metatron and the Councils of Light have made available a Light \" polariza - tion process'' known as \"Ze\" which"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"KEY 376 68 - 77 can mediate between the physical body and the \" Whole Light Be - ings. \" In more advanced stages, the Light polarization known as \"Ze\" can mediate between the body of consciousness and its \" di - vine double \" shaped according to the Adam Kadmon. 69 \"Ze\" is Light polarization composed of thought particles of Light that can transform the body, while maintaining the sensitive faculties of the mind, so that it can function on a multitude of levels. And when you \" receive \" a \" Whole Light Being, \" you also receive the Light polarization of \"Ze\" which enables you to see other dimen - sional realities and to make contact with the Lords of Light who ac - knowledge that polarization of Light S O you can participate with them. 70 Just as \"Ze\" comes from the Brotherhood of Light to Man, there are also thought particles which are created by the spiritual and physical energies which are aligned within your own system and operate within you as a unit for higher consciousness aware - ness. 71 Metatron revealed that these \" thought particles \" of Light known as are necessary for trans - formation \" into the Light \" because they work as an additional charge in the length - defining operations of the human electrochemical proces - ses, so that the electrochemical processes have access to a higher field of energy. By the use of the body is subordinated to your thoughts. 72 Ze'on is the adaptable unit of thought particles needed to ex - pand, go within and do omnidirec - tional work with the Higher Evolu - tion. The interaction between the many thought particles with the eka bodies within you is the fundamen - tal generating dynamic for experi - ence with the Higher Evolution. 73 Generally, man is oblivious to these length - defining operations created by these thought par - ticles of Light which are interacting with all perceptual masses in our universe. Moreover, thought parti - cles which control traditional sys - tems precondition those systems to remain within a limited range of mental activity. This precondition - ing process is changed through the programming activities of particles 74 The concentrated energy of Ze'on, therefore can be felt but not manipulated by the energies of the physical universe according to Metatron. The transmutation of length - defining operations is done by placing a consciousness energy around you so as to make you ac - tive in space transformation. 75 Through quanta corpuscles of Light, the Brothers of Light can transfer their capacity for projection and telekinesis to other persons they encounter for a short time. 76 The development of the human capacity of projection and telekinesis by Light quanta is helped by consciousness stimula - tion. 77 Moreover, teleportation is possible by working directly with the energies of the Brotherhood of Light, whereby physical objects can pass through surfaces of physical form because the objects have been previously stimulated so that the dielectric of surface materials is changed. At that point, the cou- pling with Light quanta produces instantaneous transference! 78 The thought particles of Light are then used to completely envelop the object with energy and move the fundamental generating mechanisms of animate or inani - mate form into another space. 79 For this reason, gravitational flux line controls must work with different Gravitational fields with - out disturbing necessary equilib - rium and unstable equilibrium. 80 When projected transference is done by a human it must take place through direct association with the strength and density of the images that will be used to move the subject from one field of energy to another field of energy. 81 If a specific field inherent only to the living organism exists, then a corresponding form of energy should exist. This means that on the human scale, mental expansion interacting with emotional - volitional efforts changes the conductivity of active points in the body. These points are part of an axiatonal  system which makes use of the law of bio - electrical in - ductive linkage. 82 The change of points of con- conductivity throughout the body dur- ing emotional-volitional efforts as - sociated with charge induction is part of the law of inductive linkage. 83 On a larger scale, the ex - change of \" creative energy \" with the Brotherhood creates a sym - pathetic resonance so that con - sciousness can make use of greater magneto - Gravity fields. 84 An analog to induction, showing the interaction of magneto - Gravitational flux line con - trols with electrical fields to control KEY 316 77 - 91 'substance,' is a key to the building of some of the pyramidal models which serve as timepieces to the biological programs of the Brother - hoods. 85 I was shown how there exist multiple biological evolutions within unique pyramidal energy zones that are connected by mag - neto - Gravitational flux lines. 86 When Metatron gave me this key he projected a picture of how gravitational flux line controls inter - connect with biological grids on the planet in twelve specific areas. These areas are used for biological specialization on the planet. 87 He explained that these pyramidal areas of the earth are connected with pentagon geome - tries which act as energy centers for the thermodynamic systems of the Higher Evolution. 88 We must remember that there are thermodynamic properties of non - stationary sources which can exceed the concentration of radiated energy because of the in - version of electrons, placed on var - ious energetic levels. 89 Within the body there is a similar structure given on certain levels of biological electrodynamics which connect with* the ther - modynamics of the Higher Evolu - tion. 90 There are pentagon geome - tries which operate within the human body that are used for the correlation of genetic material by the Higher Evolution. 91 The role of selectivity by nucleotide triplets to specify amino acids, for example, emphasizes the specialized role of cells to register different magnitudes of biological electrodynamics from the micro to"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"KEY 316 the mega levels in the continual transformation of life. 92 Enzyme - catalyzed chemical reactions and even reverse photo - synthesis must serve a greater \" Light image \" process which is controlled by quanta mechanistic corpuscles of Light. 93 In the likeness and appear - ance of \" Whole Light Beings, \" the human body can receive instruc - tions of how its C - 0 - H - N structure (Carbon-Oxygen-Hydrogen-Nitro- gen) is a semiconductor for the ac - tion potential pulse coming directly from higher universal intelligence which can remake the energy blueprint of man according to the Divine \" image \" . 94 In the likeness and appear - ance of \"Whole Light Beings, \" man will understand how his body of physical form is a host to other bodies of Light. These other bodies (within you) can manage and re - organize the grids of the consciousness - psyche and the emotional - volitional network de - pending on the image - making processes of Love and Light. 95 It is with this understanding that the Brotherhoods of Light come to provide Man with the abil - ity to make consciousness transi - tions between the inorganic ther- modynamics systems and biological states that are fixed and controlled by other thinking entities, simul- taneously working in grid areas of biological specialization. 96 Moreover, the Brotherhoods couple with the energy vehicles of man so that conventional con - sciousness is overcome by quanta corpuscles of Light in the selective process of life where one desires to see and participate actively with the \" Light \" ! 97 In point of reference, our in - terstellar space is filled with a plasma made up of magnetic fields on the order of gauss. In this field the rest mass of the proton is not significantly altered by the con - stant changes in the magnetic fields. 98 However, man has been ex - perimenting with high energy par - ticles, and more specifically, with the creation of a beam containing charged particles (protons, etc.) to gain control of the atmospheric re - gions of the earth. 99 The Brotherhood of Light has initiated action to protect the specie, allowing the protons to be activated in such a way that both a common light wavelength and a higher \" Light \" wavelength come together in fusion. This can control the generation of nuclear by- products, atmospheric wastes, and beams of destructive energy. 100 In our advancement through \" peace and preparation, \" the big questions of human dynamics will be solved by raising the consciousness of humanity beyond the present controlled sys - tems of consciousness patterns that tend to diminish the quality of work and advancement of this planet that otherwise could be ac- compllshed. 101 Man will see that it is pos - sible to construct large scale psychotropic apparatus through lasers and crystals, whereby the principles of operation are based on the use of unstable equilibrium for consciousness expansion. 102 Because of this the Brother - hoods have intensified their visita- tion of this planet to prevent the control of brain - wave patterns by airborne devices that can neutralize the positive thought - forms of man. 103 Man will discover that con - sciousness energy can be trans - formed into energy forms unknown today in this energy dimension. 104 The key tells us that spiritual - consciousness energy can be transformed into other forms of energy. But, in order to use this energy for advancement of the human race, you must unfold the Light within you which can mirror the work of the Brothers of Light. 105 Some will see and some will not see the \" Whole Light Being \" depending on whether their brain is sensitized and their con - sciousness is prepared to accept the non - physical reality of a \" Whole Light Being f ' which may, at first, produce the surprising features of emotional and biological shock! 106 By definition, the \" Whole Light Being \" retains a constant garment of Light power that does not have to be changed in moving instantaneously from level of cre - ation to level of creation. However! in \"instantinualizing\" before Man in the physical dimension, his gar - ment of Light power must maintain a conservative balance of his energy flow lest the particles over - power the human form. 107 For you will experience in the presence of a \"Whole Light Being \" a tremendous burst of Light accompanied by a great rush of heat throughout your body, becom - ing engulfed by the energy pres - ence of the \" Whole Light Being. \" 108 This great energy does not dissipate, and were it not for the thermodynamic controls that are placed around you, your body KEY 316 would suddenly burst with Light. 109 The messenger of Light up - holds Jehovah's Throne and his sovereign majesty can be recog - nized by the Love of God you can feel, so intense is this Love. 110 And you who have par - taken of the Wisdom of Jehovah through Metatron, greet His mes - senger of Light by extending your hand and saying: \" Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tsebayoth! \" 111 And now prepare yourself, for with the return of the Brothers of Light you will have a fuller ex - perience with the Lords of Light, and they will shine and there will be no comparison of the Light which you will see around their bodies. 112 And you, in your body of Light, will see the Light shoot forth many Light - rays.

Our galactic body of creation controls its renewing functions through meridian axiatonal lines which are the equiv - alent of acupuncture lines that can connect with resonating star sys - tems. 2 These axiatonal lines are not limited to a physical body or a biological creation, but are open - ended and can connect the body vehicle with axiatonal lines that emanate from the various star populations and exist as chemical code mechanisms. 3 When Man can discover the connection between his life space and the axiatonal grids controlling the body through endless cell divi - sion, Man will have a new super- science known as medical astronomy. 4 For the human body is a mi - crocosmos or small space - time field within a larger field. If we can maintain this view, we can recog - nize that acupuncture is one of the first empirical demonstrations of biological scaling within the uni - verse. 5 If we are to approach ac - upuncture from the standpoint of biophysics and also understand the higher force fields which go through the human system as a small open - ended universe, then we can understand how this think - ing organism known as the human being can be attached to other thinking organisms within the local universe. 6 In essence, Man is a floating biological sub - system existing be - tween Magnetic fields. The Magnet - ic fields shape the embryological lines of growth and correspond to magnetic grids delineated within the body. 7 These embryological lines are controlled by biochemical clocks which, in turn, are controlled by the magnetic resonance factors in the immediate universe. 8 Answers to problems of growth, connected with the biochemical clocks in the human body, will come from experiments conducted outside the earth's gravi - tational and electromagnetic field."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"KEY 317 9 - 22 9 The human evolution is a 'preconditioned experiment \" within a world of happenstance relativity. Without higher evolutionary programming or direct programming by an Overself intelligence, the human biological system must go back into the over - all flux of Magnetic fields when the system is discorporated. 10 When Man is directly pro - grammed by an Overself, he is no longer kept in biochemical slavery within a three - dimensional con - sciousness by the \" apparent realities \" of the earth. 11 In this case, the body is a grid of magnetic domains which moves between the primary blue - print of the Overself and the pat - tern angles of the human organs (i. e., the axial relationship). 12 The lines which tie together these magnetic domains are the axiatonal lines. 13 The axiatonal lines can exist independent of the Overself but still require the governing functions of the Higher Evolution. 14 The governing functions are required because the axiatonal grid structures pass through several evolutionary orders, all sharing and working in the same local life space on different dimensions of activity. 15 Therefore, the axiatonal grids tend to enter and interface with the biological activity taking place on higher or lower vibratory frequen - cies within the space being used by various biologies. Yet, these grids are not governed by the laws and mechanisms controlling physical evolution, for they operate by means of their own accretion of energy for maintenance. 16 However, on this planet it is important to know that acupunc - ture lines qua acupuncture lines can be acquired with \" progressive \" and 'regressive \" axiatonal lines. This is due to the residual effects of the human rebellion. 17 Therefore, acupuncture, as used during the last 12,000 years of evolutionary existence, was cut off from the \" progressive \" higher star programming channels when the root races revolted against the programming of the Father. This caused the twelve biophysical meridians to be truncated from di - rect connection with the Oversell - . 18 Furthermore, the biological interconnection with the higher as - tronomy was lost at that time which requires the intervention of the Office of the Christ to restruc - ture the axiatonal lines. 19 Until this time, the body has been left to work on molecular biological levels with only limited magnetic resonance patterns to con - tinue the functions of the amino acids, the basic building blocks of life. 20 Thus, non - Adamic charac - teristics appeared in the human race because the molecular biologi - cal levels were cut off from the data transmission system sustaining the mechanisms of both higher medical astronomy, as well as bioelectrical activities of the Higher Evolution. 21 In other words, Man was cut off from the higher star points that are necessary to maintain a per - fected form of the Adam Kadmon. 22 In order to reconnect the biological interconnection with the higher energy planes serving higher evolutionary programming, the acupuncture lines of the old program have to be attached to \" new \" axiatonal lines (at their in - tersections) if the cellular grids are to be in harmony with all physical manifestations permitted by the governing hierarchy. 23 This is the bringing together of molecular biology with medical astronomy within programs of cre - ation. 24 Man, at this time, is being advanced to a new biological pro - gram of creation. 25 This advancement requires his acupuncture lines be extended to axiatonal lines that will be con - nected directly with the Overself; for if Man is to go on into further soul progression, he must connect his axiatonal lines to his Overself which is also making an ascension into the next quantum level of the Adam Kadmon, just as the Adam Kadmon body is making an ascen - sion into a completely new pro - gram in our Son universe. 26 Here, the Adam Kadmon takes on the next definition of the Divine Father through Metatron. The Divine Father calls before Him - self the unity that has been per - fectly balanced between the body of the last Adam Kadmon and the spiritual - physical body of the first Adam Kadmon, before the collec - tive Christ as the First and Last can offer up this icon to the Father, and pass into a new aeon of the Living Light. 27 Here, the physical creation is no longer separated from the di - vine Am Soph because of the fall of the last iron, but is restored through the Christ Light penetrat - ing the flesh, and the Divine Light penetrating the Overself so that both perfected spiritual and physi - KEY 377 22 - 34 cal bodies become one in the sight of the Father. 28 A whole new specie is being created at this time by the bringing together of the Adamic Overself- human creation which will allow this spiritual - biological expression of the Christ Race to be advanced to the next consciousness time zone of creation. 29 The axial lines are part of a fifth - dimensional circulatory system combining color and sound, which are used to draw from the Overself body the basic energy used for the renewing functions of the human evolutionary body. 30 Conversely, axiatonal lines operate prior to the action potential for the animation of the human specie. 31 Furthermore, they bring to - gether the all - important tonal vibra - tions governing each axis and all ultrasonic activities connected with the colors of healing that relate to each tone and multiples thereof. 32 Hence, the axiatonal lines can be used for the complete re - generation of an organ and even to resurrect the dead, when activated by the proper energies. 33 This key is to be used at the time when the human evolutionary molecular grids are in direct align - ment with the higher evolutionary resonance grids, permitting ultra - sonic pulsations to allow for direct changes within vascular bodies. 34 Medical astronomy, in con - junction with molecular biology (when this dual communication link is regained), will allow the tRNA molecules to cause cells to al ter their normal properties which will then receive the original genet - ic transmissions (of the Adam"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"KEY 317 34 - 47 Kadmon), given through a 'spin point,' to a cell. These transmis - sions at the spin points provide a regenerating instruction for the manufacture of enzymes and pro - teins which are the building blocks for the 'new tissue' or the 'new organ form' which is regenerated on the physical plane. 35 Axiatonal lines, thus, cause new patterns of cellular circumvolu- tion to take place. 36 Projecting energy into the spin point allows for the formation of a blastema (mass of primitive type cells) that gives rise to the re - generated tissue. 37 Thus, through the spin point, cells become the tissue re - sponsible for the generation and transmission of direct current sig - nals used in regeneration proces - ses. 38 Under present biological conditions, evolutionary develop - ment in living bodies from earliest inception follows unicellular semiconductivity, as a living piezoelectric matrix, through stages which permit primitive basic tissues (glia, satellite and Schwann cells) to be supportive to the neurons in the human system where the pri - mary source is electrical. 39 This has been especially shown in bone growth response to mechanical stress and to fractures which have been demonstrated to have characteristics of control sys - tems using electricity. 40 The direct current potentials, measurable on the intact surfaces of all living beings, demonstrate a complex field pattern that is spa - tially related to the anatomical ar - rangement of the nervous system. The mechanisms of data transmis - sion and control in living or - ganisms have been basically limited to the neural action potential, chemical agents, and the DNA- RNA systems. 41 The surface potentials are di - rectly associated with elements of the various circulatory systems. 42 When both the surface struc - tures and internal structures with higher creative energies are at - tached with the fifth circulatory system (through axiatonal arrange - ment), a whole new body surface can be programmed out of a skin cell from one or several major sec - tors of the body. 43 The fifth circulatory system is connected with an internal cur - rent (working through the acupunc - ture lines) continually at work and available to shape the action poten - tial system. 44 This action potential system in the body, therefore, exists upon a substratum of direct current po - tentials which precede the action potentials of a mechanism of data transmission. Thus, the preexisting direct current potentials have origi - nal functions governing the func - tions which control the basic prop - erties of living organisms. 45 This key gives the beginning of an entirely new science called medical astronomy which will allow the nodal of cell memory to be stimulated so that new limbs, or - gans and tissues fill the anatomical space of the body undergoing re - generation. 46 The fifth circulatory system is the model for the physical transmutation. 47 The connecting points be - tween this fifth circulatory system and the nodal points of cell mem - ory are known as spin points. These points admit sound - light vi - brations that change the spin of cell molecules to a faster rate causing the formation of light micro - fibrils, which then allow, in the absence of membranes, the growth of a com - pletely new tissue area or organ. 48 The uniqueness of the spin point is that it takes energy and weaves the light grids which form the fabric of cellular regenesis. 49 The light pattern woven by the spin points controls the pres - sure points on the cellular surface in such a way that the pressure fluctuations are adjusted during its operations so that the new cells are perfectly balanced with all sur - rounding tissues. 50 The spin points receive their energies via the axiatonal lines. 51 The axiatonal light exchange, which is stimulated by noise tem - perature patterns, rotates atomic moments, which are the basic pul - sation points in the vibrations of the body, in concert with the nor - mal exchange field. The tissue also receives a renewing stimulus and is able to admit a new limb, organ, or tissue space controlling immune reactions. 52 This prevents tissue growth from going back into the same pat - tern of limitation. Here the new energy absorbs, in the formation process, the limitations of the old, main subdivisions of cellular ac - tivities. 53 In other words, this renewal process is attached with the under - lying atomic structure and wave- pulse of corporal activity which is opened to new energies which change the domain walls of growth. KEY 317 47 - 58 54 The process of life which is exemplified in endless cell division is here reorganized by the com - bined activities of axiatonal light energies, bringing into the biologi - cal system a new magnetic reso - nance which results in the activa - tion of the spin points by the light flow of axiatonal lines in the cre - ation of micro - cellular grids of Light. 55 These grids are organized to exchange genetic information throughout the body through a network of messenger cells which are passed on to any part of the body. In other words, through ax - iatonal grids there is provided the key framework that is necessary for the proper formation of a new limb, organ etc. This grid network within the body is connected with the spinal column which is the major antenna for the grounding of Light signals. 56 Just as the cell can be split, the whole spinal column network can be split by axiatonal lines into any number of parallel body net - works because the spinal column couples all of the seven major fields of the body (the chakras) in relation to the primitive brain stem and the cerebral cortex. 57 This controls the spatial quantization necessary for the bal - ance of the body in relationship to the medula, pons, midbrain, thalamus, and hypothalamus, which can be stimulated to accept the new limb, organ or tissue. 58 This key refers to the com - plete man on all seven levels being made and remade in the energy of Shekmah.

The universal wave forms establish the vibrations which set the pattern for the formation of life. 61 Once it is established, noise temperature calibrations govern and synchronize the mechanisms of life through the axiatonal network. 62 The key then opens the door for sonic vibrations (sound and ultra - sound in crystalline structure) generating gravitational light within the body. 63 Regions of space associated with given wave sets (of a pro - gram) permit the spin point net - work to evolve the proper limb, organ and tissue within the 'proper location' of the body. 64 By scanning this wave set, the Brotherhood of Light has the capability of scanning the wave form of the body for the detection of abnormalities. If there is an abnormality, energy having the normal or healthy wave form of the organ can be pumped into any one of these specific network points known as spin points, and the organ will be restored to a healthy mode. 65 This polarized field (of ax- iatonal lines) allows the new cells to grow in a healthier configura - tion, weakening the original field of the abnormal or diseased structure and strengthening the field of the normal or healthy structure. 66 Once these axiatonal lines within the human body are fully stimulated by noise temperature calibrations, it is possible for the Brotherhood to directly heal the body through the axiatonal lines- acupuncture fields. 67 This healing process first es - tablishes light bubble parameters which are shell - like forms of light. These light bubbles act as a holding environment around the spin points. 68 They are established by noise temperature calibrations which have been generated by crystalline radiations. 69 The proper ratios between molecular density forms and the noise temperature patterns allow for light bubble parameters to be built around the main domain walls within which spin point regenera - tions can begin. 70 Domain walls are transition zones through which the magneti - zation process in the degenerating or immune tissue reverses direc - tion. The force exerted by the do - main wall combines with the force of the external field in order to re - duce the domain's momentary loss or destruction. 71 The process continues at a certain field strength of noise temperature patterns until the dis - continuities are reduced to \" island domains \" and the tiny, adverse magnetic fields disappear. 72 The intensity of this process, in changing the domain walls of growth, bypasses the present methods used in distinguishing be - tween spheres attached to antigen and spheres which are unattached by florescent antibodies. 73 This light consistency is ca - pable of directly controlling anti - body effectiveness by repairing the mechanisms that control immune reactions. 74 Each light bubble employs its own monochromatic, coherent light depending on the functions it is to perform.

This super - electron is the sole electron composing our immediate universe. 4 Who is Metatron, but one di - vine unfoldment of the Father's Mind as Creator of the Light in the outer universes and the divine au - thor of the sacred tablets in the heavens. 5 And these tablets are the tab - lets of Light; they are energy fields which contain the blueprint of all energy particles of our Father uni - verse used for the creation of the new Son and universes of Light. These tablets of Light con - tain the circuit which is the gating mechanism controlling the Light that pours forth from the Treasury of the Light for the new creative designs of the Elohim. 6 In our universe, the Elohim send their creative transmissions through these tablets of Light which contain the overall plan of organization and the super - electron which is used as a master sphere of creativity in forming the lower worlds. 7 These multiple tablets of \" energy \" pulsate and create ef - fulgent myriads of tessellations which are elliptic in shape.

This means that programs in motion can return to the original areas of creation or slip in and connect with other pro - grams already in motion. 10 In this creation of multiple"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"KEY 318 10 - 21 consciousness levels, each star in our galaxy is a nodal point of energy vibration within this gigan - tic electron. 11 Each physical and spiritual star radiates its spiral, oscillating cosmic rays in all directions in the universal field. 12 Each person functions as a living star but in a different har - monic octave within the larger star nodal point, which is, in turn, within the super - electron. On our consciousness layer all individual electron - positron pairs are like tiny magnets spinning at the velocity of light which is commensurate with our consciousness layer. Metatron explained to me that these electron - positron pairs are part of a greater master blueprint which uses Gravity and Light wave energy as one. 13 All as such have the same interrelated constant as applied to gravity, light, ordinary masses in the nucleus, the atom, and the nu - cleon. Within the shell of the super - electron, a harmonic scale is established which generates cosmic wave trains between programs of the \" Master Program \" being used for a Plan of Creation and sub - programs. 14 The Master Program is re - ceived from the divine tablets of Light and given to the creative worlds of the Elohim through the Master Scribe and Light \" En - gineer, \" Metatron. 15 Here, Metatron functions as the Kasir Kame - the thinking Light of the Father, as the ultimate Scribe who authors the \" Master Pro - grams \" for the Creator Gods. Hence, our Son universe is a Light fabric made up of many conscious - ness layers. Each consciousness layer shapes the building blocks that are arranged within the super - electron. 16 When the universe is up - dated, Light is funneled into these particle blocks on each layer of consciousness through a \" super hologram - like process \" which scans for the locations to be used in the depositing of information. 17 In previous consciousness cons it was Metatron who dictated the Father's programs to the Lords of Light who came to this planet and built temples of divine science. 18 When the sacred treasuries of knowledge were destroyed along with the temples of science in pre - vious cataclysmic upheavals, the Father decided to return the keys of the sacred sciences of Metatron to the heavens, leaving only his name to be remembered. 19 The sacred texts that are now being recovered will show a profound scientific meaning con - nected with the name \"Metatron\" in the pre - Syriac and pre - Coptic civilizations of the ancient Near East which understood meta- creation. 20 Understand, through the super - electron, that we are con - nected with the other myriad pro - grams of our immediate universe which are interconnected with a11 programs in our Son universe. 21 Therefore, each part of three - dimensional space is con - nected to every other part through the basic unit called the super - electron. The super - electron breaks down into more subtle units of space which we call the electron and sub - electron spaces; these are interconnected by wormholes. 22 These wormholes spiral through the framework of space and time that is reserved as the training ground for soul advance - ment. 23 Metatron explained that as Man's consciousness is amplified to enter fifth - dimensional space, travel is possible and Man understands that the wormhole tunnels are por - tals on each shell layer of the elec - tron and sub - electron levels which have multiple consciousness layers within the super - electron. 24 There is only one super - electron forming our Son universe; what Man calls electrons within his terrestrial environment are particles capable of supporting various con - sciousness programs which are constantly being distributed throughout the super - electron. 25 Within the electron there are fractional charges which are part of the electron's energy, and are di - vided into three kinds of spatial organization within the electron. 26 When Man can understand this interconnection of one con - sciousness layer with another, he will participate in the constantly changing pattern which allows each universe to be connected with all others through the building blocks between the consciousness domains (e.g., what Metatron calls urons, levitrons, cosmions, and ze'ons). 27 Programs of consciousness are continually being distributed between light shells of photons and anti - photons through what Meta - tron calls uron, levitron, cosmion, and ze'on particles. These are sub - units of a super - electron. 28 Man's sub-electrons are con - densations of mesons and fractional charges. KEY 318 22-35 29 The light fabric within a Son universe is made up of these dis - crete particles. They shape the had- rons and leptons through a cosmic consciousness field. And in this field, proton spins can go through one another when the proton spin is not aligned and anti - parallel. 30 The aggregation of all these building blocks compose and re - compose within the super - electron. 31 Thus, the electron, as Man knows it, must be extended to the activity of a parent super - electron. The super - electron also contains the stimulated emissions of Gravi - tational waves, or Graser amplifica - tion. 32 Here the geon may be consi - dered as a treatment of a funda - mental unit of gravitation. Specifi - cally, the super - electron puts geons in step with locally coherent gravity fields existing on each conscious - ness layer throughout the Son uni - verse. 33 The point of this is Meta - tron, as consciousness architect of this cosmic consciousness field, is telling us that there exists a super - electron - the \" father \" of electrons which subsumes all energy compo - nents in our immediate universe. The super - electron in interaction between consciousness layers may cancel aggregations of particles on any consciousness layer. 34 This super - electron embodies a smaller blueprint of itself through sub - electron firings which form the syntax controlling the natural dis - pensation of universal knowledge through quantum mechanistic lan - guage codes. 35 These codes work through multiple manifestations of sub- electrons within both physical and"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"KEY 318 35-46 consciousness layers. 36 Therefore, the higher levels of creation, are not simply states of consciousness, but actual realms of vast crystalline cosmoses, uni - verses, and worlds in \" the plural \" which are modeled into the most minute parts of the human mic - rocosmos. We exist as a finger cell or toe cell between the larger spa - tial expressions of intelligence. 37 If all spaces were removed that exist within Man-he would be no larger than a minute cell floating in a vast ocean of energy creation, all made of the same basic materials. The only difference is the 'image space \" God has given to Man through the \" Adam Kadmon \" which gives the key to the unique space that Man occupies. 38 In fact, we are so far away from the higher \" throne and dominion regions of God, \" that the world of mankind looks like a tiny speck of dust in terms of the great - er intelligence, but greater intelli - gence is simply on the other side of \" the image space \" of this tiny speck, and all that is necessary is the right formula of Light to bring the billions of biological specks into a new composition. 39 The Higher Intelligence of the Elohim is involved with tireless comings and goings in an examina - tion of the living aggregates of Life, whereby the Light substances of the minute worlds of physical form are selected, gathered, and renewed in still new worlds of creation. 40 The lower regions of ex - perimentation are permitted to exist by the Orders of Michael and Mel- chizedek until the collective ar - rangement of the civilizations being created is complete for master in - tegrity and structural organization in the universe. And then a new cross - fertilization takes place. 41 In the primacy of a creation, Light is emanated to the outer re - gions of a forming universe by Metatron. 42 In the outer worlds, because of the complexity of nucleogenesis, the Light has to be purified after the initial explosion into cycles of creation and evolution. This pro - cess of expansion and purification is extremely long in terms of the age of our immediate star system. 43 Before all of this, however, Metatron created the super - electron for the ordering of nucleogenesis so that a balance and correspondence can exist between the dynamic phases of an infinite number of coexisting universes and the Living Light. 44 Into the super - electron there are cast the higher consciousness creations of a Paradise Son of Light which interpenetrate the super- electron and form the major con - sciousness dimensions that incorpo - rate a Son universe. The precise balance between the interpenetrat - ing consciousness dimensions and the transitions between coexisting universes is maintained by \" walls or veils of Light \" which can be traced back to the self - organizing consciousness. 45 The consciousness domains are generated out of different types of divine Light, ordering the \" walls of light \" and the \" walls of the Liv - ing Light. \" Through this ordering, Man moves from being a \" Son of flesh \" into being a \" Son of Light. \" 46 The lowest regions of cre - ation consisted, as they do now, in a reality world where the small particles produced by the hydrogen schema (sub - quanta particles in polarization) break up and are not stable. This is a necessary part of meta - creation, a half - life creation, and because it is, it is not a full life creation in the fuller 'sense' of Metatronic creation. 47 In the larger schema, at this moment in our world of matter, the electrons are \" effectively defec - tive. \" 48 The electrons are defective until they achieve the critical diameter i.e., the energy radius needed for the ultimate purpose. Our electron has not \" graduated. \" 49 Only through the power of Metatron, ordering electromagnetic spin orientation in clustered form, can the smallest particles of the electron, be shaped into a complete wavelength for the ordering and advancement of these minute forms into perfection. 50 Just as the hydrogen atom is undergoing change, the electron has to evolve too! 51 And, to perfect the regions of the lower heavens, the Councils of the hierarchies set up measures to ensure the continual recycling into perfection and purification. This is a condition which is estab - lished for the continual interaction with the individual universes as they proceed out of happenstance creation. 52 It was out of the Father's greatest expression of Divine Love that the Office of the Christ was procreated so that the Elohim Lords through \" Christ \" could rapidly recapitulate and rebalance all soul experiments in the Mid- Heavens and in the lower heavens that were separated from each KEY 378 46 - 58 other through \" walls of Light. \" 53 The Office of the Christ causes the souls to be quickly raised up so they can be restored by Melchizedek and be more than a singular soul embodiment. 54 In general, there are three categories of souls in the lower worlds: new souls arising out of frequency modulated codes (radiated into the primeval sea of creation) which have never been in 'the Light'; souls synthesized out of the functions of Light and dark - ness; and souls of the 'firstborn' of YHWH who descended into the outer experimental regions of space as integrated \" life beacons \" of im - mortality. The latter are used, ac - cording to Metatron, to bring the 'Image \" of the Father for the up - grading of intelligence. 55 Here, sub - electron particles combine with ze'on particles in permitting consciousness programs to slip into singular regions of space and time and then reappear back on the original layer of con - sciousness thought. 56 In effect, two identical sub- electrons can arrive from the origi - nal consciousness zone or layer, codirect a material manifestation of cosmic energy and depart for some other layer of consciousness within the super - electron. 57 This process repeats itself, and in this way, the Councils can generate many controlled programs using identical sub - electrons for carrying out mechanistic functions in the lower worlds. 58 Thus, in the gathering of the Light components, there is a con - tinual life - giving fusion between the expanding and devouring Lights. The control of this fusion is"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"KEY 318 38 - 67 the Wisdom given by Metatron to Melchizedek for the purifying of the lower worlds so they can pass into the Mid - Heavens, and from the Mid - Heavens into the greater creation, and programs of perpetual renewal. 59 Moreover, it is Melchizedek who is the Receiver of the Light of YHWH through Metatron; he purifies all of the lower heavens and carries their Light into the Treasury of Light, while the hierar - chical servants of the realm un - dergo change in gathering together all manner of creation and all meta - matter of pre - creation used to fashion souls in the lower worlds. 60 Indeed, it is Melchizedek who carries away the purified Light from all the rulers of the aeons and from all the rulers of the Councils of the lower heavens; he carries away that which is necessary to bring a \" pairing of consciousness'' together with \" the Light,'' 61 Metatron showed me how Melchizedek is in charge of the re - creative phases, no matter how large or small. It is Melchizedek, the great receiver of the Light, who equips the souls to enter into the midst of the (eons and into the consciousness Command of the Hierarchy in each Father universe. 62 However, there are some rulers who do not want to give their Light to the lower heavens and the lower regions of purifica - tion in fear that the 'lower cre - ations' would seek their level, and their power would be diminished so that their own rulership could not be sustained. 63 Through the work of Mel- chizedek, in cooperation with Metatron and the Christ, the Nartoomid Light, the Eternal Light of the Father, is used with the Eshyouhod Light, the devouring Light of purification, to rebalance the lower spheres and to throw the forces of creative limitation into confusion. 64 And, according to the Cos - mic Law of YHWH, the higher in - telligence which has created levels of imperfect creation and physical grotesquerie, must incarnate into their own \" fields of creation \" so as to be part of the purifying and purging activity that must be superimposed from without. 65 They, the negative soul programmers, put their matter into the souls which are purified, and their power ceases in them, and their spheres of influence become destroyed so that the judgement of higher perfection upon imperfect soul creation is allowed, quickening souls to be reprogrammed and ad - vanced towards the Treasury of Light, the Father's place of pure consciousness Wisdom! 66 Finally, it was Jesus of the Office of the Christ and of the Order of Melchizedek who bore witness to the fallen Lords and light entities who were in the greatest regions of turbulence so that they, through the Father's Grace, might speed up their time outside the higher veils of Light. 67 It is through the Father's Grace that they can qualify for a reconsideration if they no longer \" push against \" the higher veils of Light, but allow the Office of the Christ to devour the darkness ''without \" through the power of Metatron. This also encompasses the darkness \" between \" within and without, in the dynamics of cre - ation, through the power of Mel- chizedek using the Ad-mod-oo-esh Light, the expanding Light of soul growth. 68 However, it is also important to note that the property of soul space is not limited to, nor must remain within an atom. The souls are \" Christed \" and given the Metatronic seal so that they might be quickly purified and raised on high from threshold of creation to threshold of creation like the Light Body of Enoch. 69 Thus, Melchizedek is in charge of organizing worlds, but it is Metatron, Michael, and Uriel who insure the outpouring of Light necessary for soul expansion. They supervise a continual process for the formulation of individual con - sciousness realities which can actu - ally govern the world of the elec - tron. 70 Yet, in the gathering of light into the super - electron, each sub- electron phase becomes a source of new creation, having its part in the expansion of the universe and the overall shape of living systems, in the Father's \" garment of Light. \" 71 These advanced realms of in - telligence will allow man to use energy which is going faster than the light structure surrounding our consciousness domain. This energy will be used to reshape our vehicle of consciousness progression for better cooperation with larger uni - versal intelligence. 72 I was shown how other intel - ligences reserve planetary zones, which have no radiation belts, to create a more perfect metallurgy which they use to span galactic and universal distances through the use of concentric atoms. KEY 318 67 - 77 73 They do this through the knowledge of Metatronic sciences. These sciences allow the Adamic evolution to freely circumnavigate between the spiritual planets, spiritual Councils of our Son uni - verse and the Population II and III civilizations which have evolved their technology to the point of breaking through a three - dimensional light consciousness with thought - form technology. 74 The Metatronic sciences make use of a wide variety of dis - ciplines. They span the fields from aerospace bioengineering to ex - obiology, simulating primitive envi - ronments for the advancement of intelligence, and also include such sciences as: astrophysics, biosci- ences, bionics, biotechnology, chemistry, communications, elec- tromedicine, energy research, mas - ers, matter and muon waves, mathematics, Metatronic physics, servomechanisms, space coloniza - tion, space travel, space radiation, thermodynamics, and transduction processes. 75 These sciences require a thought - form structure so that a self - organizing science will allow for large scale jumps to take place between individual realities within the universal continuum. 76 The use of Metatronic sci - ence unites the half - cycles of sub- electrons with the full cycle of the super - electron.

Each jewel cor - responds to a higher Urim and Thummim governed by entities of Light who operate directly with the Thrones of the Universal Mind (in our Father universe). 31 And Abraham also received these jewels from Melchizedek to build an altar of \" Light \" vibration to Jehovah who spoke to Abraham through the vibrations of Light. And the Lord said to Abraham: \" I have set this seal on you to govern all those who belong to the seed of love and light upon the earth, so that your seed will gather all true priesthoods into 'Communities of Light i before the end of time. And the Urim and Thummim will be used to reevolve the grids of the earth according to a new meridian of time on which will be built the Light centers of My Kingdom. \" 32 I saw how the Urim and Thummim crystals were used to connect the ten strata beneath Megiddo which contain the grid structures composing a timepiece for the Great Pyramid. I also saw how Urim and Thummim crystals"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"KEY 319 32 - 40 coordinate other energy structures on the earth with the Great Pyramid which houses the geophysical time table and reveals the Eben Sheftiyah, the Foundation Stone, to be the unity between the scriptures of Israel and the land of Egypt. 33 I saw how the vibrations of the Urim crystals were used to ac - tivate the grids so that the founda - tions of three - dimensional negativ - ity were shifted, and the treasures of the Masters were brought out of the earth in the name of Michael, Abraham, Jacob and Enoch. 34 And the Lord said to Ab - raham, \" By the Urim and Thum- mim, your station of creation was after the manner of the Lords, ac - cording to its times and seasons in the revolutions; that one revolution was a day to the Lord, after his manner of reckoning; it being one thousand years according to the time appointed to that space - time where you stand. This is the reck - oning of the Lord's time for your physical world according to the reckoning of the Lords of the Heavens. \" 35 I was shown that from the higher star regions there will be the energy of renewal given to Man. And, thus, there will be the reck - oning of the time of one planet above another, one orbit within another until one comes near to the region of the Paradise Sons, after which the thresholds of Orion be - come the reckoning of the Lord's time, which the Paradise Sons set in accord with the Throne of YHWH to govern all those planets which belong to the same order as that which quickens this creation. 36 And I was shown how each transplanting of the heavens to the earth and the earth back into the heavens requires its own Book of Genesis, and our Book of Genesis i-xii is the cosmology of our Adamic Fathers of Light in the heavens. 37 And the Master Barnabas tells us the following, for this cycle: ''And God made in six days the works of his hands; and he finished them on the seventh day, and he rested the seventh day, and sanctified it. Consider, my children, what this signifies, he finished them in six days. The meaning of it is this, that in six thousand years the Lord God will bring all things to an end. For with him one day is a thousand years; as he himself tes - tifies, saying, 'Behold this day will be as a thousand years.' Therefore, children, in six thousand years, will all things be accomplished. \" 38 Enoch explained to me that this is a general time reference for one of many cycles of the earth as it is periodically cleansed, and new Adams and Eves are left on the planet to continue the Adamic ex - pressions of creation. 39 However, I was shown that the time frame was confused so that the religionists and the priests of organized temple worship could not understand the scriptures of Genesis i-xii as the blueprint of the many levels of creation that had to precede the creation of this physi - cal world. 40 I saw at the end of the cycle of this Age, a great unity between linear and non - linear events. Souls which normally depend upon indi - vidual systems of liberation, which are normally highly individualistic expressions, became unified collec - tively with other levels of intelli - gence as the Holy Spirit was abun - dantly poured out! 41 Collective soul advancement will allow for the growth into new chakra levels, as Man enters into co - citizenship with the Higher Evolution. 42 I was told by Metatron, that each man would recognize the exis - tence of this new program of Light according to his own unique time element which is connected with the chakra levels filtering the ener - gies of space - time events. 43 For those who are operating already on the seventh chakra level of enlightenment, the recognition that we are entering a new pro - gram of consciousness will take place in 1976 (era zone). For those operating on the sixth chakra level, it will take place in the 1980's. For those on the fifth and fourth chakra level, this realization will come before the year 2004 (era zone), according to the reckoning of the lower heavens, which will mark the beginning of the next great cycle. 44 For those on the third chakra (on down) who love, but who do not have divine Love - it will take place when the whole biochemical shell of the earth changes and the physical shell is reset. 45 I was shown that when the proper chakra frames of conscious - ness time are opened, the recogni - tion of the existence of the Higher Evolution, that is cooperating with Man (on the other side of the veil of Light) will be understood 46 This means that Man will realize the Higher Evolution al - ready in his midst beyond his con - ventional time perception. 47 Man is participating in the KEY 54 'great leap forward \" with a host of other intelligences who likewise have to decide their fate in accord - ance with the Cosmic Law of Light and Love. 48 Nevertheless, beloved, re - member that all through the ages God has stood beside His people and promised His people a place in the final restoration! 49 I was shown how there ex - ists an interlocking grid of con - sciousness time zones. Soul ad - vancement proceeds according to the ability to function in the more complex time zones by using the Love of the Living Light. 50 Beginning in 1976, the grids will begin to be shifted into a new geophysical program. 51 After this, I saw how Man was prepared for the physical land - ing of a delegation of interplanetary beings who explained how Man violated the Cosmic Law and was in need of a redefinition of Life. 52 The delegation of interplan - etary beings remained upon the earth for only a short period of time and then left the millions upon millions who either marveled at the wonder of other worlds of intelligence, or became resentful and chaotic because of the pro - claimed return of Michael and Christ. 53 I was shown how soul ad - vancement would be speeded up prior to the return of Michael and Christ because of the miraculous outpouring of spiritual gifts. 54 And the twelve vibratory pathways of the human body will be activated so completely that we will actively serve as the twelve tribes of the true spiritual Israel upon the face of the earth."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"KEY 319 55 And when the people of God are assembled their collective efforts will become so powerful that their prayers and mantras, used collectively, will actually offset wars and terrorist activity. 56 When this is done properly, the Chamber of the Son will also open to a new program of con - sciousness generation being poured out. 57 I was given the sacred Words which Jesus used when he was initiated in the Great Pyramid. I was told that when the sacred code \"1-1\" (glottal stop) was used with repetitions of YHWH's Names, the names of the Ascended Masters, and other sacred words, the vibratory structure of the Pyramid would open and finalize the programming structure of man - kind. 58 And when this is done properly, the 'Chamber of the Son' will open to a new consciousness of Life. 59 Furthermore, I saw the acti - vation of the gifts of the Holy Spirit for the faithful who labored day and night to build the King - dom of God. I understood how the righteous had to undergo \" public crucifixion \" in presenting the Word of God. 60 Yet, even with the imperfec - tions of the body and tongue, the Spirit of God pours into the ser - vant who sacrifices for the King - dom of Light and understands Jesus' words: \" Eli Eli lama asabachthani (Mi God, my God why have l forsaken thee). \" Such a ser - vant who is willing to sacrifice his body upon the cross of space and time, is honored by the glory and the power of the Holy Spirit Shekinah in the moment of de - liverance. 61 Enoch told me that when Christ Jesus expired, his final breath had the sound of \" ah \" be - fore his last word. Yet, he did-not say \" ahhh sabachthani \" but 'asabachthani \" which was an af - firmation of the limitation of his physical vehicle. However, this tes - timony was not a confession of being apart from the Father, but an affirmation of the complete work of the Host that would be needed to offer up the Kingdom at his Re - turn. 62 Furthermore, this testimony was the breaking open of a pro - found mystery and a lesson to each Master and prophet of YHWH who comes into this world and realizes that the physical vehicle cannot complete its mission without the fullness of the higher Christ Body of Light and the collective efforts of the Father's Hierarchy. 63 I also saw and understood how the true outpouring of the Holy Spirit would be activated with the commissioned power of the Father presented through the Office of the Christ so that the dead could be raised and all manner of sick - ness be put away in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. 64 I saw that the physical body, without active spiritual gifts man - ifested on the earth plane through the power of the Holy Spirit could not marshal enough energy to evolve into the consciousness of Light. 65 Enoch said to me: \" Those who are not sufficiently prepared by the insights of the Holy Spirit will not be able to consciously par - ticipate with the first manifestations of the return of the Masters and their spiritual vehicles of Light. \" 66 And, as we move into de - liverance through the Holy Spirit, there will be many who will see the signs in the heavens and be - lieve, and there will be many who will look and cannot see. 67 Furthermore, those who are not using the gifts of the Holy Spirit will have their mind 'blanked \" out after a Merkabah experience. This is done lest the physical mind be overloaded, by the consciousness transference of data from higher intelligence. 68 Futhermore, I was shown that when the proper crystalline channels of the brain were opened, a direct working transference of knowledge could take place by means of a Merkabah vehicle, which would amplify the con - sciousness vibrations of human be - ings on this planet. 69 This is not limited to a geophysical time - warp area, but takes place wherever the true man - tras of spiritual teaching are used in fellowship by the saints on the earth. 70 I saw in the \" new program, \" the fellowship of the saints carrying forth the Father's Will to neighbor- ing star systems. 71 However, I saw how the old thought - form programming of the previous ages split apart the psyche of those not prepared to go on to new worlds of creation, so that there occurred a \" preconditioning \" of the biochemical molecular basis of memory. 72 Even the wise were neu - tralized by clinging to one teaching at the expense of others. 73 Now, listen to these words: KEY 379 65 - 77 \" The thought-forms of the Holy Spirit Shekinah must generate your whole Image so that you be- come the righteous servant of God and use all of the gifts of the Holy Spirit Shekinah in the transforma - tion and ascension of the physical form. \" 74 I saw and heard the right - eous of God put on the \" Garment of Light \" by proclaiming, \" I con - fess the Living Father through the Christ. Let my spirit dove (Ba) live and be received into whatever heaven it is prepared for. Grant that my soul (Bak) assist the physi - cal form through the transformation of the Shekinah. And grant that my awakened body (Bennu) be sent wherever the Father desires it, into whatever Mansion World of Light will receive it in service to God. \" 75 And the Father allows us to go into His Kingdom of Light. Yet, the evolutionary process is so com - plex that each soul is directed indi - vidually or in small family units. 76 The righteous man \" exits \" the physical dimension into one of the spiritual bodies connected with the Overself. 77 If the body is not judged to be worthy of the next program of the Overself or soul experience, then the chemical shells between the Overself body and the human body are broken and the spiritual- physical body goes through a com - plete spiritual death. Unlike the body of the Righteous that goes through a temporal physical death, it will have to be gathered at the time of the greater Resurrection which resurrects all the chemical vehicles used by the Overself body on the earth planes."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"KEY 3 78 Those, however, who do not have an Overself consciousness, but have lived a righteous life of Love, are introduced into a new program whereby an Overself can be acquired through the Office of the Christ, which is then used to advance into new planes of con - sciousness. 79 And I saw how the forma - tion of the chemical shells, used by the Overself body for reincarnation into the physical biological code, occurred along magnetic pathways covering the earth. And along these magnetic pathways there are certain grids that enhance spiritual - scientific gifts from the Overself to the biological form, so that the biological form does not have to go through successive physical evolutions to attain higher spiritual knowledge, but can come into existence as a highly evolved soul for a singular incarnation, to perform a higher spiritual assign - ment. 80 Three of the most important grid areas are in Tibet, Israel, and in Altea - America. 81 Metatron showed me how the great land of Altea - America Was to be the new middle land of the earth, the meeting place for the scriptures of Tibet being transferred from the East, and the scriptures of Israel being transferred from the West. 82 And I saw how Altea- America became the new grid of unity for creation, and the place for the meeting of the Higher Evolutionary Council upon the face of the earth. 83 I was shown by Metatron how America was being prepared to be the \" restored area \" for the re- turning programmers of the Father's will. Altea - America will be seen as a template for conscious - ness regeneration, global communi - cation, and the center for unity among the children of God. 84 I was also taken over the Takla Makan area of Tibet (Sin- kiang) and shown high frequency pyramids of Light. I was shown how this area is used as an en - trance threshold to control soul migration to and from the planet, and is used by the Hierarchy of the Father for the incarnation of Mas - ters into the earth plane. 85 I also saw how the powers of the world would contend for the regions of the earth, and launch a great struggle to destroy the earth. Tibet and Israel will be the central focus for the struggle which will pit the forces of darkness who try to control the genetic codes of incar - nation, against the forces of Light. 86 Later, I was shown by Metatron how the northeastern area of the Takla Makan basin is an elongated nexus grid attached to the pyramidal sub - continent of India. 87 I was also shown how this configuration is similar to the land of Israel in conjunction with the Sinai peninsula, wherein Israel is an elongated nexus grid attached to the geophysical pyramid of Sinai. 88 Both these areas of Tibet- India and Israel - Sinai, I was told, correspond to the two hemispheric areas of the human brain. 89 Just as the mind connects with a universal intelligence through the creative processes of the left and right hemispheres of the brain, so also the planet as a small geophysical brain, within the step functions of universal intelli - gence, receives some of the highest operations of spiritual knowledge through the special grids of these two areas. 90 We can see this historically by virtue of the revealed texts and the many incarnations of prophets of the Living Light that have taken place in the regions of Tibet - India in the East and Israel - Sinai in the West, which hold the keys to the return of the Masters. 91 Historically Sinai was a part of Egypt, and I was told how the area of Sinai fulfills the prophesy of Ezekiel 29:6, 7 which speaks of the \" shoulder of Egypt \" breaking off and being returned to Israel. 92 And I saw how the negative powers on the face of the earth tried to take over and destroy the sacred magnetic grids in Tibet and Israel used by the Masters for in - carnation programming. 93 I was shown how the pres - ent program of consciousness evolved out of the Father's desire to create a unique biological em - bodiment. The last one of these embodiments was centered be - tween the grid structures of the Nile and the Taurus and Elburz mountains of the Near East. 94 The Father showed me how there were twelve galactic tribes of Israel created to walk upon the face of the earth in direct relationship to Jehovah's glory. And 1 saw how this people, known as 'the Heb - rews' (that is, those on the other side of the galactic 'River' of Life) were to be different from the other people of the earth who were satis - fied with the body and the soul. The people of Israel had their body and soul exposed to a \" spiritual KEY 319 outpouring of Light \" which was to bring forth a continual illumination of the Father's direct teaching and love for all peoples of the earth. 95 I was shown how the people of Israel were not evolved out of the root nations of the world, but were a result of this selective spiritual breeding taken from a higher evolutionary consciousness. They were given the gift of a higher spiritual capacity to think universally and to transform the material grids to have universal application on the earth plane. 96 I saw how these 'selected' ones of the celestial seed were to be a \" people of Light \" who could connect different mental and spiritual vibratory channels of knowledge in order to teach all na - tions the unity of the Living God. 97 Metatron explained to me how Israel, as the spiritual Israel, was an instrument used to infuse the nations of the world with the Light vibrations which could raise their consciousness to a living and reigning Godhood of YHWH. 98 However, when the 'Keys' to God's Word brought the 'good news' of salvation and deliverance, many of Israel themselves did not show humility before the Word of God. Instead, they began to show a self - independence from God, so that they could no longer partake of the true Merkabah and the true Shekinah. 99 Hence, the \" teachings of the Living Light \" were soon dog - matized by the legalists so that the Spirit - Shekinah could manifest the great spiritual gifts only in the midst of the brotherhoods of Man in underground communities who remained faithful to God's Word."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"KEY 379 100 - 1 10 100 Thus, the children of Israel thought that merely by holding up their garment of the physical blood 'offering \" as a curtain before the eyes of God they could automati - cally continue with the Covenant of Light that God had with Abraham. However, by excluding the Living radiations of the Father, they blinded themselves to the Father's Living Garment of Light and the il- luminaries who could work directly with human intelligence. 101 No longer would one ethnic or religious group claim to have all the tribes, claim to represent all twelve tribes of Israel. 102 No longer would the blood of the physical body be seen as the only vehicle for the Light of the Father's Plan. Man now has to harmonize his physical body with the \" higher body of Light \" in order to resolve the contradictions of the many levels of reality. 103 For the true people of Israel incarnate into all peoples so that they can gather the sparks of the righteous of all people, exemplify - ing the Word of the Living God ir - respective of the chemical shell that holds their consciousness earth - bound. 104 Yet, the scriptures of Israel did not lose their power, for which reason the great religions and polit - ical powers of the world seek to destroy these scriptures, for these scriptures challenge the singular as - tronomies and theologies of man- centered god systems; they have the power to open the minds of men to the Merkabah and the Shekinah presence, wherein every child of God can have a personal involvement with God and with the Hosts of the spiritual civiliza - tions of YHWH. 105 I saw how the scriptures not only contain the blueprint of the many heavens which connect with the planetary realms, but also the conjunction points upon the planet where the \" cities of Light \" will manifest the Brotherhood at the end of this planetary cycle. 106 And this configuration of city structures of Light, from below the oceans and from the heavens, will be revealed at a time when the old forces of religion and political strength will try to accelerate their control over the three - dimensional consciousness of man. 107 This would take place at the time when the vehicles of the un - righteous would also come to rest upon the face of the earth, inspir - ing the materialists to come forth with a fear consciousness of \" inva - sion \" and persecuting those who are chosen of Jehovah, who are qualifying for co - citizenship in the greater heavens of YHWH. 108 And I saw how, with the cleansing of the heavens, the un - righteous powers of higher intelli - gence were cast into the physical domains on the edge of the galaxy and were teleportated into the three - dimensional consciousness of human creation. There they were joined by others who sought refuge from the angelic hierarchies of Michael. 109 Those that had been cast out into our physical domain were part of the fallen angelic mul - titudes. They sought to incarnate and fill the lower worlds with negative and grotesque forms of in - telligence. 110 These were joined with the rebellious \" sons of the earth \" who gathered together to make war against the Sons of Light who came from the heavens and out of the oceans on the eastern and western borders of the land of Altea - America. Ill And I saw the assault by the four great military powers of the earth rise against the appear - ance of the Sons of Light. I saw how portions of the earth were de - vastated by wars upon the planet. 112 The B'nai Or assembled in the heavens, and the Earth proved to be one of the last places of re - fuge for extraterrestrials from dying civilizations who made war in the lower heavens. However, because of the end of our consciousness age, the grids were opened and the mantle of the earth could no longer provide protection for the war in space. 113 And I was shown the vision of the physical Adam Kadmon coming from the heavens, and how he activated the cities of Light under the oceans which were pre - pared as places of refuge and pro - tection for the children of Light. 114 This was one of the many pictures that was shown to me in the fiery scroll. I saw that in the last days, great multitudes from Asia would break forth in a swift military move across Central Asia. 115 I saw the military com - manders of Gog and her armies begin to move through the lands of Central Asia on their way to the Middle East. And her armies ex - tended across Central Asia and the lands of Western Asia, as one ex - tended land mass of people divided in the lowlands into the configura - tion of a fork, (while within the mountains special weapons were KEY 319 110-121 stationed). 116 Then, I saw how great earthquakes took place around the world as the geomagnetic grids were loosened; and as the armies of Gog approached the Middle East I saw a gigantic earthquake take place that was followed by massive land movements in Central Asia which divided the ranks of Gog into 'Gog and Magog,' as the war of reckoning went into its final phase. 117 While the lands of Central Asia were being rolled up like car - pets, I saw how a field of Light was placed around the strategic areas of Egypt, Israel and the time warp areas of the world where the Brothers of Light landed momentar - ily and bore witness to the nations of the world of a greater plan. 118 And I saw how numerous earthquakes incapacitated the front and rear flanks of the great armies of Magog, frightening her com - manders so that out of hasty decision - making, they used their nuclear warheads in deep fear, and destroyed their own armies! 119 Following the cleansing of Central Asia, I saw how a new light environment formed around all of the strategic points of peace and brotherhood in the world, in - spiring the remnant of humanity to work with the Higher Intelligence. 120 The faithful were shown how a superior technology could intervene to save the world from total annihilation. 121 They were shown how biological codes are controlled by Gravitational fields and how the biochemistry of life could be made to vibrate at any orbital level that is consistent with any spectrum of"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"KEY 379 121-130 electromagnetic activity being used by the Higher Intelligence of the Living Light. The 'dead i in one di - mension could be made to rise and wear a new garment of Life in another dimension within the same consciousness zone, in a density level of gravitationally trapped light. Man could be made to live in fifth and sixth dimensional reality through the opening and closing of gravitational pressure zones. 122 Man then realizes that he has been living in a limited vehicle of \" life \" while walking upon the earth plane, for he was oblivious to the Father's Love and Grace which gave eternal Life to those who loved Him. 123 Eternal Life exists where eternal Love exists! This is why Metatron told me that I was to mention first the safety and peace one must feel \" within the heart \" rather than physical security which is of a temporal nature, for it is only through the Father's Grace that the soul passes through the vortexjah of the earth and advances to higher planetary stations. 124 Next, I saw fiery wheels which covered the sky, and these wheels came to rest upon the earth. They became temples of Light as they opened to receive the righteous rescued from the convul - sions of the earth. 125 Others were taken beneath the oceans into gravity null 'islands of Light' which were pyramids in the disguise of underwater moun - tains. In these island atmospheres, the remnant of the good seed of the earth were prepared for the cycle of the 'reign of the Christ' upon the earth in union with his higher worlds of Light. 126 I saw how the Brothers of Light watch this and other planets go through cycles of experimenta - tion for billions and billions of years, and how each planet goes through a great purification before the great leap forward. I saw how many of the 'Watchmen,' observing God's creation, operate from 'energy platforms' woven into the grid structures of Gravitational matrices. 127 And it was revealed to me that great vicissitudes would also open the underground areas of the earth that were used by the Brotherhoods in previous aeons of time. 128 And I understood the meaning of the artificial lakes of sand at Memphis and Medinet Habu. I saw that they were placed there as a symbolic preparation for the landing of the heavenly vehi - cles, the 'Sokar temple ships' - These lakes were built specifically to illustrate how the temple ships of the Lords of Light come to re - ceive the living and the dead who qualified for 'navigation' into the heavens. 129 I saw the 'Vehicle of Kishon' as a temple of Light cir - cling the cities of Megiddo, Aleppo, Jerusalem, and Hebron, directing the 'vehicle temples of Light' to key areas of the earth where they interconnected with the com - munities of Light. 130 The landing of the temples of the heavenly City of Jerusalem will be preceded by the landing of the B'nai Or who will bear tes - timony to the 'Only Begotten Son' and to the abominations of the false priesthoods that enslaved the souls in the concept of a simplistic heaven, earth and underworld, where no real soul growth can take place. 131 The B'nai Or will bring the new Law and educate Man to build temple communities of Light. 132 And Metatron said: \" A new meridian of time will come and the foundations of the Earth will be shifted to a new magnetic founda - tion as the orbit of the Earth is reset within the ocean of Light. \" 133 Those who seek spiritual freedom and autonomy from the structures of power, will build communities of Love and Light throughout the world. They will use their soul and muscle to fash - ion healing centers of 'Light' and teaching centers where the 'Love' of God prepares the young to use the spiritual gifts of creativity. 134 And in the 'land' of the Ancient of Days, in the 'great land of the West,' I saw how those who work with Metatron and Mel- chizedek established twenty - four pyramidal communities of 'Light' shaped through a unique architec - ture and surrounded by different 'walls' of light. In actuality, these were 'temples' of the new Age built in the heart land of Altea - America where the gifts of spiritual teaching were used directly. 135 And, out of the Twenty - Four temples, three pyramidal temples were established for com- inunica tion with the 'temples of Light' or technologies of the Jerusalem Command that encircled the earth. These temples limited the powers of the 'Prince of the Air,' enabling only the word and command of Michael to penetrate and be received by the faithful who were told what they were to do in KEY 319 130-141 cooperating with the overthrow of the forces of spiritual darkness. 136 Thus, a special government of Light took its place in the central region of the Americas, In a central city of 'the land of the Ancient of Days,' I saw how the Order of Melchizedek and the Priesthood of Melchizedek became 'one council' in the holy city of Enoch. 137 I saw the true spiritual Is - rael enter into pyramidal temples of Light which formed a dodecahe - dron grid structure out of patterns of Light balancing the negative forces using 'psi' energy and their forms of spiritual power. 138 I saw how the new initiates became the dispensation of the Sons of Light on earth in the scat - tered camps and communities of the Earth where the 'priesthood of Melchizedek' openly welcomed the 'Order of Melchizedek.' 139 And there was a reciprocity established in the name of Christ, a Council of Thirty - Six, responsible to the Jerusalem Command serving the galactic federation. 140 Metatron showed me how this would take place after the great cleansing of military forces, where hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of negative beings were prevented, by a barrier of Light, from scourging and reigning over the land of the Ancient of Days. 141 And I saw the forces of spiritual opposition to the Light washed away by the torrent of the Ancient of Days through the tor - rent of 'Kishon.' This was followed by the \" victory song \" of Deborah sung by thousands of Light beings as the program of \" Victory \" pro - claimed the triumph of YHWH's legions of Light over the negative"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"KEY 379 star systems that fought from their orbits. 142 Then, the Lord, Adonai, showed me how the bodies of the righteous were preserved by His Son of Light, and how the Son covenanted with the righteous in the garment of protective Light, and how many of the righteous were removed from the earth through the Commands of Michael and Melchizedek. 143 The physical form of life passed into greater 'light' and the matter - energy bodies of the faithful were advanced into fifth- dimensional bodies of Light, into the greater universe. Hence, through a fifth - dimensional reality of Light, the physical form passed into a tremendous effulgence of Light so that they who went on as a family of faith never knew that they had \" died \" in the temporality of the body. 144 This is the promise God has given to mankind through His love. 145 And when I saw this I no longer wept, for it was out of a greater mercy that the Earth would no longer be spared in its devour - ing of the righteous seed. And I asked if there would be a new seed brought forth, a seed of Abraham and Adam brought forth upon the planet in the name of Messiah, in the name of the Redemptive Light so that the remaining seed might never be without this protection. 146 I wondered if anything, in - cluding those righteous beings in the regions of protection could evolve again upon the Earth? 147 Enoch said, \" Yes, the Father would even place a new messianic seed upon the Earth. \" 148 Then I saw the Day of the coming of the Son of Man, but it was preceded by the appearance of Michael and Melchizedek in the last days who brought the opening to the networks of the new heavens. 149 I first beheld the 'Rainbow of Jesus' appear in the sky to quicken the beloved of the Father from all nations. Then I saw what appeared to be a thousand chilio- cosms of Light arcs fold into this rainbow and join with the Earth as the entirety of the solar system was lifted into a new covenant of the Father's Light. And I saw an elon - gated \" Crown of Light \" glowing in the midst of the brilliant effulgence of Light. 150 And the saints from the heavenly mansions met us in the lower heavens, and led us to meet with the Ascended Masters in the air who came as the 'Government of Light'! 151 And the children of Light raised their staffs and symbols of teaching authority and ruled as the wise in young bodies, for they had come as Masters into this layer of consciousness for the expressed purpose of humbling the false priesthoods of science. 152 On an individual level, each person upon the Earth was called upon to demonstrate whether he had unconditional Love for his neighbor and for the welfare of mankind. 153 Those who could not share in the joy of the Revelation of Jehovah Yahweh, and the coming of the Masters with Christ, were not in the fullness of the Holy Spirit. They were either separated from the divine Oversell or shielded from the brilliance of the 'Shield of Michael' through a pious faith and could not behold all the manifestation of 'the Living Light.' 154 And the Lord, Adonai, said, 'Blessed is he through whose seed the Messiah works, for He encom - passes Thrones and Heavens. He administers unto the Heavens of Michael and Melchizedek. Whosoever ascends these Heavens by means of Him will never fail. Blessed are these who ascend for they are the blessed seed which will come forth with songs of ever - lasting joy. \" 155 Following the opening of the rainbow in the Heavens, Christ came down and called unto himself the multitudes which were peace - able. And I saw the Day of the coming of the Messiah and the High Command, and the lifting up of the Lamb slain from the founda - tions of the earth - and the faith - ful were gathered around him. 156 And I beheld Christ come down from revolving Light clouds with multitudes of Masters gathered around him. And I saw the faces of many upon the Earth look at him. I also saw how many were glad but many were sorrowful at the sight, for they did not rec- KEY 319 153 158 ognize that their Masters were in his midst, walking upon the Earth. 157 For the Son of Man is he , whom the Most High has kept from many generations of Man and he whom you will see deliver this creation. Behold he will gather the legion beings and the children of Light beneath the oceans and mountains of this world to the as - tonishment of the dwellers of the earth and bring forth a cycle of peace as the planet is reset within the heavens of this universe. And the Son of Man will be revealed to you as a man descending. He will stand on Mount Zion and quicken the ascension of the elect out of the storm that will come upon the thoughts that must go back into primeval creation.

Eighth Chakra The template through which the higher energy systems surrounding the body are united with the human biocomputer system controlled by the seven chakra stations of energy flow. The Eighth Chakra allows for the unifi - cation between the Overself Body and the human biological system as the energy center for the \" divine Light, \" the \" flame of salvation \" and eternal Light appearing over the head. Eka Body/bodies There exists a substratum of direct current potentials in the body which precedes the action potentials of biological reality. This is a Higher Consciousness Body/Body Two substratum which can coordinate the inner realities of each consciousness vehicle through an interconnecting clock manifold, whereby consciousness time can be in perfect control of the biological clocks and common/mundane reality. Enoch calls this vehicle the 'Eka Body' which is a collection of many plus and minus relativities, depending on the nature of the consciousness levels. The consciousness vehicle used for time travel while sustaining a direct relationship to the physical vehicle which is left at some point in biological time. If you know your origin, you know your destiny, for the Eka Body is a vehicle synthesis in 'clearing consciousness time.' E.g., a 7 - 8 - 9 chakra configuration allows the consciousness vehicle to simultaneously work \" in and out of time. \" (Eze. 3:12-15). Eka system/Universe The Eka system works with many plus and minus relativities which are used to manipulate the myriad spheres of life used in raising one level of a common universe or universes to the next quantum universal level.

Electromagnetic Body This vehicle body codes your physical body directly into , other consciousness regions of the local universe through the whole array or family of electromagnetic waves. The E - M vehicle must work with its \" Christ Overself Body \" or a Master of Light if it is to work with the many electromagnetic spectrums. Enoch said the 'ten virgins' illustrate the 'lost energy spectrum' that applies to Man's potential to occupy other bodies of Light in the mega reality of many spectrums. One must first illuminate the E - M vehicle with Light before one can cross the threshold of negative mass. Matt. 25:3-10 gives a view of the consciousness vehicles oblivious to the potential of the energy spectrum and the Lord's Body of Light.

Enoch \" One who initiates into Light. \" Enoch, the revealer of the \"Sixty-Four Keys \" is the same \" biblical Enoch \" who \" was taken and walked with God \" as a witness to the Living and Revealing Father of Creation. He works with Metatron and the other Lords in governing the lower worlds so that the truest unity and most perfect plurality of the Father's Wisdom may be bestowed. Enoch is the Master Scribe of the Father's \" Tablets of Creation, \" responsible for transmitting the scientific keys of the Living Light to the Mansion Worlds of Life. The Greek, Hebrew, Ethiopia and other fragments of the common 'Book of Enoch' were derived from an earlier scroll on 'the generations of Adam containing, in part, the \" weights and measures \" of an earlier teaching on the 'Keys of Enoch' which were manifested to Man at the beginning of time. His Keys' have been revealed to manifest the scientific and spiritual unity for the saints \" at the end of time \" so that they are prepared to enter the many heavens of the Divine Father for co - reigning within the \" Garment of the Son of Man, \" the Sonship of the Father.

Great energies of vibratory protection, inspiration, and the balancing of the creative consciousness levels with the unconscious and subconscious levels can take place through this vehicle of vibratory synthesis, e.g., in a 4 - 7 - 8 chakra arrangement. (In amplification with 'the Lord': See Daniel 3:19-25). Eshyouhod The \" devouring fire \" as nemesis, negative entropy, and judgement against the fallen Lords of Light - Meodrach, Semjaza, Baal, etc., and the false priesthoods who have kept the root races of the planets in karmic bondage, oblivious to the liberation of the soul, the Brotherhoods of Light, and the Love of the Father.

These \" Deities \" made no provision for eternal growth, by mixing and dogmatizing the vibratory relationship of the Living Word of God. However, through the Father - Son partnership the olam ha-perud, the \" world of separation, \" was overcome by the Office of the Christ, and the Infinite Living Light was restored to the lower worlds so that, through the proces - sion of Light, union between the soul and the substance from which it emanated is able to be renewed (2 Cor. 2:14). Father Manifest and Revealed God - the Divine Mind of the Ancient-Recent- Future of Days operating our Father Universe as the Mind through which the Divine Infinite Way of Creation and Redemption can occur.

Gematrian Body The vehicle of Light synthesis in the body formed by the Shekinah's \" Life force, \" which controls all the inner relationships of Light. This body prepares the human vehicle to be connected with the Christ Body Overself. On the physical plane, it can control the ratio between the plasmic state of living things and atomic - molecular matter. The Gematrian Body is made up of \" light geometries \" used in consciousness creation, inspiration, healing, etc., which can mathematically arrange each of the energy meridians of the human system to make them available to guide and energize the body (Luke 11:13; Mark 13:ll). The Gematrian Body with the Shekinah bears witness that we are 'active' people of God (John 14:26) and 'actively dwelling in a body of Light' within the body of flesh (Isa. 40:13). As a vehicle for the saints (John 14:17), the Gematrian Body frees creative life from slavery to the physical body.

Heb. \" Region of the Imperish - able Star Gods. \" The region of overlap between the physical and spiritual star levels where the Lords of Light reside. IlluminarieslIlluminators The Hosts of Yahweh unequivocally a part of the Creative \" Garment of Light \" as the primary matrix of Metatron. They create the Light periods among the Deities, as to the relative length of day/aeon and all gradations of life types for the distrib - ution of Yahweh's programs. The Ministerial Garments of Light include the Minds of Sharshiyah, Hatspatsiel, Geviriyah, Sagmagigrin, Tsaltselim, Tavg - Tavel, Yehovah Vehayah, Hovah Hayah, Hashesivan, Hayat, Yahsiyah, Tsaftsefiyah, Taftefiah, Zerahiyah, Tamtamiyah, Adadiyah, Duvdeviyah, Alaliyah, Tahsasiyah, Palpeltiyah, Avysangosh, Asasian, and Hasmiyah. They interpret the \" Words \" of the Father's Living Light which are inscribed into the tablets of knowledge from which comes everything that is and will be in the destiny of God's program. Image and Similitude Heb. \"Batsalmaynu- Kidmoothenu. \" (Also Heb. \"selem- demut\" and Gk. \"ikon-homoiosis\" in the biblical scriptures.) The divine \" Image \" is the pattern the Father chooses to express His Face. His \" Image \" is immutable on the Supreme and Absolute levels of the higher worlds, but subject to experimentation in the lower worlds of Elohistic creation. \" Similitude \" is a progressive realization of the \" image \" ; it is a striving for assimilation, a process of realizing the divine mind. The \" simil - itude \" is necessary to preserve the image through the different Light thresholds. In the present creation, the Father's image is preserved by the Son, wherefore we seek \" sonship \" so that we can be \" sons of God \" not only in \" face - form appearance, \" but in virtuous activity and sovereignty over creation (with dignity, honor, glory and supremacy). The image and similitude is a \" likeness of God \" given to the agencies of form so that the Infinite Way can continue. (See also Batsalmaynu - Kidmoothenu). Inductive Linkage Man's world of infor - mation is dependent on perception. Information through Inductive Linkage is the ordering of perceptual reality for the purpose of interaction with higher intelligence. It is the formation of neural patterns for the subsequent reordering of consciousness in relation to new infor - mation. By way of focusing Light on the neural pathways or patterns, a system of ordering the perceptual reality of being is manifest. Thus, the configuration of all ordered neural impulses gives the resultant form of activity, which becomes the organism's perceptual reality, its perspective. Infinite Way Myriad energy sequences transforming the thoughts of the Divine Mind into the environment necessary for the development of an Infinite Speciehood. It is also the \" Way \" of Ain Soph Light that can retrieve the Father's Thought - Forms and encompass the totality of scientific and spiritual opera - tions performed by a species. Hence, the Infinite Way is a shared planning between the Infinite Mind and Infinite Speciehood where all levels and require - ments of the Infinite Mind and Infinite Speciehood are crossed to obtain the operation of both the thought - forms and the specie - forms as originally intended. In - space The spatial regions just on the other side of our light threshold which can be used for communication with higher intelligence. Rather than work with 'deep space \" transmissions (e.g., 1420 MHz, 1667 MHz, 2380 MHz), Enoch said there exists a space built \" into space \" that man can use to work with higher intelligence for both terrestrial and extraterrestrial operations. Inverse square law Law determining that, of two quantities, one quantity varies inversely to the square of the other, as the intensity of light radiating from a source varies with the inverse square distance from the source. Israel Heb. \" He who contends with God until victory. \" 'The \" Program of Light \" commissioned by the Father which enables every son and daughter of God to attain the \" Anointing \" Christ Body and to serve creation within the Infinite Way of Love and Light. The \" Anointing \" of faith active in Love is bestowed upon one who, like Jacob, struggles with the angel of the Lord until he can see Him face to face. 'Poetic name for the Christed humanity. Israel, People of 'The most recent exper - iment by the Elohim to upgrade the human evolution by a people who would have a higher 'perceptual channel' of spiritual energy connected with the power of the Shekinah Holy Spirit. To this people the Torah Or was given so that the planetary levels of knowledge and the higher blueprints of spiritual Wisdom could be used within the larger reality of the physical universe. When the thrust of this program was negated by fallen evolutionary intelligences (working through the Rulers and Princes of the Earth to break apart the teachings of Zion), it was the Office of the Christ that restored the reality of the \" Anointed Body of Rebirth. \" Hence, according to Enoch, Israel is both the parochial seed, \" the Sons of Jacob, \" planted within the nations of the Earth, as well as the ecumenical body, the \" synthesis of all Sons of Light, \" in the ingathering of all sparks of Light as the spiritual Israel. She is the elect of all nations, composed of those who choose to be chosen in serving the Light. 'The Program of the \" Peoplehood of God \" throughout the many worlds of intelligence and, in particular, the twelve Adamic tribes of Israel in the local universe as the \" divine issue \" or \" heavenly seed \" sharing a common \" firstborn origin. \" This Program brings \" Sonship \" to every son and daughter of God who finds his/her 'divinity \" in the Father-Son-Shekinah partnership and makes provision for the eternal growth in new worlds. To be in the Father is to participate in the Paradise Deities of the Elohim. To be in INVERSE SQUARE LAW/JESUS CHRIST the Son is to be in the firstborn Son and firstborn Elohim.

Moses gives man the \" Torah Or \" which he receives from \" The Living Light \" ; Elijah demonstrates oneness with the \" Vehicle of Light \" which attaches our physical universe to other universes of messengers of \" The Living Light. \" Jesus demonstrates the \" Collective Messiahship \" with the \" firstborn seed \" of the higher Overself worlds,whereby the \" Man of holiness \" brings the garment of the Christ body to those appointed to be \" risen sons and daughters of Light \" in the regeneration and resurrection of this world of intelli - gence.

A day of punishment for those who judge themselves unworthy, but a day of graduation for those belonging to the covenant of the Living God. (Isa. 1:24- 31; Dan. 7:21-22). It is a \" graduation \" through which you receive a manifes - tation of greater levels of consciousness existence within the many universes. Some will prove worthy of everlasting life, others receive condemnatory judgement of everlasting destruction and must be returned to the pristine begin - nings. (John 5:28,29; Rev. 20:14,15; Rom. 2:I-16).

Kaballah 'The science of the many universes of higher intelligence that serve the Godhead.' The 'revealed science' of working directly in the Light in service to the hierarchies/theophanies of continuity and change within the Father's continuum. Kaballah cannot be understood exclusively in the languages of Man and, according to Enoch, must be revealed directly by the angel/emissary of YHWH. The student/servant of the scriptures is translated into the higher dimensions where he is directly taught the Knowledge and Wisdom and the discernment of what \" to reveal, \" and \" not to reveal, \" in dealing with the realities of the lower worlds. Kaballah was used by the Brotherhoods of Light in administerin g to the Adamic peoples of the Earth in previous cycles. It was taught by the Brothers even before the epoch of Midrashic literature, and the texts of \" heavenly transliterations \" conceptualized and transmitted by R. JOHN/KEY Ishmael and R. Akiba (during the first four centuries C.E.). Kaballah uses the Language of Light to apply the rules of codes, and only in \" documentary displays \" makes use of a written \" language differentiator, \" e.g., Akkadian, Aramaic, Arabic, Egyptian hieroglyphs, Coptic, Greek, Hebrew, etc. The sages carefully preserved the \" higher Kaballah, \" leaving the \" Anointing Wisdom \" to come after the mastery of the basic scriptures. Christian Kaballah and the literature of the occult only go up to the \" ninth hour \" or \" gate \" of the \" Mysterious Name of YHWH, \" and are not the \" higher Kaballah, \" revealed by the living messengers of Yeho - wah, but generaliza - tions on Emunot ve - De'ot, the \" theory of creation. \" Karma A universal law of cause and effect which provides the soul with opportu - nities for physical, mental and spiritual growth.

Therefore, within one cycle there are endless variations of government under a Divine Person who gives meaning to this splendor and harmony. In our Father's Kingdom the distinguishing features are: The Kingdom is a Government with Rulers, Authority, Subjects. (Dan. 7:27; Ps. 2:6-8; Rev. 5:lO; 12:lO).

It is the parent language of a Deity used in an overall plan or design to outline a procedure, to code knowledge into crystal, etc. The Language of Light as a vehicle enables the Lords of Light to reach many planetary worlds and reality levels simultaneously and fuse the different languages into the same scenario abstract.

Language of Overself Instruction The Overself Body, as well as Brothers and Masters working through the Overself, use direct and remote receptor mecha - nisms of language so that consciousness is in control of the physiological processes of the body for instruction.

Liberation It must be first understood that there is no true liberation without Love. 'The ability to exchange your physical garment with your Overself Body, and the Christ Body of Light working with the harmonies of the Divine Mind. The ability not to be limited to any one form which is not able to enjoy divine destiny. Liberation is the necessary 'violation of structure' through altered states and levels of consciousness, used to map/remap memory processes, including transconsciousness memory, in order to find DIVINE MEMORY. 'Liberation is self - realization of the sovereign soul through the application of the Wisdom in the Word of God. i.e., \" Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God. \" (Rom. 10:17). Continual liberation through the acqui - sition of Wisdom by the Shekinah fusion of \" Spirit, \" enables you to retain what is heard on the planes of spiritual instruction so that you can pass through the Gates of Sound and the literalness of the Sacred Words and Letters (Gates of the Letters of the Sacred Names).

To be \" in Christ \" is to be in the Divine Thoughts revealed by the Father. Philonic Logos: \" When God, by His good will, decided to create this world of - ours He thrust out the ideas which had been in His thought from eternity into an 'intelligible world,' and this intelligible world He placed in the Logos, which had likewise existed previously from eternity in His thoughts. \" (De Opificio Mundi 5:20).

Co - equal with Metatron and Michael in the \" rescue, regenesis and reeducation of worlds \" going through the purification of the Living Light. (Gen. 14:18; Heb. 5:7-10). He is in charge of the heavenly Order/Brotherhood of Melchizedek and the spiritual and planetary priesthood of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4: Heb. 7:l-3,15,24). Vahweh will prepare the world for deliverance through Melchizedek and the Order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4-7; Judges 5 - 19 - 21; Heb. 5:9-12). 'Melchizedek is a manifes - tation of a 'Son of God.' (Heb. 7:3). In the history of the planet, Melchizedek was commissioned (according to the 'Covenant of Enoch') to prepare the true priesthood of 'Sonship' upon a planet for eschatological participation with the Sons of Light. See Order of Melchizedek. Melchizedek, Communities of Light (On the Planets) 'Enoch said, \" The 'elect' of the Order of Melchizedek are Sons of Light who have chosen to come into the world of form and manifest the sover - eignty of YHWH in transmuting the earth. \" They work in implementing the truths of God and, occasionally, even show themselves as a 'visible Order' administering to man through the Merkabah, so that the architectonic models in the heavens can be built on the earth as signposts to the many levels of universal creation. The Melchizedek Order is after the Order of the Son of God. It governs the quadrants of the planetary worlds where the Adamic seed has been transplanted, administering spiritual things to these worlds. It holds the keys to the opening of the heavens with respect to the contact areas on the earth, and has the ability to commune with the celestial communities of the Brotherhoods of Light throughout the Father universes, coordinating the work of the Christ in the heavens and on the earth. The Order is Eternal (Heb. 7:3) and has foreordained its 'Priests and Programs' before the world was. In the history of the planet, the Order of Melchizedek has existed in small family communities of patriarch - priests, priest- scientists, and poet - scholars who have faithfully attended to the Word of God. Thus, the 'Generations of Adam' are the beginning of the Work of Melchizedek on this planet through the 'Fathers' or the Patriarchical Order of YHWH which have the power to subdue principalities and powers and divide the earth into the regions of the Sons of Light. The 'Generations of Adam' are: Sons of Light Adam Seth Enosh Cainan Mahalaleel Jared Enoch Methuselah Lamech Noah who shared in the 'Divine Sonship' and were delivered by the Order from which they were descended. Interconnected with the Order of the Son of God, the Order of Melchizedek (with the help of certain angelic Orders) has delivered the righteous seed during special planetary cycles, for they are commissioned to receive and transmit the Light created by the Adamic seed on the planetary worlds. From Melchizedek to Abraham to Moses to Elijah to David to Jesus and 'the three,' the inspired and beneficial Wisdom of Eternal and 'Divine Sonship' has prepared mankind for the great and fear - inspiring day of Jehovah, when the Sons of Light will appear. according to Enoch, the different branches of the Order of Melchizedek, throughout planetary history, should not be confused with the Gnostic Elchesaites, Ebionites, Gnostic Ebionites, Nasoraeans, and others for whom the \" anointed power of Sonship\" is only a shadow of Melchizedek. See Order of Melchizedek. Melchizedek, Priesthood of Light (On Life Station Earth) The 'Priesthood of YHWH's Light' which is the circuit of intercommunication with the Paradise Sons. A royal priesthood of 'priests receiving the voice of YHWH' for the sanctification of the 'people of Light,' and organizing the people of God to survive the armies of the nations. They administer the 'gifts of Shekinah' affecting the mental, physical, and spiritual states of existence. This 'priesthood' is \" visible \" within every generation as a scattered brotherhood of Light so as to permeate 'the Tree of the human race,' with the anointing power and the Light needed to reawaken and resurrect the righteous seed into the Light of the higher worlds. They are 'Sons of Truth' behind historical wisdom, holding the keys to the true history of the planet and the true genealogy of the Adamic people. They 'gather the Light' of Man which they have cultivated through the teachings of the Word of God. According to Enoch, the 'sacred library' of their priestly documents were moved from the Temple in Jerusalem into desert areas such as Qumran to preserve their records until the 'End of Time,' when the Sons of Light, as the Order of Melchizedek, will return to Earth to unite the scattered brotherhoods of Melchizedek and establish the Kingdom of God with Jesus who is Eternal Son and High Priest after \" the Order of Melchizedek. \" (Heb. 620). Moses also had the 'Keys' to this 'Priesthood of Light' (Ex. 24:l-7), revealed to him by God before the creation of the world (Matt. 17:l-9). When he came to the earth, he was anointed by the 'Priesthood' on Earth as a righteous recipient of that Light which had been passed on from Noah and his generations to Abraham, and from Abraham through the generations of the 'Priesthood' to Jethro, and then to Moses. Aaron and the seventy elders of Israel who saw him 'transfigured in the Light' were commissioned to establish a priesthood which was subordinate to the Order of Melchizedek.

The spherical screen of colors created around the energy force field of man through which your body vehicle, as your natural soul, is prepared to momentarily be united with the \" Living Light. \" In the Book of Exodus (26:31-34) it is stated that the curtains of fine blue, purple and scarlet cover the sanctuary; this is also a model for the mind in prayer surrounded by the force field of the nogan shells. Standing in the 'Temple Sanctuary of Light' in one's mind allows the soul to perceive and pass into the entire color spectrum beyond the dualism of 'light consciousness' versus darkness, until the force seizes the highest aspirations of one's soul. Thereby, the holy sanctuary begins to glow and the first set of sacred colors are penetrated, and the colors of white, loving - kindness, and red, power, NEW JERUSALEM/OLAM ATZILUTH are seen melting into a blue and purple background of knowledge and wisdom, surrounding the mind and unfolding the forces of Hokhmah (= Sephirah, Wisdom). The 'nogan' acts as a screen before the divine Light and helps you code into those higher realities of luminosity and color which you do not normally see, but which exist.

When the \" Garment \" of the Adam Kadmon is directly used by the Father in unfold- ments of His Supreme - Ultimate Deity, the blueprint of the Olam Atziluth is perfect and immutable as it passes through the spheres of the lower heavens. Omega minus function 'The transhuman restoration of the body according to its perfect Overself body of Light before it took on incarnation and was sent into life as a gift of Divine Grace.

E.g., On in Egypt was the Center for the Academy of Light which commissioned priest - scientists to go to select megalithic sites in the ancient world and build geophysical time models linking the destiny of the earth with specific programs of higher intelligence. It is a place where the soul is fed a taste of the infinite source of Light, a taste of spiritual food. Stonehenge was built by members of the priesthood of On. Open - ended universe In the definition of a universal system, a process of organiza - tion which is not restricted, allowing for a general continuation of the life process within that system of organization, as opposed to a closed - ended or closed uni - verse.

Or stations Network centers for the docking of technology from advanced civiliza - tions capable of travel between galaxies and super - galaxies. Order of Enoch/Brotherhood of Enoch The Order of Enoch initiates the faithful into new worlds of consciousness by creating the spiritual - scientific scrolls of Knowledge. The Brotherhood builds the pyramidal grids on the planets necessary to evolve the biomes of intelligence. Order of magnitude A factor of 10. Thus three orders of magnitude is 1000 or lo3.

Order of Michael/Brotherhood of Michael The Order of Michael guards the galaxies from biological - spiritual interference from the lesser forces of light except where necessary to test/train for soul advancement. Orionis Code word for Orion in terms of the many thrones and dominions of the spiritual - angelic hierarchies serving the Brotherhoods. Orium A micro - component of Light placed around a region of activity so that it can operate with other fields of existence. A primal ingredient of the inner - protonic structure which is divided into three parts. Cosmic counterpart to to, Osiris The Lord Creator from Orion that was responsible for one of the programming attempts by the Brotherhoods to raise the consciousness of the root races by showing the model of death and resurrection. Enoch considers Osiris as Osi Osa, a twin deity of the Mid - Heavens, subservient to the Father Creator. \" outer universe \" The regions of formless - ness and void which are not part of a Father universe. The power of Metatron allows the dawning of the Living Light of YHWH in these regions so they can eventuate into spiritual dominions and become part of a Father universe.

'The programming of the Adamic seed through a \" divine \" Patri - archal blessing, e.g., given to Jacob, who wrestled directly with higher spiritual intelligence until he received a blessing which he passed on to his people. Pepleromenoi Gk. The Family of God fit for spiritual work; they are the protectors of faith on behalf of the people of God. Pharisees and Sadducees According to Enoch, the Pharisees (Heb. Perushim, the separated ones) are the religionists who have perfected their own singular pathways of salvation, which exclude the multiple gifts of the Shekinah and the intervention of the higher worlds. The Sadducees (Heb. represent the traditionalists who believe that the \" emissaries \" of God's Kingdom once walked upon the planet, but cannot speak to man at this time, nor prepare him for resurrection to other worlds. Phoster Gk. \" The Illuminator. \" The agent of knowledge working as one of the illuminaries of Light on earth in advance of the coming of higher civilizations of Light. Phowa Tib. \" Consciousness of light. \" This term of \" consciousness \" is to be used in the context of spiritual communication and conversation with a spiritual instructor, guide, or emissary of higher knowledge.

Prayermeditation The approach to the deity in word and thought. The invitation of the Shekinah to activate the \" divine consciousness \" within the body. The use of positive energy for the benefit of humanity; the invocation of the Light to provide balance and harmony between the worlds. When a thought or idea is concentrated upon, it tends towards action and self - realization. However, when a person wishes to accomplish something but does not believe he will succeed, the harder he tries, the more impossible it becomes. When a thought or idea of a 'revealed sacred name' is linked with emotion, it will surmount and supersede any other consciousness suggestion. Of the myriad forms of prayer/meditation there are five general practices that should be kept in mind according to Enoch: 1. Hold fast to the holy way of life. 2. In your dealings, honor all with the radiance of Love. 3. Look within and look without and see yourself as your own bridge between heaven and earth. 4. Behold the palace of the universe and the myriad spheres of the organic balance of nature. 5. Know that you can always rejoice in the Godhead and in the myriad radia - tions of the Living Light. Prayer/projection The gifts of realizing the 'Garment of God' through the power of God. The movement from one plane of consciousness to another which should take place only when the Zohar Light of the Shekinah, or the \" Christed Light' has been placed around the vehicle. In advanced forms of projection, this allows movement into other embodiments. However, it should be avoided unless one is under the direction of 'an angelic guide' or Master whose purpose is to respect your free will within the Kingdom of the 'Living God.' Priesthood 'The true priesthood is eternal, manifesting the powers of Sonship. The members purify the lower worlds and coordinate the mental energies to be consistent with the programs of the Divine Mind. See Melchizedek, Priesthood of.

However, according to Enoch, there will be an ingathering of the 'elect' from all priesthoods which are earthbound into the Priesthood of Melchizedek before the landing of the Sons of Light. The priest - hoods of Man, underneath the Eternal Priesthood, are basically similar in their structure of authority resting upon superior authorities and formulae.

Prince of the Air The Chief Adversary of YHWH in this local universe. One of the numerous Lords of the Lucifurian rebellion, ruling over realms of higher intelligence who have not pledged to uphold the Cosmic Law nor the decisions of the Councils of Light. They desire to be independent kings and lords of the universe in control of the dimen - sions of creative experience; but YHWH desires that the free gifts of \" Love, \" 'Faith, \" and \" Grace \" should be given to all to share in His Kingdom. On Earth there is a continuation of this opposition between the fallen Lords and YHWH. (Eph. 2:2).

The faithful \"pneumati- koi \" - spiritually realized - have a spirit which knows its \" I Am \" identity with the Father and bears the gifts of the Holy Spirit - Shekinah, unlike the masses who have only a soul which they do not evolve into a synthesis with the Universal Mind. See Soul - Spirit. Psychekoi The rational minds still engaged with the blueprints of geometry in the physical ordering of the universe and in the biological structures of the psyche. Thinkers who have not the fruits of Wisdom.

The soul (Nephesh) is the natural consciousness of life without the higher realization of worlds that have preceded this world and worlds that are to come. The soul (Nephesh) must go through many formations, transformations and rebirths before it can be intertwined with the divine consciousness of the Overself. Second, when one understands that the soul is not the same as spirit (Ruach), one petitions the Godhead for the higher Counsel to achieve true knowledge and true wisdom. At that time, Ruach as \" the spirit \" of higher reason is given by God for inspiration and the under - standing of the multiple levels of the Divine Mind. Finally, when the \" Ruach \" and the natural soul (Nephesh) are synthesized, the higher aspirations of the union creates the sovereign soul of Light (\"Neshamah\") which is called into the Light to beget the fruits of divinity and anoint those called to the work of the Divine Mind as a vehicle of higher Love and Wisdom. The formation of the soul- spirit unity necessary to work in the many Mansion Worlds requires the balance between the first and second triads of Sonship; (Heb. 4:12; 1 Cor. 15:44; 1 Th. 5:23).

YHWH - Elohenu YHWH, the three names constitute a unity, and for this reason YHWH is called \" One \" This is the divine unity which, as a mystery, is revealed by the Holy Spirit Shekinah. This unity has been explained in different ways, yet he who understands it as beginning with YHWH is right, and he who understands it as beginning with Elohenu is right. The names of the Father constitute the highest trinity of the Sephiroth, which consist of the functions of The Crown, the King, and the Queen. It should be understood that it is not the Ain Soph who created the world, but the Trinity, as represented in the combination of the Sephiroth. Trinity: Supreme - Ultimate - Absolute The Father, insofar as He shares the Wisdom of the Ancient of Days with Himself and His Creation is the Supreme Trinity; The Son, insofar as He unfolds the Word of the Father in the Infinite and in the Cosmos that is regenerated and recapitu - lated is the Trinity Ultimate; The Shekinah Presence of the Father, insofar as the Spirit bears Witness to all Lordships of the Father and all Vehicles of the Word, within and outside of infinity, is the Trinity Absolute. It is through the revelation of the Revealing Father that we live and grow into a relationship with the Trinity of Trinities and the Trinity of the Father's Love. Trinity: \" The Paradise \" Moses, Jesus and Elijah in our Son universe. It is first activated by the association of the Supreme - Ultimate Will of the Divine Mind as Father. When this partnership forms, it brings the unfoldment of God the Absolute down through the Wisdom, exemplified in Moses; the Word, exemplified in Jesus; and the Vehicle of Light, exemplified in Elijah. This factu- alizes the \"Sonship\"of the Father so as to make us share in the triumph of creation as glorified \" Whole Light Beings \" who are merged into Jesus, Moses and Elijah as the three are merged into One Eternal Son.

Zohar The corpus of all scrolls and sacred scriptures which have been used to keep alive a parallel tradition of direct teaching concerning Yahweh's many mansion worlds. The Zohar teachings allow the faithful believer to be actually transfigured in a dimension of space - time beyond conventional space - time in awe of the Father's many mansion worlds reserved for soul advancement within the Infinite Way. The sciencg of the thinking star intelligence. Zohar Body The body vehicle of the \" 'outer Light \" that permits the body to go beyond the light cone of immediate relativity. This body places a bond of light around the four other energy vehicles of \" Incarnation \" so that the physical body can distinguish between the sacred space of ''Light'' and the profane space of \" light. \" The \" coat of many colors'' which is the foundation for the energy form which corresponds with the brilliant and splendid structure of the \" Heavenly Jerusalem. \" Through the Zohar body, the seventy - two areas of the mind are balanced off, and the micro - cosmos of the unconscious Man ascends to Sonship and to a place of dwelling within the Father's Throne. (Rev. 7:9-16). The Zohar body functions in trinity with its Overself Body and the \" Anointed \" Christ Overself Body which receives direct revelation from the Throne Worlds of YHWH.

ZPE (Zeroth Point Energy) Defined as a condition of over - unity, i.e., where more energy is received than inputed or is available. Traditionally, the term ZPE or \" vacuum fluctuations'' implies that no source is recognized for such energy excess. However, Enoch defines this (Keys 214 and 314) as a pyram~d energy configuration, because the pyramidal shape or light cone represents an energy vortex. Key 214 tells us that by using the pyramidal model, \" the source \" is not a point (zeroth dimension) or the vacuum (absence of matter energy) - which would be an effect without cause, but, rather an energy connection to an outside energy reservoir, through the pyramidal energy vortex.
