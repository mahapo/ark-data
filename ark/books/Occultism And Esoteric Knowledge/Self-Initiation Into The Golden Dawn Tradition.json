It is the beginning of a new phase or outlook on life; the passage into a dis- tinctly new type of existence. The characteristics of this event are marked by an expansion of the mind to include an awareness of i:!1iliilS6 higher levels of consciousness. Initiation represents spiritual growth; the commencement of a new life committed to an entirely new set of prin- ciples from those of mundane society. Initiation is the precursor of immortality. Humankind has the potential for immortality, but only obtains it when men and women align themselves with that immortal spiritual essence that underlies all aspects of the manifest universe; that same spiritual essence which is too often ignored by the great majority of humanity. Obtaining that rare and splendid essence is the supreme objective of that part of the Western Esoteric Tradition known as magic. The goal of all magical processes is the purification of the natural human being-that is, the extraction of the pure gold of spiritual Selfhood from the husk of the outer personality. Magic is a spiritual science. It is a specialized system of discipline which has a spiritual rather than material goal. This is a personal science that is based upon the fundamental knowledge of the true human being which lies beneath the illusion of the outer, secular human. Ceremonial magic incorporates a process of memorization and ritual which results in the direct stimulation of the Will and the exaltation of the Imagination. The final objective of all this is the purification of the lower personality and the realization of an elevated state of consciousness, wherein the magician's ego enters into a union with his/her own Higher Self and ultimately with the Divine. Every action, idea and utterance in any ceremony is designed to bring about this final conclusion. Each and every detail of the ritual itself, including banishings, circumambulations, evocations and invocations, serves to remind the operator of this single goal. \"For the assault on the Holy City, every sense and every faculty is deliberately mobilized, andthe whole individual soul of the operator must enter into the act. \"1 Every impression, by means of a Hermetic and Qabalistic system of associated ideas, is made the beginning of a sequence of related thoughts which culminate in the ultimate aim of the ceremony. When emblem after emblem has infiltrated the mind of the magician, and the ritual act has stimulated his/her emotions to a fever pitch, then the absolute moment of 1 Israel Regardie, The Tree of Life, pg. 107. xv"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"xvi SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRADITION spiritual ecstasy is attained. A clear and open channel is created between the mind and the soul, concluding in an increased concentration of magical abilities and the exaltation of the true and divine nature of the magician. To accomplish these lofty goals in the tradition of the Golden Dawn, mem- orization of certain materials known collectively as \"Knowledge Lectures\" is very important. The Hermetic Art is a true science and would-be magicians must com- mit the rudimentary knowledge of the system to memory, just as if s/he were a stu- dent entering a school of medicine or engineering. Physicians and engineers require years of training to achieve their career goals. This training naturally includes much memorization of materials that are important to the specific trade. Training and study are no less imperative for the magician who seeks to journey between the astral realms and explore the inner workings of the human mind. Magic is real. It is not something that should be toyed with by \"dabblers\" who know next to nothing about the subject, but assume that it would be fun to \"make something happen.\" Surgeons who practice medicine without a license often end up in jail. Superficial occultists who occasionally manage to open psychic doors without knowing what to do next sometimes end up in mental hospitals. This is what makes the Golden Dawn's curriculum of study so important to any student of the Western Magical Tradition. Memorization of a large amount of information is required. This material is fundamental to building a solid foun- dation of knowledge that will steadily become second-nature to the magician, enabling him/her to perceive more clearly the astral influences that permeate the physical world-influences which the average person cannot perceive. The con- scious commitment to learn the symbolic (magical) alphabet of the unconscious mind results in the cultivation of psychic reflexes which aid the magician and make all ceremonial work flow more smoothly. But more importantly than this, the memorization of magical data changes the very structure of the psyche, which is gradually infiltrated by holy symbols that speak on a subconscious level to the Divine Being in each of us. The mind of the magician is steadily purified by this process as an increasing percentage of mundane thoughts are supplanted or trans- formed by spiritual thoughts. Initiation is the preliminary step in the realm of magic. A true initiation is the inner and hidden essence which pushes the student to seek the Path of Knowl- edge with a tenacity that cannot be denied. This initial step is the enfolding of the Divine Light; the gentle nurturing of the spark of consciousness within the Inner Self. Attaining this point of growth requires peace of mind, awareness of one's subconscious impulses, persistent hard work and a certain degree of self-sacrifice. When the secret recesses of the Inner Self have been reached, communication with the universal Power is then possible. And by the single act of one student tapping into this Divine Power, the whole of humanity is enriched. The word \"mystery\" plays an important role in the drama of initiation. It is derived from the Greek word mysteria, meaning \"that which is reserved for ini- tiates only.\" Several magical groups and secret societies have a tradition of tracing their ancestral roots back to the mystery cults and religions that flourished in the ancient world. Many people were drawn to these mystery religions because of the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Introduction xvii sense of spiritual vitality and rapture they provided through elaborate induction ceremonies. To be an initiate means that one is accepted into an inner circle whose teachings and rituals are meaningful only to other members of the group who share this common experience. It confers a sense of status and belonging, and of having been uplifted through the disclosure of divinely inspired wisdom. The candidate seeking admittance must first prove him/her self worthy of inclusion into the group or magical tradition. The ritual of initiation is meant to purify and prepare the candidate to receive the secrets and teachings of that tradition or cur- rent. Anew initiate does not receive the total volume of knowledge immediately, but in gradual stages. This process of spiritual evolution begins at the bottom of a hierarchical ladder, each step of which is accompanied by an additional initiation ceremony and further study. Initiation is also a wonderfully fulfilling experience. Acandidate entering the temple for the first time is in a heightened state of awareness; adrenaline is pumping through the body, the senses are amplified-the whole being of the can- didate is poised and ready to receive an influx of energy. All of this is brought about by the conscious decision to be initiated. We have seen some candidates moved to tears or fainting with joy from the energy of an initiation ceremony. This is the power of the decision to begin a spiritual Path.s \"Longhast thoudwelt in Darkness, Quit theNight and Seek the Day.\" This one sentence from the Neophyte Ritual of the Golden Dawn encompasses the primary goal and aspiration of the student of the Mysteries; to exchange the mundane for the Divine. That goal is based upon a journey of self-discovery and spiritual attainment. It is not just the awareness of the Divine, but also the bringing forth of divinity into daily life. The very name of the Order-The Golden Dawn-alludes to the shining brilliance of the Eternal and Divine Light, breaking through the con- fines of Darkness to herald the birth of a new day in the evolution of humankind. The aim of all the rituals and practical magical work of the Golden Dawn is to cre- ate a spiritual bond between the magician and the Immortal Self. The purposes for which the G.'. D.'. was formed were twofold; first, through study, teaching, and organization, to serve as guardian of the Western Esoteric Tra- dition, and second, to initiate, educate, and nurture those individuals called to carry on the Great Work (that is, to become more than human, and to achieve union with the Divine). For those individuals who are called to the Western Esoteric Mysteries, the Golden Dawn system presents itself as a vital, consistent, and secure method for spiritual enhancement. The fundamental practices and techniques of the Golden Dawn's system of psychic development are threefold; the first is initiation (astral and physical), the second is assimilation of Qabalistic and Hermetic knowledge (the basic alpha- bet of the magical language), and the third is personal ritual work. All three are 2 For one of my initiation ceremonies, I had undertaken a three-day fast and frequent meditations beforehand. During the ritual, the smell of the incense, the symbols, the sounds, the speeches of the officers, and every single aspect of the ceremony was so powerful and overwhelming to me that at a moment of supreme realization and influx of energy, my knees began to fail me and I had to be supported by one of the officers as the ritual continued. It was without a doubt one of the turning points in my life.-STC"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"xviii SELF-INITIATION INtO THE GoLDEN DAWN 'fRAomoN prerequisites for advancement into the Golden Dawn Tradition. Initiation by itself is pointless without the repeated practice of ritual techniques and individual cer- emonial work. Likewise, performance of advanced Golden Dawn rituals, such as the consecration of Elemental weapons without the knowledge of certain funda- mentals such as the Hebrew Alphabet, is similar to constructing a building with- out first pouring a foundation-the project is likely to collapse. All three aspects of the G:. D:. system must be undertaken equally in order for the system to work the way that it was intended to work. There is no need for us to present a history of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn here, since that subject has already been covered at length by vari- ous authors. The Magicians of the Golden Dawn by Ellie Howe, The Golden Dawn: Twilight of the Magicians by R. A. Gilbert, Sword of Wisdom by Ithell Colquhoun, and Ritual Magic in England by Francis King should all be consulted for the light that they shed on the history of the G:. D:. and its various offshoots. The history of the modem incarnation of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn has been suc- cinctly covered in the Epilogue of our book Secrets of a Golden Dawn Temple. This book will concentrate instead upon the techniques that are essential for the soli- tary student to be able to initiate him/her self into the Golden Dawn's current of magic from Neophyte through the Portal grade, providing a complete curriculum of study for the Outer Order grades. Self-initiation into the G:. D:. current of magic has been a subject of much speculation and discussion. However very little practical information has been pre- sented upon the subject. Israel Regardie was a vocal champion of the idea that a student could initiate him/her self through the grades of the Golden Dawn. He put forth the opinion that by repeated performance of such rituals as the Opening by Watchtower and the Middle Pillar Exercise, the aspiring magician could effectively be considered an initiate of the G:. D:. current. (Note: These rituals are provided in Chapter Six of this book.) However, he also stated thatthis hinged upon the stu- dent's own persistence, hard work and determination. The responsibility for spiri- tual progress is placed squarely on the shoulders of the student. There is only one person to blame if indolence keeps spiritual growth from occurring. The need for Self-initiation is born out of the fact that it is not always possi- ble for prospective students to live in an area that is close to an officially recognized initiatory temple. Especially here in the U.S., students have often had to spend a lot of money on transportation to an official temple in order to receive an initiation. Since there is a total of no less than seven initiation ceremonies required to become an Adeptus Minor, it is easy to see how expensive the process of traveling to a tem- ple can become. This has led to various magical groups offering correspondence courses and astral initiation by proxy. However, these too are often highly expen- sive undertakings which do not address the solitary student's basic need to moni- tor his/her own psychic growth in a meaningful and spiritually fulfilling manner. (Some groups even bestow instant Adepthood with virtually no Outer Order train- ing whatsoever; for a fee, almost anyone can get a certificate proclaiming one to be an Adeptus Minor [or even an Adeptus Exemptus!]. The spiritual value of grades obtained in such a manner is, of course, highly questionable.)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Introduction xix It was Israel Regardie's wish that students of the Golden Dawn tradition qui- etly and patiently continue the Order work and goals as instituted by Mathers and Westcott, without a lot of hoopla or fanfare. Regardie was a man of strong convic- tions who was adamantly opposed to several of the factors which historically tear magical groups of all traditions apart and shift the focus of such groups away from spiritual concerns-including schisms, egotistic pontificating or self-aggrandizement on the part of group leaders, the idea of soliciting money in return for grade initia- tions, and pointless bickering between this group and that group. And for all that Israel Regardie has done to singlehandedly keep the G:.D:. tradition alive and available to all, some people now claim that Regardie had no lineage to the Golden Dawn, in the same manner that some Wiccans have tried to denounce Gerald Gard- ner after all he had done for Wicca. There are even some individuals, who after sup- posedly self-initiating themselves into high degrees, now claim that self-initiation is not possible for others-that the prospective student must go to them for a proper ini- tiation. Not all magical groups or fraternities manage to maintain their high spiritual ideals under the onslaught of such integrity-killers as ego or profit-making. Another problem with correspondence courses is that although they offer genuinely good material, it is often presented in a manner that is unrelated to the original Order teachings. Some groups add Thelema, Eastern esoteric practices, Odinism, or other elements which are totally unconnected to the established teachings of the Golden Dawn. This often results in a hybrid curriculum which no longer resembles that of the Golden Dawn, either in content or in essence. Although most of the Golden Dawn's curriculum from Neophyte through the sub-grade of Zelator Adeptus Minor has already been published, there is no rea- son for Neophytes to be instructed to perform Inner Order rituals such as the Ban- ishing Ritual of the Hexagram and the Rose Cross Ritual,\" This problem originated from the fragmentary presentation of the Outer Order grade work given in Israel Regardie's The Golden Dawn. The Knowledge Lectures presented by Regardie are in reality little more than a student's lecture notes, which were originally supple- mented by oral Order teachings. To \"flesh out\" the Outer Order curriculum as pre- sented in The Golden Dawn, many magical correspondence groups have taken what was traditionally the Inner Order curriculum (study work and rituals) and trans- ferred it to the grades of the First Order. The end result is Neophytes and Zelators being asked by their instructors to perform unnecessary busywork, complex Second Order studies.' and advanced work such as the construction of the Elemental weapons,\" or the painting of several Trees of Life in the various Qabalistic color 3 The Hexagram Ritual and the Rose Cross Ritual were traditionally taught in the Second Order, the RR et A.c., not in the First Order of the Golden Dawn. 4 Such as Enochian. While I was in the Practicus grade, I once informed Regardie that I was taking up the study of the Enochian Alphabet. Regardie told me in no uncertain terms to \"cease and desist.\" He was adamant in his belief that Outer Order students should leave Enochian alone.-STC 5 The construction of these tools (Earth Pentacle, Air Dagger, Water Cup and Fire Wand) is part of the gradework of a Neophyte Adeptus Minor. That is why they are referred to as the tools of a Z.A.M.- (Zelator Adeptus Minor). They are never used in the Outer Order. A student who makes these tools during the Elemental grades will often express the desire to remake them in the Adept grade, due to"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xx SELF-IN1TIATION INTO 1HE Gou:lf.N DAWN 1itAomoN scales-work which is traditionally undertaken by the Adeptus Minor as part of his/her gradework,s By overloading the Outer Order student with Inner Order work, a curious thing often happens-the student is overwhelmed and eventually drops out. Moreover, there is certainly ample Order material to be found which is suitable for the Neophyte and Elemental grades, without having to loot the Inner Order curriculum and deprive the Adeptus Minor of his/her proper gradework.7 It is not that we condemn such practices or that we wish to brow-beat stu- dents into refraining from work that is \"beyond their grade\" (a phrase which often reeks of egotism and suggests that the teacher might be trying to conceal his/her own lack of knowledge). The point we are trying to make is that by adopting Sec- ond Order study work into the First Order curriculum, the student is no longer fol- lowing the traditional teachings of the Golden Dawn in the manner in which they were intended to work. The First Order of the Golden Dawn was and is a solid foundation where the student gathers the tools, building materials and information necessary to: (1) receive an influx of Divine Light, (2) establish an alignment upon the Tree of Life and correspondingly imprint the Tree within the psyche, (3) stabi- lize the unbalanced portions of the psyche through Elemental equilibration, and (4) create the groundwork and solid substructure necessary for further magical work in the Adept grades. Teachings taken from the higher grades and given to Outer Order members often obscure the original goal of the Golden Dawn-that is to carefully and steadily build a firm bedrock of knowledge that will ground the stu- dent and insure that s/he will grow to be a psychically balanced and knowledge- able Adept who is then fully capable of safely performing advanced Elemental, Planetary, Zodiacal and Sephirotic workings. Many Neophytes and Zelators are simply not ready to take on Adept-level work in which the Golden Dawn system's built-in psychic safeguards are disregarded or abandoned. We are not implying that the curriculum of the Golden Dawn has remained stagnant and unchanged for one hundred years, extolling the weary cry of \"Tradition! Tradition!\" Nothing could be further from the truth. The teachings of the Golden Dawn have evolved, are evolving, and will continue to evolve as modem Adepts add to the Golden Dawn's pool of knowledge. The Golden Dawn Companion by R. A. Gilbert provides good examples of how something as essential as the Neophyte obligation has changed over the years to better serve the needs of added insights gained through initiatory experience. However, some of our temples still suggest that students construct these tools in the Elemental grades. Our advice to students who wish to make these implements in the Outer grades is this: paint all names and sigils on the implement except for the magical motto, which can be added after completion of the Portal grade-when the initiate traditionally changes his/her motto. It would be problematic to have a Second Order Imple- ment with an Outer Order motto inscribed on it. 6 This is part of the grade work for the Rodas Chamelionis, an Adeptus Minor who is on the Path of the Chameleon-or the Path of Mixed Colors. 7 Our position on this matter is as follows: We never dissuade any responsible student from taking on study workor performing rituals that are beyond their grade, particularly if the student is already magically advanced and balanced-however, we do not encourage it either. We simply do not promote Second Order work in the First Order as Outer Order gradework. (Our one exception is the Middle Pillar exercise which Regardie advocated as a highly important exercise for maintaining psychic balance.)---CC & STC."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Introduction xxi initiates. The teachings of the modem day Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, established by Israel Regardie, have also evolved and adapted to meet the needs of today's students; and new information on Egyptian magic, Coptic magic and more, continues to be discovered by archeologists and magicians-information that was simply not available in MacGregor Mathers' day. One such modem change in Golden Dawn instruction is the teaching of Geomancy in the Earth grade of Zelator, rather than in the Water grade of Practicus where it was taught a century ago,\" Another change is the re-introduction of basic Astrology into the Outer Order. The formal teaching of Astrology was at one time dropped from the Order, since it was then felt that the student could find ample information on the subject from sources outside the Golden Dawn. Although such reasoning is quite true, we have nonetheless seen fit to add this basic information back into the Outer Order curriculum, because it becomes all too easy for students to skip over information that they are not presented with up front. Oftentimes students come into our Order with previous knowledge of advanced ritual work from the back of Regardie's The Golden Dawn. Inevitably they advance through the grades and discover that through the discipline of the traditional Outer Order curriculum, they experience completely new insights con- cerning the Golden Dawn that they never imagined beforehand. This brings us to the idea of \"legitimacy.\" Does a student who is working alone need to be a member of a legitimate initiatory temple of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn? The answer is no. Whether or not one is a member of an offi- cially recognized temple has no bearing on his/her spiritual and magical growth. With the Golden Dawn's curriculum and most of its important papers already published, the tools for advancement into the G:. D:. current are already at the aspirant's fingertips. It is possible today for the student to become his/her own initiator. Any individual or group that claims sole ownership of the Hermetic Tra- dition or claims to be the official \"Grand High Muckety-Muck of the World\" is doing occult students a great disservice by blowing off a good deal of hot air. The same is true for anyone who claims to know magical \"secrets\" that can only be bought for a high price. The student needs to use discretion and put some mea- sure of trust in his/her own latent spiritual abilities. Questions of the legitimacy or heredity of a magical group can in fact get in the way of spiritual progress if a student becomes more interested in buying or otherwise obtaining a magical merit badge from a recognized group, rather than securing union with one's Holy Guardian Angel. Empty gestures and hollow proclamations of high degrees and titles mean little or nothing to one's own Higher Self. The intent and determina- tion to achieve union with the Divine is the only important consideration in advancing to the path of an initiate. And to do this, one need not be a member of any recognized magical group. What is a magical tradition or current? This is a concept which may hold dif- ferent meanings for different people. Here we will refer to the current of the Golden Dawn as a specific stream of energy that has empowered the Western S The practice of Geomancy or \"Earth Divination\" is more appropriate to the grade of Zelator."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xxii SELF-INITIATION IN10 THE GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON Magical Tradition since ancient times. This magical current has surfaced at various times and places in history as different magical groups with similar ideas, teach- ings, techniques and goals. As we have already stated, anyone can tap into this current by studying and applying oneself to the magical work of the current. An egregore is a specialized aspect of a current. The word egregore comes from a Greek word meaning \"watcher.\" Whereas the current can be likened to a large river, the egregore is like a small adjoining stream. The current is the raw power-some- what of a blind force-compared to the egregore, which is a more interactive and personal force. When we speak of a group egregore, we are talking about the dis- tinctive energy of a specific group of magicians who are working together. The single current can sustain several different group egregores. As indicated earlier, there are two forms of initiation: astral and physical. The first type occurs on the subtle planes of the astral and is not always perceived by the initiate until after the fact, although s/he can also sometimes be aware of it as it is occurring. This type of initiation is conferred upon a person directly by spiritual archetypes within the psyche. A physical initiation is just what it sounds like-an actual ceremony carried out by officers in a physical temple. Some might think that the astral initiation is the only kind that matters-the physical one being only an outward reflection of an inner process. This is simply not the case. A phys- ical initiation reaffirms the candidate's spiritual intent and Will by the act of sub- mitting him/her self to the process of the initiation ceremony. It is a physical proclamation to the manifest universe of one's desire to follow the path of an initi- ate of the Mysteries. Depending upon the candidate, it is sometimes unlikely that an astral initiation would ever occur without the physical initiation and the skill of the participating initiator. What is clear, however, is that one form of initiation, astral or physical, almost always precedes or occurs simultaneously with the other form. Both are important. Any discussion of initiation into the G:.D:. tradition must include a description of the various grades or levels of initiation. The grades of the Golden Dawn correspond to the Sephiroth on the Qabalistic Tree of Life. These grades are further divided into three separate groups known as the First, Second and Third Orders. The list of the grades (from lowest to highest) is as follows: Grade Neophyte 0 0=0° Zelator 1 0=10° Theoricus2 0=9° Practicus 3 0=8° Philosophus 4 0=7° Adeptus Minor 5 0=6° Adeptus Major 6 0=5° Adeptus Exemptus 7 0=4° Magister Templi 8 0=3° Magus 9 0=2° Ipsissimus 10 0=1° Corresponding Sephirah Malkuth Yesod Hod Netzach Tiphareth Geburah Chesed Binah Chokmah Kether Element Earth Air Water Fire"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Introduction xxiii The First Order consists of the grades from Neophyte through Philoso- phus. The grade of Neophyte is a probationary period which is not assigned a Sephirah on the Tree of Life. The grades from Zelator through Philosophus are known as the Elemental grades and are each attributed to one of the four Elements (Fire, Water, Air, Earth). Advancement through the grades of the First or Outer Order is designed to convey to the student an understanding of the four Elemen- tal principles of nature. But, more importantly, the student must learn to realize and balance these four Elements as indispensable ingredients of his/her own psy- chological and spiritual make-up. We once read a criticism of the Golden Dawn by an author who claimed that the G:. D:. taught its members to try to control the Elements in the outer world rather than controlling the Elements within. He couldn't have been more wrong. Equilibrating the Elemental components within is the primary goal of the Outer grades. The key objective of the First Order could be summed up in the phrase \"learn to balance.\" The Portal grade is another probationary period between the First and Sec- ond Orders. During this initiation, the candidate is introduced to the fifth and final Element of Spirit, thus completing the component parts of his/her Elemental con- stitution. The Portal is the final initiation ceremony that we will present in this book. Although Israel Regardie suggested that the Outer Order ceremonies could be converted over into self-initiation rituals, he was convinced that to do so with the Adeptus Minor Ceremony was impossible. (See The Complete Golden Dawn Sys- temof Magic, page 10.) Initiation into the Second Order grades (starting with Adep- tus Minor) still requires an authentic initiator and a physical Vault of the Adepti. However we agree with Regardie in his belief that continued and persistent repeti- tion of the Opening by Watchtower Ceremony over a long period of time can result in the acceptance of the performer as an Adept in the astral realms. The various grades of the Order also correspond (in a general way) to the various stages of an initiate's life.The Outer Order grades fittingly correspond to the aspirant in his/her twenties. The minimum ideal age for Adeptus Minor would be around twenty-five to thirty, because a distinctive change of consciousness occurs when full adulthood is entered. It is difficult to conceive of a twenty-year-old Adept, unless the person is absolutely extraordinary, because at that age the student has simply not lived long enough to have gained the practical experiences of life. The grade of Adeptus Major would be most appropriate for someone from the age of forty to fifty, mature enough to have acquired some of life's scars-an experienced leader, warrior, and magician. Adeptus Exemptus is the highest grade of the Order and is to be ideally conferred upon someone who exemplifies the old and wise mas- ter magician-a person who has perfected his/her magical workings in this life- time,? Keep in mind that these ages are given as suggested archetypal ages. They are not necessarily the actual ages of initiates in those specific grades. 9 In the Golden Dawn, the Adeptus Minor grade was divided into the sub-grades of Neophyte Adep- tus Minor, Zelator Adeptus Minor, Theoricus Adeptus Minor, Practicus Adeptus Minor, and Philoso- phus Adeptus Minor. The curriculum for these grades was extensive and required a minimum of six years to complete. (To say nothing of the time required in the grade of 6°=5 0 !) The Stella Matutina simplified the curriculum so that the studies for the higher grades of Adeptus Major and Adeptus"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xxiv SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRADmON The Third Order consists of the grades from Magister Templi to Ipsis- simus. These grades are not attained by living initiates; therefore we need not dis- cuss them here. The effectiveness of an initiation ceremony depends almost entirely upon the initiator. This is no less true of the self-initiator. In a fully operating temple of the Golden Dawn, an initiating Hierophant is required to have attained the grade of Zelator Adeptus Minor. To have reached that point, s/he will have undergone an extensive period of training in the grade of Neophyte Adeptus Minor and will have passed a series of examinations, written, oral, and practical. The power to confer a successful initiation comes from either having had it awakened internally by another proficient initiator or, in the case of self-initiation, by undertaking a great deal of magical and meditative work The goal of initiation is to bring about the illumination of the human soul by the Inner and Divine Light. A true \"initiate\" is an individual whose Higher Self (or Higher Genius) has merged with the Lower Personality and actually incar- nated into the physical body. The Personality is left in charge of the day-to-day routines of living and working, but the Higher Genius is free to look out at the world through the eyes of the initiate. Through this experience, the individual is given a permanent extension of consciousness which is impossible to mistake. Many times a student of the mysteries is drawn to a particular mystical current without knowing it. A series of \"coincidences\" and synchronicities will often direct (or sometimes shove) a person toward that current through books or through meeting other people who also have a connection with the current. Dur- ing this time, the student's psychic faculties are still relatively undeveloped, yet the inner spark has been ignited. However, a full initiation, or dawning of the Inner Light, is evident when the entire aura is illuminated. The Higher Self, also called the Augoides or Body ·of Light, comes into manifestation in the material body when true initiation occurs. But a great deal of preparation is necessary prior to this. Before it is possible for the Higher Genius to manifest in the consciousness, the Lower Personality must be tuned to the same wavelength as that of the Inner Self. The Genius carries out its existence in the higher spiritual realms in the same manner that the Lower Personality carries out its functions in the secular world. The desire of the Higher Self is to maintain equilibrium with the Light Divine, while the ambition of the Lower Self is to maintain an alignment with the mundane world. In order for a spiritual initiation Exemptus were actually based upon the work previously undertaken in the sub-grades of Adeptus Minor. By re-designing the curriculum, the magicians of the Stella Matutina were able to claim ever higher grades with ever less justification. Although Regardie preferred the later format, we feel that the original curriculum is the better one. It is less subject to ego exploitation and better aligned to the archetypal energies which correspond to those grades. (It is amusing to consider that since Regardie's death a few years previ- ous to the writing of this book, a plethora of individuals claiming the lofty degree of 70=4 0 (and even 8 0=3 0 have suddenly appeared in this country. If these individuals have not merely given themselves honorary degrees then surely, they have discovered H.G. Wells' Time Machine!)"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Introduction xxv to take place, the Lower Personality must be reoriented and realigned with the aspirations of the Higher Self. This requires a total shift in outlook and a single- minded devotion for the Divine Union. It also requires self-sacrifice on the part of the Lower Personality-the part of the psyche which is ruled by the principles of \"me first\" and \"I want.\" To the average secular person, sacrificing the needs of the Lower Personality seems foolish, but the submission of the Lower to the Higher Divine Self truly results in the attainment of something which is far more satisfying and durable than momentary wants and desires. The act of initiation is of prime importance to spiritual growth and personal evolution. As the Personality is gradually taught through magical studies, and moved into an alignment with the Higher Self through purification and ritual work, the Divine Light begins to permeate the aura (the sphere of sensation) of the individual. The seed that an initiation plants within the soul of the magician is a perpetual one that will remain intact throughout many different incarnations, growing stronger as the person rediscovers his/her psychic abilities with each new life cycle. None of this mystical knowledge is ever lost when an initiate undergoes physical death; it is recovered at the appropriate time in the next incarnation, and the process of mystical growth continues from the point where it left off. Spiritual evolution can take many life cycles to fully complete. The ultimate goal of an initi- ate undergoing this progression lifetime after lifetime is total and perfect union with the Divine Self, which frees him/her from the karmic wheel and the need to incarnate further into a physical body. At this pinnacle of spiritual attainment, the initiate has the choice of remaining in the glory of the Godhead or returning to physical form in order to teach and help other initiates who are \"less evolved.\" Spiritual growth is an essential step in human evolution. In the not-so-dis- tant past, animal species that failed to evolve in order to meet the challenges of a changing environment died out. Humanity, too, needs to evolve in order to con- front the difficult challenges of a world which is experiencing great ecological threats, a skyrocketing population explosion, and rampant violence committed against human beings in the name of race, religion, and resources. As the primary cause of all these problems, it is humanity's obligation to evolve spiritually and wisely, in order to correct them. If we as a species fail to evolve in this fashion, then we truly run the risk of extinction. Failure to achieve an initiation on whatever level in any given spiritual path or current is usually due to the unwillingness of the individual to sacrifice the petty needs and wants of the Lower Personality for that which is Higher. The Personal- ity and its attendant mental archetypes are quite comfortable in the mundane world and will often put up a fight when threatened with change-intensifying their needs and desires in order to distract the initiate from the spiritual path. The Higher Powers who keep guard over certain magical currents can also place obsta- cles (both mental and physical) directly in the path of the student, not merely to discourage, but to test the mettle of the would-be initiate. (In a materialistic society, the pocketbook of the student is a favorite target of these guardians.) Those stu- dents who quickly crumble under the weight of such deterrents will inevitably fail, while those who bear the burden with tenacity and fortitude will triumph in the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"xxvi SELF-INITIATION IN'IO 1HE GoLDEN DAWN TRAomON end. Indolence can playa role here as well, for the work of an initiate is not easy and requires much dedication and perseverance. In deciding to write this book, we were faced with certain problems. How does a person initiate him/her self into a current of magic that calls for a complex ceremony performed by a team of competent initiators? How does someone who is not yet a Neophyte satisfactorily perform a ritual that is traditionally executed only by someone who holds the rank of Adept? It seemed like a Catch-22-an impossible scenario. Our solution was to supply the barebones of the rituals and provide step-by-step instruction in the necessary visualizations as they occur in the ceremonies. We revised the rituals so that they could be performed by a soli- tary individual. We also expanded and emphasized the role of the godform of Thme (Meet or Maat) as the Introducer and Mediator between the candidate and the other energies present during the initiation. It seemed only natural that the aspiring student who is working alone and unaided should call upon the recon- ciling attributions of Thme to assist in his/her climb up the mountain of initiation. All advanced ritual gestures and techniques are carried out by the student only under the authority and dispensation of the Higher Self, not under the lower will or ego of the student. This is true of every initiation ceremony presented in this book, from Neophyte through the Portal grade; all of them are based upon this premise in order to circumvent, as much as possible, any tendency for ego-infla- tion (a primary scourge of many an unvigilant magician). Prior to any self-initia- tion, a dialogue must be established between the student and the godform of Thme in order to set up a conscious link between the candidate (as the Lower Per- sonality) and the goddess of Truth (as the Higher Self). Aseries of meditations for establishing this communication is given at the end of this introduction. In designing these rituals we have tried as much as possible to give the student an initiatory experience that is as complete and fulfilling as any bestowed by an initiating team. We have chosen to retain certain long speeches in the Ele- mental grade ceremonies, due to the fact that reading them aloud insures that the student will focus on them and not simply skim over them. One of the things that Israel Regardie was adamant about was that the occult student should seek out a course of psychotherapy as a safeguard against inflation of the ego and other problems that might possibly crop up as a result of the increased activation of the psyche through magical training. We also hold this view, but have found that it is not always possible for students to find a good ther- apist who is sympathetic to the magical arts. The solitary student is particularly at a disadvantage here, not having a group of temple-mates to consult if problems arise. Therefore we have liberally selected several good psychology books for sug- gested reading in each grade of this course . • We have already stated that magic is a spiritual science. The curriculum of the Golden Dawn represents, if you will, the academic program of one of the mostly highly acclaimed universities of that science. By the time a student reaches the end of the Portal grade in this course, s/he will have committed to memory the basics of Qabalah, Astrology, and spiritual Alchemy. The student will also know how to construct a natal or horary Astrology chart, perform divination by"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Introduction xxvii Geomancy and Tarot, and understand the fundamental techniques of ritual, including vibration, visualization, skrying, and assumption of godforms. Regardie's The Golden Dawn, although an excellent source book which con- tains much of the Order's teachings, is often too complex and overpowering for beginning students. All of the Golden Dawn's traditional Knowledge Lectures for the First Order are given here; expanded upon in a format designed to increase the student's comprehension of them. The Knowledge Lectures are not to be merely dismissed offhand as dry intellectual information. Study work is the foundation of the Hermetic science of magic. Just as a surgeon cannot be expected to perform an operation without having committed to memory the rudiments of medical knowledge, so too the magician cannot expect to perform an effective ceremony without understanding the fundamentals of magic. In this book, we have also incorporated much basic Astrological and Alchemical information in the Knowl- edge Lectures that is unavailable in Regardie's The Golden Dawn. In actual Golden Dawn temples, examinations are given to initiates before they can advance to the next grade. Here we have provided quizzes on the Knowledge Lectures and other materials, so that the student can test him/her self at a convenient pace. In addi- tion, extensive ritual and meditative work is provided for each grade. In Chapter One the reader will find a ritual detailing self-initiation into the grade of Neophyte in addition to gradework and examinations suitable to the 0 0=0°. Chapters Two, Three, Four and Five cover the Elemental grades from Zela- tor through Philosophus. Chapter Six focuses on ritual and study work for the Portal grade, the apex of this course. We suggest that the student who elects to assume the route of self-initia- tion first read the material at the beginning of the chapter appropriate to the grade about to be entered. Then the performance of the initiation ceremony can be undertaken. This ritual may be performed more than one time, since proficiency will increase with practice, and proficiency is, after all, what will determine the effectiveness of the initiation. After that, the Knowledge Lectures must be put to memory. A certain amount of time must be spent in each grade in order to absorb both the written knowledge as well as the initiation. This is especially important for the solitary student, who, without the support of an official temple and the help of peers, may have a tendency to rush through all of the work presented here in a ridiculously short period of time. Any reader thus disposed must remember that the process of spiritual growth is not a race, and it cannot be accomplished in a matter of weeks or months, but rather in terms of years and lifetimes. Keep in mind the old axiom of Solvitur Ambulando-solve your problems as you proceed. One does not have to rush through in order to prove one's intelligence or spiritual prowess. Because of this tendency to hurry through the grades, we recommend that solitary students in particular spend sufficient time in the various grades in order to fully assimilate the effects of each initiation. We suggest that the student of this course spend approximately four months as a probationer prior to any attempt at self-initiation into the Neophyte grade. The student should take this time to prepare for initiation by practicing the meditations and exercises given at the end of this introduction. Six months should be spent in the grade of Neophyte,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"xxviii SELF-IN1TIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRADITION and six months in each of the grades from Zelator through Practicus. Seven months should be spent in the Philosophus grade, while the duration of the Por- tal grade should be nine to twelve months. Ceremonial work provided in each grade is to be performed daily (though sometimes weekly depending upon the rit- ual). Finally the student can test his/her knowledge with the quizzes provided. Although the main focus of this book is on the solitary practitioner, there is no reason why two people cannot undertake the same course of study and progress together. It is certainly easier for two people to study the Knowledge Lec- ture material and quiz each other. However, each person must spend the proba- tionary period separately while establishing his/her own dialogue with the god- form of Thme, The initiation ceremonies presented here may be performed together so long as each person takes part in the visualizations and ritual gestures. The longer speeches may be divided between the two participants. Another tech- nique which may prove helpful to one or two people undertaking this route is to pre-record some of the longer speeches and guided visualizations presented for later playback in the rituals. Hearing one's own voice speaking the words of the gods can have a powerful initiatory effect. There is also no valid reason why students who may already belong to a Golden Dawn temple should not perform these self-initiatory rituals, for perfor- mance of them can only serve to increase the student's knowledge and profi- ciency. The Knowledge Lectures and meditations given here can also be used to supplement any student's existing gradework. If the student perseveres through this study course and the rituals furnished here for self-attainment, we have no doubt that the result will be the birth of an initi- ate of the Golden Dawn tradition of magic. It is our sincerest hope that, through this book, individuals who previously have had no opportunity to do so may initiate themselves into the Western Mystery Tradition.e Preliminary Meditative Work Daily Awareness Exercises: Darkness Technique: Before the commencement of any meditation, breathe deeply and rhythmically. Cover your eyes with the palms of your hands; overlapping the fingers of one hand with the other. You should experience total darkness. Sense Awareness Techniques: For the duration of a week, take a daily walk and make a mental note of everything you see, not focusing on anything in par- ticular. Do not attempt to analyze or make judgments; merely observe. Keep a journal of your observations. For the following week, take a daily walk and stop, deliberately focusing in on one particular object. Take note of everything concerning this object. On the following week of daily walking, try to look for a single color each day. On Sunday look for orange; Monday-blue, Tuesday- red, Wednesday- yellow, Thursday-violet, Friday-green, Saturday-blue-violet (indigo)."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Introduction xxix For one week concentrate on the various sounds that are heard on the daily walk.

For one week, take note of different tactile or touch sensations that you encounter during the course of a day.

For one week, take note of every smell that you encounter. Stop at certain times and close your eyes, so that the faculty of sight does not interfere with your sense of smell. For the following week, focus on one particular smell.e Exercise: It is vitally important that in the quest to exalt the health of the Spirit, the student does not neglect the health of the body. Physical well-being and endurance are essen- tial to the magician who wishes to perform lengthy rituals as well as Astral work. During this probationary period, the student should begin a regular discipline of exercise to maintain physical fitness. We leave the choice of exercise to the individual student; swimming, biking, jogging, martial arts, aerobics, yoga or some other. Israel Regardie recommended that the student perform certain exercises that are designed to raise both the physical and psychic vitality of the practitioner. They are taken from a small pamphlet by Peter Kelder called The Five Rites of Rejuvenation or The Eye of Revelation. These exercises can also be found in Donald Michael Kraig's book Modern Mngick (pages 222-229). Whatever form of exercise is undertaken, the student should never over- work to the point of strain. If one is not used to exercise, begin slowly and gradu- ally. If health concerns are an issue, consult a doctor before commencing any form of physical exertion.e Visualization Exercise: Spend a few moments of each day in this exercise. Begin with the eyes closed and relax, breathing deeply and rhythmically. Then open your eyes and gaze into the palm of your left hand. Imagine a small yellow lump of a non-sticking substance formulating in your hand. It is somewhat clay-like and elastic in consistency. Cup your right hand over the other and press this yellow substance as if you were mak- ing a hamburger patty. Then begin to roll the substance between your hands as if you were making a meatball. When the image of the yellow ball of astral substance is very clear within your mind, place it somewhere near you. Repeat this technique three more times, forming next a red ball, a blue ball and finally a black ball."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"xxx SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN l'RADmoN When finished, place all four balls in a row. Visualize them strongly. Then concentrate on dissolving the balls one by one, starting with the black ball, fol- lowed by blue, red and finally yellow. See the area where the balls were-placed as totally dear of the astral substance.e An Introduction to the Godfonn of Thme ~ The next series of meditations is designed to open a working dialogue between the aspiring student and the archetypal part of the candidate's mind symbolized by the godform of Thme (pronouncedJah-may}. The Greek form of this deity is Themis, and in the Egyptian Pantheon, she is Meet or Maat. This godform will act as the can- didate's introducer and guide throughout all of his/her initiatory experiences in this course. Here Thme acts as a portion of the candidate's own Higher Self, which con- ducts him/her along the initiatory path toward the eventual goal of full conversa- tion with the Holy Guardian Angel. It is important that the aspirant establish a firm link of communication with Thme before the act of self-initiation. We suggest that the student perform these meditations daily for a period of four months prior to self-initiation into the Neophyte grade. Meditation 1 is recommended for the first month, Mediation 2 is suggested for the second month, and Meditation 3 is to be performed during the remaining two months before initiation.lraftei161n' months the student still does not feel in touch with the godform, the entire series of medita- tions should be repeated for three additional months prior to self-initiation. We should stress that at this early stage of development, the student is not asked to assume the godform of Thme or any other godform. Assumption of god- forms is not taught until much later in this course. The aspirant needs to concen- trate instead on visualizing and becoming comfortable with the godform. A one- on-one dialog with the godform is encouraged but do not attempt to let the god- form control your words or actions. (If the godform makes demands, asks you do something against your will, or simply gives you information which you know to be false, then you probably are not in dialogue with Thme or your Higher Self- you are more than likely in touch with some lesser archetype that is playing games with you. In that case, banish the figure and start over.)¢ Vibration: Certain names or Words of Power when properly vibrated or intoned attract certain energies which are associated with them. A technique known as the Vibratory For- mula is a method by which divine names and words are spoken forcefully and; with authority in a \"vibration.\" ! The student should first imagine a glowing white Light above the head, and then visualize this Light descending to the level of the heart. The letters of the name to be vibrated should be imagined in white within the heart center. Then the name is slowly pronounced so that the sound vibrates throughout the chest cavity and is"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Introduction xxxi felt throughout the entire body. The student should imagine that the sound reaches into every comer of the universe. The Vibratory Formula of pronouncing names normally produces a slight sense of fatigue combined with exhilaration if performed correctly. (Note: only Divine or Angelic names are to be vibrated in this fashion.jc First Month-Meditation 1: Themis Take a ritual bath and perform a ritual of relaxation. Be seated comfortably in your temple space, bedroom or any other area where quiet and solitude may be main- tained. Light a yellow candle in the center of your temple space.

Perform the Adoration to the Lord of the Universe. (See Chapter One, page 85.) Then give four knocks. Close your eyes and imagine yourself sitting in a violet ovoid shape.

When you are ready, perform the Adoration to the Lord of the Universe, followed by the Battery of four knocks and the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. I) Bringing Down the Light In all Golden Dawn ceremonies, the initiating Hierophant, acting as a living \"channel\" brings the Supernal Light down into the temple through a complex for- mula. The student of this course, acting as his/her own initiator, must use a greatly simplified method of bringing the Divine Light into the temple. A tech- nique for accomplishing this is presented here. This exercise should be practiced for at least three months prior to self-initiation into the grade of Neophyte. After taking a ritual bath, sit quietly for a few moments of meditation, fac- ing the Eastern part of your temple space. When you feel ready, stand and place 10 Please note that this ritual, as well as the initiation rites in the following chapters, contains pas- sages which are set in a sans serif typeface, to indicate speeches that are \"spoken\" astrally by the godforms-not physically by the magician-and are \"heard\" internally."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"xxxvi SELP-INrI1ATION INTO TIlE GoLDEN DAWN 'fRADmoN both of your hands over your heart center, one hand crossing the other. VISualize a great brilliant Light which occupies a space that is both above you and beyond you in the East. As you contemplate this Light, visualize the figure of a white tri- angle traced in the brilliance before you. The white of the triangle shimmers and pulses iridescently. When the vision is very strong, bring your right hand straight out in front of you and your left hand just in front of your heart area, palm outward. With your right hand, trace a large spiral in the air in front of you (begin at the outer left-hand edge of the spiral and go clockwise). Bring the spiral slowly in toward you as you trace it. When your right hand reaches your left hand, join both hands together with the fingers interlocking and turn them so that the knuckles of your hand touch your heart area, and the palms face outward. This is the Sign of the Spiraling Light. (please note that this is not a traditional grade Sign of the Golden Dawn, but one that we have provided for the purpose of this course.) As you perform this, visualize the Divine Light spiraling in a funnel shape toward you. Say the words, \"Let the white brilliance of the Divine Spirit descend!\" As you do so, feel a flood of the Divine Light course through your entire body-from your head to your feet. The Light then centers itself at your heart area. Be aware of the connection that exists between your body and the universal Light. Equilibrate this Light through your body by performing the Qabalistic Cross. Then say the words, \"Khabs Am Pekht, Konx Om Pax, Light in Extension.\" Make three complete clockwise circuits around the boundaries of your temple space, all the while envisioning that you are carrying the Divine Light around the temple in a spiral of energy from the area of your heart. After completing the third circumambulation, return to the East and face West. Imagine the white triangle of Light firmly established in the center of your temple space. See it vividly. f / I {\\ \"I I I I I r I I I \\' \\ \\f '1_, \\ , .... _' \\ ,'-' ,,, TheSign of the Spiraling Light"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Introduction xxxvii Continue meditating for as long as you like, but when you are finished, make three counter-elockwise circumambulations of the temple all the while envisioning the white triangle in the center of the room disintegrating. Imagine the Divine Light from the triangle flowing back through your heart center and up into the greater tri- angle of Light above you. At the end of the circumambulation, turn again toward the East and, with your hands interlocked over your heart, begin the Reverse Spiral of Light, which is simply the total reversal of the Sign of the Spiraling Light. Pause and perform again the Qabalistic Cross for equilibration. This ends the rite. It is important to record all your meditations and ritual workings in every grade in order to have a tangible yardstick by which to measure your spiritual growth. It is equally important to record your perceptions of all your experiences within the grades, so that you may return to them time and time again for exami- nation. In this course of study, as in many other aspects of life, you are the only one gauging your own progress. In closing, there will always be some individuals who will simply read this book and fail to follow either the necessary workload or the minimal amounts of time suggested in each grade. Within a couple of months of having purchased this book, some will claim to have \"done it all\" and self-proclaim themselves as Adepts of this course. However, it will be far easier for such people to mislead and impress beginners than it will be for them to hoodwink those aspirants who truly undertake this work. It will be especially difficult for these individuals to fool their own Higher Selves. The Holy Guardian Angel will be able to tell the differ- ence between bravado and true aspiration. You have no one to blame but yourself if you fail to press onwards. But like- wise, if you succeed, you have yourself to thank.

The Neophyte grade is called the 0 0 = 00 grade because it is not attributed to any of the Sephiroth on the Tree of Life. This ceremony is a preliminary rite which contains all the fundamental magical formulae and techniques of the Order. It is based almost entirely around the idea of the Divine Light and the spiritual magnetism which draws that Light into the temple to be implanted in the aspirant's sphere of sensation. The word Neophyte comes from the Greek word neophytos or \"newly planted.\" In a traditional Neophyte Ceremony with a full initiating team, the Hiero- phant, the main officer of the ritual, acts on behalf of the Divine Self of human- ity-the supreme spiritual Soul. As the physical embodiment of the godform of Ousiri (Osiris), he is stationed in the East, the place of the dawning sun and the symbolic direction of the Supernal Light of Kether. It is through Ousiri, repre- sented by the Hierophant, that the Light is brought into the temple. The Hegemon, who is the personification of the godform of Thme, sym- bolizes the higher part of the candidate's mind-the highest part of the Ruach or reasoning mind working in combination with the Neshamah, the Divine Soul. The Keryxn represents the lower part of the Ruach functioning in obedience to the Will. The Hiereus is the active will of humanity, the guardian against evil. The Hegemon is the aspiring, compassionate and intuitive consciousness which seeks to bring about the Rise of the Light. (It is for this reason we have elaborated the role of godform of the Hegemon, Thme, in the initiation rituals presented here.) The primary objective of the student who wishes to initiate him/her self into the grade of Neophyte is twofold. First the Divine Light must be brought into the temple. Second, through a magnetic charge, this Light must be attracted to and implanted within the psyche of the aspirant. What must be remembered here is that the Higher Self rarely leaves its lofty abode, except when the Lower Self intentionally opens up to the Higher by an act of genuine aspiration or self-sacri- fice. This action alone makes the descent of the Light into mind, heart and soul possible. Therefore the self-initiated must ever strive steadfastly in the utmost 11 The old-fashioned spelling of this word was kerux, which transliterated the Greek letter upsilon as a \"u.\" However this same letter is also transliterated as a \"v' in such words as \"mystery\" and \"sym- pathy,\" which are both of Greek origin. 3"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"4 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN 'I'RAmtD-l desire for the Light. This spiritual energy can be magnetically attracted to the can- didate through the disciplines of rhythmic breathing, vibration, sincere aspiration, prayer and many other methods. All of the various symbols and movements in the Neophyte Ceremony are designed to enhance and reiterate the purpose of the ritual-the quest for the Light. Not all of the intricate symbolism is fully comprehended by the candidate, but that makes little difference in the long run, because the inherent value of such symbol- ism is that it has an auto-suggestive effect on the aspirant which is perceived at a deep subconscious level. The objective of the Neophyte Ceremony as a whole is the purification of the personality. Purification and Consecration of both the temple and the candidate (who is the living temple) are a source of constant focus throughout the ritual. The Ele- ments of Water and Fire are employed to this end until at length the aspirant is placed between the two Pillars of Light and Dark, in the position of Equilibrium, where a bond is formed between the Personality and the Higher and Divine Genius. The ceremony of the 0 0 = 0 0 symbolically occurs in the Hall of Judgment which is described in the 125th chapter of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. This depicts the \"Weighing of the Soul\" in which the deceased (who represents the Ini- tiate) is brought into the Hall of Truth by Anubis, the god of the Underworld. After having undergone extensive interrogation and purification, the initiate makes the long negative confession and is asked to explain the complex symbol- ism of the Hall. The Soul of the initiate then watches the weighing of its actions on Earth against the feather of Truth in the mystical scales of Maat. The ibis-headed god Thoth records the judgment as a devouring beast stands ready to seize the soul if the initiate has led an unworthy life. When this ordeal has passed, Horus introduces the initiate to the god, Osiris, who sits enthroned within his shrine. Before him is a lotus flower, the emblem of metamorphosis. The deceased is then united with Osiris the Redeemer in an infinite Light. Thus the entire story of the Weighing of the Soul can be said to represent the advance and purification of the initiate in the Neophyte Hall. Although many people respect the Neophyte Ceremony as a vital and sub- lime ritual replete with essential magical techniques, oftentimes these same indi- viduals do not respect the Neophyte grade. No sooner do they become Neophytes and take that all-important first step into the current of the Golden Dawn than they wish to rush headlong into the 1 0 =10 0 grade of Zelator, as if the rank of Neophyte were somehow undesirable or demeaning compared to higher grades. We cannot overstate how foolish this supposition is. Advancement into the higher grades should not be likened to a race. It is a life-long commitment to complete the Great Work. A certain amount of time must be spent in each grade to thoroughly ingest and balance out the effects of initiation. Advancing through the grades too quickly is apt to result in imbalance and egotism. In the Western Mystery Tradition we are all Neophytes no matter what our outer rank might be. All of us have much to learn on the quest for spiritual growth. A suitable amount of time spent in the Neophyte grade (through self-initiation) should be approximately six to twelve months."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Neophyte Grade 5 The aspirant will also need to choose a magical motto. A motto is usually a phrase that is descriptive of the magician's spiritual goal. It is rendered in Latin, Hebrew, or any language other than the aspirant's everyday speech, in order to set the magical name apart from secular life. In the initiation ceremonies of the Golden Dawn, various participants known as officers assume certain godforms (i.e., take on the astral appearance and qualities of a god or goddess) who carry out specific duties in the ritual. True god- form assumption should not be attempted by anyone who is not yet an Adept.P In a self-initiation rite these various godforms are built up in the imagination of the candidate where they represent different parts of the aspirant's psyche. These godforms are therefore microcosmic reflections of specific macrocosmic god- forces to which they are linked. They are each called upon and orchestrated by the candidate's own Higher Self through the desire for the Light. The solitary aspirant does not actually assume the godforms created in the temple, but instead acts upon their behalf by taking on the various offices in the temple under the watch- ful guidance of the god-forces. An officer-form, so to speak, is a lesser extension of a godform which serves to carry out specific functions within the temple. It is the cfficer-forms, not the godforms themselves, that are assumed by the solitary aspi- rant of this course. When the officer-forms are not being assumed by the candi- date, they are returned to the full authority of their respective godforms. The combined activities in the ritual, especially the activities of the various godforms and officer-forms, symbolize the component parts of the candidate's own mind, which work together to effect initiation. However, preparation must be done prior to self-initiation into the Neophyte grade. It is very important for the student to have previously opened up a channel of dialogue with Thme by prac- ticing the exercises given in the introduction. We suggest that the aspirant study the section here entitled \"The Godforms of the Visible Stations\" and the diagrams of the temple provided for this rite. The reader is also advised to commit to mem- ory the section of this chapter which describes the primary offices of the Neophyte grade and their officer-forms. All information required for the rise and circulation of the Light in the ritual, as well as the necessary visualizations, will be explained step-by-step in the ceremony given here. The following manuscript describes the appearance of the various godforms of the Neophyte Hall, especially in terms of color. The colors of the Three Chiefs reflect their corresponding Sephiroth: Chesed, Geburah, and Tiphareth. The colors of these three officials are seen to \"flash\" with their respective vibratory energy.13 Their high placement on the Tree of Life indicates the importance of these officers in guid- ing the current of magic from its source (the Supernal Triad) into the temple. The remaining officers who do not occupy a seat on the Dais are each assigned two visible forms, the initial form and the advanced form. The initial forms 12 Students who take on godforms before they are ready to do so may endanger themselves through psychic imbalance and deception. 13 \"Flashing Colors\" are complimentary colors that are located directly opposite each other on a standard artist's color wheel. One of the two colors is active, the other passive. Two colors that \"flash\" are linked together with the same vibratory energy."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"6 SELF-INITIATION INlO mE GoLDEN DAWN TRADmON are appropriate for beginning students. The more advanced forms should not be envisioned until after the student has become proficient in the art of godform visualization. The throne of each godform is also ornamented with the flashing pair of colors that reflect that officer's particular Elemental or Sephirotic affinity. Each throne is considered a receptacle or dwelling place for the Divine Powers of the god. They are batteries of specific energy forces. The wands, swords and other implements associated with the various godforms in the Hall are also heavy with symbolic meaning. These items act to reinforce the respective potencies of the godforms.e The Godforms of the Visible Stations Copyright © 1991 Adam P. Forrest General Note The human portions of the godforms follow the coloring conventions of Egyptian iconography in that the skin tone of women is represented as a rich yellow-gold and that of men as a warm reddish-brown.> Above each of the godforms of the officers on the Dais may be envisioned a circled cross of white light (like the lamen of the Hierophant) symbolic of the Inner Order, and above each of the other godforms of officers in the Hall may be envisioned a cross and triangle of white light symbolic of the Outer Order. Above the godform of the Phylaxn in the Pronaos may be envisioned a triangle of white light (like the sash badge of the Neophyte) symbolic of the light extended into the Darkness of the outer and uninitiated world.

That paper, entitled ''The Egyptian Godforms of the Neophyte Grade\" was written by someone in the Stella Matutina, and was never a part of the original Z documents by Mathers. The colors it assigns to the officers are in reality colors that apply only to the godforms in the game of Enochian Chess, and not to the godforms of the Neophyte Hall. It lists, for example, the colors of Nephthys as being primarily black-the color of Earth. In Enochian Chess Nephthys represents the Element of Earth, but in the Neophyte Hall she represents the Sephirah of Geburah and her colors would correspond to that sphere-primarily red. The other godforms would also be colored in accordance with their roles in the Neophyte Hall; the Hegemon's godform would be primarily yel- low because of her role as the Reconciler. 15 The Sentinel of the old G:.

The student will also be required to visualize the various offi- cer-forms within the temple-these forms are not the same as the godforms, although they are lesser extensions of them. (The officer-form of the Hierophant would appear as just that-a human being dressed in the robes and insignia of a Hierophant. The same is true for all of the officer-forma) As stated earlier, it is the officer-forms who carry out specific functions within the temple, not the godforms themselves, that are assumed by the solitary initiate. When assuming an officer- form, the student inaugurates a separation of a particular godform and its corre- sponding officer-form. The two are clairvoyantly seen to be separated, although an etheric link between them remains. The officer-forms are returned to the dominion of their respective godforms when not in active use by the aspirant. When this is the case, the godform can be seen to absorb or overshadow the lesser form of the officer. To summarize, a large part of the initiation rites in this book are to be car- ried out on a physical level, with actual temple symbolism (banners, lamens, altar, wands, etc.), to be constructed by the student. The astral work performed in these rituals revolve entirely around visualization of godforms, officer-forms and cer- tain guided meditations.e THE NEOPHYTE CEREMONY Temple Set-up: The aspirant will need to set up the Hall beforehand in accordance with the temple diagram. The black cubical altar is to be placed in the center of the room. Upon it are the symbols of the cross and triangle (the red cross is above the white triangle). The pillars are to be placed just East of the altar. The Banners of the East and West are placed in their respective quarters. A cup of Water should be placed in the North, and a censer of incense belongs in the South. Around the circumference of the room are to be placed four candles: yel- low in the East, red in the South, blue in the West, black in the North. In the East- ernmost part of the temple should be placed a white candle. The aspirant should . try to obtain glass candle holders which have two parts: a bottom which holds a colored votive candle and a glass cover (colored or opaque) with a hole in the top> which acts to shade the candlelight. A lantern should be placed in the Southwest. The four Elements of the Mystic Repast are to be placed on top of the altar near their respective quarters: a rose in the East, a red candle in the South, a chalice of wine in the West, and a paten of bread and salt in the North. The aspirant will need to have constructed beforehand the Hierophant's Wand, the Hegemon's Wand, and the Keryx's Wand. A convenient sword should also be procured for the station of Hiereus. The aspi- rant will need a finished Neophyte sash placed in the East of the temple. Elemen- tal symbols may be placed in the four quarters.

A ritual bath is required, after which the aspirant may put on the black Tau robe and red sandals or slippers. Ablack cord is to be wrapped three times around the waist. The aspirant must then spend a period of time (10 to 20 minutes) in a darkened room or antechamber to the temple seated in quiet medi- ation while wearing a hoodwink or blindfold. During this period of time, dark- ness and silence are to be maintained. The aspirant should imagine him/her self under the watch of Anubis of the West. After this period of silence, the hoodwink may be folded under the black cord tied around the waist. The aspirant may then enter the temple and begin the ritual. As you enter the temple, imagine that you are leaving your physical body outside as a sentinel to guard the temple-your spiritual self is free to receive initiation.

The Hiereus drops out after one pass of the East, and the Hegemon drops out of the procession after two passes. You and the visualized forms of the others follow the Keryx in a third pass. All the astral officers return to their places. At this point, you replace the rose, red candle, cup of wine, and bread and salt to the top of the altar. Stand West of the altar. Again imagine the godform of Hoor peKhroti. Repeat the following: The threefold cord which was bound about my waist was an image of the threefold bondage of mortality, which amongst the initiated is called earthy or material inclination, that has bound into a narrow place the once far- wandering Soul; and the hoodwink wasan image of the Darkness, of igno- rance, of mortality that has blinded men and women to the happiness and beauty their eyes once looked upon. The Double Cubical Altar in the center of the Hall is an emblem of visible Nature or the Material Universe, concealing within herselfthe mysteries of all dimensions, while revealing her surface to the exterior senses. It is a double cube because, as the Emerald Tablet has said, \"The things that are below are a reflection of the things that are above.\" The world of men and women created to unhappiness is a reflection of the world of Divine Beings created to happiness. It is described in the Sepher Yetzirah or The Book of Formation, as \"An Abyss of Height\" and \"An Abyss of Depth,\" \"An Abyss of the East\" and \"An Abyss of the West,\" \"An Abyss of the North\" and\" An Abyss of the South.\" The Altar is black because, unlike Divine Beings who unfold in the Element of Light, the Fires of created Beings arise from Darkness and Obscurity. On theAltar is a white triangle to bethe image of that immortal Light, the Triune Light, which moved in Darkness and formed the world of Darkness and out of Darkness. There are two contending forces and one always uniting them. And these three have their image in the threefold flame of our Being and in the threefold waveof the sensual world. Stand in the form of the Tau Cross and say: \"Glory be to thee, Father of the undying. For Thy gloryflows out rejoicing, to the ends of the Earth!\" Put your arms down and continue the speech as before: The red cross above the white triangle, is an image of him who was unfolded in the Light.

A literal translation would be \"Light rushing out in one Ray,\" and they signify the same form of Light as that symbolized by thestaffof the Keryx. East of the Double Cubical Altar of created things are the Pillars of Hermes and of Solomon. On these are painted certain Hieroglyphics from the 17th and 125th chapters of the Book ofthe Dead. They are the symbols of thetwo powers of day and night, love and hate, work and rest, the subtle force of the lodestone and the eternal out-pouring and in-pouring ofthe Heart of God. The lamps thatbum, though with a veiled light, upon their summits show that the pathway to Hidden Knowledge, unlike the pathway of Nature- which is a continual undulation, the winding hither and thither of the Serpent-is the straight and narroui way between them. It was because of this that I stepped between the Pillars to receive the Light andto receive the fourth and final consecration. Two contending Forces and one which unites them eternally. Two basal angles of the triangle and one which forms the apex. Such is the origin ofCreation-it is the Triad of Life. The throne of the Hierophant at the gate of the East is the place of the Guardian of the Dawning Sun. The throne of the Hiereus at the gate of the West is the place of the Guardian against the multitudes that sleep through the Light and awaken at the twilight. The throne of the Hegemon seated between the columns is the place of Balanced Power, between the ultimate Light andthe ultimate Darkness. The wandof the Keryx is the beam of Light from the Hidden Wisdom, and his lamp is an emblem of the ever-burning lamp of the Guardian of the Mysteries. The seat of the Stolistes at the gate of the North is the place of the Guardian of the Cauldron and the well of Water-of cold and moisture.

I will hold all religions in reverence, for there is none but contains a ray from the ineffable Light which I seek. I will remember the penalty that awaits the breaker of the oath, and the mystery I have received, and that the secret of Wisdom can only be discerned from the place of Balanced Powers. I shall study well the Great Arcanum of the proper equilibrium of Severity and Mercy, for either unbalanced is not good. Unbalanced Severity is cruelty and oppression; unbalanced Mercy is but weakness and would permit Evil to exist unchecked, thus making itself, as it were, the accomplice of that Evil. I shall remember that things Divine are not attained by mortals who understand the body alone, for only those who are lightly armed can attain the summit. YHVH alone is our Light and the bestower of perfect Wisdom. No mortal power can do more than bring one to the pathway of that Wisdom, which he could if it so pleased him, put into the heart ofa child. For as the whole is greater than the part, so are we but sparks from the insupportable Light which is in the Godhead. The ends of the Earth are swept by the borders of his garment of Flame-from him all things proceed and unto him all things return. Therefore I invoke him. Therefore even the Banner of the East falls in adoration before him. Visualize Horus coming around to the East of the altar. You hold out your right hand to him.

The lecture is divided up into six sec- tions that make it easier for the reader to digest the knowledge. An examination for each section of the Knowledge Lecture is given at the end of this chapter. SECTION 1: The Elements @ A There ar e fo ur baSic ma giCal Elem en ts : Fire, w ater' Air , an d E arth . (The final unifying Element of Spirit will be discussed in another li V chapter.) These four primary Elements are regarded as realms, king- \"0 doms, or divisions of Nature. They are the basic modes of existence V and action-the building blocks of everything in the universe. All that exists or has the potential to exist contains one or more of the these energies. (These Elements are not to be confused with the scientist's table of elements, which are only the most materialized expressions of the Elements in the physical plane.) The four Elements of the ancients are assigned the dual combination of two of the four qualities of heat, cold, dryness, and moisture. They are: Qualities Name Symbol Heat and Dryness FIRE /:). Cold and Moisture WATER \\l Heat and Moisture AIR A Cold and Dryness EARTH V' The Element of Fire (Egyptian-Ash or Ish, Hebrew-Asch, Latin-Ignis, Greek-Pyr.) Qualities of Fire: active, masculine, spontaneous, quick, initiating, initializing, vitalizing, and energetic."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"42 SELF-INITIATION IN10 ras GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON The most physical expression of Fire is the visible, active phase of com- bustion manifesting in heat and light. The Element of Fire was seen by the Alchemists as an Element which operates at the center of all things, as well as the \"agent of transmutation\" because all things are derived from and return to Fire. This Element is seen as the great Supernal Father energy-the \"seed\" force of the universe. It is an Element with two purposes: (1) it is an expression of spiritual energy and the determination of the Spirit, (2) it purifies, bums, and destroys the old so that the new may emerge. Thus it is a symbol of transformation and regen- eration. There is a direct parallel between the concepts of Fire and Life. Fire is an image of energy found at the level of animal passions as well as on the plane of spiritual fortitude. Its action is quick and unpredictable. To pass through Fire is symbolic of transcending the human condition. The direction or cardinal point assigned to Fire is South. The Element of Water (Egyptian-Mu, Hebrew-Maim, Latin-Aqua, Greek-Hydor.) Qualities of Water: passive, feminine, receptive, sustaining, subconscious, creative, fluidic, and generative. In a mundane physical sense, water is a liquid compound of hydrogen and oxygen molecules. In an esoteric sense, the concept of Water implies all liquid materials. Furthermore, the primeval Waters, the image of all primal matter, con- tain all solid bodies before they obtain rigidity and form. The so-called \"fluid body\" of man is translated by modem psychology as a symbol of the unconscious or the archetypal feminine side of the personality. Water is seen as a symbol of the Maternal, the Great Mother, as well as the great unfathomable and mysterious well of Wisdom contained within the subconscious mind. In short, Water symbol- izes the infinite realm of possibilities, which precede all form and all creation. It is limitless and immortal-the Waters of Creation. Submersion in Water alludes to a return to the pre-formed state. Like the Element of Fire, Water also symbolizes the ideas of transfiguration and regeneration. The direction or cardinal point assigned to Water is West. The Element of Air (Egyptian-NeJ, Hebrew-Ruach, Latin-Aer, Greek-Aer.) Qualities of Air: active, masculine, intellectual, ethereal, abstract, and communicative. The physical expression of Air is that of a mixture of gases which forms the atmosphere of the Earth. Symbolically, Air is related to the creative breath of Life, and, therefore, speech. Light, flight, and weightlessness, as well as scent and smell are all related to the Element of Air. It is connected in many mythologies with the idea of creation and as a medium for movement and the emergence of life processes. Air is a volatile Element which is considered by the Qabalists to be the offspring of the Parental Elements of Fire and Water (thus creating steam). It is the Reconciler between the rival Elements of Fire (male) and Water (female)-balanc- ing and equilibrating these two parental opposites. Air also alludes to the human"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Neophyte Grade 43 intellect and thought processes, which are quick, changeable, and abstract. The direction or cardinal point assigned to Air is East. The Element of Earth (Egyptian-Ta, Hebrew-Aretz, Latin-Terra, Greek-Ge.) Qualities of Earth: passive, feminine, solid, materialization, physical, stable, slow-moving, and grounded. In a technical sense, earth is the dry land surface of the planet, made up of solid organic and inorganic particles. Allegorically it is much more than that. Earth represents the physical, materialized universe in which we live. It is the tan- gible world around us that we can touch and feel. Earth is the Daughter of Fire and Water, just as Air is the Son. This Element encompasses all activities of pro- ductivity, fertility, growth, and regeneration. Earth is the fourth and final Element and the result of the actions of the other three. The direction or cardinal point assigned to Earth is North.e SECTION 2: The Zodiac What is Astrology and why is it important? Astrology is a science that examines the action of celestial bodies upon all living beings, non-liv- ing objects, and earthly conditions, as well as their reactions to such influences. The study of the stars is in fact one of the oldest sciences known to humankind, tracing its origins back to ancient Sumer and even earlier. The Astrological arts were also well known to the Egyp- tians, Hindus, Chinese, Persians, and the great civilizations of the ancient Americas. Astrology is the progenitor of astronomy, and for many years the two existed as one science. Nowadays, astronomy is considered an \"objective\" science of distances, masses, speeds, etc., while Astrology is a \"subjective\" and intuitive science which not only deals with the astronomical delineation of horoscopes, but can also be called a philosophy which helps to explain the spiritual essence of life. There are in reality two branches of Astrology. The first is Exoteric Astrol- ogy which includes the mathematics of the art involved with charting a horoscope and the predictive arts. The second is Esoteric Astrology which deals with myster- ies of the universe itself, the spiritual, moral, intellectual and physical dynamics of the cosmos. Esoteric Astrology reveals the universal pattern of living and the means by which human beings can align themselves with the spiritual fabric and pattern of the universe. It is a system for understanding celestial energies and a method for viewing the universe as a symmetrical whole. Of great importance to the art of Astrology is the Zodiac. This is a circle or belt, which anciently was said to extend eight or nine degrees on each side of the ecliptic (the Sun's apparent path around the Earth, or the orbit of the Earth as viewed from the Sun.) The Zodiacal \"wheel\" is a flat chart which is divided into twelve houses, each of which is said to be ruled by one of the twelve Signs. The twelve Signs of the Zodiac are distributed among the four Triplicities (or sets of three Signs). Each of these triplicities is attributed to one of the four Ele- ments, and they represent the operation of the Elements in the Zodiac. The twelve"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"44 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN l'RAomoN Signs are also divided into three Quadruplicities (or groups of four Signs). Each of these Quadruplicities is attnbuted to one of the three qualities of Cardinal, Muta- ble, and Kerubic (Fixed). The Triplicities (grouped by Element) Fire Signs Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. Positive traits: fiery, impassioned, eager, spontaneous, independent, and enthusiastic. Negative traits: They can be too forceful, domineer- ing, and overbearing. Water Signs Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. Positive traits: intuitive, receptive, emotional, sensi- tive, compassionate, and complex. Negative traits: They can be moody, easily influ- enced, self-pitying, and wavering. Air Signs Libra, Aquarius, and Gemini. Positive traits: able to communicate well, intellectual, logical, open-minded, idealistic, and objective. Negative traits: They can be cold, insensitive, and impractical. Earth Signs Capricorn, Taurus, and VIrgo. Positive traits: stable, earthy, practical, dependable, conservative, and sensual. Negative traits: They can be dull, slow, possessive, and overly materialistic. The Quadruplicities (grouped by quality) Cardinal Signs Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn. These Signs are known as Cardinal because they rule the change of seasons: Aries-spring; Cancer-Summer; Libra-Fall; and Capricorn-Wmter. These Signs are also attributed to the four cardinal points of the compass: Aries-East; Cancer-North; Libra-West; and Capricorn-South. Positive qualities: Cardinal Signs are active, fervent, independent, enthusiastic, ambitious, and initiating. Mentally they are quick and insatiable. Negative qualities: They can be impetuous, domineering, thoughtless and without the ability to fol- low through with projects they have started. Kerubic Signs Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius, and Taurus. These Fixed Signs govern the middle month of each season. Unlike the Cardinal Signs which herald the transition between sea- sons, the Kerubic Signs are solidly established in the heart of each season. Positive qualities: These Signs are stable, determined, persevering, able to concentrate, and accumulative. Their goals are reached slowly but steadily. They are perceptive and have excellent memories. Negative qualities: They can be egotistical, obstinate and too firmly ingrained in their ways and opinions."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Neophyte Grade 45 Mutable Signs Sagittarius, Pisces, Gemini, and Virgo.

The Planets, like the Zodiacal Signs, each have a set of characteristics assigned to them. Each Planet is said to rule one or more of the Signs. The energy of a Planet is strong in the Sign(s) that it rules (the Sign of the Planet's dignity). In addition every Planet also has one Sign, aside from the one it rules, where it expresses itself in a compatible fashion (the Sign of the Planet's"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"50 SELF-INmATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN 'fRADmoN exaltation). When a Planet is in the Sign directly opposite to the one it rules, it is in the Sign of its detriment. Also, when a Planet is in the Sign opposite of its exalta- tion, it is in the Sign of its fall. Thus a Planet's dignity and its exaltation are har- monious with its energy, while its detriment and its fall are contrary to the Planet's energy. To get a better idea of the energies and associations of each Planet, the fol- lowing explanations are provided.\" » LUNA (The Moon) Rules: Cancer Exaltation: Taurus Detriment: Capricorn Fall: Scorpio Represents: domestic, nurturing urge Key word: EMOTIONS Luna is a Roman name identified with Diana, goddess of the Moon.

It rules orga- nization, discipline, responsibility, structure, goals, career opportunities, limitations, conservatism, crystallized focus, restrictions, delays, theories, orthodoxy, tradition, depth, time, patience, truth, wisdom, aging, and solidification. Saturn's action is slow and enduring. The Ancients also assigned certain Planetary values to the North and South Nodes of the Moon, that is, the points in celestial longitude where the Moon crosses over the ecliptic or path of the Sun. Luna's North Node is listed by its posi- tion in the ephemeris and the South Node is always its exact opposite, having the same number of degrees and minutes, but of the converse Sign. The Nodes of the Moon are called: CAPUT DRACONIS (The Head of the Dragon) North Node b6 CAUDA DRACONIS (The Tail of the Dragon) South Node '(J The North Node is a point of gain, increase and added self-assurance. The South Node is a point of release, decrease, and letting go. The Days of the week are attributed to and (in some cases) named after the seven ancient Planets and the gods who represented them.

These Planets, which are also referred to as the Transcendental Planets, do not enter into the ancient sevenfold scheme of the Heptad of the Planets, which is a vital aspect of the Golden Dawn system of magic. Because of this, the outer Planets will rarely be referred to elsewhere in this book. They are mentioned here because it is important that today's student have a thorough grounding in the basics of modern Astrology.

The Planet Uranus rules science, electricity, lightning, the stroke of genius, suddenness, magic, the occult, Astrology, x-rays, inventions, discoveries, originality, and psychology. It is intellectual, progressive, futuristic, humanitarian, egotistical, rebellious, eccentric, unorthodox, unconventional, and utopian. This Planet rules sudden change, indi- vidualism, independence, autonomy, and natural disasters. It is considered to be the upper octave of Mercury. Uranus's action is sudden, unforeseen, and usually violent. W NEPTUNE Rules: Pisces (with sub-ruler, Jupiter) Exaltation:-- Detriment: Virgo Fall:-- Represents: spiritual or escapist urge Key word: INTUITION The Planet Neptune is named for the Roman god of the Sea.

Many consider it to be the higher octave of Mars. Pluto's action is slow, ponderous and inescapable. Finally, we must refer to the Earth which is not usually portrayed along with the other Planets. This is because the Earth as a Planet never leaves our sphere of experience. It is terra firma-a constant that is always with each of us, here and now, under our feet (so long as modem man does not destroy her). It rep- resents the physical plane and mundane matters. In astrological terms the Earth is tentatively ruled by Taurus. Its Key word is Reality. In a horoscope, the Earth is always the exact opposite of the Sun by Sign, degree, and house placement. It alludes to the individual's mission in life.o Table of Essential Dignities Planet Dignity Detriment Exaltation Fall Saturn 'P,== §,<Q ~ Of Jupiter .0,* IT,ll) § \".P Mars Of, IlL ~,() 't)o § Sol 61. .....

What the word Qabalah encompasses is an entire body of ancient Hebrew mystical principles that are the cornerstone and focus of the Western Esoteric Tradition. Virtually all Western spiri- tual systems can trace their roots to the Qabalistic Tree of Life. The exact origins of the Qabalah are unclear, but it certainly contains some vestiges of Egyptian, Greek, and Chaldean influence. By its nature, mysticism is knowledge that cannot be communicated directly but may be expressed only through symbolism and metaphor. Like other esoteric systems, Qabalah also draws upon the mystic's awareness of the tran- scendence of the eternal deity. Another element of Qabalah is that it seeks to reveal the hidden mysteries of the Divine as well as the connection between the divine"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The Neophyte Grade 55 life on one hand and the life of humans on the other. The goal of the Qabalist is to discover and invent keys to the understanding of arcane symbols which reflect the eternal mysteries. Israel Regardie stated that, \"Qabalah is a trustworthy guide, leading to a comprehension of the universe and one's own self.\" It is all this and more. This \"Tradition\" was never restricted to instruction in the mystical path alone; it also includes ideas on the origins of the universe, of Angelic hierarchies, and the prac- tice of magic. Qabalah is the foundation upon which the art of Western magic rests. Magic has been defined by Aleister Crowley as \"the science and art of caus- ing change to occur in conformity with Will.\" To this Dion Fortune added' \"changes in consciousness.\" The Qabalah, which Dion Fortune called \"the Yoga of the West\" reveals the nature of certain physical and psychological phenomena. Once these are rightly understood, the student can use the principles of magic to exercise control over the conditions and circumstances of his/her life. Magic provides the practical applica- tion of the theories supplied by the Qabalah. The Qabalah as it exists today is a vibrant, living and dynamic philosophy which includes ideas on the origin of the entire Cosmos, the eternal mind of God, and the spiritual development of humankind. It is a precise mystical system that describes universal laws and shows us how to utilize spiritual principles in every- day life. By firmly fixing Qabalistic symbols such as the Tree of Life in one's mind, the aspirant has access to a balanced group of archetypes that the Inner Self can more easily relate to, thus making true spiritual growth more readily attainable. As the Hermetic student begins to contemplate and experience the energies of the Sephiroth (the ten emanations of the Qabalistic Tree of Life) s/he will find that they develop into genuine Forces that become animated within the psyche. These newly awakened Forces will initiate a process of reorganization in the mind of the student, gathering up disjointed elements of the Divine Powers which lay dor- mant in the average person. They begin to structure themselves in accordance with the Sephiroth, permitting the student to tap into a previously unknown source of Divine Inspiration which is kept alive and prolific through meditation and active ritual work. The Qabalah has often been called the \"Ladder of Lights\" because it not only depicts Cosmic generation, which is the descent of the Divine into the physical, but also defines how the individual may employ it for spiritual ascent by purifying both body and mind through ceremony, contemplation, and prayer, until at length one achieves that pristine state of consciousness that is nec- essary to attain union with the Higher Self, which is the emissary to the Divine Self represented by the first Sephirah of Kether. Some people who have a brief encounter with the Qabalah come away with the idea that it is a purely patriarchal or male-oriented philosophy simply because of its Hebrew origins. Nothing could be further from the truth. Take for example a word which is common throughout Qabalistic teachings, \"Elohim.\" This a word formed from a feminine noun, \"Eloah\" and a masculine plural \"im.\" You are left with a word that has both male and female characteristics which literally means\" gods\" -the creative principle formed from the perfect and equal union of"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"AIN The Tree of Life 56"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The Neophyte Grade 57 the divine male and the divine female principles. Read in this context, the Qabal- istic origins of the first five books of the Old Testament (the Pentateuch) give an entirely new meaning. The first sentence of Genesis, which in Hebrew begins as \"Berashith bara Elohim Aih-ha-Shamaim w'Ath ha-Aretz,\" can be interpreted as \"In the beginning, the gods (the united Male and Female aspects of the Divine) cre- ated the Heavens and the Earth.\" This idea of the equality of the divine male and divine female principles, although suppressed for centuries by male-dominated societies, is carefully hidden in Qabalistic doctrine, although at times it has slipped out unforeseen in almost all translations of the Pentateuch, such as in Gen- esis 1:26 and 1:27: \"And God went on to say let us make man in our image, accord- ing to our likeness,\" \"And God proceeded to create the man in his image, in God's image he created him; male and female he created them.\" Another example is the word Sephiroth, which is used to describe the ten emanations of the Divine. Here we have a feminine noun Sephirah being joined to a feminine plural \"oth.\" This again points to the importance of the feminine in Qabalah. The Sephiroth themselves are generally considered feminine because they structure and give form to the emanations of deity. Thus anyone who seri- ously studies the Qabalah for any length of time will see that it is a very balanced system for spiritual growth. The Qabalah is usually classified under four heads which overlap each other in some instances. They are: 1. THE DOGMATIC QABALAH-the study of ancient Qabalistic books such as the Written Torah also called the Pentateuch, the Zohar, the Bahir, and the Sepher Yetzirah. 2. THE PRACTICAL QABALAH-deals with the construction of talismans used in ceremonial magic. 3. THE LITERAL QABALAH-deals with Gematria; the relation- ships between numbers and the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, which yield many hidden meanings of Hebrew words and names. 4. THE UNWRITTEN QABALAH-refers to the correct knowl- edge of the sacred symbol known as the Tree of Life (Etz-ha- Chayim). This is the only branch of the Qabalah that the Neo- phyte of this course will need to study for now. We will not at this time describe the long history and evolution of the Qabalah as espoused and elucidated by various teachers and sources down through the ages. To do so would be to place an undue burden upon the Neo- phyte. However, for ambitious students who like to take on burdens, we highly recommend a book by Gershom Scholem called simply Kabbalah published by Dorset Press (New York). This book gives an excellent and detailed account of the various schools of Qabalistic thought."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Pillars 58 0) o o"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The Neophyte Grade 59 SECTION 5: The Sephiroth (@) The Hebrew Qabalists referred the highest and most abstract @ ideas to ten emanations of deity which are called the Sephiroth _ (sef-eer-oth), Singularly they are called Sephirah. When arranged .. in a certain manner, the ten Sephiroth and the twenty-two paths which connect them form the Tree of Life. Together, the Ten Sephi- roth and the Twenty-two Paths comprise what are called the Thirty-two Paths of Wisdom. The Tree of Life is the single most important symbol of the Qabalah. Just a glance at its diagram will reveal it to be a system of perfect mathematics, symmetry, and beauty. It is represented as ten circles or orbs known as the Sephiroth, which is said to mean \"Numbers,\" \"Spheres\" and \"Emanations.\"21 Some have seen the Sephiroth as divine powers or vessels. Others regard them as divine tools or instru- ments of the Eternal (although not separated from the Eternal like human tools are). All agree, however, that the Sephiroth express divine attributions or essences that are organized into an archetypal pattern which is the model for everything that has come into the manifest universe. The relationships implied in the Tree of Life under- score the whole of existence, and so the attributes of the Sephiroth may be found in any branch of knowledge. Although their basic definition confirms them as charac- teristics of the Divine, they can be described in terms of human experience because men and women are formed as stated before, in the image of the Divine. One essential aspect of the Sephiroth is that they are placed upon the Tree of Life in perfect juxtaposition, so that each Sephirah counterbalances one on the opposite side of the Tree. The ten Sephiroth emanate from the Three Negative Veils of Existence (various abstract stages of \"nothingness\") in succession as if \"one can- dle were lit from another without the Emanator being diminished in any way\" and in a specific order. They are not seen as being separated from the Source. The Qabalists agree that there are ten because ten is a perfect number, one which includes every digit without repetition, and contains the total essence of all num- bers. The number ten is therefore an all-embracing number. Outside of ten there exists no other such number, because what is beyond ten returns again to units. The Pillars The most important configuration which occurs on the Tree is that of three pillars formed by the natural succession of the Sephiroth. The left-hand pillar, also called the Pillar of Severity, consists of the spheres of Binah, Geburah, and Hod. The right- hand pillar, known as the Pillar of Mercy, is comprised of the spheres of Chokmah, Chesed, and Netzach. The central spheres of Kether, Tiphareth, Yesod, and Malkuth form the Middle Pillar, or the Pillar of Mildness. The right-hand or white pillar is described as masculine, positive and active. It is also known as the Pillar of Force. The left-hand or black pillar is femi- nine, negative and passive. This pillar is called the Pillar of Form. The black and 21 The word Sephirah is derived from the root word 'JlC, from which come sepher-\"book,\" siphar- \"number,\" sippur-\"story,\" and sipper-\"to tell.\""},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"60 SELF-INITIATION IN10 mE GoLDEN DAWN 'fRAomoN white pillars represent the two great contending Forces in Nature, and their descriptions are not meant to imply that one is good and the other evil, but rather that magnetic energy exists between these two universal opposite forces. The whole of the cosmos depends upon the perfect balance of these energies. The Middle Pillar is the pillar of balanced forces; the equilibrium of the other two columns. (In Golden Dawn temples only the left and right pillars are physically symbolized by actual pillars. The Middle Pillar is represented by the aspirant standing between the other two.) Sexual Polarity on the Tree There are numerous schools of Qabalistic thought that ascribe masculine or femi- nine attributes to each of the Sephiroth. Often times these various sources disagree with one another. Disagreements over Qabalah insure that the system is kept alive, dynamic, and expanding. (The minute everyone totally agrees with all the precepts of a specific esoteric system is the minute that system dies.) We too have often felt strongly about the sexual polarity of certain Sephiroth, only to change our minds later as our view of Tree of Life expanded. For the most part, each Sephirah is an abstraction that contains certain aspects which are characteristic of both sexual polarities. No one Sephirah is simply all masculine or all feminine. Here we will discuss the sexual polarities of the spheres as they relate to the three primary Elements of Fire, Water, and Air. As far as the spheres of the Tree are con- cerned, Fire is masculine, Water is feminine, and Air is neutral or androgynous. The Ten Sephiroth No. Name Transliteration Hebrew Translation 1.

The number 1, which encloses within itself the remaining nine digits of the deci- mal scale, was described by Pythagoras as the undividable Monad. It cannot be divided, yet it can be defined. By the process of reflection (1 + 1 = 2; 1 + 2 = 3; etc.), the Monad defines and generates all the other numbers. Kether is the point; it is the moment that the universe as we know it was conceived. Kether is the initial Spark or first Breath of the Divine. This sphere is placed at the summit of the Mid- dle Pillar on the Tree of Life, at the apex of Equilibrium. The Sepher Yetzirah, or Book of Formation, says of Kether: \"The First Path is called the Admirable or the Hidden Intelligence (the Highest Crown), for it is the Light giving the power of comprehension of that first principle which has no beginning; and it is the Primal Glory, for no created being can attain to its essence.\" The words \"Hidden Intelligence\" imply a hint of the unmanifest nature of Kether. The purest seeds of life (the Divine Spark) are found only at the level of the First Emanation, where they have always been-removed from the concept of having a \"beginning point:' The Divine Life Essence, as it descends the Tree of Life, is merely undergoing a process of transformation, from one form of energy to another (as explained in the teachings of Alchemy). The Sepher Yetzirah also indicates that no created being can hope to attain to the pure spiritual Light and Essence of Kether; that would be akin to an adult human being returning to the womb to become a fertilized egg. No being using a physical organism as its vehi- cle of consciousness can attain to the essence of Kether. However, if consciousness has been purified to the point where it transcends thought, it receives from the \"Primal Glory\" the power of comprehension of the First Principle. Kether is the sphere that contains all that was, is, and will be-it is the place of first emanation and ultimate return. The Crown is the sphere of pure spir- itual being; the point of absolute Unity without division-ultimate peace and one- ness. Kether is the dwelling place of the Divine White Brilliance, the Godhead which is androgynous, but that which contains the purest potentials of both male and female. It is the Source of All and the Highest Divine Essence of which we can conceive; the Primum Mobile or First Whirlings of Manifestation-a phrase which aptly describes the activity of the cosmic energy at the time the universe was cre- ated. All comes from Kether and all will ultimately return to Kether."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"62 SELF-INITIATION INTO lHE GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON CHOKMAH (Chohk-mah) Translation: WISDOM Key word: SUPERNAL FATHER Yetziratic Title: The ILLUMINATING INTELUGENCE Physical Representation: The ZODIAC Symbols: The Line, the Phallus, the Yod Chokmah is the second Sephirah, and its name means Wisdom. Chokmah is almost an extension of Kether-the overflowing of the Divine into a second, which is a reflection of the First. From the Absolute Unity of the One now comes the Two, the first active expression of polarity and the balance of opposites which forms the matrix of the manifest universe. According to the Sepher Yetzirah: \"The Second Path is that of illuminating Intelligence; it is the Crown of Creation, the Splendor of the Unity, equaling it, and it is exalted above every head, and named by the Qabalists the Second Glory.\" Chokmah is clearly confirmed here as the essence of illumination; not the same as that Brilliant Spark of Kether which exists on a higher plane, but as Wisdom-per- fect knowledge and understanding that has developed as a result of the reflection of Kether into a second sphere; a mirror of the First, enabling the Divine Spirit to both emanate from itself and behold itself. The \"Crown of Creation\" indicates that Chokmah was \"created\" from the Crown (Kether). Again we are presented with the idea that the Primal Spirit is not diminished in any way through the succession of the Sephiroth; \"the Splendor of UNITY, equaling it.\" That, \"it is exalted above every head,\" alludes to Chokmah's high position on the Tree along with the other Supernals above the Abyss. As the first Sephirah to develop polarity, Chokmah is placed at the summit of the Pillar of Mercy or the right-hand pillar. If Kether can be described as a point, then Chokmah could be portrayed as a straight line, an extension of the point into space. The energy of Chokmah is dynamic and outpouring, for it is the great Stim- ulator of the universe. Within Chokmah lies the first masculine (Fire) expression as opposed to the androgynous expression of Kether. Whereas Kether is the calm center point of the universe, Chokmah is complete action and movement-the vital energizing element of existence. It is the archetypal Positive and the Great Supernal Father, Abba. However, Chokmah is not simply a masculine sexual energy, but rather the root essence of masculine or dynamic Force.

Positive and Negative are inseparable properties; one cannot properly function without the other. Receptivity is a feminine attribute, and just as in the case of Chokmah (masculinity), we are again referring to sexual functions in the most basic and unmanifested of concepts. Chokmah, the Sephirah of duality, by necessity over- flows into a third sphere in order for another natural polarity to occur. Binah, the number three, is a sphere which builds Form (another feminine function). Binah receives the overflow of the dynamic current of energy from Chokmah and organizes it for the first time under the concept of Form. Force and Form are respective male and female properties which occur over and over again on the Tree of Life, but this is where they begin. It must be remembered that at this level on the Tree, the concept of Form exists only as a polarity and as the merest essence of the capacity to build Form, stemming from the excess negative (recep- tive) energy that has spilled over from Chokmah. Binah as Ama is the Disciplining Mother, restricting and structuring the free-flowing energy from Chokmah into what will ultimately be borne into organized Form. The first letter of Binah is Beth, which means \"house.\" Beth is also the archetypal symbol of all containers. Together, Chokmah and Binah are the two polarizing facets of manifesta- tion, the Supernal Father and the Supernal Mother, whose union results in the birth of the universe. Together, Chokmah and Binah are the \"Elohim,\" the Creator gods referred to in Genesis. They are the two primal building blocks of Life, the archetypal proton and electron, that comprise the whole of creation. The Sepher Yetzirah states this about Binah: \"The Third Path is the Sanctify- ing Intelligence: it is the foundation of Primordial Wisdom, which is called the Creator of Faith, and its roots are AMN; and it is the parent of Faith, from which doth Faith emanate.\" Here the Yetziratic text implies that Binah is still in a hal- lowed or blessed state because it remains above the Abyss in an unmanifested con- dition. Sanctification expresses the idea of that which is holy and set apart. It is given the title, \"Primordial Wisdom,\" because it is the primary source of organiza- tion at this stage of divine emanation where a distinct polarity has been defined on the Tree of Life. Binah is here referred to as the \"Creator of Faith.\" Faith rests upon understanding, whose parent is Binah. Faith is also defined as belief and venera- tion, but in the light of mystical consciousness, faith can be defined as the conscious result of superconscious experience. The average personality is not aware of this faith, but is nonetheless effected and modified by it, possibly with great feeling and emotional intensity. The statement that the roots of Binah are in AMN (Amen- meaning \"firm,\" \"faithful,\" and \"so be it\") refers to Kether. This clearly indicates that, although Binah issues from Chokmah, the source of ultimate Faith or Truth is from the Crown of Kether .. Although WiSdom is the quality of Chokmah, Understanding is assigned to Binah. WlSdom alludes to complete and infinite knowledge, while Understand- ing imparts the notion of an ability to grasp the ideas that are intrinsic to Wisdom."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"64 SELF-INTIlATION INlO THE GoLDEN DAWN l'RAomoN The Abyss Between Binah and the rest of the Sephiroth is a great chasm known as the Abyss. This marks a distinct separation between the higher and lower parts of the Tree, a difference in levels of being. The three Supemals of Kether, Chokmah, and Binah symbolize higher states of consciousness that transcend human awareness. The lower Sephiroth operate within the realm of ideas and thus are the only ones we can comprehend with our normal consciousness. In order to understand the intangible essence of the Supemals, one must cross the Abyss, which means leaving the earthly personality and the physical body behind in order to reach the Divine Self. Within the gulf of the Abyss is what is known as the \"Invisible Sephirah\" of Daath, which is not a true Sephirah, but which can be likened to a passageway across the Abyss. CHESED (Cheh-sed) Translation: MERCY (sometimes called Gedulah meaning \"Greatness\") Key word: BUILDER Yetziratic Title: The COHESNE or RECEPTIVE INTELLIGENCE Physical Representation: The sphere of JUPITER Symbols: The Pyramid, the Square, the Orb, the Equal-armed Cross, the Crook, the Scepter Chesed is the fourth Sephirah; its name means \"Mercy.\" This is the first sphere below the Abyss, the second Sephirah on the right-hand pillar. It is therefore the first sphere of our physical universe. In Chesed can be found the structural sup- port of all that is manifested. Chesed receives the current of divine energy which has been modified and disciplined by Binah and gives it another influx of energy. This begins the process of materializing the abstract energies of the Supemals (Kether, Chokmah, and Binah). Chesed is the matrix upon which the archetypal ideas will later be built into tangible form. The fourth Sephirah is also the first sphere thus far that may be comprehended by the human mind, because it is the solidification of the abstract ideas formulated by the Three Supemals. The patterns of the Tree of Life repeat themselves after the initial three spheres are formed; therefore Chesed is the same type of energy as Chokmah, but on a lower, more manifest level. While Chokmah may be likened to an All-Know- ing, All-Powerful Father, Chesed is the benevolent, loving and protective Father, who is unselfish and forgiving. However the functions of Chesed are essentially feminine, the aptitude for form-building and materialization. This is because for the first time on the Tree, the idea of manifestation below the Abyss is beginning to coagulate, and the concepts of masculine and feminine (positive and negative) are here beginning to blend together as the process of evolution down the Tree continues. But it must be remembered that Chesed is a Water potency, and that it is the daughter of Chokmah and Binah. As such Chesed shares some similarities with Tiphareth, the offspring of Chesed and Geburah. The Sepher Yetzirah says: \"The Fourth Path is named the Cohesive or Receptacular Intelligence; and it is so- called because it contains all the holy powers, and from it emanate all the spiritual"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Neophyte Grade 65 virtues with the most exalted essences: they emanate one from the other by the power of the Primordial Emanation, the Highest Crown, Kether.\" The term cohe- sive again refers to Chesed's capacity to gather together all the unmanifested ener- gies (the holy powers) it has received from the Supemals across the expanse of the Abyss. Again these powers or emanations are not in any way diminished as they descend the Tree and continue on the path of materialization. GEBURAH (Geh-boo-rah or Geh-voo-rah) Translation: SEVERITY / STRENGTH Key word: ENERGY Yetziratic Title: The RADICAL INTELLIGENCE Physical Representation: The sphere of MARS Symbols: The Pentagon, the Tudor Rose of Five Petals, the Sword, the Spear, the Scourge The fifth Sephirah, positioned below Binah on the left-hand pillar, is called Gebu- rah, which translates as \"Strength\" or \"Severity.\" Other titles given to this sphere are \"Justice\" and \"Fear\" (Pachad). Geburah is without a doubt the least understood and most feared Sephirah on the Tree. However, the natural order of the universe depends upon the concept of opposites in balance, thus the benevolence, mercy, and form-building qualities of Chesed are now equilibrated by the harsh, destruc- tive actions of the fifth sphere. Geburah's duty is to break down the Form issued by Chesed and apply discipline in the manner of a purging Fire. Any energy that makes its way down the Tree of Life into the material world must be tested and tempered by the opposites of Mercy and Severity. It must be cleansed in the fires of Geburah. All impurities must be burned away, just as the blade of a strong sword must be tested by the fires of the metalsmith's furnace. Only in this way can the energy be fashioned as a sturdy vehicle for manifestation. Geburah is the strong arm of God, commanding respect and burning away all that is useless or outmoded. The harsh, destructive action of this sphere is absolutely vital to further evolution. The energy of Geburah is not an evil force unless its essence spills over from justice to cruelty. Geburah is essentially a conciliatory power which restricts the mercifu1love of Chesed. Without the powerful force of Geburah, the mercies of Chesed would deteriorate into frivolity and weakness. Just as Chesed is the same energy as Chokmah on a lower level, Geburah is a lower form of Binah (the sphere which restricts and disciplines). However, Geburah displays Fire or masculine potency as opposed to Binah's Watery nature. On the other hand some sources insist that Geburah is primarily a feminine energy. It is only recently in our culture that the strength and determination of the feminine side are receiving notice and appreciation. (Nothing is more aggressive and ferocious than a Mother defending her child.) The same is true of Geburah, which aggressively deals with anything that corrupts the Divine current of energy from Kether. Again at this level on the Tree, the mixture of masculine and feminine traits in each sphere is becoming more and more evident. Geburah seems much"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"66 SELF-INITIATION lNTO THE GoLDEN DAWN 1RADIDON more harsh and restrictive than Binah, simply because it is below the Abyss, and its effects are more easily seen by us in the manifest universe. According to the Sepher Yeizirah: \"The Fifth Path is called the Radical Intel- ligence, because it resembles the Unity, uniting itself to Binah or Intelligence which emanates from the Primordial depths of WISdom or Chokmah.\" The word radical here implies basic or fundamental. Here the text tells us that Geburah, the Radical Intelligence, resembles Unity (one of the titles of Kether). Geburah's dynamic action overflowing into the world of form bears a close relationship to the overflowing force of Kether, which is the source of all manifestation. In addi- tion, Unity also implies the uniting of a new and distinct polarity in the spheres of Chesed and Geburah. Geburah \"unites itself with Binah\" because it is the same restrictive feminine energy of Binah on a lower, more manifest level. TIPHARETH (T' -fair-eth) Transwtwn:BEAtrrY Key word: MEDIATOR Yetziratic Title: The MEDIATING INTELLIGENCE Physical Representation: The sphere of SOL Symbols: The Calvary Cross, the Rose Cross, the Truncated Pyramid, the Cube, the letter Vav The sixth Sephirah is called Tiphareth or \"Beauty.\" Tiphareth lies at the very center of the Tree of Life on the Middle Pillar (the column of Equilibrium) and receives the powers of all the other Sephiroth. This sphere strikes the harmony between the Mercy of Chesed and the Severity of Geburah; therefore it contains the perfect bal- ance of both benevolent and aggressive energies. Because of its position on the Tree, in line with Kether, Tiphareth mirrors much of the pureness of the Crown, but on a deeper, more manifest level. By the union of Mercy and Justice, Beauty is obtained. The Sepher Yetzirah says: \"The Sixth Path is called the Mediating Intelli- gence, because in it are multiplied the influxes of the emanations, for it causes that influence to flow into all the reservoirs of the Blessings, with which these them- selves are united.\" This again refers to Tiphareth's position on the central pillar, mediating between the Pillars of Mercy and Severity. As a mediator, Tiphareth is also seen as a connecting link between higher and lower states of being (the Higher Self and the Lower Self). This sphere is a \"two-way switch\" which both receives the influxes of the emanations from above, and \"causes that influence to flow into all the reservoirs of the blessings.\" Tiphareth's neutral position on the central pillar along with its androgynous nature allows the influences to combine, multiply and increase. It is the outward manifestation of the higher and subtler Sephiroth, as well as the spiritual principle behind the lower and more manifest spheres. Until this point, we have described each Sephirah in abstract terms of Force and Form, Macrocosmic archetypes which are somewhat remote from us. But in Tiphareth, this changes, because the sixth Sephirah lies well within the range of human experience. The rest of the spheres from Tiphareth on down can be increasingly described by the effects they have on human consciousness,"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Neophyte Grade 67 than by polarities alone, since the four lowest Sephiroth are symbolic of the Lower Self or Personality (at least on the level of the Microcosm in Malkuth of Assiah).22 The center of the Tree of Life is the place of the Reconciler or Redeemer. God- forms of this energy include Christ, Buddha, and Osiris. This is because liphareth mediates between the Godhead in Kether and the rest of the material universe. The sixth Sphere is a link or point of transition. It reconciles That Which is Above to That Which is Below. liphareth intercedes between these different levels of Being. The sixth Sephirah is essentially a mystical sphere. The spiritual experi- ence that takes place in Tiphareth is the Vision of the Harmony of Things. This is due to the fact that the Higher Self, or Holy Guardian Angel, of every individual sits in Tiphareth; referring again to Tiphareth as the mirror of Kether-the Divine Self. The goal of all spiritual experience is the search for the Light, which is obtained by devotion to the Great Work. Tiphareth is the sphere of lllumination and of Healing. This is why the so-called Christ-consciousness is placed here. NETZACH (Net-zach) Translation: VICTORY Key word: EMOTIONS Yetziratic Title: The OCCULT INTELUGENCE Physical Representation: The sphere of VENUS Symbols: The Girdle, the Rose, the Lamp The Hebrew name of the seventh Sephirah is Netzach, which means \"Victory.\" It is the final sphere on the right-hand pillar. As we have already stated, the lower spheres of the Tree can be described in terms of human consciousness and experi- ence. This is especially true of the four remaining Sephiroth beginning with Net- zach. The sphere of Netzach is the dwelling place of human instincts, emotions, and desires. It is the \"feeling\" side of the personality that can be likened to the right side of the human brain. This is where human creativity is born. Once again the idea of polarity comes into play, because Netzach is considered primarily a Fire (masculine) sphere which has an opposing (Water) Sephirah to balance it. But at this level on the Tree (in the world of Assiah), we are truly discussing negative and positive sides of the human mind. Netzach is a dynamic force which inspires and drives us. This sphere is a reflection of the Fiery energy of Geburah, but at the level of the human personal- ity, mediated by Tiphareth, Fire becomes desire and emotion. Art, music, dance, and poetry are all expressions of Netzach energy. In this sphere we find all expres- sions of beauty and love, but also the less understood emotions of anger and hate, because all emotions dwell here. It is for this reason that the energies of Netzach must be balanced by its opposite, Hod. The seventh sphere is the home of the \"Group Mind,\" the storehouse of images and symbols in all of us, which inspires the artist, the dancer, and the musician. 22 The level of humanity in the lowest Qabalistic World of Assiah, See Chapter Two for more infor- mation about the four Worlds of the Qabalah."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"68 SELF-JNmATION INTO 1HE GoLDEN DAWN TRAomON The Sepher Yetzirah says: \"The Seventh Path is the Occult Intelligence, because it is the Refulgent Splendor of all the Intellectual virtues which are per- ceived by the eyes of the intellect, and by the contemplation of faith.\" The Occult Intelligence obviously refers to Hidden Intelligence. This is something hidden deep within ourselves that we must uncover-our Divine Nature that is kept hid- den from us by mundane obstacles. The Refulgent or Brilliant Splendor of the intellectual virtues is the Divine White Light mediated through the prism of Tiphareth, reflected into many-rayed hues (aspects of manifestation). The One Light has been reduced to the many for the purpose of manifestation into form. The phrase \"eyes of the intellect\" alludes to the Wisdom of Chokmah at the apex of the Pillar of Mercy while the passage\" contemplations of faith\" refers to the act of devotion, the impetus behind all spiritual attainment. HOD (Hohd) Translation: SPLENDOR Key word: INTELLECT Yetziratic Title: The ABSOLUTE or PERFECT INTELLIGENCE Physical Representation: The sphere of MERCURY Symbols: Names of Power, the Apron (Masonic) Hod is the eighth Sephirah, situated at the bottom of the Pillar of Severity. Its name means \"Splendor\" or \"Glory.\" Just as Netzach symbolizes raw animal instincts, Hod represents the intellectual part of the mind to which the \"left brain\" can be assigned. it is the rational Mind which organizes and categorizes. All expressions of writing, language, communication, science, and magic are assigned to Hod. All words and Names of Power have their origins in this sphere. We also find the idea of the \"Individual Mind\" here, as opposed to the Group Mind, which is in Netzach. It is the Individual Mind of Hod which makes one aware of one's personal relationship to the Divine. Hod is a lower form of the energy found in Chesed but mediated through Tiphareth. The energy of Hod is Watery (feminine) and fluidic. Hod and Netzach cannot function properly one without the other.The Eighth Sphere is where the emo- tions and instincts of Netzach take form and come into action. Intellect needs the bal- ance of emotion to drive it; otherwise the words and science of Hod become mere rationallabelings, dead and uninspired. Likewise, emotions need the discipline of intellect to stabilize and ground, to keep the dynamic energy from being squandered. The relationship between Hod and Netzach is symbiotic. In terms of the individual, the two spheres must be in harmony in order to maintain a healthy personality. According to the Sepher Yetzirah: \"The Eighth Path is called the Absolute or Perfect Intelligence, because it is the mean of the primordial, which has no root by which it can cleave, nor rest, except in the hidden places of Gedulah, Magnifi- cence, from which emanates its own proper essence.\" It is the Perfect Intelligence because it is the mean (median) of the primordial. This implies a position halfway between two extremes: Force and Form. Hod is also the seat of the Intellect. To borrow the terms of Astrology, this correlates to the idea of Intellect being in the"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The Neophyte Grade 69 house of its \"dignity\"-a placement which is advantageous, or \"perfect.\" Hod's root, from which it cannot be separated, is the watery sphere of Chesed, also called Gedulah or magnificence. YESOD (Yeh-sohd) Translation: FOUNDATION Key word: ASTRALLIGHT Yetziratic Title: The PURE INTELLIGENCE Physical Representation: The sphere of LUNA Symbols: Perfume, Sandals The ninth Sephirah, Yesod, whose name means \"Foundation,\" is the third Sphere on the Middle Pillar. It is the result of the union between Netzach and Hod. The spiritual experience of Yesod is the vision of the machinery of the universe. What this implies is that Yesod is the sphere of the astral Light, also known as the Akasha. This is the etheric substance which underlies all dense matter. It is the astral matrix upon which the physical universe is built. Yesodis the receptacle of influences from all of the preceding Sephiroth, which are then combined into a type of blueprint made from the astral Light. This blueprint is the \"Foundation\" or Etheric Double upon which the earthly plane is constructed. All events, whether natural or man- made, occur in the aethers of Yesod before they occur in the physical world. The ninth Sephirah is that last push which activates the final manifestation of Form. In the same manner, all the Planets were born out of the mind of God, and all man- made inventions first appeared as ideas in the Yesodic part of the inventor's mind. Yesod is the seat of intuition in humankind. In addition, most magical operations take place in the sphere of Yesod, because the magician seeks to effect changes in the physical world by manipulating the subtle currents of the astral. Like Kether and Tiphareth, Yesod is androgynous, yet the energy here is also sexual, because in Yesod the sexes are for the first time given the form that they will take in the Earthly plane. At this level on the Tree, Yesod is like a pregnant mother about to give birth. Sired by the whole of the Sephirotic influences above it, the child born is the manifest universe itself. According to the Sepher Yetzirah: \"The Ninth Path is the Pure Intelligence, so called because it purifies the Numerations, it proves and corrects the designing of their representation, and disposes their unity with which they are combined without diminution or division.\" The text states clearly that it is Yesod's duty to purify and correct the emanations. Although the emanations which flow down the Tree are intrinsically pure, they may need to be proven or corrected in order to fit them into a vehicle of dense matter. Yesod also disposes (orders) the unity of these emanations, so that only the most worthy manifested vehicles are designed for the reception of the divine energy, which is brought into the physical universe with- out becoming diminished in any way from its essential purity."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"70 SELF-INITIATION INlO 1HE GoLOEN DAWN TRAOmON MALKUTH (Mahl-kooth) Translation: KINGDOM Key word: COMPLETION, STABILITY Yetziratic Title: The RESPLENDENT INTELLIGENCE Physical Representation: The sphere of the EARTH Symbols: The Equal-armed Cross, the Mystic Circle, the Triangle of Art (Evocation), Heh Final Malkuth means \"The Kingdom.\" It is the tenth and last sphere on the Tree of life which is located at the bottom of the central pillar. This is the ultimate sphere of Form and of final manifestation, the material universe as we know it. Malkuth is essentially the sphere of humanity, and of sensation. The physical representation of Malkuth is the Planet Earth, our own terra firma. It is the seat of matter. Yet Malkuth is more than simply the ground beneath our feet, it is also the Sephirah in which all four Elements are based. Therefore when discussing Malkuth (in Assiah), we are really talking about the physical manifestations of Fire, Water, Air and Earth. There are three states of matter which correspond to the elements: solid-Earth, liquid-Water, and gas- Air. (Fire is assigned to the principle of electricity.) The sum of all physical phenom- ena are classified under the four Elements in order to comprehend their character. All of these Elements are used to describe the material nature of Malkuth. Malkuth is the ultimate receptacle for the combined currents of energy on the entire Tree of Life. While the other Sephiroth are basically kinetic and mobile, Malkuth is the only sphere that has achieved stability and inertia (a period of rest). It is also the only sphere which is not a part of a triad. The tenth and final sphere receives the etheric framework of manifestation (the influences from Yesod) and completes the building process by grounding the energy in matter. Malkuth is the container for the emanations of the other nine Sephiroth. As the absolute Sphere of Form and passivity, the fertile Malkuth is also known as the Inferior Mother (as opposed to the Great Mother, Binah), the Bride, and the Queen. Another title is the Gate, which implies that we as physical beings live out our lives in the realm of Malkuth, only to pass through the Gate upon leaving our bodies behind. The tenth Sephirah is seen as the completion of the Tree of Life in one sense, and the beginning of a new Tree in another, because Malkuth is a lower reflection of Kether, and is in fact the Kether of another Tree. According to the Sepher Yetzirah: \"The Tenth Path is the Resplendent Intel- ligence, so called because it is exalted above every head, and sits on the throne of Binah. It illuminates the splendor of all the Lights, and causes an influence to emanate from the Prince of Countenances, the Angel of Kether.\" The title \"Resplendent Intelligence\" implies a close relationship between Malkuth and Kether, the first and last sphere of the Tree. At this point the emanations are com- pleted and the result is the brilliance of the unified Tree of Life. Malkuth now becomes Kether of another Tree on another level. The mention of the throne of Binah implies another close relationship; Binah, the Great Mother, is the primor- dial giver of Form, while Malkuth, the Lesser Mother, is the final giver of Porm.e"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The Neophyte Grade 71 SECTION 6: The Hebrew Alphabet The Hebrew Alphabet was originally designed as a pictorial or hieroglyphic alphabet similar to that of the Egyptians. Each letter is a visual representation of an object. In addition to this however, Hebrew is the primary alphabet of Western magic. Not only does each letter have a literal meaning, but also an esoteric meaning, a numerical value, a color, a sound and various other hidden corre- spondences associated with it. The letters of the Hebrew Alphabet are sacred sym- bols which attract real forces that the magician can orchestrate by the techniques of visualization and vibration. These letters can also have a psychological influ- ence on the aspirant who meditates upon them-affecting changes in conscious- ness. The importance of memorizing the Hebrew alphabet cannot be stressed enough, for it is one tool that the magician will use constantly throughout his/her ceremonial workings. The twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet correspond to the twenty- two Paths of the Tree of Life. Unlike English, Hebrew is written from right to left. In addition to this, all of the Hebrew letters are consonants; there are no vowels. At times the letters Yod and Vav may function as vowels, and the silent letters Aleph and Ayin can be used to indicate the position of a vowel, but again none of these letters are vowels. It was not until well into the Christian era that a system for indi- cating vowels with a dagesh (or pointing) was developed in order to standardize pronunciation. We will not enter into a discussion concerning the pointing system here, but such information is readily available in modem Hebrew texts. Please note that five of the Letters (Kaph, Mem, Nun, Peh, and Tzaddi) have two forms associated with them.

I) Israel Regardie was adamant about the idea that Neophytes should be able to draw the Hebrew letters to the best of their ability. To this end he provided our tem- ples with Hebrew practice sheets for students. Regardie suggested that the student use a calligraphy pen to draw the letters. For the sake of ease and simplicity, we sug- gest that the Neophyte use a writing instrument called a lettering pen or calligraphy marker. This type of marker has a felt tip which is wide along one edge. The marker can be held with the wide edge of the tip perpendicular to the lines on the practice sheets. The upward/ downward and left-to-right movement of the marker across the page will result in the thin vertical lines and the thick horizontal lines. Always remember that the Hebrew letters are holy symbols and as such they should be carefully and faithfully rendered.

The archaic pictures on the one Pillar are painted in black upon a white ground, and those on the other in white upon a black ground, in order to express the interchange and reconciliation of opposing forces and the eternal balance of Light and Darkness which gives force to visible nature. The black cubical bases represent darkness and matter wherein the Spirit, the Ruach Elohim, began to formulate the Ineffable NAME, that Name which the ancient Rabbis have said \"rushes through the universe,\" that Name before which the Darkness rolls back at the birth of time. The flaming red triangular capitals which crown the summit of the Pillars represent the Triune manifestation of the Spirit of Life, the Three Mothers of the Sepher Yetsirah, the Three Alchemical Principles of Nature, the Sulphur, the Mer- cury and the Salt. Each Pillar is surmounted by its own light-bearer veiled from the mate- rial world. At the base of both Pillars rise the Lotus flowers, symbols of regeneration and metempsychosis. The archaic illustrations are taken from vignettes of the 17th and 125th chapter of the Ritual of the Dead, the Egyptian Book of the Per-em-Hru or the Book of Coming Forth into the Day, the oldest book in the world as yet discovered. The Recension of the Priests of ON is to be found in the walls of the pyramids of the Kings of the 5th and 6th Dynasties at Sakarah, the recension of the 11th and 12th Dynasties on the sarcophagi of that period, and the Theban recension of the 18th Dynasty and onward is found on papyri, both plain and illuminated. No sat- isfactory translation of these books is available, none having been yet attempted by a scholar having the qualifications of mystic as well as Egyptologist. The Ritual of the Dead, generally speaking, is a collection of hymns and prayers in the form of a series of ceremonial Rituals to enable the man to unite himself with Osiris the Redeemer. After this union he is no longer called the man, but Osiris, with whom he is now symbolically identified. \"That they also may be One of us,\" said Christ of the New Testament. \"1 am Osiris\" said the purified and justified man, his soul luminous and washed from sin in the immortal and uncre- ated light, united to Osiris, and thereby justified, and the son of God; purified by 24 From Regardie's The Golden Dawn."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The Neophyte Grade 79 suffering, strengthened by opposition, regenerate through self-sacrifice. Such is the subject of the great Egyptian Ritual. The 17th Chapter of the Theban recension consists of a very ancient text with several commentaries, also extremely old, and some prayers, none of which come into the scheme of the original text. It has, together with the 12th chapter, been very carefully translated for the purpose of this lecture by the V.H. Frater M.W.T [Marcus Blackden], and y.n Soror S.S.D.o. [Florence Farr] has made many valuable suggestions with regard to the interpretation. The Title and Preface of the 17th Chapter reads: \"Concerning the exaltation of the Glorified Ones, of Coming and Going forth in the Divine Domain, of the Genies of the Beautiful land of Amentet. Of Coming forth in the Light of Day in any form desired, of Hearing the Forces of Nature by being enshrined as a living Bai.\" And the rubric is: lithe united with Osiris shall recite it when he has entered the Harbour. May glorious things be done thereby upon earth. Mayall the words of the Adept be fulfilled.\" Owing to the complex use of symbols, the ritual translation of the Chapter can only be understood by perpetual reference to the ancient Egyptian commen- taries, and therefore the following paraphrase has been put together to convey to modern minds as nearly as possible the ideas conceived by the old Egyptians in this glorious triumphal song of the Soul of Man made one with Osiris, the Redeemer. \"I am TUM made One with all things. \"I have become NU. I am RA in his rising ruling by right of his Power. I am the Great God self-begotten, even NU, who pronounced His Names, and thus the Circle of the Gods was created. \"I am Yesterday and Tomorrow.

Thy Power is exceeding great. The Gods curse him that curseth Thee. Thine Aspirations are fulfilled.

The literal translation of the opening lines is as follows: \"I have come from afar to look upon thy beauties. My hands salute Thy Name of Justice. I have come from afar, where the Acacia Tree grew not. Where the tree thick with leaves is not born. Where there come not beams from herb or grass. I have entered the Place of Mystery. I have communed with Set. Sleep came upon me, I was wrapped therein, bowing down before the hidden things. I was ushered into the House of Osiris. I saw the marvels that were there.

The Hall is presided over by a God who holds his right"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The Neophyte Grade 81 hand over the cage of a hawk, and his left over the food of eternity. On each side of the God is a cornice crowned by a row of alternate feathers and Uraei symbol- ising justice and fiery power. The door leaf which completes the right hand of a stall is called \"Possessor of Truth controlling the Feet,\" while that on the left is \"Possessor of strength, binding the male and female animals.\" The 42 Judges of the Dead are represented as seated in a long row, and each of them has to be named, and the Sin over which he presided has been denied. This chapter describes the introduction of the initiate into the Hall of truth by ANUBIS, who, having questioned the aspirant, receives from him an account of his initiation, and is satisfied by his right to enter. He states that he has been taken into the ante-chamber of the temple and there stripped and blind-folded, he had to grope for the entrance of the Hall, and having found it, he was reclothed and anointed in the presence of the Initiated. He is then asked for the Pass-words and demands that his Soul should be weighed in the Great Balance of the Hall of Truth, whereupon ANUBIS again interrogates him concerning the symbolism of the door of the Hall, and his answers being found correct, ANUBIS says: \"Pass on, thou knowest it.\" Among other things the Initiate states that he has been purified four times, the same number of times that the Neophyte is purified and consecrated in the ceremony of the Neophyte. He then makes the long Negative Confession, stating to each Judge in turn that he is innocent of that form of Sin over which he judges. Then he invokes the Judges to do him justice, and afterwards describes how he had washed in the washing place of the South, and rested in the North, in the place called \"Son of the Deliverers\" and he becomes the Dweller under the Olive Tree of Peace, and how he was given a tall flame of fire and a sceptre of cloud which he preserved in the salting tank in which mummies were swathed. And he found there another sceptre called \"Giver of Breath\" and with that he extin- guished the flame and shattered the sceptre of cloud, and made a lake of it. The initiate is then brought to the actual Pillars, and has to name them and their parts under the symbol of the Scales of a Balance. He also has to name the Guardian of the Gateway, who prevents his passage, and when all these are propitiated, the plea of the Hall itself cries out against his steps, saying \"Because I am silent, because I am pure,\" and it must know that his aspirations are pure enough and high enough for him to be allowed to tread upon it. He is then allowed to announce to Thoth that he is clean from all evil, and has overcome the influence of the planets, and THOTH says to him: ''Who is He whose Pylons are of Flame, whose walls of Living Uraei, and the flames of whose House are streams of Water?\" And the Initiate replies \"Osiris!\" And it is immediately proclaimed: ''Thy meat shall be from the Infinite, and thy drink from the Infinite. Thou art able to go forth to the sepulchral feasts on earth, for thou hast overcome.\" Thus, these two chapters, which are represented by their illustrations upon the Pillars, represent the advance and purification of the Soul and its union with"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"82 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRADmON Osiris, the Redeemer, in the Golden Dawn of the Infinite Light, in which the Soul is transfigured, knows all, and can do all, for it is made One with the Eternal God.

These rites create a firm groundwork of ceremonial methods that the student will utilize throughout his/her entire magical life. They also serve as constant reminder of the goal of the path of an initiate. The Outer Wand of Double Power This is a simple wand that is employed in the basic Golden Dawn techniques of invoking and banishing. It consists of a dowel that is approximately 20\" in length. Half of the wand is painted white for invoking and half is painted black for banishing.e THE QABALISTIC CROSS (QC) Stand and face East. Imagine a brilliant white Light touching the top of your head. Reach up with the index finger or blade of a dagger to connect with the Light and bring it to the forehead. Touch the forehead and vibrate, \"ATAH,\" (Ah-tah-meaning \"Thou art\"). Touch the breast and bring the dagger blade or index finger down till it covers the heart or abdominal area, pointing down to the ground. Imagine the Light descend- ing from the forehead to the feet. Vibrate \"MALKUTH,\" (Mahl-kooth-meaning \"The Kingdom\"). Touch the right shoulder and visualize a point of Light there.

Facing East, use the index finger of the right hand, a dagger, or the black end of the Outer Wand of Double Power to trace a large banishing pentagram of Earth. Thrust the dagger/wand tip or index finger through the center of the pentagram and vibrate \"YHVH.\" (Yode-Heh-Vav-Heh), (Keep the right arm extended throughout; never let it drop. The pentagrams should be visualized in either a flaming blue or brilliant white Light.) Turn to the South and trace the same pentagram there. Charge the figure as before, intoning \"ADONA/\" (Ah- doh-nye). Turn to the West and trace the pentagram. Charge it with \"EHEIEH\" (Eh-hey-yay). Turn to the North and draw the pentagram, intoning \"AGLA\" (Ah-gah-lah). Keep the arm extended. Turn to face the East. Extend both arms out in the form of a cross and say, \"Before me RAPHAEL\" (Rah-fahy-el). VISualize before you the great Archangel of Air rising out of the clouds in flowing yellow and violet robes, carrying a Caduceus Wand.

(I Uses of the Pentagram Ritual This simple yet powerful cleansing ritual can be used as a protection against the impure magnetism of others. It is also a way to rid oneself of obsessing or dis- turbing thoughts. Give a mental image to your particular thought or disturbance and visualize it before you. Project it out of your aura with the Saluting Sign of a Neophyte, and when it is away from you, prevent its return with the Sign of Silence. Then imagine the form in the East and perform the LBRP. See the form dissolving on the outside of your ring of flaming pentagrams. The LBRP can be used as an exercise in concentration. While seated or lying down, formulate yourself standing up in robes and holding a dagger. Place your consciousness in this astral form and go to the East. Make yourself \"feel\" there by touching the wall, opening your eyes, stamping on the floor, etc. Let your astral form perform the ritual, circumambulating the room and mentally vibrating the words. Finish in the East and try to see your results astrally, then walk back and stand behind your physical body and let your astral body be re-absorbed. The LBRPis to be performed daily for no less than a period of six months. In fact, it should be practiced daily regardless of one's grade. The Golden Dawn manuscripts advocated doing the invoking form of this ritual in the morning and the banishing form at night. However we feel that the Neophyte needs to concen- trate solely on the banishing form, since s/he has a tendency to light up on the astral and unknowingly attract all manner of Elementals at this early stage of the Work. It is far more important for the Neophyte to know how to banish rather than to invoke. Anyone can attract an Elemental or an energy. Getting rid of the same can be more difficult.e"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"The Neophyte Grade ADORATION TO THE LORD OF THE UNIVERSE 85 Face East and say, \"Holy art Thou, Lord of the Universe!\" Give the Projection Sign.

Concen- trating their faculties on this, as a focus, let him endeavour to realise the Imma- nence of the Divine throughout Nature, in all her aspects. Begin by finding a position, balanced, but sufficiently comfortable. Breathe rhyth- mically until the body is still and the mind quiet. Keep this state for a few minutes at first-and for longer as you get more used to preventing the mind from wan- dering. Think now of the subject for meditation in a general way-then choose one thought or image and follow that to its conclusion. The simplest rhythm for the beginner is the Fourfold Breath. 1. Empty the lungs and remain thus while counting 4. 2. Inhale, counting 4, so that you feel filled with breath to the throat. 3. Hold this breath while counting 4. 4. Exhale, counting 4 till the lungs are empty. This should be practised, counting slowly or quickly till you obtain a rhythm that suits you-one that is comforting and stilling. Having attained this, count the breath thus for two or three minutes, till you feel quiet, and then proceed with the meditation.

In our modem secular society, human beings can easily become detached from that which is spiritual. In order to reaffirm our awareness of our- selves as beings who are a part of a greater Divine Self, it is important to make a ritual gesture confirming a link between the Eternal and ourselves. This Eternal Self is readily symbolized by the luminary of Sol, the Sun; the symbol of both Light and Life on Earth. Although the Divine Self is encompassed by the idea of One, Sol, as a vis- ible representation of the Divine is referred to four daily positions: East-Dawn, South-Noon, West-Sunset, and North-Midnight. Consequently, an adoration is directed towards Sol at each of these four positions. Israel Regardie suggested that the student perform the four adorations from Aleister Crowley's Liber Resh vel Helios.

This awareness also includes the ability to experience the Elements and balance them in equal portion within the mind. It is vitally important that the solitary student, working without the aid of an established temple, be able to consciously equilibrate those psychic Elements. Beginning with the Neophyte grade and especially in the higher grades of the Outer Order, the student must be constantly on guard against Elemental imbal- ance. The simple rite of the Qabalistic Cross is very useful for this purpose; how- ever, we suggest that the student also perform the following Rite of Elemental Equilibration to actively combat such imbalances that may occur during the trans- formative process of self-initiation. This is a ritual that should be performed regu- larly, regardless of one's grade status. Stand facing the East and perform the Fourfold Breath a number of times until you feel relaxed.

The only way to increase sensitivity is to become aware-aware of that which is within, as well as that which is without. Sitting comfortably or lying down, merely attempt to observe what is happening with your own body. Simply watch your physical body and its various sensations. Do not do anything special; breathe normally and don't try to relax or control wandering thoughts. Just try to notice what happens. After a few moments, find a comfortable position, then stay in it, without moving or consciously fidgeting in any way. Remain perfectly still. At first this exercise should be practiced for no more than ten minutes. Gradually increase the time spent in practice so that by the end of the student's time in the Neophyte grade, this exercise is extended to half an hour. Obviously, this exercise will be simple to some, terribly difficult to others. Any urge to wiggle and release tension should be resisted. 26 This arrangement relates to the four colors of the sphere of Malkuth as projected onto the body of the aspirant. The Fire of Geburah (right shoulder) is reflected across the Tree to Netzach (YHVH Tzabaoth) and reflected back again into the russet quarter of Malkuth. Likewise the Water of .Chesed (left shoulder) is reflected across the Tree to Hod (Elohim Tzabaoth) and reflected back again to the olive quarter of Malkuth."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"92 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoWEN DAWN TRADITION The powers of concentration should also be developed as this awareness exercise is practiced. If the mind begins to wander, gently bring it back. Your powers of concentration will gradually but steadily become enhanced. During this practice, you may become aware of itching sensations in various parts of your body. Do not attempt to scratch. Merely observe. Simply be aware of var- ious body sensations without trying to alter or ignore them. Do not make judg- ments or criticisms about these sensations. Accept them as a part of you. Sensations will come and go in different areas of the body. Study them. It is sometimes a good idea to verbally express what you are feeling or experiencing. This exercise will result in a profound relaxation of nervous tension. Daily practice will heighten the function of self-awareness, something that is vital to the work of an initiate. All complex ceremonies and rituals actually begin with this heighten- ing of self-awareness. No special time period needs to be found to practice this. Lying in bed at night or in the morning is certainly an excellent time to rehearse body awareness. This exer- cise should be done twice daily while in the Neophyte grade. In addition to this, short periods of temporary pause from activity can be taken throughout the day during bathing, shaving or dressing, etc., in order to sharpen one's perceptions and observe what is happening within.c EXTRASENSORY AWARENESS EXERCISE Obtain a set of ESP cards such as those developed in the parapsychology labora- tory at Duke University (for sale at most occult bookstores). The drawings on these cards are simple symbols-one symbol per card. Shuffle the cards. Place the cards face down and place your hand upon the top card. Make your mind as blank as possible and attempt to guess what image is on the front of the card (square, circle, cross, waves, or star). Go through the entire deck in this fashion, at least once daily. Do not get discouraged if you do not often guess correctly. Record your results.c"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The Neophyte Grade Suggested Reading 93 Introduction to the First Edition of The Golden Dawn by Israel Regardie Introduction to the Second Edition of The Golden Dawn by Israel Regardie A Garden of Pomegranates by Israel Regardie The Mystical Qabalah by Dion Fortune The Training and Work of an Initiate by Dion Fortune The Kybalion by Three Initiates \"The ABC's of Qabalah\" by Harvey Newstrom, published in The Golden Dawn Journal, Book II, Qabalah, Theory and Magic \"The Tree of Life, Jacob's Extending Ladder\" by Gareth Knight, published in The Golden Dawn Journal, Book II, Qabalah, Theory and Magic Introduction to The Golden Dawn Journal, Book III, TheArt of Hermes \"Logos Revealed\" by Madonna Compton, published in The Golden Dawn Journal, Book III, The Art of Hermes Examinations (Answers for all exams are given in the back of this book.)

The initiation ceremonies of these Elemen- tal grades are those of the Zelator, Theoricus, Practicus and Philoso- \" '. I. phusP which are each referred to one of the four Elements of the \"~' Tetragrammaton: Earth, Air, Water and Fire. As a group, these four grades represent the essential work of the Golden Dawn, that is to equilibrate the Elemental forces within the psyche of the aspirant. These \"inner Elements\" can be characterized as distinct sections of the subconscious mind. The process under- taken by an initiate advancing through the grades is truly an alchemical one; the psychic mechanism of the candidate undergoes a kind of dissolution during the ceremony of the Neophyte. The integral Elements are awakened and purified through the Elemental grade ceremonies, until at length all of the base compo- nents are consecrated and integrated back into the psyche of the Initiate. The first step is of course to awaken the Elemental portions;' for unless their existence is realized, the work of alchemical transformation cannot take place. Through symbol and ceremony, the initiation rites of each grade summon forth the spirits and entities of a particular Element. Contact with a specific Ele- mental force produces a kind of magnetic attraction, whereby the corresponding Elemental energy is awakened within the sphere of the aspirant. Only then can further advancement and growth take place. Thus aroused, the Elemental por- tions of the mind become consecrated to union with the Higher Self and ulti- mately to the consummation of the Great Work. This process allows the initiate to bring vast amounts of energy and inspiration from the formerly untapped sub- conscious depths into the domain of the conscious mind where it can be utilized for further spiritual growth. The Element offered for the act of transmutation in this grade is Earth- specifically the Earthy part of the aspirant's psyche. This ritual is the first to truly confer the title of initiate upon the candidate, symbolically launching his/her ini- tial step onto the Tree of Life. Thus do the numbers 1 = 10 refer to this important first step onto the Tenth Sephirah, Malkuth. The Zelator Grade lays the foundation for all subsequent Elemental transmutations within the aspirant's sphere of sen- sation. The name Zelator comes from a Greek word for \"zealot.\" 27 All of these names, along with that of Neophyte, are titles of traditional Rosicrucian grades. 99"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"100 SELF-INITIATION INTO TIlE GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON The only Planet assigned to this grade is Terra Firma, the Planet Earth beneath our feet. This is perhaps only one of the reasons why the Zelator grade has such a profound effect on those who attain it. The Zelator Ritual is also meant to ground the candidate firmly in the stabilizing Element of Earth. One of its primary functions is to strengthen the candidate in both mind and body for the difficult work of alchemical transformation which lies ahead. In fact the Zelator Ritual is often said to be the only true initiation ceremony out of all the Elemental grades-the rest being advancements which continue the process started in the 1 = 10. This is due to the fact that the Zelator ritual establishes the aspirant firmly in Earth of Malkuth, and the three grades beyond the 1 = 10 explore the other sub-Elements of Malkuth. The task of a Golden Dawn magician is not an easy one-the very act of advancing through the grades will accelerate any stresses (physical, personal, or mental) that lie dormant within the candidate. Any such difficulties must be con- fronted and resolved before taking any further grade initiations. This is one of the reasons why we suggest that the student of this course spend a good deal of time in each grade. The 1 = 10 is also well known as the grade that will separate the wheat from the chaff. Many of those individuals who reach this level, but whose primary motives for getting involved in magic are questionable (escapism, cravings for power or title, or adherence to the current magical \"fad\") will drop out because of the \"filter\" effect of the Zelator Ceremony. All of the Elemental grades act to screen out those who cannot bear the task of transformation, but the main thrust of this filtering effect will be felt in the 1 = 10 grade. Israel Regardie often stated that if a magician couldn't function in the Earthy material World of Malkuth, then he had no business attempting to reach the Higher Realms. The ceremony of the Zelator can be briefly summarized as follows: As in all of the initiation ceremonies presented in this book, the goddess Thme, repre- sentative of the candidate's Higher Self, is called upon to safely arbitrate between the divine powers and the aspirant. (Note: Ahexagram is formed by the positions of the astral officer/ godforms twice in the ceremony, both at the opening and at the closing when the Elemental powers of Earth are being addressed.) After the forces of Elemental Earth are invoked, the candidate is tested on the secrets of the Neophyte grade. The aspirant then swears a further oath and is ceremonially brought to two stations-that of Evil and that of Good. At both of these stations, the Guardians of the Paths repel the unprepared candidate. The aspirant then takes the Middle Path of Equilibrium where s/he is again barred by the Guardians, but eventually the way is cleared by the Guardian of the Celestial Soul. It is during this journey along the path of balance that the stabilizing Element of Earth is established within the aura of the aspirant, so that eventually s/he may prove to be a worthy vessel of the Divine Spirit. The aspirant is at this point a liv- ing cross of manifestation within the white triangle of art formed by the officer/ god- forms and represented by the diagram at his/her feet. In the beginning of this ritual the altar occupies a position much farther East than its previous position in the Neophyte Hall. The pillars are moved well toward the West of the temple. The officers' stations in the Zelator Hall are six in"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Zelator Grade 101 number: Hierophant, Hiereus, Hegemon, Keryx, Stolistes, and Dadouchos. (The station of the Phylax remains outside the Hall.) During the initial part of the cere- mony, the stations of these six officers form a triangle, the emblem of Supernal revelation and the symbol of magical evocation. The three lesser officers compose the base, Hiereus and Hegemon (representatives of the opposing Light and Dark- ness) are beside the altar, and the Hierophant, who personifies the higher powers, is situated at the apex. This triangle, apex upwards, is also a triangle of Fire, which points out a curious relationship that exists between the letters Yod (Fire) and Heh Final (Earth) of Tetragrammaton. (Keep in mind that the group of Angels assigned to Malkuth is known as the Ashim, or the \"Souls of Fire.\" The Admission Badge of this grade, the Fylfot Cross or Swastika, is another key to the puzzle, because it is formed from seventeen squares out of a square of twenty-five lesser squares. Twenty-five is also the number of squares attributed to the Qamea of Mars.) Thus initiation into the Earthy Zelator grade and the sphere of Malkuth indicates that a certain amount of Fire energy is also involved. Since advancement through the Elemental grades symbolizes an Alchemical process of examination and dissolu- tion within the aspirant, it is no surprise that we find a fiery undercurrent infil- trating this initial step onto the Tree of Life. In the next portion of the ceremony the candidate is then allowed to enter the sanctuary, where s/he symbolically treads the path of a Priest of the Hebrew mysteries. The symbolism of the ancient Tabernacle in the Wilderness, the first physical Qabalistic temple in Malkuth, is gradually revealed to the aspirant. This and other symbolism relating to the Earth grade are disclosed until finally the Earth powers are released. During this segment in the ritual, the stations of the officers form a cross. The shaft of the cross is created by the three primary officer / godforms in align- ment with the altar, while the stations of Stolistes and Dadouchos compose the crossbar. This cross formation stresses the four Elements as a balanced \"whole\" within the manifest universe, as well as the four sub-Elements of Malkuth. It also implies the need for the balance of psychic Elements within the candidate as well. (Note that the cross surrounded by a circle is the symbol of Malkuth.) The fact that the cross here is composed of five officers (not four or six) alludes to the penta- gram, the number of man-the microcosm, and the initiate. But it also refers to the fifth Element of Spirit which surmounts and guides the other four. Godfonns of the Outer Order Grades Unlike the Neophyte grade, the specific godforms to be employed in the remaining Outer Order grades are not set and carved in stone. In the Hermetic community there are differing opinions as to which godforms are present in the Elemental grades. For the purposes of this course, we have chosen to use the godforms first introduced in the Neophyte grade: Hierophant = Osiris, Hiereus = Horus, Hegemon = Thme, etc. The Zelator initiation ceremony introduces three important Archangelic forms to the candidate. They can be visualized during the ritual using the follow- ing descriptions."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"102 SELF-INfTIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRADITION Archangelic Forms of the Zelator Grade SAMAEL: (Hebrew meaning poison of God) Although described in the Zelator Rit- ual as an Archangel, Samael is more often described as an Archdemon, or as the Qlippotic force of the Sephirah of Hod on the black pillar. In this ritual Samael is portrayed as the guardian of the Path of Evil who prevents the candidate from journeying upon the Path of Darkness. Samael may be visualized as a black winged bird-like entity with glowing eyes. He wears a robe, tabard and nemyss, all black. He holds a large black sword. METATRON: (Hebrew. Possible Greek meaning: near thy throne) Metatron is usually described as the most powerful Archangel of Kether. In the Zelator cer- emony, Metatron is the Guardian of the Path of Good, and the Kerub of the right- hand pillar. He bars the candidate from entering the Path of Good. Metatron is visualized as a horned male figure with dark hair and beard. He is dressed in a robe, tabard and nemyss, all white. He holds a miter-headed scepter. SANDALPHON: (Hebrew. Possible Greek meaning: Lordeof Height) San- dalphon is described as the Archangel of Malkuth and the Kerub of the left-hand pillar. In the Zelator ceremony, she is the Reconciler for Earth, mediating between Good and Evil on behalf of the candidate. Sandalphon is visualized as a tall horned female figure dressed in a black robe. She wears a tabard in the four colors of Malkuth and a white nemyss. She bears a crown-headed scepter. In the months that follow the 1 = 10 initiation, the aspirant must strive to thoroughly absorb knowledge which relates to the Element of Earth. Much of this is presented in the Second Knowledge Lecture given in this chapter, along with other material for the Zelator to study, including sections on the Astrological houses, Alchemy, Geomancy, gemstones and metals, and the Qabalistic hierar- chies. The task of the Zelator is to thoroughly assimilate this knowledge and to awaken the stabilizing Element of Earth within, so that further spiritual transmu- tation of the psychic Elements can take place. The aspirant must never forget the potent statement given in the Ceremony of the 1 = 10: \"Except Adonai build the house, their labor is but lost that build it... \"(r THE ZELATOR CEREMONY Temple setup: The aspirant will need to set up the Hall beforehand in accordance with the temple diagram.

A red lamp or candle is placed on the Eastern side of the altar. On the front of the altar should be a large diagram of the Flaming Sword and the Kerubim.

As in the previous ritual, all of the Elemental candles should be placed around the circumference of the room, with a white candle in the East. The lights on the pillars should be unshaded. Ritual preparations: As before, it is suggested that the aspirant fast for a period of 12 hours prior to the ritual. During this time the candidate should pre- pare a small piece of paper upon which is written a particular vice or failing that the aspirant wishes to be rid of. A ritual bath is required after which the aspirant may put on the black Tau robe and red slippers. The sash will need to be deco- rated with the Zelator designs, but it is not to be worn by the candidate at this time. 3O Place the sash inside the altar. Two diagrams will have to be on hand for the second part of the ritual. They are the Seven-branched Candlestick and the Table of Shewbread. (These diagrams can be found in the following pages of this chapter.) The aspirant must meditate for a certain length of time on a drawing of the symbol of Earth-an Earth triangle (apex downward) in black. Next s/he must spend a period of time (20-30 minutes) in a darkened room or antechamber to the temple seated in quiet meditation while wearing a hoodwink or blindfold.) The Admission Badge for the grade of Zelator, the Fylfot Cross, should be held in the right hand throughout this period. A small candle is to be the only source of light in the room. During this time, darkness and silence are to be maintained. The aspirant should imagine him/her self under the watch of Anubis of the West. After this period of time, the hoodwink may be removed. The aspirant may then enter the temple and begin the ritual. Upon entering the temple, imagine that you are leaving your physical body outside as a sentinel to guard the temple, so that your spiritual self has the freedom to accept initiation. 28 The Banner of the West is shown in the East to block the energies of the three Paths from entering into the temple. 29 Instructions on how to make this and the other Enochian Tablets are given in our book Secrets ofa Golden Dawn Temple. 30 The Aspirant should ornament his/her sash to reflect the Zelator grade. In our temple we have \"generic\" sashes that candidates may borrow (the Neophyte sash for the beginning of the Zelator grade, for example). At one point in the ritual the Neophyte sash is removed and the candidate is invested with his/her own newly embroidered Zelator sash. However, the solitary student can't afford to make different sashes for different grades. In this case the aspirant will have to forego wear- ing a sash at the beginning of the ceremony."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The Zelator Grade PART 0: The Opening 105 Enter the temple with the Admission Badge of the Fylfot Cross.

You have a vague impression of four figures in the East, seated before a veil. Thme continues to address the fig- ures, and the scene becomes hazy. It appears that the goddess stands not before the seated figures in the East, but once again before the gigantic form of Thoth- Djehoti-the ibis-headed god of Wisdom. Thme continues a silent discussion with the god. After a few moments Thme turns toward you, salutes with the Signs toward the West and says silently: Thou mayest proceed, 0 aspirant; thou art MAAT.

At the appropriate time in the ceremony, the officiating priest slays the ani- mal, and its blood is caught in basins by other attendant priests. The Altar of Burnt Offering The sight of the animal being slaughtered startles you-you are not accustomed to witnessing such archaic and bloody practices of worship. But you realize that what you are watching is some- thing that happened ages ago when everything concerning human existence was a struggle, and often a bloody one. You are secure in the knowledge that today, in your own time, such blood sacrifices are no longer essential to spiritual beliefs that the idea of sacrifice is a symbolic one that can entail the sacrifice of one's lower personal desires to higher goals. Prayers are recited continuously as the ox is cut into twelve pieces, all of which are placed upon the burning wood of the altar. The blood of the slain animal is sprinkled around the base of the brazen altar and smeared upon the four horns at the corners. The entire animal is consumed by the flames, as if sent to God on wings of fire. The flame burns continuously; never is it allowed to go out.

You then exchange the Grip of the grade with the officer/ godform. Thme nods as Anubis returns to his station. She speaks: Having made Offering at the brazen altar, having been cleansed at the Laver, and having passed the tests prescribed for thee, thou mayest enter the Holy Place. Take a step forward toward the altar. At this point return in your mind's eye to the guided visualization of the Courtyard of the Tabernacle in the Wilderness. Imag- ine the following: Past the Laver of Brass is the entrance to the Tabernacle. The struc- ture itself is a large and magnificent tent supported by boards of wood overlaid with gold and silver. Four successive coverings of curtains cover the sides of the Tabernacle. The three outer curtains are constructed from goats' hair, badger skins and red-dyed ram skins. The entrance into the sanctuary is composed of curtains hung from seven mighty pillars. In your mind's eye you enter the outer chamber of the Tabernacle known as the Holy Place. The inner curtain is a sensu- ous linen embroidered with the figures of the Kerubim in blue, vio- let and red. Surrounded on all sides by such rich decorations, you notice that to your left is a low table of bread, to your right is a large candelabrum, and in the center of the room is a golden altar, beyond which is a curtain of sumptuous cloth that veils the innermost Sanctuary, as yet con- cealed from you. The scent of Frankincense fills the room. The officer/ godform of the Hegemon takes you by the hand and leads you Northeast of the altar, where a diagram is located. In your mind's eye you picture an The Table of Shew-bread oblong golden table with legs.

In addition to the Sabbath bread, there are golden bowls, vessels of wine and two small censers of burning incense. 123 Thme brings your focus back to the diagram at hand. (See diagram page 196.) Examining it you say: To the Northern side of the Holy Place stood the Table of Shew-bread. The drawing before me represents its occult meaning. On it twelve loaves were laid as emblems of the Bread of Life, andit is an image of the Mystery of the Rose of Creation. The twelve circles are the twelve Signs ofthe Zodiac, while the lamp in the Center is symbolic of the Sun, which is the source of heat and life. The Four triangles whose twelve angles each touch one of the twelve cir- cles are those of Fire, Earth, Air,and Water, and allude to thefour Triplicities ofthe Zodiacal Signs. The triangle inscribed within each of the twelve circles, alludes to the three Decanates, or phases of ten degrees of each Sign. On one side of each triangle is the permutation of the Divine Name, Yod Heh Vav Heh, which is referred to that particular Sign, while on the opposite side of it is the name of oneof the Twelve Tribes which is also attributed to it. The twenty-two sounds and letters of the Hebrew alphabet are the foundation ofall things. Three Mothers, Seven Double and Twelve Simples. The Twelve Simple letters are allotted to the twelve directions in space, and those diverge to Infinity, and are in the arms of the Eternal. These Twelve letters He designed and combined, and formed with them the Twelve Celestial Constel- lations of the Zodiac. They are over the Universe as a King traversing his dominions, andthey are in the heart ofmanasa King in warfare. The Twelve loaves are the images of those ideas, and are the Outer Petals of the Rose, while within are the Four Archangels ruling over the Four Quarters, and the Kerubic emblems of the Lion, Man, Bull and Eagle. Aroundthe great central lamp which is an image of the Sun, is the Great Mother of Heaven, sym- bolized by the letter Heh, thefirst of the Simple Letters, and by its number five, the Pentagram, Malkah the Bride, ruling in her kingdom Malkuth, crowned with a crown of Twelve stars. The twelve circles further represent the twelve Foundations of theHolyCity of the Apocalypse, while in Christian symbolism the Sun and the twelve signs are referred to Christ and his Twelve Apostles.

Imagine the following: (In your mind's eye you return to the Holy Place where a large golden cande- labrum is located opposite the Table of Shewbread. The implement is huge, nearly six feet in height and almost as wide, weighing about one hundred pounds. Made of beaten gold, the candlestick is composed of a base with a shaft rising out of it, six arms which come out by threes on opposite sides of the shaft. The arms and the shaft are ornamented with seventy-two almond-shaped cups, apples and flower blossoms. Each of its seven lamps ends in a cup-shaped depression sup- plied with cotton and olive-oil, enough to burn through the night until moming.) The Hiereus brings your focus back to the diagram at hand. (See diagram on page 198.) Examining it you say: On the Southern side of the Holy Place stood the Seven-branched Candle- stick, wherein was burned pure olive oil. It is an image of theMystery of the Elohim, the Seven Creative Ideas. The symbolic drawing before me represents its occult meaning. The Seven circles which surround the Hep- tagram represent the Seven Planets and the Seven Qabalistic Palaces of Assiah, the Material. World-which answer to the Seven Apocalyptic churches which are in Asia or Assiah-as these again allude to the Seven lamps before the throne on another Plane. Within each circle is a triangle to represent the Threefold Creative Idea operating in all things. On the right-hand side of each is the Hebrew Name of the Angel who governs the Planet, on the left-hand side is the Hebrew Name of the sphere of the Planet itself, while the Hebrew letter beneath the base is one of the duplicated letters of the Hebrew alphabet which refer to the Seven Planets. The Seven Double Letters of the Hebrew alphabet each have two sounds associated with them, one hard and one soft. They are called \"Double\" because each letter represents a contrary or permutation: Life and Death, Peace and War, Wisdom and Folly, Riches and Poverty, Grace and Indig- nity, Fertility and Solitude, Power and Servitude. The Seven letters point out seven localities, Zenith, Nadir, East, West, North, South, andthe Place of Holiness in themidst sustaining all things.

You take up the censer from the altar and trace with it the symbol of the cross, and give three forward swings. Replace the censer. Continue the guided visualization of the Tabernacle. Imagine the following: In your mind's eye, return to the Holy Place in the Tabernacle, where you stand before a golden altar. This is the altar said to stand before Adonai in front of the Veilof the Most Holy Place. It is made of wood overlaid with pure gold and is in the shape of a double cube. Like the Altar of Burnt Offering, it has four horns at its cor- ners which are of one piece with the rest of the altar. It has a top or roof on which the incense is laid and lighted. The altar also has a cornice of gold and four golden rings to receive wooden staves for carrying it. The incense burned thereupon every morning and evening is a sacred composition of spices. The scent of the per- fumed smoke fills you with renewed vitality. The Altar of Incense (Say:) Before the Veil of the Holy of Holies, stood theAltar of Incense, of which this Altar is an Image.

See yourself in the Holy Place before the altar. Take the golden censer that you obtained at the Altar of Burnt Offering and pour out the coals and incense upon the golden altar. As you visualize this, perform the Qabalistic Cross. Then direct your attention to the Most Holy Place beyond the Altar of Incense. This is the Holy of Holies-the most sacred portion of the Tabernacle. It is separated from the Holy Place by a Veil which is always kept closed and shrouded in darkness. The Veil is made from fine linen, richly embroidered with blue, violet, and red, and ornamented with figures of the Kerubim. Not yet are you permitted to enter this most sacred chamber-this privilege is granted but once a year on the Day of Atonement to the High Priest who has passed through the mysteries by right of initiation. How- ever within your mind's eye, you are able to visualize the inner chamber, which contains only the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark is an oblong chest of wood inlaid with gold, with a golden miter around the top. The upper side or lid is a plate of pure gold comprising the Mercy Seat. Two golden Kerubim are placed at either end of the lid. These beings are composite creatures who assume a stooping position over the Ark, overshadowing and protecting it with their expanded wings. They are the Right-hand and Left-hand Kerubim of the Ark, Sandalphon and Metatron. Within the Ark itself are the Stone Tablets of the Law, and above the whole arrangement the Giorious Light of God is said to reside. .

Spatially, the houses are 30 degrees I-----:::~--l each, one-twelfth of the 360 degree circle. Whereas the Signs in a horoscope are fixed divisions of the heavens, the houses are rela- tive sections of the heavens which depend on the time and place of an individual's birth. The Earth's rotation causes the Planets and the Signs to pass daily through all of the twelve houses. The first house begins at 0 0 of the Ascendant. A house symbolizes a basic area of activity. The interpretation of the houses varies when they are inhabited by Planets.P Each house is ruled by one of the Planets and is influenced by one of the Zodiacal Signs. 32 Keep in mind that although a house may not always contain a planet, it does not mean that there is no activity in that region."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The Zelator Grade 131 The Sign that is on the Eastern horizon at the time of birth is called the Ris- ingSign or the Ascendant. Since the houses never alter their position, with respect to the Earth, the Ascendant or first house cusp is always on the Eastern horizon, where Sol rises daily. The Descendant or seventh house cusp is always on the West- ern horizon where Sol sets. The Midheaven (Latin: medium coeli), also called the MC, is the tenth house cusp at the top or Southern point of a Zodiacal chart. Opposite to this is the Ie (from Latin: imum coeli, the lowest heavens) or fourth house cusp at the lowest or Northernmost point on the chart. Cusp: A Cusp is an imaginary line which separates a Sign from adjoining Signs, and a house from its adjoining houses. It is a small arc in close proximity to the boundary line between neighboring Signs and houses, which causes uncer- tainty as to the Planet's location and influence at a particular moment. A Planet in a cusp between houses can be influenced by both houses (and Signs) affected by the cusp. A birth Planet is stronger in a cusp than in the later degrees of a house. Decanate or Decan: A ten degree arc or subdivision of the Zodiacal wheel. A house contains three decanates, which are called the first, second and third decan. There are a total of 36 decanates in a Zodiacal wheel. House Division by Element Since each house is ascribed to one of the twelve signs, the houses can be catego- rized in accordance to the ruling Element of the signs: FireHouses First, fifth and ninth houses. Individuals with several Planets in Fire houses are energetic, motivated, enthusiastic, spiritual and inspirational. Water Houses Fourth, eighth and twelfth houses. Individuals with several Planets in these houses are emotional, intuitive, and sensitive. Air Houses Third, seventh and eleventh houses. Individuals with several Planets in these houses are sociable, communicative, intelligent and interested in others. Earth Houses Second, sixth and tenth houses. Individuals with several Planets in these houses are stable, practical, and hardworking.

The later word relates to Khem the Coptic name of Egypt. Alchemy thus means \"that which pertains to Egypt.\" Thus the words Alchemy and chemistry are a reminder of the scientific legacy of Egypt. Another possible origin of the word is the Greek . cheo which means \"I pour' or \"] cast\": a word often used in refer- ence to the ancient Greek metalworkers who used many Alchemical formulae. Together, Alchemy and Astrology are two of the oldest sciences known to humanity. The specialized fields of herbalism, mineralogy, natural science, chem- istry and medicine all evolved from the mother science known as Alchemy. Legend has it that the god Hermes was the founder of Alchemy. The most significant early alchemical text was the Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus, also called the Tabula Smaragdina. No one is quite sure who the first alchemist was, although the first group to learn and work with the art were metalsmiths. Perhaps the best known of the alchemists was Paracelsus, who announced that the major goal of Alchemy should be to cure illness. He started what would later become the science of pharmacology. The outer body of Alchemy is chemistry. It is in fact the ancestor of modem chemistry. But in addition to being a science, this ancient art is also a philosophy. Alchemy is a science that is based upon multiplication and the natural phenomenon of growth-it is the process of increasing and improving that which already exists. Alchemy is evolution-the raising of vibrations. Practitioners of the art considered Nature to be the greatest alchemist of all, causing the latent seeds of all life to multiply and grow through the act of transmutation. One objective of the Alchemists was to carry out in the laboratory, as far as possible, the processes which Nature carries out in the Earth plane. Not only did they try to duplicate these natural operations, they tried to reproduce them in a comparatively short period of time-speeding up processes which Nature takes vast amounts of time to manifest. The basic tenets of Alchemy are as follows: 1. The universe has a divine origin. The cosmos is an ema- nation of One Absolute Divine Being. Therefore All is One."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The Zelator Grade 2. All physical manifestation exists by virtue of a Law of Polarity or Duality. Any concept can be sufficiently defined in relation to its opposite: male/female, sun/moon, spirit/ body, etc. 3. All physical manifestation, whether Vegetable, Animal or Mineral (the so-called Three Kingdoms), is composed of Spirit, Soul, and Body: the three Alchemic Principles. 4. All Alchemical work, whether practical laboratory work or spiritual Alchemy, consists of three basic evolutionary processes: Separation, Purification, and Cohobation (or recombination). These three evolutionary processes are also the work of Nature. 5. All matter is composed of the four Elements of Fire (ther- mal energy), Water (liquid), Air (gas), and Earth (solid). The knowledge and skillful use of the four Elements is an essential part of Alchemical work. 6. The Quintessence or Fifth Essence is contained with the four Elements but is not one of them. It is one of the Three Essential Principles, also called the Philosophic Mercury. 7. Everything moves towards its preordained state of perfection. 137 In its popular (limited) definition, Alchemy is an empirical science which concerns itself with the transmutation of base metals into gold. For many the word Alchemy conjures up an image of a crude laboratory where foolhardy pseudo-scientists labor to tum lead into gold so that they may spend their lives living in a state of luxury. However Alchemy's true definition encompasses the doctrine of the transformation of humanity to a higher stage. The treatises of Alchemy are not only chemical in nature, but also mystical and magical. Certainly many Alchemists left behind a vast amount of information to prove the fact that one version of Alchemy was primarily practical and chemical in nature. On the other hand, the principal interest of many Alchemical philosophers was spiritual. These Alchemists did not look merely for the substance of gold, they sought to give the quality of gold to their own being-to transmute the base metals (gross and impure parts of their own nature) to spiritual gold (wisdom). To them gold, the metal which never tarnishes and cannot be corrupted by Fire or Water, was a symbol of illumination and salvation. Alchemy is the Art and Scienceof transformation. This is not an easily under- stood art, because the primal medium of Alchemical expression is through the use of allegory and mythological symbols, which can be interpreted simultaneously both at a material and a spiritual level. The primary goal of Alchemy is to bring all things, including humanity, to its preordained state of perfection. To that end the Alchemi-"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"138 SELF-INl1'IATION IN10 lHE GoLDEN DAWN '!'RADmoN cal theory states that Eternal Wisdom remains latent, dormant and obscure in humanity so long as a mundane state of ignorance and superficiality exists. The objective of Alchemy is the uncovering of this Inner WISdom and the removal of the veils and obstacles between the mind and its intrinsically pure Divine Source. It is this spiritual Alchemy, as opposed to the purely chemical art, that the Golden Dawn stresses. The initiation of an aspiring magician into the Neophyte grade commences the spiritual Alchemical process. The Neophyte is the base mate- rial which is to be transmuted by the Work (or Art) of the Hermetic Path. Further initiations into the Elemental grades are analogous to the processes of separation and purification. Initiation into the Portal and Adept grades represents the cohoba- tion or recombination of the Elemental constituents of the magician's psyche into a purified whole. However, the process does not end there. The Adept must incorpo- rate the Quintessence into his/her being, an endeavor which may take a lifetime to achieve. This Great Work or quest for spiritual gold is a long undertaking. Although the goal may be distant, every step along the Path is infinitely rewarding. The stages of the philosophical process of alchemical transmutation are sym- bolized by four different colors: black (guilt, origin, latent forces) for \"Prime Mat- ter,\" a symbol of the Soul in its original condition, or the Elementary organization of inherent possibilities, white (minor work, first transmutation, quicksilver), red (sulfur, passion), and finally gold (spiritual purity). There are three fundamental substances in the science of Alchemy which exist in all things. The names and Alchemical symbols of these Three Principles (Tria Principia) of Nature are: 8 Sulfur Mercury Salt These substances are not to be confused with ordinary substances of the same name. This triad of Principles may be considered as an undivided whole. However, this unified state exists only before the purification of the Alchemical art (the process of learning), one intention of which is to differentiate between these principles and their homogeneous base. The three components are then purified through the art and recombined into a more exalted whole. The Principle of Sulfur (Coptic-Then, Greek-Theion, Latin-Sulfur) This is the dynamic, expansive, volatile, acidic, unifying, masculine, paternal, and fiery principle. Sulfur is the emotional, feeling and passionate urge which motivates life. It is symbolic of the desire for positive change and of vital heat. The entire act of transmutation depends upon the correct application of this vibrant principle.Fire is the crucial Element in the science of Alchemy. Sulfur is the essential Soul. In practical Alchemy, Sulfur is usually extracted from Mercury by distilla- tion. Sulfur is the stabilizing aspect of Mercury, from which it is extracted and dis- solved back into."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The Zelaior Grade 139 In mystical Alchemy, Sulfur is the crystallizing aspect of the inspiration commenced by Mercury. The Principle of Salt (Coptic-Hemou, Greek-Hals, Latin-Sal) This is the principle of substance or form, conceived of as a heavy, inert mineral body that is part of the nature of all metals. It is the hardening, fixed, contractive tendency, as well as crystallization. Salt refers to the vehicle in which the properties of Sulfur and Mercury are grounded. Salt is the essential corpus or Body. It is sometimes referred to as Earth. The Principle 0/ Mercury (Coptic-Thrim, Greek-Hydrargos, Latin-Mercurius) It is sometimes called Quicksilver. This is a watery, feminine principle that relates to the concept of con- sciousness. Mercury is the universal Spirit or vital Lifeforce that permeates all liv- ing matter. This fluid and creative principle is symbolic of the act of transmutation-it is the transforming agent of the Alchemical process. Mercury is the essential Spirit, the most important of the Three Principles, which mediates between the other two, modifying their extreme tendencies. In practical Alchemy,Mercury has two states, both of which are liquid. The first (volatile) state is prior to the removal of Sulfur. The second (fixed) state is after the Sulfur has been returned. This final and stabilized state is sometimes referred to as the Secret Fire or Prepared Mercury. The Alchemical Elements Primus- TERRA: The First Element of Earth. Life-essence.

The former sees metals as living things equal to animals and vegetables. And like all things in nature, they undergo natural evolution of birth, growth and increase. Met- als contain their own \"seed\" for further growth. Under different conditions, this seed can be transformed, but only through nature. That is why in many Alchemical trea- tises, the practitioner is told time and time again to let the work of transformation proceed at various stages naturally, \"without the laying on of hands.\"(X Alchemical Terms and Symbols ACETUM PHILOSOPHORUM: A synonym for \"virgin's milk,\" Philosophic Mercury, or \"Secret Fire.\" ADAM: The archetypal man.

They are the Ii \\7 invisible counterparts of visible Nature, or the spiritual essence of V the Elements. Whereas humans, Angels, Archangels and higher V spiritual beings have composite natures, Elementals are composed of only one etheric essence. In the spiritual realms, Elementals occupy a place between human beings and higher entities such as Angels and Archangels.v The Four Orders of the Elementals are: 1. Gnomes-The Spirits of Earth 2. Sylphs-The Spirits of Air 3. Undines- The Spirits of Water 4. Salamanders-The Spirits of Fire These four Orders are the essential spiritual beings called upon to praise God in the Benedicite Omnia Opera(literal translation: \"Blessed are his Works.\")36 GNOMES: The name of these beings is derived from the Greek word genomos, meaning \"Earth dweller.\" The gnomes work in an Element so close in vibra- tion to the physical Earth that they have immense power over the rocks and vegeta- tion, as well as the mineral Elements in the bodily makeup of humans and animals. They work with the stones, gems and metals and are said to be the guardians of hid- den treasures. Various mythic traditions have depicted several types of Gnomes such as satyrs, brownies, elves and dryads. Gnomes are supposed to be patient and hard- working, but can be malicious and difficult. Because of their Earth nature, they are assigned to the North. The King of the Gnomes is called Ghob. 37 SYLPHS: These beings dwell not in the physical atmosphere, but in the incorporeal spiritual substance which is similar to the Earth's atmosphere, although far more subtle. They are the highest group of Elementals because their Element has the highest vibrational rate. The wind and clouds are said to be their vehicle. Mythol- ogy usually depicts them as winged fayes or fairies. The Air Spirits are erratic, changeable creatures that move with the speed of lightning. They work through the ethers and gases of the Earth and indirectly with the human nervous system. Sylphs are beneficent, mirthful and inspirational to humans, especially artists and poets. They are assigned to the Eastern quarter. The King of the Sylphs, called Paralda, is said to dwell in the clouds surmounting the highest mountain peak. UNDINES: These entities function in the incorporeal spiritual essence called humid or liquid ether. The vibratory rate of this substance is close to that of the Element of Water. Thus the Undines are able to control and manipulate the flow of Water in Nature. They also work with the vital fluids it). plants, animals and humans. In mythology, Undines are given various forms, such as Water 35 The Greeks assigned the name daimon or \"spirit\" to some of these beings. The Church lumped all elemental entities together under a corruption of this word, demon, which carries with it an evil con- notation. This is an injustice, since Nature spirits are essentially no more malicious than are plants, animals and rocks. 36 This is a reference to a passage from the Book of Revelation. 37 In Medieval times, the subjects of Ghob were called Goblins."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"The Zelator Grade 149 nymphs, Water sprites, mermaids and nereids, They are said to be vital, graceful and generally beneficent to humans. The Queen of the Water spirits is called Nichsa. These beings are assigned to the Western quarter of creation. SALAMANDERS: The strongest and most powerful of the Elementals, the Salamanders live in that spiritual ether which is the invisible Fire of Nature. Physical Fire and warmth cannot exist without them. The Salamanders work through the emotional nature of humans and animals by means of the blood- stream and body heat. They also exert influence over all fiery-tempered beings. They are said to be the most difficult of all Elementals to communicate with, owing to the incineratory nature of their Element. However the smoke of burning incense is a medium for their expression. Salamanders vary in size and appear- ance, from fiery balls or tongues of flame to mythological armored figures and fiery lizard-like creatures. In temperament they are dangerous and unpredictable. Their mighty King is an awe-inspiring flaming Spirit known as Djin. The Sala- manders are assigned to the Southern quarter of creation. x) SECTION 4: Tetragrammaton and the Kerubim ~ Tetragrammaton is a Greek word that means \"Four-Lettered M , M Name.\" This alludes to the unknowable and unpronounceable name of God symbolized by the Hebrew letters Yod Heh Vav , , Heh.38 Each of these four letters is assigned to one of the four . Elements of Nature: Yod-Fire, Heh-Water, Vav-Air, and Heh final [or Heh Sophith ]-Earth. These letters portray the balance inherent to the Qabalistic system, for Yod- Fire and Vav-Air are masculine, positive energies, while Heh-Water and Heh Final- Earth are feminineand negative potencies. The Tetragrammaton is the cornerstone of the fourfold model of the manifest universe. It indicates that the Divine is a uni- fied whole which contains within itself all opposites in balanced disposition. Leg- end has it that the proper understanding and pronunciation of this Supreme Name of God are the Keys to divine power. The Kerubim, \"the Strong Ones,\" are the living Powers of Tetragrammaton on the Material Plane and the Presidents of the four Elements.

The Three Mother Letters are Aleph, Mem and Shin. These three letters are a trinity from which everything in the manifest universe arises. Aleph, Mem and Shin represent the ancient Elements of Air, Water, and Fire. Mem (Water) and Shin (Fire) are opposing forces while Aleph (Air) is the mediator and balancing force between them. The Seven Double Letters are Beth, Gimel, Daleth, Kaph, Peh, Resh, Tau. The Seven Double Letters are called double because they each have a hard and a soft sound associated with them, in addition to a dual set of qualities attributed. Dif- ferent sources attribute the following qualties to the Double Letters: Beth-Wisdom and Folly Gimel-Grace and Indignation Daleth-Fertility and Solitude Kaph-Life and Death Peh-Power and Servitude Resh-Peace and War Tau-Riches and Poverty Beth-Life and Death Gimel-Peace and War Daleth-Wisdom and Folly Kaph-Riches and Poverty Peh-Grace and Indignation Resh-Fertility and Solitude Tau-Power and Servitude The Seven Double Letters represent the seven Planets of the ancients, the seven days of creation, seven orifices of perception in human beings, and seven directions in space. The Twelve Simple (or Single) Letters: Heh, Vav, Zayin, Cheth, Teth, Yod, Lamed, Nun, Samekh, Ayin, Tzaddi, Qoph. The Twelve Simple Letters refer to the twelve Signs of the Zodiac, the twelve months of the year, and the twelve organs of a human being. The Twelve Simples are the foundations of twelve human properties: Heh-Sight Vav-Hearing Zayin-Smell Cheth-Speech Teth-Taste Yod-Sexual Love Lamed-Work Nun-Movement Samekh-Anger Ayin-Mirth Tzaddi-Imagination Qoph-Sleep The Holy Place or Tabernacle as described in the Zelator Hall embraces the symbolism of the Twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet: The Table of Shew- bread represents the Twelve Single Letters.

Each of these worlds envelops its predecessor like the layers of an onion, the highest spiritual world at the center is progressively veiled from the lowest world that forms the outer layer. In addition to this, each Qabalistic \"World\" is symbolized by one of the Hebrew letters of the Tetragrammaton, which once again reinforces the concept of the fourfold model of the universe. The Four Worlds of the Qabalah are: Atziluth: The Divine or Archetypal World (Dlam Atziluth) Briah: The Archangelic or Creative World (Dlam ha-Briah) Yetzirah: The Angelic or Formative World (Dlam ha- Yetzirah) Assiah: The Material World or World of Action (Dlam ha-Assiah) ATZILUTH (l\"'''~~M) is the first and highest of the Four Worlds and is attributed to Yod, the first letter of Tetragrammaton. It is the World of pure deity and the domain of Primordial Fire. This world gave birth to the other three worlds, in a descending scale of Light. Some traditions assign it to the three Sephi- roth of Kether, Chokmah, and Binah, while others ascribe to it only the sphere of Kether. (See the diagram.) For the purposes of this book, we will define Atziluth as containing only the first Sephirah. The so-called Secret Name of the World of Atziluth is Aub, which refers to \"density, thicket, darkness and cloud.\" BRIAH (nM~'~) is the second World, the World of Creation. The second let- ter of Tetragrammaton, Heh, is ascribed to this World, marking it as the domain of Primordial Water. The Element of Water represents the fluid, inventive Mind, thus Briah is described as the World of Pure Intellect. It is known as the abode of the Archangels.

The Secret Name of the Second World is Seg. YETZIRAH (M'~~~) is the third World or World of Formation. It is the abode of various orders of Angels. The third letter of Tetragrammaton, Vav, is assigned here, making Yetzirah the realm of Primordial Air. This world is approx- imate to the astral plane because the etheric framework behind the physical uni- verse is found here. Some schools of thought assign only Netzach, Hod, and Yesod to this world, but here we will subscribe to the theory that places seven of the spheres from Chesed to Yesod in the Yetziratic World. The Secret Name of this Realm is Mah, which relates to the words\" anything\" or \"something.\" ASSIAH (M~tu~) is the fourth and final World, the World of Action, con- sisting only of Malkuth.\" The final letter, Heh, of Tetragrammaton is ascribed to Assiah, which is also the World of Primordial Earth. In Assiah the four Elements which make up the physical universe exist both in sensation and in the hidden properties of matter. This is the corporeal World where tangible activity can take place. It is the realm of matter and of humanity, yet it is also the world of \"shells,\" made up of the denser Elements of the preceding three worlds. In addition, Assiah is the abode of evil demons, known to the Qabalists as the Qlippoth. The Secret Name of Assiah is Ben, which means \"Son.\" The Ten Heavens or Houses of Assiah The Active and Material World of Assiah, the fourth and most manifest of the Qabal- istic Worlds, has assigned to it the names of the heavenly spheres, which include the seven Planets of the ancients. These \"Heavens\" are physical manifestations attrib- uted to each Sephirah. Some authors have termed these heavenly spheres \"the ten mundane Chakras,\" likening these centers of manifestation to centers of energy that exist within the human body in Eastern mystical traditions. The Ten Heavens imply that each of the ten Sephiroth has some resemblance to the Divine Essence behind certain Planets or astronomical forces. 39 The name\" Asia\" has associations with this World."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"The Zelator Grade The Ten Heavens of Assiah are: 1.

The Briatic Title is the name of an Archangel who organizes the forces intrin- sic to a specific Sephirah and the direction of the activating forces that come under its authority. Archangels are actual beings without physical form, although repre- sentations of them in art come from the inventions of the human mind, which needs anthropomorphic images in order to enhance understanding. The true form of an Archangel would be similar to a great pillar of energy or a geometric shape that con- curs with the individual Sephirah. The Yetziratic Title is the name of a group of Angels who are responsible for the actual mechanics or workings of a Sephirah. In magic these divisions can be likened to an army; at the top is the Com- mander-in-Chief, who holds a Divine (Atziluth) title. Under him is a general known as an Archangel (Briah) who commands various legions. These legions are made up of numerous footsoldiers known as Angels (Yetzirah). (Note: In the Golden Dawn's system of magic, if you want something done, you go straight to the top and petition the Divine or Atziluthic Name and work your way down the Hierarchy from there. The Highest must always be invoked first.) Divine Names: EHEIEH (n~nH): The deity name of Kether which means \"1 am.\" This name indi- cates the inhaling and exhaling of the breath, alluding to the idea that Kether is the root from which all begins and to which all returns. The letters of the name, Aleph Heh Yod Heh yield further meanings; Aleph indicates the beginning or initial out- pouring of force, Heh is the stabilizing factor or receptacle, Yod symbolizes the fer- tilizing principle, and the final Heh is the stabilizing factor and resulting manifes- tation. The whole word thus encompasses the idea of increasing manifestation. It is the first and the last-the heart of everything-the first living breath of God and the last breath of Being. 41 This part of the Knowledge Lecture was originally divided up and taught in the grades of Theo- ricus and Practicus. Today the Ord,er includes this information (and the following section on the Planetary hierarchies) 'in the Zelator grade. In our own temple, we have divided these lists up- having parts of them distributed among the Knowledge Lectures of other grades: Zelator-Atzi- luthic (Divine) Names, Theoricus-Briatic (Archangelic) Names, and Practicus-Yetziratic (Angelic Choir) names. We have found that students take more easily to this approach; retaining the memo- rized names better, due to the fact that they automatically review the previous information con- cerning the Hierarchies for each new Knowledge Lecture. The reader of this book is free to choose whichever one of these approaches best suits his/her ability to learn the material, so long as in the end the list is committed to memory. 42 Regardie suggested that the student draw several Trees of Life and place upon them the Divine Names in their proper order."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"156 SELF-INITIATION IN10 THE GoWEN DAWN TRADITION YAH: (M~) The deity name of Chokmah which means \"The Lord.\" It is half of the Tetragrammaton, although some authors ascribe the full Name YHVH to this Sephirah. (YHVH signifies the idea \"to be.\") The name Yah implies explosive mas- culine power and fertilizing force (Yod). It is the great initiator of all action. YHVH ELOHIM (Cl~M~M M'M~): The deity name of Binah which has been translated as \"The Lord God.\" However the word \"Elohim\" is a feminine noun (EIoh) with a masculine plural ending, implying a dual polarity of masculine and feminine. Since YHVH can be considered the action of the Divine in the Four Qabalistic Worlds, then YHVH Elohim presents the idea of the polarity principle (the perfect balance of masculine and feminine operating on all planes of existence) as the foundation of all form. EL (or AL) &M): The deity name of Chesed which means simply \"God,\" but also implies The DivineOne or The Mighty One. Whereas the name of Ya represented the primal masculine force of God, EI refers to the primal feminine aspect of the deity» The name is composed of the letters Aleph and Lamed, whose letters mean respectively \"Ox\" and \"Ox-goad,\" alluding to the idea of the primal motivating force under control. As the deity name of the first Sephirah below the Abyss, Al is the divine giver or benefactor of humanity, supplying us with the potential for the attainment of Divinity. ELOHIM GIBOR (\"~~ Cl~M~M): The deity name of Geburah which can be trans- lated as \"God of Battles\" or as \"Almighty God.\" This denotes that nothing can escape the might of the Divine and universal law. The essence of Elohim Gibor is Judgment that places the end before the means, striking quickly at the heart of a problem, even when the cure may be as harsh as the illness. YHVH ELOAH VE-DAATH O.,~\" m~M mM~): The deity name of Tiphareth which means \"Lord God of Knowledge\" but which might also be interpreted as \"God made Manifest in the Sphere of the Mind.\" Once again we have the com- bined title of YHVH Eloah, indicating a perfect balance of masculine and feminine polarities. In addition, we have the idea that knowledge is power. YHVH Eloah ve- Daath is the Divine Mind within us that comprehends its own Divinity. In modem terms, it is the Universal Mind-that Mind which encompasses all minds. YHVH TZABAOTH (l\"'M~~ mM~): The deity name of Netzach which means \"Lord of Hosts\" (armies). This indicates the diffusing aspect of the sphere, which divides and distributes the Light from Tiphareth prismatically into the many splendid aspects of the lower worlds. As before, YHVH can be considered the action of the Divine in the Four Qabalistic Worlds. In addition to this YHVH Tzabaoth is the male- positive divine aspect of every living Soul. ELOHIM TZABAOTH (l\"'M~~ Cl~M~M): The deity name of Hod which means \"God of Hosts.\" This name is similar to the deity name of Netzach. ELOHIM introduces the idea of polarity (balanced masculine and feminine principles). In Netzach, the \"Hosts\" are the many forces of the lower worlds, while in Hod they"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"The Zelator Grade 157 are the many forms which serve to house these forces. Elohim Tzabaoth is the female negative divine aspect of every living Soul. SHADDAI EL CHAI (~n ,ac ~'W): The deity name of Yesod which means \"Almighty Living God.\" This also indicates the Supreme Lord of Life and of Lives. In this case, the \"Life Power\" is to be seen not only as a spiritual essence, but specifically as the driving force behind reproduction and regeneration. Shaddai EI Chai is the God-aspect which is concerned with Life as a continuation of Itself. ADONAI HA ARETZ (r,acn ~~,ac): The deity name of Malkuth which means \"The Lord of Earth.\" This signifies that, in Malkuth, we confront the Creator of all Matter as the Supreme Ruler thereof. Like Eheieh, EI and YHVH, the name Adonai (\"Lord\") is considered a holy emanation of God. Therefore Malkuth is every bit as exalted as Kether, for both are holy aspects of the Divine. An additional deity name of Malkuth is Adonai Melekh, \"The Lord and King,\" which stresses these same ideas. Archangelic N ames;43 METATRON (f\"tQtQC): The Archangel of Kether. His Hebrew name has no clear etymological base and may in fact be a \"channeled\" name. The root word, met, may indicate downward (communicated) movement. Some authors have tried to pro- vide a Greek etymology for it-and have translated the name as meta ton thronos or \"near Thy throne.\" He is described as the Angel of the Presence and the World- Prince. Metatron alone sees the Eternal One face to face. He presides over the whole Tree of Life as well as Kether, and is considered the right-hand masculine Kerub of the Ark. Tradition has it that Metatron communicated the Qabalah to humankind. He has the additional titles of Metatron Ketheriel, The Lesser YHVH,the King of Angels, the Great Scribe, and the name JOEL-\"I am God.\" Some Hebraic sources identify the patriarch Enoch with this Archangel. Metatron is responsible for presenting God and Human being to each other. He is the link between the human and the Divine, and is responsible for increasing the flow of Light to the ini- tiate. His symbols include a crown, a lamp, and a white rose. RAZIEL <,ac~,,): The Archangel of Chokmah. His name in Hebrew means \"the Herald or Sent Forth One of God.\" This denotes the Archangel as an envoy with a specific mission. The root word of his name, raz, indicates the secrets of Initiates- everything which is secret, mysterious or concealed. He is known as Raziel Chok- mael, Ophaniel (as ruler of the Angelic host known as Ophanim), Secret of God, and Angel of Mysteries. It has been stated that Raziel is \"the Angel of the secret regions and chief of the supreme mysteries.\" Raziel is the personification of the Divine Wis- dom. The sapphire Book of Raziel, said to have been given to Adam and passed on to the great Hebrew teachers (including Solomon), was a book which held the secrets of the stars: the Zodiacal Signs, the courses of the Planets, and the effects they have on every aspect of Creation. (The prophet Enoch was said to come into 43 Some of the material in this section is derived from the article, \"This Holy Invisible Companion- ship: Angels in the Hermetic Qabalah of the Golden Dawn\" by Adam P.

Raziel's duty is to make Wisdom available to all who are able to hear it .. Raziel, as the teacher of Wisdom, stands atop the white pillar, sometimes envisioned as the Holy Mountain, proclaiming the secrets of the world in a great reverberating voice. He is the Archangel of creative force and energy. His symbols include a key, a book or scroll, an eye, and a lamp. TZAPHQIEL <,M'i'~~): The Archangel of Binah. Her name means \"Beholder of God\" or \"the contemplation of God.\" Additional titles include Binael and Tzaphqiel Erelel (as the leader of the Angels known as the Erelim). She is the Eye of God, watch- ing and observing, through which the Divine knows and sees all. Tzaphqiel governs meditation and contemplation. She is the Archangel of the archetypal temple, and is behind the formation of all mystical groups that have emanated fromwhat is some- times referred to as \"the Great White Lodge.\"44 The root word of her name, tzaph, indicates the overflowing of water. Tzaphqiel is also the Archangel of Primal Mani- festation. Her symbols include an hourglass, a sickle, and a book. TZADQIEL <,M'i\"~): The Archangel of Chesed. His name means \"Righteousness of God.\" This indicates a rightness by justification after the application of tests and tribulations. It implies one whose essence is essentially correct. The root word of this name, tzad, indicates the action of setting snares and hindrances (in order to test). Tzadqiel's duty is to direct everything to its best possible state of being, to make things perfect in order to assure that the ascent to the Divine is possible. Additional titles include Tzadqiel Gedulael and TzadqielChashmadel (as the leader of the Angels known as Chashmalim). He is the Angel of benevolence, abundance, joy, mercy, and memory. His symbols include the rod or staff of guidance, a shepherd crook and an orb. KHAMAEL <,M~~): The Archangel of Geburah. His name means \"the Severity of God.\"45 Khamael is the protector of the wronged, and also the Avenging Angel who pursues those who break both human and universal laws. He is associated with divine justice and severity. Khamael is sometimes called \"The right hand of God\" -meting out justice in order to restore a state of balance throughout the Tree of Life. He controls the aspects of burning and destroying in order to purify and 44 Also referred to as the \"Inner Council of Masters\" or \"Secret Chiefs:' These are human beings who are said to have evolved spiritually beyond the need for physical bodies. They remain in the Earth plane to teach younger, less evolved initiates through direct inner communication. 45 William Gray erroneously stated that the root of this name was khab, which meant to suffer, to feel pain or make war. However, prominent Golden Dawn scholar Adam P. Forrest has pieced together the true origin of this name. According to Forrest, the original Archangel of Mars was Samael-a name that MacGregor Mathers changed to Zamael in order to avoid confusion with the Qliphotic Samael. When the Qabalists began to assign Archangels to the Sephiroth, someone attributed a list of Planetary Archangels to their corresponding Sephiroth, and the martial Samael was naturally assigned to Geburah. At some point this list was copied into Greek. In late Greek writing, the letter Sigma (the first letter in Samael) came to be drawn in the shape of a \"C:' Still later, when the Greek list was copied into Latin, the copyist made the error of transliterating the Greek name of CAMAHL as \"Camael\" rather than \"Samael,\" Even later, someone (perhaps a member of the Golden Dawn) back-transliterated Camael as ~M~~ and thus was Khamael born. And although it originated as an error in transliteration, it does help magicians distinguish between Samael, Archangel of Evil, Zamael, Archangel of Mars, and Khamael, Archangel of Geburah."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"The Zelator Grade 159 preserve. Khamael can be likened to a doctor who makes the necessary decision to cut off an infected limb in order to save the patient. Additional titles include Khamael Gevurael and Khamael Seraphiel (as the leader of the Seraphim). His symbols include a sword, a spear, a scourge and a shield. RAPHAEL <,HI'): The Archangel of Tiphareth.w His name means \"Healer of God,\" or \"God has healed.\" Raphael Tipharethel is the Archangel specially appointed to heal the wounds (both physical and spiritual) of humankind. The root word of his name, raph, indicates medicine and healing as well as every kind of mediation, recovery and redemption. He is the Archangel attributed to the powers of the Divine Intellect as well as to the powers of love and self-esteem. Raphael is a teacher of the Hermetic Arts, thus pointing to his association with Tiphareth, the sphere whose deity name is \"Lord God of Knowledge.\" An addi- tional title is Raphael Melakhiel (as leader of the Melakhim). His symbols include the Caduceus of Hermes, an orb, a book or a seven-branched menorah. HANIEL <,H~~H\"): The Archangel of Netzach. Her name means \"the glory or grace of God\" or \"one who sees God.\" Haniel brings an awareness of harmony and beauty into the lower worlds. She provides us with the opportunity to become aware of the Divine through feeling, emotion and the arts. It is her duty to give humanity a greater understanding of the interrelationships of all created things in the universe. Additional titles include Haniel Netzachel and Haniel Elo- hel (as leader of the Angels known as Elohim). (Her name has sometimes been misspelled as Hamiel.) The root word of her name, ha, indicates every evident, demonstrated and determined existence. Her symbols include a red rose, a mir- ror, a torch, a dove, a unicorn or a chalice. MICHAEL (or MIKHAEL) <,H'=~=): The Archangel of Hod. His name means \"The Perfect of God\" or \"He who is like unto God.\" Mikhael Hodael helps to reveal the marvelous complexity of the universe. His duty is to engage the rational mind and powers of analysis. An additional title is Mikhael Beniel (as the leader of the Beni Elohim.) The root word of his name, mi, indicates water. His symbols include a book, a caduceus, or a staff, a lyre and an abacus. GABRIEL: <,H~''=~) The Archangel of Yesod. Her name means \"The Strong One of God\" or \"the Strength of God.\" She is the Archangel of the Annunciation and the Resurrection. Gabriel is the divine messenger who relays information between the Divine and humanity. She gives us the powers of vision, hearing, and psychic abilities, as well as the powers of life, procreation and equilibration. Additional 46 Some authors place Michael in Tiphareth and Raphael in Hod. Their reasoning for doing so is that in the Planetary Hierarchy of Angels, Michael is associated with Sol. However Israel Regardie stressed that Golden Dawn students should not confuse the Sephirotic, Planetary, and Elemental Hierarchies. Tiphareth (and not Hod) is the sphere of healing, and thus in the Sephirotic hierarchy Raphael is correctly associated with Tiphareth. Also, different Angels, like different people, can have the same name. Therefore Raphael of Tiphareth (Raphael Tipharethel) will have duties, colors, and symbols which are different from those of either Raphael of Mercury (Raphael Kokabiel) or Raphael of Air (Raphael Ruachel)."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"160 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GOLDEN DAWN TRADITION titles include Gabriel Yesodel and Gabriel Kerubiel (as the leader of the Kerubim). The root word of her name, gab, indicates the idea of something placed or coming under another thing-something which is convex. Her symbols include a skrying crystal, a magic mirror, an orb or a lamp. SANDALPHON (r'Il~'~CI): The Archangel of Malkuth. Her Hebrew name has no clear etymological base and may in fact be a \"channeled\" name. The root word, san, may indicate something which is luminous. Some authors have tried to pro- vide a Greek etymology for it-and have translated the name variously as \"co- brother,\" \"Lord of the extent of Height\" or \"the sound of sandals.\" An additional title is Sandalphon Malkuthael. Sandalphon is the twin of Metatron, and is in fact considered another form of Metatron. This points to the idea that Malkuth is the same as Kether, but after another manner. Sandalphon is the Archangel of the Earth sphere and the left-hand feminine Kerub of the Ark. Her duty is to mediate and sort out material energies which are to be brought forth into physical mani- festation. She also conveys the power and beauty of the natural world to the Souls of humanity. Her symbols include a monolith, a stone circle, a hom of plenty and a crown of grape leaves. Angelic Names: CHAYOTH HA-QODESH (t:'i'M lWM): The group of Angels assigned to Kether. The name means \"Holy Living Creatures.\" These are the only entities able to live in pure holiness next to the throne of the Eternal. They are the powers of the Eter- nal Elements whose duty is to uphold the universe and to create the primal matrix upon which the rest of existence is built. They help keep the focus of the initiate at all times on the Highest by increasing the flow of Light through the magician. OPHANIM (C~~Il'N): The group of Angels assigned to Chokmah. The name means \"the Wheels.\" (This is derived from the root word oph, which means to surround or encircle.) The Ophanim are also known as the \"many-eyed ones\" and are sometimes called the Galgalim or \"spheres.\" They are the wheels of the Merkabah or throne of God, and are sometimes pictured as wheels with spokes and wings. Their duty is to direct the flow of the divine force into form, thus keeping the cycles of manifestation in constant motion. They provide constant energy and motivation in magical work, and also aid in the manifestation of the divine masculine. ERELIM (C~~N'N): The group of Angels assigned to Binah. The name means \"the thrones.\" A throne is a seat of power, and in this case it indicates a focal point from which the divine power can effectively operate. The duty of the Erelim is to stabi- lize and provide support for the divine energy. They provide form and structure in magical work and are especially associated with the work of magical orders. In addition, they aid in the manifestation of the divine feminine. CHASHMALIM (C~~Qt:\"): The group of Angels assigned to Chesed. The name means \"The Shining Ones\" or \"the Brilliant Ones.\" They are fiery entities who bond the various parts of the cosmos together as a unified whole. The Chash- malim are sometimes referred to in certain texts as \"the Dominations,\" and they also provide humanity with abundance, joy and the power of laughter."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"The Zelator Grade 161 SERAPHIM (C~J:l't:t): The group of Angels assigned to Geburah. The name means \"Flaming Ones\" and is derived from the root word seraph, which means to bum by fire. In certain texts the Seraphim are also known as \"Fiery Serpents\" or \"the Powers.\" They are often pictured as winged serpents, or beings with six wings and many eyes. It is their duty to bring the principle of heat into the action of cre- ation. They are the Angels of the purifying fire who bum away all that is not wor- thy of the Divine. The Seraphim provide focus in magical work through disci- pline, dedication and purification. MELEKIM (C~~'C): The group of Angels assigned to Tiphareth. The name means \"the Kings,\" or \"the Messengers.\" Certain texts refer to these Angels as \"the Virtues.\" The Melekim are healing and life-giving entities. It is their duty to provide points of balance and stability amid the continuously evolving process of manifestation. They facilitate self-knowledge and self-understanding within the initiate. ELOHIM (C~n'M): The group of Angels assigned to Netzach. The name means simply \"the gods.\" Some texts refer to them as \"the Principles.\" The duty of these Angels is to provide stimulus (god-images, god-myths, or spiritual feelings) by which humanity can be made conscious of the Divine and be able to identify with it on a personal level. They engage the intuitive mind of the initiate in the Great Work and reveal the divine simplicity of the universe. BENI ELOHIM (C~n'M ~~,:): The group of Angels assigned to Hod. The name means \"Sons of the gods\" or \"Children of the gods.\" The Beni Elohim can be likened to polarized (masculine and feminine) units of divine consciousness which provide human intelligence and \"god-awareness\" in every individual. They are the stimulus that drives human beings in the search for knowledge. (The Elohim and Beni Elohim can be considered as the Force and Form aspects of all the numerous images of the gods created in the mind of humanity.) The Beni Elohim engage the rational mind of the initiate in the Great Work, and reveal the divine complexity of the universe. KERUBIM (C~':)\"~): The group of Angels assigned to Yesod. The name means \"the Strong Ones\" and is derived from the Akkadian word karibu which means \"one who prays\" or \"one who intercedes.\" The Kerubim are the great formative powers of the Elements that are stationed in the sphere of Yesod, the etheric blue- print which supports the physical universe. As supporters of the universe, they can be considered reflections of the Holy Living Creatures in Kether. Their duty is to govern interaction between the inner and outer worlds and to serve as guardians of the portal between the worlds. They act as guides, heralds, or as agents of equilibration. The Kerubim are often pictured as winged humanoids with animal heads, or as sphinxes. ASHIM (or ISHIM) (C~t:tM): The group of Angels assigned to Malkuth. The name means \"Souls of Fire.\" Said to be composed of snow and fire, these Angels are the forces which hold the atomic particles of physical matter together.

Attributed to each of the Planets is an Archangelic name, an Intelligence name and a Spirit name. The workings of the Planetary hierarchies are somewhat similar to those of the Sephiroth: a Planetary Archangel governs a Planetary force in a simi- lar fashion to a Sephirotic Archangel. Of the Intelligences and Spirits, tradition has it that the Spirits are evil and the Intelligences good. What this actually denotes, however, is that the Spirits of the Planets are blind forces in their most primal state. The Spirits of the Planets can be used for beneficial purposes, but they must always be employed in conjunction with, and under the presidency of their imme- diate superiors, the Intelligences, which serve to direct the blind and powerful Spirit forces in their operations. (Note: many of the Planetary names, especially those of the Intelligences and Spirits, were specially created to add up to the sum of all the numbers on a given magical square or Qamea. Analysis of these names, however, still provides unique insights into the Planetary energies they represent.) The Archangelic Names: KASSIEL <,N~O=): The Archangel of Saturn. Ruler of Saturday. Said to be the Archangel of solitudes and tears who \"shows forth the unity of the eternal king- dom.\" Kassiel is sometimes called an Angel of Temperance, and his name means \"Speed of God.\" Kassiel can be envisioned in robes of either black or blue-violet (indigo) ornamented with the symbol of Saturn and holding a scythe or an hour- glass.

Earth symbolizes the stable, grounded part of the psyche. It is the Element of corporeal nature and physical manifestation. Earth is feminine, receptive, solid, and nurturing. The color given for Earth is black, the cardinal point is North. (Review all information on the Element of Earth given in Chapter One.) The study of gemstones and minerals is some of the work to be under- taken by the Zelator. Stones were very useful to the ancients, serving as weapons, structural fortifications, markers, monuments, talismans, and even as necessary implements for creating fire. The early philosophers taught that the four Elements were present in the physiology of the human body; Fire corresponded to body heat, Water to the various body fluids, Air to the gases, and Earth to bones and flesh. Thus the stones and rocks themselves were symbolic of the bones of the gods in archaic worship. Stone worship, practiced all over the world, was probably the earliest type of religious expression known to humanity. The great monoliths erected by the ancients were venerated because of their agelessness and ability to resist the forces of decay and destruction that so plagued biological beings. These stones symbolized strength, unity and the very dwelling place of the eternal forces. The material body of all things came to be represented as a rock. Eventually this symbolism evolved into the shape of a cube or pedestal, while the Spirit or essence of all things came to be symbolized by carved figures which surmounted the pedestal. Thus were the first altars and stone images of the gods created. Gemstones and minerals also play an important role in the art of physical Alchemy. By definition, minerals are \"a naturally occurring homogenous sub- stance formed by inorganic processes and having a definite and limited range of physical properties, and a molecular structure usually expressed in crystalline form.\" In more general terms, minerals are \"inorganic materials especially as dis- tinguished from animal or vegetable matter.\" Minerals are the building blocks of the Earth's crust and of the very bedrock of the Planet. To the Alchemist, there are three kingdoms or principalities: (1) vegetable, (2) animal, and (3) mineral. Each kingdom has its own essence. All three are evolved from the same original source, but each manifests under different vibra- tions in its respective realm. The vegetable kingdom has the lowest vibratory rate, while the mineral kingdom has the highest. Humanity is the highest part of the middle (animal) kingdom, which holds the balance between all three kingdoms. Thus humanity can partake of either the higher or lower kingdoms to its benefit through the art of Alchemy."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The Zelator Grade 167 Diamond Star Ruby, Turquoise Star Sapphire, Pearl Amethyst, Sapphire Ruby Topaz, Yellow Diamond Emerald Opal, especially Fire Opal Quartz Rock Crystal, Salt The Planets Saturn Jupiter Mars Sol Venus Mercury Luna Certain stones and minerals (as well as metals) are attributed to different Planetary, Elemental, Zodiacal and Sephirotic energies.

Earth Deities There are numerous deities associated with the Earth from different pantheons. The student should be familiar with several Earth deities from various Western traditions: GEB (or SEB): The principle Earth god of the Egyptians and the father of Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, and Set. The Earth itself formed the body of Geb. He is usually depicted in the form of a man who wears upon his head the white crown or the crown of the North, to which is added the Atef crown. Geb is also depicted as a goose, of the particular species called seb. He is the god of the Earth's surface which gives rise to vegetation, and he is important to the mythology of the Underworld as well-having authority over the tombs of the dead. Geb fig- ures prominently in the first act of creation, when the Earth god and the Sky goddess, Nut, were locked in a lovers' embrace. Geb's father Shu, the Air god, interceded and lifted 53 Uriel is sometimes spelled as Auriel. Geb"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"The Zelator Grade 169 Demeter the starry body of Nut off that of the Earth god, thus forming the Earth, the starry heaven and the air between the two. TAMMUZ (or DUMUZI): The principle Earth deity and harvest god of the Assyro- Babylonian pantheon. Tammuz was the lover of Ishtar, the primary goddess figure. However, like a ripened ear of com, Tammuz was cut down-ravished by death in the fullness of youth and forced to descend into the underworld. Ishtar descended into the Earth and suffered death to save him. As a compromise, Tammuz was des- tined to spend half of the year ruling over the land during a season of growth and abundance. After harvest however, Tammuz entered a period of withdrawal back into the underworld. Thus were the seasonal cycles of the Earth created. Other Babylonian Earth deities include a great Earth Mother who was worshiped under the various names of NINHURSAG, NINMAH, NINTU and KI. She was the pre-eminent Mother goddess, who, like the Gaea of the Greeks, represented the great creative principle. GAEA (Equivalent to the Roman Tellus Mater): One of the most ancient of the Greek deities, Gaea was the deep-breasted and fertile Earth which appeared out of Chaos. From her was borne Uranus, the sky crowned with stars, followed by the mountains and the sea. Together, Gaea and Uranus produced the first race, the Titans. She is commonly represented in the form of a gigantic woman. In later times she became identified with the goddess, RHEA, whose name means \"Earth.\" CYBELE: Originally a Greek goddess of caverns, Cybele personified the Earth in its primitive and savage state. She exercised dominion over wild animals and was worshiped on the tops of mountains. Greek representations of Cybele retained an Asiatic character. She is usually depicted with the turreted crown of an Asian Mother-goddess, seated on a throne flanked by two lions, or else driving a chariot pulled by lions. ATTIS was the agricultural and vegetation god whose role in respect to Cybele was comparable to that of Tammuz to the Babylonian Ishtar (or ADONIS to the Phoenician Astarte). DEMETER (Equivalent to the Roman Ceres): The Greek god- dess of the fruitful Earth, Demeter represented the fertile and cultivated soil. She is above all a goddess of fruit trees and fields. Demeter was especially a com-goddess, but wheat and barley were also sacred to her. She governed the harvest and all the agricultural activities. The goddess is usually repre- sented dressed as a mature woman in a long robe and often wearing a veil that covers the back of her head. She is some- times shown crowned with ears of com or a ribbon, and she holds in her hand either a scepter, ears of com, or a torch. PERSEPHONE (or Kore \"girl\"): The daughter of Demeter is the Greek goddess of harvest and fertility. Persephone was kid- napped by the God of the Underworld, Hades. At the loss of her daughter, Demeter set about making the Earth barren. The"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"170 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON Nerthus god. Zeus persuaded Hades to release the young Kore, but tempted her to eat some pomegranate seeds first, which made their union indissoluble. To settle the matter, Zeus decided that Persephone would live with her husband in the Underworld for one-third of the year and spend the other two-thirds with her mother. Thus for part of the year, when Persephone joined Hades, the Earth became cold, sorrowful and unproductive, but when she returned in the Spring, the Earth resumed its warmth along with its mantle of flowering plants and fertile crops. Persephone is portrayed as maiden crowned and enthroned. She sometimes carries an ear of com or a pomegranate. Other Western Earth deities include numerous Celtic fertility Persephone goddesses or matres-Mother goddesses: DANU or DANA: The companion of Bile. The descendants of Danu called them- selves Tuatha De Dannan (\"people of the goddess Dana\" or \"The children of Don\"). BRIGIT: Celtic goddess of the seasons. Brigit's celebration Imbolc, a great festival of pagan purification, takes place on February 1st. (Incidentally,with the com- ing of Christianity, the goddess Brigit was transformed into a patron saint.) Teutonic fertility goddesses include GEFJON, \"the Giver\" or \"the Donor,\" and NERTHUS, the productive Earth Mother. Nerthus is pictured driving a chariot pulled by heifers. EPONA: A Celtic goddess who was the protectress of horses, Epona also pre- sided over the fertility of the soil.e SECTION 7: Divination and Geomancy • • People who have no experience with Tarot and other forms of div- • • ination often think that these practices are little more than supersti- tion and folklore. The truth is that those who study and practice div- • ination believe that all things in the universe are divine. Nothing takes • place in a divine universe by chance or coincidence. Nothing that exists within a divine universe is without meaning or significance. The word divination is based on a Latin word which means \"the faculty of foreseeing.\" The word comes from the Latin word for \"divine power,\" or \"of the gods.\" This indicates that the true meaning of the word divination is \"to make divine.\""},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"The Zelator Grade 171 Far from being a superstitious practice, the art of divination reveals itself as a spiritual science that seeks to discover the divine meaning behind \"chance\" events. Divination has existed as a tool for psychic well-being and spiritual health long before modern psychology was born, although the later science has often borrowed heavily from the former. Ever since human beings first realized that there were Higher Powers beyond the Physical world, we have tried to communicate with these Forces. Prayers and invocations to the gods and goddesses developed out of the human desire to talk to the Divine-to worship them and ask them for guidance and intervention. Ritual trance and meditation developed out the human desire to let the gods talk to us-to enrich our lives with a higher form of Wisdom. Divination developed as a way to interact with the gods. It was a method by which humans could interpret and understand the Will of the Divine. Divination can open up the mind of the diviner to wonders of the spiritual world and the invisible universe which is behind the visible universe. Also, the different methods of divination are good exercises for developing the student's powers of intuition and imagination. The art of divination is a process of spiritual growth through which the diviner attempts to uncover what specific forces are at work in a given area of the astral realms. It is the art of acquiring psychic information with the help of physi- cal accessories such as Tarot cards, skrying mirrors, crystals, pendulums or simi- lar psychic aids. Properly done, divination can determine which underlying ener- gies are at work in a specific region of the invisible universe. However, any infor- mation obtained in this manner is to be used as a guide or a road map only-not as an undeniable destiny carved into stone. Divination is an art that takes much practice in order to become proficient, yet practice is exactly what is needed in order to fine-tune the psychic powers of the diviner. The beginning student should not worry about whether or not the answers given in the divination are always correct. The important thing is that the student gradually increases his/her astral powers of perception with each reading. One very important principle in any form of divination is the Law of Corre- spondences. This idea states that there is always a correspondence between the many planes of Being. The Hermetic Axiom states this idea in the words: \"As Above, so Below. As Below, so Above.\" This Law is called into use whenever we apply symbols to mean certain things. For example, in Tarot a cup is used to symbolize the Womb of the Divine Mother. A cup and a womb are definitely not the same thing. One is metal, the other is flesh and blood. Yet they both have the same essential quality of contain- ing and nurturing life. In a sense, they have a similar cosmic reality. Another example of the Law of Correspondences is when the metal gold is used to indicate the Sun, or silver for the Moon. It would not be right to say that gold is the same as the Sun or that silver is the same as the Moon. But the two metals and the two Planets are both symbols used to describe the same two divine realities. The Law of Correspondences helps initiates apply various meanings to visible symbols, enabling us to better comprehend the divine nature of things"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"172 SELF-INITIATION IN10 THE GoLDEN DAWN TRADITION which are not visible to us. Thus it is important that the student memorize the cor- respondences which apply to a system such as Geomancy or Tarot. All images and ideas associated with the system must become second-nature to the diviner, so that they can be recalled instantly in a reading. Geomancy The random generation of the Geomantic Tetragrams is called Squilling. Nowa- days it is usually performed using pen and paper, by simply creating sixteen rows of dots with ink on paper or parchment. However, it was originally performed by poking holes into dirt or sand to obtain different symbols and figures. Although this procedure can be done entirely using pen and paper, actual use of the Earth in the divination is a more powerful method of forming the mag- icallink between the diviner and the Planetary Genius summoned. To this end the student may wish to construct a wooden box specifically for Geomantic divinations. This box is to be filled with Earth and consecrated by a ritual. A wand is used for poking holes into the dirt and squilling the sixteen Root Lines which generate the Tetragrams.v Geomancy can be performed using a variety of other techniques as well: 55 Pebble-working: A bag of gemstones can be used for squilling the figures. The diviner draws a handful of stones from the bag and sets them aside in pairs until there are either one or two stones remaining, odd or even. This is done six- teen times to obtain the sixteen Root Lines needed. Coin- Working: Flipping coins is an easy way to generate yes/no or odd/even responses. I Ching coins can easily be adapted for this purpose. Dice- Working: The rolling of a dice will immediately give you an odd or even number. Stone-Working: A set of Geomancy stones can be constructed out of oven- hardening clay (or wood) with the figures of the Tetragrams painted right on them. (Only ten stones are needed for a full set since many of the Tetragrams are reversed images of each other.) This is a quick way of squilling, since one only needs to pick out four completed Tetragrams rather than determining sixteen dif- ferent Root Lines. The Ruling Spirits of Geomancy A successful divination using this method depends on the contact made with a Geomantic Spirit or Genius. These Spirits are collectively called Genii. They are the ruling Spirits of the Planetary energies invoked in a Geomantic reading. At the beginning of a reading, the diviner selects one of these ruling Spirits-whichever Spirit best reflects the Planetary nature of the question being asked. The diviner should take care to phrase the question clearly and concisely, because the answer is only going to reflect the most literal form of the question. 54 The construction of the Geomancy Box is described in our book, Secrets of a Golden Dawn Temple. 55 From Adam Forrest's article, \"Mysteria Geomantica: Teachings in the Art of Geomancy,\" pub- lished in The Golden Dawn Journal, Book 1: Ditnnation."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Aequisitio •• Amissio • Sagittarius • Taurus •• •• • • •• Albus •• Rubeus • • Gemini •• Scorpio • • •• •• •• Puella • Puer • Libra •• Aries • • •• • • Laetitia • Tristitia •• Pisces •• Aquarius •• •• •• •• • Caput Draeonis •• Cauda Draeonis • North Node • South Node • • • • •• Populus •• Via • Cancer •• Cancer • •• • •• • Conjunetio •• Career • Virgo • Capricorn •• • •• •• • Fortuna Major •• Fortuna Minor • Leo •• Leo • • •• • •• The Sixteen Tetragrams of Geomancu 173"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"The Tetragrams and their Genii ~0 .§' i<:~ ,~~ .\" J..~ s ~- ,.ro.fli ~ ~' (J (/ ~fli ~ ~ ~ .,ij :\"...0 ~~ S .c, ~ ~ ~ # ~~ o . {Ji 0fl) ~tri 'V ~I Tristitia ./'V'V'.. ::: IVS Hismael and Kedemel Zazel and Bartzabel ~Itbl Zazel ~ I~I Kedemel cJ I-DI Bartzabel ~I~I Zazel ~2t-I~ ~I~ 4- 1 ~I Hismael i-I ~ I Hismael Acquisitio Rubeus Puella Career Laetitia Caput Draconis Cauda Draconis J€ fb (j • • ·I....f\"\\- · -- • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • · • rrnt • • • •• • :·:I? • • • • • • • • ~ 1~IKedemel ~ I '1:0 I Taphthartharath J)1)IChasmodai ~ I r-:± I Taphthartharath () 1-9, Bartzabel ])I) I Chasmodai OIBISorath OI!5ISorath Populus Puer Amissio Albus Via Fortuna Minor Fortuna Major Conjunctio ]I ~ (j r e9 dl TtQ It • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • ... ~"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"The Zelator Grade 175 This system of divination is unlike others in that the psychic awareness of the diviner is of less importance than in a system such as Tarot. It is the diviner's ability to evoke the Spirit that becomes the focus of consideration for a successful Geomantic divination. This is the reason why Geomancy is perhaps a better method for individuals who have trouble visualizing or interpreting a reading. The Mechanics of Geomancy Usingpenand paper: Formulate and state a question you wish to have answered in the divination. Using a Squilling sheet or Geomancy chart especially created for Divination, trace an invoking Pentagram of Earth in the center of a circle. Inside the pentagram draw the sigil of the Planetary Genius who pertains to your question-the Genius of the Planet whose energy would be most receptive or helpful in the matter. The diviner should recite a short invocation prior to tracing these magical symbols. First invoke the highest Divine Name for Elemental Earth, followed by the hierarchy of Angels associated with Earth, and finally enlist the help of the Planetary Genius who is involved in the working. The following invocation, which procures the aid of the Genius Hismael is an example of such an invocation. The underlined names can be exchanged for whatever entities the Geomancer intends to work with. In the Divine Name of ADONAI HA-ARETZ, I invoke the mighty and powerful Angel URIEL, come forth and invest this divination with Truth.

(This process should take on somewhat of the nature of auto- matic writing, with the diviner not consciously aware of number of dots being put on the paper.) When finished, each of the sixteen sections should contain at least one dot. Then determine whether each line has either an odd or even number of dots. If a line has an even number it is assigned two dots. If the number is odd, it receives one dot. The Mothers The sixteen lines produce four Mothers known as figures 1-4 on the Squilling sheet. Each Mother is a figure formed from four of the sixteen Root Lines. Look at the first Mother Tetragram that you have constructed. Next to the top Root Line, write the word HEAD. Next to the second Root Line, write the word NECK.

On the Abacus worksheet, you will have formed the four figures of the Mothers (MI-M4) on the vertical columns, The four Daughters (01-04) will be formed from right to left on the horizontal rows of the Abacus. The Nephews The next group of four figures that the Geomancer must generate is known as the Nephews, sometimes called the Resultants (figures 9-12). The Nephews are gener- ated in a somewhat different manner than were the Daughters. The first Nephew is formed by adding together the dots which compose the first and second Moth- ers (Ml + M2). By adding the dots of two figures together you will get an odd or even number. If the number were even you would put down two dots. If it were odd you would put down one dot. In our example to get Nephew 1, we will take Mothers 1 and 2, add together the two dots labeled Heads. This is the Head of the First Nephew (or figure 9). Add together the dots labeled Necks of Mothers 1 and 2 using the same technique. The result will be the Neck of Nephew 1. Add together the dots labeled Bodies of Mothers 1 and 2 using the same method. The result will be the Body of Nephew 1. Add together the dots labeled Feet of Mothers 1 and 2 as before. The result will be the Feet of Nephew 1. (The four inner side bars of the Abacus worksheet labeled NI-N4 are for generating the Nephews.

Interpret the figure in light of the house to which the question pertains. (Some relationships between the Judge and the house of the question will strengthen or weaken the impact of the Judge. Refer to the Table of Essential Dignities given in Chapter One. ) 3. Interpret the Judge and the two Witnesses: A good Judge made of two good Witnesses is good. A bad Judge made of two bad Witnesses is bad. A good Judge made of mixed good & bad Witnesses means success, but delay and vexation. Two good Witnesses and a bad Judge, the result will be unfor- tunate in the end. First Witness is good and the second bad, the success will be very doubtful. First Witness bad and the second good, unfortunate beginning will take a good turn. 4. Check to see if the same Geomantic figure as the Judge actually turns up anywhere else. At this point the Geomancer may have all that is necessary to obtain a quick answer by examining the three figures of the Right Witness, the Left Witness and the Judge. The Right Witness can be interpreted as the beginning of the matter, the Left Witness is the way in which the matter progresses, and the Judge is the conclusion of the Matter. In our example, the Judge is the figure of Conjunctio, a positive Tetragram that indicates harmonious union and coming together. It is also the Tetragram of Virgo-i-an Earthy Sign. The Left Witness is Acquisitio- gain, which is attributed to Sagittarius-a Fire Sign. The Right Witness is Fortuna Major, a very positive fig- ure associated with Leo, another Fire Sign. Overall, the results of such a reading depict a positive Fiery force grounding itself harmoniously into Earth or manifesta- tion. A very good reading. Of course the Geomancer may at this point decide to go further and explore the subtle nuances of the working. This is done more or less by reading the divination as one would read a Zodiacal chart. The Part of Fortune Calculate the Part of Fortune (especially helpful in questions of money). It is deter- mined by adding together all the points of the first twelve tetragrams, then divid- ing this number by 12.

Figure 12 goes in the 9th house. (*One of the old Medieval rules in Geomancy was to check to see if the Rubeus or Cauda Draconis fell in the first house. If either of these figures was pre- sent, the Geomancer was advised to destroy the chart and wait at least two hours before asking the question again. This old superstition is equivalent to teaching a Tarot reader to destroy a reading and thoroughly panic the Querent if the Tarot Trumps of the Devil or Death turned up as the Significator. Modem occultists no longer view the Sign of Scorpio or the South Node of the Moon as Evil. Therefore this particular rule should be disregarded.) Determine which particular Zodiacal house relates to the question being asked. This figure will have great significance to the reading. Write down the Zodiacal attributions of each figure in each house. (If the First house contains the figure of Amissio, which relates to Taurus, then the first house starts with and is Taurus. The rest of the houses follow in order, so that Fig- ure 6 in the 2nd house is in the house of Gemini, even if the Figure happens to be Fortuna Minor, which relates to Leo. Thus as in Astrology, the ruling Planet of Leo, the Sun, is in Gemini.) Determine the Planets of the Tetragrams, as they fall in each house; i.e., Puer equals Mars, Conjunctio equals Mercury. A normal Zodiacal chart showing the twelve houses in the circular chart or wheel form might be useful to write this infor- mation on. (Amajor difference between Geomancy and Astrology is that in a Geo- mantic chart, one Planet may occupy several different houses at the same time.) Also determine the balance of Elements (Fire, Water, Air, Earth) in the chart. See if an imbalance of Elemental forces is apparent. Estimate the Accidental Dignity of the figure. In modem Astrology, Essential Dignity relates to a Planet in a particular Sign. A Planet in a Sign in which it is strengthened is in one of its Essential Dignities. Accidental Dignity relates to a Planet in a particular house. A Planet in a house in which it is strengthened is in one of its Accidental Dignities. The Accidental Dignity of a figure in a particular house is a measure of its strength and the degree to which it will influence the judgment.) This brings us to the fact that the Tetragrams are more strongly correlated to the Planets than they are to the Zodiacal Signs, especially when they are placed in Zodiacal houses, such as on the Square Chart.

The right-hand Kerub standing by the white pillar is Metatron, while the left-hand Kerub is Sandalphon, standing by the black pil- lar.

The Sephiroth may be described as energy centers of God-eonsciousness, while the paths connecting them are conduits or energy channels. Together the Sephiroth and the Twenty-two Paths form the Thirty-two Paths of Wisdom as described in the Sepher Yetzirah or Book of Formation. The Qabalah teaches that all manifestation is based upon the principle of polarity. The two pillars on either side of the altar represent the two great contending forces of the universe: The Pillar of Mercy in the South: Its characteristics are: white, active, posi- tive, masculine, force. It is a pillar of Light and Fire which is associated with the Biblical Adam and with Metatron who in this instance is the right-hand Kerub of the Tree of Life.

The Fylfot Cross is the Admission Badge to 1=10 grade of Zelator. It is also called the Hermetic Cross, the Hammer of Thor, the Gammadion and the Swastika. It is formed of seventeen squares out of a square of twenty-five lesser squares. These seventeen represent the Sun, the four Elements, and the twelve Signs of the Zodiac.

The symbol of the Sun is at the center of the cross at the point of stillness, while the Zodiacal Signs divided into the four Triplicities make up the arms of the cross. The Cardinal Signs all begin at the center of the cross, followed by the Fixed and Muta- ble Signs. The Arms terminate with the Elemental symbols of each Triplicity.The whole cross represents the center of the universe giving rise to the celestial Signs, which then formulate the Elements of the physical world. Since the Fylfot is originally formed out of twenty-five squares, this cross also has an affinity with Fire. Twenty-five is the number of squares forming the Qamea or magical square of Mars. According to J. E. Cirlot (A Dictionary of Symbols), all the words for \"cross\" (crux, cruz, crowz, croaz, krois, krouz) have a common etymological basis in -ak, -ur, or -os, signifying the \"light of the Great Fire.\" (This is also one reason why the lamen of the Dadouchos consists of this symbol.) The Fylfot Cross is a symbol of an equal-armed cross with four arms appearing to rotate in the same direction around a central axis. During the Iron Age the Swastika represented the supreme deity. In the Middle Ages, the general interpretation of the figure was that it symbolized movement and the power of the Sun. This cross also signifies the action of the origin of the universe. In addition, the Fylfot is a symbol attributed to the first Sephirah, Kether. Here it represents the four latent (Primal) Elements whose energies are united in Kether, activated by the Primum Mobile or First Whirlings. These energies are finally differentiated into the four base Elements of Fire, Water, Air and Earth upon reaching the level of Malkuth on the Tree. The Fylfot Cross, given to the candidate in the Zela- tor grade, points out a close relationship that exists between Kether and Malkuth.

The top of the dodek- agram or twelve-sided figure points to Aries, and the letter Heh in the East, while the bottom tip of the figure points to libra and the letter Lamed in the West.

The central pentagram which represents the Great Mother of Heaven through the letter Heh (5), points toward a position between the Signs of Aries and Pisces, thus referring to a point in the prismatic color wheel where red intersects red-violet. This is the point at which the invisible colors of infrared and ultraviolet are formed. The red color of Aries represents the beginning of the color wheel, whereas Pisces indi- cates the end (Alpha and Omega). The flames seen in the center of the Pentagram refer to the rays of the Sun.

We have chosen to retain it in the Zelator Grade because of its relevance not only to the Table of Shewbread diagram but also to the ancient Hebrew Tabernacle in the Wilderness, which plays such an important role in the Zelator ritual of self-initiation. 60 Unfortunately there is an error in this manuscript concerning the permutations of the Name for both Virgo and Pisces which should be switched. One of the Senior Adepts of our Order has determined that the error came about through a confusion between the letters Heh (Water) and Heh Sophith (Earth). The correct permutation of the Name for VIrgo is HHYV and the Name for Pisces is HHVY. 61 The name Advachiel is a centuries' old error. The true name of the Angel of Sagittarius is Adnakhiel. (See the article entitled \"Mysteria Geomantica\" by Adam Forrest in The Golden Dawn Journal, Book 1: Divination."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"200 SELF-INITIATION IN10 THE GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON Of these, especially the Bull (Taurus), the Lion (Leo), the Scorpion (Scorpio, but in good symbolism the Eagle) and the Man (Aquarius) are to be noted as form- ing the Kerubic figures of Ezekiel and John. To these Signs are allotted the tribes of Ephraim, Judah, Dan and Reuben, who, as we shall presently see, encamped towards the Cardinal Points around the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and as the leaders of the others. The Signs of the Twins (Gemini), the Fishes (Pisces), and in a certain sense as a compounded figure, the Centaur (Sagittarius) armed with a bow, are also called bi-eorporate, or double-bodied Signs. To these refer Manasseh (Gemini), Simeon (pisces) and Benjamin (Sagittarius). Manasseh was divided into two half tribes with separate possessions (being the only tribe thus divided), and thus answers to the equal division of the Sign of the Twins, Castor and Pollux, the Great Twin Brethren. Simeon and Levi are classed together, like the two Fishes in the Sign, but Levi is withdrawn later, to form as it were the binding and connect- ing link of the Tribes, as the priestly caste. Benjamin is the younger brother of Joseph, for Rachael had only these two sons, and is the only one of the sons of Jacob who at his birth was called by two names, for Rachel called him \"Ben oni,\" but his father Benjamin, and in the Sign of the two natures of Man and Horse are bound together in one symbol. We shall find much light upon the connection between the Signs and the Tribes shown by the blessing of Jacob, and of Moses, from the former of which the Armorial bearings of the Twelve Tribes are derived. Let us note that as in the Tribes Levi was withdrawn, and the two Tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh substi- tuted for the simple one of Joseph, so in the New Testament, Judas is withdrawn from the number of the twelve Apostles and his place filled by another, Matthias, who was chosen by lot to fill his place. The following is the order by birth, of the children of Jacob: Leah bore Reuben (::::::::), Simeon (H), Levi, afterwards withdrawn, and Judah (<Q). Bilhah (Rachel's maid) bore Dan (nu, and Naphthali (Jl}), Zilpah (Leah's maid) bore Gad (nr) and Ashur (~). Leah again bore Issachar (!!P), Zebulun (l),) and Dinah (a daughter). Rachel bore Joseph, whose sons were Manasseh (IT) and Ephraim «($\"), but died at the birth of Benjamin (X\"), whom she wished to call Ben-oni. In the WIlderness the Tabernacle was pitched in the midst, and immediately surrounding it were the tents of Levi. At a distance towards the four cardinal points were the standards of the Twelve Tribeserected there: On the East: On the South: On the West: On the North: JUDAH, Kerubic Sign of the Lion (<Q) with Issachar (!!P) and Zebulun (l),) REUBEN,Kerubic Sign of the Man (::::::::) with Simeon (H) and Gad (nr) EPHRAIM, Kerubic Sign of the Bull «($\") with Manasseh (IT) and Benjamin (X\") DAN, Kerubic Sign of the Eagle (m.) with Asher (~) and Naphtali (Jl})"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"The Zelator Grade 201 Save for the Kerubic emblems, the arrangement seems at first very con- fused; but when we notice the Maternal Ancestors of the Tribes, this confusion dis- perses, and we notice that at the East are three tribes descended from Leah, viz. Judah, Issachar and Zebulon. Opposite to them, towards the West, three tribes descended from Rachel, viz. Ephraim, Manasseh and Benjamin. At the South are two descended from Leah and one descended from Zilpah, viz. Reuben, Simeon and Gad, and at the North, two descended from Bilhah and one descended from Zilpah, viz. Dan, Naphthali and Asher. Here two tribes descended from Zilpah, Gad (r\\f) and Asher (a), are the only ones separated, and placed in opposition to each other, for these are two signs of the Equinoxes. The substitution of the two tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh for the single one of Joseph is given in Genesis 48, where Jacob blessed them prior to the general blessing of the Tribes, stating at the same time that Ephraim, though the younger, should take precedence over Manasseh: \"And Jacob said unto Joseph ... And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee in Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon they shall be mine. And thy issue which thou begettest after them shall be thine and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance ... Moreover I have given unto thee one portion above of thy brethren.\" Let us now notice the blessings of Jacob and Moses, and compare them with the Signs of the Zodiac attributed to each Tribe. We shall take them in the Zodiacal order. Of Gad (Aries), Jacob says, \"Gad, a troop shall overcome him, but he shall overcome at the last.\" Moses says, \"Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lioness, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head, and he provideth the first part for himself because there, in a portion of the law-giver, was he sealed; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the Lord, and his judg- ments with IsraeI.\" The armonial bearings of Gad are, white, a troop of cavalry. All this coincides well with the martial and dominant nature of Aries, the only one of the twelve signs in which the superior Planets alone bear sway, for it is the house of Mars, exaltation of the Sun and triplicity of Sun and Jupiter. The symbolism of the Lion is also proper to Aries on account of its solar, fiery and martial nature. Of Ephraim and Manasseh (Taurus and Gemini), classed together under their father's name, Jacob says, \"Joseph is a fruitful bough by a well, whose branches run over the wall; the archers have surely grieved him and shot at him, and hated him: but the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:) Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, and by the Almighty who shall bless thee with the blessings of Heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts and of the womb: the blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him who was sepa- rate from his brethren.\" Moses says, \"Blessed of the Lord be his land, for the pre- oious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath, and for /the precious fruits brought forth by the Sun, and for the precious things put forth by"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"202 SELF-INITIATION INTO TIlE GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON the moon, and for the chief things of the lasting hills. And for the precious things of the Earth, and the fullness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwells in the bush: let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head. of him that was separate from his brethren. His glory is like the firstling of a bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the Earth, and they are the ten thousands of Manasseh.\" The Armorial Bearings of Ephraim are: Green, an Ox. Those of Mannesseh are flesh-eolor, a Vine by a Wall. All this refers to the natures of Taurus and Gem- ini, the firstling of the bullock and the Earthy nature of the Sign, shown by the hills, to Taurus while the archers over Manasseh, as Sagittarius, the Sign of the Archer, is in opposition to Gemini. Of Issachar, (Cancer) Jacob says: \"Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens: and he saw the rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant, and he bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant under tribute.\" Moses says: \"Rejoice Issachar, in thy tents ... and they shall suck of the abundance of the seas.\" The armorial bearings of Issachar are Blue, and an ass crouching beneath its burden. This coincides with the peaceful nature of the quiet and watery Sign of Cancer. Of Judah (Leo) Jacob says: \"Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee. Judah is a lion's Whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up; he stooped down, he crouched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the peo- ple be. Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto ,the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes: his eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.\" Moses says, \"This is the blessing of Judah, and he said, Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his peo- ple, let his hands be sufficient for him and be thou an help to him from his ene- mies.\" The armorial bearings of Judah are Scarlet, a lion rampant. All this well agrees with the regal and leonine nature of the Sign. \"Binding the ass's colt unto the choice vine\" may allude to the ass of Issachar, Cancer, lying between Judah, Leo, and the vine of Manasseh, Gemini. Of Naphthali (Virgo) Jacob says, \"Naphthali is a hind let loose, he giveth goodly words.\" Moses says, \"0 Naphthali satisfied with favor, and full with the blessings of the Lord, possess thou the West and the South.\" The armorial bear- ings of Naphthali are Blue, a hind. Of Asher (Libra) Jacob says, \"Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.\" Moses says, \"Let Asher be blessed with children, let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil. Thy shoes shall be iron and brass, and as thy days, so shall thy strength be.\" The armorial bearings of Asher are Purple, a Cup. All this coincides with the nature of Venus and Libra, while the feet refer to the Sign of Pisces, which rules the feet, and in which Venus is exalted. Iron and Brass are the metals of the friendly Planets of Mars and Venus."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"WEST Ephraim -- Bull ~ Manasseh -- IT Benjamin -- il' Levi Holy of Holies I Ark I SOUTH Veil ..00: 0 Ul Reuben - Man : .~ j Incense [ i\" 11 ... ~.

Dan shall be a serpent by the way, and adder in the path, that biteth the horse's heels, so that his rider shall fall backward. I have waited for thy salvation, o Lord.\" Moses says. \"Dan is a lion's whelp, he shall leap from Bashan.\" The armo- rial bearings of Dan are Green, an Eagle. These things fit with the martial and fierce nature of this Sign in which Mars principally bears sway. To the Sign of Scorpio, the Egyptians attributed the Serpent, and also Typhon, the Slayer of Osiris, and on this account they call it the\" Accursed Sign.\" In good symbolism it is generally repre- sented by the Eagle. The horse's heels which the Serpent sometimes bites are found in the Centaur figure of Sagittarius which follows Scorpio in the Zodiac. Of Benjamin (Sagittarius) Jacob says, \"Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.\" Moses says: \"The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.\" The armorial bearings of Benjamin are Green, a Wolf. These suit the character of Sagit- tarius, partly keen, partly of the nature of Jupiter, and partly brutal. Of Zebulon (Capricorn) Jacob says: \"Zebulon shall dwell at the haven of the sea, and he shall be for a haven of ships, and his border shall be unto Sidon.\" Moses says: \"Rejoice Zebulon in thy going out, and Issachar in thy tents, they shall call the people unto the mountain, there they shall offer sacrifices of righteous- ness, for they shall suck of the abundance of the sea, of the treasures hid in the sands.\" This suits well the tropical, Earthy and water signs of Capricorn and Can- cer. The armorial bearings of Zebulon are Purple, a.Ship. Of Reuben (Aquarius) Jacob says: \"Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity and the excel- lency of power. Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel, because thou wentest up to thy father's bed, then defiledst thou it; he went up to my couch.\" Moses says: \"Let Reuben live and not die, and let not his men be few.\" The armorial bearings of Reuben are Red, a Man. \"Unstable as water\" is still shown in the undulating hieroglyphic which marks this aerial and brilliant, but often superficial Sign of the Water-Bearer. Of Simeon and Levi (Pisces) Jacob says: \"Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations. 0 my Soul, come not thou into their secret, unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall. Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scat- ter them in Israel.\" This alludes to their smiting Shalem, the city of Hamor and Shechem, and slaying the latter because they had carried off Dinah, the daughter of Leah. Moses says of them: \"Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with the Holy One, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the water of Meribah; who said unto his father and mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his children; for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.

These are the blessings of the twelve tribes of Israel, whose names were engraven upon the twelve stones of the High Priest's breastplate, upon which, according to some traditions, certain flashes of Light appeared playing over cer- tain of the letters, and thus returning the answer of the deity to the consulter of the Oracle of the Urim. By comparing these blessings with the nature of the Signs attributed to the particular tribes, we have thus been enabled to trace more or less clearly the con- nection between them, and also the derivation of the armorial bearings ascribed to them in Royal Arch Preemasonry.e This concludes the Knowledge Lecture. Examinations on the initiation ceremony as well as the material covered in this section are given at the end of this chapter.e Ritual Work for the Zelator Continue the Fourfold breath technique as taught in the Neophyte grade. Add to this a visualization of the seasons as follows: Inhale Full Hold Exhale EmptyHold - Spring Summer Autumn Winter The Zelator should construct all of the following talismanic emblems to aid in meditation and ritual. All emblems should be painted white on a black background: • A Square • A Cube • The SigH of Elemental Earth • The Sigil of Planet Earth • The Sigil of Capricorn • The Sigil of Taurus • The Sigil of Virgo • The Sigil of Salt • The Number Ten • The Name Adonai ha-Aretz in Hebrew • The Dekagon & Dekangle (See Chapter Four)"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"206 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoWEN DAWN TRADITION MEDITATION for the 1 = 10 grade of Zelatoy62 LET THE ZELATOR meditate on a straight line. Let him take a ruler or a pencil and by moving it a distance equal to its length, outline a square. Having done this, after quieting his mind with the rhythmic breathing taught in the first meditation, let him mentally formulate a cube, and endeavor to discover the significance of this figure and its correspondences. Let him meditate upon minerals and crystals, choosing especially a crystal of SALT, and entering into it, actually feel himself of crystalline formation. Looking out on the Universe from this standpoint, let him identify himself with the EARTH SPIRITS in love and sympathy, recalling as far as he can their prayer as said in the closing of the Zelator grade. Let him meditate upon the EARTH TRIPLICITY, visualizing the symbols of a BULL-a VIRGIN-a GOAT, which stand for KERUBIC EARTH-MUTABLE EARTH---eARDINAL EARTH. For the above terms consult a simple Astrology manual. Make notes of the ideas and pictures which arise in your mind.e RELAXATION EXERCISE The Sephirah of Malkuth is attributed to the Fourth Qabalistic World of Assiah, the World of Physical Matter. In one of the mediations given in the Neophyte grade, the student was encouraged to become more aware of the body's physical sensations. In the Zelator grade, the student should strive to learn how to use the techniques of relaxation to manipulate body sensations in a premeditated fashion, in order to cause certain changes that are both physical and psychological. Relaxation is a crucial step in changing one's conscious awareness from the mun- dane events of the day to a more spiritual focus. It is also an essential procedure that will always be undertaken prior to more advanced techniques and rituals. Before sitting or lying down, spend a minute or two engaged in physical exercise to increase the blood circulation and stimulate deep breathing. (One way to do this is to skip with an invisible rope in a stationary position.) 62 From Regardie's The Golden Dawn."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"The Zelator Grade 207 Then stand upright with the legs slightly apart. Take a deep breath and exhale, expelling all of your air as you let yourself fall forward from the waist, com- pletely relaxed, hands hanging near the feet for a moment. Allow yourself to be totally limp from the waist up. Inhale and bring yourself back to the full stand- ing position. Repeat this process about a dozen times. Be aware only of the var- ious body sensations. The actual relaxation exercise which lasts approximately one half hour can now begin. Take some very deep breaths. Sit or lie down on the floor, and remain aware only of what the body is feeling. Visualize your brain, just as you have seen the human brain in drawings-a large gray-white walnut shaped organ, divided into two hemispheres. Imagine it clearly. Concentrate. Do not allow your mind to wander from the visualization. If your mind wanders, gently bring it back. Hold the image of the brain in your mind until you begin to feel a warmth spreading out from the center of your head. Imagine yourself stimulating the flow of blood to the brain, relaxing the blood vessels there. You may be aware of a gentle tingling sensation. Picture the blood vessels within the brain, dilating enough to hold larger amounts of blood. This turns the brain pink, resulting in the sensation of warmth that you are experiencing. Move on to the eyes, visualizing them as two balls held into place by muscles. Imagine the muscles become enlarged as you channel more blood to the area. This stimulates the feeling of warmth. Then relax, imagining the eyeballs sinking back gently into their sockets. Follow this procedure for the rest of the head-visualizing the warming blood flowing into the blood vessels of the temples, cheeks, ears, nose, lips, tongue and chin. In all cases, feel the warmth and the tingling of the blood, gradually followed by the feeling of relaxation. You should now be approximately ten minutes into the exercise. The time remain- ing should be spent visualizing the rest of the body in the same manner: The neck, shoulders and abdominal area. (The more you relax the abdomen, the more likely it is that the rest of the body will relax also.) Finally imagine the current of blood separating into two mighty arterial rivers of blood which flow from the pelvis into the thighs, legs, feet and toes. Relax completely. Once you have completed this cycle of relaxation, observe how you feel. Let a sense of total relaxation and fulfillment be permanently recorded in your mind. Feel the pleasure of the moment. Impress the image thoroughly and strongly upon your mind. If you are able to remember this experience clearly, it can be evoked at any time.

If at any time you wish to relax, simply take a deep breath and imagine the word \"relax\" as you release the air from your lungs. Inhale deeply, and as you exhale, command yourself to relax. Remember the serenity of complete relaxation and it will be instantly brought back to you. Eventually this will become a conditioned reflex whose effects will be complete and automatic. This exercise should be performed at least once a day. (Twice would be better-once in the morning and once in the evening.) Variations on this technique could also be used to help cure illnesses. One might imagine the stream of blood flowing though and breaking down a cancerous growth for elimination from the body-or the flow of blood may be seen to heal a wound.e A MEDITATION ON THE FOUR QABALISTIC WORLDS For this meditation the Zelator will need a black robe and nemyss and the Outer Wand of Double Power. A Tarot deck should also be on hand. Prior to the medita- tion, remove all the Aces from the Tarot deck. Put the rest of the deck aside. Perform a rite of relaxation. With the wand perform the LBRP. Place the Aces on the altar or on the floor in front of you if you wish to be seated. Arrange the cards in a straight vertical line in descending order thus: The Ace of Wands should be farthest from you in the East. Then follow the Ace of Cups, the Ace of Swords, and the Ace of Pentacles which is the closest card to you. See the cards before you as representations of the Four Worlds of the Qabalah: Atziluth, Briah, Yetzirah, and Assiah. Contemplate the cards for a few moments, observing their symbolism and coloring. Close your eyes and begin breathing rhythmically after the manner of the Fourfold Breath. Continue breathing in this fashion through the following visualization: As you inhale, see the Ace of Wands in your mind's eye. On the full hold, picture the Ace of Cups. When you exhale, visualize the Ace of Swords. On the empty hold, imagine the Ace of Pentacles. Keep breathing and visualizing while men- tally intoning the name of each world represented by the Aces. (Wands-Atzi- luth; Cups-Briah; Swords-Yetzirah; Pentacles-Assiah.) Repeat this process a"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"The Zelator Grade 209 number of times, embellishing upon the symbolism of the cards in each rhythmic cycle. Feel the energy of each Elemental image until they become animated scenes moving within your imagination, proceeding from Fire to Water, Air and Earth in rhythmic progression. As the likeness of one card merges into that of the one that follows it, see how the energies flow into one another in the formula of the Tetragrammaton. After some time is spent on the visualization, discontinue the Fourfold Breath and resume normal breathing. Face the East and say, \"Unto thee, Tetragrammaton, be ascribed the Kingdom, and the Power and the Glory. Unto the ages, Amen.\" Close the meditation by performing the Qabalistic Cross.e AN INVOCATION OF THE ELEMENT OF EARTH For the grade of Zelator For this ritual the Zelator will need a black robe, black and white striped nemyss, and the Outer Wand of Double Power/Upon the altar should be a black candle, a paten of bread and salt, and one of the talismanic emblems mentioned on page 205. The temple is to be arranged in accordance with the Zelator Hall (as in the second part of the initiation ceremony). Relax for a few moments and perform the Fourfold Breath. Go to the Northeast and say, \"HEKAS, HEKAS, ESTE BEBELOIl\" With the black end of the wand, perform the LBRP. (Say the following invocation:) Stoop not down intothat darkly splendid world wherein continually lieth a faithless depth and Hades wrapped in gloom, delighting in unintelligible images, precipitous, winding, a black ever-rolling Abyss, ever espousing a body unluminous, formless and void.

Once the candidate has attained the 1 = 10 grade the groundwork for all ensuing Ele- ~Ii!U· mental transformation and equilibration within the aspirant's psy- iii che has been built. In the 2 = 9 grade the initiate takes the second Ele- mental initiation into the ninth Sephirah, Yesod, on the Qabalistic Tree, and the spiritual process of dissolution and integration continues. There is one very important difference between the Zelator grade and the Grades of Theoricus, Practicus and Philosophus. The former initiation established the initial step onto the Sphere of Malkuth. The remaining grades (regardless of their respective Sephirotic correspondences) are in reality only further steps in the exploration of the four sub-elements of Malkuth. The Element offered for the process of transmutation in this grade is Air, or rather the Airy portion of the aspirant's psyche (to be even more precise it is the Air of Malkuth in Assiah). As the grade of entry into the Sphere of Yesod,62 the Theoricus grade also enjoys a special occult relationship with the Portal grade (as Yesod eso- terically contains the \"fifth\" element-after the four elements of Malkuth). The Planet assigned to this grade is Luna, the orb of reflected (and there- fore sometimes illusionary) Light. The initiate approaching this grade had better make certain that s/he has fully assimilated the energies and knowledge of the Zelator grade. If not, the volatile astral winds of Yesod might well blow the aspi- rant off course. Sometimes students will experience the effects of the volatile Air grade as a general lack of focus or diminished ability to concentrate on one's stud- ies. (Some have remarked that they \"feel like an air-head\" in this grade.) Like the previous grade, the 2 = 9 is a filter which will screen out individuals who do not have what it takes to be a true and worthy initiate of the Hermetic mysteries. The title of Theoricus is derived from a Greek word which means \"beholder,\" \"onlooker\" or \"student.\" The ceremony of the Theoricus can be summed up as follows: After the standard (self-initiatory) rite of opening, the forces of Elemental Air are invoked. Then the candidate must prove that s/he has grasped the secrets of the Zelator 62 The Theoricus grade deals specifically with Yesod of Mal1cuth, just as the Zelator grade placed the candidate in Malkuth of Malkuth (the Earth quarter of Malkuth.) 225"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"226 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON grade and swear an oath. Between the spheres of Malkuth and Yesod lies the 32nd Path of Tau, a journey through the subconscious mind and the astral plane, which the aspirant undertakes at this time. On this Path, the candidate is confronted by the four Kerubim, the group of Angels assigned to Yesod. (As the presidents of the Elemental forces, the four Kerubim are each assigned one of the letters of the Divine Name YHVH, and they operate in and through the four astral Elements in Yesod before these Elements are formulated into the physical world of Malkuth.) In the ritual, the Kerubim perform Elemental purifications on the aspirant, which aid the overall process of Alchemic transmutation. (Note: here the candidate also learns that the Elemental Spirits are to be invoked through the power and gover- nance of the Kerubim and their Zodiacal symbols.) After completing the 32nd Path, the candidate is shown the Tarot card of The Universe and other symbolism. Equi- librium of the Elements is stressed. The later half of the ritual involves the initiate's entry into the temple of Yesod. During this time the aspirant is shown further symbolism concerning the Garden of Eden and the Theoricus Hall. The secrets of the 2 = 9 grade are divulged, until at length, the Air Powers are released. There are only four officers stationed in the Theoricus Hall (besides the Dais officers), including the three Middle Pillar officers and the Keryx. The Phylax, Dadouchos and Stolistes have been dropped at this point. The stations of the officers are symmetrically positioned at the four quarters. This harmonious arrangement suggests the reconciling Element of Air mediating between all the opposing ener- gies within the Hall, resulting in perfect equilibrium. The number four, associated with the sphere of Chesed (the first Sephirah of manifestation below the Abyss) also refers to the firm foundation or matrix of the four Elements inherent within the sphere of Yesod-which later manifest in Malkuth during the course of the Qabal- istic Lightning Flash. If you consider the central point of the Hall, the position of the altar, you obtain the number five, the fifth Element and the esoteric Lunar number. Since the Kerubim play such an important role in this grade it is suggested that the student of this course become familiar with them: The Kerubic Forms of the Theoricus Grade The Kerubim listed here are given Hebrew names but their appearance is primar- ily Egyptian. ADAM: (Hebrew meaning: man) Man-headed or rather human-headed. Often portrayed as feminine rather than masculine, Adam is the Kerub of Air. This Kerub is stationed in the East and is visualized as an upright winged figure wear- ing a nemyss and tunic in the colors of yellow and violet. Adam is crowned by the lunar crescent and the solar disk, and can be visualized as carrying either the Lotus Wand and ankh, or the yellow Air fan. ARYEH: (Hebrew meaning: lion) Aryeh is the Kerub of Fire. This Kerub is stationed in the South and is visualized as an upright lion-headed winged figure wearing a nemyss and tunic in the colors of red and green. Aryeh can be visual- ized as carrying either the Lotus Wand and ankh, or the red lamp."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"The Theoricus Grade 227 NESHER: (Hebrew meaning: eagle) Nesher is the Kerub of Water. This Kerub is stationed in the West and is visualized as an upright eagle-headed winged figure wearing a nemyss and tunic in the colors of blue and orange. Nesher can be visualized as wearing upon his head the disk encircled by a serpent and carrying either the Lotus Wand and ankh, or the cup of Water. SHOR: (Hebrew meaning: bull) Shor is the Kerub of Earth. This Kerub is stationed in the West and is visualized as an upright bull-headed winged figure wearing a nemyss and tunic in the colors of black and white. Shor can be visual- ized as wearing upon his head the disk encircled by a serpent and carrying either the Crook and Scourge, or the platter of Salt.e Following the 2 = 9 initiation, the task of the Theoricus is to completely absorb all knowledge related to the Element of Air and the Planet Luna. The bulk of this is contained in the Third Knowledge Lecture, which also contains addi- tional information on aspects, erecting a horoscope, plants, Alchemical processes and more. As in the previous chapter, ritual work and exercises are provided that are appropriate to the grade, including a pathworking visualization for the 32nd Path of Tau. We advise the student of the Theoricus grade to heed the statement given in the 2 = 9 ceremony: \"Quit the material and seek the Spiritual!\"¢ THE THEORICUS CEREMONY Temple setup: The aspirant will need to set up the Hall beforehand in accordance with the temple diagram. The black cubical altar is placed in the center of the room. Upon it are a fan, platter of salt, red lamp or candle, and a cup of Water in their respective quarters. In the center of these items is the 21st Key of the Tarot, The Universe. 63 On the front of the altar should be a large diagram of the Flaming Sword and the Kerubim (from the Zelator grade). The pillars are placed just East of the altar. The three Hebrew letters of Shin, Tau and Qoph are shown on large plaques in the East. Both Banners of the East and West are located in the East as in the Zelator Ritual. The Enochian Tablet of Earth is placed in the North, and the Tablet of Air is situated in the East. A large pentagram is also to be located in the East behind the Hierophant. Place the lamens in accordance with the temple dia- gram/ in the positions of the officer-forms. Arrange the implements of the officers next to their respective lamens. As in the previous ritual, all of the Elemental candles should be placed around the circumference of the room, with a white candle in the East. The yellow Air candle is to be placed before the Enochian Tablet of the East. The lights on the pillars should be unshaded. A censer of burning incense should be placed in the South. The following diagrams are optional but may be employed if the candidate 63 From The New Golden Dawn Ritual Tarot."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"228 SELf-INITIATION INTO TIlE GoLDEN DAWN TRADmON so desires: The Garden of Eden and the Holy City in the South and the diagram of Gehenna in the North. 64 (Note: For the latter half of the ritual, the aspirant will also need plaques of the Hebrew letters Resh, Samekh and Tzaddi, as well as the Qamea, seal and sig- ils of Luna. [All the Qameoth and Planetary seals are found in Chapter Four.] The diagram of the Serpent on the Tree of Life, and the Caduceus Admission Badge are required, along with second red lamp and cup of Water. Have these items ready for when they are needed.) Ritual preparations: As before, it is suggested that the aspirant fast for a period of 12 hours prior to the ritual. Aritual bath is required after which the aspi- rant may put on the black Tau robe, and red slippers. The sash will need to be dec- orated with the Theoricus emblems, but it is not to be worn by the candidate at this time. Place the sash inside the altar. The aspirant must meditate for a certain length of time on a drawing of the symbol of Air-an Air triangle (apex upwards) in yellow. Next s/he must spend a period of time (20-30 minutes) in a darkened room or antechamber to the temple seated in quiet meditation while wearing a hoodwink or blindfold. The Admission Badge for the 32nd Path, the Greek Cubical Cross, should be held in the right hand throughout this period. A small yellow candle is to be the only source of light in the room. During this time, darkness and silence are to be maintained. The aspirant should imagine him/her self under the watchful eye of Anubis of the West. After this period of time, the hoodwink may be removed. The aspirant may then enter the temple and begin the ritual. Upon entering the temple, imagine that you are leaving your physical body outside as a sentinel to guard the temple, so that your spiritual self has the freedom to accept initiation. PART 0: The Opening Enter the temple with the Admission Badge of the Cubical Cross. Salute the Banner of the East with the Neophyte Signs. Leave the cross in the Western part of the tem- ple. Once inside walk deosil to the East. With the Hiereus' sword, perform the LBRP. Give one knock with the pommel of the sword against the floor or side of the chair and say: \"HEKAS, HEKAS, ESTE BEBELOI!\" Put the sword aside and go to the West of the temple, facing East. Kneel down and invoke the godform of Thme as in the previous initiation. Vibrate strongly: 64 Many diagrams that were used in the early days of the Order were later dropped from the grade ceremonies because they were considered nonessential. Some of them, such as the Altar of Incense diagram in the Zelator grade certainly are. However, the student may find some of these diagrams helpful and decide to utilize them in the initiation ceremonies. The diagram of Gehenna can be found in Chapter Five of this book."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"I Air Tablet • Crown-head Wond ~ WHITE PILLAR --------- ~~ ~~ ,/'0 I / BLACK I PILLAR I I I I I I I I \\ \\ \\\\ \"$. \\ \\ .... .... .... -, \" \" ............. - --- Sword ~ Incense Theoricus Temple for Self-Initiation: First Setup 229"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"230 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GOLDEN DAWN TRADITION THM£!

She speaks on your behalf to the divine guardians of the Hall. You hear her voice as she calls out the names of other godforms in the East of the temple: ESE, NEBETHO, THOOUTH and another, HOOR OVER. You have a vague impression of four figures in the East, seated before a veil. Thme continues to address the fig- ures, and the scene becomes hazy. As in the previous rites, it appears that the god- dess stands once again before the gigantic form of Djehoti, god of Wisdom. Thme continues a silent discussion with the god. After a few moments Thme turns toward you, salutes with the Signs toward the West and says silently: Thou mayest proceed, 0 aspirant; thou art MAAT. Thme descends from the East. In regular progression, she traces with her scepter the figures of a cross and triangle in all four quarters where the officer/ godforms are to be visualized, going from East to South, West, and North. As she does so in the East, vibrate the name \"OUSIRI\" (Oo-seer-ee) and visualize the figure of Osiris as he begins to formulate. Then she goes to the South and traces the figures at her own station, the station of the Hegemon. Thme goes to the West to make the signs, as you vibrate the name ''HOOR'' (Hoor or Hoh-or) The god Horus commences to take shape. The goddess then goes North and you intone the name of \"ANOUP EMPEIEBET\" (Ah-noop-em-pay-yeh-bet). Anubis of the East appears at the sta- tion of the Keryx. Thme takes you by the hand, and leads you between the pillars. Say: The 2 = 9 grade of Theoricus is attributed to the Planet of Luna, and the 32nd Path of Tau which alludes to the universe as composed ofthe Four Ele- ments-to the Kerubim, the Qlippoth and theAstral Plane, and the reflec- tion of the sphere of Saturn.

Osiris traces in the air before you the figure of a cross and circle. He then hands you his crown-headed scepter. Picking up the Wand of Power, you take on The Sign of Theoricus the office of Hierophant that Osiris has bestowed upon you.

Trace with the fan the sigil of Aquarius before the Tablet. 66 Say: 66 In Regardie's The Golden Dawn, the Hierophant uses a pentacle to trace these figures before the Tablet of the East. This is due to the fact that the number five is considered an esoteric Lunar num- ber associated with Yesod, and it hints at a subtle correspondence that exists between the 2=9 grade and the Portal grade. However, we have always felt that the use of the pentacle to invoke the powers of Air was a bit too esoteric.

Visualize the officer / godform of the Hierophant handing you the Banner of the East. Take up the Banner of East in your left hand. Anubis as Keryx speaks to you: Let us enter the Presence of the Lord of Truth. Arise and follow me. Anubis with lantern and staff, turns to the right and leads you through the pil- lars, and very slowly around the Hall. As he does so, visualize the following: At this point, briefly imagine in your mind's eye that you are pass- ing through a Gate marked with the Hebrew letter Tau, leaving the sphere of Malkuth behind and following your guide through a blue-violet tunnel or passageway. You are leaving the solid, mate- rial world behind as you begin to traverse the ethereal and some- times illusory Path that connects the Active World with the astral plane. The Path is unfamiliar and unnerving, sometimes pressing in-other times expanding out to the edges of the universe. It is dark and full of shadows, but the powerful beam of light from the lamp of Anubis is there to guide and support you. In the echoing distance you hear Horus speak: The Sphinx of Egypt spake and said: \"I am the synthesis of the Ele- mental Forces. I am also the symbol of Man. I am Life and I am Death. I am the Child of the Night of Time.\" Anubis leads you back around to the East to the station of the Hierophant. The fig- ure of the Hierophant rises like a powerful gust of wind.

A gentle breeze washes over you as she does so. Visualize the sigil at your heart center as your aura is filled temporarily with a yel- low Light. Take up the fan at the station of the Hierophant and trace the sigil in the air before you. The figure speaks once more: In the sign of the Man and in the name of the Kerub ADAM, Child of Air, thou art purified. Pass thou on. Anubis leads you once around the temple, through the blue-violet which colors the Path of Tau. After your experience with the Kerub, the shadows of the Path resume their play, yet they do not distract you from the light of the Keryx's lantern. Again you hear Horus speak: I am OSIRIS, the Soul in twin aspect, united to the Higher by purifi- cation, perfected by suffering, glorified through trial.

He thrusts between you and Anubis, halting your passage with the Banner of the West and the red lamp. The majestic figure speaks to you: 67 In the original Order Manuscripts, the names given here were Nu and Hormaku. Nu is a male Deity, whereas Nuet is the proper female divinity that is indicated here. Hormaku is simply a cor- rupted form of Harmachis.

The officer has taken on the appearance of a great hawk-headed figure with powerful clashing wings, dressed in a royal tunic of blue and orange. He steps in between you and Anubis, blocking your passage with the Banner of the West and the cup.

Thme leads you to the East where you replace the Banner of Light. She then leads you around the temple again, enabling you to replace all the Elements upon the altar as you circumambulate from East to South, West and North. Visualize all the great Kerubic forms that you have encountered on the Path of Tau. Like mighty pillars with outstretched wings they stand at the four quarters supporting the Vault of the Heavens, sur- rounded by a starry blue-violet tapestry.

It is the Rending of the Veil of the Tabernacle, whereon the Kerubim and the Palm Trees are depicted. It is the passing of the Gate of Eden. 241 Go to the West of the altar and focus your attention on the Tarot Key of the Uni- verse. Say: These ideas are symbolically resumed in the representation of the Twenty- first Keyof the Tarot. Within the oval formed of the 72 circles, is a female form, nude save for a scarfthat floats round her. She is crowned with the Lunar Crescent of Isis, and holds in her hands, two wands. Her legs form a cross. She is the Bride of the Apocalypse, the Qabalistic Queen of the Canticles, the Egyptian Isis or great feminine Kerubic Angel Sandalphon on the left hand of the Mercy Seat of theArk. The Wands are the directing forces of the positive and negative currents. The Seven Pointed Heptagram or Star alludes to the Seven Palaces of Assiah, the crossed legs to the symbol of the Four Letters of the Name. The surmounting crescent receives alike the influences of Geburah and Gedulah. She is the synthesis of the 32nd Path, uniting Malkuth to Yesod. The oval of the 72 smaller circles refer to the Schem ha-Mephoresch, or Seventy-two fold Name of the Deity. The twelve larger circles refer to the Zodiac.

PART 2: Entry into Yesod After setting up the Hall, spend a few moments more in relaxed meditation in the antechamber. Visualize the Air triangle once more and then perform the Qabalis- tic Cross. Take up the Caduceus Admission Badge. When ready, stand just outside the temple door and give the Battery of knocks: 3-3-3. Briefly visualize all of the astral officer / godforms at their respective stations. Then imagine Thme and Anu- bis at the entrance facing you. Anubis bids you to enter. Remain just inside the door. You hear the voice of Osiris from the East: Frater Periclinus de Faustis (Soror Pericline de Faustis), as in the Zelator grade there were given the symbolic representations of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, of the Gate of Eden and of the Holy Place, so in this grade of Theoricus, the Sanctum Sancto- rum with the Ark and the Kerubim is shown, as well as the Garden of Eden with which it coincides; while in the 32nd Path leading hereunto, through which you have just symbolically passed the Kerubic Guardians are represented, and the Palm Trees or Trees of Progression in the Garden of Eden. Thme leads you to the West and places you before the Portal of the 32nd Path of Tau by which you have symbolically entered. She gestures for you to face the sta- tion of Hiereus. Horus questions you: -, By what symbol dost thou enter herein? (You answer holding up the Admission Badge:) I enter by the pecu- liar emblem of the Keryx, which is the Caduceus of Hermes. The Tree of Lifeand the Three Mother Letters are the Keys wherewith to unlock the Caduceus of Hermes.

Thme leads you to the West of the altar facing East.Stillholding the Caduceus Badge, observe the emblems upon the altar for a few moments. Visualize the following: In your mind's eye see yourself again at the end of the indigo Path of Tau, facing the Gate to the astral temple of Yesod. A large violet door is in front of you. Carved into it is the letter Yod painted in yellow. The winged Kerubim are at either side of you, blocking your final passage into Yesod with the BannEjr of the West. You hold up the Caduceus Lamen and proclaim that you have received the Title of Lord/Lady of the 32nd Path. The Banner of the West is removed and the Kerubim permit you final entrance into Yesod. Astrally, you give the Neophyte Signs followed by the Sign of a Theoricus and then step through the door into Yesod. The temple is a nine-sided chamber colored in rich violet tones. Anine-sided polygon is etched into the floor,while quartz and ebony diagrams of the phases of the moon are etched into the ceil- ing. A hint of Jasmine is in the Air, and in the center of the room you notice a silver altar upon which is the sacred flame of the temple. The mighty Kerubim are also here, but their appearance has also changed. They are now seen to have many wings and many eyes. Whereas before each Kerub had the face of one of the Ele- mental creatures (human, lion, eagle and bull), now each Kerub has the faces of all four. Two pairs of wings grace the bodies of each Kerub, two wings stretched upward and two outward, covering their sides. The glories surrounding the creatures are like sparkling ice, and a flaming light flickers back and forth between the crea- tures. Only the flashing colors of their tunics suggest which Ele- ment each individual Kerub is associated with. The Archangel Gabriel is here as well, a dark-haired femi- nine Angel dressed in robes of blue and violet trimmed with orange and yellow. S/he leads you to a silver curtain at the far end of the temple. Giving the Sign of the Spiraling Light, you step through the curtain. You step out into the Courtyard of the Tabernacle that you first encountered in the preceding initiation. You walk past the altar of Sacrifice and the Laver of Brass and enter the outer cham- ber of the Holy Place before the golden altar where you previously offered up incense. The familiar table of Shewbread and the Seven- branched Candlestick are in the North and South respectively. You still have some of the coals and incense from your previous journey"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"246 SELF-INITIATION INlO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON to this place. Pouring them out upon the altar flame, you visualize yourself performing the Qabalistic Cross. You then approach the inner chamber of the Most Holy Place. The embroidered veil which separates the two chambers opens and you are afforded a view of the sacred Ark of the Covenant. The long wooded chest inlaid with gold is just as you remember it. The golden winged Kerubs Sandalphon and Metatron stoop protectively over the Ark. Above the upper lid or Mercy Seat of the Ark is a brilliant glowing white Light, the glory of the Divine Presence or Shekinah. As you gaze into this Divine Light, you are permitted a glimpse of the Garden of Eden: from the brilliant crown of Kether flows a sparkling river of clear pure Water. This river nourishes the bountiful growth of all varieties of plant and animal life. Grains, wildflowers and various types of trees are found here. The shining river splits into four heads, which divide the Garden into four quarters of East (Air), West (Water), North (Earth) and South (Fire). There is a sudden flash of lightning in the Garden which activates a vision of the Tree of Life. In rapid succession the spheres are formed one after the other as the bolt of lightning ani- mates them. Once formed, the Tree of Life in your vision of the Gar- den, divides into three parts: the spheres on the right-hand side form a pillar of brilliant Flame, the spheres on the left-hand side form a pillar of dark swirling clouds, and the spheres in the center of the Tree are calm and still. As you visualize the Tree, you notice a serpent slowly weaving its way up the branches of the Tree starting at the base of Malkuth, patiently exploring each upraised twig. The entire vision gradually fades into the brilliant Light above the Mercy Seat of the Ark. The curtain before you closes and obscures once more the Ark and its attending Kerubim. You are once again in the astral temple of Yesod. Bring the focus of your conscious mind back to the Theoricus Hall. Perform the Adoration to the Lord of the Universe. The officer-form of the Hierophant comes to the East of the altar to indicate the diagrams thereupon. When you are ready, direct your attention to the items on the altar and continue: The symbols before me represent alike the Garden of Eden and theHolyof Holies. Before me stands the Tree of Life formed of the Sephiroth and their connecting Paths. It is the Key of all things when rightly understood. Upon each Sephirah are written in Hebrew letters, its Name, the Divine Names and those of Angels and Archangels attributed thereto. The con- necting Paths are twenty-two in number and are distinguished by the Twenty-Two Letters of the Hebrew alphabet, making with the Ten Sephi- roth themselves the Thirty-two Paths of Wisdom of the Sepher Yetzirah."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"The Theoricus Grade The course of the Hebrew letters, as placed on the Paths forms the symbol of the Serpent of Wisdom, while the natural succession of the Sephiroth forms the Flaming Sword and the course of the Lightning Flash. The cross within the triangle, apex downwards, placed upon the altarat the base of the Tree of Life, refers to the Four Rivers of Paradise, whilethe angles of the triangles refer to the Three Sephiroth: Netzach, Hod and Yesod. The Two Pillars, right and left of the Tree are the symbols of active and passive, male and female, Adam and Eve. They also allude to the Pil- lars of Fire and Cloud which guidedthe Israelites in the wilderness, and the hot and moist natures are further marked by the Red Lamp and the Cup of Water. The Pillars further represent the two Kerubim of the Ark-the right, METATRON, male-and the left, SANDALPHON, female. Abovethem everburn the Lamps of their Spiritual Essence, of which they are partak- ers in the Eternal Uncreated One. 247 The form of the Hierophant in the East stands in the Sign of Theoricus. The voice of Osiris is heard: Glory be unto Thee, Lord of the Land of Life, for Thy Splendor filleth the Universe. Osiris comes around to the West of the altar to give you the secrets of the 2 = 9 grade: The 2 = 9 grade of Theoricus is referred to Yesod, as the Zelator grade is to Malkuth. The Path between them is assigned to the letter Tau, whose portal in the West you have just symbolically passed. Prompted by the figure, you exchange the grip of the First Order, which was revealed to you in the preceding grade. Osiris then prompts you to give the Sign of Theoricus and explains: This Sign emulates a figure supporting a great weight. It represents you in the Path ofYesod, supporting the Pillars of Mercy and Sever- ity. It is the Sign made by the Greek god Atlas, who supported the universe on his shoulders and whom Hercules was directed to emulate. It is the Isis of Nature, supporting the Heavens. (The figure continues:) The Grand Word is a name of seven letters SHADDAI EL CHAI, which means the Almighty and Living One.

Aspects help to determine how Planets interact within the Signs and houses. When Planets are located at a certain number of degrees away from one another, they are said to be in aspect. Some aspects are harmonious and congenial, while others are conflicting and challenging. The harmonious aspects are mild, benign and comfortable. The con- flicting aspects are exciting, stress-producing and sometimes disagreeable. It should be kept in mind that there is no such thing as a \"good\" or \"bad\" aspect. Too many harmonious aspects in a chart can often signify a boring per- sonality. Too many conflicting aspects in a chart can make a person spiteful and mean-spirited. On the other hand a few challenging aspects can strengthen a per- son's character and make life more stimulating. In astrology, like Qabalah, the mid- dle ground provides the strongest and best support. The orb of an aspect is the number of degrees of difference from the exact angle that is permitted for each aspect. In other words, it is the number of degrees within which an aspect is judged to be effective. However, the strongest influence is ~ Conjunction rf Opposition * Sextile Semi-sextile D Square 7\\ Inconjunct"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"252 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN 1'RADmoN felt when the aspect is closer (or exact) in relation to the angle. An exact aspect is called partile. A wide or weak aspect is called platie. Example of an orb in a horoscope: Mercury at 28 0 Aries conjunct Mars at 2 0 Taurus. An orb of'JO is allowable for the aspect of conjunction. In this instance the orb is 4 0 • Some aspects are more important in delineating a horoscope than others. Here we will only be concerned with the seven major aspects of conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition, semi-sextile and inconjunct.w The following is a brief description of the aspects: CONJUNCTION Angle: 0 0 Orb: 7 0 Considered: Favorable or Unfavorable Key word: EMPHASIS Conjunction occurs when two or three Planets are situated within an orb of 7 degrees. Normally Planets in a conjunction are all within the same Sign, however, they can sometimes be found in adjacent Signs. This aspect gives more emphasis to a Sign. Its action is direct and obvious. The more Planets involved, the greater the emphasis. When two Planets are very close in proximity, their energies combine and become almost indistinguishable. Conjunctions are considered favorable or unfavorable depending on which Plan- ets are involved, and whether or not those Planets are harmonious or opposite in character. Other words used to describe this aspect are intensification, fresh activ- ity and concentration. (A conjunction of three or more Planets is called a stellium.) SQUARE Angle: 90 0 Orb: 7 0 Considered: Unfavorable Key word: CHALLENGE A square occurs when two Planets are 90 degrees (or three Signs) apart. In this aspect, the energies of two Planets clash with one another, each trying to make the other conform to its manner of activity. Squares are the tension factors of a Zodiacal chart. Misunderstood, they can be difficult obstacles in one's path. Rightly under- stood they can be catalysts for decision and movement. Squares signify action: in Cardinal squares this action is swift, in Kerubic squares it is gradual and cautious, and in Mutable squares, the action is changeable and influenced by other factors. (A T-square or T-eross occurs when three Planets are involved, two of which are in opposition. A grand square or grand eross occurs when four Planets are involved, with two pairs in opposition.) 68 The minor aspects include: parallel, semi-sextile, nonagon, semi-square, septile, quintile, sesqui- square and biquintile. These do not impact the horoscope as strongly as the major aspects and are listed here only for future reference."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"The Theoricus Grade 253 OPPOSITION Angle: 180 0 Orb: 7 0 Considered: Unfavorable Key word: PERCEPTION Opposition is the widest aspect. This aspect occurs when two Planets are 180 degrees (six Signs) apart. This results in a \"stand off\" or stalemate between two Planets. Opposition delineates rival factors in conflict, which if reconciled can bal- ance each other through the virtue of their polarity. The inherent value of opposi- tion is to cultivate awareness and understanding. This involves the recognition of imbalances within oneself and using the counterbalance of the two Signs involved to equilibrate the problem. Compromise between the polarized forces is achieved through cooperation. TRINE Angle: 120 0 Orb: 70 Considered: Favorable Key word: HARMONY A trine occurs when two Planets are 120 degrees (four Signs) apart. This most favorable aspect allows easy interaction between the Planets involved, both of which when trined share a similarity of purpose. Trines allude to creativity, inspi- ration, balance, ease of movement, pleasure, and the natural flow of things. This is not always positive, however, since the lack of tension between Planets means that there is no obligation to use the Planets to one's advantage. This may result in complacency and the inclination to choose the path of least resistance. (A grand trine occurs when three Planets are in trine with one another, all in the same triplicity or Element. An Example would be a grand Water trine, where the Planets involved would be positioned in all three Water Signs of Cancer, Scor- pio and Pisces.) INCONJUNCT (quincunx> Angle: 150 0 Orb: 50 Considered: Unfavorable Key word: ADAPTATION The inconjunction occurs when two Planets are 150 degrees (five Signs) apart. The Signs involved within this aspect are totally unrelated to each other. They do not share the same element, quality or gender (active/passive). Since they have little in common, it is difficult to harmonize their energies. Inconjunct is the most difficult aspect to understand because its effects are not as noticeable as those of the other \"unfavorable\" aspects. There is a perception of slight tension and disharmony that is hard for the conscious mind to grasp. False hopes and self-delusion can result. A person experiencing inconjunction often feels that some problem is about to be solved, yet the solution is constantly just out of reach."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"254 SELF-INmATION INIO THE GoLDEN DAWN l'RAomoN This difficult yet challenging aspect calls for a change in attitude and old familiar routines. It signifies a necessity to adjust to the conditions dictated by the Planets and the houses involved. SEXTILE Angle: 60 0 Orb: 50 Cons~ered:Favorable Key word: OPPORTUNITY A sextile occurs when two Planets are 60 degrees (two Signs) apart. This aspect characterizes Signs that are of the same elemental \"gender\": active/positive Signs or passive/negative Signs. (Water and Earth Signs can sextile each other-Air and Fire Signs can do the same.) The sextile promotes compatibility, affliation, communication, and exchange of understanding and expression between two Planets. It encourages a blending and integration between the Planetary energies resulting in cooperation. However, these qualities must be actively and consciously engaged in order to benefit from them. SEMI-SEXTILE Angle: 30 0 Orb: 1 0 Considered: Favorable Key word: SUPPORT A semi-sextile occurs when two Planets are 30 degrees (one Sign) apart. This aspect is of mixed quality-it is rhythmically favorable, yet it involves Planets located in inharmonious Signs. The two Planets will support each other in an external sense, but will not share any true inner communication. This aspect is not considered to be very strong.e Erecting a Natal Chart Once the student has committed to memory the astrological basics given in the pre- vious chapters concerning the Signs, the Planets, the houses, and the aspects, the next step is to erect a birth chart. To accomplish this, the student will need to obtain certain natal information and additional books to aid in the mathematical calcula- tions. For the purpose of this study course, we recommend that the reader begin by figuring out his/her own natal chart. One essential fact that can never be overstated is the importance of keep- ing a written record of all your horoscope calculations. Of course the student should keep a record of all magical workings, meditations, grade work, and the like, but for accurate chart casting this is imperative. Time of Birth: It is important to know the exact time of birth. A copy of your Birth Certificate which can be found on file at the State Board of Health is the most accurate record of this. Other sources include baby books, hospital records or possibly the family Bible. A written record should always be sought out, if possible."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"« Y- * Conjunction Semi-sextile Sextile 8 Q .€) D L 7\\ Square Trine Inconjunct @ Q 9 cf Opposition 9 T-Square Grand Cross The Aspects 255.

Longitude and Latitude It is important to know the longitude and latitude of the place of birth. For the purpose of geography, the Earth is sectioned by two theoretical sets of circles. The point of reference for the first set of circles is the Equator, while the focal point for the second set of circles is the Prime Meridian. The Equator circles the middle of the globe from East to West and is used to calculate distances North or South of the Equator. Circles of geographic measure- ment which occupy fixed positions North and South of the Equator are called par- allels of latitude. The Prime Meridian circles the middle of the globe from North to South and is used to measure distance East or West of the Prime Meridian (the 0 0 mark at Greenwich, England). Circles of measurement located East and West of the Prime Meridian are called meridians of longitude. For example: The City of Tampa, Florida is located at a latitude 27 0 (degrees) 57' (minutes) North of the Equator, and having a longitude of 82 0 (degrees) 27' (minutes) West of the Prime Meridian. Thus we would designate the exact location of Tampa, Florida as 82 0W27' 27 0N57'. Time Abbreviations In the science of Astrology, many abbreviated terms are used to indicate time. It would benefit the student to commit the following list to memory: ST -Standard Time DST -Daylight Saving Time ST -Sidereal or Star Time EDT-Eastern Daylight Time CST -Central Daylight Time MDT-Mountain Daylight Time LTE-Longitude Time Equivalent TCST -True Calculated Sidereal Time TLT':\"'- True Local Time Essential Reference Tools An Ephemeris-a book that provides the exact daily location of each Planet at noon or midnight for Greenwich, England (exactly 0 0 longitude). (Note: the examples given here were calculated with a noon Ephemeris.) A U.S. Atlas-which describes longitudes and latitudes in the U.S. An International Atlas which describeslongitudes and latitudes outside the U.S."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"The Theorieus Grade 257 Time Changes in the U.S.A. and Time Changes outside the U.S.A.-books which describe time zones, daylight savings time and wartime changes. (Note: some atlases already contain this information.) A book on the Tables of Houses-there are several different books describing these tables. We recommend the American Book of Tables. Calculating Time Different time zones are established along the meridians of longitude. Therefore locations having the same longitude will have the same time, no matter how far North or South they are. However, even though two cities like Tampa and Miami are both in the Eastern Time zone and use that zone to standardize time, the dis- tance between them in longitude (East-West) means that sunrise in Miami occurs earlier than sunrise in Tampa. Local Mean Time LMT or true local time is the actual time of a birth at a given location. It signifies the actual time as opposed to the clock time which is standardized for the entire time zone. LMT measures the time at the place of birth in relation to the longitude from 0 0 at Greenwich, England. In order to figure out the difference between LMT and the given clock time, distance must be converted into time. The sun takes four minutes of time to travel 60 minutes or 1 0 (degree) in longitude. (Although the exact rate of the sun's daily motion in the Zodiac can vary with the position of the earth in its orbit from as little as 57'06\" up to as much as 62'30\" in the Zodiac. ) Remember that in converting distance into time, l O is equal to one hour or 60 minutes. In order to determine the LMT the birthplace lon- gitude must be multiplied by 4 and the result divided by 60. (Later in this section, we will explain what is to be done once the LMT has been determined.) Daylight Savings Time Check a book of time changes to find out if the birth was in an area which was observing Daylight Savings Time (or War Time as it used to be called). DST sets the clock one hour ahead, so if the birth time occurred during DST, you must subtract one hour from the given time of birth before continuing with your calculations. Steps in Erecting a Natal Chart 1. Establish the date, time and place of birth. (If the exact time is not known, use the closest known time. If no birth time is known, calculate from noon, although it will be impossible to determine either the Ascendant, Midheaven or house posi- tions-thus limiting the horoscope.) 2. Determine the Ascendant and Midheaven. These calculations follow differ- ent lines for Eastern and Western longitudes, and for AM and PM birth times. For examples, we will use individuals born at 3:00,AM or PM, local time, occurring at longitudes both East and West of the Prime Meridian, Greenwich, England. (Note:"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"258 SELF-INTIlATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRADITION For Southern latitude births, continue as prescribed below until you have the local sidereal time at birth.)69 STAGE 1: Time Conversion As you begin, you must convert the local birth time to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Check carefully to determine whether one or two hours had been added to the local standard time at the time of birth, as in the case of Daylight Savings Tune or Summer Time. (The Book of Time Changes will list this information.) The extra hour or two added should be subtracted from the True Local Time (TLT) before contin- uing the calculations. West of Prime Meridian Place of birth-Buffalo, NY (79 0 West--43° North) 3~ 3PM To convert to GMT,S hours must be added-the difference between GMT and EST (Eastern Standard TIme). East of Prime Meridian Place of birth-Athens, Greece (24 0 East-38° North) 3~ 3PM To convert to GMT, 2 hours must be subtracted-the difference between GMT and local time. 3AMEST plus 5 hours = 8AMGMT 3PMEST plus 5 hours = 8PMGMT 3 AM Local TlUle minus 2 hours = 1 AM GMT 3 PM Local TlUle minus 2 hours = 1 PM GMT STAGE 2: Finding Local Sidereal Time at Birth After converting the birth time to Greenwich Mean Time, another conversion is needed. You must now calculate the equivalent sidereal time at Greenwich. Sidereal Time refers to the actual time taken by the Earth to complete a total revolution upon its axis, as opposed to the 24-hour divisions of the day that we use for a con- venient measure of time. To begin this calculation we must refer to the Sidereal Time at Greenwich at noon on the date of birth. This can be found by looking in an Ephemeris (It is usually described in the Ephemeris as Sid. Time. or Sn For our examples, we will assume that the date of birth was December 16, 1954. The Ephemeris tells us that the Side- real Time at Greenwich at noon on that date was 17h 38m 23s, (17 hours 38 minutes 23 seconds). We must now find the interval between the GMT birth time and noon on that same date. (Note: If your calculations have taken you into the day following the birth date, determine the interval between the GMT time and noon of that day, not the actual birthday. If your calculations have led you into the day prior to 69 For individuals born in a Southern latitude, continue as follows: always add 12 hours to the local sidereal time. In Southern latitudes the order of the Signs must be reversed; therefore if the Table of Houses gives the Ascendant as Aries 15°12' and the Midheaven as Capricorn 5°, the true Ascendant is Libra 15°12' and the true Midheaven is Cancer 5°."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"The Theoricus Grade 2S9 the birth date, find the interval between the GMT time and noon of that day, not the actual birthday.) For our examples: 8AM-GMT count ahead to noon = 4 hours 8PM-GMT count back to noon = 8 hours lAM-GMT count ahead to noon = 11 hours IPM-GMT count back to noon = 1 hour We have obtained the Sidereal Time (ST) at the Prime Meridian at noon on the date of birth. The next step is to discover the Sidereal Time at Greenwich at the time of birth on the date of birth. In order to do this we must employ the interval time just determined, adding to or subtracting from our Sidereal Time (In our example: 17h 38m 23s), for AM-subtract, for PM-add. (Remember that if your calcula- tions have lead you into the days before or after the birth date, use the Sidereal Time at noon on that day and not that of the actual day of birth.F? For our four examples: ST at Greenwich for noon on birthday = 1711 38m 23s AM -4hrs= 13h38m23s ST at Greenwich for noon on birthday = 1711 38m 23s PM +8hrs= 25h 38m 23s ST at Greenwich for noon on birthday = 1711 38m 23sAM -l1hrs= 6h38m23s ST at Greenwich for noon on birthday = 1711 38m 23s PM +lhr= 18h 38m 23s We must now make an adjustment to allow for the difference between Sidereal and regular time. This is called the Acceleration on the Interval. This is accomplished by adding or subtracting ten seconds for every hour and one second for every six minutes of interval time, always following the rule of subtracting for AM, adding for PM. For our examples: AM: subtract PM: add AM: subtract PM: add interval = 4 hrs. interval = 8 hrs. interval = 11hrs interval = 1 hr. Accel on Inter.= 40s. Accel on Inter. = 80s. Accel on Inter. = 110s. Accel on Inter.= lOs. 13h 37m 83s 25h38m 23s 6h36m 143s 18h 38m 23s -4Os + 80s -1105 +105 = 13h37m 43s =2Sh39m43s = 6h36m33s = 18h38m 33s ST at Greenwich ST at Greenwich ST at Greenwich ST at Greenwich This tells us the Sidereal Time at the Prime Meridian for the time of birth. Next we must convert this to determine the Sidereal Time for the time of birth at the place of birth. The difference in time depends on the distance between Greenwich and the place of birth. This is known as the Longitude Equivalent in Time. To arrive at that figure we multiply the birthplace longitude by 4, naming the resulting num- bers hours, minutes, and seconds; thus converting longitude distance into time: 70 If your calculations ever leave you with a negative (minus) number for the ST at Greenwich, add 24 hours."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"260 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoWEN DAWN 'fRADmoN Buffalo, NY Longitude = 79 0 West 79 0 x4 =316 0 Divided by 60 = 5h 16m (in time) Athens, Greece Longitude = 24 0 East 24 0 x 4 =96 0 Divided by 60 = 1h 36m (in time) The next step is to add or subtract the longitude equivalent in time to / from the Sidereal Tune at Greenwich for the time of birth. For East we add, for West we subtract. For our four examples: ST at Greenwich = 13h37m43s West-subtract -5h 16m =8h21m43s LOCAL SID.

TIME AT BIRTH ST at Greenwich = 18h 38m 33s East-add + 1h36m =20h 14m33s LOCAL SID. TIME AT BIRTH The Local Sidereal Time at birth and at the place of birth, is a crucial factor for determining the Ascendant and the Midheaven. It is now a simple matter of referring to the Tables of Houses (listed in The American Book of Tables) which tabulate the Ascendant and Midheaven for various latitudes. Our four examples would show: ABc = 27° a MC = 3° cfl ABc = 28° C) MC = 4° ::::::::: ABc = 27° a MC = 1° cfl ABc = 21° a MC = 2° ::::::::: 3. Drawing up the Natal chart. On a blank Zodiacal chart, like the one shown which is marked off into degrees, draw in the Horizon line using a straight edge and pencil. This will intersect the circle on the left and right (Zodiacal East and West). If the Ascending Sign is 27 0 , count 27 0 down from the cusp of the Ascen- dant or Rising Sign. Then count 27 0 up from the cusp of the Sign opposite the Ascendant. Draw the Horizon line connecting these two points on the chart. Draw in the symbol, degree and minute of the Ascendant Sign. Mark off the degree of the Ascendant in each section of the chart, counter- clockwise around the chart, and join each marked point to its opposite on the other side of the circle. Number these twelve (30 0 ) divisions counter-clockwise, with the first house situated immediately below the Ascendant. Draw the symbols of the twelve Signs in the outer circle, in counter-clock- wise order, beginning from the Ascendant Sign. (For example if the Ascendant Sign is 27 0 Libra, the next divisions reading counter-clockwise below Libra would be Scorpio, Sagittarius, etc.) Place the Midheaven in the appropriate Sign, marking it with the letters MC, along with the degree and minute. The letters IC should be drawn at the opposite point on the Chart."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Short form for Erecting a Natal Chart Name Day Month Year Birthdate Birthplace Latitude Longitude STAGE 1: Time Conversion Birthtime as given \"a.m., p.m. Zone Standard ·(East -, West +) \"Summer (or Double) Time (-) Greenwich Mean Time \"a.m., p.m. Greenwich Mean Time date Day Month Year (If altered by conversion) STAGE 2: Finding Local Sidereal Time at Birth Hours Minutes Seconds Sidereal Time noon G.M.T.

Once these principles are understood, the final step is to learn how to interpret or delineate all the information that comprises a horoscope. Much of this interpretive knowledge comes through reasoning, common sense and an understanding of human nature. It includes the ability to call to mind key phrases and words which are associated with each Sign, Planet and house. No matter what Sign a Planet may be located in/ the natural Sign of the house involved also lends its influence to the interpretation. For example: Mer- cury in Taurus in the fifth house. The key word for Mercury is reasoning powers. Other words describing Mercury include communication and awareness. The key- word for Taurus is stability. Other Taurean words include practical and sensual. The fifth house is the house of creativity, love and pleasure. Leo, the natural Sign of the fifth house is associated with the keywords magnetism, charitable and self-confident."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"270 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON One can therefore summarize Mercury in Taurus in the fifth house (of Leo) in the sentence: The stable and practical faculty of reason and awareness will be displayed creatively with self-confidence, (or) communication of pleasures and love will be given with charity and sensuality. For another example: Jupiter in Cancer in the third house. Important words for Jupiter are expansion, philosophy, and prosperity. Key words for Cancer are devo- tion, nurturing, and sensitive. The third house is the house of conscious awareness and communication. Gemini, the natural Sign of the third house is associated with the keywords versatile, literary and inquisitive. Thus Jupiter in Cancer in the third house (of Gemini) can be described as: The philosophical nurturing urge of this individual will be communicated with great ver- satility and skill, (or) Sensitive awareness and devotion to higher philosophical ideals will lead to expansion of literary pursuits. (Of course no Astrologer would use such convoluted language while talk- ing to a Querent. In simpler terms, a person with this placement of Jupiter in the chart will tend to talk a lot about his/her feelings.) Oftentimes house placement of a Planet will modify the influences of cer- tain Signs in which the Planet is located. For instance Venus in Aries in the tenth house (Capricorn rules the tenth house). Aries is Aggressive and Impulsive. Venus symbolizes affections, and social pursuits. The tenth house refers to honor, ambition, and profession. Capricorn is conservative and prudent. One might conclude that this individual's professional and social pursuits would be approached in an aggres- sive fashion, however the prudent nature of Capricorn would serve to temper the impulsiveness of Aries. A Planet will also function differently depending upon whether the house it is located in is Angular, Succedent or Cadent. An individual with Sun in Scorpio will be less temperamental and more easy-going when the Sun in Scorpio falls within a Cadent (Mutable) house rather than a Succedent (Kerubic or Fixed) house. An Angu- lar (Cardinal) house placement might still indicate a temperament that is still volatile but not long lasting. The houses are the constant variables in a horoscope. The Signs and the Planets do not change their basic characteristics; it is always the houses which are the various arenas for activity, and they are subject to change quite a bit. The only way to truly learn how to interpret a Zodiacal chart is through constant practice. We highly recommend that the student obtain some good books on horoscope interpretation, including the series The Only Way to Learn Astrology (vol. 1-3) by Marion D. March and Joan McEvers. A Zodiacal chart should bring questions to the Astrologer's mind. While interpreting the chart, the Astrologer should dialogue with the Querent and ask for answers to those questions in order to ground him/her self within the frame- work of the Querent's circumstances and worldview first. Then the Astrologer reads the possibilities which are apt to apply to the Querent. Using the techniques mentioned here, the student is encouraged to look at several different horoscopes and try to delineate each one in accordance with the information s/he has accumulated through the Knowledge Lectures."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"The Theoricus Grade 271 Aspecting The influence of the aspects must also be examined when interpreting a chart. It is important to remember that aspects are calculated by counting Signs (not by counting houses), and each Sign has thirty degrees. In addition, if a Planet is in its dignity or exaltation, it can manage all aspects in a more harmonious fashion. To find the aspects, take the degree position of each Planet, then proceed to add and subtract seven degrees, the widest possible orb permitted for most of the major aspects. (Some aspects have an orb of only five degrees or one degree.) Deter- mine if any Planets form an aspect with each other within the allowed orb of degrees. The following list includes two examples of aspects: V 16° nef d'11°><\" 4- 4° cfl D:> 28° rr Example One: Mercury 16 0 Gemini is in opposition to Mars 11 0 Sagittar- ius. Example Two: Jupiter 4 0 Leo is square to Saturn 28 0 Aries. The aspects can be interpreted using the same techniques mentioned above-the knowledge of keywords for the Signs, the Planets, the houses and the aspects. (Squares are always stressful and challenging, trines are always harmo- nious, etc.) Aspects which encompass two different Signs can occur at the beginning or end of a Sign. This is an aspect out of Sign, so long as it is still within the per- mitted orb of degrees. A forming or applying aspect occurs when one Planet is said to move toward another (toward an exact aspect). A separating or waning aspect occurs when one Planet is said to move beyond another (past an exact aspect). The form- ing aspect is the stronger of the two. The faster-moving Planet (active) is always listed before the slower-moving one (passive). A forming aspect indicates some- thing that you are advancing towards. A separating aspect refers to something that has been recently experienced. Solar aspects are very important to the character makeup of the individual. However all aspects shed light upon the personality, since they are in fact respon- sible for forming the individual's basic personality. The more exact the aspect, the more it helps to shape the essential character. Aspects indicate capabilities, inclina- tions and hindrances, rather than achievements. The birth chart alludes to a per- son's potential. However it is up to the individual to make use of that potential.e"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"272 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GOLDEN DAWN TRADmON SECTION 2: Basic Alchemy Alchemical Operations ~ The goal of Alchemy (both practical and mystical) is to obtain the Quintessence. This is accomplished in a number of stages. First, the material to undergo the process of transmutation exists with a state of Chaos (Void) which must be separated and categorized to fit into the fourfold model of the Elements. The alchemist then uses reason to apply this same fourfold model to the First Matter, intellectually structuring it into the divisions of the four Elements. The Spirit or First Essence (Spiritus Mundi) is then drawn out of the First Matter (implanted within the Alchemist s psyche). This Hidden Essence is then divided or broken down (through the Unbodied Volatile) into the Triad of the Alchemical Principles (Mer- cury, Salt and Sulfur). At length the Quintessence, which is the synthesis of these Three Principles as well as the sustaining Life Force, is obtained. There are four colors associated with four distinct stages in alchemical transmutation of metals. In applied or practical Alchemy these stages are identi- fied by the colors shown forth by the Prime Matter as it undergoes the process of transmutation. During these various levels the metals or materials used are said to undergo a drastic change in appearance, becoming a mud or slime and then a powder. These stages are also related to the four elements. In order they are: MELANOSIS: Blackening (Earth) also called Nigredo. LEUKOSIS: Whitening (Water) also called Albedo. XANTHOSIS: Yellowing (Air) also called Citrinitas. IOSIS: Reddening (Fire) also called Rubedo. (Note: by the sixteenth century these colors were reduced to three the yellowing stage was dropped, resulting in a triad of colors: black, white and red.) Melanosis is the first state, which is either present from the onset as a quality of the Prime Matter, or obtained from of a process of separation, death, dissolution or putrefaction. The next stage is Leukosis, which signifies a washing or cleansing process, a resurrection and the release of the pure essence. (This results in the white tincture or Lunar essence symbolized by the White Queen.) The final stage is Iosis, which results from the raising of heat to its highest intensity. (The Red King or Solar essence is the symbol here.) Other colors may also be seen in the process. These additional colors rep- resent intermediate states in the process. The four colors listed above are usually the only recognized colors in Alchemical work. After the black stage of Melanosis, the color blue may be seen, which is considered a feminine aspect, indicative of Height and Depth. After the red stage of Iosis, the color of violet may be seen to indicate the limit of the process. The colors of Alchemy can be associated to the Planets in the following manner:"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"The Theoricus Grade BLACK: Saturn (lead) BLUE: Jupiter (tin) PEACOCK'S TAIL: (multi-eolored) Mercury (quicksilver) WHITE: Luna (silver) YELLOW: Venus (copper) RED: Mars (iron) VIOLET: Sol (gold) 273 In addition to the four color stages, there are different gates or basic stages of process used in applied Alchemy. Different Alchemists have divided the various stages of process into groups of five, seven, eight or twelve gates. The following is one of the systems which employs seven gates: 1. Calcination Mercury 2. Sublimation Saturn 3. Solution Jupiter 4. Putrefaction Luna 5. Distillation Mars 6. Coagulation Venus 7.

The process loosens the structure of certain substances, volatilizing the solids which are thus loos- ened by the solvent. CONGEALATION: Reducing the substance to liquid which then thickens. The liquefied matter congeals or solidifies. CONJUNCTION: Joining the principles. Amalgamating the various elements. DESPONSATION: The separation of liquids in a vessel. DIGESTION: A mixture for the purpose of drawing out the Essence from the different substances. DISSOLUTION: Dissolving the metals. Indicates letting time and nature do the work. A slow separation of a metal into its components in a liquid. DISTILLATION: Also called Circulation or Rectification because it entails a con- tinuous cycle (rising and falling). The process of boiling a liquid until it is vaporized, and then recondensed by cooling. The rising vapor is consid- ered the Spirit of the substance. This process liberates the original metal from its corrupted state, while giving it new properties. The energy inher- ent in the rising vapors generates the multi-eolors of the Peacock's tail. The substance is then heated more vigorously until it dries up into a grayish- black mass. When the color white is seen, it signifies that the process of coagulation is about to commence. (In mystical Alchemy, distillation entails the liberation of the Soul from the grip of the Lower Ego. This trans- formation implies that the ego has become purified and compliant to the Higher Self.) EXALTATION: To elevate the Power of Virtue in the hope that the substance will transmute. FERMENTATION: Adding the required precious metal as a yeast to the Philoso- pher's Stone enabling it to transmute base metals into this particular pre- cious metal. It is associated with putrefaction and decay, but also the work of Transformation and regeneration-Death which leads to Life. (In mysti- cal Alchemy, fermentation implies the liberation of intuitive powers and the creation of dreams.) LIGATION: Separation in a sealed vessel. MULTIPLICATION: Raising the quantity and quality of the powder or stone. PROJECTION: The work of transmutation into gold and silver. PUTREFACTION: The first change to be seen. The appearance of blackness. ROTATION: Rhythmic cycling of the process of circulation. It entails the boiling of a liquid for a set period of time in a reflux system. The liquid is allowed to cool, reheated, and allowed to cool again, etc. SEPARATION: Separating the light parts from the heavy parts. The slow separa- tion of a body into its components in a liquid. SOLUTION: Dissolving a solid into a liquid. SUBLIMATION: Extraction by volatilization or distillation. This process entails forcing an extract upwards into the upper portion of a container where it is allowed to precipitate. Also called Rectification."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"The Theoricus Grade Sigils of Minerals and other Materials €a Copper Chlate cf Pulvis (dust) db Magnet, Lodestone <5 Antimony X Talc @ Saltpeter 80 Oil A Volatile V Fixed 9 Tartarus ~ DeadHead D Urina (Urine) c:J Borax (j Hematite ff sugar [J Black Ink 9t Roots ~ Iron Filings 0 Aluminum CD Nitrum (soda) m Camphor <9 Vitriol ~ Ammonia ~ Crystals co Gold pigment 00 Arsenic -¢- Wax ~ Mercury Solid 2= Refined Mercury <;( Orichalcum 0- Glass 0\"t7 Magnesia $ Common Salt t Cinis (ashes) If Potash t Vinegar ..r... , ~ Alcohol solution V Spirits of Wme Lead Acetate l Quicksilver f Metal Oxide m Herb Quick-sulphur ~ Red Lead Oxide L Quintessence £ Powder Sophie Sulphur Q Liquor , Distilled Vmegar 600 Charcoal ...

In the Theoricus grade the initiate is exposed to the Sephirah Yesod and the World of Formation known as Yetzirah. (Review the information given on Yetzirah in Chapter Two.) Yetzi- rah is the world of the astral plane, an immaterial realm close in proximity to our own. Both Angelic beings and the illusionary images given form by the mind of humanity are to be found there. Astral Spirits Astral Spirits are those belonging to the astral plane. Such are the false and illu- sionary forms, shells of the dead, and ghosts and phantoms. They are detached and nonconscious beings. The human Soul is composed of several \"layers.\" The outer layers govern a person's day-to-day habits, routines, spoken thoughts, and memories. After death, the higher parts of the Soul continue on the journey of spiritual evolution to the next level or plane of existence, while the lower parts usually dissipate. Occasionally, however, these outer shells are inhabited by an Elemental or similar astral being. This \"ghost\" then continues where it is and carries on with certain habits and routines. Over time these phantoms will tend to disintegrate unless infused with fresh energy by a person or situation. Many people claim that they can be ban- ished simply by telling these entities that their physical bodies have ceased to exist, and the remaining portion is free to leave. Elemental Spirits Elemental Spirits are those belonging to the nature of the Elements. Tradition has it that some are good and some are evil (although such labels don't really apply to Elementals). These beings (already discussed in Chapter Two) have hierarchies similar to those of Qabalistic Archangels and Angels. Elementals are thought to be childlike and innocent with respect to the human realm. Angels and Archangels An Angel is a pure and high Spirit of unmixed good in office and operation. In the Qabalah, Angels and Archangels are considered specific aspects of God, each with a particular purpose and jurisdiction. They are anthropomorphic symbols of what we believe to be good or holy. Nearly all of the Hebraic Angels have the suffixes \"el\" or \"yah\" at the end of their names, indicating that they are \"of God.\" Powerful Angels which govern large groups or hosts of lesser Angels are known as Archangels. The Soul The difference between the Soul and the Spirit in humanity is as follows: The human Soul adjoins both the inner realm of Spirit from which it receives direct inspiration, and the physical or outer world from which it obtains impressions.

But as the individual steadily shifts his/her awareness to the knowledge of the Divine Light, the Soul undergoes purification that enables it to more easily connect with the Divine Spirit that is the source of all life. The Greeks referred to the Soul as the Psyche while the Egyptians referred to it as the Ba. The Spirit The Spirit (from the Latin Spiritis, meaning \"breath\") is the divine center in humanity. It is the material essence, animating key, or absolute pattern of an indi- vidual human life, which is eternal. The Greeks referred to this undying Spirit within each individual as Nous, the universal mind of God. Other Greek terms for Spirit include daimon and pneuma while the Egyptians refered to it as the Khu. The Egyptian HSoul\" To the ancient Egyptians, there were several parts which made up the composite human being. The physical body was called the Khat, which implied something that was subject to decay. Attached to the Khat was the Ka. The Ka was the etheric dou- ble or \"body of habits.\" It could be defined as an abstract personality endowed with the characteristics of a person, but which had an independent existance. The Ka was also supposed to have lived on after the body, so provisions were left for it in the tomb. (Some people equate the Ka with the astral body or Body of Light-the part of the Soul that can be used as a vehicle for ascending the astral planes.) The Ba or Soul which dwelt in the Ka, was the seat of life in human beings. The word Ba implies something noble, sublime or mighty. Having the qualities of both substance and form, the Ba was free to leave the tomb and ascend to heaven. The Ba had the power to become corporeal or incorporeal at Will, and it was usually represented as a hawk with a human head. The Khu was the immortal Spirit or spiritual intelligence of a human being. The word implies something shining or luminous and was symbolized by a plume of flame. The Khu, like the Ka, could be imprisoned in the tomb, so magical formulae were used to keep this from occurring. The Sekhem (meaning: \"to have mastery or power over something\") was a person's vital force or strength personified. This part, like the Khu, also ascended to heaven. The Khaibit or \"shadow\" was thought to be near a person's Soul. Finally, the Ren or name was consider by the Egyptians to be very important, since a nameless person could not enter into the company of the gods. Preservation of the name insured immortality. Planetary Intelligences and Spirits In Planetary magic, an Intelligence is referred to as a guiding Angelic force which is directed in tum by a ruling Planetary Archangel. A Planetary Spirit is a blind force which can be used for good or ill. To insure that the Spirit is used for positive purposes, it should never be invoked without first invoking the Planetary Intelli- gence (or guiding principlej.o"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"278 SELF-INmATION IN10 THE GoLDEN DAWN 'TRAomoN SECTION 4: Qabalah-The Parts of the Soul The Soul is divided by the Qabalists into three principal parts. These are the Neshamah, the Ruach, and the Nephesh. The NESHAMAH (nQet~) is the first and highest part, answering to the three Supernal Sephiroth of Kether, Chokmah and Binah. It corre- sponds to the highest aspirations of the Soul, and what Freud called the superego. The Neshamah is further subdivided into three parts. These are the Yechidah (n,~n~), the Chiah (n~n), and the Neshamah (nQet~). The Yechidah is centered in Kether. It is our true and immortal Divine Self. The Chiah, located in Chokmah is our inquisitive urge to become more than human-it is our True Will. Both the Yechidah and the Chiah are archetypal in essence and thus they are somewhat beyond the scope of our understanding. The final subdivision, the Neshamah is placed in Binah, although it lends its name to the other Supernals as being generally descriptive of the Soul's greatest aspira- tions. This is our true desire or highest state of consciousness-the intuitive power that connects humankind with the Divine. According to the ancient Qabalists, this part of the Soul remains dormant in the average person until s/he awakens spiri- tually and uncovers the powers of mystical comprehension. The descent of the Neshamah into the student's field of awareness occurs through the \"holy union\" of the \"king\" and \"queen,\" (Tiphareth and Malkuth). A dialogue between the Higher Self and the Lower Self must be opened up for this descent to occur. RUACH: (m.,) The middle part of the Soul is located in the five Sephiroth from Chesed to Yesod, although it is centered in Tiphareth. This is the conscious part of our being which is also known as the Ego. It is the mind and reasoning powers, as well as the seat of \"outer\" consciousness, where humanity becomes aware of thought-images and is able to fashion thoughts into actions. The Ruach represents an intermediate stage between the highest and lowest portions of the Soul where the ethical power to distinguish between good and evil is called into play. It is here where the individual can choose to focus either on secular and tem- porary desires, or on higher spiritual goals. NEPHESH: (etll~) The lowest part of the human Soul resides in Yesod. This is the dark side or Shadow-self of the Soul, answering unto the animal vital- ity and primal instincts. It is however a very important part which ties humanity to the physical world of the elements and our animal ancestors. Entering the human body at birth, the Nephesh is the first part of the Soul to be activated in every human being. The Nephesh represents those basic desires that run contrary to society and to our own ideals of behavior and personality. This is the dark underside of the consciousness that dwells in the Ruach-the human mind. However, there can be no Light without Darkness, no day without night. Proper use of the vital, stimulat- ing Nephesh energy is important in some aspects of magic, but it must always remain under the firm control of the Ruach. The Lower Soul or Nephesh can arouse the Middle Soul (Ruach) which in tum can stimulate the Neshamah or Divine Soul. This triggers the descent of the Neshamah down through the lower portions of the Soul, bringing to the individual a conscious recognition of the Divine Self."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Neshamah The Divisions of the Soul 279"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"280 SELF-INITIATION INTO 1HE GoLDEN DAWN 'fRADmoN Beyond this fivefold division of the human Soul, there is one more portion that is sometimes overlooked. This lowest part is called the G'UPH (tJ~). Centered in Malkuth, the G'uph is closely tied to the physical body and the total range of all psychophysical functions. It is a low level of the subconscious which communi- cates with the brain about the current condition of the human bodyo SECTION 5: Correspondences of Yesod The 2 = 9 grade is attributed to the sphere of Yesod on the Qabal- istic Tree of Life.

This helps to rid the surrounding area of any unwanted or negative energies. But more importantly the burning of incense helps to arouse the magician's mind toward an enhanced consciousness which enables him/her to tap into a well of personal energy. It helps promote the state of mind necessary for the successful practice of magic. Some incenses are burned in order to attract particular energies to the magician. Like metals and gemstones, certain perfumes also attract the specific forces that correspond with them through vibration. However when incense is burned within a temple atmosphere it undergoes a transformation through the release of vibratory energy into the air. This released energy combined with the vitalized Will of the magician can have a potent effect upon the ritual.

He symbolized po~er and justice. His royal emblems were the scepter, the diadem, the crown, and the staff of command.

Like Anu, he had a reserved promenade in the heavens called \"Enlil's Way\" but his usual abode was the Great Mountain of the East. VUL: Assyro-Babylonian god of the atmosphere between Heaven and Earth. Vul was a god of rain, storms and whirlwinds. ADAD: A later Babylonian god who usurped Enlil's posi- tion as Lord of thunder and storm. Adad is usually depicted as standing upon a bull with a thunderbolt in each hand. NUET: (or NUT) The Egyptian sky-goddess who was sep- arated from her lover Geb (the Earth) by the Air-god Shu. She is often represented as a woman with an elongated body, who touches the earth with fingers and toes, while her star-spangled body is supported by Shu. She therefore Nuet forms the arc of the heavens. Nuet sometimes appears as a cow whose four legs are each held aloft by an appointed god. When in her human form, she often wears a round vase upon her head, the symbol of her name. Her maternal starry likeness was often painted on the inner lid of sarcophagi to watch over the deceased. SHU: The Egyptian god of Air. His name means \"to raise\" or \"he who holds up.\" Shu is the atmosphere which blankets the Earth. Equivalent to Atlas of Greek mythology, Shu is the one who supports the sky. The creation of Shu made possi- ble a space between the Heavens and the Earth, into which the sun could shine. Because the sunlight immediately fol- lowed the creation of Shu, he is sometimes identified with Light. Acting upon orders from Ra, Shu slipped between Geb and Nut, separating Earth from sky. He is always rep- resented in human form usually wearing an ostrich feather on his head. HATHOR: An Egyptian sky-goddess whose name means \"the dwelling of Horus.\" The Sun-god resided within her, being enclosed within her breast each dusk, to be born again each dawn.

The god is sometimes referred to as Nephelgeretes or \"cloud- gatherer.\" He resided in the uppermost regions of the air and on mountain tops. Later Zeus took on the characteris- tics of a supreme god who was omnipotent and all-know- ing. A wise leader of gods and men, he ruled all in accordance to the law of fate. Zeus is usually depicted as a robust mature man with a serious expression and deep set eyes. Thick hair and a curled beard frame his face and a crown of oak leaves adorns his head. Sometimes nude, but more often wearing a long mantle which uncovers his chest and right arm, the god holds a scepter in his left hand and a thunderbolt in his right. An eagle is sometime shown at his feet. HERA (equivalent to the Roman Juno): Queen of the gods. Originally a Greek sky goddess, Hera became the wife of Zeus, and the cults of the two sky-deities merged. The noisy quarrels of Zeus and Hera were reflected in the storms and atmospheric disturbances. Hera also has a connection with the three phases of the moon. She is a champion of women and fecundity. Greek Gods of the Winds: BOREAS: The North Wind, harsh and destructive, rep- resented as a winged mature man with hair floating in the wind. ZEPHYRUS: The West Wmd. Originally baleful, Zephyrus later became a sweet-scented and beneficial wind. EURUS: The East Wind. NOTUS: The South Wind. AEOLUS: Guardian and father of the winds appointed by Zeus. He was the inventor of ships' sails, who could calm or arouse the fury of the winds at will. THOR or DONAR: The Teutonic god of thunder and storm. Thor was the strongest of the gods and he is por- trayed as a tall vigorous man with a red beard traversing across the heavens in a chariot pulled by goats.

The Moon rules the subconscious mind, cycles and patterns, plant and animal life, the tides, and all instinctive processes in nature which are bar- ren of personality. All of these are rhythmically connected with the cycles of the moon, or Levannah as it is known in Hebrew. Luna is the closest \"Planet\" to the Earth and it moves rapidly through the Zodiac. It is considered a \"feminine\" and \"moist\" Planet. In an Astrological sense, Luna is said to be \"cold\" and \"magnetic.\" The ancients described the Moon as the ruler of the period of life dominated by growth from the ages of 1 to 4 and symbolized by \"the mewling babe.\" In human anatomy, this Planet rules the breasts, the stomach, the body flu- ids, female organs and functions, the lymph glands, and digestion. Physical ail- ments associated with Luna include enflamed glands, defective eyesight, allergies, female disorders, mental instability, excess fluidity and depression. Objects attributed to Luna include utensils used in the silversmith's trade, brewing and laundering; also soft smooth substances. In magic, the days and hours of the Moon are used for femininity, alterna- tion, change, receptivity, sleep, prophetic dreams, visions, messages, navigation, love, fertility, envoys, voyages, and the acquisition of merchandise by water. The Lunar cycle takes approximately 28-29 days to complete, starting with the New Moon (completely Dark Moon), to the Full Moon (the fully illumi- nated Moon). This cycle is the result of a relationship that exists between the Sun, the Moon and the Earth. As the Moon makes one entire circuit around the Earth, it reflects the Solar light in various degrees, depending on the angle between Sol and Luna as seen from the Earth. This cycle is divided into four phases or quar- ters. These phases are as follows: • The First Quarter commences when Sol and Luna are conjunct or in the same place (from the Earth's view). At first the Moon is not visible (New Moon), because it rises simultaneously with the Sun. However, toward the end of this phase, a sliver of Luna can be perceived just after sunset when the Moon follows the setting sun in the West. The Second Quarter starts midway between the New Moon and the Full Moon, when Sol and Luna are at a 90 degree square to one another. At this time the waxing (increasing) Moon is seen as a half-moon which rises at noon and sets at midnight. It is seen in the West during the fist half of the night."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"286 o (( SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON The Third Quarter commences with the Full Moon, when Sol and Luna are opposite each other and the light of Sol can illuminate the full sphere of Luna. During this phase the Moon is seen rising in the East at dusk, then rising a bit later each evening. The Fourth Quarter begins roughly midway between the Full Moon and the New Moon, when Sol and Luna are again at a 90 degree angle from each other. This waning (decreasing) Moon rises at Midnight, and can be seen in the East during the later half of the night. The meaning of the Lunar symbol on the Tree of Life is thus: In its increase, it embraces the side of Mercy; in its decrease the side of Severity, and at the full, it reflects the Sun of Tiphareth. The following is a list of Lunar associations: Hebrew Name: Levanah Sephiroth: Yesod Archangel: Gabriel Day: Monday Planetary Intelligence: Malkah be Tarshism ve-ad Ruachoth Schechalim / Shelachiel Planetary Spirit: Schad Barschemoth ha-Shartathan / Chasmodai Olympic Planetary Spirit: Phul Metal: Silver Gemstones: Moonstone, pearl, quartz, fluorspar, beryl Incenses: Camphor, aloes, jasmine Trees: Willow, bay, hazel, papaya, coconut palm, almond Herbs/plants: Lotus, opium, mushroom, poppy, gourds, moonwort Animals: Cat, hare, dog, owl Lunar Deities SIN: The Babylonian Moon god was the chief among the astral triad which included Shamesh (the Sun) and Ishtar (the Planet Venus) who were his children. Sin was known as \"He whose deep heart no god can penetrate\" because of his mysterious transformations during the Moon's various phases. The full Moon was his crown, and thus he was known as the \"Lord of the Diadem\" and \"the Shining Boat of Heaven.\" A very wise god, Sin was sometimes venerated under the name of Nannar and pictured as an old man with a long beard the color of lapis lazuli and wearing the full Moon as a crown. The bright crescent Moon was Sin's boat which navigated the night sky. KHONSU or (KHENSU): The Egyptian god of the Moon whose name means \"the Navigator\" \"the traveler\" or \"he who crosses the sky in a boat.\" Khonsu became the messenger of the great gods under the form of the Moon. Khonsu was later identified with Djehuti, another Moon god, and was called Khensu- Tehuti, the Twice Great. As the new Moon, Khonsu was likened to a mighty bull and as the"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"The Theoricus Grade 287 Khonsu Artemis full Moon, he was said to correspond to a gelded bull. As the cres- cent Moon, Khonsu shined his heavenly Light so that all female creatures would become fertile and conceive. He was thus the source of generation and reproduction. The god is sometimes por- trayed with a hawk's head, but he is usually represented swathed in mummy cloth like Osiris and holding the scepters of crook, scourge, phoenix and djed. His head is shaven except for the heavy tress of a royal child on one side. He also wears a skullcap surmounted by a disk in a crescent Moon. Later he became known as an exorcist and a healer. AAH-DJEHUTI: A form of the Egyptian god Thoth who was revered as a Moon god. He is the measurer of the seasons and the calculator of the different phases of the Moon. In the narrowest sense, this god symbolizes the new Moon (since Lunar calcula- tions are based on the new Moon) but in truth he represents the Moon in all its phases. Aah-Djehuti is portrayed as a human- headed figure wrapped in mummy cloth holding the ankh, the djed, the crook, the scourge and the phoenix wand. He has the crescent and disk on his head, in addition to a lock of hair symbolic of youth. His head has two faces which represent the waxing and waning of the Moon. Other Egyptian Deities associated with the Moon include the Great Mother god- dess ISIS and the goddess QETESH. ARTEMIS (equivalent to the Roman Diana): At first a Greek Moon goddess asso- ciated with Lunar light and the crescent Moon, (waning and waxing) she was later known as the goddess of the hunt and protectress of women who assisted in child- birth. Artemis is the goddess of untamed nature, \"Lady of the Beasts.\" Fundamen- tal to the worship of this goddess were vivacious dances and the Sacred Bough, which was probably derived from worship of the ancient Moon tree, considered a source of knowledge and immortality. At times she is depicted having many breasts, a reference to her powers of fertility. At other times she is depicted flanked by lions, dancing with a stag, or holding a slain deer in each hand. SELENE (equivalent to the Roman Luna): The primary Greek goddess of the Moon, sister of Helios, the Sun. Par- ticularly associated with the Full Moon, she was also called Mene, and her bright crown illuminated the dark night. Every evening, after the journey of Helios across the sky, Selene began her own excursion after bathing in the ocean. Then the broad-winged goddess would dress in fine robes and fly across the sky in a chariot drawn by radiant steeds or oxen. In early depictions, she is shown as a cow with the ancient horns of consecration-the crescent Moon. Selene is sometimes shown mounted on a horse, a bull or a mule."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"288 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GOLDEN DAWN TRADmON Hecate HECATE: A powerful Greek Moon goddess who presided over navigation, enchantments and magic, and was referred to as the mother of witches. This goddess was par- ticularly associated with the Dark New Moon. She later became known as a goddess of the underworld, ruling over ghosts and demons. Hecate was called the \"Invincible Queen\" who presided over purifications and expiations. Ritually prepared food was offered to appease the god- dess, and her image was placed in front of homes to avert evil. Hecate is sometimes portrayed with three faces to rep- resent the cycles of the Moon. She is often accompanied by wild hounds. Complementary Planet: SATURN In order to gain a better grasp of all the ancient Planets in the outer grades, it is nec- essary for the student to not only study the Planet assigned to the Sephirah of the grade, but also that Planet's complement. Complementary Planets are those Planets which are on opposite points of the Macrocosmic Hexagram on the Tree of Life. (See Chapter Five). Complementary Planets share similar characteristics and qualities. Therefore in conjunction with the study material given on the Planet Luna, the student should review information supplied in Chapter One on Saturn, the Planet which complements Luna on the Macrocosmic Hexagram. Saturn is the Planet of discipline, organization, time, restrictions, limita- tions, and solidification. It is attributed to the Great Mother goddess in all pan- theons. This Planet also shares an occult correspondence with the Element of Earth. The energy of Saturn is slow, ponderous, and lasting. In an astrological sense, Saturn is said to be \"cold\" and \"barren.\" It is also thought of as a \"malefic\" Planet. The ancients described Saturn as the ruler of the period of life dominated by resignation from the ages 70 to 99 symbolized by\"slippers.\" In human anatomy, this Planet rules the teeth, bones and joints, the skin, , the knees and the gall bladder. Physical ailments associated with Saturn include phobias, injuries from falls, melancholia, decayed teeth, malnutrition, skin dis- ease, spinal ailments and arthritis. In magic, the days and hours of Saturn are used for performing experi- ments, causing good or ill success to business, possessions, goods, seeds, fruits and similar things, in order to acquire learning, for destruction and discord, limi- tation, and organization. In addition to this Saturn is the \"universal\" Planet whose symbol and energy can be used to encompass all the other Planetary energies as a whole.\" In the days of the week, Saturn rules Saturday. 71 As in the Adept level Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"The Theoricus Grade 289 Deities associated with the Planet Saturn include: PTAH (Egyptian) ISIS (Egyptian), CRONUS (Greek), HERA (Greek), RHEA (Greek), SATURNUS (Roman) EA (Assyro-Babylonian) and ISHTAR (Assyro-Babylonian).

All plants contain a high percentage of water which connects them to the Lunar energies. Plant life is quite liter- ally vital to all animal life on earth. Plants make up the staple food of humanity throughout the world. It is only with great difficulty that human beings can adapt to areas where plants do not thrive. And without plants, there would be no oxygen-no air to breathe. Plants are among the greatest Alchemists in nature, absorbing water and nutrients from the soil through a system of roots, soaking up sunlight into leaves, and converting both into food for growth and reproduction. Through respiration, plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen. But photosynthesis is the unique process of green plants, which manufacture their own food and food for all animal life from the Sun's energy (not unlike the sphere of Yesod which receives the reflected Solar light from Tiphareth and distributes it to the active sphere of Malkuth). The chlorophyll-bearing leaves are where the process of photosynthesis takes place. Sunlight is converted into sugar and starch grains. The final method by which plants convert carbohydrates, fats and proteins into protoplasm is called assimilation, the process of creating living material out of nonliving material. This mechanism is very close to the mystery of life itself. The reproductive process of plants also depends heavily on the Air: Fertil- ization takes place when pollen is carried from one plant to another by the wind or by flying insects. Seeds containing young embryonic plants are dispersed by the winds or by birds and other creatures."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"290 SELF-INITIATION INTO TIlE GoLDEN DAWN 'TRADITION Growth is a characteristic of all life. This is especially vital for plants, because unlike animals, when plants cease to grow they die. And growth in plants is closely related to movement-in the slow upward search for light. Thus plants can also serve to teach humans about the search for the Light, for if we turn away from the divine quest, then our spiritual selves will cease to exist, and we will truly resemble the empty husks of spent plants. The student should also take note of the deciduous and perennial plants that undergo a form of dormancy or apparent death during the cold season and are \"reborn\" with the warming winds of Spring, seeking light and air. Plants have been venerated throughout history because their leaves, petals and flowers have been the source of various healing ointments, drugs, and vision- ary essences. The blossoming flower (especially the lotus and the rose) is a uni- versal symbol of the creative mystery of life as well as spiritual enlightenment. The seed of a plant alludes to the potential for life expanding from a tiny germ. And of course the tree is one of the most essential of all traditional symbols, denot- ing: (1) wisdom and spiritual growth, (2) the mind of the Divine and the eternal life of the cosmos, (3) a connecting link between different worlds, represented by the different parts of the Tree, and (4) the life of humanity, the lesser cosmos. Herbalism is the study of the medicinal uses of plants. Herbal magic is the use of plants to cause change in accordance with Will. Plants, like gemstones and metals, are associated with specific Powers: Planetary and Elemental. Each one of these substances has a vibratory rate that aligns it to one particular force or another. The vibratory rate of herbs, metals, and gems are determined by various factors: structural form, density, chemical makeup, etc. The Powers found in plants are ascertained by color, scent, form, habitat and other determinants. Related sub- stances usually have similar vibratory rates. The power of herbs is fairly easy to access because their magical energies are already present within the organic matter of the plants themselves. Herbs can be used in teas, incenses, sachets, ointments, baths and oils. However, the student who wishes to make use of herbs in magic must have a thorough knowledge of the properties of the plants s/he intends to use, because some herbs are poisonous and should not be ingested or rubbed on the skin. We suggest that the student obtain Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs to learn more about the proper uses of plants in magic."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"The Theoricus Grade Trees and Plants Corresponding to the Planets Saturn Ivy, yew, hemlock, nightshade, amaranth, hemp, aconite\" Jupiter Hyssop, fig, sage, star anise, nutmeg, sassafras Mars Pine, wormwood, ginger, nettle, basil, radish, holly Sol Sunflower, acacia, bay, marigold, saffron, rowan, peony Venus Rose, myrtle, elder, geranium, hyacinth, thyme, licorice Mercury Marjoram, fennel, mandrake, caraway, dill, pomegranate Luna Willow, moonwort, lotus, lemon, gardenia, mushroom, poppy Corresponding to the Elements Fire Ash, mustard, cactus, pepper, garlic, onion, thistle Water Most fruit trees, water plants, lotus, melon, orchid Air Palm, mistletoe, dandelion, mint, lavender, goldenrod Earth Oak, cypress, grains, potato, turnip, cotton, patchouli 291 Plant and Nature Spirits NYMPHS: In Greek mythology, nymphs are a group of nature Spirits, who dwell within plants, trees, water, etc. There are many types of nymphs but all are usually depicted as beautiful maidens. Forest-nymphs, also known as dryads lived within trees and were the nature god Pan's cohorts indance, music and pleasurable games. Of the other nymphs, naiads presided over brooks and fountains, oreads lived in mountains and grottos, nereids resided in the sea while napaeae, auloniads, hylaeorae and alsaeids inhabited the woods and valleys. These last types of nymphs were immortal, but the forest-nymphs were not. Their existence depended upon that of the trees. In Greek times it was a profane act to senselessly destroy a tree, and one which could result in severe punishment. Crowned with oak leaves the dryads were responsible for the well-being of trees, often dancing around the sacred oaks, guarding them with axes. Certain of the dryads, known as hamadryads, were even more closely related to the trees, of which they formed an essential part. SATYRS and SILENI: These Spirits are often confused with one another. Satyrs (equivalent to the Roman fauns), were deities of the woods, fields and mountains. They were a type of male forest genii thought to be the brothers of the nymphs. Satyrs were portrayed as being half man, half goat, with pointed ears and short sprout- ing horns on their heads. The lower half of their bodies ended with the legs, feet and tail of a goat. (Pan, the god of the woods, shepherd and flock, was often confused 72 Many of these plants are poisonous.

Satyrs delighted in chasing nymphs and and were attracted to the pursuit of pleasure. They were also the faith- ful companions of the god Dionysus. The SILENI were rural genii of springs and rivers whose name appears to mean \"water which bubbles as it flows.\" Unlike the satyrs, whose bodies were derived from he- goats, the bodies of the sileni were derived from horses, an animal symbolic of water. They possessed the ears, tail and hooves of horses. Cernunnos PAN: The Greek god of the woods and forests, Pan is also the god of herds and wild places. He is depicted with the horns, haunches, legs and hooves of a goat. This god often carries the syrinx or panpipes. FLORA: The Roman goddess of Spring and vegetation. CERNUNNOS: The Celtic homed god and universal Father-god. He is usually shown as a man with stag's horns, wearing a golden neck ring and sitting cross- legged. Cernunnos is sometimes portrayed as having three heads. At times he is accompanied by a homed serpent and a stag.e SECTION 9: Admission Badges and Diagrams V The Solid Greek Cubical C/V5S is the Admission Badge for the 32nd .. Path of Tau in the grade of Theoricus. It is composed of twenty-two \\1/ external squares which refer to the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The cross is an emblem of the equilibrated and balanced powers of the Elements through the forces represented by the Hebrew letters. Upon the front of the cross are the Hebrew letters which correspond to the four Elements: Aleph-Air, Shin-Fire, Mem-Water, and Tau-Earth. In the center is the letter Resh, which is attributed to the Sun. On the back of the cross are the Hebrew letters that represent the remaining Planets (minus Resh-Sol and Tau-Saturn). They are: Beth-Mercury, Peh-Mars, Gimel-Moon, Daleth-Venus with Kaph-Jupiter in the center. The remaining three sides of the Aleph-Air arm contain the letters corre- sponding to Libra (Lamed), Aquarius (Tzaddi) and Gemini (Zayin). The sides of the Shin-Fire arm are covered by the letters which refer to Aries (Heh), Leo (Teth) and Sagittarius (Samekh). The Mem-Water arm includes the letters which are attributed to Cancer (Cheth), Scorpio (Nun) and Pisces (Qoph). The sides of the Tau-Earth arm include the letters corresponding to Capricorn (Ayin), Taurus (Vav) and Virgo (Yod). The Cubical Cross combines the symbolism of the balanced Elements with the twenty-two letters (the powers of the Three Mothers, the seven Planets and the twelve Zodiacal Signs) to emphasize the eternal forces which are behind the base Elements of the physical universe."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"~ t1 -, W Front ~ ~ ~ ~ .., J Back The Solid Greek Cubical Cross 293"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"294 SELF-INITlATION INTO 1HE GOLDEN DAWN TRADffiON The Caduceus of Hermes is the Admission Badge which grants the candidate entry into the temple of Yesod. Legend has it that Hermes- Thoth, the god of Wisdom intervened in a fight between two serpents who then curled themselves around his wand. In ancient Mesopotamia, the intertwined serpents were a symbol of the god who cured all illnesses. The association of the Caduceus with the powers of healing was carried over into Greek culture and is still preserved today in medical emblems. The Caduceus is an explicit representation of the of the same energies con- cealed within the wand and lamen of the Keryx. One form of the Caduceus is that of the Three Mother Letters placed one above the other in descending order thus: Shin, Aleph, Mem. The Caduceus has another meaning on the Tree of Life. The upper point of the wand rests upon Kether, and the wings stretch out to Chokmah and Binah, thus completing the three Supernals. The lower seven Sephiroth are touched by the serpents whose heads rest upon Chesed and Geburah. The Wings and the top of the wand form the Hebrew letter Shin, the symbol of Fire. The upper parts of the serpent form the letter Aleph (Air), while the tails form the letter Mem. The animals are the twin serpents of Egypt and the currents of the astral Light.

The Serpent of Wisdom is formed by the natural order of the twenty-two paths. It is the ascending reflux current of energy which aspires unto the Divine (whereas the Flaming Sword alludes to the rush of divine energy descending into manifestation). The Serpent also traces the path of an initiate of the mysteries who aspires unto the Hidden Knowledge. (See Plate 2.) The Tarot Key of The Universe and the 32nd Path of the Sepher Yetzirah are fully described in the Theoricus Ritual. They are also explained in the next section entitled \"Ritual Work for the Theoricus.\"¢ This concludes the Knowledge Lecture. Examinations on the ritual as well as the material covered in this section are given at the end of this chapter. ADDITIONAL SIDE LECTURE 73 The Moon and the Tree of Life As confusion is found to exist with regard to the Right and Left Pillars of the Sephiroth on the Tree of Life in relation to the right and left sides of a man, and as to the phases of the Moon-you must note: That in every diagram and picture, the right hand side of the observer is next the Pillar of Mercy-Chokmah, Chesed, and Netzach; while the Pillar of Severity is on the observer's left hand. Yet when you apply the Tree of Life to yourself, your right side, arm, and leg represent the side of Strength and Severity, Binah, Geburah and Hod, and your left side refers to the Pillar of Mercy. So that when you look at a diagram, you are looking, as it were, at a man facing you, that your right side faces his left. His Merciful side forms the right hand Pillar in front of you, so that it is as if you looked at yourself in a mirror. Just as the man looks at you, so does the Moon look at you and so you say that the Moon in her increase is on the side of Mercy, the right hand pillar of the Sephiroth; and in her decrease, the crescent is on the left hand Pillar of Severity. A Diagram, then, is a picture of a Man or the Moon facing you. The temple pillars are similar: Black Pillar White Pillar Black Pillar White Pillar Severity Mercy Boaz Jachin Left Right Stolistes Dadouchos North South That is, the white Mercy or Jachin Pillar is on your right hand as you approach the Altar from the West and from the Hiereus.

Let him realize the mental world where the mind rules over matter, and let him meditate upon the ideas of appearance and reality.e RHYTHMIC BREATHING As stated in the Neophyte Ritual, \"The letter 'H' is our mode of representing the ancient Greek aspirate or breathing, and breath is the evidence of Life.\" Once the procedures of body awareness and relaxation have been learned, the techniques of rhythmic breathing should be mastered. The previous exercises should have demonstrated to the student the fact that most of us have a massive amount of ten- sion in our bodies. This tension can inhibit proper breathing. Improper breathing can in fact rob one of vitality and lifeforce. One of the goals of rhythmic breathing is to rid the body of neuromuscular tension, thus improving physical as well as mag- ical vitality and energy. If breath is indeed the evidence of life, then the initiate should proceed on the idea that the life of the universe exists everywhere and in fact pervades the atmosphere around us. Rhythmic breathing is based upon the precept that life is the active principle in the very air we breathe, and we as magical beings can draw upon this all-pervasive vitality. 74 From Regardie's The Golden Dawn."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"The Theoricus Grade 299 This exercise should be practiced at fixed periods of time every day. Twice a day is best, and for no more than ten minutes at one session. Do not force the breath- ing-all effort should be mild and unhurried. The entire process should be simple and enjoyable. As the lungs attune to the rhythm, they gradually communicate it to the rest of the body. Within a short time the entire body will be felt to vibrate with the cadence, thus instilling a powerful current of spiritual energy with the body and mind. In addition to this, rhythmic breathing is a discipline that trains the Will of the individual. Many students would like to skip over such simplistic yet laborious exercises as this, wishing to jump headlong into more advanced work. Persever- ance and determination are required to comply with the curriculum presented here. It is precisely this type of exercise that pits the student against his/her own inertia and indolence. Those who persist will profit greatly in the long run. The Fourfold Breath explained in Chapter One is an excellent example of a rhyth- mic breathing technique. The Theoricus can now expand on this method by adding certain visualizations: Inhale Full Hold Exhale Empty Hold Waxing Moon Full Moon Waning Moon Dark Moon The student may wish to experiment with several different fourfold visualiza- tions: the four quarters of the day (dawn, midday, dusk, midnight), the four sea- sons of the year, the four Elements, the four Qabalistic Worlds, the four letters of Tetragrammaton, etc., the list goes on. It is essential that whatever rhythm the student chooses, be it the Fourfold Breath, a ten beat count, or any other, the practice should be maintained for the prescribed ten minutes. The rhythm itself is responsible for the assimilation of vital energy from without, and the augmentation of the divine life power within. It might be helpful in the initial learning stages to employ an electric metronome attached to a timer. This can be adjusted to the correct length of the practice ses- sion, loudness and speed of the rhythmic beat.o"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"300 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRADmON THE PURIFYING BREATH This simple exercise is an extension of the rhythmic breath and should be employed at the end of all meditations. Take a deep full breath and hold it in for a few seconds. Then pucker the lips, leav- ing only a narrow opening in the mouth. Exhale the air strongly through the mouth, gradually and slowly forcing the air out through the small opening in the lips until all the air is gone. Relax for a moment while maintaining the balance of the air, then repeat. This will impel an automatic rebound of the chest whenever the exhalation of breath is com- pleted in this fashion. Repeat this technique over a long period of time until it can be executed easy and without discomfort.e MIND AWARENESS The Sephirah of Yesod is attributed to the third Qabalistic world of Yetzirah, the formative World of primordial Air. This is the world of the astral plane and of sub- conscious images. In the Theoricus grade, the student is encouraged to raise the level of awareness from the body to the mind. The exercise employed for this pur- pose is a form of \"free association\" used by psychotherapists. It is performed by simply letting the mind wander as it may without obstruction. Set a predetermined amount of time for the session beforehand and use an alarm clock or timer. (Twenty minutes or half an hour is appropriate.) At the end of the practice, stop immediately so that discipline is maintained. Sit comfortably in a straight chair with a pillow for the back of the head. Keep the back straight, knees together, eyes closed, and hands in the lap. A tape recorder should be set up ahead of time to record the entire session. Sitting in the position described above, calmly articulate any thought, idea, mem- ory or feeling that happens to arise, into the microphone. Speak indiscriminately, without planning what to say next. At the end of the session, play back what has been recorded. This practice will give the student a good idea of the hidden contents within the psyche. Some of it may seem shocking to the student who has not always been mentally \"honest\" with him/her self. The student may experience the opening of"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"The Theoricus Grade 301 a floodgate of pent-up feelings or thoughts that been censored for years. However the simple act of becoming aware of these hidden thoughts is part of the process of being able to come to terms with them. The mental pressure and inner conflicts caused by these repressed thoughts will eventually dissipate, along with the num- ber of \"breaks\" in concentration. This method of mind awareness should be practiced continually while the student is in the grade of Theoricus. It should at least be practiced until the shock and anxiety usually encountered by the recognition of one's disturbing thoughts has vanished completely. What is most important about this exerciseis that there should be no crit- icism, judgment or self-loathing concerning anything that might come up during the session. Your thoughts are a part of you, just like your arm or your leg. They are sim- ply childlike parts of yourself that need training. With time and discipline the ener- gies of these juvenile portions of the psyche can be directed toward higher pursuits.e SPEECH AWARENESS During the course of a one week, be aware of everything that you say. Examine the thought that lies behind everything that you say. During the following week, choose a specific hour each day (the same time each day) and maintain a period of total silence without talking (a temporary \"vow of silence\" if you will). For one week, say nothing that is a negative value judgment. For the following week, refrain from making positive value judgment statements. For one week try substituting the words \"Thou\" for \"it.\" For the following week try substituting the word \"it\" for the word \"1.\"* ASIMPLE CARD DIVINATION EXERCISE Use the ESP cards obtained in the Neophyte grade to perform this exercise.

Layout three cards and put the rest away. (The first card is the central one. The second card is placed to the right of the first one, and the third card is placed to the left of the first.) Card 1 represents the immediate influences upon the matter of the question. Card 2 refers to the past influences which have shaped the matter. And Card 3 symbolizes the completion of the matter or the influences that are needed to resolve the matter. Keep in mind that two or three cards of the same Element may come up and serve to strengthen the Elemental qualities shown. Also remember that Fire and Water are opposing forces, as are Air and Earth. Air is compatible with Water and Fire, while Fire is compatible with Air and Earth. Compatible Cards will strengthen each other, while opposing cards will weaken each other and tend to emphasis the negative aspects of the Elements.c A MEDITATION ON THE PARTS OF THE SOUL For this meditation, the Theoricus will need a black robe, nemyss, and the Outer Wand of Double Power. A Tarot deck should also be on hand. Prior to the medita- tion remove the following cards from the Tarot deck: The Fool, The Magician, The Empress, Temperance and The Moon.7 5 Put the rest of the deck aside. Perform a rite of relaxation. With the wand perform the LBRP. Place the cards on the altar, or on the floor in front of you if you wish to be seated. The cards should be arranged thus: The farthest (Easternmost) card from you will be The Fool, below that will be two cards: The Magician and The Empress, to the right and left respectively. Below them is The Star. The final card, The Moon is at the bottom, closest to you. 75 Refer to Chapter Four for additional information on these cards."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"The Theoricus Grade 303 See the cards before you as representations of the parts of the Soul. Yechidah, Chiah, Neshamah, Ruach and Nephesh. (Your own physical body represents the G'uph.) Contemplate the cards for a few moments, observing their symbolism and coloring. Close your eyes and begin breathing rhythmically after the manner of the Four- fold Breath. Continue breathing in this fashion for a few minutes before proceed- ing with the following visualization: Picture The Fool card in your mind's eye. This is the card chosen to represent the Yechidah, centered in Kether. The 0 Key of the Tarot (also called the Spirit of Ether) is attributed to Aleph (the first Hebrew letter) which indicates absolute unity. The childlike innocence of The Fool represents extreme proximity to the Unmanifest; it is the absolute beginning ofall possibilities, including the very root essence of spir- itual nature. This is a glyph of the True, Immortal Self. Contemplate these ideas for a few minutes before continuing. Visualize The Magician card before you. The First Key of the Tarot has been selected to represent the Chiah, located in Chokmah. The Magician or Magus of Power is an extension of The Fool. The Magician has the ability to act upon those thoughts created by the Fool. He represents the True Will and the inquisitive urge to become more than human. Spend some time contemplating these ideas. Imagine The Empress card in front of you. The Third Tarot Key has been chosen to represent The Neshamah, stationed in Binah. The Empress symbolizes the Soul's True Aspiration or supreme state of consciousness-a higher universal love-the intuitive power that connects humanity with the Divine. She is the Key to the formation and unification of the universe. Meditate upon these concepts for a few moments. VISualize these three cards together as generally representative of the highest aspi- rations of the Soul. Together, they comprise the \"Superego,\" the \"Oversoul\" or the divine part of us which is eternal. As a group, all of these various parts of the greater Neshamah can be visualized by concentrating on the Tarot card of the Empress, the portion of the Triad which is closest to our conscious awareness. Picture the Temperance card within your mind's eye. This card has been chosen to represent the Ruach, located in the five Sephiroth from Chesed to Yesod, but cen- tered in Tiphareth. The Ruach symbolizes a middle stage between the Highest and lowest portions of the Soul where the ethical power to distinguish between good and evil is brought into operation. This conscious part of our being (intellect or ego) is the mind and reasoning powers where humanity is able to fashion thoughts into actions. The Temperance card alludes to a conscious exchange of energies between right and left, masculine and feminine and also between the higher and lower states of consciousness. It is therefore an important channel of"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"304 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRADmON communication between these various aspects of the Soul and of consciousness itself. Ponder this for a few moments before continuing. Imagine The Moon card before you. This card has been selected to symbolize the Nephesh, centered in Yesod. The Key of the Moon represents both the subconscious mind and the lower astral, full of phantoms and illusions. It is also a card that depicts sexuality, wants, desires and instincts. This corresponds with the shadow-self of the Soul equivalent to the animal vitality and primal instincts. Meditate upon this. Mentally embellish the symbolism of the cards in each rhythmic cycle. Feel the energy of each image until they become animated scenes moving within your imagination, proceeding from Nephesh to Yechidah and conversely from Yechi- dah to Nephesh in an alternating progression. As the likeness of one card merges into that of the one that follows it, see how the energies flow into one another. Also imagine the subconscious Moon, the Nephesh, collecting and reflecting impres- sions which stimulate the Ruach represented by Temperance-the cognizant deci- sion-making aspect of the Soul. The Ruach transmits this consciously to the Neshamah or Divine Soul. This causes the descent of the Neshamah, symbolized by the Empress, into all portions of the Soul, bringing with it an awareness of the Divine Self. Continue this meditation for a short time. After some time is spent on the visualizations, return to normal consciousness. Face the East and say, \"Unto thee, Tetragrammaton, be ascribed the Kingdom, and the Power andthe Glory. Unto the ages, Amen.\" Close the meditation by performing the Qabalistic Cross.« The 32nd Path of Tau The Sepher Yetzirah or Book of Formation describes the 32nd Path as \"The Admin- istrative Intelligence, and it is so called because it directs and associates the motions of the seven Planets, directing all of them in their own proper courses.\" This is because the 32nd Path connects Malkuth (the Earth) with the balanced energies of the seven Planets, represented by the hexagram on the Tree of Life (from Yesod to Daath). The fact that it is described as the\" Administrative Intelli- gence\" shows that Spirit should be the directing Power behind the operation of all of the seven Planets and their corresponding attributes in the human vehicle. The 32nd Path connects the physical world of Malkuth to Yesod, the uni- versal subconscious realm and the astral blueprint which forms the foundation of material existence. It is a passage way from the material realm to the astral plane; a portal leading from sensory experience to inner examination. This Path is the point at which the student begins to explore the Tree of Life as well as his/her"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"The Theoricus Grade 305 own inner makeup. The symbolism of the 32nd Path involves a descent into the Underworld or subconscious mind. This journey into the \"unknown\" realms of the mind includes the analysis of hidden fears and personal self-inflicted \"demons\" as well as an ascent to a new awareness of a higher state of conscious- ness. These shadows and ghosts of one's own making must be sufficiently dealt with before any further spiritual progress is made. The 21st Key of the Tarot known as The Universe is attributed to this Path. The Magical Title of the this card is \"The Great One of the Night of Time.\" Other symbols associated with this Path include the Hebrew letter Tau, the Planet Saturn (which also refers to the element of Earth) the seven-pointed star or heptagram, the Kerubim, the four Elements, and the twelve Signs of the Zodiac. The letter Tau means\" cross,\" which not only refers to a T-cross, but also to the four-armed cross of the Elements which are materialized in Malkuth, This cross also alludes to the inner Elements of the initiate's psyche which undergoes an intense process of introspection in the grades of Outer Order. Upon entering this Path, the student is fully immersed in an Alchemical process which began in the Zelator grade-that of separation into the various component parts of the mind. This can also be likened to an alimentary system of the human psyche, sep- arating the gross from the refined, casting out impurities and reorganizing (coho- bating) what remains, just as in Alchemy. It must not be forgotten that this is also a Path of beginnings. The letters Aleph and Tau signify the beginning and the end, just as A to Z, or Alpha and Omega. And as with many things in Qabalah, the end of one thing is the begin- ning of another. The student on the Path of Tau is presented for the first time with all the tools necessary for further growth. The Elements, Planets and Signs pre- sented in The Universe card are in fact the keys to the entire universe, which must be used intelligently in order to safely traverse the wonders of the cosmos. What- ever is encountered from this Path onward has its basis in how well one learns the lessons from the 32nd Path. In many ways, this Path summarizes the entire Qabal- istic teachings-that balance and discrimination are essential to successfully scale the Tree of Life.e AJOURNEY ON THE 32nd PATH OF TAU 6 For this ritual the Theoricus will need the robe, nemyss, red sandals, the Cubical Cross, and the Outer Wand of Double Power. The temple is to be arranged as in the Opening of the 2 = 9 grade. Upon the altar should be the Tarot Trump of the Uni- verse. Acomfortable place to sit and meditate should be arranged West of the altar. 76 From our book Secrets of a Golden Dawn Temple."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"306 SELF-INITlATION INlO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRADITION After a period of relaxation has passed, go to the Northeast and say, \"HEKAS, HEKAS, ESTE BEBELOI! Far from this sacred place bethe profane!\" Go to the East. With the black end of the wand, perform the Lesser Banishing Rit- ual of the Pentagram. Go the West of the altar. With the white end of the Wand of Double Power, trace a large letter TAU over the Tarot card. Visualize it in blue-violet (indigo). Intone the name of the letter twice. Give the Neophyte Signs toward the card. Put the wand aside, and take the Cubical Cross in your right hand. With all your powers of concentration, look upon the card and comprehend it, consider all its meaning and symbolism. Give the Sign of the Zelator. At this point you may sit comfortably if you wish, but maintain a disassociation from the sur- rounding room. Behind the darkness of your closed eyelids, you begin to formu- late the astral temple of the Sephirah Malkuth, as the journey begins.e From the complete blackness, a dim light appears which permits you to take in your surroundings. You are in the midst of a great temple with ten sides. The floor is divided into black and white tiles. The walls are built from large earthen bricks. Great oak columns support the ceiling which is pure rock crystal. In the Southern side of the temple is a great roaring hearth, whose fire warms the otherwise chill air within the temple. Behind you in the West is a great fountain of sculpted marble in the shape of an eagle with a fish in its claws-water spouts from the mouth of both creatures. In the Northern part of the temple are two enormous stones used for grinding wheat. A black ox is harnessed to the ancient milling device, slowly turning it as it crushes the hulls of the grain. At the East of the temple, is a large brazier of burning incense. The scent of Dittany of Crete fills the Air. At the center of the temple stands a black altar carved from solid oak. It is covered by a cloth divided into the four colors of Malkuth: citrine, russet, olive, and black. The top of the altar is white, and upon it is a bright burning flame. Drawing nearer to the light, you intone the Divine Name of this temple, Adonai ha-Aretz. The flame burns brightly as you do so. Next intone the name of the Archangel who governs the Forces of this sphere, Sandalphon. Then vibrate the name of the Angelic order that operates in Malkuth, the Ashim, the Souls of Fire. Glowing embers dance around the central altar flame. Finally, you vibrate the name of the temple itself, Malkuth. Within the swirling clouds of incense, a figure appears in the East. Appear- ing as a tall feminine form in robes of citrine, olive, russet and black is the archangel, Sandalphon with dark hair and compassionate brown eyes. Instinc- tively, you give the Sign of the Enterer. Sandalphon answers with the Sign of Silence. She speaks: \"You have entered the Immeasurable Region. This place is called THRAA, The Gate. It is the Gate of Justice, The Gate of Life and the Gate of Death. The Gate"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"The Theorieus Grade 307 of Tears, and the Gate of Prayer. It is the Gate of the Garden of Eden and the Gate of the Daughter of the Mighty Ones. By what Sign have you entered herein?\" You answer by giving the Zelator Sign. She asks why you have come to this place. You hold up the Cubical Cross. You face the Archangel across the light of the altar, as you prepare for your journey into the 32nd Path. Finally, Sandalphon turns toward the East where is a great wooden door which had previously been obscured by the smoke from the incense. The Tarot card of The Universe hangs like a veil in front of it. Sandalphon traces a cross in the air with her hand and the veil parts. A large metal Tau is now dearly seen on the heavy oak door. The Archangel moves aside after showing the way. It is up to you to open the door. Undaunted, you approach it and give the Sign of the Theoricus. Holding out the Cubical Cross, you trace with it a large let- ter Tau. The door slowly opens. Beyond the door, you enter a lush meadow ablaze with flowers. To the North are snow-capped mountains and cool running streams. To the South is a low-lying desert. Before you in the East, the dawning Sun is breaking over the low rolling hills. This is the path you have chosen. Sandalphon leads the way. Time and space seem distorted as they often do on astral journeys. You pass by many fields, farms, and villages, covering vast distances in what seems like a very short interval. The breeze is cool against your skin, and a hint of storax is in the air. The path you are on leads into the hill country which has less trees than did the grassy meadow land before it. The day beneath your feet has given way to sandy soil. The air is warmer and there is no breeze here. The trail leads straight into a hillside where there is a cavern leading into the earth. On either side of the jagged stone opening is a column cut from solid rock. The base of each pillar is carved into the shape of a lotus flower, while the capital is sculpted into the form of a pomegranate. Before each column stands a gigantic muscular figure with the head of a beast. Their human bodies are covered by tunics, but the black fur and pointed features of jackals stick out beneath their nemysses. The figure on the left holds a large sword, while the figure on the right holds a staff entwined with ser- pents in one hand, and a red lantern in the other. Sandalphon tells you to continue onward. This is as far as she will take you. As you approach the Anubian guards, they lunge forward with a growl, crossing their implements to block your advance. \"Whence comest Thou?\" they demand to know. You respond by giving the Sign of the Zelator and saying, \"1 have entered the Immeasurable Region. I have passed through the Gate of Life and the Gate of Death. I seek to journey upon the Path of Tau which leadeth between the pillars from the Kingdom to the Foundation.\" \"In what signs and symbols do ye come?\" they ask. You answer by standing in the Sign of the Theoricus. \"In the divine name of Shaddai El Chai; in the word Mem Heh and in this symbol of the Solid Greek Cubical Cross, which contains the divine number, twenty-two.\""},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"308 SELF-INITIATION INTO lHE GoLDEN DAWN 'TRAomoN The twin guards step back. Anubis of the East with lantern and staff, turns to enter the cave. You give the Signs of the Neophyte and follow him in Just inside the entrance is a small antechamber with a black and white tiled floor. Four large winged statues stare at you without emotion. All have human bodies, but with different heads. One has the head of lion. Another has the head of an eagle. There is also a bull, and finally the winged form of a man. You pass by these silent sentinels holding the cross high above you. The light from outside of the cave soon fades as you descend deeper and deeper into the cave. Anubis leads silently on as the darkness closes in. The floor of the cave is rough, and you must feel the ground carefully with your feet to keep from stumbling. The ceiling presses in and you are forced to crouch at times. The path twists from one side to the other. At times you feel like you are climbing toward the surface again, only to follow your guide on another quick descent. Your sense of direction is gone-you quicken your pace to catch up to Anubis so that you won't get hopelessly lost. The light from his lantern makes strange and sinister shadows appear on the cavern walls. Voices from your past come to taunt you on this journey: school children calling you names, adults reprimanding you, peers telling you of your limitations. All the voices try to dissuade you from going deeper into the cave. \"Go Back!\" they warn. \"You can't make it!\" \"It's too danger- ous!\" \"You're too weak!\" You know that the voices are merely echoes-ghosts- archetypes from your own mind that are uneasy at the prospect of being found out. You ignore them and press onward. The dark journey through the twisted rock seems to take forever. Finally, a dim light ahead is a welcome sight. Your guide leads you into a large chamber where the smell of burning oil from torches fills the room. The walls and floor are plain and seem to have been cut completely out of solid rock with simple tools. From a great dark hole in one wall of the room, a slow-moving stream of water fills a gutter carved out of the floor and flows to the opposite wall. There it flows under a huge stone door. A small number of beings are in the room with you. Apes with jeweled collars hold the ropes that are attached to the two sides of the great door. Many celestial beings with both human and animal heads can be seen bearing all kinds of food, incense, weapons, staffs, jewels, jars of per- fume and more. There are also a few men and women in all manner of Egyptian dress-some in fine silken clothes-others in simple tunics. Everyone in the room appears to be waiting for something. \"This is the Arrit,\" Anubis tells you,\" the antechamber of the Tuat-the Underworld. This is where I guide the Souls of the dead. This too, is where the dead Sun-god RA enters the Underworld from the West-for he is a dead god when the darkness of Night rules the sky. This is also Amenet, the Hidden Place. All assembled here wait for the coming of Ra. The Souls of the dead hope to be per- mitted to enter the Sektet Boat of Ra-to travel in safety through the terrors of the Tuat-and finally be reborn with him at the Dawning Light of the Eastern sky. Behold, it is time!\" The anticipation of the assembly grows and is rewarded by the sight of two long lines of priests pulling heavy ropes. Finally the long prow of a boat"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"The Theoricus Grade 309 enters the chamber from the dark hole in the wall. The boat made from reeds, is light and slender. Thoth, the ibis-headed god of Wisdom stands at the bow, to guide the vessel. At the center of the craft is a shrine where the Sun-god sits enthroned. He has the body of a man with the tawny head and piercing eyes of a hawk. A large Solar disc crowns his nemyss, and he holds an ankh in one hand and a phoenix- headed staff in the other. The scarab, Khepera, surmounts the crown of the figure like a halo. But the god is old and has the pallor of death about him. The god Horus stands at the rear of ship as an escort. At this marvelous sight, a roar of praise erupts from those assembled in the chamber. At the center of the room, the boat stops and is boarded by the Souls who have stood waiting for it. Anubis leads you to the craft. \"You must continue your journey under the protection of Ra,\" he tells you. \"1 must return to give guidance to the dead. Have courage. The Tuat is filled with sights both wondrous and terri- ble. Fear nothing and your strength shall see you through.\" From the boat, a hand is offered. You take it and climb aboard, giving a final farewell to Anubis, who is already on his way back to the surface-the light from his lamp bobs through the cavern tunnel. Finding a seat with the other pas- sengers, you settle in for the ride. The apes you saw earlier pull on the ropes which open the great stone doors leading to the Tuat. Slowly the Sektet boat moves forward and enters the underworld. The place called the Tuat is so enormous that it is difficult to tell whether it is enclosed under the earth or if it exists at some point in space beyond the earth. The stream has widened into a river in the middle of a valley, on either side of which is a mountain range. It is a noisy place inhabited by many creatures. Mon- strous beasts rummage about in the muddy shores. The Souls of the dead are everywhere, milling around along the river bank and swimming alongside the boat. A few are permitted to climb on board, but others are turned away, because each Soul must spend a certain amount of time in the underworld before re-enter- ing the land of the Living. The ship continues to travel through the twelve divisions of the Tuat, known as the twelve hours of the Night. Twin Pylons with serpent guardians mark each division. So many incredible sights appear that you can only sit and watch as gods battle hostile Spirits, evil serpents and crocodiles. There are great pits of fire that appear in the middle of the river. Hostile Spirits harangue the dead who walk along the shore. There are also benevolent and helpful creatures whose bodies are formed from many different animals. At times it seems like many lesser gods appear from nowhere to pull the ship forward with serpents instead of ropes. Sacred animals such as bulls, winged cobras and baboons join in the pro- cessions through the Underworld. And at one point, the great goddess Isis appears on the boat to utter magical words to repel the enemies of Ra. At the sixth division of the Tuat, the Sektet boat stops at a great stone shrine topped with spearheads. Inside, the god Osiris is seated upon the summit of a flight of nine steps. He wears a double crown and holds in one hand a scepter and in the other an ankh, the symbol of Life. Before him is a pair of scales and a company of lesser gods. The Sektet boat pauses in homage to the god who reigns"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"310 SELF-INITIATION INlO ras GoLDEN DAWN TRAomON over the Underworld-osiris, he who judges the dead. The Lord of Life, tri- umphant over Death. After leaving the shrine, the journey continues as before, until eventually, the Sektet boat reaches the eleventh division of the Tuat-and the eleventh hour of the night. At this point, great pits of fire-e-each attended by a goddess-appear ahead of the boat, and the battle between gods and demons becomes decidedly more intense. The voices from your past which had earlier harassed you in the cave return to bother you now at this crucial moment. But you have already won over them in the knowledge that they are merely programmed archetypes within your own psyche, which do not wish to lose their position of prominence within your mind. In this last-ditch effort to force you to feel weak, inane, and guilty, the voices are desperate in the attempt to make you fail to complete this voyage. The god Horus takes command of the vessel and orders all the demons and enemies of Ra to be consumed in the blazing fires. The attendant goddesses see that it is done. At this point, you also will your own personal demons into the purging flames. The ghostly voices are silenced. A sense of great relief and calm overtakes you, as the Sektet boat glides into the Twelfth Hour of the Night. Twelve gods, all loyal servants of Ra, now pull the ship, which is no longer sailing on the river, but through the belly of a sacred serpent. In this surprisingly tranquil division of the Tuat, you hear in a whisper, the serpent's name, \"Ka-en- Ankh-neteru, the Life of the gods.\" The circle of the Tuat is near its end, but there is utter darkness in the bowels of this serpent. There is also a feeling of nervous excitement among the Souls aboard the vessel. The horrors of the Tuat are in the past now, and a great transformation is about to take place. As the ship enters the throat of the serpent, the enormous jaws begin to open. Beyond them is the indigo of the night sky, speckled with stars. As the boat slides off the tongue of the animal, the stars and Planets themselves erupt into a song of praise for the reborn Sun god. Twelve goddesses pull the ship into the sky. The Sektet boat of the night is no more. It is now the Matet boat of Day sailing into the Eastern part of the sky. Ra himself has transformed before your eyes. No longer pale and old, the god glows with the life of youth. His Solar disc lights up the coun- tryside far below in all directions. Of the fortunate Souls who have traversed the terrors of the Tuat in Ra's ship, some are rewarded with a new birth upon the earth, while others remain in the sky journeying at will through the universe. You, too, feel reborn and strength- ened with the dawning of the sun upon the skies over the earth. The grass is wet and glistening with morning dew. Humans and animals below are just beginning to stir from their sleep and go about their daily activities. You realize that your journey upon the Path of Tau is nearing its end, but for the Sun god this journey is a nightly occurrence. Silently, you thank the god for helping you travel this path. The warmth of the Sun lulls you into a restful meditation. When you open your eyes again, you see that an entire day has passed while you meditated. The last rays of light are fading as Ra's boat enters the West- ern sky. Under the earth, the ship again enters the dark Arrit, the antechamber to the Tuat. This is the end of your journey through the underworld. You realize that"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"The Theoricus Grade 311 you will traverse this path again, perhaps many times. However you know that the journey will be easier each time. As the boat glides into the chamber, you see the familiar form of Anubis, who reaches out his hand to help you down from the vessel. With a final prayer of thanks to Ra, you tum and follow the jackal-headed god through the winding tunnel to the cave entrance. Once you are outside the cave, Anubis joins his twin and stands guard at the threshold. You salute them both with the Sign of the Theoricus. Sandalphon is waiting on the path which leads to Malkuth. Following her, you return to the Tenth Sephirah. The Angel seals the great wooden door behind you after entering the temple. The flame upon the altar is a welcome sight after such an arduous adventure. The great fireplace, fountain and oaken walls are very familiar and comforting. Standing before the altar, you partake of the sacred flame a few moments before leaving the temple. Saying goodbye to Sandalphon, you salute with the Projection Sign. She answers with the Sign of Silence.e Bring your astral self back into your body and make yourself slowly aware of the physical room around you. Do not get up too quickly.

For the first time the initiate is faced with the prospect of stepping off the ~.Si relative \"safety\" of the Middle Pillar and onto the Black Pillar of .. Severity. The Practicus grade thus represents a point in the initiate's spiritual growth where more weight is theoretically placed on one side of the aspi- rant's psychic scales of balance. It is important to remember that once the student begins on this path of Elemental introspection, allfour Elemental Initiations should be completed. Even if the student decides in the middle of this course that the Golden Dawn System is not his/her spiritual path, all of the Elements should still be equilibrated within the mind for the sake of harmony. One should not be left hanging off balance on one pillar or the other. The title of Practicus is derived from the Greek word for \"practitioner.\" The Element offered for the process of transmutation in this grade is Water, or rather the watery portion of the aspirant's psyche (in actuality it is the Water of Malkuth in Assiah).77 Initiates of this grade usually experience a sense of ease and relief at having passed through the astral turbulence of Yesod (Although the initiation ceremony itself can sometimes prove to be quite eventful.) In fact the nurturing Waters of Hod can feel truly comforting to those initiates who have experienced firsthand the harmful effects of an unbalanced materialistic society. The problem is that some- times students are reluctant to leave the Water temple for the Fire grade of Philoso- phus. There is also an increased awareness of student's own creative faculties, some of which may have remained dormant until this time. The Planet assigned to this grade is Mercury, the orb of the Intellect, communication and expression. The 3 = 8 ceremony can be summed up as follows: After the standard (self- initiatory) rite of opening, the forces of Elemental Water are invoked. Then the candidate must prove that s/he has grasped the secrets of the Theoricus grade and swear an oath. Between the spheres of Malkuth and Hod lies the 31st Path of Shin, a journey of psychic purification and consecration through Elemental Fire. On this path, the candidate is confronted by three figures known as the Kabiri, or godforrns from the Samothracian Mysteries. These figures symbolize the various 77 And also Hod of Malkuth. 327"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"328 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON aspects and attributes of Elemental Fire. On the path of Shin the Kabiri expose the candidate to the different energies of Fire which are used to purge the aspirant of psychic impurities before the Water temple is entered. After completing the 31st Path, the candidate is shown the Tarot card of Judgment. Next the mysteries of the 30th Path of Resh are revealed to the candidate by the Kabiri who take on various Solar and seasonal aspects. The Path of Resh is a journey of intellectual awareness where the student is exposed to the Higher Powers that have gone into the formation of his/her own personality. (Whereas the 31st Path is a journey of purification, the 30th Path is one of consecration.) When the journey on the Path of Resh is finished, the candidate is shown the Tarot card of The Sun. The later part of the ritual, involves the initiate's entry into the temple of Hod. During this time the aspirant is shown symbolism concerning the Garden of Eden before the Fall and the Practicus Hall. The secrets of the 3 = 8 grade are divulged, until at length, the Powers of Water are released. It is important to note that in this grade, two fiery paths are traversed in order to arrive at a watery Sephirah. This shows the constant equilibration which is inherent to the G:. D:. system. Fire and Water, the two primary opposing Ele- ments, are always counterbalanced one against the other so that neither is allowed to overpower the energies of the other. Water is maternal and nurturing, while Fire is paternal and inseminating. The aspirant is led to the receptive Waters of Hod by way of the vitalizing energies of Fire. Thus the union of the two is the only possible route to building a firm creative base for spiritual attainment. The Waters of Intellect must never be allowed to become stagnant and insensitive; they must be ever excited by the passionate Fires of Emotion; There are only three officers stationed in the Practicus Hall besides the Dais officers-these are the three Middle Pillar officers only-the Keryx is no longer pre- sent. This leaves three officers who form an approximate equilateral triangle. The triangle, whose apex is marked by the station of Hierophant, refers to the Fire trian- gle and the Fiery nature of the 31st and 30th Paths in relation to the Tree of Life. The placement of the pillars in the Northeastern part of the Hall suggests the actualloca- tion of these paths on the diagram of the Tree. In the final part of the ritual the Hiero- phant takes up a temporary position West of the altar, forming a Water triangle with the other two officers (like that indicated by the items on the altar). Many of the speeches in the 3 = 8 grade are symbolically given by the Samothracian Kabiri, but are in actuality taken from excepts of the Chaldean Ora- cles, a body of work which is from a much later time period than the Samothra- cian mysteries.e The Samothracian Mysteries Samothrace was the name given to a Greek island in the Northeast portion of the Aegean Sea that was the center of the oldest of the Greek mystery cults. This island was said to be settled by the ancient Pelasgi, early Asiatic colonists in Greece. The esteem shown the Samothracian Mysteries by ancient literary sources proved that"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 329 they once ranked alongside the Eleusinian Mysteries in importance and popular- ity. This stormy, mountainous and wooded island was renowned as the home of the mysterious gods known as the Kabiri (or Corybantes, as they are sometimes referred to). So great was the respect for the mystery rites of Samothrace that the island itself was considered sacred, a sanctuary to be respected by all nations. Not much is now known of the Kabiri or \"great gods\" whose name is derived from the Kabira mountains or Phrygia.?\" The rituals are immersed in profound secrecy. It is certain though that great festivals were held to worship these gods and initiate new candidates into their mystery rites. The mysteries of Samothrace included the rites of the Kabiri and the rites of Hecate. Hecate's secret mysteries were said to have taken place in the cave of Zeryn- thia, called the Grotto of Hecate, where a nocturnal ritual was performed by torch- bearing participants who sacrificed dogs to honor the goddess of the Underworld. Near the door of the temple of the Kabiri on Samothrace, there were two bronze statues (it is unclear whether they were both masculine or if one was fem- inine). They represented the Heavens and the Earth-the two primary portions into which the world is divided-the active and passive principles of universal generation. Within the temple were three altars dedicated to the Kabiri, the Great gods of Samothrace: the Great, the Powerful and the Influential (or Helpfulj.?? Some claim that there were a total of seven Kabiri and referred them to the seven Planets. Others spoke of them as the seven Spirits of Fire before the throne of Saturn. Some ancient writers say there were but two Kabiri who represented Zeus the Elder and Dionysus the younger. At Samothrace the Kabiri were thought of as lesser gods who were sworn to the service of greater deities such as Rhea. At Thebes they were allied with the cult of Demeter and Kore, for their temple was located near a grove sacred to these deities. At Lemnos the Kabiri originated as benevolent gods or genii of volcanic (Fiery) Earth. They were either the sons of Hephaestus or the sons of Zeus and Calliope. These first metal-workers were said to be the noisy and never-resting assistants of Hephaestus at his forge. They would at times shake the earth with their tumultuous rumbling. At Thessaly there was a legend of a Kabir who was killed by his brothers and buried at the foot of Mt. Olympus. It is this Kabiric myth in particular which relates to the Practicus rit- ual of the Golden Dawn. Initiation into the Kabiric mysteries at Samothrace concerned four of these \"great gods.\" Their names were Axieros, Axiokersa, and Axiokersos. Axieros was associated with Demeter, Axiokersa with Persephone, and Axiokersos with Hades. The fourth Kabir, known as Kasmillos, was attributed to Hermes. so The names of the first three Kabiri bear a resemblance to the Greek word axioma which means something worthy or something that is self-evident. The name Kasmillos is based upon the word camilla which refers to a handmaiden 78 The name \"Kabiri\" has also been associated with the Phoenician word qabirim which means \"the powerful.\" The word Cabar \"great\" can be traced to Hebrew, Phoenician and Arabic languages. 79 The Kabiri were later adopted into Roman mythology as the Penates.

A camillus was an assistant at a wedding who carried a basket of unknown contents during the service.w In the Samothracian mysteries, the name Kasmillos is used to describe a divinity who attends upon the greater gods. In Secret Teaching of All Ages, Manly P. Hall also examined the mysteries of the Samothracian Kabiri: Whilea vast numberof deities are associated with the Samothracian Mys- teries, the ritualistic drama centers around four brothers. Thefirst three- Aschieros, Achiochersus, and Achiochersa-attack and murder the fourth-e-Cashmala (or Cadmillus). Dionysidorus, however, identifies Aschieros with Demeter, Achiochersus with Pluto, Achiochersa with Persephone, and Cashmala with Hermes. Alexander Wilder notes that in the Samothracian ritual \"Cadmillus is made to include the Theban Ser- pent-God, Cadmus, the Thoth of Egypt, the Hermes of the Greeks, and the Aesculapius of the Alexandrians and Phoenicians.\" Here again is a repe- tition of the story of Osiris, Bacchus, Adonis, Balder, and Hiram Abiff.82 The worship of Atys and Cybele was also involved in the Samothracian Mysteries. In the rituals of the Cabiri is to be traced a form of pine-tree worship, for this tree, sacred to Atys, wasfirst trimmedinto theform of a cross and then cut down in honor of the murdered god whose body was discovered at its foot. \"If you wish to inspect the orgies of the Corybantes,\" writes Clement, \"then know that,having killed theirthird brother, they covered the head of the bodywith a purple cloth, crowned it, and carrying it on the point of a spear, buried it under the roots of Olympus. These mysteries are in short, murders and funerals. (This ante-Nicene Father in his efforts to defame the pagan rites apparently ignores thefact that like the Cabirian martyr, Jesus Christ was foully betrayed, tortured, and finally murdered!) And the priests of these rites, who were called kings of the sacred rites by those whose business it is to name them, give additional strangeness to the tragic occurrence, by forbidding parsley with the roots from being placed on the table, for they think that parsley grewfrom the Corybantic blood that flowed forth; just as the women, in celebrating the Thesmorphoriase abstain from eating the seeds of the pomegranate, whichhave fallen on the ground, from the idea that pomegranates sprangfrom the drops of the blood of Dionysus. Those Corybantes also they call Cabiric; and the cere- mony itself they announced as the Cabiric mystery.\" 81 Children employed in the temples were called Mercuries or Casmilli. 82 In Masonic legend, Hiram Abiff was the architect of King Solomon's temple, who was killed by three of his workers who were also brothers. The body was buried at the foot of a mountain and an acacia tree was planted over it. This legend is re-enacted in the Third Degree of the Master Mason. 83 A festival of the Eleusinian Mysteries which celebrated the departure of Kore into the underworld."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade The Mysteries of the Cabiri were divided into three degrees, thefirst of which celebrated the death of Cash mala at the hands of his three brothers; the second, the discovery of his mutilated body, the parts of which had been found and gathered after much rejoicing and happiness-his resur- rection and the consequent salvation of the world. The temple of the Cabiri at Samothrace contained a number of curious divinities, many of them misshapen creatures representing the Elemental powers of Nature, possi- bly the Bacchic Titans. Children were initiated into the Cabiric cult with the same dignity as adults, and criminals who had reached the sanctuary were safe from pursuit. The Samothracian rites were particularly con- cerned with navigation, the Dioscuri8L...Castor and Pollux, or the gods of navigation-being among those propitiated by members of that cult. The Argonautic expedition, listening to the advice of Orpheus, stopped at the island of Samothrace for the purpose of having its members initiated into the Cabiric rites. 85 Herodotus relates that when Cambyses entered the temple of the Cabiri he was unable to restrain his mirth at seeing before him the figure of a man standing upright and, facing the man, the figure of a woman standing on her head. Had Cambyses been acquainted with the principles of divine astronomy, he would have realized that he was then in the presence of the key to universal equilibrium. \"'1 ask,' says Voltaire, 'who were these Hiero- phants, these sacred Freemasons, who celebrated their Ancient Mysteries of Samothracia, and whence came they and their gods Cabiri?\" (See Mackey's Encyclopedia of Freemasonry.) Clement speaks of the Mysteries of the Cabiri as \"the sacred mysteryof a brother slain by his brethren,\" and the \"Cabiric death\" was oneof the secret symbols of antiquity. Thus the alle- goryof the Self murdered by the not-self is perpetuated through the religious mysticism ofall peoples. The Philosophic Death and the Philosophic Resur- rection are the Lesser and the Greater Mysteries respectively.\"86 331 One version says that the ceremonies of Samothrace represented the death of the youngest of the Kabiri at the hand of his brothers, who fled to Etruria, car- rying with them the ark that contained the genitals of the slain Kabir. The Phallus and the sacred ark that contained it were revered by the Samothracian initiates.f? The great annual festival of the Samothracian mysteries took place at mid- summer and lasted for three days. There were nightly processions to the cave of Zerynthia where initiations took place. The priests of the rites were known as sai 84 The Twins of Gemini. 85 With a storm arising, Orpheus, an initiate of the mysteries, counselled the Argonauts to land at Samothrace and be initiated into the sacred rites.

Purifications played a very important role in these rites, including moral purification of initiates. One type of priest at the Kabiri rites was known as a koies, or a cleanser of sins. The historian Plutarch recounts that one initiate who was called Antalcidas was asked by an initiating priest what especially dreadful thing he had committed during his lifetime. Apparently, Antalcidas replied that if he had com- mitted a terrible crime, the gods themselves would be aware of it. Initiates were con- secrated to the Deities and pledged to virtue. They would then be assured of those rewards which the justice of the gods reserve for initiates after death. The ceremony included an invocation of the Kabiri to appear and protect the initiates. Those righteous individuals who became initiates were said to have been protected from danger and storms-particularly mishaps at sea and other marine disasters.\" Sacred robes and fillets or ribbons of violet cloth were worn about the abdomen by these initiates. A crown of olive graced their brows. As a final note of interest, a type of fish known as the pompilus''? fish was sacred to the Samothracian gods. The fish is a symbol of spiritual fecundity and by virtue of its association with the Sign of Scorpio, it is also an emblem of regenera- tion and transformation. Godforms of the Kabiri It is necessary for the student who seeks to self-initiate into the grade of Practicus to envision the gods of the Samothracian mysteries. Although these godforms are obscure, they can nevertheless be constructed specifically for the 3=8 grade in the mind of the aspirant using the following visualizations: AXIEROS: The First Kabir is a mature bearded man with olive skin and thick wavy hair. He wears golden sandals, a golden tunic and an orange cloak. Upon his brow is an emblem of the Sun attached to a crown of oak leaves. In one hand he holds a lamp and the thunderbolt of Zeus, and in the other a golden scepter surmounted by an ear of com, sacred to Demeter. AXIOKERSOS: The Second Kabir is a robust dark-bearded warrior in red Greek armor and crested helmet. A black cloak hangs from his shoulders and black sandals are upon his feet. The symbol of an anvil is upon his brow. In one hand he holds a flaming torch (of Hades) and in the other a spear. AXIOKERSA: The third Kabir is an olive-skinned woman with thick dark hair. She wears a green tunic, a yellow cloak and green sandals. Upon her brow is a white crocus flower, attached to a yellow strophion or headband. In one hand she bears a candle flame and in the other a scepter surmounted by a pom.egranate, sacred to Persephone. 88 The Argonauts were supposed to have become initiates in order that they might sail more safely. 89 In mythology, Pompilus was a ferryman who was turned into a fish by Apollo."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 333 KASMILLOS: The candidate (and the Fourth Kabir) is a youth who wears a black tunic and black sandals.

These fragments, reputed to have been written by Zoroaster, contain sacred doctrines and philosophies of ancient Babylonian priests, which have come down to us through Greek translations. Paraphrased in Neoplatonic lit- erature and philosophy, the Chaldean Oracles form an important part of the West- ern Esoteric Tradition. Although the Chaldeans had an Oracle that was as highly regarded as the Delphic Oracle, the word Oracles was probably imparted to these fragments to imply the idea that they were of a highly profound and spiritual nature. The empha- sis of these scraps of knowledge is on non-objective realities that Platonists call \"the intelligible world.\" In order to understand this realm, the intellect can be employed to understand the various concepts which flow from it, but not their origin. In order to comprehend the nature of the source of the universe, the Oracles strongly imply that the practice of Theurgy is required. (Theurgy means \"god-working\" -it is a word used to indicate highly philosophical magical workings.) While philosophy can steer one's thoughts to the contemplation of the Divine, Theurgy is a method of securing union with the Divine. The focus of Chaldean Oracles is therefore a description of the spiritual scheme of the universe and a portrayal of the practices used in Theurgy to contact and unite with the Divine Source of the universe. According to the Oracles, a human being is composed of Three Souls (or Vehicles) which clothe the physical body. The first is the Intelligible or Divine part of the Soul or the \"radiant vehicle.\" The second is the Intellect or Rational part of the Soul. The third is the Irrational or Passionate part of the Soul (which approximates the astral body). The first is immortal, the third is perishable, and the second may be attracted and assimilated to either the first or the last. The Oracles describe a threefold pattern of cosmic realities. The first princi- ple is a self-manifesting eternal and Intellectual Fire called the \"Father of the gods.\" The second principle is the feminine World-Soul or living power called Hecate. It is she who flows eternally and sustains all the worlds. The third principle is the sec- ond Intellect, Apollo, who constructs the various realms and sends his perceptions into them. In describing these principles, the Oracles use the word \"Intelligible\" to portray a power which transcends all human intellectual comprehension. It is these three principles that the Theurgist or high magician attempts to contact and make psychic union with-requiring abilities beyond that of the human intellect. The Oracles indicate that several prefatory purifications are needed to per- form the sacred rites, but only the divine vehicle of the Soul can withstand the Intel- lectual Fire of the Divine. However the Theurgist must also gain awareness of his/her own personal Angelic guide prior to any important magical working."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"334 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoWEN DAWN 1'RAomoN After all the necessary purifications are performed the Theurgist must invoke certain deities who are associated with the time of the ritual. In this way the Supreme god of Tune may be invoked and entreated to assist the magician and reveal the names of even greater deities. The Chaldean Oracles explain that there are in reality two sets of divine names to be used by the Theurgist: one is spoken verbally to link the magician with that which the name symbolizes, the other i.s an unspoken name or \"watchword.\" This name has been \"forgotten\" by the con- scious mind of the individual by the descending of the Soul into matter. It can only be revealed to the practitioner by the Angelic guide or invoked deities. The purpose of the rite is then stated clearly: namely the rising of the Theurgist's Soul into union with the Godhead. Sacrifice and total commitment to the Higher are essential on the part of the magician. Thus the totality of the Theur- gist's being is focused like a laser beam on the work at hand. Next, according to the Oracles, the gods themselves appear, from the lowest Elementals to Hecate herself-the second principle of the World Soul. The details are scarce but at this point the exaltation of the magician's Soul is accomplished, though it is summa- rized as a type of battle wherein the Soul fights off obstacles and pushes upwards toward the heavenly Light symbolized by Apollo, the third principle. The Solar Fire then plunges downward to join with the upward rushing human Soul, result- ing in a glorious union with the Divine. After the marriage of human with divinity, the Soul returns the way it came, but preserving a full memory of the transforming experience. Ancient magi- cians believed that given enough practice with this technique, it could be employed at the time of death as a means of gaining immediate ascension to the Divine Light. Thus the whole Theurgic experience described in the Oracles could be summed up as a conscious transformation (both physical and psychological) designed to activate a spiritual current of energy which brings the magician closer to the divine eternal principles of the universe. These are also the ideas referred to in the Practicus Ritual as spoken by the Samothracian Kabiri. * Following the 3 = 8 initiation, the task of the Practicus is to thoroughly assimilate all knowledge related to the Element of Water and the Planet Mercury. Most of this information is contained in the Fourth Knowledge Lecture, which also contains additional information on Literal Qabalah, and the Tarot. Ceremo- nial work and exercises appropriate to the grade, are also included. The Task of the Practicus is to bear in mind the perfect Alchemical equilib- rium of the two Primary Elements and always recall the phrase, \"Except ye be born of Water and the Spirit ye cannot enterthe Kingdom of heaven. \"*"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade THE INITIATION CEREMONY 335 Temple setup: The aspirant will need to set up the Hall beforehand in accordance with the temple diagram. The black cubical altar is placed in the center of the room. Upon it should be placed the Tarot card of Judgment. Two large candle hold- ers complete with candles'? flank the Northern and Southern sides of the altar. (If you do not own such large candle holders, an average pair of candles and candle holders can be placed on top of the altar on either side of the Tarot card.) The pil- lars are placed in the Northeast part of the Hall before the Dais. The Hebrew letter Shin is shown on a large plaque in the Northeast. The letter Tau is directly East, while the letter Qoph is in the Southeast. The Banners of the East and West are located near their respective officers. The Enochian Tablet of Water is placed in the West, and Tablets of Earth and Air are also shown. A cup of Water is also needed in the West. Place the lamens and implements in accordance with the temple dia- gram, in the positions of the officer-forms. The station of Hierophant is located in the East, while the Hiereus and Hegemon are stationed in the Northwest and Southwest respectively. In addition, you will need three red lamps or candles to be placed by each officer's station. As in the previous ritual, all of the Elemental candles should be placed around the circumference of the room, with a white candle in the East. The Blue Water candle is to be placed before the Enochian Tablet of the West. The lights on the pillars should be unshaded. A censer of burning incense should be placed in the South. (Note: For other segments of the ritual, the aspirant will need the following items close at hand: plaques of the Hebrew letters Resh, Mem, Ayin, and Peh, as well as the Qamea, seal and sigils of Mercury, the Tarot card of The Sun, and the diagram of the Garden of Eden before the Fall [see Plate 3]. You will need three Admis- sion Badges for this ceremony: the Pyramid of Flame, the Solar Greek Cross of Thirteen Squares, and the Cup of Stolistes Badge.) Ritual preparations: The aspirant should fast for a period of 12 hours prior to the ritual. A ritual bath is required after which the aspirant may put on the black Tau robe, and red slippers. The sash will need to be decorated with the Practicus emblems, but it is not to be worn by the candidate at this time. Place the sash inside the altar. The aspirant must meditate for a certain length of time on a drawing of the symbol of Water-a Water triangle (apex downward) in blue. Next s/he must spend a period of time (20-30 minutes) in a darkened room or antechamber to the temple seated in quiet meditation while wearing a hoodwink or blindfold. The Admission Badge for the 31st Path, the Pyramid of Flame, should be held in the right hand throughout this period. A small blue candle is to be the only source of light in the room. During this time, darkness and silence are to be maintained.

The sound of reed pipes, drums, chants and cymbals is raised to a deafening uproar which continues until dusk. With the coming of nightfall, the celebration turns more somber. Pine torches are passed out among the participants to be lighted from the hestia or public hearth fire. Then single file, the group proceeds up a well worn hillside path. Past rocky outcrop- pings and stunted trees, the procession eventually winds through the darkness to the stony side of a cliff where the mouth of a large cavern is flanked by the carved images of two dogs holding great torches.

Briskly you walk past the brazen altar and the Laver, entering the outer chamber of the Holy Place before the golden altar. As in your previous visit, you offer up coals and incense and perform the Qabalistic Cross. Then crossing the chamber, the veil before you separates and you stand again before the sacred Ark. You gaze into the Divine Light that is perched atop the golden Mercy Seat between the two winged Kerubim. Another vision of the Garden of Eden presents itself to you: You see before you the Tree of Life, completely formed through the action of the Lightning Bolt which you witnessed in the Theoricus grade. On the right is the pillar of brilliant flame, while on the left is the dark pillar of swirling clouds. At the Summit of the Tree is a great and beautiful goddess with long dark hair and the sculptured face of an Egyptian. She is AIMA, the Supreme and ever- lasting Mother who resides within the realm of the Three Supernals. The goddess is the shining image of divinity and her face is full of grace and compassion. She wears a gleaming crown of stars and her ethereal white robe is ornamented with the golden orb of the Sun. She stands upon a silver dais which is the Crescent Moon itself. You are aware of a divine name which enters your mind, YOD HEH VAV HEH ELOHlM. The combination of the masculine god YAH with the feminine goddess ELOAH results in a unified masculine/feminine deity-YHVH ELOHlM, who is both male and female, yet who transcends both of these terms. YHVH ELO- HIM is the essence of masculine vitality and feminine creativity. However the outer appearance that this Being presents to the world below the Supernals is feminine-the great Mother AIMA. And from her Supernal feet flows a perpetual stream of water, the mighty river Naher, the Never-failing waters which nourish the bountiful supply of plant and animal life in the Garden of Eden. The river Naher contains the Waters of Life, clear as crys- tal bringing forth all living things and inanimate objects which comprise the manifest universe. The river flows from the feet of the goddess to the sphere of Daath, where it is separated into the four rivers which divide the Garden into the four Cardinal Points of East, West, North, and South. The combined rivers water the Garden of Eden, the Tree of Life, and all of Creation in its primal splendor. Before your eyes the rivers form an equal-armed cross.

In Malkuth stands the mighty crowned goddess Eve, who supports the entire Tree of Life with her delicate yet strong arms. She single-handedly holds up the two great opposing pillars of Fire and Cloud, Light and Darkness. She stands fearlessly in the realm of matter, sustaining the universe by completing and solidifying the Tree of Life in the physical world. Beneath her feet, under the very soil and stones and burrowing earth creatures, is a great and terrible dragon coiled in sleep. This beast has seven heads and ten horns, the Seven Infernal Palaces and the Ten Averse Sephiroth. It is the inverted and evil Tree which mirrors the Tree of Life. The abode of the Dragon is the kingdom of shells (cast-off forms and shadows) that lies directly below Malkuth. At the feet of the goddess Eve grows another Tree, the tree of the knowledge of Good and of Evil, which is between the Tree of Life and the Kingdom of Shells. The upper branches of this Tree reach upwards to the seven lower Sephiroth, but the lower branches reach downward to the seven Infernal Palaces of the Qlippoth. The fruit carried on the upper branches of the Tree (good) is sweet and with- out blemish, while the fruit on the lower branches (evil) is bruised and poisonous. This implies that knowledge can be used for the pur- poses of good, or it can equally be abused for the purposes of evil. In this lies an important truth, as well as a great responsibility. Gradually, this vision of the Garden of Eden fades once more into the brilliant Light above the mercy Seat of the Ark. The curtain before you closes and obscures the Ark and its guardians. You are again in the astral temple of Hod. 361 Bring the focus of your conscious mind back to the Practicus Hall. Perform the adoration to the Lord of the universe.

Thea River Naher wentforth out of Eden, namely from the Supernal Triad, to water the Garden (the rest of the Sephiroth), and from thence it was divided into Four Heads in Daath, whence it is said \"In Daath the Depths are broken up and the clouds drop down dew.\" Thefirst Head is PISON, which flows into Geburah (whence there is Gold). It is theRiverof Fire. The Second Head is GIHON, the River of Waters, flowing into Chesed.

I) The Fourth Knowledge Lecture SECTION 1: Admission Badges and Diagrams The Solid Triangle, Tetrahedron or Pyramid of Fire, is the Admission Badge for the Path of Shin in the 3 = 8 grade. It is an appropriate symbol of Fire, representing the simple Fire of Nature and the Latent or Hidden Fire. It is formed of four triangles, three visible and one concealed, which yet is the synthesis of the rest. The three upper triangles represent Solar Fire, Volcanic Fire, and Astral Fire, while the fourth and basal triangle represents latent heat. Active Fire is AUD, pas- sive Fire is AUB, equilibrated Fire is AUR, while the name of Fire itself is ASCH. The Greek Cross of13 Squares, is the Admission Badge to the Path of Resh in the 3 = 8 grade. It is formed of 13 squares which fitly refer to the Sun's motion through the Zodiac. The Celestial Signs are further arranged in the arms of the cross according to the four Elements with the Sun in the center and representing that luminary as the center of the whole figure. The Cup of Stolistes, is the Admission Badge to the Water temple of Hod in the Practicus grade. Based upon the lamen of the Stolistes, this Badge is an explicit representation of the same energies utilized by that officer.This Badge partakes to some extent of the symbolism of the Laver of Moses and the Sea of Solomon. On the Tree of Life, it embraces nine of the Sephiroth, exclusive of Kether. Yesod and Malkuth form the triangle below, the former the apex, the latter the base. Like the Caduceus, it further represents the three primary Elements of Water, Air, and Fire. The crescent is the Water which is above the Firmament, the circle is the Firmament, and the triangle is the consuming Fire below, which is opposed to the Celestial Fire symbolized by the upper part of the Caduceus. The cup is a symbol of spiritual receptiveness. The Symbol of Mercury on the Tree of Life embraces all but Kether.

It shows in a glyph the teaching proper to the Practicus on entering the Sephirah Hod which he has reached by the Paths of Shin and Resh from Malkuth and Yesod respectively. At the summit are the Three Supernal Sephiroth summed up into One Aima Elohim, the Mother Supernal The Woman of the Apocalypse clothed with the Sun, the Moon under her feet, and on her head the Crown of Twelve Stars. It is written So the Name Jehovah is joined to the Name Elohim, for Jeho- vah planted a Garden Eastward in Eden. From the Three Supernals follow the other Sephiroth of the Tree of Life. Below the Tree, proceeding from Malkuth is The Tree of Knowledge of Good and of Evil which is between the Tree of Life and the World of Assiah or Shells, repre- sented by the Coiled up Dragon with Seven Heads and Ten Horns being the Seven Infernal Palaces and the Ten Averse Sephiroth. The River NAHAR ('M~) flows forth from the Supernal Eden and in Daath it is divided into Four Heads: PISON (r'W~&): Fire flowing to Geburah where there is Gold. GIHON <r'M~')): Water the Waters of Mercy, flowing into Chesed. HIDDIKEL (~i\"M): Air flowing into Tiphareth. PHRATH (Euphrates) (M'&): Earth flowing into Malkuth. It is written In Daath the Depths are broken up and the Clouds drop down dew. The word Nahar has the meaning perennial stream never failing waters as opposed to other words meaning Torrent or Brook. The River going out of Eden is the River of the Apocalypse, the Waters of Life, clear as crystal proceeding from the Throne, on either side of the Tree of Life, bearing all manner of Fruit. Thus the Rivers form a Cross and on it The Great Adam, the Son who is to rule the Nations, was extended from Tiphareth and his arms stretch out to Geburah and Gedulah, and Malkuth is Eve, supporting with her hands the Two Pillars.?? As a important note of interest, archeologists have recently theorized that the land called Eden was once a fertile plain in a region now covered by the waters of the Persian Gulf. The words Eden and Adam are pre-Sumerian words for fertile plain, and settlement on the plain. The names of the rivers Hiddekel, Gihon, Pison, and Euphrates are probably linguistic remnants of a people who lived in the area before the Sumerians appeared. The Rivers Phrath (Euphrates) and Hiddekel (Tigris) still flow today. But scientists have recently discovered, via pictures from space, images of a fossil river which once flowed 98 Optional Diagram. 99 The above section is from Regardie s The Golden Dawn."},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"The Cupof Stolistes Badge lll> -- ~ v.

Some archeologists now believe that the Karun river which rises in Iran and flows southwest to the Gulf was in fact the ancient river Gihon. The river Gihon brings up the geographical problem in that it is supposed to \"encompass the whole land of Ethiopia.\" The Hebrew script refers to it as the land of Kush. Seventeenth-eentury translators of the King James Bible rendered this as \"Ethiopia.\" Kush could in fact refer instead to Kashshu and the Kashshites, a people who occupied Mesopotamia from 1500 to 900 BCE. All of these ancient rivers could have joined a single river that once ran through a rich fertile area (Eden) which was flooded by the Persian Gulf in approximately 5000 to 4000 BCE, when a sudden rise in sea levels occurred around the world. Thus the Genesis passage referring to the river of Eden dividing and forming four heads, is rooted in geography as well as in spiritual legend. The diagram of the Garden of Eden, along with its counterpart in the fol- lowing grade, holds the keys to many psychological and spiritual dilemmas which besiege the aspirant. In fact both diagrams taken together can be said to outline the entire magical philosophy. The diagram of Eden before the Fall is a pictorial embodiment of the three basic principles in humanity; the three Qabalistic parts of the Soul. Each principle is seemingly independent from and oblivious to the others. An early evolutionary stage in the history of the human race is symbolized here-a time when humans were not sentient beings-there was no such thing as self-consciousness. It was to coin a phrase, an age of innocence, when peace and tranquillity reigned by right of birth not by toil. Bear in mind that what is meant by peace here is psychological peace rather than a peaceful environment. Certainly the first human-ereatures on Earth did not often have peaceful surroundings. But since self-consciousness (sentience) had not yet been born into the mind of humanity, there were no psychological conflicts such as those which torture so many Souls today. The diagram is revealed in the 3 = 8 Grade because the Element of Water is an appropriate expres- sion of this tranquil existence. At the top of the drawing is a great goddess with a diadem of twelve stars and clothed with the glory of the Sun who stands upon the crescent moon. Her symbolism refers to the archetypal or Supernal mind-state, thus she is a glyph of the Neshamah or Highest Self of the Soul. At the bottom of the Tree is Eve, the symbol of the Nephesh, standing in balanced opposition to the Divine Self. The goddess Eve is the dark and extremely ancient terrestrial feminine principle of passions and instincts, which dates back to the primeval origins of human physiology. Reconciling between these two goddesses is Adam, sus- tained by the might of Eve. Adam represents the Ruach not yet aware its own latent power and potential. Moreover, he symbolizes humankind as a whole; he is a personified glyph of the collective creative principle or manifesting Light incarnating into humanity; touching upon the Divine above him and the instinc- tive below him. Adam can also be said to represent the aspirant of the mysteries"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"o ~ ....:I \"5- ~ ~ ~ 8 !Y i:' ::t t ~ \"5- ] ~ lU ~ 370"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 371 at a point in time preceding the arousal of any \"personal demons\" buried deep within the mod- ern subconscious mind.

In addition to to colors, musical notes, incenses, gemstones, metals, and other items, the var- ious Sephirotic and Planetary energies are also correlated (first and foremost) to the idea of numerical value. The numbers and lineal fig- ures appropriate to Planets are: Saturn Jupiter Mars Sun Venus Mercury Moon 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Triangle Square Pentagram Hexagram Heptagram Octagram Enneagram Additional lineal figures that the Practicus should be aware of are the Rhombus and the Vesica. A Rhombus is an equilateral parallelogram (or four-sided figure whose opposing sides are parallel and equal) with no right angles. In such a figure, each side is identical to the side opposite it. A diagonal line drawn between two oppo- site points on the rhomboid would form two congruent triangles. The figure of a rhombus is very similar to that the vesica. A Vesica is a pointed oval formed by the intersection of two circles. It is the \"common ground\" shared by both circles, and is often used to symbolize a state of transition, transference or transcendence.

For example, in the Heptangle for Netzach, the Heptagon and the two forms of the Heptagram should be united in the same Talisman, the extremities of the angles coinciding. The Endekangle is attributed to the Qlippoth, the Dodekangle to Zodiacal Forces in Malkuth. Kether hath the Primum Mobile, Chokmah the Sphere of the Zodiac in command, and Malkuth that of the elements. And many other meanings are bound together in the lineal figures besides those which are given in this book. Two or more different lineal figures may be bound together in the same Talisman. The Triangle is the only lineal figure into which all surfaces can be reduced, for every Polygon can be divided into triangles by drawing lines from its angles to its center; and the triangle is the first and simplest of all lineal figures. It refers to the Triad operating in all things, to the Three Supernal Sephiroth and to Binah, the Third Sephirah, in particular. Among the Planets it is especially referred to Saturn, and among the Ele- ments to Fire, and, as the color of Saturn is black, and that of Fire red, the black Tri- angle will represent Saturn, and the red, Fire. 100 From an abridged Order Document in Regardie's The Golden Dawn."},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 373 The Three Angles also symbolize the three Alchemical Principles of Nature: Salt, Sulphur and Mercury. The Square is an important lineal figure, which naturally represents stabil- ity and equation. It includes the idea of surface and superficial measurement. It refers to the Quaternary in all things, and to the Tetrad of the Holy Name YHVH operating through the four Elements of Fire, Water, Air and Earth. It is allotted to Chesed, the 4th Sephirah, and among the Planets to Jupiter. And as representing the Four Elements, it represents their ultimation in the Material Form. The Pentangle can be traced in two ways: reflected from every second point, when it is called the Pentagon; and reflected from every third point when it is called the Pentagram. The Pentangle as a whole is referred to the Fifth Sephirah, Geburah. The Pentagon naturally represents the power of the Pentad, operating in Nature by the dispersal of the Spirit and the four Elements through it. The Pentagram with a single point upwards is called the \"Sign of the Microcosm,\" and is a good symbol, representing man with his arms and legs extended adoring his Creator, and especially the dominion of the Spirit over the four Elements, and consequently of reason over matter. But with the single point downwards it is a very evil symbol. The Head of the Goat, or Demon's Head, representing the abasement of reason beneath the blind forces of matter, the elevation of anarchy above order, and of conflicting forces driven by chance above God. It represents the concentrated force of the Spirit and the four Elements governed by the five letters of the Name of the Restorer of all things YHShVH, and it is especially attributed to the Planet Mars. It also shows the Kerubim and the Wheel of the Spirit. It is a symbol of tremendous force, and of HEH, the letter of the Great Supernal Mother AlMA. The Hexangle can be traced in two ways as a complete symbol: viz, reflected from every 2nd point, when it is called the Hexagon, and reflected from every 3rd point when it is called the Hexagram. The Hexangle as a whole is referred to the 6th Sephirah, Tiphareth. The Hexangle naturally represents the powers of the Hexad operating in Nature, by the dispersal of the rays of the Plan- ets, and of the Zodiac emanating from the Sun. The number of degrees of a great circle cut off between its angles is sixty, forming the astrological sextile aspect, powerful for good. It is not so consonant to the Sun nature as the Hexagram, and remember thou, that the 'Con signifieth dispersion, distribution, and radiation of a force; but the 'Cram concentration. Hence use thou the 'Gon for spreading, and the 'Gram for concentration and sealing; and when there is need, thou canst compare, interpose and combine them; but the 'Gon initiateth the whirl. The Hexagram with a single point uppermost is called the Sign of the Macrocosm, or greater world, because its six angles fitly represent the six days or periods of Creation evolved from the manifestation of the Triune; while its syn- thesis forms the seventh day, a period of rest, summed up in the hexagonal center.

It alludes to the power of the Septenary acting through all things, as exemplified by the seven colors of the rainbow. The Heptagram reflected from every 3rd point yieldeth 7 triangles at the apices thereof; fitly representing the Triad operating in each Planet, and the Plan- ets themselves in the week and the year. The Heptagram is the Star of Venus, and is especially applicable to her nature.

This Octagram reflected from every fourth point is the Star of Mercury, and is especially applicable to his nature. It is further a potent symbol, representing the binding together of the concentrated Positive and Negative Forces of the Elements under the Name of IAHOONHI. And forget not that ADONAI is the key of YHVH. The Enneangle as a whole is referred to the 9th Sephirah Yesod. It naturally representeth the power of the Ennead, and the Enneagon showeth the Ennead operating in Nature by the dispersal of the rays of the seven Planets and of the Head and Tail of the Dragon of the Moon. The Enneagram reflected from every 3rd point representeth the Triple Ternary operating both in the 7 Planets with the Caput and Cauda Draconis of the Moon, and with the Alchemical principles counterchanged and interwoven. It is not so consonant with the Nature of Luna as the Enneagram reflected from every 5th Point. The Enneagram is the Star of Luna, and is especially applicable to her nature. It represents her as the administratrix to the Earth of the virtues of the Solar System under the Sephiroth. The Enneagram reflected from every fourth point is composed of three tri- angles united within a circle, and alludes to the Triple Ternary of the three alchem- ical principles themselves.

The number of degrees of a Great Circle cut off between its angles is 36, the half of the Quintile astrological aspect. The Dekagram reflected from every 3rd point is especially consonant with Malkuth, and shows the Triad operating through the angle of the two Pentagons within a circle, of which it is composed. It alludes to the combination of the three Alchemical Principles with the Spirit and the Four Elements in their Positive and Negative form, under the presidency of the Ten Sephiroth themselves. The Dekagram reflected from every 5th point is composed of two Penta- grams within a circle. It shows the operation of the duplicated Heh of the Tetra- grammaton, and the concentration of the Positive and Negative forces of the Spirit and of the four Elements under the presidency of the potencies of the Five in Binah; the Revolutions of the Forces under Aima, the Great Mother. The Endekangle (and Endekad) as a general rule is referred to the Qlippoth: of its forms however, the one reflected from every 4th point represents their restriction, and therefore it is not altogether to be classed with those that represent their operations in Nature. The Endekangle naturally represents the evil and imperfect nature of the Endekad, and the Endekagon represents the dispersal of the eleven curses of Mount Ebal through the Universe ( Deut. XXVll).(Though they are paraphrased as 12 in the English Bible, in the Hebrew version they are para- graphed as eleven, two being classed together.) The Dodekangle as a general rule is referred to the Zodiac, and naturally represents the power of the Dodekad. The Dodekagon shows the dispersal of the influence of the Zodiac through nature, the Dodekagram its concentration. The number of degrees of a Great Cir- cle cut off between its angles is 30, forming the weak astrological semi-Sextile aspect, good in nature and operation.e Magic Squares The Qameoth or magical squares of the Planets, are both diagrams as well as potent mystical pentacles which relate to the Planets and to specific Planetary energies. The word Qamea comes from a Hebrew root word meaning talisman or amulet, but the word also has connections with the English word \"cameo.\" Although the magic squares are best known through the works of such magicians as Cornelius Agrippa (Occult Philosophy) and Peter De Abano (The Heptameron), they are undoubtedly of ancient and probably Persian origin. The magical squares of the Planets are formed of the squares of the num- ber of the Planet, arranged so as to yield the same number each way (horizontal, vertical and diagonal). The number of the sum of each column of figures and the number of the total of all the numbers of the square, are also numbers especially attached to the Planet. The number of lesser squares or units on each side of the Qamea determines which Planet it is associated with through correspondence of"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"378 SELF-INTIlATION IN'IO THE GoWEN DAWN TRADmON the number of the appropriate Sephirah. Thus the number of the Planet Saturn is 3 (Binah), square 9, sum of all columns vertical, horizontal and diagonal-iS; total sum of all numbers-4S. Thus one can easily see from this example that there are many numbers contained in each Qamea which are designated as Planetary num- bers. These numbers are then formed into Divine and Spirit names (and sigils) which correlate to certain Planetary energies. The Planetary energies are said to include Archangels, Intelligences and Spir- its. The Names of these beings are themselves derived from the primary numbers of the square. The administrative force is the Planetary Archangel. The Intelli- gence of a Planet is seen as an evolutionary, nurturing, inspiring or guiding entity, while the Spirit is traditionally viewed as a blind or \"raw\" energy force without guidance or intelligence. The Spirit must always be guided by the Planetary Intel- ligence, under the control of the Archangel. A sigil or seal is a magical symbol that contains the seed or essence of a spirit or deity. The word is derived from the Latin word sigillum, which means a sign or signature. It is the magical glyph that is derived from a name or magic for- mula by a process of numerical conversion the result of which is traced upon a Qamea (or similar device). The method of Gematria known as Aiq Beker is very important to the drawing of sigils on a Qamea (Refer to the section on Aiq Beker.) The Planetary seal or sigil of the Planet is a symbol designed in such a man- ner that its traced lines touch every number or unit square of the Qamea. The seal is used in talismanic magic to represent the Qamea or act as a governing force for it. The Qameoth are very important in the designing of talismans; magical objects which are ceremonially consecrated to attract a particular Planetary, Sephi- rotic, Zodiacal or Elemental force. Designing such talismans is part of the grade- work of an Adept. However, many published versions of the Qameoth as well as their corresponding Planetary Sigils often contain mistakes. The student would be well advised to never trust a sigil to be correct simply because it is published. The magician should always work sigils out for him/her self.

However, this is not true of the magic constant. Although many occultists know what the magic constant (or mystical number) of a Qamea is, they often do not know how it is arrived at. A mathematical formula is needed to determine the magic constant of each Qamea. The formula for finding the magic constant of any given Qamea is: N3+N 2 In all of these formulas, \"N\" stands for the number of the Sephirah that corre- sponds to the Planet involved. For example in the case of the Saturn square, N = 3. The formula for finding the MC would follow: N3+N = 3x3x3+3 = 27+3 = 30 = 15 2 2 2 2 The magic constant of the Saturn square is 15. To find the MC of the Jupiter square we would use the same formula, the only difference is that in this case N = 4. ~ = 4x4x4+4 = Q!cl = ~ = 34 2 2 2 2 The magic constant of the Jupiter square is 34. Besides the magic constant and the grand total, there is another Planetary number that is crucial to the understanding of magic squares, the arcane compliment. The arcane compliment (AC) is a hidden number which controls how the numbers are placed on a Qamea. It is a number which determines the arrange- ment of all the numbers on the magic square. There are two different formulas for finding the arcane complement-one for odd-numbered magic squares, the other for even-numbered Qameoth. Odd Squares: The formula for finding the AC of an odd square is: N2+1 2 Remember that in the case of Saturn, N = 3, the number of Binah. The formula is worked out as follows: N2+1 = 3x3+1 = 9+1 = 1Q = 5 2 2 2 2 The arcane compliment of the Saturn square is 5. And on all of the odd- numbered Qameoth, the AC is always placed in the exact center of the square. The numbering of the lesser squares or units starts immediately below the arcane com- pliment, beginning with the number 1. To place the remaining numbers on the square, one must not think of the Qamea as just a flat surface with numbers. The magic square must be visualized as being cylindrical or spherical. If the paper Qamea was rolled into a tube, the"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"388 SELF-INITIATION IN10 ras GoLDEN DAWN 1'RADmoN right and left columns of numbers would then touch each other. Had the tube been rolled the other way, the top and bottom rows of numbers would touch each other. Either way, the columns and rows of numbers on the Qamea should be imagined as being connected on all sides. (The best way for the student to learn the method of number placement, is to draw up a blank Saturn square.) The remaining numbers after 1 then begin in a downward progression to the right. The number 2 would be placed on a unit below the lower right-hand comer of the Qamea, but since there is no square there to place the number, the 2 would be placed in the next available space at the top of the next column. The downward progression to the right would continue, so that the next number, 3, is placed in the middle of the first column. The next number, 4, encounters a problem, in that it would normally fall into a space that is already occupied by another number-I. When a number's natural progression is blocked by another number, the rule is to drop the new number straight down (in its original column) by two spaces. Since in our Qamea, the bottom row is imagined to touch the top row, the number 4 will drop down two spaces and end up in the upper left-hand comer of the square. The number 5 is the arcane compliment, which has already been placed in its proper position at the center of the Qamea. The following number 6, continues the downward progression to the right. The number 7 is blocked by the number 4, so it drops two spaces down and falls into the unit in the middle of the right-hand column. The numbers 8 and 9 then follow the usual progression. This is the complete formula for figuring out the arcane complement and the placement of numbers on all of the odd-numbered squares. Even Squares: The formula for the arcane complement of any even square is: N2+1 Remember that in the case of Jupiter, N = 4, the number of Chesed. The formula is worked out as follows: N2+1 = 4x4+1 = 16+1 = 17 The AC of the Jupiter square is 17. But in order to place all of the numbers on an even square, a different method is called for. Using the Jupiter square as the example, one must first draw a blank Qamea that is composed of 16 units (4 x 4). The squares are then numbered in pro- gression starting from the upper right-hand comer, going from right to left-I, 2, 3,4, etc., until all 16 squares are numbered. Then draw a large \"X\" through the Qamea from comer to comer. Then a second blank Qamea is drawn. This new Qamea is then filled in with numbers from the previous one, but only with the numbers that are touched by the \"X.\" The remaining (untouched) numbers from the first Qamea are then sub- tracted from the arcane complement (17). The final numbers arrived at are then"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 389 placed into the remaining blank squares of the second Qamea.

It exists primarily in three forms which have been of great value to magicians throughout the ages. These include Gematria, Natariqan, and Temurah. Gematria The method of assigning numbers to each of the Hebrew letters is known as Gema- tria. The ancient Hebrews did not have a separate set of figures to describe num- bers. Instead they used the letters of their alphabet. Gematria developed as a process of ascribing meaning to numbers and determining the meanings of words from their numerical value. This is usually accomplished by converting words into their numeral values and comparing them to the values of other words in order to acquire a new perspective on the original meaning. Words which share the same numerical value are said to have a significant relationship to one another. For example the name Ruach Elahim (the Spirit of the gods) in Hebrew has a numeral value of 300 (Ruach = Resh: 200, Vav: 6, Cheth: 8 = 214-Elohim = Aleph: I, Lamed: 30, Heh: 5, Yad: 10, Mem: 40 = 86). 300 is the same as the value of the Hebrew letter Shin, which incidentally is the symbol of the Ruach Elohim. (Note: The student could take this one step further by lopping off the two zeros. This would leave 3, the number of Gimel, thus pointing to a relationship between the Ruach Elohim and the Tarot card of The High Priestess.) In another case, the Hebrew word Achad which means \"one\" or \"unity\" has the numeral value of 13, the same value as the word Ahevah, \"love.\" Therefore a relationship exists between these Hebrew words. In a final example, 26 is the number given to the Tetragrammaton- YHVH- the most sacred name of the Divine (Yad: 10 + Heh: 5 + Vav: 6 + Heh: 5 = 26). Twenty-six is also the number of the Middle Pillar on the Tree of Life (counting the value of the Sephiroth: 1+6+9+10=26). (Note: In the study of Gematria one will find numerous cases of sublime names and concepts sharing numerical values with low and demonic ones. The student is advised to consider this as an example of the Hermetic axiom \"As above, so below.\" Even the highest heavens have their equivalents in the lowly abode of shells.) 101 Many of the other even-numbered squares follow increasingly complex methods of numerical arrangement that we will not explore here. However these formulas will be examined in depth in a forthcoming book by Adam Forrest, who has also published two new magic squares (the Qamea of the Elements and that of Mazzaloth or the Zodiac) in Book 1 of The Golden Dawn Journal."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"300 30 3 200 20 2 100 10 1 t:l ~ ~ , ~ ~ i' ~ N 600 60 6 500 50 5 400 40 4 C C , , ~ M ~ ~ , 900 90 9 800 80 8 700 70 7 r ~ tQ e, ~ n r v , 300 30 3 100 10 1 200 20 2 BINAH KETHER CHOKMAH t:l ~ ~ i' ~ M , ~ ~ 500 50 5 600 60 6 40040 4 GEBURAH TIPHARETH CHESED , ~ M C C , ~ ~ , 800 80 8 900 90 9 700 70 7 HOD YESOD NETZACH e, ~ n r ~ tQ r V , Aiq Beker- The Qabalah of Nine Chambers 390"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 391 Aiq Reker: The method known as Aiq Beker is an important tool of Gematria used not only to convert letters into numbers, but also to create sigils and talismans. In order to trace the sigil of an Angel or Spirit name on a magic square, it is important to first reduce the name to the lowest possible numerical value that will fit on a given Qamea. This is done by using an ancient Qabalistic technique known as Aiq Beker or the Qabalah of Nine Chambers. This is a diagram that shows three rows and three columns (a total of nine chambers) of numbers which are grouped together accord- ing to the similarity of their numbers. (For example in one chamber, Gimel, Lamed and Shin are placed because of their numbers 3, 30, and 300.) The numbers in this diagram, from 1 to 900 are read from right to left, in the same manner that Hebrew is read. The name Aiq Beker comes from reading the Hebrew letters in the first two chambers from 1 to 200: Aleph, Yod, Qoph, and Beth, Kaph, Resh. (Note: a second form of the diagram shows the chambers arranged in accordance with the Sephiroth on the Tree of Life.) For example, if one wanted to trace the sigil of the Intelligence of Saturn, AGIEL, on the Saturn square, the numerical value of each Hebrew letter of the name would have to be reduced to nine or less than nine (nine is the highest num- ber on the Saturn square). The letters in the name are Aleph-I, Gimel-3, Yod-l0, Aleph-I, and Lamed-30. The only letters which need to be reduced in this case are Yod and Lamed, which can be reduced to 1 and 3 using the Aiq Beker chart. The numbers obtained which can be used to trace the sigil on the square are 1, 3, 1, 1, 3. Tracing a Sigil: When tracing a sigil on a Qamea, the first number of the name is marked with a small circle. From there a line is drawn following the progression of the numbers. When the final number of the name is reached, a short line is drawn to indicate the completion of the sigil. Variations in Tracing sigils: If two letters of the same kind such as two Beths or two Gimels are side-by-side within a name, this is represented in the sigil by a wave or crook in the line at that point. If there is a letter in the name through which the line of the sigil passes straight through to meet another letter, a loop or noose is formed at that point to indicate that the letter is indeed a part of the name. (Note: Another way of using Aiq Beker is to take one of the three letters in any given section of the Aiq Beker diagram and exchange it for one of the other two letters in that section. Thus in the first box, the letter Qoph could be substi- tuted for either the letter Aleph or the letter Yod. This manner of using Aiq Beker falls somewhat under the category of Temurah.) Although not a part of the Qabalistic system of Gematria, the Pythagorean Table is worth mentioning in conjunction with Aiq Beker. This Greek-based table shows how our own alphabet can be reduced to numbers:"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"392 SELF-INfTIATION INTO 1HE GoLDEN DAWN TRADmON The Pythagorean Table 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N 0 P Q R S T U V W x y z Notariqon This aspect of the Literal Qabalah derives its name from the Latin word for \"short- hand writer,\" notarius. This is a method for finding acronyms. The first form of Notariqon is expansive, meaning that every letter in a sin- gle word is used to create the initial letter of another word in a sentence. For an example, take the word Berashith, the first word in Genesis. Every letter of this word can be made an abbreviation of another word, yielding the sentence Berashith Rahi Elohim Sheyequebelo Israel Torah, which means \"In the Beginning the gods saw that Israel would accept the law.\" The second form of Notariqon is contractive-a complete reversal of the first form. In this case the first letter of each word in a sentence is taken to create a sin- gle word which is the synthesis of the entire sentence. One example of this a word found in the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, AGLA. The letters of this word are taken from the sentence Atah Gibor Le-Olahm Adonai, which means \"Thou art great forever, my Lord.\" Another example is the word ARARITA which is con- structed from the sentence Achad Rosh Achdotho Rosh Ichudo Temurahzo Achad,102 meaning \"One is his beginning, One is his individuality, his permutation is One.\" For another example we shall cite a word that is commonly used by sev- eral religions, but with little true understanding of its meaning. AMEN is written in Hebrew as Aleph, Mem, Nun, which stands for the phrase Adonai Melekh Na'a- man or \"Lord, Faithful King.\" As a note of interest, one of the names given to the Qabalah is Chokmah Nestorah or the \"secret wisdom.\" The initial letters of this phrase are Cheth and Nun, which form the Hebrew word chen meaning \"grace.\" Thus the Qabalists maintain that certain Biblical passages that refer to God granting His grace to someone are really implying that what he granted was in fact the secret wisdom of the Qabalah. Notariqons may also be formed using letters other than the initial ones, such as the final or middle letters of words. Temurah The word Temurah means \"permutation.\" It is a method of transposing letters sim- ilar to crytography. Using this system, each letter of a word is replaced by another letter, usually in accordance with a chart or table. This can result in a new word which can be compared to the original one in order to provide new interpreta- 102 Israel Regardie gave the wording of this sentence as Achad Raysheethoh; AchadResh Yechidathoh; Temurathoh Achod."},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 393 tions, Temurah is important for interpreting Qabalistic texts such as the Torah, and for creating talismans. Avgad: Asimple form of Temurah in which any letter in a word is replaced by the letter which follows it in the alphabet. Thus the letter Beth could be substi- tuted for Aleph, Daleth for Gimel, etc. Thashrag: The method of writing a word backwards. Boustrophedon: A method of writing in alternating lines, one from right to left, and the other from left to right. (The Shem ha-Mephoresh was derived from Bib- . lical chapter of Exodus using this method.) Tziruph: A method of folding the Hebrew alphabet back upon itself so that one half may be exchanged for the other half. Then by alternately changing the first letter or first two letters at the beginning of the second line, twenty-four combinations are obtained. These are the known collectively as the Table of the Combinations of Tziruph. (See Appendix II for the complete table.) For an example we will use the first of the twenty-four combinations known as Albath: 11 K M 10 I N 9 T S 8 Ch o 7 Z p 6 V Tz 5 H Q 4 D R 3 G Sh 2 B Th 1 A L Each combination from the Table of the Combinations of Tziruph derives its name from the first two pairs of letters from both lines (ALBTh). These letters are the key to the makeup of the system, since either letter in one of the pairs is substituted for the other. Therefore using the method of Albath, the word Ruach (RVCh) would be transformed into Detzau (DTzO). There are four other tables used in Tziruph called the Rational Table, the Right Table, the Averse Table and the Irregular Table. We will not go into detail about these tables except to say that they are each formed from a square containing 484 lesser squares (22 x 22). The Right Table places the letters of the Hebrew alphabet into these squares in their natural succession starting from the upper right-hand comer going from right to left and from top to bottom. The Averse Table begins the natural succession of the letters starting from the upper left-hand comer of the square from left to right, but also from the lower right-hand comer of the square from bottom to top. Alternate Methods Some Qabalists also add hidden meanings to Hebrew words by placing the final form of a letter in the middle of a word, or by not using the usual final form of the let- ter at the end of a word. (Both would change the numerical value of the entire word.) There are also ways of encoding esoteric meanings into words by using odd-sized letters or upside-down letters. Meanings may also be obtained by med- itating on the shape of the Hebrew letters.e"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"394 SELF-INITIATION INTO TIm GoLDEN DAWN 'fRAomoN SECTION 4: Correspondences of Hod The Practicus grade is attributed to the sphere of Hod on the Qabalistic Tree of Life.

Beings and Deities of Water According to the Assyro-Babylonian pantheon, in the beginning of the universe there existed only the god APSU, the primordial ocean of fertile fresh Water and the goddess TIAMAT, the tumultuous and salty Sea. From the mingling of their Waters came MUMMU, the tumult of the waves, and a pair of monstrous serpents, who in turn gave birth to both the celestial world and the terrestrial world, followed by the gods. Tiamat is sometimes depicted as a great dragon. She was slain by the god Marduk and from her body was fashioned the Heavens and the Earth. In Assyro-Babylonian mythology, the rivers were dei- fied. Not only were they seen as the creators of all things, but also as devices of the gods' justice. NAMMU: The Sumerian goddess whose name was expressed by the ideogram for \"sea.\" She was described as \"the mother who gave birth to Heaven and Earth\" and as \"the mother of Enki.\" She is very similar to the cosmic sea personified by the Babylonian Tiamat. EA (or HEA): An Assyro-Babylonian deity whose name means \"house of Water.\" He was the main divinity of the liquid elements.

Ea is often represented as a goat with a fish's tail, although sometimes he is portrayed I as man with waves springing from his shoulders or from a vase which he holds. Sometimes the serpent is mentioned as one of his emblems. Ea's wife was called Davkina, consort of the deep. OANNES: An Assyro-Babylonian deity of the sea who was depicted with the body of a man underneath the body of a fish. Oannes came from the sea to teach humans language, sciences, arts, agriculture, construction, laws and the principles of geo- metrical knowledge.

Nun is represented as a figure standing waist-high in Water, hold- ing his arms up to support his offspring-the gods. TEFNUT: This Egyptian goddess was also more of a theological concept rather than a person. She is the sister and wife of Shu, who she helps to support the sky. Tefnut is the goddess of the dew and the rain. Each morning Shu and Tefnut receive the newborn sun as it breaks free from the mountains of the East. She is depicted as a lioness or a woman with the head of a lion."},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 397 Poseidon modeled the gods,\" -the procreator who engendered the gods and human beings. Khnemu is said to have molded the limbs of Osiris. HAPI: The Egyptian god who personified the river Nile. To the Egyptians, the Waters of the Nile flowed from Nun, the primordial ocean which fed the visible as well the invisible worlds. Hapi was said to reside in a cavern where he poured Water from urns to the heaven and the Earth. Every June the Nile would rise and the worship- pers of Osiris affirmed that the inundation (whose height was dictated by the year's prosperity) was caused by the goddess Isis weeping for her slain husband Osiris. In order that the Waters of the Nile should attain a suitable Hapi height (sixteen cubits), offerings were made to Hapi, often accompanied by the singing of poetic hymns. Hapi is depicted as a vital but somewhat fat man with hanging breasts. He is dressed in the clothes of a fisherman with a narrow belt which supports his huge belly. On his head he wears a crown of Water plants-either lotuses or papyri. POSEIDON (Equivalent to the Roman Neptune): Poseidon was the Greek god of the Sea. His name is derived from a root word which means \"to be master.\" It is likely that he was once a celestial god as his symbol, the trident (a form of the thunderbolt) would seem to indicate. Although he was the equal of his brother Zeus in dignity and birth, he was nonetheless subject to Zeus' power and author- ity. In addition to being the Lord of the Sea, Poseidon was also the master of lakes and rivers. He could shake the Earth at will, and would often split mountains with his trident and roll them into the sea to make islands. His palace was located in the depths of the Aegean Sea. Whenever the god left his palace, he would don golden armor, harness swift golden-maned horses to his chariot, and race across the watery plain with whip in hand. Sea monsters would pay homage to him and frolic in the waves as he passed by. The very sea would open up before him as he sped lightly across the waves. The appearance of Poseidon coincided with fierce storms at sea, a sign of the god's rage. AMPHITRITE: This Greek goddess was the wife of Poseidon and the female personification of the sea. The reluctant goddess was brought to Poseidon by a faithful dolphin. From then on however, she shared his kingdom and his chariot which was at times drawn by tritons (Water beings) blowing on conch shells. She is at times portrayed as holding a trident. PONTUS: The oldest Greek Water god who personified the sea itself. OCEANUS: One of the Greek Titans who was consid- ered the River Ocean which surrounded the universe"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"398 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN 'fRAomoN beyond the seas of the Earth. He was seen as one of those primal forces which had contributed to the manifestation of the world and in power he was second only to Zeus. Oceanus is the one who gave birth to all the rivers, the seas and all the Waters of the Earth. With his sister-wife TETHYS (the goddess who personified the fertility of the sea), Oceanus lived in a palace in the West of the world. Together they sired three thousand rivers. Later the role of Oceanus was greatly diminished as Poseidon became the reigning lord of the sea Triton and the rivers. The daughters of Oceanus were sea nymphs known as the Oceanids. NEREUS: A Greek god who was the son of Pontus and Gaea. Often called \"The Old Man of the Sea,\" he is pictured as a kindly and helpful old man with a long gray beard. Known as \"he who is true and lies not\" this just and gentle god was always true to the laws of righteousness. His abode was in the Aegean Sea and he was known for coming to the aid of sailors. Nereus possessed the gift of prophecy and was the father of the Nereids (sea nymphs). PROTEUS: The son of Oceanus and Tethys, and who was also an \"Old Man of the Sea.\" It was his duty to guard Poseidon's herd of seals. He had the ability to see into the future as well as the talent to change shape at will. PHORCYS: The son of Pontus and Gaea. Phorcys is referred to as \"The Old man who rules the waves.\" His name indicates the white foam upon the crest of the waves, and the god is seen as the personification of the treacherous and tempes- tuous sea. GLAUCUS: The legend concerning this Greek god says that he was once a humble fisherman who became immortal by eating a mysterious herb that grew near the sea. Like many of the marine gods, he had the gift of prophecy. He often appeared to sailors, with his thin body covered with seaweed and seashells, predicting omi- nous events. Another ocean divinity of human origin who is often confused with Glaucus is Melicertes Palaemon, usually represented as a child carried by dolphins. TRITON: The son of Poseidon and Amphitrite, this god was half man, half fish. A benevolent and helpful god who saved the Argonauts from a tempest, Triton also had the gift of prophecy. He could raise or quiet the waves, and he personified the mighty roar of the ocean as well as its movement. Triton was imaged riding the waves on a chariot drawn by horses whose hooves were the claws of crayfish. By blowing on a conch shell, he assumed the powerful voice of the sea. Eventually the name of this god was used to describe a whole race of marine genii, the tritons: half man, half fish who frolicked around the chariot of Amphitrite, blowing on conch shells and cavorting with tile Nereids. Some of these creatures, who were supplied with a pair of horse's legs were known as Centaur-Tritons."},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 399 ACHELOUS: In ancient Greece, the rivers were also ruled by divine beings. 103 These fresh Water gods were portrayed as vigorous men with long beards and a pair of horns on their brow which symbolized their great strength. The most famous of these was Ach- elous, In a fight with the hero Hercules, one of the god's horns was tom off (which became the Horn of Plenty). Six rivers were named after him, and he was invoked when- ever oaths were taken. WATER NYMPHS: In Greek mythology, Achelous every river had a god. But in addition to this, every stream, brook and pond had a lesser Spirit known as a nymph (see Chapter Three). Water nymphs were classified according to their abode. Potamids resided in rivers and streams, Naiads were found in brooks and fountains, Crenae or Pegae were the Spirits of springs, and Limnads were the nymphs of stagnant Waters. Like many Water entities, they had the gift of prophecy and could deliver oracles. Though generally benevolent, they could occasionally become dangerous to those mortals who attracted their affections. MANANNAN: The Celtic Lord of the Sea which lay beyond and above Tir na nOc (Land of Youth),the Celtic Underworld. Manannan was one of the most colorful of the gods-dressed in mail, a golden helmet and carrying a sword which never failed. He traveled in a boat that needed no sails nor oars, propelled only by the will of the god. The sea god played an important role in the well-being of all the gods, for his pigs were killed and eaten daily by them, only to return to life as a never-fail- ing supply of divine food. LLYR: Celtic god of the Sea. AEGIR: A Teutonic Giant 104 who was known as the Lord of the Sea. Treasures swallowed up by the sea were said to adorn his marine palace. His wife was the goddess RAN, who frequently drowned sailors only to reward them with great feasts in the afterlife. MIMIR: Another Teutonic Water giant whose name means \"he who thinks.\" His domain was limited to springs, pools, and lakes. Like Aegir, this giant was on friendly terms with the Teutonic gods. The fountain of Mimir near the roots of the ash tree Y ggdrasil, was the hiding place of all wisdom and knowledge. He was the wise counselor of the god, Odin. 103 Other river gods included: Asopus, Inachus, Cephissus, Peneius, Ladon, Alpheius, Xanthus, and Maeander. 104 In Northern mythology, giants were the personification of great natural forces."},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"400 SELF-INITIATION INTO 1HE GOLDEN DAWN TRADmON NIX: The Teutonic form of an Undine or Water sprite, similar to the Water nymph of the Greeks.

Unlike the Greek nymphs, however, the nixies were frequently malevolent.¢ PART 6: Correspondences of Mercury The planet attributed to the Practicus grade is Mercury. Mercury rules the conscious mind, thoughts, ideas, memory, communica- tions, intellect, logic, abstractions, reason, language, learning, read- ing, writing, the magical Arts, awareness, perceptions, and expres- sion. Mercury governs the rational, thinking part of the human mind as well as that part of us that wishes to communicate with others and express our ideas. It is the \"left-brain\" part that seeks to learn, advance our skills, create, and teach others. The energy of Mercury is active, dexterous, quick, unpredictable and volatile. The planet Mercury takes 88 days to complete one orbit of the sun, and it is never located more than 28 0 from the sun. It is considered an \"androgynous\" or \"neuter\" Planet. In an astrological sense, Mercury is said to be \"cold\" and \"mag- netic.\" The ancients described Mercury as the ruler of the period life dominated by education from the ages 5 to 14. In human anatomy, this planet rules the thyroid gland, the brain, the ner- vous system, the sense of sight, the respiratory system, the tongue and the organs of speech, and the arms and hands as instruments of intelligence and communi- cation. Physical ailments associated with Mercury include nervous disorders, stress, overwork, headaches, loss of memory and impaired respiration. Objects attributed to Mercury include legal documents, books, papers con- nected with money, pictures, writing materials, and anything connected with edu- cation and communications. All flowing and veined substances are attributed to this Planet. In magic, the days and hours of Mercury are used for science and divina- tion, eloquence and intelligence, skill in business, wonders, apparitions, writings, deceit, theft and merchandise. In the days of the week, Mercury rules Wednesday. The symbol of Mercury on the Tree of Life embraces all of the Sephiroth except for Kether. The horns spring out from Daath (Knowledge) which is not, properly speaking, a Sephirah, but rather a conjunction of Chokmah and Binah."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade Hebrew Name: Kokab Sephirah: Hod Archangel: Raphael Day: Wednesday Planetary Intelligence: Tiriel Planetary Spirit: Taphthartharath Olympic Planetary Spirit: Ophiel Metal: Quicksilver Gemstones: Opal, fire opal, agate, serpentine Incenses: Mastic, white sandal, mace, storax Trees: Birch, aspen, mulberry Herbs/plants: Marjoram, fennel, mandrake, lavender, caraway, dill Animals: Jackal, ibis, ape, swallow, twin serpents 401 Mercurial Deities (Gods and Goddesses of Wisdom) ENKI: The Sumerian deity who was one and the same with the god Ea. As Enki he was \"Lord of the Earth,\" the supreme god of WISdom. He was sometimes referred to as Ninigiku, \"Lord of the Sacred Eye\" and \"He from whom nothing escapes.\" Enki presided over magical incantations--often the gods themselves consulted him. As the god of Knowledge, Enki spoke oracularly, and was invoked in incantations. However, he also presided over the work of humans. He was the patron god of stone cutters, carpenters and metalsmiths. Enki was sometimes regarded as the creator of the human race, fashioning mankind from clay. As stated earlier Enki (Ea) is often represented as a goat with a fish's tail, or as a man with waves springing from his shoulders or from a vase which he holds. NABU: The Assyro-Babylonian god who presided over intellectual activities. He was the divine scribe of the gods who engraved the decisions of the deities on the sacred tablets. Nabu could increase or decrease the number of days allotted to each human being. He was declared secretary to the gods because both he and his wife, TASHMETUM, had invented writing. He is depicted with a chisel and engraving tablet, and his emblem (like that of his father, Marduk) is the serpent- headed dragon. DJEHOTI (THOTH or TAHUTI): The Egyptian god who is the patron of wisdom and inventions, science and literature. He is the spokesman of the gods, as well as the divine scribe or record- keeper. It was he who invented all the arts and sciences: geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, surveying, medicine, music, drawing, and writing. He is also the god of magic and the world's first magi- cian. The disciples of Djehoti claimed to have access to magical books of Thoth. When deciphered, these formulas could com- mand all the forces of nature and subdue the gods themselves.

Djehoti is the one who divided time into months, years, seasons and aeons. He is the divine cal- . culator, arbiter, chief historian and keeper of the divine archives. Herald of the gods, he also served as their clerk and scribe. Dje- hoti is pictured as a human figure with the head of an ibis, wear- ing the kilt, collar and headdress (sometimes with the Lunar disc and crescent) of the Old Kingdom. He holds in his hands the tablet and writing stylus of a scribe. SESHAT: The spouse of Djehoti, goddess of writing, record- keeping and history. Known as \"The Mistress of the house of books\" and \"Mistress of the house of architects,\" she was the foundress of temples, helping to determine the axis of a new sanctuary through the judgment of the stars. Seshat was a stellar divinity who measured time and along with her mate, invented the letters of the alphabet. She is sometimes portrayed as a woman wearing a headdress upon which is a star inscribed within a reversed crescent, surmounted by two long feathers (an ideogram of her name which means \"the secretary.\") She holds the Tablet and stylus of a scribe. HERMES (equivalent to the Roman Mercury): The Greek god who was the mes- senger of Zeus. It is his duty to bring the dictates of the gods to Earth. Primarily a god of travelers, Hermes guided those who were journeying. And because most journeys undertaken were for commercial reasons, Hermes became known as the god of commerce and eloquence. He was also charged with the task of conducting the Souls of the. dead to the underworld. He is often represented as an athletic god, sometimes bearded, who wears a winged helmet and winged sandals. Her- mes holds a winged staff around which are two twining serpents-the Caduceus. IRIS: A Greek divinity who like Hermes was a messenger of the gods, particularly Zeus and Hera, whose orders she delivered to both gods and humans. Iris personified the rainbow, and she was often depicted with golden wings which graced her shoulders. Like Hermes, she occasionally wears winged sandals upon her feet. ATHENE (equivalent to the Roman Minerva): This Greek warrior goddess was formidable in war but benevolent in peace. Her func- tions were many-her skills in battle rivaled those of Ares, but she was also known as a goddess of the arts and of intelligence. Protec- tress of various industries, Athene was the patron of sculptors, architects, spinners and weavers. Her renowned wisdom and valu- able service to humanity earned her the titles of Pronoia, \"the fore- seeing,\" as well as counselor and goddess of the Assembly. She taught the skills of horsemanship, charioteering, pottery, cloth weaving and embroidery. Athene was at times known for her heal- ing arts and for her role as protectress of both individuals and"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 403 entire cities. The goddess is usually depicted dressed in tight drap- ing robes and wearing a helmet. In one hand she holds a spear and in the other a shield. Her symbol is the owl. ASCLEPIUS: A Greek god of light, medicine and healing. He is sometimes represented as a serpent, but more often as a kindly middle-aged man with a staff around which one serpent was twined. (It was probably this staff which was intended to be a modern symbol of medicine, rather than the Caduceus of Her- mes.) His daughter HYGIEIA, was the goddess of health. The cult of Asclepius was both a religion and a system of therapeutics. The priests of this god had a wide knowledge of the medical arts. LUG: The Celtic god who was known as lithe many skilled one.\" When asked to state his craft in order to be admitted to the assem- bly of gods, Lug replied that he was adept in carpentry, warfare, Asclepius smith-eraft, knowledge of history, music, poetry, heroics, magic and other pursuits. Lug was often depicted armed with spear and sling-highly specialized and accurate weapons which delineated the god's adroitness. ODIN (Equivalent to the German Woden): The god who was the supreme divinity of Teutonic mythology as well as the god of war and wisdom. He was a magician-god, the deity of spiritual life, ruling by magic-thus it is only natural that the Romans com- pared him to their Mercury. Odin spoke with eloquence and liked to express himself in verse. He was the god of poetry because he had the cunning and dexterity to steal the \"Poet's mead\" which was of divine origin. He had the power to change himself into any shape he desired, and it was he who ordained the laws which ruled human society. Odin often intermingled in human affairs, Athena assuming the guise of a lowly traveler. He was helpful and benev- olent, offering wise counsel and magic formulas to cure illness. Odin was also the Lord of the Runes-eharacters carved on stones or wood which had magical meanings and power. He is often portrayed as a handsome, robust warrior armed with a shining breastplate, a golden helmet, his spear (which was called Gungnir) which nothing could deflect. His steed Sleipnir, had eight hooves and was the swiftest of all stallions. Complementary Planet: JUPITER In conjunction with the study material given on the Planet Mercury, the student should review information supplied in Chapter One on Jupiter, the planet which complements Mercury on the Macrocosmic Hexagram.

Unfortunately, most of the book, including sections on Hermetic magic, Pythagorean magic and Olympic magic, has been lost. Only the introduction seems to have survived. Part of the Introduction contains a summary of the now lost section on Olympic magic. It is likely that certain books dealing with Olympic magic existed before the Arbatel was written (as indicated by the author himself). The Arbatel has a Christian rather than Judaic emphasis, therefore its author must have been a Christian magician who was schooled in a variety of magical traditions. Whoever he was, he clearly believed that the greatest magical teachings were to be procured through an Angelic teacher sent to the Theurgist from the Divine."},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 405 The Arbatel states that there are seven Olympic Spirits which ru1e over 196 Olympic Provinces or divisions of Heaven; each Spirit governing alternately for 490 years. (490 is the sum of consecutive multiples of seven.) Bethor was supposed to have ruled 60 years before the birth of Christ, until 430 AD when the rule of Phaleg was implemented. This rule ended in 920 AD when the rule of Och began. Haggith began her rule in 1410 and ended it in 1900. (Following the author's rea- soning, Ophiel would be the reigning Olympic Spirit today.) According to the author of the Arbatel, the names and sigils of the Olympic Spirits have no power or virtue in and of themselves, and the only divine names of power to be used are given to the theurgist by these Spirits, but even then, the potency of the names only lasts for 40 years. The Olympic Planetary Spirits are: ARATRON-the Spirit of Saturn. Aratron governs all things ascribed to Saturn. He teaches alchemy, magic and medicine. He is said to have the power to make' one invisible, to convert objects to stone or treasure, and the power to make the barren fruitful. Aratron governs the subterranean Spirits.

For centuries it has been used by magi- cians, occultists, and mystics for the purposes of divination and meditation. Like the Qabalah, the Tarot is a complete and elaborate system for describing the hidden forces behind the manifest uni- verse. Not only is it the key to all occult science, but also a map for uncovering the various parts of the human psyche. Some have called the cards of the Tarot the \"hieroglyphs of the Western Mystery Tradition.\" The origin of the Tarot remains a mystery. Various theories abound, includ- ing the speculations that: (1) the Tarot is of Egyptian origin, (2) that it was created by a group of Adepts to insure the survival of a persecuted esoteric philosophy by concealing it in a deck of playing cards, and (3) that it was invented by the gypsies (Bohemians) to protect its hidden wisdom under the exterior disguise of gambling and fortune telling. However the first known Tarot decks can only be documented with certainty as having been developed in the late fourteenth century during the reign of Charles VI of France. Some of the earliest decks include: the Tarot of [acquemin Gringonneur, the Tarot of the Visconti-Sforza family, and the Tarocchi of Mantegna. During the first part of the fifteenth century, the Tarot was used exclusively at the European courts of nobility-it had become a pastime reserved for the aris- tocracy. The invention of the printing press made the cards more common. In 1781, interest in the Tarot gained momentum when the Court de Gibelin, a freemason and Protestant minister claimed that the Tarot's Trump cards were from a secret Egypt- ian book called The Book of Thoth. Qabalistic Associations of the Tarot However, it was not until 1856 that Eliphas Levi, (whose real name was Alphonse Louis Constant) a noted figure in the Occult Revival of the 19th century, estab- lished an undeniable parallel between the twenty-two Trumps of the Tarot and the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The Occult Revival ushered in serious study of the Tarot and its Qabalistic associations. Whether or not the original inventors of the Tarot deliberately placed Qabalistic symbolism into the cards is unimportant. The fact remains that the two systems of Qabalah and Tarot are so strikingly similar that they easily compliment and describe each other. At the end of the 19th century, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, spearheaded by MacGregor Mathers, formulated some of the most comprehensive teachings of the Qabalistic Tarot ever devised. The traditional Tarot consists of a pack of seventy-eight cards made up of four suits of fourteen cards each, together with twenty-two Trumps, or Major Arcana, which tell the story of the Soul. (The Major Arcana contains twenty-two cards, while the Minor Arcana has a total of fifty-six cards.) The twenty-two Trump cards are each referred to one of the twenty-two paths that connect the Sephiroth on the Tree of Life. They also correspond to the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet."},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"408 SELF-INlTIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON Within the Minor Arcana each Tarot suit consists of ten numbered cards, as in the modem playing cards, but there are four instead of three Royal (Court) cards: King, Queen, Prince and Princess. Thus there are a total of sixteen Court cards. (Note: in some decks these cards are referred to as Knight, Queen, Emperor, and Knave or Page.) The four suits of the Tarot are: 1. WANDS (or scepters) comparable to Clubs. IOS 2. CUPS (or chalices) comparable to Hearts. 3. SWORDS comparable to Spades. 4. PENTACLES (or coins) comparable to Diamonds. In the Tarot, the ten small cards of each suit refer to the ten Sephiroth. The four suits refer to the letters of Tetragrammaton thus: wands to Yod, cups to Heh, swords to Vav, pentacles to Heh (final). The four suits also refer to the Four Worlds of the Qabalah thus: wands to Atziluth, cups to Briah, swords to Yetzirah, pentacles to Assiah. The sixteen court cards (or honors as they are sometimes called) are the Vice- gerants of the Great Name, in the Qabalistic World to which each suit is referred. They allude to the fourfold Tetragrammaton and also symbolize the following: 1. KING-Father, Birth 2. QUEEN-Mother, Life 3. PRINCE-Son, Death 4. PRINCESS-Daughter, Resurrection The Sephiroth, as represented by the Minor Arcana cards which accom- pany them, symbolize objective centers of energy emanating from the Divine. They are static and fixed points of force whose qualities are impartial and immobile. These cards allude to the unchangeable parts of the human psyche-those com- ponents which are inherent to the human mind. The twenty-two paths and their corresponding Trump cards, on the other hand, are active and moving. They are subjective conduits or energy channels that run between the Sephiroth, connecting the spheres. These cards represent our own mutable experiences as we travel the pathways on the Tree of Life, encountering the differences that occur between one Sephirah and the next. The Twenty-two Trumps The twenty-two cards of the Major Arcana are also called the Trumps, Keys or Atus 106 of Tahuti. They are attributed to the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet as well as the twenty-two paths which connect the ten Sephiroth on the Tree of Life. 105 In Regardie's The Golden Dawn, the attributions for wands and pentacles are reversed: wands = dia- monds, pentacles = clubs. However, those attributions have never seemed like the correct ones to us. 106 According to Mathers, the word atu comes from the Egyptian word aat, meaning \"Mansion.\" E.A. Wallis Budge lists the word as aait, meaning \"house,\" \"abode,\" or \"chamber.\""},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 409 They represent the energies of the Planets, the Signs of the Zodiac and the Elements of the ancients. These paths, numbered 11 through 32 are dynamic, subjective con- duits of karmic energy. They symbolize forces in transit and allude to the Powers of consciousness in illustrated form. Their place on the Tree of Life is imaged by the winding path of the Serpent of Wisdom. Unlike the cards of the Minor Arcana, the Trump cards are considered true initiatory forces-having both an esoteric or spiri- tual meaning as well as an exoteric or mundane meaning which is used in divination. Yetziratic Attribution of the Trumps The twenty-two paths (symbolized by the Trumps) and the ten Sephiroth com- bined form the Thirty-two Paths of Wisdom. Since the Tarot Trumps correspond to the Hebrew letters, they can also be grouped in accordance with the three classes of letters described in the Sepher Yetzirah: Elemental-The ThreeMother Letters THE FOOL (Air-Aleph) THE HANGED MAN (Water-Mem) JUDGMENT (Fire-Shin) Planetary-The Seven Double Letters THE MAGICIAN (Mercury-Beth) THE HIGH PRIESTESS (Luna-Gimel) THE EMPRESS (Venus-Daleth) THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE (Jupiter-Kaph) THE TOWER (Mars-Peh) THE SUN (Sol-Resh) THE UNIVERSE (Saturn-Tau) Zodiacal-s-The Twelve Simple Letters THE EMPEROR (Aries-Heh) THE HIEROPHANT (Taurus-Vav) THE LOVERS (Gemini-Zayin) THE CHARIOT (Cancer-Cheth) STRENGTH (Leo- Teth) THE HERMIT (Virgo- Yod) JUSTICE (Libra-Lamed) DEATH (Scorpio-Nun) TEMPERANCE (Sagittarius-Samekh) THE DEVIL (Capricom-Ayin) THE STAR (Aquarius - Tzaddt) THE MOON (Pisces-Qoph) The Yetziratic attributions of the Hebrew alphabet make it possible to sig- nify certain divine names and words by employing their Elemental, Planetary, or Zodiacal symbols.

The King and Queen are the correlations of the Abba and the Aima in that suit; the Knave or Prince answers to Microprosopus, and the Knave or Princess which was anciently a female figure, is referred to the Bride, Kallah or Malkuth. Combining/then, the material attributions of the Sephiroth and the Path, it results that: O. Fool = The Crown of Wisdom, the Primum Mobile, acting through the Air on the Zodiac. 1. The Juggler 108 = The Crown of Understanding, the beginning of material pro- duction, the Primum Mobile acting through the Philosophic Mercury on Saturn. 2.

Hierophant = The Wisdom and fountain of Mercy, the Sphere of the Zodiac acting through Taurus upon Jupiter. 107 This section was written by Frater S.R.M.D. (Mathers) and was originally published in Regardie's The Golden Dawn. 108 Better known as \"The Magician.\""},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 419 6.

The small cards are numbered Aces through tens and are divided into the four suits (wands, cups, swords, and pentacles) which allude to the four Ele- ments, the Tetragrammaton and the Four Worlds of the Qabalah. Every Small card is attributed by its number to one of the Sephiroth. Therefore each Small card repre- sents one of the Ten Sephiroth in one of the Four Qabalistic Worlds. In addition to this, each small card is assigned one of the decanates of the Zodiac (one of the 36 divi- sions of 10 degrees on a Zodiacal chart). 109 This could also be interpreted as \"The Splendor of a firm Foundation.\""},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"The QUEENS The PRINCESSES The Tarot on the Tree of Life 420 The KINGS"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 421 The Suit of Wands The first suit of the Tarot represents the Yod-Force of Tetragrammaton, the Ele- ment of Fire and the Qabalistic World of Atziluth. In general, wands indicate great energy and dynamic power. They also allude to the great masculine power as the first stimulating spark of energy which begins life and sets everything in motion. The Suit of Cups The second suit in the deck symbolizes the Heh-Force of the Four-lettered Name of God, the Element of Water and the Qabalistic World of Briah. Cups refer to the form-building capacity of the great feminine power. The Suit of Swords The third Tarot suit alludes to the Vav-Force of Tetragrammaton, the Element of Air and the Qabalistic World of Yetzirah. Swords indicate intellect, communica- tion, mental faculties and sometimes trouble. This suit is the son, the first offspring of the marriage of the primary Elements represented by the two preceding suits. The Suit of Pentacles The fourth and final suit of the Tarot refers to the Heh-Final Force of the Four-let- tered Name, the Element of Earth and the Qabalistic World of Assiah. For the most part, pentacles or disks suggest material or worldly affairs, business or money. This suit is the daughter of the first two (wands and cups) implying that their combined energies have manifested in this final suit.

If thou thyself hast not a sure foundation, whereon wilt thou stand to direct the forces of Nature? Know then that as Man is born into this world amidst the darkness of Nature and the strife of contending forces, so must his first endeavor be to seek the Light through their reconciliation. Thus, thou who hast trial and trouble of this life, rejoice because of them, for in them is strength, and by their means is a path- way opened unto that Light Divine. How should it be otherwise, 0 man, whose life is but a day in Eternity, a drop in the Ocean of Time? How, if thy trials were not many, couldst thou purge thy soul from the dross of Earth? Is it but now that the higher life is beset with dangers and difficulties; hath it not been ever thus with the Sages and Hierophants of the Past? They have been persecuted and reviled, they have been tormented of men, yet through this has their glory increased. Rejoice, therefore, 0 Initiate, for the greater thy trial, the brighter thy triumph. When men shall revile thee and speak against thee falsely, hath not the Master said \"Blessed art thou.\" Yet, 0 Practicus, let thy victories bring thee not vanity, for with increase of knowledge should come increase of wisdom. He who knows little, thinketh he knows much; but he who knoweth much hath learned his own ignorance. Seest thou a Man wise in his own conceit? There is more hope of a fool than of him. Be not hasty to condemn other's sin. How knowest thou that in their place thou couldst have resisted the temptation? And even were it so, why shouldst thou despise one who is weaker than thyself? Be thou well sure of this, that in slander and self-righteousness is sin. Pardon therefore the sinner, but encourage not the sin. The Master condemned not the adulterous woman, but neither did he encourage her to commit the sin. Thou therefore who desirest magical gifts, be sure that thy soul is firm and steadfast, for it is by flattering thy weakness that the Evil One will gain power over thee. Humble thyself before thy God, yet fear neither man nor spirit. Fear is failure and the forerunner of failure; and courage is the beginning of virtue. There- fore fear not the Spirits, but be firm and courteous with them, for thou hast no right either to despise or to revile them, and this too may lead thee into sin. Com- mand and banish the Evil ones. Curse them by the Great Names of God, if need be; but neither mock nor revile them, for so assuredly thou wilt be led into error. A man is what he maketh himself within the limits fixed by his inherited destiny; he is a part of mankind. His actions affect not himself only, but also those with whom he is brought into contact, either for good or for evil. 110 From Regardie's The Golden Dawn. (Note that Crowley \"borrowed\" heavily from this lecture and renamed it Liber Librae, the Book of Balance,-The Equinox, Vol. 1, No.1)."},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"440 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON Neither worship nor neglect the physical body, which is thy temporary connection with the outer and material world. Therefore let thy mental equilib- rium be above disturbances by material events. Restrain the animal passions and nourish the higher aspirations; the emotions are purified by suffering. Do good unto others for God's sake, not for reward, not for gratitude from them, not for sympathy. If thou art generous, thou wilt not long for thine ears to be tickled by expressions of gratitude. Remember that unbalanced force is evil, that unbalanced severity is but cruelty and oppression, but that also unbalanced Mercy is but weakness which would allow and abet evil. True prayer is as much action as Word; it is Will. The Gods will not do for man what his Higher Powers can do for himself, if he cultivate Will and Wisdom. Remember that this Earth is but an atom in the Universe, and thou thyself but an atom thereon. And that even couldst thou become the God of this Earth whereon thou crawlest and grovellest, thou wouldst even then be but an atom and one among many. Nevertheless, have the greatest self-respect, and to that end sin not against thyself. The sin which is unpardonable is knowingly and willfully to reject spiritual truth, but every sin and act leaveth its effect. To obtain magical Power, learn to control thought. Admit only true ideas which are in harmony with the end desired, and not every stray and contradictory idea that presents itself. Fixed thought is a means to an end; therefore pay atten- tion to the power of silent thought and meditation. The material act is but the out- ward expression of the thought, and therefore it hath been said that \"the thought of foolishness is sin.\" Thought therefore is the commencement of action, and if a chance thought can produce much effect, what cannot fixed thought do? There- fore, as has been already said, establish thyself firmly in the Equilibrium of Forces, in the center of the cross of the elements, that Cross from whose center the creative word issued in the birth of the dawning universe. As it was said unto thee in the grade of Theoricus: \"Be thou therefore prompt and active as the Sylphs, but avoid frivolity and caprice. Be energetic and strong like the Salamanders, but avoid irritability and ferocity. Be flexible and attentive to images like the Undines, but avoid idleness and changeability. Be laborious and patient like the Gnomes, but avoid grossness and avarice.\" So shalt thou gradually develop the powers of thy Soul and fit thyself to command the spirits of the elements. For wert thou to summon the Gnomes to pander to thy avarice, thou wouldst no longer command them, but they would command thee. Wouldst thou abuse the pure creatures of God's creation to fill thy coffers and to satisfy thy lust for Gold? Wouldst thou defile the Spirits of driving Fire to serve thy wrath and hatred? Wouldst thou violate the purity of the Souls of the Water to pander to thy lust and debauchery? Wouldst thou force the Spirits of the evening breeze to min- ister to thy folly and caprice? Know that with such desires thou canst but attract the evil and not the good, and in that can the evil will have power over thee."},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 441 In true religion there is no sect.

Let him now learn to control his emotions, on no account giving way to anger, hatred and jealousy, but to turn the force he hitherto expended in these directions towards the attainment of perfection, that the malarial marsh of his nature may become a clear and limpid lake, reflecting the Divine Nature truly and without distortion. Let him identify himself with the Powers of Water, considering the Water Triplic- ity in all its aspects, with its attributions and correspondences.e CONCENTRATION AND MANTRA The exercises of relaxation, rhythmic breathing and mind awareness given in the previous grades should have by this time instilled within the student a high degree of sensitivity, peace and awareness. The next step is to introduce the fac- ulty of concentration. The Sephirah of Hod is the sphere of the intellectual mind-the part of the human psyche which consciously observes, examines and reflects on images and ideas. The mind must be trained to open up and receive an influx of Divine Spirit. And the only way to train the mind to concentrate is through practice. There are two important side-effects which arise from developing the fac- ulty of concentration. These include (1) the development of the Will and (2) the development of the imagination, both of which will prove to be essential in the aspirant's spiritual growth. The first step in this training is to set up more frequent and shorter periods of time each day for the exercise. Though at first it may seem to the student that s/he is not progressing during these first periods of concentration training, dis- couragement must not be allowed to lead one into failure. What we are teaching here is a discipline, and the student should not expect immediate results. Also, the mind must never be forced into compliance by trying to block out thoughts, which is of course impossible. Patience is a prerequisite. 111 From Regardie's The Golden Dawn."},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 443 The exercises already undertaken by the student of this course will have given the student the opportunity to observe the physical sensations followed by the wanderings of the mind, neither of which can be ignored or subdued. Efforts to fight them will only give them power. However, the mere observation of them will gradually lessen their strength and occurrence. Once this happens the concen- tration training can begin. The next step is to break out of old habits and construct new habits or behav- ior patterns which will better aid the process of concentration. Choose a specific time of day for the exercise and make it a daily routine. Eventually this habit of con- centration practice will become second-nature to you, much like the time of day that you wake up every morning. Candles, incense, and ritual oils will help the student create the proper spiri- tual awareness for the exercise, although they should never be thought of as crucial to one's practice. The only essential element in this exercise is the Mantra which is a mechanical aid to the practice of concentration. A mantra is a word or phrase (usually devotional) which is repeated over and over, audibly or astrally, until the mantra itself remains the only thing that the mind is aware of. A mantra can be a sound or a word which is connected with a spiritual force or concept, intended to bring about changes in one's inner and outer realities. By constant repetition, the astral body of the practitioner attunes itself to the energy which is inherent within the mantra. Mantras which are most suitable for the student of this course include those that are derived from the Golden Dawn tradition. Five such mantras are: Khabs Am Pekht Konx Om Pax Yod Heh Vav Heh Adonai Kether Malkuth Ve-Geburah Ve-Gedulah Eheieh Agla The mantra is to be memorized and recited mentally in time with the breathing. The first line of the mantra is repeated with the inhalation, and the sec- ond line is recited on the exhalation. With a little time this practice becomes sim- ple and automatic. When this occurs the aspirant can contemplate the meaning of the phrase, and what it invokes within. Emotional force can be applied to the mantra, directing the mind toward the support of the mantra until the focus of"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"444 SELF-INTI1ATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN 'fRADmoN concentration is an undeniable fact. The mechanical repetition of the words even- tually subdues the wayward mind, inducing a deep state of contemplation. In due time this faculty of concentration can be summoned and dismissed at Will. This exercise is to be maintained throughout the entire length of time that the student is in the grade of Practicus. If more time is needed to master the method and attain a state of true concentration, then by all means take more time to practice it.* PSYCHIC DEVELOPMENT Exercise 1 This exercise is designed to develop the student's sensitivity.

Shuffle them again and place the deck on the table before you, face down. Place your hand upon the top card and spend a few moments trying to visualize what Tarot suit (or Trump card) it is. Let your intuitive powers have total rein and do not be the least concerned if you find that you have guessed wrong. Go on to the next card. Practice often and keep a written record of your progress, (what your guess was, and what the actual card was). With time and practice your degree of accuracy will improve. For the first two months, concentrate only on try- ing to determine the suit of the cards. Exercise 2 Repeat the method stated above, but this time instead of trying to determine the card suit, try to visualize what number (or Sephirah) is associated with each card of the Minor Arcana. Practice this for the next two months. Exercise 3 Repeat the previous technique, but now try to determine both the suit and number of the card. (Keep in mind that the two positive masculine suits are compatible with each other, as are the two negative feminine suits, therefore their energies will feel similar.) Practice this exercise for the remaining time in the grade, and as always, record your findings.c The 31st Path of Shin The Sepher Yetzirah calls the 31st Path (from Malkuth to Hod) the Perpetual Intelli- gence, because it regulates the motions of the Sun and Moon in their proper order, each in an orbit convenient for it. For the initiate traveling this path, the key word is"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 445 \"perpetual.\" This is the persistent regulation of the progress of the initiate's Person- ality toward the cosmic consciousness. The Angelic powers, called forth by the stu- dent journeying upon the Tree, determine what aspects of the initiate are unsuitable for his/her spiritual growth. These undesirable qualities are slowly burned away by the purging Fire of Shin. This permits the \"Sun and Moon\" of the initiate (i.e., the positive and negative sides of the student) to work \"each in their proper order.\" The 20th Key of the Tarot Judgment, is attributed to this path. The Magical Title of this card is \"The Spirit of the Primal Fire.\" The path of Judgment connects Hod to Malkuth, and it is known as \"The Splendor of the Material World. Mercury acting through Fire upon the Cosmic Elements.\" In other words this path serves to awaken the Intellectual center (Mercury) in the psyche (Cosmic elements) of the ini- tiate using fiery Yod energy. This is the first path undertaken by the aspiring student which is off the Middle Pillar and the relative \"safety\" of the center Column of the Tree. It can be quite a jolt to the initiate as s/he journeys along this path, which can be best described as a Baptism into the Primal Element of Fire. The 31st Path is also the path which best represents the act of Initiation. On this path the initiate first becomes aware of the divine forces which guide and implant much-needed spiri- tual energy into the Lower Personality. Shin, the Hebrew letter associated with this path means \"tooth,\" suggesting the breaking down and ingesting of food (energy). Shin is not only attributed to the Element of Fire, but also to the Fifth Ele- ment of Spirit. Thus the experience of traversing the 31st Path is that of the divine spiritual energy plunging into physical matter. This spiritual force descends from Hod (by way of Binah and the Black Pillar) and infuses the aspirant with the Fiery Shin energy. The ingesting of this spiritual \"food\" awakens the initiate for the first time to the Divine Presence working internally. The \"Judgment\" indicated on this path, is that which is undertaken by the Personality of the initiate as s/he becomes more aware of a Greater Reality, which serves to equilibrate his/her own imbal- ances. The Shin of Judgment is a consecrating and purifying Fire which perpetu- ally burns away the gross, leaving only the balanced and the pure. Symbols included within the Tarot card of Judgment are: the Archangel Michael descending, the candidate rising from the tomb, and the two figures of Samael and Anael (all personifications of Fire and Heat), the Hebrew letter Shin, the rainbow of Promise, the fiery serpents (Seraphim) and the triangle of flame. The figure in the foreground is Kasmillos, a representation of the initiate of the mysteries, standing in the Theoricus Sign, indicating that he has received the redeeming Fire of Shin from the actions of the other figures (the three Kabiri) who have tested and tried him in order to bum away all his impurities. He now stands in the Sign of Air as the Reconciler while the other three figures herald his tri- umphant rebirth. He welcomes an influx of Spirit descending through the ether into his physical form.e"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"446 SELF-INTIlATION INTO 1HE GoLDEN DAWN 1'RAomoN A JOURNEY ON THE 31ST PATH OF SHIN112 For this ritual the Practicus will need the robe, nemyss, red sandals, the Tetrahedron, and the Outer Wand of Double Power. The temple is to be arranged as in the Open- ing of the 3 = 8 grade. Upon the altar should be the Tarot Trump of Judgment. Acorn- fortable place to sit and meditate should be arranged West of the pillars. After a period of relaxation has passed, go to the Northeast and say, \"HEKAS, HEKAS, ESTE BEBELOI! Far from this sacred place bethe profane!\" Go to the East. With the black end of the wand, perform the Lesser Banishing Rit- ual of the Pentagram. Go the West of the altar. With the white end of the Wand of Double Power, trace a large letter Shin over the Tarot card. Visualize it in Red. Intone the name of the let- ter thrice. Give the Neophyte Signs toward the card. Put the wand aside, and take the Tetrahedron in your right hand. With all your powers of concentration, look upon the card and comprehend it- consider all its meaning and symbolism. Give the Sign of the Practicus. At this point you may sit comfortably if you wish, but maintain a disassociation from the surrounding room. Behind the darkness of your closed eyelids, you begin to for- mulate the astral temple of the Sephirah Malkuth, as the journey begins: Astrally, you give the Sign of the Zelator. Once again the ten-sided temple of Malkuth formulates around you with its black-and-white tiled floor and rough- hewn oak walls. The sacred flame bums brightly upon the central altar. The bra- zier of incense, fireplace, fountain, and mill stones are familiar sights to you now. You intone the divine name of this temple, Adonai ha-Aretz, and call upon its archangel Sandalphon, and the choir of Angels the Ashim. Finally you vibrate the name of the temple, Malkuth. From the clouds of incense in the East, Sandalphon appears. You salute her with the Sign of the Enterer, and she answers with the Sign of Silence. She speaks: \"You have entered the Kingdom of Malkah, the Queen. What symbol do you bring to define what you seek?\" You hold out the Pyramid of Flame. Sandalphon leads you to a door in the Northeast part of the temple. Before the door is a veil made from the tarot trump of Judgment. The archangel traces a Fire triangle and the veil parts and vanishes. The door leading to the 31st Path is carved from pure fire opal and painted upon it is the Hebrew letter, Shin. Giving the Sign of Practicus, you then hold out the Solid Triangle and trace with it the let- ter, Shin. The door opens outward. 112 From our book, Secrets ofa Golden Dawn Temple."},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 447 You and your guide step out onto the craggy side of a cliff. You can just make out the mountain tops which seem to rise above a valley below, whose sub- tleties are hidden to your view. Sandalphon leads you on a narrow descending path which seems more suited to the hooves of a mountain goat than to your feet. By the time you reach the valley floor, it is mid-afternoon. The climate is moderate, but chill. Ahead, you hear a commotion-the sounds of people shout- ing and the bellowing of some great beast. This distraction causes you to step on a stinging nettle, but you ignore the pain. Sandalphon gestures for you to continue on the path without her. Just over a hill, you discover the source of the disturbance. A primitive looking group of men have cornered a mammoth and driven it over the edge of a small ravine. The huge animal was carefully trapped by the hunters who used torches and dugout pits of fire to maneuver the beast in the direction they wanted it to go-toward the ravine. Now, with the huge animal trapped, they kill it with heavy spears and rocks. When the mammoth is dead, the hunters give great shouts of joy which bring even more people onto the scene of the drama. A woman and small boy who have come to help cut up the meat with stone knives notice you standing there. Puzzled, they approach. When they see the Pyramid of flame in your hand, they smile and point to markings tattooed on the palms of their hands, which is that of a red triangle. This is the mark of the Tribe. They are the Clan of Fire. With great efficiency, the animal is skinned, butchered and hauled away to a nearby village. You follow, and appear to be accepted by these people and their strange and primitive ways. The main shelter of the encampment is an enormous cave, but a few simple lodges, made from Mammoth bone and hide stand just a short distance from the cave entrance. From one of these shelters, a wise old med- icine woman brings a bag of ointments and herbs to tend the wounds of some of the hunters. The entire village, women and children, young and old, help with the storing of meat and the curing of strips of hide. Chunks of meat are skewered to cook over several small fires around the camp. Everyone is hungry from all the work. Food including meat, flat bread, fruit and a spicy drink is passed around to all, including you. In the center of the village, and in front of the cavern entrance, burns a great bonfire. After they have eaten, the hunters are led in a ceremony by an old shaman dressed in mammoth wool and a helmet carved from bone. They perform a sacred dance reenacting the hunt to thank the Spirit of the mammoth for giving its life to feed the Clan. The celebration continues well into the evening. There is laughter around the Fire, as well as talk of brave deeds, Spirits, and gos- sip. The Fire is the life of the village-it brings food, warmth, security, and protec- tion to the tribe. It also brings them together as a human community, setting them apart from the animals in the valley. Finally the festivity winds down and you feel the urge to press on with your journey. As you bid goodbye, some of the clan members give. you small sacred objects: a lion carved from stone, a spearhead, and the tooth of a bear. You thank them and continue on the 31st Path."},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"448 SELF-INITlATION INlO 1HE GoWEN DAWN 'fRADmoN The setting sun is hanging low in the sky behind you as you continue Northeast of the valley. The land opens out into a wide sandy plateau with stunted trees and desert scrub. Off in the distance, you see the outline of a great pyramid against the evening sky. Two smaller pyramids loom on either side of the main one. Wanting to reach the structure before dark, you quicken your pace. As you approach the great pyramid, its beauty becomes evident. Constructed from enormous red stones, many hieroglyphs and relief sculptures are carved into its surface. At the main entrance into the pyramid are two enormous goddesses enthroned before a pair of columns whose capitals end in carved lotus flowers. Both goddesses are lion-headed and each bears a lotus staff in one hand and an ankh in the other. The goddess on the left wears a green tunic, while her twin is dressed in red. An uraeus sits atop the nemysses of both, surmounted by the Solar disc. As you draw near, the figures stand and bar your path with their staffs. They speak: \"Thou canst not enter the Pyramid of Flame unless thou canst tell us our names.\" \"Thou art the sister goddesses of the West and East.\" You direct your answer to the figure in red. \"Thou art Sekhet, lady of flame, beloved of Ptah. Thou art the fierce and scorching aspect of Fire, destroyer of the enemies of Ra, who con- sumes the wicked and the unbalanced.\" You tum toward the form in green. \"Thou art the goddess Bast, the eye of Ra, whose name means \"Fire.\" Thou art the power of the heat of the Sun as it warms the Earth and causes the growth of plants and the bearing of seeds.\" \"In what signs and symbols do ye come?\" they whisper. Standing in the Sign of the Practicus you state, \"In the divine name of Elohim Tzabaoth, in the name Eloah, and in this symbol of Pyramid of Flame.\" The figures step back. The goddess Bast traces the sigil of Leo before you with her lotus staff. \"In the Sign of the Lion,\" she says, \"Thou art purified.\" The goddess Sekhet traces the letter Shin before you. \"In the letter of Initi- ation and of Judgment, Thou art consecrated. Pass Thou on.\" Entering the pyramid, you give the Neophyte Signs. You step into a great hall with a black and white tiled floor. Two great pillars, one black and one white, resembling the feet of two goddesses dominate the hall. You recognize this cham- ber as the Hall of Dual Manifestation, the place of the Weighing of the Soul. You had to pass through its physical representation on Earth when you were initiated as a Neophyte. Here you see it in its astral and original form. The scales of the god- dess Maat are at the center of the temple-their balance is tested and watched over by the jackal-headed Anubis. Thoth, the ibis-headed god of wisdom acts as a scribe, ready with stylus and day tablet to record the judgment. A fierce-looking beast crouches menacingly behind Thoth-part hippopotamus, part leopard, and part crocodile. Forty-two lesser gods sit in silence on all sides of the room. A goddess with a sistrum acts as your guide-the gentle sound of her implement is soothing. With the strength of conviction, you step forward and face the assembly of gods. You place the Tetrahedron upon the scales as a symbol of your heart and your deepest spiritual aspirations. The goddess Maat, governess of truth, places her feather in the scale also, weighing it against the purity of your heart. Anubis questions you with the determination of a prosecuting attorney. He"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 449 asks you to describe all the symbols in the hall in detail. Luckily you are familiar with these symbols from your studies, and you satisfactorily answer all question. The forty-two lesser gods each question you in tum: \"Hast thou given due thought to the body inhabited by thee?\" \"Hast thou spoken unjustly in anger?\" \"Hast thou been undiligent in work?\" \"Hast Thou lived in the Light?\" \"Hast Thou faced the mirror of Self?\" Their questions are hard, but you answer all of them truthfully to the best of your ability. At the end of their questioning, you are tired, but relieved, as if the negative confession had unburdened your Soul. Thoth beckons you forward and asks one final question. \"Who is He whose Pylons are of flame, whose walls of Living Uraei, and the flames of whose house are streams of Water?\" \"Osiris!\" you reply. The god records your answer approvingly. \"Pass on, thou knowest it,\" is his answer. The Hawk-headed god Horus, who has witnessed all of the proceed- ings, takes your hand in his and leads you past the Devouring Beast, to a shrine in the Eastern part of the hall. He instructs you to kneel before an altar in front of the shrine. There upon the Dais the god Osiris sits enthroned. He wears the tall white crown of the South flanked by two plumes. From his chin hangs the royal beard of authority and judgment, and he holds the Scourge of Severity, the Crook of Mercy and the Phoenix Wand. The Children of Horus are at his feet and the goddesses of the two pillars, Isis and Nephthys stand behind him. Upon the altar before the god, you place the bear's tooth and the spearhead from the dan as an offering to the god of Judgment. He reaches out and touches the crown of your head with the Phoenix Wand. The god speaks: \"Thy meat shall be from the Infinite, and Thy drink from the Infinite. Thou art able to go forth to the ini- tiatory feasts on Earth, for thou hast overcome.\" A lion-headed goddess, Tharpesh, bids you to rise and follow her. She leads you to a chamber where a statue of Ptah, the creator god stands with an iron knife in one hand and a hammer in the other. Ptah, the greatest of the old gods is known as the architect of the universe, and the patron of craftsmen, metalsmiths, and workmen. Next to the statue is a triangular portal whose edges are ringed with flames. The goddess gestures for you to enter the portal. Giving the Sign of the Practicus, you do so. The heat of the flames is all around you. You no longer seem to be walking forward. Instead you are rising upward, like smoke. Sweating from the hot blast of Air. Your black robe is incinerated, but you feel no pain as this baptism of Fire continues. There is no fear, only the desire to rise like a phoenix into a new state of being through the initiating power of Fire. The sounds of a trumpet are heard somewhere above you. Suddenly the roaring flames propel you upward through a square opening in the rocks above. There is no time to react. Naked, you rise to find yourself standing leg-high in a black stone tomb which juts out of the bare Earth. Before you is a cool, placid lake covered by a layer of mist and steam. Above the mist is a"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"450 SELF-INITIATION INTO 1HE GoLDEN DAWN 'fRADmoN truly glorious vision. The Archangel of Fire, Michael surrounded by a fireball of red, orange, and green flames. His wings are sheer and translucent, formed from white-hot vapors at the center of the flame. Threads of Fire weave up and down his bare skin, disturbing not a single hair. The golden disc of Sol sits atop his dark- haired crown, and he blows a long summoning note upon a trumpet from which hangs a banner of white with a central red cross. Behind the figure is a rainbow formed from living creatures. The Seraphim, fiery serpents coruscate in a blazing stream within the bow of promise. The entire horizon beyond this vision is ignited with burning Yods. At the point where the flames meet the Waters of the lake, great clouds of steam are formed. As if this sight were not enough, you notice a movement to your left. A swarthy masculine figure rises from the dark Earth in a halo of Fire. This is Samael-ruler of volcanic Fire--erupting from the belly of the Earth. To your right, a female form breaks forth from the Waters. She is Anael, ruler of the astral Light. Her etheric twin rises at her side. You realize that you are in the presence of the three living powers of Fire: Solar, Volcanic and Astral-the three tongues of flame. Within you is the Hidden Fire, waiting to be ignited by a spark. Instinc- tively, you raise your arms in the Sign of Theoricus and the Element of the Redeemer. As you do so, three fiery Yods from the crown of Michael come together, forming a flaming letter Shin, which drifts downwards. It is absorbed into your heart center. Another letter Shin is formed which hovers over the top of your head where it turns brilliant white. A feeling of calm elation overtakes you. You truly feel that you have become a part of something which is greater than yourself. From this day forward, you will strive to become more than human, and rise from the ashes of your old self. An Adoration escapes from your lips, \"There is no part of me that is not of the gods!\" After a moment of contemplation, you silently thank the beings of flame. Turning you step out of the tomb and are surprised to see the smiling face of San- dalphon. She carries a velvet black robe to replace the one that you sacrificed on the Path of Fire. With tenderness, she helps you into it. The journey back is swift. It is now morning, and the dawning sun forms a magnificent backdrop for the three pyramids in the desert. In the valley at the mountain foothills, the Clan of Fire is just starting to stir. Smoke drifts upward from many cooking pits. The treacherous path leading up the side of the cliff is the same, but your adventure has left you as nimble as an Alpine sheep. With no exertion, you are soon at the opal door at the temple of Malkuth. Once inside, Sandalphon seals the portal. Standing at the altar flame, you feel totally rejuvenated. In fact you feel so strengthened that you are quite willing to rush headlong on to the 30th Path. San- dalphon persuades you otherwise. Bidding her farewell, you salute with the Neo- phyte Sign.

It is therefore the reflection of the sphere of the Sun and the path connecting Yesod with Hod, Foundation with Splendor. This path, which connects the sphere of Yesod to that of Hod, is described as the \"Collecting Intelligence\" because it governs many integral factors in the makeup of the individual Personality-specifically, the Signs of the Zodiac, which are vessels of Planetary influence. A person's Sun Sign is central to both his/her present and past incarnations. The 30th Path signifies a collecting of knowledge on every level. On this path, the \"collected\" parts of the student's Personality are given an infusion of the Sun's intellectual qualities of warmth and Light. Here the student also begins to perceive the Higher forces which have formed his/her own personality. The 30th Path connects Yesod, the astral foundation behind all material- ized forms, to Hod, the seat of the Intellect. It is also the first path of the astral tri- angle (the Personality) that the aspirant confronts when scaling the Tree. This path is the conductor of the thought process or intellectual energy. Resh, the Hebrew letter assigned to this card means \"head\" which further reveals its function as the \"Collecting Intelligence,\" collecting and assembling information and experiences which the Personality can use in its quest for Higher Knowledge. On this path, the initiate attempts to reconcile his spiritual mind with his/her raw animal instincts. It is thus the first path of many which deals with equilibration-the weighing and balancing of the \"collected\" information. The 19th Key of The Sun is attributed to this path. The Magical TItle of this card is \"The Lord of the Fire of the World.\" Images and symbols associated with this card include: a large Sun, two children playing in the Water and on the Earth, a stone fence, and two groups of seven Hebrew Yods. The Sun is the center of our world and the giver of light and warmth to the planet. Yet too much sun (like too much intellect without emotion) is harmful and can scorch the Earth, creating deserts. This points to the importance of balance on this path. The Sun seen in the 19th Key has a head and face (Resh) but with no mouth, signifying that humanity, for all its intellectual achievements, cannot communicate with the Divine Being through human speech. Language is far too inadequate to"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"452 SELF-INITIATION INTO 1HE GoLDEN DAWN 'TRAomoN even describe a true spiritual experience. When communicating with the Higher Mind, no words are needed-they are in fact obsolete under such circumstances. The wall of stones which surrounds the two children is the circle of the Zodiac. It is wall of knowledge which acts as a boundary, keeping the children within the garden because they know not how to unlock its secrets. Once they learn this knowledge, they are free to climb over the wall. This knowledge used wisely can enable the children to leap effortlessly over the wall. Used unwisely, the stones of the wall can come crashing down on their heads.e A JOURNEY ON THE 30TH PATH OF RESH113 For this ritual the Practicus will need the robe, nemyss, red sandals, the Greek Cross and the Outer Wand of Double Power. The temple is to be arranged as in the Second Part of the 3 = 8 grade. Upon the altar should be the Tarot Trump of The Sun. A com- fortable place to sit and meditate should be arranged West of the pillars. After a period of relaxation has passed, go to the Northeast and say, \"HEKAS, HEKAS, ESTE BEBELOI! Far from this sacred place be the profane!\" Go to the East. With the black end of the wand, perform the Lesser Banishing Rit- ual of the Pentagram. Go the West of the altar. With the white end of the Wand of Double Power, trace a large letter Resh over the Tarot card. Visualize it in orange. Intone the name of the letter thrice. Give the Neophyte Signs toward the card. Put the wand aside, and take the Greek Cross in your right hand. With all your powers of concentration, look upon the card and comprehend it, consider all its meaning and symbolism. Give the Sign of the Practicus. At this point you may sit comfortably if you wish, but maintain a disassociation from the surrounding room. Behind the darkness of your closed eyelids, you begin to for- mulate the astral temple of the Sephirah Malkuth, as the journey begins: Astrally, you give the Sign of the Zelator. The now familiar temple of Malkuth formulates around you. The central flame burns brightly with a renewed passion upon the central altar. As before you intone the names which call forth the inhabitants of this tem- ple, Adonai ha-Aretz, Sandalphon, Ashim, and finally, Malkuth. Sandalphon appears as 113 From our book, Secrets of a Golden Dawn Temple."},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 453 in your previous journeys and you exchange the usual Signs. This time you hold up the Solar Cross for the Archangel to see. She takes you swiftly through the portal of Tau directly in the East of the temple. Within a short time you are at the entrance to the temple of Yesod. You enter without Sandalphon, giving the Neophyte Signs. Nine walls form the inner chamber which is a rich violet color. The figure of an enneangle or nine-sided polygon graces the floor. In each of the nine comers of the room, a brazier of incense hangs, scenting the room with the smell of jas- mine. Around the ceiling are depicted the various phases of the moon inlaid with quartz and ebony. The central altar is surrounded by four large statues, each with four faces: that of a man, a lion, and eagle, and a bull. The altar itself is cast in sil- ver and covered with a velvet indigo cloth. The temple flame burns from a silver bowl supported by three crescents. The feel of this temple is quite different from that of Malkuth. No sensa- tions of security or solidity are evoked here. There is an ethereal quality to every- thing here. You almost feel as if your hand would pass right through the kerubic statues if you tried to touch them. There is also a sense of excitement akin to sex- ual awareness. This temple is the dwelling place of the serpent power or kun- dalini. You can: feel its power tingling certain nerves along your spine-stirred slightly by your entrance into Yesod. With a sense of exhilaration, you vibrate the divine name of this sphere, Shaddai El Chai. You then call upon the Archangel Gabriel for guidance, and the order of Angels known as the Kerubim. Finally, you intone the name of the temple itself, Yesod. From the jasmine mists, the Archangel starts to formulate. Taking on a material form before you, Gabriel is dressed in robes of violet trimmed with yel- low. His features are breathtaking-a fine oval-shaped face framed by shoulder- length dark brown hair. His green eyes are large and sensual. The wings from his shoulders are very large and white. Somehow, you get the feeling that Gabriel could have just as easily appeared as a beautiful young girl-so slight and delicate is his appearance. He speaks: \"Behold around you, the Vision of the Machinery of the Universe. You have entered the Treasure House of Images and the sphere of Maya, lllusion. By what Sign hast thou entered into the Mirror of the Cosmos?\" You answer by giving the Sign of the Theoricus. \"Why have you come to the house of the Almighty Living One?\" he inquires. You hold up the Greek Solar Cross. Satisfied, Gabriel takes you to the central altar where he anoints you with a perfumed oil and gestures to a pair of violet leather sandals on the floor in front of the altar. He instructs you to wear these sandals on every path leading from the sphere of Yesod-that you may always tread upon a firm foundation in your jour- neys. The Archangel then takes you to a curtain in the Northeast upon which is depicted the Tarot card of The Sun. He traces the sigil of Sol and the veil parts, revealing a door carved from crysoleth. Upon the door is the Hebrew letter Resh in orange. Stepping forward, you hold up the Solar Cross and trace with it the let- ter Resh. The door opens and you and your guide start out on the 30th Path."},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"454 SELF-INTIlATION INTO lHE GoLDEN DAWN 1'RAomoN It is noon and the sun is at its zenith overhead. The ground you are walk- ing along is rich and fertile-black soil that is perfect for most vegetation. Heliotrope and sunflowers abound. Groves of laurel trees cover the low rolling hills. A cool stream, full of fish meanders its way along the path. Butterflies chase each other from flower to flower, causing you to wonder if any place on Earth could be more perfect than this. Gabriel sets a steady pace that covers much ground. Eventually, you come upon a clearing where a drama is about to take place. The Sun god, Ra is sitting upon the ground clutching the bleeding heel of his foot. A deadly viper, caught in the act, slithers away from the scene of the crime. The god is enraged with pain- his bellowing frightens all creatures within earshot. As the venom starts to work, the color drains from the deity's face and limbs. The Solar disc on his headdress dims. Crying out against his impending death, Ra calls for Isis to heal his wound. The great goddess appears quickly, for it was she who created the poiso- nous serpent-fashioning the creature from dust and Ra's own spittle. Isis is com- passionate but firm. She will not heal Ra until he reveals unto her his most hidden name. The god is reluctant to do so, for it would mean that Isis would have power over him. Ra is proud and stubborn. At last when the fingers of death begin to steal the life away from him, he whispers his secret name to her. Great Isis, skilled in the arts of magick, then utters the Words of Power taught to her by Thoth. As soon as the words are spoken, the poison is driven out of the body of Ra, and the color of life returns to him. With the help of the ibis-headed one, Isis now possesses the words of power as well as the knowledge of how to pro- nounce and vibrate them. In this skirmish, the great Sun god has been outwitted by the lady of the moon through intellect. Gabriel gestures that it is time to move on. You continue on the Path of Resh until at length you come to a great city of shining stone buildings at the edge of the sea. On a 400 foot cliff overlooking the ocean is one of the Seven Wonders of the World, the great stone Pharos, the 100 foot tall lighthouse which guides ships into the port of Alexandria, the great cosmopolitan city which is the apex of knowledge and education in the ancient world. The city was built according to a strict geometric design, with public build- ings of marble, a huge gymnasium, and even an artificial hill dedicated to the god Pan. Walking along the city's main street which is over 3 miles long and 100 feet wide, you are impressed by the people and their culture, which is neither Greek nor Egyptian, but contains the best of both. At the center of the city is a plaza dom- inated by two adjoining buildings-great columned structures set high atop mar- ble steps. You and your guide enter the first building, the museum of Alexandria founded by Ptolemy. It is the first university and scientific institute in history. There are many chambers to explore. In one room, the dissection of bodies provides anatomic studies for a group learning the art of medicine. Other rooms are set aside for zoological and botanical collections. You pass by one chamber where the Hellenistic mathematician Euclid is teaching his axioms of geometry to a number of students. In another room.fhe astronomer Aristarchus is espousing"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"The Practicus Grade 455 the conclusion that the sun, not the Earth is the center of our universe. There are many studio chambers for artists, scientists and craftsmen. Gabriel then leads you to the huge library where uncounted numbers of scrolls and tablets of clay, stone, and even wax tablets of writing are carefully stored and studied by historians, poets, astronomers and scholars from all over the ancient world. It was here that writing was for the first time divided into \"books,\" these being determined by the length of the papyrus. A bronze statue of Hermes stands at the center of the great hall. The ceiling is covered by a circular fresco depicting a reproduction of the famous Zodiac of Dendera. There are many tables where the intellectuals of Alexandria are busy copying manuscripts of Greek literature. One of the books you see lying upon a table is Ptolemy's Syntaxis, an ancient book of maps which carefully explains the motions of the Sun, Moon and Planets, giving a celestial latitude and longitude for each of them. The Emerald Tablet, and the Divine Pymander as well as the forty other works of Hermes Tris- megistus can be found here. Your guide leads you through a maze of books to a chamber deep within the library walls. At this point Gabriel tells you to continue on without him. The door into the chamber is guarded by a seated figure completely shrouded from head to foot in an unimpressive looking old cloak. A grizzled hand poking out of the robe grasps a staff adorned with the carved serpents. Another hand is raised to stop you from entering. \"In what Signs and symbols do you come?\" the form croaks. You answer by giving the Sign of the Practicus. \"In the divine name of Elohim Tzabaoth, in the word Eloah and in this symbol of the Solar Greek Cross which refers to the sun in the twelve Signs of the Zodiac.\" \"Thou canst not enter the temple of the Logos unless thou canst tell me my name.\" the form replies. \"Thou art Tahuti, Lord of divine words. Thoth, the self-created counter of the stars and measurer of Earth art Thou. Hermes, the Thrice Great-god of writ- ing, science and magic. \" The cloak and the illusion of age is suddenly cast aside to reveal the god of knowledge in his Greek persona with winged helmet and sandals. His skin is bronze and his youthful eyes sparkle with mischief. He seems delighted at the quickness of your reply, but his only response is to give the Sign of Silence as he opens the door for you. You step out into the bright sunlight. Before you is a hill with a stone wall at its summit. The mound is divided into two halves, one side of Earth, and one of Water-the two receptive elements. The stones which comprise the wall are carved with various Zodiacal and Astro- logical sigils. A pair of children are playing joyfully on the knoll. The young boy tumbles in the grass while the girl splashes him with Water. In the sky above them is the sun, a huge and brilliant orange disc. It is surrounded by 12 rays, half of which are waved and feminine and half of which are salient and masculine. Seven Hebrew Yods falling from either side of the disc contain within them the sigils of the Planets of the ancients. In the center of the sun are the suggestions of a face, but without a mouth. The head of this Solar being stirs feelings of awareness and recognition within you. You know that the countenance before you is the emissary"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"456 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON of a Higher Mind, greater than anything you have yet encountered. Longing for an opportunity to have conversation with this higher consciousness, you give the Sign of the Practicus, the receptive cup. A white Yod begins to formulate where the Solar mouth would be. It floats down toward you and is absorbed into the crown of your head. The first link of inner communication is established between you and the divine teacher. It is a warm and loving feeling of spirituality that you simply cannot describe. No words can do it justice. No human can adequately recount it to another. No tongue can own it. You salute with the Sign of Silence and a gesture of thanks. Before leaving this idyllic scene, you stop to playa momentary game of tag with the children, who both run laughing into the Water, splashing at you. In turning, you see Gabriel, amused by your behavior. It is time to be heading back. The mid-afternoon sun is hot during the trek back, and you are thankful that Gabriel came to get you when he did, before you ended up with a nasty burn. Some animal bones bleached white by the side of the road testify to the potential destructiveness of the Solar energy if not balanced by cool weather and rainfall. Soon you are at the temple of Yesod where you return the violet sandals to the foot of the altar. The cool air of the chamber is refreshing after such a hot jour- ney. The Archangel then guides you back to the temple of Malkuth. Sandalphon closes the portal behind you. She goes to the fountain in the West and returns with a wooden chalice of Water for you to drink from. Finally, bidding her farewell, you salute with the Neophyte Sign. She in tum gives the Sign of Silence. At this point bring your astral body back to the physical temple around you. Do not hurry. Perform the LBRP with the black end of the wand. Say, \"I now declare the temple duly closed. \"l) AN INVOCATION OF THE ELEMENT OF WATER For the grade of Practicus For this ritual the Practicus will need a black Outer Order robe, black and white striped nemyss, and the Outer Wand of Double Power.

Once again the initiate delib- erately veers off the security of the middle course, this time on the side ~Ij~ of the white pillar. This action is necessary to balance out the previous initiation which took the aspirant to the black pillar. In fact the two grade initiations of Practicus and Philosophus compliment and balance each other so completely, that it is difficult to adequately describe one without describing the other. The Element offered for the process of transmutation in this grade is Fire. It is the Fiery section of the aspirant's psyche (Fire of Malkuth in Assiah).114 Once again the two primary opposing and parental Elements are counterbalanced one against the other so that neither is allowed to overwhelm the other. Two of the paths leading to this grade are watery in Nature, therefore the two primary Ele- ments of Water and Fire are both encountered in this grade, as in the preceding one. However in the 4 = 7 grade their order and potency are reversed. In the Practicus grade the Element of Water was predominant. In the Philosophus grade the Fire Element now swirls in fury, though it is only able to safely manifest upon the complimentary Element of Water. The 4 = 7 ceremony can be summarized as follows: After the standard (self-initiatory) rite of opening, the forces of Elemental Fire are invoked. Then the candidate must prove that s/he has grasped the secrets of the Practicus grade and swear an oath. Between the spheres of Malkuth and Netzach lies the 29th Path of Qoph, a journey of psychic evolution and the conquering of fears and illusions. On this path, the candidate is confronted by the three Egyptian godforms of Osiris, Horus and Isis. These figures symbolize the various attributes of Elemen- tal Water and the different aspects of time. After completing the 29th Path, the can- didate is shown the Tarot card of The Moon. Next the mysteries of the 28th Path of Tzaddi are revealed to the candidate by a different triad of godforms: Isis, Nephthys and Hathor. These godforms expose the initiate to the different aspects of Celestial Water-the Waters of Cre- ation and the Waters of Life. The Path of Tzaddi is a journey of intuitive awareness where the student learns how to tap into the deep well of knowledge within the 114 It is also Netzach of Malkuth. 473"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"474 SELF-INfTIATION INTO TIIE GoWEN DAWN TRAOmON subconscious mind through meditation and imagination. A further description from The Chaldean Oracles on the Monad, Duad and Triad is revealed to the aspi- rant. When the journey on the Path of Tzaddi is finished, the candidate is shown the Tarot card of The Star. The mysteries of the 27th Path of Peh are then revealed to the candidate. This is a Martial path which unveils the Biblical story of the death of the Kings of Edom (Chaos). The Path of Peh is a difficult but very necessary journey which includes the fiery destruction of the old and outmoded in favor of the new. It is the removal of all that is base and low within the mind of the candidate in favor of that which is Divine. This journey symbolizes the beginning phase of the recon- struction of the aspirant's psyche. When the pilgrimage on the Path of Peh is com- pleted, the candidate is shown the Tarot card of The Tower. The later part of the ritual involves the initiate's entry into the temple of Netzach. During this time the aspirant is shown symbolism concerning the Gar- den of Eden after the Fall and the Philosophus Hall itself. The secrets of the 4 = 7 grade are disclosed, until at length, the Powers of Fire are released. The three officers stationed in the Practicus Hall (in addition to the Dais officers) are the Hierophant, the Hiereus, and the Hegemon. Initially they form the figure of the Water triangle with the station of the Hiereus marking the apex in the West. This alludes to the Watery nature of the 29th and 28th Paths of Qoph and Tzaddi, which the candidate traverses in this grade. The pillars are placed in the Southeast, indicating the exact placement of these paths on the Tree. In the fourth segment of the ceremony, which marks the candidate's entrance into the 27th Path of Peh, all three officers are stationed in the East-the Hiereus and the Hegemon on either side of the Hierophant. This points out the direction of the 27th Path on the Tree of Life as a reciprocal path-one which straddles all three columns on the Tree. Finally in the fifth segment of the ceremony, the officers are positioned in the form of a Fire triangle, the symbol of the Fiery nature of the Sephirah Netzach, into which the aspirant has achieved entry. The two Elements of Fire and Water, when sensibly directed and creatively engaged can lead to the reconstruction of the Garden of Eden from the chaos into which it had plunged. The Divine Light cannot dwell within humanity until dis- order has been transformed into the harmony of total realization and illumination. Human beings cannot claim inner peace and tranquillity until order and balance has been restored to the lower Elements of Malkuth. The 27th Path in particular heralds the beginning of this process in the ini- tiate. Through the stimulation of the fiery and watery Elements within the mind, the aspirant begins to realize the chaotic state of his/her own existence and the confusion that reigns within the psyche as a result of spiritual denial and stagna- tion. Although these Elements naturally call forth that which is high and sublime within the Soul, they also awaken that which is gross and low. Consequently, the first step in the process of reconstruction is a leveling or unbalancing-the tearing down in an analytical progression, of all that was previously held in high esteem. The result is of course disorder and darkness, an undesirable state, but one that is absolutely necessary if one wishes to transcend chaos and make progress toward"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade 475 true spiritual growth. From the ashes of the old Tower of Edom, the new Tower of Light may be constructed. The symbolism encountered on the Path of Peh serves two purposes. First of all, it serves to awaken those long forgotten root memories inherent within the very cells of our bodies-what could be termed Macrocosmic memories of the pri- mordial evolution of Creation itself. In addition, the symbols also refer to the Microcosmic experiences of chaos and reconstruction which occur on a personal level within the initiate. To the aspirant, the stimulation of the magical Elements along with the process of introspection is analogous to causing a small earthquake in one's personal universe. The Path of Peh describes those periods when the aspirant becomes aware of being assailed by personal conflicts and inner complexes which have contami- nated the spiritual progress. Having these \"complexes\" abruptly moved from the hidden depths of the subconscious (where they could be forgotten) to the exposing light of the conscious mind can be quite an uncomfortable ordeal. These are literally tests of inner strength, where the candidate must summon the courage to examine these undesirable parts of the psyche and deal with them properly. This may include the need to eliminate some excess psychic \"garbage.\" As strenuous as these experi- ences are, they are also one of the hallmarks of a successful initiation. This represents the first half of the alchemical phrase \"solve et coagula.\" As in Alchemy, the process of analysis and dissolution must always pre- cede assimilation. The Philosopher's gold is always obtained from the gross mat- ter, through a chemical process which the Alchemical texts often describe as nox- ious and disagreeable. Yet in every case, the Alchemists also hold that this unpleasant condition always precedes the most exalted results. The task of the Philosophus is to balance the combined energies of Fire and Water, emotion and intellect. This foreshadows the second half of the Alchemical phrase, the coagula process, which comes into full power in the Portal grade, where the previous chaos is sublimated and infused with Spirit, making possible a higher level of spiritual attainment. The name bestowed upon an initiate of this grade, Philosophus, is based on a Greek word which means, \"lover of Wisdom.\"1) The Biblical Passages Many of the speeches recited in the Philosophus ceremony during the candidate's passage through the 27th Path are taken from various passages in the Old Testa- ment which deal specifically with the fall of the Kings of Edom. A few of the ver- sicles are taken from the Books of Genesis and Exodus, but the bulk of them are from the books of Judges, Psalms, and Habakkuk. Areoccurring theme in most of these passages is the sudden and warlike (Martial) fury in which the old kingdom of Chaos represented by the Edomites was destroyed. The \"reign of Edom\" was the reign of the unbalanced and chaotic forces of the primordial worlds. Ushered in after the reign of Edom was the period of balance and order called the \"reign of"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"476 SELF-INITIATION INTO 1HE GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON Israel.\" There are also many passages in the ritual which refer to the majesty and might of the Creator of the universe. The Babylonian Influence The Biblical passages that occur in the Philosophus grade can be traced directly to the more ancient beliefs of the Babylonians, the inheritors of the geographic rem- nants of Eden. As stated in the previous chapter, the words Eden and Adam are far older than the Sumerian civilization in which they came to be used. Also, the con- cept of Yahweh being\" a man of war,\" and \"lord of armies,\" sounds remarkably like the descriptions of Marduk and Baal, principle gods of war in the Babylonian pan- theon. The authors of the Old Testament were no doubt very familiar with this pan- theon, and were writing for an audience who also knew of the power that these gods were said to possess. The Biblical writers knew that in order to impress their audience with the might of Yahweh (i'm''!'), the deity must have the same warrior attributes, and be able to vanquish the same ancient enemies that Marduk and Baal had vanquished. For both Marduk and Baal were involved in Creation Myths wherein the forces of Light and Order overcome the Forces of Darkness and Chaos. In the Babylonian text known as the Enuma elish (\"when on high\"), the story of Creation unfolds as follows: In the beginning, nothing existed but a watery Chaos made up of the Apsu, the sweet waters, Tiamat, the sea, and Mummu, the clouds and mist. From this combination of different waters came the birth of two gods named Lahmu and Lahamu, deities of fertility and expanse, who in turn sired the gods Anshar and Kishar, both aspects of the horizon. This pair gave birth to Anu, the great sky god, and other generations of deities followed. Eventually, as the story goes, a generational gap formed between the older gods and the younger, active gods. A conflict occurred wherein the most ancient god Apsu regretted having sired such noisy children and vowed to obliterate them. When the wise Ea (Enki) learned of this, he cast a magic spell over Apsu which caused him to fall asleep. Ea then killed the ancient one and established a portion of the world as it now is: the waters of Apsu sank down, and over them Ea established the earth. (This was the first great victory over chaos.) Over time Tiamat convinced her allies to avenge the death of her husband, Apsu, and negotiations between the two factions fell through. Because of the impending crisis the gods decided to elect a warrior to lead them in the fight against Tiamat and her army of monster serpents and fierce dragons. They chose Marduk, son of Ea, who armed himself with thunder and lightning (the weapons of a storm god), bow and arrow, a mace, a net, four winds, seven storms and an Evil, disease-earrying wind. At the sight of the great Marduk in his chariot, Tiamat's army fled-only Tiamat herself stood her ground. Marduk forced her to swallow the Evil Wind and then killed her with an arrow. He split her body into two halves, one of which he used to create the starry heavens. He posted guards over her and bade them \"to allow not her waters to escape.\" After banishing the waters of Chaos and estab-"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade 477 lishing Order, Marduk was enthroned as the Sovereign of Babylon and of the uni- verse with the proclamation Marduk sarru, \"Marduk is King.\" In ancient Canaan, Baal was the god of storm and of war. This god, along with his warrior sister Anath, did battle with a mighty opponent called Yamm, the sea (also known as Naher, \"the River\"). The legend says that the god El, head of the gods, instructed that a palace be built for Prince Yamm, thus giving Yamm authority over the other gods. Baal cursed Yamm, who then demanded that Baal be handed over to him as a slave. Eventually Baal breaks the back of Yamm, and is made King. In ancient Mesopotamia, the waters of the flooded rivers would have been a threat to life, and their orderly control signified a victory over Chaos (Marduk over Tiamat). And in Canaan the battle between Baal and Yamm seems to have taken place in the late fall when the sea was too rough for safe sailing. The sea pounding against the shore and threatening to flood (Rabbim) the lower regions, was understood to be a chaotic force waging war against Order. In both legends Tiamat/Yamm is seen as the sum of all Water that is destructive to human life, whereas Marduk/Baal, gods of the storm, bring rains which help maintain the growth of vegetation and human survival. In another story, Baal is said to have conquered a rival named Lotan, the serpent. Lotan is also referred to as Shalyat, the seven-headed. It is possible that Yamm (the destructive sea) and Rabbim, (the flood) are names of the same Chaos god who is also referred to as Lotan/Shalyat, the serpent or Dragon.P\" When the writers of the Old Testament inherited the mythos of ancient Babylonia, they used it to express that the idea that Yahweh, god of the Hebrews, was King of the universe, as was previously said of Marduk. Yahweh, like Marduk and Baal before him must also vanquish the powers of Chaos and Darkness. And as in the previous legends, these chaotic powers take the form of the Deep or Tehom (C,nn-reminiscent of Tiamat), Yamm (C~), the sea, and the seven-headed dragon called Leviathan (r~~'~) [Lotan]. The Biblical passages that were employed in the Philosophus Ritual emphasize these Hebraisized Babylonian legends of the battle between the Forces of Order (Light) and the Forces of Chaos (Darkness) at the time when the universe was created. Examples of the Hebrew god of war doing battle with the monsters of Chaos can be found in other passages as well: Awake! Awake!Arm of Yahweh, put on strength! Awake,as in the days of old, everlasting generations! Was it not you cutting in pieces Rahab and piercing the sea monster? Was it not you drying up the sea (yam) and the waters of the great deep (tehom), who made the depths of the sea (yam) a way for the redeemed to pass? (Isaiah 51:9-10) 115 In ancient Egypt the Chaos deity is called Apophis, the dragon or serpent of Darkness, who attempted to swallow Re, the Sun god."},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"478 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN l'RADmoN For Elohim is my kingof old, who works salvation in the midstof the land. You broke the sea (yam) by your strength. You broke the heads of sea-monsters in the waters. You broke the head of Leviathan in pieces. You made made him food for the people of the wilderness. (Psalm 74:12-14) One of the passages given in the Philosophus Ritual (Psalm 18),116 is a song of praise to Yahweh by one who was rescued from the pits of hell. This passage could have easily been used to describe the storm god, Marduk/Baal doing battle with the forces of Tiamat/Yamm: He also bowed the Heavens, and came down and Darkness was under his feet. (v. 9) Out of the brightness before Him, his dark clouds passed through, Hailstones andand coals of fire. (v.12) Yahweh also thundered in the heavens; and the Highest uttered his voice- Hailstones and coals of fire. (v. 13) Yea, he sent out his arrows and scattered them, andhe shot out lightnings and confounded them. (v.14) Then the stream beds of the waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were bared, at your rebuke, 0 Yahweh, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils. ( v. 18) A large section of the Biblical passages in this ritual come from the third chapter of the Book of Habakkuk, which portrays Yahweh marching as a divine warrior from Ternan and Mount Paran ready for battle, causing the land of Mid- ian to tremble. It describes Yahweh's furious anger at the sea and the rivers. The river (Naher) was cut in two and the Deep (Tehom) groaned under the wrath of the god. The enemy was smashed and pierced with arrows, as the warrior god trampled the sea-the \"many waters.\" This imagery is almost completely lifted from the Canaanite story of Baal conquering Yamm.P? It is another example of the ancient story of Chaos being vanquished by Order.e A few of the words and references made in these Biblical verses deserve further exploration and thought: 116 This passage is virtually identical to that given in 2 Samuel 22. 117 After the discovery of certain Ugaritic texts, scholars have concluded that Psalm 29 also is a Hebraisized Hymn to Baal."},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade 479 KISHON: meaning \"curved, laborious, hard, inflexible, difficult\" and also \"tor- ture.\" An important river in Palestine.

MEROZ: meaning \"shrinking, contracting, becoming compact.\" A place in Pales- tine belonging to the Israelites. Curses were pronounced against Meroz because its inhabitants did not join in the fight against the Canaanites. U8 Ideas related to the word include a retreat, secret place, or place of refuge. This might allude to a place in the consciousness that receives Wisdom but does not give out WlSdom. It indi- cates that if Wisdom is gained, it is to be used, but if this Wisdom is not used, it maybe lost. LEBANON: meaning \"white, clean, pure.\" A place in Palestine.

Discordant or contentious thoughts.e The Godforms Two different godform triads reveal themselves to the aspirant in the Philosophus ceremony. The first triad is composed of Osiris, Horus and Isis, who in this ritual represent the various forms of Water and aspects of time. A triangle is the strongest architectural figure known, as well as the only polygon that all other such polygons can be reduced to. The triad symbolizes two opposing forces and one which \"anchors\" and stabilizes them. This is why the idea of the divine triad is so universal to many traditions. The speeches in this ceremony taken from the Chaldean Oracles concerning the Monad, the Duad and Triad, reiterate this fact. In the 4 = 7 grade Osiris represents the Divine Light which is so brilliant that it is every bit as blinding as absolute darkness, concealing and reflecting all. At this stage, he symbolizes the Past, the brilliance and stillness that was Eden before the Fall. Osiris alludes to the beginning act of creation-the Ruach Elohim who moved upon the face of the Waters. The second godform in this triad is Horus. In the Philosophus grade he is the destroyer, the Martial arm of YHVH Elohim wielding the Sword of Justice and Severity. He symbolizes a raging storm, the harsh instrument of purification that is employed to banish the Kings of Chaos and put an end to disorder. Horus also suggests the future, which is changed forever due to the fall of the Edomite kings. Isis is the reconciler between Osiris and Horus-between stillness and storm, past and future. She is Water flowing in steady movement toward the sea. She is also the Present which mediates between the purity of Eden past, and the stormy future of the post-Edomite realm. It is she who acts on humanity's behalf to gently guide us back to Eden. The second triad of godforms in the Philosophus ritual represent the Celestial Waters of Life. These Stellar Waters of Creation are the Waters of the sub- conscious mind, which flow back through the layers of time to the rivers of Par- adise. This is the flow of Light and Wisdom from its eternal Source to the psyche of the initiate. The triad involved consists of the three goddesses, Isis, Nephthys and Hathor. These feminine godforms illustrate the idea of the Fountain of Wis- dom-a receptive and sacred vessel which distills Knowledge to all lower vessels. In this triad, Isis symbolizes the direct influence of the Divine upon the mind of the initiate. She interacts on behalf of the Supernal Light directly through sudden illumination and realization. Nephthys personifies the subtle influence of the Divine upon the aspirant. She is responsible for clandestine knowledge and cryptic messages which are planted gradually through the deepest parts of the subconscious mind and through dreams. Hathor delineates the intermediary type of divine influence which depends upon both direct illumination and subtle communication. She alludes to"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade 481 the conscious mind actively petitioning the subconscious mind for knowledge obtained through meditation and contemplation.c After taking the 4 = 7 initiation, the task of the Philosophus is to thor- oughly digest all knowledge associated with the Element of Fire and the Planet Venus.

Ritual work and meditations suit- able to the grade, are also covered.

The black cubical altar is placed in the center of the room. Upon it should be placed the Tarot card of The Moon. Two large candle hold- ers complete with candles flank the Northern and Southern side of the altar. The pillars are placed in the Southeast part of the Hall before the Dais. The Hebrew let- ter Qoph is shown on a large plaque in the Northeast. Directly East is the letter Tau, while in the Southeast is Shin. The Banners of the East and West are located near their respective officers. The Enochian Tablet of Fire is placed in the South, and the Tablets of Earth, Air and Water are also shown. Place the lamens and implements in accordance with the temple diagram, in the positions of the officer- forms. The station of Hierophant is located in the Northeast, while the station of Hegemon is in the Southeast. The Hiereus is stationed in the West. In addition, you will need three cups of Water to be placed by each officer's station. As in the previous ritual, all of the Elemental candles should be placed around the circumference of the room, with a white candle in the East. The red Fire candle is to be placed before the Enochian Tablet of the South, along with a censer of incense. The lights on the pillars should be unshaded. (Note: For later segments of the ritual, the aspirant will need the follow- ing items close at hand: plaques of the Hebrew letters Resh, Samekh, Tzaddi, Peh, Mem, Ayin, Kaph and Nun, as well as the Qamea, seal and sigils of Venus (see Chapter Four), the Tarot cards of The Star and The Tower, and the diagram of the Garden of Eden after the Fall (see Plate 4).

The Hegemon turns to the right. You pass between the pillars and follow her as she leads you slowly around the Hall. Take time however to visualize the following: At this point, briefly imagine in your mind's eye that you are pass- ing through a gate marked with the Hebrew letter Qoph-Ieaving the sphere of Malkuth behind and following your guide through a red-violet tunnel or passageway. You are leaving the material world behind as you begin to traverse the watery path of the sub- conscious mind that connects the Active World with the Realm of the Emotions and Instincts. The energy of the path is feral and untamed, as if you have stepped out of a time machine and into a primeval marshland that exists at the edge of a vast ocean. Sounds of insects and creatures that live near the wetlands are all around you. Your senses seem unusually sharp on this path, as if you had somehow regained some of the instincts of humanity's primitive ancestors. The air has the humid, muddy smell of a swamp teem- ing with life and death. Your guide leads onward. After one circumambulation around the Hall, the Hegemon leads you to the Hierophant's throne. The officer-form of the Hierophant rises, and you perceive the features of dark Osiris, very familiar to you now. Holding a cup of Water, the figure approaches you and begins to speak: The priest with the mask of OSIRIS spake and said: \"I am Water stag- nant and silent and still, reflecting all, concealing all.I am the Past-I am the Inundation. He who riseth from the Great Waters is my Name. Hail unto ye, Dwellers of the Land of Night! For the rending of Dark- ness is near.\" After hearing the god's speech, a hush comes over the Path of Qoph, as if the crea- tures of the marsh had suddenly detected a new presence. The Water at your feet is like the glass of a black mirror-offering both reflections and enigmas. The Hege- mon leads you round to the station of the Hiereus, who rises at your approach with Water cup in hand. The hawkish eyes of Horus flash with a greenish glare as the figure speaks to you: The Priest with the Mask of HORUS spake and said: \"I am Water, turbid and troubled. I am the Banisher of Peace in the vast abode of the Waters.

The wind lashes at the trees surrounding the marsh. Foam-crested waves begin to inundate the still waters of the swamp, pounding the marshland reeds with relentless force. The creatures of the wetlands have either burrowed deeper into the mud or escaped to higher ground. The eerie howling of the wind reminds you of the baying of wild dogs. In the shifting Moonlit shadows of the storm, you see monstrous bestial shapes slinking along the outskirts of the swamp, just beyond your peripheral vision-always moving ahead of your ability to see them clearly. They resemble shapes from long-ago memories and stories which frightened you as a child. They also resemble phobias that you may still cling to-unreasoning fears. Although the shapes are alarming, you resist the human urge to run away in fear. You are determined to stay the course. The appearance of the phantom shapes, together with the ferocity of the storm gives you a rush of adrenaline and excitement. You feel very much alive on this ominous path. 491 The officer-form of the Hegemon leads you round to her own station where she takes up the cup of Water. The face of Thme is gone-in its place is the countenance of the great goddess Isis, calm and reflective. She speaks to you: The Priestess with the mask of ISIS spake and said: \"The traveler through the Gates of Anubis is my Name. I am Water, pure and limpid, ever flowing on toward the sea.

Gone are the phantom shapes of the night, banished with the night itself as the rays of morning embrace the sky. It is as though the stagnant Water of the swamp has been cleansed by the overflow of Water from the sea, mingling with the fresh Water from the marsh.

From the Father of Waters went forth the Spirit, rending asunderthe veils of Darkness. And therewas but a Vastness of Silence and of Depth in the placeof the Gathering Waters. Terrible was the Silence of that Uncreated world-lmmeasurable the depth of that Abyss. And the Countenances of Darkness half-formed arose- they abode not-they hasted away-and in the Darkness of Vacancy, the Spirit moved and the Ughtbearers existed for a space. I have said Darkness of Darkness-are not the Countenances of Darkness fallen with Kings? Do the Sonsof the Nightof Time last for ever? And havethey not yet passed away? You continue the speech: Before all things are the Waters andthe Darkness andthe Gates of the Land of Night. And the CHAOS cried aloud for Unity of Form -and the Face of the ETERNAL arose. Before the Glory of that Countenance theNight rolled back and the Darkness hasted away. In the Waters beneath was that Face reflected, in the Formless Abyss of the Void. From those Eyes darted rays of terrible splendor which crossed with the currents reflected. That Brow and those Eyes formed the triangle of the Measureless Heavens-and their reflections formed the triangle of the Measureless Waters. And thus was for- mulated the eternal Hexad-the number of the Dawning Creation. Hold the Admission Badge for the Path of Qoph high and say: The Calvary Cross of Twelve Squares fitly represents the ZODIAC which embraces the Waters of Nu as the ancient Egyptians called the Heavens, the Waters which be above the Firmament. It also alludes to the eternal Riverof Eden, divided intofour Heads which find their correlations in the four triplicities of the Zodiac. Put the cross aside and focus your attention on the plaque of the letter Qoph.

The Moon is in its increase on the side of Mercy, Gedulah, and from it proceed sixteen principle and sixteen secondary rays, which make 32, the number of the paths ofYetzirah. Sheis the Moon at thefeet of the Woman of Revelations, ruling equally overthe cold and moist natures and the pas- sive Elements of Earth and Water. It is to be noted that the symbol of the Sign is formed of two Lunar crescents bound together. It thus shows the Lunar nature of the Sign. The Dogs are the Jackals of the Egyptian ANU- BIS, guarding the Gates of the East and of the West, shown by the two Towers between which lies the pathof all the heavenly bodies ever rising in the East and setting in the West. The Crayfish is the Sign Cancer and was anciently the Scarabeus or Khepera, the emblem of the Sun below the Horizon as he ever is when the Moon is increasing above.

You are leaving the astral sphere behind as you begin to traverse the celestial path of the human imagination that connects the sphere of Foundation with the Realm of the Emotions. The energy of the path is comforting and dreamy, as if you have suddenly entered a place of great serenity and beauty- a place where you could look out unto the vastness of Nature and be awestruck by the marvel of its grand design.

Thme leads you around to the station of Hiereus, The godform of Horus rises with red lamp in hand and speaks: The Dukes of Edom were amazed, trembling they took hold of the Mighty MOAB. Lord, when Thou wentest out of SEIR, when Thou marchest out of the Field of Edom, the Earth trembled and the Heavens dropped-the Clouds also dropped Water. You take up the red lamp at the station of Hiereus and continue the speech: Curse ye MEROZ, said the Angel of the Lord-eurse ye bitterly, the inhabitants thereof, because they came not to the help of the Lord-to the help of the Lord against the Mighty.

The Voice of the Lord is full of Majesty. The Voice of the Lord breaketh the Cedars of Lebanon. The Voice of the Lord divideth the Flames of Fire. Throe finishes the speech: The Voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. Visualize the following: There is an eerie calm upon the path, and the air smells of ozone. Around you are the devastated remains of the chaotic archetypes, lying about like so many charred bricks. As you walk along the path, you spot portions of the archetypes that you can still use-a healthy belief concerning your own self-worth that your parents instilled within you-a positive belief about the welfare of others that was given to you by a clergyman. There are also beliefs that you no longer care to keep-a belief that one religion has the right to dictate to other religions-a belief that you cannot succeed at something that you are striving for. Now that the old archetypes lay in pieces upon the ground, you can closely examine each one.

I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction and the curtain of the Land of Midian did tremble. Was the Lord displeased against the Rivers? Was Thy Wrath against the Sea that Thou didst ride upon Thy horses and Chariots of Salvation? Thou didst cleave asunder the Earth with the Rivers. The Mountains saw Thee and they trembled. The deluge of Waters rolled by. The Deep uttered His voice and lifted up His hands on high. The SUN and the MOON stood still in their habitations. At the Lightof Thine arrows they went- at the shining of Thy Glittering Spear. The Hierophant finishes the speech: Thou didst march through the Land in indignation. Thou didst thrash the Heathen in Thine Anger. Thou didst march through the Sea with Thy Horses-through the depth of the Mighty Waters.

It is the Power of the Triad rushingdown and destroying the columns of Darkness. Three holes are rent in the walls, symbolizing the establishment of the Triad therein and the crown at thesummit of the Tower isfalling, as the crowns of the Kings of Edom fell, who are also symbolized by the men falling headlong. On the right hand side of the Tower is LIGHT and the representation of the Tree of LIFE by ten circles thus disposed. On the left hand side is DARKNESS and eleven circles symbolizing the QLIPPOTH. Visualize the following: Imagine that you are at the end of the reddish path of Peh. In your mind's eye imagine that you now stand before the green gate that is the entrance leading to the Fire temple of Netzach. You realize that your journey through the 27th Path has been a personal psy- chic restructuring. This has meant a necessary and sudden destruc- tion of the old and the unbalanced in order to completely overhaul and rebuild a new orderly psychic reality. The Kings of Edom rep- resented chaotic thoughts, some of which are your own, and some of which have been implanted in your mind by others. Only by taking the tower of your personal beliefs apart and examining the merits of each belief can you achieve spiritual growth. This also entails a balancing of the Intellect with the Emotions. Some beliefs are based purely on irrational emotional responses, devoid of rea- son. Other beliefs are cold intellectual abstractions with no basis in real life. A healthy balance must be struck between these two extremes in order to build order out of chaos. Osiris speaks to you: I hereby confer on you the Title of Lord (Lady) of the Twenty-sev- enth Path.

Changes in the temple set for the remainder of the ritual-the temple of Netzach: Place the pillars slightly West of the altar. Just East of the altar should be a diagram stand with the drawing of The Garden of Eden after the Fall placed thereon. Upon the altar the cross should be placed below the triangle. The triangle is pointed apex upwards, and its three points are surrounded by the three red lamps which had accompanied the officers in the previous part of the ritual. The station of Hiereus is situated North of the altar, while the station of Hegemon is located South of the altar. The station of the Hierophant remains in the East. The plaques of the Hebrew letters are needed as follows: East-Kaph, Northeast- Nun, North-Peh, Northwest-Tzaddi, Northwest-Qoph.

Carved into this door is the letter Nun painted in red. Osiris, Horus and Isis stand before you, holding up their red lamps and blocking your final passage into Hod with the Banner of the West. You hold up the Hegemon's Lamen and pro- claim that you have received the Title of Lord/Lady of the 29th, 28th and 27th Paths. The Banner of the West is withdrawn and the guardians permit you final entrance into the Fire temple of Net- zach. Astrally, you give the Neophyte Signs followed by the Sign of a Philosophus and then step through the door into Netzach. The temple is a seven-sided chamber draped in curtains of green silk. The floor and ceiling are constructed of pure emerald, while the ceiling itself is ornamented with the ruby figure of a hep- tagram. The scent of rose is in the Air. Seven columns surround the red central altar, upon which are a temple flame, a sistrum and seven roses. The winged Archangel Haniel is also here, a fair-haired femi- nine being in robes of green chiffon. She leads you to a curtain at the far end of the temple. Giving the Sign of the Spiraling Ught, you step through the curtain. Again you find yourself in the familiar Courtyard of the Tabernacle. Quickly you walk past the brazen altar and the laver, entering the outer chamber of the Holy Place before the golden altar. As always, you offer up coals and incense and perform the Qabalistic Cross. Then crossing the chamber, the veil before you separates and you behold once again the sacred Ark. You stare into the Divine Light that is perched atop the golden Mercy Seat between the two winged Kerubim. A further vision of the Garden of Eden presents itself to you: You see again before you the Tree of Life, connected by the rivers of Paradise that you first encountered in the Practicus grade. But the vision before you has lost all of its former tranquillity. In Malkuth the mighty crowned goddess Eve, had supported the entire Tree of Life by single-handedly holding up the two great opposing pillars of Fire and Cloud, Light and Darkness. Yet just as in the story of Prometheus who stole the divine Fire from Heaven assisted by Pal-"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"510 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN 'fRAomoN las Athene, the goddess of Wisdom, Eve reached down to partake of the fruits of knowledge. She performed what could be consid- ered the first act of Free Will, by which primitive humanity took a step forward in the physical evolution which separated humankind from the rest of Nature. In doing so she changed the destiny of the human race forever, because a sentient animal had no place in the Garden of Paradise. As Eve reached down to grasp knowledge and secure it for humanity, she left the two mighty pillars unsupported. As a result, the Sephirotic Tree was shattered. Once knowledge was attained, the great red dragon of seven heads and ten horns, which had been asleep below Malkuth, was awakened and set loose. Loosing her steady footing, Eve fell and so did the great Adam. They could no longer remain like the other creatures in the forest, motivated by instinct alone. They now possessed the ability to think, to be self-aware, to make tools, and to use knowledge-- whether for good or ill-only their Free Will could decide which. Together they fell from the garden. The coils of the dragon enveloped Malkuth, and its heads rose up into the seven lower Sephiroth, even up to Daath at the feet of the Great goddess Aima Elohim. The Dragon grew an eighth head, and from this hissing mouth of Leviathan, the Infernal Waters began to flow into Daath, threatening even the Supernals themselves. For a moment you have a glimpse of the Supernal Realm: The goddess Aima Elohim has turned her face away from the Gar- den in sorrow. The great god Yah looks on with compassion. Above them both is the crown of Kether. Then YHVH Elohim placed the four letters of the Unutter- able Name, the Mighty Kerubim, and the Flaming Sword between the devastated Garden and the Supernal Eden, protecting it from the Dragon of Chaos. The Mighty Kerubim fought back the serpent and a great chasm known as the Abyss was formed to mark the battlefield, cutting off the Supernal Eden from the lower branches of the Tree. Thick dark clouds rolled in to obscure the Garden and hide it from humanity's sight. Gradually, this vision of the Garden of Eden fades once more into the brilliant Light above the mercy Seat of the Ark. The curtain before you closes and obscures the Ark and its guardians. You are again in the astral temple of Netzach. Bring the focus of your conscious mind back to the Philosophus Hall. Perform the Adoration to the Lord of the Universe.

Then arose the Great Dragon with Seven Heads and Ten Horns, and the Garden was made desolate, and MALKUTH was cut offfrom the Sephi- rothby his intersecting folds, and linked unto the Kingdom of Shells. And the Seven lower Sephiroth were cut off from the Three Supernals in DAATH, at thefeet of AlMA ELOHIM. And on the Heads of the Dragon are the names and crowns of the Edomite Kings. And because in DAATH was the greatest rise of the Great Serpent of Evil, therefore is there, as it were, another Sephirah, makingfor the Infer- nalor Averse Sephiroth, Eleven instead of Ten. And hence were the Rivers of Eden desecrated, andfrom theMouth of the Dragon rushed the Infernal Waters in DAATH. And this is LEVIATHAN, the Crooked Serpent. But between the Devastated Garden and the Supernal Eden, YHVH ELOHIM placed the letters of the NAME and the FLASHING SWORD that the uppermost part of the Tree of Life might not be involved in the Fall of Adam. And thence it was necessary that the SECOND ADAM should come to restore all things and that, as the First Adam had been extended on the cross of the Celestial Rivers, so the SON should be cruci- fied on the cross of the Infernal Rivers ofDAATH. Yet, to do this, he must descend unto the lowest first, even unto Malkuth and be born of her. 511 The officer-form of the Hierophant captures your attention to give you the secrets of the grade.

It is formed from the initial and final letters of the Greek, Latin, and Hebrew alphabets thus: A and Z, Aleph and Tau (~N), Alpha and Omega (AQ). It is used with various meanings by different writers, but for the most part it symbolizes the beginning and the end, or rather the Essence. Azoth is considered the Universal Medicine of Alchemy, or the universal remedy said to contain within itself all other medicines. The term is oftentimes used for Alchemic Mercury, and some consider Azoth to be a living essence or Spirit, containing a Soul. In addition to the Sephiroth on the Tree of Life, many other concepts and names occur in Qabalistic writings. These include what are known as the Three Veils of Negative Existence. They are: AIN (rae): which means ''Negativity,'' \"Nothing,\" or \"Not,\" Ain is the outermost Veil. AIN SOPH (&'C r~N): or \"Limitless.\" Ain Soph is the middle Veil. Ain Soph is the vessel that contains the Ain. AIN SOPH AUR (\"N &'C tN): or \"the Limitless Light.\" The Innermost Veil from which the Sephirah of Kether was formed. Ain SophAur is the restricted Light which is the result of the junction of Ain and Ain Soph. The idea of the Three Negative Veils is a concept that defies human attempts to describe the Veils as something. They are planes of existence which lie outside of all human realms of experience. Humankind naturally thinks in terms of \" some- things II rather than \"nothings.\" We simply cannot understand these Veils in terms of anything we can compare them to. The student is reminded of yet another polarity of the Qabalah-just as the Light cannot exist with Darkness, \"some- thing\" cannot exist without \"nothing.\" Ain is truly the only constant in the uni- verse, it has always been, and will always be. \"Somethings\" always need a point of beginning, even the highest sphere of Kether. The Limitless Nothing, on the other hand, has always existed. All of creation springs from and returns to it. It is the calm silence-the Limitless Light of being-infinity. These unmanifested Veils of negativity contain within themselves the seeds of positive existence and the manifest universe as we know it. This negativity can be symbolized by the Greek letters Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. That being stated at the outset, we will attempt the impossible-to describe the Veils in terms that the reader can relate to. The main characteristic of the Veil of Ain is to give or bestow of its own essence. Thus the Veil of Ain is said to be a masculine/positive aspect of God which seeks to stimulate or impart of its own essential Light. The attribute of Ain Soph, the feminine/negative aspect of God is to take in the Light. Ain Soph is said to be the perfect vessel which seeks to receive and"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade 517 contain the Light in order to bestow it. The Ain Soph suppressed her desire to receive the Light in order to transmit the Light. Thus the Ain Soph formed into an empty circle which was surrounded by a circle of Light. A shaft of the Light pene- trated the empty circle to its center, resulting in a succession of concentric circles which marked the divisions of creation. The primary point of Light formed at the center of Ain Soph is Ain Soph Aur, the Limitless Light from which the universe was created. In Lurianic Qabalah,121 the creation of Kether is said to have come from a process of zimzum or \"contraction\" of the Ain Soph from the surrounding Light-not unlike an empty set of lungs inhaling to gather in and contain (and therefore limit) the surrounding air. ADAM KADMON (f'tl'l' C'M): From the Light point of Ain Soph Aur the \"Body\" of the Divine was formed-the primordial man that preceded all other primordials. This is Adam Kadmon, the \"archetypal man\" or prototype of human- ity which is circumscribed on the Tree of Life. Kether, the crown is above his head, and Malkuth is at his feet. This divine human contains the essence of YHVH, for Yod of the Four-Lettered Name is symbolized by the head of Adam Kadmon, the letter Heh alludes to the arms and shoulders, the letter Vav refers to the torso, and Heh Sophith is attributed to the legs and feet. Conceived prior to the world of Atziluth, Adam Kadmon was the first of four reflections of the Eternal which become manifest as existence evolved from .the Divine to the Material. He is an intervening link between the Ain Soph and the order of Qabalistic Worlds yet to come into manifestation. Adam Kadmon is the consciousness of the Divine, containing within himself everything that is needed to create the manifest universe as a reflection of the divine universe. He contains within his being Will (Atziluth), Intellect (Briah), Emotion (Yetzirah) and Assiah (the capacity for action). Adam Kadmon is the mirror of reflection that is used by the Divine to experience itself through the Four Worlds of the Qabalah, for only a descent into all four Worlds will enable the Divine to apperceive all aspects of divinity. However, once Adam Kadmon descends into the Active World of Manifestation, he must be reflected back to the original Atziluthic Source. The body of Adam Kadmon on the Sephiroth of the Tree of Life is a larger reflection of the human body superimposed on the spheres of the Tree. (Therefore the Pillar of Mercy is located at Adam Kadmon's right-hand side and the Pillar of Severity at his left-hand side. When applying the Tree of Life to your own body, a reflection of the Godhead is achieved. The Pillar of Mercy is on your left side while the Pillar of Severity is on your right.) The Qabalistic restriction of the Divine Light into spheres which made up the body of Adam Kadmon was for the purpose of the creation of humanity. But the Light was still too potent to fulfill that purpose. Thus the Light was divided into Four Worlds, each world successively veiled from the one which preceded it.

This event corresponds to the destruction of the initial, failed worlds of the previous Qabalah-the universe of Chaos or Tohu. According to the tradition, there are two aspects of the emanation of the Divine Light. One is linear, in the form of the body of Adam Kadmon, (or the glyph of the Tree of Life as we know it). The second is circular, wherein the Sephiroth took form within Adam Kadmon in a series of con- centric circles. The outermost circle was Kether, which abided in close proximity to the encompassing circle of Ain Soph Aur. At this early stage the Sephiroth were not yet separate, but bound together as a series of Lights or Points. These Sephi- rotic Lights were then given \"vessels\" or fields of containment, in which to orga- nize their substance and operations. What occurred next was what is called the \"Breaking of the Vessels\" or \"the death of the Kings.\" The vessels of containment belonging to the three Super- nal Sephiroth were sturdy enough to receive the Divine Light issuing into them, but the force of the Light was unstable and lacked direction. When the Light struck the next six spheres from Chesed to Yesod, it did so with such potency that the vessels shattered one by one, sending fragments falling. The vessel of Malkuth also cracked but did not shatter. Some of the Light returned to its source, but the remainder of it was pro- pelled down along with the broken vessels. The shattered pieces of the vessels became the Qlippoth and the origins of gross matter. The Light which was trapped by the Qlippoth, supplied the lifeforce and substance for the Qlippotic realm, which affected all but the Supernal realms after the breaking of the Vessels. One of the most serious consequences of the devastating pressure of the Light shattering the Vessels was that every level of World below the Supernals dropped downward from its normal location. (The death of the Edomite kings in Genesis is said to refer to the breaking of the Vessels and their consequent fall to a lower level.) Nothing was to remain in its proper position. The World of Assiah, the Active World has plunged into and intermingled with the lowest abodes of the Qlippoth. The universal process became at odds with its former order. One of the explanations as to why the Vessels shattered is that in this stage of Tohu, the primitive Sephiroth could receive the Light of the Divine as Vessels, but being simple points of emanation, they could neither give back Light nor interact with each other. In this way, they could not resemble the Divine and con- sequently were incomplete. Thus they were unable to hold the Light of the Divine, were overwhelmed by the Light, and shattered. The reason that these unstable Vessels were created in the first place (according to Lurianic tradition) was so that Evil should come into being ..This would supply humanity with the freedom to choose; something which is prerequisite for the restoration of the Vessels. In addi- tion, because Evil emanated from the first and highest of the Vessels, it can be reconstructed and restored to this level. PARTZUFIM (C1~Jmt~~): There is a teaching in the Zoha» (or Qabalistic Book of Splen- dor) that divides the Sephiroth into five archetypal countenances. The word partzufim"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"Adam Kadmon, The Bodyof God 520"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade 521 means \"faces\" (singular-partzuj). It refers to five forces or archetypal personas which take the place of the Sephiroth as the primary manifestations of Adam Kad- mon after the \"Breaking of the Vessels.\" After the \"Breaking,\" the Vessels were then reconstructed and rebuilt into the \"Faces.\" This constituted the Universe of Rectifica- tion which replaced the Universe of Chaos. The Partzufim include Arik Anpin, Abba, Aima, Zauir Anpin and Nukba de-Zauir (also known as Malkah).122 These five points are centers of force through which the creative energy of the Divine is able to operate and manifest. These five also establish the final form of Adam Kadmon after the Breaking of the Vessels-a form that is very different from the figure of the \"arche- typal man\" that existed prior to the Fall. The partzufim constitute the World of Atzi- luth, which is reflected into the three lower Worlds. Most importantly, the partzufim were strong enough to contain the Light which had shattered the previous Vessels. They were able to both give and to receive Light. These \"faces\" resembled humanity and were able to interact with each other in an anthropomorphic fashion. ARIK ANPIN (t&~M '~'M): meaning the \"Vast Countenance\" or the \"Greater Countenance\" (literally \"long faced\"). Also known as Macroprosopus. One of the titles of Kether. Other titles of Kether include Aatik Yomin <r~~'~ '~l\"lV), the \"Ancient of Days,\" and Aatik Qadosh (f:,'i' '~l\"lV), \"the Holy Ancient One.\" ABBA (M~~M): Kether or the Vast Countenance emanates first as Abba the Super- nal Father, and Aima, the Supernal Mother. Abba the Supernal Father is referred to the Hebrew letter Yod of Tetragrammaton. Abba is associated with the Sephi- rah Chokmah. AlMA (M~~M): The Supernal Mother, Aima, is referred to the letter Heh. Aima is attributed to the Sephirah of Binah. Abba and Aima function as a dual potential. They perform as models of differentiation which divide all emanations into either active or passive, stimulating or receiving, masculine or feminine. Elohim is a name given to these two beings united. ZAUIR ANPIN (r~&~M '~V'): Literally \"short faced.\" Also called Microprosopus or the Lesser Countenance. Zauir Anpin is the son of the Elohim, Abba and Aima, The son represents a \"birth\" into the lower worlds of manifestation below the Super- nals. Zauir Anpin corresponds to the six Sephiroth of Chesed, Geburah, Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod, and Yesod; and of these especially to Tiphareth. It is also associated with the letter Vav of Tetragrammaton. This partzuf is central to the process of restoring the Tree of Life to its original state before the Fall. NUKBA DE-ZAUIR ('~V\" M~i'~): Literally the \"Female of Zauir,\" This partzuf symbolized the female counterpart of Zauir Anpin. Additional titles of this \"face\" include Malkah and Kalah: MALKAH (M~~~)\"the Queen\" and KALAH (M~:l) \"the Bride.\" These are titles of the Sephirah Malkuth, which is considered the spouse of the Microprosopus. It is also referred to Heh Sophith of Tetragrammaton. 122 Some sources refer to a total of seven Partzufim, including two which are referred to the upper level of Kether, Aatik Qadosh and Aatik Yomin; while Arik Anpin is sometimes considered the lower part of Kether."},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"The Partzufim 522"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade 523 TIKKUN (7'i'l'1): which means \"redemption\" is the restoration of the universe to its primal purity and design-it is the correction of the confusion and chaos that was the outcome of the breaking of the Vessels. The creation of the partzufim (faces) which introduced a new pattern of dynamics to the Tree of Life, is a part of the process of tikkun, a process of cleansing and reconstruction of the Tree. The Divine Light from Atziluth (the world of the partzufim) is passed down into the other worlds and altered or filtered as it descends. The full potency of the Light is modi- fied on its descent. Thus the process of tikkun is commenced, but it can only be completed by humanity. The human task is to restore the system of the Tree of Life by restoring the World of Assiah, the physical world, to its original state of spiritu- ality-to remove it from the realm of the Qlippoth and permit a state of ultimate unity to exist between every being and the Divine, uninterrupted by the Qlippoth. This task is an inner spiritual cleansing which every human being must strive for. Qabalistic Correspondences The Secret Names of the Four Qabalistic Worlds were given in Chapter Two. These names are based upon numerical correspondences: Atziluth-Ab (~V)-72, Briah-Seg (~C)-63, Yetzirah-Mah (MQ)-45, Assiah-Ben (~~)-52. These four realms are ones that eventually manifest in the four letters of the Name, in the four lower \"faces\" of Atziluth in the body of Adam Kadmon, and finally, in the Four Worlds themselves. The Letter Tau: In each of the Four Worlds are the Ten Sephiroth of that World, and each Sephirah has its own ten Sephiroth, making 400 Sephiroth in all-the number of the Hebrew letter Tau, the cross, the universe, the completion of all things. (This helps to explain why the Zelator grade is referred to Malkuth of Malkuth, and Theoricus to Yesod of Malkuth, etc.) The Seven Palaces: The ten Sephiroth are combined into what are known as the Seven Palaces (Sheva Hekhaloth) of Briah. The First Palace contains the Three Supernal Sephiroth. The Second Palace consists of Chesed, the Third-Geburah, the Fourth- Tiphareth, the Fifth-Netzach, the Sixth-Hod, and the Seventh con- tains Yesod and Malkuth. By assigning the ten Sephiroth to Seven Palaces, the energies of the Sephiroth may be differentiated along the lines of Planetary ener- gies, since the Seven Palaces correspond to the Seven Planets of the ancients. This can be likened to the Macrocosmic Hexagram whose uppermost point is assigned to Saturn (or the Supemals of the First Palace which are generally grouped together and symbolized by the sphere of Binah reflected through Daath). The low- est point of the Hexagram is attributed to Luna (or the Seventh Palace containing Yesod and Malkuth). The Seven Palaces also correspond to the Tree of the Knowledge of Good. and of Evil, for upper seven branches relate to the Seven Heavens in Assiah, and the lower seven branches refer to the Seven Qlippotic Palaces.

And he set it on a pole-that is, twined it round the Mid- dle Pillar of the Sephiroth. And the word used in the passage in V Numbers 21 for \"Fiery Serpents\" is the same as the Name of the Angels of Geburah, the same spelling, the same pointing, Seraphim. Round the Middle Pillar of the Sephiroth, because that The Macrocosmic is the Reconciler between the Fires of Geburah or Severity, and Hexagram the Waters of Chesed or Mercy-and hence it is said in the New Testament that it is a type of Christ, the Reconciler. And the Serpent is of Brass, the Metal of Venus, whose sphere is called Nogah, or External Splendor, as shown further by the Alchemical Symbol of Venus, wherein the Circle of the Sun is exalted above the Cross of Corrosion. And therefore it is said in the Zohar that\" Alone of the Shells is the Serpent Nogah found in Holiness\" and he is called the Balance of Justice. Why, then, is he called the External or False Splendor? Becausehe indeed uniteth the Paths, but comprehendeth not the Sephiroth. Nevertheless, he is also the Celestial Serpent of Wisdom. But the Serpent of the Temptation is the Serpent of the Tree of Knowl- edge of Good and of Evil, and not that of the Tree of Life. The Celestial Serpent is green and gold, colors which indicate growth and vegetation. Its antithesis is the stooping dragon or serpent of the Qlippoth which is red, the color of destruction. The Hexagram of Tiphareth: The formation of the Macrocosmic Hexagram is from the pillars on each side of the Tree of Life. (See the Diagram of the Tablet of Three Columns.) The Water triangle is from the side of Chesed, while the Fire tri- angle is from the side of Geburah. In Tiphareth, these two triangles are combined and reconciled in the figure of the Hexagram. Just as the Hebrew letter Aleph is the reconciling force between Mem (Water) and Shin (Fire), the central pillar of the Tree stands, unites and mediates between the pillars of Fire and Cloud (the pillars of Jachin and Boaz of King Solomon's temple). The Brazen Sea: The Brazen Sea which stood in the courtyard of Solomon's temple was a total of ten cubits in diameter, alluding to the ten Sephiroth, and 5 cubits in height, a reference to the Hebrew letter Heh. Its curcumference was 30 cubits-the number of the Sephiroth multiplied by the Triad. Beneath the rim of the vessel were 300 knobs or rounded protrusions, referring to the number of the letter Shin (spirit) and the name of Ruach Elohim, the Spirit of God. It stood upon 12 oxen, representing the 12 Signs of the Zodiac, and the 12 stars upon the crown of Aima Elohim, the Great Mother. The whole of it is a synthesis of Binah, con- taining the Waters of Creation. The Image of Nebuchadnezzar: Representing the prophetic dream of the Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar.

It is a divine name of 216 letters derived from the Book of Exodus 14:19-21. Each of these three verses from Exodus contains seventy-two letters which are then organized (by bous- trophedon) to generate the seventy-two syllables of the Name. In due time the Shem Ha-Mephoresh was condensed into the letters of the Tetragrammaton. The verses involved read as follows: 19th Verse: And the Angel of the Elohim, that went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them and stood behind them. 20th Verse: And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it wasa cloud and darkness (to thefirst) but it gavelight by night (to these); and the one came not near unto the other all the night. 21st Verse: And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the Lord drove back the sea with a strongeastwind all that night and made the sea dry land, and the waters divided. The names are obtained by writing these three verses in Hebrew with alternating lines in opposing directions. In other words, the verses are to be writ- ten out one above the other, the first verse from right to left, the second verse from left to right, and the third from right to left. 123 The result is seventy-two columns of three letters apiece. The seventy-two names are thought of as expansions of YHVH; they are separated under four groupings of eighteen letters. Each group (read from top to bottom) corresponds to one of the letters of Tetragrammaton: In assigning the decanates of the Zodiac to the names of the Shem Ha- Mephoresh (as well as the Tarot) the Golden Dawn system assigns the first decanate to the Sign of Leo. Thus in the list that follows, the first column of names derived from the three verses of Exodus is to be found in the grouping of HEH (Water) under the Sign of Leo. The reason for this is explained in a paper by Math- ers entitled liThe Tree of Life as Projected in a Solid Sphere.\" 124 123 It is also possible to construct 72 such Names out of the three required verses by writing them all in the same direction, or by using any of the methods described by Temurah. However, the mean- ings of the Names as derived from the Psalms remain the same. 124 \"Another very important difference is that, throughout the true Tarot, the teaching assigns the commencing Point of the Zodiac to the bright Star \"Regulus\" which is in Leo. And it measures Right Ascension and Longitude from that point, and not from a suppositious point divided by the Equinox and called the 0 0 of Aries (though in reality now far removed from the constellation of that name), which has been adopted by modem or Western Astronomy and Astrology.

From the seventy-two names of the deity, seventy-two Angels bearing these divine names are formed by adding the suffix Yod Heh (M~-iah) or the suffix Aleph Lamed (~M-al) to the end of the Name. Iah signifies mercy and beneficence, whereas al embodies severity and judgment. Each deity Name contains three letters,125 while each Angelic Name formed therefrom has five letters. Each of these Angels also rules over one of the seventy-two quinances (or sets of SO divisions) of the Zodiac. Two quinances are contained in each decanate (or sets of 100 divisions) of a Zodiacal Sign, therefore each of the Signs has six of these Angelic names associated with it. The number seventy-two is also equal to the total number of Zodiacal Signs (twelve) multiplied by the number six, the number of Angels assigned to each Sign. Thus each sign and its corresponding Angelic names can be symbolized in the form of a hexagram. (Each angle of the hexagram represents one of the Angelic names, while the sigil of the Sign itself is to be placed in the center.) The wheel of the Zodiac is equal to 360 0 . This number divided by five yields 72 0 which is the angle of degrees that exist between each point of a pentagram. These seventy-two Angels are divided into groups of nine sets of eight, each associated with one of the nine choirs of Angels of the Sephiroth.Pi These Angels are also grouped under the four Elemental divisions of the Tetragrammaton. The first three Signs beginning with Kerubic Fire (Leo, VIrgo, Libra) are referred to Yod-Fire. The second triad of Signs (Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn) falls under the Presi- dency of Heh-Water. The third division (Aquarius, Pisces, Aries) is allotted to Vav-Air. The final three Signs (Taurus, Gemini, Cancer) are referred to Heh each decade of years shows them slowly but surely receding. But the Tarot method of reckoning from the star named Regulus has, it will be seen, the effect of making the Signs and the Constalla- tions coincide. Regulus is also named Cor Leonis-'The Heart of the Lion.' Regulus means 'Star of the Prince.' Regulus coincides with the position of the heart in the figure of Leo upon the Star Maps.\"- from a paper by MacGregor Mathers published in The Golden Dawn by Israel Regardie. This shows that much of the esoteric Astrology taught in the Golden Dawn is based on a fixed Sidereal rather than Tropical Astrology. There is evidence to support the view that in parts of ancient Egypt, this Astrological method (beginning with 00 Leo) was employed. 125 It should be noted that Gimel (3) is the only letter not used in the Shem Ha-Mephoresh. 126 Minus the Choir of Angels associated with Kether."},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"26 19 20 11 14 17 10 12 13 15 16 18 .n.

Nusku's symbol was a lamp shaped like a wooden clog. He represented the sacred Fire which consumed offerings made to the gods and made possible the burning of the sacred incense. Invoked during sacrifices, Nusku was also known as \"Bel's sublime messenger.\" GIBIL was another Fire god who together with Nusku sometimes dispensed justice upon the wicked in the form of a purging Fire. Gibil was often invoked by sorcerers who wished to destroy their enemies. A variation of this god is BILKAN, who might have some con- nection with the Biblical Tubal Cain and the Roman god Vulcan. He was a potent Fire deity who was invoked often in spells. SEKHET (or SEKHMET): An Egyptian goddess of war and bat- tle. Her name means \"the powerful.\" She is represented as a woman with the head of a lioness and she was known as \"the beloved of Ptah.\" Sekhet personified the burning, Fiery and destructive heat of the sun in late summer. Sekhet and the god- dess Bast worked together to destroy the enemies of the Sun god Re. Her lust for bat- tle was so extreme that Re had to restrain her from killing off the human race. BAST: An Egyptian Fire goddess who symbolized the mild heat of early summer which encouraged the growth of vegetation and the germination of seeds. She was originally depicted as a woman with the greenish head of a lioness, but later she was portrayed as cat-headed. The goddess holds in her right-hand a sistrum and in her left hand a basket. Although she was associated with Sekhet as a fiery defender of Re, the sun god, she later became associated with the Moon and with the ideas of pleasure, music and dance. Joyous festivals were held in her honor. HERU-BEHUTET: One of the most important forms of Horus (many of which are associated with Fire and heat.) Heru-Behutet personified the most powerful heat of the sun at midday. Usually depicted as a man with the head of a hawk and car- rying a club or spear, this god has sometimes been portrayed as a lion or lion-headed. He was the warrior god who battled the evil god Set or Typhon, slayer of Osiris. Called \"smiter of the rebel,\" Heru-Behutet symbolizes the power which dispels evil and darkness and fills the world with brilliant Light. MONT (or MENTHU): A Solar war god of Egypt who symbol- ized the destructive heat of the Sun. Mont is generally represented as man with a hawk's (or a bull's) head surmounted by the Solar disk and two tall plumes. His attributes are the khepesh or curved sword used to vanquish the enemies of the Pharaoh. Mont was the supreme Solar god until he was\" demoted\" to second in rank by the god Amon.

(The Greeks identified this god ~ with Hephaestus and the Romans equated him with Vulcan.) Ptah is the great architect of the universe-designer of heaven and Earth. He is usually portrayed as a bearded balding man who wears a tight headband, and is clothed in a close-fitting garment or Bennu mummy-wrappings. From an opening in his garment his two hands project to grasp a phoenix scepter, an ankh and a Djed wand. The BENNU bird was the Egyptian version of the phoenix, which was sacred to Osiris. The Bennu was said to have created itself out of the Fire that burned on the summit of the sacred Persea Tree of Heliopolis. Once every five hundred years the Bennu made its appearance bearing the body of his father in an egg of myrrh to the temple of the Sun to be buried. Resembling a heron, the Bennu's plumage was colored gold and red. HEPHAESTUS (Equivalent to the Roman Vulcan): The Greek god of terrestrial Fire. The son of Hera and Zeus, his name is derived from a Greek word meaning \"hearth\" or \"Kindle.\" The Element that this god represents is not the destroying Fire, but the beneficial Fire that permits humans to smelt metal and advance civilization. Like the Egyptian Ptah, Hephaestus is the divine blacksmith, the artisan who taught humans the mechanical arts and built the divine palaces of Olympus. The god appears as a powerful bearded smith who is lame in both legs. He is depicted wearing a short sleeveless chiton and holding a hammer and thongs, often working by flaming furnaces and pounding out metal on an enormous anvil. The metal-working companions of Hephaes- tus were a variety of subterranean Fire genii, which included the Cyclopes and Dactyls. Hephaestus PROMETHEUS: The Greek Titan who stole sacred Fire from the forges of Hephaestus to give to the human race. (An angry Zeus had ordered Fire withheld from humankind.) For this crime Zeus had the Titan chained to a mountain crest where every day a vulture would feast upon his liver, which grew back every night. After many years of defiant suffering he was res- cued by the hero Hercules. Prometheus was regarded by the Athenians as the father of the arts and sciences. HESTIA (Equivalent to the Roman Vesta): The Greek goddess of the hearth-fire of the household-Fire which is benevolent and helpful to humankind. Considered the oldest of the Olympian gods, Hestia was venerated in all of Greece, and the Fire of the hestia or public hearth was used in sacrifices.c Hestia"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade 537 SECTION 5: Correspondences of Venus The Planet attributed to the Philosophus grade is Venus. Venus rules attractions, social interactions, partners, marriages, unions, aesthetics, cultural pursuits, the emotions associated with natural love, beauty, sensuality, the creative arts, and adornments. Venus governs the nonrational emotive part of the human mind as well as that part of us that wishes to socialize with others and express our creativity and affections. It is the \"right-brain\" portion that seeks to sing/ dance, act, paint and express things that words cannot express. The energy of Venus is mild and harmonious. The Planet Venus takes 224.5 days to complete one orbit of the Sun/ and it is never located more than 46 0 from the Sun. Venus is the Morning and Evening Star It is considered feminine and a \"fruitful\" or benefic Planet. In an Astrological sense, Venus is said to be \"warm.\" The ancients described Venus as the ruler of the period of life dominated by emotion from the ages 15 to 22. In human anatomy, this Planet rules the throat, the kidneys, internal reproductive organs, the venous blood circulation, and the skin.

A complex goddess of many functions, Ishtar was the supreme god- dess of the Heavens. Self-proclaimed \"goddess of the mom and goddess of the Evening,\" Ishtar was both a divinity of love and of war. (Worshiped as the daughter of the Moon god, Sin, Ishtar was perceived as a goddess of war, but seen as the daughter of Anu, the sky, she fulfilled her role as the goddess of love.) The warrior goddess Ishtar, as venerated especially by the Assyrians was the \"Lady of Battles, valiant among goddesses.\" In this form Ishtar she is depicted standing in a chariot pulled by seven lions, and holding a bow or a lion-headed club. Her sister is Ereshkigal, dark queen of the Underworld. Ishtar as the goddess of love controlled the power to arouse desire and the ability to procreate in all creatures. She was \"courtesan to the gods\" and sacred pros- titution formed an important part of her cult. Although she often displayed her kindness, she was also regularly cruel to her many lovers, and her affections were sometimes fatal. Her love for the harvest god Tammuz, caused his death. In her grief, she journeyed into the Underworld to find Tammuz, only to become Ereshki- gal's prisoner. Eventually she was freed with a powerful magic spell by the god Ea. Ishtar is usually portrayed wearing a triple-homed crown and clothed in flowing golden robes. Her necklace and bracelets are made of lapis lazuli. HATHOR: A sky goddess who became associated with the morning and evening star because the Sun god resided within her breast, enclosed every night within the body of Hathor, to be born anew each morning. She was revered as the god- dess of love, joy, and merriment, and was the mistress of dance and music. Her temple was the home of intoxication and a place of enjoyment. Hathor was some- times represented as the great celestial cow, whose milk nourished the young Horus. More often she is depicted as a cow-headed woman, or a woman with cow's ears, sometimes crowned with horns and the Solar disk. The sistrum, a musical instrument used to drive away evil Spirits, is Hathor's special imple- ment-and is usually engraved with her image. BES: Egyptian god of marriage, merriment and the adornment of women. Of Semetic or African origin, Bes is represented as a robust dwarf with a large head, hairy cheeks and protruding tongue. He wears a headdress of ostrich feathers, and around his body the skin of a leopard. Bes is known as the god of music, dance, pleasure and amusement. He delights in playing the harp and entertaining the gods with his jovial antics and contortions. QETESH: A Semtic/Egyptian goddess of love and beauty, who is another form of Hathor.

Aphrodite Genetrix was the goddess of marriage. Aphrodite Pandemos was the goddess of lust and mistress of prostitutes. In legend, Aphrodite was born out of the sea, from the foam of the severed genitalia of Uranus. All of the gods were struck by her beauty and grace, for the goddess emitted an aura of seduction and charm. She owned a magic girdle which was endowed with the power of enslaving the hearts of mortals and immortals alike. Aphrodite often delighted in arousing the amorous pas- sions of the gods and sending them chasing after mortals. Protectress of legitimate unions between men and women, the normally benign goddess could punish her enemies by driving them mad with passion. Companions of the god- dess included the child god Eros (Cupid) and the three Graces whose presence gladdened the hearts of humanity. Although she was the wife of the deformed god Hephaes- tus, her lovers were many, including the god of war, Ares. Aphrodite is usually portrayed as a voluptuous woman partially draped with a robe or nude. DIONYSUS: A complex Greek god who became known as the god of wine, pleasure and the forces of life. Called \"the deliverer of men from their cares,\" Dionysus is depicted as a youth crowned with vine leaves and grapes and robed in the skin of a panther. In one hand he bears a cup of wine and in the other a thyrsus staff surmounted by a pine cone. The god is often accompanied in his travels by a band of satyrs, centaurs, maenids, nymphs and sileni. The festivals of Dionysus were marked by frenzied activity, orgies, dancing, music and pleasure. Later the god acquired the more mystical aspects of death and resurrection, thus becoming a symbol of the forces of life. FREYA (or FRIGG): Teutonic goddess of love and fertility.

Thus from an excess of energy the Qlippoth came into being. The Broken Vessels were still open to the process of reconstruction, but their \"shells\" which are the equivalent of waste by-products, were not affected. It was in this manner that the Qlippoth in their most strict definition as the forces of corruption and evil began-(as god's garbage heap). The Qlippoth are a group of ten chaotic and imbalanced Sephiroth, which are the direct opposites of the harmonious spheres of the Tree of Life, and thus they form a second Tree which is called evil. They are simply the destructive and unequilibrated aspects of the Sephiroth. Gust as every Sephirah is said to have a \"virtue\" there is a corresponding \"vice. \") The Qlippotic Tree is usually repre- sented as a mirror image of the Tree of Life, reflected from the base of Malkuth. The tenth Sephirah is said to be \"fallen\" because after the Fall when the Vessels were broken, Malkuth descended and came to rest upon the Kingdom of Shells (the Qlippoth), which is why their influence is so potent in the world of humanity. And just as they were formed from an excess of unstable energy, their power is connected with all forms of overindulgence and excess-imbalance in general. Whereas as the Sephiroth symbolize progressive evolution and spiritual reunion with the Divine, the Qlippoth represent de-evolution and spiritual disintegration. In the same manner as the figure of the upright pentagram (with the Spirit point on top) is utilized to symbolize the balanced forces of the Sephiroth and the Elements, the inverted pentagram is used to indicate the unbalanced or Qlippotic forces (Spirit inverted). The ten averse and evil Sephiroth of the Qlippoth are also collected into the Seven Evil Palaces (the great red dragon, Leviathan of the Qlippoth with seven heads and ten horns). The Infernal Order of the Qlippoth corresponds somewhat to the various Angelic Orders. Samael is said to surround the whole of the Evil Sephi- roth, thus making eleven instead of ten.

Qabalistically, the entire process of Alchemy can be explained as the cleansing and purifying of Malkuth in order to purge it from the influence of the shells and return it to its rightful spiritual origins. The practicing Alchemist uses a variety of implements to aid in his work. These include the following items: ALUDEL (or SUBLIMINATORY): A gourd-shaped clay pot which was constructed so that a series of such vessels could be built up, one on top of the other, to a height of five or six feet. Used for sublimation, the bottom pot was placed on a stove. The vapors that rose during the heating process, condensed on the inside of the upper vessels, and were removed later by scraping. ALEMBIC: A container which was used for distillation. Its shape was said to resemble a dancing bear. In early days the alembic was made of two pieces with a removable head. Later alembics of glass were sometimes made in one piece. The receiver, a globular glass vessel, was fitted over the open end of the alembic's tube in order to catch the distillate. ATHANOR: A forge or oven known as the Philosophical Furnace which is used to produce a graduated heat. Approximately five feet in height, the oven was con- structed so that it could be divided into various parts, of which the bottom portion contained a small fireplace for providing a uniform heat. Used for digestion and evaporation of certain liquids. The Athanor contains the glass vessel (egg-shaped) which lies in a sand bath or ash-pit just above the fire. A symbol of the human being. (In sexual symbolism, a penis or active masculine force.) 128 In the early days of the Order, some Alchemical references taken from a text known as the Aesh Metzareph (\"Purifying Fire\") were included in the Knowledge Lectures of the Outer Order. The Aesh Metzareph was originally written in Hebrew, translated into Latin sometime later, and included in the book Cabala Denudata by Knorr von Rosenroth. (The original is thought to be lost.) The Aesh Met- zareph is significant only in that it is the source of the most awful and pointless of the Alchemical cor- respondences in the Outer Order Knowledge Lectures.

The Circle denotes Sun and Gold; the Cres- cent the Moon and Silver, respectively analogous to the Red and White Alchemi- cal natures. The Cross is the symbol of corrosion. The corrosion of metals is usually of the complementary color to that to which they naturally approximate. Thus Copper, which is reddish, becomes green in its corrosion of verdigris, etc. Mercury is the only Planet which unites these three primary forms in one symbol. Saturn is composed of the cross and the crescent showing that Lead is cor- rosive internally and Luna externally. Jupiter is the reverse. Mars is Solar exter- nally but corrosive externally. Venus is opposite. Copper is externally of the nature of Gold, but inter- nally corrosive. Hence the name of the sphere of Venus is Nogah-denoting Exter- nal Splendor but internal corruption.e SECTION 8: Admission Badges and Diagrams The Calvary Cross of Twelve Squres is the Admission Badge to the Path of Qoph. It is formed of twelve squares which fitly represent the Zodiac which embraces the Waters of Nu as the ancient Egyptians called the Heavens (the Waters which are above the Firmament). It also alludes to the eternal river of Eden, divided into four heads which find their correlations in the four triplicities of the Zodiac. 129 From Regardie's The Golden Dawn."},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"8 ~ ~ <u ..s:: - 5 ~ G @ :5- ;:t Vl \"S- ] ® ~ Vl <u t:; @ ~ ~ l! - I:: c ~ @ ~ ~ \"S- o ,.Q ~ Vl ~ 550"},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade 551 The great river is called Naher, which flows out of Eden, namely from the Supernal Triad. At Daath, it is divided into four heads. The first river is called Pison, the river of Fire, which flows into Geburah. Second is the river Gihon, the river of the Waters which flows into Chesed. The third is Hiddikel, the river of Air, flowing into Tiphareth, and the fourth, which receives the virtues of the other three, is Phrath (Euphrates), which flows down upon the Earth. Cancer, the Cardinal Sign of Water is placed at the junction of the cross (and of the four rivers). All the Cardinal and Mutable Signs are placed in alternating posi- tions on the central shaft of the cross, beginning with Aries and ending with Pisces. The cross bar is composed of the Kerubic Signs. The Pyramid of the Four Elements is the Admission Badge for the 28th Path of Tzaddi. On the four triangles which comprise the sides of this Badge are the Hebrew names of the four Elements: Asch-Fire, Maim-Water, Ruach-Air, and Aretz-Earth. On the apex of the Badge is the word Eth, composed of the first and last letter of the Hebrew alphabet and implying essence or Spirit. The square base represents the material universe and on it is the word Olam meaning \"World.\" The word \"pyramid\" is derived from a root word which means \"Fire,\" sig- nifying that it is the symbolic representation of the one divine Flame. A pyramid can easily be likened to the \"Mountain of God,\" which was believed to stand in the center of the Earth. The four sides of the pyramid are triangular to represent the threefold aspect of the Divine enthroned within every aspect of the fourfold universe. The square base is a reminder that the structure is firmly based on the immutable laws of nature. The truncated pyramid shows the essence of the Divine firmly planted at the top of the design. It, too, is a square to indicate that the four- fold model of the cosmos begins with the Tetragrammaton. The Calvary Cross ofTen Squares is the Admission Badge to the 27th Path of Peh. It is formed of ten squares which fitly represent the ten Sephiroth in balanced disposition, before which the Formless and the Void rolled back. It is also the opened out form of the Double Cube and of the Altar of Incense. (The Altar of Incense before the Veil of the Holy of Holies, was overlaid with gold to represent the highest purity.) This alludes to the path of Peh as a vehicle of purification, where the Microcosm of man (represented by the ten Sephiroth) learns to separate the pure from the impure in order to become a perfect mirror of the greater Tree, the Macrocosm of the universe. The Cross of the Hegemon's Badge grants the candidate entry into the temple of Netzach. The Calvary Cross of Six Squares embraces Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod and Yesod, and rests upon Malkuth. Also, the Calvary Cross of Six Squares is the opened-out form of the cube, and is thus referred to the Six Sephiroth of Micro- prosopus which are Chesed, Geburah, Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod, and Yesod. This Badge is given to the Philosophus to emphasize the balance that must be attained in the 4 = 7 grade between the energies of Water and Fire, emotions and intellect.

This diagram is described in the Philosophus Ritual. It shows in a glyph the teaching proper to a Philoso- phus on entering the Sephirah Netzach which s/he has reached by the Three Paths of Qoph, Tzaddi, and Peh from the Sephiroth-Malkuth, Yesod and Hod respectively. The great goddess Eve, being tempted by the fruits of the Tree of Knowledge whose branches tend upwards to the seven lower Sephiroth, but also downward to the Kingdom of Shells, reached down to them and the two pillars were left unsupported. Then the Sephirotic Tree was shattered. She fell and with her fell the great Adam. And the great red Dragon arose with his seven heads and ten horns, and Eden was desolated-and the folds of the Dragon enclosed Malkuth and linked it to the Kingdom of the Shells. And the heads of the Dragon rose into the seven lower Sephiroth, even up to Daath at the feet of Aima Elohim. Thus were the four Rivers of Eden desecrated and the Dragon's mouth gave forth the Infernal Waters in Daath-and this is Leviathan, The Piercing and Crooked Serpent. But Tetragrammaton Elohim placed the four letters YHVH of the Name and the Flaming Sword of the Ten Sephiroth between the devastated Garden and the Super- nal Eden, that this should not be involved in the Fall of Adam. And it became necessary that a Second Adam should arise to restore the Sys- tem, and thus, as Adam had been spread on the Cross of the Four Rivers, so the Sec- ond Adam should be crucified on the Infernal Rivers of the four armed Cross of Death-yet to do this he must descend into the lowest, even Malkuth, the Earth, and be born of her. (Psalm 74. \"Thou breakest the Heads of Leviathan in pieces.\") And on the Dragon Heads were the names of the eight Kings of Edom and on his horns the names of the Eleven Dukes of Edom, for Daath having developed in the Dragon a new Head, the Seven Headed Dragon with Ten Horns became Eight Headed and Eleven Horned. (Genesis, 36 31 to 43. Chronicles 1.43 to 54.) NOTE: The Edomites were the descendants of Esau who sold his birthright. Their Kings came to symbolize unlawful and chaotic forces. This diagram is somewhat similar to the one encountered in the preced- ing grade. The previous drawing portrayed the tranquillity of the Garden as in the grade of Water, while this one depicts the calamity within Eden caused by the power of imbalance. The red dragon has awakened and its heads ascend the Tree to Daath. The Lower Self (symbolized by Eve) was lured downwards by the Tree of Knowledge to grasp the fruits of Knowledge. The cause of the problem, however, was an undeveloped understanding of creative power. Thus the Lower Self became entranced by the power of the awakening psyche, and momentarily suspended its"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade 555 support of the Higher Self (symbolized by Adamj.P? She has in a sense stooped down into that \"darkly splendid world\" which was forewarned against in the pre- vious grade. Yet the Fall is only a disaster from a single point of view. The knowledge derived from the waking dragon gave humanity consciousness and the awareness of power, which is the ability to evolve spiritually. Leviathan is in fact an emblem of a great obstacle which must be overcome. As all such impediments are designed to strengthen us, the dragon also represents the ultimate success of sur- mounting these difficulties at the end of the equilibration process. The Garden of Eden after the Fall is equivalent to a state of consciousness often called \"the Dark Night of the Soul.\" This is usually followed by a sense of despair wherein the powers of the Soul seem numbed and the mind wants to shut itself off against the discipline and practice of the Great Work. Numerous tempta- tions to cease the Work will present themselves, attempting to entice the initiate away from his/her spiritual goal. At times the aspirant may feel as if the mind is becoming unbalanced, and that it would be best to cease all magical work. (The Alchemists symbolized this state of mind with a venomous dragon.) However, if the initiate persists and bears up through this unpleasant condition, it will even- tually fade and be replaced by a higher state of spiritual awareness. The ascent of Leviathan into Daath (knowledge) signifies an overflowing of subconscious archetypes into the individual psyche, which can be highly unset- tling until they are absorbed and balanced out within the consciousness of the aspirant. Daath is the passageway between the Supernals (the Divine Self) and the lower parts of the Tree (the lower parts of the Self) through which Wisdom and Understanding are transmuted into knowledge through experience. Thus the Fall of Paradise, when the heads of the dragon reached up into Daath, refers to a pro- curement of self-knowledge. Daath is a connecting link between the tranquillity of the Divine Self and the human self confined to the realm of matter and delusion. In the Macrocosmic view, the Fall from Eden represents an event in humanity's distant past when the collective psyche of our primitive race was stim- ulated and the beginnings of intelligence and self-awareness developed. In the Microcosmic view this process is repeated through the stimulation of the psychic Elements within the mind of the initiate. The routine activities of daily living, amplified by a spiritual focus (along with the arousal of the sphere of Daath) bring calamity at the outset because the revitalized psyche is usually misunderstood and misused for private gain. However, it is only through this state of calamity, where the initiate is forced to face these obstacles rather than pushing them to the back of the mind, that s/he can actually perceive and overcome the hidden causes of the distress. This is in fact the beginnings of real spiritual growth and aware- ness. So long as the necessary equilibrium is avoided, and the self-consciousness conferred upon the aspirant is abused for personal ends alone, then the serpent 130 This continues to be a problem for magicians today who get sidetracked from the goal of the Great Work into an obsessed fascination with their own magical abilities. When this occurs however, the Higher Powers usually respond with a swift kick in the pants as an \"attitude adjustment\" against ego inflation."},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"556 SELF-INIT1ATION INlO 1HE GoLDEN DAWN 'fRAomoN Leviathan shall be relentless in its attack upon the self. Conquering this obstacle does not require suppressing or denying its existence-rather it entails acceptance of the dragon and forcing it back to its appropriate abode. The various levels of the initiate's personal Tree, separated from its Supernal origins are to be reinte- grated and the colossal forces of the Dark side of one's psyche are to be trained like the lion in the Tarot card of Strength; a mighty beast which has been tamed and kept always under the firm control of the Higher Will.¢ SECTION 9: The Greek Alphabet Q The Greek alphabet is another magical set of building blocks that is very important to the mystical tradition of the West. Greek became a wide-spread language of the known (Western) world at a time when the culture of Egypt was becoming \"Hellenized.\" This ancient tongue was the language of all the archaic mystery cults, including those of Samothrace, Eleusis, Orpheus, and the Hell- enized rites of Isis and Serapis. Many mystical texts including the Magical Papyri, the New Testament, the Gnostic books and the writings of Hermes Trismegistus were written in Greek. And in the Golden Dawn, the names of the grades and the officiating officers themselves are Greek, in keeping with those earlier mystic rites at Delphi, Athens and Alexandria. It is therefore quite appropriate to include the study of the Greek alphabet in the Outer Order. Like Hebrew, the letters of the Greek alphabet were assigned to different numeral values. This \"Greek Gematria\" is called Isopsephos which means \"equal stones.\" Isopsephos is similar to Gematria in that words that added up to the same numeral value were considered to be related. (Some of the obscure numerical pas- sages in the New Testment, including those in the Book of Revelations, were undoubtedly a result of Isopsephos. The most widely used system of assigning numbers to the Greek letters originated around 400 B.C. and is based on the Hebrew system. Both the upper and lower case forms of these letters are shown on the following page."},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade 557 Letter Name Value English Equivalent Au Alpha 1 A (father) B13 Beta 2 B ry Gamma 3 G L\\8 Delta 4 D EE Epsilon 5 short e (better) Ze; Zeta 7 Zd(wisdom) Hll Eta 8 long e (pair) 88 Theta 9 Th (cathouse) It Iota 10 I (either feet or fit) KK Kappa 20 K AA Lambda 30 L MJl Mu 40 M Nv Nu 50 N B~ Xi 60 X 00 Omicron 70 short 0 (hot) I11t Pi 80 P Pp Rho 100 R, Rh (always trilled) La Sigma 200 S (z if before B, r, A, or M) Tr Tau 300 T Yu Upsilon 400 U (long or short) <1>~ Phi 500 Ph (mophead) Xx Chi 600 Kh (backhoe) \\}'\\jJ Psi 700 Ps Oro Omega 800 aw (saw) The following letters were only used for their numeral values: F or S;; Digamma (w) or Stau (st) - 6 9 Qoppa (q) - 90 ~ Sampi (s) - 900 Greek diphthongs can be somewhat complex.

Once these principles are understood, the student may begin using the cards for the practice of divination. The Zelator first encounters the art of divining through Geomancy. Div- ination with Tarot, however, is a more comprehensive and tactile method which fully engages all of the practitioner's Qabalistic and Astrological knowledge, together with his/her psychic abilities and creative powers. Our book, The New Golden Dawn Ritual Tarot will provide the student with much information on the subtle relationships that exist between two or more cards in a divination.P! However, a proper Tarot reading requires much more than book knowledge alone. Familiarizing oneself with the symbolism of the cards is merely the first step. This symbolism must be constantly built up in the mind of the reader. This information is progressively absorbed and regularly contemplated until there is a gradual alignment between the operation of the higher conscious- ness and that of the normal consciousness. The powers of psychic perception and awareness begin to develop greater accuracy and precision. The second step in performing accurate divinations is to practice constantly. This is the only tried and true method for success in this area. The student should regularly examine the relationships that can occur between certain cards in an actual reading. Keep in mind, however, that it is pointless to coerce a reading. All of the symbolism in the universe will not avail one who is under strain or simply too tired to properly activate the psyche. If a reading is forced, it will probably be more untruth than truth. Finally, one specific card reading method or Tarot spread should be chosen for regular and consistent use in divination. Three different Tarot spreads are pre- sented here: The first is the Celtic Cross Spread, a ten card layout that was made 131 A ritual for consecrating a deck of Tarot cards is given on page 166 of that book."},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade 559 popular by A.E. Waite. This was the layout recommended to Outer Order initiates in Mather's day, because it was simple and direct.B 2 The method that we prefer to teach our students is the Ten Card or Cicero Spread which we have found to be quite reliable. Its advantage over the Celtic Cross Spread is that it eliminates the need for reversed or inverted cards, relying instead upon neighboring cards for interpretation. At the start of any reading, it is appropriate to relax, meditate and to invoke the Divine. This not only aligns the reader with the Higher Forces, but it also sets the stage for reliable psychic interpretations. The initiate may decide to put on rit- ual garb and insignia as additional aids which focus the mind on the divine nature of the operation. The lesser invoking pentagram may be traced over the cards with a wand or index finger. 133 Visualize a brilliant ball of Light just over one's head and say the following invocation: In the divine name lAO, I invoke thee, thou Great Angel HRU (Her-co) whoart set over the operations of this Secret Wisdom. Lay thine hand invis- iblyon these consecrated cards ofart,that thereby I may obtain true knowl- edge of hidden things, to the glory of the ineffable Name. Amen. The Tarot cards may be shuffled thoroughly, while the diviner maintains a clear still mind and an attitude of psychic receptivity. The cards may then be spread out using one of the following methods. The Celtic Cross Spread The diviner must first select a card to represent the Querent or the question itself. This first card is known as the Significator. In many cases a Court card which cor- responds to the personal or physical description of the Querent is chosen as the Significator. At times a Trump or small card may be selected as the Significator if the card's meaning conforms to the matter at hand. Once the Significator is selected, the diviner should place it on the table, face upwards. The rest of the deck should be shuffled and cut three times, always keeping the cards face down. CARD 1: Tum up the top or first card of the deck and place it over the Sig- nificator, This covers him. The first card portrays the general influence that is effect- ing the Querent or the matter of the question. CARD 2: Tum up the second card and lay it across the first. This crosses him. The second card shows the character of the obstacles in the matter. If the card is favorable, this may indicate that the obstacles can be overcome. It may also indi- cate that something which is normally considered good will not be good in this particular situation. 132 The more complex method, known as the Openingof the Key, was taught in the Second Order. 133 The Philosophus may use the Outer Wand of Double Power or the Tarot Wand. Both of these implements are described in our book Secrets of a Golden Dawn Temple."},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"o B G [j The Celtic Cross Spread GG 00 ® G[j 00 The Cicero Spread 560"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade 561 CARD 3: Tum up the third card and place it above the Significator. This crowns him. The Third card can represent either the Querent's goal in the matter or the best that can be attained under the circumstances (but has not yet come to pass). CARD 4: Tum up the fourth card and place it below the Significator. This is beneath him. The fourth card portrays the foundation of the matter-that which as already occurred and which the Significator has made his own. CARD 5: Tum up the fifth card and place it either to the right or left of the Significator, away from the direction the Significator is facing. This is behind him. (Note: if the card does not \"face\" any particular direction, the diviner must decide ahead of time which direction will be viewed as \"facing.\" Often the card on the right side of the Significator will be viewed as the one \"behind.\" This card portrays the influence on the matter that has just passed, or is in the process of passing. CARD 6: Tum up the sixth card and place it on the side that the Significa- tor is facing (opposite Card 5). This is before him. The sixth card shows the influence on the matter that is just beginning to occur and which will be operating in the immediate future. The cards are now arranged in the form of a cross, with the Significator in the center, undemeath Card 1. The next four cards are placed consecutively one card above the other in an ascending line to the right of the cross. CARD 7: This card represents the Significator or Querent himself. It por- trays the position or attitude of the Significator in the unfolding circumstances. CARD 8: This card indicates his house-the Querent's environment and the inclinations involved that have an effect on the matter. (For example: responsibili- ties, career, position in life, influence of family or friends, etc.) CARD 9: This card represents the Querent's hopes or fears in the matter. CARD 10: This card portrays the end result or final outcome which is brought about by the influences of all the previous cards in the reading. The tenth card should be regarded as especially significant to the entire reading. The Ten Card Spread (The Cicero Spread) After a preliminary meditation the cards should be shuffled thoroughly. The diviner should take the first ten cards from the deck and spread them out in accor- dance with the diagram. CARD 1: This represents the person asking the question as well as the pri- mary influences surrounding him or her. A Court card here might refer to the Querent or to some dominant person in his/her life. CARDS 2 and 3: These cards represent the subconscious mind of the person asking the question. They give information on the hidden influences which effect, but are not detected by the Querent. These cards may have a strong yet concealed influence that can effect the entire reading.

It reveals the psychological implications upon the Querent, as well as the actions he/she will take in making whatever decision may be necessary. It may also indicate forces operating beyond the control of the Querent, to which s/he must adapt. The Fifteen Card Spread After a preliminary meditation the cards should be shuffled thoroughly.

Regardie noted that these teachings from the Eastern School did not particularly blend well with the rest of the G:.D:. system: \"As to whether it accords with the general content of the rest of the Order system must be left to the discrimination of the individual student. That it has several points of value will be doubted by none, though few will care to subscribe to the paper in its entirety. Per- sonally, I feel it to be definitely an alien system, which touches the Order teaching in but very few places. The mode of skrying in the Spirit-vision using the Tattwas sym- bols is sound enough, and has been described elsewhere. But other aspects suggest that the two systems are not likely to mix particularly well.\"135 It is our feeling as well that the Tattwas are a completely foreign addition to the Order teachings-introduced early on as a result of the popularity of Tattwas in the London Theosophical groups which were frequented by several Adepts of the G:.D:. at the time. Today, study of the Tattwas within our Order is considered as an elective rather than required grade work. Our students are encouraged to employ the Western Elemental and Sub-Elemental symbols of the Spirit Wheel and the Elemental triangles or the Kerubic sigils rather than the Tattwas. Using the Western forms will provide the student with symbols which are completely integrated with every other aspect of the G:.D:. teachings, from Neophyte studies to advanced Enochian work. These Western symbols also corre- spond to the Golden Dawn's attribution of color to the Elements, whereas the Eastern Tattwas do not. We have included this paper for those students who choose to study the Tattwa system.-eC & STC)¢ 134 From Regardie's The Golden Dawn. 135 Ibid. page 514."},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"564 SELF-INfI1ATION IN10 THE GoLDEN DAWN 'TRAomoN General Observation. There are five Tattwas or Principles: 1. Akasa-Ether. 2. Vayu-the Aerial principle. 3. Tejas-the Principle of light and Heat. 4. Apas-Watery Principle. 5. Prithivi-the Earthly Principle. But the first Cause of these is the Great Controller of all things, the One light, the Formless. From Him first came into appearance Ether; thence the Air, the motion producing Ether waves which causes light and Heat, and so on in the above order. The Yogicomes to know the principle of these five Tattwas, their Sukshma Sharira, but how? Further on you will see how. The Astrologer who has no knowl- edge of the Swara is as worthless as a man without a wife. It is the Soul itself; it is the Swara, the Great Controller of all, who creates, preserves, and destroys, and causes whatsoever is in this World. Experience and Tradition both say no knowl- edge is more precious than this knowledge of the Swara. None else lays bare the workings of the machinery of this world, or the secret workings of this world. By the power of Swara may be destroyed an enemy. Power, wealth, and pleasure, all these can be commanded by Swara. The beginner in our Science must be pure and calm in mind and in thought, virtuous in actions, and having unmixed faith in his spiritual teacher. He must be strong in his determination, and grateful. Swara in the Body. Ten manifestations of this Swara are in the body. But before the Neophyte is told this, he must gain a thorough knowledge of the ner- vous system. This is very important, and according to his knowledge of this sci- ence, the Neophyte gains success. To give a rough outline of the parts we have chiefly to deal with in our endeavor to explain the elementary treatise: There are ten principal nerves, this includes the tubes, etc. It is in the ten manifestations of Swara that the ten so-called Vayus move. We mean by this ten forces which per- form ten different functions. The three most important nerves are the following, as the beginner has only to deal with these: 1. Ida-the left bronchus. 2. Pingala-the right bronchus. 3. Sushumna-in the middle."},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade The ten Vayus are: 1. Prana, in the breast. 2. Apana, about the excretory organs. 3. Samana, in the navel. 4. Undana, middle of the throat. 5. Vyana, pervading the whole body. 6. Kunnana, the eyes, helping them open. 7. Kirkala, in the stomach, producing hunger. 8. Nag, whence comes vomiting. 9. Devadatta, causes yawning. 10. Dhananjaya, that which doth not leave the body after death. 565 These ten vayus, or forces, have their play in the ten principal nerves, not one in each. They are the regulators of the body of man. If they go on working prop- erly, a man remains perfectly healthy; if not, different kinds of diseases spring up. A Yogi keeps them always working, and consequently diseases never come to him. The key to all these nerves lies in the working of the Prana Vayu, or vital principle drawing the Air through the Ida, the Pingala, and the Sushumna. When the Air is drawn through the Ida it is felt coming out or going in through the left nostril. When through the Pingala, in the right nostril. When through the Sushumna it is felt through both nostrils simultaneously. The Air is drawn or felt through either or both of the nostrils at certain appointed times. Whenever in any given time, the Breath goes in and comes out of the wrong nostril it is a sure sign some sort of disease is coming on. The Ida is sometimes called the Chandra Nadi, or the Moon Nerve. The Pingala, the Surya Nadi or Sun nerve. These are called, the former, the Chandra Swara and the latter the Surya Swara. The reason is that when the breath is in the Ida it gives coolness to the body, and that when in the Pingala it gives heat to the body. The ancient Magi used to say the place of the Moon in the human body was in Ida, and the Sun in Pingala. The Course of the Breath. The Lunar month, it is well known, is divided into two parts, the fortnight of the Waxing and the fortnight of the Waning. On the first fortnight, or the Bright Fortnight, just at Sunrise of the first day the Breath must come into the left nostril and must be so for three days successively. At the beginning of the 4th day the Breath must come through the right nostril and must do so for the three succeeding days, when again the 7th day must begin with the Moon breath, and so on in the same order. Thus we have said that such and such days begin with such and such a breath. But how long is our breath to remain in one nostril? For five Gharis, or 2 hours. Thus when the first day of the Bright fortnight begins with the Moon Breath, after five Gharis, the Sun Breath must set in, and this again must change into the Moon Breath after the same interval of time. So on for every day.

It will be seen that all the days of the month have been divided into the Ida and the Pingala. In the Sushumna, the Swara flows only when it changes, either in its natural course or in certain other conditions to be afterwards mentioned. This is the course of Nature. But a Yogi commands Nature. He turns everything into his own way. Rules for this will be given in the proper place. Course of the Tattwas For five Gharis, as we have above said, the breath flows through our nostrils. In these 5 Gharis, or two hour periods, the Tattwas have their course. In the first we have Akasa, in the second Vayu, in the third Tejas, in the fourth Apas, in the fifth Prithivi. Thus in one night and day, or 60 Gharis, we have twelve courses of these 5 Tattwas each remaining one Ghari and returning again in two hours. There are again further five subdivisions of each Tattwa in a Ghari. Thus, Akasa is subdivided into Akas-Akasa; Akas-Vayu; Akas-Tejas;Akas-Apas; Akas-Prithivi-and similarly with the other four. How to know which of the Tattwas is at a certain time in course, not merely by a mathematical calculation but with the certainty of an eye witness, is of the great- est importance in the practical part of this science. We shall come to it further on. The Ida. When the Breath is in Ida, that is in the left Nostril, then only is it well to perform the following actions. Stable works such as erecting a building, or the construction of a well or tank, going on a distant journey, entering a new house, collection of things, giving gifts, marriage, making jewels or clothes, taking medicines and tonics, seeing a superior or master for any purpose of trade, amass- ing of wealth, sowing of seed in a field, negotiations, commencement of trade, see- ing of friends, works of charity and faith, going home, buying of animals, doing work for the benefit of others, placing money on security, singing, dancing, taking up abode in any village or city, drinking or making water at the time of sorrow, pain, fever, etc. All these acts should be done when the Swara is in Ida. It must however be kept in mind that the Tattwas Vayu and Tejas are to be excluded from these actions, likewise Akasa. During the Tattwas Prithivi and Apas only, are these actions to be done. In a fever, the Yogi keeps his Chandra Swara going, and brings the Apas or Water Tattwa in course, so the fever is allover in a very short time. How mastery is gained over the Tattwas will come further on. The Pingala. In the Surya Swara only, are the following actions to be done. Reading and teaching hard and difficult subjects of knowledge, sexual inter- course, shipping, hunting, mounting a hill or fort, riding a donkey, camel or horse, swimming over a powerful stream or river, writing, painting, buying and selling, fighting with swords or hands, seeing a king, bathing, eating, shaving, bleeding, sleeping-and such like. All these secure success and health, as the case may be, if done in the Surya Swara. The Sushumna. When the Breath comes not out of both nostrils at the same time, it is flowing in the Sushumna. Nothing ought to be done under these condi- tions, for everything turns out badly. The same is the case when the Breath is now"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade 567 in one and now in the other nostril.

NOTE: Zanonil 36 secured success in gaming for Cetosa and overcame the effects of the poisoned wine of the Prince di D as follows. In the first place, he changed his breath to the right nostril, and threw an envelope of the Akasa Tattwa over his antagonist, who consequently became all empty, the money in gaming flowing towards the Surya Swara. In the latter case he brought the Water, Apas, Tattwa into course, directed it with the full force of his trained will towards the poisoned wine, and consequently the burning heat of the poison was counter- acted for a very long time, and before it could recover strength enough to act on the system, it was there no longer.-S.R.MD.) The Tattwas To each of the five Tattwas a special color has been assigned. Akasa- Black; dark or no color really. Vayu-Green (blue by some). Tejas-Red. Apas, White or really all colors. Prithivi- Yellow. It is by these colors that a practical man finds on the spur of the moment which Tattwa is at the time in course. Besides, these Tattwas have different shapes and tastes. These figures are seen by taking a bright mirror and letting the breath fall upon it, as it comes out of the Nose. The divided part takes one of the following forms according to the Tattwa then in course. Prithivi- a figure having four Angles. Apas, a half moon, or crescent. Tejas, triangular. Vayu, spherical. Akasa, oval like a human ear. To sum up their qualities: Prithivi-moves always in the middle of the paths of Air and Water. Apas- downwards, straight through the nose. Tejas-upwards.

For practice, let a man take five little bullets or coun- ters colored: red, yellow, green or blue, white or silver, and black. And place or carry them in his pocket. Now let him close his eyes and take one of them out of his pocket. The color of the bullet will be that of the Tattwa then in course. Whilst still keeping the eyes closed, let him see if the color of the bullet floats before them. He must not suppose he will be correct all at once. By and by the confusion will disappear, and colors well-defined, staying for the proper length of time, will begin to come before him, and the color of the bullet will be the same as that seen before his eyes. And then he will have gained the power of knowing which of the Tattwas is in course, and can at pleasure find them. There is a particular method of concentrating the mind and practicing the eyes for this purpose, which will come with practice. Let him ask any of his friends to imagine one of the five colors, say a flower. He will only have to shut his eyes to find the Tattwa then in course, and he can astonish his friends by naming the color. Again, if a man sitting amongst his friends finds the Vayu Tattwa set in, let him be sure that those of his friends who are in perfect health and in a normal state both of body and mind, wish to go away. Let him ask them to say frankly, and they will answer \"yes.\" In what way other Tattwas affect both the body and mind of man will be stated in another place. Some higher secrets are purposely reserved for those who safely and honestly pass the elementary stage. When the man has reached the stage of finding at will any of the Tattwas, let him not imagine he has become perfect. If he goes on practicing, his inward sight becomes keener, and he will rec- ognize the five subdivisions of the Tattwas. On and on let him go with his medi- tation, and innumerable shades of color will be recognized according to the different proportions of the 'Iattwas. Whilst during these intervals he is trying to distinguish from all external things; and sitting in an easy chair, let him fix his eyes on any particular part of the blue sky, and go on looking at it without allowing them to twinkle. At first he will see the waves of the water, this is the watery vapor in the atmosphere which surrounds the whole world. Some days later, as the eyes become practiced, he will see different sorts of buildings and so on in the Air, and many other wonderful things as well. When the Neophyte reaches this stage of practice, he is sure of gaining success. After this he will see different sorts of mixed colors of Tattwas in the sky, which will after a constant and resolute practice show themselves in their proper and respective colors. To test the truth of this, the Neophyte during the practice should occasion- ally close his eyes and compare the color floating in the sky with that which he sees inwardly. When both are the same the operation is right. Other tests we have given before, and other wonders resulting from this will of themselves present themselves to the Yogi. This practice is to be done in the daytime. For the night, let the student rise about two o'clock in the morning, when everything is calm, when there is no noise, and when the cold light of the stars breathe holiness, and a calm rapture enters into the Soul of man. Let him wash his hands, feet, the crown of his head, and the nape of his neck with cold water. Let"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"570 SELF-INlTIATION IN10 1HE GoWEN DAWN TRAOmON him put his shin bones on the ground, and let the back of his thighs touch his calves, and let him put his hands upon his knees, the fingers pointing towards the body. Let him now fix his eyes on the tip of his nose. To avoid this tediousness, he must always, especially during the meditation, meditate upon his breath, coming in and going out. Besides the above, this has many other advantages given elsewhere. It may here be said that by constant practice of this meditation over his breath, the man is to develop two distinct syllables in his thought. It is evident that when a man draws his breath in, a sound is produced which is imitated in Han. When out, the sound Sa. By constant practice, the going in and coming out of the breath is so much connected with these sounds that without any effort the mind understands Han-sa with the production of these sounds. Thus we see that one full breath makes Han-Sa, this is the Name of the Ruler of the Universe, together with his powers. They are exerted in the working out of natural phenomena. At this stage of perfection, the Yogi should commence as follows: Getting up at two or three in the morning, and washing himself in the aforementioned manner, let him know and fix his mind upon the Tattwa then in course. If the Tattwa in course be then Prithivi, let him think of it as something having 4 angles, a good yellow color, sweet smelling, small in body, and taking away all diseases. Let him at the same time repeat the word LAM. It is very easy to imagine such a thing. If it be the Apas Tattwa, let him imagine something of the shape and brightness of the half moon, putting down heat and thirst, and that he is immersed in the ocean of Water. Let him at that time repeat the word VAM. If the Tattwa be Tejas, let him imagine it as something triangular in shape, shedding a red glare, consuming food and drink, burning away everything, and thus making itself unbearable. At the same time let him repeat RAM. If the Tattwa be Vayu, let him imagine it as something of a spherical shape, of a color Green, or Blue, like the green leaves of a tree after rain, and carrying him with a mighty power away from the ground and flying in space like the birds. And let him repeat the syllable PAM. If the Tattwa be Akasa, let him imagine it as having no shape but giving forth a brilliant light, and let him repeat the syllable HAM. By diligent practice, these syllables uttered by the tongue of a Yogibecome inseparable from the Tattwas. When he repeats any of these, the special Tattwa appears with as much force as he may will, and thus it is that a Yogi can cause whatever he likes; lightning, rain, wind, and so forth. Cure of Diseases Every disease causes the breath to flow out of the wrong nostril, and the wrong Tattwa to come into course. When the breath therefore is restored to the proper nostril, and the proper Tattwa has been brought into course, let not anyone expect that all that is necessary has been done. If the disease be obstinate and the attack a very violent one, the man will have to persevere in battle a very long time before he conquers."},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade 571 If a beginner cannot succeed very soon, let him aid the power of his breath by a suitable medicine, and Swara will be restored very soon. It may be noticed that the Chandra Swara is generally the best for all dis- eases. Its flow is an indication of the soundness of Health. In cold, cough, and other diseases, this breath ought to flow. Of the Tattwas as well as of the Swaras, no one causes pain if it goes on properly. In this state it ought not generally to be meddled with. But when anyone gains an undue predominance and causes diseases, it ought to be at once changed. Experience shows that the Apas and the Prithivi Tattwas are the only ones gener- ally good for health, and indeed, the fact that during the course of the Apas Tattwa the breath is felt 16 fingers breadth below the nose, and during the Prithivi 12 fin- gers, argues at those times a more sound and powerful working of the functions of the body, than when it is felt only 8, or 4, or no finger-breadth below the nose. Akasa therefore is the worst for health, and in a state of ill-health, a man will generally find in course, either Akasa, Vayu, or Tejas. Let him therefore, when need be, proceed in the following manner. After having changed his Breath, from the wrong nostril to the proper one, generally the Left, and pressing the opposite side by a cushion so that it may not change again, let the man sit in an easy chair and bind his left thigh a little above the knee joint with his handkerchief. In a short time, whose length, varies inversely as the deficiency of practice, and directly as the violence of the disease, he will perceive that the Tattwa changes to the one immediately below it and so on; and then the next, and so forth. If he be an acute observer of the conditions of his bod}\" he will perceive that slowly his mind is becoming more and more easy. Let him tighten his bandage still more if need be. When at last he reaches the Prithivi Tattwa, he will find in the state of his health a great change for the better. Let him preserve in this state, or, still better, the Apas Tattwa for some time, and return to it occasionally for some days, even after the attacks of the disease have ceased. He will no doubt be cured. Forecast of Futurity Although a Yogi obtains the power of knowing everything that is, has been, or is to be, beyond the reach of the senses, yet generally he becomes indifferent to such knowledge, forgetting himself, as he does, in his eternal presence before the Light which breathes beauty into all we see in the world. We shall therefore represent him here revealing if not all his knowledge of futurity, only on questions being put to him by others. But our Neophytes may as well put the questions themselves, and then answer them according to the laws here laid down. When a man comes and says to the Yogi that he has a question to ask, let him: (a) see which of the Tattwas is in course. If the Tattwa be Prithivi, the ques- tion is about some root, something belonging to the vegetable kingdom, or some- thing in which the Earthy nature is predominant. (b) If it be Apas, it is about some Life, birth, death, etc. (c) If Tejas, the question is of metals, gain, or loss, etc. (d) If Akasa, he means to ask nothing. (e) If Vayu, about some journey."},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"572 SELF-INITIATION IN10 THE GoLDEN DAWN TRADmON These are but elementary things. The practical Yogi who can distinguish between the mixture of the Tattwas can name the particular things. Now let him see through which of his nostrils the Breath is flowing, which is the fortnight then in course of passing, which the days, and what direction of himself, the enquirer. If the breath comes through the Left nostril, to secure complete success in the work which makes the subject of the question, and which will be of the sort specified under Ida, he must have the following coincidences. The fortnight must be bright, that is of the Waxing Moon. The day must be even; 2, 4, 6, and so on; the direction must be East or North. If these things coincide the man will get what he wants. Again, if the Surya and Swara coincide with the dark fortnight, the day odd, the direction South and West, the same result may be predicted but not so thoroughly. The action will be of the sort prescribed under Pingala. According as any of these do not coincide, will the success be more or less imperfect. It must be remembered that the breath at the time must not be flowing through the wrong nostril. This has many bad consequences; we only just touch the subject. Of the Wrong Swara. If at the commencement of the day the wrong Swara arises, the Luna for the Solar, and vice versa, a man may expect something wrong.

For example, a person in the beginning stages of emotional love often becomes completely obsessed with the object of his/her desire-sometimes 137 From Regardie's The Golden Dawn."},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"574 SELF-INITIATION IN10 THE GoLDEN DAWN 'fRAomoN neglecting all other responsibilities in the process. Fear, another potent emotion, often evokes the same response in those persons who seem wholly consumed and preoccupied by their phobias. All strongly felt emotions (whether love, hate, envy, etc.) can induce a high degree of concentration. Emotion is therefore a tool that the initiate can use to deliberately focus the mind solely upon one idea. Desire and deep conviction are the necessary creative catalysts in this process. The aspirant must discover something that will arouse within him/her a deeply inspiring emotional reaction. This could include a poem, a work of art, a Biblical or literary passage, a place, a memory, or even a relationship. No matter what the inspiring image is, the initiate should think upon it and examine it carefully. The image can be summed up within a single glyph or symbol that will serve as an emblem of that which awakens the emotion; the Symbol of Devo- tion. This symbol of Devotion can easily be expanded to contain or even become the ultimate goal of the Great Work undertaken by the aspirant. The Symbol of Devo- tion which summarizes one's spiritual goal can be either drawn or painted as a sacred object, or it can be preserved abstractly within the canvas of the mind. Whatever Symbol of Devotion is used, the initiate should bestow great attention to it until it becomes such a potent force that simply gazing at it or think- ing about it is all that is necessary to inspire a profound feeling of devotional pas- sion. When this occurs, the symbol becomes an integral part of the aspirant's psyche, growing stronger each time it is recalled. It is a good practice to employ the Symbol of Devotion to consecrate the most routine activities of daily life to the service of the Divine. Thus even the most ordinary act is accomplished for the sake of the completion of the Great Work. This eventually results in the dedication of one's life to the Divine and to make every act a sacred act. The totality of the initiate's being becomes highly focused in one persistent act of devotion to the Divine Light. If the aspirant so desires, the Symbol of Devotion can be mentally linked to the deity of his/her choice. (This deity can be derived from any pantheon or tra- dition.) In this way the image of the deity is firmly connected to the spiritual emo- tion, making the essence of the deity come to spiritual fruition in the mind of the initiate. Thus any conscious act which invokes the deity becomes an invocation to complete the Great Work.* SACRED GROUND Initiation is a twofold process which entails both the elevation of the Lower Self to the Higher and the invocation of the Higher Self into the Lower vehicle. This exer- cise involves the consecration of the initiate's Malkuth in order to sublimate it to the Higher awareness of Kether-to render the kingdom sacred for the descent of Spirit."},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade 575 To begin this exercise, first remove your shoes so that your feet are bare. Remain seated and begin the method of rhythmic breathing. Once this breathing pattern has been established, visualize flames covering the floor beneath your feet. (Note: you may choose to heighten this visualization by first applying a small amount of analgesic cream used for arthritis to the soles or ankles of your feet, so long as you are not allergic to these substances. (Regardie often employed an oriental medica- tion called Tiger Balm for such purposes.) Visualize the red flames both around and through your feet. Invoke the divine names of Malkuth (for Earth) and Netzach (for Fire) while maintaining the image of sacred ground. For Malkuth, intone: \"ADONAI HA- ARETZ. SANDALPHON. ASHIM.\" For Netzach vibrate \"YHVH TZABAOTH. HANIEL. ELOHIM.\" Continue the exercise for approximately fifteen minutes once or twice daily while in the grade of Philosophus.e The 29th Path of Qoph The Sepher Yetzirah calls the 29th Path (from Malkuth to Netzach) the Corporeal Intelligence, because it forms the very body which is so formed beneath the whole Order of the Worlds and the increment of them. It is therefore a path of organiza- tion and formation. Case describes the \"Corporeal Intelligence\" as \"body con- sciousness\" representing that stage of incarnation in which the physical body is organized into a form that the Soul may inhabit. This path is ultimately concerned with the acts of reproduction and physical evolution. It is a sexual path, full of passions, reflexes and instincts. The process of journeying upon the paths of the Tree can have a definite effect on the physical body as well as the psychic body. The physical temple of the body is gradually refined as the Divine Light enters into it, and as the Lower Self becomes steadily aware of the Higher. The occult meaning of the letter Qoph is \"sleep,\" referring to the subcon- scious state. This is also indicated by the literal meaning of the letter Qoph, which is \"the back of the head.\" In addition, this is also a path of the lower astral, where the student must face and overcome the phantoms and illusions reflected back from the material plane. This is a harsh, probationary path of Water, where the stu- dent must confront and conquer the \"creations of the created,\" meaning the phan- tasms which dwell in the darkest parts of his/her own mind, as well as the ghosts of humanity's collective subconscious. The 29th Path can in fact be a frightening one to traverse, but to the initiate who successfully crosses it, great insight into the inner workings of the astral realm is gained. The Dark is not to be feared, but accepted as the counterpart of the Light. The 18th Key of the Tarot The Moon, is attributed to this path. The Magical Title of this card is \"The Ruler of Flux and Reflux, the Child of the Sons of the Mighty.\" The path of The Moon is known as \"The Victory of the Material.\" Venus"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"576 SELF-INITIATION INlO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON acting through Pisces upon the Cosmic Elements. It refers to the deceptive effect of the apparent power of Material Forces, due to the proximity of the Material plane. In other words this path exposes the individual to the allure and pleasure (Venus) that the physical world holds over the psyche (Cosmic elements) using watery Pisces energy. It is up to the initiate to confront and understand this seduc- tion in order to master it and not be mastered by it. Symbols included within the Tarot card of The Moon are: The orb of the Moon waxing on the side of Chesed (Mercy), four Hebrew Yods falling from Luna like drops of rain, two wild dogs cavorting by moonlight, two towers marking the Path of Qoph in the background, a crayfish in the foreground pulling itself out of the Water onto the path to dry land. The crayfish climbing onto land represents the initiate, starting up the path of evolution from a low-level consciousness to a high-level consciousness (from mundane to spiritual). It seeks the path of growth, which leads out of darkness and into the Light. In its progression, the crayfish must pass by the fierce dogs who are the representatives of the Anubian guards of the path. The crayfish, like the initiate, must overcome all fear and confront what ever phantoms await, for eventually the sun will rise.e A JOURNEY ON THE 29TH PATH OF QOPHl38 For this ritual the Philosophus will need the robe, nemyss, red sandals, the Cal- vary Cross of Twelve Squares, and the Outer Wand of Double Power. The temple is to be arranged as in the Opening of the 4 = 7 grade. Upon the altar should be the Tarot Trump of THE MOON. A comfortable place to sit and meditate should be arranged West of the pillars. After a period of relaxation has passed, go to the Northeast and say: \"HEKAS, HEKAS, ESTE BEBELOI!

As before, you intone the names which call forth the inhabitants of this tem- ple, Adonaiha-Aretz, Sandalphon, Ashim, and finally, Malkuth. Sandalphon appears as in your previous journeys and you exchange the usual Signs. She asks \"Why have you come to the bridal chamber of Kalah in the realm of the Active World?\" This time you hold up the Calvary Cross of 12 Squares for the Archangel to see. She leads you to a curtain in the Southeast of the temple upon which is painted the Tarot card of The Moon. She traces the symbol of Pisces and the veil fades into mist. In its place is a door carved from Mother of Pearl upon which is the Hebrew letter Qoph in red- violet. Giving the Sign of the Philosophus, you hold out the Cross and trace the let- ter Qoph before the door, which dissolves. A great sea stretches before you blanketed by a thick fog. You are uncertain how to cross this expanse of Water until you notice a white shape rising from the deep. A large scallop shell breaks the surface of the Water at your feet. You step down into it and sit down. Sandalphon is not coming with you, but she gives you a talisman carved from cuttlebone. On one side of it is the symbol of two fish joined by a rope-the sigil of Pisces. On the other side is the representation of a crayfish. Biding the Archangel farewell, you set out upon your journey, drifting across the Waters. The temple of Malkuth is soon lost from sight in the mist. The Water gently rocks the shell as you glide along. Not being able to see in any direction, you look down and are amazed at the variety of life just under the surface of the Waters. Your sight seems greatly intensified; you see unicellular life forms such as protozoans or single-celled animals, feeding on microscopic food particles and reproducing by cell division. They are eaten by larger multi- celled creatures which are in turn devoured by small jellyfish and crustaceans. Fish hungrily snap up these tasty invertebrates. It is all quite fascinating to you. Nearby the fin of a dolphin cuts through the surface. The animal seems to be fol- lowing you, or perhaps it is leading your unusual vessel. Ahead of you the mist parts and you see land. As you glide toward the shore, you see two great stone towers. The portal unto dry land is guarded by the twin Anubian Guards whom you have seen before on the 32nd Path. You stand and face them as your craft pulls into shore. Just as before, they cross their weapons and bar your approach with a snarl. \"In what signs and symbols ye come?\" they demand.

A small yet colorful feathered animal with claws and teeth glides through the treetops, catching a huge dragonfly in mid-flight. In a clearing ahead, you see two large animals locked in mortal combat. Alarge carnosaur kicks at the belly of a smaller crested plant-eater with deadly clawed feet. The wounded animal bellows in pain as the final blows are inflicted. The victor hungrily tears meat from the not-quite-dead victim, and turns its bloodied head to inspect you with a cold, dull eye. Hunger brings its attention back to the meal at hand. Relieved, you continue though the forest. Farther up the trail you nearly stumble into a pit of tar. A giant lumbering haired beast has already expired in the black pool. Its body is tom at by a pack of wolves who snap at one another over the possession of choice bits of flesh. Some of the animals have themselves become mired in the tar. The fearful cries of the unfor- tunates who lay exhausted in the pool are ignored by the rest of the hungry pack. The jungle opens out into a swamp which makes travel difficult and pre- carious. It is dark and eerie in this place. Vapors from rotting vegetation rise to the surface of the fetid Waters and cause strange phosphorescent lights and move- ments. It is easy to see why bogs of this type were thought to be haunted by the Spirits of the dead. The swamp gases play about you, forming phantom shapes and faces against the dark canopy of the trees. In the middle of the marsh stands a large black stone carved into the shape of some terrifying ancient deity. From the scattered bones around the stone, you deduce that humans were once sacrificed here to avoid the wrath of an angry god who might withhold food-animals and plants from hungry tribes. The ghosts of the sacrificed seem to linger here in the iridescent gasses. Without fear, but nonetheless anxious to leave this dreadful place, you press on. Eventually, the swamp feeds into a river, and the ground on either side of it becomes more firm. The path leads along the river bank amid tall rushes and cattails. Feeling that you are being watched, you tum toward the river and see the unnerving form of a large crocodile eyeing you curiously. This is the Water god, Sebek, whom the Egyptians worshiped and feared. On the shore near him is an altar upon which a goat has been sacrificed and offered-to persuade the god not to wander about the canals of Egypt searching for hapless victims. For the moment, he is appeased. You are thankful when the road finally leads away from the river. Beyond the marshlands, the trail takes you up a hill at the top of which is a lion with two heads, one at either end of its body. The menacing beast sits squarely in your path. \"Thou canst not enter the realm of Nature and witness the act of Creation unless thou canst tell us our names.\" The heads warn. \"Thou art the god SEF and the god TUAU. Thou art the twin gods of Yes- terday and Tomorrow.\" \"In what signs and symbols do ye come?\" they ask. You answer with the Sign of the Philosophus and say, \"In the divine name YHVH Tzabaoth, in the word Kaph Cheih, and in this symbol of the Four Rivers.\" You hold out the Calvary Cross. The creature steps out of your way and you con- tinue up the hill."},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"The Philosoph us Grade 579 At the summit, you look out over a barren landscape. This was the world that existed before the present one. This was the Aeon of time when god begot god, before the stars were positioned. This was the time when Tern, the god of the setting sun produced from his own body by masturbation, his two children-Shu, the god of Air and Tefnut, the goddess of the rains. From the mating of these two gods came the births of Nut and Geb. The form of Nut fills the sky above you. Her skin is dark and bespangled with stars. Her arms are projected over her head. Her legs are straight with feet together. She is the goddess of the starry heavens, mistress and mother of the gods, and coverer of the sky. Upon her head is a vase of Water, for she is the Water of the firmament, and the starry ocean above. Her consort Geb, the green god of Earth lays upon the dry and barren ground, propped up on one elbow. With one arm he reaches toward his heavenly lover, who comes to him. The goddess bends her great body into a semicircle which covers the reclining form of the Earth god. Sky and Earth become locked in an intimate and passionate embrace which seems to last indefinitely. Ra, the mighty Sun god is angered by this great coupling. How will the Solar boat be carried across the sky if the Heavens are eternally mating with the Earth? He orders their father, Shu, to separate the amorous pair. The Air god does so, stepping between the lovers and lifting Nut off of Geb. Her body then forms the arch of the heavens, her arms and legs become the four pillars of the sky and the cardinal points. The raising up of Nut from the embrace of Geb is the first act of creation-the Earth is now separate from the Waters above it. The sun is now set between the Earth and the sky by the reconciling element of Air. The sky, now pregnant, is able to give birth to Osiris, Isis, and other gods and goddesses. Over- head, you witness the process of birth, as the Constellations and Planets are pro- duced from the belly of Nut. The fertile Geb is enabled to cover the Earth with trees, plants, animals and humans. The landscape before you, barren before the great mating, springs to new life with herbs, grains and wildflowers. Before your very eyes, the vegetation thrives and produces fruit. The path leads on toward a temple surrounded by a colonnade of lotus- topped pillars. The temple itself is built from bricks of pure emerald overgrown with vines. The surrounding courtyard is lush with all manner of plants and wild- flowers. Alarge disc-shaped brazier in front of the building contains a roaring Fire. A tap on your shoulder causes you to tum around. A short and stout being with a huge bearded face, large ears and shaggy hair sticks his tongue out and throws an armful of flowers at you. The god, Bes, dressed in animal skins and wearing a tiara of feathers, lets out a huge belly laugh at his jest. He is the god of joy, pleasure and amusement. He welcomes you to the courtyard with a comic dance which is deliberately clumsy and you cannot help but laugh at his antics. In the dance, he humorously mimics your journey through the prehistoric jungle and the fetid swamp-snapping at your backside like Sebek the crocodile. At the end of his dance, the god takes a seat and begins to playa soft melody on a harp, for the goddess of Nature is about to make her appearance."},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"580 SELF-INITIATION IN10 mE GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON The beauty of Hathor, the Lady of love, music and dance captivates you as she descends the steps of the temple. The dark skin of her breasts and arms is soft and all-inviting. Her full lips and high cheek bones are accentuated by the slender curve of her neck. She wears a green half-tunic and the crown of cow's horns sur- mounted by the Solar disc. She is known as the great power of Nature which is perpetually conceiving and creating, rearing and nurturing all things great and small. She is the mother of her father and the daughter of her son. A train of atten- dant gods follow her every move, for she is known as the mother of every god and goddess. Plants bear seeds in every patch of Earth where her foot has touched. Antelope drop their young at her passing. Within an instant, the goddess transforms into a great cow. The child Horus comes forth to suckle from her. When he has had his fill, Hathor changes again, into her previous form, but with the head of a cow. Horus falls asleep in the lap of his nursemaid. She gestures at a small shrine in one comer of the garden, indicating that you should investigate. Upon closer inspection, you notice two nude figures before the door of the grotto. On one side is Min, the god of the Moon and the bestower of fertility in men. His strong body testifies to his sexual powers. The other figure is Qetesh, a moon goddess whose voluptuousness and powers of love relate her to Hathor. A dish of lettuce, considered to be an aphrodisiac by the Egyptians, is placed in offering before each of the figures. You approach and present the signs of a Philosophus and the symbol of the Cross, but in order to enter the shrine, you must honor one of the Lunar deities with a kiss. Past the entrance into the building it is dark. Before you is a still pool of Water. Beyond that is hill with two forbidding towers. Two black dogs snap and bay at the ghostly face of the Moon, hanging low in the darkening sky. The Lunar energies have stirred the wild animal passions within them. Alowly crayfish starts up the path of evolution which leads between the two higher animal forms. The creature must thread its way carefully through the terrors of the night, that it may live to see the glory of the morning sun. You realize that this is also the path of the initiate, who must face the demons in the back of his/her mind-illusions created in the race consciousness as well as personal illusions and phobias. Like the cray- fish, the initiate must be prepared to move up the path of evolution. Although the journey is fraught with unpleasantness, the end result is growth and beauty. You leave the shrine of the Moon and walk down into the garden of Hathor. She is again as you saw her in the beginning with human features. Beside her is Sandalphon, ready to accompany you on the journey back. You bid farewell to the company of gods and return down the path to the river. Swiftly you pass the fetid swamp and the ancient jungle. The twin Anubis guards watch motion- lessly from the shore as you and the Archangel sail away on the white scallop across the expanse of the sea. The temple of Malkuth soon appears in the ocean mist. You enter and take a few moments to warm yourself by the hearth as San- dalphon seals the portal of Qoph. After standing awhile at the altar to take in its spiritual Fire, you salute the Archangel with the Neophyte Sign.

Perform the LBRP with the black end of the wand. Declare the temple duly closed.e The 28th Path of Tzaddi The Sepher Yetzirah calls the 28th Path (from Yesod to Netzach) the Natural Intelli- gence, because through it is consummated and perfected the Nature of every exist- ing thing beneath the Sun. This points to the coarse powers of Nature attributed to Netzach. This path is a reflection of the Airy Sign Aquarius, the Water-bearer, unto which is attributed to the Countenance of Man, the ADAM who restored the world. For the initiate, the path that runs between Yesod and Netzach represents the hope of rebuilding the Garden of Eden by the deliberate changing of consciousness through the act of meditation. Meditation is a combination of knowledge and imagination, and it is through the awakening of the centers of consciousness in the body (with medita- tion) that the initiate \"perfects his/her own nature.\" Case describes meditation as \"an unbroken flow of knowledge in a particular object.\" The \"fish-hook\" of Tzaddi is cast into the ocean stream of the subconscious mind to catch a bit of divine truth. It is a period of inner quest and searching. The process of meditation is both the pro- cedure and the goal of spiritual attainment, for the act itself results in a change of energy from one form to another. The initiate on this upper astral path is exploring the very basic mysteries behind creation, life and death. However, the aspirant on the 28th Path must take care not to become \"bewitched\" by the glamours and illu- sions which commence in the sphere of Yesod. This path contains the hopes, dreams and visions of humankind infused with the fertile lifeforce of Netzach. The only way back to a restored Eden is to function in accordance with the universal Will. The 17th Key of the Tarot The Star, is attributed to this path. The Magical Title of this card is \"The Daughter of the Firmament; the Dweller between the Waters.\" The path of The Star is known as \"The Victory of Fundamental Strength.\" Venus acting through Aquarius upon Luna. This is a path of hope that shows the initiate that imagination combined with emotive force (Venus) has great power in the astral realm (Luna) through the Airy energies of Aquarius. Symbols included within the Tarot card of The Star are: a great feminine figure pouring two vases of Water which form a river at her feet, a large star over- head with seven principle rays and fourteen secondary rays, seven smaller stars, the Tree of Life, the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and the ibis of Thoth. The Water that the goddess pours out is pure fluid consciousness-the Waters of Life which receive an everlasting supply of creative energy from Venus. This fluid consciousness is the universal consciousness or wellspring of the imagination which feeds the meditative faculties of humanity, and provides the initiate with an endless stream of spiritual wealth.e"},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"582 SELF-INITIATION IN10 THE GoLDEN DAWN l'RAomoN A JOURNEY ON THE 28TH PATH OF TZADDp39 For this ritual the Philosophus will need the robe, nemyss, red sandals, the Pyra- mid of the Elements, and the Outer Wand of Double Power. The temple is to be arranged as in the second part of the 4 = 7 grade. Upon the altar should be the Tarot Trump of THE STAR. A comfortable place to sit and meditate should be arranged West of the pillars. After a period of relaxation has passed, go to the Northeast and say:\"HEKAS, HEKAS, ESTE BEBELOI!

The now familiar temple of Malkuth formulates around you. The altar flame lends its comforting warmth to the chamber. As before, you intone the names which call forth the inhabitants of this temple, Adonai ha-Aretz, Sandalphon, Ashim, and finally, Malkuth. Sandalphon appears as she has in all your previous journeys and you exchange the usual Signs. You hold up the Truncated Pyramid for her to see, and she takes you quickly through the Eastern portal of Tau. Soon you are at the entrance to the tem- ple of Yesod. You enter without the Archangel, giving the Neophyte Signs. The nine violet walls of the chamber along with the enneangle carved into the floor is a sight which never fails to heighten your sense of awareness. The thick scent of jasmine hangs in the Air, bringing with it the tingling sensation of the Kundalini along the nerves of your spine. The phases of the moon carved in quartz and ebony seem to float eerily in the ceiling above the incense. The four kerubic statues around the silver altar and its central flame again bring an etheric feeling of awe and timelessness. 139 From our book Secret of a Golden Dawn Temple."},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade 583 As before, you vibrate the divine name of Shaddai EI Chai, the Archangel Gabriel, the order of the Kerubim, and finally, the name of the temple itself, Yesod. The beautiful Gabriel takes shape in the clouds of incense. The same dark hair, green eyes and fine-boned features are there, but this time the robes of violet and yellow cover a female form-the Archangel has chosen to emphasize her fem- inine aspects. She speaks: \"Behold around you, the realm of Foundation-the sphere of the art of magic. You have entered the current of the astral Light. By what Sign hast thou entered into the temple of Flux and Reflux? You answer by giving the Sign of the Theoricus. \"Why have you come to the chamber of change and alteration?\" she asks. You hold up the Pyramid of the Four Elements. The Archangel anoints you with perfume as you again step into the sandals of a Firm Foundation which provide you a better footing in the astral plane. Gabriel then takes you to a curtain in the Southeast upon which is depicted the Tarot card of The Star. She traces the sigil of Aquarius and the veil evaporates, disclosing a door of glass, upon which is a panel of violet stained glass shaped in the form of the let- ter Tzaddi. Before it, you hold up the Pyramid and trace the letter of the fishhook. The door opens and the journey on the 28th Path of The Star begins. The scenery along this trail is the most lush and beautiful of any you have yet encountered. Not only is the sight of it beautiful, but the whole atmosphere of the landscape is one of overwhelming peace and promise. It is ideal-the perfect Garden of Eden. Gabriel walks swiftly, but you are in no hurry and pause frequently to admire some singularly lovely flower or butterfly, or listen to a songbird. The guide stops often to let you catch up to her. The path ahead leads between two olive trees where a single figure stands guard with no weapon at all. He is not nearly as menacing as the portal guardians of other paths have been. Nevertheless, he blocks your entrance. \"Thou canst not enter the Garden of Perfected Nature, unless thou canst tell me my name.\" he states. \"SAA, god of feeling and intelligence is Thy name. Thou art the god that causes men and women to perceive, to feel, to understand and to become wise through experience,\" you reply. \"In what signs and symbols do ye come?\" Giving the Sign of Philosophus you answer, \"In the divine name YHVH Tzabaoth, in the word Kaph Cheth and in this symbol of the Pyramid of the Four Elements.\" The god traces the sigil of Aquarius in the Air before you and lets you pass, but not without a word of warning. \"Respect the garden for its beauty, but also for its thorns which are felt but rarely seen.\" With that enigmatic word of caution, you continue up the path. Gabriel indicates that this is as far as she will take you. In the main part of this paradise, there is a cool spring of pure running Water which trickles through a grove of lilacs. Unhurried, you sit down on a large rock which overhangs the stream. A long blade of grass provides you with some- thing to hold between your teeth.

The Water beside the stone reflects your face back at you. After a short while you notice three large yellow butterflies carrying a lily between them. They hover close enough for you to smell the sweet odor of the flower. \"Come closer,\" they whisper, \"Come and drink the nectar of the Garden of Paradise. Live here with us in eternal happiness!\" The smell of the honey-liquid within the flower is intoxicat- ing and inviting. You can imagine how sweet it would taste. But something holds you back. You are suddenly aware of the sandals of Yesod on your feet. The thought of the Firm Foundation suddenly thrusts itself into your mind. If you drink the fluid, you could become immortal and live in the Garden of Eden forever. But at what price? This way to immortality seems too easy. What good is it to become immortal if you have not yet learned the lessons of this incarnation? It is very tempting, but in the end, you refuse to drink. Turning away, you glance down into the stream beneath your feet. To your surprise, the face that is reflected back at you is not your own. The triangu- lar head of Sebek the crocodile, complete with a toothy grin, has stealthily glided into position below you. Instinctively, you give the Attacking Sign at him, fol- lowed by the Sign of Silence. The scaly head disappears under the Water. The sound of laughter makes you look up. The butterflies have become sylphs who are amused that you almost fell for their illusion. The flower that they hold is a carnivorous pitcher plant. In a cloud of fairy dust, they vanish. The glamour gone, you stand up and realize that you almost did not com- plete this journey. Much time as passed, and it is late evening. Luckily, the Moon is high and full, with no clouds to obscure the light it provides. Looking around for the trail, you spot it and continue up the 28th path, this time with more respect and fewer misconceptions. The road winds through thick vegetation and eventually into a grassy meadow. There stands a great and beautiful goddess with long golden hair and milky skin. She is nude save for the symbol of the seven-pointed star at her brow. In each hand she grasps a vase, one gray and one black. Water from both vases pour out upon the ground at her feet, forming the headwaters of a great river. She is Isis, the mighty goddess. But she is also Hathor and Nephthys, the dark-skinned beauty. In fact she is all goddesses, but perhaps she is best described by the title Aima Elo- him, the great Supernal Mother. The vases contain the essences of Chokmah and Binah, respectively, pouring out upon the Earth to restore the decimated garden of Eden. Alarge heptagonal star surrounded by fourteen secondary rays sits in the sky above her head. This is the dog star, Sirius, as well as Sept or Sothis, the Star of Hathor, which is known as the second sun in heaven. The seven Planets of the ancients appear as smaller stars which encircle the Sept star like a halo. To the right (Geburah) side of the figure is the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil, which symbolizes the mixed state of the human condition after the expulsion from the Garden of eternal happiness, pleasure and pain, love and anger, harmony and disorder. An Ibis, the bird of Thoth perches itself on the for- bidding tree as if to emphasize that only through the willpower of the magician can the garden be restored-through the proper use of knowledge in accordance with the universal will."},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade 585 To the left (Chesed) side of the figure is the Tree of Life, the map which humankind may follow to reconstruct the Garden of Eden within the Personality of each individual through meditation and spiritual intuition.

She says nothing and scarcely seems to notice you/ but continues to pour Water into the river. For a brief moment you are perplexed, but decide to take a different approach. Seating yourself in the grass at the edge of the river, you begin to focus on the large star in the sky. You concentrate on the number of rays, seven primary plus fourteen secondary-a total of twenty-one. Closing your eyes, you begin to mentally intone the divine name of Kether, Eheieh, meditating only upon the quiet vibration of the name, and shutting out all else. After vibrating the name for a period of time, the voice of goddess enters your mind. You listen as she speaks: \"Dost thou imagine that thou hast come to this place of thine own accord searching for Wisdom? Nothing is farther from the Truth. I have sought Thee out. I have brought thee here as a fish on the hook of Tzaddi cast into the shadowy ocean-to bring thee into the Light. I seek thee as a bride seeks the groom. I seek thee as a reflection of mine own face in a mirror. \"I am the gate which looks out upon the world and back in at myself. I lead humanity from falsity into Truth-from the separateness of the outer into the wholeness and holiness of the Inner. This I work through Inner vision and hearing. The eyes and ears of the body are concerned only with the veneer of reality. The senses of the Soul perceive far more that is Truth. The seeds of Truth and Wisdom are sown in silence and grow in silence and mystery. Not in confusion and noise is the work of Nature perfected, but in the calm meditation that seeks out thine own true self. Here shalt thou find me reflected. Herein lies the return to the Garden. Herein also is the universe resolved into its ultimate elements under the presidency of the divine ETH.\" When the goddess is done speaking, you open your eyes. She stands there as before, pouring out the essence of the Supernals into the river. As the Water from the vases mix with that of the river, quartz crystals are formed, as though energy is transforming from a fluid into a solid form. This metamorphosis of energy reminds you of your own transformation-from a secular individual into an initiate of the Hermetic mysteries. The vision of the star re-enters your thoughts. You are reminded of the story of Lucifer, not the devil of the Dark Ages, but the beautiful Angel whose name means \"Light Bearer\" identified with the Planet Venus-the Morning and Evening Star. Venus, the physical chakra of the Sephirah, Netzach, hangs in the sky with the other stars. You sit on the river bank a long time, basking in the rays of starlight, filled with inspiration and creativity. The stars multiply into a galaxy.

She then guides you back to the temple of Malkuth. Sandalphon seems particularly pleased to see you after this journey and welcomes you with an embrace worthy of an Archangel. She then closes the portal of Tzaddi. As always you take a few moments of silent communion over the altar flame with Sandalphon. After this journey, such moments of silence seem pregnant with conversation. Finally, bidding her farewell, you salute with the Projection Sign. She in turn gives the Sign of Silence. At this point bring your astral body back to the physical temple around you. Do not hurry. Perform the LBRP with the black end of the wand. Declare the temple duly closed.e The 27th Path of Peh The Sepher Yetzirah calls the 27th Path the Exciting Intelligence, because by it is cre- ated the Intellect of all created Beings under the Highest Heaven. It is therefore a reflection of the sphere of Mars and the path connecting Netzach with Hod. The \"Exciting Intelligence\" refers to the power of this path to arouse sudden change. The Hebrew letter Peh means mouth, which alludes to the power of speech and vibration. This is the first of the reciprocal paths (straddling all three pillars) that the initiate encounters while scaling the paths of the Tree. This most difficult path involves the abrupt and complete destruction (purification) of old \"realities.\" It signifies sudden illumination or realization. The Higher Forces are brought in through this harsh path in order to exhaust the Lower Personality and literally force spiritual growth to take place. The 16th Key of the Tarot The Tower, is attributed to this path. The Magical Title of this card is \"The Lord of the Hosts of the Mighty.\" The path of The Tower is known as \"The Victory over Splendor.\" Venus acting through Mars upon Mer- cury. This gives some indication of the conflict between heart and mind that occurs on this path. Emotion and Desire (Venus) struggle to strike a balance with Intellect (Mercury) using fiery Martial force. This balance must be accomplished before any real spiritual progress can take place. Symbols included within the Tarot card of The Tower are: a stone tower struck by a lightening bolt in the shape of the Mars sigil, two figures falling head- long from the blasted crown of the tower, the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Qlip- poth. The Tower symbolizes the \"1\" consciousness or Personality awareness.

This tower is protected by the Lower Personality from attack by other belief systems which are in dis- agreement with it. Thus it becomes a closed armory, firmly shut against free flow of expression from the outside as well as from the inside. The Tower struck by lightning represents the Ego awareness collapsing under an inflow of force which exposes something of the essence of the Higher Self. Thus the old \"realities\" so cherished by the Lower Personality are changed forever-destroyed for all intents and purposes. Once the Tower has been shat- tered, it must be re-examined. Some remnants of the old Tower may then be re- integrated, while others are discarded. It is up to the initiate to decide.e A JOURNEY ON THE 27TH PATH OF PEHl40 For this ritual the Philosophus will need the robe, nemyss, red sandals and the Outer Wand of Double Power.

Swiftly, the Archangel leads you through the portal of Shin in the Northeast of the temple and up the 31st Path to the temple of Hod. Leaving Sandalphon, you enter the Water temple giving the Neophyte Signs. A great eight-sided room surrounds you. The walls are draped in curtains of orange silk and the floor is covered with glittering Fire opals. The scent of storax is heavy in the Air. In each comer of the room is a statue of the god of Knowledge, given various names and appearances throughout history: Tahuti- Thoth, Enki, Hermes, Mercury, Nabu, Turms, Odin and Cilans, A statue of an her- maphrodite, Hapi, god of the Nile occupies a small shrine in one part of the temple. The ceiling above you is dominated by a large blue sigil of Mercury. Within the circle of the sigil is the image of a cup. Your attention is drawn to the center of the room where eight alternating columns of Water and Fire enclose a small inner sanctuary. There is a blue altar in the middle of this sacred chamber, covered by an apron, upon which is a disc of opal containing the temple flame. In addition, there is a chalice of Water and the Book of Knowledge with the figure of an octagram gracing its cover. To announce your presence in the temple and call forth its inhabitants, you vibrate the divine name Elohim Tzabaoth and the name of the Archangel, Michael. You then call upon the order of Angels known as the Beni Elohim. Finally, you intone the name of the temple itself, Hod. Almost immediately, the great flaming being of Michael appears, just as you remember him from the Path of Shin, clothed in a Fireball of red and orange flames with fingers of flame running the entire length of his body. His vaporous wings form a halo of pure heat around his head, and he carries a large sword, for he is the Prince of Light and the Leader of the Heavenly Hosts. He speaks: \"Behold the Vision of Splendour and the reflection of Mercy! By what sign does thou enter herein?\" You answer by giving the Sign of the Practicus. \"Why hast thou come to this temple of the Perfect and Absolute Intelligence?\" You hold up the Calvary Cross of Ten Squares for the Archangel to see. Satisfied, he changes into a form that is easier for you to approach. The halo of flames vanishes and in its place is a suit of armour, Roman in design, which makes Michael look more like a winged human warrior than a being of living flame. His sword has become a long spear. The Archangel takes you to the right side of the chamber and draws back a portion of the orange drapery to reveal another curtain with the image of The Tower painted upon it. He traces the symbol of Mars and the veil fades into mist. In its place is a door carved from ruby, upon which is the Hebrew letter Peh. Giv- ing the Sign of the Philosophus, you hold out the Cross and trace the form of the letter Peh before the door, which dissolves. Together, you and your guide start down the path.

The grazing is sparse, however, because the land is similar to a high plains desert with meager amounts"},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"The Philosophus Grade 589 of rainfall. Joshua trees, cactus and desert scrub seem to be the norm here, and the arid odor of pepper is in the Air. Eventually, the landscape begins to change, becoming more rocky and mountainous. Even the hardy desert scrub seems unable to get a foothold between the impartial granite slabs of this harsh place. Devoid of even the most durable of Nature's flora, the region looks as though it might just as well be a martian land- scape. The trail seems treacherous, full of potholes and sharp, loose stones that cause you to misstep often. Michael says not a word as he walks effortlessly in front of you, but his protective presence is reassuring. Just ahead of you, behind a craggy hillside, a wondrous image presents itself to your eyes-a great crown which sparkles with many jewels. As you get closer, you see before you an enormously high stone tower with a shining crown at its summit. The mighty fortress looks impenetrable and there are no windows. The path you are traveling leads straight to the entrance of the structure, where two well-worn battering rams have ended their days of combat only to be implanted in the ground as columns-their carved horns and ram-faces chipped and broken in many places. Before these crude pillars two figures hold watch over the entrance. Michael sends you on ahead. From here on you must face whatever awaits you alone, and act upon your own decisions. As you near the tower, you begin to make out the features of the two guardians. The form on the right has a muscular form covered by a red tunic. The piercing eyes of a hawk glare at you from under a nemyss surmounted by the double crown of Egypt. In one hand the swarthy being holds a club, and in the other an iron-tipped spear. The left-hand figure is feminine, also dark in limb, who holds a lotus staff and ankh. She too, wears a tunic of red linen. At your approach, the figures cross their implements, spear to staff, and block your advance. \"Thou canst not enter the Tower of the Vibration of the Word unless thou canst tell us our names,\" they command. You tum to the hawk-headed figure and say, \"Thou art Horus, god of bat- tles, Slayer of Set and the enemies of Ra. Heru the Piecer, Son of the Sun.\" To the left-hand figure you answer, \"Thou art Nephthys, sister of Isis, lady of the invisible, dark goddess of death and life.\" \"In what signs and symbols do ye come?\" They question. Your answer is given in the Sign of the Philosophus. \"In the divine name Elo- him Tzabaoth. In the word Kaph Cheth. And in this symbol of the Sephirotic Cross.\" The figures step back and allow you to pass. A solid oak door stands in your way. You project at it with the Attacking Sign and it opens inward. Giving the Sign of Silence, you enter. Once inside the damp, musky building, you feel a bit closed-in. The tower has been badly neglected and is in need of repair. Cobwebs and dust are every- where. The floorboards are rotten and crumble under your weight. Before you is a stone staircase that looks as though it leads to the crown of the tower. Perhaps there is something of value in this dingy old tower that you need to explore. With renewed confidence you begin the ascent to the top. The stairs are slippery with"},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"590 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN l'RAomoN mold, so you must watch your step. As you climb, you pass armaments of all kinds: cannons, gunpowder, shields, lances, broadswords and more. Apparently, the tower has been under siege for some time, but it is well-fortified and armed to the teeth. Nearing the top of the fortress, you hear sounds of music, dancing and laugh- ter. Who, you wonder, could call such a place as this home? Your Will and curiosity drive you forward. Thrusting open a crumbling door at the top of the stairs, you gaze out onto a richly dressed group of nobles in silken robes and jeweled headpieces. They sit atop the crown of the tower under the shade a raised cloth. They are bloated and immobile from sheer gluttony. A few undernourished servants in rags do their best to minister to the needs and amusements of the group-playing flutes, dancing and bringing food. The only reward of these attendants is disregard at best. The more unfortunate servants receive a kick or fist. The wealthy barons and dukes argue with one another over luxurious trinkets which fall unnoticed to the fall when some new bauble grabs their attention. In front of this opulent group are enormous quantities of food and drink, so much food in fact that some of it appears to be spoiling. Yet tethered to a stone away from the food is a small monkey weak from hunger, with nothing to eat. The pitiful animal, kept only for amusement has obviously been for- gotten like the other court toys. This makes you angry. How dare these people be so neglectful and selfish? Your presence has startled them. They stare at you with absolute astonish- ment. It is as if they have never seen anyone besides themselves in their domain. They seem to consider you an intruder. Frightened, they sound an alarm. From the door behind you and another opening behind the nobles, armored guards come run- ning with raised swords. What you wouldn't give to have Michael by your side now! Before any hands are able to grasp you, there is another sudden commotion. The aristocrats are now frantic because the sun has abruptly disappeared behind a great black cloud. Without warning there is a huge explosion of light and stone. A great bolt of lightning has struck the tower! At the same moment, you hear a roar- ing vibration of sound as if all the Angelic choirs above the Firmament suddenly opened their mouths and uttered the true name of Tetragrammaton. Within an instant there are no longer bricks beneath your feet and you are sailing through the Air. For a moment you are certain that this must be the end of your joumey. As you fall, you yell out, \"AOONAI! I am free from the bonds of Darkness!\" Hands are suddenly there to grasp you. Michael, hearing your cry of will- ing sacrifice, has taken wing to keep you from falling into the void and sharing the fate of the Dukes of Edom. For the Lords of Chaos there is no rescue. From the Archangel's strong arms you watch as the nobles and the tower's crown are swept away in the darkness-into the waiting mouth of Moloch-and the nothingness from whence they came. Fascinated, you can do nothing but watch. A voice enters your mind, and you listen quietly as you learned to do on the Path of Tzaddi: \"1 am the Logos and the mouth that utter it. I beget life and I consume life. I am the Alpha and the Omega. All things which I create return unto me. Do not be mislead by this apparent demolition, for I destroy only to rebuild into a greater design. The Soul of the humankind evolves from this destruction, always growing and fading, changing yet living.

The Fire of Spirit moves and descends into the Fire of Form. Those who feel this divine Fire within their Souls shall ascend to live eternally within the new tower which I alone shall build. The Logos shall be my building stone and the vibration of the Word shall be my mortar.\" You are lying on the ground, but you did not feel the landing. Michael is standing above you smiling. The Archangel offers you his hand and pulls you to your feet. Remembering everything that has happened, you stare at the tower in amazement. The mighty crown which surmounted the structure has been utterly destroyed. Not one of its bricks remain. The entire upper portion of masonry has been knocked away. Three gaping holes have been blown into the wall revealing that the Fire inside the fortress rages on. The openings resemble three blazing roses. Squeezing your shoulder in a gesture of affection, Michael informs you that you have done well on this difficult test. What you rebuild out of the ashes of the Tower struck by Lightning will be far greater than anything you can now imagine. It is up to you to create a better, more balanced structure-discarding pieces of the old tower which are obsolete, while keeping those pieces which are usable. The new tower of the Personality must be built in the image of the Higher Design, using knowledge and compassion, never the one without the other. But for the moment you must return to the temple of Hod. The landscape becomes less rugged and the road widens as you leave the desolate region of the old tower. The desert vegetation returns to view. You feel revi- talized by having survived the ordeal of the Tower. Michael walks beside you now, as if he is more confident of your abilities. A noise off to the right brings your attention to an apple tree beside the path that you had not noticed earlier. The monkey from the tower sits amid the branches, happily munching on a piece of fruit. It is as if the ape of Thoth has been nourished by the blasting of the old fortress. Once again you find yourself back at the Water temple. You are reluctant to leave this place of learning, but you know that what you have accomplished today will take time to fully comprehend. Michael takes you down the path of Shin to the temple of Malkuth. As you say goodbye to the Archangel, he transforms back into his true flaming appearance-the Light of God in the center of the ball of flame. Sandalphon quickly seals the portal of the 31st Path behind you. She fetches a chalice to give you a long cool drink from the fountain. The Ashim are quite noticeable in the temple after your journey on the Path of Peh. They resem- ble Yods of flame dancing above the altar. You enjoy their company awhile before leaving. Finally, you bid goodbye to the inhabitants of the temple and salute with the Projection Sign. Sandalphon gives the Sign of Silence. At this point bring your astral body back to the physical temple around you. Do not hurry. Perform the LBRP with the black end of the wand. Declare the temple duly closed.e"},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"592 SELF-lNfTIATION IN10 1HE GoLDEN DAWN 'fRAomoN AN INVOCATION OF THE ELEMENT OF FIRE For the grade of Philosophus For this ritual the Philosophus will need a black Outer Order robe, black and white striped nemyss, and the Outer Wand of Double Power.

Moreover, this grade is especially referred to the Veil of Paroketh which falls in the Path of Samekh between Yesod and Tiphareth. This time the initiate is brought back squarely to the Middle Pillar and the Way of Balance. The Portal is very much a com- pendium of the earlier grades as well as a completion of them. This is also the final grade in this course of self-initiation. The Portal grade in particular is concerned with the process of inner alchemy-of separating and examining the parts of one's own psychological and spiritual working-in order to balance and merge them again into a more unified whole which makes true spiritual attainment possible. The previous grade entailed the Alchemical processes of analysis and disso- lution wherein the candidate was forced to examine his/her own chaotic inner workings. This included a kind of Alchemic \"exorcism\" if you will, of inner con- flicts and the purging of any excess psychic ''baggage.'' If the aspirant has honestly and diligently pursued the work of introspection and psychic balance that is the core work of the Golden Dawn at this level, then it is assumed that the candidate who has successfully completed the Philosophus grade is ready to begin the Alchemical process of assimilation wherein the purified portions of the aspirant's Elemental self are exalted by an infusion of the Light-giving Spirit and recombined into a balanced \"whole\" which is greater than the sum of its parts. This is the sec- ond half of the solve et coagula formula, where the sublimated Elements begin to coagulate into a more balanced psyche which is consecrated to the work of the Divine Will. This not only makes a higher level of spiritual growth possible, it is in fact the goal of the Alchemists-the procurement of the Philosopher's Stone. The Element encountered in this grade is the fifth and final Element of Spirit. It is the guiding spiritual essence within the aspirant's psyche which tran- scends all of the Qabalistic Worlds. Spirit is the crowning Element which forms the uppermost point of the pentagram, ruling above the Elements of Fire, Water, Air and Earth, and announcing the dominion of the Divine Light over (and permeating throughout) the manifest Kingdom. It is the cornerstone of the magical tradition. Until the initiate receives an influx of this highest Element and makes an initial con- tact with the Higher and Divine Self (sometimes referred to as the Holy Guardian Angel or HGA), all magical workings undertaken will be undermined to a lesser or greater extent due to the fact that they will be under the governance of the ego rather than the guidance of the Angel or spiritual Self. 605"},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"606 SELF-INITIATION INlO THE GoLDEN DAWN l'RAomoN The Portal grade equilibrates all the various portions of the Elemental Self which are symbolically sacrificed upon the altar and submitted to the service of the Higher and Divine Genius. In addition, this grade not only emphasizes the Quintes- sence or Philosophic Mercury, it takes the Alchemical process one step further by focusing on specific Alchemic symbolism to drive the point home. Thus the Portal grade clearly represents a definite stage in the Spagyric Art. The Second and Third Adepts in this ritual bear wands which are surmounted by the Alchemical symbols of sulfur and salt respectively. The Chief Adept (who replaces the Hierophant in this ritual) bears a wand surmounted by a pentagram, to represent collectively the three Alchemic Principles of sulfur, salt and mercury. This points out that the Spirit or Quintessence is more than the union of the four Elements, it is that which contains the three hidden Alchemical Principles. After taking this initiation, it is the duty of the aspirant to expand upon these Three Principles, to separate them from their base, and to engage and comprehend them fully within the consciousness. There are a number of unique aspects to the ceremony of the Portal. Whereas all of the Outer Order grades represent what in the strictest interpreta- tion of the Golden Dawn calls the \"First Degree,\" the Portal is referred to the \"Sec- ond Degree.\" This is also the first time throughout all of the initiations that the candidate is formally presented with the white pillar. Up until this point the initi- ate has been working with the black pillar which represents the Outer Order. A primary theme in the Portal Ceremony is the candidate's coming out of Darkness into the Light. Only after the Darkness of the black pillar (i.e., the initiate's lower personality symbolized in the Elemental grades) has been explored and synthe- sized can the white pillar be safely approached. There is also a curious mixture of both Outer Order and Inner Order officers present in this grade. This is because in the traditional scheme of the Golden Dawn, the Portal grade occupies a position ''between the worlds,\" so to speak, between the Golden Dawn and the R.R. et A.c. It partakes of both, and yet is a part of neither. As already stated, the Hierophant has been replaced by the Chief Adept in this cere- mony. (In the earlier grades the Inner Order was represented by the Dais officers, and the Hierophant acted as an intermediate between the Inner and the Outer. Here there is no need for an intermediate officer-the Inner Order officers are full partic- ipants in this rite.) The Hiereus and the Hegemon are all that remain of the Outer Order initiatory team. These officers are in charge of the secondary Elements of Air and Earth while the 2nd and 3rd Adepts are in charge of the primary Elements of Fire and Water. (These four officers also correspond to the four pillars which were established within the aspirant's sphere of sensation in the Neophyte Ceremony.) The Chief Adept is in charge of the crowning Element of Spirit. (This officer corre- sponds to the white triangle of Supernal Light that was established in the Neo- phyte's aura.) Whereas the Neophyte grade was the Alpha stage of the initiatory process, the Portal is the Omega stage, crowning and completing the operation. The four previous grades referred to the Sub-Elements of Malkuth in Assiah. The Portal grade emphasizes Yesod of Yesod in Assiah."},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"The Portal Grade 607 The Portal Sash The plain white sash is a symbol of the initiate's attainment to the Second Degree. It fits over the candidate's right shoulder (crossing the black sash). While the black sash symbolized the watery current of the black pillar, the white sash alludes to the Fiery current of the white pillar. The Portal Implements The Portal grade employs wands and lamens that are unique to this grade. The wand and sword of the Hegemon and the Hiereus are the same as in all of the pre- vious grades, however the wands of the remaining officers and all of the Lamens needed are different. These are described in detail later in this chapter.P! The Portal ceremony can be summarized as follows: After the standard (self-initiatory) rite of opening, the temple is in darkness, reminiscent of the dark- ness of Edom. Light is then brought into the temple from behind the Veil. By the word Paroketh, the Veil is opened and the four Elements are invoked into the four quarters of the temple (and into the cross of the Elements). The fifth Element of Spirit is invoked last to complete the other four. After an Adoration to the Lord of the Universe, the Veil is then closed. The next part of the ceremony is called the Ritualof the Cross and the Four Elements. The candidate swears further oaths and must prove that s/he has grasped the secrets (signs and words) of all the preceding Elemental grades. The aspirant then circumambulates the hall with each respective Element (of the four lesser Elements) while vibrating the appropriate Elemental names and making the appropriate signs and figures. (Thus the candidate re-establishes the four Elements of the cross within his/her sphere of sensation and equilibrates them.) The symbol- ism of certain diagrams is also explained, including: The Cross of Four Triangles, the Circle and Point, the symbol of Malkuth, the Great Hermetic Arcanum, the Vision of Nebuchadnezzar, V.I.T.R.I.O.L., and the Seraphim in the Vision of Isaiah. The next part of the ritual is known as the Riteof the Pentagram and the Five Paths. Here the candidate attempts to traverse five paths which lead to higher levels of the Tree of Life (the 21st, 24th, 25th, 26th, and 23rd Paths). The aspirant attempts the Path of Kaph but is barred from undertaking it. The Path of Nun is then partially traversed and the Tarot card of the Death and a diagram of Typhon are revealed. The aspirant then attempts the Path of Mem but is barred from venturing upon it. The Path of Ayin is then partially traversed and the Tarot card of the Devil and a diagram of Pan are unveiled. The candidate, wearing the Cross of the Four Elements, advances to the Veil by the balanced Path of Samekh. In the word Paroketh, the initiate rends the Veil and offers up the Elemental portions of him/her self upon the white altar by burning a small portion of the Elemental symbols in a small cauldron. This signals the aspirant's willingness to consecrate his/her life to the service of the Divine. 141 The construction of these implements is described in our book Secrets ofa Golden Dawn Temple."},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"608 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN 'fRAomoN Also burned is the candidate's magical motto. (A new motto will be employed after this grade.) The aspirant is then formally presented with the white pillar and the sash of the grade. The Secrets of the Portal grade are revealed, along with the crowning Element of Spirit and the Enochian Tablet of Union. Two forms of the Temperance Card from the Tarot (the 25th Path) are shown. The importance of striking a bal- ance between opposing forces is stressed. Certain symbols are explained further, including the Hierophant's Lamen, the Banner of the East, and the Chief Adept's Lamen. Finally the powers of the Elements are released. Five officers are stationed in the Portal Hall in the form of a cross with the altar just below the \"crossbar\" (the station of the Hegemon). The Outer Order offi- cers who represent Earth and Air (Hiereus and Hegemon) form the\" shaft\" of the cross in the West and center of the Hall respectively. The Chief Adept's station is at the top of this shaft in the East (Tiphareth), indicating that within the candidate's psyche, Spirit must be firmly grounded in Earth, while the reconciling Element of Air is ever at the point of balance. The 2nd Adept, who represents the Element of Fire and the white pillar is stationed in the South (Netzach), while the 3rd Adept who symbolizes the powers of Water and the black pillar is stationed in the North (Hod). (These officers too, are balanced by the Hegemon and the Element of Air in Yesod.) It is important to keep in mind however, that some of these officers are not stationed by their respective Element. The Hiereus is stationed in the West (Malkuth), but must move to the North when necessary to work with the Element of Earth. Likewise the 3rd Adept is stationed in the North (Hod), but must move to the West whenever a working of the Element of Water is called for. During key parts of the ritual the Elemental officers move to form a cross around the altar- each officer on the side of the altar that corresponds to the appropriate Element. When the Chief Adept (Spirit) joins the other four, s/he takes up a position just West of the altar-stepping between the altar and the 3rd Adept. Thus standing, they form the Greek Cross of Five Squares (or the Cross of the Blementsj.e The Godforms of the Portal Grade As mentioned in Chapter Two, the various \"traditional\" godforms that exist in the grades beyond that of Neophyte are not set and carved in stone. Therefore the god- forms that we have chosen to represent the various Elements in the Portal grade are not the only possible ones that may be used. The godforms listed below, however, correspond with the Elemental Deities first hinted at in the Theoricus Ceremony given in Chapter Three. SERAPIS: The godform of the Hiereus and the deity associated with Elemental Earth. Serapis has a man's body and the head of a bull. The skin of the god is black and he wears the Solar disk and a uraeus between his crescent horns. His tunic is white bordered with black and his pectoral collar is banded red, yellow and blue.

Serapis is seated upon a throne of black ornamented with white, and stands upon a pavement of black and white squares. NUET: The godform of the Hegemon and the deity associated with Elemental Air. Nuet has the head and body of a golden-skinned woman. Upon her head she wears the crescent horns and solar disk surmounted by a vase of Water. In one hand she bears an ankh, and in the other either a yellow Lotus Wand or the miter- headed wand of the Hegemon. The goddess wears a tunic of violet ornamented with yellow stars. Her pectoral collar is banded black, red, and blue. Her nemyss is striped yellow and violet and her wristbands are banded yellow and violet. Nuet is seated on a throne of yellow ornamented with violet, and stands upon a pavement of black and white squares. TEFNUT: The godform of the 3rd Adept and the deity associated with Elemental Water. Tefnut has the body of a woman and the head of a lioness. Upon her head she wears the Solar disk encircled by a serpent. Her skin is blue and she wears an orange tunic. Her pectoral collar is banded yellow, black and red. The Goddess wears a nemyss striped blue and orange and her wristbands are banded blue and orange. In one hand she bears an ankh, and in the other either a blue Lotus Wand or the salt-headed wand of the 3rd Adept. Tefnut is seated on a throne of blue ornamented in orange, and stands upon a pavement of black and white squares. MAU: The godform of the 2nd Adept and the deity associated with Elemental Fire. Mau has the body of a man and the head of a male cat. Upon his head he wears the Solar disk encircled by a serpent. His skin is red and his tunic is green. His pectoral collar is banded blue, yellow and black. The god wears a nemyss striped red and green, and his wristbands are banded red and green. In one hand he bears an ankh, and in the other either a red Lotus Wand or the Sulphur-headed wand of the 2nd Adept. Mau is seated on a throne of red ornamented with green, and stands upon a pavement of black and white squares. OSIRIS: The godform of the Chief Adept and the deity associated with Elemen- tal Spirit. Osiris has a human head, and wears a nemyss striped white and yel- low/ surmounted by the white Stenu crown of the Upper Regions. He is mummy-wrapped in white except for his head and hands. His pectoral collar is banded white, red, blue, yellow, black. His wristbands are banded yellow and white. Osiris bears a white Djed Wand or a white pentagram-headed scepter of the Chief Adept. The god sits upon a Throne of white ornamented in yellow, which stands upon a white pavement.e"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"610 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON THE PORTAL CEREMONY Temple setup: The aspirant will need to set up the Hall beforehand in accordance with the temple diagram. The black cubical altar is placed in the center of the room. Upon it should be placed rose petals, several incense sticks (preferably sticks that are solid incense, so that they can be easily broken up), a cup of Water and a platter of salt (in the East, South, West and North respectively) around the symbol of a five-squared Greek Cross. A hook suspended from the ceiling by a string, should be positioned over the center of the black altar. In the Eastern part of the Hall is the Veil of Parokethw behind which is a white altar and the two pillars. On the white altar should be placed the Tablet of Union, the Lamen of the Hierophant, a brazier or small cauldron containing char- coal, matches, a small pentacle, a plain white votive candle, a container of pow- dered incense, and a piece of paper whereon is written the aspirant's motto. All four Elemental Tablets are placed in their respective quarters. The Hebrew letter Samekh is shown on a large plaque in the East, hanging above the center of Paroketh. Also in the East, but occupying a lower position to the left and right of Samekh are the letters Mem, Ayin, Nun and Kaph. Tau is in the West. The Banner of the East is before the Veil, while the Banner of the West is located near the station of the Hiereus. Place the lamens and implements in accordance with the temple diagram, in the positions of the officer-forms. The station of the Chief Adept is behind the Veil, while the stations of Second and Third Adept are in front of Paroketh, to the right and left respectively. The Hegemon is just East of the altar and the Hiereus is stationed in the West. As in the previous rituals, all of the Elemental candles should be placed around the circumference of the room, with a white candle in the East. (Note: At the beginning of this ritual all candles except for the white Spirit candle are to be unlit.) Have the following diagrams close at hand. In the West: The Maltese Cross, the Circle and the Point, and the symbol of Malkuth. In the East near the throne of Hegemon: The Great Hermetic Arcanum, the two forms of the Temper- ance card. In the North: The Tarot card of the Devil, Pan, the Vision of Nebuchad- nezzar, and the diagram of Vitriol. In the South: the Death card, Typhon, and the Seraphim and Kerubim. (Note: For a later segment of the ritual, the aspirant will need the Hiereus Lamen Admission Badge and a white sash which fits over the right shoulder. Leave the white sash in the Eastern part of the Hall.) Ritual preparations: The aspirant should fast for a period of twelve hours prior to the ritual. A ritual bath is required after which the aspirant may put on the black Tau robe, back sash, and red slippers. The aspirant must meditate for a certain length of time on the symbol of the Spirit wheel in white. Next s/he must spend a period of time (20-30 minutes) 142 See Secrets of a Golden Dawn Temple."},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":"Paroketh Veil ...

Now, the point has no dimension, but in moving, it traces the line. This gives thefirst number-unity-yet therein, lies dual- ity unmanifest, for two points mark its ends.

Say: In this diagram is shown the occult symbol of Malkuth, the tenth Sephirah. It is in four parts, corresponding to the Maltese Cross. They are Fire of Earth, Water of Earth, Air of Earth, Earth of Earth, as is indicated by the symbol. They correspond to thefour grades oj the First Order, which in one sense, quitteth not Malkuth, being the grades ofthefour lowest Sephiroth of Malkuth in Assiah. Upon them is surcharged a white hexagram in a circle. The six and thefour make ten, the number of Malkuth on the Tree. The hexagram is also the sign of the Macrocosm-Qf Tiphareth, and of the six upper Sephiroth, wherefore here it is white-Spirit ruling over matter. Six isa perfect number, for its whole equals thesum of its parts. Six are the middle points of the planes bounding a cube, which derives from the square, and from the cross, if the center point moves outwards. In these numbers and figures are hid many revelations. The whole num- ber of Malkuth is 496-which is again a perfect number.

But the Kerubim of Ezekiel have each four faces-those of the Lion, the Bull, the Man and the Eagle counterchanged with each other by revolu- tion, whence the symbolic forms of the wheels beside them, wherein was the Spirit; and with two of the wings they covered their bodies and two were stretched upwards one to another. So the synthesis of the Kerubim is found in the revolving cross, in the pentagram, and in the idea of one Spirit dominating four Elements. But the Kerubim of St. John's vision in the Apocalypse are uncom- pounded, havingsingle heads, but they have six wings and thus unite the powers of the seven with the four.

One of the heads wears a"},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"634 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN 1'RAomoN kingly crown; another is apparently thatofa person of little note, shawing that Death is the equalizer ofall conditions. The five extremities, the head, hands and feet, allude to the pouiers of the number five, the letter Heh, the pentagram-the concealed Spiritof Life andthefour Elements-the orig- inator ofallliving form. The Sign of Scorpio especially alludes to stagnant and foetid Water-that property of the moist nature which initiates putre- faction and decay. The eternal change from life into death through death into life, is symbolized by the grass which springs from and is nourished by putrefying and corrupting carcasses; the herbage, in its tum affords food to animals and man, which again when dead, nourisheth vegetable lifeand bringto grawth and perfection the living herbage. This isfurther shoum by the figure itself putrefying and decaying as it reaps the grass of the field. \"As for man,his days are as grass, asa flotuer of the field, so he flourisheth.\" The top of the scythe forms the Tau Cross of Life, shawing that what destroys also renews. The whole is a representation of the eternal transmutation of the life of nature, which reforms all things into fresh images and similitudes. This symbol represents the corrosive and destructive action of the infernal Fire as opposed to the Celestial-the Dragon of the Waters, the Typhon of the Egyptians, the Slayer of Osiris-which later yet rises again in Horus. The Scorpion, Serpent of Evil, delineated before the figure of Death in the more ancient form of the Key, refers to the mixed and transforming, therefore deceptive, nature of this emblem. Behind him, is the symbol of the Name- less One, representing the Seed and its germ, not yet differentiated into Life, therefore incapable of definition. The Scorpion is the emblem of ruth- less destruction; the Snake is the mixed and deceptive nature, serving alike for good and evil; the Eagle is the Higher and Divine Nature, yet to be found herein, the Alchemical Eagle of distillation, the Renewer of life. As it is said:-\"Thy youth shall be renewed like the Eagles.\" Great indeed, and many are the mysteries of this terrible Key.\" The figures of the 2nd Adept and the Hiereus direct your attention to the diagram of Typhon. Observing the diagram you say: This drawing represents the symbolic figure of Typhon, the Destroyer. The eleven circles represent the eleven Averse Sephiroth. He stands upon Earth and Ocean, his head lost in the clouds, a colossal image of evil and destruction. The brotu denotes the confusion of opposing Elemental Forces in the higher regions of the Air, and confusion of mind and madness in man. The eyes are the devouring flames oflust andviolence-the breath is storm, devastation and rage, alike in the universe which is the greater world, and in manwhois the lesser.

The 24th Path of the Sepher Yetzirah to which the Tarot Key of Death is referred is the Imaginative Intelligence, andit is so called because it giveth form to all similitudes which are created in like manner similar to its har- monious elegances. For the outward form always follows the hidden law, thus from chaos is produced harmony, just as a beautiful flower is pro- duced from decaying matter. Mauspeaks: Return now to Yesod, for here no more may be spoken. 635 Go clockwise to the station of Hegemon where the godform of Nuet confronts you and says: Approach now the station of Hod by the Path of Resh, the Sun.

The goddess Tefnut speaks to you: Already the sash of the black pillar is upon you-already you have passed the dark Path of Tau. What more do you seek of me, Lord(Lady) of the 1st Degree? You answer, \"I seek the Path of Mem, the Path of Sacrifice.\" The officer / godform of Hiereus gives a knock. Sarapis speaks: Be warned, 0, vainglorious one.

Tefnut speaks: The Portal of Mem is barred. Yet it is well to be willing for the Sacri- fice itself, if as yet, not fully prepared. For in the Path of Mem rules the Hanged man, the power of the Great Waters. Can your tears prevail against the TIde of the Sea, your might against the waves of the storm, your love against the sorrows of all the world?

Tefnut speaks: Thus far and no farther are you permitted to penetrate the Path of Ayin. The mysteries may now be partially revealed. She leads you to the Tarot Key of the Devil in the North. Observe the diagram and say: The 15th Key of the Tarot represents a goat-headed, satyr-like Demon whose legs are hairy-his feet and claws, standing upon a cubical altar. He has heavy bat-like wings. In hisleft hand, which points downwards, he holds a lighted torch, and in his right, which is elevated, a horn of Water. The left hand points dawnwards to show that it is the infernal and burn- ing, not the celestial and lifegiving flame which is kindled in his torch- just as when the Sun is in Capricornus, to which cold and earthy Sign this Key corresponds, Solar light is at its weakest and the natures of cold and moisture triumph over heat and dryness. The cubical altar represents theuniverse-right andleftofit, bound thereto by a cord attached to a cir- cle which typifies the center of the Earth, are two smaller demons, one male and one female. They hold a cord in their hands. The whole figure shaws the gross generative potoers of nature on the material plane, and is analogous to the Pan of the Greeks and Egyptian Goat of Mendes (the symbol of Khem). In certain aspects, this Key represents the brutal forces of nature, which to the unbelieving man only obscure and do not reflect the luminous Countenance of God. It also alludes to the sexual powers of natural generation. Thus therefore the Keyfitly balances the symbol of Death on the other side of the Tree of Life. Of the smaller demons, one points doumuiards and one upwards, answering to the positions of the hands of the central figures. Beneath hisfeet are pentagrams on which he tramples (whence comes their title of Wizard's foot> and his head is cov- ered with theeviland reversed pentagram. As his hands bear the torch and horn-the symbols of Fire and Water, so does his form unitethe Earth in his hairyand bestial aspect, and the Air in his bat-like wings. Thus he repre- sents the gross and materialized Elemental Forces of nature; and the whole would bean evil symbol, were it notfor the pentagram of Light above his head which regulates and guides his movements. He is the eternal renewer ofallthe changingforms of Creation in conformity with the Law of theAll- Pawerful One (Blessed be He) which controlling law is typified by the con-"},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":"The Portal Grade 637 trolling pentagram of Light surmounting the whole. This Key isan emblem of tremendous force; manyand universal are its mysteries. The god Sarapis directs your attention to the diagram of Pan. Observe the dia- gram and say: This drawing represents the symbolic figure of Pan, the Greek god of Nature. He stands upon the cube of the universe, holding in his right hand the pastoral staffof rural authority, and in his left the seven-reeded pipe symbolical of the harmony of the Planetary spheres. The nine circles represent the Sephiroth with the exception of Kether, exactly those which are included in the symbol on the Tree of Life. The ruddy face is the heat of the Earth-the horns are the rays-the body contains the Elements and the cube is thefirm basis. Observe that the higher part of the figure is human, growing more bestial as it nears the Earth. The 26th Path of the Sepher Yetzirah, to which the Tarot Key of the Devil is referred, is called the Renovating Intelligence, because, by it, God the Holy One reneweth all the changing forms which are renewed by the cre- ation of the world. Tefnut speaks: Return again to Yesod. for here no more may be spoken. Go to the West of the altar facing East. Visualize the officer/ godforms of 2nd and 3rd Adepts back at their stations, right and left of the Veil. The officer/ godform of Hegemon is at your right side, while the Hiereus is on your left. Sarapis speaks to you: In guardianship and not in enmity, have I barred your venturing, 0 Philosophus. Now may it be revealed how in the Lamen of the Hiereus is hidden the Key which you seek. Observe the Admission Badge and say: The triangle in the circle is the high symbol ofthe Holy Trinity, and thefirst three Sephiroth, andof Binah wherein is the sphere of Saturn, Ruler of the Path Tau. Therefore it is worn by the Hiereus, and when I entered the Hall of the Neophytes in the 0 = 0 grade, I beheld the sword that barred andthe symbol which overcometh the barrier. The lamen in its more special attribution to the Hiereus, has the following meanings. In the circle are thefour Sephiroth of Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod and Yesod. The first three mark the angles of the triangle inscribed within,"},{"pageNumber":663,"pageContent":"638 SELF-INITIATION INTO TIlE GoLDEN DAWN 1'RAomoN while the sides are the Paths of Nun, Ayin and Peh, respectively. In the center is marked the letter Samekh indicating the 25th Path. While the wheel revolves, thehub is still. Ever shall I seek the center, look- ing from without to within. This is the Key of my path. Nuet directs your attention to the Portals in the East and says: Five paths are before you-four have you attempted and each was guarded by a symbol sinister and dread. (Say:) In the 1 = 10 grade it was revealed that above Malkuth were the Paths Qoph, Shin, Tau,-Qesheth, the Bow of promise. From the many colored Bow, is loosed in Yesod, the Arrow of Sagittarius-Samekh, soar- ing upwardto cleave open the Veil unto the Sun in Tiphareth. Thus it is a fit symbolfor hope and aspiration, for in the Sign Sagittarius, Jupiter, Ruler of Kaph is Lord. Thus, by this straight and narrow way only, is advance between the dangers that have threatened me possible. Tefnut speaks: But Sagittarius, the Archer, is a bi-corporate Sign-the Centaur, the Man and the Horse combined. Recall what was said in the 3 = 8 grade of Practicus. You continue: \"Also there is the vision of the Fire flashing Courser of Light, or also a child borne aloft upon the shoulders of the Celestial Steed, fiery or clothed with gold, or naked and shootingfrom the bow, shafts of Light, and standing on the shoulders of a horse. But, if thy meditation prolongeth itselfthou shalt unite all these symbols in theform of a lion.\" For thus will I cleave upward by the Path of Sagittarius, through the Sixth Sephirah into the PathofTeth, answering to Leo, the Lion-the rec- oncilingpath between Mercyand Severity, Chesed and Geburah, beneath whose center hangs the glorious Sun of Tiphareth. Therefore, by the straight and narrow Path of Sagittarius, I shall advance, like the arrow from the center of Qesheth, the Bow. And as this Sign of Sagittarius lieth between the Sign of Scorpio-Death and Capricornus the devil, so had Jesus to pass through the Wilderness, tempted by Satan.

The earlier figure was considered not so much a representation of this path alone, as the synthesis of thatand the others conjoined. The later figure, therefore, is better adapted to the more restricted meaning. The more ancient form shows a female figure crowned with the crown of five rays, symbolizing thefive Principles of Nature, the concealed Spirit and thefour Elements of Earth, Air, Water and Fire. About her head is a halo of Light. On her breast is theSun of Tiphareth. The five-rayed crown further alludes to the Five Sephiroth Kether, Chokmah, Binah, Chesed and Geburah. Chained to herwaist are a Lion andan Eagle, between which is a large cauldron whence arise steam and smoke. The Lion represents the"},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"644 SELF-INITIATION INTO 1HE GoLDEN DAWN TRADmON Fire in Netzach-the Blood of the Lion; andthe Eagle represents the Water in Hod, the Gluten ofthe Eagle-whose reconcilement is made by theAir in Yesod, unitingwiththe volatilized Water arisingfrom the cauldron through the influence of the Fire beneath it. The chains which link the Lion andthe Eagle to her waist, are symbolic of the Paths of Scorpio and Capricornus as shown by the Scorpion andthe Goat in the background. In her right hand, she bears the Torch of Solar Fire elevating and volatilizing the Water in Hod by the Fiery influence of Geburah, while with her left hand, she pours from a vase the Waters of Chesed to temperate and calm the Fires of Netzach. This later form is the usual figure of Temperance, symbolizing in a more restricted form than the preceding, the peculiar properties of this path. It represents an Angelwith the Solar emblem ofTiphareth on her brow, and wings of the aerial and volatilizing nature, pouring together the fluidic Fire andthe Fiery Water-thus combining, harmonizing and temperating those opposing Elements. One foot rests on dry and volcanic land, in the background of which is a volcano whence issues an irruption. The other foot is in the Water by whose border springs fresh vegetation, contrasting strongly with the arid anddry nature of the distant land. On her breast is a square, the emblem of rectitude. The whole figure is a representation of that straight and narrow way of which it is said 'Jew there be that find it\" which alone leads to the higher and glorified life. For to pursue that steady and tranquil mean between two opposing force, is indeed difficult, and many are the temptations to turn aside either to the right orto theleft-wherein are but to be found the men- acing symbols of Death andthe Devil. The 25th Path of the Sepher Yetzirah to which the Tarot Key ofTemper- ance is referred, is called the Intelligence of Probation, and it is so called because it is the primary temptation by which the Creator tries all right- eous persons. That is, that in it, there is ever present the temptation to turn aside to the one hand or to the other. Take up the cup from the West and the red lamp from the South. Return to the altar and stand in the Sign of the Tau Cross, holding the cup in the left hand and the lamp in the right. Say: Only in and by the reconciliation of opposing forces is the pathway made to true occult knowledge and practical power. Good alone is mightyand Truth alone shall prevail. Evilis but weakness andthe power ofevil magic exists but in the contest of unbalanced forces, which in the end, will destroy and ruin him who hath subjugated himself thereto.

Both refer in natural succession of numbers to the six following thefive. Thus all progress is by steps, gradual and secure. The inner revelation may come suddenly to some, even in the twinkling of an eye or it may be after long waiting, yet ever the liquid must be prepared to the point of saturation. Observe the Hierophant's lamen and say: The Hierophant's lamen is a synthesis of Tiphareth, to which the Calvary Cross of Six Squares, forming the cube opened out,isfitly referred. The two colors, red and green, the most active andthe most passive, whose conjunc- tion points out the practical application of the knowledge of equilibrium, are symbolic of the reconciliation of the celestial essences of Fire and Water, for the reconciling yellow unites with blue in green, which is the complemen- tary color to red, andwith red in orange which is the complementary color to blue. The small inner circle placed upon the cross alludes to the rose that is conjoined therewith in the symbolism of the rose and cross. Observe the Banner of the East and say: The field of the Banner of the East is white, the color of Light and purity. As in the previous case, the Calvary Cross of Six Squares is the number six of Tiphareth, the yellow cross of the Solar gold, and the cubical stone bearing in its center the sacred Tau of Life, and having bound together upon it the form of the Macrocosmic hexagram, the red triangle of Fire and the blue triangle of Water-the Ruach Elohim andthe Waters ofCre- ation. The six angles of the hexagram described upon the Tree of Life will yield the Planets referred to it: DAATH-Saturn, CHESED-Jupiter, GEBURAH-Mars, NETZACH-Venus, HOD-Mercury, YES OD- Luna, while in the center is theSun ofTiphareth.

It may bea triangle, a cross, a pentagram, etc. Read the speeches carefully, and read them often aloud. Note that some speeches are designed to create atmosphere by their archaic form and should be read rhythmically and sonorously, while others are informative and should be read in such a way as to make their points clear. Examples of archaic passages are challenges of the gods: \"Thou canst not pass the Gate of the Western Heaven unless thou canst tell me my name.\" And the speeches of the Kabiri in the grades of Practicus and Philosophus. Information is given in speeches about Tarot Keys and diagrams. 147 Regardie's The Golden Dawn, pages 87-94.

Finally, and most importantly, take into consideration your own personal feelings, experiences and perceptions of what took place in each of your initiations and during the months spent in each particular grade.e The Crosses t Make a list and drawings of the crosses which you have used as Admission Badges throughout the grades, from the Swastika of the Zelator to the Five-Squared Cross worn about the neck in the Por- tal grade. In addition, read all information about them in the ritu- als and the Knowledge Lectures and write a brief paper on them.e A Drawing of the Tree of Life This should be done fairly large in order that the writing and sym- bols should be clear. It is essential to show the deity names, names of Archangels and Angels in Hebrew in the Sephiroth, and to num- ber the paths and give their attributions. Apart from this, the Tree should be your personal synthesis of the Golden Dawn symbolism as it applies to the Tree of Life. The drawing may be colored.o Control of the Aura O If the initiate is not already familiar with the parts of the human body such as the nervous system, respiratory system, and diges- tive system, obtain a simple text book such as Gray's Anatomy, so that before starting to work on the subtle body, the student may know something about the physical body. The physical body is interpenetrated by a subtle body or aura which also surrounds the physical body like an egg of Light. You should now begin to prac- tice controlling this aura or sphere of sensation. This includes attempting to keep all emotional reactions under conscious control. Instead of automatically liking this and disliking that, the student should strive to understand the mechanism which underlies these feelings. For assistance in this, the study of human psychology is recommended. (See the list of books recommended at the end of this chapter.) Having built up some idea of the mechanism of the mental processes, try to make yourself negative or positive at will towards people or ideas. If you are likely to meet someone who always makes you argumentative and irritable, decide that your aura is closed to their power of irritating you and that your mind will not be disturbed by what they say. Being able to listen without comment to someone whose views you disagree with is good practice which helps to control"},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"650 SELF-INITIATION IN10 THE GoLDEN DAWN l'RAomoN your emotions. In this way, you can also come to understand just how much of your dislike is due to prejudice or personal factors, and how much is due to your regard for abstract truth. Practice opening your aura to other people or ideas in an endeavor to see things from another point of view. The practice of deep breathing (like the practices recommended in Chap- ter Three) is also of help in establishing balance and controlling nervousness. One such practice is to expand the chest to its fullest extent and then expand the diaphragm below the ribs as well and finally let the breath out slowly and steadily on a vowel sound such as \"ah\" or \"oh.\" If you are nervous, you will find that your breathing is shallow and that your muscles are tense. You tend to clench your hands and tighten up the abdom- inal muscles. To cure this, take a deep breath to full capacity, hold it while tensing and relaxing alternately the abdominal muscles. Practice the tensing and relaxing of the muscles three times and then relax completely into a chair. Allow your mus- cles to go limp and let your breath out to the last gasp. Do the whole process three times, if necessary. It is designed to stimulate the solar plexus which is the heart of the nervous system (which governs emotion). Another good exercise is to say the deity names aloud. Take a deep breath and say them softly, smoothly and slowly, imagining all the while that your voice travels out to the confines of the Universe. This can be done in conjunction with the Pentagram Ritual.e The Tree of Life in the Aura In the aura which interpenetrates and surrounds the physical body, the magician regularly builds up a replica of the Tree of Life. The Pil- lar of Severity is on the magician's right side, the Pillar of Mercy is on the left, and the Pillar of Mildness is in the center of the body. The astral construction of the Middle Pillar within the initiate's body should be practiced regularly as part of a lifelong spiritual routine. THE EXERCISE OF THE MIDDLE PILLAR (This exercise can be performed either standing, siting, or lying down.) After a few minutes of relaxation, imagine a sphere of white Light just above your head. Vibrate the name \"EHEIEH\" (I am). Keep vibrating this word until it is the only thought in your conscious mind. Then imagine a shaft of light descending from your Kether center to your Daath center at the nape of the neck."},{"pageNumber":676,"pageContent":"The Tree of Life in the Aura 651"},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"652 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoWEN DAWN TRADmON Form a sphere of Light at the Daath center. Vibrate the name \"YHVH ELOHIM\" (the Lord God). Intone the name until it is the only thing in your conscious mind. Bring a shaft of Light down from the Daath center to the TIphareth center around your heart. Form a sphere of Light there. Vibrate the name \"YHVH ELOAH VE- DAATH\" (Lord God of Knowledge) several times until it fills your consciousness. See the shaft of Light descending from TIphareth into the Yesod center in the genital region. Imagine a sphere of Light formed there. Intone the name \"SHADDAI EL CHAI\" (Almighty Living God) several times as before. Visualize the shaft of Light descending from Yesod into your Malkuth center at the feet and ankles. Vibrate the name \"ADONAI HA ARETZ\" (Lord of Earth) a num- ber of times as before. Imagine the Middle Pillar complete. Then circulate the Light you have brought down through the Middle Pillar around the outside of your body to strengthen your aura. Using the cycles of breathing, bring the Light up the right side of the body and down the left, from Malkuth to Kether and back again. After performing this for a short period of time, imagine the ribbon of Light descending down the front of your body and rising up your back. Still employing rhythmic breathing, visualize the shaft of Light rising up the Mid- dle Pillar in the center of your body. When it reaches Kether, imagine a shower of Light surrounding the outside of your body as it descends to Malkuth again. Cir- culate the Light in this manner for some time. Then see the Light rise again in a ribbon that spirals round the outside of your body. Finally focus some of the energy back into your TIphareth center, the seat of equi- librium and balance. You may decide to end the exercise with the Qabalistic Cross to indicate that you have called down the Light of your Kether and balanced it in your aura. Then let your imagination dwell on the aura and see it oval and clear, pulsating with the glow from Tiphareth. (Note: this simple exercise of Middle Pillar is the basis for many complex formulas of magic.) If you are called to see anyone who is ill, depressed, or who has a depressing effect on you, you should perform this exercise beforehand. You may also imagine that your aura is hardened at the edge, so that the person is unable to penetrate it and deplete you of vitality. It is better at first to keep your aura to yourself, rather than try to flow out towards other. Unless you are particularly vital and well-balanced, you will only waste energy. Modes of healing should be tabled for the time being. Such methods have a"},{"pageNumber":678,"pageContent":"The Portal Grade 653 technique of their own and require trained and balanced minds and bodies to carry them out. The initiate is advised to \"get right\" with him/her self before interfering in any way with others. When you have practiced the exercise of the Middle Pillar for some time and can visualize easily, you can establish the other Sephiroth within your aura by vibrat- ing the deity names. The exercise of the Middle Pillar can be done as an alternative to the Pentagram Ritual as a preparation for meditation.c Tattwas and Triangles D As already stated in Chapter Five, we feel that the Tattwas are a foreign addition to the Order teachings, which have little in com- mon with the rest of the Golden Dawn system. Study of the Tattwas within our Order today is considered as an elective. Rather than using the Tattwas, we encourage our students to employ the symbols of the Spirit Wheel and the Elemental trian- gles. These forms will provide the student with completely integrated Golden Dawn symbols for skrying and meditative work. Students are examined on their ability to skry with the Western Elemental symbols, just as in Mather's day when Inner Order members were examined in their proficiency to produce Tattwa visions. (Thus most skrying work takes place in the Adept grades.) In the Portal grade, however, the student is free to choose between which emblems to skry with- the Elemental symbols of the West (the triangles) or of those of the East- the Tattwas. (Both forms are shown in Chapter Five.) Here we will provide only the most basic techniques for skrying with the emblems. . This technique can be described as a form of auto-hypnosis which employs symbols as doorways into controlled astral visions. They are lucid, sig- nificant and conscious visions wherein the practitioner maintains all powers of Will, choice and judgment. Creating visions in this fashion also enables the aspi- rant to tap into the deepest levels of the universal consciousness. These symbols are designed to assist you in your researches into the Soul of Nature. They should never be allowed to become uncontrolled day-dreams. The method taught should be strictly adhered to-a definite time, preferably in the morning, should be set aside for this practice, once a week. The exercise should not be attempted when one is tired or preoccupied. Notes of the pictures and symbols seen should be kept together in a book. The student should construct all of the Elemental symbols and have a set of them for working. The Elemental symbol should be made about 2.5 or 3 inches in height and painted in the appropriate colors on 3 x 5 note cards. (Compound Ele- ments, which indicate the Sub-Element suchasAir of Water, are depicted by painting a smaller emblem, symbolic of the Sub-Element in the center of the larger, primary Element. There are five primary Elements and twenty-five Sub-Elements.)"},{"pageNumber":679,"pageContent":"654 SELF-INII1ATION INIO 1HE GoLDEN DAWN TRADmON The method for using the symbols is as follows: Have one of the symbol cards and a white sheet of paper handy. Perform the LBRP. Then be seated in a relaxed and calm attitude. Take one of the symbol cards in your hand and gaze at it intently, until the mind is completely focused on the symbol and nothing else. If the symbol is Watery, feel the fluid around you. If it is Fiery, feel the heat against your skin. Quickly transfer your attention from the symbol to the white sheet of paper. An optical effect will produce an exact image of the symbol on the paper, but in the complementary or flashing color to the original. When this happens close your eyes and visualize the symbol as a large door. Mentally project yourself through this symbol-door with the Sign of the Enterer. (You may wish to rise and give the Sign physically as well, before sitting down to continue the vision.) Then visualize the door behind you. Maintaining your abstraction from your physical surroundings and, still concentrating on the symbol and its related ideas, seek out a perception of a scene or view on the Element's plane. There should be landscapes, objects, entities, and a strong sense of being within the Element. At this point, vibrate the highest divine names associated with the Ele- ment several times. The vision should become more dynamic and clear. Keep close to the doorway until an Elemental\" guide\" appears or is felt to be near. This being should be tested with every means at the aspirant's disposal to insure that it is indeed a true guide. Give the grade sign of the Element and see if the being can return it. You may trace the appropriate pentagram before the figure. Also ask the being clearly if it comes to act as your guide in the name of the appropri- ate divine name. If the guide is found to be true, you may let it lead you any- where through the vision and ask questions of it. For the Sub-Elements the same methods should be applied. After the pri- mary Elemental names, the divine names of the secondary Element should be vibrated and its grade sign given. You may find yourself being escorted from one guide to another. Always treat these beings with courtesy. Pay respect to the superior Orders, the Archangels, Angels and Rulers. To those of lower rank, bear yourself as an equal, and those lower still such as Elementals, should be treated politely but firmly. Always imagine yourself taller than the being confronting you. At the end of the vision, thank your guide and bid him/her farewell. Retrace your steps to the door and pass through it with the Sign of the Enterer. Return to your physical consciousness and stand up, firmly giving the Sign of Silence. It is wise not to practice this procedure too often. Once every few days is plenty. Also avoid skrying if you are tired or ill. If at any time during the visions you encounter something inappropriate or inconsistent with the vision, repeat the appropriate names, signs and symbols. Always strive to avoid deluding your- self-test everything in the vision and take nothing for granted. (For more information on skrying techniques, the advanced student may refer to manuscripts printed in Regardie's The Golden Dawn. These include:"},{"pageNumber":680,"pageContent":"The Portal Grade 655 \"Clairvoyance\" pg. 456-466, and \"Of Skrying and Traveling in the Spirit Vision\" pg.467-476.)(I Astrology From the Order Lectures, the student should be able to set up a true birth horoscope for any place and any time. The student should continue to draw up horoscopes for several people (both known and unknown to the initiate). Focus on the accurate interpretation of a horoscope is of utmost importance to this practice. Horary Astrology The Order requires only that the initiate be able to set up an accurate horoscope and know how to work out the aspects. Also required is the knowledge of how to make a simple assessment of the favorable and unfavorable factors in a horary figure. Whereas Natal Astrology focuses on the birth time of a person, Horary Astrology deals with the birth time oj a question. This dearly marks Horary Astrol- ogy (the Astrology of the Hours) as a form of divination. The methods of Horary Astrology are quite archaic, having been developed much earlier than Natal Astrology. Through the ages, this type of Astrology has cultivated a strict set of rules designed to aid in objective divination by providing an answer to a specific question. The Astrologer becomes the diviner and medium between a sharply focused question and the answer embodied in the Zodiacal chart that is drawn up at that moment of intense focus. Very briefly, the ancient rules of Horary Astrology can be summarized as follows: The birthtime of a particular question is essential to the reading. By this is meant the actual time when the question reaches the awareness of the Astrologer. This is when the focus of the question is brought by the Querent to the diviner for an answer. Communication must be personal and direct. Frivolous questions are not suitable for this type of Astrology, and the question must be specific. The ques- tion must also be presented in its own time. (If the Querent impulsively tele- phones the diviner with a focused inquiry, then the question will have been \"born\" naturally, not within the context of a predetermined appointment.) To reit- erate, the birthtime occurs when the diviner completely comprehends the question. Once the birth time of the question has been determined, several rules are traditionally applied to ascertain whether or not the chart is valid for further inter- pretation: 1. Void-oj-Course Moon. (A Planet is said to be void-of-course if it forms no complete aspect before leaving the Sign in which it is positioned at birth. Such a Planet is said to be without a purpose or objective.) Luna is very important in Horary Astrology. If Luna will not make an aspect with any other Planet in the horoscope before leaving its Sign, the horary chart is null and void. Such a chart would basically indicate that nothing good or bad will come of the matter. If the Void-of-Course Moon makes a favorable aspect to the Part of Fortune (a synthesis"},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":"656 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoWEN DAWN TRADmON of Sol, Luna and Ascendant positions} it would indicate success and benefit. If it forms an unfavorable aspect to the Part of Fortune it would indicate loss. 2. Position of the Ascendant. If the Ascendant lies between twenty-seven degrees of one Sign and three degrees of another, then the chart is invalid. In such cases, the question is considered either to close to the final outcome or premature. (Some Astrologers make an exception if the normally \"void\" Horary Ascendant forms an exact conjunction with a planet in the Natal chart.) 3. Via Combusta (the Fiery Way). Ancient Astrologers called the area between fifteen degrees Libra and fifteen degrees Scorpio \"the Fiery Way.\" If Luna lies within this section of the chart, the horoscope is invalidated.w' 4. Saturn in the Seventh House. In horary Astrology, the Ascendant represents the Querent, while the seventh house symbolizes the diviner. The placement of Sat- urn in the seventh house indicates that the diviner is: not objective, in error, has mis- understood the question, or is unable to come up with an answer. It sheds doubt on the validity or productivity of the Reading.w If none of the above rules apply, the analysis of the chart may continue. The house of the question must then be determined. (The meanings of the houses are basi- cally the same as in Natal Astrology, as are the Planets and Signs. Remember how- ever, that Horary Astrology is more specific-less generalized.) The ruler of the house in question is considered a vitally important part of the chart. The Horary answer is based upon the aspect relationships formed between that particular house ruler and the rest of the Planets. In addition to this, Luna and its aspects (until it leaves its Sign) portrays the development of the matter and its ultimate resolution. Another rule to keep in mind is that any Planet or angle degree which shares the same number of degrees as Luna's nodal axis (regardless of which Sign the Planet or nodal axis is in) will promote a \"fateful\" influence on the matter in question. Whether this influence is favorable or unfavorable depends upon the Planet in question. In any of the divinatory arts, the question of time is an important factor. In horary Astrology, the time of a recent pastevent is made by determining the num- ber of degrees between the Planet last passed (the Moon's last conjunction) and Luna's actual location (in degrees) in the chart. The number of degrees, not the Sign, is what is important here. The subtracted difference between these two degree numbers is relevant. Then using the placement of Luna in conjunction with the chart below, the diviner is able to ascertain the time frame involved: 148 We feel that this particular rule seems rather like the one in Geomancy where the Diviner is told to destroy the chart if Rubeus or Cauda Draconis show up in the First House. Apply it if you wish to be traditional. 149 In many cases the Querent and the Diviner may be one and the same. Follow the same advice as in the previous footnote."},{"pageNumber":682,"pageContent":"The Portal Grade 657 ANGULAR SUCCEDENT CADENT CARDINAL SIGN days weeks months KERUBIC SIGN months years many years or unknown MUTABLE SIGN weeks months years Example: If the difference between Luna and its most recent \"passed\" Planet is four degrees and Luna was positioned in a Kerubic Sign in an Angular house, the timing in question was four months earlier. The same table may be used to estimate the timing of future events. Exam- ple: Let's say that Luna is in eight degrees of Libra in the eleventh house. If another planet such as Jupiter is in fourteen degrees of Cancer, then we can see that a square aspect between Luna and Jupiter will occur six degrees \"into the future\" (14-8=6). Since Luna is in a Cardinal Sign and a Succedent house, this means that the square will occur in six weeks. Electional Astrology This type of Astrology concerns the planning of the \"birth time\" of a desired event before it occurs. It is a form of \"planning ahead\" which utilizes Astrological knowledge to determine beforehand the most favorable time to begin an idea or event, in order to obtain a desired outcome. This type of Astrology is very impor- tant to the ceremonial magician, who often uses it to plan the most favorable time to perform a specific ritual or magical working. In Electional Astrology, like Horary Astrology, the Moon is of crucial impor- tance. Its position must be strengthened in an Election chart for any pre-planned event. The void-of-eourse Moon should always be avoided in planning any event. Synastry (From the Greek \"syn\" meaning \"with, together, along with.\") This is the technique and practice of chart comparison in Astrology. Its focus is the relationship that exists between two natal charts when they are compared. It is used to evaluate the interac- tion between two people. Many kinds of human relationships can be explored through synastry, including marriages, business relationships and friendships. Imagine synastry as two natal charts placed one top of the other and held up to the light, so that both can be seen at the same time and compared. The Plan- ets of one chart will form aspects with the Planets of the other. The charts interact, create stresses and bring added comforts. Begin by comparing the positions of Sol and Luna in the two charts: trines created between the charts will indicate support, while squares and oppositions mean strained relations. Conjunctions will imply a unity of focus but perhaps not enough tension to allow for combined growth. However, even if there are numer- ous unfavorable aspects between two charts, a trine of the Suns will make com- patibility possible if not probable. The Sol/Luna combination of both horoscopes"},{"pageNumber":683,"pageContent":"658 SELF-INlTIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN 'fRAomoN must be examined together with emphasis placed upon the support or stress points formed by the cross-aspects between the charts. Synastry allows for wide orbs and places particular emphasis on Elemen- tal qualities. In addition, the closer the aspect, the more prominent will be the rela- tionship factors obtained by interpretation. If the Suns or Moons do not form aspects with each other, the Astrologer must tum his/her attention to the individual Sol/Luna blends and Elemental harmonies. Then examine the house positions of one individual's Sun and Moon in the other person's chart. Next, the positions of the remaining planets are com- pared by Sign, aspect and house. The relationship of the Mercuries will portray where the minds of the two individuals meet. The relationship of the Venuses points to emotional compatibility. The Mars' relationship will depict energy or sex. The [upiters will portray hopes and enthusiasm. The Satums will show align- ment of ambitions. The Uranus' factors will point to where one individual will cooperate in the other's self-concept and self-awareness. The Neptunes will por- tray fantasies and possible deceptions. The Plutos will indicate major points of blended perspective. (If a Planet of one horoscope falls on the South Node of the other, the first person will tend to dominate and exploit the latter.) The last step in synastry is to compare the aspects made between the Plan- ets from one chart to the other. These aspect relationships become active networks of one individual's needs and tensions interacting with those of the other person. In ideal relationships, tension must be present to sustain growth and attraction, while ease must exist to affirm comfort and fulfillment. Composite Two charts may also be compared by the construction of a composite chart. To make such a relationship horoscope, the Planetary positions, Midheaven and Ascen- dant points in both charts are converted to degree positions. Then the positions of each of the pairs (two Ascendants, two Midheavens, etc.) are added together and divided by two. The resulting composite points arrived at are the synthesis of the two charts. (The composite House alignment is determined by the composite Mid- heaven and the table of houses for the latitude marking the locale of the relation- ship.) In a composite chart, the Zodiacal Signs are not significant, whereas the aspects and house positions are of utmost importance. Astrology in all its forms is a complex and fascinating subject. The student is well advised to seek out a couple of good books on the subject to flesh out the \"bare bones\" of the system provided here. The various forms of Astrology pre- sented here should all be practiced at least once a week while in the Portal grade. I)"},{"pageNumber":684,"pageContent":"Divination The Portal Grade 659 The Portal initiate should strive as much as possible to develop the faculty of intuition through the use of Horary and Natal Astrology, Geomancy and Tarot. It is best to attempt only questions in which you are not emotionally involved, because methods of divination can be a fruitful source of self-deception to those who are psychic but not self-aware. It is only natural to advertise your successful intuitions and disregard your unsuccessful ones. If you are given to having intu- itions, you must learn to assess them honestly. Failure, too, is a part of the learning process. Have the courage to say, \"1 was right about this, but wrong about that.\"¢ Self-Exploration ~ The time spent in the Portal should be given to the study of the whole ~ makeup of the initiate. All of these methods are designed to assist the student in his/her progression along the road to self-knowledge. You are to realize the different layers of your being-some of which you have been symbolically led through in the Outer grades-\"Which in one sense quitteth not Malkuth\" -the Kingdom of yourself. This line of thought, coupled with the study of the rituals, may lead you to realize what it was you gathered together in the first point of the Portal Ritual, and what it is you are trying to perfect on the altar of the Spirit. The traditional period of time spent in the Portal grade is nine months, for this grade has a correspondence to the nine months of gestation before birth. As the unborn child, stage by stage, grows through the ancestral history of the race, so the initiate in the Portal, by a single circumambulation for each, recalls the past grades. And at the end of the first point of the ritual the initiate regards the Elemental grade symbols upon the altar as parts of the aspirant's body and mind, and contemplates them as coming together-the unity of his/her spiritual self. In the second point, the initiate sacrifices his/her name-the symbol of the old idea of \"self\"-in order that the idea of a new self and a new consciousness may be attained. This has a correspondence in the birth of a child. It emerges from the mem- branes and placenta which hitherto have been its body and source and finds itself not \"dead\" after the dread change, but translated to a larger consciousness. Thus the Portal foreshadows the kind of change and development necessary for understand- ing the higher teachings. The symbolism of birth gives us the courage to believe that even now, our personal growth is evolving to a stage where our physical bodies will share the same fate as the placenta, which \"dies\" at our spiritual birth. But tradition, as embodied in the Golden Dawn and shown somewhat less directly in the organized religions, teaches that this development can be assisted by conscious effort-in fact, there comes a time when this effort must be made through the present body and mind. And realizing that we are indeed in a path of Darkness groping for Light, we must feel our way to an understanding of the meaning of Life-and the reason for death."},{"pageNumber":685,"pageContent":"660 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoWEN DAWN TRADmON To those who feel the call to make this effort, comes the teachings of the Golden Dawn with a series of pictures, symbolic of the growth of the Soul to new life. The meditations given with each grade are designed to lead the mind towards ideas which will assist in self-knowledge-universal impersonal ideas which each must find in his/her own way-\"the secrets which cannot be told save to those who know them already.\" The aspirant is led to look backwards. First the initiate must acknowledge the debt to evolution through which has been perfected the instrument of the mind. Then, through meditation, the aspirant is led to see him/her self as not only self-conscious; as one who receives impressions-as one who criticizes and watches-t-one whose will is interfered with-e-one who is misunderstood-c-one to whom others are \"persons\" or masks (from the Latin persona, a mask)-but, stand- ing outside himself, the initiate now becomes one who endeavors to sense how his/her mask appears to others; as one who impresses, one who is criticized and watched, one who interferes with the will of others, one who misunderstands. The aspirant may recall earlier periods in life when his/her convictions were sure, judgments were harsh and unjust, and actions were shameful. The ini- tiate may view this past life in that picture as dispassionately as an entity operat- ing in the give and take of life-something growing out and as outside the cate- gory of blame as is the bitterness of unripe fruit. As the knowledge of the aspirant's place and relative importance in the Universe matures, s/he will attain strength to be self-honest-ashamed of nothing that is found within the mind-s-one watching the antics of the lower personality with tolerant amusement-yet always learning. The aspirant will reflect on words, and the power of words. The initiate will catch him/her self weaving them-twisting their meaning-deceiving self and others with them. S/he will at time come under obsession to them-s/he will see how they fix and make possible the recall of events and emotions, and with this knowledge s/he will become aware of how words affect other people. As the aspirant begins to realize the tremendous miracle of words, the magic, both good and evil, of human communication by words, s/he will begin to grasp why the Order reiterates the importance of silence. The true magician must understand all the tools of magic, and in periods of silence, s/he must contem- plate words as one of them. As the initiate thus traverses the long road to dispassionate self-knowl- edge, and no longer has to waste energy in doing battle for and indulging wounded feelings in defense of a totally false idea of self, s/he is led to meditate on the varied symbols of the cross, and from this to contemplate the Crucified One, known variously in the Western Esoteric Traditions as Osiris or Jesus Christ. The Life and sayings of Christ given in the Portal Meditation should be studied and pictured in the mind.

Sit in a comfortable position or lie down, eyes closed. Spend a few minutes inducing relaxation and rhythmic breathing. Visualize yourself within your present surroundings. As you continue the Fourfold breath, see yourself going backwards in time. As you inhale to the count of four, think of last spring. Hold the breath for four counts and think of last Winter. Exhale to the count of four and imagine last Fall. On the empty hold to the count of four, think of last summer. Continue the exercise in this fashion going backwards into time, from Spring to Winter, Fall and Summer. Ever backwards, keeping pace with the Fourfold breath. You may decide to go back in time in five year intervals: five years, ten years, fif- teen years, twenty years, etc. At anyone of these intervals, stop and visualize yourself at that particular point in time. Observe how you looked, how your sur- roundings looked, the people around you at that time, how you felt about yourself, your view of the world. Examine significant events that occurred which shaped your view of the world and of yourself. When ready to end the exercise, use the Fourfold breath to visualize time moving forward again. (Inhale-Spring, full hold-Summer, exhale-Fall, Empty hold- winter.) Move time forward again until you arrive at the present. End the exercise with the LBRP. Always record your observations. You should practice this exercise several times, deciding beforehand what time in the past you wish to examine further.

It is the Element of ultimate transcendence and divine essence. Spirit is androgynous and ever-present. The color given for Spirit is white. The \"direction\" assigned to Spirit is in the center (although it permeates through everything). Hebrew names especially connected with the Element of Spirit are Eth (essence), Yeheshuah (the Pentagramaton), Ruach (breath) and Eheieh (I am). Greek words for the Divine Soul is Nous, and Pneuma (Spirit). Godforms associated with the Element of Spirit include Inanna, Osiris, Dionysus, Mithras, Christ and all of the dying and resurrected gods and goddesses. Great Mother goddess such as Isis, who is the synthesis of all types of universal conciousness, can also be applied to the Element of Spirit. The Hebrew letter Shin in white is also attributed, as are the images of the sphinx, the circle, the cross and the Christian Holy Ghost. In the Enochian system the Tablet of Union is attributed to the Element of Spirit. This Tablet binds together the four other Elemental Tablets under the pres- idency of Spirit and the divine names Exarp (Air), Hcoma (Water), Nanta (Earth) and Bitom (Fire). NETER: The Egyptian word which means roughly \"God\" or \"Lord.\" The Hieroglyph for this word was an axe-head fastened to a long handle by thongs of leather or string. There is no exact translation of the word, although it was often used by the Egyptians to indicate something which is \"divine.\" The word Neter includes ideas of \"renewal\" and \"perpetual.\" It can be described as an active prin- ciple which creates things in regular recurrence, to renew its own perpetual self- existence, with the power to renew life indefinitely. OSIRIS: Originally an Egyptian vegetation god, the son of Geb and Nuet who died with the harvest only to be reborn in the Spring, Osiris later became the god of the Dead and of Resurrection. In early legend he was also a Water god who represented the fertility brought by the Nile. In certain texts he is simply referred to as \"God,\"something which was not done with other deities. And no other Egyptian god was equal to the exalted position of Osiris, or thought to possess his specific characteristics. Legend has it that Osiris instituted the cult of the gods, built the first towns and temples and laid down the law governing religious worship. He was given the title \"Onnophris\" or \"un-nefer\" (Greek and Egyptian respectively), which some claim means \"the good one.\" As the story goes, the evil brother of Osiris, Set, who represented everything which opposed Osiris, eventually plotted to kill him. Set entombed the body of Osiris within a chest and flung it into the waters. The chest later ended up on a shore where a tree trunk grew around it. The tree was later cut down and used as a column of a king's house. The chest containing the body of Osiris was eventually recovered by his wife, Isis, but Set found it and dis- membered the body into fourteen pieces, which he scattered. Isis patiently"},{"pageNumber":688,"pageContent":"The Portal Grade 663 searched for the remnants and reconstitued the body, accept for the phallus. Isis, aided by Thoth, Anubis and Horus, was able to restore the dead god to life. From early times Osiris represented to the Egyptians a being that was both a man and a god; someone who by virtue of his suffering and death, humans could identify with-more so than the other gods. But he also offered the hope of resurection after death-that humans, too, could triumph over death and attain everlasting life. Thus Osiris became the god of the Underworld, with the power to bestow eternal life upon the dead, who after passing the ordeal of the judgment (the Weighing of the Soul) were allowed to live in the Underworld. Osiris became known as Osiris Khenti Amenti or \"Lord of the Westerners,\" that is, the dead who dwell in the direction where sun sets. Eventually Osiris was thought to be even more powerful than Ra, the Sun god-taking on the powers of a cosmic Being and n the creator of all. He is represented standing or sitting on a throne, dressed in mummy wrappings. He wears the Ate! crown which is a high white miter or cone flanked by two ostrich feathers. His hands which are folded across his breast, hold the crook and scourge. Another symbol which is associated with Osiris is the Djed, which was said to symbolize the god's spinal column.e Djed SECTION 3: Wands, Lamens and Admission Badges The Wands The implements of the Hiereus and the Hegemon remain the same as they were in the Outer grades. The Third Adept's Wand: The blue salt-headed wand is the scepter of the Third Adept in the Portal Temple of the Order. The Third Adept in this particular ceremony always represents the feminine qualities of moisture and receptivity. (There is valid speculation within the Order as to the correctness of the symbolism concerning this particular wand-whether or not the symbol of mercury should actually replace the salt symbol as the wand-head. However we shall not enter into this discussion here. What we have provided is a description of the Third Adept's Wand as portrayed in the original Order documents.) Of these three Alchemic essentials, salt is the physical vehicle of manifes- tation for the other two. (The phrase \"salt of the Earth\" takes on new meaning in this regard.) Sulfur characterizes each thing in a particular way-mercury gives animation-but salt provides the matrix. Salt is the receptive Body-the material substance. Salt is in a continual state of evolution, taking on a new Body as the old Body is steadily cast away. This is a process of purification which arises out of sep- aration. To cleanse is purification, but the work of purification is more than a degree of cleansing. That which is pure is freed from that which is impure. The purification of the salt in its triune parts: the Body, Soul and Spirit, is an important step in the initiate's spiritual evolution. The Second Adept's Wand: The red sulfur-headed wand is the scepter of the Second Adept in the Portal Temple. The Second Adept in this ceremony represents"},{"pageNumber":689,"pageContent":"The Portal Wands The Third Adept's Lamen The Hiereus' Lamen The ChiefAdept's Lamen The Second Adept's Lamen The Hegemon's Lamen 664"},{"pageNumber":690,"pageContent":"The Portal Grade 665 the qualities of heat and the active male principle. That is why the most Fiery of the three Alchemic principles is attributed to this particular officer. Sulfur is that which gathers together and fashions all that is of the Earth. The nature of Sulfur is both tangible and intangible. Within its tangible aspect sul- fur is an oil which is to be found in all substances. Its intangible aspect is that of consciousness-to be found in all substances in varying degrees. Sulfur corre- sponds to the superconsciousness or the cosmic consciousness. It is the desire for positive action and vital heat. The ChiefAdept's Wand: The pentagram-headed wand is the scepter of the Chief Adept in the Portal Temple of the Order. The pentagram represents the four Elements of nature crowned by the fifth-Spirit. As far back as the days of the Egyptians, the five-pointed star has signified \"rising upward towards the point of origin.\" In the Portal ceremony it is wielded by the Chief Adept to instill these ideas deeply within the psyche of the candidate, who in this ritual symbolically receives the fifth and final Element. This wand also represents the Three Alchemic Principles combined. The shaft of the scepter is painted in the five Elemental colors of the pen- tagram: Spirit-white (the longest section on the wand), Fire-red, Air -yellow, Water-blue, and Earth-black. The Lamens The Second and Third Adepts wear lamens that symbolize their specific Elemen- tal affiliation. The Hiereus and the Hegemon wears lamens that are adorned with hexagrams-references to the Macrocosm and to the Perfected Human Being. The Hegemon's Lamen in the Portal Hall reveals her important duties as the keeper of the balance within the temple. The lamen depicts the opposing red and blue triangles of Fire and Water conjoined and in perfect equilibrium-the Macro- cosmic Hexagram. This lamen is not unlike a simplified Banner of the East (minus the crosses), showing the Hegemon's importance in bringing the candidate throughout all the grades to the Antechamber of the Light of L.~X. In the Portal Ritual, she is also the officer who performs all of the workings of Elemental Air. She therefore indicates that Air is the Reconciler between the Forces of Fire and Water, and that only through perfect balance of these two extremes is the Portal to the Light traversed. The Hiereus' Lamen in the Portal is identical to one of the diagrams shown in this grade: \"Below, is shown the Occult Symbol of Malkuth, the tenth Sephirah. It is in four parts, corresponding to the Maltese Cross. They are Fire of Earth, Water of Earth, Air of Earth, Earth of Earth, as indicated by the symbol. They correspond to the four grades of the First Order, which in one sense, quitteth not Malkuth, being the grades of the four lowest Sephiroth of Malkuth in Assiah. Upon them, is surcharged a white hexagram in a circle. The six and the four make ten, the num- ber of Malkuth on the Tree. The hexagram is also the Sign of the Macrocosm-of Tiphareth, and of the six upper Sephiroth, wherefore it is white-Spirit ruling over matter. Six is a perfect number, for its whole equals the sum of its parts ....Remem- ber that the whole number of Malkuth is 496-which again is a perfect number."},{"pageNumber":691,"pageContent":"666 SELF-INTI1ATIONINTO THE GoLDEN DAWN 'fRAomoN Malkuth must then be equated and perfected by the six ruling the four: and the link between six and four is the number of the pentagram.\" The Hiereus is the officer who sits in the lowest point of Malkuth in the Hall at the border of the Qlippotic Realm, enthroned upon matter and robed in Darkness. In the Portal, he is the Officer in charge of the workings of Elemental Earth. His lamen in this grade primarily shows that Spirit must always govern matter (represented by the four Sub-Elemental colors of Malkuth). If Spirit does not crown matter, the result is chaos and evil, symbolized by the Qlippoth. The Third Adept's Lamen portrays the forces of Water, and she thus oversees all the workings of Water in the Portal grade. Her lamen is painted in the flashing colors of Elemental Water, blue and orange. She represents the powers of the black (feminine) pillar in this grade. The lamen shows a octagram in the center of which is a Water cup drawn in the style of the Stolistes Badge. The octagram is formed from two squares superimposed one over the other at an angle. It thus refers not only to the sphere of Hod, but also to that of Chesed (i.e.,the two watery Sephiroth). The Second Adept's Lamen depicts the Powers of Fire, and he is in charge therefore of all the workings of Fire in the Portal grade. He represents the powers of the white (masculine) pillar in the Portal Ceremony. His lamen is painted in the flashing colors of Elemental Fire, red and green. Upon it are shown an upright Fire triangle within a pentagram. The pentagram refers to the sphere of Geburah, the fiery Sephirah. The ChiefAdept's Lamen differs from the others in that it is in the shape of a Rose Cross, which more properly belongs to, and foreshadows the Rosicrucian symbolism of the Second Order. This outer form of the Rose Cross Lamen is a symbol which unites the numbers four, five, and six. (The four arms of the cross, the number of Tiphareth (six), to which the Rose Cross is attributed, and the five Elements represented by the four arms of the cross plus the circle of Spirit.) The cross is a complex symbol whose main meanings include that of \"con- junction\" of opposing forces. The cross represents the mystic center of the cos- mos-the place of junction for the forces of the universe. Consequently, the cross affirms the primary relationship between the two worlds of the celestial and the Earth-bound (Spirit and Matter). It represents the Spirit or Divine Light, brought into the physical world of manifestation-Life (the human body) symbolized by the four Elements which are the components of Life. The rose is primarily a symbol of completion, total achievement and perfec- tion. It also alludes to the mystic center, and the heart. The rose is a yonic symbol associated with regeneration, productivity and purity. Because the flower unfolds when it blossoms, it is a worthy symbol of spiritual growth. To the Greeks it was a symbol of sunrise. The rose is the sacred flower of Venus, goddess of love, attributed to the seventh Sephirah. (Seven is described as the most blessed of all the numbers, and it is also the number assigned to the act of initiation into the mysteries.) The golden cross and red rose together refer to the synthesis of all these ideas. The red rose also alludes to the compassion and sacrifice of the Slain and"},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"The Portal Grade 667 Resurrected One. The golden cross alludes to the spiritual gold concealed within human nature.e The Admission Badges The Greek Cross of Five Squares is the Admission Badge to the Ritual of the Cross and the four Elements in the Portal grade. It symbolizes the equated forces of the four Elements ruled by the fifth Element of ETH or Spirit. In addition, the number five alludes to the powers of the pentagram-this cross could well be described as a pentagram in the shape of a cross. It is also described in the Portal Ceremony as: \"a cross of corrosion, cor- ruption, disintegration and death. Therefore doth it fall in the paths of Death and the Devil, unless in Hod, the Glory triumpheth over matter and the Corruptible putteth on Incorruption, thus attaining unto the beauty of Tiphareth; unless in Netzach, Death is swallowed up in Victory and the Transformer becometh the Transmuter into Pure Alchemic Gold. 'Except ye be born of Water and the Spirit, ye cannot enter the Kingdom of God.'\" This refers to some very basic Alchemic principles. In the science of Alchemy, purification arises out of separation, out of the various processes that transpire during the work with separation. Dissolution, also known as separation, is a form of decomposition-a breaking up. This is a crucial part of Alchemic purification. That which is not essential is separated from that which is. That which is pure is freed from the impure. There is a natural and hidden Fire within humanity that brings forth a cleansing process through heat, putrefaction and dis- tillation-until the Pure Essence is revealed. Only that which has endured the Trial by Fire has been purified. Only that which complies with the Trial of devo- tion and love, is pure. This cross is given to the candidate as a symbol of his/her various compo- nent \"parts.\" The candidate symbolically examines and scrutinizes these separate parts, an act which represents the process of decomposition. The different Ele- ments must be carefully equilibrated-any imbalance must be sacrificed. (Although we are discussing symbolic ritual acts, these processes must also occur in the psyche of the individual.) Until the initiate has prepared the psyche through separation and purification, he/ she cannot receive the Eth, the philosophical Mer- cury, (Spirit) whereby through knowledge and understanding the lesser is trans- muted into the greater. Only then can the true and indissolvable Stone of the Wise, be found within as a source of strength and inspiration. The Badge of the Hiereus' Lamen: This Badge is described earlier in this chap- ter thus: \"The triangle in the circle is the high symbol of the Holy Trinity, and the first three Sephiroth, and of Binah wherein is the sphere of Saturn, Ruler of the Path Tau. Therefore it is worn by the Hiereus, and when I entered the Hall of the Neo- phytes in the 0 = 0 grade, I beheld the sword that barred and the symbol which overcometh the barrier. The lamen in its more special attribution to the Hiereus, has the following meanings. In the circleare the four Sephiroth of Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod and Yesod..

Some of these are described quite adequately within the text of the ritual itself (including: the Cross of Four Triangles, the Circle and Point, the Occult symbol of Malkuth, the Diagram of V.I.T.R.I.O.L. and the Tablet of Uniont'\"), The other diagrams require a bit more explanation. The Great Hermetic Arcanum: This diagram is from the Musaeum Hermeticum, a 17th century alchemical book. Briefly described in the Portal ceremony, this dia- gram not only contains symbolism of the three alchemical principles, but also the seven mystical numbers as well. The central point (the face) in the diagram refers to the synthesis of the whole inherent within the monad. The duad is symbolized by the Queen of Luna and the King of Sol (the two gender archetypes as well as the two great contending forces of the Universe.) The triad is portrayed in the triangle of Spiritus, Anima and Corpus (Spirit, Soul and Body) as well as in the smaller triad of the Three Alchemical Principles. The number four is depicted by the four Elements (two of which are shown by their Kerubic animals) in the comers of the drawing. The number five is represented by the five parts of the initiate (hands, feet and head) which are each associated with one of the five Elements in the diagram. The number six is symbolized by the two triangles in the drawing. The heptad is shown by the heptagram of the Planets. 151 . The face of the figure is contained with a triangle formed from sulfur, mer- cury and salt. At the base is salt, which is identified with the planet Saturn of the heptagram, pointing downward at a cube, the emblem of the body (corpus). Sul- fur is placed on the Mars angle, pointing toward a torch-bearing hand on the side of the Soul (anima). Alchemical Mercury is located on the angle of the Planet Mer- cury, which points to a hand holding a sack or matrix on the side of Spirit (spiri- tus). The greater triangle of Body, Soul and Spirit, represent the Macrocosm, whereas the lesser triangle containing the face is the Microcosm. The image of the sun is situated on the side of anima-Soul, because it is sometimes considered as male, active and fiery. The salamander above affirms this. The female principle, Spirit, is shown alongside the image of Luna, above which is the eagle of Scorpio (the Water Element). On the side of Sol and Jupiter is a King. On the side of Luna and Venus is a goddess riding a dolphin. Sol and Luna (or Anima and Spiritus) are the male and female principles, which are separated in nature. Through the Spagyric Art the two are united and the resulting offspring is the Philosopher's Stone-the hermaphrodite-male and 150 For more information about all the Enochian Tablets, refer to our book, Secrets of a Golden Dawn Temple. . 151 Refer to Adam McLean's book, The Alchemical Mandala."},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"The Great Hermetic Arcanum (from the Musaeum Hermeticum) 670"},{"pageNumber":696,"pageContent":":s~s@:~ : =---------- The Vision of Neb had uc nezzar 671"},{"pageNumber":697,"pageContent":"The Seraphim of Isaiah The Kerubim and Wheels of Ezekiel The Kerubim of the Apocalypse The Seraphim and the Kerubim 672"},{"pageNumber":698,"pageContent":"louis flue Panos Hicrogly .. phica reprefenratic . fi;\"'llll__ k~lr ~l-.t~(JjllAA Factc, rubicilada. calona YU in Moodo. 6 R~diorum c«lcilium ie fubJunari.1 vir- C Elemenra m3fculiN.

This is indicated by the feet of the figure, one in the Water and one on dry land. In the circle which surrounds the figure, a Latin sentence of seven words is shown: Visita Interiora Terrae Rectifando Invenies Occultum Lapidem, \"visit the inte- rior of the Earth, in rectifying you will discover the hidden stone.\" Each word of the sentence relates to an Alchemical process. The first letters of all of these words form the word Vitriol. Within seven smaller circles are depicted various allegorical scenes of the Alchemical process from putrefaction to resurrection. To obtain this type of perfection, the Alchemist attempts to \"fix that which is volatile.\" (The fixed volatile is represented at the top of the diagram by the two wings tied together.) In practical Alchemy, the \"volatile\" is the evaporating Mer- cury, while the \"fixed\" is the Mercury remaining at the bottom of the container. During condensation, the volatile will drip from the top of the vessel to the bot- tom. The goal of this process of sublimation is to separate the (fixed) male and the (volatile) female portions of the Mercury. Then the two portions are each purified before they are joined in ultimate union. The Vision of Nebuchadnezzar: In the early days of the Order a variation of this diagram was briefly described in the Philosophus grade. The Portal diagram is based upon a description given in the Book of Daniel (2:31-38). Nebuchadnez- zar was a king of Babylon whose name meant \"Nebo chief protector.\" Nebo was the Babylonian king of Wisdom (the Lord of Brightness). As a king, Nebuchad- nezzar symbolizes the human will backed up by intellect, which brings about human judgment. The human will supported by intellect is very powerful up to a point (the metal body), until it realizes it's own weaknesses and limitations (the feet, part of iron and part of clay). These represent the limitations of the unpurified base material before the alchemical process is begun. The kings' vision portrays a great figure composed of different substances which are the planetary metals used in Alchemy. These metals describe the differ- ent psychic aspects of the initiate. These are the base materials that the aspirant must analyze, separate and sublimate (solve et coagula) unto the highest state of purity. The Stone cut without hands is the goal of the process-Philosophers Stone-unto which all else is like the chaff of grain blown by the wind. The Seraphim and Kerubim: This diagram portrays various descriptions of Angelic beings from three different Biblical passages. The first passage is from Isa- iah Chapter 6:1-3 where the prophet describes a vision: In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, highand lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Aboveit stood the Seraphim: each one had six wings; with twainhe covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain did hefly. And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole Earth isfull of his glory."},{"pageNumber":703,"pageContent":"678 SELF-INfTIATION INTO lHE GoLDEN DAWN TRAOmON The six wings refer to the hexagram and the idea of the number seven (the synthesis of the six ancient Planets plus the luminary of the Sun) which dominates the heavens. The next passage concerns the Kerubim in the vision of the Prophet Ezekiel (Ezekiel, Chapter 1). Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness ofa man. And every one had four faces and every one had four wings.... Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went, they went every one straight forward. As for the likeness of their faces, theyfour had the face ofa man,and the face ofa lion, on theright side; and theyfour had the face of an ox on the right side; theyfour also had the face ofan eagle. Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of everyone were joined to another, and two covered their bodies ... .Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the Earth by the living creatures ....And when the living creatures went, the wheel went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the Earth, the wheels were lifted up. Whithersoever the Spiritwas to go, they went, thither was their Spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the Spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels ....And under thefirma- ment were theirwings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and two which covered that sideon their bodies.\" Here the Kerubim are seen to be the powers of the four Elements under the name Tetragrammaton and the form of the cross (joined one to another) The wheel of the Spirit adds the fifth and final Element (ETH) which is the guiding principle of the whole, thus completing the pentagram. The final description of the Kerubim is from John's vision (Revelations 4:7-8). And thefirst beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle. And thefour beasts had each of themsix wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, is, and is to come. Here the Kerubim are seen as single-headed, but having six wings. They thus unite the powers of the number seven (the planets) with the number four (the Elements). Typhon: The diagram is taken from Athanasius Kircher's CEdipus l£gyptia- cus. Typhon is also called Set. He is the Evil One, the unclean one, the enemy and murderer of Osiris. Typhon later became known as the dragon of ignorance, destruction and perversion."},{"pageNumber":704,"pageContent":"The Portal Grade 679 The harsh sand storms and dry desert winds of Egypt were said to have been created by Apophis- Typhon, the maker of the blistering heat, drought and the sting of the scorpion. Typhon was reputed to rule when the Sun entered the Sign of Scorpio. Typhon was also believed to cause blindness by means of the wind-swept dessert sands. To initiates, Typhon represents the devourer of Souls and the lower world which \"swallows\" the spiritual side of the individual, whose essence is divine, but must be born (reborn) into the manifest Universe (a descent into a lower imperfect world). Defeating Typhon means freedom from the cycle of rebirth into the physical world (continuous devouring by Typhon) and ultimate union with the godhead. Pan: The drawing of Pan employed in this grade is from a diagram called \"The Hieroglyphical Representation of Jupiter or Pan\" from Athanasius Kircher's CEdipus lEgyptiacus. The Greek god of nature was considered the leader of the sacred dances which he was said to have created to represent the circular orbits of the Plan- ets. The god Pan is a composite of man and goat, an archetype of natural energy. He is also associated with the Planet Saturn (ruler of Capricorn) and his pipes represent the harmony of the Planetary bodies. Later, the Graeco-Egyptians considered Pan a form of Jupiter. The god was also regarded as the power of the Sun and the ruler of the lower worlds.

It is a principal factor in the attainment of spiritual progress. A practical and most effective method for training the Will is to con- sciously set up specific goals for a predetermined period of time, and if diverted from keeping these goals, to withhold something that gives enjoyment. This method is based on a type of behavior modification therapy. Keep in mind that there is nothing moralistic in this procedure. The student who undertakes this practice is not \"avoiding (bad) vices in favor of (good) virtues.\" The point is to strengthen the Will, which in and of itself is neither good nor bad. This exercise is a disciplinary vow that a certain habitual action will be denied by the aspirant. In order to perform this technique properly, the student should deliberately set a goal which is not in any way connected with a \"bad\" habit, such as smoking, swearing or drinking. An impersonal and guilt-free atti- tude of detachment should be maintained. The aspirant should select a personal idiosyncrasy such as tapping the foot to music, saying a certain word, or crossing the legs when sitting. This will help insure that the student does not make a sense- less virtue out of the discipline exercise. One of the most effective ways to reinforce the Will is to dispense a mild electric shock. (One can usually find a small device which will deliver a slight shock in any store that sells supplies for stage magic.) The shock is very light, but can be quite surprising. If this device is employed immediately following the bro- ken vow, a mental connection is made which will become a fixed and potent reminder which sets up a continual alertness on the part of the Will. It is important to carry the device with you at all times so that the disciplinary action can be delivered immediately after the transgression. By doing this the student will rein- force the connection between the unwanted action and the electric shock. It is through this discipline that the Will obtains its training and effectiveness. All vio- lations of the oath should be rapidly \"punished\" in order to make an enduring impression on the student's mind. This can be done either by administering a light shock as described above, or by denying oneself something that is pleasurable. This technique accomplishes two things. Firstly, a constant vigilance is established which generates a potent Will-power. Second, the mind itself is placed gradually under the control of the aspirant's Will. This in tum helps the student's faculty of concentration immensely.c THE PRACTICE OF THE DIVINE ESSENCE For this exercise the student should review and practice all of the relaxation and body-awareness exercises prescribed earlier."},{"pageNumber":707,"pageContent":"682 SELF-INmATION IN10 THE GoWEN DAWN 'TRAomON To perform this exercise, lie down in a comfortable position. Once relaxed, reflect on the fact that the entire surface of your body is covered by millions of tiny pores. In truth, every muscle and organ in the body is composed of cells which have minute areas of space between them. Imagine the pores on the skin of your face (nose, cheeks and brow) are stretched wide open. (This should only take a matter of seconds if you have performed the previous exercises regularly.) Then proceed to visualize the skin on the scalp and back of the head in the same fashion. Continue on to the skin of the neck, shoul- ders, arms, chest, abdomen, hips, thighs, legs and feet. Imagine the surrounding membrane of every part of the body, including the internal organs permeated by a series of pores loosely weaved together by a net-like substance. Once you have obtained a feeling of the opening of all the pores in your body, return to reflect upon your head. Imagine the brain, also has become full of open pores-somewhat sponge-like. Apply this visualization to every part in the body-the bones, muscles and soft organs-all becoming like sponges. When this visualization is complete, imagine that the surrounding atmosphere is able to easily penetrate through your body, as if the air itself flowed right through the pores and holes of your body. The air saturates you, entering into every pore. Imagine that when you inhale, the air enters your body through the bottom of your feet; when you exhale, the air leaves your porous body from the top of your head. Experiment with similar visualizations, pushing the inhalations and exhala- tions of air through your body in various directions. A relationship exists between the Elements of Air and Spirit. Therefore imagine that the air cascading through your body is the air of the Divine Spirit-the Ruach Elohim. It is the Divine which exists everywhere, surrounding you on all sides- omnipotent and infinite. This Spirit is without limitation or opposition. It is eter- nal Truth, Wisdom and Love. It is Light and Life. This is what you should imagine flowing freely through every pore of your body and mind. This exercise is designed to bring the student to a high level of divine-con- sciousness. Every aspect of mystical experience and knowledge may be brought fully into play during this meditation. Although it is an extension of the aspi- rant's earlier work, this meditation is designed to bring about a true realization concerning the infinity of the eternal Spirit and the complete fulfillment of the Divine within.e"},{"pageNumber":708,"pageContent":"The Portal Grade 683 A GUIDED VISUALIZATION FOR THE PORTALl53 After taking a ritual bath and performing a rite of relaxation, put on the regalia of the First Order and the crossed black and white sashes. Two candles, one black and the other white should be placed upon the altar, North and South respectively. Close your eyes and continue breathing in the exercise of the Fourfold Breath. See yourself leaving your personal temple behind. The room slowly fades from your view. Imagine yourself standing in a great arched stone doorway. Before you is a magnificent temple with marble pillars, an immense stone altar, black-and-white tiled floor, an assembly of Egyptian gods and goddesses and Kerubic guardians. Anubis. Horus. Thme. Osiris. This is a place you are very familiar and comfortable with. It is the Hall of the goddess, Thme, the Hall of Two Truths. This is where your admission into the mysteries first took place, and your journey on the path of initiation began. For many months you have worked in this temple, learning its secrets and studying its foundation. Now it is time to journey beyond the confines of this temple and explore what lies ahead. Near the doorway in which you are standing there is one enormous black pillar. Figures and hieroglyphs are carved into its smooth obsidian surface. A red stained glass pyramid burns brightly upon its summit. You reach out your hand to touch this pillar, the symbol of the temple you are leaving behind. You know that once you leave this temple, the touch of the black pillar will never feel the same as it does now. The assembly of gods seem curiously elated at your parting, as if they understand more about your impend- ing journey than you do. Saluting them with the Signs of a Neophyte, you tum and step out of the archway into a mist-covered landscape. This is the strangest terrain you have ever encountered. It is neither day nor night. There are no trees nor plants of any kind. No rocks or hills. There is lit- tle of anything except a gray haze and fog-enshrouded ground. This is a complete detachment from anything you have yet experienced. You look around for a guide, for caution tells you not to proceed until one appears. You withdraw for a while into a quiet meditation, imagining yourself as the child-god, Harpocrates, seated upon a Lotus flower. At length you are aroused from this meditation by an unimpressive figure in a simple brown robe. You test the authenticity of the guide by vibrating the divine name of Eheieh. You then exchange the Neophyte Signs. Your guide then leads you into the mist. You continue walking for some time, uncertain of your direction, or if a path even exists under your feet. If only there were something, some marker or symbol to give you a clue as to where you are going. But again there is nothing. You might be walking in a circle for all you know. It is as though you and your guide exist in a state of limbo. You ask the guide where you are going. He indicates that at this point in your spiritual development, it is up to you to decide where your path truly lies. 153 From our book Secrets of a Golden Dawn Temple."},{"pageNumber":709,"pageContent":"684 SELF-INITIATION INTO THE GoLDEN DAWN TRAomON You must find a way out of the fog. Taking the advice of your guide, you reach into yourself to find the knowledge you accumulated as an initiate. This knowledge will aid you now. But knowledge is not enough, you must begin to put that knowl- edge to wise and practical use. You are not even certain of the direction you are fac- ing, therefore you close your eyes and ask for the guidance of the Divine Light. Behind the darkness of your closed eyelids, you see an Angelic hand appear, a flaming Yod held in its palm. Turning your body until the hand is directly in front of you, then you open your eyes. You now know what direction is East. You invoke the four Elements, saying the proper words and saluting each quarter with the Sign of the Rending of the Veil. As you salute the North, moun- tains, hills and lush forests appear around you. As you salute the East, a cool gust of wind rushes over you and clouds begin to form. As you open the Veil toward the West, vast oceans and pristine rivers are created. As you make the Sign toward the South, a bolt of lightning strikes a tree starting a small brush Fire that clears away dead vegetation. Arich landscape has been formed around you where once there was noth- ing. You pause a moment to perform the Qabalistic Cross. Your guide gives a nod of approval. The two of you continue on in the direction of the Eastern wind. A wheel appears off in the sky ahead, but you are too far away to see it clearly. It is not long before a dreadful sight appears on the right-hand side of the path you are traveling. In a field is a skeleton swinging a scythe back and forth, cut- ting the long stems of wild grass. Beneath its bony feet are human body parts pro- truding from the Earth, which are nourishing the fresh vegetation. The skeleton stops swinging his implement and gives you a long eyeless stare. A deadly scor- pion picks over the bones for food, and a poisonous serpent curls around the scrawny legs of the reaper. Off in the distance beyond the figure is the colossal form of Typhon, spewing smoke and ash from his mouth like some infernal volcano. This is the image of transformation, which most people fear intensely. It is a frightening image because many individuals fear change of any kind. Change is however, a natural occurrence in the cycle of the universe. Change of con- sciousness is necessary for spiritual evolution. You notice a white eagle soaring above the head of the skeleton, a symbol of purity and transmutation. You give the Sign of the Enterer at the figure. It answers with the Sign of Silence. You and your guide proceed on the Eastern path. The landscape continues as before, unchanged in its richness. Far ahead of you, there appears to be a large tree in the shape of the letter Tau. A figure is hang- ing from it, but you are too far away to see any details. To the left of the path another strange sight is evident. A hairy creature with a goat's head, huge bat-like wings and clawed feet stands on top of a cubical black stone. To the rock are chained two smaller horned creatures who dance and mimic the larger being. The great demon spits and laughs at you as it flaps its leathery wings and rocks back and forth upon the altar, trampling protective pen- tagrams underfoot. The figure hurdles a stream of obscenities at you and tells you to return from whence you came."},{"pageNumber":710,"pageContent":"The Portal Grade 685 However you are aware of the humor of this situation. The figure of the devil is truly a comedy of errors, a conglomerate of various animal parts put together as an illusion to mislead you. The Devil is a boogieman, a creation built up from humanity's own fears and corruption and projected outwards into the form of a demon-a scapegoat for all evil acts committed by human beings. This illusion, like all illusions placed as obstacles to your spiritual growth, must be dealt with, exposed, and seen for what it truly is, or else you will remain like the two smaller creatures, held in bondage by their own misconceptions. You must see beyond the limited vision of your two physical eyes. The greater sight of the inner vision is called for. The figure of the devil does not alarm you, in fact it pro- vokes you into laughter. The apparition of the Devil vanishes without a trace. Off in the forest beyond, you see the figure of gentle Pan, Greek god of nature, much maligned by Christian- ity, which turned the peace-loving god into a monster. Pan is grateful that you have shattered the false illusionary form of the devil. With a flick of his goat's tail, he smiles and slips quietly into the woods. Soon after, you hear the sweet sound of music from his hollow-reed pipes. Continuing on in the direction of the East, you and your guide eventually find yourselves in the middle of a great valley where a clear river divides the land. A mighty volcano spews ash into the distant sky, but even that impressive sight cannot draw your eyes away from the gigantic form of an Angel who straddles the river, one foot resting on dry land, and the other foot in the Water. The eyes of the Angel are closed, and you get the impression that she does not need eyes to see you with. Soft reddish hair frames her face and falls in long locks against her blue robe. Her wings are like two prismatic crescents which rise vapor-like into the air beyond. Asingle golden square adorns her azure garment, and the brilliant orb of the sun graces her brow. In her slender hands she holds two vases, one containing Water, and the other containing Fire. She mixes the two primal Elements together, creating steam and liquid gold. The Angel then releases the two vases which remain floating in the air, com- pletely unsupported. The mixing of the Elements continues as before, the Fire and Water now form an infinity sign as they flow from one vessel into the other. Her hands free, the Angel makes the Sign of the Philosophus. Without warning, a fierce lion appears from behind a bush, ready to spring at you. Somehow you realize that what is about to occur is necessary, and you resist the urge to banish. The great cat lunges at you and knocks you off your feet. The beast delivers a painful bite to your left hip then simply walks away and begins licking its paw. The sting of the wound is intense. The sight of blood on your hand causes you to enter a trance-like state: Flames are all around you, engulfing your entire body. The pain of the wound increases as you feel the purging Fire burning away the impurities of your personality-all the untruths, jealousies, cruelties and injustices you have ever committed against others and against your own Higher Self. All these evils are brought to the surface like a boil. They arise out of your skin to surround your body like the foul smoke of a rubbish-fire. The stench of your own naked evils is enough to gag you, and you suddenly feel exposed and ashamed."},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"686 SELF-INITIATION INlO 1HE GoLDEN DAWN 'TRAomoN The Angel then makes the Sign of the Practicus, forming a cup over her heart with her hands. As she does so, you become aware of a pure white eagle fly- ing low, skimming across the surface of the river. As you lay exhausted on the ground, the great bird circles above you and finally lands, sinking its sharp talons into your right hip. The pain is almost a relief. A sudden rainstorm appears. Heavy drops of Water wash over your face and into your mouth. The foul black cloud is washed away without a trace by the redeeming rain. The bird of prey is not at all bothered by the downpour. It regards you with stem eyes, but it seems to be saying, \"mercy, forgiveness, peace.\" The rain stops as suddenly as it began and the bird takes to flight. The sun appears from behind a cloud and its rays form the most perfect rainbow you have ever seen in the East. A wondrous feeling of freedom overtakes you. You feel healed and rejuvenated. Standing up to face the Angel, you reach down to touch with both hands, the wounds left by the kerubic creatures. Holding out your hands toward the Angel, you notice that your hands are not bloodied. In the palm of one hand is a small tongue of flame and in the other is a handful of Water. The Angel makes the sign of the equated cross over you. Bringing both hands together over your heart, you absorb the equilibrated Elements into your Tiphareth center, and a rush of white brilliance reverberates throughout all the spheres and paths of your inner Middle Pillar. The Angel begins to fade from view, transforming into glistening drops of mist which hang in the air and catch the suns rays to form flowing prismatic shapes. The shimmering forms gather together into a thin wisp of a veil which extends before you in the East. Your guide, whom you had all but forgotten, takes you by the arm and places you in front of this etheric curtain. Giving the Sign of the Rending of the Veil, you part the curtain. An immense white pillar, counterpart to the black pillar that you saw earlier looms before you, stretching very nearly to the sky. Its white marble surface is fully etched with sacred scenes and symbols. Its red pyramid capital is almost lost to view in the clouds. You touch this pillar just as you embraced its black twin. An inner part of you rejoices at this union. For a long time you remain in communion with the energies of the pillar of light. At length it is time to end this journey. Your guide takes you back along the path, past Pan's forest and the figure of Death swinging his scythe. Finally, you come to the door of the familiar temple in the West. You exchange the Signs of the Opening and the Closing of the Veil with your companion and bid him farewell. Then, giving the Neophyte Signs, you enter the Hall of Dual Manifestation. The assembly of gods and goddesses seems elated to see you. The temple is the same, but you feel different-ehanged somehow. It is as though you have reached a different level or plateau in your spiritual development, and your per- spective is no longer the same as it was. You spend a brief period of time at the altar flame before deciding to end the meditation."},{"pageNumber":712,"pageContent":"The Portal Grade 687 Finally, you see your own physical temple room and see yourself seated within it. Bring your consciousness slowly back into your physical body, sensing the room around you. After adjusting yourself to your surroundings, you may bring the visualization to its completion. At the end of the meditation, you may write down any impressions or experiences in a magical diary before closing with the LBRP.¢ Additional Work for the Portal Grade In our book Secrets of a Golden Dawn Temple, Volume Two, there are several rituals written specifically for the Portal grade. They include: the Rite of Self-Purifica- tion, the Rite of Self-Consecration, the Rite of Self-Consecration through Sulfur, the Rite of Self-Purification through Salt, a Simple Meditation on the Portal Lamens, and the Purifications of the Elements Within. The student may also begin regular performance of the Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram (SIRP) and the Supreme Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (SBRP). Although these last two rituals are traditionally Adept-level, we believe that the Portal ini- tiate may begin to practice them by virtue of the fact that s/he has now been introduced to all five Elements. The LVX Signs vs. the Portal Signs. In some of the rituals suggested in this chapter, (the SIRP, the SBRP, the BRH, and Regardie's Opening by Watchtower) call for the initiate to give the LVX Signs after tracing the Spirit pentagrams. This is because traditionally, advanced rituals of this type were performed only by initiates in the grade of Adeptus Minor (or higher). The LVX Signs are the grade signs of an Adeptus Minor, not necessarily the grade sign of the Element of Spirit. The Fifth Element is conferred on an initiate in the Portal grade, and therefore the grade signs of Spirit are the Opening and Clos- ing of the Veil, just as the grade sign for Air is that of the Theoricus. It is therefore appropriate for the Portal initiate to freely substitute the Portal Signs for the LVX Signs. We realize, however, that many students have already been performing these rituals with the traditional LVX Signs, and may be reluctant to switch to the Portal Signs. Therefore we have presented the rituals in this course with the tradi- tional LVX Signs, and leave the option open for the individual to choose.e Suggested Reading The Art of True Healing by Israel Regardie (Deals with the aura and the Middle Pillar from a therapeutic view point.

The aspirant who has persevered through many months of studying these pages and the rituals described herein will have come to a realization that every aspect of the manifest universe is connected to and directed by the Divine. Every action, no matter how seemingly trivial is endowed by the Divine. Even the aspirant's own ego, which is a steady source of consternation throughout these studies, is determined by the Divine. No part of a divine universe is without meaning or importance. 158 These names would not be vibrated if the magician were to perform the ritual in the Vault of the Adepti."},{"pageNumber":724,"pageContent":"The Portal Grade 699 For all ceremonial workings, the magician must remember to always invoke the Highest first. It is equally important to invoke one's Higher Self or Holy Guardian Angel when performing the higher workings. This is because the magician's Angel is his/her own personal link with the universal Divine. A magi- cian who has not made an initial connecting link to the Angel will never be able to accomplish the complex rituals of high magic. For the purposes of this course, we have clothed the Higher Self in the garb of the goddess Thme. At this point, how- ever, the aspirant should make an attempt to connect with the Angel without such scripting-discovering the personal nuances of the Angel on one's own. Anyone who attempts such workings under the governance of the Lower personality rather than the Higher Self is almost certain to fail, if not corrupt the magic. Communication with one's Holy Guardian Angel is not to be found through good deeds or virtues, nor through one's beliefs in religious or occult dogma. No grade certificate or business card given by an occult organization can bestow it. It is only found through patience, perseverance, self-discipline and aspiration. The effort must be made and followed up with self-honesty and sincerity. But above all else invoke often and inflame thyselfwith prayer! There are many prayers and invocations that the magician can look to for inspiration, including the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the Greek Magical Papyri and certain Biblical writings such as the Psalms. Regular meditation-time spent alone in communion with the Godhead is a way to focus the divine presence within the Soul and the psyche. Daily discipline is required. The magician must also trust the Holy Guardian Angel for guidance in all areas of life, even the most seemingly mun- dane. Through aspiration, prayer and invocation, the magician will certainly come to an understanding of what it means to find the True Stone of the Wise and to rest \"underthe shadow of Thy wings, YHVH.\"*"},{"pageNumber":725,"pageContent":"Afterword by Mitch Henson n this New Age of neo-pagan revivalism the term \"initiation\" gets bandied about much too frequently. If one attends the numerous neo-pagan gatherings, one hears a great deal about initiation (hence questionable qualifications). Let us not kid ourselves. Initiation means beginning and perhaps, something more. This is no less true i21~\" within. the Golden Dawn, the O.T.O. or the three degree system of Wicca. A beginning qualifies no one-a beginning is where the work starts. Usu- ally an initiation is seen as a ceremony pulling in specific energies to introduce the candidate to the path he/she has chosen. Sometimes this is done in the form of a dedication, as in Wicca, or by the actual manipulation of the LVX in the Golden Dawn by the Hierophant (the chief initiating Officer). In Wicca the candidate pledges to dedicate him/herself to the Goddess and the God. This is usually followed by three primary degrees and a great deal of training. In the O.T.O. the candidate participates in a dramatic ritual designed to open the chakras. In the Golden Dawn the candidate is imbued with the divine energy needed to begin the Great Work. Realistically it makes no difference which path one follows. Each system has advantages and disadvantages. Israel Regardie wrote that by revising the Golden Dawn group initiation rituals for self-initiation, one could become initiated within the structure of the Golden Dawn. At least one disenfranchised member of the Golden Dawn did just that. When Aleister Crowley left the Order after the revolt of 1900,he formed his own Ordo A:. A: .. It was his opinion that the Golden Dawn failed to provide a struc- ture which took the all too fallible human ego into consideration. He felt that the interaction of personalities distracted the student from accomplishing the Great Work. He also recognized a need for a membership that could exist on a one on one exclusivity relationship between master and student. Since he conceived his Order to be an initiatory body, he rewrote the Golden Dawn Neophyte Ritual for self-initiation. The result was Liber Pyramidos. Unfortunately Pyramidos was writ- ten within the framework of Crowley's religion, Thelema, and is consistent with those who fully believe in the validity of the Aeon of Horus. For far too long the initiatory rituals of fraternal/magical organizations have been shrouded in a cloak of secrecy. Having been involved with, at least one such Order, I can attest that whether one is aware of the ritual prior to one's 701"},{"pageNumber":726,"pageContent":"702 SELF-INITIATION INTO 1HE GoLDEN DAWN TRAomON advancement or not, it simply makes not a shred of difference as to the validity of the initiatory process. I believe that Crowley even came to this conclusion, because with Liber Pyramidos he required the candidate to memorize the full text. This had to be done because it was, and is a ritual of self-initiation which the aspirant had to complete while hoodwinked. Having stepped up the ladder of O.T.O. degrees to the Fifth Degree, with each ritual more protected than the last, and having moved through the grade rit- uals of today's Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn without that dark cloak laying over the process, I , for one, would be willing to conclude that the Golden Dawn is far superior within their initiation process. Secrecy is not the motivating factor for advancement within the structure of any group. I'm sorry, but I believe that the road to self-illumination resides in the acquisition of knowledge. The only way one acquires that knowledge is to study the rituals of the organization that one affiliates oneself with. The Neophyte Ritual provides the entire body of magical teaching as adumbrated by the Order. Since it is the intent of the Golden Dawn to teach the processes of magic, it is absolutely necessary that the candidate have full access to the rituals through which he or she receives their initiation. The book you have just read is based on the original Neophyte and grade rituals of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. There is no underlaying cloud Under the Rose, ostensibly to protect the integrity of the Golden Dawn. The text of this book maintains the integrity of the original group rituals by not insisting on a specific creed, for it is the knowledge and practice of magic that the Golden Dawn disseminates. The reader will note that the knowledge lectures have been fully expanded, updated and organized so as to promote the best possible method one has at one's disposal for learning the material. At the end of each section are fully realized examinations which, if the student is honest with him or herself, will pre- pare one fully for Adepthood. Though one should never mistake the realization of Adepthood as one's principle goal. The goal is not to become an Adept, for that is just a single bridge that one will cross on the road to self-realization. With the advent of this volume there should be a great deal less confusion, on the part of the student, about what material is pertinent to the gradework. When Israel Regardie originally issued the Aries Press edition of his seminal work, his intent was to insure the availability of the Golden Dawn technique of initiation and the methods of ceremonial magic as taught by the Order. Organization of the material was not his intent-preservation was. Almost fifty years have elapsed and, to my knowledge, this material has been fully reorganized and expanded here for the first time. Though Chic and Tabatha Cicero have geared the text of this book as an instruction of self-initiation, it should become very apparent to the reader that this volume can be used with a clear intent to promote group work. It should also become apparent that any single individual or group of individuals have a clear choice in preparing the background for any path they wish to take inside or outside the Golden Dawn, based on the Western Tradition of ceremonial magic. Vntually the entire range of occult teaching available today has been influenced by the teach-"},{"pageNumber":727,"pageContent":"Afterword 703 ings of the Golden Dawn in one capacity or another since Regardie originally pub- lished this material. This will undoubtedly be truer with the book you are now hold- ing, which is seminal in its own right. It is certainly true that this book is one of the most complete and unique books on the initiation work of the Western Esoteric Tra- dition. Similar texts seem to be content with somewhat meaningless descriptions of an initiatory process. This one is unique in that it fully presents the work necessary to the student in a complete format within a single volume. It is unique in that Chic and Tabatha recognize the need for an initiator and provide a means for the aspirant to access the current that will be responsible for a valid initiation. For the first time the student has the means to fully initiate one- self into the 120 current of the Golden Dawn. It is unique in that it places the initiation rituals in a traditional format as initially conceived by Mathers, Westcott and Woodman, the founders of the origi- nal Order. You certainly will not find muddied embellishments and bovine scatol- ogy. Clear, concise and no nonsense. It is unique in that the text, rituals and knowledge lectures are consistent with Israel Regardie's The Golden Dawn, the cards produced by Chic and Sandra Tabatha Cicero, the New Golden Dawn Ritual Tarot book and Secrets of a Golden Dawn Temple. It is unique in that they make no pretentious claims regarding their range of experience, which is considerable, or nonsense about secret teachings that Israel Regardie was not aware of. The material they present is traditional though flexible. For the student who plans to continue the Great Work after the material in this volume has been assimilated, Israel Regardie's The Golden Dawn will provide the work of the Second Order. The present volume will provide the studies neces- sary to fully realize a competent level for the student to pursue the more advanced work of the R.R. et A.c. While utilizing the material in both this book and Regardie's, the reader will benefit greatly by supplementing these works with additional material provided in The Golden Dawn Journal, an ongoing series of vol- umes, edited by Chic and Sandra Tabatha Cicero, featuring multiple perspectives on the Golden Dawn by a variety of prominent occult writers. The book you hold in your hands is unique in that you will not find mate- rial rewritten, reevaluated and changed simply to satisfy the ego-oriented urge that seems to be so important to some occult-oriented writers these days.
