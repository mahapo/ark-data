THIRD REICH CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY ABBEY and STARR are sitting around a large oak conference table. The TALL BLOND is standing at the head of the table. TALL BLOND The reason you are still alive Professor STARR is that we want you to correct some flaws in your book. STARR What flaws are you talking about? TALL BLOND The first flaw is that you stated that there were no previous inhabitants in this place. STARR Do you mean to tell me that there were previous inhabitants in this place? TALL BLOND Yes, that is exactly what I am saying. When our original expedition arrived in 1942, they found a hidden city long abandoned. Yes, there was a lost city in the hollow earth as mentioned in legend. STARR What kind of hidden city? TALL BLOND A very old race that died out at the end of the Ice Age some ten or twelve thousand years ago. STARR And just how did you come to that conclusion? (CONTINUED)"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"29. TALL BLOND Our scientists were able to decipher their language so we have a written history of their race. They were very advanced, far superior to us today. They had flying discs and energy force fields. It took us fifty years to discover all of their secrets. STARR What do you mean flying discs? TALL BLOND I mean flying saucers. We began testing them back in 1947 and one failed and crashed at Roswell. In 1953, we fly over Washington, DC, and forced your government to acknowledge us or suffer the consequences. STARR Okay, if I buy that story, what about the Aztec crash of 1948, the Kingman crash of 1953 or the Phoenix Lights back in 1997? TALL BLOND Unfortunately, our flying discs crashed in Aztec after being shot down and in Kingman when it got too close to a nuclear test and the electromagnetic pulse disabled the craft. What you call the Phoenix Lights, well, we had to make another statement, it seems that your military were encroaching on the one hundred mile dead zone that surrounds our base. Our saucers were like a shot across the bow, a warning shot. ABBEY If our government knows about this base, why keep it secret? TALL BLOND For the same reason that Area 51 in Nevada and Pine Gap in Australia is not acknowledged as secret bases by your government.

TALL BLOND The second flaw that his secret base has the descendants of the original leaders of the Fuhrer. ABBEY Hell, the war ended over 60 years ago, your leaders must be in their 90s or older. TALL BLOND Actually, our Fuhrer has not aged much since that time. STARR And just who is your Hitler wannabe Fuhrer today? TALL BLOND Our Fuhrer is the same genius that led the Motherland back in the 40s, Adolf Hitler. ABBEY No way, Hitler committed suicide in his bunker at the close of the war to avoid being taken prisoner. TALL BLOND Yes, a man and woman committed suicide and were then consumed in fire, but the bodies were not those of Adolf Hitler nor his wife, Eva Braun. STARR Who were they? TALL BLOND Loyal followers of the Fuhrer who gladly gave their lives so the Fuhrer could escape to Germania. ABBEY But that would still make Hitler over 113 years old and that is not possible. TALL BLOND You are absolutely correct. STARR So if it is not possible, why do you say that your Fuhrer is Adolf Hitler? (CONTINUED)"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31.

ABBEY God, are you telling me that when you deactivate a clone, you kill it and a new clone Hitler is \"activated?\" TALL BLOND Yes, that is what I am telling you. STARR You're telling me that the same Hitler who masterminded the Third Reich in Germany is now in command of this base? TALL BLOND Yes, when we deactivate a clone, we simply terminate it. It has served its purpose. Each generation of clones retained the same memories of its previous generations. We will will always have our beloved leader to guide us. STARR Nazi atrocities still prevail in your new order. How can you murder a clone; he is still alive and human? TALL BLOND Enough of your American morality. We want you to document the rise of the Third Reich that will dominate the world for the next one thousand years fulfilling our Fuhrer's dream of the One Thousand Year Reign of the Third Reich.

Camera descends toward street level and below to underground highways filled with futuristic vehicles racing along above the ground. ABBEY This is unbelievable. STARR I would not have believed it if I had not seen it with my own eyes. TALL BLOND The hidden city is not visible from here. If you will follow me, I will give you a tour of that ancient city.

ABBEY What is that last flying disc, it is so much larger? TALL BLOND That is a transport ship, the smaller ones are two-man fighters. STARR This is truly unbelievable. This is proof that will rewrite history. TALL BLOND This is why we want you to update your last book, this times with proof and a record of our rise to power. ABBEY Ice Age flying saucers hidden in the center of the earth is something right out of a Jules Vern's novel. TALL BLOND The inhabitants of this city apparently came from the stars and colonized this planet just before the Ice Age. STARR What happened to them? TALL BLOND We do not know for sure. They originally settled on the surface of this planet, but when the pole shift occurred, they moved underground and build this complex. ABBEY How long did they dwell underground?

STARR Surely someone died of an accident, if not of old age. TALL BLOND Good question Professor STARR. Our scientists have been studying this civilization for almost seventy years and found no records of any deaths. ABBEY This just gets better and better, now we have aliens who are eternal. STARR So did the aliens just abandoned this place and fly off into space? TALL BLOND Yes, for some reason, the inhabitants had to abandoned this place in a hurry, leaving behind personal items and these flying disc. We believe that they had a mother ship in orbit and they escaped to it with ships that could leave our atmosphere. STARR Speaking of these flying discs, do they operate in outer space or just in the atmosphere? TALL BLOND They are simply atmospheric crafts.

STARR So much for this place not being wired for sound. (CONTINUED)"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"76. ABBEY Okay so I made a mistake, what are you going to do, fire me? CUT TO: INT. HAWTHORNE SECRET SUBMARINE BASE -- DAY The ADMIRAL is pacing in the room. The techs have the flying disc on their radar screen. Approaching the flying disc are six jet fighters. The ADMIRAL walks over to the RADIOMAN. ADMIRAL Give them the weapons free signal. RADIOMAN Roger, the signal has been sent. They are now weapons free. The ADMIRAL walks back to the radar scope and watches as the six jet fighters close in on the flying disc. CUT TO: INT. JET FIGHTER COCKPIT -- AFTERNOON The pilot radios his wing group that they are weapons free. JET FIGHTER 1 Okay boys, lets take this disc down. JET FIGHTER 2 Roger that. Let's burn his ass. Jet 1 releases his missiles that streak toward the disc. Jet 2 releases his missiles that streak toward the disc. Both sets of missiles explode harmlessly against the green flowing force field. CUT TO: INT. FLYING DISC COCKPIT-- CONTINUOUS HIMMLER is standing behind the pilot. HIMLER Don't worry, our force field will not allow any missiles to hit us. FLYING DISC PILOT Do you want me to blow them out of the sky? HIMLER No, let them have their fun. I want them to report back their failure. (MORE) (CONTINUED)"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"77. HIMLER (CONT'D) Fear of the unknown is a great tool in disabling our enemies. Let them worry about us. The two jets fly by the disc, but the disc does not return fire. CUT TO: INT. FLYING DISC -- CONTINUOUS STARR runs to the window and watches as missiles steak toward their disc. ABBEY joins him at the window. ABBEY My God, they are shooting missiles at us. STARR The force field will protect us. I wonder why HIMMLER is not ordering the pilot to return fire. He can destroy those jets just by snapping his fingers. CUT TO: INT. JET FIGHTER COCKPIT -- CONTINUOUS JET FIGHTER 1 Try attacking the bottom of the disc, his force field may not be as strong. Jet 2 flys down and then up toward the bottom of the disc. He launches two missiles that also explode against the green glowing force field. JET FIGHTER 1 (CONT'D) Hawthorne, this is Deputy Dawg, the attack failed. The force field prevented penetration of our missiles. Request permission to return to base. CUT TO: INT. HAWTHORNE SECRET SUBMARINE BASE -- AFTERNOON The ADMIRAL is pacing the floor as he listens to the conversation from the attacking jets. RADIOMAN Sir, JET 1 is requesting permission to break off the attack. The force field is preventing any of their missiles from penetrating the disc. (CONTINUED)"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"78.

HIMMLER Initiate the bomb run now. FLYING DISC PILOT You got it boss. CUT TO: EXT. FALLING NUKE -- MOMENTS LATER The flying disc zooms down toward the Capital Building. The bomb bay doors open and the nuke is released. Immediately the flying disc shoots back into the air. The nuke falls toward the White House and crashes into the rose garden without exploding. CUT TO: INT. FLYING DISC COCKPIT-- CONTINUOUS HIMMLER and the FLYING DISC PILOT close their eye to protect them from the blast. Nothing happens. FLYING DISC PILOT (CONT'D) I show no explosion, no radiation is registering. HIMMLER That can't be. There should have been an air burst at 300 meters. FLYING DISC PILOT There was no air blast, nothing, nada. The nuke did not explode. HIMMLER Damn those scientists. They failed to properly set the altimeter.

He turns back to the pilot. HIMMLER Set course for our Scottish Base. FLYING DISC PILOT We should arrive in a little over four hours unless you want me to put the foot to the metal and arrive in an three hour time. HIMMLER No, the four hours is fine. I need time to think. FADE OUT: FADE IN: EXT. LOCH EILEAN DOOME CASTLE -- LATER The flying disc descends over Loch Eilean Doom Castle, it hovers and drops into the loch. Lights are seen in the water as it descends until the lights disappear. The flying disc moves through the water to a portal opening and enters. It travels into a large cavern, deep below the castle. The flying disc moves along side the dock where Nazi soldiers quickly tie up the vessel. The hatch opens and STARR, ABBEY, and HIMMLER steps out to the dock. HIMMLER Welcome to Loch Eilean Doome Castle. In Gaelic it means the Island of Doom. The castle was built in 1200 by Alexander II as a defense against the Vikings. ABBEY The view coming in was absolutely breathtaking. How did you ever come across this old castle? HIMMLER It wasn't hard, the family that owned this castle fell onto hard times and it was picked up for as you Americans say, for pennies. (CONTINUED)"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"80. STARR So what happens to us now? The nuke was a dud, your ice base is wiped out along with all of the cloning samples, and now your jungle base has bid the dust. The way I see it you are all finished. I am sure that you were tracked here so before long the Marines will once again descend and kick your sorry ass. ABBEY Why STARR, that is the most I have heard you say since this adventure began. HIMMLER We have one nuke left. I will make the most of it when it come time. The FLYING DISC PILOT steps out of the hatchway carrying a case. He walks by them standing on the dock. HIMMLER points to the case. HIMMLER (CONT'D) We will start the cloning process again. STARR What in the hell are you talking about? Your future has been destroyed. HIMMLER No, our future is still awaiting us. In that carrying case are the DNA samples of our top minds, and of course our Fuhrer. You did not think that we would have a back up as you call it, of DNA samples? ABBEY No, I did not think you would have a back up for the DNA samples nor did I think you had another cloning facilities. HIMMLER That is the problem with you Americans, you think you own the world, but you do not. When the Third Reich is ready, we will show you how to rule the world like kings, not as dogs as you Americans do. CUT TO:"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"81. INT. PRISON CELL -- LATER STARR and ABBEY are sitting in a prison cell. STARR is looking out the window. ABBEY Any chance we can escape through the window? STARR We could escape, but the drop down would kill us. ABBEY How about climbing up? STARR Only if you are a bird, there is no hand holds, the surface is smooth. ABBEY So what do you think will happen to us, will HIMMLER kill us? STARR No, I think his ego will force him to keep us alive so we can document his new cloned HITLER and the Nazis demented reign. ABBEY Don't forget they still have a nuke and they want to blow up London. STARR Actually, London will not blow up, it will melt down in a thermonuclear explosion. ABBEY Blow up or melt, it all the same, London will be history. CUT TO: INT. HAWTHORNE SECRET SUBMARINE BASE -- LATER The Admiral is standing in the control room talking on the red telephone. Several other officers are nearby. ADMIRAL Mr. President, we have tracked the flying disc with the two nukes to a castle on a remote island on the western edge of Scotland. We have the castle under satellite surveillance. (CONTINUED)"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82. ADMIRAL (CONT'D) I would agree with you. The Brits should be kept in the dark. The MARINE FORCE RECON TEAM can handle this situation. The ADMIRAL hangs up the red telephone and turns to the first Officer. ADMIRAL (CONT'D) The President has authorized us to send the Marines in to recover the last nuke. He is having enough problems with the Brits already, the nuke issue would the straw that broke the camels back. OFFICER I will see that the MARINE FORCE RECON team that hit the Brazilian compound routed to Scotland immediately. CUT TO: INT. CASTLE DINING ROOM -- EVENING STARR, ABBEY, and HIMMLER are seated at a long oak dining table. Food is being served by men in black Nazi uniforms.A large steak is placed before STARR. Wall hangings showing the Nazi icons are on the walls. Stone walls and small windows set in the stone walls. A suit of armor stand upright in the corner. ABBEY Is this going to be our last meal. HIMMLER Of course not, I know you Americans love your meat and this is some of the best beef in the world. It comes from our ranches in Argentina. STARR cuts into his steak using a steak knife and takes a bite. STARR You are right, this is one of the best tasting steak I have ever tasted. HIMMLER You are probably wondering what my plans are at this time. STARR The thought had crossed my mind. (CONTINUED)"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"83. HIMMLER The cloning process to create the new HITLER is underway and should be completed in four weeks. ABBEY Do you mean to tell me that it takes only four weeks to clone a human? HIMMLER Yes, our procedures are very advanced. We can accelerate a clone to adult size in just four weeks. STARR What are you going to do with the nuke? The last one was a dud. HIMMLER Yes, that is true, but this time we will use a different kind of trigger to explode the nuke. STARR So what kind of trigger will you use? HIMMLER Sorry, that information is not necessary for your book. I will allow you to tag along and witness the burning destruction of London. ABBEY You said STARR could tag along, you did not mention me. HIMMLER You will remain here as my guest. I am sure that STARR will be more cooperative with you as my guest. ABBEY That is not fair. HIMMLER Life is not fair. HIMMLER points to a tall Nazi in a black uniform. HIMMLER (CONT'D) That is Captain Heim. His father was the SS doctor, Aribert Heim. (CONTINUED)"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84. STARR I remember reading about Aribert Heim. He was a concentration camp doctor known as the Butcher of Mauthausen. He killed hundreds of prisoners. He is the top Nazi criminal that the authorities are looking for at this time. HIMMLER Be careful of what you say about Captain Heim's father, he has a long memory and does not forgive insults to his father. STARR The last I heard, authorities are still looking for Aribert Heim so they can stretch his neck. HIMMLHIMMLER Let the authorities look for him, all they want. He will never be found. ABBEY Why do you say he will never be found? HIMMLER His remains lies in the catacombs beneath this castle. He succumbed to cancer some ten years ago. His last wish was to be laid to rest in our catacombs and his death kept secret so the Allies will continue to waste money and time looking for him. HIMMLER turns to CAPTAIN HEIM and orders him to step forward. CAPTAIN HEIM steps forward and clicks his heals together. CAPTAIN HEIM Yes Sir. HIMMLER You will command the flying disc tomorrow and drop the nuke on London. You will escort STARR aboard and see that he is made comfortable. He is to witness the destruction of London.

STARR I have been honored to document this great and historic day. I would like your permission to sketch the nuke before you drop it. HEIM Why not, there is nothing you can do to harm the nuke. STARR gets up from his seat and walks to the holding bay. CUT TO: INT. FLYING DISC HOLDING BAY -- MOMENTS LATER STARR walks to the nuke sitting in the bomb release bay. He walks around examining it carefully. He sees the hydraulic line that activates the bomb doors. He pulls out the steak knife he had stolen previously and cuts the hydraulic line. He then takes out his sketch book and draws the nuke. He returns to the cabin. CUT TO: INT. FLYING DISC CABIN -- CONTINUOUS STARR walks to his seat. HEIM walks out of the cockpit.

A corporal is again finishing eating his candy bar and throws the paper on to the deck. MARINE FORCE RECON OFFICER Remember, keep your eyes open for the two civilians. This is a mop up operation, we must recover the last nuke. MARINE FORCE RECON CORPORAL Any chance this one is also a dud? MARINE FORCE RECON OFFICER The nuke dropped on the White House rose garden was not a dud, the trigger was disabled by either STARR or ABBEY. I suspect it was STARR. MARINE FORCE RECON CORPORAL What is the world coming to when a civilian can disable a nuke. MARINE FORCE RECON OFFICER If it wasn't for him, the White House would be history. MARINE FORCE RECON CORPORAL Okay, I hear you. They stand up and check each others riggings. The rear door opens. The candy bar wrapper is again sucked out of the rear.

I will seal that tunnel tighter then a virgin's pussy. The MARINE FORCE RECON CORPORAL attaches the scuba gear and walks to the water edge and disappears into the dark water.

HIMMLER is standing in front of the fireplace holding a cigar in one hand and a drink in the other. HIMMLER hears footsteps and turns to the hallway as HEIM and STARR walk into the parlor.

STARR I see that your Third Reich superiority has chinks in the armor. HIMMLER Nothing that can't be hammered out. ABBEY HIMMLER was just telling me of their plan for world domination. STARR I am sure that he has an inflated view. Let me see now, first his ice base was destroyed, second his jungle base was destroyed, and he still thinks he is the master in control of the world. HIMMLER It seems mighty strange that in both of those places, you were both present. Now you are here and there is a problem with the bomb release mechanism. I do not believe in happenstance.

ABBEY Listen buster, after what I went through with you in the Antarctica, Brazil, and Scotland, I have earned that right. STARR You certainly have earned that right.
