Most English translations of the I Ching emphasize academic approach and therefore highlight the Judgments of the 64 hexagrams and their individual lines or Yao. In such books, divination is simplistically explained and the student uses coins or yarrow stalks to derive a reading consisting of general advice with respect to the hexagrams and lines selected. Although students using the I Ching in such a manner may receive useful information and advice, the reading is very often general and composed of archaic language. More often, students are left with doubts regarding proper interpretation and cannot use their own intelligence to determine the true meaning. In addition, serious students have unanswered questions, such as the following: \"How were the hexagrams derived and their meaning determined? What is Yin and Yang and what relation do these con- cepts have to the hexagrams?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"8 The Tao Of 1-Ching Introduction 9 Why does divination work and for what purpose? What relation does the I Ching have to my life? How can I learn to divinate better? \" Finally, the student puts all of his or her questions together and summarizes as follows: \"The I Ching claims to be derived from nature in the simplest way, yet I do not find it simple. If the principles are simple, why can I not use the same principles to understand my life better? \" Anyone who has encountered these roadblocks and asked these questions will find the answers in this book. I would like to give some hints here on the approach to understanding the I Ching that will be most effective. First in order to understand the I Ching, we must be free of a scientific or regimented type of thinking. Taoist philosophy, in general, and the I Ching, particularly, are very different from modern science. The philosophy of the I Ching goes beyond the scope of \"science.\" The goal of the traditional scientist is to achieve standards of knowledge and then expand upon those standards. To standardize, the scientist uses a \"scientific method.\" That which cannot be measured, demonstrated in rigidly controlled experiments, or proven by meticulous observation cannot be used by the scientist to expand his knowledge. A scientific study is a careful exploration of what is popularly called the \"five senses.\" Through ingenuity, a scientist may find it possible to measure the \"invisible,\" however, even this must be done with tools that are perceived by the five senses. Taoism, like science, approaches life with this type of curiosity and desire for knowledge, but it goes beyond the limits of scientific standardization. Taoism recognizes that there is no single standard, of a scientific sort, for some of the most important and humanly meaningful things in life. The I Ching describes spheres that are a great deal more intangible than the five senses; they are most often referred to as the \"mental\" or \"spiritual\". The I Ching reveals the great wisdom and understanding of the ancient Chinese philosophers. They looked at the world around them and sought to understand why and how change occurs. They did not look beyond reality or ascribe all events to the \"hand of God. \" Instead, they found enlightenment through the very practical process of examin- ing the concepts of space and time. By understanding time and the cycle of life, they could explain all events. Because they did not assume that everything was caused by God, they sought to find the explanation of change in the person, thing, or event itself. Second, the I Ching deals with that which is intangible. Therefore, the mental and spiritual preoccupation of the individual using the I Ching will necessarily influence the meaning to be derived. In studying the I Ching's methods of interpreting life, one must keep this in mind. For example, suppose two people look at the full moon and appreciate the atmosphere and energy it creates. Although one person may feel awed by a sense of the beauty and peace and feel a boundless gratitude and happiness towards life; another person may appreciate the power of the moon, but be moved to misery and tears. Why? He may be saddened by the memory of a friend that died and how they had once enjoyed full moon evenings together. Everything has this quality. A man may lose all of his possessions and laugh carelessly, only because he has just come from the doctor and learned that he does not have a fatal disease after all. Another man may cry at good luck because the bad luck that preceded has devastated him. Because of this fundamental fact, whenever there is an event, one must relate it to the existing situation in a thorough way to truly understand its meaning. The same principle is true for the divination of Yin and Yang lines. Consider the following simple divination: a broken line is drawn (yin), meaning presently unfavorable, and a solid line is drawn (yang) meaning very active right now, a time to move. One person may draw yang and interpret it to mean \"it is time to ask the boss for a raise.\" Another person may draw yang and decide that it is finally the right time for him to climb that mountain in China he had alway wanted to try. Another person may draw yang and uses it for guidance in a major business decision. Thus, the same simple line has given self-guidance to three people in totally different situations. The philosophy of the I Ching is that this multiplicity and variety is a natural part of life, and that if we want to learn to live more effectively, we need only study the I Ching and work with it. The third point, and perhaps most important thing, I can make about the I Ching is that you will understand nothing unless you spend time researching the meaning of the I Ching for yourself. In addition, you will gain nothing if you do not like to exercise your judgment and"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"10 The Tao Of I-Ching Introduction 11 i magination; that is, if you always expect someone else to tell you what is right and how to do things. The person who has some insight and is willing to take personal initiative can use the I Ching to make work more effective and enjoy life more fully. This book is a concrete example of what I mean by an open-minded approach to change. I have written it for a person with a western back- ground. My student Louis and I evolved a simple approach to translating the I Ching from a western perspective. After Sunday Tai Chi class, we would meet at a diner and I would describe the work for the week. Louis would take notes and my handwritten English translations. The following week he would produce a typewritten text for editing. His questions and suggestions told me exactly what needed to be explained more fully for a western mind. Because of his help, I was able to proceed with this book rapidly while continuing a great many other activities. Louis is a good example of a student's progress. As the work progressed, he not only helped me find the right words, but took up his own studies. Although he had lived in a rural and scenic area all of his life, he began to appreciate the natural beauty of his surroundings that he had always taken for granted. He used nature to define the meanings of the energies described in the I Ching and to make his understanding direct rather than a matter of memorized words. When he took up divination he asked \"How can I be sure I am learning to do this well?\" He decided to study developing news events and then compare what actually happened with the explicit \"judgments\" he divinated. Finally, he worked at seeing some of the things in his everyday life in terms of Yin and Yang and the I Ching. I believe that Louis presently knows a little bit about the I Ching. It is only the beginning, but it is something real, and it is becoming part of his skills as a person. Would he know as much if he had studied as a scholar for twenty years, but could only quote hundreds of different fine points of interpretation? If he had troubles in everyday life would this knowledge be any use to him? If he had good fortune, could he use his knowledge to make the most of it for himself and others? The answer is simply, never. On the basis of the foregoing, I warn you against the specialized scholarly approach. It is valuable, but too limited for a person to live with. To depend upon another person's interpretations is an example of letting someone else decide your life. You alone must live your life. Consider the following: the four great men of the I Ching are Fu Hsi, its originator; King Wen, who interpreted the hexagrams, the Duke of Chou, who wrote on the lines; and Confucius, who reviewed the whole. One can spend years studying the lore of these men yet learn nothing. It is far better to use only the first, Fu Hsi, as your inspiration. Remember that he had no one to teach him and no one to tell him what to do, therefore, he found his answers by taking life itself as his teacher. When studing these teachers, follow the spirit of their teaching, but always remember to accommodate the message to your personal circumstance. _ An example of following the Spirit of the I Ching can be found in the interpretation of the seasons. Athough the study of the times and the season are deeply related to the I Ching in traditional Chinese culture, it is too complex and specialized to describe fully here. Instead I use the open-minded spirit of \"change\" and give the basics for the student to use. January has definite meanings in the I Ching cycles, since it is mid-winter, but if you live in Australia, you had better not study January if you want to learn about winter. You must take the initiative to turn things completely around and study July instead. Likewise, when we read the inspiring translations of the I Ching's scholars, it is important to consider their original meaning. Consider the following translation: \"It is time to cross the great river.\" Try to feel the meaning and spirit of this advice. Cross the Great River? Get on a ferry boat? Get your feet wet? Look at the water and be inspired? Remember, when these words were written the world was a primitive and unsettled and often dangerous place. The simple act of fording a wide river by boat could end in disaster if one was careless or unskilled. Thus, the real meaning becomes, \"the times are good for undertaking difficult things. \" Again, consider the terse comment: \" There are no fish in the bag \" . Ask yourself what would Confucius say if he lived today. He'd probably pen something like this: \" There is no money in the checking account! \" Do this with everything you meet, and you will be a true student of the I Ching by learning to understand yourself and others. The material I have put together for you covers a wide field of study. Sometimes I have found it preferable not to explain everything fully, in order to show basic principles and give enough guidance for you to do your own work."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"1 2 The Tao Of I-Ching Introduction 1 3 Following is some of the information you will find in this book: * A description of how the Tai Chi diagram creates the meaning of Yin and Yang, and the basic principles of their alternation. The material will show how a student can'evolve the meanings of the trigrams directly from this central concept. Further material shows how the hexagrams develop directly Ying to Yang. * The method of divination using yarrow stalks or coins is presented along with other more dynamic methods by which you can divinate directly from life and events around you. * The use of a three part divination is explained, and how the principles of the five elements can be used for interpretation. There are some specific examples here to help you start. * A traditional picture for each hexagram that summarizes its qualities visually instead of with words is given. This will help you learn to use non-verbal creative concepts in understanding advanced concepts. The pictures are old-fashioned. What can you do about this, can you tell me? * The material with the hexagrams shows how translation of the traditional meanings can be taken the next step into relevant personal translations. Included here are also many details on the lore of divination as applied to the specific hexagrams and their line, or Yao. There is much more. And there is no reason why you should not get a loose-leaf notebook, number it, and begin jotting down your own notes on each hexagram immediately. Get to work! In a more serious tone, we must each evolve our own feeling for what these activities mean. When we divinate we are going further than our five senses, and we are appealing to the spiritual world that surrounds and pervades everything for our guidance. This will differ for each of us. I belive the principle for each of us is that the I Ching arid its divinations is a blueprint from the \"fourth dimension\" to guide us in leading our lives in this third dimensional world. The concept of our evolving relationship with the fourth dimensional world is more fully described in my book, \"The Tao of Meditation.\" Meditation is still another way of approaching this fourth dimensional world and developing our place in it. Some may ask, \" Which is best, Meditation, the I Ching or Tai Chi Chuan?\" The question is like asking whether warm is better than cool. You may find that studying meditation or Tai Chi Chuan gives you a simpler and more direct understanding of the I Ching. Alternatively, you may find that your study of the I Ching is directly helping your progress in meditation and Tai Chi Chuan. Since the I Ching was first translated into German and other languages, it has awakened great interest and fascinated countless people. Yet, I believe this interest is only a fraction of the attention it deserves when it is used in the way it was created to be used. I wish everyone the best of fortunes in their studies. Remember, this is not a book on Chinese culture or philosophy. This is a book about things no more exclusively Chinese than a lake, a person or the sky. There are a number of people who have been helpful in the writing of this book. Without their advice, assistance and encouragement. Writing this book would have been much more difficult. I would especially like to thank of the following: Louis Kovi, Mindy Sheps, Marsha Rosa, Paul, Albe, Susanna Thompson, Victor Franco. And, I extend a very special gratitude to Dr. Shoshana Adler for her help in proofreading the first half of the text at the workshop in Eureka Springs, Arkansas.

It represents both the source of Chinese culture, and a key to the understanding of Chinese history, even in its most turbulent stages. This is notable during the reign of' Chin Shih-Huang( aG see figure 1-la), the first emperor of the Chin Dynasty( 4 221-207 B.C.), who succeeded in unifying six other kingdoms of the country. Chin adopted a series of strict measures to unify the country. The most lasting of these was the adoption of a single language. He also evolved a tyrannical system of suppression that he thought would establish his dynasty forever. His strategy was the destruction of all learning in order to keep people in an ignorant and submissive state. Thus in 215 B.C. he ordered all the scholars buried alive to humiliate them, and searched out and destroyed all of' the country ' s works of literature and philosophy, including the most revered classics. However, Chin saved one book, the I Ching. He and his officials needed it for political guidance and divination. Thus the I Ching has been transmitted to us from the past without 1-1 Returning to the Roots"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"1 6 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter One Raising The Veil Of Mystery 17 Figure 1-la any serious interruption. There was a gradual evolution and three different I Chings have been developed. In the Hsia Dynasty ( 2205-1766 B.C.), the Tui trigram ( 10, which was the image of lake, was doubled and became the first hexagram in the series of 64. This arrangement was called Lien Shan (A iii ). In the Shang Dynasty ( 0 1766-1150 B.C.), the trigram Kun ( h fF ), which symbolizes the receptive earth, was doubled and became the first hexagram. This arrangement was called Kuei Tsang ( f ). Finally, in the Chou Dynasty ( 1150-249 B.C.), Chien (~F ) the symbol of creativity and heaven, was doubled to make the first hexagram. This arrangement was called Chou I (l MA ). Since written language was not well- developed during the Hsia and the Shang Dynasties (in fact, records were kept on tortoise shells) knowledge of the Lien Shan and Kuei Tsang was largely extinct by the time of the Chin Dynasty. What remains today is the Chou I, which we call the I Ching, or simply I. The Chinese character for the word I is created by combining the symbols for the sun ( 0 ) and the moon ( ), and this combination presents the most fundamental perception of Chinese philosophy towards experience and life. Later we will see these formalized into the symbols of Yin and Yang, but before the symbols there is the observable actuality. First, the sun and moon are alternating qualities that follow each other in a circular path. The sun rises and comes to its zenith, and begins to decline. It disappears below the horizon, and the moon appears. The moon is followed by the sun, and then follows the sun again. First one dominates, then the other. There is also the opposition of the sun and moon in their qualities. The sun is huge, yet distant beyond imagination. Its tremendous energy brings the warmth and light that is responsible for all life on earth. The moon is smaller even than the earth, yet it is closer to the earth than the sun, so it raises powerful tides in the oceans and also — as scientists are beginning to study — in the tissues of all living things. The moon is dark and has no light, yet it shines brightly and dimly and brightly again with the light of the sun. The moon changes the quality of the sun through polarization. Together, the opposing qualities of the sun and moon create a complex and always changing series of influences on the life of our planet. As we observe the interaction of their opposition, we come to another perception — that their contrasts and the contrasts of similar energies here on earth are what make our life. Thus we can say that they not only oppose each other, but also complement each other. To understand this, we need only consider a photo. It is shades of light and darkress. Take away all the darkness, and what do we have? Take away all the light, and what do we have? The study of the I Ching considers all the things we experience, do, say, feel, and deal with, and finds this same contrast of qualities. Without it, there is nothing. With it, anything in our world may be seen and described. Our world and life are based on the activity and changes of complements. But this only happens because within the changes there is always constancy. To imagine this, think of a light burning brightly forever, with no shadow. This is one kind of constancy. It is easy to imagine. Now imagine a light fluctuating with darkness forever in a way that has no pattern and no order. We might perceive this, yet the perception would have no meaning. Just as we might act, yet never know the meaning of our acts if there were no stable conditions to reflect that meaning to us."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"1 8 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter One Raising The Veil Of Mystery 1 9 Finally, consider a light that grows bright and then dims to darkness and then brightens again in an endless cycle. Now the repetition of the contrasting parts of light and darkness has become a constant cycle. Because it moves and shows detail of shadow and light, we have perceptions. Because it goes through the same cycle again and again, the perceptions follow patterns that we come to learn, until finally the whole richness and complexity of our world and our lives appears. Thus the constancy of cycles that repeat themselves faithfully makes possible all that we experience and do. These cycles always bring us change and the freedom to change, and at the same time create the unchanging foundation of our life and world. Out of this, we analyze the word I to have three distinct qualities: Chien I ( ) or easy and simple, reflects on how easy and simple our world is in its make-up; Pien I ( ) refers to its aspect of continuous change; and Pu I (T T ) refers to its constancy. Thus the book I starts with this precise observation of universal phenomena and of our daily life. These primary data of life are simple and easy to understand. As it is said in Ta Chuan ( ): Chien ( ) knows through the easy Kun ( ) does things simply What is easy is easy to know What is simple is simple to follow He who is easy to know makes friends He who is simple to follow attains good works He who possesses friends can endure forever He who performs good works can become great. — 1-2 Ancient Chinese Wisdom ~El A specific description of how the I Ching was created is given in the Ta Chuan ( ) or Great Treatise: \"In the I Ching there is the Tai Chi or Grand Terminus ( 4i ), which generates the two forms or Liung Yi ( ). Those two forms generate the four symbols of Ssu Hsiang ( Y9' ), and those four create the eight trigrams or Pa Kua (A ).\" This passage obviously tells us that if we intend to study the book of the I Ching, we have to follow a logical progression, first understanding the meaning of Tai Chi and then how this meaning pro- gresses to Liung Yi, Ssu Hsiang, and Pa Kua. If we simply read the judgments and images of the hexagrams, we are like a person who tries to learn about the nature of a large forest without studying its surroundings. This person sees a profusion of meanings, first one thing, then another, but he never looks beyond the forest. He comes away with vague impressions. He never knows that through the thick cover of leaves overhead there is the sky, or that in one direction the edge of the forest is a short distance away, while in another direction are dense thickets. So we must first know the Tai Chi. But here the I Ching is reticent, for it does not state where the Tai Chi comes from. Its origin, however, is discussed in ancient Chinese philosophy, and given the name Wu Chi ( ) or Hsien Tien ( ). Wu Chi means \"what there is before the universe comes into being. \" Can we imagine this? We can begin by considering smaller examples of Wu Chi in everyday life. For in Chinese philosophy, we say that every part of life operates the same as the Tao or universe as a whole. The microcosm faithfully follows the macrocosm. First we need to know what the concept of change is, as defined by Wu Chi. If there is no change, then nothing came out of Wu Chi. If there is change or even the possibility of change, we say then that the situation of Tai Chi is beginning. That is why the I Ching is also referred to by another name: \"The Book of Changes.\" We can see the change from Wu Chi to Tai Chi in an apple. Imagine that the apple is in a state of Wu Chi. It simply is there. But then bacteria develop in the apple and it starts to spoil. At first there is only a tiny part spoiling, too small to be seen. Then it becomes visible, the size of a pinhead. By stages it grows larger and progresses until finally the whole apple is gone. As long as it was an apple, it was Wu Chi. But the moment the bacteria began spoiling it, the stage of Tai Chi began. The same is seen in the formation of a tornado. At first there are only gentle breezes, no tornado, or Wu Chi. Then there is an acceleration of the breezes, and they begin to travel in circular motions instead of just randomly flowing. This is now the Tai Chi of the tornado. The breezes grow stronger and a definite circular wind is created that picks"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"v- 20 The Tao Of I-Ching up loose leaves and twigs from the ground and throws them high in the air in circular patterns. Finally all the wind energy from the surrounding area becomes funnelled into this circular motion, and tremendous forces begin to build up. Now people cry \"tornado\" and hide in the cellar. The tornado moves slowly along with the sound of a dozen express trains and tears loose everything it touches. Houses, trees, and rocks are drawn up into its vortex and cast away. At some point, however, the tornado starts to lose its force and slow down. Soon it has only moderate force. Finally, it cannot be detected at all. It is gone, and Tai Chi has returned to Wu Chi. All we observe in life, including ourselves, follows this pattern. Before we exist in this world, we are Wu Chi. When we are born, we begin the stage of Tai Chi. At first we are small and weak. Slowly we grow strong and live our mature years. Finally we die, and the matter that formed our bodies is dispersed like the breezes that formed the tornado. We have returned to Wu Chi. When Wu Chi changes to Tai Chi and a thing exists and can be observed, a duality begins. At any time that a thing exists, part of it is changing and part remains unchanged. Like the apple, part of it is still good and can be eaten and part is spoiled. Or the tornado, part of the atmosphere is drawn into it and part is unaffected. We call the unchanging part Yin and the changing part Yang. Chinese philosophers use a circle (0) to represent Yang and a solid black circle (• ) to represent Yin. Another notation is a broken line - - for Yin and a solid line — for Yang. It does not matter which symbol stands for Yin and which for Yang, and we can also reverse the process. The important thing is to understand the major characteristic of the duality: where there is Yin, there is also Yang, and vice-versa. For example, there are men and women. We can say a man's character is vigorous and intense like fire; and that a woman's is tender and gentle like water. Since we link man and fire together, we say they are both Yang qualities, and likewise that women and water are Yin. This points out another quality of Yin and Yang: we can apply them to any object or process we observe in our world. They are not to describe some particular object, but are for all dualities, and refer to all of them. Thus Lao Tzu said: \"A single Yin cannot be born, and a single Yang cannot be grown. \" (fJJ1{ , lJ. f' g TA). We can see how there must always be Yin where there is Yang Chapter One Raising The Veil Of Mystery 21 by considering electricity. Light and power come from energy flowing across positive and negative poles. If there is only one pole, we find nothing. We can see another principle by observing how the positive and negative charges are named. If we have only one particle of charge, it cannot be given a name. We can only name it by comparing it to another particle to see if they attract or repel. If they repel, they are identical charges, but if they attract, one is positive and one is negative. Which is which? It does not matter. We simply give our test particle a name and the other particle the opposite name. This corresponds with the I Ching commentary: \"One Yin and one Yang make the Tao.\" ( - f -{' ). What we have discussed so far can be illustrated in the following way as shown in figure 12a. Yang Yin Figure 1-2a In this diagram we see Wu Chi giving birth to a Tai Chi state. If there is no movement in the beginning stage of Tai Chi, then its Yin and Yang are combined, as in a storage battery for electricity. But if there is movement, then Yin and Yang separate and become distinct, just as the battery uses opposite ends of the pole to produce heat, energy, and light. In this separation of the Tai Chi, the two symbols of Liung Yi are created. These basic first steps later evolve into the I Ching trigrams and hexagrams. This philosophy of Yin and Yang within the I Ching has three basic aspects: 1. Hsiang (it) or symbol.

This deals in accurate forecasting, and includes the writings, judgments and images of the I Ching — what we have from the four sages Fu Hsi, King Wen, Duke of Chou, and Confucius. 3. Shu ( ) or number. Here numbers are used to deduce the likelihood of future events by reviewing what has happened in the past. In modern computers a binary system is used that creates numbers by using two opposed elements, just as we have Yin and Yang in the I Ching. And just as we say that Yin and Yang can picture our whole world, we find that a computer can produce an abstract formulation of any words, logic, pictures, or calculations using only these two symbols. These three aspects are specialized parts of the whole I Ching. To understand the I Ching, we need to learn about each of them. In Chinese history, there have been various schools of study, each emphasizing one of the these three aspects. For example: 1. The philosophical theories of the scholars of the Han Dynasty (206 B.C. — 219 A.D.) or the Ni Li School ( ). Studying, emphasizing, following, and explaining the texts of the four sages Fu Hsi, King Wen, Duke of Chou, and Confucius. 2. Philosophical theories of the scholars of the Sung Dynasty, (960-1279) or Hsiang Shu School ( l i ). Researching and studying the trigrams and hexagrams and how they relate to mathematical symbols and philosophy. 3. The Taoist School ( ). Using the philosophy and principles of I Ching to develop Tai Chi Chuan and meditation techniques, etc. For Tai Chi, the inner trigram represents one's state of mind and the outer one the condition of one's body. These two sets of trigrams have been translated into a series of continuous movements, incorporating the constant changing between Yin and Yang. For meditation, the hexagrams indicate how the chi flows in the body during meditation. A famous book Gen Tung Chi (Zr1') discusses this process in detail. Ironically, my interest in the I Ching came after my interest and experience in Tai Chi and meditation. By studying the I Ching I gained greater understanding of Tai Chi and meditation because I could see more clearly how they were created and developed. 4. Chan Pu School ( r$ Fa) or divination. Using the inductive and deductive methods to predict the future. (This method will be emphasized in this book.) Chapter One Raising The Veil Of Mystery 23 These various schools of study are not contradictory. They are simply different ways of approaching and understanding the I Ching as a building and each school as a window, each giving a different view. Whatever window you look through influences what you will see, but you are still in the I Ching \"building\". The I Ching uses the arrangement of lines in a sequence. The places that the lines fill in the sequence are called Yao (_x ). A Yao may be filled with either a solid or broken line. The line indicates Yin or Yang. All dualities, all contrasts of any sort, can be characterized as Yin for one of the pair, and Yang for the other. If we call darkness Yin, then light is Yang. If we call cold Yin, then hot is Yang. And so on. By using several Yao we may summarize a very complicated situation, filling in the spaces with either Yin or Yang lines. For example we can take each Yao to represent a period of time. We have a cup of very hot coffee which eventually becomes cold. We express this with t wo Yaos. The starting Yao is the bottom line and indicates hot. The top Yao indicates cold. The Yaos are always read from bottom to top. Reading the Yaos can be compared to reading a sign on the highway. The name of the coming exit, for example \" South \" , would appear under the name of the following exit, for example \"North\". The driver of a vehicle would read the sign from bottom to top to find out which exit comes first, which comes second, and so on. See figure 1-3a below: North I South 1 Figure 1-3a The set of two lines used to describe \" the cup of coffee in time \" is one of the four symbols. We can use the Tai Chi diagram to derive these four symbols in an orderly way, or tree system, as seen in 1-3 The Four Symbols El Ell ED 1E1"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2 4 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter One Raising The Veil Of Mystery 25 figure I-3b. Next to this diagram, we see another way of generating the four symbols by reading the quarters of two concentric circles, beginning from the inside, to generate the four symbols as shown in figure 1-3c. Greater Lesser Lesser Greater Yin (SCI ) Y a n g ( ) ) Y i n ( ) ) Figure 1-3b Figure 1-3c We need to learn how the four symbols can logically follow one another in events, and we can observe an example of this by looking at our moon. The moon is a whole like the Tai Chi sphere, and when we add time to our observation of it, it begins to separate into Yin and Yang. Thus we have the New Moon and the Full Moon, and this is like • and 0, orYin (- -) andYang ( — ). We also name the halfway points between New and Full the First Quarter and Last Quarter. Below we can see how this naming is exactly the same as a circular sequence of the four symbols as shown in figure 1-3d. First Last New Quarter Full Quarter Yin Yin to Yang Yang Yang to Yin Greater Lesser Greater Lesser Yin Yang Yang Yin Figure 1-3d Still another use of the four symbols is to describe our seasons as shown in figure 1-3e. Winter Spring Summer Fall very from cold very from hot cold to warm hot to cold Fi g ure 1 -3e If we assign north as Yin and south as Yang, we can easily work out how the directions of the compass can be indicated with the four symbols. In fact the use of the lines has a wide applicability in geometry and mathematics. If we consider Yang as going along a line from the original point 0 to the right, and Yin from 0 to the left, we can see from this basic definition how easily the two dimensional graph of plane geometry is set up as shown in figure 1-3f and 1-3g. 4 Ssu Hsiang of Four Symbols Figure 1-3g In this system, the bottom line of the symbol is the horizontal axis and the top line represents the vertical axis. If we wish to add a third Yao, we can go on to a three dimensional graph for solid geometry. In mathematics, we can assign Yang as zero and Yin as one and thus derive a binary system. The four symbols can describe not only the moon's phases, but also a man's destiny, or that of a society. The Greater Yin is like a person who is not established in anything. In societies we might compare this with the emerging nations of Africa. Here a person or nation must take what little they know and plan and work with it. The next stage is Lesser Yang. This is like a young man just rising in the world, or a nation like China that is just establishing itself. Here there are great challenges and activities and constant changes to be met. Then we have the Greater Yang. This is like a successful businessman or a nation like America that is strongly established and powerful. Here the need is to always Yang ( fir$ ) O toE, i Yin 0 Liung Yi or Two forms Figure 1-3f Yang (—,—) 0"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"2 6 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter One Raising The Veil Of Mystery 27 use great care to maintain things, for otherwise decline will come rapidly. Finally in Lesser Yin we find a person or nation that has passed its peak of development and has begun to decline. Since this is like the fall of the year, its major quality is that it must harvest its riches from the past with good judgment in order to endure the coming winter. In this kind of investigation we can see clearly what part of the cycle a person or society occupies. We can look at ourselves this way and decide how to be. A person who has high standards and wants good things from life, for example, never says, \" Oh, everything is fine now, I don ' t have to worry or pay attention \" , even when he achieves success. If he s tys and believes such things, he immediately leads himself into a decline. Instead, he will say, \"I want to do better.\" Thus he is always learning something new, always taking himself back to the stage of Greater Yin to start anew and recreate himself. We can see this simple cycle in still another way: the cycle of our day. When a man is asleep, he is Greater Yin. Then he awakes and gets going with the morning preparations. This is Lesser Yang. Finally, he gets to work and is using his full powers. This is Greater Yang. Then he goes home and relaxes, resting from serious things, and doing less demanding things. Here he is at Lesser Yin. Finally, he goes to bed and the cycle begins again. The Yin-Yang balance is crucial to understanding. In some situations, Yin may be more desirable. In others, Yang may be more desirable. We must seek one and avoid the other. But even this we must do by following the observation in the I Ching that Yin always begets Yang and Yang always begets Yin. We must study this movement and reciprocity and follow it wisely. We can see from these simple examples how people seriously using the I Ching can greatly enhance their understanding of themselves or the world. A person who has not considered this need of personal initiative might say, \"This is too simple! A child can understand it.\" But a child lacks the breadth of knowledge and maturity of an adult. And adults vary in the amount of maturity and ability they have developed. These traits are derived directly from the initiative they have taken to develop themselves. Those who have interest and initiative in their lives can use the I Ching to great benefit. One of the most important philosophical uses of the I Ching is in developing our emotions. The poet Shelley speaks with foreboding of the wild west wind and the cruel winter changes it is bringing. Then, after developing this image through his whole poem, he concludes: \"Oh Wind, if winter comes, can Spring be far behind?\" Thus, if some event or emotion happens to bring with it great distress and unhappiness for us, we need not be like the unknowing child who thinks \"Oh, everything is all over for me!\" We can look to the changing cycle that must occur in every event, and see that even bad feelings cannot last forever. New opportunities will be coming for us, which we may develop successfully. All of these philosophical and other observations can be seen in the simple foundation of the Tai Chi model. That model comes from Wu Chi and splits into Yin and Yang, and then the four symbols. But to learn about the sixty-four hexagrams of the I Ching we must understand the final derivation of the eight trigrams. I Ching history tells us that the evolution of the trigrams comes from the first Emperor, Fu Hsi ( 2953-2838 B.C. see figure 1-4a) It is said that Fu Hsi set out to study all of heaven and earth. He turned his eyes to the heavens and studied astronomy as well as the movements of the sun, the stars, the moon, and the planets. He turned back to earth and observed the flat, the rolling, and the mountainous land. How some soil was good for tilling and other soil was not. He studied the weather, the tides, the storms, and the regular changes of the seasons. Natural Figure l-4a The Eight Trigrams: Heaven, Earth and Humanity 11."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"2 8 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter One Raising The Veil Of Mystery 29 history claimed his interest, and he watched the birds and the animals, and deciphered their languages. Finally he turned to observe and study within himself. Out of this he created the eight trigrams as a method to commune with the spiritual and invisible world, and a way to be part of everything within the visible world. He also used it to represent the relationships of everything in our three dimensional world and to build images of anything in our world. We can see here how important human experience and exploration are in the foundation of the I Ching. The trigrams were developed by a man of relentless curiosity who wished to understand all things. We can begin to study the eight trigrams by observing how simply they are derived from the Tai Chi. Two different methods are used to describe this process in figures below. One uses a rectangular block formation, see in figure 1-4b the other uses a tree diagram as shown in figure 1-4c. AB A ;? ;\", . HIMMIEn Lesser Yang. K.

It is created by taking the rectangular blocks and forming them into a circle as shown in figure 1-4d.

Note that each set is symmetrical with of Yin and Yang reversed, and that the order of one to eight follows that derived with the rectangular bars as shown in figure 1-4e. Figure 1-4e Chapter One Raising The Veil Of Mystery 31 If we are familiar with the binary system of enumeration, we may recall the eight trigrams simply by reading off the numbers 0 through 7 using the 0 to represent a Yang line and the 1 to represent a Yin line, or vice-versa. For example: Tui — is the same as 001 or 1 Kan is the same as 101 or 5 All eight are written as follows: Trigram Symbol Binary System Decimal System Order Chien 000 0 1 Tui 001 1 2 Li 010 2 3 - - Chen 011 3 4 Sun 100 4 5 — Kan 101 5 6 Ken 110 6 7 Kun 111 7 8 (Note: Normally, binary and decimal numbers are read from right to left. However, I recommend reversing the order of reading to avoid confusion. Always read from left to right to derive the eight trigrams. For example, \"001\" is read Yang, Yang, Yin, or —, —, - -.) Finally, if we take our Tai-Chi symbol and rotate its center a little to more visibly symbolize the intermingling of Yin and Yang, we can read the eight trigrams in it by taking eight sections as shown in figure 1-4f. 30 Symbol Chien Kun _ Chen The Tao Of I-Ching Chinese Name Sharp Order Three Continuous 1 Three Broken 8 Upwards Cup 4"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"32 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter One Raising The Veil Of Mystery 33 Sun Figure 1-4f By reading the eight sections from the Tai Chi symbol, we arrive at an arrangement like this as shown in figure 1-4g. Figure 1-4g This arrangement is called the Hsien Tien ( ) arrangement, and it is believed to have been . developed by Fu Hsi. In addition to this Hsien Tien circular arrangement there is another called the Hu Tien ( W ) that is traditionally credited to Chou Wen Wang (lk 5cl. ) who founded the Chou Dynasty circa 1143 B. C., as shown in figure 1-4h. Li Sun Kun S Figure 1-4h The eight trigrams of Hu Tien are based on the I Ching passage that reads: \"The ruler comes forth in Chen with his creation. He completes the work in Sun. He causes things to see one another in Li and to serve one another in Kun. He rejoices in Tui and battles in Chien. He is comforted and rests in Kan, and then finishes the work of the year in Ken.\" We can see how this cycle 'begins in the east and the spring of the year and proceeds in a clockwise cycle. This sequence of trigrams was used to explain the principle of the movement and cycles of the universe, and the Chinese calendar was created from it. Later on we will explain in detail how the Hsien Tien and the Hu Tien are interrelated for use in divination. Once we have arrived at eight trigrams, we then have three lines for each. With Yin and Yang we have two, and the addition of a third line symbolizes creation, particularly the creation of humanity by heaven and earth. Just as man and woman create a child through their relation- ship; heaven and earth, Yin and Yang are seen as not only existing apart, but as interacting and producing a new, third quality. This is called Three Powers or San Tsai ( E 1' ), as shown in figure 1-4i.

When we look at a hexagram, we take the first two bottom lines as the Yaos of earth, the next two as the Yaos of humanity, and the top two as those of heaven. The addition of the third quality locates humanity within the universe in a meaningful way. Because humanity's relation to the Tao is of the most vital interest, one of the important uses of the eight trigrams is to describe social relations. The simplest society is that of the family of father, mother, and child. The father is identified with Chien ( ), the mother with Kun ( ), and the remaining six trigrams are the three sons and three daughters. To derive the three sons, we imagine the Chien intermingling with the Kun, and giving it one of its solid lines as shown in figure 1-4j. i Chien (father) - - - - - - - \tt r i Ken h Chen Kun (mother) I i Kan -+d -- I ~— — -- C • — N I -- I ,- I . Middle Oldest son son Figure 1-4j Figure 1-4k To eventually understand the hexagrams, we must first assign meanings to each of the eight trigrams. The evolution of these meanings can be understood if we consider the Hu Tien arrangement that was used to evolve the Chinese calendar. Each season of the year has a trigram. If we look about during each season at the different things happening and the influence on our lives and moods, then we can give a meaning to each one. Thus, if Chien stands for the late fall and early winter, we can imagine a tree that has grown all summer and has now dropped its leaves and withdrawn its sap into its roots. If we look at this and other late fall phenomenon we can evolve an image of strength and resourceful- ness. We can call this Chien. If we go back a step to early fall, we may think of the farm family working to bring in the rich harvest of crops during the warm Indian summer. From this we can sense a mood of energetic joyfulness, and call it Tui. If we go a step forward from Chien, we can imagine the dead of winter, a time of hidden dangers for the unwary person — like the motorist whose car runs out of gas in a storm and who almost freezes to death. We can call this phase Kan. In the following table, some of the traditional attributes of the eight trigrams that have been developed are given, along with the inner relations — parts of the body, season, time and so on. The different Youngest son"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"36 The Tao Of I-Ching tables are not arbitrary inventions, but have evolved over the centuries in a trial-and-error way through observation, and we should expect to find modern parallels. For example, Kun tends to represent activity of a responsive sort, such as \"work.\" Its time is from 1 to 5 p.m. Modern scientists of body rhythms, paying no attention to the I Ching, have independently discovered that the time of day when a person is \"most able to cope\" is this same period. The student should memorize the tables and also work out indi- vidually each part of the table to develop themselves, A wild pig, for example, would tend to attack a traveller by rushing from concealment in a fast dangerous charge. Thus it is represented by Kan. Dogs for thousands of years have been guards and protectors of the home, hence it is easy to see how they are related to Ken. Some of the attributes — such as liver and Chen — relate to specialized branches of knowledge that are not clear unless we have studied them. However, most can be figured out with common sense and will train us to develop our perceptions. The more we study the basic symbols and how they work, and then relate other things to them, the more we will begin to learn. In studying, we must keep an open mind and not look for a single solution that never changes. A hotel, for instance, means Ken, because it is where people stop for the night and are inactive. But if it has a nightclub in it, then we are looking at the Tui aspect of it.

The structure of the I Ching evolved over several thousand years, with four individuals making the major contributions. The first was Fu Hsi ( 2953-2838 B.C.) who created and named the hexagrams. King Wen (3C~ ), founder of the Chou Dynasty (1150-249 B.C.), then gave an explanation of each of the 64 hexagrams. A brief text accompanies each hexagram and contains a decision or judgment. The text is called Kua Tsi ( Ih g ). King Wen's son, Duke Chou ( ), then added a text in which the meaning of each of the six lines is individually examined. This is called the Yao Tsi ( j4_ 64). Finally, Confucius ( 550-478 B.C.) made a lifelong study of the existing work and added both general comments on the philosophy and specific comments on the hexagrams. His work is called the Chuan (4 ) or Appendices, of Ten Wings ( -{- ). Here is a sample of the first hexagram of the I Ching. The entire text of the I Ching contains explanations of each of the 64 hexagrams. When we study the I Ching, our teacher is life and nature, not the writings of other persons. Ii we really understand the I Ching, we do not need to refer to or quote the writings of others. An example of this is Confucius' greatest follower, Mencius, who in his written work never discussed the I Ching and yet all of his work is developed from the principles of the I Ching. This is the kind of person who 1-5 The Structure of the I Ching - - Li - - - Chen Blue and sand stone ( ), great highway, young fellow, announcer, operator, the liver, broadcast, telephone.

Such a person is like the poet Shelley, quoted earlier. Shelley never heard about or learned of the I Ching, yet he understood its approach. If we study different ways of deriving the 8 trigrams and the 64 hexagrams from the original Tai Chi sphere, then we will begin to understand the way they are grouped and their meanings will become clearer. We have already seen this in the simple way the four symbols describe the phases of the moon or a person's development. Each taken alone, the four symbols are useful, but when put in a series that follows a cycle, they become many times more informative. We have also seen how the 4 symbols and the 8 trigrams can be derived by a simple splitting of Yin and Yang that develops like the branches of a tree or the veins of a leaf. Obviously this process can be continued till we reach the 64 hexagrams. Still another method of derivation is best understood through noting its similarity to modern algebra. We will take Yin and Yang together, and multiply that by itself as shown in figure 1-5a. we multiply this by another (Yin plus Yang), we will get a more complex term as shown in figure 1-5b. -t- .7= ~\" = + _+ _+_+_ or (b 2 +ba+ab+a 2 ) (b+a) = (b + a) 3 = b 3 + 3b 2 a + 3ba2 + a 3 = b 3 + b 2 a + b 2 a + b 2 a + ba2 + ba2 + ba2 + a 3 _ __+—+++=+ =+_+_ Figure 1-5b +} - - + + + + If a represent b represent - - from (b + a) 2 = b 2 + ba + ab + a 2 (--+_)2= + + + Figure 1-5a We can see how similar this is to multiplying (a + b) times (a + b). The only difference being that in algebra ab and ba are put together as a single term, 2ab, whether the a or b comes first. But in deriving the lines, ab and ba have different meanings and are kept separate. (Yin plus Yang) 2 gives us the four symbols we already know. If Note that the bottom line of a series of Yaos always is the first element, so that a Yin Yang translates to . _ . We can see how (Yin plus Yang) 3 results in the eight trigrams. Finally, if we take (Yin plus Yang) 6 we will arrive at the 64 hexagrams. If a = Yin and b = Yang, we can use this formula: (a + b) 6 = a 6 + 6a 5 b + 15a 4 b 2 + 20a 3 b 3 + 15a 2 b 4 + 6ab 5 + b 6 . or (Yin + Yang) 6 = Yin' + 6Yin 5 Yang + 15Yin 4 Yang 2 + 20Yin 3 Yang 3 + 15Yin 2 Yang 4 + 6 Yin Yang' + Yang ' This condensation gives us a picture of how many hexagrams have a particular proportion of Yin to Yang in the lines: 6 Yin, no Yang; 5 Yin, 1 Yang; 4 Yin, 2 Yang; and so on. If we think of the hexagrams as a thorough picture of the world, we can see that 20 parts of the 64 part map show a world where there is an even balance of 3 and 3, and 50 of the 64 parts are either even or close to it (20Yin 3 Yang 3 ,"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"4 2 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter One Raising The Veil Of Mystery 43 15Yin 4 Yang 2 , 1 5Yin 2 Yang 4 ). As we go further out to all Yin and all Yang, we see how rapidly these become _very small in proportion to the whole picture. We can liken this to a person's life and how it has its rare moments of great ecstasy or intense unhappiness. We all sense that we would not be whole without moments such as these. Most of the time, however, life is more balanced and our emotional experiences are moderate. Still, they have a complexity and richness that make them just as meaningful as the extreme high points and low points of life. Students of statistics will recognize in the distribution of the hexagrams a variation of the standard bell curve, which is used statistically to categorize all events. (See figure 1-5c and 1-5d.)

The diagram shows that the traditional methods of deriving the order of the 64 hexagrams are not the only ones, and that new and modern derivations can be evolved. A student of mathematical statistics might note the similarity of the diagram to the standard curves used in statistics to predict events, and find many new things from the study of the hexagram. Those of us who apply it to everyday life can easily find as many things. Suppose for example we take a Yin line as being a day when our intelligence and intuition is most dominant, and a Yang line as a day when our sense of action and effective action is most dominant. Then we can read each hexagram as the 6 days of a week. In this study, we'll find less than one week a year when our intelligence is totally dominant, and the same for our ability to act. Weeks when all but one day is dominant one way or the other will occur 6 times a year for each possibility. Finally we have the weeks where the two are evenly balanced or close to it; these will occur 78 percent of the time, or about 4 weeks in every 5. We are now at the core of the I Ching — its 64 hexagrams. Each hexagram contains six Yaos, and people always ask the question, \"A trigram has three Yaos, why don't they use four for the next step? Or for that matter, five? Or seven? Why six?\" This question was occasionally a controversial point even in ancient times. But it was largely a waste of energy; the equivalent of medieval Christian theologians arguing about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. To understand why six Yaos are used, ask yourself the following: Why does a foot have 12 inches? Why does a meter have 100 centi- meters? Why does an hour have 60 minutes? Why isn't our week nine days instead of seven?\" All we can say in reply is that experience shows that a foot is a very convenient way to solve most problems of measurement in daily life. True, if we need to measure the diameter of a hair or the distance between New York and Boston, we need a \"special\" division of measure- ment, but otherwise a foot will do fine. The same is true of the hexagrams using six Yaos.

It is not hard to imagine that we might make up a series of seven lined figures, and use them to study our weekly activities. We can see how different numbers of Yaos are useful by our studies of the moon — we can use Yin and Yang, or • and o, or - - and — to talk about the new and full periods. This is one Yao. Then if we begin to talk about the quarters, we need to use the four symbols, which are built with two Yaos. If we want still more detail, we can use the eight trigrams with three Yaos and the hexagrams with six Yaos as shown in figure 1-S e and 1-5f. Figure I-5 e Figure 1-5f Of course, this concept can apply to many things. If we take the circle in the center to be the sun and imagine the outer sphere to be the earth, then we are studying the seasons. We can study the career of an individual or a nation. And it is clear we can use even more than six lines if we want. For example, someone can make up a seven Yao symbol and use it to study the course of the week. So we repeat: six lines can show clearly what we need to know about most problems of daily life, but we can sometimes use fewer or more lines. Another important matter is the ordering of the 64 hexagrams. We saw how Fu Hsi and others arranged the 8 trigrams into a complete cycle and used this order in a logical way. How do we arrange the 64 hexagrams in a circle that makes sense? One way is the example of (Yin + Yang) 6 , which generates a mathematical sequence. In the Chou Dynasty, mathematics had not yet developed to this degree of sophistication in algebra. Instead, the Chinese used an ingenious visual method. First they arranged the eight trigrams in the Fu Hsi arrangement as shown in figure 1-5g. ( ) Figure 1-5g Note that in these diagrams, the \"bottom\" line is the one closest to the circle, which stands for the earth. To develop the 64 hexagrams from the eight trigrams, they expanded each trigram further out from the center and drew a circle around it. Now all they had to do was put another eight trigrams around each circle. To read a hexagram, we read first the inner trigram, and then the series of outer trigrams circling it. We have eight hexagrams. Then we go on to the next circled trigram in the diagram and get another eight, and so on, as shown in figure 1-5h.

The one shown here is derived using a circular order that follows the pattern of the eight trigrams we derived by branching Yin and Yang as shown in figure 1-5i. Figure 1-5i Tire ancient students of the I Ching also invented a grid pattern for developing the 64 hexagrams in an orderly manner. If we study the block below we will see that the inner (bottom) trigrams are always the same in each file going across, while the outer (upper) trigrams are the same in each vertical row as shown in Figure 1-5j.

Figure 1-5k The diagram looks as tightly packed with data as a railroad timetable. Since the hexagrams relate to any subject, they contain much informa- tion in them. Yet we can see how they begin with a simple notion of Wu Chi and Tai Chi, Yin and Yang, and expand to more complicated situation in a few steps. In a similar way, at times we may be in a mood to see that all human actions begin with the simple relationship of one person to another, and at other times marvel at the complexity and richness of our human social world, which seems unbounded. The order of Yao in a hexagram is read from bottom to top. The image of this is the earth below with things growing up out of it to the sky. The simple order of Yao from the bottom is first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and top Yao. For each of these Yaos in a hexagram there is a text or judgment giving the meaning of the Yao. We also use the odd number 9 to represent a Yang quality occupying a Yao and the even number 6 to represent a Yin quality occupying it. Top Yao I 1 Top -6 Fifth Yao 5th -9 Fourth Yao 1 4th -6 I 1 Third Yao 3rd -9 Second Yao 2nd -9 First Yao 1st -6 I I Figure 1-5e The first and second Yao are the beginning stages, or an omen of an event or phenomena. The fifth and top Yao indicate its conclusion and fulfillment. These are the beginning and end of the six Yaos. Also, the inner trigram represents the past and the outer one the future. Their combination represents our present. We must keep in mind that the notions of past, present, and future are among the most complex and mysterious perceptions we have. We do not perceive the past and future in everyday life and experience, but a kind of continuous present that is perceived without a beginning or end. And yet, without notions of past and future, we could not organize our lives and the world in which we live. Further, we can easily imagine how the past affects the future, but how can the future change the past? Consider two men who have separately been working towards some goal for three years to date. Next year the work will be completed, and one man will fail completely, and the other will succeed. Next year one man will say, \"That three years of work was a waste of time\" and the other will say, \"Those were the most productive three years of my life.\" Yet right now the three years do not have meaning for either of the two men. We look at them and see that they are both the same. In this case, the future will give the past its meaning. In the same way, we find ourselves making experiments in living and later saying \"that was stupid \" or \" that was smart. \" Yet, as we make these experiments in the present, we can only give them our best efforts without always knowing their meaning until some future time."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"T 5 2 The Tao Of I-Ching The positions of the Yao also represent the rank and social roles of people: The first Yao represents all people as a mass ( MIX ). The second Yao represents the scholar (± ). Today we might call them the technician, scientist, skilled worker. The third Yao represents the official ( )c ). Today we might say bureaucrat, politician, or administrator. The fourth Yao represents the high ranking officer ( $gyp ). Today we might say cabinet minister, or presidential advisor. The fifth Yao represents the King ( ). Today we might say president, prime minister, or leader. The sixth Yao represents the hermit of virtue and talent (%A ). Today we might say the person of talent who has cultivated and realized it to the most advanced degree. These positions were evolved before or during the Hsia Dynasty (2205-1766 B.C.). It is important to note that God is not part of this series of ranks; it is a human summary. It is also very important to note that the top rank of human value is not the king or the person in power. It goes to the person who uses talents to good effect in life and culture. This is because a person can become \" king \" by fortune or birth, even if lacking merit as a person. Thus, the person who combines fortune with an active will and out of this reaches useful achievements is the most worthy. Throughout recorded history, kings tried to make one of their children king. The role was usually defined by heredity. However, if we go back to the earliest times, when the ordering and regulating of human society was just beginning and was much more difficult, we find the \"king\" or \"leader\" was chosen according to merit. And even today, while fortune and social status at birth determine the lives of most people, we still have the \"self-made man \" or woman who achieves success through merit only. The six Yaos can also apply to the study of the human body: the Chapter One Raising The Veil Of Mystery 53 first Yao, the feet; the second Yao, the calves; the third Yao, the waist and thighs; the fourth Yao, the abdomen; the fifth Yao, the chest; and the top Yao, the neck and head. This is illustrated in figure 1-5m.

This is illustrated in figure 1-5n. 5th Yao and Yao 1st Yao We may wonder how this kind of study could possibly yield important knowledge of the human body or head. Without going into detail, we can say that the nature of our earth, with its gravity, must necessarily order the way the body is formed in a very complete way that extends to every detail of design and use. If this is so, then when we study this ordering, we will begin to find out fundamental things about the way the body and mind work.

Chapter Two: THE MIRACLE OF DIVINATION 0CC CCCC ■In 2-1 The Rationale for Divination aka. Now we come to the following questions. Why do we divinate? How does it work? Why do we use six lines? Why is the time im- portant? We can begin to understand the answers to questions like these by reviewing the Tai Chi diagram and seeing how simply it can describe our world. First we have Wu Chi, no change; hen we have the Tai Chi Stage, where there is a little change. Since now we have changed and unchanged, we have duality, the two forms called the Liung Yi. If we want to describe our world this way, we can draw a line as in figure 2-1 a. 0 + Figure 2-la We can see on the line that from a point of origin there are two directions. We can call these plus and minus. By using these two forms,"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"5 6 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 57 we can describe any place on the line in relation to its origin. We need one Yao to do this, and we can call our line one dimensional. Though we may rarely think of it this way, we frequently use one-dimensional thought. For example, in travelling from one town to another, we consider only one dimension. If we have a goal we are working towards, we picture a line from where we are to where the goal is and say things like \"today I took a step backwards!\" or \"I am nearly there!\". If we take two of these lines and place them at right angles to each other, however, we begin to create a diagram that is more recognizable to us as the flat plane or Descartes Coordinants as shown in figure 2-lb. + 1 Figure 2-lb If we examine this diagram closely, we can see how we now require two lines — call them length and width — to describe any place on the plane. With these two Yao, we can locate any point in relation to the origin at the center. Since each Yao can take a plus or minus, we have the four symbols we can see in the diagram. Even though we live in three dimensions, we often use two-dimensional maps to describe the surface of our earth, the floor plan of a house, and so on. But now we add a third line at right angles to the first two lines, and we have three dimensions or space coordinants, with a Yao for each, as shown in figure 2-1 c. z Figure 2-1 c We can see how this creates a division of all space into eight sections, and how the minus or plus of each X, Y, Z coordinante in each section will create a different trigram. If we use a sphere instead of a grid, we have another useful diagram: each segment is a triangle with three sides. We can analyze our spherical earth's surface with Yaos representing each side of the triangle as shown in figure 2-1 d. Figure 2-1d We experience our world partly as space. Though a child may never think \" it is all three dimensions\" the moment it is explained to him in school, he understands. Why? Because it is the simplest description. If we try to use less, we fall short of describing space thoroughly. If we + 0"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"5 8 The Tao Of 1-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 5 9 use more, then part of it is not needed and wastes our time. Then we may ask, why six lines? The answer is that there is another aspect to our world that physical dimensions do not describe. We call it \"time\" and we also link it with mental and spiritual qualities. (See chapter Two, The Tao of meditation, Way to Enlightenment by Jou, Tsung Hwa, 1983.) We might call this a fourth dimension. If we could be aware of all four dimensions then we would be in a godlike state, for the fourth dimension contains all past, present and future. But here we are stopper , for there is no place to add a fourth line to our diagram of space. Sc we use our imagination and observation. What do we know about time`:' What do we know about the spiritual dimension? The answers that come to us are paradoxes. Time is with us constantly and part of everything we do, yet we have no idea how to describe it. Furthermore, all our space lines go forwards or backwards, but we see time only goes one way — past, present, future. Even more, we only occupy a tiny point on the time line, the present. We find similar paradoxes when we try to look at the spiritual dimension. We are sure there are things, such as our soul, our spirit, our feelings, our will, that we cannot see, touch or hear in the physical world. Most of u4 can agree on the existence of phenomena. For example, the color yellow is yellow. However, in the spiritual dimension, we find agreements harder to reach, and perhaps only the poet or the mystic can say very much at all. All of this creates a sense of mystery in life. Perhaps we are a little like shadows who are used to living on a two dimensional surface that is part of a three dimensional world. A child with a ball on a string drops it among the shadows. Its appearance is a complete mystery. The child pulls the ball away with the string. Its disappearance is likewise totally incomprehensible. We live and breathe and take our nourishment from a four dimensional world, yet we have only three dimensions with which to talk about it. Even if we make a clock to show time, it is like a reflection of the fourth dimension in the three dimensional world — if we take the hands of the clock and turn them backwards, time does not go back! Yet, this does not close the issue. We all have links with this greater world in our everyday living. We have all had the kind of experience we first call \"coincidence\". Perhaps we are thinking of a friend, and just as the thought of him enters our mind, the phone rings and it's him. We ponder someone we know in our work lives. Everything seems fine with them, yet somehow we think \"something is happening\"; even though there is no visible sign. Suddenly, we have a \"brainstorm\"; we snap our fingers and say, \"I bet I know why she seems different. She's thinking of getting married.\" We look over the details and see nothing explicit. Yet we sense that there is a subtle change in her attitude and actions that shows this. We say \"It is as if everything a person does and is appears in their everyday behaviour.\" We feel no surprise when she introduces her fiance to friends at the office the following week. Or perhaps we have a spouse or an old friend we see frequently. Another old friend shows up and says \"how is he?\" And we find ourselves giving a detailled description of their explicit feelings and plans. Then we think, and realize, that he has never described any of these things fully to us in words. Yet, from a vague gesture, a tone of voice, a few words, we know everything. If we cultivate our awareness of these \"coincidences\", we find them happening more and more just as anything we give our attention to seems to increase. Finally, we stop using the word \"coincidence,\" and call it intuition. And we think: \"Well, I can't control it. It just happens.\" But then we think some more. We remember that when we became curious about it, it happened more often. So we do control it, indirectly, by nurturing it Perhaps then we remember our school biology class and how we learned that all living things evolve: first creatures with only a dim sense of energy and warmth, then something like a starfish that can sense light, then later a creature with eyes that focus and distinguish objects. Perhaps we think if life in general evolves, then it must be true that we have the opportunity to evolve as individuals. We begin with our five senses and now and then these \"coincidences\" occur. If we cultivate them, we begin to evolve more of them. We remember how bright and complete our sense impression of the world looked when we were children, and, if we are sensitive, it still looks bright and complete. Somehow, however, our appreciation of its complexity is more intense as we grow older. We begin to sense that our body and spirit are not static."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"6 0 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 61 Divination is one of the ways we cultivate ourselves in this way. It deals with a sense we may someday develop a sense that we may perceive directly, with control — provided that we are willing to endlessly and patiently follow the modest and humble methods of nurturing it in ourselves. Whereas our three Yaos of space are explicit and definite, we must add something to them that recognizes the other perceptions we have of things we do not know how to describe so finally: time and the world of spirit. By adding a place for these to the Yaos, we will be focusing our attention upon the whole of our world when we divinate. Why we are able to take yarrow sticks, coins, omens and time, and systematically derive a meaning from them, is a research area for a specialist. Now and then we read in a newspaper article how scientists discover that people have incredible powers under hypnotism, and so forth. This tells us that we truly do not know the true scope of our perceptions and actions. In the philosophy of the I Ching, we say that our living can be in harmony with all heaven and earth, and all our actions guided by them. When we add our special Yaos to our ones for space, another line will not suffice, This fourth dimension we speak of has qualities that are not completely like the dimensional Yao, and we sense this. So we look back to the Liung Yi with its two forms, and we take time as a second form, and add not one Yao, but a set of three to match the first three. Perhaps we may find other meanings to put into these three Yao if our understanding grows with time, but we begin quite simply by calling the first, past, the second, present, and the third, future. These represent our clearest simple understandings of time, and just as humanity is placed between heaven and earth, so our present comes between past and future, as shown in figure 2-le. 6 Future Outer 5 Present Time Trigram 4 Past Height 3 Inner Width Space 2 Trigram Length Figure 2-le We now have an empty \"diagram\" of six Yaos that describes our entire sense of our world. Sixty-four hexagrams can fit into this diagram, and only 64. One or the other will give us an exact and specific direction to look for understanding. Since this combination covers all events, we can examine situations in our life that are superficially unrelated, but are described by the same hexagram. Then we can do things like take a sure knowledge we have in one situation, and work at carrying it over into another with the assurance the knowledge will be equally workable there. By studying these 64, we are simultaneously studying our own lives in a thorough and systematic way. Since our whole life is involved as we study the I Ching, our knowledge will increase slowly in many areas rather than rapidly in a few. For example, when we ask for a hexagram in divination, we are studying discernment. To extend this discernment in everyday life is a large area of study. Yet we must have the complement of discern- ment, which is to be able to act effectively and successfully with the information we gain. This, too, is a large area, and we study this using the structure of the hexagrams as a guide. Sometimes we may study actively, by making the Hu Tien arrangement of trigrams to improve our understanding of the trigrams. At times we may guide ourselves through personal events of the greatest seriousness. At other times we may study with light-hearted zeal and imagine ourselves like the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes who could patiently ferret out the densest mysteries with only a few clues. If we have great ambitions in either a specific or general area, the I Ching can guide us in our development. We should never limit ourselves by the accomplishments of a figure of the past. For they made the beginnings of a value that has evolved as it has come down to us in time. It is left to us to take it and develop it further. Wherever we are in life, the I Ching can always show us that there is great opportunity open to us, and how to look for it. But to achieve real improvements in our life and enjoyment of it, we need to keep a basic approach firmly in mind — look for the answer by finding appropriate ways to correct our conduct or improve its quality. This carries over to the spirit of modesty in asking for guidance from heaven. It is a simple and easy approach that always works towards harmony. We may also consider this approach when we want to influence others —"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"6 2 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 63 instead of considering direct approaches or criticism, we ask ourselves how we may improve our conduct so the harmony of its example is hard to ignore. The effectiveness of this simple attitude and approach can only be understood when we actually try it for ourselves over a period of time and examine the results. Now we come to the actual rituals of divining with the I Ching. It should be remembered that a ritual is not a series of meaningless superstitions carried out without any sense of their meaning. It is a process that we can see in all human activity, even in something as informal as two people greeting each other. And it has the effect of focusing our attention on the importance and meaning of what we are doing. The traditional rituals of divination are recommended even to the modern student. Where it is not practicable to follow them completely, we can evolve our own modern translation of the spirit of them. By doing this, we reap the benefits of following tradition wherever possible, and we also recognize that change is part of the tradition of the Book of Changes. When we can, we set aside a room that is used exclusively for divination and study. If we do not do this, then perhaps we find a place that we can set up to use temporarily in this way. We store our physical tools of divination carefully, and bring them out when we divinate. We choose a time and situation where we will be undisturbed, away from noise and distraction. On the wall, we hang a picture of Fu Hsi, King Wen, the Duke of Chou, Confucius and the Great Yu (*A , An ancient Chinese King who dug canals prevent flood.) See figure 2-2a. We have a low, square table, large enough to accommodate our work. Behind this we have a smaller, long, narrow table for holding the incense burner and materials when not in use. We have a bundle of 50 yarrow stalks, 15 to 20 inches long. In storage, these are wrapped in light red silk. The wrapped stalks are then put in a black silk bag. Finally, this is put in a Tu ( ), which is a cylinder made of bamboo or hardwood. It is about three inches in diameter and has a cover that fits over the top. Figure 2-2a The Tu is placed at the back of the square table, and in front of it we place two Sen Kua (E ). Sen Kua is a curved bamboo shell, about the size and shape of the cupped palm of a hand. In front of the Sen Kua we place an ancient Chinese jug, made of China or brass, to hold a stalk when we divinate. In front of the jug, we place an incense burner. For recording our work, we use \"the four treasures of a study room\": a writing brush ( ), an inkslab ( ), an ink stick ( ), and writing papers. We have six Yao bars. A Yao bar is a wood plate a half inch thick and about one inch by ten inches. On one side we have carved in the bar, the sign of Yin (- -) in black. On the other side we have the sign of Yang ( ) in red. Before we begin our divination, we arrange these Yao on the table to form the hexagram Tai ( 1t. ), as shown in figure 2-2b. All of these items comprise the tools of divination. Our large table should be set up in front of a window facing South. We now come to 2-2 The Traditional Approach NW El"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"64 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 65 11 1 Hexagram Tai Figure 2-2b the preparations and rituals. Here, there is no substitution or simplifica- tion — second best is not good enough! — for we are concerned with developing our inner attitude and its proper expression. First, we purify ourselves in advance by observing rules of fasting and abstinence, and then by bathing. For example, we might rise in the morning, bathe, and then go to our divination without having any breakfast. We burn incense and light candles as an outward sign of our sincerity in consulting the I Ching. Now we consider our question. We divine to give ourselves a direction out of confusion. We consider our concerns quietly. If we find that we can see a clear way of acting and dealing with things, then we do not divine. We have already seen the answer in our inner selves directly. The purpose of divination is to cultivate this personal meditation and help it along only when it has foundered. If we decide on divination, then we kneel on the ground which has a seat cushion and pray. The Chinese prayer is given here. We can make up a prayer in our own language that follows it spirit. \"Heaven is silent and nature goes its hidden ways without words. Yet I believe this side of nature can be felt, and I believe that when I ask sincerely, heaven will communicate a reply to me. In this matter I am considering, I do not know what actions will bring good fortune or ill fortune. I do not see my way and I ask for guidance and clarity. \" If we go on to make a divination and find we do not like it and forget it or do something else, then there is no point in divining at all. We are only following random impulses. If the divination is hard to accept, this only means our imagination has become narrowly caught up in a corner. We can correct this by looking at things with new and positive attitudes and freeing ourselves thereby to use our imagination effectively to carry things out. After the prayer, we then throw the two Sen Kua upon the ground. If both come to rest face up or both face down, then it is not the right time. We then sit quietly and wait a while and throw again. Perhaps if they repeatedly say no, we conclude our ritual and come back another time. If one Sen Kua is up and the other down, then it is the time. We open the Tu and remove the yarrow stalks from the black bag and the red silk. We hold the 50 stalks in both hands and make a circle in the air above the incense. We then draw one of the 50 stalks and place it in the jug. This act symbolizes the change from Wu Chi to Tai Chi. The one stalk represents the state of Tai Chi, the source of Yin and Yang and all the changes that come from it. We do not move this stalk until our divinations are completed. We then divide the remaining 49 stalks into two bundles. We do this not by counting, but by simply holding some stalks in the right hand and some in the left hand. We then lay the left hand bundle to the left of the jug and the right hand burndle to the right of the jug. These two piles represent the two symbols, or the Liung Yi. as shown in figure 2-2c. Tai Chi Figure 2-2c Now draw one stalk from the right pile and place this between the little finger and the ring finger of the left hand. From the right pile we now take two stalks at a time till we have four piles of two stalks for a total of eight stalks. The two stalks represent the two forms, Yin and Yang. The four piles of two each represent the four symbols.

After we have separated the first eight in this way, we repeat the procedure again making four piles of two for our total of eight. We do this until we have a remainder of from \"zero\" to \"seven \" stalks; not enough to make four piles of two. To this remainder we add one (for the stalk in our hand) and the total gives us the number of our inner trigram (from one to eight). To find the trigram that corresponds to this number, we use the following cycle of trigrams: 1. Chien. 2. Tui. 3. =- Li. 4. Chen. 5• _ _ Sun. 6. _ Kan. 7. =Ken. 8. Ea Kun. trigram. For example, if our remainder is six, we add this to the one in our hand and our number is \"7\". We consult the cycle of trigrams and determine that our outer trigram is Ken ( . ). We then arrange the three top Yaos accordingly as shown in figure 2-2e. r 1 • I Figure 2-2e For example, if we have a remainder of 2 stalks and add the one stalk in our left hand, our number is \"3\". By consulting the cycle of trigrams we determine that our inner trigram is Li ( _ ). We then arrange the, three bottom Yao bars accordingly from the hexagram Tai on the table as shown in figure 2-2d. 1 1 We now have our hexagram. Pick up the 49 stalks a third time. Again we separate them and make two piles, one to the left and the other to the right of the jug. This time, choosing from the right pile, we count by twos again, but only arranging groups of six (three piles in each group). We make as many groups of six as possible, until we have a remainder of \"zero\" to \"five\". That number plus the one stick in our hand gives us the \" moving Yao \" or Pien Yao ( j C ). The Pien Yao tells us which Yao will change to its opposite. When the change is made, a new hexagram is formed, and this is called the Shih hexagram ( ) of the original. For example, if our remainder is \"four\" and we add the one in our hand, our Pien Yao is \"5\". Therefore, we change the fifth Yao in our hexagram as shown in figure 2-2f. WEI =IE Figure 2-2d 6 Once we have our inner trigram, we pick up all 49 sticks and repeat the process. This time, however, we choose our sticks from the left-hand pile.

We have asked and nature has answered. We may then use our writing materials to record the reading for our study. In studying the reading and considering its relation to us, we use the same quiet and serious approach we followed throughout the divination. During the early Han Dynasty period of 206 B.C. to 24 A.D., Ching Wong (-t ) brought into use another method of divination using three Chinese coins; as shown in figure 2-2g. Figure 2-2g In this method we use three Chinese coins or select other coins. Perhaps we use new coins or take our coins and clean and polish them to prepare them for their new use. The dins are placed in a cylindrical container with a tightly fitting cover. Its size is three to four inches in diameter and four to six inches high. Again we follow the same ritual but instead of picking up the Tu, we pick up the container of coins. To read, we shake the container and pour out the coins. We interpret the coins as follows: Two tails are called Che ( #)F ), write down \" • \", meaning Yang Two heads are called Tau ( . ), write \" v \", meaning Yin Three heads are called Chiao ( ), write \" x \", meaning old Yin moving to Yang Three tails are called Chung ( ), write \"0\", meaning old Yang moving to Yin The first throw determines the first Yao, and so on. For example: After three throws, we have . our inner trigram, and we stop and repeat our prayer. Then we complete the outer trigram and study. We can see that this method can sometimes give us only one hexagram to study with no Pien Yao, and sometimes it can give us two hexagrams with up to all six Yaos changing. Generally, we receive a result that is much more complex and requires more careful thought and study than the reading from the stalks. The most highly advanced students of the I Ching would extend this classical divination by using added indicators of divination called the Ten Celestial Stems ( - ), the Twelve Earth Branches ( ), and the Five Elements (3~. Tr ). These involve the use of calendars, months and days of the year, and still other factors. Knowledge of these methods is relatively rare, even among the Chinese people. It is comparable to high level calculus contrasted with simple arithmetic. Since we can answer our questions a simpler way, we do not use a more complicated one. These advanced forms,however, do show us how the derivation of a reading from the Tai Chi sphere can be carried to any degree of complexity. Now we come to how we judge the meaning of our divination in relation to the question we asked. For this, we begin with the Kwa Tsi of King Wen and the Yao Tsi of the Duke of Chou. These works are like sketches or outlines of a drama, rather than a detailed explanation. This kind of sketchy outline is actually very common in our lives. However, we may forget that we have been learning all our lives to read these \"sketches\". For example, turn on the TV and we hear the newscaster summarize: \"Youth rescues drowning swimmer. \" Immediately we know a lot about the story. We come to the office and see the boss ' s wife glaring at the pretty new secretary. No one needs to tell us what is happening. We l ook across the street and see two men facing each other with rigid postures, one with his fist raised, and we know what we are seeing. Every day we pass through many situations where a glance at things tells us \"something is happening \" and 2 . 3 The Master-key to Sound Judgment 1E1 1st Yao is Che or N . where we read enough of the meaning to satisfy our needs — or 0 2nd Yao is Tau or 3rd Yao is Chung or , \\ Q perhaps we don ' t read the situation correctly and trouble as a result. find we get into"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"70 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 71 In fact, when we look at our troubles, we may often find that they come from our not being alert and reading the signs carefully. Divination with the I Ching teaches us to do this in a thorough and systematic way. Since it speaks of the future, it also teaches us to use our imagination to prepare ourselves effectively. To illustrate this, let us look at the process of divination. We will call the hexagram we divine the Pen Kua ( * 11- ), which means \"original hexagram. \" We will use the first hexagram, Chien, as an example: From our Kwa Tsi we know that Chien is creativity or heaven. Its image is six dragons that govern the heavens. Its symbol is the all- inclusive. Then we go to the Yao Tsi and observe the reading for the changing Yao. If the first line is the changing Yao, we read \"The dragon is lying under the water.\" We know the dragon is active in the sky, and it is easy to interpret \"here at the beginning, the time is not good for any activity. \" So we will wait alertly, like the cat watching for a mouse, until we see signs that things are opening up for us. If the second Yao were changing instead of the first, we would read \"The dragon is in the field. The time is good to have a meeting with an influential person.\" Then we know that the whole situation is good and it is time to become active. Our interpretations must stay close to what is suggested, yet also apply to our situation. If we are looking for a job, it is easy to see with the second Yao that it is time to go out for job interviews. But suppose we have a personal creative project where we work totally alone. Who is the influential person? Here, that \" person \" is our own sense of inner creativity -- a quality that we have excellent acess to at some times, and at other times do not. This is just like an influential person who may or may not be receptive to what we want. We can see from these two Yaos how a slight change creates a totally different situation for us. Once we have our hexagram and changing Yao, our stage is set for the drama to unfold. Every situation has a beginning, a middle where everything is active, and finally a conclusion. To find the active middle, we create a new hexagram called the Hu Kua ( ). We literally take our old hexagram apart, using the lines two, three and four for our lower trigram, and the lines three, four and five for our upper trigram as shown in picture 2-3a. 5 Figure 2-3a Since the Hu Kua is made by taking the four inner lines of the Pen Kua and expanding them, there can only be sixteen different Hu Kua which is the total number of combinations possible using those four lines. The Hu Kua is important if we consider that the third and fourth lines of the Pen Kua are for humanity, and they are expanded to form four of the six lines of the Hu Kua. The Yin-Yang of the second and third Yaos of the Hu Kua is the same as the Yin-Yang of the fourth and fifth Yaos, since both correspond to lines three and four of the Pen Kua or original hexagram. With the Hu Kua that we derive from Chien, we have an unusual situation — the Hu Kua is the same as the Pen Kua. This is very good in general, but very poor for asking about health conditions. The Hu Kua may suggest an \"inner situation \" that is much different from the clearly described beginning. This is like when one sees a clearly defined situation, decides to get involved with it, and the moment one 6 5 4 -5 3 -4 2 -3 1 -2 4 3 4 3 2"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"72 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 73 becomes involved, everything shifts around and is changed. This is because one has entered the situation and added something new to it. Here in the middle we follow the suggestions of the Hu Kua. But we must also keep in mind that it is a transitional stage. For example it may be a poor hexagram — yet the rest of the divination tells us the overall reading is good. Then we know we should be patient and not \"throw away our chance.\" Perhaps we begin our day and feel our opening plans collapse, and we think the day will accomplish little, but we work along, and then in the evening we look back and realize that somehow things \"cleared up\" and we did quite well because we persevered. We can also understand the opposite situation, where all seems to be going well in the middle, then we find at the end all sorts of reverses. This is like a Hu Kua that is good while the final part of the divination is poor. Since we know this, we do not lose even more by being shocked and taken aback when the fortunes change. Instead, we \"make hay while the sun shines\" and use the middle to cultivate ourselves in a long range way that will not be limited by the poor outcome. And when the fortunes do become poor, we relax our positive efforts quickly, and adapt ourselves to the wisest way of handling the difficulties. In this way we may do better with a poor fortune than someone with a much better fortune who wastes most of it through carelessness or intemperate feelings. We find our final stage of the divination by using the moving Yao to generate a new hexagram, which we call the Shih Kua (, F ). We arrange all three hexagrams in order, as shown in figure 2-3b. L - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - J Figure 2-3b With these three hexagrams we have a complete reading, and we can interpret it by referring to the judgments for each hexagram and for the moving Yao. But there are other methods of Taoist thought we can add to the divination to give greater understanding and detail. To begin with, we can study a unique principle of interrelationship called the Five Elements. The Five Elements diagrammed below were described by the Chinese Naturalist School over 2,000 years ago. They were called the Wu Hsing ( Et ) and were not looked on in their passive roles, but rather in the dynamic processes that each one involved. Thus water is observed as having properties of soaking and descending. Fire heats and moves upward. Wood shapes physical masses in curved and straight forms. Metal can be put in molds as a liquid and then hardens. Earth nurtures the sowing and reaping of plant life, and provides a ground for all. The Five Elements may be used to classify active phenomena just as we use the eight trigrams to classify all things in our divination. They have also been used to symbolize the active energies in a complex, interrelated system. For example, in Chinese medicine, the five element model describes the interrelations of different organs and parts of the body, showing how a weakness or excess in one organ can cause illness and disruption in an entirely different place. The use of the Five Elements to describe something as complex as a living person should remind us always that the diagrams represent an organized but constantly fluctuating system. We can begin to gain a modest understanding of such a system by studying the four major principles involved as shown in figure 2-3c. These four processes are summarized by the arrows in the diagram. In the principle of Mutual Creation ( ), one element serves to nurture and sustain the adjoining element in the clockwise circle. We can see how wood nurtures fire, and fire creates new earth with ashes; how earth is the source of metals, and how metal brings dew in the form of condensed droplets of water — these simple examples can help as memorize the relations of Mutual Creation, which we call Sheng ( . ). To complement Mutual Creation, we have the principle of Mutual Closeness (;Mf] ). Here we are saying that an elements becomes close to the one that sustains it in much the same way as a child becomes close to its mother. Pen Kua 1 r 1 moving Yao Hu Kua Shih Kua"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"7 4 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 75 CLOSENESS DESTRUCTION FEARFULNESS Figure 2-3c The principle of Mutual Destruction or Ke ( ) describes how one element limits, controls, or completely destroys the process of another. For this we can imagine how water destroys fire, how wood grows and its roots split apart earth, how fire by its heat melts metal, how earth in dams halts water from flowing, and how metal axes cut wood. The complement to Mutual Destruction is the principle of Mutual Fearfulness ( ) or respect. When we study real life examples, we must imagine a variety of possible meanings for Ke or destruction and for Sheng or creation and choose an appropriate one. By considering practical examples and using our imagination, we can slowly develop an understanding. Ke, for example, can be complete destruction. It can also be milder and represent one person who blocks another but does not destroy them. It can be milder still and represent a person who can inhibit another ' s behaviour, yet in a good way like the mother who applies Ke to her child to prevent him from wandering into the public road where he will meet a much worse Ke. Her motivation is Sheng, love and protectiveness. Yet this actual act is not Sheng. If you think it is, just look at the child, who is crying and angry at being baulked. He is showing the principle of Fearfulness. Suppose in divination you find that a specific person has the power of Ke over you in part of the situation. What kind of Ke is this? You will not find the answer in the divination, because you already have it in yourself. You know what the person is like, and what they are likely to do when they have power over you, from actual experience. To apply the Five Elements in this way to our divination we add another principle of relationships, that we call Ti and Yung. To understand what Ti and Yung are, we need only consider a few examples. In general, the bottom, inner trigram, is identified as having the quality Ti ( ) and the upper, outer trigram, that of Yung ( ). We can begin to have an understanding of these terms by considering a few examples. Consider a framework of steel with a motor, wheels, steering device, and other controls — an auto chassis. This is Ti. We can put various bodies on this chassis; one body and it becomes an armored tank, another body and it is an ambulance, another and it is a racy sports car, another and it is a sedate family station wagon. This is the Yung of the auto chassis. By comparing these two qualities, we notice that the Ti part is always relatively simple, and that the Yung can be multiple and complex. Another example: Ti is what we have at birth or natural, Yung is what we have now or man-made. This Yung came from the culture we live in and also from our free actions and the habits we built out of them. We all begin with about the same simple Ti; we all have a very different Yung. (See the Tao of Meditation by Jou, Tsung Hwa, 1983) Ti obviously makes Yung possible, but Yung affects Ti, as well. If the auto chassis must hold a tank, we strengthen the frame; if it must hold a sports car, we use light aircraft metals. One way to look at this is to see Ti as the leading role in a.drama, and Yung as all the supporting roles. Without a Ti, the Yung loses most of its meaning and focus. Yet the actions of the Yung determine what directions the Ti goes in as it leads the drama and the development of the plot. Ti and Yung used in another way become very important in divina- tion, because they may or may not harmonize, as we can see in the following examples: Ti . Yung_ Relationship Water Fish Good Water Fire Conflict Water Drinking Glass Appropriate Water Sewage Line Complements Water Water CREATION"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"7 6 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 77 We may say in a literal way, \" But the water goes in the glass, so why isn't the glass Ti?\" This is true. But when we consider the situation more thoroughly, we see that water came first, and the glass is part of the Yung that surrounds the water. If we want to study glasses, we can make the glass Ti, and have water, wine, and other substances as its Yung. When we apply Ti and Yung to our six trigram divination, in organizes all the forces into two parts. To do this, we select one of the trigrams of the first Pen Kua or the original hexagram, to be Ti. When there are no moving Yao, the inner trigram is always Ti. When there are an equal number of moving Yao in each trigram, the inner trigram is again Ti shown in figure 2-3d. consider something outside our personal concern. Once we have our Ti Kua, we label all the other trigrams as Yung Kua as in figure 2-3f. Pen Kua C Ti l I 1 I 1 1 X-- - 1 Yung Hu Kua Yung Yung Shih Kua I I Yung 1 Yung ~- s [ L - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - J Figure 2-3f =El No moving Yao Yung x Yung Figure 2-3d When one of the trigrams has more moving Yao than the other trigram, we select the quietest trigram as shown in figure 2-3e. X Yung Figure 2-3e The Ti Kua is the leading force in our divination. It is us, if we are concerned in the divination, or is the major group or person if we Look at the diagram. The Ti of Li is repeated in the Shih Kua outer trigram of Li. This will always happen, in a one moving Yao divination. Look again. We see the four other Yung Li, Kan, Chen, and Li -- are not all different. We use this comparison for a sign of relative strength of the Ti and Yung forces. Ti has two friends in the Yung of Li. The Yung of Tui has no similar friend. We think of it as having lesser force that the repetition of a trigram builds up an energy. If the 5 Yung trigrams were 2 or more of them Tui, we would say the Yung is more forceful than the Ti. This comparison is useful, but we are going to take it much further by adding the Five Elements. To do this we take the eight trigrams and assign each one to one of the elements as shown in figure 2-3g. Now we have the eight trigrams dynamically interrelated. First of all there are the ones that are paired with the same element — Kun and Ken. Sun and Chen, Chien and Tui. We think of these as like twins. Each has its own personality, hut they go together. We can see another example with its Ti and Yung and ask the question: Does the Ti have any `friends ' like this? Now about the Yung? Here is the answer. you will note we label each trigram by its Five Element position as shown in figure 2-3h. F - 1 X Ti Ti [ I I Ti x 3 Ti [ 1 C] 1 )( Yung x 1 X Moving Yao"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"78 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 79 We immediately see that Ti does have friends, and that metal forms a group of three elements. Yung does not combine because there are no common elements. So the Ti is stronger than the Yung. But we have still another principle coming from our Five Elements Relationships — the Metal Ti destroys the Wood Yung! This is the relationship of Mutual Destruction, or Ke. We will indicate it by drawing a line - When we want to indiate the relationship of Mutual Creation or Sheng, we will draw the line - In interpreting these relationships, we consider the following: if the Ti Ke or destroy the Yung, this is good. If the Yung Ke the Ti, this is poor. This simply means that if the Ti finds some influence detracts from its goal, it can remove or neutralize it. If the TV set in the next room is distracting you from your studies, you can shut the door. You Ke the TV set. But if you have no control, if someone can come into the room where you are studying, and turn on a TV set, this is poor. In terms of Sheng or creation, if the Yung Sheng the Ti, this is good. If the Ti Sheng the Yung, this is poor. Thus if you have helpers available to assist you in your projects, this is certainly good. Suppose instead that, you have obligations to help various other people, and they can call on you and distract you from working on your goals. Now we may go hack to the above example once more, and this time we can see these Ke and Sheng lines added in figure 2-3i.

Pen Kua, Hu Kua, Shih Kua, all have"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"8 0 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 81 something going on in relation to the Ti. Not all divinations invoke this special relationship in the Pen Kua, and we can find by simple inspection of the question divinated whether it applies. Let us assume it applies in the case above, and summarize what our different methods tell us: 1. The Ti is much stronger than the Yung. 2. Pen Kua. Good. The Ti Ke the Yung. 3. Hu Kua, Poor, but not a guaranteed disaster. The Yung Ke the Ti, but the Ti is much stronger, so it has a chance to survive. 4. Shih Kua. Good. The Yung of earth supports the Ti of metal. All's well that ends well. Now we can see how to relate the Ti Kua to the different Yung Kua. If the Ti Kua is fire and the Yung Kua is wood, then the Yung Kua creates or sustains the Ti Kua. This is like a person who wants to organize a project, and who finds others ready to support and carry out its purposes. In this situation, the Ti Kua feels a closeness or affection towards Yung Kua. If the Yung Kua is fire, however, and the Ti Kua is wood, this shows things going the wrong way. It is like giving a knife to an evil man, or like an employer delegating power to an assistant who uses it to benefit himself while he lets the business go to ruin. We note here that the Yung Kua is attracted to the Ti Kua. However, it is like a fox attracted to a farmer ' s chickens. If the Ti Kua is fire and the Yung Kua is metal, the Ti Kua controls the Yung Kua. The Yung Kua is like an employee working cooperatively because he knows he can be demoted. Or the Yung Kua can be like a student who is so impressed by the force and energy of his teacher that he respects him highly and pays attention to his teaching. If these roles are reversed, then the Ti Kua becomes like a man who sets out to ride a horse, and the horse throws him to the ground. We have the influences going in the wrong direction, and whatever the Ti Kua is seeking to accomplish the Yung Kua is weakening and working against. Since in specific cases a varied set of elements and trigrams are involved, we can apply a great deal of specific detail. In addition, we may have a combination of good and poor factors. Since they come at different times, we can study how to change with the times. In each case we apply the knowledge to our specific case. If we plan to start a business and the divination says \"very poor at the start, good later on\" and we have almost no reserve to start ou: with, this means we may fail completely at the start and never get to the point of \" later on. \" If divination shows a poor situation, the details show us exactly what to look out for. If divination shows a very strong situation, we know that success will come to us if we are reasonable. Our success, however, can be spoiled if our conduct is poor. A person given authority over others may be carelessly rude and unfair to them and create a new situation that turns against him. Likewise, if we are offered a strong situation but are too timid to exercise our influence, we will lose it just as surely as if we were overbearing. But if these things are so, we may ask: \"What good is it to have a favorable divination if we feel unequal to carry it out? \" We must reflect that if we have weaknesses we also have a potential to correct them. A good divination indicates a time when we may begin to work on these corrections and make something real of them. If we do this over and over again, we will change, and evolve to something better. We can go hack to our Chien reading to see as another example as shown in figure 2-3j. Ti -- Metal Yung Metal I J I-- Figure 2-3j To begin with, the Ti of metal has four other Yungs like it, giving it great strength. In the last trigram. metal controls wood. Thus our overall divination is a favourable one. Here is another example as in figure 2-3k. We see here the end result is that our Ti of metal is controlled by a Yung of fire. But the Ti has four identical Chiens, making it powerful.

It is like being in a group of people where almost everyone approves of you except for one very powerful individual who opposes you. Using this form of divination with imagination can keep us learning new things about how to approach our living for a long time. But with this form, we are working with the final results of work derived by the developers of the I Ching. At some time we will be prepared to undertake a study of how the meanings of the hexagrams and the moving Yao were derived. This is a complex and arduous study, yet its rules are simple and we should know them. In divination, we use the principle position of a Yao, or \" Cheng Wei\" ( iE . ). To determine the principle position, we first designate the odd numbers as Yang and the even numbers as Yin. Thus, the 1, 3, or 5 Yaos prefer Yang, and when these are occupied by a Yang line, this is a principle position and means good fortune. When the 1, 3, or 5 Yao is not occupied by a Yang line, it suggests poor fortune. It is the same with the Yin Yaos, the second, fourth, and sixth Yaos. If one of these Yaos is occupied by a Yin line, it is a principle position. We can see this in figure 2-31: 6. Yin Yao Yang Poor - Top 5. Yang Yao Yang Good 5th 4. Yin Yao — Yin Good 4th 3. Yang Yao ~. — Yang Good 3rd 2. Yin yao ~. ~ Yang Poor 2nd I . Yang Yao ~. ~. Yin Poor 1st Figure 2-3 L If we look at the above list at the left of the Yaos we find that the first line in the inner trigram is Yang (I) and the first line in the outer is Yin (4), and that this contrast continues with the second line, Yin and Yang (2 and 5), and the third line, Yang and Yin (3 and 6). These contrasts are like electricity, and when they match in an actual hexagram thier mutual attraction indicates good energy. The matching is called Hsiang Yin ( 41 ). In the example A below as shown in figure 2-3m the second Yao is a Yin Yao and the fifth Yao is a Yang Yao. Both are in principle position and match. This is Hsiang Yin. In example B, the Hsiang Yin occurs with the third Yao (Yang) matching the sixth Yao (Yin). Both of these Yaos are in the principle position. A B — No w No Figure 2-3m The Middle Position. The second and fifth Yaos occupy the middle positions of the two trigrams. If the line filling them is the principle one and if they match, this indicates very good fortune. Matching and nonmatching examples are given in figure 2-3n. Figure 2-3n Ti — Metal J I l Yung — Metal r f Yung — Metal f f 1 U • Q ! J i Yung — Fire Yung — Metal Yung – Metal Match — [ l No {r 1 i • I r \ti I I Match J-- -;r I I I No • Poor • Good l r • Good • Good J t"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"8 4 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 85 If we think of the three powers (earth, humanity, and heaven) we see immediately why this is so. The second and fifth lines are the lines of humanity for the two trigrams, so they are the most important ones for us. Confucius' major work in philosophy was to develop what we call a `philosophy of the mean', meaning the middle, the place midway between the two extremes of heaven and earth. As you can see, the I Ching is not a formula that gives simple solutions. We must relate what the trigrams tell us to our own situation. For example, if a trigram has a Yang line in the second Yao and a Yin line in the fifth Yao, we would have a situation where neither Yao is in the principle position, but the two Yaos match together. We must think about how this relates to us. We must decide what is good or bad for us. The situation could be compared to the dilemma of a person who has the opportunity to pursue two occupations. He could be a musician because he enjoys music very much. This is good. He could also work for a large company and make a lot of money. This is also good. The person must decide what is best for himself or herself. Likewise, when consulting the I Ching, we must interpret what it tells us. We can understand better why these kinds of comparisons are made by referring to the Treatise of Remarks on the Trigrams, or Shuo Kua ( I ): When the ancient sages designed the I, its figures conformed with the principles underlying the nature of men and things, and the ordinances appointed for them by Heaven. They exhibited the way of Heaven, calling the lines Yin and Yang; the way of earth, the weak (soft) and strong (hard); and the way of men. benevolence and righteousness. Each trigram embraced those three powers, and, being repeated, the full form consisted of six lines. A distinction was made between the Yin and Yang lines, which were variously occupied by the strong and weak forms. Thus the figure of each hexagram was completed. The six Yaos indicate the six stages necessary for the development of phenomenon. According to the traditional commentaries on the I Ching, The Yao speaks of the changes. The lines of Yao correspond to the movements taking place on earth. In the trigrants, these lines are in high and low postions, and we designate them from their component elements, Yang or Yin. The lines are mixed together and elegant forms arise. When such forms are not in their appropriate places, the ideas of good and bad fortune are produced. We can see by now why the moving Yao is so important. It changes the principle position and the matching lines. We might have a situation that was difficult, but the earth lines of the two trigrams matched, and now the moving Yao destroys the difficult situation. Or perhaps instead of a complex divination we have taken one hexagram, with one trigram to represent us and the other some person we are concerned with. As we study the two trigrams, we may get a picture of the relationship and its conflicts and strong points. Then we add a moving Yao , and see immediately how a change in our circumstances or the other person's circumstances, creates an entirely new situation that may be better or poorer. This might be like the couple where the husband gets a new job that involves travelling a lot, and the marriage begins to disintegrate. Or it could be like a couple that is always quarreling and ready to break up, and then they move to a new apartment, and now they are happy and in accord again. A simple divination requires a much deeper understanding and intui- tion, and this may suit some of us better than the three part divination. All of us should study it, for at times it will be easier, at times the other more appropriate. And at times, we may find no clear indication we can understand in a three part divination, and then analyze the lines, and see exactly the understanding we are looking for. The more detail we know about possible paths of divination, the more freedom we have to select a method that fits our subject. Personal emotions, many kinds of business activity, and countless other things in our lives are affected by the seasons, and we can include this factor in our divination. To do this, we only need to refer to the material on the eight trigrams and see how the Hu Tien cycle is applied to the seasons the period from March to June, for example is ruled first by Chen and then by Sun, so these are the trigrams for spring. We can use this to evaluate our Ti Kua and Yung Kua as strong or poor. Spring is wood. Wood Ke or destroys earth, which is Ken in the winter, and Kun in the early fall. One is already in the past, the other too far in the future to be relevant. If our Ti is wood, and the dominant"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"8 6 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 87 Yung is earth, we see that the meaning of these two trigrams either adds to or detracts from the basic divination. Wood Sheng or creates Li, however, which is fire. This is the month of June, just following. If our Ti is Li, we know this means good things are coming. We can also test and improve our divination skill by asking the weather, and taking the Ti to indicate it. For example, if the Ti is: Chen or = — indicates possible thunder, sudden change; Sun or indicates wind; Kan or — indicates rain, wet weather; and Li or — indicates sunny weather, etc. If we consult the I Ching about the weather and get a 44th hexagram Gou or meeting, Ti Kau is , or thunder metal Ti Ke wood Because Chien, or metal Ke or destroy the Chen or wood, we suspect there will be no thunder. During the Sung Dynasty ( 960-1279) there lived a government official named Shao, Kang Chieh (Mf g i 1011-1077) who began to study the 1 Ching. So interested did he become in this subject, that he resented his bureaucratic duties because they prevented him from spending all of his time studying the I Ching. Determined not to be frustrated, Shao finally succeded in obtaining an early retirement from his career on the grounds of poor health, even though his health was excellent. He could now devote all of his time to his studies. His study of the I Ching became so intense that he did not pay attention to his household responsibilities. When the weather turned cold, he did not even gather firewood to warm his home. As far as Shao was concerned, his normal duties took too much time. He devoted all his time to his continuing study of the I Ching. He copied all the hexagrams on large cards and placed them on the walls of his home so that they were available for inspection at all times. He made placards with the words to the judgments of each hexagram and placed them on the walls next to the hexagrams. But no matter how hard and passionately Shao worked to master the wisdom of life through the I Ching, he made very little progress in understanding or achievement. One day, after working to the point of exhaustion, Shao lay down for a mid-day nap. He was awakened by an unsual sound and saw a large moth fluttering around the cards he had placed on the walls. Angrily, he hurled his pillow at the moth. However, people at that time used to sleep on pillows made of china because they were cool in hot weather. Shao had forgotten this, and his pillow crashed against the wall. Shao looked at the broken pieces and, to his surprise, found a slip of paper with writing on it that had evidently been hidden inside the pillow. He read the writing on the slip: \"In the year 1050 on April 10 in the afternoon this pillow will be destroyed by its being thrown at a moth. \" Shao looked at the time. It was the exact date and time written on the slip of paper which had been hidden in the pillow for years. He became very excited and thought to himself, maybe everything has a date! A man is born on a certain date and dies on a certain date, and this is the cycle of his life. A person begins a job on a certain date and retires on a certain date, and this is the cycle of his career. A building is constructed at a certain time in history and at some time in the future is destroyed. It too has a cycle of existence. And even this pillow had a life cycle. It was made on a certain date and just now, on this date, it was destroyed. Shao quickly realized that this life cycle formula could be applied to every aspect of reality. Every person and thing had a definite date of beginning and a definite date of ending. And, Shao reasoned, if he could learn a method to discover this formula, he could predict the life cycle of anything in the world, as well as all the events of any person's life. The whole experience seemed like a dream to Shao, but the paper The Plum Flower Mind 2-4 I Ching MI MI 1•11I 111•"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"8 8 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 89 and its message was real. He decided to visit the store where the pillow was purchased, and brought the broken pieces with him. The storekeeper sent him to the wholesaler of pillows, who sent him to the china maker who made the pillow. At first, the china maker was of no help. He explained that none of his workers could have put the note inside the pillow because none of them could write. At that time in China, only the higher classes were literate. Then the china maker recalled, \"There was an old man who was retired and used to come and watch us work. He is very educated and even knows the I Ching. Everyone knows of him. Maybe he put the paper in the pillow. \" Feeling he was close to solving the mystery, Shao hurried to the old man's home. He knocked on the door and was greeted by a young man. When Shao gave the name of the old man, the young man replied, \"That's my grandfather. He died several years ago.\" Shao's hopes were dashed to pieces. However, the young man continued to speak and Shao's hopes were revived. \"Before my grandfather died, he gave me a book and told me that on a certain day, month, and year, at a certain time, a person will come to visit, and I should give him that book. It is now that exact time. I am astonished. Wait, and I will get the book for you.\" Before his death, the old man had spent many years researching and studying the I Ching. The results of his long study were written in the book. He wanted to pass along this information to someone who was prepared to receive it, and who was devoted to further study. Shao was that person. Shao took his treasure home and resumed his studies, day and night. He had found the master-key to understanding, and gradually his spiritual enlightenment grew and became complete. The book contained a method for divination that was more accurate than the traditional yarrow stalks. The new method translated the year, month, day, and time of an event into numbers and then used the numbers to indicate the hexagrams. This new method gave Shao new insight into the concepts of space and time. The results Shao received using this method were perfectly accurate. In his first judgment, he received the message: there is some gold hidden in the old man's house. Shao went there, and with the grandson, dug out the ground beneath the old man's bed. There they found the gold. The book Shao received from the young man is called MEI HUA SIN I or The PLUM FLOWER MIND I CHING (&fiE,b ). It is the source of my book. In studying and using these new methods of divina- tion, we will not just read the written words of the judgments and i mages. We will study the figures of the trigrams and learn to understand then more directly. The old man left two methods of divination to Shao, Kang Chieh. He used both methods to reach a mastery of the I Ching. One of the methods is called Hsien Tien (5c ), and the other Hu Tien ( &* ), after the two arrangements of the trigrams in cycles. Tien means Heaven, and the word Hsien refers to our heritage from the past as it affects our present and future. Our genetic make-up and the health and habits of our mother as she carried us before birth, are Hsien Tien. Divination by the Hsien Tien method is very simple. We get the outer trigram by adding together the year, month, and day of the month, then dividing this number by eight. The remainder will be from one to seven, and if we have no remainder, we count this as eight. We then use the Hsien Tien numeration of the cycle to assign a trigram: 1 — Chien; 2 Tui; 3 — Li; 4 — Chen; 5 — Sun; 6 -- Kan; 7 — Ken; 8 — Kun. To find the inner trigrarn, we add the number of the year, month, day, and the hour. Again we divide by 8 and take the remainder to select the trigram.. We number the hours of the day from one to twenty- four for the number of the hour. Thus 10 a.m. is ten; 3 p.m. is 15; and so on. If our clock shows an hour between two hours, such as 10:30, we say this time \" covers \" the 10 o ' clock and count it as 10. To find the moving Yao, we again use the year, month, day and hour, and this time divide by six. We get a remainder from one to five, or use six if there is no remainder. But we must assign a number to our year before we can do this. In the traditional Chinese calendar, the years were ordered and named by combining two cycles of time periods called the Ten Celestial Stems or Tien Kan ( . ql ), and the Twelve Terrestrial Branches or Ti Chih ( ). A complex method of derivation was used that is nowadays relatively unknown even to the Chinese. We can think of it in this way: the list of stems was placed with the list of branches to get a set of combinations. Doing this left a remainder of the last two branches, and these were used to start another cycle in the list. When the listing was"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"9 0 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 91 completed, the combinations numbered 60, and the years were named according to which combination they represented. In using the spirit of this method in our present-day divinations, we will divide the Western numeration of the year by the number 12. Thus 1,982 divided by twelve gives 165 with a remainder of two. We give 1982 the number 2. We derive any years similarly. We always get a remainder of from I to 11, and if there is no remainder we call this 12. For our month, we count it as the number it follows in the cycle of the year. For example, October is 10. And for our day, we simply take th., number of the day of the month. In divination, we use the time we make the divination. But with carefr.l thought we may use a time that marks the beginning of a subject. We might use the date of our birth, and derive a hexagram that charactarizes our life as a whole. We might take the time we signed the papers for our new house to divine the future surrounding it. For a specific example of the Hsien Tien method we will consider a date, say April 19th, 1982, at 10:20 a.m.: The Year 1982 The Month April The 19th Day ---19 Total 25 Divided by 8 = 3 with remainder 1 1 equals = Chien, the outer trigram The Year 1982 - -2 The Month April - - - -4 The 19th Day ---19 The 10th Hour - - -10 Total 35 Divided .by 8 = 4 with remainder 3 3 equals _ Li, the inner trigram The Year, Month, Day, Hour is 35 Divided by 6 is 5 with remainder 5 The moving Yao is the fifth line. As shown in figure 2-4a 2 Figure 2-4a Now we come to a new and important use of the concepts Ti and Yung. We say that the trigram that has the moving Yao is the Yung for the divination, and the other is the Ti. We regard the Ti trigram as being the fundamental one, just as earlier we likened it to the leading role in a play. An example. Suppose we interpret the inner trigram as ourselves and the outer trigram as the world, other people. And we find the moving Yao is line 4, 5, or 6. Then we find the fundamental change has occurred in others ' attitudes, which changes the whole situation for ourselves as Ti. We now respond to the new situation in a different way. Our basic trigram is unchanged, but it has variable aspects, and we select an aspect that harmonizes with the new Ti. If there is none, we are reserved and cautious. When we use the Hu Tien divination, we deal with events in the present. Using the analogy of our health, we are considering the part of our health that derives from our everyday habits and the way we are presently caring for ourselves. With the Hu Tien method we must select a subject in the field of life around us to divine with. We do not take any object for divination, but something that is unusual, out of the ordinary. Our guide in this can be sight itself — in a field of unmoving objects, our eyes will instantly spot something that moves. In a view that shows everything moving in a uniform manner, it will pick out the one object that moves irregularly. Our other senses work the same way. Thus if we see a highway with streams of cars moving along it, there A"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"9 2 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 93 is nothing to divinate with. If we then hear a sudden screech of brakes, there it is. The event may involve a physical object, but it can just as well involve human interaction. Perhaps we are walking along passing people on the sidewalk and suddenly we happen to glance at an old man walking by amd we feel some inexplicably intense impression. Whatever the event is, we observe it quietly and attentively, like a cat watching a bird. It is the subject of our attention and we derive the outer trigram directly from it. We do this by using what we know about relating the trigrams to anything. We must reflect on what we observed and sense its basic quality. Then we choose the trigram that represents that quality. We can learn to do this by studying the eight trigrams as well as their symbols, virtues, and specific examples. Some of the examples are traditional and their connection to the symbols and virtues cannot be grasped without knowing more of the tradition. But most of them can be puzzled out with reflection and imagination. For example, we can see with some thought how the telephone with its loud ringing call, and its potential for sending us on immediate errands can be Chen, thunder, a stimulus to movement. Whereas if the postman brings us mail, this is something that penetrates to our attention, but more gently and it can be Sun like wind. Every time we work out one of these connections, we will be adding to our ability to characterize things. This will make the Hu Tien method of divination possible, and just as important, we will be learning to observe any specific event and see the basic general quality that underlies it. Such valuable knowledge in turn will give us guides to our behavior. This kind of work becomes a schooling of the most valuable sort, where we are both student and teacher. Or looking at it another way, nature and life become our teacher. To use a specific example, the old man will represent Chien, for this is a traditional trigram for an older man. To select the inner trigram, we use the direction the subject of our attention is in. We use the Hu Tien arrangement, with Li, south, representing our front, Kan, north, representing our back; Chen, east, our left; Tui, west, our right, etc. as shown in figure 2-4b. If the old man was approaching us along the sidewalk, we have the inner trigram of Li. Finally, we add the number of each of the trigrams, according to its place in the Hsien Tien arrangement, and add the hour of the day to that number. We divide its sum by 6 to get the moving Yao from the remainder, as before. Thus the moving Yao is second Yao because of the following: The number of Chien is 1, the number of Li is 3. The number of hour is 10. Total is I + 3 + 10 = 14 Divided by 6 = 2 with a remainder 2. as shown in figure 2-4c. Front Back Figure 2-4b. Pen Kua Shih Kua x - - - - - - .X Figure 2-4c This kind of divination can be applied in many different ways to many situations. Its only limitation is the amount of self-training we have given ourselves and the seriousness with which we divinate. As we Left"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"9 4 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 95 work and make some progress with this, we can begin to see that divination is not for passive people who want \"easy answers \" so they don't have to work hard, and hope for a \"good divination \" so they can have something to day-dream about and then forget. It is for people who are living actively and who want to cultivate a good orientation towards the life around them, so that their living can be more effective. Now we will study a few interesting examples of the Hu Tien method of divination. As you recall, in this method, an unusual action or event determines the outer trigram, and the direction of the action in relation to the front of the observing diviner determines the inner trigram as shown in figure 2-5a. Finally, we determine the moving Yao by adding the number of each of the trigrams, according to its place in the Hsien Tien arrangement, as shown in figure 2-5b, and adding the hour of the day to that number. This sum divided by six gives us the moving Yao. O c O 0 00 Figure 2-5a Figure 2-5b Example One: The old man will die! Mr. Shao arose early one morning to take a walk along the lake. During his walk, he glanced at an old man just passing him from the other direction and had an odd impression that he could not name, but that was very intense. Shao stopped the old person and asked him, \" Has anything happened to you? Are you all right? \" \"I've just been walking. Why do you ask?\" the old man replied, puzzled. Shao went home puzzled, too, and consulted the I Ching. For the outer trigram he selected Chien, one of its images being an old man. Then he recalled where the old man was when he noticed him — he was in front of Shao and to the left. The position is represented by the trigram for Sun. The hexagram reads: Pen Kua t 44th Hexagram Gou, symbol of meeting t — 2_5 The Hu Tien Method: Shao's t i marvelous Pillow NE = f t t I s t Sun c=1 Kan 7 I \t1 0 0 0 0 Ken Hsien Tien i 2 3 0 0 t 0 0 i J t Li Chien Tui 8 0 0 ot~ 0 0 Kan I 1 Chen"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"9 6 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter i wo The Miracle Of Divination 97 This is the Pen Kua, or original hexagram and Shao next derived the Hu Kua by taking the second, third and fourth lines for the inner trigram, and the third, fourth and fifth lines for the outer: Hu Kua 1st Hexagram, Chien, sky or heaven We inspect further. The time in the Kwa Tsi for Gou is autumn. The upper trigram is Chien, or sky, and the lower, Sun, wind. We think of images of a cold autumn wind blowing dead leaves away. We look up the judgment for the moving Yao, the fourth. It is very poor: \"There are no fish in the bag. Disaster comes.\" The 4th Yao is in the outer trigram, so this is the first Yung Kua. The inner trigram is the Ti Kua. Using the Five Elements, we get the following: Pen Kua Hu Kua Shih Kua Metal Ke The meeting occurred on an early summer morning, not quite 5 o'clock. So the number of the hour is 4. Reading from the Hsien Tien list, the number of Sun is 5 and the number of Chien is 1. Adding these three numbers we have 10. Dividing by 6, we have 1 with a remainder of 4. The moving Yao is the fourth Yao and we use it to derive the Shih Kua from the Pen Kua: Ke i n Metal x I Metal Wood WWI 1 I. Ke Shih Kua J 0 0 57th Hexagram, Sŭn, or wind WWI Wood Wood Ti Kua 00 Now we consult the readings to carefully work on a judgment. Gou has one Yin Yao below and five Yang Yao above. In studying the i mage of the lines directly, we think of the bottom growing upward, and here this gives an image of Yin growing. Going further, we think, five Yang lines can be represented by five men and one Yin line by one woman, We read in the Kwa Tsi, \"The woman is too bold. Do not take her home with you.\" It is easy to see how this relates to a crime or trouble between the sexes. But there is nothing of this judgment suggested in the case of the old man. When we have a judgment like this that does not apply, we drop it completely. Metal destroys or Ke wood, according to the dynamic principles of the Five Elements. The situation in the Pen Kua, or original hexagram is poor. We go further and look at the Hu Kua, and here both Chien are metal, which intensifies the image even more. Finally we look at the Shih Kua, and both of the trigrams have the symbol of Sun, and the element wood. This corresponds to the Ti Kua in the Pen Kua. This is good, but it is too late. We see nothing but the repeated strong image of metal destroying wood, Yung Kua destroying Ti Kua. There is nothing close within the trigrams to help. It is like the proverb, \"water from afar cannot quench a nearby fire.\" There is nothing that can be done to evade the bad situation. We ask, \"When will the disaster happen? \" The rule is to add the numbers of the inner and outer trigrams and the number of the hour —"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"T Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 99 Pen Kua Hu Kua Shih Kua Earth Earth F Earth Ke I WEI Ti Kua N 1x Ke 1 Wood I 1 Wood 1 Water 98 The Tao Of I-Ching 5 plus 1 plus 4 — which equals 10. When the subjective diviner is sitting, we say the disaster comes slower and multiply by 2 to get the time. When the diviner is standing still, we take the sum directly. When the diviner is walking, we say it will come faster, and we divide the sum by 2. So we divide 10 by 2 and get 5. Inner + Outer + Hour = Time 5 + 1 + 4 = 10 Diviner walking 10 : 2 = 5 Let's return to the story. Mr. Shao determined that within five days the old man will have a disaster. So he visited the old man and warned him that he needed to be very careful in caring for himself the next five days. The old man accepted his advice, but thought, \"I am pretty careful in the way I live,\" so he did nothing special. On the fifth day, the old man went to a marriage party he was invited to. There was a big banquet, and as he sat eating fish a bone caught in his throat. This was before advanced medical knowledge. There was no doctor, and he died. It seems mysterious that the old man should die, and it should be so accurately predicted. When we do not understand a whole situation, what happens is always mysterious. It is like a man who has clogged arteries and exerts himself too much one day; his heart fails and he dies. The problem was already there, and the event is not surprising. Yet if we know nothing about it, it seems to be a mystery. And it is just as much a mystery if a man lives to be very, very old. Example Two. It is a beautiful morning. About 7:40 a.m., Shao is exercising under a tree. Suddenly he hears a cow mooing behind him, and it makes a hoarse sound, different from the sound cows usually make. Shao finishes his exercises, and when he goes home, he does a divination on the cow. The image of a cow is Kun, the outer trigram. The sound came from behind Shao, and this is Kan, the inner trigram. Kun is 8 and Kan is 6 and the hour is 7. This gives 21 and when it is divided by 6, the remainder is 3, so the moving Yao is 3. Thus we have: L - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - J The Pen Kua is the seventh Hexagram, called Shi ( i) or army. We read the Yao Tsi for the third Yao, and it says, \" To maintain an army without authorization is disaster.\" The cow is not much like an army, so we know only that the moving Yao is bad. Then we examine the Yung Kua and the Ti Kua for the first hexagram. Just as the hexagram begins with a lower trigram that is \" inner \" , so can we take this beginning Pen Kua as telling us about the \"inner\" situation for the cow. The cow has troubles. Its Ti Kua of earth destroys its Yung Kua of water. However, in the process of destroying the water, the earth is weakened. This is a case of the Ti Kua being weakened \"indirectly \" though not \"directly\". It can be compared to a parent who does not spend a sum of money directly, but spends it by giving it to a son. The parent still has less money in either case. In one the spending is direct; in the other, indirect. Thus, the cow's Ti Kua is weakened \"indirectly\". We go on to inspect the Hu Kua and see wood under earth. Here the Wood is another Yung Kua and it destroys the Ti Kua of Earth directly. We look at the Shih Kua and we have Wood under Earth again! The cow is beset with troubles from within and without. Shao adds up the outer trigram number, the inner number, and the number of the hour and gets 21. Shao was standing at the time he heard the cow, and he makes the unhappy conclusion the cow will be killed within 21 days. Later he goes to the farm to find out about the cow. He discovers that after 20 days, someone bought the cow and killed it for beef. Exercise One. How does Shao know the young man will be married within 17 days?"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"100 - The Tao Of I-Ching About 7:30 one morning Shao is standing on the corner of a street. He sees a young man crossing the street and coming towards him. The young man has an expression of great happiness on his face, though there does not seem to be any reason. Shao asks him, \"Why do you feel so happy?\" The young man replies, \"I don't know. I guess I was daydreaming.\" Shao goes home and does a divination for this young man. He finds out he will be married within 17 days. Dear reader, can you trace this judgment? Hint. The image of a young man is Ken, and he approaches Shao from the front. This is Li. The answer is at the end of this chapter, on page 88 and 89. Exercise Two. How does Shao know that the rooster will be killed in 10 days? It is around 4:30 a.m. Shao is sleeping on his bed when he is awakened by the crowing of a neighbor's rooster. The sound comes from behind him and to the right as he lays in bed. Usually the rooster never crows at night. Shao does a divination when he arises, and concludes the rooster will be cooked in 10 days. How does he know this? Hint: The image of the chicken is Sun. The direction gives the inner trigram Chien. The answer is at the end of this Chapter, on page 89 and 90. In working on the exercises, there are simple principles for the student to keep in mind. Divination failure and success can be compared to a superstitious person and a calm person who both hear a strange sound on the other side of a hill. The superstitious person does not listen to the sound calmly and try to notice things about it. He immediately jumps to conclusions: \"Oh, it is good!\" or \"Oh, it is bad!\" Since he does not pay attention to the sound, his judgment is based on whatever unrelated feeling he had just before he heard the sound. Once the superstitious person has made such a snap judgment, he then misinterprets and distorts every new sign to fit his preconceived decision. The result is that the person often interprets danger as good news and is harmed, or interprets good news as danger, and runs away from it. The calm person has inner feelings and hopes, too, but instead pays attention to the sound. He listens to it and tries to discover new things about it. First he hears the sound. Then he notices that the sound is coming closer. It sounds like an animal of some kind. But animals rarely run about and make noises, because it attracts danger to them. So Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 101 he becomes wary. As he listens more, he notices that the sound is rapidly moving closer. Finally he sees something break through the bushes and immediately sees that it is a wounded, ferocious wild bear. He climbs a tree long before it comes close. Divination is like this. Even if we are very clever and know all the signs, it is worthless if we do not know how to be calm and observe quietly. We just confuse ourselves. But if we are calm and attentive, we may find our way correctly even if we are not very clever. And because we are calm and look over our work afterwards to correct ourselves and learn more, we increase our knowledge each time we divinate. In divination, we ask for knowledge from the 4th dimensional world, and we do it within the limits in which we live. This is like extending our intuition, which also comes to us from the 4th dimension. We learn divination the same way we learn any skill. Did we learn how to drive a car in one day? Did we learn to read and write in one day? No. Each day we learned a little, and gradually added to it. In learning divination, we study our own life and past and examine ourselves. This gradually teaches us to observe more accurately how we feel and act. Eventually we add to this and learn to correct things we don't like. The more we understand about ourselves, the easier it is to be calm and alert, and to extend our knowledge to other situations. Eventually we come to have a solid basis from this work to study and learn more about other aspects of life. Suppose we are angry. We study ourselves and learn that often when we get angry we do something rash and get into trouble. So we learn: anger can quickly bring danger. Then we notice that when another person gets very angry, they do not behave as reckless as we did, but become sullen and negative, and remain that way all day. Thus we learn: anger can spoil things very slowly and indirectly. Another time we notice a person who gets very angry, but doesn't do anything special. A day or week later we see the person, and find he has found an opportunity and is energetically doing something to correct the situation that ;nade him angry. Thus we learn: anger can create something good. When we learn directly this way, by being our own teacher, the learning is much more intense and valuable. This is why the I Ching has the simplest possible structure. It enhances our learning instead of getting in the way of it. Within this structure of simplicity, there a r e various ways of"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"10 2 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 1 03 divination we can follow. Another way may be more appealing or useful to us. We may also want to advance our knowledge further. Whatever our ultimate goal, we learn the basics first and study them over and over till we master them. Answer to Exercise One. The young man will marry in 17 days. The young man represents Ken, the youngest brother, and is the outer trigram. He faces Shao as Shao waits standing at the intersection. Facing is Li, the inner trigram. Using the Hsien Tien numeration, Ken is 7 and Li is 3, and the time is 7, totalling 17. Divided by 6, the remainder is 5, the Moving Yao. This gives — 22 Pen 40 Jie 37 Jiaren The first hexagram is Pen or Grace, and part of the judgment is \" only small things further.\" In it we see fire feeding or Sheng the earth of Ken, which is stopping. This suggests the young man giving his enthusiasm to something, and not getting a response. Since he is the \"youngest brother\" just at the age of starting out in life and being attracted to women, we think maybe he has a girlfriend. The Yao Tsi for line 5 speaks of a person who rejects empty luxury for simplicity. The person finds a good friend who accepts their very meagre gifts of friendship and reciprocates. This suggests the young man's suit to the girl is finally accepted in the best way. The Hu Kua of Jie revolves around \"lessening of tensions,\" just like the cloudburst that brings rain lessens the electrical charges in the air and is relaxing. In the Hu Kua we have wood supporting fire and water putting it out, two diverging indications. Since the moving Yao is good, we may assume the young lady ' s acceptance of her suitor relieves all the tension of his courting her, just as water puts out fire. The final hexagram Jiii ren stands for the family, and is a clear indication of marriage. Here we find the water is gone, but the wood remains, supporting the fire of the young man's Ti Kua, which suggests the marriage is a good one. Since Shao is standing when he sees the young man, the number 17 remains, and he decides the marriage will occur in about 17 days. Answer to Exercise Two. The rooster is Sun, the outer trigram. The direction of his crowing is behind Shao to the right, which is Chien. Sun is 5 and Chien is 1 and the hour is 4. The sum is 10. Divided by 6, it gives a remainder of 4, the Moving Yao. The result is — Metal In the Pen Kua, the hexagram is Xiaoxii, which translates as \"taming power of the small.\" The Ti Kua of the rooster is metal, which is Ke wood. The Pen Kua can be interpreted as the inner environment of the rooster, so it is destroying something that helps it and suffers loss. The moving Yao of 4 speaks about a person in a dangerous situation who restrains a powerful person because they are \"in the right.\" But the rooster is weak in his situation, suggesting he may fail. The Hu Kua is complicated with its wood being destroyed by metal, and its fire destroying metal. One might say \"the metal destroys the wood so it cannot feed the fire, so the fire is not strong enough to melt the metal.\" But the first indication in the Pen Kua is contrary to this idea, and we accept that one and reject this. Further, the general meaning of the Hu Kua of Kui ' is \"opposition and conflicts \" , and this reinforces the notion that the rooster is having trouble. What is the rooster's trouble? It doesn't lay eggs, there are always more of them than are needed for breeding, so roosters make good eating. We think possibly the farmer will kill the rooster for food. In the final trigram of Gia ' n there is metal over metal. This suggests Earth Wood Wood WEI Metal 9 Xiaoxŭ Fire EMI f4 .1 s II M■ s 1 1 1 I K Fire =NI I ♦ Water Wood Wood 38 Kai Ke Fire • Metal 1 Gian"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"10 4 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 105 that whatever the fate of the original metal, it is underlined many times as being what will happen. The rooster was in trouble with a powerful opposition, and we conclude it was killed and eaten. The original sum is 10, and Shao is laying down, so we estimate the fate comes slowly, and multiply by 2 to get 20 days. The Hsien Tien method refers to the roots of a situation, which determine its present and future. To review, we derive a number for the year by dividing the year by twelve and taking the remainder, or the number 12 if there is no remainder. To this number we add the number of the month, and then the day of the month. We divide the sum by eight and its remainder gives us the outer trigram, if there is no remainder, the trigram is 8. To find the inner trigram, we determine the year using the above formula. We then add to it the month, day, and the hour. We count the hours of the day from one to twenty-four, and if the time is not a whole hour, we drop the minutes. For example, 11:47 would be counted as 11. We then divide our sum by eight to get our inner trigram. When we get our numbers, we take our trigrams from the Hsien Tien numeration: 1 — Chien, 2 — Tui, 3 — Li, 4 — Chen, 5 — Sun, 6 — Kan, 7 — Ken, 8 — Kun. The moving Yao is the inner trigram sum divided by six instead of eight, giving remainders from one to five. We use the number six for no remainder. Example One. The wind is whistling, the leaves are flying all about, and Shao is out taking a brisk autumn walk in the suburbs of his city. It's around 9:30 in the morning on the 17th of September. As he looks at the changing colors of the plants and trees and idly thinks of winter and his warm home, he suddenly notices two sparrows staging a ferocious mid-air battle for seemingly no reason at all. They finally break apart and fall to the ground exhausted, neither a winner. The unusual incident attracts Shao's interest, and he decides to divinate. Shao lives during the Sung Dynasty, and it is the year Wang Yu 4. ( f.= ft Di . ). This is the year 1,052 in our numeration. The number for 1,052 is 8 (1,052 divided by 12 is 87 with a remainder of 8). The number of September is 9. The number of the day is 17. The number of 9:30 a.m. is 9. The outer trigram is (8 + 9 + 17) - 8 = 4 with a remainder of 2. Two is Tui For the inner trigram, we have (9+9+ 17+9)-8 = 5 with a remainder of 3. Three is Li The moving Yao is (8 + 9 + 17 + 9) - 6 = 7 Remainder 1. Line one is the moving Yao. The Pen Kua or original hexagram, is the 49th, Ge ( ), Metal — Ti Kua Fire — Yung Kua We see how the Yung Kua is Li, fire, and the Ti Kua is Tui, metal. Fire destroys or \"Ke\" metal, which suggests a problem. We derive the Hu Kua and Shih Kua by the methods described in page 57 and 53. Now we see the situation intensified because the inner trigram of Hu Kua is Sun, wood .

Wood Shen or feeds fire, making it more intense. But who or what represents the Ti Kua? Shao deliberates and decides it is a young woman, one of the images of Tui, which is the trigram of the youngest daughter. He concludes she will be hurt. In the Hu Kua, the inner trigram is Sun or wood, while its outer trigram is Chien, metal. Metal destroys Wood, and we know the part of the body of Sun is the thigh, so the young woman will be wounded in the thigh. We go on to the Shih Kua to learn the final story. Here the inner trigram is Ken, earth, and earth creates or sustains the Metal in Tui, the original Ti Kua. This is a good sign, so Shao decides that the young woman's wound will not be serious. The next day in the yard next door to Shao's home, a young woman sneaks into the garden and climbs a pear tree to steal some fruit. The gardener sees her and comes running out of his house shouting. The young girl panics and falls out of the tree. As she falls, a broken branch lacerates her thigh, but she is otherwise unhurt. The time is about 2 in the afternoon. When Shao divinated, he determined this hour as well. First, he added the number of the outer trigram, that of the inner trigram, and the hour of the original event. This is (2 + 3 + 9). He was sitting when he divinated. This means the time comes slower, so he multiplied the sum of 14 by 2, giving 28. He determined that the event would come in 28 hours, rather than days or months or years. Adding 28 hours to 9:30 a.m., we get 1:30 p.m. the following day, the approximate time of the mishap. Exercise Problem: Do you want to divinate the fortune of your own life? Hint: Use the numbers of your birth hour, day, month and year to derive your Pen Kua, moving Yao, and the following Hu Kua and Shill Kua. The Pen Kua is the image of your life as a whole, so study the Kua Tsi in the I Ching carefully. The Yao Tsi of the moving Yao gives the present status of your living. A strong Ti Kua in good relation to the Yung Kuas means good fortune, success in your career. Poor indications tell you how to look for your weaknesses and moderate them. In a famous divining book called Pu Shih Yuan Kuei ( ), the following characterizations of personality are given for the inner trigram of the Pen Kua: Chien or Kun — a warm-hearted, benevolent person. Sun — a cool, heartless person. Kan — a clever person with sweet, honeyed words. a lying, deceitful person. Chen — a person born at the wrong time, unlucky. Ken — a person who is always very fair, who doesn't let personal feelings sway objective decisions. Li — a clever, open-minded person, optimistic and good. Tui — a person with a smiling face, gentle and affable, who has good judgment for propriety and moderation in speech and behavior. If we find ourselves with a poor designation, we need not be dismayed, but instead may ask ourselves what we know of our character and what the truth of it is. Perhaps we have Kan for an inner trigram, and we look and find we are always making \"promises\" and often not keeping them, that we \"talk a good show\" but don't act so well. Then we know what is meant by Kan. We must realize that this is not necessarily how we will always behave, and there is nothing we can do about it. It simply indicates that this is the kind of weakness we will show when we are weak and careless. In addition, we may learn to find positive aspect of these qualities. For example, we may take a strong Kan character, and use it to become a highly successful \" story teller \" and writer of fiction. Our ability to use \"honeyed words\" may someday lead to our talking to someone who wants to commit suicide and convincing him that life has something good to offer, and that he should try to improve his life rather than throw it away. The same is true if we divinate our fate and find it is a terrible one that gets worse with time! This fate cannot become reality if a person is willing to work and learn. If the reading shows weaknesses, we can exercise our will and spirit to avail ourselves of a corresponding source of energy that \"fate\" also provides in our situation. Likewise, if we receive a favorable divination, we must be on our guard. Remember: \" A fool and his money are soon parted. \" If we use the favorable indications as an excuse to be lazy and careless, we can lose our good fortune and have a miserable life. Meanwhile, the person with"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"10 8 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 109 \"bad luck\" who learns to equalize his situation, can have a very happy life. Example Two. The Peonies are trampled by two horses. It is May 3, 1053. A friend invites Shao to a small luncheon to enjoy the beauty of his peonies. The flowers are famous among the Chinese and have the honorary name of \"king of the flowers \" . Shao's friend has a large house by the canal, and he keeps his backyard planted with flowers. The beautiful show they create each year draws admiring visitors from all over the city. As Shao enters his friend's property he sees the soft light green of leaves opening, hears the birds twittering happily, smells the cold rising from the dank ground mingling with the warm spring breeze. He enters the garden with the peonies in full color and feels he is in an enchanted world. After the small group has lunch they sit and enjoy the weather. They all know Shao specializes in studying the I Ching, and listen alertly when Shao's host says, \"The flowers are so beautiful and have such a powerful influence on the enjoyment of our culture, it almost seems equal to many human influences. Do these flowers have a fate, Shao, and can a person like you discover what their fortunes are to be?\" \"Everything in the world has its own life cycle and fortune,\" Shao replies, \"I'll check on it for you.\" The time is about one o'clock in the afternoon. Shao studies briefly and then tells his friends \"It seems sad to say this, but the flowers will probably be destroyed by horses tomorrow afternoon.\" The group of friends is at once sceptical and dismayed, and they part wishing that they had not asked about the flowers. The next day, at noon, a small group of city officials ride over to Shao's friend's home to look at the famous flowers. Two of the men have army horses just being trained to civil use. One horse nips the other and they start a wild fight that no one can quell, and they trample over half the flowers in the garden. Let me explain how Shao foresaw this event so precisely. The number for the year 1,053 is obtained by dividing by 12, and getting a remainder of 9. The number of May is 5. The number of the day is 3. The hour of divination is 12:30, its number is 12. Summing (9 + 5 + 3) we get 17 and dividing it by 8, we have a remainder of 1. The outer trigram is thus Chien. Doing the calculation for the inner trigram, we begin with (9 + 5 + 3 + 12), and obtain a remainder of 5 or Sun. Dividing (9 + 5 + 3 + 12) by 6, we get a remainder of 5, so the moving Yao is 5. Thus the Pen Kua is the 44th hexagram of Gou ( Vr T i ), and the Hu Kua and Shih Kua derived from it create this arrangement: In the Pen Kua we see that meta: destroys or Ke wood, so that the Yung destroys the Ti. The peonies are in danger. In the Hu Kua, there is double Chien, two more Yung Kua of metal, which means great disaster for the Ti Kua. When Shao looks at these three Gian of metal, he thinks: \" Gia ' n represents horse, it would be easy for the flowers to be trampled by a horse.\" Then he looks at the Li in the outer trigram of the final hexagram and thinks \"Li is the brightest sunshine, this will happen around noon. But what day? I am divining as we stand here, not walking, so it is not soon, not today. Flowers have a short cycle of blooming, it is tomorrow.\" If he had divined the time by numbers he would have gotten the number 18, or 6 tomorrow morning, but the Li he judges is a clearer sign, flowers and bright light go together very well. Exercise Problem.. Each day for several days, pick some topic of interest in your everyday living and divinate and make a judgment by yourself. Take care to do the work in a calm frame of mind. Select a subject that you can check on later to test the accuracy of your work. If it ' s inaccurate, which it often may be, go over your decisions and see what the correct 1 [ [ Metal t x Metal I Wood Ti Kuu Metal Wood [ 44 Gdu 1 Gia'n 50 Ding } x Fire"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"1 10 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Two The Miracle Of Divination 111 ones would be. To make this kind of study we might compare ourselves to a naturalist who has become a novice birdwatcher. He sees a bird flutter in the tree out of the corner of his eye, and he follows it as closely as he can and notes as much as he can of its coloring and pattern, style of flight, size, and song. Then he studies his identification manual and finally narrows down what he believes the bird to be: a robin or a rare warbler. However, we have a special advantage over the novice birdwatcher, because once the bird has flown away, he can never tell if he was right or wrong in identifying it. For us, when we have divinated, the study is just beginning. We have an \"expert friend\" to tell us in great detail how accurate our judgment has been. That friend is the event itself. Using the event we divinated about to improve ourselves, we gradually extend our studies. For example, we divinate and conclude that the active agent in some coming event will be Kan, and that it will be a person. We see Kan means water, and \"to entrap\", we read \"thief\" and \"boatman\". We look at the connected places, bar — maybe a bartender, gas — maybe a gas station attendant, tryst — maybe two lovers. We even extend our thinking: \" Thief \" could indicate an undercover agent out to entrap a thief instead. Every indication gives us a clue to narrow down the list of \"suspects\" in our search. We may read that Kan is the \"middle son\", and this tells us a lot - if it is connected with a gas station, then the \" younger son \" would obviously be the person who pumps gas, and the \" middle son\" the skilled mechanic with the tow truck, and the \"elder son\" the owner of the business. There is a bonus in this kind of study, and that is how surprising it is at first to find the event that finally occurs has such close ties to the divination of it even if we missed or misinterpreted those ties. Once we have seen such a correspondence, any feeling we have that we are dealing with empty imaginings is gone forever. Example Three. A father is more experienced than his son. It is a winter night,and snow is whirling about the house. Shao and his son sit and chat around the fireplace. Suddenly someone is knocking at the door. First there is a single knock, after a while, five in a row. Then a voice calls, \"Shao, are you home? I want to borrow something from you.\" Shao opens the door and the visitor enters with a burst of snow and wind. Shao already has a plan. He wants to see how good his son is with divination. He says to his visitor, \"Don ' t say anything about what you want to borrow, I want my son to figure this out. Here, come over and make yourself comfortable around the fireplace.\" Like father, like son — Shao's son is an I Ching student. No doubt he can start with the numbers of hour, day, month and year to develop a Pen Kua, Hu Kua and Shih Kua. But because this is a test of his skill, he wants to develop a new method on his own. He recalls that their visiting neighbor knocked on the door once, then five times. He decides that is his clue, and he calls the first knock the outer trigram, Chien, and calls the second group of five his inner trigram. Which comes to be Sun . It is past 10 at night, so the hour is 22. To get the Moving Yao he adds one and five and twenty-two to get twenty-eight, and when divided by six, the remainder is four. The moving Yao is 4. His complete divination is: It is a very special case, for of the six trigrams, three are Gia'ns and three are Suns. Gia ' n is metal and Sun is wood. So the object their neighbor wants to borrow is related to wood and metal. So the son judges and says, \"You want to borrow a hoe. \" \"You are wrong, \" says Shao, \"he wants to borrow an axe. \" \"What do you want to borrow!? \" father and son ask the neighbor. almost in unison. \"An axe. \" comes the reply. Shao smiles and explains to his son how he erred. Sun tends to represent something long, like a wooden handle. Gia'n stands for a J Wood Ti Kua Metal Wood f • 44 Gou 1 Gia'n 57 Sian 0 Yung Kua Metal + 0"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"1 1 2 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Three The Cradle Of Chinese Culture 1 13 round shape, especially of metal. A hoe usually is pointed or has a flat edge of metal, an axe always has a curved edge to cut wood better. But the two are close, so Shao looks for another sign to confirm. Is it daytime? Then the visitor may use a hoe in daytime. Nighttime? This is impossible, because there is no light for working outdoors in the garden in the middle of winter. Yet an axe, yes, maybe the neighbor needs to cut up some firewood. He can do this at night. Shao decides for the axe. Its use is acceptable within the time of the divination. This shows us the role of change in divination. Everything changes, and we adjust our divination to fit what we know of the time. In this way we have a general guide, and the divination gives us more exact direction. We might ask of Shao and his son, \"What about a hammer? It has a round head.\" In Shao's time, what we today call a hammer did not exist. Since it exists in our time, when we divinate we of course, would use this knowledge. Also, follow what strongly impresses us when the question occurs, just as Shao's son had his attention attracted to the knocking sounds at the door and used them to derive the trigrams. We must begin by using a simple method and working with it, otherwise we become confused with too much. Yet what we are doing is not \"dead\" or \"fixed\" but must always adapt a little bit to the circumstances and the time. If we are in a church, we sense one mood; in a park, we sense another; having a snack in our kitchen, we sense another. Can you tell which are the trigrams for each of these? You can tell if you study and think about them. We have only 64 hexagrams to use, and only a few hundred combinations when we divinate with one mvoing Yao. Yet these are like a car with four wheels, it can take us anywhere if we know how to drive. We can learn if we keep a spirit of lightheartedness but always seriousness within it — just like a young man driving in his sports car may smile and wave, but his attention is always focused clearly on the road and the traffic. CCCC CCf Chapter Three: f C CRADLE OF CHINESE CULTURE CCC =In 3-1 How to Read the 64 Hexagrams -- The earlier part of this book is an intensive preparation for us to learn to use the hexagrams well. Now we come to the actual hexagrams where we focus all this work. There are several points to consider in learning to make the best use of this section. *Pinyin. The usual English spellings of Chinese words that are supposed to give a clue to their pronounciation are dropped in favor of the standardized Pinyin spellings, used in teaching the Chinese language to English speaking people. This creates a consistent standard in approaching the pronounciation. If a student wants to learn the correct pronounciation, they can do so easily by getting a language teaching book from the library, or taking a course, and they' will find the same standards there. *Ancient wood block prints for each hexagram. We often say \"a picture is worth a thousand words \" and today scientists study how a person ' s \"visual mind \" is even more complex and powerful than their \" verbal mind\". In many kinds of learning, words are merely a start for a person to build up a mental picture for themselves. Using pictures"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"1 14 The Tao Of I-Ching directly to work with is very important in developing our whole selves. Not only will we learn to \"read directly\" from pictures, but it will train us to make better visual images from words. Look at one of the pictures. Forget the words and don't read them. Look at the picture with all your attention for a minutes, or five or ten minutes. Keep your imagination active and look for the impressions you get from the images. You will find you have all sorts of distinct, personal impressions. This is your personal image. This is what is important — not what someone else tells you are supposed to see there. Once you have done this, you can then see ways that the picture relates to the event you are divinating about. Suppose we take Hexagram 1 1, Tai or Positive. We see a little boy sitting on the clouds. In the text accompanying the picture, there is a suggestion of possible meanings — \"This can be good. A sudden rise to success. Or poor, to aim very high, but to care nothing about developing the fundamentals.\" We can see how easily these two images develop. The heavens always represent advanced development, and we expect to see a youngster beginning life near the ground. Here he is high, so it means he has great talents or achievements that have taken him up fast. Similarly, we can think of the little boy filled with enthusiastic dreams about \"what I'm going to do when I grow up\" and meanwhile neglecting his homework at school and going nowhere! There are many possibilities. A pregnant woman who divinates about her child and sees this picture may have a strong impression of realizing she is going to have a boy. A parent with a sick child may have cause for alarm. The picture may suggest their son will never grow to an adult, but will die and go to heaven. You may look at the picture and seeing the boy instantly get a strong impression of someone you ' ve just been thinking about. And you may see how the boy ' s expression and place in the picture define how that person is developing. To divinate this way can become very powerful as we practice and use all our abilities to unravel the reading. It requires our complete seriousness and sincerity in doing this, as in any serious work ':-here we need to do something well. Chapter Three The Cradle Of Chinese Culture 1 15 Some people may say \"This is just superstition! There is no scientific method to it.\" But this is just an insistence that everything in life has only one rigid meaning that can be spelled out on paper. To correct this, we should look at our daily life, and see how much of it has the deepest meaning, yet it cannot be spelled out. Suppose you ask your self \"Tomorrow is a holiday. What will I do?\" Is there any standard answer to this? Even the way we reach our decision is not standardized and cannot be described. And this is our life with all its order and meaning. So to practice this divination well, we need to open our mind's eye to the non-standard way we live our daily life, and we can make progress. *Natural and man-made. In my book The Tao of Meditation, I describe in greater detail how our activities have an element that is `natural' and an element that is `man-made'. The point in studying meditation is to learn to know the natural clearly, so we can live well and avoid confusion: wherever we find troubles in human living, we always find people with different `man-made' visions of life conflicting with each other, because each is absolutely convinced theirs is \"natural.\" We define the natural as that which is completely tied in with the whole of life, the fourth dimensional world that we live in, in a three dimensional way. When we divinate, we are receiving a fourth dimensional image that is projected into our three dimensional undestanding, and this image is like a blue-print of a building. It is a complete blue-print of the event, including its beginning and ending. In divination, we are using some things that are more natural, and others that are necessarily worked out into man-made and personal terms. For example, the divination tools of Principle Position, Matching, and Middle Position are natural and direct. Consider Hexagram 1 1, Tai, or Positive. Analysis: **The situation is good, because 1st, 3rd, 4th and 6th are all in principle position. **The match is very good, and this means dealing with other people are perfect. You can note how 1st and 4th, 2nd and 5th, 3rd and 6th are all one Yang and one Yin. **The middle position is very poor because the 2nd Yao is Yin and 5th"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"1 16 The Tao Of I-Ching Chapter Three The Cradle Of Chinese Culture 1 17 Principle Position Yin Yang Yin Yang Yin Yang Good Poor Good Good Poor Good Qian ~i Heaven above Heaven below The Heaven 1 Yao is Yang, neither in principle position. This means you don ' t have a clear goal, a strong will to promote, develop your goals. **As a whole, the three Yang Yao below the three Yin Yao mean that Yang is growing up from the bottom to drive away the Yin. This is very active, or very good. We can see from the above how the natural meanings of the lines form themselves into an abstract pattern that we can directly apply to our human situation. Now, by contrast, the Hints on Divination where we have the Kwa Tsi and Yao Tsi and `new' versions of them in our present cultural terms, these are completely man-made. They are there for you to refer to, a stimulus to evolving your own personal ones. *A final note. The open circle o indicates a Yao is a good one in terms of the whole hexagram, and the black circle • indicates it is a bad one. If there is no circle by the Yao, it means it is so-so. This is the same whith the notes on the seasons. If we say the hexagram is good in spring, had in summer, then fall and winter are so-so. The open circle is derived from the interrelations of all the lines. The seasonal information is derived from application of the trigram cycles to the year. So we can say these indications are more natural."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"1 18 The Tao Of 1-Ching n Window of the hexagram n 1.
