About a decade later, in my first publi shed article, \"The Semantics of 'God\"' (The Realist, April 1959 ) I asked if Divinity should be consider ed a He, a She or an It , and although I suggested that \"it\" seemed more appro priate for our scientific age, my secon d published article, \"Joyce and Taoism (fames Joyce Review, Summer 1959) argued that there was poetic validity in Joyce 's and Lao Tse's vision of the Eternal Femini ne as the hidden force behind history.

Some of these techniques have been around for centu ries, and pr obably for millennia, as closel y-guarded \"inner -inner teachings \" of certain esoteric orders of alchemist s and Illuminat i.

Terror and punishment do not lend the mselv e s to creating useful, joyful, flexible , intelligent human beings. ULTIMATE JOY THROUGH DISCIPLINE Middle Path sexuality is neither indulgence nor abstinence but ultimate joy through discipline. Unlike most forms of Tantric practice, orgasm is not only all owed but essential to create the desired results. Avoiding orgasm is a No-No for Western Tantra. MELTING & GIVING Many forms of Tantra are restrictive and limiting, focusing on holding back and holding in. Western Tantra is complet ely differen t. Its focus is on melting and giving, using only small amounts of holding to make the Gift more beautiful and com­ plete. Western Tantra holds the belief that complet e Orga sm is freeing, and energi zing. In fact, the methods are desig ned with that result in mind . The outcome of following the creative and liberating path of Middle Pat h Sexualit y (MPS) is enlig htenment and the creation of what I term the Magickal Child. This \"Child\", whether physical or spiritual will become the leading edge of the new human race the planet is creating. The planet is now beginning to accelerat e its plans for Quality. The process is somewhat demanding and is not designed for the average student, b u t for those who have the persistence and determination to work Izard with joy to achieve their goals of flexibi lity, increased intelligence and enlightenment.

It is \"spiritual\" in trans­ formi ng consciousness into dimensions unknown to \"ordinary\" (dom estica ted) humanity.

Is it the taboos which keep us interested and excited? Is it the violat ion of Taboo which drives us to the extremes we go through? Is it the suggestive ness of the use of clothes?

We bring other humans into the world to take our place. We create a phantom person al immo rtality. What if we were immortal? Would we want children? What if sex were not pleasurable at all? Would it still be popul ar. How many children would there be? Is the sexual instinct and its expression a big joke on ratio­ nal/ consc ious man? After all, anyone can do it. Anyone can make childr en. Anyone can and will be a god to these chil­ dren. Are our egos so weak we need childr en to look up to us or do we reprod uce because we ca n't we help it? Is that why sex is such a mystery to civilized man? Why is it so privat e?

LOVE & SEX: THE REAL TABO O To paraphrase Dr. Robert Stein, (1974) from his fascin ating book Incest and Human Love, when a culture becom es preoccu­ pied with inhibiting and control ling the instinct ual forces of life, which of course includes sexuality, we can assume that its metho ds of copin g with the incest taboo are also inadequate. In other words the culture's social institutions are failing. If we combine this idea with Michel Foucault's notio n that \"sexual ity\" evolves from the need of the power structure to con tr o l sex for its own economic and pol it ical purposes, we are left with a sorry state of a ff a irs . This sorry state of affairs is kn ow n a s s pl i t t ing . What I me a n here is that sex and love have a difficult time in f i n di ng comp l e te unified exp ress i o n . (This work at t e mp t s to addre ss this situation.) From Stein 's p oin t of view this is the way a c u lt u r e copes with the incest taboo, and from Fouca ult's it is the way a culture chann els sex for its own purposes of power. In other words, love is disconnected from sex in Western Civiliz ation. We have been told that sex and love should be one, but not as an experience - rather as a state of law . In this sense we are left with sex as reprod uction and lovel ess compulsion . Marriage is designed as a unit of reprodu ction for the purposes of creation and consum ption. The true expression of love and sex are second ary - left in the realm of romant ic fantasy , a hope or a dream.

Conversely, com pulsive sexualit y is an attempt to free sex fr o m the purp oses of reprod uct i on and soci al control. However, it too is devoid of true Union, as dee p l o v e has a f or c ed assoc iation with the necessi ty of a commi tmen t. Would orgastic love be felt more readily if co mmi tmen t were not an obligation, not a \"law\" indoct rina ted since infancy? Com pulsive sexu ality also serves to dem onstrat e the \"fail ure \" of our c ul tur e in cont rolling the fear of incest. Instead of addr essi ng incest, it has addressed sex uality itself , thus confounding us to believe that the \"awful\" effects of incest are co-extensive with sex itself. How does our culture differen tiat e sex from inc est? In fact it does not addr ess this issue in a cons ciou s man ner at all, but allows the un consci o us to deal \\vith the pr oblem. Thus sex and love are spli t in p r a c ti c e, although frequ ently alive in fanta sy. We have been taught tha t the deep love we felt as childr en tow ard our parents ��must not\" be associated wit h sex and the sex \\\\' e fe lt during our ado lesc ence \"m ust not\" be associat ed with love .

The fear of being overwhe lmed or taken over by the power of the instincts no longer terrifies the ind ividual who is then free to consciously participate in hi s or her own evolution.

Instead of perceiving them as bei ng opposed to conscio usness and civilizat ion as w e have been ta ught from the Christ ian-Judeo world -view, we see them as th e loving root from which rationality itself sprin gs.

LOVE, DEATH & SE X: ANOTHER TABOO True orgast ic bliss is very similar to death. The only reason deat h should be feared is that m ost people have never lived. Joy in death, letting go com pletely, is akin to the results obtained b y pract icing West ern Tantra . However, orgastic bliss can only be experien ced if love and sex become one. Much like love and sex have been split in the Western world, life and death have been split. Complet e orgasm embraces and heals the splits between life/ death and sex/love. Once the healing has occurred the need for and depende nce on ordinary religion also vanishes . Thus the priests and the politicians have fought hard again st the orgastic response. This is even true of many forms of Eastern Tantra, as well as the ancient Kabba lists who realized the power and implica­ tions of the sex act. (However, both groups demand the giving up of pleasur e, and/ or the sanction of the priest .) West ern Tantra as described in this book demands neither. It combines aspects of the Kabbalah with the discipline of Eastern Tantra. More important ly it provides the methods necessary for freeing the body I mind from the pains and cha ins of early training. Thus it functions first as an Opening, then a Meditation and then Death. The Death I speak of is the Death of Union, wher e all divisi on merges back into itself. Complet e orgasm is a Death. Complet e o rgasm is a Birth.

Awareness that a difficulty or a desir e exists i s both the FIRST an d NEC ESS ARY s te p for change . Most humans are not aware of their ignora nce. However, the y credit them selves as being aware when in fact they are sound asle ep. This might be best understood if you think of the mind as a tape recorder. A tape recorder doesn't have to be awar e that it is a tape recorder to perform its function. Nor does it have to know how it works . Neither does it need to know what is recorded on it or how it got there . It sim ply does its job. A human being is different from a tape recorder in the sense that it vigorously defends itself from being erased. One reason why it does this is because it believes that its recordings are its soul, its essence . The h um an bei ng respo nds to awareness as an attack against its essence or self-esteem. Awareness means looking at one's self from another vantage point without being judgmen­ tal. It is pure witnessing . This can b e v e r y pa inf u l because the rud i m e nt ary form of awar eness is always co m p ar ati v e and judgmental. Awar eness devel ops b y compar is on s. The mind compares itself to some stand ard or ideal which also has been recorded . Now the mind evaluat es whether or not it has meas ured up. If it hasn't measured up it tries to make changes by what e v e r means it has been ta u g ht. The ordinar y way of doing this is to att ac k. An y attack is u s u all y met with a co u nt e r - at ta c k. The end result is usually frustration, depr ession followed by denials and excus es. This entire process is NOTHIN G BUT a model . It is learned and it serves the purpose of keeping the person \"safely\" asleep. Change in this fashion is at best slow, unnec essarily painful and haphazard . When two or more people get together the same process takes place. Each person secretly compares him/herse lf to the other. Each rates the other on int ernal scales of worth and value.

Relational maps are drawn from these comparisons. One of the first maps is the denial that such comparisons are taking place at all. To admit this is a sign that one is vulner­ able. To admit vulnerability to oneself or another is a loss of worth . The process goes on and on. No wonder there is so little Love, understanding and commun ication in the world. No wonder people are unhappy and misera ble. Tantra does away with all of this non-se nse. ORDER & CHAOS A number of points which diff erentia te this form of Tantra from all others is the juxtaposi tion of complete order and control with total orgastic chaos. What we mean by chaos here is comp lete loss of contro l. We learn contro l t o l ose Control. Chaos is simply the principle of Indet erminacy. Thus we have an integrati on of two extremes leadin g to the ultimate Tantric dance. This is the Power of Lov e Mel ting. It is our chance fo r Intimac y with the Unknown .

It is the roots of the male and fema le flower divi ded by the Act of the Goddess making Herself kn o w n to Hersel f, reaching ou t with consci ous intention to re­ unite in bliss. Thus the pa in of divis ion is redeemed by the joy of union . In this sense, the trauma of creation is healed, allow­ i ng the world to leap into its next stage of evolution. It is the dan ce of the mom ent. This \"sexual-s piritual-mixing\" makes each p a r tici p ant whole by rendering dualit y conscious. Thus, the male active principle is \"temper ed\" by the female passive power, giving him a deeper and wider perspective of life, and of course the female also acqui res the benef it of expansion from the addi­ tion of the \"male\" quali ties. The feminizat ion of the mascu line and the masculization of the feminine creates a sweetness and tenderness beyond mere descri ption, without losing clarity and strength. This results from the Melti ng process. As melt down takes places the win­ dow of the Divin e is Open ed. The \"new\" being who arises from these pract ices also possesses great powers of healing, whet her in the practic e of medicine, psychotherapy, or the laying on of hands. It has been long known that the best healers possess the strength and integrat ed quali ties of bot h sexes . (This is why Jesus and others are so often portrayed as epicene.) Here, at last, is a method which makes thi s a living reality. Throug h long preparation and intense pract ice the forces of power which arise from below allow the aspirant to know her /his true nature. The focus of ide ntity reformulat es itself from those received by culture and training, to those more Primal (the original Sparks of Exist ence). These acts of conse­ cration give the aspirant direct access to the mysteries of life which have been clouded by illusions and form.

Many secret religious orders had as their foundat ion the practice of sacred sexual acts. However, many of them, includ­ ing the Golden Dawn, disguis ed these pract ices for obvious reasons (fear of the church and state) - or, whic h is more likely, had forgotten that they even existed. Many proponents of the Golde n Dawn and related tradi­ tions, like Waite and Felkins, were so \"Christianized\" that they were even sex negative, attempting to live the life of the Puritan and of course influenc i ng modern occultism in an ascetic direction.

Th is is why Dr. Regardie felt that Reich 's therapy was the best t herapy for the aspiring stude nt. However, he knew that while Reich's therapy would lead to a form of orgastic potency, it would never lea d to true enlightenment.

Most early phases of Western civilization (to 19 60) showed lit tle care for the nature and nurture of female sexuality. This is in stark contra st to the ancient female mystery cults wher e female sexual enjoyment was param ount, and in some cases men were \"used\" as sexual objects, much as women have been used more recently. The male religions as well as most of their secret orders have persisted in punis hing the female for the knowle dge and power she possessed regarding the sublime use of psycho­ sexual po wers . She has always been closer to this truth than her patriarchal male count er parts. They not only feared her knowledg e but her sexual abilities. Thus they created the imag e (and partial reality) that females were primaril y \"uninterested in sex.\" In terms of sexual capability the male is signi ficantly weaker.

Each choice often mean s th a t so m ethi n g else must be de l egated to another time; thus humans are known as a ti m e binding speci e s in conflict. Another function of DELAY is that it stimulates the brain to begin the process of association and network building.

In t hi s sense their future does not determ ine their present. Man 's g oa ls , wishes and fu ture can determine his pr esent. The cortex can n ot only determine the WAY somet hing from the lower brains is expressed, but wize n as well. As we app r o a c h man on the \" ev o l ut i o nary scale\" we find that the abilit y to delay an action for long p eri od s of time help sepa­ ra te him from his more ancient predecessors . DELAY is the si ne qua non of the newer brain. Inhibit ion o f desires, drives or wishes gives us the ability to choose and to create civilization.

PAL EO-PSY CHOLOG Y The creative conflict for man thus is the r e lat i o nship between his various brain s, each with its own reality formula, and in some cases each with its own desir es, goals and futures. W hen there a r e vast differences in reality formulas, there are also communicatio n gaps. The lower brains and the cortex do not communicat e as well as some of us believe or wish. Many times the plans of the cortex are sabotaged by the needs and realities of the older brains, and vice-versa . In fact, the amount of intervention the new brain can have on the older one is often q ui t e minimal. Y og a is one of the few ways the Newer brain can control and mod ulate the Older brains successfull y; however Yoga alo ne does not know of the reverse . It does not in most instances know how to use the crea tive forces of the Older brain to enhance the New brain . In other words, a simple world of Yogins would proba bly not lead to high tech or high art which are creations of New brain interactions . Control and Delay as we know them are not enough for creative brain function. Vitalit y is also required. All values are the expression o f the reality tunnels of each of the brains.

A significant learning occurs in the areas of love, devotion and visualizat ion, making life rich and elegant. The practice of Western Tantra is the most sophist icated form of Loving, the most enduring and the most meaningf ul. It doesn 't cut man off from himself, sacrif icing one part for the other. Instead it opens vast channels of commun ication. The brains grow together, learning to trust each other. Through trust, the brains provide gifts of unimagin able power and joy, someth ing which most of us desire but have no idea of how to obtain except through exploitation.

Not only was this Kund alini type experience a surprise, but the vision was even more sho cking, since I was raised as a Jew, and had adopt ed a Taoist -Bud dhist orientation as an adult . On awak ening I thought about the vision for a few moments and began my daily obliga tions . I was haunted by this visio n from time to time over the years until I realized that one importa nt part of its meaning was that \"Tim e Was Up.\" What \"time\" was the vision communicating? First the time was up for Christ as a western God- head and a carrier of the image of Self. The notion of the suffering male God was coming to an end. The idea that the human race was desig ned to function as a slave race for God and His Son was e n di ng . What was emerging was the Godde ss, someone who had served the Male God, but now was accepting the mantle of power symbolized by Time and the Watch itself. The watch is frequently used as a symbol of adult hood for males who are about to be ba r mi tzv ah 'd or married . Secon d, the notion of Time itself is a powerful invention of the human mind, having great effect on how a race or culture perceives itself. There are notions of circular tim e, linear time, periodic time, etc. The Ch r i sti an notion of time is itself epoch based , with clear divisions of stages and event s leading to Christ's retur n and mastery of the world. In my vision Christ lost His watch, His way of know i ng what time it was. Instead the Nun, His servant, took the watch. She now was the Time Keeper, and since she did not put the watch on in my vision but held it, t h i s indicates to me that the notion of Time itself would c hang e with the Watch Guard of the Universe . As many of us a r e awar e, a C h a ng i ng of The Guar d - The Ruling God(de ss) - has been taking place for some time and is accelerating.

THE UNRED EEMED VIRGIN The notion of the unredeemed Vi rgin giving birth to the So n of the Father in order for mankind to be redeemed has cer t a in resona nce with Male domina nce. Why is the Son redee m ed and the Virgin left unredeemed ? Part of the answer lies in Western man's rejection of his Uncons cious and his emotio nal ­ animal nature. The reader must be reminded that the Son and the D au gh ter a re co-eq ual s. Western psychology and religion, while acknowledging the Unco nscious and the Virgin, plac e her second to the Son (\"every father want s a son\"), The Vir g in is body and emotion and the Son is Consciousness, and Reason (the Idol of the Middle Class) . Acco rding to Kabbalist ic theory, when the Son and the Daughter Marry, they alche m i cally are transformed into the Mother (Binah-Understan ding) and Father (Chokmah­ Wisdom) . When this Union is finalized the pair are no longer separate and are absorbed back into Kether, the Undi fferentiated Mona d, or Sahasrara, the lotus of a thousa nd petals. However, Kether is a word which refers to something which can not be known by reason, and is only f o u n d by expe rienc e . It is t he fi rst Poi nt. S o m e thin g b e y on d t h i s p o i n t is called Ain, Ain Soph, Ain Soph Aur, or s i m p l y Nuit. These terms are used to i mply something beyond Kether, s o m et hi ng like Infinite Space .

Christ appear ed enorm ous on His Cross. The Nun was on her knees and normal in size. The disparit y is obvious, however, it suggests that when one is la rger than life more is expect ed. Have Christ and His Father fallen dow n on the job? Have they shown their \"hum an-ness \" by their failure to care for Man? Has God Himself crushed His own Watch? The associ ation I get from this is that Christ must not pull the Female up to His Stature, nor must the Fema le pull Him down to Hers . What must be done is that Christ must get off his Cross and She must go toward His Cross. Only by this mutual meeting can the New Aeon be brought in. (Dr. Spieg elman has written an int eresting story on this topic, in Ca tholici sm and Jungian Psych olo gy, Falcon Press, 1988). Typically in our culture the woman 's movement has trie d to pull man \"down\" in the process of pulling woman up; and the males who are pro-G odde ss have attempted to force the female \"up\" to male stature . Both attitudes are in error. The best help a male can give the buddi ng Goddess is to move toward her with an open hand , and the best move for the Goddess is to get up off her own knees and move toward him. Some times a push in either direction is necessary but that should be enough . If help is too lop-sided for too long, the goal of Co- E q uals with the GOD(D ESS) as the third is not accom plished .

This idea is similar to the p r in c i pl e of the He xagr am - an ancien t Hindu symbol of Tantra, which reverses the mean ing of the two triangles making up the Hebrew Hexagram some­ times called the Star of David. The \"lower\" Triangle of the Hexagram the female principle, reaches up, and the \"higher\" Triangle, the male princi ple reaches down. Their mutual desire is Union, and each must be willing to leave somethin g behind for the sake of that Union . Each must give up an aspect of personal power, authority and helplessness for the Divine Marriage to take place. The fact that in this int erpretation God is Reaching \"Down\" and His Bride is Reaching \"Up\" still contains certain aspect s of Male dominance. Howe ver, the God of this Aeon, particularly in the West is Male; thus He has been in the superi or position. He is now awar e that this posi­ tion has to be voluntarily surrendered, and is making His move. The Female on the other hand is surrendering Her \"lower\" position as well - both for the sake of Union. Aspect s of this model are simil ar to the psycho-s piritual helping relationship and the parent-ch ild relationsh ip. The therapist at the right time must leave his chair will­ ingly , without being dethroned by the patient. The patient must leave her chair willingly without being pulled out by the therapist.

The purp ose of Reich 's therapy was to h elp t he pat i e n t reach \"orgastic potency\" a sort of whole mind /body orgasm . Reich differentiated this from ejaculatory potency, or th e simp le ability to have orgasm. He believed that orgastic potency was the norm and ci vilizat ion bred \"it\" out of man. He embraced Freud's original definition of \"actual neuros is\" as energy blockage due to sexual frustration. For Reich, however , sexual frustra tion was the inability to be orga stically potent. Thus in his therapy, a combinat ion of verbal character analy sis and body \"work\" was designed to help the \"neurotic\" reach orgas­ tic pot ency and becom e tru ly \"n ormal .\" Reich also believed in a univer sal energy he called \"Orgone \". He attemp ted to demon strate its existence scie ntifi­ call y, but in my opinion failed at this. He explain ed the worl d's refusa l to accept his theory as resulting from post­ Christ ian humani ty's pathological defense (armor ing) against the FEAR which orgastic potency evoked. Reich had great contempt for mystici sm, religion, etc., and felt that they only existed becau se man could not reach full orga sm. He also had certain notions of a bonding with the Universe, although this was discussed and often disguised t hr o ugh the notion of Or g o n e .

It was not until I met Regardie that he again began to en ter­ tain this idea consci ously.

The Lion was often a symbol associated wit h imag es of the Great Goddess, such as Astarte, Cybele, Ishtar and Hathor, all of whom rode or drove lions and often appear ed in the f o r m of a lioness or lion-headed female. Her many nam es have been associated with both Power and the practice of Tantra . (Look at the Strength Card in the Tarot. Why does it appear that a female is contr olling the Jaws of the Lion?) The Goddesses of the Lion were law giver s, crea tors of cities, the mothers of both the Gods and men, t he fierc e destroyers of obsolet e civilizat ions and th e human race. It has been noted that in a conversat ion with Ra, She replied to h is request to stop slaying mankind by saying, \"W hen I slay men my heart rejoices.\". However , through Her grace man was also allowed to learn about the natur e of the Gods. 2 The West borrowed her power and force and of cours e attributed it to such im ages as King Richar d the Lion Heart e d, King Ar thur and many others. -- -·-· ··- ·--·---- -- ---- -- · ·---- -·- -··- - -- -- 1 Imag e making is always interesting, as it requir es rejec ting ce r tain qua lities, whil e emphasi zing others .

The best I can make of the idea of White is that it represen ts an idea which is di fficult to convey by words and concepts. White light is undifferent iated. It is the origin, as the Tree of Life intimates, of the completely unknowable q ualities of Nuit - \"Infinite Space and the Infinite Stars thereof\" - mani fested in Kether, the highest light on the Tree, t h e first point of reference with which man can e v en begin to cope. The development of OWL as a living Order will emerge after the major thrust of the feminist movement \"failed.\" The origina l Wom en's Liberation movement was supposed to be the basis of the re-emergence of the fe minine as a powerful force in the univer se; however it was deeply contaminat ed by the purit anical and cantankerous influence of the Male Gods, no doubt a contribu ting factor in its failure. First, the psychology of the patriarchal identification of the feminine has to be altered. This means that the feminine can not find its t rue roots by imitating western patriarchal con­ sciousness. As many will note, what woman wanted she didn't get. The stone tablets of Moses cracked just enough to encir cle her in the charms and trapp ings of the paternal system.

The Order will estab lish fellowships of older males and females (brothers and sisters) which will be conce rned with practicing the ancien t arts.

The above myth of such an Order is an ancient one; howe ver, it is only now in the latter part of the 20th century, that wom en have enough appar ent freedom to underta ke such a difficult and prof ound journey . 1 1 As the reader will observe, the OWL is not a Christian Order, nor was the Golden Dawn. One attribute amo ng many others of the Golden Dawn which gives the whol e show away is the equality between male and female adepts. The pract ice of Tantra was never directly men tioned in classic Golden Dawn texts although there are numerous sex-neg ative referen ces. This is due to the fact that the original teach ings fell into the hands of the Chris tians as well into other hands who disguised its real meaning to prot ect it from the j e a l o u s and dang erous Chur ch. The new Golde n Dawn which is now emerging no longer has to disgui se its real purposes or its assoc iation with the Knights Templar , the Illumi nati and other Tantric grou ps.

Some of these males may at present be consider ed \"failures\" them selves, but in the new Aeon they will utilize what the y learned about the true nature of the system. JAMES BON D & THE ELITIST FEMALE We find the elitist female myth exploit ed in numerous James Bond stories, wher e superior wom en are both adversar ies and helpers of Bond . As usual, they submit to his superior male powers and thus fall from th eir throne . In other words, it was the female's devotional quality which was exploit ed and which caused her to fall and becom e the slave of man. This is intent i onal since loving loyalty is the quality that the patri­ archy most fears about wom en. Why might this be? One of the worst threa ts to any patriar c hal system occurs when compe­ tency and power are joine d with commitmen t and loyalty. Wit h these \" virt u es\" alone empires have toppled. Ian Fleming was no fool however, since he did have the vision which broug ht to mass conscio usness the strength and power of the female life force. BEYOND MA TRI ARCHY The Order of the White Lion will have more in mind than to simply return to a Matriar chal view of the Universe. Its goal is the transcen dence of the sex differences as we know them. The secret meaning behind this is now being revealed in subtle and various ways and may be enhanced by the practices presented in the Tantric section of this book . \"innocence and blood\" whe n in fact it was the emb lem of the \"Ass assins\" (a mispron unciatio n of the Saracenic brotherhood of hash ishi m, the \"hashish-ta kers\"), the forerunner of the Kni g hts Tem p lar.

To my know ledge, the Order has not made an overt appeara nce. Nor do I know of any organi zations with t he financial base and Will to bring such an Order into existence. However , I have met many males in recent years who hav e indirectly and unconsciou sly suppor ted OWL, altho ugh their support has been somewhat masoch istic and ignoble and frequently filled with sacch arin male hysteria (Christian Ideals and sex-deni al mixing with Pagan Lust) and empt y cliches. Here again , most of these males, while trying to help the Goddess re-emerge, are terrified of the depths of her Psyche and spend a good deal of time suppr essing its manif estations. Some of these types have sought me out. However, once I treat them to the dark side of their own image they prompt ly cast me in the role of devil and continue on in their hysterical ways . From time to time a few try to hold on but generally their fear prevents them from doing any real work . In addit ion to working with the Feminine Force, the Order is to work with reject ed children in a way never before attempte d on this plane t. Rather than helping them live boring a n d hum-drum lives they will be taught to live super ior lives. Again, to my knowled ge, this has not yet been achie ved or even advertised. Once the Order has plant ed its seed it will disappear, as it will be of no further use. This will happe n some time between 2090 and 2150. This entire scenario is based on the assum ption that the West ern World will exper ience numerous, great upheavals.

Unfortunat ely, the way that this has been taught has been both foolish and destruc tive. The Gnost ics and Manic heans, for instance , rejected Earth but forgot our ALIEN heritage. They gradually rejected the whole Univer se ... and the Chris­ tians copied them . The secret of Transcenden ce is not negation nor is it affir­ mation . It is si m p ly an act of POWER Concentration without placing a mora l value on what is transcend ed. Restated simply, it does not matter whether you transc end eating habits, sexual habits, drug habits, clothes habi ts, or the way you open a door. What matters is that you transcend ­ pause before reacting mechanically - and by repetitive acts of transcendence, consci ousness becom es transformed . You can s ee why indulg ence as a hedonic notion, and abstinence as a Christian notion, and comp ulsio n as a P s y chological notion , have no place in Transc endence, except as Tech nique. Additional ly, transcen dence cannot be reduced to secret messages from the Psyche, secret orders, drug related experi­ ences etc. It demands WOR K. Everything else is simply information, the lowest form of knowled ge. Without trans cendence p ermea ting the Ego and the Psyche, very little will be accomplished. In other words, it is time to stop tal k ing about Gods, mes­ sages, channels, etc. and time to act like the Gods/G oddesses we are. It is time to stop waiting and wo ndering and it is time to start acting and doing . Incidentally the proof that we are aliens is very simple. There is not hing like us upon the planet eart h - nothing at all. We are the definers of what we can be. This is the difference between Joe Smith and Rover, his dog. Rover cannot change itself at will into someth ing different. Joe can. We Aliens can even transcend the habit of death and s tupidit y if we put our efforts into it.

This is accom plished by using your imaginat ion, dis-iden ti­ fying with your conflicts and by doing. Don't Re-Act mechan ­ ically like an animal. Act creatively, like an alien. What if the Order as revea led to me is only fiction and t h e whim of an old wom an's mind, support ed by myself an d others for our own need to manif est our True Will? There is no way to answer the question of legitimacy. Th e Catholic Church had a nightmare and made it come true. So, do e.s that prove the legitimacy of the Catholic nightm are? I do not think so. What it does prove is that validity cannot be proven by simple existenc e over time. Hitle r's nightm are came true also. What we do know is that if the potential is there and if enough power and f orce is placed behind that potential then almost anything can come true. This meth od has little or nothing to do with our primitive notions of morality, belief or faith. What it does prove is that power works. The future exists first in Fantasy, then in Will , and finally, in Reality. The Tantric methods and techn iques which follow were n o t give n to me by the old lady referred to above.

Western Tantra focuses on relea sing Kunda lini. It us es the Tarot, the symbols of the Tree of Lif e, B io - en e r ge tic techniques and the Chakras to help aspirant s obtain the pure essence of both Magick (Power) and Mysticism (Love). Note: Magick and Mysticism (or Power a n d Love) are constructs which emb r a c e a false dichotomy which has been perpetra ted by t h e Christian ethos. This ph i l oso p h y teaches that power (activity and self-related pursuits) are necessaril y evil, while love (passivity and other-rel ated interests) are neces­ sarily good. This slavish philosophy, whose aim is to turn all men into sheep , is identi fied with God as \"Good Shepherd \"; but its emphasis is placed on the act of pleading as the funda­ mental form of worship and stands in stark contrast to the practices of Magic and Meditation which are based on Action and Will. Great Love is Great Power and Great Power is Great Love. Any force taken to its ultimat e transmu tes i t sel f into the All. THE TREE OF LIFE SYMBOLS The Tree of Life, a creation of the Kabbalists, is one of many useful models for gainin g insight and intuitive awareness of how Tantra works . It was from my work with the Tree of Life and Sexual Magick that this system evolved and so I have a special place in my heart for t h is model. However, if you find this model difficult or cumbersom e, feel free to use the Eastern 59"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"60 Christopher S. Hyatt, Ph . D. model for meditation and association. Better yet, use both. (The reader who is unfam iliar with the Tree of Life is referred to the appendix of this book.). THE FORMULA Kether is the Point, or Crown. Chokmah is the Father Princip le. Connecting the two is a straight line, which being one­ dimensional cannot encompass space. Adding Binah , the Great Productive Mother, a Triangle is created which metaphorically encom passes space. This \"lower\" triangle with the point yearning for \"heaven\" is the symbol of the female force which is said to govern the earth, while desiring union with \"higher\" forces. The triangle pointed downward is the male force yearning for union with the female force. (Note: In the Tantric hexa gram th� down­ ward point ing triangle rep resents the female or Yon � and the upward pointing triangle, the male Lingam). When the trian­ gles meet as they do in the so-ca lled Star of David, we have Union of the two forces. The six rayed star was first a symbol of ancient Tantra before it became a symbol of the Jewish people. Interestingly enough, the lower Triangle can be seen as the Shekinah (the female count erpart of Jehov ah), and the upper Triangle can be seen as Jehovah. Eac� are yearning for Union which symbolically takes place on the Jewish Sabbath. Another important aspect of this symbol is that when the two triangles join, a hexagram is formed that has a seventh point which is in the center of both. This is referred to as the Heart of Union, where the male and female energies mix and coalesce with the forces of the Godd ess. In Tantra, each act alwa y s includes the emanatin g force o f Kether, th e Cr own of the Tree of Life. Therefore in the practic e of Wes tern Ta ntra , a God-form is al ways included, bringing the p ar t i ci p a n t s to Three - the man, the woman and the Deity . Thus in Tantr a we can say that the relations hip is not only gv vt>rn t>d by the Godde ss but also includ es Her.

In the Tantric tradition the triangle re p rese nts the Kali Yantra or Primordial Image - the Triangle of Life. Accord ing to orien tal sages, \"T he object of the worship of the Yantra is to attain u ni t y wit h the Mother of the Univer se in Her forms as Mind, Life and Matter . .. \" As we des c en d the Tree from Kether, the Mona d, to Chokma h, the Father, we find that Binah, the Great Mother Principle is the Third point of emanatio n. The new energy brought into the relationship is neither the Father nor the Mother but Kether. This is the essent ial point of energy which is either forgotten or never emp l oyed in the ordinar y ac t of sexual intercourse. The process of Tantric intercourse is symbolized by WHI TE LIG HT. Once again, I cannot adeq uately empha size that the precep ts of Christ ian mora lity have nothing to do with the phen om e n a of WHITE LIGHT. You would do better to think of it as an Ato m Bom b, or LSD, hi t t i ng your brain with a stick. Although Kether is the first Sephirot h on the Kabb alistic Tree of Life, for the sake of reference in the pract ice of Tantra we include it as the third symbolic participant in the act. This concept is introduced and included here, since God-Form s are typically left out of ordinary sexual practic es. As to the subject of \"O ccult Eugenics\", a statement of its importan ce is proper here. Essentially, this study and practice conce rns itself with the creation proper of the Magickal Child. This is rarely practiced , of course, as is evidenced by the paucity of real \"Mag icians \" as well as true genius, great art, intentional work, etc. The practice of Western Tantra brings the energy up from Malkuth to Kether. As you devel op your practice, you bring Kethe r back d own to Malkut h, finally \"mixin g\" both in Tipha­ reth. This form of Intercou rse is intentional and conscious. Unlik e its ordinary counterp art, Tantric Intercourse creates a different type of energy which \"feeds\" the Universe. Noting the Tree again, the Son of the Parents, Chokmah and Binah, when filled with the power of Kether, is Tiphar eth."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"62 Christopher S. H y att, P h .D. The daught er is Malkut h. Of cours e this is symb olic, simply a model to convey a deeper truth. In addit ion to the forces previo u sly mentioned the powers of the other Sephira must be genera te d to cr eate the desired effects. Tipha reth is frequently associated with the Heart Chakra . Malk uth is viewed as the Bride of Kether, manif ested in the world; her purity is the result of Ch okmah and Binah combin­ ing with Keth er. Thus the well-known Kabb alistic verse, \"Malkut h is in Kether, and Kether is in Malkuth, albeit diffe r­ ent in kind.\" (With reference to the Tarot then, we see that the Path between Kether, [the Crown] , and Tiphar eth, [the Heart Chakra ] is guarded by the High Priest ess.) The High Priestess guards the mysteries and is both the destroyer and creator of those who cross the Abyss. The practice of Occu lt Eugenics whether for the purpos e of creating a livin g phys ical entit y, or a spiri tual God-form, f u nctions by c o m bining the energy of Kether and Malk uth.

Thus it has been my task to discover what direction I really came from and in what direction I shall return. II (Hyatt discussi ng this issue with Israel Regard ie, 1983-8 4). Regardie repl ied: II In your case y o u even have a deeper quest. You didn't have to travel at all, they yanked you out of the belly. II I have decided t o empl oy the mar velous work of J. M a r v i n Spiegelman, Ph.D., on Kund alini and the Chakr as. The reason I have chosen his work is four-f old. First, he is a Zurich trained Jungian analyst and thus is fully q ualified to discuss the psycho logical aspects of Kundalini and the Chak ras, which helps give a Western perspective to an Eastern creation. Second, he, too, worked with the fa med Psycho-S piritual te acher, Dr. Israel Regardie in the area of Neo-Reichi an ther­ apy. This makes him uniquely q ualified to help the student understa nd the relationship between \"mind and body .\" Thirdly, I spent a n u m b e r of years in Jungian analy sis with Dr. Spie gel man and can pers onally attest to his under stand ing of the se rna tters . Fina lly, we ha ve kept up a r el a tio n s hi p for over twenty years in the areas of psycholo gy and myst icism (as well as an abidin g perso nal friend ship) and thus I can spe ak for his ded icatio n and underst anding of the top ic. Ac cord ing to Dr. Spieg elman, \"The c h a k r a s n1ay be de f in e d as 'subtle cen ters of ope ration in the b o d y of the Shaktis or Powers of the var ious Ta ttvas or Pr i n c i p l es ' (Avalo n).

Conscious ness is not a n organic c on c e p tio n but is itself primar y, or anteceden t. It is rather more correct to think o f the bo dy and its various centers as 'veiled ' expressions of consciousn ess. Indeed, as conscious­ ness g o e s from the abstract to the subtle to the concr ete, we see the in c r ea s i n gly veiled c on diti on of it, so that it can even appear as uncons cious n ess.

As he says, \"the purification of the body is necessary for the purification of the mind.\" I, however, do not dis ti n g uish between the body, the mind and consciousness, except f or re f erence sake and for effe ct, b y the use of metaphor. The sincere practice of W este rn Tantra creates the neces sary experi ence which sma shes all such illusions of opposites. Dr. Sp iegelman continues in his psychol ogical analysis of chakras \" ... Jung expressed it by s a yi n g that each chakra is a whole world. One might say that this means that a different type of consciou sness is being described for each of them ... When we go more deeply into the symbolism, we will see that whole world- views can be contained in each of them - indeed whole types of religious attitude. It is little wonder, then, that this ancien t tradition has been so long-lasting, and has had its impact on others religions as well.\" As one studies Dr. Spiegelm an's psychologica l descriptions he will begin to see how the student is transformed from being the automa tic food of the gods in the spiritual food chain , to one who deliberately sacrifices hims elf as he ascends the ladder. In our method of Ta ntra and Chakra working we also lose our obses sions with \"minene ss.\" This is not a moralist ic statem ent which contains the notion that \" one should be this or that\", but a pragmatic one.

The normal points of confl ict, discussion and morali zing of homo normalis are gone, yet they are never forgotten as the roots which have led to our own power of bliss . DEFINITI ONS & PSY CH OLOGICAL ASS OCIA TIONS OF THE CH AKRA S I have taken the position that Sahasrara is not a Chak ra in the usual sense of the term. I see it as a bridge from the symbolic head to somet hing beyond. In this sense, it is metaphoric al. While speci fic god-na mes and images can be ap plied to it, it is beyond all word definitions and can only be known through experience . In order to provide some sense of continuity with other systems I still assign aspects of Kether (the Crown) to it; however, I also assign the metaphor Ain (Dark-to- Light) as well. I believe that this helps create the feeling of beyo ndness. The Kabba listic associations to Hindu Chakr as are made for creative and associ ative purposes . Pleas e do not take the m literally, but simply as suggestive. While Dr. Regardie has also agreed from one point of view with the associa tions I have made, he a n d others have also used the following: Keth er: Sahasr ara Chakr a. Cho kmah: Ajna Chakr a.

The significance of these point s of transition will become c learer as the reader continues . You will note below that the final transition takes place betw een Ajna and Sahasrar a. The reason for the difference is simple . In the West ern Tradition there are three orders; the outer order, the inner order, and finally the Secret Invisible Order . The o uter order consist s of Malkut h, Yesod, Hod, and Netzach energi es. The inner order consi sts of Tiphareth, Geburah and Chesed . The Secret Order consist s of Binah, Chokmah and Kether . Each Order has a point of transition wher e conscious­ ness is suppo sed to change not only in quantit y but in qualit y. In the scheme above Dr. Regardie does not have a Chakra for Malk uth, the Bride. If the student prefers, she can view Malkut h as part of the Muladhar a Chakra . The reader will note that in describ ing the chakras I start with Sahasrara and move to Muladhar a . I have done this intentiona lly, as it attempts to demo nstrate our belief that Ajna and Sahasrara are wher e we norma lly live, but in fa c t the unenl ightened live only in Mulad hara.

It is beyond all opposi tes and moral codes - the origin of notions of Chaos and Order. Quoting Dr. Spieg elman again: \"When we come to the ultimate aim of the Kundalini Yog a endeavor, the place of fulfillment, Jun g is surprisi ngly laconic. Here is what he says: 'To speak abou t the lotus of the thousand petals, the Sahasrara center, is qui te superf luous because that is merely a philos ophical conc ept with no substance what ever for us; it is beyo nd any possi ble expe rience . In Ajna there is still the exper ience of the self that is appar ently different from the object, the God. But in Sahasrara it is not different. So the next conclus ion would be that there is no object, no God, there is noth­ ing but Brahman . There is no experi enc e because it is one, it is without a seco nd. It is dormant, it is not, and theref ore it is nirvana. This is an entirely philosophical concept, a mere logical conclusio n from the premises above . It is withou t practica l value for us. ' \"Thus speak s the Jung of 1932 , consis tent with his long­ held theory that without an ego it is pointless and ridicu­ lous to s p eak of exper ience . Self without ego is a mer e 'concep t.' One wonders how the Jung of twenty or thirty years later (he died in 1961) would have described this. One returns again to his dream of discover ing himse lf as a yogi n, med itating in a temple, with his ego as an object of the yogin 's dream. Would this have changed his view? It is hard to say, but one woul d gues s that he would then em­ phasize the p arado x i c a l natur e of the exper ience wher ein the ego is b o th tot all y relativiz ed and 'nothing, ' yet it is the 'all' which is fl oo d ed with Brahman and, therefore, 'ever y­ thin g.' But her e, in his psyc hological sen1inar , he is trying mi ghtily t o remain emp irical, concep tual, compar ative. \"Purnanand a, on the other hand, devo tes eight full verses to this cha kra which is b ey o n d all chakras, and his"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Se crets of Wes tern Ta ntra commen tator, Kalich arana, engages in n1any paragr aphs of distinc tion of names, conce pts, this and that, just as if he wer e giving us a specif ic recipe which can be fulfilled only in the presc ribed manner ... \" ... at Sahasrara, not only are there no longer any animals or elements, as was the case in Aj na , but now ther e is not even a conditio n of principles (tattvas), nor strictly speak­ i n g, any Shiva or Shakti.

All the letters are here, supr eme bliss, void, s upreme light, formlessness. The bliss here achieved is a consequence of Atman realized. Once fully here, further­ more, the yogin has no further need of rebirth and, if he does not die on the spot, he will not re-inc arnate when he does di e . \" The Final Transition 77 Ajna: Gross biophysic al association/locati on: between the eyeb row s.

The petals are reduced to only two, and there is no mandala, no animal, and no element. For Jung, when there is no animal there is no bodily reality; only psychic r ea lity exists. In short, the yogin now realizes himself as a psychic content of God. \"In the beginning, at Muladh ara, God, or Atman was dormant and the yogin (ego) was aware.

This is symbolized in the presenta tion of the original Lingam, once more, but now white. In Vishuddha, further more says Jung, psychic reality was opposed to physical reality . Here in Ajna, there is no longer any physical reality, only psyche obtains . \"In his final lecture (IV) of his series on Kund alini Yoga, Jung takes up what he considers to be a paradox betwee n the views of India and Hinduism and those of us in the West, particularly as this affects our understandi ng of Ajna. He does this by interp reting Sthula (which we have trans­ lated as the concrete or gross bod ily level) as the personal aspect of consciou sness, wher eas the Suksma (whi ch is generally translated as the subtle-bod y dim ension) is the supra-per sona l. Jung sugges ts that each chakra has a sthula or personal aspec t and a suksma or supr a-perso nal aspe ct. Mulad hara, for exampl e, is in the pel v i s but represents the world . We, in the West, think of our consciousness as in the head, at Ajna, but we live in Mul adhara, in earthly entan­ glemen ts and causali ties. We are also ident ified with conscious ness, and thus speak of 'sub-consciousnes s.' All this, how ever, is strictly from a sthula (perso nal) aspect. To look at things from a supra-p ersonal aspe ct is suksma. We begin in the head, it is true, but we do not remai n there . India and Kunda lini, on the other hand, do entirely the reverse. Indians begin with the suksma aspect , even in Sah a s r ar a , and conce ive of man from the top down. We think of ourselves in Ajna, but we live in Mulad hara . Here is the parad ox: \"From the sthula as p ect: Ind i a is in Muladhar a, we are in Ajna. \"F rom the su ksma as p ect: Ind i a is in Ajna, we are in Mula dh ara. \"We shall r et ur n to this differentiatio n, but now, as we discuss Aj n a , it is well for us to grasp this strange condit ion in which we 'think' with our heads but do not come to the im p ersonal aspect of ourselves, and the Indian does not so think, yet he is f u l l y awar e of the imper sonal aspect of hims elf."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Sec r ets of Wes tern Ta ntra \"All of this hinges on the fact that this chakr a is the seat of the Tattva of Manas, or the men tal faculties. This is stressed in the commentar y and also it is noted that there is an additi onal, minor chakr a, said to exist between Ajna and Sahasrara, also devot ed to mental aspe cts. Our whol e under standing of mind, in short, is what is at stake here. \"Aval on tells us that Ajna is called 'command ' because at this point, the Saddhaka rece ives comma nds directly from the inner Gur u, from above, in both the 'man as' minor chak ras, and from the Sahasrar a itself. All else recedes and loses signi ficance . There are only two petals of the lotus now, and all the letters of the previous petals are exhau sted. The mant ra, now, is om, the ulti mate, and fire, sun and moon conver ge. Here the Atman shines lustrous like a flame, and the yogi gains the final siddhis (powers) which permit him, at his death, to volun tarily put his prana at this spot and enter Purusha directly, needing no longer to re­ inca rnate. \"The Goddess here is ' ... like the moon ( b eautifully whit e).' \" ... 'The excellent Yogi at the time of death joyfully places his vital breath (Prana) here and enters, (after deat h) that Supr eme, Eternal, Birthless, Primeval Deva, the Purus ha, who was before the three worlds and who is known by the Ved anta .' \"When all of this is accomp lished, we learn ... that the yogi will then see, above the Ajna Chakra, the form of the Mahanand a, and will mak e manif est pure Intel ligence (Buddhi ).

It is at a level of abstr action, there­ fore, which goes beyond the empirical world . The evoluti on of the yogin's work, then, has him move up from the gross matt er and earth of Mulad hara, all the way throug h the five elements, now including the final one of ether. This ancient idea of transfor mation is also found in alchem y, says Jung, and hinges on a kind of cooking process . Manipura, with its 'handles' resemb les a pot, which is like the cooking process found in the 'kitchen ' of the stomach, the region wher e that chakra is loca ted. If Manipura is the center of transforma­ tion, via the emotio ns, then Anahata, which is the place of transfor mation and is invisi ble, provides the psychic foun­ dation which is fully realized, at last, in Vish uddha, the region of psychological reali ty. \" J u ng thinks that civili zation as a whole has reached Anahata - our center is no longer in the d i a p hr a g m as it was with the Greeks. Despite this grow th, howe ver, we have not yet reached Vishuddh a, with its conc e ptio n of the world as a psyc hic reality. On ly here can one grasp the Purus h a , dimly felt in Anaha ta, in which the e s sence of man is seen as a subjective condition . Jung thinks that when the abstract ideas of modern phys i cs and of a n aly t i cal psychology are gene rally compr ehend ed, then civiliz ation will have reache d this level of under standing. \" [Note by Dr. Hyatt: I can onl y agree with Jung if we view his statement in terms of a mountain with a broad base and a narrow tip. From my point of view only the noti on of Anahata is contained in our present develop ment; the rea liza tion of Anaha ta is only reflected by a very few individuals. The fact that only a f e w indiv iduals have reached this point should no t necessarily reflect on civiliza tion as a whole . From m y persp ective, civilization still o p e r ates at Muladhara, while believing it is opera ting at least at Ajn a . For me, this di sparity does not imply aspiration excep t for a few, and is in fact the 'cause' of much pain and misery.] ''There is, th en , a g r e a t gap between the achievements of Anahata and Vishuddha.

Or, to see it in another way, the wor ld is a reflec tion of the psyche . \"This progression of the development in psychic reality, says Jung, can be seen by the changes in the animals which belong to each chakra. The elepha nt, like the horse, is, at Muladha ra, both the instinctual urge which supports con­ scious ness, and the cultiva tion of the will to enlarge it. The Makara, or Leviathan at Svadhist hana is the strongest animal in the water, just as the elep hant is on the land. These two, in Jung's o p inion, are really the same animal ... \" As we continue up the scale, we come to the ram of Manipur a, the animal of fire and passion. Here sacri fice is central, we g ive up being mere slaves to our passio n s and desir es. The result is to be found in the animal of Anahat a, t he g azelle or antelope. This animal is lik e the ram, but i s not domestica ted nor is it sacrificed. It is fleet and shy, light as air, and h a s lost the heaviness of ear th .

There will be 22 Tantric intercourse sessions spread over six months to one year depending on time, availabilit y and other person al considera tions. Speci al \"empower ed\" days such as the solstice and equin ox are ideal; however, other signif icant days such as birthdays are also excel lent for this practice. Incense, music, light and tasty food as well as small amounts of alcohol are important accomp anim ents. (Over the years I have found 3-4 ounces of wine, etc. to be useful in helping one to relax into this type of work). The sounds, lights, and smells will vivify and enh a nc e associa tions to the particular Trump card of the Major Arcana with which you are working . Case's book on the Tarot will provide the neces ­ sary intellect ual clues to help you along. Start wi th card #21, the World . Meditat e on its meaning for at least one day prior to your session and extract from it those symbo ls wh ich help you to add din1ension and meaning t o the card. ·O n the day of tht' session you and your partner sh ould dr ess in your special clothing (loose fitting garment s of soft, white cloth are preferable), and prepare the area using the syn1bols, fragrance, lighting, etc., that you have select ed to create the en vironment. Now, meditate on the Tarot s y m b o l for at least ten minut e s.

Both partners should lie down on the bed in the breathing position, tilting the pelvis forward on the inhalation and le tting it drop a nd saying 11 AH\" on the exhalat ion. This should be do ne for 15 minu tes. The coup le should then stimulate each other orally or by hand until they both feel ready for the genital embrace . Each session requires that the female sit on top of the supine male. (This is norma lly the easiest position for Western ers who have not becom e expert s in Yoga .) The female mounts the male; no movem ent is allowed unless the male's penis b e gi ns to lose its erection . During th is tim e each particip ant begins to breath deep ly as before. This shou ld continue for at least 10 minut es. The breathing should be synchro nized . The male and female energy should opera te as one compl ete unit. During this part of the encount er the couple should meditat e on the Tarot symbol (e.g., The World in the first session) or another symbol which both have agreed upon to represent the Tarot symbol in question. For exam ple, a couple might agree on the imag e of the Buddha when work ing with the Lovers card. Some find using a God Image to represent the meaning of the card to be more effective . Reme mber each Major Arcana Card symboliz es a living e nergy form. Now, movement may begin and each partner attempts to control orgasm for at least five minut es. As orgasm is abou t to be reached your attention should be switched to the Chakra being work ed with and at that time all sexual energy should be released. (See below for Chakra correspondences to the Major Arcana.) The essence of t he movement is as f o llows: T he female should first raise herself on th e exhalati o n, at this time the male should also slightly raise himself on the exhal ation.

After a few moments of this, w ith the female leading, she should b egin to reverse this process. That is, she should lower herse lf on the exhalation, and raise herself on the inhalation. The male should follow suit. The couple should contin ue thi s until they can no longer control their breathing and mov e­ ments. As they reach orgasm they should turn their attentio n to the Chakra in opera tion. (Do not become discouraged if you are somewhat spast ic and uncoo rdinat ed in attemp ting these exercises .) After this phase is complete, the coupl e should rest quietly for thirty minut es, meditating on their highest aspirat ions and the meaning of the Tarot Symbol. Each sessio n is governed by a different Tarot symbol an d Chakra . Start with the Worl d and move backwards thr o u gh the cards one by one ending with the Mage.

Remove them from the deck. You also know that the Chari ot, Death and the Moon, in t h e Major Arcana govern Cancer, Scorpio a n d Pisces, respectivel y. Remove the sym b o l which you desir e to manif es t. Now, say the year you choose to have a \" ma g icka l child \" is 1990. The year 1990 adds up to the number 10. This is the number for all of 1990. Say the sign is Cancer, which is t h e number 6 for the June part of Cancer or 7 for the July p a r t . For exam ple, 6 added to 10 e q ual s 16, which reduces to 7. If we us ed 7 for the July part of Cancer to 1 0 it would e q u a l 17 w h i ch woul d red uc e to 8.

This is more interesting when you consider that conception i s often more pleasura ble than the process of birth, and tha t during conception the forces of male and female energy ar e co-ope rative a nd highly charged.

T h e time prior to conception, concep tion, and the time f ollo w in g , exert the g reatest force upon the psycho-bio-spiritual forces mat e riali z ing in human form. By the practice of Tantric interco urse, meditation and ti m ­ ing, a hi g hly charged energy field is set up, wher eby proper concentra tion on the attributes of the desir ed entity (the Magi ckal Child) brings about the necessary force to incre a se the pro b a b i li ty of its mani festation. As you continue to study the methods, you can easily see how much concentra tion and energy you have put into the process. Not only do these methods help manif est the Magickal Child, they also chang e you and your partner's Psycho /bio/ spiritual nature.

DE ATH WATCH One o f the most important abilities to have when death is about to approach is the ability to focus the mind on a point and then empty oneself into it. As the adept can begin to see, the creation of a spiritual magickal child is the ideal vessel for this process. It simply parall els one purpose of havin g child ren - personal immort ality. The difference here is that t he spiritual Magickal Child does contain the reflective consciousness of your Self. As the couple becomes expert at creating magick al child ren, they become increasingly aware of multi-f aceted possibilities of which a peculiar form of immortality is but one.

If human b e in gs are spiritual beings, and t h e reb y not exclusively s ubj e c t to pur ely mechani­ ca l laws of h er e d it y, is there a spirit ual technique of eugeni cs as there is a p h y s i cal techni q ue observed by cattle br ee d er s ? To my k n o w led ge this question has not hitherto been r ai s ed . What do you think? Well, there are many point s of view.

Its arg um ent woul d run tha t if t w o people, prospecti ve p a r e nts, lead a pure an d h o l y life according to the lofty et h i c a l t e a ch i n gs and moral schemes laid down by Madam e H.P.

Here the e m ph a sis is laid on morals and ethi c s on the type of life led, rather than o n any series of e x e r c i s e s or me dita tions and p rac t i c e s to be p e r f o r m ed . The facts in the case are very helpf ul. Childr en of sincere The o soph i s t s and other occult students , as a rule, are not part icularly advan ced so far as concerns the especial ideals of occult ism. Very often t h e y are far less mystica lly inclined than their parents, to make but little mention of having far less practical ability and cap a c i ty than the child i s sui ng from non m y s t ic a l families. Of course, th e Th e o s o p hica l explanatio n in such a case would be the introduc tion of the Law of Karma . The parents and the c h il d have known each other in past i nca r n a ti o n s , and that t he r e are many ties - e mo ti o nal , menta l and physical - which have to be \"wo rked out,\" to use the cliche so often em ploy e d. Old debts on both sides of the ledg er have to be p a id . And since, often, the parents have n o direct conscious kn o wle dg e of the karmic stream behind them, and which motiv ates them, the y are there fore at the mercy of life itself or of karma (or t he Uncons cious) when fina lly t h e y decide to have ch ildr en .

INFINITE LOVE Briefly , there are three chapt ers attributed to the Egyptian gods Nuit, Hadit and Ra-Hoor-Kh uit respective ly. Nuit is infinite space. She is represent ed as the Goddess bend ing over like the arch of the night sky. She is the universe ultimately expan ded and her body contains all stars, galaxies and the sum total of possi bilities of every kind. If infinity is symbolized by a circle, Nuit is the circumf erence . Her divine lover, Hadit, is also infinite, but absol ute con traction. He is repre sented as a winged globe at the heart of Nuit. He is any point which has the experie nce of the possi bilities inherent in Nuit. He is the dot in the center of the circle. Here we have two infinites, one ultim at ely expan ded and large, one totally contracted and small. Now, if the circumfer­ ence is infinit e and the cen ter is infinite, they are both equally everywh ere! They are alway s in contact. They touch, they rub, t h ey embrace everyw here ... lovers on a truly cosmic scale. This interplay o f eterna l contraction and ex p ansio n of two opposing in finites creates finity. This finite fi eld of opera tion is the f o un d a ti o n of the phenom enal universe and is repre sented in The Book Of Th e La w by the God of the third chapter, Ra­ Hoor-K huit, the Crowned and Conq uering Child, The Lord of the present Aeon .

JASON BLA CK About two years ago I attended a concert performance of a major rock band at a beau tiful open- air amphit heater in Southern California. It was my birthday, and I had been party­ ing late the night before, with the not-unexpect ed result that I was more than a little ill when I arrived at the venue. As a result I was worried that the experience would be spoile d for me. Rather unusua lly, the band 's set began with a loud, long drum solo. This had the effect of causing a comp anion to plug his ears, but it threw me into a trance that continued to deepen as the music continued . When the solo ended, I came out of it to find a worried expres sion on my friend's face, and all my symp toms ­ nausea, heada che and sleepiness - completely vanished. When asked why the alarmed look, my friend told me that he had tried to talk to me severa l times during the interlude, and had gotten no response. He began to think that I was either drugged or seriously ill. I was able to en joy the entirety of the concert - and the eveni ng afterward - with renewed energy and a pervasi ve feeling of well-bei ng. This is one of the few exper iences I have had at such an affair which border on transcendent al.

Ph.D. religion, and yet there are Hindu and Buddhist Tantras with essenti ally similar techniques and goals . Many of the more heretical Sufi practices also seem to have a Tantrik or i g i n , but they avoid the label because the basic ideas behind Tantra are contrary to Islamic ideolog y, as they are to that of Judaism and Christianit y (in their accep ted forms at least) . Taoism, which has given us the I Ch ing and a concise form of sexual alchemy, is the oldest system to openly use Tantrik techniques, though the tech niques themselves go back to pre­ historic shaman ism, or to lost Atlantis, depending who you believe. My own experience at the concert described above was a classic example of mild but authentic shamanic healing, still an intrinsic part of Tibetan pract ice As this book has made clear, Tantrik techn iques consist of a combination of phys ical practices and magical or metaphysical assump tions about the world. The strong empha sis on human biology and instinct is what disting uishes Tantra most deeply from what many peop le think of as magic al tradition, and what removes it from religious tradition as well . This last is due to the fact that the princip le goal of Tantrik practice is (in modern terms ) to de-progra m the student from the inhibi tions, limita tions and beliefs instilled by parent, chu rch and state. This is not calculat ed to win appr oval from ort ho dox organi­ za tions whose m a i n function is social control. After this pr ocess of de-pr ogramming is well und er way, a program of new learning is begun, in which the st u d e n t ultimately seeks the develop ment of magical powers over the world and himself (here it differs from orthodox Buddhism) and to achieve the greatest degree of physical p er f e c t i on of which he is capable. In the Orient, this semi-se cret stratum of belief and practice appears in the arts and popular belief s in spite of official disappr oval.
