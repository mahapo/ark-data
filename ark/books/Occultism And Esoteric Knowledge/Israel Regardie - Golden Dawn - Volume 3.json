Preparation for Divinationby G. H. Frater Sub Spe 271THE RITUALOF THEPENTAGRAMThe Pentagram is a powerful symbol representing theoperation of the EternalSpirit and the Four Elementsunder the divine Presidency of the letters of theNameYeheshuah. The elements themselves in the symbol ofthe Cross are governed byYhvh, But the letter Shin,representing the Ruach Elohim, the Divine Spirit,be-ing added thereto, the Name becometh Yeheshuah orYehovashah — the latter whenthe letter Shin is placedbetween ruling Earth and the other three lettersofTetragrammaton.From each re-entering angle of the Pentagram, there-fore, issueth a ray,representing a radiation from theDivine. Therefore is it called the FlamingPentagram,or Star of Great Light, in affirmation of the forces ofDivine Light tobe found therein.Traced as a symbol of good, it should be placed withthe single point upward,representing the rule of theDivine Spirit. For if thou shouldst write it withthe twopoints upward, it is an evil symbol, affirming the empireof matter overthat Divine Spirit which should governit. See that thou doest it not.Yet, if there may arise an absolute necessity forworking or conversing with aSpirit of evil nature, andthat to retain him before thee without tormentinghim,thou hast to employ the symbol of the Pentagramreversed — (for, know thouwell, thou canst have noright to injure or hurt even evil Spirits to gratifycuri-osity or caprice) — in such a case, thou shalt hold theblade of thy MagicalSword upon the single lowest< 9 >point of the Pentagram, until such time as thou shaltlicense him to depart.Also, revile not evil spirits —but remember that the Archangel Michael ofwhomSt. Jude speaketh, when contending with Satan, durstnot bring a railingaccusation against him but said‘The Lord rebuke thee’.Now, if thou wilt draw the Pentagram to have bythee as a symbol, thou shalt makeit of the coloursalready taught, upon a black ground. There shall bethe sign ofthe Pentagram, the Wheel, the Lion, theEagle, the Ox. and the Man, and each hathan angleassigned unto it for dominion. Hence ariseth the Su-preme Ritual of thePentagram, according to the anglefrom which the Pentagram is traced. The circleorWheel answereth to the all-pervading Spirit: Thelaborious Ox is the symbol ofEarth; the Lion is thevehemence of Eire; the Eagle, the Water flying aloftaswith wings when she is vaporized by the force ofheat: the Man is the Air, subtleand thoughtful, pene-trating hidden things.At all times complete the circle of the place beforecommencing an invokation.The currents leading fromFire to Air and from Earth to Water are those ofSpirit— the mediation of the Active and Passive Elements.These two SpiritPentagrams should precede and closeInvokations as the equilibrium of theElements, andin establishing the harmony of their influence. In clos-ing, thesecurrents are reversed.Diagram iPicture #1 [images/img_0001.png]IHVHAirOro l bah Ao£piEarth tiADONAIEmor DialAriel CaiolO CLWaterHrei)ELOHIMO i pleaa It doc*TABLET OF UNION NAMESActive—Air ExarpPassive—Water .HcomaPassive—Earth ..NantaActive—Fire Bitom< 10 >Diagram 2SPIRITinvoking pentagramsPicture #2 [images/img_0002.png]Picture #3 [images/img_0003.png]Closing frorAcAtVGSAA txarp^N/\\ ftitomPicture #4 [images/img_0004.png]SPIRIT BANISHINGClosing -for\"PassivesPicture #5 [images/img_0005.png]HcorrmThey are the invoking and banishing Pentagramsof the Spirit; the Sigil of theWheel should be tracedin their centre. In the invoking Pentagram of Earththecurrent descendeth from the Spirit to the Earth.In the Banishing Pentagram, thecurrent is reversed.The Sigil of the Ox should be traced in the centre.These twoPentagrams are in general use for invokationor banishing, and their use is givento the Neophyteof the first Order of the Golden Dawn under the title oftheLesser Ritual of the Pentagram. This Lesser Ritualof the Pentagram is only ofuse in general and unim-portant invokations. Its use is permitted to theOuterthat Neophytes may have protection against opposingforces, and also thatthey may form some idea of howto attract and to come into communication withspir-itual and invisible things. The Banishing Pentagramof Earth will also servethee for a protection if thoutrace it in the Air between thee and anyopposingAstral force. In all cases of tracing a Pentagram, theangle should becarefully closed at the finishing point.< 11 >The invoking Pentagram of Air commenceth fromWater, and that of Water commencethfrom the Angleof Air. Those of Fire and Earth begin from the angleof Spirit. TheKerubic sign of the Element is to betraced in the centre. The banishing Signsare the re-versing of the current. But before all things, completethe circle ofthe place wherein thou workest, seeingthat it is the key of the rest. Unless youwant to limitor confine the force, make not a circle round each Pen-tagram,unless for the purpose of tracing the Penta-gram truly. In concentrating howeverthe force upona symbol or Talisman, thou shall make the circle withthe Pentagramupon it so as to gather the force to-gether thereon.< 12 >Diagram 5INVOKING EARTH ItANISHINGPicture #6 [images/img_0006.png]Rule: Invoke towards, and banish from, the pointto which the Element isattributed.Air hath a watery symbol because it is the con-tainer of rain and moisture. Firehath the form of theLion-Serpent SI. Water hath the alchemic Eagleofdistillation • Earth hath the laborious b. Spirit isproduced by the Oneoperating in all things.The elements vibrate between the Cardinal points forthey have not anunchangeable abode therein, thoughthey are allotted to the Four Quarters intheir invoka-tion in the Ceremonies of the First Order. This attri-bution isderived from the nature of the winds. Forthe Easterly wind is of the Nature ofAir more espe-cially. The South Wind bringetb into action the natureof Fire.West winds bring with them moisture andrain. North winds are cold and dry likeEarth. TheS. W. wind is violent and explosive — the mingling ofthe contraryelements of Fire and Water. The N. W.and S. W. winds are more harmonious,uniting theinfluence of the two active and passive elements.Yet their natural position in the Zodiac is: Fire inthe East, Earth in South,Air in West, and Water inthe North. Therefore they vibrate: Air between WestandEast. Fire between East and South. Water betweenNorth and West. Earth betweenSouth and North.Spirit also vibrateth between Height and Depth.So that, if thou invokest, it is better to look towardsthe position of thewinds, since the Earth, ever whirl-ing on her poles, is more subject to theirinfluence. Butif thou wilt go in the Spirit Vision unto their abode,it is betterfor thee to take their position in the Zodiac.Air and Water have much in common, and becauseone is the container of the other,therefore have theirsymbols been at all times transferred, and the Eagleassignedto Air and Aquarius to Water. Nevertheless,it is better that they should beattributed as beforestated and for the foregoing reason is it that the invok-ingsign of the one and the banishing sign of the othercounterchange in thePentagram.< 14 >When thou dealest with the Pentagram of the Spiritthou shalt give the salutingsign of the © — E Grade,and for the Earth the Sign of Zelator, and for Airthatof Theoricus, and for Water that of Practicus, and forFire, Philosophus.If thou wilt use the Pentagram to invoke or banishthe Zodiacal forces, thoushalt use the Pentagram ofthe Element unto which the Sign is referred, andtracein its centre the usual Sigil of the Sign thus:Fiery:invokingfor Aries.Diagram 4Picture #7 [images/img_0007.png]Watery:banishingfor Pisces.Picture #8 [images/img_0008.png]And whenever thou shalt trace a Sigil of any nature,thou must commence at theleft hand of the Sigil orsymbol following the course of the Sun.Whenever thou invokest the forces of the ZodiacalSigns as distinct from theElements, thou shalt erectan astrological scheme of the Heavens for the timeofworking so that thou mayest know toward what quar-ter or direction thoushouidst face in working. For thesame Sign may be in the East at one time of thedayand in the West at another.Whenever thou shalt prepare to commence any magi-cal work or operation, it willbe advisable for thee toclear and consecrate the place by performing theLesserBanishing Ritual of the Pentagram. In certain cases,especially whenworking by or with the forces of thePlanets, it may be wise also to use theLesser Banish-ing Ritual of the Hexagram.In order that a Force and a current and a colourand a sound may be unitedtogether in the same sym-bol, unto each angle of the Pentagram certain Hebrew< 15 >divine Names and Names from the Angelic Tablets areallotted. These are to bepronounced with the invokingand banishing Pentagrams so thou mayest see intheforegoing diagrams.The attributions of the angles of the Pentagram isthe key of its Ritual. Herein,during ordinary invok-ation without the use of the Tablets of the Elements,thoushalt pronounce the Divine Name A1 with thePentagram of Water, and Efohim withFire, etc. Butif thou art working with the Elemental or EnochianTablets, thoushalt use the Divine Names in the Angeliclanguage drawn therefrom. For Earth,Emor DialHectega, etc., and for Spirit the four words: Exarp inthe East; Hcomain the West: Nanta in the North:and Bitom in the South.In the pronunciation of all these Names, thou shalttake a deep breath andvibrate them as much as pos-sible inwardly with the outgoing breath, notnecessarilyloudly, but with vibration thus: A-a-a-el-il. Or —Em-or-r Di-a-11Hec-te-e-g-ah. If thou wilt, thou mayestalso trace the letters or Sigils ofthese Names in the Air.To invoke the forces of the Four Elements at once,at the Four Quarters, commenceat the East and theretrace the equilibrating Pentagram of the Actives andtheinvoking Pentagram of Air and pronounce theproper Names. Then carry round thepoint of thy wandto the South and there trace the equilibrating Penta-gram forActives and the invoking Pentagram of Fireand pronounce the proper Names.Thence, pass to theWest, trace the Equilibrating Pentagram for Passivesand theInvoking Pentagram for Water and pronouncethe proper Names; thence to the North,trace the equili-bration of the Passives and the invoking Pentagramof Earth,pronounce the proper Names, and then com-plete the circle of the place.In the same manner shalt thou banish, unless thoudesirest to retain certain ofthe Forces for a time. Allinvokations shall be opened and closed with theQaba-listic Sign of the Cross. In certain cases other Names,< i6>as those of Angels and Spirits, may be pronouncedtowards their proper quartersand their Names andSigils traced in the Air.If thou workest with but one Element, thou shaltmake— (if it be an activeelement as Fire or Air) —the equilibrating Pentagram for Actives only andtheElement’s own invoking Pentagram, and not those ofthe other Elements. If itbe a passive Element — Earthor Water —thou shalt make the EquilibratingPenta-gram of the passives only and the invoking Pentagramof the one Element atthe Four Quarters. In closingand banishing follow the same law. Also, see thatthoupronouncest the proper Names with the proper Pen-tagrams.< 17 >SUPREME INVOKING RITUALOF THEPENTAGRAMDiagram 5Picture #9 [images/img_0009.png]Picture #10 [images/img_0010.png]Carry Point to South—Picture #11 [images/img_0011.png]Picture #12 [images/img_0012.png]Face East.

The Hexagram is sometimes called theSignet orSymbol of the Macrocosm, just as the Penta-gram is called the Signet Star orSymbol of the Micro-cosm.Ararita is a divine name of Seven letters formed ofthe Hebrew initials of thesentence:“One is his beginning. One is his individuality. Hispermutation is one.”As in the case of the Pentagram, each re-enteringangle of the Hexagram issueth aray representing aradiation from the divine. Therefore it is called theFlamingHexagram, or the six-rayed Signet Star. Usu-ally, it is traced with the singlepoint uppermost. It isnot an evil symbol with the two points upward, andthis isa point of difference from the Pentagram.Now if thou dost draw the Hexagram to have bythee as a Symbol, thou shalt makeit in the coloursalready taught and upon a black ground. These arethe PlanetaryPowers allotted unto the Angles of theHexagram.(King Scale) (Queen Scale)Unto the uppermost T? . .Indigo BlackUnto the lowermost ■ Blue PuceUnto the right hand upper. .If. .Violet BlueUnto the right hand lower... $ . .Green GreenUnto the left hand upper.. .Red RedUnto the left hand lower. ... £ . .Yellow OrangeIn the centre is the fire of the Sun. .Orange.. .Golden< 20 >The order of attribution is that of the Sephiroth onthe Tree of Life. Henceariseth the Supreme Ritual ofthe Hexagram according to the Angles from whichitis traced.The uppermost angle answereth also to Daath and thelowest to Yesod, and theother angles to the remainingangles of the Microprosopus. The Hexagram iscom-posed of the two angles of Fire and Water, and is there-fore not traced inone continuous line like the Penta-gram, blit by each Triangle separately. Allthe invokingHexagrams follow the course of the Sun in their cur-rent, that isfrom left to right. But the banishing Hexa-grams are traced from right to leftfrom the same angleas their respective invoking Hexagrams contrary to thecourseof the Sun. The Hexagram of any particularPlanet is traced in two Triangles, thefirst starting fromthe angle of the Planet, the second opposite to thecom-mencing angle of the first. The Symbol of the Planetitself is then traced inthe centre. Thus in the case ofthe invoking Hexagrams of Saturn, the. firsttriangleis traced from the angle of Saturn, following the courseof the Sun, thesecond triangle from the angle of theMoon.(Only trace the central Planetary symbol in practice— the others are shown onlyfor illustration.)Diagram 6INVOKING hPicture #17 [images/img_0017.png]D\"nbn mn*BANISHING hBut the invoking Hexagram of the Moon is firsttraced from the angle of the Moon,its second anglebeing traced from the triangle of Saturn.The banishing Hexagram for Jupiter, for example,< 21 >is traced from the same angle as the invoking Hexa-gram, and in the same order,but reversing the current’sdirection. In all cases the Symbol of the Planetshouldbe traced in the centre.Diagram 7INVOKING BANISHINGPicture #18 [images/img_0018.png]Picture #19 [images/img_0019.png]< 22 >Diagram 8Invoking BanishingPicture #20 [images/img_0020.png]< 23 >Diagram gInvokingPicture #21 [images/img_0021.png]BanishingPicture #22 [images/img_0022.png]Picture #23 [images/img_0023.png]Picture #24 [images/img_0024.png]Six Invoking Hexag< 24 >Diagram ioInvokingPicture #25 [images/img_0025.png]BanishingPicture #26 [images/img_0026.png]*Picture #27 [images/img_0027.png]Picture #28 [images/img_0028.png]Six Banishing Hexagrams for Sol.< 25 >Hut for the Sun all six invoking Hexagrams of thePlanets should be traced intheir regular planetaryorder and the symbol O traced in the centre. And forhisbanishing hexagram also, all the six banishing hex-agrams of the other Planetsshould be employed in theirregular order, only that the symbol of the Sunshouldbe traced therein.Remember that the symbol of Luna varieth, andas 2) in her increase she isfavourable. But 2> is not sofavourable for good in her decrease. The symbolofLuna in the centre of the Hexagram should be traced2) if in her increase; by Cif in her decrease. Rememberthat C represents restriction and is not so goodasymbol as 2), and at the full Moon exactly it is 0> butat new Moon a darkcircle •.The last two forms of Luna are not good in manycases. If thou wilt invoke theForces of the Head ofthe Dragon of the Moon thou shalt trace the lunar in-vokingHexagram and write therein the symbol £3, andfor the tail S3, These Forces of £3and SS are moreeasy to be invoked when either the Sun or the Moonis with them inthe Zodiac in conjunction. In theseinvokations thou shalt pronounce the sameNamesand Letters as are given with the Lunar Hexagram,S3 is of a benevolentcharacter, and S3 of a malefic, savein a very few matters. And be thou well waryof dealingwith these forces of £3 and Q or with those of Sol andLuna during theperiod of an eclipse, for they are thePowers of an eclipse. For an eclipse totake place boththe Sun and Moon must be in conjunction with themin the Zodiac,these two luminaries being at the sametime either in conjunction or oppositionsas regardseach other.In all Rituals of the Hexagram as in those of thePentagram, thou shalt completethe circle of the place.Thou shalt not trace an external circle round eachHex-agram itself unless thou wishest to confine the forceto one place — as incharging a Symbol or Talisman.< 26 >From the attribution of the Planets, one to eachangle of the Hexagram, shaltthou see the reason of thesympathy existing between each superior planet andonecertain inferior Planet. That is, that to which itis exactly opposite in theHexagram. And for thisreason is it that the Triangle of their invokingandbanishing Hexagrams counter-change. The superiorPlanets are Saturn. Jupiter,Mars. The inferior Planetsarc Venus, Mercury, Luna. And in the midst isplacedthe Fire of the Sun. Therefore the superior Saturn andthe Inferior Lunaare sympathetic, so are Jupiter andMercury, Mars and Venus.In the Supreme Ritual of the Hexagram the Signsof the © — GO Grade are to begiven, but not those ofthe Grades of the First Order, notwithstandingtheselatter are made use of in the Supreme Ritual of thePentagram. And becausethe Hexagram is the SignetStar of the Macrocosm or Greater World, therefore isitto be employed in all invocations of the Forces ofthe Sephiroth: though theSignet Star of the Penta-gram represents their operation in the Luna World,inthe Elements and in Man.If thou wilt deal with the Forces of the SupernalTriad of the Sephiroth, thoushalt make use of theElexagrams of Saturn; for Chesed those of Jupiter,forGeburah those of Mars; for Tiphareth those of the Sun,and for Netzach thoseof Venus, and for Hod those ofMercury, and for Yesod and Malkuth those oftheMoon.Know also that the Sephiroth are not to be invokedon everv slight occasion, butonly with due care andsolemnity. Above all, the forces of Kether and Chok-mahdemand the greatest purity and solemnity of heartand mind in him who wouldpenetrate their mysteries.For such high knowledge is only to be obtained byhimwhose Genius can stand in the Presence of the HolyOnes. See that thou usestthe Divine Names with allreverence and humility for cursed is he that takeththeName of the Vast One in vain.<z7>When thou tracest the Symbol of a Planet in thecentre of a Hexagram, thou shaltmake the same of aproportionable size to the interior of the Hexagram,and thoushalt trace them from left to right generallyfollowing the course of the Sun asmuch as possible.Caput and Cauda Draconis may follow the general rule.When thou shalt invoke either the Forces of one par-ticular Planet or those ofthem all, thou shalt turnthyself towards the Quarter of the Zodiac wherethePlanet thou invokest then is. For owing both to theirconstant motion in theZodiac and to the daily move-ment of the same, the position of a Planet iscontinu-ally changing, and therefore it is necessary for thee insuch a case toerect an Astrological Figure or Schemeof the position of the Planets in theheavens for theactual time of working, so that thou mayest see thedirection ofeach Planet from thee. This is even morenecessary when working with the Planetsthan withthe signs of the Zodiac.When thou shalt desire to purify or consecrate anyplace, thou shalt perform theLesser Banishing Ritualof the Hexagram, either in conjunction with, or insteadofthat of the Pentagram, according to the circum-stances of the case. For example,if thou hast been work-ing on the plane of the Elements before, it will bewellto perform the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram beforeproceeding to work of aPlanetary nature, so as thor-oughly to clear the places of Forces which,althoughnot hostile or evil of themselves, wall yet not be in har-mony withthose of an altogether different Plane. Andever be sure that thou dost completethe circle of theplace wherein thou workest.THE FOUR FORMSThese are the four forms assumed by conjoining thetwo triangles of the Hexagramon which the LesserRitual of the Hexagram is based. The first form is:<28>Diagram 11Picture #29 [images/img_0029.png]The angles are attributed as in the diagram. Its affinityis with the EasternQuarter, the position of Fire in theZodiac. (Note: To form these from the usualHexa-gram, lower the inverted triangle, then reverse it bythrowing the Lunarangle up to top from being lowest.Mars and Jupiter do not change sides.)Diagram 12Picture #30 [images/img_0030.png]The second form is the ordinary Hexagram with theattribution of the angles asusual: the affinity beingrather with the Southern Quarter, the position ofEarthin the Zodiac, and of the Sun at his culmination at noon.< 29 >The third form is:ADiagram 135\\\\Picture #31 [images/img_0031.png]V//\\//\\ /The angles are attributed as shown and its affinityis with the Western Quarter,the position of Air in theZodiac.The fourth form is:Diagram 14Picture #32 [images/img_0032.png]\\ /Picture #33 [images/img_0033.png]The angles are attributed as shown and its affinityis with the Northern Quarter,the position of Waterin the Zodiac.With each of these forms the Name Ararita is to bepronounced — seven letters.< 30 >Also as in the preceding cases there will be sevenmodes of tracing each of thesefour forms, accordingto the particular Planet with those Forces thou artworkingat the time.1'he Hexagrams of Saturn may be used in generaland comparatively unimportantoperations, even as thePentagrams of Earth are used in the Lesser Ritual ofthePentagram. In these four forms of the Hexagramthou shalt trace them beginning atthe angle of thePlanet under whose regimen thou art working, follow-ing thecourse of the Sun to invoke, and reversing thecourse to banish. That is to say,working from left toright for the former and from right to left for thelatter.Remember always that the symbols of the Elementsare not usually traced onSigils but are replaced by theKerubic Emblems of Aquarius, Leo, Taurus andtheEagle head.< 3i >THE LESSER RITUALOF THEHEXAGRAMCommence with the Qabalistic Sign of the Cross asin the Lesser Ritual of thePentagram, and use whatmanner of Magical implement may be necessary ac-cordingto the manner of working, either the LotusWand or the Magical Sword.Stand facing East, If thou desirest to invoke thoushalt trace the figure thus:Diagram 15Picture #34 [images/img_0034.png]Following the course of the Sun, from left to rightand thou shalt pronounce thename Ararita, vibratingit as much as possible with thy breath and bringingthepoint of the Magical Implement to the centre ofthe figure.But if thou desirest to banish thou shalt trace it thus:Picture #35 [images/img_0035.png]From right to left, and see that thou closest carefullythe finishing angle ofeach triangle.<32>Carry thy magical implement round to the South,and if thou desirest to invoketrace the figure thus:Picture #36 [images/img_0036.png]But if to banish then from left to right thus:Picture #37 [images/img_0037.png]Bring as before the point of thy magical implementto the centre and pronouncethe Name Ararita,Pass to the West, and trace the figure for invokingthus:Picture #38 [images/img_0038.png]< 33 >Picture #39 [images/img_0039.png]Then to the North, Invoking:Picture #40 [images/img_0040.png]Banishing:h.V f\\ /Picture #41 [images/img_0041.png]< 34 >Then pass round again to the East so as to completethe circle of the placewherein thou standest, then givethe LVX signs and repeat the analysis of thePass-wordINRI of the © ~ 0 Grade.ADDENDUMNow in the Supreme Ritual of the Hexagram, whenthou shalt wish to attract inaddition to the forces ofa Planet, those of a Sign of the Zodiac wherein hethenis, thou shalt trace in the centre of the invoking Hexa-gram of the Planet,the Symbol of that Sign of theZodiac beneath his own; and if this be notsufficient,thou shalt also trace the invoking Pentagram of theSign as it isdirected in the ritual of the Pentagram.In the tracing of the Hexagram of any Planet thoushalt pronounce therewith in avibratory manner asbefore taught, both the Divine Name of the Sephirawhichruleth the Planet and the Seven-lettered NameArarita, and also the particularletter of that Namewhich is referred to that particular Planet.Now if thou shalt wish to invoke the forces of Oneparticular Planet, thou shaltfind in what Quarter ofthe heavens he will be situate at the time ofworking.Then thou shalt consecrate and guard the place whereinthou art by theLesser Banishing Ritual of the Hexa-gram. Then thou shalt perform the LesserInvokingRitual of the Hexagram, yet tracing the four figuresemployed from theangle of the Planet required, seeingthat for each Planet the mode of tracingvarieth. Ifthou dealest with the Sun, thou shalt invoke by all sixforms of theFigure and trace within them the PlanetSymbol and pronounce the Name Ararita ashas beentaught.Then shalt thou turn unto the quarter of the planetin the Heavens and shalttrace his invoking Hexagramand pronounce the proper Names, and invoke what< 35 >Angels and Forces of that Nature may be required,and trace their Sigils in theair.When thou hast finished thy invocation thou shaltin most cases license them todepart and perform theBanishing Ritual of the Planet which shall be thecon-verse of the invoking one. But in cases of charging aTablet or Symbol orTalisman, thou shalt not performthe Banishing Symbols upon it which would havetheeffect of entirely de-charging it and reducing it to thecondition it was inwhen first made — that is to saydead and lifeless.If thou wishest to bring the Rays of all or severalof the Planets into action atthe same time, thou shaltdiscover their quarter in the Heavens for the timeofworking, and thou shalt trace the general Lesser Invok-ing Ritual of theHexagram, but not differentiated forany particular Planet, and then thou shaltturn to theQuarters of the respective Planets and invoke theirForces as beforelaid down: and banish them when theinvocation is finished, and conclude with theLesserBanishing Ritual of the Hexagram. And ever rememberto complete the circleof the place wherein thou work-est, following the course of the sun.< 36 >DIAGRAMOF THELOTUS WANDDiagram 16Picture #42 [images/img_0042.png]WhiteRedRed-OrangeOrange||AmberYellowYellow-GreenEmeraldGreen-BlueBlueIndigoVioletCrimsonBlack: 1TfcSn©\"*sxxHV< 37 >Picture #43 [images/img_0043.png]Picture #44 [images/img_0044.png]Diagram 17Picture #45 [images/img_0045.png]Inmost Petals*10 in number.White both sides.6.Picture #46 [images/img_0046.png]Calyx, 4 Petals*Coloured orangePicture #47 [images/img_0047.png]d.Two whorls of 3 Petals* white inside and olivegreen outside, with $ veins shownon the greenPicture #48 [images/img_0048.png]< 38 >THELOTUS WANDThis is for general use in magical working.

The flower centre is orange or gold.The LotusWand should be from 24 to 40 inches long,and of wood about half an inch thick.The several bandsof white, 12 colours, and black may be painted or ena-melled,or formed of coloured papers pasted on.The length of colours should be such that the whiteis a little the longest, thenthe black, while the 12 col-ours are equal, and smaller than the black. Thecoloursmust be clear, brilliant and correct.They are as follows:White: Aries—red: Taurus—red-orange: Gemini—orange: Cancer—amber:Leo—lemon-yellow: Virgo—yellow-green: Libra—emerald:Scorpio—green-blue:Sagittarius—bright-blue: Capricornus—indigo:Aquar-ius—violet: Pisces—crimson: black.The Lotus flower may be made of sheet metal or cardboard, in 3 whorls of 8, 8,and io petals, white intern-ally and tips curved in a little, olive outside with5markings as shown in diagram. The centre is orange, ora brass bolt to keep alltogether will do.< 39 >As a general rule, use the white end in invocationand the black end to banish.The white end may beused to banish by tracing a banishing symbol againstan eviland opposing force which has resisted otherefforts. By this is meant that bywhatever band youare holding the Wand, whether white for spiritualthings, byblack for mundane, by blue for Sagitarriusor by red for fiery triplicity, youare, when invoking,to direct the white extremity to the quarter desired.Whenbanishing, to point the black end to that quarter.The Wand is never to be inverted, so that when verymaterial forces areconcerned, the black end may bethe most suitable for invokation, but with thegreatestcaution.In working on the plane of the Zodiac, hold the Wandby the Portion you refer tobetween the thumb andtwo fingers.If a Planetary working be required, hold the Wandby the Portion representing theday or night Houseof the Planet, or else by the Sign in which the Planetis atthe time.T?

Bear in mind that the Kerubic Emblem isthe most powerful action ofthe Element in the trip-licity. For example, Leo — Violent heat of summer.Aries— Beginning of warmth in spring. Sagittarius,waning of heat in autumn.<4° >Hold the Wand by the white portion for all Divineand Spiritual Matters or forthe Sephirotic influences,and for the process of rising in the Planes.Hold the Wand by the black part only for materialand mundane matters.The lo upper and inner Petals refer to the Purityof the Ten Sephiroth. Themiddle 8 refer to the coun-ter-charged natural and spiritual forces of Air andFire.The lowest and outer 8 refer to the powers of Earthand Water. The centreand amber portion refers tothe Spiritual Sun, while the outer calyx of 4orangesepals shows the action of the Sun upon the life ofthings bydifferentiation.The Wand should never be used inverted.The Lotus Flower is not to be touched in working,but in Sephirotic and SpiritualThings, the Flower isto be inclined towards the forehead; and to rise inthePlanes, the orange coloured centre is to be fully directedto the forehead.CONSECRATION OF THE LOTUS WAND1.

Aspire to the Light and draw it down over yourhead to your feet.Let the Divine Light Descend.(Note: For diagrams of these signs refer to pages 43and 44 of Volume II.—I.R.)THE USE OF THE ROSE CROSS RITUAL1. It encloses the aura with a protection againstoutside influences. It is likea veil. The Pentagramsprotect, but they also light up the astral andmakeentities aware of you. They are more positive for magi-cal working. Whenmuch distracted, use the Penta-grams to banish and the Rose-cross to maintainpeace.2. It is a call to another mode of your consciousnessand withdraws you from thephysical. It is a goodpreparation for meditation and, combined with theKey-Word,a form of invokation of the Higher Wisdom< 49 >which is helpful when solving problems or preparingfor a difficult interview, orin order to be calm andstrong to help another.3. When you are quite familiar with the Ritual, butmost certainly not before, itcan be done in imaginationwhile resting or lying down. Part of yourself goesout,and you get all the sensation of walking around yourown quiescent body. Usedthus, with rhythmic breath-ing, it will withdraw your mind from pain (if it benottoo severe) and release you for sleep. You can do theanalysis of the Key-Wordstanding behind your physi-cal head, and you can call down the Divine Whiteliril-liance, watching it flow over your body and smooth outthe tangles in theetheric double, bringing peace andrest.4. You can do the Ritual with intention to helpothers in pain or difficulty. Forthis purpose, you buildup an astral image of .the person, in the centre oftheroom, and call down the Light upon him, after sur-rounding him with the sixcrosses. When the ceremonyis done, command the astral shape you have madetoreturn to the person, bearing with it the peace ofYeheshuah.5. It is a protection against psychic invasion fromthe thoughts of others orfrom disturbed psychic condi-tions, such as there might be in a place chargedwithfear, where terrible things had happened.< 5° >THE COMPLETE SYMBOLOF THEROSE CROSSThis symbol is to be worn suspended from a yellowcollarette of silk, the mottoof owner placed on thereverse side, with white sash, and is for general useinMagical working, to be worn at all meetings of Adepts.It is to be made by each Adept alone, and conse-crated by himself and nevertouched by any other per-son; and wrapped in white silk or linen when not inuse.It is a complete synthesis of the Masculine, Positiveor Rainbow scale of Colourattributions, which is alsocalled “The Scale of the King.”The four ends of the Cross belong to the four Ele-ments, and are colouredaccordingly. The white por-tion belongs to the Holy Spirit and the Planets.The Twenty-two petals of the Rose refer to thetwenty-two Paths. It is the Crossin Tiphareth, thereceptacle and the centre of the Forces of the Sephirothand thePaths.The extreme centre of the Rose is white, the reflectedSpiritual brightness ofKether, bearing upon it the RedRose of Five Petals and the Golden Cross ofSixSquares; four green Rays issuant around the Angles ofthe Cross, from whichthe Second Order takes its name.They are the Symbols of the Receiving Force.Upon the white portion of the Symbol, below theRose, is placed the Hexagram,with the Planets in theorder which is the key of the Supreme Ritual oftheHexagram.Around the Pentagrams, which are placed one uponeach Elemental coloured arm, aredrawn the symbolsof the Spirit and the Four Elements, in the order whichis thekey to the Supreme Ritual of the Pentagram.Upon each of the floriated ends ofthe Cross are ar-<5i>ranged the Three Alchemical Principles, but in a dif-ferent order for eachElement, and as showing theiroperation therein.The upmost Arm of the Cross, allotted to Air, is ofthe yellow colour ofTiphareth. In it the flowing Philo-sophic Mercurial nature is chief and withouthindranceto its mobility; hence the ever moving nature of Air.Its Sulphureousside is drawn from the part of Fire,whence its luminous and electricalqualities. Its Salineside in from the Water, whence result clouds and rainfromthe action of the Solar Forces.The lowest Arm of the Cross, allotted to Earth, isof the four colours ofMalkuth, the Earth being of thenature of a container and receiver of the otherinflu-ences. The Citrine answers to its Airy part, the Oliveto the Watery, theRusset to the Fire, and the black tothe lowest part, Earth. Here also is theMercurial partchief, but hindered by the compound nature whenceits facultybecomes germinative rather than mobile,while the Sulphur and the Salt arerespectively fromthe sides of Water and Fire, which almost neutralizetheirnatural operation and bring about the fixednessand immobility of Earth.The extremity allotted to Eire is of the scarlet colourof Geburah, and in it theSulphureous nature is chief,whence its powers of heat and burning. The Saltisfrom the side of Earth, whence the necessity for a con-stant substantialpabulum whereon to act, and theMercury is from the side of Air, whence theleaping,lambent motion of flame especially when acted uponby wind.The extremity alloted to Water is of the blue colourof Chesed, and in it theSaline side is chief as exempli-fied in the salt water of the Ocean, to whichall watersgo; and from whence also is derived the nature ofalways preserving thehorizontal line. The Mercurialpart is from Earth, whence the weight and force ofitsflux and reflux. Its Sulphuric part is from the Airwhence the effect of wavesand storms. So that the< 52 >disposition of these Three Principles forms the key oftheir Alchemic operationin the Elements.The White rays issuing from behind the Rose at theinner angles between the Arms,are the Rays of theDivine Light issuing and corruscating from the Re*fleetedLight of Kether in its centre; and the lettersand symbols on them refer to theanalysis of the KeyWord of an Adeptus Minor, L N. R. I. by which theopening ofthe Vault is accomplished.The Twelve letters of the Twelve Petals follow theOrder of the Signs of theZodiac. Uppermost is Heh,the letter of Aries, followed by Vau, Zayin, Cheth,Teth,Yod, while the letter of Libra, which is Lamed is lower-most. Ascending areNun, Samech, Ayin, Tzaddi, Qoph.The Seven Double Letters of the middle row areallotted to the Planets in theorder of their Exaltations,the planets being wanderers; the Stars are fixedwithrespect to the Earth. These letters are Peh, Resh, Beth,with Daleth exactlyover Libra, followed by Gimel,Caph, Tau.The Three Mother letters are allotted to the Ele-ments and are so arranged thatthe Petal of Air shouldbe beneath the Arm of the Cross allotted to Air,whilethose of Fire and Water are on counterchanged sides, sothat the forces ofthe Arms of the Cross should not toomuch override the Planetary and Zodiacalforces in theRose, which might otherwise be the case were the Petalof Fireplaced on the same side as the Arm of Fire andthat of Water on the side ofWater.The Mode of Sigil Formation from the Rose Petalsis taught in the supplement tothis Ritual, reproducedin Book Seven in Volume Four.The back of the Cross bears inscriptions in Latin:“The Master Jesus Christ, Godand Man/’ betweenfour Maltese Crosses which represent the Four Pyra-mids of theElements opened out.This is placed at the upmost part because therein isaffirmed a Descent of theDivine Force into Tiphareth,< 53 >which Is the central point between Supernals and In-feriors.But at the lowest part is written the motto of theZelator Adeptus Minor, becausetherein is the affirm-ation of the elevation of the Human into the Divine.Butthis is impossible without the assistance of theDivine Spirit from Kether,whence the space aboveMalkuth is white upon the front aspect of the Cross,whitebeing the Symbol of the Spiritual rescued fromthe Material.In the centre is written in Latin between the Symbolsof the AlchemicalPrinciples, of which the outermostis Sulphur, the Purgatorial Fire of Sufferingand Self-Sacrifice, ‘‘Blessed be the Lord our God who hath givenus the SymbolSignum.” And this is a word of sixletters, thus representing the six CreativePeriods inthe universe.The Cross may be cut out of cardboard and the col-oured portions may be paintedor formed by pastingon portions of coloured papers of the required sizeandshape. The Colours must be correct, clear and brilliant.If they are not, theSymbol is useless either as a Symbolor Insignium. If this occurs the wholeshould be de-stroyed, for faulty colours or shapes in Divine Symbolsare adegradation of Divine things and are practicalblasphemy, because it issubstituting the Evil and dis-orderly for the Good.NOTES ON THE ROSE CROSSIt is unfortunate that I have not been able to repro-duce the symbol in itscolours as painted by the Adept-us Minor. Black and white give no indication ofthebeauty and impressive quality which this symbol pos-sesses. The reader shouldtherefore make one for him-self and colour it according to these directions.The upper arm, above the Rose, attributed to theElement of Air, is painted inbright yellow. Variouslacquer enamels are now available, the use of which< 54 >produces just the right kind of brilliance required forthese magical symbols andflashing Tablets. Over theyellow should be painted the symbols shown in itsdirectcomplement, pale mauve.The right arm attributed to Water, is blue, and thesymbols should be paintedthereon in orange. It is diffi-cult to describe the correct tone or depth ofcolour inthese complementaries, but the student will know whenhe has hit uponthe right hue for then the symbols willbegin visibly to flash.The left arm, the Fire arm, is red, and the symbolsappear on it in brightemerald green. Beneath the Roseare two sections. The first is white, upon whicha hexa-gram with planetary attributions is painted in black.Beneath this is theEarth section, which should bepainted in the four colours of Malkuth, Citrine,Olive,Russet, and Black. Superimposed on this, the penta-gram and symbols willbe painted in white.The Petals of the Rose will be painted in the appro-priate colours of the KingScale, and the Letters, onthem, in the complementary colours, the Cross withinisGold, the barbs green, and the Rose red.—I.R.< SS >Diagram 20Picture #51 [images/img_0051.png]THE ROSE CROSS LAMENCONSECRATIONOF THEROSE CROSSCONSECRATION CEREMONY1.

Perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pen-tagram.<6i>THEMAGIC SWORDIt is to be used in all cases where great force andstrength are to be used andare required, but principallyfor banishing and for defence against evil forces.Forthis reason it is under the Presidency of Geburah andof Mars, whose Names andForces are to be invokedat its consecration, which should take place in thedayand hour of Mars, or else during the course of the FieryTattwa.Any convenient sword may be adapted to this use,but the handle, hilt and guardmust be such as to offersurfaces for inscriptions. It should be of mediumlengthand weight.The motto of the Adeptus should be engraved uponit, or upon the hilt in lettersof emerald green, in addi-tion to the mystic devices and names. The hilt,pommeland guard are to be coloured a flame red. The bladeshould be clean andbright. Pentagrams should bepainted on salient portions, because this is thelinealfigure of Geburah. The Divine and Angelic Namesrelated to Geburah are thento be added in emerald,and also their Sigils taken from the Rose. The Swordmustthen be consecrated in due form.Here again let the Zelator Adeptus Minor rememberhis Obligation never to use hisknowledge of practicalMagic for purposes of Evil, and let him be wellassuredthat if he do this, notwithstanding his pledge, the evilhe endeavours tobring about will re-act on himself. Hewill experience in his own person andaffairs that verything which he has endeavoured to bring about foranother. Soalso may he perish and be blotted out fromamong us.To obtain real force implanted in any magical weap-on, by consecration, theAdept requires to be healthy,pure, strong in mind, free from anxiety and apartfrom<6 2 >disturbances. He requires also to have mastered thedetails of the ceremony andto be familiar with theproper pentagrams and other symbols.CONSECRATION RITUAL OF SWORDPrepare: Chamber, central Altar draped in Black,Red Cross and White Triangle,Rose and Incense,Cup and Water, Lamp, Plate and Salt.

So thateven if onlyone is to be used the others should be alsopresent, even as each of the FourElemental Tablets isdivided in itself unto Four Lesser Angles representingtheother three Elements bound together therewithin the same Tablet. Therefore alsolet the Z. A. M.remember that when he works with these forces he isas it weredealing with the Forces of the Letters of theDivine Name.Each Implement must be consecrated, and when thishas been done, no one else musttouch it.THE WAND FOR FIREThe staff of the Wand should be of wood, roundedand smooth and perforated fromend to end. Withinit should be placed a magnetised steel rod, just so longas toproject 1/16 inch beyond each end of the wood.It is often convenient to form theWand of cane whichhas a natural hollow through it. If of cane, there shouldbethree natural lengths according to the knots, so thatthese knots may be placedsimilarly to the manner inthe figure which is such as a turner would produce.Eighteen inches is an extreme length; (Note: Thatof the present writer is aboutten inches long.—I.R.)The magnet should be a strong one. One end of thewoodshould be cone-shaped. The North end of themagnet, known by its repelling theso-called North Poleof a compass needle, should be placed at the end of theWandwhich is plain.The whole is coloured flame Scarlet, and is dividedinto three parts by yellowbands. The cone-shaped endhas also painted upon its red surface three wavyflame-<66>Diagram 21Picture #52 [images/img_0052.png]THE SWORD AND ELEMENTAL WEAPONS<67 >shaped Yods as ornaments, they are painted brightyellow.The Divine and Angelic Names of the Element ofFire should then be written inbright green paint alongthe shaft and on the cone. Their Sigils should beaddedand the motto of the Adeptus.The Wand must then be consecrated. It is for allworkings of the nature of Fireand under the presidencyof Yod and of the “Wand of the Tarot.”THE CUP FOR WATERAny convenient glass Cup may be adapted for thisuse. The bowl should be somewhatthe shape of a crocusflower, and must show eight petals. A smooth glass cupispreferable unless it have eight cuts or ridges. Theseeight petals must becoloured bright blue; neither toopale nor too dark. They must be edged withbrightorange colour. The colours must be clear and correct.The petals may beformed by paint or by colouredpaper pasted on the glass.The proper Divine and Angelic Names are then tobe written upon the petals inOrange colour togetherwith their Sigils from the Rose; then add the MottoofAdeptus. The Cup must then be consecrated. It is-to be used in all workings ofthe nature of Water, andunder the presidency of the letter Heh, and the “Cupofthe Tarot.”THE DAGGER FOR AIRAny convenient dagger or knife or sword may beadapted to the use; the shorter itis, the better.The hilt and pommel and guard are to be colouredin bright pure yellow. TheDivine and Angelic Namesshould be written upon the yellow background in pur-pleor violet, together with their Sigils from the Rose,and the motto of theAdeptus.It is to be used in all work of the Airy Nature, andunder the presidency of Vau,and the “Sword of theTarot.”< 68 >Let there be no confusion between the Magical Swordand the Air Dagger. TheMagical Sword is under Ge-burah and is for strength and defence. The AirDaggeris for Air, for Vau of Yhvh, and is to be used with thethree otherElemental Implements. They belong todifferent planes and any substitution of onefor theother is harmful.THE PENTACLE FOR EARTHThe Pantacle or Pentacle should be formed of around disc of wood, about 414inches in diameter, andfrom Vz inch to 1 inch in thickness; nicely polished,andtruly circular, and of even thickness.There should be a circular white border and a whiteHexagram on each face of theDisc. The space withinthe white border should be divided into four compart-mentsby two diameters at right angles. These fourcompartments are to be coloured: theupper. Citrine;right, Olive-green; left, Russet-brown; lowrest, Black.The Divine and Angelic Names should be writtenin black round the white border;each name followedby its Sigil taken from the Rose. The motto of theAdeptus tobe added.The Pentacle should be the same on both sides, andshould be held in the handwith the citrine uppermost;unless there is any special reason for using one oftheother compartments. And in this matter remember thatCitrine is the Airy partof Earth; Russet the Fiery;Olive the Watery; Black the Earthy part of Earth.The Pentacle must then be consecrated.It is then to be used in all work of the nature of Earth,and is under thepresidency of Heh final, and of the“Pentacle of the Tarot.”< 69 >RITUAL OF CONSECRATIONOF THEFOUR ELEMENTAL WEAPONSProvide Altar, Lamp, Cup, Salt, Incense and Rose,White Triangle, and Red Cross.Four new implements.

This isexplained under the chapter concerning the Hegemon.Of the Temple in Reference to the Sephirotk. TheTemple, as arranged in theNeophyte Grade of theOrder of the Golden Dawn in the Outer, is placed look-ingtowards the Yh of Yhvh in Malkuth in Assiah. Thatis, as Y and H answer unto theSephiroth Chokmah andBinah in the Tree, (and unto Abba and Aima, throughwhoseknowledge alone that of Kether may be ob-tained) even so, the Sacred Rites ofthe lemple maygradually, and as it were, in spite of himself, lead theNeophyteunto the knowledge of his Higher Self. Likethe other Sephiroth, Malkuth hathalso its subsidiarySephiroth and Paths. Of these Ten Sephiroth, the Tem-ple asarranged in the Neophyte Grade, includeth onlythe four lower Sephiroth in theTree of Life, viz: Mal-kuth, Yesod, Hod, and Netzach, and the Outer sideofParoketh, the Veil. Paroketh formeth the East of theTemple. First inimportance cometh the symbolism ofthe East.The Three Chiefs who govern and rule all things, theViceroys in the Temple ofthe unknown Second Orderbeyond, are the reflections therein of the PowersofChesed, Geburah and Tiphareth. They represent: theImperator — Geburah and theGrade © = 0: the Prae-monstrator — Chesed and the Grade © = 0: theCan-cellarius—Tiphareth and the Grade GO = 00.<8z>Now the Imperator governeth, because in Netzach,which is the highest Grade ofthe First Order, © = H,is the Fire reflected from Geburah. The PraemonstratorisSecond, because in Hod, which is the next highestGrade, © = GD, is the Waterreflected from Chesed. TheThird is the Caneellarius, because in Yesod, ©=H],isthe Air reflected from Tiphareth. Thus the Order isgoverned by a Triad, one inintention but having differ-ent functions: the Imperator to command: thePrae-monstrator to instruct: the Caneellarius to record.The proper mantle of Office of the Imperator is theflame scarlet Robe of Fireand Severity, as on him dothe energy and stability of the Temple depend: andifhe has sub-Officers to assist him, they partake of hissymbolism. His Mantle isthe symbol of unflinchingAuthority, compelling the obedience of the Temple toallcommands issued by the Second Order; and uponthe left breast thereof, is theCross and Trangle of theGolden Dawn, both white, representing the purifica-tionof the Temple in the Outer Order by Fire. He maywear a Lamen similar to that ofHierophant, of the samecolours, but depending from a scarlet collar, and hemaybear a Sword similar to that of Hiereus. His placein the Temple is at theextreme right of the Dais andat the Equinox he takes the Throne ofHierophantwhen that Office is vacated.The proper Mantle of Office of the Praemonstratoris the bright blue Robe ofWater, representing the re-flection of the Wisdom and Knowledge of Chesed.Hisduty is that of Teacher and Instructor of the Temple,always limited by hisObligation to keep secret theKnowledge of the Second Order from the OuterOrder.He superintends the working of the Outer Order, seeingthat in it nothingbe relaxed or profaned; and dulyissues to the Temple any instruction regardingtheRitual received by him from the Greatly HonouredChiefs of the Second Order.He is therefore to the Tem-ple the Reflector of the Wisdom beyond. Hissub-offi-cers partake of his symbolism. The White Cross and<83>Triangle on his left Breast on the Robe represents thepurification of the OuterOrder by Water. He may weara Lamen like that of Hierophant, but blue uponanorange field and depending from a collar of blue. Hemay bear a Sceptresurmounted by a Maltese Cross inthe Elemental Colours.The proper Mantle of Office of the Cancellarius isthe yellow Robe of Air. Uponhim depend the Recordsof the Temple, the order of its working, the arrange-mentsof its Meetings and the circulation of its manu-scripts. He is the Recorder and,more immediately thaneither of the preceding Chiefs, the Representative oftheexecutive authority of the Second Order over theOuter. His duty is to see thatin no case knowledge of aGrade be given to a Member who has not properlyat-tained to it. He is the immediate circulator of all com-munications from theSecond Order. His sub-officerspartake of his symbolism. His White Cross andTri-angle represent the purification of the Outer Order byAir. Cancellarius maywear a Lamen like that of Hiero-phant, but of yellow on a purple field, anddependingfrom a purple Collar; and he may bear a Sceptre sur-mounted by aHexagram of amber and gold.The Sceptres of the Chiefs should be of the samecolour as their Mantles, with agold band to representTiphareth, being the first Grade of the Inner Order.TheSword of Imperator should have a plain scarlethilt, with gold or brassmountings, while the Sceptre ofPraemonstrator should be blue with a gold band.Theproper seat of the Chiefs is beside the Hierophant, andif desired theImperator and Cancellarius may be seatedto the right and Praemonstrator andImmediate PastHierophant to his left — the Cancellarius and Imme-diate PastHierophant being nearest to the Hierophanton their respective sides. The Chiefsstand before theVeil in the East of the Temple, as the Representativesof theInner Order and therefore no meeting can beheld without one of them. Preferablyall Three Chiefs< 84 >should be present. The other Officers of the Templeexist only by their authorityand permission.Because the East of the Temple is the outer side ofParoketh, all Members of theSecond Order wear theCrossed Sashes of a Lord of the Paths of the Portal oftheVault only — no higher Grade being allowed to beshown in a Temple of the FirstOrder. Members of theSecond Order should be seated in the East of the Tem-plewhen practicable. Any Past Hierophant may weara Mantle of a Hierophant and aJewel of that Lamen,but not a large Collar Lamen. Immediate Past Hiero-phant mayhave a Sceptre of a Hierophant.The Chiefs, or Members asked to represent them onthe Dais, wear white gowns. Thecords and tassels ofall Mantles of Chiefs or Officers should be whitetosymbolise spiritual purity and influence of the Divineand Shining Light.Members of the Outer Order weara black gown or tunic, with a Sash indicatingtheirGrade across it. The Black Sash crosses from the leftshoulder (from theside of the Black Pillar, as theyfirst received it), and the White Sash from theRightshoulder.Egyptian Head-Dresses, or Nemysses are worn bythe Chiefs and Officers, those ofthe \"Chiefs being of theColour of their Mantles striped with the complemen-tarycolour; those of the Officers being striped equallyblack and w’bite. Members maywear similar nemyssesin black and white or plain black squares ofapprovedpattern.The Key to the formation of the tunic and nemyssis the Crux Ansata for thenemyss makes the oval, andthe arms and body of the tunic, the cross.THE SYMBOLISM OF THE TEMPLEThe Bases of the two Pillars are respectively in Net-zach and Hod; the WhitePillar being in Netzach andthe Black Pillar in Hod. They represent the TwoPillarsof Mercy and Severity, The bases are cubical and blackto represent theEarth Element in Malkuth. The col-< 85 >umns are respectively black and white to represent themanifestation of theEternal Balance of the Scales ofJustice. Upon them should be represented incounter-changed colour any appropriate Egyptian designs, em-blematic of theSoul.The scarlet tetra-hedronal capitals represent the Fireof Test and Trial: andbetween the Pillars is the porch-way of the Region Immeasurable. The twin lightswhichburn on their summits are “The Declarers of the Eter-nal Truth.” The basesof the tetrahedra, being triangu-lar, that on the white pillar points East,while that onthe Black points West. They thus complete the Hexa-gram ofTiphareth — though separate, as is fitting in“The Hall of the Dual Manifestationof Truth.”The Altar, whose form is that of a double cube, isplaced in the Eastern part ofMalkuth, as far as theNeophyte is concerned. But to the Adeptus Minor,itsblackness will veil on the East citrine, on the Southolive, on the Northrusset, while the West side alone,and the base, will be black, while the summitis of abrilliant whiteness.The Symbols upon the Altar represent the Forces andManifestation of the DivineLight, concentrated in theWhite Triangle of the Three Supernals as thesynthesis;wherefore, upon this sacred and sublime Symbol, is theobligation ofthe Neophyte taken as calling therein towitness the Forces of the Divine Light.The Red Cross of Tiphareth (to which the Grade of© = EH is referred) is hereplaced above the White Tri-angle, not as dominating it, but as bringing itdownand manifesting it unto the Outer Order; as thoughThe Crucified One, havingraised the symbol of self-sacrifice, had thus touched and brought into actioninmatter, the Divine Triad of Light.Around the Cross are the Symbols of the FourLetters of the Name Jehovah — theShin of Yeheshuahbeing only implied and not expressed in the OuterOrder. At theEast is the Mystical Rose, allied by itsscent to the Element of Air. At theSouth is the Red<86>Lamp, allied by its Flame with the Element of Fire.At the West is the Cup ofWine, allied by its fluid formto the Element of Water. At the North are BreadandSalt, allied by their substance to the Element of Earth.The Elements are placed upon the Altar accordingto the Winds.“For Osiris on-Nophris who is found perfect beforethe Gods, hath said:‘These are the Elements of my Body,Perfected through Suffering, Glorified throughTrial.For the scent of the Dying Rose is as the repressedSigh of my suffering:And the flame-red Fire as the Energy of mine Un-daunted Will:And the Cup of Wine is the pouring out of theBlood of my Heart:Sacrificed unto Regeneration, unto the Newer Life:And the Bread and Salt are asthe Foundationsof my Body,Which I destroy in order that they may berenewed.For I am Osiris Triumphant, even Osiris on-Nophris, the Justified:I am He who is clothed with the Body of Flesh,Yet in whom is the Spirit of theGreat Gods:I am The Lord of Life, triumphant over Death.He who partaketh with me shall arise with me:I am the Manifestor in Matter of Those WhoseAbode is the Invisible:I am purified: I stand upon the Universe:I am its Reconciler with the Eternal Gods:I am the Perfector of Matter:And without me, the Universe is not/ ”Technically, the Door is supposed to be situated be-hind the seat of Hiereus inthe West; but it may be inany part of the Hall, seeing that the wallsrepresentthe Barrier to the Exterior. “The Gate of the Declarers< 87 >of Judgment” is its name — and its symbolic form isthat of a straight and narrowDoorway, between twoMighty Pylons. ‘‘The Watcher against the Evil Ones”is thename of the Sentinel who guards it and his formis the symbolic one of Anubis.THE STATIONS OF THE OFFICERSThe Hierophant is placed in the East of the 1 emple,on the outer side of theVeil Paroketh, to rule the Tem-ple under the Presidency of the Chiefs. T here hefillsthe place of a Lord of the Paths of the Portal of theVault of the Adepts,acting as Inductor to the SacredMysteries.The Insignia and Symbols of Hierophantare:The Throne of the East in the Path of Samekh,outside the Veil.The Mantle of bright flame scarlet, bearing a whitecross on the left breast.The Lamen suspended from a white Collar.The Crown-headed Sceptre.The Banner of the East.The position of the Throne on the Path Samekh isfitting for the Inductor to theMysteries, as there beingplaced in that balanced and central position ofthatPath by which alone is safe entrance to the mysticalknowledge of the Lightin Tiphareth. Being placedbefore Paroketh at the point of its rending, ittheremarks the shining forth of the Light through the Veil;and that translationof the Three Supernals to theOuter Order, which is represented by the redCalvaryCross and the White Triangle upon the Altar. Thusthe station ofHierophant’s Throne, fitly represents theRising of the Sun of Life and Lightupon our Order.The Robe of scarlet represents the flaming energyof the Divine Light, shiningforth into infinite Worlds.Upon the left breast is a White Cross to representpuri-fication unto the Light, and this Cross may be one ofthe following forms: —<88>CALVARY:In which case it alludeseither to the cross of sixsquares of Tiphareth or totheCross of the Rivers.PYRAMIDAL:The Cross of the Elements,to represent the descent ofthe Divine andAngelicForces into the pyramidsymbol.EQUILATERAL:I A Cross of the Elements,| | symbolising their purifica-tion through the Light of, | 1 the Four-lettered NameYhvh in Tiphareth.MALTESE:The Cross of four arrow-heads, representing the keenand swift impact oftheLight, coming from behindthe Veil, through the Ele-ments symbolised bythearrow of Sagittarius in thePath Samekh.It is indifferent which of the Crosses be employed,seeing that each representsthe operation of the Lightthrough the Veil.The Sceptre represents the forces of the Middle Pil-lar. It is scarlet with goldbands to represent the placesof the Sep hi rath Daath, Tiphareth and Yesod, the< 89 >Picture #53 [images/img_0053.png]Picture #54 [images/img_0054.png]pommel being Malkuth. The shaft represents the PathsGimel, Samekh and Tau. TheGrip by which it iswielded^ is the path Tau, representing the Universe gov-ernedby and attracting the forces of the Light. TheNames of Sephiroth and Paths arenot marked thereon,but the Hierophant Initiate of the Second Ordershouldremember the sublimity of the symbolism while hewields it. It representshim as touching thereby theDivine Light of Kether and attracting it throughtheMiddle Pillar to Malkuth. It is called “The Sceptre ofPower” and invests himwith the power of declaringthe Temple Open or Closed in any Grade, if timebeshort, and this is done by saying: “By the power in mevested by this Sceptre,I declare this Tempie dulyopened (or closed).”This method of Opening and Closing “by Sceptre”should only be used in greatemergency where timepresses. It should not be used in a Ceremony whereElementalSpirits have been invoked — especially notin the Closing,The Lamen is partially explained in the Portal Cere-mony thus: “The Hierophant'sLamen is a synthesisof Tiphareth, to which the Calvary cross of sixsquares,forming the cube opened out, is fitly referred. The twocolours, red andgreen, the most active and the mostpassive, whose conjunction points out thepracticalapplication of the knowledge of equilibrium, are sym-bolic of thereconciliation of the celestial essences ofFire and Water. For the reconcilingyellow unites withblue in green, which is the complementary colour tored, andwith red in orange which is the complementarycolour to blue. The small innercircle placed upon theCross alludes to the Rose that is conjoined therewithinthe symbolism of the Rose and Cross of our Order.”But in addition to this, itrepresents the blazing lightof the Fire of the Sun bringing into being thegreenvegetation of the otherwise barren Earth. And alsothe power ofself-sacrifice requisite in one who wouldessay to initiate into the SacredMysteries. So as the< 9° >Sceptre represents the Authority and Power of theLight, the Lamen affirms thequalifications necessaryto him who wields it, and therefore is it suspendedfroma white collar, to represent the Purity of the WhiteBrilliance from Kether.Hence it should always be wornby the Hierophant.The Banner of the East is also partially explained inthe Portal: —“The field ofthe Banner of the East isWhite, the colour of light and purity. As in thepreviouscase, the Calvary Cross of six squares is the number ofsix of Tiphareth,the yellow Cross of Solar Gold, andthe cubical stone, bearing in its centre thesacred Tauof Life, and having bound together upon it the form ofthe MacrocosmicHexagram, the red triangle of Fireand the blue triangle of Water — the RuachElohimand the Waters of Creation.”In addition to this explanation, it affirms the Modeof Action employed by theDivine Light in its operationby the Forces of Nature. Upon it is the symbol oftheMacrocosm so coloured as to affirm the action of theFire of the Spiritthrough the Waters of Creation underthe harmony of the Golden Cross of theReconciler.Within the centre of the Hexagram is a Tau cross inWhite, torepresent its action as a Triad; and the wholeis placed on a white fieldrepresenting the Ocean of theAin Soph Aour. The Banner is suspended from agoldcoloured bar by red cords, and the pole and base shouldbe white. The baserepresents the purity of the founda-tion— the shaft, the Purified Will directedto the High-er. The golden cross-bar is that whereon the ManifestedLaw ofPerfection rests; the Banner itself, the PerfectLaw of the Universe, the redcords and tassels theDivine Self-renunciation, Whose trials and sufferingsform,as it were, the Ornament of the Completed Work.The whole represents the ascentof the Initiate intoPerfect Knowledge of the Light — therefore in theaddress ofthe Hiereus the Neophyte hears ‘‘Even theBanner of the East sinks in Adorationbefore Him,”as though that symbol, great and potent though it be,< 9i >were yet but an inferior presentment of the Higher,fitted to our comprehension.“Expounder of the Sacred Mysteries” is the name ofthe Hierophant, and he is“Osiris” (Aeshoorist) in theNether World. (St added as a suffix to a nameindicatesthe influence from Kether.)The Station of Hiereus is at the extreme West of theTemple and in the lowestpoint of Malkuth where heis enthroned in its darkest part, in the quarterrepre-sented black in the Minutum Mundum Diagram. Rep-resenting a Terrible andAvenging God at the Confinesof Matter, at the borders of the Qlippoth, he isen-throned upon Matter and robed in Darkness, and abouthis feet are Thunder andLightning — the impact of thePaths of Shin and Qoph — Fire and Water,terminatingrespectively in the russet and olive quarters of Mal-kuth. There,therefore, is he placed as a mighty andavenging Guardian to the SacredMysteries. The Sym-bols and Insignia of Hiereus are:The Throne of the West in the Black of Malkuth,where it borders on the Kingdomof Shells,The Black Robe of Darkness, bearing a white crosson the left breast;The Sword of Strength and Severity;The Lamen suspended from a Scarlet Collar.The Banner of the West.The position of the Throne of the West at the limitsof Malkuth is fitting forthe Avenger of the Gods, forhe is placed there in eternal affirmation againstthe EvilOnes—“Hitherto shall ye come and no further.” TheThrone is also placedthere as a seat of witness and ofpunishment decreed against Evil,The Robe or Mantle is of Darkness, threatening andterrible to the Outer, asconcealing an avenging Forceever ready to break forth against the Evil Ones.Onthe left breast is a white Cross to represent the Purifi-cation of Matter untothe Light. The Sword represents< 92 >the Forces of the Pillar of Severity as a whole, but theplaces of the Sephirothare not necessarily indicatedthereon. The guard is Hod and may be of brass;theGrip is the Path of Shin and may be of scarlet, and thepommel, Malkuth, maybe black. The grip by whichit is wielded, being the Path Shin, represents theUni-verse governed by the flaming force of Severity, andrepresents the Hiereusas wielding the Forces of DivineSeverity. “The Sword of Vengeance” is its name.The Lamen is partially explained in the Portal thus:“The Outer Circle includesthe four Sephiroth, Tipha-reth, Netzach, Hod, and Yesod, of which the firstthreemark the angles of the triangle inscribed within, whilethe connecting PathsNun, Ayin, and Peh form its sides.In the extreme centre is the Path Samekhthroughwhich is the passage for the Rending of the Veil. It istherefore afitting Lamen for Hiereus as representingthe connecting link between the Firstand SecondOrders, while the white triangle established in the sur-roundingDarkness is circumscribed in its turn by theCircle of Light.” In addition tothis explanation, theLamen represents “The Light that shineth in Darknessthoughthe Darkness comprehendeth it not,” It affirmsthe possibility of the Redemptionfrom Evil and eventhat of Evil itself, through self-sacrifice. It issuspendedfrom a scarlet Collar as representing its dependence onthe Force ofDivine Severity over-awing the evil. It isa symbol of tremendous Strength andFortitude, andis a synthesis of the Office of Hiereus as regards theTemple, asopposed to his Office as regards the outerworld. For these reasons it shouldalways be worn byHiereus.The Banner of the West completes the symbols ofHiereus. It is thus explained inthe Zelator Grade:“The White Triangle refers to the three Paths connect-ingMalkuth with the other Sephiroth; while the redcross is the Hidden Knowledge ofthe Divine Naturewhich is to be obtained through their aid. The CrossandTriangle together represent Life and Light.” In< 93 >addition to this explanation from the Zelator Grade,it represents eternally thepossibility of Rescuing theEvil; but in it the Tiphareth cross is placed withintheWhite Triangle of the Supernals as thereby represent-ing that Sacrifice asmade only unto the Higher. Thered Cross may be bordered with gold in thisinstance,to represent the Perfect Metal obtained in and throughthe Darkness ofPutrefaction. Black is its field whichthus represents the Darkness and Ignoranceof theOuter, while the White Triangle is again the Lightwhich shineth in theDarkness but which is not com-prehended thereby. Therefore is the Banner of theWestthe symbol of Twilight — as it were the equation ofLight and Darkness. Thepole and the base are black,to represent that even in the Depths of Evil canthatsymbol stand. The cord is black, but the transversebar and the lance-pointmay be golden or brass andthe tassels scarlet as in the case of the Banner oftheEast, and for the same reasons.The Banner of the West, when it changes its positionin the Temple, representsthat which bars and threat-ens, and demands fresh sacrifice ere the Pathleadingto the Higher be attained.“Avenger of the Gods” is the name of Hiereus, andhe is “Horus in the Abode ofBlindness unto, and Igno-rance of, the Higher.” Hoor is his name.The Station of Hegemon is between the Two Pillarswhose bases are in Netzach andHod, at the intersec-tion of the Paths Peh and Samekh, in the symbolicGateway ofOccult Science—as it were, at the Beamof the Balance, at the Equilibrium of theScales ofJustice; at the point of intersection of the Lowest Re-ciprocal Pathwith that of Samekh, which forms a partof the Middle Pillar. She is placed thereas the Guard-ian of the Threshold of Entrance and the Preparer ofthe Way for theEnterer—therefore the Reconcilerbetween Light and Darkness, and the Mediator be-< 94 >tween the Stations of Hierophant and Hiereus. TheSymbols and Insignia of Hegemonare:The Robe of Pure Whiteness, bearing on the leftbreast a Red Cross.The Mitre Headed Sceptre.The Lamen suspended from a Black Collar.The Robe represents the Spiritual Purity which isrequired in the Aspirant to theMysteries and withoutwhich qualification none can pass between theEternalPillars. It represents the Divine Light which is at-tracted thereby andbrought to the aid of the Candi-date. It symbolises the Self-Sacrifice that isoffered foranother to aid him in the attainment of the Light. Italso signifiesthe atonement of error, the Preparer ofthe Pathway unto the Divine. Upon theleft Breastis a Cross, usually the Calvary form, of red to representthe energyof the lower Will, purified and subjected tothat which is Higher— and thus isthe Office of Hege-mon especially that of the Reconciler.The Mitre-Headed Sceptre is the distinctive ensignof Office of Hegemon. On theTree of Life it representsthe forces of the Pillar of Mercy. It should be ofscarletwith gold bands and pommel. The bands represent theplaces of theSephiroth Chesed and Netzach—the shaftbeing formed by the Paths Vau and Kaph,the gripby which it is wielded being the Path Qoph, while thepommel is Malkuth.The Mitre is gold with red mount-ings and each point terminates in a ball. Themitre ischarged with a red calvary cross of Six squares. 'ThisMitre representsthe Wisdom of Chokmah as a dupli-cated aspect of Kether, attracted by the symbolof self-sacrifice. The Sceptre is wielded by the forces of Fluxand Reflux, shownby the grip being referred to thePath Qoph, and it represents the attractioninto theUniverse of the Forces of Divine Mercy. The Sephirothand Paths aremarked only as bands, and owing to itsmeaning, should be carried by Hegemon inall conduct-ing of the Candidate, as representing to the latter the< 95 >attraction of the Forces of his Higher Self. It is called‘‘The Sceptre ofWisdom.”The Lamen is explained in part in the Grade of Phi-losophus thus: “The peculiaremblem of the Hegemonis the Calvary Cross of Six Squares within a Circle.ThisCross embraces Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod andYesod, and rests upon Malkuth. Alsothe Calvary Crossof Six Squares forms the cube and is thus referred tothe SixSephiroth of Microprosopus which are Chesed,Geburah, Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod andYesod.”In addition to this explanation, it represents the blackCalvary Cross ofSuffering as the Initiator by Trialand Self-Abnegation, and the Opener of theWay intothe Comprehension of the Forces of the Divine Light.It is thereforesuspended from a black Collar to showthat Suffering is the Purgation of Evil.“Before the Face of the Gods in the Place of theThreshold” is the name ofHegemon, and she is theGoddess Thma-Ae-St having the following Copticforms:Thma-Ae-St — This as regards the Middle Pillarand the influence from Kether.Thma-aesh —This more Fiery as regards her influ-ence with respect to the Pillarof Severity.Thmaa-ett — This more Fluidic with regard to herinfluence with respect to thePillar of Mercy.She is the Wiclder of the Sceptre of Dual Wisdomfrom Chokmah and therefore isthe Mitre head splitin two and not closed, to indicate the Dual Manifes-tationof Wisdom and Truth: even as the Hall of theNeophytes is called “the Hall of theDual Manifesta-tion of the Goddess of Truth.”The Three Inferior Officers do not wear Mantles, butonly Lamens suspended fromblack Collars. The designsare in white on a black field to show that theyareAdministrators of the Forces of Light acting throughthe Darkness, under thePresidency of the SuperiorOfficers.<96>The Lamen of Kerux, is thus explained in the Gradeof Theoricus: “The Tree ofLife and the Three MotherLetters are the Keys wherewith to unlock the CaduceusofHermes. The upper point of the Wand rests onKether and the Wings stretch out toChokmah andBinah, thus comprehending the Three Supernal Sephi-roth. The lowerseven are embraced by the Serpentswhose heads fall on Chesed and Geburah. Theyare thetwin Serpents of Egypt and the currents of Astral Light.Furthermore, theWings and the top of the Wand formthe letter Shin, the symbol of Fire; the Headsandupper halves of the Serpents form Aleph the symbol ofAir; while their tailsenclose Mem, the symbol of Water— the Fire of Life above, the Waters of Creationbelow,and the Air symbol vibrating between them.”In addition to this, the Caduceus of Kerux representsthe balanced forces ofEternal Light working invisiblyin the Darkness — even as the Light borne beforethehood-winked Candidate at his Initiation, is symbolicof the Light which guideshim in the darkness of theworld though he sees it not nor knows it. ThisCaduceusis the Rod of Hermes, containing invisible and unsus-pected forces, therules of whose administration maybe revealed through meditation. It is the outerform ofthe Wand surmounted by the Winged Globe belowwhich the Twin Serpents areshown — the Wand ofthe Chief Adept in the © = 0 Grade.The Lamen of Stolistes is thus explained in the Gradeof Practicus: “The Cup ofStolistes partakes in partof the symbolism of the Laver of Moses and the SeaofSolomon. On the Tree of Life it embraces nine of theSephiroth exclusive ofKether. Yesod and Malkuthform the triangle below, the former the apex, thelatterthe base. Like the Caduceus, it further represents thethree Elements ofWater, Air, and Fire. The crescentis the Water which is above the Firmament; thecircleis the Firmament, and the triangle is the consumingFire below, which isopposed to the Celestial Fire sym-bolised by the upper part of the Caduceus.”< 97 >In addition to this explanation, the Cup representsthe Receptacle and Collectorof the more Fluidic Forcesof the Fight, and is the symbol of an inexhaustibleBowlof Libation from which Reservoir the Adept may drawthe Reserved Forces ofthe Light — which matter againcalls for meditation.The Lamen of Dadouchos is thus explained in theGrade of Zelator: “The HermeticCross, which is alsoknown as Fylfot, Hammer of Thor, and Swastika, isformed of17 squares taken from a square of 25 lessersquares. These 17 fitly represent theSun, the FourElements and, the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac.”In addition to this, the Lamen has a more extendedmeaning. The Hermetic Cross,the Bolt of WhirlingFlame, which is represented by the cross of Four Axeswhoseheads may be either double or single and turnedin either direction, is a symbolof terrific Strength, andrepresents the Fire of the Spirit, cleaving its way inalldirections through the Darkness of Matter. Thereforeis it borne on the Lamenof Dadouchos whose office isthat of Purification and Consecration by Fire, andfromit also may be drawn by meditation several formulaeof strength.The Kerux is the principal form of Anubis, as theSentinel is the subsidiaryform.Kerux is Ano-Oobist Emfie-Eeb-Te —“Anubis of the, East.”Sentinel is Ano-Oobi Em-Pemen-Te—“Anubis of theWest.”The Kerux is the Herald, the Guardian and Watcherwithin the Temple, as Sentinelis the Watcher without— and therefore is his charge the proper disposition ofthefurniture and stations of the Temple. He is also theProclaimer. His peculiarensigns of Office are:The Red Lamp to signify tbe Hidden Fire over whichhe watches.The Magic Staff of Power to represent a Ray of theDivine Light which kindles theHidden Fire.Two Potions whereby to produce the effect of Blood.< 98 >He is the Gurdian of the Inner side of the Portal —the sleepless Watcher of theGods and the Preparerof the Pathway to Divine Wisdom. “Watcher for theGods” isthe name of Kerux, and he is Ano-Oobist, theHerald before them.The Stolistes is stationed in the Northern Part ofthe Hall to the North-West ofthe Black Pillar whosebase is in Hod, and is there as the Affirmer of thepow-ers of Moisture, Water, reflected through the Tree intoHod. The Cup is theReceptacle of this, filled from Hodso as to transmit its forces into Malkuth,restoring andpurifying the vital forces therein by Cold and Mois-ture. “Goddessof the Scale of the Balance at the BlackPillar” is the name of Stolistes and sheis “The LightShining through the Waters upon Earth,” Aura-Mo-Ooth, and there isa connection between her and theAurim or Urim of the Hebrews.The Dadouchos is stationed towards the midst ofthe Southern part of the Hall, tothe South-West ofthe White Pillar whose base is in Netzach and is thereas theAffirmer of the Powers of Fire, reflected down theTree to Netzach. The Censer isthe Receptacle thereof— the transmitter of the Fires of Netzach toMalkuth,restoring and purifying the vital force therein by Heatand Dryness.“Goddess of the Scale of the Balance atthe White Pillar” is the name ofDadouchos and she is“Perfection through Fire manifesting onEarth.”Thaum-Aesch-Nia-eth, and there is a connection be-tween her and theThummim of the Hebrews.The Stolistes has the care of the Robes and Insigniaof the Temple as symbolisingby their cleansing andpurification the Purging away of the Evil of Malkuthby theWaters of the Spirit.The Dadouchos has charge of all lights, fires andincense, as representing thepurifying and purging ofMalkuth by Fire and the Light of the Spirit.TheseOfficers also purify the Temple, the Members and theCandidate by Water andby Fire, as it is written: “Iindeed baptise you with Water, but One shall come< 99 >after me who shall baptise ye with the Holy Ghostand with Fire.”This completes the names and titles of the Officersof a Temple and they areSeven in number and mayall be taken by a Frater or Soror. As theyrepresentpowers and not persons, the feminine form of the Greeknames is notusually used, for the powers are positive(male) or negative (female) accordingto the God-form used. Thus Hierophant, Hiereus, and Kerux aremore naturaloffices for Fratres, while Hegemon, Sto-listes and Dadouchos are more naturalfor Sorores —but the office itself carries no implication of sex andsometimesthe psychic balance of a ceremony may bebetter maintained when a Frater isHegemon and aSoror Hierophant.The Hierophant must be of the © = E Grade and aZelator Adeptus Minor. TheHiereus must be at leastPhilosophus, and the Hegemon at least Practicus,andpreferably Philosophus. Kerux must be at least The-oricus while Stolistes andDadouchos must be Zelator— a Neophyte being qualified only for Sentinel. Incasethe feminine forms of the names of the Officers shouldwish to be known, theyare as follows:V. H. Hierophant or V. H. HierophantriaH. Hiereus or H. HiereiaH. Hegemon or H.HegemoneKerux or KerukainaStolistes or StofistriaDadouchos or DadoucheSentinelor PhulaxOF THE THREE CHIEFSThe Three Chiefs are in the Temple and rule it, yetthey are not comprehended in,nor understood by, theOuter Order. They represent, as it were, VeiledDivini-ties sending a form to sit before the Veil Paroketh, and,like the Veilsof Isis and Nephthys, impenetrable saveto the Initiate. The synthesis of theThree Chiefs may< ioo>be said to be in the form of Tho-oth Who comethfrom behind the Veil at the pointof its Rending. Yetseparately, they may be thus referred:The Imperator, from his relation to Geburah, maybe referred to the GoddessNephthys,The Praemonstrator, from his relation to Chesed,may be referred to the GoddessIsis,The Cancellarius, from his property of Recorder,may be referred to the GodThoth:No ceremony of the Outer Order may take placewithout a Chief — preferably theThree Chiefs or theirVice-gerants present — and on account of the Stationson theDais, it is well to have these stations filled by anAdept, should a Chief beabsent. These Stations andthose of the Officers are called the Visible Stationsofthe Gods, and descriptions of the forms which an AdeptOfficer builds up as afocus of force are given in anotherpaper.THE INVISIBLE STATIONSThese are:1. The Stations of the Kerubim.2. The Stations of the Children of Horus.3. The Stations of the Evil One.4. The Station of Harpocrates.5. The Stations of Isis, Nephthys, Aroueris.1. The Kerubim: The Stations of the Man, the Lion,the Bull, and the Eagle are atthe Four Cardinal Pointswithout the Hall, as invisible Guardians of the limitsofthe Temple. They are placed according to the winds—beyond the Stations ofHierophant, Dadouchos, Hier-eus, and Stolistes — and in this order do theirsymbolsappear in all Warrants of Temples.The Kerub of Air formulates behind the Throne ofHierophant. She has a younggirl’s countenance andform, with large and shadowing wings; and she is apower ofthe Great Goddess Hathor who unites thepowers of Isis and Nephthys. To the SignAquarius isshe referred as a correlative, which represents Springs< 101 >of Water breaking upon Earth; though as a ZodiacalSign it is referred to Air,the container of Rain. TheEgyptian name of the Sign Aquarius is Phritithi,Note: “Thou shalt not confound the Kerubim withtheir Signs of the Zodiac,notwithstanding that thelatter be tinder the Presidency of the former,seeingthat the Kerub representeth a far more Sublime Po-tency, yet acting by aharmonious sympathy throughthe particular Sign allotted unto theircorrespondence.”The Kerub of Fire has the face and form of a Lionwith large and clashing wings.He formulates behindthe Throne of Dadouchos and he is a power of theGreatGoddess Tharpesh or Tharpheshest, the lattersyllable being nearly Pasht. Theaction of the LionKerub is through the Flaming hire of Leo of which theEgyptianname is Labo-Ae.The Kerub of Water has the face and form of a GreatEagle with large andglistening wings and he formu-lates behind the throne of Hiereus. He is a powerof theGreat God Thoomoo, and his operation is by the Signof Scorpio, which iscalled in Egyptian Szlae-Ee. (Note:In Egyptological works the name of this Godis Turnor Tmu.— I. R.)The Kerub of Earth has the face and form of a Bullwith heavy and darkeningwings. He formulates behindthe Throne of Stolistes and he is a power of theGreatGod Ahaphshi and his operation is by the Sign Tauruscalled Ta-Aur inEgyptian.2. The Children of Horus: Between the InvisibleStations of the Kerubim are thoseof the Four Vice-gerants of the Elements and they are situated at theFourCorners of the Temple, at the places marked bythe Four Rivers of Eden in theWarrant; for the bodyof a Warrant, authorising the formation and establish-mentof a Temple, represents the Temple itself — ofwhich the Guardians are theKerubim and the Vice-gerents in the places of the Rivers.Ameshet (man-headed) is placed in the North East,< 102 >between the Man and the Bull. Ameshet or Amesheth.(The spelling is Coptic anddiffers according to theforce intended to be invoked by the letters.)Tou-mathaph, jackal-headed, is placed in the SouthEast between the Man and theLion. Toumathph orTmoumathv.Ahephi, Ape-faced, is placed in the South Westbetween the Lion and the Eagle.Ahephi or Ahaphix.Kabexnuv, Hawk-faced, is placed in the North-West,between the Eagle and theBull. Kabexnuv or Dabexn-jemouv,3. The Station of the Evil One, This station is inthe place of Yesod and iscalled the Station of the EvilOne, the Slayer of Osiris. He is the Tempter,Accuser,and Punisher of the Brethren and in Egypt is repre-sented mostly withthe head of a Water-Dragon, thebody of a Lion or leopard, and the hind-parts ofaWater-horse. He is the Administrator of the power ofthe Evil Triad:The Stooping Dragon, Apophrassz.The Slayer of Osiris — Szathan Toophon.The brutal power of Demonic Force — Bessz.The Synthesis of this Evil Triad “The Mouth of thePower of Destruction” iscalled Ommoo-Szathan.4. The Station of Harpocrates. The Invisible Stationof Harpocrates is in thePath of Samekh, between theStation of Hegemon and the Invisible Station oftheEvil Triad. Harpocrates is the God of Silence and Mys-tery, whose Name is theWord of this Grade of Neo-phyte. He is the younger brother of Horus,Hoor-Po-Krattist.5. The Stations of Isis and Nephythys. The Stationsof Isis and Nephthys arerespectively at the Places ofthe Pillars in Netzach and Hod, and these GreatGod-desses are not otherwise shown in the Grade, save inconnection with thePraemonstrator and Imperator,< 103 >as operating through the Hierophant, seeing that Isiscorresponds to the Pillarof Mercy and Nephthys tothat of Severity; and therefore the positions of thePil-lars or Obelisks are but, as it were, the Places of theirfeet.The Station of Aroueris. The Invisible Station ofAroueris (Horns the Elder) isbeside the Hierophantas though representing the power of Osiris to theOuterOrder — for while the Hierophant is an Adeptus, heis shown only as Lord ofthe Paths of the Portal — sothat, when the Hierophant moves from the Throneofthe East, he is no longer Osiris but Aroueris. Yet whenthe Hierophant is onthe Dais the Station of Arouerisis that of the Immediate Past Hierophant whosits onthe Hierophant’s left. Aroo-ouerist.This ends the Constitutory Symbolism of a Templein the ® = GD Grade of Neophyte.Should a Memberhave occasion to quit his place, he shall do it movingwith thecourse of the Sun; and as he passes the placeof Hierophant, he shall salute withthe Sign. And whenhe enters or quits the Temple, he shall salute theHiero-phant’s Throne when within the Portal.< 104 >THE SYMBOLISM OF THE OPENINGOF THE© = m GRADE OF NEOPHYTEThe Opening Ceremony begins with the Cry of the“Watcher Within” who should cometo the right frontof Hierophant and raise his Wand. This Symbol of theRay of theDivine Light from the White Triangle ofthe Three Supernals thus descends intothe Darknessand warns the Evil and uninitiated to retire, so thatthe WhiteTriangle may be formulated upon the Altarthrough the combined effect of theformulae of theOpening Ceremony.Having done this, he sees that the Entrance is prop-erly guarded. And then theHierophant calls to the Hie-reus to test the Members by the Signs, theknowledgeof which shows that they, though in the Land of Blind-ness andIgnorance, have yet seen that Triangle ofDivine Light from the Three Supernalsformulated inDarkness. It is then noted that the names of the threechiefOfficers begin with the Letter of Breath the CopticZ*. In the name of Osiris the Zj is mute, and silent,and concealed, as it were,by ‘H’ the Eta. In the nameHoms, it is manifest and violently aspirated, whileinthe name Thmaest, it is partFy one and partly the other,for it is compoundedwith the Letter ‘T’ in ©.(H “Ae” is attributed to Chesed —Zs to Aries, and© to Earth and Saturn. This isintended to affirm theUnknown Life, which is Inspired from the Beyond,sent outto Aries, the commencement of the Springin the year, the Life which after beingInspired, isbreathed forth again; and also the possible use of thatBreath,between the Inspiration and the Expiration,in the combination between it and theForces of theMicrocosm.)The whole is a rehearsal of the properties of the re-< 105 >flection of the Element Air down through the MiddlePillar of the Sephiroth,representing the reflection ofthe Air from Kether, through Tiphareth to Yesod,andeven to the Citrine part of Malkuth. For the subtleAether is, in Kether,inspired from the Divine Eightbeyond; thence reflected into Tiphareth, whereinit iscombined with the Reflexes from the Alchemical Prin-ciples in that greatReceptacle of the Forces of the Tree.In Yesod, it affirms the foundation of aformula andfrom Malkuth it is breathed forth or reflected back.And this formula the Adept can use. Standing in hisSphere of Sensation he can,by his knowledge of theSacred Rites, raise himself unto the contemplationofYechidah and from thence aspire (in the sense of Ad-spire, i.e., to attracttowards you in breathing) down-wards into himself the Lower Genius as thoughtempo-rarily to inhabit himself as its Temple.Another formula of Vibration is here hidden. Let theAdept, standing upright, hisarms stretched out in theform of a Calvary Cross, vibrate a Divine Name,bring-ing with the formulation thereof a deep inspiration intohis lungs. Let himretain the breath, mentally pro-nouncing the Name in his Heart, so as to combineitwith the forces he desires to awake thereby; thencesending it downwardsthrough his body past Yesod,but not resting there, but taking his physical lifefora material basis, send it on into his feet. There he shallagain momentarilyformulate the Name — then, bring-ing it rushing upwards into the lungs, thenceshall hebreathe it forth strongly, while vibrating that DivineName. He will sendhis breath steadily forward intothe Universe so as to awake the correspondingforcesof the Name in the Outer World. Standing with armsout in the form of across, when the breath has beenimaginatively sent to the feet and back, bringthe armsforward in “The Sign of the Enterer” while vibratingthe Name out intothe Universe. On completing this,make the “Sign of Silence” and remain still,contem-plating the Force you have invoked,< 106 >This is the secret traditional mode of pronouncingthe Divine Names by vibration,but let the Adeptbeware that he applies it only to the Divine Names ofthe Gods.If he does this thing ignorantly in workingwith Elemental or Demonic Names, hemay bring intohimself terrible forces of Evil and Obsession. TheMethod describedis called “The Vibratory Formulaof the Middle Pillar.”After noting the Names of the Three Chief Officers,comes the recapitulation ofthe Stations and duties ofthe Officers, thus occultly affirming theestablishmentof the Temple so that the Divine Light may shine intothe Darkness.Then follows the purification and conse-cration of the Hall by Water and byFire, thus markingthe limitation of the Four Cardinal Points at theFourQuarters, and the Equation of the Elements. This isthe Baptism of the Placeand, as it were, the Prepara-tion of a fitting Shrine for the Forces of theDivineLight. While all this goes forward, especially after theHierophant’s “forby Names and Images are all powersawakened and re-awakened,” the Officersbecomeclothed in their God-forms and the Invisible Stationsawake.The Procession of Officers is then formed in the Northin readiness for the“Mystic Circumambulation in thePath of Light” (that is to say, none of thepartakersis hood-winked). It is formed in the North, beginningfrom the Stationof Stolistes, the symbol of the Watersof Creation attracting the Divine Spirit,and thereforealluding to the Creation of the World by the Spirit andthe Waters.The Mystic Reverse Circumambulationforms its Procession in the South, beginningfrom theStation of Dadouchos, as symbolic of the Ending andJudgment of the Worldby Fire. But also, the MysticCircumambulation commences by the Paths of ShinandResh, as though bringing into action the SolarFire; while the ReverseCircumambulation commencesbeside those of Qoph and Tzaddi as though bringingtheWatery Reflux into action.< 107 >The Order of the Mystic Circumambulation. Firstcomes Arm bis, the Watcherwithin; next Thmaest, theGoddess of the Hall of Truth; then Horns; thentheGoddesses of the Scales of the Balance, then Members,if the Hall be largeenough, and at the end the WatcherWithout, Sentinel. It is as though a giganticWheelwere revolving, as it is said: “One Wheel upon Earthbeside the Kerub.” TheName of the Sphere of thePrimum Mobile, Rashith ha-Gilgalim, signifies theheadsor beginnings of Whirling Motions or Revolu-tions. Of this Wheel in the MysticCircumambulation,the ascending side begins from below the Pillar ofNephthys, andthe descending side from below thePillar of Isis; but in the ReverseCircumambulation,the contrary.Now the nave or axis of this Wheel is about the In-visible Station ofHarpocrates — as though that God,in the Sign of Silence were there placedaffirming theConcealment of that Central Atom of the Wheel, whichalone revolvesnot.The Mystic Circumambulation is called symbolic ofthe Rise of Light and from itis drawn another formulafor the circulation of the breath. It is the formula oftheFour Revolutions of the Breath (not, of course, of theactual air inspired,but of the subtle Aethers which maybe drawn thence and of which it is theVehicle — theaethers which awaken centres in the subtle bodythrough theformula). This formula should be precededby that of the Middle Pillar, describedpreviously. Bythis method, having invoked the Power you wish toawaken inyourself, and contemplated it, begin its cir-cumambulation thus: Fill the lungsand imagine theName vibrating in the contained Air. Imagine this vi-brationgoing down the left leg to the sole of the leftfoot — thence passing over to thesole of the right foot— up the right leg to the lungs again, whence itisout-breathed. Do this four times to the rhythm of theFour-fold breath. (Note:In this connection read verycarefully the section in Volume 4, entitled The Four< 108 >Serpent Formulae of the Four Aces of the Tarot. Somehint may be there gleaned ofthe relation of the breathto the Macrocosmic forces,—I.R.)The Object of the Mystic Circumambulation is toattract and make the connectionbetween the DivineLight above and the Temple. Therefore the Hierophantdoes notquit his post to take part therein, but remainsthere to attract by his Sceptrethe Light from beyondthe Veil. Each member in passing gives the Sign oftheEnterer, thus projecting the Light forward on his Pathfrom East to West, ashe receives it from the Hiero-phant’s Throne. Horus passes only once, for he istheSon of Osiris and inherits the Light by birthright fromhim. Therefore he goesat once to his station to fixthe Light there. Thmaest, the Goddess of Truth,passestwice because her rule is of the Balance of the TwoScales, and she retiresto her Station between the Pillarsthere to complete the reflex of the MiddleColumn. TheWatcher Within and the rest circumambulate thrice asaffirming thecompletion of the Reflection of the Per-fecting of the White Triangle of theThree Supernalsupon the Altar.Then follows the Adoration of God the Vast One, theLord of the Universe — atwhich again all give the Signof the Enterer, the Sign of the Projection of theForceof the Light. Then only does the Watcher declare thatthe Sun has arisen andthat the Light shineth in Dark-ness. Now comes the Battery of the ® = GO Grade—the single knock of Hierophant repeated by Hiereus andHegemon. This affirms theestablishment of the WhiteTriangle and therefore the Completion of theOpeningCeremony. The Mystic Words \"Khabs Am Pekht”which accompany the knocksseal the image of theLight. Their significance imples, by variousQabalisticmethods of analysis, as well as by a certain reading ofthe Coptic andEgyptian hieroglyphics, “Light in Ex-tension” or “May Light be extended inAbundance uponyou.”< 109 >Konx Om Pax is the Greek corrupted pronunciationof this, put here to link itwith its right origin.The Grade of Neophyte has 0 or the Circle for itsNumber, as if hiding all thingsunder the negative sym-bol. This is placed within a circle and a squarecon-nected by equal lines, as if affirming the hidden qualityof their origin inKether where all things are One, andthe consequent Universal application of theSecretFormulae.Diagram 22WANDS OF THE CHIEFS ON DAISJMPERATOR-CjallowPicture #55 [images/img_0055.png]PRAEMONSTRATOR/ Blue:R-<zd^,f$l u& QSack^.Ve/ 'goldQIuv'^CANCELLARIUS1....Qo/ci< IIO>Diagram 2$HIEROPHANT'S CLOAK AND WANDPicture #56 [images/img_0056.png]Picture #57 [images/img_0057.png]HEGEMON’S CLOAK AND WAND,k*dCLOAK AND SWORD OF HIEREUSPicture #58 [images/img_0058.png]< HI >Diagram 24SASH OF ORADFSHead-dress off OfficersBlack and white equalstriped Nemysses.Members maywearabove or plain ones;also Black Gown,Sash of Grade,Red Shoes.Cro w 4numh*r& IPicture #59 [images/img_0059.png]Picture #60 [images/img_0060.png]Picture #61 [images/img_0061.png]cross wb/fornumber? white ^oa h(ac K. \\numbtrs+croM (rad \\tnanqia w hit a jStapOS *nt/fr\\harj(whitof 1Picture #62 [images/img_0062.png]purpleqnz&n.Picture #63 [images/img_0063.png]zz51 ^50 ^28< H2>Picture #64 [images/img_0064.png]Diagram 25Picture #65 [images/img_0065.png]Picture #66 [images/img_0066.png]officers’ lamensHIEROPHANTJsSH1EREUS(ladurvarLDlack-KERUXSENTINELHEGEMONSTOLISTESDADOUCHOS< 113 >COPTIC NAMES OF THE CHIEFS AND OFFICERSVisible StationsImperator: Nephthys: Neoph-tho-osest.f^y^QycePraemonstrator: Isis: Ae-tsest _Cancellarius: Thoth: Tho-ooth Gcooir©Past Hierophant: Aroueris: Aroo-oueristApcorepL- £Hierophant: Osiris:Ae-shoo-rist, t^ujpHegemon: Thmae-st 0><Ah £,.Thmae-sh.

Visible Stations.2. Invisible Stations,The Visible Stations are the places of the Officers,each of whom has a specialastral shape suitable to theforces he represents.On the dais are places for the Three Chiefs, the PastHierophant and theHierophant. The order in whichthey sit (as you face East) is:Imperator Cancellarius HierophantNephthys Thoth OsirisPast Hiero. PraemonstratorAroueris IsisThe names below are those of the God-forms theyrepresent. The following are thedescriptions of theGod-forms of the seven Officers of the Neophyte Grade.Hierophant: Osiris in the Netherland. Expounder ofthe Mysteries in the Hall ofthe Dual Manifesta-tion of the Goddess of Truth.Hierophant is represented by two God-forms, thepassive and active aspects ofOsiris.

The Kerub of Air is formed behindHathor and she is a power ofHathor, and has the samegeneral colouring. She has a young girl’s countenanceandbehind her are spread large and shadowing wings.The Kerub of Fire is in the South beyond the seat ofDadouchos. It is a power ofthe Great Goddess Thar-pesh, and has the face and form of a Lion with largeandclashing wings. The colouring is very lively andflashing Leo green with ruby andflame-blue and Em-erald green.The Kerub of Water is formed behind Hiereus andis a power of the Great God Toumor Tmu. It has theface and form of a great Eagle with large and glisten-ingwings. The colours are mostly blue and orange withsome green.< tzi >The Kerub of Earth is in the North behind the Seatof Stolistes. It is a power ofthe Great God Ahapshiand has the face and form of a Bull with heavy dark-eningwings, and the colours are black, green, red, withsome white.These forms are not described in detail. We are toimagine them there as greatstabilising forces whoseforms vary according to circumstances.3. The Children of Horus. These have their invisiblestations in the corners ofthe Hall. They are the guar-dians of the viscera of the human being — everypartof whom comes up for judgment in its right time andplace.Ameshet: The man-faced is in the North East. Hehas a blue nemyss banded withred, blue and black. Hisface is red and he has a black ceremonial beard.Roundthe shoulders of his white mummy shape are hands ofred, blue and black,three times repeated. He stands onred, blue and black with a border of green,white andyellow,Tmoomathph, the Jackal-faced, is in the South East.He has a black face withyellow linings to his pointedears.

Hehas a white mummy shapeand stands on blue, yellow and black, with a borderofgreen, yellow, mauve.Kabexnuv: The Hawk-faced, is in the North West.He has a black and tawny face,and a nemyss of blackbordered with red, yellow, black. The same coloursappearthree fold, at his shoulders. He has a whitemummy shape and stands on red,yellow, and blackwith a border of green, mauve, white.Ahephi: The Ape-faced, is in the South West. Hehas a blue nemyss bordered withred, blue and yellowbands. These colours appear on his shoulders in the< 122 >same order. His face is red; and he stands on red, blue,and yellow, with aborder of green, orange, and mauve.Note: Tmoomathaph is sometimes written Duamutef.Kabexnuv is sometimes writtenQebhsenef. Ahephi issometimes written Hapi. Ameshet is sometimes writtenMesti.4. The Forty-Two Assessors. These are not describedat all save to say that theymake the Sign of the En-terer as the Candidate is passed by them. TheyareWitnesses in the Judgment Hall of Osiris.< 123 >THE CANOPIC GODSTHE SYMBOLISM OK THE FOUR GENIIOF THE HALL OF THE NEOPHYTESBy G. H. Fratre SubSpeIn a Temple of the Grade of Neophyte, the FourGods, Ameshet, Ahephl, Tmoumathph,Kabexnuf, saidalso to be Vice-gerants of the Elements, and answeringto theRivers of Eden as drawn in the Warrant of theTemple, are said to rule in thefour Corners of theHall between the Stations of the Kerubim.In Egyptian Mythology, these Gods are also said tobe the Children of Horus, andto partake of his sym-bology. If now, we regard the Neophyte Ceremonyasrepresenting the entrance into a new life, Regeneration— Mors Janua Vitae —the Egyptian symbology where-in that idea was so dearly and exactly workedoutbecomes important. Bear in mind that a new life meansa new plane or a higherworld, a passing, say, from theKether of Assiah to the Malkuth of Yetzirah.Now as behind Kether depend the Veils of the Nega-tive Existence, Ain, Ain Sophand Ain Soph Aour, sothrough Negative Existence must pass the Soul thatgoes fromAssiah to Yetzirah, or vice-versa. This processis illustrated by the NeophyteCeremony as describedin Z-3., and as seen by the clairvoyant eye. InEgyptianmythology, the Dead, when the Ceremonies are com-plete, the Soul weighedand passed, the Body mummiedand preserved from corruption, became one withOsiris,and is called an Osirian. Hence, the Hierophant, whorepresents Osiriswhen the Candidate is placed in theNorth, speaks to him in the character of hisHigherSoul — “The Voice of my undying and Secret Soul saidunto me’' etc.Osiris, however, is a mummied form, and the bodyof the Egyptian dead was mummiedat this part ofthe Ceremony. Let us now consider the nature of the< 124 >body which is mummied. The body itself may be con-sidered as a vehicle wherebythe life forces act, andthe medium whereby these life-forces act is whataretermed the Vital organs. Withdraw or destroy any ofthese, and the life ceasesto function in that body. Notless important, then, than the body itself, thevehicleof the Soul, are the Organs, the media for the actionof organic life, andit is equally important to preservethese from corruption, yet not together withthe body.For as the body of Osiris was broken up, so must thebody of the Osirianbe divided. This is the meaning ofthe viscera being preserved apart from thebody.The death and resurrection of Christ has other sym-bology and the teachingsbelong to a higher Grade. Letnone therefore object that His Body was laid intheTomb entire. (The Body of Osiris was first laid in theChest or Pastos whole.The division into 14 parts wassubsequent. N. B. r plus 4 — 5, the five wounds.)Foreven as Yod Ileh Vav Heh must be known before YodHeh Shin Vav Heh can becomprehended, and as Mosesmust precede Christ, so must the Mysteries ofOsirisfirst be known.Now the Guardian of the Hall and of the Neophytesagainst the Qlippoth (whoseKether is Thaumiel, theDual or Two-headed One, the Demons of Corruptionanddisintegration) is the Hiereus or Horus, and tothe Children of Horus, whopartake of his symbology,are the viscera committed, to guard them againstthedemons of disintegration and corruption. As the ele-ments and the forces ofthe Elements are to the world,so are the vital organs and the Life whichanimatesthem to the human body. Appropriately, then, are thevital organs and thelife which animates them, placedunder the charge of the Vice-gerents of theElements,the Children of Horus, the Great Gods Ameshet,Ahephi, Ttoumathph andKabexnuf, who regulate theirfunctions in material life, and guard them afterso-calleddeath, when the man that was has become an Osirian.Consider then, what are these vital organs and their< 125 >functions. Broadly they may be divided into the ali-mentary system and thecirculatory system, for in thisclassification we take no account of the brain orrepro-ductive organs which belong to another classification,and are notElemental nor concerned in the mainte-nance of the life of the material body.Each of these divisions may be further divided intothat which divides ordistributes to the body — thatwhich is needed for life, and that which casts outfromthe body and renders to the Qlippoth that which isunnecessary or pernicious.From this arises a four-folddivision as in the following diagram:A. C.AlimentarySystemPowers that divideand distributePowers that cast outCirculatorySystemB.D.With this Key, the division becomes easy, for in theAlimentary System, thestomach and the upper intes-tines divide the food taken into the system by aprocesscalled digestion, and by assimilation retain what isnecessary. Thistherefore is “A” in the diagram. Butthe lower intestines receive and cast outthat which isrejected, these therefore will be represented by “B”.In thecirculatory system, the heart is the organ whichdistributes the blood which itreceives washed andpurified by the lungs. Hence the lungs and heartarerepresented by UC”. The matter rejected from the cir-culatory system isrejected and cast forth by the liverand gall-bladder, which therefore will berepresentedby “D”Now as to the treatment of these vital organs in theprocess of mummification.Seeing that during life theywere under the guardianship of the Great Godsmen-tioned, so in death they were dedicated each to one< 126 >of these, who w'ere the four Genii of the Under-world,or the Lesser Gods of theDead.j’hese vital organs then, being taken out and sepa-rately embalmed, were placedin egg-shaped recepta-cles, symbolic of Akasa, under the care of Canopus,thePilot of Menelaus, and the God of the Waters of Cre-ation, the Eternal Sourceof Being, whose symbol wasa jar; and under the especial protection of that oneofthe Genii of the Underworld or Vice-gerents of theElements to whom thatparticular organ was dedicated.Hence each egg-shaped package was enclosed in ajarwhose lid was shaped like the head of that especial God.Now Ameshet was also termed “The Carpenter” forhe it is who by the medium of hisorgan, the Stomach,frames the rough materials and builds up the structureof thebody; to him the Stomach and Upper Intestineswere dedicated (A).Ahephi was also termed “The Digger” or “Burier”for he puts out of sight orremoves that which is uselessor offensive in the body, and to him the LowerIntes-tines or Bowels were dedicated (B).Ttoumathph was also called “The Cutter” or “Divi-der”for he divides anddistributes the blood bearingwith it the Prana and the Subtle Ether by theHolyScience of Breath brought into the body, and to himwere the lungs or heartdedicated (C).Kabexnuf was termed “The Bleeder” for as a streamof blood is drawm from thebody, so is a stream of im-purity drawn from the blood, and cast out intothedraught by the action of the Liver and Gall-Bladder,and to him therefore,these organs were dedicated (D).These jars were called Canopic Jars and were dis-posed in a certain order roundthe Mummy. Considernow, the points of the compass to which they wouldnaturallybe attributed. Reason itself will insist thatthe organs of the AlimentarySystem, the most materialand earthy, should be in the North, and the warmandvital heat of the Circulatory System should be to theSouth, while in thecross division, the Receptive and< 127 >distributive organs should be placed to the East, thesource of Life and Light,and the organs that purifyand cast out should be to the West that borders ontheQlippoth.This gives us the following arrangement:EastAmeshet:(Stomach andUpper Intestines)lVTnrthTtoumathph:(Heartand Lungs)i l U1 111A hephi:11 J L- 1Kabexmuv:(LowerGall-Bladder)Intestines)(Liver andWest-SouthYet this arrangement, would, as it were, symbolisethe entire separation of theAlimentary System and theCirculatory System, which is contrary to Nature,forthey continually counter-change, and thus arises Life.Wherefore in the Hallof the Two Truths, the portionsof Ahephi and Kabexnuf are reversed, and theorderbecomes.East — Ameshet. South — TtoumathphNorth—Kabexnuf West — AhephiNow these, being thus arranged, do partake of thesymbology of the elements towhich they belong. ForAmeshet being to the East, the quarter of Air, has theheadof a Man. Ttoumathph, to the South, has thehead of a Jackal who is the purveyorof the Lion (forthese are the Vice-Gerents of the Elements, while theKerubim arethe Lords thereof); so Ttoumathph isproperly a jackal. Kabexnuf in the West, inthe regionof Water, has the form of a Hawk, the subordinate formto the AlchemicEagle of Distillation, and the form also,of Horus, the Hicreus, beside whom ishis station, andof whose symbology he partakes.< 128 >Aliephi in the North, has the head of an Ape. Thesymbology of the Ape in AncientEgypt is very com-plex. Here it may be taken that while Apis, theBull,represents the Divine Strength of the Eternal Gods,the Ape represents theElemental Strength which isfar inferior and blended with cunning, Ahephi,however,has other symbology and other attributes. For by rea-son of thefertilising qualities of the Nile and of thefact that what is brought down bythe Nile as refusefrom the Land of the Sacred Lakes is, to Egypt, itslife andthe source of its fertility, so there arises a cor-respondence between the Nileand the lower intestines,and both are under the care of Ahephi (Hapi) whothuswas worshipped as Nilus, and in this connectionhe has for his symbol, ahead-dress of Lotus Flowers.Now, further, the Alimentary System is under thespecial guardianship of Isis andNephthys. Isis whoconquers by the pow'er of Wisdom and the forces ofNature,guards Ameshet. And Nephthys who hidesthat which is secret, guards Ahephi —whence also,until recent days, in the fulness of Time, the sacredsources ofAhephi, the Nile, were kept secret from thewhole world.Ttoumathph is under the guardianship of Neith, theDawn. This is the CelestialSpace, who makes the Morn-ing to pass and awakes the Light of a Golden Dawninthe Heart of Him whom the Eternal Gods shallchoose, by the Sacred Science of theBreath.Kabexnuf is guarded by Sekhet, the Sun at the West-ern Equinox, the Opening ofAmenti, who wears theScorpion on her head—and these guardianships wereoftenpainted on the Canopic jars.When, therefore, the Candidate kneels at the footof the Altar, or where theCorpse lies on the Bier pre-paratory to the passing over the River towardstheWest, and the Sou! stands before Osiris, and the God-desses stand by andwatch while the Beam sways andthe decision is taken — then, the body of theCandi-date is, as it were, broken up as the body of Osiris was< 129 >broken, and the Higher Self stands before the place ofthe pillars, but the lowerself is in the invisible stationof the evil persona. Then is the Candidate nighuntodeath, for then, symbolically, his Spirit passes throughthe Veils of theNegative Existence, passing from theKether of Assiah to the Malkuth of Yetzirah.There-fore, unless the Genii of the Underworld were then pres-ent and directingtheir forces on the vita! organs, hemust inevitably die.Let their symbols then be represented in all opera-tions and formulae drawn fromthe symbolism of theHall of the Two Truths, for they are of theutmostimportance, but as their stations are Invisible, so shalltheir symbols beastral and not material.Thus shall perfect health of body be preserved, whichis of utmost importance inall magical working, andthus shall the lessons of the Hall of the Neophytesbeduly carried out in our daily life.< 130 >THE SYMBOLISMOF THEADMISSION OF THE CANDIDATETHE ADMISSION OF THE CANDIDATEThe Candidate is waiting without the Portal underthe care of the Sentinel —\"‘TheWatcher Without”—That is, under the care of the form of Anuhis of theWestsymbolically that he may keep off the ‘‘Dog-Faced Demons,” the opposers ofAnubis, who rise fromthe confines where matter ends, to deceive and dragdown theSoul, The Ritual of the 31st Path says: “Sinceever dragging down the Soul andleading it from sacredthings, from the confines of matter arise theterribleDog-Faced Demons never showing a true image untomortal gaze.”The Hierophant gives a single knock to announcethe just commencement of avibration in the Sphere ofSensation of the Candidate. He then states thatheholds the Dispensation from the G. H. Chiefs of theSecond Order, to affirmthat the effect of the ensuingCeremony upon the Candidate is only authorisedbythe Higher Powers for the purpose of Initiation whichshall ultimately lead tothe knowledge of his HigherSelf. He is admitted to the Grade of Neophytewhichhas no number, concealing the commencement of allthings under thesimilitude of no thing.The Hegemon, the representative of the Goddess ofTruth and Justice isconsequently sent to superintendthe preparation, symbolising that it is thePresider ofEquilibrium who is to administrate the process of Initi-ation, by thecommencement of the forces of equilib-rium in the Candidate himself, through thesymbols of< 131 >rectitude and self-control. But the actual preparationof the Candidate should beperformed by the Sentinel— the “Watcher Without”— to show that this prepa-rationmust be accomplished before the establishmentof equilibrium can occur.Therefore, does the Hegemonsuperintend the preparation rather than performitactually. A Triple Cord is bound round the body of theNeophyte, symbolisingthe binding and restriction ofthe lower nature. It is triple in reference to theWhiteTriangle of the Three Supernals. Then, also, are theeyes bandaged tosymbolise that the light of the mate-rial world is but darkness and illusioncompared withthe radiance of the Divine Light, The preparation alsorepresents acertain temporary binding and restrictionof the natural body.The Hierophant, being a Member of the SecondOrder and therefore initiated intothe Secret Knowledgeof the symbolism, shall, together with any OfficersandMembers also of the Inner Order, remember what tre-mendous Gods and Goddessesthey represent — theDivine Forces of the Eternal in the administration oftheUniverse. The Ritual should be read in a loud, clear,stern and solemn voice soas to impress the Candidatewith the solemnity of the occasion. In this, thereshouldbe no foolish nervousness or hesitation, but the Ritualas performed by aninitiated Hierophant should becomein his hands something more than this.Thus should he act. Let hint remember what partic-ular God he represents.Exalting his mind unto thecontemplation thereof, let him think of himself as avastfigure, standing or moving in the likeness of that God,colossal, his headlost in the clouds, with the light flash-ing round it from the head-dress of theGod — his feetresting upon Earth in darkness, thunder and rollingclouds, and hisform wrapped in flashes of lightning —the while vibrating the Name of the God.Thus stand-ing, let him endeavour to hear the voice of the Godwhom he representsand of the God-Forms of the otherofficers as previously explained.< 132 >Let him speak, then, not as if unto an assembly ofmortals but as to an assemblyof Gods. Let his voicebe so directed as to roll through the Universe totheutmost confines of space. Let the Candidate representunto him, as it were, aw'orld whom he is beginning tolead unto the knowledge of its governing Angel. Asitis written “The lightning lighteneth out of the Eastand shineth even unto theWest, even so, shall thecoming of the Son of Man be.”The Candidate during the Ceremony is addressed asChild of Earth, as representingthe earthly or terrestrialnature of man — he who comes forward from thedark-ness of Malkuth to endeavour to regain the knowledgeof the Light. This iswhat is meant by the speech ofthe Hegemon, because the Path of the Initiate isbutdarkness and foolishness to the natural man. The singleknock given by theHegemon without the door repre-sents the consenting will of the natural man toreceivethe force formulated by the Hierophant, and is answeredby the Keruxwithin as if a witness were confirmingthe same. This being done, the Kerux, as awitness,demands authority from the Hierophant to admit theCandidate into theHall of Truth and Justice. The Hier-ophant, in granting the permission, sealsthe Candidatewith a new name given to the physical body of the out-ward man, butsignifying the aspirations of his Soul.As a consequence of the affirmation ofthe Motto asthe Name of the Candidate in the Hall of Truth, Osirisat once sendsforward the Goddess of the Scales of theBalance to baptise him with Water andthe companionGoddess to consecrate him with Eire. As it is written“Unless a manbe born of Water and of the Spirit, heshall in no wise enter the Kingdom ofHeaven,”The Kerux instantly bars the Candidate’s passageto mark that though he has beenadmitted, the naturalman of unpurified desires cannot be a dweller in theHall ofTruth. The Goddesses of the Scales immediatelypurify and consecrate him, whichoperation calls intoaction the forces of the Pillars in his own sphere of< *33 >sensation. This is the first of four consecrations becausewhen the Pillars ofthe Tree are projected onto theSphere of Sensation there are four pillars, ofwhich theMiddle Pillar is the axis. (Note: This idea is elaboratedmore clearlyand at greater length in the AstronomicalView of the Tarot, in Book Eight.Volume 4.—I. R.)At this point of the Ceremony, the astral appearanceof the Candidate is that ofa form wrapped in darknessas if extinguished thereby, and having unto hisrightand unto his left the faint semblance of the Two GreatPillars of Fire andof Cloud, whence issue faint rays intothe Darkness which covers him. Immediatelyabovehis sphere of sensation there will appear a ray of brightlight as ifpreparing to penetrate the darkness coveringhim. The result of this will be thatthe Candidate, dur-ing the whole of the ceremony of Admission, willusuallyappear to be somewhat automatic and vague.The reception and consecration take place symbol-ically in the darkest part ofMalkuth. The moment thisis finished, the Candidate is conducted to the footofthe Altar, that is under the citrine part of Malkuthwhich receives the impactof the Middle Column. Now,the Hegemon throughout the Ceremony acts asguide,prompter and answerer for the Candidate. His officetoward the Candidate isanalogous to that of his HigherSoul — w'herefore also, the Hegemon holds in hishandthe mitre-headed sceptre to attract, since it is the scep-tre of Wisdom, theHigher Self of the Candidate,At this moment, as the Candidate stands before theAltar, as the simulacrum ofthe Higher Self is attracted,so also arises the form of the Accuser in the placeof theEvil Triad. This similarly attracts the simulacrum ofthe Evil Persona ofthe Candidate — and were it notfor the power of the 42 lettered name in thePalacesof Yetzirah (the Gods of which name are usually calledthe “GreatAssessors of Judgment”) the actual evilPersona would at once formulate and beable to obsessthe Ruach of the Candidate. For, seeing that at thistime, thesimulacrum of the Higher Soul is attracting< 134 >the Neschamah of the Candidate, the human will isnot as powerful in the Ruachfor the moment, becausethe Aspirant of the Mysteries is now, as it were,divided.That is, his Neschamah is directed to the contemplationof his HigherSelf attracted by the Hegemon. His natu-ral body is bound and blinded, his Ruachthreatened bythe simulacrum of the Evil Persona attracted by Omoo-Szathan, and aspecies of shadow of himself thrownforward to the place of the Pillars, wherethe Scalesof Judgment are set. At the same time that the firstconsecrationestablishes a semblance of the Pillars tohis right and left, it also has drawnforth from him asemblance of himself to the place vacated by the Hege-monbetween the Pillars. (That is, the ceremony inducesa species of schizophrenia sothat the initiation may beeffected. But see Jung’s Commentary to “The Secretofthe Golden Flower,” and also my book on alchemy“The Philosopher’s Stone.”—I. R.)Here then stands the shadow of the Candidate whilethe Scales of the Balanceoscillate unseen. Unseen alsoand colossal, there is imaged before him Tho-oth,asMettatron, in the Sign of the Enterer of the Threshold,ready, according to thedecision of the human will, topermit or withhold the descent of the LowerGeniusof the Candidate.Meanwhile, the Great Assessors of Judgment exam-ine into the truth of theaccusations formulated by theEvil and averse antithesis. The Assessors ofJudgmentcome not under the head of invisible stations, but dur-ing theObligation and circumambulation of the Candi-date, until he is brought to theLight, they hover imme-iately about the limits of the Temple and theirevilantithesis immediately below. Therefore, when the Can-didate stands beforethe Altar before the Obligation, isthe decision actually taken by the human willof theCandidate. Rarely in his life has he been nearer death,seeing that he is,as it were, disintegrated into his com-ponent parts. The process of symbolicjudgment takesplace during the speech of the Hierophant to the Candi-< 135 >date, the answer of the Hegemon and his consent totake the Obligation.The moment the Candidate thus consents, the Hiero-phant advances between thePillars as if to assert thatthe Judgment is concluded. He advances by theinvisi-ble station of Harpocrates to that of the Evil Triad,which hesymbolically treads down, so that as Arouerishe stands upon the Opposer. He thencomes to the Eastof the Altar, interposing between the place of the EvilTriadand the Candidate. At the same time, the Hiereusadvances on the Candidate’sleft, the Hegemon on hisright, thus formulating about him the symbol oftheHigher Triad before he places his hand upon the symbolof the Three Supernalsupon the Altar. Again, beforedoing so, he has been bidden to kneel in adorationofthat symbol, as if the natural man abrogated his willbefore that of the DivineConsciousness.As he kneels in the presence of the Triad of Aroueris,Thmaa-est and Horus, heplaces his left hand in thatof his Initiator as affirming his passive receptionofthe Ritual, but his right hand is on the white triangleas symbolising hisactive aspiration towards his HigherSelf. His head is bowed as representing thevoluntarysubmission of the human will to the Divine — and forthis latter reasonhe repeats in the Obligation his namein the outer world.The Hierophant gives one knock, affirming that thesubmission unto the higher isperfect. Only at thismoment, does the invisible and colossal figure of Tho-othcease to be in the Sign of the Enterer and give theSign of Silence, permittingthe first real descent of theGenius of the Candidate, w'ho descends to theinvisiblestation of Harpocrates as a witness of the Obligation.The Hiereus and the Hierophant return to theirThrones, and therefore it is notAroueris, but Osirishimself that addresses the speech to the Candidate —“TheVoice of my Higher Self,” etc., which confirms thefink established between theNeschamah and the Geniusby formulating the conception thereof into the Ruach.< I36 >For this, Osiris speaks in the character of the HigherSoul, the symbolic form ofwhich is standing betweenthe columns before him. The affirmation of theHigherSoul as the God of the man does not mean that this isthe only God, butrather that it is the only present-ment of him which the natural man can graspat all.Neither is it just to say that the Higher Soul is onewith God, seeingthat the part is by no means the whole,nor can the whole be accurately andsufficiently de-scribed as an assemblage of parts. Let not the reverencefor theGod of thy self cause thee by a misconceptionto lose thy reverence for the Godswrho live for ever —the Aeons of Infinite Years. Herein is a great error andonewhich may, in its ultimatum bring about the fallof the Genius, a sin whichentails none the less terribleconsequences because it is a sign of the higherplanewhere the choice is not between good and evil but be-tween the higher andthe lower forms of good.Therefore is the Mystic Circumambulation in thePath of Darkness led by the Keruxwith the symboliclight, as formulating that the Higher Soul is not theonlyDivine Light but rather a spark from the IneffableFlame —and the Kerux, in histurn, is but the Watcherof the Gods. After the Kerux comes the Hegemon,thetranslator of the Higher Self, leading the Candidate;and then come theGoddesses of the Scales of the Bal-ance, the Stolistes and the Dadouchos. Theymove onceround; the formation in darkness of the Binah angleof the WhiteTriangle of the Three Supernals. The Hier-ophant knocks once as they pass him inaffirmation ofMercy — the Hiereus in affirmation of Severity; andthe invisibleAssessors each give the Sign of the Entereras the Candidate passes on his way.At the second pass-ing of the Hierophant, the knock affirms the commence-ment ofthe angle of Chokmah.The Kerux bars the Candidate’s approach to theWest to mark that the natural mancannot obtain theunderstanding of even the Son of Osiris unless by puri-ficationand equilibrium. Again is the Candidate puri-< 137 >fied and consecrated, the Piiiars about his Sphere ofSensation being renderedmore manifest. After this sec-ond consecration, the Candidate is allowed toapproachthe place of “The Twilight of the Gods” and for a briefspace thehood-wink is slipped up, to present a glimpse,but a glimpse only, of the Beyond.In the challenge ofthe Hiereus to know the Name is signified the knowl-edge ofthe formula. For if the formula of Horus be notwith the Candidate, that ofOsiris cannot be grasped.But to the Candidate the power of Horus as yet canonlyappear as a terrible and incomprehensible force —“The Force of the Avenger ofthe Gods”, whence thespeech of the Hegemon for him. The Candidate cannotas yetcomprehend that before Mildness can be exer-cised rightly, the forces ofSeverity and Mercy must beknown and wielded, but to accomplish this thegreatestcourage and energy is required and not hysterical weak-ness and absenceof resolution in action. Hence in theanswer of the Hiereus is an affirmation ofthe necessityof courage and of the danger of fear, and he gives oneknock to sealthe vibration of that force imaged in theCandidate’s sphere of sensation.The next barring and consecration of the Candidateis an extension of theprevious one and the commence-ment of the formulation of the angle of Kether.Thehood-wink is again slipped up giving a still furtherglimpse of the nature ofthe Divine Light, though to themind of the Candidate, an imperfect one.Therefore itis to him, as expressed in the answer of the Hegemon,a light dimlyseen through the Darkness, yet heraldinga Glory beyond. The speech of theHierophant formu-lates the forces of the hidden central pillar. After this,theCandidate passes to the Altar of the Universe, whichreceives the influences ofthe three Pillars, as thoughthen the Ray from the Divine would descend intothedarkness of the mind, for then, but not till then, is hefitted to realisewhat are the first things necessary tothe “Search for the Shining Light.”The Hierophant now leaves his Throne and passes< 138 >between the Pillars, either halting there during theprayer or halting at theplace of Harpocrates, or thatof the Evil Triad, or East of the Altar. It doesnot par-ticularly matter which, but one of them may seem moreappropriate to aparticular candidate than another andthe Hierophant will usually find that hehalts at theright place instinctively.The Hiereus stands on the left of the Candidate, theHegemon on his right, thusforming the Triad of theSupernals. The Kerux, Stolistes and Dadouchos repre-sentan inferior and supporting Triad behind him as ifthey affirmed that he haspassed the Judgment of theBalance. It is best, though not absolutelynecessary,that the Hierophant and the Hiereus should hold theirBanners. In anycase, it should be done astrally.The Higher Self of the Candidate will be formulatedin the invisible station ofHarpocrates behind the Hier-ophant, who in his present position is Aroupris.TheHierophant gives a single knock to seal the matter andthen invokes the Lordof the Universe. 'I'hen only !sthe hood-wink removed definitely.The Hierophant, Hiereus, and Hegemon join sceptresand sword above theCandidate’s head, thus formu-lating the Supernal Triad, and assert his receptionintothe Order. They recite the mystic words to seal thecurrent of the FlowingLight.The Higher Self remains in the station of Harpo-crates, and at this point, thespirit-vision should ■ seea gleaming white triangle formulated over theCandi-date’s head.The Hierophant now calls forward the Kerux, cau-tioning the Candidate that theLight has preceded himwithout his knowledge. It represents to him here, avagueformulation of ideas which as yet he can neithergrasp nor analyse. This Light isnot a symbol of hisHigher Self, but a Ray from the Gods to lead himthereto.Only after having thus been brought to the Light isthe Candidate led to the Eastof the Altar — the place< 139 >of the station of the Evil Triad — to affirm that withthis Light he will be ableto cast out and trample onhis own Evil Persona which, when it has been put initsplace, will then become a support to him. It is tothe Hiereus, “The Avenger ofthe Gods” therefore, thatthe duty of entrusting the Candidate with thesecretsigns, etc., is delegated. It is he who places him for thefirst timebetween the Pillars and superintends his finalconsecration — thus bringing thepeculiar force in mat-ter of the Hiereus to the aid of the Candidate, so thathemay more safely and resolutely combat the tempta-tions of the Evil Persona.The Hierophant has returned to his Throne whilethe Hegemon holds the insignia ofthe Hiereus while heconfers the Signs, etc. She thus affirms the necessity oftheforce represented by the Hiereus to the Candidate.The Hierophant on the Throne, the Hiereus East ofthe Black Pillar and theHegemon East of the WhitePillar again form a Triad which here represents there-flection of the Three Supernals. The Higher Soul isformulated between thePillars in the Place of Equilib-rium. The Candidate is in the place of the EvilTriadand the Hiereus now advances to the place of Harpoc-rates between thePillars to give the words.After the giving of the words and signs, the Hiereusdraws the Candidate forwardbetween the Pillars andfor the second time in the Ceremony, the HigherSoulstands near and ready to touch him. The Hiereus re-turns to his place Eastof the Black Pillar so that theThree Chief Officers may formulate and draw' downtothe Candidate, by their insignia, and the influence oftheir symbols, theforces of the Supernal Triad. It isimportant, therefore, that at this point,they shouldbe in these places.The Candidate now stands between the Pillars, boundwith a rope like the mummiedform of Osiris, betweenIsis and Nephthys. The final Consecration now takesplaceby the Goddesses of the Scales of the Balance. TheCandidate stands for the firsttime during the Cere-< HO >mony at the point representing the equilibrium of thebalance. Meanwhile, theKerux goes to the North, readyfor the circumambulation so as to link that withthefinal Consecration of the Candidate. The final Conse-cration is also demandedby the Hiereus — Horus, thepowerful Avenger of Osiris, as still menacing theEvilPersona of the Candidate. Its effect is to seal finally, inbalancedformation, the Four Pillars in the Sphere ofSensation of the Candidate. Thisdoes not imply thatthey were not naturally there before. But in the naturalman,the symbols are unbalanced in strength — somebeing weaker and some stronger. Theeffect of the Cere-mony is to strengthen the weak, to purify the strong,and sobegin to equilibriate them and at the same timemake a link between them and thecorresponding forcesof the Macrocosm.This being done, the Hierophant commands the re-moval of the Rope which hashitherto been purposelyretained, symbolically to restrain the actions of thenat-ural man, whose temptation is towards the Evil Per-sona.The Four Pillars being thus firmly established, theCandidate is invested withthe Badge of the White Tri-angle of the Three Supernals formulating inDarkness,Now, also, the Higher Self is enabled in reality to forma link withhim, if the human will of the natural manbe in reality consenting thereto. Thefree-will of thenatural man is never obsessed either by the Higher Sou!or by theCeremony, but, the will consenting, the wholeof the Ceremony is directed tostrengthening its action.As the badge is placed upon him, it is as if thetwoGreat Goddesses, Isis and Nephthys, stretched forththeir wings over Osiris torestore him again to life.The Mystic Circumambulation follows in the Pathof Light to represent the risingof Light in the Candi-date, through the operation of self-sacrifice. As hepassesthe Hierophant’s throne the red Calvary Crossis astraHy formed above the astralWhite Triangle onhis fore-head, so that so long as he belongs to the Order,< Hi >he may bear that potent and sublime symbol as a linkwith his Higher Self and asan aid in searching out theforces of the Divine Light — if he will.The Higher Soul or Genius now returns to the invisi-ble station of Harpocrates,the place of the hiddenCentre, yet continuing to retain the link formed withtheCandidate. The address of the Hierophant is in-tended simply to effect thedistinct formulation of thesymbols of the ® — E Grade of Neophyte in theCandi-date, and it is therefore only when this is finished thatthe WatcherAnubis announces that the Candidate hasbeen duly admitted as an initiatedNeophyte.The Hie reus is charged with a warning address asagain confirming the will ofthe Candidate and address-ing a final menace to the Evil Persona, TheHierophantthen states clearly what the Candidate must begin tostudy. He affirmsthat the symbols must be equilibri-ated in the sphere of sensation before a linkcan beformulated between them and the Forces of the Macro-cosm. The necessity ofexamination is insisted uponso that this may be completely done.The Kerux then pours out the two fluids to makethe semblance of blood. This isto fix in the Candidate’ssphere the symbols of the forces of transmutationinNature and also to make an astral link between theseand the Candidate’sphysical life, as a guard of thesecrecy of the Mysteries. This particular formof trans-mutation is used as showing the effect of a mixture offorces asproducing a third appearance totally differentfrom them. The red colour issymbolic of the blood ofthe Candidate. In the Ancient Mysteries, theCandi-date’s blood was actually drawn at this time and pre-served as an avenginglink in case of his proving un-worthy. Yet our transmutation effects the matterquiteas well, seeing that the astral link is firmly established.'I'he final speech of the Hierophant is further in-tended besides its apparentmeaning, to affirm that aperson only partially initiated is neither fitted toteachnor to instruct even the outer and more ignorant in< H2 >Sublime Knowledge. He is certain, through misunder-standing the principles, toformulate error instead oftruth.CLOSINGThe greater part of the closing ceremony is explainedby the opening. The ReverseCircumambulation, how-ever, is intended to formulate the withdrawal of theLightof the Supernal Triad from the Altar, so thatit may not be profaned by abidingwithout due guard.Not that the Divine Light would suffer thereby, butbecause itmight initiate an Avenging Current if pro-faned. This is what is implied by theLaw of Mosesin the prohibition about offering unconsecrated Fireeither before orwithin the Veil of the Tabernacle. Asa vibratory formula, the reverseCircumambulationrepresents the reversal of the current and the restora-tion ofthe Operator to his ordinary condition..The Mystic Repast then follows. It is a communionin the Body of Osiris. ItsMystic Name is “The Formulaof the Justified One,” and it is sufficientlyexplained inthe section concerning the Altar.The Kerux, in finishing, inverts the Cup, as theWatcher of the God, to show thatthe symbols of self-sacrifice and of regeneration are accomplished.Theproclamation is confirmed by the Hierophant and theChief Officers giving thethree strokes, emblematic ofthe Mystic Triad, and they repeat the Mystic Words.The Hierophant, in his final speech, seals the linkfirst formulated between theMembers and the Super-nal Triad for each one present that it may prove tohim orher, a guide for the ultimate attainment of theSupreme Initiation — if he will.THE SYMBOLISM AND MEANING OF THE STEP,SIGNS, GRIP OR TOKEN, AND THE WORDSThey have this three-fold interpretation:1. Apparent meaning.2. Spiritual or mystical reference.3. Practical application.< 143 >Each is therefore considered under three heads.The Step, (i) The foot is advanced about six inchesrepresenting the foot on theside of Chesed put forwardand taking a hesitating step in darkness—the leftfoot,to represent the power of Isis or the beginning of actionrather thanNephthys as the end thereof. The term6 inches is employed here only to render itmore intel-ligible to English Initiates. It means a convenient meas-ure of 6,and preferably 6 times the measure of thePhalanx of the thumb —Spirit and Will.2. It symbolises the beginning of the stamping downof the Evil Persona. The footis advanced 6 metricaldistances answering to the number 6 of Tiphareth— Osiris —alluding therefore to the self-sacrifice neces-sary to accomplish this,3. It represents the practical application of the be-ginning of a magical force.Let the Adept, in using theSign of the Enterer, give the step as he commencestheSign and let him imagine himself colossal, clothedwith the form of the God orGoddess appropriate tothe work — his head reaching to the clouds-—hisfeetresting upon Earth. And let him take the step as ifhe stamped upon the Earthand the Earth quakedand rocked beneath him. As it is said “Clouds andDarknessare round about Him — lightnings and thun-ders are the habitation of His feet,”Its secret name is“The Step of the Avenger.”THE SALUTING SIGN1. That of groping forward in search of truth.2. It represents the involution and bringing forwardof the Light into thematerial to aid the will of theCandidate in his search for and aspirationtowards theHigher.3. Standing as before described, in the form of theGod, and elevating the mindto the contemplation ofKether, take the step like a stroke with the foot,bringthe arms up above the head as if touching the Kether,< 144 >and as the step is completed bring the hands over thehead forwards. Thrust themout direct from the levelof the eyes horizontally — arms extended,fingersstraight, palms downwards, the hands directed towardsthe object it iswished to charge or to affect. At thesame time, sink the head till the eyes lookexactly be-tween the thumbs. In this way, the rays from the eyes,from eachfinger and from the thumbs, must all con-verge upon the object attacked. If anyof them dis-perse, it is a weakness.Thus performed, this Sign is a symbol of tremendousattacking force and ofprojection of will power, and itshould be employed in all cases where force ofattackis required — especially in charging of Talismans andthe like. Generally,it is best to have the thumbs andall the fingers extended — but if a particulareffect isdesired, you may extend only the fingers appropriatethereto, keepingthe rest folded back in the hand. Here-with also, may be combined theattribution of the Plan-ets to the head: (Mars to the right nostril, Mercurytothe Mouth, etc., as explained in the Microcosm Lec-ture), sending at the sametime an imaginary ray ofcolour of the Planet desired from the part of theheadattributed to it. But, when finished, be careful to with-draw the rays againor they will remain like so manyoutlets of astral force and thus exhaust you.The bestway to protect yourself against this is to give the Signof Silenceimmediately. For the first Sign should alwaysbe answered by the second. Thesecret names of theSaluting Signs are “The Attacking Sign” or “The Signof theEnterer of the Threshold.”THE SIGN OF SILENCE1. This is simply that of secrecy regarding the Mys-teries.2. It is the affirmation of the station of Harpocrates,wherein the Higher Soulof the Candidate is formu-lated in part of the admission Ceremony. It is thesym-< H5 >bol of the Centre and of the “Voice of the Silence”which answers in secret thethought of the heart.3. The Sign of Siience withdraws the force put outby the Sign of the Enterer.Take upon thyself as beforetaught the colossal form of the God Harpocrates.Bringthe left foot sharply back, both heels together— beatthe ground once withthe left foot as it is placed besidethe right. Bring the left hand to the mouthand touchthe centre of the lower lip with the left fore-finger. Closethe otherfingers and thumb, and drop the right handto the side. Imagine that a wateryvapor encircles andencloses you. This is the reflux of the current.This Sign is also used as a Protection against attack.The Sign represents aconcentration of astral lightabout the person. Having given the Sign as above,itis a protection against all attack and danger of obses-sion. To make it yetstronger, the form of the Godshould be taken. If Spiritual force is required,formu-late as if standing on a Lotus or rising from it. For forceincontemplation and meditation, formulate as if seatedupon a Lotus. But for morematerial force, as if stand-ing upon a Dragon or a Serpent like some statuesofHarpocrates. As a defence and protection, the Sign isas strong as theBanishing Pentagram, though of adifferent nature. And as the Sign of the Entererrepre-sents attack, so does this sign represent defence thereto,as a shield is adefence against the Sword. From thisSign is a formula of invisibility derived.(See Ritualin Part Six.—I. R.)The Secret Names of this Sign are: “The Sign of theGod of Silence” or the “Signof Defence or Protection.”It may be performed with any finger of either hand,butit is most protective when the left forefinger isused, the Water of Chesed, forthe fingers of the righthand represent more violent action, and those of theleftmore watery action. (If you have not a convenientimplement, a Sigil or aPentagram may be traced withany finger of any hand according to thecorrespondencerequired.)< 146 >It may here be remarked that the so-called ChristianSign of Benediction,consisting of the thumb and firsttwo fingers only, projected, is the affirmationof Osiris,Isis and Nephthys — or Spirit, Fire, and Water.With regard to taking on mentally the forms of theGods, it may here be notedthat the process is of greatassistance and use in all magical working, whetherofinvokation or of evocation, contemplation, meditation,skrying in the spiritvision, alchemy, etc. For the formsof the Gods do here represent a certainsymbolic mate-rial action of the Divine Forces.THE GRIP AND THE PASSWORD1. The steps are taken and the Grip exchangedsimultaneously. They mean seekingguidance in thedarkness and silence of the Mysteries.2. It shows that a steady and resolute will, actingin union with good, willaccomplish what it desires, nomatter how often it fail at first. It inculcatesthe neces-sity for harmony and brotherly love — of doing awaywith pettiness andof too much self-concentration —for allowances for the weaknesses of otherswithin limits— of shunning resolutely anything tn the nature ofslander. So thatin the grip of the Neophyte the Initi-ates meet hand to hand and foot to foot inthe truegreeting of a brother or sister, and not in the veiledhostility of anenemy. For, in the working of the Inner,where all invoke the same forces in thesame manner,he or she becomes unsympathetic with the rest, sepa-rates himself orherself from them, and though he weak-en the combination of working, yet hestill more cer-tainly attracts upon himself a reflex current from theAvengers ofEvil.The Name of the God of Silence which is the GrandWord of this Grade alsorepresents the silence of theSacred Mysteries to be observed towards theOuterOrder. It shows also the necessity for respect towardsthe secrets of anyFrater or Soror committed to your< 147 >care, not endeavouring to search them out for purposesof curiosity nor repeatingthem when discovered, norin any way referring to them so as to wound theother,nor in any way employing them as a means of causinghumiliation, but tokeep them as a sacred trust and notto be deflected by them from acting justlyand har-moniously together.3. In any magical ceremony, or other working, ifmore than one member be takingpart, all present, put-ting themselves into the form of the God as taught,shouldexchange Sign, Grip and Words, so as to estab-lish a current of harmony and theaffirmation of amutual direction of will towards the same object.THE PASSWORD1. Merely to guard the Secrets of the Order againstany Members resigned or notworking; hence changedeach Equinox,2. It is an affirmation of the different spiritual aswell as the differentphysical constitutions of the Can-didates— that all natures cannot be the samewithoutevil and injury resulting thereby—but that each na-ture should be broughtto its own Kcther — the bestof its kind. This too, may be done in all things. Itisthe basis of Alchemy,3. It should be pronounced as if attracting the SolarForce — the Light ofNature, during the 6 monthsfollowing the Equinox at which it is issued, as alinkwith the Solar Force, between that and the Order. Thispassword, therefore,may also be used in a magicalceremony as attracting the support of the LightofNature acting upon natural forces.THE CEREMONY OF THE EQUINOXThe whole formulae of the Ceremony of the Equinoxare intended to create amagical link between the Sun,as the Light of Nature, and the Order; and itshouldbe celebrated within 48 hours at least of the Sun’sactual entry into Ariesor Libra. The single knock givenby the Hierophant heralds the initiation of afresh cur-< 148 >rent. The Password, as already explained, is the symbolof the connecting link ofthe purpose of the Ceremonyand therefore, before beginning fresh operation toat-tract a fresh current, the Kerux proclaims that theformer password isabrogated. In the whole Ceremony,save at the exchange of Insignia, theHierophant, Hier-eus, Hegemon, Stolistes and Dadouchos remain in theirplaces —the Kerux, or Watcher of the Gods being theonly one who moves.First comes the establishment of a vertical currentin the direction of themiddle column by the exchangeof words between the Hierophant and theHiereus,while the Hegemon, who is in the whole Ceremony ofthe Equinox theimportant Officer, by reason of hisinsignia, seals and arrests the current inthe centre bya single knock and the words “I am the Reconcilerbetween them.”Then follows the cross current estab-lished between the Stolistes andDadouchos—again fixedand sealed by the Hegemon, thus symbolising theequi-lateral cross of the Elements (of which the centre wouldnaturally be aboutthe invisible station of Harpocrates)but is arrested by the Hegemon between theColumns.The cross currents are thus thrown into the image ofthe Calvary Cross ofthe Rivers to ally it with the sym-bolism of Tiphareth and of the Sephiroth.Then the Hierophant, Dadouchos. Hiereus and Sto-listes formulate a circleenclosing the symbol, which isagain sealed by the Hegemon. Then the Officers,beingcareful to follow the course of the Sun deposit in turn,their Insignia uponthe Altar, taking therefrom insteadthe mystical symbols of the Body of Osiriscorrespond-ing to their Cardinal Points. The Hegemon takes theLamp of Kerux. TheKerux then circumambulates,halting at the Cardinal Points and facing them,repre-senting the course of the Sun through the Zodiac inorder to attract theSolar Ray, but under the controlof its Superior, the Light of Osiris, and theadorationsare performed at the Stations of the Kerubim to markthe limits of theCircle,< 149 >This time, it is with the Lamp of the Watcher of theGods and with the Sign ofthe Calvary Cross of Tipha-reth that the Hegemon seals in the centre theSolarLight. The formal assertion of the entry of a new cur-rent of Light isproclaimed, and the Mystic Words arerecited to close the ceremony.From this Ceremony there are many practical formu-lae derivable which will beeasily comprehended bythe Z. A. M. who has mastered the whole of thislecture.Only let him remember that the formulae of the Cere-mony of the Equinoxrepresents the sudden attractionand sealing of a Force in Nature then inoperation —rather than a continuous and graduated ceremony tobuild up the same.Consequently also, it is well to usethe password then in being as an adjunct tothe otherNames employed in magical ceremonies as bringinginto operation the linkwith the Solar Light.NOTES ON THE OPENING EXORDIUM OF “z”The Great Tho-oth is the highest aspect of theHermes of the most ancientEgyptian Mysteries, andcorresponds almost to the Great Angel Metatron.

H. Frater S. R. M. D.In the Ritual of the Enterer are shadowed forth sym-bolically, the beginning ofcertain of the Formulae ofthe Magic of Light. For this Ritual betokeneth acer-tain Person, Substance or Thing, which is taken fromthe dark World ofMatter, to be brought under theoperation of the Divine Formulae of the Magic ofLight.Also herein are contained the commencements ofall formulas of Evocation, thedevelopment of wrhichis further shown in the Inner knowledge of the succeed-inggrades of the Outer Order. In the true knowledgeof the application of theSymbolism of the “Enterer”lies the entrance to the knowledge of PracticalMagic:and therefore are all the Formulae drawn from theRitual classed under Fiveseveral heads, according untothe Letters of the name Yeheshuah.For to the Letter Yod ' and the element of Firebelong the works of CeremonialMagic, as the evoca-tions of the Spirits of the Elements, etc.Unto the First Heh n the consecration and chargingof Telesmata, and theproduction of Natural Phenom-ena, as storms, earthquakes, etc.Unto the Great Holy Letter Shin v are allotted Threeclasses of works. Spiritualdevelopment, transforma-tions and invisibility.Unto the Letter Vau 1 Divination in all its branches;and the art of making theLink between the subjectof the work and the process of divination.And to the Final Heh n the works and operations ofthe Art of Alchemy, the orderof its processes andTransmutation.< 152 >FOREWORDBy Frater A. M. A. G.This document, which was presented to advancedmembers of the Zelator AdeptusMinor grade, listsunder the name of the Pentagrammaton several modesof magicalworking. It comprises, altogether, sevenformulae. For the first five of these, Ihave providedherewith examples of the appropriate kind of Ritualin order toenable the reader or student to form somenotion of their nature. They are notproduced herethat they may be slavishly followed, since they arepurely personalproductions. My motive in includingthem is only to assist the student as showinghim acompleted type of ceremony. The formula for SpiritualDevelopment so-called,is represented by two distinctrituals each quite different in structure, yetequallyefficacious in its own especial way. The Bootless Rit-ual, the second ofthe two, was reproduced in rudimen-tary form in my Tree of Life. Because of theexcellentdove-tailing of certain Order formulae and speecheswith the barbarouswords of the older Ritual, render-ing it in practice a magnificent and inspiringceremony,I have decided to republish it here so that interestedstudents mayobserve how older fragments may betreated.So far as the writer is concerned, the section on Divi-nation never acquiredmuch meaning, but it wasthought advisable to retain it in the event thatsignifi-cance may be seen in it by others. As an example ofthe first stages ofthat mode of operation, there isgiven an experience recorded many years ago byG. H.Frater Sub Spe, and to some it may prove suggestive.The section on Alchemyremains quite obscure sincethe subject does not interest me; and I regret thatIhave not been able to acquire a record of an operationbased on it. (N. B. Sincethis was written, my bookentitled The Philosophers Stone has been published.< 153 >It is a fairly protracted survey and analysis of alchem-ical ideology.—L R.)The Requiem Ritual is an original contribution,though based on fundamentalformulae, and I hopeit will be found useful.So far as the first sections on actual CeremonialMagic are concerned a fewremarks may seem appro-priate. Let it be noted first of all that a formalCircleand Triangle are required only in that type of opera-tion calledEvocation. It is preferable to paint thecircle and divine names on the floor oron canvas, oron a neutral coloured sheet of linoleum so that thecircle and namesappear brilliant and clear cut. Butfor convenience’ sake, and for quickerworking, it isuseful to lay out a circle in coloured tapes. The colournaturallywill depend on the nature of the ceremony.At the appropriate angles or quartersof this tapedcircle, pentacles or flashing Tablets of the requisiteDivine Namesor symbols may be placed.The other ceremonies, Consecration and Invisibilityfor example, require no suchdevice, for the performanceof the Banishing Rituals of the Pentagram andHexa-gram followed by the Consecrations—either as in theNeophyte Ceremony or asin the Opening by Watch-Tower— clears a space for working which isamplyprotected. This procedure suffices for most operations,though in Evocationthe greatest precautions and pro-tections are necessary, and these are affordedby thepresence of the Circle and Divine Names.A great deal of attention should be paid to that partof the ceremony demandingthe Invocation of the High-er. Success herein spells success for the entireceremony.That is, there should be a clear consciousness of thepresence of thedivine force coursing through the oper-ator. He should become aware of theawakening of atitanic force within him. It is an unmistakable sensa-tion. Sostrong and powerful can this become, that attimes it may almost seem to be aphysical one. If thisInvocation is slurred over or inconsequentially per-< 154 >formed, then a great deal of power must be expendedunnecessarily on theremaining parts of the ritual inorder to redeem the entire operation fromfailure. Andthe operation would suffer from the disadvantage ofhaving beeneffected by the human part of the magi-cian, instead of by his own HigherGenius. If the Vibra-tory formula of the Middle Pillar is verypowerfullyemployed, using the name appropriate to the operationon hand, and ifthe force thus invoked is distributedthroughout the Sphere of Sensation by theformulaeof the Mystic Circumambulation—both of which arefully described in Z. I,Book Five — then the chancesof success are great. It is imperative to stressthis pointfor it is my belief that the greater number of the casesof failure in,let us say, evocation are due solely tohastening past this important stage tothe actual andstated purpose of the ceremony. This haste causes fail-ure.Failure brings about disappointment in the form-ula as a whole. This is why solittle work has been doneon this particular system of Magic.In passing, may I say that before the Vibratory For-mula of the Middle Pillarcan be at all successfullyemployed, the student should have put in a greatdealof work on the exrecise called the Formulation of theMiddle Pillar. Thisexercise, described in the Portalpaper reprinted in Part One and at great lengthin mybook The Middle Pillar, awakens the magical centresin the psycho-spiritualmake-up of the student. Need-less to say, that without the power derived,directly orindirectly, from these Sephirotic centres or chakras,there can be nosuccessful Magic. When a certain amountof success has been obtained in thisformulation, thenthe vibratory formula should be assiduously practised.Itsresults are salutary — and quite apart from the spir-itual and psychic effect,which is that to be aimed at,its reaction incidentally on the physical healthandvitality is so marked as almost to be miraculous.The two important adjuncts to success in Ceremon-ial Magic are briefly theGod-form and the Vibration< 155 >of the Divine Name. The assumption of the appropri-ate form of the Egyptian God— or the TelesmaticImage especially built up by the imagination basedupon thesignification of the letters of the Name — andthe powerful vibration of the Nameitself by the Vibra-tory Formula of the Middle Pillar are bound, if allotherconditions are complied with, to yield salutaryresults. The symbolic God-formheld firmly in theimagination, the Name vibrated with great force —then thesubsequent invocations, and the gradual mate-rialisation or other manifestationof the force, requirepractically no effort. The most frequent mistake, andofcourse a natural one, is to concentrate upon thestated purpose of the operation.The type of Invocation of the Higher employed inmost of the ceremonies shownhere has no authorityobtaining within the Order. It is fundamentally theresultof my own spiritual bias. The Higher invocationsmore usually employed within theOrder approximate tothe nature of ordinary prayers. These, for many reasonsintowhich I do not wish to enter, do not please me.The procedure delineated above should of course befollowed in all other types ofceremonial—for the con-secration of Flashing Tablets and Talismans; andespe-cially in operations striving towards invisibility ortransformation is thesuccessful invocation of the divineforce necessary.One final word as to these ceremonies. The studentis not to assume that theseoperations in themselvesare important. That is, from the spiritual point ofview,the fact that the Magician can attain invisibility oreffect atransformation or a materialisation is relativelyunimportant. What does matterhowever, is that theseoperations comprise a discipline and a type of train-ingwhich is almost indispensable in the serious laboursof spiritual development.The student who has strug-gled with these formulae, and who has kept hisaspira-tion to the divine keen and untarnished, has a disci-plined and apowerful instrument at his command.< 156 >Index for general reference to the Enterer Ceremonyof the ® = 0 Grade1.

Pentacleformed of three concentric bands,name and sigiltherein, in proper colours, is to be bound thricewith a cord, andshrouded in black, thus bringinginto action a Blind Force to be furtherdirectedor differentiated in the Process of the Ceremony.Announcement aloud ofthe Object of the work-ing; naming the Spirit or Spirits, which it isdesired toevoke. This is pronounced standingin the centre of the Circle and turningtowardsthe quarter from which the Spirit will come.G—The Name and Sigil of the Spirit, wrapped in ablack cloth, or covering, is nowplaced within thecircle, at the point corresponding to the West,representing theCandidate. The consecration ofBaptism by water and fire of the Sigil thentakesplace, and the proclamation in a loud and firmvoice of the spirit (orspirits) to be evoked.H—The veiled Sigil is now to be placed at the foot ofthe Altar. The Magicianthen calls aloud the< 159 >Name of the Spirit, summoning him to appear,stating for what purpose the spiritis evoked:what is desired in the operation; why the evo-cation is performed atthis time, and finally sol-emnly affirming that the Spirit shall be evokedby theCeremony.I—Announcement aloud that all is prepared for thecommencement of the actualEvocation. If it bea good spirit the Sigil is now to be placed withinthe WhiteTriangle on the Altar, the Magicianplaces his left hand upon it, raises in hisrighthand the magical Implement employed (usuallythe Sword) erect; and commencesthe Evocationof the Spirit N., to visible appearance. The Ma-gician stands inthe Place of the Hierophantduring the Obligation, irrespective of thepartic-ular quarter of the Spirit.But if the nature of that Spirit be evil, thenthe Sigil must be placed withoutand to the Westof the White Triangle and the Magician shall becareful to keepthe point of the Magical Swordupon the centre of the Sigil.J—Now let the Magician imagine himself as clothedoutwardly with the semblance ofthe form of theSpirit to be evoked, and in this let him be care-ful not toidentify himself with the spirit, whichwould be dangerous; but only to formulateaspecies of mask, worn for the time being. And ifhe knows not the symbolic formof the Spirit,then let him assume the form of an Angel belong-ing unto the sameclass of operation, this formbeing assumed. Then let him pronounce aloud,with afirm and solemn voice, a convenient andpotent oration and exorcism of the Spirituntovisible appearance.At the conclusion of this exorcism, taking thecovered sigil in his left hand,let him smite itthrice with the flat blade of the Magic Sword.Then let him raiseon high his arms to their< 160 >utmost stretch, holding in his left hand the veiledsigil, and in his right theSword of Art erect. Atthe same time stamping thrice upon the groundwith hisright foot.K—The veiled and corded sigil is then to be placed inthe Northern part of theHall at the edge of theCircle, and the Magician employs the oration oftheHierophant, from the throne of the East,modifying it slightly, as follows: “Thevoice ofthe Exorcism said unto me, Let me shroud my-self in darkness,peradventure thus may I mani-fest myself in Light, etc.” The Magicianthenproclaims aloud that the Mystic Circumambu-lation will take place.L—The Magician takes up the Sigil in his left handand circumambulates the MagicCircle once,then passes to the South and halts. He stands(having placed thesigil on the ground) betweenit and the West, and repeats the oration oftheKerux. And again consecrates it with Water andFire. Then takes it in hishand, facing westward,saying, “Creature of , twice consecrate,thou mayest approach the gate of the West.”The Magician now moves to the West of theMagical Circle, holds the Sigil in hisleft handand the sword in his right, faces South West, andagain astrally maskshimself with the form ofthe Spirit, and for the first time partially opensthecovering of the Sigil, without however en-tirely removing it. He then smites itonce withthe flat blade of the sword, saying, in a loud,clear, and firm voice:“Thou canst not pass fromconcealment unto Manifestation, save by thevirtue ofthe Name Elohim. Before all things arethe Chaos and the Darkness, and the Gatesofthe Land of Night. I am He Whose Name isdarkness. I am the Great One of thePath of theShades. I am the Exorcist in the midst of theExorcism. Appear thoutherefore without fear< 161 >before me, so pass thou on.\" He then reveils theSigil.N—Take the Sigil to the North, circumambulating first,halt, place Sigil on theground, stand between itand the East, repeat the oration of the Kerux,againconsecrate with Fire and Water. Then takeit up, face North, and say “Creature ofthrice consecrate, thou mayest approach theGate of the East,”0—Repeat Section M in North East. Magician thenpasses to East, takes up Sigil inleft and Swordin right hand. Assumes the Mask of the Spiritform, smites theSigil with the Lotus Wand orSword, and says, “Thou canst not pass fromcon-cealment unto manifestation save by virtue ofthe name YHVH, After theFormless and theVoid and the Darkness, then cometh the knowl-edge of the Light.I am that Light which risethin the Darkness. I am the Exorcist in the midstofthe exorcism. Appear thou therefore in visibleform before me, for 1 am theWielder of theForces of the Balance. Thou hast known me now,so pass thou on tothe Cubical Altar of the Uni-verse!”P—He then recovers Sigil and passes to Altar, layingit thereon as before shown.He then passes to theEast of the Altar, holding the sigil and sword asalreadyexplained. Then doth he rehearse a mostpotent Conjuration and invocation of theSpiritunto visible appearance, using and reiteratingall the Divine, Angelic, andMagical Names ap-propriate to this end, neither omitting the signs,seals,sigils, lineal figures, signatures and the likefrom that conjuration.Q—The Magician now elevates the covered Sigil to-wards heaven, removes the veilentirely, leavingit yet corded, crying with a loud voice, “Creatureof long hast thou dwelt in darkness. Quitthe Night and seek the Day.” He then replaces< 162 >it upon the Altar, holds the Magical Sword erectabove it, the pommel immediatelyabove thecentre thereof, and says, “By all the Names,Powers, and Rites alreadyrehearsed, I conjurethee thus unto visible appearance.” Then theMystic Words.R—Saith the Magician, “As Light hidden in the Dark-ness can manifest therefrom,so shall thou be-come manifest from concealment unto manifes-tation.”He then takes up the Sigil, stands to East ofAltar, and faces West. He shallthen rehearse along conjuration to the powers and spirits imme-diately superiorunto that one which he seeks toinvoke, that they shall force him tomanifesthimself unto visible appearance.He then places the Sigil between the Pillars,himself at the East facing West,then in the Signof the Enterer doth he direct the whole currentof his will uponthe Sigil. Thus he continuethuntil such time as he shall perceive his Willpow-er to be weakening, when he protects himselffrom the reflex of the currentby the sign ofsilence, and drops his hands. He now looks to-wards the Quarterthat the Spirit is to appearin, and he should now see the first signs ofhisvisible manifestation. If he be not thus faintlyvisible, let the Magicianrepeat the conjurationof the Superiors of the Spirit, from the place oftheThrone in the East. And this conjurationmay be repeated thrice, each time endingwith anew projection of Will in the sign of the Enterer,etc. But if at the thirdtime of repetition heappeareth not, then be it known that there isan error inthe working.So let the Master of Evocations replace theSigil upon the Altar, holding theSword as usual:and thus doing, let him address a humble prayerunto the GreatGods of Heaven to grant unto< 163 >him the force necessary to correctly completethat evocation. He is then to takeback the Sigilto between the Pillars, and repeat the formerprocesses, whenassuredly that Spirit will beginto manifest, but in a misty and ill-definedform.(But if, as is probable, the Operator be natu-rally inclined unto evocation,then might thatSpirit perchance manifest earlier in the Cere-mony than this.Still, the Ceremony is to be per-formed up to this point, whether he be thereorno.)Now as soon as the Magician shall see the visi-ble manifestation of thatSpirit’s presence, heshall quit the station of the Hierophant, andconsecrateafresh with Water and with Fire, theSigil of the evoked spirit.S—Now doth the Master of Evocations remove fromthe Sigil the restricting cord,and holding thefreed Sigil in his left hand, he smites it with theflat blade ofhis sword, exclaiming, “By and inthe Names of I do invoke upon thee thepower of perfect manifestation unto visible ap-pearance.\" He thencircumambulates the circlethrice holding the sigil in his Right hand.T—The Magician, standing in the place of the Hiero-phant, but turning towardsthe place of the Spir-it, and fixing his attention thereon, now readsa potentInvocation of the Spirit unto visibleappearance, having previously placed thesigilon the ground, within the circle, at the quarterwhere the Spirit appears.This Invocation should be of some length; andshould rehearse and reiterate theDivine andother Names consonant with the working.That Spirit should now become fully andclearly visible, and should be able tospeak witha direct voice, if consonant with his nature. TheMagician thenproclaims aloud that the Spirit< 164 >N. hath been duly and properly evoked in ac-cordance with the sacred rites.U—The Magician now addresses an Invocation untothe Lords of the plane of theSpirit to compelhim to perform that which the Magician shalldemand of him.V—The Magician carefully formulates his demands,questions, etc., and writes downany of the an-swers that may be advisable. The Master ofEvocations now addressesa Conjuration untothe Spirit evoked, binding him to hurt or injurenaughtconnected with him, or his assistants, orthe place. And that he deceive innothing, andthat he fail not to perform that which he hathbeen commanded.W—He then dismisses that Spirit by any suitable form,such as those used in thehigher grades of theOuter. And if he will not go, then shall the Magi-ciancompel him by forces contrary to his nature.But he must allow a few minutes forthe Spiritto dematerialise the body in which he hath mani-fested, for he willbecome less and less materialby degrees. And note well that the Magician (orhiscompanions if he have any) shall never quitthe circle during the process ofevocation, orafterwards, till the Spirit hath quite vanished.Seeing that in some cases, and with some constitutions,there may be dangerarising from the Astral con-ditions, and currents established, and withouttheactual intention of the Spirit to harm, al-though if of a low nature, he wouldprobablyendeavour to do so. Therefore, before the com-mencement of theEvocation, let the operatorassure himself that everything w'hieh maybenecessary, be properly arranged within the circle.But if it be actually necessary to interrupt the Process,then let him stop atthat point, veil and re-cordthe Sigil if it have been unbound oruncovered,recite a License to Depart or a Banishing Form-< 165 >ula, and perform the Lesser Banishing Ritualsboth of the Pentagram and Hexagram.Thusonly may he in comparative safety quit thecircle.Note—Get the Spirit into a White Triangle outsidethe midheaven, then shall he speak the truth of neces-sity.If. nCONSECRATION OF TALISMANSA—T he place where the operation is done.B—The Magical Operator.C—The Forces of Nature employed and attracted.D—The Telesma or material basis.E—In Telesmata, the selection of the Matter to formthe Telesma; the preparationand arrangementof the place. The drawing and forming of thebody of the Telesma.In Natural Phenomena thepreperation of the operation; the formation oftheCircle, and the selection of the material basis,such as a piece of Earth, a cupof Water, a Flameof Fire, a Pentacle, or the like.F—The invocation of the highest divine forces, windinga black cord round theTelesma or material basis,covering the same with a black veil, and initi-atingthe blind force therein. Naming aloud theNature of the Telesma or Operation.G—The Telesma or material Basis is now placed to-wards the West, and dulyconsecrated with Wa-ter and Fire. The purpose of the operation, andthe effectintended to be produced is then to berehearsed in a loud and clear voice.H—Placing the Talisman or material basis at the footof the Altar,state aloud theobject to be attained,solemnly asserting that it will be attained, andthe reasonthereof.I—Announcement aloud that all is prepared and inreadiness, either for chargingthe Telesma, or forthe Commencement of the Operation to induce< 166 >the natural Phenomena. Place a good Telesmaor Material Basis within the WhiteTriangle onthe Altar. Place bad to the West of same, hold-ing the sword erect inthe right hand for a goodpurpose, or its point upon the centre of the Tri-anglefor evil.J—Now follows the performance of an Invocation toattract the desired spirit tothe Telesma or mate-rial basis, describing in the air above it the linealfiguresand sigils, etc., with the appropriate in-strument. Then, taking up the Telesmain theleft hand, let him smite it thrice with the flat ofthe blade of the Swordof Art. Then raise it inthe left hand (holding erect and aloft the Swordin theright hand stamping thrice upon the Earthwith the right foot).K—The Talisman or Material basis is to be placedtowards the North, and theOperator repeats theOration of the Hierophant to the candidate.“The voice of theExorcism said unto me. Letme shroud myself in darkness, peradventure thusshall Imanifest myself in light. I am the onlybeing in an abyss of Darkness. From theDark-ness came I forth ere my birth, from the silenceof a primal sleep. And theVoice of Ages an-swered unto my soul, Creature of Talismans, theLight shineth inthe darkness, but the darknesscomprehendeth it not. Let the MysticCircum-ambulation take place in the path of Darknesswith the symbolic light ofOccult Science to leadthe way.”L—Then, taking up the Light (not from the Altar) inright hand, circumambulate.Now take up Teles-mata or M. B., carry it round the circle, placeit on theground due South, then bar it, purifyand consecrate with Water and Fire afresh,liftit with left hand, turn and facing West, say,< 167 >“Creature of Talismans, twice consecrate, thoumayest approach the gate of theWest.”M—He now passes to the West with Telesmata in lefthand, faces S. E., partlyunveils Telesmata,smites it once with the flat blade of the Sword,andpronounces, “Thou canst not pass from con-cealment unto manifestation, save byvirtue ofthe name Elohim. Before all things are the Chaosand the Darkness, andthe gates of the land ofNight. I am He whose Name is Darkness. I amthe great Oneof the Paths of the Shades. I amthe Exorcist in the midst of the Exorcism.Takeon therefore manifestation without fear beforeme, for I am he in whom fearis Not. Thou hastknown me so pass thou on.” This being done, hereplaces theveil.N—Then pass round the Circle with Telesmata, haltdue North, place T. on ground,bar, purify, andconsecrate again with Water and with Eire, andsay, “Creature ofTalismans, thrice consecrate,thou mayest approach the Gate of the East.”(HoldTalisman aloft.)0—Hold Telemata in left hand, Lotus Wand in right,assume Hierophant’s form.Partly unveil Tal,smite with flat of sword, and say, “Thou canstnot pass fromconcealment unto manifestationsave by virtue of the name YHVH. After theformlessand the Void and the Darkness, thencometh the knowledge of the Light. I amthatLight which riseth in darkness, I am the Exorcistin the midst of theExorcism. Take on thereforemanifestation before me, for I am the wielderof theforces of the Balance. Thou hast knownme now so pass thou on unto the CubicalAltarof the Universe.”P—He then recovers Tal. or M. B., passes on to theAltar, laying it thereon asbefore shewn. He thenpasses to East of Altar, hold left hand over Tal-< 168 >isman, and sword over it erect. Then doth herehearse a most potent conjurationand invo-cation of that Spirit to render irresistable thisTeiesmata or M. B., orto render manifest thisnatural phenomenon of , using and reit-erating all the Divine, Angelic, and MagicalNames appropriate to this end,neither omittingthe signs, seals, sigils, lineal figures, signatures,and thelike from that conjuration.Q-—-The Magician now elevates the covered Telesma orMaterial Basis towardsHeaven, then removesthe Veil entirely, yet leaving it corded, cryingwith a loudvoice. “Creature of Talismans, (orM. B.), long hast thou dwelt in darkness.Quitthe Night and seek the Day,”He then replaces it in the Altar, holds theMagical Sword erect above it, thePommel im-mediately above the centre thereof, and says,“By all the Names,Powers, and rites alreadyrehearsed, I conjure upon thee power andmightirresistible.” Then say the Mystic Words, KhabsAm Pekht, etc.R—Saith the Magician, “As the Light hidden in dark-ness can manifest therefrom,so shalt thou be-come irresistible.” He then takes up the Teies-mata, or the M.B., stands to East of the Altar,and faces West. Then shall he rehearse alongconjuration to the Powers and Spirits immedi-ately superior unto that onewhich he seeks toinvoke, to make the Teiesmata powerful. Thenhe places the T. orM. B. between the Pillars,himself at the East, facing West, then in thesign ofthe Enterer, doth he project the wholecurrent of his Will upon the Talisman.Thus hecontinueth until such time as he shall perceivehis will power weakening,when he protects him-self by the Sign of Silence, and then drops hishands. Henow looks toward the Talisman, and< 169 >a flashing Light or Glory should be seen playingand flickering on the Talismanor M. B., and inthe Natural Phenomena a slight commencementof the Phenomenashould be waited for. If thisdoes not occur, let the Magician repeat theCon-juration of the Superiors from the place of theThrone of the East.And this conjuration may be repeated thrice,each time ending with a newprojection of Willin the Sign of the Enterer, etc. But if at the thirdtime ofrepetition the Talisman or M. B. doesnot flash, then be it known that there isan errorin the working. So let the Master of Evocationsreplace the Talisman orM. B., upon the Altarholding the Sword as usual, and thus doing, lethim addressan humble prayer unto the GreatGods of Heaven to grant unto him theforcenecessary to correctly complete the work. He isthen to take back theTalisman, to between thePillars, and repeat the former process, whenassuredlythe Light will flash.Now as soon as the Magician shall see theLight, he shall quit the station of theHierophantand consecrate afresh with water and with fire.S—This being done, let the Talisman or M. B. have thecord removed and smite itwith the Sword andproclaim “By and in the Names of , Iinvoke upon thee the power of ” Hethen circumambulates thrice, holding the Talis-man or M. B. in his right hand.T—Then the Magician, standing in the place of theHierophant, but fixing his gazeupon the Talis-man or M.B. which should be placed on theground within theCircle, should now read apotent invocation of some length, rehearsingandreiterating the Divine and other Names conso-nant with the working. TheTalisman should< 170 >now flash visibly, or the Natural Phenomenashould definitely commence.Then let the Magician proclaim aloud that theTalisman has been duly and properlycharged,or the Natural Phenomena induced.U-—The Magician now addresses an Invocation untothe Lords of the plane of theSpirit to compelhim to perform that which the Magician re-quires.V—The Operator now carefully formulates his de-mands, stating clearly what theTalisman is in-tended to do, or what Natural Phenomena heseeks to produce.W—The Master of Evocations now addresses a conju-ation unto the Spirit, bindinghim to hurt orinjure naught connected with him, or his assist-ants, or theplace. He then dismisses the Spiritsin the name of Jehovashah and Jeheshua,butwrap up Talisman first, and no Banishing Rit-ual shall be performed, so asnot to dischargeit, and in the case of Natural Phenomena it willusually be bestto state what duration is re-quired. And the Material Basis should be pre-servedwrapped in white linen or silk all the timethat the Phenomena is intended toact.And when it is time for it to cease, the M. B.—if water, is to be poured away;,if Earth,ground to powder and scattered abroad; if a hardsubstance as a metal,it must be decharged, ban-ished and thrown aside; if a flame of fire, it shallbeextinguished; or if a vial containing air, itshall be opened and after that wellrinsed outwith pure water.III. VN — INVISIBILITYA—The Shroud of Concealment.B—The Magician.C—The Guards of Concealment,< l71 >D—The Astral Light to be moulded into the Shroud.E—The Equation of the Symbols in the Sphere of Sen-sation.F—I he Invocation of the Higher; the placing of aBarrier without the AstralForm; the clothingof the same with obscurity through the properinvocation.G—-Formulating clearly the idea of becoming Invisible.The formulating of theexact distance at whichthe shroud should surround the Physical Body.Theconsecration with Water and Fire, so thattheir vapour may begin to form a basisfor theshroud.H—'The beginning to formulate mentally a shroud ofconcealment about theoperator. The affirmationaloud of the reason and object of the working.I—Announcement that all is ready for the commence-ment of the operation.Operator stands in theplace of the Hierophant at this stage, placing hislefthand in the centre of the white triangle andholding in his right the Lotus Wandby the blackend, in readiness to concentrate around him theshroud of Darknessand Mystery.(N. B, In this operation as in the two othersunder the dominion of Shin, aPentacle or Teles-ma suitable to the matter in hand, may be madeuse of, thewhich is treated as is directed forTelesmata.)J—The Operator now recites an Exorcism of a Shroudof Darkness to surround himand render himinvisible, and, holding the Wand by the blackend, let him, turninground thrice completely,formulate a triple circle around him, saying, “IntheName of the Lord of the Universe, etc., Iconjure thee, 0 Shroud of Darkness andof Mys-tery, that thou encirdest me so that I may be-come invisible, so thatseeing me, men see menot, neither understand, but that they may see< 172 >the thing that they see not, and comprehend notthe thing that they behold! Somote it be.”K—Now move to the North, face East, and say, “I haveset my feet in the North,and have said 'I willshroud myself in Mystery and concealment.”Then repeat theOration, “The Voice of myHigher Soul, etc.,” and then command the Mys-ticCircumambulation.L—Move round as usual to the South, Halt formu-ulating thyself as shrouded indarkness, on theright hand the Pillar of Fire, and on the leftthe Pillar ofCloud, but reaching from Darknessto the Glory of the Heavens.M—Now move from between the Pillars thou hastformulated to the West, face West,and say, “In-visible I cannot pass by the Gate of the Invisiblesave by thevirtue of the name of ‘Darkness.’ ”Then formulating forcibly about thee theshroudof Darkness, say, “Darkness is my Name, andconcealment. I am the Great OneInvisible ofthe Paths of the Shades. I am without fear,though veiled inDarkness, for within me, thoughunseen, is the Magic of Light.”N—Repeat process in L.O—Repeat process in M but say, “I am Light shroudedin darkness. I am the wielderof the forces ofthe balance.”P—Now, concentrating mentally about thee the Shroudof Concealment, pass to theWest of the Altarin the place of the Neophyte, face East, remainstanding, andrehearse a conjuration by suitableNames for the formulating of a shroud ofInvisi-bility around and about Thee.Q—Now address the Shroud of Darkness, thus:“Shroud of Concealment. Long hastthou dweltconcealed. Quit the Light, that thou mayestconceal me before men.”Then carefully formu-late the shroud of concealment around thee and< 173 >say, “I receive thee as a covering and as aguard.” Then the Mystic Words.R—Still formulating the shroud, say, “Before all Magi-cal manifestation comeththe knowledge of thehidden light.” Then move to the pillars and givethe signsand steps, words, etc. With the Signof the Enterer, project now thy whole willinone great effort to realise thyself actually fadingout, and becoming invisibleto mortal eyes; andin doing this must thou obtain the effect of thyphysical bodyactually gradually becoming par-tially invisible to thy natural eyes, as thoughaveil or cloud were formulating between it andthee (and be very careful not tolose thy self-control at this point.) But also at this point isthere a certainDivine Exstasis and an exalta-tion desirable, for herein is a sensation ofanexalted strength,S—Again formulate the shroud as concealing thee andenveloping thee, and thuswrapped up therein,circumambulate the circle thrice.T—Intensely formulating the Shroud, stand at theEast and proclaim, “Thus have Iformulatedunto myself a shroud of Darkness and of Mys-tery, as a concealment andguard.”U—Now rehearse an invocation of all the Divine Namesof Binah, that thou mayestretain the Shroudof Darkness under thy own proper control andguidance.V—State clearly to the shroud what it is thy desire toperform therewith.W—Having obtained the desired effect, and gone aboutinvisible, it is requiredthat thou shouldst con-jure the Powers of the Light to act against thatshroud ofDarkness and Mystery so as to dis-integrate it, lest any force seek to use it asamedium for an obsession, etc. Therefore rehearsea conjuration as aforesaid, andthen open the< 174 >shroud and come forth out of the midst thereof,and then disintegrate thatshroud, by the useof a conjuration to the forces of Binah to disin-tegrate andscatter the particles thereof, butaffirming that they shall again be readilyat-tracted at thy command.But on no account must that shroud of awfulMystery be left without suchdisintegration,seeing that it would speedily attract an occu-pant which wouldbecome a terrible vampirepraying upon him who had called it into being.And after frequent rehearsals of this operation,the thing may almost be done“per Motem.”0 TRANSFORMATIONSA—The Astral Form.B—The Magician.C—The Forces used to alter the Form.Eh—The Form to be taken.E—The Equation of the Symbolism in the Sphere ofSensation.F—Invocation of the Higher, The definition of theForm required as a delineationof blind forces,and the awakening of the same by its properformulation.G—Formulating clearly to the mind the Form intendedto be taken. The Restrictionand Definition ofthis as a clear form and the actual baptism byWater and by Firewith the Order Name of theAdept.H—The Actual Invocation aloud of the form desiredto be assumed to formulatebefore you, the state-ment of the Desire of the Operator and the rea-sonthereof.I—Announcement aloud that all is now ready for theoperation of theTransformation of the AstralBody. The Magician mentally places the formas nearlyas circumstances permit in the positionof the Enterer, himself taking the placeof the< 175 >Hierophant, holding his Wand by the black por-tion ready to commence the Orationaloud.J—Let him now repeat a powerful exorcism of the shapeinto which he desires totransform himself, usingthe Names, etc., belonging to the Plane, Planet,or otherEidolon, most in harmony with theshape desired. Then holding the Wand bytheblack End. and directing the flower over thehead of the form, let him say,‘‘In the name ofthe Lord of the Universe, Arise before me, 0Form of , into which I have elected totransform myself. So that seeing me men maysee the thing that they see not, andcomprehendnot the thing they behold.”K—The Magician saith, “Pass toward the North,shrouded in darkness, 0 Form of , intowhich I have elected to transform myself.” Thenlet him repeat the usual Orationfrom the Throneof the East. Then command the Mystic circum-ambulation.L—Now bring the Form around to the South, arrestit, and formulate it there,standing between twogreat Pillars of Fire and Cloud. Purify it withWater and byFire, by placing these elementson either side of the Form.M—Passes to West, face South East, formulate theform before thee, this timeendeavouring to ren-der it physically visible. Repeat speeches ofHiereus andHegemon.N—Same as L.O—Same as M.P—Pass to the East of Altar, formulating the Form asnear in the position of theNeophyte as may be.Now address a solemn invocation and conjura-tion by Divine,etc., Names appropriate torender the form fitting for thy Transformationtherein.Q—Remain East of Altar, address the Form “Childof Earth, etc.,” endeavouring nowto see it phys-< >ically. Then at the words, “We receive Thee,etc.” he draws the form towards himso as toenvelop him, being careful at the same time toinvoke the Divine Light bythe rehearsal of theMystic Words.R—Still keeping himself in the form of the Magiciansay, “Before all MagicalManifestation comeththe knowledge of the Divine Light.” He thenmoves to thePillars and gives Signs, etc., en-deavouring with the whole force of his Willtofeel himself actually and physically in the shapeof the Form desired. And atthis point he mustsee as if in a cloudy and misty manner the out-line of theform enshrouding him. though notyet completely and wholly visible. Whenthisoccurs, but not before, let him formulate himselfas standing between the twovast Pillars of Fireand Cloud.S—He now again endeavours to formulate the Formas if visibly enshrouding him;and still, astrally,retaining the form, he thrice circumambulatesthe place ofworking.T—Standing at the East, let him thoroughly formulatethe shape, which should nowappear manifest,and as if enshrouding him, even to his ownvision; and then lethim proclaim aloud, “Thushave I formulated unto myself this Transfor-mation.”U—Let him now invoke all the Superior Names, etc.,of the Plane appropriate tothe Form that hemay retain it under his proper control and giud-ance.V—He states clearly to the Form what he intends todo with it.W—Similar to this W section of Invisibility, save thatthe conjurations, etc.,are to be made to theappropriate plane of the form instead of to Binah.< 177 >V SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENTA—The Sphere of Sensation.B—The Augoeides.C—The Sephiroth, etc. employed.D—The Aspirant, or Natural Man.E—I he Equilibration of the Symbols.F— I he Invocation of the Higher. The limiting andcontrolling of the lower andthe closing of thematerial senses, to awaken the spiritual,G—Attempting to make the Natural Man grasp theHigher by first limiting theextent to which mereIntellect can help him herein; then by purifica-tion of histhoughts and desires. In doing this lethim formulate himself as standing betweenthePillars of Fire and Cloud.H—The Aspiration of the whole Natural Man towardsthe Higher Self, and a prayerfor Light and guid-ance through his higher Self, addressed to theLord of theUniverse.I—The Aspirant affirms aloud his earnest prayer toobtain Divine Guidance, kneelsat the West ofthe Altar; in the position of the Candidate inthe Enterer, and atthe same time astrally pro-jects his consciousness to the East of the Altar,andturns, facing his body, to the West, holdingastrally his own left hand with hisastral left.And he raises his Astral right hand holding thepresentment of hisLotus Wand by the Whiteportion thereof, and raised in the Air erect.J—Let the aspirant now slowly recite an oration untothe Gods and unto the HigherSelf (as that ofthe Second Adept in the entering of the Vault)but as if with hisAstral Consciousness, whichis projected to the East of the Altar.(Note: If at this point the Aspirant shouldfeel a sensation as of faintnesscoming on, lethim at once withdraw the projected Astral andproperly masterhimself before proceeding anyfurther.)<i7S>Now let the Aspirant, concentrating all hisintelligence in his body, lay theblade of hisSword thrice on the Daath point of his neck,and pronounce with hiswhole will, the words“So help me, the Lord of the Universe and myown highersoul.”Let him then rise, facing East, and stand fora few moments in silenee, raisinghis left handopen, and his right holding the Sword of Art,to their full lengthabove his head; his headthrown back, his eyes lifted upwards. Thusstanding lethim aspire with his whole will to-wards his best and highest Ideal of theDivine.K—Then let the Aspirant pass unto the North, andfacing East solemnly repeat theOration of theHierophant, as before endeavouring to projectthe speakingconscious self to the place of theHierophant (in this case to the Throne oftheEast.) Then let him slowly mentally formulatebefore him the Eidolon of aGreat Angel Torch-bearer, standing before Him as if to lead andlight the way.L—Following it, let the Aspirant circumambulate, andpass to South, then let himhalt, and aspire withhis whole will, first to the Mercy side of theDivine Ideal,and then to the Severity thereof.And then let him imagine himself asstandingbetween two great Pillars of Fire and Cloud,whose bases indeed areburied in black everrolling clouds of darkness, which symbolises thechaos of theWorld of Assiah, but whose sum-mits are lost in glorious light undying,pene-trating unto the White Glory of the Throne ofthe Ancient of Days.M—Now doth the Aspirant move unto the West, facesS. E., and repeats alike thespeeches of Hiereusand Hegemon.N—After another circumambulation, the Adept aspi-< 179 >rant halts at the South and repeats the medi-tation in L.0—And so he passes unto the East, and repeats alikethe words of the Hierophantand the Hegemon.P—And so let him pass to the West of the Altar, everled by the AngelTorchbearer. And he lets pro-jects his Astral, and he lets implant thereinhisconsciousness, and his body kneels what time hissou! passes between thePillars. And he prayeththe Great Prayer of the Hierophant.Q—And now doth the Aspirant’s Soul re-enter untohis gross-form; and he dreams inDivine Exsta-sis of the Glory Ineffable which is in the Bornlessbeyond; and someditating doth he arise, andlifts to the Heavens, his hands, and his eyes,andhis hopes, and concentrating his Will onthe Glory, low murmurs he the MysticWordsof Power.R—-So also doth he presently repeat the words of theHierophant concerning theLamp of the Kerux,and so also passeth he by the East of the Altarunto betweenthe Pillars; and standing betweenthem (or formulating them if they be notthereas it appears unto him) so raises he his heartunto the Highest Faith, andso he lets meditateupon the highest Godhead he can dream of.Then let him gropewith his hands in the dark-ness of his ignorance, and in the Enterer signinvokethe Power that it remove the darknessfrom his spiritual vision. So let him thenendeav-our to behold before him in the Place of theThrone of the East, a certainlight or Dim glory,which shapeth itself into a Form.(Note: And this can be beholden only bythe mental vision. Yet, owing unto thespiritualexaltation of the Adept, it may sometimes ap-pear as if he beheld itwith mortal eye.)Then let him withdraw awhile from such con-< i8o>temptation and formulate for his equilibriationonce more the Pillars of theTemple of Heaven.S—And so again doth he aspire to see the Glory con-forming—and when this isaccomplished, hethrice circumambulates, reverently saluting withthe Enterer thePlace of Glory.T—Now let the Aspirant stand opposite unto the Placeof that Light, and let himmake deep medita-tion and contemplation thereon. Presently alsoimagining it toenshroud and envelope him, andagain endeavouring to identify himself withitsglory. So let him exalt himself in the likeness oreidolon of a colossalBeing, and endeavour torealise that this is the only True Self, and thattheNatural Man is as it were the base andthrone thereof, and let him do this withdueand meet reverence and awe.And therefore he shall presently proclaimaloud “Thus at length have I beenpermitted tobegin to comprehend the form of my HigherSelf.”U—Now doth the Aspirant make entreaty of thatAugoeides to render comprehensiblewhat thingsmay be necessary for his instruction and com-prehension. ■V—And he consults It in any matter he may have espe-cially sought for guidancefrom the Beyond.W—And lastly, let the Aspirant endeavour to formulatea link between the Gloryand his self-hood; andlet him renew his obligation of purity of mindbefore it,avoiding in this any tendency to fanat-icism or spiritual pride.(And let the Adept remember that this pro-cess here set forth is on no accountto be appliedto endeavouring to come in contact with thehigher soul of Another.Else thus assuredly willhe be led into error, hallucination, or even mad-ness. )< i8i >IV. 1DIVINATIONA—The Form of Divination.B—The Diviner.C—The Forces acting in the Divination.D—The subject of the Divination.E—The preparation of all things necessary, and theright understanding of theprocess so as to for-mulate a connecting-link between the processemployed andthe Macrocosm.F—The Invocation of the Higher; arrangement of thescheme of divination andinitiation of the forcesthereof.G—The first entry into the matter. First assertion oflimits and correspondences:beginning of theworking.H—The actual and careful formulation of the questiondemanded; and considerationof all its corre-spondences and their classifications.I—Announcement aloud that all the correspondencestaken are correct and perfect;the Diviner placeshis hand upon the instrument of Divination;standing at theEast of the Altar, he preparesto invoke the forces required in the Divination.J—Solemn invocation of the necessary spiritual forcesto aid the Diviner in theDivination. Then lethim say, “Arise before me clear as a mirror, Omagical visionrequisite for the accomplishmentof this divination.”K—Accurately define the term of the question; puttingdown clearly in writingwhat is already known,what is suspected or implied, and what is soughtto beknown. And see that thou verify in thebeginning of the judgment that part whichisalready known.L—Next let the Diviner formulate clearly under twogroups or heads (a) thearguments for, (b) thearguments against, the success of the subject< 182 >of one divination, so as to be able to draw a pre-liminary conclusion therefromon either side.M—First formulation of a conclusive judgment fromthe premises already obtained.N—Same as section L.0—Formulation of a second judgment, this time of thefurther developments arisingfrom those indi-cated in the previous process of judgment, whichwas apreliminary to this operation.P—The comparison of the first preliminary judgmentwith one second judgmentdeveloping therefrom,so as to enable the Diviner to form an idea ofthe probableaction of forces beyond the actualplane, by the invocation of an angelic figurecon-sonant to the process. And in this matter takecare not to mislead thyjudgment through theaction of thine own preconceived ideas; but onlyrelying,after due tests, on the indication af-forded thee by the angelic form. Andknow,unless the form be of an angelic nature its indi-cation will not bereliable, seeing, that if it bean elemental, it will be below the plane desired.Q—The Diviner now completely and thoroughly for-mulates his whole judgment aswell for the im-mediate future as for the development thereof,taking intoaccount the knowledge and indica-tions given him by the angelic form.R—Having this result before him, let the Diviner nowformulate a fresh divinationprocess, based onthe conclusions at which he has arrived, so asto form a basisfor a further working.S—Formulates the sides for and against for a freshjudgment, and deducesconclusion from freshoperation.T—The Diviner then compares carefully the whole judg-ment and decisions arrivedat with their con-clusions, and delivers now plainly a succinct andconsecutivejudgment thereon.<r83>U—'The Diviner gives advice to the Consultant as towhat use he shall make of thejudgment.V—The Diviner formulates clearly with what forcesit may be necessary to work inorder to combatthe Evil, or fix the Good, promised by the Divi-nation.W—Lastly, remember that unto thee a divination shallbe as a sacred work of theDivine Magic ofLight, and not to be performed to pander untothy curiosityregarding the secrets of another,and if by this means thou shalt arrive ataknowledge of another’s secrets, thou shalt re-spect and not betray them.V. nALCHEMYA—The Curcurbite or the Alembic.B—The Alchemist.C—The processes and forces employed.D—The matter to be transmuted.E—The selection of the Matter to be transmuted, andthe formation, cleansing anddisposing of allthe necessary vessels, materials, etc., for theworking of theprocess.F—General Invocation of the Higher Forces to Action.Placing of the Matter withinthe curcurbite orphilosophic egg, and invocation of a blind forceto actiontherein, in darkness and silence.G—The beginning of the actual process. The regulationand restriction of theproper degree of Heat andMoisture to be employed in the working. Firstevocationfollowed by first distillation.H—The taking up of the residuum which remainethafter the distillation from thecurcurbite or alem-bic; the grinding thereof to form a powder in amortar. Thispowder is then to be placed againin the curcurbite. The fluid already distilledisto be poured again upon it. The curcurbite orphilosophic egg is to be closed.<i84>I—The curcurbite or Egg Philosophic being hermeti-cally sealed, the Alchemistannounces aloud thatall is prepared for the invocation of the forcesnecessary toaccomplish the work. The Matteris then to be placed upon an Altar with theele-ments and four weapons thereon; upon the whitetriangle and upon a flashingTablet of a generalnature, in harmony with the matter selected forthe working.Standing now in the place of theHierophant at the East of the Altar, theAlchem-ist should place his left hand upon the top of thecurcurbite, raise hisright hand holding the LotusWand by the Aries band (for in Aries is thebeginningof the life of the year), ready to com-mence the general invocation of theforces ofthe divine Light to operate in the work.J—'The pronouncing aloud of the Invocation of therequisite general forces,answering to the classof alchemical work to be performed. The con-juring of thenecessary Forces to act in the cur-curbite for the work required. The tracinginthe air above it with appropriate weapon thenecessary lineal figures, signs,sigils and the like.Then let the Alchemist say: “So help me theLord of theUniverse and my own Higher Soul.”Then let him raise the curcurbite in the airwithboth hands, saying: “Arise herein to action, Oye forces of the LightDivine.”K—Now let the matter putrefy in the Balneum Mariaein a very gentle heat, untildarkness beginnethto supervene; and even until it becometh en-tirely black. Iffrom its nature the mixture willnot admit of entire blackness, examine itastrallytill there is the astral appearance of the thickestpossible darkness,and thou mayest also evokean elemental form to tell thee if the blacknessbesufficient. But be thou sure that in this latterthou art not deceived, seeingthat the nature ofsuch an elemental will be deceptive from the< 185 >nature of the symbol of Darkness, whereforeask thou of him nothing furtherconcerning theworking at this stage but only concerning theblackness, and thiscan be further tested by theelemental itself, which should be either blackorclad in an intensely black robe. (Note, forthis evocation, use the names, etc.,of Saturn.)When the mixture be sufficiently black, thentake the curcurbite out of theBalneum Mariaeand place it to the North of the Altar and per-form over it asolemn invocation of the forces ofSaturn to act therein; holding the wand bytheblack band, then say: “The voice of the Alchem-ist” etc. The curcurbite isthen to be unstoppedand the Alembic Head fitted on for purposes ofdistillation.(Note: In all such invocations aflashing tablet should be used whereon tostandthe curcurbite. Also certain of the processes maytake weeks, or even monthsto obtain the neces-sary force, and this will depend on the Alchemistrather thanon the matter.)L—Then let the Alchemist distil with a gentle heatuntil nothing remaineth tocome over. Let himthen take out the residuum and grind it intoa powder; replacethis powder in the curcurbite,and pour again upon it the fluid previouslydis-tilled.The curcurbite is then to be placed again ina Balneum Mariae in a gentle heat.When itseems fairly re-dissolved (irrespective of colour)let it be taken out ofthe bath. It is now to un-dergo another magical ceremony.M—Now place the curcurbite to the West of the Altar,holding the Lotus Wand bythe black end, per-form a magical invocation of the Moon in herdecrease and ofCauda Draconis. The curcurbiteis then to be exposed to the moonlight (shebeingin her decrease) for nine consecutive< 186 >nights, commencing at full moon. The AlembicHead is then to be fitted on.N—Repeat process set forth in section L.O—The curcurbite is to be placed to the East of theAltar, and the Alchemistperforms an invoca-tion of the Moon in her increase, and of CaputDraconis(holding Lotus Wand by white end)to act upon the matter. The curcurbite is nowtobe exposed for nine consecutive nights (end-ing with the Full Moon) to theMoon’s rays.(In this, as in all similar exposures, it mattersnot if such nightsbe overclouded, so long as thevessel be placed in such a position as toreceivethe direct rays did the cloud withdraw.)P—The curcurbite is again to be placed on the whitetriangle upon the Altar. TheAlchemist performsan invocation of the forces of the Sun to act inthecurcurbite. It is then to be exposed to therays of the sun for twelve hours eachday; from8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. (This should be done pre-ferably when the sun isstrongly posited in theZodiac, but it can be done at some other times,thoughnever when he is in Scorpio, Libra, Cap-ricornus, or Aquarius).Q—The curcurbite is again placed upon the white tri-angle upon the altar. TheAlchemist repeats thewords: “Child of Earth, long hast thou dwelt,etc.” thenholding above it the Lotus Wand bythe white end, he says: “I formulate in theetheinvoked forces of Light,” and repeats the mysticwords. At this point keen andbright Hashes oflight should appear in the curcurbite, and themixture itself (asfar as its nature will permit)should be clear. Now invoke an Elemental fromthecurcurbite consonant to the Nature of theMixture, and judge by the nature of thecolourof its robes and their brilliancy whether thematter has attained to theright condition. Hutif the flashes do not appear, and if the robes of< 187 >the elemental be not brilliant and flashing, thenlet the curcurbite stand withinthe white trianglefor seven days; having on the right hand of theApex of thetriangle a flashing tablet of the Sun,and in the left one of the Moon. Let itnot bemoved or disturbed all those seven days; butnot in the dark, save atnight. Then let the op-eration as aforementioned be repeated over thecurcurbite,and this process may be repeatedaltogether three times if the flashing lightcom-eth not. For without this latter the work wouldbe useless. But if afterthree repetitions it stillappear not, it is a sign that there hath been anerrorin the working, such being either in thedisposition of the Alchemist or in themanage-ment of the curcurbite. Wherefore let the lunarand the solar invocationsand exposures be re-peated, when without doubt, if these be donewith care (andmore especially those of CaputDraconis and Cauda Draconis with those of theMoonas taught, for these have great force ma-terially) then without doubt shall thatflashinglight manifest itself in the curcurbite.R—Holding the Lotus Wand by the white end. theAlchemist now draws over thecurcurbite thesymbol of the Flaming Sword as if descendinginto the mixture. Thenlet him place the curcur-bite to the East of the Altar. The Alchemiststandsbetween the pillars, and performs a sol-emn invocation of the forces of Mars toacttherein. The curcurbite is then to be placed be-tween the Pillars (or thedrawn symbols of thesesame) for seven days, upon a flashing tablet ofMars. Afterthis period, fit on the Alembic Head,and distil first in Balneum Mariae, then inBal-neum Arenae till what time the mixture be alldistilled over,S—Now let the Alchemist take the fluid of the distil-late and let him performover it an invocation< 188 >of the forces of Mercury to act in the clear fluid,so as to formulate thereinthe alchemic Mer-cury> even the Mercury of the philosophers.(The residuum of thedead head is not to beworked with at present, but is to be set apartfor futureuse.) After the invocation of the Al-chemic Mercury a certain brillianceshouldmanifest itself in the whole fluid, that is to say,it should not only beclear, but also brilliant andflashing. Now expose it in an hermetic receiverforseven days to the light of the Sun; at theend of which time there should bedistinct flashesof light therein. (Or an egg philosophic may beused; but thereceiver of the Alembic if closestopped will answer this purpose.)T—Now the residuum or Dead Head is to be taken outof the curcurbite, groundsmall and replaced.An invocation of the Forces of Jupiter is thento be performedover that powder. It is thento be kept in the dark standing upon aflashingTablet of Jupiter for seven days. At the end ofthis time there should bea slight flashing aboutit, but if this come not yet, repeat this operationup tothree times, when a faint flashing of Lightis certain to come.U—A flashing Tablet of each of the four Elements isnow to be placed upon analtar as shown in thefigure, and thereon are also to be placed themagicalelemental weapons, as is also clearlyindicated. The receiver containing thedistillateis now to be placed between the Air and WaterTablets, and thecurcurbite with the Dead Headbetween the Fire and Earth Tablets. Now lettheAlchemist perform an invocation using espe-cially the Supreme Ritual of thePentagram, andthe lesser magical implement appropriate. First,of the forces ofFire to act in the curcurbite onthe dead head. Second of those of Water to actonthe distillate. Third, of the forces of the Spirit< 189 >to act in both (using the white end of LotusWand). Fourth, of those of the Airto act onthe distillate; and lastly, those of the Earth toact on the Dead Head.Let the Curcurbite andthe receiver stand thus for five consecutive days,at theend of which time there should be flashesmanifest in both mixtures. And theseflashesshould be lightly coloured.Diagram 25Picture #67 [images/img_0067.png]V—The Alchemist, still keeping the vessels in the samerelative positions, butremoving the Tablets ofthe elements, from the Altar, then substitutesone ofKether. This must be white with goldencharges, and is to be placed on or withinthewhite triangle between the vessels. He then ad-dresses a most solemninvocation to the forcesof Kether; to render the result of the workingthat whichhe shall desire, and making over eachvessel the symbol of the Flaming Swrord.This is the most important of all the Invoca-< 190 >tions. It will only succeed if the Alchemist keep-eth himself closely alliedunto his Higher Selfduring the working of the invocation and ofmaking theTablet. And at the end of it, if ithave been successful, a keen andtranslucentflash will take the place of the slightly colouredflashes in thereceiver of the curcurbite; so thatthe fluid should sparkle as a diamond,whilstthe powder in the curcurbite shall slightly gleam.W—The distilled liquid is now to be poured from thereceiver upon the residuum ofthe Dead Head inthe curcurbite, and the mixture at first will ap-pear cloudy. Itis now to be exposed to the Sunfor ten days consecutively (ten isTipharethtranslating the influence of Kether.) It is thenagain to be placed uponthe white triangle uponthe Altar, upon a flashing Tablet of Venus, witha solemninvocation of Venus to act therein.Let it remain thus for seven days, at the endofwhich time see what forms and colour and ap-pearance the Liquor hath taken,for there shouldnow arise a certain softer flash in the liquid, andan elementalmay be evoked to test the condi-tion. When this softer flash is manifest,placethe curcurbite into the Balneum Mariae to di-gest with a very gentle heatfor seven days.Place it then in the Balneum Mariae to distil,beginning with agentle, and ending with astrong heat. Distil thus till nothing more willcomeover, even with a most violent heat. Pre-serve the fluid in a closely stopperedvial, it isan Elixir for use according to the substance fromwhich it wasprepared. If from a thing medicinal,a medicine; if from a metal, for thepurifying ofmetals; and herein shaft thou use thy judgment.The residuum thoushall place without powder-ing into a crucible, well sealed and luted. Andthoushalt place the same in thine Athanor,bringing it first to a red, and then to awhite< 191 >heat, and this thou shall do seven times in sevenconsecutive days, taking outthe crucible eachday as soon as thou hast brought it to the high-est possibleheat, and allowing it to cool grad-ually.And the preferable time for this workingshould be in the heat of the day. On theseventhday of this operation thou shalt open the cruci-ble and thou shalt beholdwhat Form and Col-our thy Caput Mortuum hath taken.It will be like either a precious stone or a glit-tering powder. And this stoneor powder shallbe of Magical Virtue in accordance with itsnature.Finished is that which is written concerning the For-mulae of the Magic ofLight.(Note: Instances of Rituals based upon these formu-lae will be found in the nextsection, Book Six,—I.R.)< 192 >BOOK SIX(Rituals based upon the Golden Dawn Formulaeof Z-3 in Book Five.)CEREMONIAL MAGICEVOCATIONThe Temple is arranged as in the Neophyte Grade.There is a circle about ten feetin diameter, formedby coloured tapes. Pantacles, bearing the divineNames, areplaced at the four quarters on the rimof the circle. Adonai ha-Aretz, AdonaiMelekh,and Agla are written in Hebrew lettering; andEmor Dial Hectega, inEnochian characters, onthe Pantacles. About a foot outside the Circle,andtowards the North is a Triangle formed bywhite tapes. The letters of Nepheschha-Messiachin Hebrew are written about its angles. In theTriangle is a Pantaclebearing the Sigil of Axir,based upon the letters of the Rose. The same Sigilispainted on the back of the Hierophant’s Lamenworn by the Magus, and it is alsopainted on an-other Pantacle which is carried by the Magus, laterto be veiled,and bound; it is upon this latter thathe works.A heavy-bodied incense should be used, and copi-ously. Dittany of Crete isprobably the best — orany other fairly stable and harmonious incense.When all isready, announce from the Altar, hold-ing the Lotus WandHekas, Hekas Este BebeloiThen, taking the Sword, perform the Lesser Ban-ishingRituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram,closing with the L.V.X.

Return to altar, face East,and utter theAdoration:Holy Art Thou Lord of the Universe.Holy Art Thou, Whom Nature hath not Formed.Holy Art Thou, the Vast and the Mighty One.Lord of the Light and of the Darkness.**Hereafter, this form of opening the Temple, up to theAdoration, will bereferred to as the Formula of Open-ing by Watchtower. It is an ideal method ofpreparingany chamber for practical work, and even as a com-plete ceremony byitself has much to commend its veryfrequent use. As preparation for seriousmeditation, forskrying, for difficult magical works, it is as fine apre-liminary as could be wished for.Pause. Then take up the Lotus Wand, and passbetween the Pillars.

Then closeby usual formulae.< 270 >PRACTICAL Z. PREPARATIONFOR DIVINATIONBy G. H. Frater Sub SpeThe Preparation for Divination — Opening Cere-mony of ® = GD. The Temple is theAura or Sphereof Sensation, The Hierophant is the Diviner, thepositive activewill which manipulates and con-trols all the other bodily functions, and alltheforces operating in the Aura.Sitting in as comfortable position as possible, closethe eyes, and begin to fixattention on the Pole Starand circumpolar constellations, endeavouring tovisiteach prominent star and. then to pass from one toanother. Then, in the sameway to visit the SouthPolar constellations. Then to be conscious of bothsimul-taneously as one might be of head and feet. In thisway the astral grewgradually colossal, and the sensa-tion arose of being outside of, and in factcontainingthe whole starry universe. The earth had become amere insignificantspeck. The sense of human form waswholly lost, but there was a sense of up anddown,and of the pole of a spherical aura. Endeavoured toplace this so as tocorrespond with the centre of Draco,the Kether of the Starry Sphere. This causeda moredefinite idea of the sphere and of the Sephiroth andPaths therein, and thebelt of the Zodiac coloured ofa hollow sphere or magic circle, wherein ablindingwhite light was in the place of Kether, and thick dark-ness on Malkuth.Stood immediately in front of Ketherand realised that the blackness of Malkuthguardedthe sphere from evil and sub-human forces, the Qlip-poth, or on thisspiritual plane, the bondage to thematerial. Endeavoured to formulate this BlackDark-ness into a giant Guardian, realising also that it wasmy own negative willsaying “Thus far, and no further/’< 271 >In front of this Guardian which I perceived, wasthe reflection of my ownmaterial universe, i.e., every-thing I was or could possible be conscious of inthebody, “All thoughts, all passions, all delights — what-soever stirs thismortal frame,” but only the reflectionthereof as in a mirror, and havingtherefore no powerto move the spiritual consciousness. The form was asquare ofearth cast in the form of a double cube an-swering to the Tenth Sep hi rah, forevery possiblethought or emotion of the body, however lofty, wasrepresentedthere, even to the highest spiritual aspira-tions, all dominated by the whitetriangle of the Tri-une God and the Red Cross of self-sacrifice.I then realised that even the reflection of my ownuniverse, including my verythoughts and aspirationsin the body, stood without a colossal portal of aTem-ple, my Spiritual Will being within, and the shadowyPortal grew up betweenthe perceiving consciousnessand the perceived Universe. Two vast pillars ofposi-tive and negative, the eternal contraries, were the Gate-way; and the purewhite of equilibrium and eternalsilence was between them. My spiritual consciousWillnow advanced as it were below the centre of its sphere,near to that point ofequilibrium so as to surveythrough the portal of the Piliars the reflection ofmyown universe.Fixing myself there as immovable — because eter-nally right, being dominatedonly by the forces of theEternal God, my lower nature lay before me as itwere,mapped out. In front the Great Portal shutting outall that had not attainedto, and retained, perfect equi-librium, beyond and as far distant from the pointofequilibrium as my own consciousness, was my evil self,the root of all evil.And I was now conscious in thatpast which was the root of all good. And thusagainan equilibrium was preserved between the Pillars. Atan equal distance againbeyond this evil self, werethe reflection of the perceived universe, formulated< 272 >as the cubical altar whereon were the symbols of theelements and the triangleand cross, and beyond thisthe dark and threatening black figure of theGreatGuardian of the West. Furthermore, from my righthand came the coolinfluence of moisture, from myleft the warmth of fire, and from the moistwarmthat the point of equilibrium sprang the idea of genera-tion, birth,rebirth, growth and development whichforces were directed upon the CubicalAltar, bringingthe forces of Life into my universe.Yet — all this was myself. I realised that far be-yond the possibilities ofbodily thought there werein myself forces, powers and knowledge fartranscend-ing all that the body can ever perceive or imagine inits loftiestflights. In this manner I was able to orderand direct the forces of theintellectual brain — theKerux, Anubis, the “Watcher without” being thecon-scious intellectual brain which thinks and acts in thematerial body.The Watcher within, the higher intuitive intellectwhose workings are mostlyunconscious to the mate-rial man. Recognising now the importance of main-tainingthis exalted attitude and preventing the en-trance of any material and mundanethoughts, myspiritual will ordered the logical intellect, by will-forceratherthan definite thought, to clear the Temple, andthe intellect bearing a ray ofwhite light from thesupreme and lighted by the lamp of wisdom com-manded allmaterial things to stand aloof. Then andnot till then the Spiritual Will whichnow seemed tobe myself, began to function. It initiated a current offorce andcommanded the higher intuitional intellectto see that the sphere was properlyclosed againstmaterial thoughts. This was accomplished by a com-municationbetween the intuitional intelligence andthe physical logical brain, the latterkeeping guardover the materia^ body (by this time almost forgot-ten, itscerebrations having become unconscious).< 273 >The Spiritual Will now directs the Guardian of theWest to make sure that allforces operating are forcesof good, and in obedience to the Spiritual Will,whosecontrolling force is the ineffable Power of God Him-self. This is done byevery force treading down thethe evil, and invoking and bringing forward thelightinto the material. The sensation here should be thatevery force in thesphere of sensation is in unity andaffirming the Will of God.A certain equilibrium having thus been establishedthe whole sphere of Sensationshould be vitalised bythe Vibratory formula of the Middle Pillar. The sen-sationis that the consciousness which is in the spirit-ual will draws in a deepinspiration of divine powerfrom the supreme hierarchy, and by an effort ofWillsends it down to the Guardian of the West, whenceit rushes forth in strengthand power, vitalising theGenius of equilibrium between the Pillars, andthencethe whole sphere. The attention is then fixed on eachforce in turn, nowalive and clothed with a definitesymbolic form. In this it is desirable to usethe formsof the Gods of Egypt, so as to avoid the chance ofillusion throughmemory creeping in by the appear-ance of the human officers one is accustomed tosee.Each of this considered in detail assumes a symbolicform. Note, that as thepresent purpose is to examinethe reflection of some earthly event or force, thesym-bology is particularly regarded with reference there-to. Thus the Hiereusspecially guards against the in-trusion of any material wish or thought oremotionwhich might disturb the perfect calm of the diviningmind. The Dadouchosis not alone the power ofheat and dryness but of energy, fire, passion,impetu-ous zeal; and Stolistes is not alone cold or moisture,but pleasure, love,luxury, etc. In fact the forces ofWands and Cups. The fiery zeal prepares thewayfor the prayer which rises from the soul like incense,this prayer beingrelated also to the suffering whichis the purification by Fire.< 274 >The receptive anti negative forces of the Cup arethose which develop theperception of the symbologyof the various forces. The intuitive intellect(Anubis,the Watcher within) regulates the imaginative form-ing of the sphere ofsensation itself— guides the for-mulated movements thereof — keeps alive thelightof occult science and grasps the ray of Divine Wis-dom. So the genius ofequilibrium, Thmaab, must in-troduce the question to be investigated, for unlessthisbe done by perfect equilibrium no good result can beattained.I now felt every force moved by my own higherintuition, directed by theSpiritual Will. All thoughtsof earth were lost altogether, and only the greatforceswere perceived, which might produce a material result,but that result wasnot perceptible. Unless this resultis attained at this stage, I have found ituseless to gofurther. I next endeavoured to mark the limits of thesphere ofsensation by the consecrations of fire andwater. Now a complete establishment ofcalm and pas-sive equilibrium in the Sphere was required, and theformulation ofa vortex, to draw in the highest spirit-ual influences. I therefore, directed asin the © — 0,the circumambulation of these mighty forces, as itwere, a greatwheel which set revolving, whose centrewas the point of silence, the Throne ofHarpacrat. Thewhole sphere then adored the Lord of the Universe.At this stage I found that I could formulate thefigure of a terrestrial globe inthe place of the Altar,and fixing the attention on any point of the surface,geta mental picture of what was transpiring there,recognising at the same time thatit took place by theaction and reaction of the great forces which movedby theWill of God and were therefore in all thingsperfectly good. This renderedimpossible any feelingof joy or sorrow at any event, any hope or any fear,anyaffection for any individual, or any antipathy.The desire to know became simplya desire to be asso-< 275 >dated in the knowledge of God and therefore so farunited to Him.Unless this stage is reached at this point, earthlythoughts' have intruded, theTemple has not beenproperly cleansed and guarded, and according to myexperienceno true results can be expected. If this re-sult is attained the process maythen be sealed, andthe divination may proceed.End of Volume Threef< 276 >"}]
