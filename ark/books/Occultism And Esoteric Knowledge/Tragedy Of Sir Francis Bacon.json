Much of the information which exists upon the subjedt is intentionally misleading. Much is so ambiguous, that it is. difficult to decide whether it be adlual fad, delivered in the form of allegory, or pure and simple fidtion. So far as we know, the Rosicrucian was one of the many Secret Societies that existed in Europe two or three hundred years ago. The historian of the, order — or rather the writer that is popularly con- sidered to be such — is Mr. Hargrave Jennings, whose two volumes, entitled \"The Rosicrucians, their Rites and Mysteries,\" contain a mass of bald, -disjointed erudition, but throw very little light upon the subjeft. The value of this book is discounted"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"IntroduBion by the statement in the introdudion that initiates of occult mysticism need have no fear that the author will do otherwise than stand guard over their cabala. Mr. A. E. Waite, the author of \" The Real History of the Rosicrucians,\" is a writer of a different calibre. He approaches his subjed in a critical and sceptical mood, and demolishes most of the generally accepted opinions. From the wreckage which h« has left I have gathered up a few unbroken fragments, and have accepted these as being genuine and reliable. With the exception of the two manifestoes, \" Fama Fraternitatis \" and \"Confessio Fraternitatis,\" and a few miscellaneous fafts, I am inclined to think we possess no unquestionably authentic information. Probably from time immemorial secret societies have in one form or another existed among us. The Rosicrucians were not a political order, nor were they professedly alchemists, although in an age when the belief in the possibility of the transmutation of metals was almost universal, there is very little doubt that many of the menibers, including Bacon himself, acquiesced in the current philosophy. They were, however, pre-eminently a learned and beneficent Order, whose avowed objefts were the restoration of science and art and the alleviation of human misery. The mysterious secrecy which was assumed by the Fraternity for the purpose of shielding themselves"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"IntroduSiion from derision, insult and persecution, shrouded them with a romantic glamour and led to the circulation of absurd and extravagant reports as to their super- natural and unholy powers. From time to time charlatans and impostors, finding it a profitablecard to play to claim connexion with the powerful Rosicrucian Brotherhood, did so, and by their swindling of cre- dulous people caused these extravagant rumours to regaiii currency. No permanent or abiding practical results have yet been attributed to the credit i)f the Rosicrucians. Their teaching and philosophy are Eidmitted to have tinged and influenced current European literature, but be- yond this their career is generally considered to have been as evanescent as that of a meteor. I shall endeavour to show the fallacy of this idea. It seems very doubtful whether Rosicrucianism is yet extiiift. The latest authentic record of the order is' in 1794, when a Society is known to hive been in existence in the Island of Mauritius ; but De Quincey, who drew his opinion from Prof. Buhle, states that modern Freemasonry is nothing more or' Jess than Rosicrucianism transplanted to England in a modified form. Whether this be so or not I am unqualified to say. Freemasons when interrogated either deny it or in conventional terms courteously waive the question on one side. It seems, however, almost certain .3"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"IntroduEiion that Rosicrucianism gradually merged into Free- masonry, and that the thirty-third degree of Free- masonry is the \" Rosecroix \" degree. Among the Masonic brethren there are still to-day \" Sovereign Princes of Rosecroix,\" \"Princes of Rosecroix de Heroden,\" etc. It is of course suggested that only the very highest ranks of Freemasonry know anything at all about the topic; but that here and there the true fads are understood seems un- questionable. A writer in the \" Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia\" (London, 1877) expresses himself as follows : \" Modern times have eagerly accepted, in the full light of science, the precious inheritance of know- ledge bequeathed by the Rosicrucians, and that body has disappeared from the visible knowledge of man- kind, and re-entered that invisible fraternity of which mention was made in the opening of this article. . . . It is not desirable, in a work of this kind, to make disclosures of an indiscreet nature. The Brethren of the Rosy Cross will never and should not, at peril and under alarm, give up their secrets. This ancient body has apparently disappeared from the field of human aftivity, but its labours are being carried on with alacrity, and with a sure delight in an ultimate success.\" The subjedl of ciphers and cipher writing has during 4"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"IntroduEiion recent years claimed a considerable amount of atten- tion. Attrafted by curious outward indications many students of Elizabethan literature have devoted ex- haustive care to the subjedt, and three writers have published the result of their labours. To the ma- jority of readers the existence of these books is probably unknown. Occasionally one meets with a slighting allusion to one or the other, but as it is almost invariably prefaced by the current Shake- spearean formula \" I iiave not read the book but \" — the writer's views do not possess that pith and dignity which they might otherwise do. Whether the statements and narratives which the writers claim to have deciphered are genuine or merely the concodtion of their exuberant imagina- tions remains to be proved ; but as the latter hypo- thesis would involve forgery, fraud, and a deliberate and far-reaching literary conspiracy, it will be dis- missed as preposterous ; of improbabilities it is better to choose the least. In 1888 Mr. Ignatius Donnelly claimed to have dis- covered the existence of a cipher story in the first folio of the Shakespeare plays. In his much abused but little read and less refuted book, \"The Great Cryptogram \" (the second volume of which was de- voted to the subjedt), he endeavoured to convince the world of the truth of his theory. Partly by reason 5"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"IntroduSiion of the complexity of his system, the full details of which he did not reveal, and partly oWing to the fad that he did not produce any definite assertion of authorship, but appeared to have stumbled into the midst of a lengthy narrative, the world was not con- vinced, and Mr. Donnelly was greeted with Rabe- laisian laughter. He has since gone to the grave unwept, unhonoured and unsung, and his secret has presumably died with him. The work of this writer was marred by inany extravagant, inferences, but the first volume of \" The Great Cryptogram \" is never- theless a damning indifkment which has not yet been answered. In 1895 Dr. Orviile W. Owen published a work purporting to consist of deciphered matter, and en- titled \" Sir Fcancis Bacon's Cipher Story.\" ' This work, if it ever reached the hands of scholars, was greeted with absolute and profound silence. As Dr. Owen gave scarcely more than a hint of how his alleged cipher system worked, his book obviously would not come in for serious notice but for the fa6t that within the past twelve months a lady (who had previously been associated with him) has published a book which, unless it can be refuted, fully confirms Dr. Owen's revelations, and will revolutionize many of our literary ideas. Unlike her predecessors, the author of \" The Biliteral Cipher of Sir Francis 6"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"IntroduEiion Bacon \" fully explains her methods of working and further elucidates the subjed by giving facsimiles of many of the works from which she claims to have deciphered. Under these circumstances her. book is not to be dismissed offhand as the concodtion of a crank, but is worthy of careful and exhaustive attention. There is nothing either surprising or inherently im- probable in the suggestion that Bacon should have made use of cipher writing. It is well known that he studied the subjeft with great interest, and he de- voted a chapter to it in \" The Advancement of Learning.\" The principle of the Biliteral cipher is of course well known. It is the basis of our modern , signalling and telegraphic codes, and can be applied in innumerable ways. Every letter of the alphabet is represented by a group of five charadters arranged in a certain order. It is of no consequence what these charadters be, provided they are capable of distinc- tion. In telegraphy the two forms are represented by dashes and dots. The two differences, when ap- plied to printed matter, may be either two distindl forms of every capital and small letter, or the form of the letters may be the same ; but the distindlion con- veyed by their position above or below the level of the line, or by their angle of slope. It is unquestion- able that at least two founts of type have been used 7"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"IntroduSiion in many Elizabethan books, a peculiarity which does not prevail in all early English literature. In the capital letters the differences are so sufficiently marked that they are at once apparent ; but as Mrs. Gallup states in her introdudlion, \" the distinguishing features in the small letters, from age of the books, blots and poor printing, have been more difficult to classify, and close examination and study have been required to separate and sketch out the variations, and educate the eye to distinguish them. . . . Anyone possessing the original books, who has sufficient patience and a keen eye for form, can work out and verify the cipher from the illustrations given. Nothing is left to choice, chance, or the imagination.\" Whether we accept Mrs. Gallup's decipherings as authentic, or cynically dismiss them as fabrications, will not affedt their inherent literary value or the serene beauty of their thought and diftion. I happen to know that while Mrs. Gallup was recently in London and deciphering day by day from old editions at the British Museum, her publishers invited certain eminent Shakespearean scholars to meet her there and test the genuineness of her methods ; but to them it was a laughing matter and they disdainfully declined. Messrs. Gay and Bird then forwarded a copy of her book to the editor of an august newspaper asking him to send a representative to meet Mrs. Gallup and 8"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"IntroduSiion satisfy himself of the genuineness of her discovery, I have before me a copy of the reply. It reads as follows : \" The editor regrets he is unable to avail himself of Messrs. Gay and Bird's invitation to examine the theory of Bacon's bi-literal cipher.\" Such an exhibition of stonewall apathy would be ludicrous were it not sad, and one hardly knows whether to laugh or to cry. It would be thought that the bare possibility of lifting the veil from the past would have inspired the most torpid and indifferent to pursue even the faintest clue. Living as we do in an age of peace and security, it is difficult to realize the conditions which prevailed in bygone days. The Elizabethan age was pre-emi- nently an era of intrigue, treachery and sudden death, and the conditions of life may be fairly well gauged by the importance which men then attached to the art of cryptography. This is sufficiently evident by the great number of treatises and books which were published upon the subjedt. Necessity was doubtless the mother of these many ingenious inventions for self protedion. In those days of faction and intrigue no man's house was secure against a Star Chamber warrant for his person and his papers.

It was not abolished until 1694. We read in cipher: \"Nought which her majesty disapproved could ever finde a printer.\" If by any chance anything to which Her Majesty took exception happened to find its way into print, the un- happy printer, if he were not broken upon the rack or the flesh and bones of his lower limbs smashed into a pulp in \" the boot,\" had his hands cut off and the stumps seared with a red hot iron. We find Bacon's contemporary. Sir Walter Raleigh, in the preface to his \" History of the World,\" compiled while he was a prisoner in the Tower, writing : \" I know that it will be said by many that I might have been more pleasing to the reader, if I had written the story of mine own times, having been permitted to draw water as near the well-head as another. To this I answer that whosoever in writing a modern history shall follow Truth too near the heels, it may haply strike out it's teeth, ' There is no ^mistress or guide that hath led her followers and servants into greater miseries.\" 10"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"IntroduBion Although \" The History of the World \" does not deal with events later than .170 b.c, it was suppressed by James I. as being \" too saucy in censuring the afts of Kings.\" Now thoughtful Englishmen were not fools in those days, and it seems exceedingly likely that steps would be taken to evade or circumvent the censor. As a means to this end, cipher writing would no doubt commend itself. Without the assistance of the correft key it would be a sheer impossibihty to detedt the existence of a system such as Bacon's- Biliteral. Living in times so infamous, we find him writing in cipher : \" Though constantly hemmed about, threatened, kept Under surveillance, I have written this history in full in the cipher, being fully persuaded in my owne minde and heart that not onely jesting Pilate, but the world, aske, ' What is truth .? ' \" And again : \" Watching th' storms, but saying no un- meani'g word, I put forth my secret letters. It may bee noe eie will note, no hand will ayde. If this be true, I die and make no sign.\" Here Bacon is seen as it were struggling to remove the gag from his mouth, and to signal to posterity the true story of his own times; 'at a later period he was influenced by different motives.

That not only was Bacon the author of the works attributed to Shakespeare, but also of an immense amount of similar literature, in most instances of an inferior and immature charafter. These astonishing statements prove to be less remark- able than the \" coincidences \" which become manifest when we commence to look below the surface and to analyze the styles of the various writers whose authorship is impugned. We know Bacon's reply to Elizabeth on an occasion when she proposed to rack the reputed author of a seditious pamphlet, in order to extort the name of the true writer : \"Nay, madam, rack not his body — rack his style, give him paper and pens, with help of books bid"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"IntroduBion him carry on his tale.

But according to Shakespearean scholars this is quite a fallacy. Christopher Marlowe, a blas- phemous drunken reprobate, also George Peele and Robert Greene, two small wrens of a similar charaifter, fly abreast with our great poet, and the measured march of his wondrous music is indistinguishable from their modest song. The style of all four writers is so similar that Prof. Dowden and other authorities are driven to suggest that Greene, Peele, Marlowe and Shakespeare sometimes worked in col- laboration. The fable of the eagle, upon whose back a wren rose heavenwards, will at once suggest itself, Shake- speare appears to have carried with him in his upward flight into Immortality a small colony of inferior men.

Waite, \" no vestiges of the Rosicrucians traceable before the beginning of the seventeenth century, and the belief in their antiquity originates in a priori, considerations which are concerned with the predileftions and prejudices of thinkers, whose faith and imagination have been favoured by evolution or environment at the expense of their judgment.\" In the year 1614, or thereabouts, there was published anonymously in Germany, a singular skit, in the form of a pamphlet, entitled \"A Universal Reformation ot the Whole Wide World.\" In this the corrupt Age is supposed to be brought to trial by order of the God Apollo, and various remedies for the cure of its ail- ments and diseases are suggested by eminent classical philosophers. In an English translation of this v^ork, which is attributed to the Rosicrucians, Sir Francis Bacon is designated as Chancellor of the Great Assize. Sir Francis Bacon is also further identified with the Fraternity by the fadt that his \" New Atlantis \" was 18"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"'Papermarks in after years published almost word for word by John Heydon, a mystical writer claiming to be fully acquainted witli the secret cabala of Rosicrucianism. Either this was a case of literary theft, or the \" New Atlantis \" was really prepared in the first instance for the use of the mysterious Fraternity, and Heydon was justified in his aftion. As he was a highly esteemed man of good birth and education, the latter seems the preferable explanation. The \" New Atlantis \" is a remarkable book, quite unlike in style to anything else amongst Bacon's acknowledged works. His chaplain. Dr. Rawley, describes it as a \" fable my lord devised that he might exhibit therein a model or description of a college instituted for the interpreting of Nature and the producing of great and marvellous works for the benefit of man.\" The 1638 edition of the book bears upon its title-page the imprint of a large Tudor rose, within which is a flamboyant heart. Mr. Waite states that he is in a position to afErm that the esoteric emblem of the Rosicrucian fraternity was a Tudor rose inclosing a heart impressed with a cross. The difference between the two designs is so slight that the fadb of the appearance of this emblem upon \" The New Atlantis \" cannot be dismissed as coincidence. I shall show hereafter that the wood- cuts which adorn so many sixteenth and seventeenth 19"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"'Papermarks century publications, are not conventional designs due to the whim or caprice of the draughtsman or the printer, but that they probably all possess pregnant meanings. When John Heydon annexed \" The New Atlantis \" and published it as though it were his own, he altered it in several slight but important details. The Island of the New Atlantis became the \" Land of the Rosi- crucians,\" and wherever Bacon used the term \" Solo- mon's House,\" Heydon substituted \" The Temple of the Rosie Cross,\" or some similar expression, as in the passage following : \" Amongst the excellent adls of that king one above all hath the preeminence, it was the eredion and institution of an order or Society which we call ' Solomon's House ' (altered by John Heydon to ' The Temple of the Rosie Cross '), the noblest foundation as we think that ever was upon the earth and the lanthorn of this kingdom. It is dedicated to the study of the works and creatures of God.\" The idea that the book was no mere visionary dream, but, on the contrary, a thinly-veiled true description of the Rosicrucian fraternity was, I believe, first put forward in 1888 by Mr. W. F. C. Wigston. In the following pages I hope to produce evidence which will carry convidlion of the truth of his prophecy.

It is stated in the \" Fama,\" that the manifesto is set forth in five languages, and the same assertion is repeated in the \" Con- fessio.\" \" We have by no means made common property of our arcana, although they resound in five languages within the ears of the vulgar.\" It seems possible that the German editions are the only ones that happen to have survived the wreck of time. This probably has led to Germany being erroneously associated with Rosicrucianism, whereas, various writers have testified that, in spite of their endeavours to trace the Fraternity there, they were unable to do so, and hence inclined to the opinion that the existence of the Order was merely an ingenious fiftion. The following extradt is quoted from Mr. Waite's translation of the \" Confessio \" : \" For conclusion of our Confession, we must earnestly admonish you, that you cast away, if not all, yet most of the worthless books of pseudo chymists, to whom it is a jest to apply the Most Holy Trinity to vain things, or to deceive men with monstrous symbols 21"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"'Papermarks and enigmas, or to profit by the curiosity of the credulous ; our age doth produce many such, one of the greatest being a stage flayer, a man with sufficient in- genuity for imposition;^ such doth the enemy of human welfare mingle among the good seed, thereby to make the truth more difficult to be believed, which in herself is simple and naked, whilst falsehood is proud, haughty, and coloured with a lustre of seeming godly and humane wisdom.

Bacon's claims have, however, never yet been con- tested. Macaulay tells us that \" the philosophy which he taught was essentially new. It differed from that of the celebrated ancient teachers, not merely in method, but also in objecfl. Its object was the good of mankind, in the sense in which the mass of mankind always have understood, and always will understand, the word good. . . . His gigantic scheme of philosophical reform is said by some writers to have been planned before he was fifteen, and was un- doubtedly planned while he was still young.

It is popularly supposed that the Elizabethan era was a Golden age of Poesie, Learning and Erudition, that giant minds jostled each other at the court, and that poets swarmed in every tavern.

From the Preface to \" The Great Instauration \" we know exadly what were Bacon's designs. Moreover, it will be noticed that although \" he was no dashing man, but ever a fos- terer of other men's parts,\" he states he stands alone, and gives no hint of a philosophical fellow-worker.

Macaulay, discussing the philosophy of Bacon, says : \" It was because he dug deep that he was able to pile high.

In 1594 he wrote to his uncle Burleigh : \"I do easily see that place of any reasonable countenance doth bring command- ment of more wits than a man's own, which is a thing I greatly affeli.\" And in \" The Advancement of Learning,\" he says : \" I doe foresee that many of those things which I shall register as deficients, will incurre diverse cen- sures, as that . . . they are impossible to be com- passed by human industries. . . .

On such occasions, a few young men of distinguished talents were some- times the companions of his retirement, and among them his quick eye soon discerned the superior abilities of Thomas Hobbes. It is not probable, however, that he fully appreciated the powers of his disciple, or foresaw the vast influence, both for good ?ind for evil, which that most vigorous and acute of human intelledls was destined to exercise on the two succeeding generations.\"^ These \" few young men of distinguished talents \" were, in all probability, the nucleus of that vast Order and Fraternity for nobleness, enterprise, ' Essay. 29"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"'Papermarks obedience and the like,^ whose operations it is so fascinating to trace, or — to speak more correftly — are yet to be traced.

It has been found pradicable to trace the publications of the silent and beneficent fraternity by singularly simple means.

Whereas I pledge mankind in a liquor pressed from countless grapes— from grapes ripe and fully seasoned, colle5ted in clusters, and gathered, and then squeezed in the press, and then, finally, purified and clarified in the vat.\" ^ In the prayer addressed to God by Bacon after his dismissal, the following passage occurs : \" 'This vine, which Thy right hand hath planted in this nation, I have ever prayed unto Thee that it might have the first and latter rain, and that it might stretch her branches to the seas and to the floods.\" • \" Nov.

Watermark No. i appears to represent two columns or pillars. This symbol is probably the most familiar one of Freemasonry. I believe it is known as the Pillars of Solomon's House, and that it is the emblem of those two faculties of man's mind, the will and THE UNDERSTANDING. In the engraved frontispiece to the 1640 edition of the \" Advancement of Learning,\" the two columns appear very conspicuously. In many sixteenth and seventeenth frontispieces the same design occurs in the form of two columns around which are woven clusters of grapes. A good example may be seen in \" Hollingshed's Chronicles.\" ^ In figs. 1 9 and 20 we see examples of paper-marked columns and grape clusters combined. Watermark No 3, sometimes a single and sometimes a double-handled vase, dates back prior to the time of Francis Bacon ; but he seems to have elaborated, and thereby added, a new significance to it by graft- ing on the grapes, and various other symbols — such as expanding rays, moons, crosses and Fleurs-de- Lys. Bacon says that, \" The means for the advancement of learning include three things : The places of learning, ' Hooker, London, 1587. 44"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"'Papermarks the books of learning and the persons of the learned.

We find Bacon referring to \" That excellent and Divine fable of the Golden Chain, namely, that Men were not able to ' Bacon appears to have borrowed this idea from Richard Aungervyle, Bishop of Durham, a thirteenth century writer.

The most frequent design is as in fig. i8.

They are certainly neither English nor Dutch ; in fadb, so incomprehensible are they that it is doubtful whether they are not the initial letters of certain mystic phrases or sentences.

At the foot of that chapter in which Bacon describes his Biliteral cipher, and as a headline to the following one, which deals with the various methods of hand- ing on to posterity the Lamp of Knowledge, there occurs a single row of acorns. Aubrey informs us that on the wall in the principal room in Bacon's house, near St. Albans, there was painted \" an oak, with acorns falling from it,\" and it is perhaps note- worthy that at the foot of one of the preliminary pages of \" The Advancement of Learning,\" the translator has written : \" Crescit occulta velut arbor aevo fama Baconi\" which may be translated : \" The fame of Bacon grows secretly in future ages, like a tree.\" W, F.

The design has survived to the present day, and is still — in spite of Luckombe's forebodings — occasionally employed by modern printers. In the preceding chapter it has been shown that two of the leading Rosicrucian symbols were the Lily and the Rose. W. F. C.

It has already been noted how frequently the water- mark of a vase or pot is to be found. This design occurs sometimes with one and sometimes with two handles, in the form of the double S,S., as in fig. 1 1. From some of these papermark vases we find rising a FUur-de-Lys, in combination with a four petalled flower, a device perhaps intended to combine the two emblems of rose and cross (see fig. 12). This double S.S. handled vase is very conspicuous as a printer's ornament (see figs. 30 to 34). While the designs of the vases vary, yet it will be noticed that they all possess the distindtive and charadleristic S.S. handles.

So far as I have yet discovered no two volumes contain exactly the same devices, and we have already seen the enormous ex- pense which this must have entailed.

For the same difference, the ancients specially observed in publish- ing books, the same we will transfer to the manner it- selfe of delivery. So the Acroamatique method was in use with the writers in former ages, and wisely and with judgment applied; but that Acroamatique and Aenigmatique kind of expression is disgraced in these later times by many who made it as a dubious and false light for the vent of their counterfeit mer- chandice.

In accordance with his expressed wish it was \"obscure.\" Ben Jonson's grave was unmarked until, so tradition tells us, an admirer paid a few pence to a passing stonemason to carve the epitaph : \" O rare Ben Jonson.\" For a long list of eminent Englishmen, whose tombs are inconspicuous by reason of a similar mysterious reticence, the reader is referred to an article in \"Baconiana,\" No 3, November, 1893.

I have, however, come across one of the cabalistic tombs (in the \"old church\" at Delft), dated 1556. This is previous to the time when Mr, Waite states the Rosicrucians came into existence. No one, of course, suggests that Secret Societies did not exist earlier, and it is perhaps possible that a form of Rosi- crucianism or Freemasonry really dates back consider- ably further than is known to the profane vulgar, and that Bacon merely revivified and restored to working order the machinery of a more ancient organisation,^ * There are many indications in favour of this supposition.

His chaplain. Dr. Rawley, has left it on record that ^his lordship wrote the majority of his published works during the last fikie years of his life, while he was \" in the shadow,\" and he adds: \"with what celerity he wrote them I can best testify.\" With the exception of some pamphlets and a few short essays — a veritable mouse from such a mountain — Bacon published nothing whatever until i_6o5, when, at the age of forty-four, he brought out \" The Advancement of Learning.\" After 1605 his adbivity again ceased apparently for a further fifteen'^ years, i.e. until 1620.

On the death of Sir Nicholas Bacon, his reputed father, he found himself left without any provision — a significant fadl in the light of recent discoveries. In ill-health, negledted and ignored by Elizabeth, thwarted by his powerful kinsmen, the Cecils, and dogged by credi- tors.

Sonnets XXVII. and XXVIII. seem to be a diredt answer to this letter : \" Weary with toil, 1 haste me to my bed, The dear repose for limbs with travel tired ; But then begins a journey in my head, To work my mind, when body's work's expired.

The playwright, Nash, so angered the Queen by bringing political matters on to the stage in his \" Isle of Dogs,\" that she gave orders to tear down and destroy every theatre in London. Nash himself was thrown into prison, and the following memorandum in the registers of the Privy Council is in reference to the subjedt : \" Uppon information given us of a lewd plaie that was plaied in one of the plaie bowses on the Bancke side, contayninge very seditious and sclaunderous matter, wee caused some of the players to be appre- hended and comytted to pryson, whereof one of them ' Quoted in Holmes, \"The Authorship of Shakespeare,\" pp. 255-257. 228"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"'Biographical was not only an adtor, but a maker of parte of the said plaie {dated Greenwich, 15M August, 1597).\" ' Mr. Sidney Lee thinks that it was probably in 1596 that Shakespeare left London and retired to Stratford.

Bacon feared that, were his authorship discovered, he would be \" hanged like a dog for the play of ' King Richard the Second,' \" ^ but his forebodings were evidently groundless. Donnelly stated that he had worked out much more information upon this topic. It is to be hoped that his executors will publish it. That eminent scholar, Richard Grant White, states that Shakespeare's \" frequent use of Latin derivatives in their radical sense shows a somewhat thoughtful and observant study of that language.\" Shakespeare did far more than use Latin derivatives in their radical sense. He wrenched words and expressions from foreign tongues, and implanted them in our own in a way that has never been done by any writer ^ Quoted in \" The Great Cryptogram,\" p. 628. » \"Cryptogram,\" p. 853. 229"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"'Biographical before or since. The list of \" woodnotes \" on p. 1 84 contains typical examples of Shakespeare's word coin- ing. It is said that a common English labourer uses between three and five hundred words. Milton uses seven thousand, Shakespeare no less than twenty-one thousand — or three times the number used by the poet who, according to Macaulay, \" carried the idiomatic powers of the English tongue to their highest perfection, and to whose style every ancient and every modern language contributed something of grace, of energy and of music.\" ^ Upon this subje6l I quote the following extradt: \" A writer in the ' Chicago Tribune ' calls attention to the surprising faft that the New English Dic- tionary, now being published in England, on a mag- nificent scale, and in which is given the time when, and the places where, each English word made its first appearance, proves that in the first two hundred pages of the work there are one hundred and forty-six words, now in common use, which were invented or formed out of the raw material of his own and other languages, by the man who wrote the Shakespeare Plays. And the writer shows that, at this rate, our total indebtedness to the man we call Shakespeare, for additions to the vocabulary of the English tongue, cannot be less than five thousand words. I quote : ' Quoted in Bacon v. Shakespeare, p. 280. 230"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"'Biographical \" ' Rome owed only one word to Julius Caesar. The nature of our debt will be more apparent if we examine some of these hundred and a half of Shakespearean words, all so near the beginning of the alphabet that the last one of them is air. We owe the poet the first use of the word air itself in one of its senses as a noun, ahd in three as a verb or participle. He first said air-drawn and airless. He added a new signification to airy and aerial. Nobody before him had written aired, and more than a tithe of the verbal gifts now in view were such perfeft parti- ciples. Well-nigh as many were adverbs. In no previous writer have Dr. Murray's argus eyes detedled accidentally, nor any of the following : abjeSlly, acutely, admiringly, adoptedly, adversely. How our fathers could exist so long without some of these vocables, must move our special wonder. To absolutely, accordingly, aBiiiely and affeSiionately Shakespeare added a new sense. It is not a little surprising that the word abreast was never printed before the csffplet : \" Mysoul shall thine keep company to heaven: Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast\" \" ' Of the hundred and forty-six words and meanings first given us by Shakespeare, at least two-thirds are of classical origin. . . .

This fallacy is refuted by a number of eminent writers, including the poet Shelley. It will be sufficient to quote the following : \" The poetic faculty was powerful in Bacon's mind. No imagination was ever at once so strong and so thoroughly subjugated.

The book is watermarked with the fleur-de-lys and the cluster of grapes, but contains no printer's hieroglyphics of any kind, nor any of the emblematic woodcuts which are the distinguishing charadteristics of the majority of Rosicrucian publica- tions. I quote the article without abridgment : \" Bacon (Sir Francis) created Lord Verulam, and Viscount St. Alban's by King James I. in 1620, and advanced by the same King to the dignity of Lord High Chancellor of England, was a younger son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, by his Lady Anne Cooke. With this advantage of great birth he had a suitable educa- tion, and such natural parts, as rais'd him to a greater esteem in the world by his knowledge, then he was in his own country by the honours and dignities. He was born at York House in the Strand in 1560.

He quickly discover'd the empti- ness of Aristotle's Natural Philosophy, as fram'd for disputations, and no ways tending to the benefit of humane life; and though he always spoke of that author with praise, he persisted in this opinion all his life time. After he had run through the whole course of liberal arts, he applied himself particularly to the study of politicks, to which his genius led him. And when Sir Amias Paulet went Ambassador to the French Court, he was sent with him into France, where he was soon after employ'd agent between the two Courts, till his father's death call'd him home to look after his own private concerns. Then he grew a great statesman and was chosen the Queen's ad- vocate at thirty years of age ; his generous and affable disposition procur'd him all men's love and wonder. He instill'd wholesome precepts of prudence and honour to noblemen, sound principles of art and science to the learned, noble maxims of government to princes, excellent rules of life to the people.

One fault he had, that he was above the age he lived in, in his bounties to such as brought him presents, and over indulgent to his servants, whose rise prov'd his fall. How little he valued wealth, appears in that when his servants would take money from his closet, he would say, ' aye poor men, that is their portion.' But he wanted at last what he was so careless of, if what is said be true, that he grew a burden to Sir Julius Caesar, who kept him, and that the Lord Brook, denied him small beer : yet he had kept his Chancellor's place nineteen years, and did not forfeit it by any oiFence against the king, but fell by the same hand that raised him, the then Duke of Buckingham. He died without issue at Highgate, in the Earl of Arundel's House, Ap. 9, 1626, in the 66th year of his age, and was buried in St. Michael Church, near St. Albans, where Sir Thomas Mute, formerly his Secretary, eredled a monument of white marble to his memory, with an epitaph compos'd by Sir Henry Wotton. It was said of him that as Socrates brought morality to discourse, so did he philosophy from speculation to experience. Sir Walter Rawleigh us'd to say, that the Earl of Salis- bury was a good orator, but bad writer ; the Earl of Northampton a good writer but bad orator ; and that Sir Francis Bacon excell'd in both. He left us these following books: ' Historia Regni Henry VII. de 243"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"'Biographical sapientia veterum.' * De bello sacro.' *De natural! et universal! philosophia. ' Historia ventorum.' ' His- toria vitae et mortis.' ' De dignitate et augmentis scientiarum.' 'Novum Organum scientiarum.' \" We are here told that Buckingham was responsible for Bacon's fall, and that this was also partly due to carelessness in money matters, and over-indulgence to dependants. Gehazi was neither the first nor the last dishonest servant, and among Bacon's personal servitors and permanent Court Officials, \" the Chan- cellor's jackals,\" Macaulay calls them, it is neither impossible nor unlikely that some were quite ready to accept bribes and gifts intended for the Lord Chan- cellor, but which never reached his hands, and of which he was perfedlly unconscious. It is scarcely necessary to say that many writers con- sider the case against the Lord Chancellor to be not proven. When, on his dismissal, a number of dis- contented litigants, against whom he had given judg- ment, appealed for a reversal of his verdidis, on re- trial of these cases not a single one of the appeals succeeded. This is sufficient proof that whether or not the Lord Chancellor accepted gifts from suitors, he was not bribed thereby to give false judgment. I am aware that Bacon admitted the justice of his sentence, and confessed himself to be guilty of cor- ruption — seemingly a most improbable and unlikely 244"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"biographical thing had he been otherwise — but it is possible that he was aware his ruin was inevitable, and that he was advised by the King, that it would be politic, and likely to lighten his sentence, were he to plead guilty : \" How eagerly ye follow my disgraces, As if it fed ye ! and how sleek and wanton Ye appear in everything, may bring my ruin.

He writes to Parliament again : \"It resteth therefore that without fig-leaves, I do ingenuously confess and acknowledge, that having understood the particulars of the charge, not formally from the House, but enough to inform my conscience and my memory ; I find matters sufiicient and full, both to move me to desert my defence, and to move your Lordships to condemn and censure me. \" Neither will I trouble your Lordships by singling those particulars which I think might fall off, ^id te exemptajuvat spinis de pluribus una ?

We find him writing to Buckingham : \" This matter of pomp, which is Heaven to some men, is Hell to me\" (May, 1617). It is not an unlikely probability that, having sounded all the depths and shoals of honour — \" His overthrow heaped happiness upon him ; For then, and not till then, he felt himself.

After his degradation from office we find him writing to his friend, the Bishop of Winchester : \" So now, being as I am, no more able to do my country service, it remained unto me to do it honour ; which I have endeavoured to do in my work of the reign of King Henry the VII.

The passage quoted is from the 1605 edition of \"The Advancement of Learning,\" but Bacon subsequently discovered that the theory that everything that has motion, has likewise sense, was untenable, and in the 1623 edition of the same book, he expressly declares that the dodrine is untrue. The quotation from \"Shakespeare\" is from the 1604 quarto edition of \" Hamlet.\" In the folio edition, (published in the same year as \" The Advancement of Learning\" 1623), the passage in question, no longer harmonizing with Bacon's views, was omitted. In order to rightly realize the significance of these and other parallels, we must remember that the relative positions of Bacon and Shakespeare were those of an aristocratic philosopher and of an almost, if not quite, social pariah.

Bacon had money embarked in this unfor- tunate venture. \" In Henry VIII.\" we see the writer limning Jiimself as Wolsey. In a letter from Bacon to the King (1622) he uses, in the original draft, words which, in the following year, appear in the mouth of Wolsey. The banquet scene laid at York House in all probability refleds the great banquet which Bacon gave while living at York House, and which has been made famous by Ben Jonson's Birthday Ode to the Lord Chancellor. In \"Timon of Athens\" we see the fall of a large- hearted and over-generous patron. Upon this tragedy the curtain rings down. 266"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"POSTSCRIPT \"Now if any Brother or Well-wisher shall con- scientiously doubt or be dissatisfied^ touching any particular Point contained in this 1'reatise, because of my speaking to many things in a little room : And if he or they shall be serious in so doings and will be-friend me so far, and do me that courtesie, to send to me, before they condemn me, and let me know their scruples in a few words of writing, I shall look upon my self obliged both in affeSlion and reason, to en- deavour to give them full satisfaStion.\" H.
