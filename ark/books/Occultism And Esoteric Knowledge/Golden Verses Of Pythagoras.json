The Golden Verses may be divided into two parts, th e first treating of the Practical or Human Virtues, whose a im is the making of Good Men; and the second, treating of the Contemplative or Divine Virtues, the end of which is to make Good Men into Gods. One is greatly struck by the wonderful completeness of the Verses, and their scientific arrangement. They can be divided into groups dealing with practically every aspect a nd affair of life. At the end of the first part (verse 47), we find th e Most Solemn Oath that if a man follow these precepts faithfully , he will be ready to tread the further path, to devote himself to the Contemplative Virtues, and to become truly God-like , overcoming Death, and gaining a knowledge of the Go ds. The Verses may be grouped in the following manner:- - PART I.--THE PRACTICAL VIRTUES. Verses. 1-3. Concerning Higher Intelligences. 4. Concerning Relations. 5-8. Concerning Friends. 9-12. Concerning One's Lower Nature. 13-14. Concerning One's General Behaviour. 15-20. Concerning Death and Misfortunes. 21-23. Concerning Doctrines. 24-31. Concerning Actions and Speech."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 32-34. Concerning the Body. 35-39. Concerning the Manner of Life. 40-45. Concerning Introspection. 46, 47.

Concerning the Nature of the Universe, and what is possible. 54-60. Concerning Ignorance, and the Liberty of the Soul. 61-66. Concerning Knowledge and Deliverance. 67-69. Concerning Purifications. 70, 71. Concerning the Result of the Contemplative Virtues. NOTES Verse 1. \"Worship the Immortal Gods\" with an unders tanding as to their order and function in the universe. For it is Impossible to worship unless you understand to some extent the na ture and function of that which you worship. The Gods do not occupy their position by accident, nor from carelessness o n the part of the Great Architect, nor are they isolated units in dependent of each other, but rather are they linked together in such a way as to form one perfect whole, like the different parts of one animal. Pythagoras seems to have divided the beings in the universe roughly into three orders:--"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 (1) The Immortal Gods whose who live perpetually in the knowledge of God the Father and Creator of all, being secured from change or separation from Him); (2) The Heroes, and (3) The Terrestrial Dæmons. 2. Besides the Power that creates a universe, it is necessary that there should be a power that preserves and sustains it, and this power is embodied in the created beings. For in their essence all beings are of one nature w ith the Father, and just in so far as they are conscious of Him wil l they carry out His will and design. They are said to be bound by an Oath to preserve all things in their respective places and to maintain the beauty and harmony of the universe; but this Oath i s in reality innate and essential to them, because it is born with them and is part of their divine nature. There fore, the Oath is constantly observed by the Immortal Gods, they b eing always conscious of the Divine Will; but by the Heroes onl y to the extent to which they understand and know God. The mortal Oath--that used amongst men--has to be r everenced as an image of the other, and as leading to the gre atest strength and stability of character. And if man would revere nce the Oath, then must he do all in his power to understand the laws that govern this universe, and endeavour to preserve har mony and order in all things. The Illustrious Heroes are the second or middle order of beings, and are turned ever towards God, though not always to the same extent. They are divided into three subdivisions:-- (1) The Angels, or Ambassadors (being nearest to the Immort al Gods in their nature); (2) The Dæmons, or Spirits; and (3) The Heroes."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 3. The Terrestrial Dæmons are the souls of men, beautified with truth and virtue, being Masters of Wisdom, having t rue knowledge. They are \"terrestrial,\" remaining on ear th in order to guide and govern men. The best worship to be offered to these men (who ar e men and yet resemble the Illustrious Heroes), is by obeying those precepts they have left and recommended to us, and by following their instructions as laws; purposing to ourselves the same course of life they lead, the tradition of whi ch they have set down in writing. This tradition gives the princ iples of truth and rules of virtue, as an immortal and paternal in heritance, to be preserved to all succeeding generations for the common good. To obey these, and live accordingly, is the t ruest reverence that can be done them. 4. \"Reverence thy parents.\" But how it those parent s be depraved? \"If the Divine Law directs us to one thin g and our parents to another, then in this deliberation we ou ght to obey the best, disobeying our parents in those things only in which they recede from the Divine Laws.\" But always a most willing service and obedience mus t be rendered in all things pertaining to the body or es tate. To all others, the duties are in proportion to the nearness of the relationship. 7, 8. Never must friendship be broken for the sake of riches, or glory, or other frail and perishable things. Only i f the friend falls into a corrupt and degraded mode of life is it righ t to break the sacred tie of friendship, and then only after every effort has been made to bring him back to the ways of virtue. Hierocles warns us that we have far more strength t han we imagine, and all we need is to feel the necessity of preserving friendship."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 11, 12. If a man makes himself his own guardian, he is then not likely to fall into evil ways if he is out of the r each of public opinion, nor will he be rushed into folly through t he influence of companions. 17. Such calamities as diseases, poverty, loss of f riends, etc., are not real ills, for they hurt not the soul, unless i t suffers Itself to be precipitated into vice by them. 21-23. One should be able to hear every sort of doc trine patiently, carefully discriminating between the tru e and the false. \"But it falsehoods be advanced,\" i. e. , false reasonings. 45. This verse completes the instruction concerning the Civil or Practical Virtues ; verse 48 begins the Instruction concerning the Contemplative Virtues . Regarding the practical virtues, Hierocles points o ut that the three aspects of the soul should be employed on the m together, (1) Activity, (2) the Mind, and (3) the Emotions. 47. \"I swear it by him,\" i. e. , by Pythagoras. The knowledge of the Quaternion was one of the chief precepts among the Pythagoreans. 51. \"How far they extend themselves,\" expresses the ir specific difference, and \"What contains and binds them toget her\" marks their generic community. 53. \"Thou shalt not hope what thou ought'st not to hope,\" knowing the nature of all things, and what is possi ble. 55. The Gods near at hand are virtue and truth. 59, 60.

The Dæmon of whom they make use is their own so ul, or essence, for to see and know this is to be freed fr om all evils. 67. The Purifications are divided into two parts, one concerning itself with the physical body, and the other with t he \"luminous body.\" The Deliverance of the Soul is accomplished by \"Dialecticks, which science is the intimate inspection of beings. \" Of the two former, one purifies through diet and th e whole management and usage of the mortal body; and the ot her employs the Mathematical Sciences, Meditation, and Religious Ceremonies. All three Purifications must be accomplished if man would become free, and Godlike. It is to be noted that th ey deal with (1) the body, (2) the emotions and lower mind, and (3) the higher mind.

Request not of Divinity such things as, when obt ained, you cannot preserve; for no gift of Divinity can ever b e taken away; and on this account he does not confer that which y ou are unable to retain. 2. Be vigilant in your intellectual part; for sleep about this has an affinity with real death. 3. Divinity sends evil to men, not as being influen ced by anger, but for the sake of purification; for anger is fore ign from Divinity, since it arises from circumstances taking place contrary to the will; but nothing contrary to the w ill can happen to a god. 4. When you deliberate whether or not you shall inj ure another, you will previously suffer the evil yourself which you intend to commit. But neither must you expect any good from t he evil; for the manners of everyone are correspondent to his li fe and actions. Every soul too is a repository, that which is good, of things good, that which is evil, of things depraved . 5. After long consultation, engage either in speaki ng or acting; for you have not the ability to recall either your words or deeds. 6. Divinity does not principally esteem the tongue, but the deeds of the wise; for a wise man, even when he is silent , honours Divinity. 7. A loquacious and ignorant man both in prayer and sacrifice contaminates a divine nature. The wise man therefor e is alone a priest, is alone a friend of Divinity and o nly knows how to pray. 8.

It is more painful to be subservient to passion s than to tyrants. 12. It is better to converse more with yourself tha n others. 13. If you are always careful to remember that in w hatever place either your soul or body accomplishes any deed, Div inity is present as an inspector of your conduct; in all you r words and actions you will venerate the presence of an inspec tor from whom nothing can be concealed, and will, at the same time, possess Divinity as an intimate associat e. 14.

For a lover of pleasure is also a lover of body; but a lover of bo dy is entirely a lover of riches; a lover of riches is necessarily u njust; and the unjust is necessarily profane towards Divinity, and lawless with respect to men.

"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 51 THE SYMBOLS OF PYTHAGORAS All the Symbols are exhortatory in common to the wh ole of virtue; but particularly each to some particular vi rtue. Different symbols also are differently adapted to parts of ph ilosophy and discipline. Thus for instance the first Symbol dire ctly exhorts to piety and divine science. SYMBOL 1. When going to the temple to adore Divinity neither say nor do any thing in the interim pertaining to the common a ffairs of life. Explanation .--This Symbol preserves a divine nature such as it is in itself pure and undefiled: for the pure is wont to be conjoined to the pure. It also causes us to introduce nothing from human affa irs into the worship of Divinity; for all such things are foreig n from, and contrary to, religious worship. This Symbol also gr eatly contributes to science; for in divine science it is necessary to introduce nothing of this kind; such as human conce ptions, or those pertaining to the concerns of life. We are ex horted to nothing else, therefore, by these words than this: that we should not mingle sacred discourses and divine actions wit h the instability of human manners. SYMBOL 2. Neither enter into a temple negligently, nor in sho rt adore carelessly, not even though you should stand at the very doors themselves. Explanation .--With the preceding this symbol also accords. For if the similar is friendly and allied to the simila r, it is evident that since the gods have a. most principal essence among wholes, we ought to make the worship of them a prin cipal object. p. 69"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 52 But he who does this for the sake of anything else, gives a secondary rank to that which takes the precedency o f all things, and subverts the whole order of religious worship a nd knowledge. Besides, it is not proper to rank illust rious goods in the subordinate condition of human utility, nor to place our condition in the order of an end, but things more e xcellent, whether they be works or conceptions, in the condit ion of an appendage. SYMBOL 3. Sacrifice and adore unshod. Explanation .--An exhortation to the same thing may also be obtained from this Symbol. For it signifies that we ought to worship the gods and acquire a knowledge of them or derly and modestly, and in a manner not surpassing our condit ion on earth. It also signifies that in worshipping them, and acq uiring this knowledge, we should be free from bonds, and proper ly liberated. But the Symbol exhorts that sacrifice an d adoration should be performed not only in the body, but also in the energies of the soul; so that these energies may neither be detained by passions, nor by the imbecil ities of the body, nor by generation, with which we are external ly surrounded, But everything pertaining to us should be properly liberated, and prepared for the participation of th e gods. SYMBOL 4. Disbelieve nothing wonderful concerning the gods, n or concerning divine dogmas. Explanation .--This Symbol in like manner exhorts to the same virtue. For this dogma sufficiently venerates and u nfolds the transcendency of the gods. Affording us a viaticum and recalling to our memory that we ought not to estimate divine power from our judgment.

At the same time, however, we perfect ly fall short of the gods, and neither possess the same power wit h them, nor equal virtue, This Symbol, therefore, in a particul ar manner introduces the knowledge of the gods, as beings who are able to effect all things. On this account it exhorts us to disbelieve nothing concerning the gods. It also adds, nor abou t divine dogmas, that is to say, these belonging to the Pyth agoric philosophy. For these being secured by discipline a nd scientific theory, are alone true and free from falsehood, bei ng corroborated by all various demonstration accompani ed with necessity. The same Symbol also is capable of exhor ting us to the science concerning the gods; for it urges us to acquire a science of that kind through which we shall be in n o respect deficient in things asserted about the gods. It is also able to exhort the same things concerning divine dogmas. an d a disciplinative progression, For disciplines alone g ive eyes to and produce light about all things in him who intends to consid er and survey them. For from the participation of disciplines, on e thing before all others is effected, that is to say, a belief in the nature, essence, and power of the gods, and also in those P ythagoric dogmas which appear to be prodigious to such as hav e not been introduced to, and are uninitiated in, disciplines. So that the precept disbelieve not is equivalent to participate , and acquire , those things through which you will not disbelieve; that is to say, acquire disciplines and scientific demonstrati ons. SYMBOL 5."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 54 Declining from the public ways, walk in unfrequente d paths. Explanation .--I think that this Symbol also contributes to the same thing as the preceding. For this exhorts us to abandon a popular and merely human life; but thinks fit that we should pursue a separate and divine life. It also signifie s that it is necessary to look above common opinions; but very m uch to esteem such as are private and arcane; and that we should despise merely human delight; but ardently pursue that felicitous mode of conduct which adhere s to the divine will. It likewise exhorts us to dismiss huma n manners as popular, and to exchange for these the religious cu ltivation of the gods, transcending a popular life. SYMBOL 6. Abstain from Melanurus 1 ; for it belongs to the terrestrial gods. Explanation .--This Symbol also is allied to the preceding. Oth er particulars therefore pertaining to it we shall spe ak of in our discourse about the Symbols. 2 So far then as it pertains to exhortation it admonishes us to embrace the celesti al journey, to conjoin ourselves to the intellectual gods, to beco me separated from a material nature, and to be led, as it were i n a circular progression to an immaterial and pure life. It furt her exhorts us to adopt the most excellent worship of the gods, an d especially that which pertains to the primary gods. 3 Such, therefore, are the exhortations to the knowledge an d worship of Divinity. The following Symbols exhort to wisdom. SYMBOL 7. Govern your tongue before all other things, followi ng the gods. Explanation .--For it is the first work of wisdom to convert reason to itself and to accustom it not to proceed externally, but to be perfected in itself and in a conversion to it self. But the second work consists in following the gods. For not hing so"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 55 perfects the intellect as, when being converted Int o Itself, it at the same time follows Divinity. SYMBOL 8. The wind is blowing, adore the wind. Explanation .--This Symbol also is a token of divine wisdom. For it obscurely signifies that we ought to love th e similitude of the divine essences and powers, and when their words accord with their energies, to honour and rev erence them with the greatest earnestness. SYMBOL 9. Cut not fire with a sword. 1 Explanation .--This Symbol exhorts to prudence. For it excites in us an appropriate conception with the respect to th e propriety of not opposing sharp words to a man full of fire and wrath, nor contending with him. For frequently by words you wi ll agitate and disturb an ignorant man, and will yourself suff er things dreadful and unpleasant. Heraclitus also testifies to the truth of this Symbol, for he says, \"It is difficult to fight with anger; for whatever is necessary to be done, benefits the soul.\" For many by gratifying anger have changed the condition of t he soul, and have made death preferable to life. But by governin g the tongue and being quiet, friendship is produced from strife , the fire of anger being extinguished, and you yourself will not appear to be destitute of intellect. SYMBOL 10. Remove yourself from every vinegar bottle. Explanation .--The truth of the preceding is testified by the present Symbol. For it exhorts to prudence and not to anger; since that which is sharp in the soul and which we call anger is deprived of reasoning and prudence. For anger boils like a kettle"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 56 heated by the fire, being attentive to nothing but its own emotions, and dividing the judgment into minute par ts. It is proper therefore that the soul being established in quiet should turn from anger, which frequently attacks itself as if it touched sounding brass. Hence it is requisite to suppress t his passion by the reasoning power. SYMBOL 11. Assist a man in raising a burden; but do not assist him in laying it down. Explanation .--This Symbol exhorts to fortitude, for whoever takes up a burden signifies an action of labour and energy; but he who lays one down, of rest and remission. So tha t the Symbol has the following meaning. Do not become either to yourself or anothe r the cause of an indolent and effeminate mode of conduct; for every useful thing is acquired by labour. But the Pythagoreans c elebrate this Symbol as Herculean, thus denominating it from the labours of Hercules. For, during his association with men, he frequently returned from fire and everything dreadful, indigna ntly rejecting indolence. For rectitude of conduct is produced fro m acting and operating, but not from sluggishness. SYMBOL 12. When stretching forth your feet to have your sandal s put on, first extend your right foot; but when about to use a foo t-bath, first extend your left foot. Explanation .--This Symbol exhorts to practical prudence, admonishing us to place worthy actions about us as right- handed; but entirely to lay aside and throw away su ch as are base, as being left-handed. SYMBOL 13. Speak not about Pythagorean concerns without light."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 57 Explanation .--This Symbol exhorts to the possession of intelle ct according to prudence. For this is similar to the l ight of the soul, to which being indefinite it gives bound, and leads it, as it were, from darkness into light. It is proper, therefore, to place intellect as the leader of everything beautiful in life, but especially in Pythagorean dogmas; for these cannot be known witho ut light. SYMBOL 14. Step not beyond the beam of the balance. Explanation .--This Symbol exhorts us to the exercise of justic e, to the honouring equality and moderation in an admi rable degree, and to the knowledge of justice as the most perfect virtue, to which the other virtues give completion, and without which none of the rest are of any advantage. It als o admonishes us that it is proper to know this virtue not in a c areless manner, but through theorems 1 and scientific demonstrations. But this knowledge is the business of no other art and science than the Pythagorean philosophy alone, which in a t ranscendent degree honours disciplines before everything else. SYMBOL 15. Having departed from your house, turn not back; for the furies will be your attendants. Explanation .--This Symbol also exhorts to philosophy and self- operating energy according to intellect. It clearly manifests too and predicts, that having applied yourself to philo sophy, you should separate yourself from everything corporeal and sensible, and truly meditate upon death, proceeding, without turning back, to things intelligible and which always subsi st according to the same and after a similar manner, through app ropriate disciplines; for journeying is a change of place; a nd death is the separation of the soul from the body. But we should philosophize truly and without sensible and corpore al energies,"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 58 employing a pure intellect in the apprehension of t he truth of things, which knowledge, when acquired, is wisdom. But having applied yourself to philosophy, turn not back nor suffer yourself to be drawn to former obje cts and to corporeal natures together with which you were nour ished. For by so doing you will be attended by abundant repent ance, in consequence of being impeded in sane apprehensions by the darkness in which corporeal natures are involved. B ut the Symbol denominates repentance, the furies. Symbol 16. Being turned to the sun, make not water. Explanation .--The exhortation of this Symbol is as follows: Attempt to do nothing which is merely of an animal nature; but philosophize, looking to the heavens and the sun. L et the light of truth also be your leader, and remember that no abj ect conceptions must be admitted in philosophy; but asc end to the gods and wisdom through the survey of the celestial orbs. Having likewise applied yourself to philosophy and purified yourself by the light of truth which is in it; bein g also, converted to a pursuit of this kind, to theology, to physiolo gy, and so astronomy, and to the knowledge of that cause which is above all these; no longer do anything of a merely brutal nature. SYMBOL 17. Wipe not a seat with a torch. Explanation .--This Symbol also exhorts the same thing. For since a torch is of a purifying nature In consequen ce of its rapid and abundant participation of fire, in the same man ner as what is called sulphur, the Symbol not only exhorts not to defile it, since it is itself abstergent of defilements, nor to oppo se its natural aptitude by defiling that which is an impediment to defilement; but rather that we should not mingle the peculiarit ies of wisdom"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 59 with those of the merely animal nature. For a torch through the bright light it emits is compared to philosophy; bu t a seat through its lowly condition to the merely animal na ture. SYMBOL 18. Nourish a cock; but sacrifice it not; for it is sac red to the sun and the moon. Explanation .--This Symbol advises us to nourish and strengthen the body and not neglect it, dissolving and destroying the mighty to kens of union, connection, sympathy, and consent of the world. So that it exhorts us to engage in the contemplation and philo sophy of the universe. For though the truth concerning the unive rse is naturally occult, and sufficiently difficult of inv estigation, it must, however, at the same time, be enquired into a nd investigated by man, and especially through philoso phy. For it is truly impossible to be discovered through any other pursuit. But philosophy, receiving certain sparks, and as it wer e viatica, from nature, excites and expands them into magnitude, re ndering them more conspicuous through the disciplines which it possesses. Hence, therefore, we should philosophize . SYMBOL 19. Sit not upon a bushel. Explanation .--The Symbol may be considered more Pythagorically, beginning from the same principles with those above. For since nutriment is to be measured by the corporeal and animal nature, and not by a bushel, do not pass your life in indolence nor without being initiated into philosophy; but de dicating yourself to this, rather provide for that part of y ou which is more divine, which is soul, and much more for the intell ect which"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 60 soul contains; the nutriment of which is measured, not by a bushel, but by contemplation and discipline. SYMBOL 20. Nourish not that which has crooked nails. Explanation .--This Symbol also in a more Pythagorean manner advises us to communicate and impart, and prepare o thers to do so, accustoming them to give and receive without de pravity and abundantly; not indeed receiving everything insatia bly and giving nothing. For the physical organization of an imals with crooked nails is adapted to receive rapidly and wit h facility, but by no means to relinquish what they hold, or impart to others, through the opposition of the nails in consequence of their being crooked; just as the fish called crangœ 1 , are naturally adapted to draw anything to themselves with celerity, but r elinquish it with difficulty, unless by turning from, we avoid them. But hands we re indeed suspended from us by nature, that through them we m ight both give and receive, and the fingers, also, are natura lly attached to the hands, straight and not crooked. In things of t his kind, therefore, we must not imitate animals with crooked nails, since we are fashioned by our maker in a different way, b ut should rather be communicative and impart to each other, b eing exhorted to a thing of this kind by the fabricators of names themselves, who denominated the right hand more hon ourable than the left, not only from receiving but from bei ng capable of imparting. We must act justly therefore, and throug h this philosophize. For justice is a certain retribution and remuneration equalizing the abounding and deficient by reciprocal gifts. 2 SYMBOL 21. Cut not in the way."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 61 Explanation .--This Symbol manifests that truth is one, but falsehood multifarious. But this is evident from he nce, that what any particular thing is can be predicted only in one way, if it be properly predicted; but what it is not , may be predicted in infinite ways. Philosophy, too, appears to be a pat h or way. The Symbol therefore says, Choose that philosophy, and that path to philosophy in which there is no division, and in wh ich you will not dogmatize things contradictory to each other, b ut such as are stable and the same with themselves, being establis hed by scientific demonstration through disciplines and co ntemplation; which is the same thing as if it said, Philosophize Pythagorically . And this is indeed possible. But the philosophy which proceeds through things corporeal and sensibl e, and which is employed by the moderns even to satiety, w hich likewise considers Divinity, qualities, the soul, t he virtues, and in short all the most principal causes of things to be body,--this philosophy easily eludes the grasp, and is easily s ubverted. 1 And this is evident from the various arguments of i ts advocates. On the other hand, the philosophy which proceeds through t hings incorporeal, intelligible, immaterial, and perpetua l, and which always subsist according to the same, and in a simi lar manner, and never, as far as possible to them, admit either corruption or mutation, being similar to their subjects,--this ph ilosophy is the artificer of firm, stable, and undeviating demonstr ations. The precept, therefore, admonishes us when we philosoph ize, and Proceed in the way pointed out, to fly from the sna res of, and avoid all connection with, things corporeal and mul tifarious, but to become familiar with the essence of the incorpor eal natures, which at all times are similar to themselves, throu gh the truth and stability which they naturally contain. SYMBOL 22. Receive not a swallow into your house."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 62 Explanation .--This Symbol admonishes as follows: Do not admit to your dogmas a man who is indolent, who doe s not labour incessantly, and who is not a firm adherent to the Pythagorean sect, and endued with intelligence; for these dogmas require continued and most strenuous attention. and an endurance of l abour through the mutation and circumvolution of the vari ous disciplines which they contain. But it uses the swa llow as an image of indolence and an interruption of time, bec ause this bird visits us for a certain part of the year, and for a short time becomes as it were our guest; but leaves us for the greater part of the year and is not seen by us. SYMBOL 23. Wear not a ring. Explanation .--We should understand this Symbol as an exhortation to the Pythagorean doctrine as follows: A ring embraces those that wear it after the manner of a b ond; and a peculiarity of it is neither to pinch nor pain the wearer, but in a certain respect to be accommodated and adapted to h im. But the body is a bond of this kind to the soul. The precep t, therefore, Wear not a ring , is equivalent to, Philosophize truly, and separate your soul from its surrounding bond . For philosophy is the meditation of death and the separation of the s oul from the body. Betake yourself, therefore, with great earnestness to the Pythagorea n philosophy, which through intellect separates itself from all c orporeal natures, and is conversant through speculative disc iplines with things intelligible and immaterial. Liberate yourse lf also from sin and from those occupations of the flesh which d raw you aside from, and impede the philosophic energy; like wise from superabundant nourishment and unseasonable repletio n, which confine the soul like a bond and incessantly introd uce a crowd of diseases, and interruptions of leisure."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 63 SYMBOL 24. Inscribe not the image of God in a ring. Explanation .--This Symbol, conformably to the foregoing conception, employs the following exhortation: Phil osophize, and before everything consider the gods as having a n incorporeal subsistence. For this is the most princ ipal root of the Pythagorean dogmas, from which nearly all of them a re suspended, and by which they are strengthened even to the end. Do not, therefore, think that the gods use such for ms as are corporeal, or that they are received by a material subject and by body as a material bond, li ke other animals. But the engravings in rings exhibit the bo nd which subsists through the ring, its corporeal nature, an d sensible form, and the view, as it were, of some partial animal wh ich becomes apparent through the engraving; from which especial ly we should separate the genus of the gods as being eter nal and intelligible, and always subsisting according to th e same and in a similar manner, as we have particularly, most ful ly, and scientifically shown in our discourse concerning th e gods. 1 SYMBOL 25. Behold not yourself in a mirror by the light of a l amp. Explanation .--This Symbol advises us in a more Pythagorean manner to philosophize, not betaking ourselves to t he imaginations belonging to the senses, which produce indeed a certain light about our apprehensions of things; bu t this light resembles that of a lamp, and is neither natural no r true. It admonishes us, therefore, rather to betake ourselves to scientific conceptions about intellect ual objects, from which a most splendid and stable purity is pro duced about the eye of the soul, resulting from all intellectua l conceptions and intelligibles, and the contemplation about thes e, and not from corporeal and sensible natures. For we have fr equently"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 64 shown that these are in a continual flux and mutati on, and do not in any manner subsist stably and similar to themsel ves, so as to sustain a firm and scientific apprehension and know ledge in the same manner as the objects of Intellectual vision. SYMBOL 26. Be not addicted to immoderate laughter. Explanation .--This Symbol shows that the passions are to be subdued, Recall, therefore, Into your memory right reason, and be not inflated with prosperity nor abject in calam ity; being persuaded that no worthy attention takes place in e ither of these. But this Symbol mentions laughter above all the pas sions, because this alone is most conspicuous, being, as i t were, a certain efflorescence and inflammation of the dispo sition proceeding as far as to the face. Perhaps, too, it admonishes us to abstain from immoderate laughte r, because laughter is the peculiarity of man with respect to other animals; and hence he is defined to be a risible animal. It is shown, therefore, by this precept, that we should not firm ly adhere to the human nature, but acquire by philosophizing am imitation of divinity to the utmost of our power; and withdrawin g ourselves from this peculiarity of man, prefer the rational t o the risible in the distinction and difference which we make of him with respect to other animals. SYMBOL 27. Cut not your nails at a sacrifice. Explanation .--The exhortation of this Symbol pertains to friendship. For of our relations and those allied t o us by blood, the nearest of kin are brothers, children, and pare nts, who resemble those parts of our body which when taken a way produce pain and mutilation by no means trifling; s uch as fingers, hands, ears, nostrils, and the like. But o thers who are"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 65 distantly related to us, such as the daughters of c ousins, or the sons-in-law of uncles, or others of this kind, resemble those parts of our body from the cut ting off of which no pain is produced; such as hair, nails, and the like. The Symbol, therefore, wishing to indicate those relati ons who have been for a time neglected by us through the distanc e of their alliance, employs the word nails, and says: Do not entirely cast off these; but if at sacrifices, or any other time, you have neglected them, draw them to you, and renew your fa miliarity with them. SYMBOL 28. Offer not your right hand easily to everyone. Explanation .--The meaning of this Symbol is, Do not draw up, nor endeavour to raise, by extending your right han d, the unadapted and uninitiated. It also signifies that t he right hand is not to be given easily even to those who have for a long time proved themselves worthy of it through disciplines and doctrines, and the participation of continence, the quinquennial silence, 1 and other probationary trials. SYMBOL 29. When rising from the bed-clothes, roll them togethe r and obliterate the impression of the body. Explanation .--This Symbol exhorts that, having applied yoursel f to philosophy, in the next place you should familia rize yourself with intelligible and incorporeal natures. Rising therefore from the sleep and nocturnal darkn ess of ignorance, draw off with you nothing corporeal to t he daylight of philosophy, but purify and obliterate from your memory all the vestiges of that sleep of ignorance. SYMBOL 30."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 66 Eat not the heart. Explanation .--This Symbol signifies that it is not proper to divulse the union and consent of the universe. And still further it signifies this, Be not envious, but philanthropic a nd communicative; and from this it exhorts us to philo sophize. For philosophy alone among the sciences and arts is nei ther pained with the goods of others, nor rejoices in evils of neighbours, these being allied and familiar by nature, subject to the like passions, a nd exposed to one common fortune; and evinces that all men are eq ually incapable of foreseeing future events. Hence it exh orts us to sympathy and mutual love, and to be truly communica tive, as it becomes rational animals. SYMBOL 31. Eat not the brain. Explanation .--This Symbol also resembles the former; for the brain is the ruling instrument of intellectual prud ence. The Symbol, therefore, obscurely signifies that we ough t not to dilacerate nor mangle things and dogmas which have been the objects of judicious deliberation. But these will b e such as have been the subject of intellectual consideration, bec oming thus equal to objects of a scientific nature. For things of this kind are to be surveyed, not through the instruments of the irrational form of the soul, such as the heart and the liver; but through the pure rational nature. Hence to dilacerate these by opposition, is inconsiderate folly; but the Symbol rather exhorts us to venerate the fountain of intelligence and the most proximate organ of intellectual perception, through which we shall possess contemplation, science, and wisdom; a nd by which we shall truly philosophize, and neither confound n or obscure the vestiges which philosophy produces. SYMBOL 32."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 67 Indignantly turn from your excrements and the parin gs of your nails. Explanation .--The meaning of this Symbol is as follows: Despise things which are connascent with you, and w hich in a certain respect are more destitute of soul, since t hings which are more animated are more honourable. Thus also when y ou apply yourself to philosophy, honour the things which are demonstrated through soul and intellect without sen sible instruments, and through contemplative science, but despise and reject things which are opined merely through the c onnascent instruments of sense without intellectual light, an d which are by no means able to acquire the perpetuity of intellec t. SYMBOL 33. Receive not Erythinus. 1 Explanation .--This Symbol seems to be merely referred to the etymology of the name. Receive not an unblushing an d impudent man, nor on the contrary one stupidly asto nished, and who in everything blushes and is humble in the extr eme through the imbecility of his intellect and dianötic 2 power. Hence this also is understood: Be not yourself such a one. SYMBOL 34. Obliterate the mark of the pot from the ashes. Explanation .--This Symbol signifies, that he who applies himself to philosophy should consign to oblivion th e confusion and grossness which subsists in corporeal and sensi ble demonstrations, and that he should rather use such as are conversant with intelligible objects. But ashes are here assumed instead of the dust in the tables, in which the Pythagoreans completed their demonstratio ns. 1 SYMBOL 35."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 68 Draw not near to that which has gold, in order to p roduce children. Explanation .--The Symbol does not here speak of a woman, but of that sect and philosophy which has much of the c orporeal in it, and a gravitating tendency downwards. For gold is the heaviest of all things in the earth, and pursues a tendency to the middle, which is the peculiarity of corporeal weigh t; but the term to draw near not only signifies to be connecte d with, but always to approach towards, and be seated near, ano ther. SYMBOL 36. Honour a figure and a step before a figure and a tr ibolus. Explanation .--The exhortation of this Symbol is as follows: Philosophize and diligently betake yourself to disc iplines, and through these, as through steps, proceed to the thi ng proposed; but reject the progression through those things which are honoured and venerated by the many. Prefer also the Italic philo sophy, 1 which contemplates things essentially incorporeal, to the Ionic, 2 which makes bodies the principal object of consideration. SYMBOL 37. Abstain from beans. Explanation .--This Symbol admonishes us to beware of everything which is corruptive of our converse with the gods and divine prophecy. SYMBOL 38. Transplant mallows indeed in your garden; but eat t hem not."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 69 Explanation .--This Symbol obscurely signifies that plants of t his kind turn with the sun, and it thinks fit that this should be noticed by us. It also adds transplant , that is to say, observe its nature, its tendency towards , and sympathy with, the sun; but rest not satisfied, nor dwell up on this, but transfer, and as it were transplant your conception to kindred plants and pot-herbs, and also to animals which are not kindred, to stones, and rivers, and in short to natures of e very kind. For you will find them to be prolific and multiform, an d admirably abundant; and this to one who begins from the mallo ws, as from a root and principle, is significant of the union a nd consent of the world. Not only, therefore, do not destroy or o bliterate observations of this kind, but increase and multipl y them as if they were transplanted. SYMBOL 39. Abstain from animals. Explanation .--This Symbol exhorts to justice, to all the honou r of kindred, to the reception of similar life, and t o many other things of a like kind. From all this, therefore, th e exhortatory type through symbols becomes apparent, which contai ns much in it of the ancient and Pythagorean mode of writin g. Footnotes 73:1 According to Œlian and Suldas, Melanurus is a fish ; but as the word signifies that which has a black termination , it is very appropriately used as a Symbol of a material nature . 73:2 Iamblichus most likely alludes here to a more copi ous work on this subject, which is lost. 74:3 Viz., those gods that are characterized by intellect , and the Intelligible, concerning which see Taylor's introdu ction to and notes on the Parmenides of Plato."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 70 75:1 Or, stir not up fire with a sword.--Dacier. 78:1 The justice to which we are exhorted, in this Symb ol, belongs to the theoretic virtues, concerning which see Taylor's notes on the Phædo of Plato. 83:1 The crangœ are fish belonging to the genus cancer . 84:2 Aristotle has discussed with his usual accuracy ev erything pertaining to the nature of justice in the fifth bo ok of his Nicomachean Ethics . 85:1 By this it appears that the philosophy which is wh olly busied in the investigation of sensibles, similar t o that which has been so industriously studied in a neighbouring cou ntry, and propagated in this, was very prevalent in the time of Iamblichus. 89:1 This work appears to be lost. 92:1 This alludes to the silence of five years imposed by Pythagoras on a great part of his auditors. 96:1 This is said to be a fish of a red colour. 96:2 This is that power of the soul which reasons scien tifically. 97:1 This is, by drawing diagrams. 98:1 That is, the philosophy of Pythagoras, which is ca lled Italic, because it was first propagated in Italy. 98:2 Thales was the founder of this sect, and the most illustrious professors of it were Anaximander, Anaximenes, Anax agoras, and Archelaus.
