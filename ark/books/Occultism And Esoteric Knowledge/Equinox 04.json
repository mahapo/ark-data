This Edition strictly limited to 500 Copies. PRICE 10s A ∴ A ∴ PUBLICATION IN CLASS B. ========== BOOK 777 777 HIS book contains in concise tabulated form a comparative view of all the symbols of the great religions of the world; the perfect attributions of the Taro, so long kept secret by the Rosicrucians, are now for the first time published; also the complete secret magical correspondences of the G ∴ D ∴ and R. R. et A. C. It forms, in short, a complete magical and philosophical dictionary; a key to all religions and to all practical occult working. For the first time Western and Qabalistic symbols have been harmonized with those of Hinduism, Buddhism, Mohammedanism, Taoism, &c. By a glance at the Tables, anybody conversant with any one system can understand perfectly all others. The Occult Review says: “Despite it s cumbrous sub - title and high price per page, this work has only to come under the notice of the right people to be sure of a ready sale. In its author’s words, it represents ‘an attempt to systematise alike the data of mysticism and the results of compara tive religion,’ and so far as any book can succeed in such an attempt, this book does succeed; that is to say, it condenses in some sixty pages as much information as many an intelligent reader at the Museum has been able to collect in years. The book pro per consists of a Table of ‘Correspondences,’ and is, in fact, an attempt to reduce to a common denominator the symbolism of as many religious and magical systems as the author is acquainted with. The denominator chosen is necessarily a large one, as the author's object is to reconcile systems which divide all things into 3, 7, 10, 12, as the case may be. Since our expression ‘common denominator' is used in a figurative and not in a strictly mathematical sense, the task is less complex than appears at fir st sight, and the 32 Paths of the Sepher Yetzirah, or Book of Formation of the Qabalah, provide a convenient scale. These 32 Paths are attributed by the Qabalists to the 10 Sephiroth, or Emanations of Deity, and to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, wh ich are again subdivided into 3 mother letters, 7 double letters, and 12 simple letters. On this basis, that of the Qabalistic ‘Tree of Life,' as a certain arrangement of the Sephiroth and 22 remaining Paths connecting them is termed, the author has constr ucted no less than 183 tables. “The Qabalistic information is very full, and there are tables of Egyptian and Hindu deities, as well as of colours, perfumes, plants, stones, and animals. The information concerning the tarot and geomancy exceeds that to b e found in some treatises devoted exclusively to those subjects. The author appears to be acquainted with Chinese, Arabic, and other classic texts. Here your reviewer is unable to follow him, but his Hebrew does credit alike to him and to his printer. A mong several hundred words, mostly proper names, we found and marked a few misprints, but subsequently discovered each one of them in a printed table of errata, which we had overlooked. When one remembers the misprints in ‘Agrippa’ and the fact that the o rdinary Hebrew compositor and reader is no more fitted for this task than a boy cognisant of no more than the shapes of the Hebrew letters, one wonders how many proofs there were and what the printer’s bill was. A knowledge of the Hebrew alphabet and the Qabalistic Tree of Life is all that is needed to lay open to the reader the enormous mass of information contained in this book. The ‘Alphabet of Mysticism,’ as the author says — several alphabets we should prefer to say — is here. Much that has been jealousl y and foolishly kept secret in the past is here, but though our author has secured for his work the imprimatur of some body with the mysterious title of the A ∴ A ∴ , and though he remains himself anonymous, he appears to be no mystery - monger. Obviously he i s widely read, but he makes no pretence that he has secrets to reveal. On the contrary, he says, ‘an indicible arcanum is an arcanum which cannot be revealed.’ The writer of that sentence has learned at least one fact not to be learned from books. “G.C.

Some of my brother Masons (for example) have heard imperfectly and judged hastily. But if we apply our tools to our morals with patience and skill, we shall cure any defects in t he building. Let me explain the situation carefully and clearly. ( 1 ) Mathers and Dr. Wynn Westcott were the apparent heads of the Order calling itself Rosiscrucian. ( 2 ) This Order seriously claimed direct descent, and trans - mitted Authority, from the ori ginal Fratres R.C. ( 3 ) It was founded on secret documents in the custody of Dr. Wynn Westcott, on whose honour and integrity we relied. ( 4 ) Mathers and Westcott claimed to be working under one or more secret chiefs of the grade of 8 °= 3 °. ( 5 ) It was then t o those chiefs that I and other members of the Order were pledged. ( 6 ) When the “rebellion” took place in 1900 , I thought Mathers a wolf, and Westcott a sheep; but, recog - nizing Truth in the knowledge issued by the Order, maintained my alleigance to the S ecret Chiefs 8 °= 3 °. ( 7 ) In 1904 I was ordered directly and definitely by a person who proved himself to be the messenger of a"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"EDITORIAL 5 Secret Chief 8 °= 3 ° to publish the knowledge and rituals of the Order ( a ) in order to destroy the value of that knowledge, so that the new knowledge to be revealed by himself might have room to grow ( b ) in order to stop the frauds of Mathers, which were a disgrace to arcane science. The secrecy of his rituals, and of the MSS. in the custody of Dr. Wynn Westcott, was essential to t he carrying on of these frauds. ( 8 ) I was unable to comply with these orders until I had found a person competent to edit the enormous mass of papers. I showed my hand to some extent, how - ever, in various reference to the Order in my books. And now the t ask is accomplished. ( 9 ) My defence against the accusation of having revealed secrets entrusted to me is then threefold. ( a ) Secrets cannot be revealed, or even com - municated from one person to another. ( b ) One is not bound by an oath taken to any pers on who is a swindler trading upon the sanctity of one’s oath to carry on his frauds. Especially is this the case when the person responsible for administering the oath assures you that it is “in no way contrary to your civil, moral, and religious oblig ations.” ( c ) I was not, in any case, bound to Mathers, but to the Secret Chiefs, by whose direct orders I caused the rituals to be published.

But I warn him in public, as I have (vainly) warned him in private, that by retaining the cipher MSS. of the Order, and prserving silence on the subject, he makes himself an accomplice in, or at least an accessory to, the frauds of his colleague. And I ask him in public, as I have (vainly) asked him in private, to deposit the MSS. with the Trustees of the British Museum with an account of how they came into his possession ; or if they are no longer in his possession, to state publicly how he first obtained them, and why, and to whom, he parted with them. I ask him in the name of faith between man and man; in the name of those unfortunate, who, for no worse fault than their aspiration to the Hidden Wisdom, have been and still are being befooled and betrayed and robbed by his colleague under the ægis of the respectability of his own name; and in the Name of Him, who, planning the Universe, employed the Plumb - line, the Level, and the Square. * * * * * Sweets to the sweet — and here is a press cutting for a Press Cutting Agency.

Not certainly in the same manner as small - pox can be; for physicians have a scientific language wherein to ex press their ideas and thoughts, whilst a mystic too often has not; but by a series of exercises, or a system of symbolic teaching, which will gradually lead the sufferer from the material to the spiritual, and not leave him gazing and wondering at it, as h e would at a star in the night. A fourth dimensional being, outside a few mathematical symbols, would be unable to explain to a third dimensional being a fourth dimensional world, simply because he would be addressing him in a fourth dimensional language. Like - wise, in a less degree, would a doctor be unable to explain the theory of inoculation to a savage, but it is quite con - ceivable that he might be able to teach him how to vaccinate himself or another; which would be after all the chief point gained.

To begin with, the root - thought of all philosophy and religion, both Eastern and Western, is that the universe is only an appearance, and not a reality, or, as Deussen has it: The entire external universe, with its infinite ramificati ons in space and time, as also the involved and intricate sum of our inner perceptions, is all merely the form under which the essential reality presents itself to a consciousness such as ours, but is not the form in which it may subsist outside of our con sciousness and independent of it; that, in other words, the sum total of external and internal experience always an only tells us how things are constituted for us, and for our intellectual capacities, not how they are in themselves and apart from intellig ences such as ours. * Here is the whole of the World's philosophy in a hundred words; the undying question which has perplexed the mind of man from the dim twilight of the Vedas to the sweltering noon - tide of present - day Scepticism, what is the “Ding an sic h”; what is the aÙtÕ kaq aØtÒ ; what is the Âtman?

Thus, little by little, we beget a new reality upon the old reality, a new falsehood upon the old falsehood, n amely, that the thing we see is “an illusion” and is not “a reality,” seldom considering that the true difference between the one and the other is but the difference of name.

This is explained in Brihadâranyaka, 1 . 4 . 1 . as follows: “In the beginning the Âtman alone in the form of a man * was this universe. He gazed around; he saw nothing there but himself. Thereupon he cried out at the beginning: ‘It is I.' Thence originated the name I. Therefore to - day, when anyone is summoned, he answers first ‘It is I’; and then only he names the other name which he bears.” † This Consciousness of “I” is the second veil which man meets on his upward journey, and, unl ess he avoid it and escape from its hidden meshes, which are a thousandfold more dangerous than the entanglements of the veil of words, he will never arrive at that higher consciousness, that superconsciousness (Samâdhi), which will consume him back into t he Âtman from which he came. As the fall of the Âtman arises from the cry “It is I,” so does the fall of the Self - consciousness of the universe - man arise through that Self - consciousness crying “I am it,” thereby identifying the shadow with the substance; f rom this fall arises the first veil we had occasion to mention, the veil of duality, of words, of belief. This duality we find even in the texts of the oldest Upanishads, such as in Brihadâranjaka, 3 . 4 . 1 . “It is thy soul, * “There are two persons of the Deity, one in heaven, and one which descended upon earth in the form of man ( i.e. the Adam Qadmon), and the Holy One, praised by It! unites them (in the union of Samâdhi, that is, of Sam (Greeek sÝn , together with ) and Adhi , Hebrew, Adonai , the Lord ).

Such a dilemma as this does not take long to induce one of those periods of “spiritual dryness,” one of those “da rk nights of the soul” so familiar to all mystics and even to mere students of mysticism. And such a night seems to have closed around Yâjñavalkhya when he exclaimed: After death there is no consciousness. For where there is as it were a duality, there o ne sees the other, smells, hears, addresses, comprehends, and knows the other; but when everything has become to him his own self, how should he smell, see, hear, address, understand, or know anyone at all? How should he know him, through whom he knows al l this, how should he know the knower? * Thus does the Supreme Âtman become unknowable, on account of the individual Âtman † remaining unknown; and further, will remain unknowable as long as consciousness of a separate Supremacy exists in the heart of the in dividual. Directly the seeker realizes this, a new reality is born, and the clouds of night roll back and melt away before the light of a breaking dawn, brilliant beyond all that have preceded it. Destroy this consciousness, and the Unknowable may become the Known, or at least the Unknown, in the sense of the un - discovered. Thus we find the old Vedantist presupposing an Âtman and a sÚmbolon of it, so that he might better transmute * Brihadâranyaka Upanishad, 2 . 4 . 12 . † The illusi on of thinking ourselves similar to the Unity and yet separated from It."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 59 the unknown individual soul into the known, and the unknowable Supreme Soul into the unknown, and the, from the knowable through the known to the knower, get back to the Âtman and Equilibrium — Zero.

Abandoning this limbo of Causality, just as the Buddhist did at a later date, he tackled the practical problem “What am I? To hell with God!” The self is the basis for the validity of proof, and therefore is constituted also before the validity of proof.

In the Shiva Sanhita we read: * In the proper season, various creatures are born to enjoy the consequences of their karma. † As th r o u gh mistake mother - of - pearl is taken for silver, so through the error of one's own karma man mistakes Brahma for the universe. Being too much and deeply engaged in the manifested world, the delusion arises about that which is manifested — the subject. There is no other cause (of this delusion).

Little by little it eats away the former, as strong acid would eat away a piece of steel, and ultimately when the last atom has been destroyed it ceases to exist as a science, or as a method, and becomes the Aim, i.e. , Knowledge. This is most beautifully described in the above - mentioned work as follows: 34 . That Intelligence which incites the functions into the paths of virtue and vice “am I.” All this u niverse, moveable and immovable, is from me; all things are seen through me; all are absorbed into me; * because there exists nothing but spirit, and “I am that spirit.” There exists nothing else. 35 .

Bu t the difference between these two is to be found in their form rather than in their substance; for, as Krishna himself says: Renunciation (Raja Yoga) and Yoga by action (Karma Yoga) both lead to the highest bliss; of the two, Yoga by action is verily bet ter than renunciation by action . . .

And it was just this Quietism that P. as yet had never fully experienced; and he, realizing thi s, it came about that when once the key of Yoga was proffered him, he preferred to open the door of Renunciation and close that of Action, and to abandon the Western methods by the means of which he had already advanced so far rather than to continue in th em. This in itself was the first great Sacrifice which he made upon the path of Renunciation — to abandon all that he had as yet attained to, to cut himself off from the world, and like an Hermit in a desolate land seek salvation by himself, through himself and of Himself. Ultimately, as we shall see, he renounced even this disownment, for which he now sacrificed all, and, by an unification of both, welded the East to the West, the two halves of that perfect whole which had been lying apart since that night wherein the breath of God moved upon the face of the waters and the limbs of a living world struggled from out the Chaos of Ancient Night. * Ibid .

And the answer is: by Concentration or Will. Swami Vivekânanda on this point writes: Those who really want to be Yogis must give up, once for all, this nibbling at things. Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life; dream of it; think of it; live on that idea. Let the brain, the body, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success, and this is the way great spiritual giants are produced. others are mere talking machines. . . . To succeed, you must have tremendous perseverance, tremendous will. “I will drink the ocean,” says the persevering soul. “At my will mountains will crumble up.” Have that sort of energy, that sort of will, work hard, and you will reach the goal. * “O Kesha ra,” cries Arjuna, “enjoin in me this terrible action!” This will TO WILL. To turn the mind inwards, as it were, ad stop it wandering outwardly, and then to concentrate all its powers upon itself, are the methods adopted by the Yogi in opening the closed Eye which sleeps in the hear to every one of us, and to create this will TO WILL. By doing so he ultimately comes face to face with something which is indestructible, on account of it being uncreatable, and which knows no dissatisfaction. * Vivekânanda, “ Raja Yoga,” Udbodhan edition, pp. 51 , 52 . “Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth. . . .

We hear ourselves talk; and we stand apart and see ourselves work and think. we stand aside from ourselves and anxiously or fearlessly watch and criticize our lives. There are two per sons in us, — the thinker (or the worker) and the seer. The unwinding of the hoodwink from the eyes of the seer, for in most men the seer in, like a mummy, wrapped in the countless rags of thought, is what Yoga purposes to do: in other words to accomplish n o less a task than the mastering of the forces of the Universe, the surrender of the gross vibrations of the external world to the finer vibrations of the internal, and then to become one with the subtle Vibrator — the Seer Himself. We have mentioned the six chief systems of yoga, and now before entering upon what for us at present must be the two most important of them, — namely, Hatha Yoga and Raja Yoga, we intend, as briefly as possible, to explain the remaining four, and also the necessary conditions under which all methods of Yoga should be practised. GNANA YOGA. Union through Knowledge. Gnana Yoga is that Yoga which commences with a study of the impermanent wisdom of this world and ends with the knowledge of the permanent wisdom of the Âtman. Its first stage is Viveka, the discernment of the real from the unreal. Its second Vairâgya, indifference to the knowledge of the world, its sorrows and joys. Its third Mukti, release, and unity with the Âtman. In the fourth discourse of the Bhagavad Gîta we find Gnana Yoga praised as follows: "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 70 Better than the sacrifice of any objects is the sacrifice of wisdom, O Paratapa. All actions in their entirety, O Pârtha, culminate in wisdom. As the burning fire reduces fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, so doth the fire of wisdom reduce all actions to ashes. Verily there is nothing so pure in this world as wisdom; he that is perfected in Yoga finds it in the Âtman in due season. * KARMA YOGA. Union through Work. Very closely allied to Gnana Yoga is Karma Yoga, Yoga through work, w hich may seem only a means towards the former. But this is not so, for not only must the aspirant commune with the Âtman through the knowledge or wisdom he attains, but also through the work which aids him to attain it. A good example of Karma Yoga is qu oted from Chuang - Tzu by Flagg in his work on Yoga. It is as follows: Prince Hui's cook was cutting up a bullock. Every blow of his hand, every heave of his shoulders, every tread of his foot, every thrust of his knee, every whshh of rent flesh, every chhk of the chopper, was in perfect harmony, — rhythmical like the dance of the mulberry grove, simultaneous like the chords of Ching Shou. “Well done,\" cried the Prince; “yours is skill indeed.” “Sire,” replied the cook, “I have always devoted myself t o Tao (which here means the same as Yoga). “It is better than skill.” When I first began to cut up bullocks I saw before me simply whole bullocks . After three years’ practice I saw no more whole animals. And now I work with my mind and not with my e ye. when my senses bid me stop, but my mind urges me on, I fall back upon eternal * “The Bhagavad - Gîta,” iv, 33 , 37 , 38 . Compare with the above “The Wisdom of Solomon,” e.g .: For wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me; for in her is an understanding spirit, holy, one only, manifold, subtle, lively, clear, undefiled, p lain, not subject to hurt, loving the thing that is good, quick, which cannot be letted, ready to do good. . . . for wisdom is more moving than any motion; she passeth and goeth through all things by reason of her pureness. For she is the breath of the po wer of God.” (Chap. VII, 22 , 24 , 25 .)"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 71 principles. I follow such openings or cavities as there may be, according to the natural constitution of the animal. A good cook changes his chopper once a year, because he cuts. An ordinary cook once a month — because he hacks. But I have had this chopper nineteen years, and although I have cut up many thousand bullocks, its edge is as if fresh from the whetstone. * MANTRA YOGA. Union through Speech. This type of Yoga c onsists in repeating a name or a sentence or verse over and over again until the speaker and the word spoken become one in perfect concentration. Usually speaking it is used as an adjunct to some other practice, under one or more of the other Yoga methods . Thus the devotee to the God Shiva will repeat his name over and over again until at length the great God opens his Eye and the world is destroyed. Some of the most famous mantras are: “Aum mani padme Hum.” “Aum Shivaya Vashi.” “Aum Tat Sat Aum.” “Namo S hivaya namaha Aum.” The pranava AUM † plays an important part throughout the whole of Indian Yoga, and especially is it considered sacred by the Mantra - Yogi, who is continually using it. To pronounce it properly the “A” is from the throat, the “U” in the m iddle, and the “M” at the lips. This typifies the whole course of breath. * “Yoga or Transformation,” p. 196 . Control, or Restraint, is the Key to Karma Yoga; weakness is its damnation. Of the Karma Yogi Vivekânanda writes: “He goes through the streets of a big city with all their traffic, and his mind is as calm as if he were in a cave, where not a sound could reach him; and he is intensely working all the time.” “Karma Yoga,” p. 17 . † See Vivekânanda’s “Bhakti - Yoga,” pp. 62 - 68 ."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 72 It is the best support, the bow off which the soul as the arrow flies to Brahman, the arrow which is shot from the body as bow in order to pierce the darkness, the upper fuel with w hich the body as the lower fuel is kindled by the fire of the vision of God, the net with which the fish of Prâna is drawn out, and sacrificed in the fire of the Âtman, the ship on which a man voyages over the ether of the heart, the chariot which bears hi m to the world of Brahman. * At the end of the “Shiva Sanhita” there are some twenty verses dealing with the Mantra. And as in so many other Hindu books, a considerable amount of mystery is woven around these sacred utterances. We read: 190 . In the four - petalled Muladhara lotus is the seed of speech, brilliant as lightning. 191 . In the heart is the seed of love, beautiful as the Bandhuk flower. In the space between the two eyebrows is the seed of Shakti, brilliant as tens of millions of moons. These th ree seeds should be kept secret. † These three Mantras can only be learnt from a Guru, and are not given in the above book. By repeating them a various number of times certain results happen. Such as: after eighteen lacs, the body will rise from the groun d and remain suspended in the air; after an hundred lacs, \"the great yogi is absorbed in the Para - Brahman. ‡ BHAKTA YOGA. Union by love. In Bhakta Yoga the aspirant usually devotes himself to some special deity, every action of his life being done in hono ur and glory of this deity, and, as Vivekânanda tells us, “he has not to suppress any single one of his emotions, he only strives to intensify them and direct them to god.” Thus, if he devoted himself to Shiva, he must reflect in his life to his utmost th e life of Shiva; if to Shakti the life of Shakti, unto the seer and the seen become one in the mystic union of attainment. * Deussen. “The Upanishads,” p. 390 . † “Shiva Sanhita,” cha p. v.

And from being of the nature of peace and supreme bliss. * This exquisite little Sûtra commences: 1 . We will now explain Love. 2 . Its nature is extreme devotion to some one. 3 . Love is immortal. 4 . Obtaining it man becomes perfect, beco mes immortal, becomes satisfied. 5 . And obtaining it he desires nothing, grieves not, hates not, does not delight, makes no effort. 6 . Knowing it he become intoxicated, transfixed, and rejoices in the Self (Âtman). This is further explained at the end of S wâtmârâm Swâmi's “Hatha - Yoga.” Bhakti really means the constant perception of the form of the Lord by the Antahkarana. There are nine kinds of Bahktis enumerated. Hearing his histories and relating them, remembering him, worshipping his feet, offering fl owers to him, bowing to him (in soul), behaving as his servant, becoming his companion and offering up one's Âtman to him. . . .

Also see the works of Bhagavan Ramanuja, Bhagavan Vyasa, Prahlada, and more particularly Vivekânanda's \"Bhakti Yoga.\" Bhakta Yoga is divided into two ma in divisions. (1) The preparatory, known as “Gauni”; (2) The devotional, known as “Pará.” Thus it very closely resembles, even in detail, the Operation of Abramelin, in which the aspirant, having thoroughly prepared himself, devotes himself to the invoc ation of his Holy Guardian Angel. † In Bhakta Yoga the disciple usually devotes himself to his Guru, to whom he offers his devotion. The Guru being treated as the God himself with which the Chela wishes to unite. Eventually “He alone sees no distinctions ! The mighty ocean of love has entered unto him, and he sees not men, animals and plants or the sun, moon and the stars, but beholds his Beloved everywhere and in everything.

These conditions being the conventional ones, each individual should by practice discover those more particularly suited to himself. i. The Guru. Before commencing any Yoga practice, according to every Hindu book upo n this subject, it is first necessary to find a Guru, * or teacher, to whom the disciple (Chela) must entirely devote himself: as the \"Shiva Sanhita\" says: 11 . Only the knowledge imparted by a Guru is powerful and useful; otherwise it becomes fruitless, wea k and very painful. 12 .

The dwelling of a Yogi is described as follows: The practiser of Hathayoga should live alone in a small Matha or monastery situated in a place free from rocks, water and fire; of the extent of a bow's length, and in a fertile country rul ed over by a virtuous king, where he will not be disturbed. The Mata should have a very small door, and should be without any windows; it should be level and without any holes; it should be neither too high nor too long. It should be very clean, being daily smeared over with cow - dung, and should be free from all insects. Outside it should be a small corridor with a raised seat and a well, and the whole should be surrounded by a wall. . . . * iii. Time. The hours in which Yoga should be performed vary w ith the instructions of the Guru, but usually they should be four times a day, at sunrise, mid - day, sunset and mid - night. iv. Food . According to the “Hatha - Yoga Pradipika”: “Moderate good men but talk little; secondly, s hould eat little; thirdly, should renounce the company of men, the company of women, all company. He should practise in secrecy in a retired palace. “For the sake of appearances he should remain in society, but should not have his heart in it. he should not renounce the duties of his profession, caste or rank, but let him perform these merely as an instrument without any thought of the event.

Wheat, rice, barley, butter, sugar, honey and beans may be eaten, and pure water and milk drunk. The Yogi should partake of one meal a day, usually a little after noon. “Yoga should not be practised immediately after a meal, nor when one is very hungry; before beginning the practice, some milk and butter should be taken.” † v. Physical considerations . The aspirant to Yoga should study his body as well as his mind, and should cultivate regular habits. He should strictly adhere to the rules of health and sanitation. He should rise an hour before sunrise, and bathe himself twice daily, in the morning and thee evening, with cold water (if he can do so without harm to his health). His dress should be warm so that he is not distracted by the changes of weather. vi. Moral considerations. The yogi should practise kindne ss to all creatures, he should abandon enmity towards any person, “pride, duplicity, and crookedness” . . . and the “companionship of women.”‡ Further, in Chapter 5 of the “Shiva Sanhaita” the hindrances * “Hatha - Yoga Pradipika,” p. 22 .

It matters not what attainment the aspirant seeks to gain, or what goal he has in view, the one thing above all others which is necessary is a healthy body, and a body which is under control. It is hopeless to attempt to obtain stability of mind in one whose body is ever leaping from land to water like a frog; with such, any sudden influx of illumination may bring with it not e nlightenment but mania; there fore it is that all the great masters have set the task of courage before that of endeavour. † He who dares to will , will will to know, and knowing will keep silence; ‡ for even to such as have entered the Supreme Order, there is not way found whereby they may break the stillness and communicate to those who have not ceased to hear. § The guardian of the Temple is Adonai, he alone holds the key of the Portal, seek it of Him, for there is none other that can open for thee the doo r. Now to dare much is to will a little, so it comes about that though Hatha Yoga is the physical Yoga which teaches the aspirant how to control his body, yet is it also Raja Yoga * Vivekânanda, “Karma - Yoga,” p. 62 . † As in the case of Jesus, the aspirant, for the joy that is set before him, must dare to endure the cross, despising the shame; if he would be “set down at the right hand of the throne of God.” Hebrews, xii , 2 . ‡ “If there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God” (1 Corinthians, xiv, 28 ) has more than one meaning. § \"And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half and hour\" (Rev. viii, 1 )."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 78 which teach him how to control his mind.

The East like the West, has for long lain under the spell of that potent but Middle - class Magician — St. Shame - f aced sex; and the whole of its literature swings between the two extremes of Paederasty and Brahmachârya. Even the great science of Yoga has not remained unpolluted by his breath, so that in many cases to avoid shipwreck upon Scylla the Yogi has lost his life in the eddying whirlpools of Charybdis. The Yogis claim that the energies of the human body are stored up in the brain, and the highest of these energies they call “Ojas.” They also claim that that part of the human energy which is expressed in sexua l passion, when checked, easily becomes changed into Ojas; and so it is that they invariably insist in their disciples gathering up the sexual energy and converting it into Ojas. Thus we read: It is only the chaste man and woman who can make the Ojas rise and become stored in the brain, and this is why chastity has always been considered the highest virtue. ...

The Yogi's answer is simple enough: Seeing that the extinction of the first would mean the ultimate death of the second the various Mudra exercises were introduced so that this healthy passion might not only be preserved, but cultivated in the most rapid manner possible, without loss of vitality resulting from the practices adopted. Equilibrium is above all t hings necessary, and even in these early stages, the mind of the aspirant should be entirely free from the obsession of either ungratified or over - gratified appetites.

Besides being able by the means of Prânâyâma to control the breath, the Yogi maintains th at he can also control the Omnipresent Manifesting Power out of which all energies arise, whether appertaining to magnetism, electricity, gravitation, nerve currents or thought vibrations, in fact the total forces of the Universe physical and mental. Prâna , under one of its many forms † may be in either a static, dynamic, kinetic or potential state, but, notwithstanding the form it assumes, it remains Prâna, that is in common language the “will to work” within the Akâsa, from which it evolves the Universe wh ich appeals to our senses.

And thus it is that we find the Yogi saying that he who can control the Prâna can control the Universe. To the perfect man there can be nothing in nature that is not under his control. If he orders the gods to come, they will come at his bidding. . . . All the forces of nature will obey him as his slaves, and when the ignorant see these powers of the Yogi, they call them miracles. * PRÂNÂYÂMA The two nerve currents Pingala and Ida correspond to the sensory and motor nerves, one is afferent and the other efferent. The one carries the sensations to the brain, whilst the other carries them back from the brain to the tissues of the body. The Yogi well knows th at this is the ordinary process of consciousness, and from it he argues that, if only he can succeed in making the two currents, which are moving in opposite directions, move in one and the same direction, by means of guiding them through the Sushumnâ, he will thus be able to attain a state of consciousness as different from the normal state as a fourth dimensional world would be from a third. Swami Vivekânanda explains this as follows: Suppose this table moves, that the molecules which compose this table are moving in different directions; if they are all made to move in the same direction it will be electricity. electric motion is when the molecules all move in the same direction. . . . When all the motions of the body have become perfectly rhythmical, t he body has, as it were, become a gigantic battery of will. This tremendous will is exactly what the Yogi wants. † And the conquest of the will is the beginning and end of Prânâyâma. * Vivekânanda, “Raja - Yoga,” p. 23 . See Eliphas Levi's “The Dogma and Ritual of Magic,” pp. 121 , 158 , 192 , and Huxley's “Essay on Hume,” p. 155 . † Vivekânanda, “Raja - Yoga,” pp. 36 , 37 ."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 99 Arjuna says: “For the mind is verily restless, O Krishna; it is impetuous , strong and difficult to bend, I deem it as hard to curb as the wind.” To which Krishna answers; “Without doubt, O mighty - armed, the mind is hard to curb and restless, but it may be curbed by constant practice and by indifference.” * The Kundalini whilst i t is yet coiled up in the Mûlâdhara is said to be in the Mahâkâsa, or in three dimensional space; when it enters the Sushumnâ it enters the Chittâkâsa or mental Space, in which supersensuous objects are perceived. But, when perception has become objectles s, and the soul shines by means of its own nature, it is said to have entered the Chidâkâsa or Knowledge space, and when the Kundalini enters this space it arrives at thee end of its journey and passes into the last Chakkra the Sahasrâra.

The highest of physical emotions, namely, love between man and woman, is taken as its foundation. This love, if allowed its natural course, results in the creat ion of images of ourselves, our children, who are better equipped to fight their way that we on account of the experiences we have gained. But, if this love is turned into a supernatural channel, that is to say, if the joys and pleasures of this world are renounced for some higher ideal still, an ideal super - worldly, then will it become a divine emotion, a love which will awake the human soul and urge it on through all obstructions to its ultimate union with the Supreme soul. To teach this celestial marri age to the Children of earth even the greatest masters must make use of worldly symbols; thus it has come about that corruption has cankered the sublimest of truths, until man’s eyes, no longer seeing the light, see but the flameless lantern, because of th e filth that has been cast about it."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 100 How to awake the Kundalini is therefore our next task. We have seen how this can partially be done by the various Mudra exercises, but it will be remembered that the Shakti Chalana mentioned the practice of Kumbhaka or the retention of breath. Such an exercise therefore partially falls under the heading of Prânâyâma. It is a well - known physiological fact that the respiratory system, more so than any other, controls the motions of the body. Without food or drink we can subsist many days, but stop a man's breathing but for a few minutes and life becomes extinct. * The air oxydise s the blood, and it is the clean red blood which supports in health the tissues, nerves, and brain. When we are agitated our breath comes and goes in gasps, when we are at rest it becomes regular and rhythmical. In the “Hatha Yoga Pradipika” we read: He w ho suspends (restrains) the breath, restrains also the working of the mind. He who has controlled the mind, has also controlled the breath. . . . . . . . . . If one is suspended, the other also is suspended. If one acts, the other also does the same. If they are not stopped, all the Indriyas (the senses) keep actively engaged in their respective work.

The first kind consists in performing Rechaka first; the second in doing Puraka first; and the third in suddenly stopping the breath without Puraka and Rechaka. ‡ * Malay pearl divers can remain from three to five minutes under water. † “Hatha Yoga Pradipika,” p. 79 . ‡ Also see “The Yogasara - Sangraha,” p. 54 ."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 101 Kumbhaka is also of two kinds — Sahita and Kevala. The Sahita is of two sorts, the first resembling the first kind of Prânâyâma, namely Rechaka Kumbhaka Puraka; the second res embling the second kind of Prânâyâma, namely Puraka Kumbhaka Rechaka. The Sahita should be practised till the Prâna enters the Sushumnâ, which is known by a peculiar sound * being produced in the Sushumnâ; after which the Kevala Kumbhaka should be practise d. This Kumbhaka is described in the “Hatha - Yoga Pradipika” as follows: When this Kumbhaka has been mastered without any Rechaka or Puraka, there is nothing unattainable by him in the three worlds. He can restrain his breath as long as he likes through this Kumbhaka. He obtains the stage of Raja - Yoga. Through this Kumbhaka, the Kundalini is roused, and when it is so roused the Sushumn â is free of all obstacles, and he has attained perfection in Hatha - Yoga. † Of the many Prânâyâma exercises practised in the East the following are given for sake of example. 1 . Draw in the breath for four seconds, hold it for sixteen, and then throw it out in eight. This makes one Prânâyâma. At the same time think of the triangle (The Mûlâdhara Chakkra is symbolically re presented as a triangle of fire) and concentrate the mind on that centre.

This in the “Hatha Yoga Pradipika,” p. 91 , is called the Shanmukhi Mudra. Enormous concentration is nee ded in all these Prânâyâma exercises, and, if the aspirant wishes to succeed, he must inflame himself with a will to carry them out to their utmost, just as in the Ceremonial Exercises of Abramelin he inflamed himself to attain to the Holy Vision through P rayer. The mere act of restraining the breath, breathing it in and out in a given time, so occupies the mind that it has “no time” to think of any external object. For this reason the periods of Kumbhaka should always be increased in length, so that, by making the exercise little by little more difficult, greater concentration may be gained. Fra. P. writes: \"If Kumbhaka be properly performed, the body and mind become suddenly ‘frozen.’ The will is for a moment free, and can hurl itself toward Adonai perh aps with success, before memory again draws back the attention to the second - hand of the watch.”"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 103 PRATYÂHÂRA The next step in Raja Yoga is called Pratyâhâra, or the making of the mind introspective, by wh ich the mind gains will to control the senses and to shut out all but the one object it is concentrating upon. He who has succeeded in attaching or detaching his mind to or from the centres of will, has succeeded in Pratyâhâra, which means \"gathering towa rds,\" checking the outgoing powers of the mind, freeing it from the thraldom of the senses. When we can do this we shall really possess a character; then alone we shall have made a long step towards freedom; before that we are mere machines. * The absorpti on of the mind in the ever - enlightened Brahman by resolving all objects into Âtman, should be known as Pratyâhâra. † The mind in ordinary men is entirely the slave of their senses. should there be a noise, man hears it; should there be an odour, man smell it; a taste, man tastes it; by means of his eyes he sees what is passing on around him, whether he likes it or not; and by means of his skin he feels sensations pleasant or painful. But in none of these cases is he actually master over his senses. The m an who is, is able to acco - modate his senses to his mind. To him no longer are external things necessary, for he can stimulate mentally the sensation desired. he can hear beautiful sounds without listening to beautiful music, and see beautiful sights wit hout gazing upon them; he in fact becomes the creator of what he wills, he can exalt his imagination to such a degree over his senses, that by a mere act of imagination he can make those senses instan - taneously respond to his appeal, for he is lord over th e senses, * Vivekânanda, “Raja Yoga,” p. 48 .

The first lesson in Pratyâhâra is to sit still and let the mind run on, until it is realized what the mind is doing, when it will be understood how to control it. Then i t will find that the thoughts which at first bubbled up one over the other, become less and less numerous; but in their place will spring up the thoughts which are normally sub - conscious. As these arise the Will of the aspirant should strangle them; thus, if a picture is seen, the aspirant by means of his will should seize hold of it before it can escape him, endow it with an objectivity, after which he should destroy it, as if it were a living creature, and have done with it. After this mastership over t he senses has been attained to, the next practice namely that of Dhâranâ must be begun. DHÂRANÂ Dhâranâ consists in concentrating he will on one definite object or point. Sometimes it is practised by concentrating on external objects such as a rose, cros s, triangle, winged - globe, etc. sometimes on a deity, Shiva, Isis, Christ or Buddha; but usually in India by forcing the mind to feel certain parts of the body to the exclusion of others, such as a point in the centre of the heart, or a lotus of light in t he brain. “When the Chitta, or mind stuff, is confined and limited to a certain place, this is called Dhâranâ.” “The Steadiness of the mind arising from the recognition of Brahma, wherever it travels or goes, is the real and great Dhâranâ.” * * “Unity of Jîva and Brahman, Srimat Sânkarâchârya,” paragraph 122 ."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 105 The six Chakkr as are points often used by the Yogi when in contemplation.

They should not speak much or work much, and they should avoid all places, persons and food which repel them. † The first signs of success will be better health and temperament, and a clearer voice. Those who practise zealously will towards the final stages of Dhâranâ hear sounds as of the pealing of distant bel ls,‡ and will see specks of light floating before them which will grow larger and larger as the concentration proceeds. “Practice hard!” urges Swami Vive - kânanda, “whether you live or die, it does not matter. You have to plunge in and work, without think ing of the result. If you are brave enough, in six months you will be a perfect Yogi.” § DHYÂNA.

The three last stages Dhâranâ, Dhyâna and Samâdhi, which are so intimately associated, are classed under the one name of Samyâma. * Thus meditation should rise from the object to the objectless. Firstly the external cause of sensations should be perceived, then their internal motions, and lastly the reaction of the mind.

Around the head was bluish light, and tiphereth was surrounded by rays as of a sun. I then noticed that the figure had the power to reduplicate itself at various further distances; but the main figure was very steady. Above and over the figure there towered a devil in the shape of some ante - diluvian beast. How long I mentally watched the figure I canno t say, but after a period it became obscure and difficult to see, and in order to prevent it vanishing it had to be willed to stay. After a further time the Plesiosaurus (?) above the figure became a vast shadowy form including the figure itself. The expe riment being at an end D. A. put the following question to P. “How do you judge of distance of secondary replicas of me?” P. answered: “By size only.” D. A. comments on the above were as follows: 1 .

Around the figure was an aura of heaving surfaces, and then a focussing movement which brought the surfaces very close together. “The figure then started growing rapidly in all dimensions till it reached a vast form, and as it grew i t left behind it tiny emaciated withered old men sitting in similar positions, but with changed features, so much so that I should think it were due to other reasons besides emacia - tion.” D. A. considered this medita - tion very satisfactory, but that nevert heless P. should attempt it again the next day. This, however, was impossible; as on the next day, Friday, he was suffering severely from headache and neuralgia; so instead, in order to compose himself, he meditated upon a cross for an hour and a quarter. The next living object meditation he attempted is described in the diary as follows: To meditate upon the image of D. A. sitting with his hands on his knees like a God.† Spirals were seen moving up him to a great height, and then descending till they expa nded to a great size. Besides this no other change took place. D. A.'s comments on these remarkable experiments are as follows: The hidden secret is that the the change of size and distance is not in accordance with optical laws. No one has kept living o bjects “dead still.” ‡ One of two things may occur: ( a ) The figure remains in one spot, but alters in size. ( b ) The figure remains same apparent size, but alters in distance. * Normally this is so. † In the position many of the Egyptian gods assume. ‡ Qy.: Is this from habit of expecting living things to move? I can, I think, succeed in keeping them still. — Note by P. D IAGRAM 85 . Aura of Heaving Surfaces.

( 2 ) That from this type of meditation can be discovered the character of the person meditated upon. e.g. Q. Is A. pious? A. If he grows large, yes he is very pious. Q. Is B. a villain? A. If he shrivels, he is a small villain, not a man to be afraid of. Also of ordinary occult things — e.g. change of face, expressions, etc. There are also further theories regarding the disintegration of man. Theories concerning the danger of thi s process to the meditator and meditatee alike. * The next practice was to meditate upon the image of D. A. standing. The figure remained in the same place, but altered much like a form reflected in glasses of various curves. The general tendency was to in crease slightly, but the most fixed idea was of a figure about 9 feet high but of normal breadth. Next, of normal height and of about double normal breadth. D. A.'s comment on this meditation was that the result was not good. This practice was attempted a gain on the following day: and resulted in many superposed images of various sizes and at various distances. One of the figures had moustaches like the horns of a buffalo. The expression of the figures became bold and fierce; especially at four feet dist ance, where there were two very real images, one small and one large respectively. the comment of D. A. on this meditation was that it was most clear, and represented complete success.

He fully realized that to admit into his argument the comment of God was to erase all hope of deliverance from the text, and therefore, though he had become The Buddha, nevertheless, in his selflessness he stooped down to the level of the lowest of mankind, and abandoning as dross the stupendous powers he had acquire d, helped his fellows to realize the right path by the most universal of all symbols — the woe of the world, the sorrow of mankind. Like the Vendântis, he saw that the crux of the whole trouble was Ignorance (Avijjâ). Dispel this ignorance, and illuminatio n would take its place, that insight into the real nature of things, which, little by little, leads the Aspirant out of the world of brith and seath, the world of Samsâra, into that inscrutable Nibbâna where things in themselves cease to exist and with th em the thoughts which go to build them up. Ignorance is the greatest of all Fetters, and, “he who sins inadvertently,” as Nâgasena said, “has the greater demerit.” Enquiring into the particular nature of Ignorance Buddha discovered that the Tree of Knowle dge of Good and Evil had three main branches, namely: Lobha, Dosa and Moha; Craving, Passion and the Delusion of Self, and that these three forms of Ignorance alone could be conquered by right understanding the Three Great Signs or Characteristics of all Existence, namely: Change, Sorrow, and Absence of an Ego — Anikka, Dukkha, and Anatta, which were attained by medi - tating on the inmost meaning of the Four Noble Truths: “The Truth about Suffering; the Truth about the Cause of Suffering; the Truth about the Cessation of Suffering; and the Truth about the Path which leads to the Cessation of"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 127 Suffering.” These consist of the above Three Characteristics with the addition of the Noble Eightfold Path, which contains as we shall presently see the whole of Canonic al Buddhism. Up to this point, save for the denial of the Ego, the whole of the above doctrine might have been extracted from almost any of the Upanishads. But there is a difference, and the difference is this. Though the Vedântist realized that Ignor - an ce (Avidyâ) was the foundation of all Sorrow, and that all, possessing the essence of Change, was but illusion or Mâyâ, a matter of name and form; * Buddha now pointed out that the true path of deliverance was through the Reason (Ruach) and not through the senses (Nephesh), as many of the Upanishads would give one to believe.

We have seen at the commencement of this chapter how the Âtman (that Essence beyond Being and Not Being) allegorically fell be crying “It is I,” and how the great Hypocrisy arose by supposing individual Âtmans for all beings, and things which had to incarnate again and again before finally they were swallowed up in the One Âtman of the Beginning.

But Buddha being a practical physician, though he knew sorrow to be but a form of thought, was most careful in keep - ing as real a calamity as he could; for he well saw, that if he could only get people to concentrate upon Sorrow and its Causes, that the end could not be far off, of both Sorrow and Joy; but, if they began to speculate on its illusiveness, this happy deliverance would always remain distant. His business upon Earth was entirely a practical and exoteric one, in no way mystical; it was rational not emotional, catholic and not secr et.

This presupposes a code of morals, furnished by what? * We cannot call it Âtman, Conscience, * Twenty - three centuries later Kant falling over this crux postulated his “twelve categories,” or shall we say “emanations,” and thereby started revolving once again the Sephirothic Wheel of Fortune."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 132 or Soul; and a Selecting Power, which however is strenuously denied by the rigid law of Cause and Ef fect.

As we have seen he could not prop up a fictitious beginning by the supposition of the form er, and he dared not use Nibbâna as such, though in truth the Beginning is just as incompre - henisble with or without at Âtman. But, in spite of his having denied the latter, he had to account for Causality and the transmission of his Good and Evil (Karma) by some means or another. Now, according to Nâgasena, the Blessed One refused to answer any such questions as “Is the universe everlasting?” “Is it not everlasting?” “Has it an end?” ”Has it not an end?” “Is it both ending and unending?” ”It is nei ther the one nor the other?” And further all such questions as “Are the soul and the body the same thing?” ”Is the soul distinct from the body?” “Does a Tathâgata exist after death?” “Does he not exist after death?” “Does * In spite of the fact that Buddhism urges that “the whole world is under the Law of Causation,” it commands its followers to lead pure and noble lives, in pla ce of dishonourable ones, in spite of their having no freedom of choice between good and evil. “Let us not lose ourselves in vain speculations of profit - less subtleties,” says the Dhammapada, “let us surrender self and all selfish - ness, and as all things are fixed by causation, let us practice good so that good may result from our actions.” Just as if it could possibly be done if “ all things are fixed .” The Buddhist, in theory having postulated that all fowls lay hard - boiled eggs, adds, the ideal man is he who can only make omlettes."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 133 he both exist and not exist a fter death?” “Do he neither exist nor not exist after death?” . . . Because “the Blessed Buddhas lift not up their voice without a reason and without an object.” * But in spite of their being no soul “in the highest sense,”† Gotama had to postulate some vehicle which would transmit the sorrow of one generation to another, of one instant of time to the next; and, not being able to use the familiar idea of Âtman, he instead made that of Karma do a double duty. “He does not die until that evil Karma is ex hausted,” says Nâgasena. ‡ Now this brings us to an extraordinary complex question, namely the practical difference between the Karma minus Âtman of the Buddhists and the Karma plus Âtman of the later Vedântists? The Brahman’s idea, at first, was one of com plete whole, this, as the comment supplanted the text, got frayed into innumerable units or Âtmans, which, on account of Karma, were born again and again until Karma was used up and the individual Âtman went back to the universal Âtman. Buddha, erasing th e Âtman, though he refused to discuss the Begin - ning, postulated Nibbâna as the end, which fact conversely also postulates the Beginning as Nibbâna. Therefore we have all things originating from an x sign, Âtman, Nibbâna, God, Ain or First Cause, and even tually returning to this primordial Equilibrium. The difficulty which now remains is the bridging over of this divided middle. To Gotama there is no unit, and existence per se is Ignorance caused as it were by a bad dream in the head of the undefinable N ibbâna; which itself, however, * “The Questions of King Milinda,” iv, 2 , 5 . † Ibid ., iii, 5 , 6 . ‡ Ibid ., iii, 4 , 4 ."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 134 is non - existent.

Nibbân a is Final says the Buddhist, when once an individual enters it there is no getting out again, in fact a kind of Spiritual Bastille, for it is Niccain, changeless; but Brahman is certainly not this, for all things in the Universe originated from him. This is as it should be, though we see little d ifference between proceeding from to proceeding to, when it comes to a matter of First and Last Causes. The only reason why the Buddhist does not fall into the snare, is, not because he has explained away Brahman, but because he refuses to discuss him at a ll.

Unquestionably the Soul - idea must go, but in order to account for the Universal law of Causation Karma must remain, and further, surreptitiously perform all the old duties the individual Âtman had carried out. He had abandoned the animism of a low civilization, it is true, but he could not, for a want of the exemption from morality itself, abandon the fetish of a slightly higher civiliza - tion, namely ethics. He saw that though mankind was tired of being ruled by Spirits, they were only too eager to be ruled by Virtues, which gave those who maintained these fictitious qualifications a sure standpoint from which to rail at those who had not. Therefore he banned Reincarnation and Soul and substituted in their pl ace Transmigration and Karma (Doing) the Sankhârâ or Tendencies that form the character (individuality!) of the individual.

Ânanda Metteya carries his illustration further still. John Smith, then, in a sense, is immortal; nay, every thought he thinks is deathless, and will persist, somewhere, in the depths of infinity. . . . But it is not this part of his energy that results in the formation of a new being when he dies. . . . We may then consider the moment of John Smith’s death. . . . During his life he has not alone been setting in vibration the great ocean of the Æthe r, he has been affecting the structure of his own brain. So that at the moment of his death all his own life, and all his past lives are existing pictured in a definition and characteristi c molecula r structure, a tremendous complicated representatio n of all that we have meant by the term John Smith — the record of the thoughts and doings of unnumbered lives. Each cell of the millions of his brain may be likened to a charged leyden -jar, the nerve -paths radiating from it thrill betimes with its discharges , carrying its meaning through man’s body, and, through the Æther, even to the infinitude of space. When it is functioning normally, its total discharge is prevented, so that never at any time can more than a fraction of its stored up energy be dissipate d. . . . And then Death comes; and the moment of its coming, all that locked up energy flames on the universe like a new -born star. * Ânanda Metteya then in a lengthy and lucid explanation demonstrates how the light of a flame giving off the yellow light o f sodium may be absorbed by a layer of sodium vapour, * Buddhism, vol. i, No. 2 , p. 299 , abridged."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 138 so the Karma, released from the body of the dead man, will circle round until it finds the body of a new - born child tuned or syntonized to its particular waves.

Can it be that we have got back to our old friend the Prâna which in its individual form so closely resembled the individual Karma, and in its entirety the totality of Nibbâna? Let us turn to Brihadâranyaka Upanishad. There in 1 , 6 , 3 . we find a mystical formula which reads Amritam satyena channam . This means “The immortal (Brahman) veiled by the (empirical) reality;” and immediately afterwards this is explained as follows: “T he Prâna ( i.e. the Âtman) to wit is the immortal, name and form are the reality; by these the Prâna is veiled.” Once again we are back at our starting - point. To become one with the Prâna or Âtman is to enter Nibbâna, and as the means which lead to the fo rmer consisted of concentra - tion exercises such as Prânâyâma, etc.; so now shall we find almost identical exercises used to hasten the Aspirant into Nibbâna. Frater P. was by now well acquainted with the Yoga Philosophy, further he was beginning to feel t hat the crude Animism employed by many of its expounders scarely tallied with his attainments.

Indeed its translation into worldly comments wa s a matter of experience, so it came about that he discovered that the Great Attainment per se was identical in all systems irrespective of the symbol man sought it under.

And the reason is, that the man who does attain to any of these states, on his return to consciousness, at once attributes his attainment to his particular business par tner — Christ, Buddha, Mrs. Besant, etc., etc., and attemts to rationalize about the suprarational, and describe what is beyond descrip - tion in the language of his country. P., under the gentle guidance of Ânanda Metteta, at first found the outward simplicit y most refreshing; but soon he discovered that like all other religious systems Buddhism was entangled in a veritable network of words. Realizing this, he went a step further than Gotama, and said: “Why bother about Sorrow at all, or about Transmigration ? for these are not ‘wrong viewyness,’ as Mr. Rhys Davids would so poetic - ally put it, but matters of the Kindergarten and not of the Temple; matters for police regulation, and for underpaid curates to chatter about, and matters that have nothing to do wi th true progress.” He then divided life into two compart - ments; into the first he threw science, learning, philosophy, and all things built of words — the toys of life; and into"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 140 the second The Invocations of Adonai — the work of attain - ment.

Thus it came about that the study of Buddhism caused Frater P. to abandon the tinsel of the Vedânta as well as its own cherished baubles, and induced him, more than ever, to rely on Work and Work alone and not on philosophizing, moralizing and rationaliz ing. The more rational he became, the less he reasoned outwardly; and the more he became endowed with the Spirit of the Buddha in place of the vapour - ings of Buddhism, the more he saw that personal endeavour was the key; not the Scriptures, which at best could but indi - cate the way.

Having perceived the changing nature of all things, even of men’s mnds, and having acquired that gloriifed vision by which he can distinguish between the permanent and the impermanent, he a spires to the attainment of a perfect knowledge of that which is beyond change and sorrow, and resolves that he will, be strenuous effort, † reach to the peace beyond; to where his heart may find rest, his mind become steadfast, untroubled, and serene. ‡ At this stage the Bodhi Satva of Work commences to revolve within the heart of the aspirant and to break up the harmony of the elements only to attune his aspirations for a time to a discord nobler than all harmony, and eventually to that Peace which passeth Understanding.

IV. Right Acts or Right Conduct. Having become obedient to his Holy Guardian Angel (the aspirant’s Spritual Guru) or to the Universal Law as the Buddhist prefe rs to call it, man naturally enters the stage of Right Conduct, which brings with it supernormal or magical powers. Self is now put aside from action as well as from speech, and the striver only progresses by a stupendous courage and endurance. The canon ical Buddhists howesver strenuously deny the value of these magical powers, Iddhis or Siddhis, and attribute the purification of the striver, the attainment of the state of “stainless deeds,” to the great love wherein he must now enshrine all things. In d etail the differ - ences between Buddhism and the Yoga are verbal; in essence, man, at this stage, becomes the lover of the World, and love is the wand of the Magician, that wand which conquers and subdues, vivifies, fructifies, and replenishes the worlds, and like the Caduceus of Hermes it is formed of two twining snakes. V. Right Livelihood . Up to this stage man has been but a disciple to his Holy Guardian Angel, but now he grows to be his equal, and in the flesh becomes a flame - shod Adept whose white fee t are not soiled by the dust and mud of earth.

Deepening and brightening, scarred by dull bars of slate - blue cloud arose the Dawn of Dawns. In splendour not of eart and its mean sun, blood - red, rayless, adama nt, it rose,it rose! Carried out of myself, I asked not ‘Who is the Witness?’ absrobed utterly in contemplation of so stupendous and marvellous a fact. For here was no doubt, no change, no wavering; infintely more real than aught ‘physical’ is the Golden Dawn of this Eternal Sun! But ere the Orb of Glory rose clear of its banks of blackness — alas my soul! — that Light Ineffable was withdrawn beneath the falling veil of darkness, and in purples and greys glorious beyond imagining, sad beyond conceiving, fade d the supurb Herald of the Day.

The Disk grew golden: rose clear of all its clouds, flining great fleecy cumuli of rose and gold, fiery with light, into the aethyr of space. Hollow it seemed and rayless as the Sun in Sagittarius, yet incomparably brighter: but rising clear of cloud, it began to revolve, to coruscate, to throw of streamers of jetted fire!

Towards the end of November his work in Ceylon being accomplished he arrived at Madura, and from there he journeyed to Calcutta. At this city he remained for about a month, during almost the whole of which time he suffered from sickness and fever. He however records on interesting inc ident, which took place during an early morning walk whilst he was in deep meditation. “Whilst in this meditation, a kind of inverted Manichæism seemed to develop and take possession of it, Nature appearing as a great evil and fatal force, unwittingly deve loping within * This is a mere thought - form induced by misunderstanding the instruction of Mâitrânanda Swami as to observing the phenomenon."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 168 itself a suicidal Will called Buddha or Christ.” This perhaps is most easily explained by imagining “Mâyâ” to be a circle of particles moving from right to left which after a time through its own intrinsic motion sets up within itself a counter motion, a kind of back - water current which moves in the opposite direction, from left to right, and little by little destroys the Mâyâ circle, marked “B”; and then becoming its Mâyâ, in its turn sets up a counter circle which in time will likewise be destroyed. The outer circle “B” is the world Mâyâ or the Samasâra Chak - kra, the inner “A” the Bodhi Satva, the Buddha, the Christ.

In the first the Adepts rise as arti sts, philosophers, and men of science, who are sooner or later recognized as great men; in the second the adepts as adepts appear, but seem as fools and knaves; and in the third, that of Slime, vanish altogether, and are invisible. Then the chain starts again. Thus Crowley writes: “ ‘Decadence marks the period when the adepts, nearing their earthly perfec - tion, become true adepts, not mere men of genius.

P., it may be mentioned, was much subject to dreaming, but perhaps rarely were they so persistent and vivid as he now experienced.

Working upon Eastern line he had laid stone upon stone, and yet when the work was completed, magnificnet though it was, there was no God yet found t o indwell it. It was indeed but an empty house. Though we have now arrived at this turning point, it will be necessary before we review the contents of this chapter to narrate the events from the present date — March 1902 , down to the 11 th of August 1903 ; w hen, by the chance (destined) meeting with Ourada the Seer, he was eventually enabled to set in motion the great power he had gained, and by wrestling with the deity, as Jacob wrestled with the Angel by the ford of Jabbok, see God face to face and LIVE . Fo r a space of nearly six months P. and D.A. journeyed amongst the vast mountains beyond Cashmir, and though during this period no record of his meditations has been pre - served, time was not idled away and exercises in meditation of a more exalted kind, on t he vastness of Nature and the ungraspable might of God, were his daily joy and consolation. In September he returned to Srinnagar, and thence jour - neyed to Bombay where he remained for but a few days before his return journey to Europe. Arriving in Egypt h e remained in that ancient land for some three weeks, somehow feeling that it was here that he should find what he had so long now been seeking for in vain. But realizing the hopelessness of waiting in any definite country or city, without some clue to g uide him to his goal, he left Egypt at the beginning of November and continued his journey back to England only to break it again at Paris. In this city he remained until April the following year"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 174 ( 1903 ). In the month of January he met his old College fri end H. L. From the very first moment of this meeting H. L. showed considerable perturbation of mind, and on being asked by Frater P. what was exercising him, H. L. replied “Come and free Miss Q. from the wiles of Mrs. M.” Being asked who Mrs. M. was, H. L . answered that she was a vampire and a sorceress who was modelling a sphinx with the intention of one day endowing it with life so that it might carry out her evil wishes; and that her victim was Miss Q. P. wishing to ease his friend’s mind asked H. L. t o take him to Miss Q.’s address at which Mrs. M. was then living. This H. L. did. The following story is certainly one of the least remarkable of the many strange events which happened to Frater P. during his five month’s residence in Paris, but we give i t in place of others because it re - introduces several characters who have already figured in this history. Miss Q. after an interview asked P. to tea to meet Mrs. M. After introductions she left the room to make tea — the White Magic and the Black were left face to face. On the mantelpiece stood a bronze of the head of Balzac, and P., taking it down, seated himself in a chair by the fire and looked at it. Presently a strange dreamy feeling seemed to come over him, and something velvet soft and soothing and withal lecherous moved across his hand. Suddenly looking up he saw that Mrs. M. had noiselessly quitted her seat and was bending over him; her hair was scattered in a mass of curls over her shoulders, and the tips of her fingers were touching the back of his hand."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 175 No longer was she the middle aged woman, worn with strange lusts; but a young woman of bewitching beauty. At once recognizing the power of her sorcery, and knowing that if he even so much as contemplated her Gorgon head all the power of his magic would be petrified, and that he would become but a puppet in her hands, but a toy to be played with and when broken cast aside, he quietly rose as if nothing unusual had occurred; and replacing the bust on the mantel - piece turned towards her and commenced with her a magical conversation; that is to say a conversation which outwardly had but the appearance of the politest small talk but which inwardly lacerated her evil heart, and burnt into her black bowels as if each word had been a drop of some corrosive acid. She writhed back from him; and then again approached him even more beautiful than she had been before. She was battling for her life now, and nno longer for the blood of another victim. If she lost, hell yawned before her, the hell that every onc e beautiful woman who is approaching middle age, sees before her the hell of lost beauty, of decrepitude, of wrinkles and fat. The odour of man seemed to fill her whole subtle form with a feline agility, with a beauty irresistable. One step nearer and th en she sprang at Frater P. and with an obscene word sought to press her scarlet lips to his. As she did so Frater P. caught her and holding her at arm’s length smote the sorceress with her own current of evil, just as a would - be murdered is sometimes kill ed with the very weapon with which he has attacked his vicitm.

The girl of twenty had gone, before him stood a hag of sixty, bent, decript, debauched. With dribbling curses she hobbled from the room. As Frater P. left the house, for some time he turned over in his mind these strange happenings, and was not long in coming to the opinion that Mrs. M. was not working alone, and that behind her probably were forces far greater than she. She was but the puppet of others, the salve that would catch the kids and the lambs that were to be served upon her master’s table. Could P. prove this? could he discover who the masters were? The task was a difficult one; it either meant months of work, which P. could not afford to give, or the mere chance of a lucky stroke, which P. set aside as unworthy of the attempt. That evening whilst relating the story to his friend H. L. he asked him if he knew of any reliable clairvoyant. H. L. replied that he did, and that there was such a person at that ve ry time in Paris known as The Sibyl, his own “belle amie.” That night they called on her; and from her P. discovered, for he led her in thespirit, the following remarkable facts. The vision at first was of little importance, then by degrees the seer was l ed to a house which P. at once recognised as that in which D.D.C.F. lived. He entered one of the rooms, which he also at once recognised but curious to say, instead of finding D.D.C.F. and V.N.R. there he found Theo and Mrs. Horos.

Their"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 177 bodies were in prison; but their spirits were in the house of the fallen chief of the Golden Dawn. At first Frater P. was seized with horror at the sight, he knew not whethe r to direct a hostile current of will against D.D.C.F. and V.N.R., supposing them to be guilty of cherish - ing within their bodies the spirits of two disincarnated vampires, or perhaps Abramelin demons under the assumed forms of S.V.A. and M.S.R., or to war n D.D.C.F.; supposing him to be innocent, as he perhaps was, of so black and evil an offence. But as he hesitated a voice entered the body of the Sibyl and bade him leave matters alone, which he did. Not yet was the cup full. In April he journeyed to Lon don, and the month of May 1903 once again found him amongst the fastness of the north in the house he had bought in which to cary out the Sacred Operation of Abramelin. At this point of our history, in a prefatory note to one of Frater P.’s note - books, we find him recapitulating, in the following words, the events of the last four years: In the year 1899 I came to C . . . House, and put everything in order with the object of carrying out the Operation of Abramelin the Mage. I had studied Ceremonial Magic, and had obtained every remarkable success. My Gods were those of Egypt, interpreted on lines closely akin to those of Greece. In Philosophy I was a Realist of the Qabalistic School. In 1900 I left England for Mexico, and later the Far East, Ceylon, India, Burma, Baltistan, Egypt and France. It is idle here to detail the corresponding progress of my thought; and passing through a stage of Hinduism, I had dis - carded all Deities as unimportant, and in Philosophy was an uncompromising Nominalist, arrived at w hat I may describe as an orthodox Buddhist; but how - ever with the following reservations: ( 1 ) I cannot deny that certain phenomena do accompany the use of certain rituals; I only deny the usefulness of such methods to the White Adept."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 178 ( 2 ) That I consider H indu methods of meditation as possible useful to the beginner, and should not therefore recommend them to be discarded at once.

On the 11 th of June P. records that he moved his bed into the temple that he had constructed at C . . . House, for con - venience of more absolute r etirement. In this temple he was afflicted by dreams and visions of the most appalling Abrame - lin devils, which had evidently clung to the spot ever since the operations of February 1900 .

Crowley in his “Science and Buddhism” very fully. Briefly: In this meditation the mind is not restrained to the contemplation of a single object, and there is no interference with the natural funcitons of the body. It is essentially an obse rvation - practice, which later assumes an analytic aspect in regard to the question: “What is it that is really observed?” The Ego - idea is excluded; all bodily motions are observed and recorded; for instance, one may sit down quietly and say: “There is a ra ising of the right foot.” “There is an expiration,” etc., etc., just as it happens. When once this habit of excluding the Ego becomes intuitive, the next step is to explain the above thus: “There is a sensation (Vedana) of a raising, etc.” The next stag e is that of perception (Sañña) “There is a perception of a (pleasant and unpleas - ant) sensation of a raising, etc.” The two further stages Sankhara and Viññanam pursue the analysis to its ultimation. “There is a consciousness of a tendency"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 179 impressions, but remains as an undercurrent. After several days of this desultory Mahasatipatthana, he turned his mind once again to the Great Work and decided upon a fortnight’s strict magical retirement.

It is the only analytical table of this character we know of, and must prove of very great use to investigator and aspirant alike. THE CHARACTER OF BREAKS 1 . Primary centres The senses. 2 . Secondary. These seem to assume a morbid activity as soon as the primaries are stilled. Their character is that of the shorter kind of memory. Events of the day, etc. 3 . Tertiary. Partake of the character of “reverie.” Very tempting and insidious. 4 . Quaternary. Are closely connected with the control centre i tself. Their nature is “How well I’m doing it,” or “Wouldn’t it be a good idea to . . .?” These are prob - ably emanations from the control, not messages to it. We might call them: “Aberrations of control.” Of a similar depth are the reflections which di scover a break, but these are healthy warnings and assist. 5 . Quinary. Never rise into consciousness at all, being held down by most perfect control. Hence the blank of thought, the forgetfulness of all things, including the object. Not partaking of any c haracter at all, are the “meteor” thoughts which seem to be quite independent of anything the brain could think, or had ever thought. Probably this kind of thought is the root of irrational hallucinations, e.g., “And if you’re passing, won’t you?” * * These interrupting voice suggestions have been named by P. Telephone - cross - voices on account of their close resemblance to disjointed conversations so often heard whilst using a telephone. A similar phenomenon occurs in wireless telegraphy; chance currents make words, and are so read by the operator. They are called “atmospherics.” I propose the retention of this useful word in place of the clumsy “Telephone - cross - voices.”"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 184 6 . Per haps as a result of the intense control, a nervous storm breaks. This we call Dhy âna. Its character is probably not determined by the antecedents in consciousness. Its essential characteristic being the unity of Subject and Object, a new world is reve aled. Samâdhi is but an expansion of this, so far as I can see. The slaying of any of these thoughts often leaves their echoes gradually dying away. Now that we have come to the end of this long chapter, let us turn our back on the upward slope and sur vey the road which winds beneath us, and lose not heart when but little of it can be seen, for the mountain’s side is steep, and the dis - tance from our last halting - place seems so short, not on account of our idleness, but because of the many twists and tu rnings that the road has taken since we left our last camp below, when the sun was rising and all was golden with the joy of great expectations. For, in truth, we have progressed many a weary league, and from this high spot are apt to mis - judge our journe y, and belittle our labours, as we gaze down the precipitous slope which sweeps away at our feet. In the last two years and a half P. had journeyed far, further than he at this time was aware of; and yet the goal of his journey seemed still so distance tha t only with difficulty could he bring himself to believe that he had progressed at all. Indeed, it must have been discouraging to him to think that on the 6th of May 1901 he, in a meditation of thirty - two minutes had only experienced ten breaks, whilst du ring a meditation of similar length, on the 13th of July 1903, the number of breaks had been three times as many. But like most statistics, such a comparison is misleading: for the beginner, almost invariably, so clumsy in his will, catches"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 185 quickly enough the gross breaks, but lets the minor ones dart away from his grasp, like the small fry which with ease swim in and out of the fisherman’s net. Further, though in twelve meditations the number of breaks may be identical, yet the class of the breaks, much more so than the actual number, will tell the meditator, more certainly than anything else, whether he has progressed or has retrograded. Thus at first, should the meditator practise with his eyes open, the number of breaks will in their swift succession form almost one unbroken interruption. Again, should the eyes be closed, then the ears detecting the slightest sound, the flow of the will will be broken, just as the faintest zephyr, on a still evening, will throw out of the perpendicular an ascending co lumn of smoke. But presently, as the will gains power, the sense of hearing, little by little, as it comes under control, is held back from hearing the lesser sounds, then the greater, then at length all sounds. The vibrations of the will having re - pelle d the sound vibrations of the air, and brought the sense of hearing into Equilibrium. Now the upward mountain fila - ment of smoke has become the ascending columns of a great volcano, there is a titanic blast behind it, — a will to ascend. And as the smoke a nd flame is belched forth, so terrific is its strength, that even a hurricane cannot shake it or drive it from its course. As the five senses become subdues, fresh hosts of diffi - culties spring up irrationally from the brain itself. And, whichever way we turn, a mob of subconscious thoughts pull us this way and that, and our plight in this truculent multi - tude is a hundred times worse than when we commenced to wrestle with the five senses. Like wandering comets and"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 186 meteorites they seemingly come from no where, splash like falling stars through the firmament of our meditation, sparkle and are gone; but ever coming as a distraction to hamper and harass our onward march. Once the mind has conquered these, a fresh difficulty arises, the danger of not being st rong enough to overcome the occult powers which, though the reward of our toils, and liable, like the Queen in her bedchamber, to seduce the Con - queror in spite of his having conquered the King her husband, and secretly slay him as he sleeps in her arms. These are the powers known in the West as Miraculous Powers, in the East as Siddhis. The mind is now a blank, the senses have been subdued, the subconscious thoughts slain; it stretches before us like some unspotted canvas upon which we may write or paint whatever we will. We can produce entrancing sounds at will, beautiful sights at will, subtle tastes and delicious perfumes; and after a time actual forms, living creatures, men and women and elementals. We smite the rock, and the waters flow at our blow ; we cry unto the heavens, and fire rushes down and consumes our sacrifice; we become Magicians, begetters of illusion, and then, if we allow ourselves to become obsessed by them, a time comes when these illusions will master us, when the children we have begotten will rise up and dethrone us, and we shall be drowned in the waters that now we can no longer control and be burnt up by the flames that mock obedience, and scorn our word.

Now, a lthough Frater P. had not as yet proved this, had not as yet accomplished the cleansing of the book of his mind, he had, however, built up on his own empirical observation so invulnerable a theory, that it now only remained for him to obtain that fine p roportion, that perfect adjustment, that balancing of the Forces of the Will, which now lay before him like the chemicals in the crucible of a Chemist, before applying that certain heat which would dissolve all into one. He did not wish to rule by the sce ptre he had won, but to transcend it; to rule the forces of this world, not by the authority that had been given him, but by his own essential greatness. And just as long before Mendeljeff had propounded the law of Periodicity, and by it had foreshadowed the existence of several undiscovered elements, so now did Frater P. by his law of the Correspondences of the Ruach, prove, not only historically, philosophically, theologically and mythologically the existence of the everywhere proclaimed Jechidah as bei ng one, but in a lesser degree: that when an Egyptian thought of Ptah, a Greek of Iacchus, a Hindu of Parabrahman and a Christian of the Trinity as a Unity, they were not thinking of four Gods, but of one God, not of four conditions but of one condition, not of four results but of one result; and, that should they set out to attain unity with their ideal, the stages"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 188 they would progress through would be in all cases essentially the same, the differences, if any, being due to the mental limitations of the ex perimenter, his education and prejudice, and not because the roads were dissimilar. Thus by this law could he with certainty predict that if a certain exercise were undertaken certain stages would be passed through, and what these stages meant relative to the final result, irrespective of the creed, caste, or sect of the practitioner. Further, he had proved beyond doubt or quibble, that the terrific strain caused by the Eastern breathing exercises was no whit greater or less than that resulting from The Ac ts of Worship in an operation of Ceremonial Magic, that Dhâranâ and the Mantra Yoga were in effect none other than a para - phrase of the Sacred Magic and the Acts of Invocation; and ultimately that the whole system of Eastern Yoga was but a synonym of Weste rn Mysticism. Starting from the root, he had by now crept sufficiently far through the darkness of the black earth to predict a great tree above, and to prophecy concerning a Kingdom of Light and Loveliness; and, as a worm will detect its approach to the earth surface by the warmth of the mould, so did he detect by a sense, new and unknown to him, a world as different from the world he lived in as the world of awakenment differs from the world of dreams. Further, did he grow to understand, that, though as a sustenance to the tree itself one root might not be as im - portant as another, yet that they all drew their strength from the self - same soil, and ultimately united in the one trunk above.

He seems to have examined and quoted every document that ever existed. It is true that he occasionally refers to people like Hargrave Jennings, A. E. Waite, and H. P. Blavatsky as if they we re authorities; but whoso fishes with a net of so wide a sweep as Brother Yarker's must expect to pull in some worthless fish. This accounts for Waite's contempt of him; imagine Walford Bodie reviewing a medical book which referred to him as an authority on paralysis! The size of the book, too, is calculated to effray; reading it has cost me many pounds in gondolas! And it is the essential impossibility of all works of this kind that artistic treatment is not to be attained. But Brother Yarker has nobly s uppressed a Spencerian tendency to ramble; he has written with insight, avoided pedantry, and made the dreary fields of archeology blossom with flowers of interest. Accordingly, we must give him the highest praise, for he has made the best possible out of that was nearly the worst possible. He has abundantly proved his main point, the true antiquity of some Masonic system. It is a parallel to Frazer's tracing of the history of the Slain God. But why is there no life in any of our Slain God rituals! It is for us to restore them by the Word and the Grip. For us, who have the inner knowledge, inherited or won, it remains to restore the true rites of Attis, Adonis, Osiris, of Set, Serapis, Mithras, and Abel.

The difference can not be accounted for by climate, religion, o r manners. It is not the supernatural in Arabian story which is inexplicable, but the peculiar phase of the supernatural both in beauty and terror. I say inexplicable, because to me, in common with all around me, it bore this character for years. In late r days, I believe, and now with all due modesty assert, I unlocked the secret, not by a hypothesis, not by processes of reasoning, but by journeying through those self - same fields of weird expe - rience which are dinted by the sandals of the glorious old dre amers of the East. Standing on the same mounts of vision where they stood, listening to the same gurgling melody that broke from their enchanted fountains, yes, plunging into their rayless caverns of sorcery, and imprisoned with their genie in the unutter able silence of the fathomless sea, have I dearly bought the right to come to men with the chart of my wanderings in my hands, and unfold to them the foundations of the fabric of Oriental story. The secret lies in the use of hasheesh. A very few words wil l suffice to tell what hasheesh is. In northern latitudes the hemp plant ( Cannabis sativa ) grows almost entirely to fibre, becoming, in virtue of this quality, the great resource for mats and cordage. Under a southern sun this same plant loses its fibrou s texture, but secretes, in quantities equal to one - third of its bulk, an opaque and greenish resin.

The"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"THE HASHEESH EATER 245 resin of the Cannabis indica is hasheesh. From time im - memorial it has been known among all the nations of the East as possessing powerful stimulant and narcotic properties; throughout Turkey, Persia, Nepaul, and India it is used at this day among all classes of society as an habitual indulgence. The forms in which it is employed are various. sometimes it appears in the state in which it exudes from the mature stalk, as a crude resin; sometimes it is manufactured into a conserve with clarified butter, honey, and spices; sometimes a decoction is made of the flowering tops in water or arrack. Un der either of these forms the method of administration is by swallowing. Again, the dried plant is smoked in pipes of chewed, as tobacco among ourselves. . . . a pill sufficient to balance the ten - grain weight of the scales. This, upon the authority of P ereira and the Dispen - satory, I swallowed without a tremor as to the danger of the result. Making all due allowance for the fact that I had not taken my hasheesh bolus fasting, I ought to experience its effects within the next four hours. That time elapse d without bringing the shadow of a phenomenon. It was plain that my dose had been insufficient. For the sake of observing the most conservative prudence, I suffered several days to go by without a repetition of the experiment, and then, keeping the matter equally secret, I administered to myself a pill of fifteen grains. This second was equally ineffectual with the first. Gradually, by five grains at a time, I increased the dose to thirty grains, which I took one evening half an hour after tea."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 246 I had no w almost come to the conclusion that I was absolutely unsusceptible of the hasheesh influence. Without any expectation that this last experiment would be more successful than the former ones, and indeed with no realisa - tion of the manner in which the drug affected those who did make the experiment successfully, I went to pass the evening at the house of an intimate friend. In music and conversation the time passed pleasantly. The clock struck ten, reminding me that three hours had elapsed since the dose was taken, and as yet not an unusual symptom had appeared. I was provoked to think that this trial was as fruitless as its predecessors. Ha! what means this sudden thrill? A shock, as of some unimagined vital force, shoots without warning through my enti re frame, leaping to my fingers' ends, piercing my brain, startling me till I almost spring from my chair. I could not doubt it. I was in the power of the hasheesh influence. My first emotion was one of uncontrollable terror — a sense of getting something which I had not bargained for. That moment I would have given all I had or hoped to have to be as I was three hours before. No pain anywhere — not a twinge in any fibre — yet a cloud of unutterable strangeness was settling upon me, and wrapping me impenetrabl y in from all that was natural or familiar. As I heard once more the alien and unreal tones of my own voice, I became convinced that it was some one else who spoke, and in another world. I sat and listened; still the voice kept speaking.

Its enunciation might have occupied years. I was not in the same life which had held me when I heard it begun. And now, with time, space expanded also. At my friend's house one particular arm - chair was always reserved for me. I was sitting in it at a distance of hardly three feet from the centre table around which the members of the family were grouped. Rapidly that distance widened. The whole atmosphere seemed ductile, and spun endlessly out into great spac es surrounding me on every side. We were in a vast hall, of which my friends and I occupied opposite extremities. The ceiling and the walls ran upward with a gliding motion as if vivified by a sudden force of resistless growth. Oh! I could not bear it. I should soon be left alone in the midst of an infinity of space. And now more and more every moment increased the conviction that I was watched. I did not know then, as I learned afterward, that suspicion of all earthly things and persons was the chara cteristic of the hasheesh delirium. In the midst of my complicated hallucination, I could perceive that I had a dual existence. One portion of me was whirled unresistingly along the track of this tremendous experience, the other sat looking down fro a hei ght upon its double, observing, reasoning, and serenely weighting all the phenomena. This calmer being suffered with the other by sympathy, but did not lose its self - possession.

The impulse seized me to look again. The minute - hand stood half - way between fifteen and sixteen minutes past eleven. The watch must have stopped; I held it to my ear: no, it was still going. I had travelled through all that immeasurable chain of dreams in thirty seconds. “My God!” I cried, “I am in eternity.” In the p resence of that first sublime revelation of the soul's own time, and her capacity for an infinite life, I stood trembling with breathless awe. Till I die, that moment of unveiling will stand in clear relief from all the rest of my existence. I hold it st ill in unimpaired remembrance as one of the unutterable sanctities of my being. The years of all my earthly life to come can never be as long as those thirty seconds. Before entering on the record of this new vision I will make a digression for the purpo se of introducing two laws of the hasheesh operation, which, as explicatory, deserve a place here. First, after the completion of any one fantasia has arrived, there almost invariably succeeds a shifting of the action to some other stage entirely differen t in its surround - ings.

Second, after the full storm of a vision of intense sublimity has blown past the hasheesh - eater, his next vis ion is generally of a quiet, relaxing, and recreating nature. He comes down from his clouds or up from his abyss into a middle ground of gentle shadows, where he may rest his eyes from the splendour of the seraphim or the flames of fiends. There is a wis e philosophy in this arrangement, for otherwise the soul would soon burn out in the excess of its own oxygen. Many a times, it seems to me, has my own thus been saved from extinction. When I woke it was morning — actually morning, and not a hasheesh hallu cination. The first emotion that I felt upon opening my eyes was happiness to find things again wearing a natural air. Yes; although the last experience of which I had been conscious had seemed to satisfy every human want, physical or spiritual, I smil ed on the four plain white walls of my bed - chamber, and hailed their familiar unostentatiousness with a pleasure which had no wish to transfer itself to arabesque or rainbows. It was like re - turning home from an eternity spent in loneliness among the pa laces of strangers.

Yes, I felt not one trace of bodily weariness nor mental depression.

I did not know myself; I did not know hasheesh. There are temperaments, no doubt, upon which this drug produces, as a reactory result, physical and mental depression. With me this was never the case. Opium and liquors fix themselves as a habit be becoming necessary to supply that nervous waste which they in the first place occasioned. The lassitude which succeeds their exaltation demands a renewed indulgence, and accordingly every gratification of the appetite is parent to the next. But no such element entered into the causes which attached me to hasheesh. I speak confidently, yet without exaggeration, when I say that I have spent many an hour in torture such as was never kn own by Cranmer at the stake, or Gaudentio di Lucca in the Inquisition, yet out of the depths of such experience I have always come without a trace of its effect in diminished strength or buoyancy.

At any rate, unstrung muscles and an enervated mind could have been resisted much more effectually when they pleaded for renewed indulgence than the form which the fascination actually took.

I could not shut my eyes for midday musing without beholding in that world, half dark, half light, beneath the eyelids, a steady procession of delicious images which the severest will could not banish nor dim. Now through an immense and serene sky floated luxurious argosies of clouds continually changing form and tint through an infinite cycle of mutations. Now, suddenly emerging from some deep embowerment of woods, I stood upon the banks of a broad river that curved far off into dreamy distance, and glided noiselessly past its jutting headlands, reflecting a light which was not o f the sun nor of the moon, but midway between them, and here and there thrilling with subdues prismatic rays. Temples and gardens, fountains and vistas stretched continually through my waking or sleeping imagination, and mingled themselves with all I hear d, or read, or saw. On the pages of Gibbon the palaces and lawns of Nicomedia were illustrated with a hasheesh tint and a hasheesh reality; and journeying with old Dan Chaucer, I drank in a delicious landscape of revery along all the road to Canterbury. The music of my vision was still heard in echo; as the bells of Bow of old time called to Whittington, so did it call to me — “Turn again, turn again.” And I turned. It will be remembered that the hasheesh states of ecstasy always alternate with less inten se conditions, in which the prevailing phenomena re those of mirth or tranquillity.

Presently the leg was restored to its former state, but in the interim its mate had grown to a size which would have made it a very respectable totter for Brian Boru or one of the Titans. Elevated some few hundred feet into the firmament, I was compelled to hop upon my giant pedestal in a way very ungrace ful in a world where two legs were the fashion, and eminently disagreeable to the slighted member, which sought in vain to reach the earth with struggles amusing from their very insignificance. This ludicrous affliction being gradually removed, I went on my way quietly until we again began to be surrounded by the houses of the town. And now that unutterable thirst which characterises hasheesh came upon me. I could have lain me down and lapped dew from the grass. I must drink, wheresoever, howsoever. We soon reached home — soon, because it was not five squares off from where we sat down, yet ages, from the thirst which consumed me and the expansion of time in which I lived.

Hasheesh I called the “drug of travel,” and I had only to direct my thoughts strongly toward a particular part of the world previously to swallowing my bolus to make my whole fantasia in the strongest possible degree topographical. There are two fact s which I have verified as universal by repeated experiment, which fall into their place here as aptly ass then can in the course of my narrative. First: At two different times, when body and mind are apparently in precisely analogous states, when all cir cumstances, exterior and interior, do not differ tangibly in the smallest respect, the same dose of the same preparation of hasheesh will frequently produce diametrically opposite effects. Still further, I have taken at one time a pill of thirty grains, w hich hardly gave a perceptible phenomenon, and at another, when my dose had been but half that quantity, I have suffered the agonies of a martyr, or rejoiced in a perfect phrensy. So exceedingly variable are its results, that, long before I abandoned the indulgence, I took each succcessive bolus with the consciousness that I was daring an uncertainty as tremendous as the equipoise between hell and heaven. Yet the fascination employed Hope as its advocate, and won the suit. Secondly: If, during the ecstas y"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 254 of hasheesh delirum, another dose, however small — yes, though it be no larger than half a pea — be employed to prolong the condition, such agony will inevitably ensue as will make the soul shudder at its own possibility of endurance without annihilation. By repeated experiments, which now occupy the most horrible place upon my catalogue of horrible remem - brances, have I proved that, among all the variable phenomena of hasheesh, this alone stands unvarying. The use of it directly after any other stimulus w ill produce consequences as appalling. I extinguished my light. To say this may seem trivial, but it is as important a matter as any which it is possible to notice. The most direful suggestions of the bottomless pit may flow in upon the hasheesh eater t hrough the very medium of darkness. The blowing out of a candle can set an unfathomed barathrum wide agape beneath the flower - wreathed table of his feast, and convert his palace of sorcery into a Golgotha. Light is a necessity to him, even when sleeping; it must tinge his visions, or they assume a hue as sombre as the banks of Styx. It was an awaking, which, for torture, had no parallel in all the stupendous domain of sleeping incubus. Beside my bed in the centre of the room stood a bier, from whose c orners drooped the folds of a heavy pall; outstretched upon it lay in state a most fearful corpse, whose livid face was distorted with the pangs of assassination.

Two tapers at his head, two at his feet, with their tall and unsnuffed wicks, made the ghastliness of the bier m ore luminously unearthly, and a smothered laugh of derision from some invisible watcher ever and anon mocked the corpse, as if triumphant demons were exulting over their prey. I pressed my hands upon my eye - balls till they ached, in intensity of desire to shut out the spectacle; I buried my head in the pillow, that I might not hear that awful laugh of diabolic sarcasm. But — oh horror immeasurable! I behold the walls of the room slowly gliding together, the ceiling coming down, the floor ascending, as of old the lonely captive saw them, whose cell was doomed to be his coffin. Nearer and nearer am I born toward the corpse. I shrunk back from the edge of the bed; I cowered in most abject fear. I tried to cry out, but speech was paralysed. The walls cam e closer and closer together. Presently my hand lay on the dead man's fore - head. I made my arm as straight and rigid as a bar of iron; but of what avail was human strength against the contraction of that cruel masonry? Slowly my elbow bent with the po nderous pressure; nearer grew the ceiling — I fell into the fearful embrace of death. I was pent, I was stifled in the breathless niche, which was all of space still left to me. The stony eyes stared up into my own, and again the maddening peal of fiendish laughter rang close beside my ear. Now I was touched on all sides by the walls of the terrible press; there came a heavy crush, and I felt all sense blotted out in darkness. I awoke at last; the corpse was gone, but I had taken his"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 256 place upon the bier . In the same attitude which he had kept I lay motionless, conscious, although in darkness, that I wore upon my face the counterpart of his look of agony. The room had grown into a gigantic hall, whose roof was framed of iron arches; the pavement, the wa lls, the cornice were all of iron. The spiritual essence of the metal seemed to be a combination of cruelty and despair. Its massive hardness spoke a language which it is impossible to embody in words, but any one who has watched the relentless sweep of some great engine crank, and realised its capacity for murder, will catch a glimpse, even in the memory, of the thrill which seemed to say, “This iron is a tearless fiend,” of the unutterable meaning I saw in those colossal beams and buttresses. I suffere d from the vision of that iron as from the presence of a giant assassin. But my senses opened slowly to the perception of still worse presences. By my side there gradually emerged from the sulphurous twilight which bathed the room the most horrible form w hich the soul could look upon unshattered — a fiend also of iron, white - hot and dazzling with the glory of the nether penetralia. A face that was theferreous incarnation of all imaginations of malice and irony looked on me with a glare withering from its in tense heat, but still more from the unconceived degree of inner wickedness which it symbolised. I realised whose laughter I had heard, and instantly I heard it again. Beside him another demon, his very twin, was rocking a tremendous cradle framed of bars of iron like all things else, and candescent with as fierce a heat as the fiend's.

I still remember the meaning of the song they sand, although there is no language yet coined which will convey it, and far be it from me event to suggest its nature, lest I should seem to perpetuate in any degree such profanity as beyond the abodes of the lost no lips are capable of uttering. Every note of the music itself accorded with the thought as symbol represents essence, and with its clangour mixed the maddening creak of th e for ever oscillating cradle, until I felt driven into a ferocious despair. Suddenly the nearest fiend, snatching up a pitchfork (also of white - hot iron), thrust it into my writing side, and hurled me shrieking into the fiery cradle. I sought in my tort ure to scale the bars; they slipped from my grasp and under my feet like the smoothest icicles. Through increasing grades of agony I lay unconsumed, tossing from side to side with the rocking of the dreadful engine, and still above me pealed the chant of blasphemy, and the eyes of demoniac sarcasm smiled at me in mockery of a mother's gaze upon her child. “Let us sing him,” said one of the fiends to the other, “the lullaby of Hell.” The blasphemy now changed into an awful word - picturing of eternity, un veiling what it was, and dwelling with raptures of malice upon its infinitude, its sublimity of growing pain, and its privation of all fixed points which might mark it into divisions. By emblems common to all language rather than by any vocal words, did t hey sing this frightful apocalypse, yet the very emblems had a sound as distinct as tongue could give them. This was one, and the only one of their representatives that I can remember. Slowly they began, “To - day is father of to - morrow, to - morrow hath a s on that"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 258 shall beget the day succeeding.” With increasing rapidity they sang in this way, day by day, the genealogy of a thousand years, and I traced on the successive generations, without a break in one link, until the rush of their procession reached a r apidity so awful as fully to typify eternity itself; and still I fled on through that burning genesis of cycles. I feel that I do not convey my meaning, but may no one else ever understand it better. Withered like a leaf in the breath of an oven, after mi llions of years I felt myself tossed upon the iron floor. The fiends had departed, the cradle was gone. I stood alone, staring into immense and empty spaces. Presently I found that I was in a colossal square, as of some European city, alone at the ti me of evening twilight, and surrounded by houses hundreds of stories high. I was bitterly athirst. I ran to the middle of the square, and reached it after an infinity of travel. There was a fountain carved in iron, every jet inimitably sculptured in mo ckery of water, yet dry as the ashes of a furnace. “I shall perish with thirst,” I cried. “Yet one more trial. There must be people in all these immense houses. Doubtless they love the dying traveller, and will give him to drink. Good friends! water! water!” A horribly deafening din poured down on me from the four sides of the square. Every sash of all the hundred stories of every house in that colossal quadrangle flew up as by one spring. Awakened by my call, at every window stood a terrific ma niac.

In the jubilance of hasheesh, we have only arrived by an improper pathway at the secret of that infinity of beauty which shall be beheld in heaven and earth when the veil of the corporeal drops off, and we know as we are known. Then from the muddy waters of our life, defiled by the centuries of degeneracy through which they have flowed, we shall ascend to the old - tim e original fount, and grow rapturous with its apocalytpic draught. I do not remember whether I have yet mentioned that in the hasheesh state an occasional awakening occurs, perhaps as often as twice in an hour (though I have no way of judging accurately, from the singular properties of the hasheesh time), when the mind returns for an exceedingly brief space to perfect consciousness, and views all objects in their familiar light. Awaking on the morrow after a succession of vague and"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 260 delicious dreams, I had not yet returned to the perfectly natural state. I now began to experience a law of hasheesh which developed its effects more and more through all future months of its use. With the progress of the hasheesh life, the effect of every successive indulgen ce grows more per - during until the hitherto isolated experiences become tangent to each other; then the links of the delirium intersect, and at last so blend that the chain has become a continuous band, now resting with joyous lightness as a chaplet, and n ow mightily pressing in upon the soul like the glowing hoop of iron which holds martyrs to the stake. The final months of this spell - bound existence, be it terminated by mental annihilation or by a return into the quiet and mingled facts of humanity are p assed in one unbroken yet chequered dream. Moreover, through many ecstasies and many pains, I still supposed that I was only making experiments, and that, too, in the most wonderful field of mind which could be opened for investigation, and with an agent so deluding in its influence that the soul only became aware that the strength of a giant was needed to escape when its locks were shorn. Upon William N —— hasheesh produced none of the effects characteristic of fantasia. There was no hallucination, no vo litancy of unusual images before the eye when closed. Circulation, however, grew to a surprising fulness and rapidity, accompanied by the same introversion of faculties and clear perception of all physical processes which startled my in my first experiment upon myself.

These symptoms, tog ether with a peculiar rigidity of the muscular system, and inability to measure the precise compass and volume of the voice when speaking, brought the case nearer in resemblance to those recorded by Dr. O’Shaughnessy, of Calcutta, as occurring under his im mediate inspection among the natives of India, than any I have ever witnessed. At half - past seven in the evening, and consequently after supping instead of before, as I should have preferred, he took twenty - five grains of the drug. This may seem a large bolus to those who are aware that from fifteen grains I frequently got the strongest cannabine effect; but it must be kept in mind that, to secure the full phenomena, a much greater dose is necessary in the first experiment than ever after. Unlike all oth er stimuli with which I am acquainted, hasheesh, instead of requiring to be increased in quantity as existence in its use proceeds, demands rather a diminution, seeming to leave, at the return of the natural state (if I may express myself by rather a mater ial analogy), an unconsumed capital of exaltation for the next indulgence to set up business upon. For a while we walked silently. Presently I felt my companion shudder as he leaned upon my arm. “What is the matter, Bob?” I asked. “Oh! I am in unbear able horror,” he replied. “If you can, save me!” “How do you suffer?” “This shower of soot which falls on me from heaven is dreadful!”"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 262 I sought to turn the current of his thoughts into another channel, but he had arrived at that place in his experie nce where suggestion is powerless.

I reached the same place in after days, and it was then as impossible for any human being to alter the condition which enwrapped me as i t would have been for a brother on earth to stretch out his hands and rescue a brother writhing in the pangs of immortality. There are men in Oriental countries who make it their business to attend hasheesh - eaters during the fantasia, and profess to be ab le to lead them constantly in pleasant paths of hallucination. If indeed they possess this power, the delirium which they control must be a far more ductile state than any I have witnessed occurring under the influence of hasheesh at its height. in th e present instance I found all suggestion powerless. The inner actuality of the visions and the terror of external darkness both defeated me. And now, in the midst of the darkness, there suddenly stood a wheel like that of a lottery, surrounded by one l uminous spot, which illustrated all its movements. It began slowly to revolve; its rapidity grew frightful, and out of its opening flew symbols which indicated to him, in regular succession, every minutest act of his past life: from his first unfilial dis obedience in childhood — the refusal upon a certain day, as far back as infancy, to go to school when it was enjoined upon him, to the latest deed of impropriety he had committed — all his existence fled before him like lighting in those burning emblems.

This phenomenon is one of the most striking exhibitions of the state in which the higher hasheesh exaltation really exists. It is a partial sundering, for the time, of those ties which unite soul and body. That spirit should ever loose the traces of a si ngle impression is impossible. In the morning he awoke at the usual time; but, his temperament being perhaps more sensitive than mine, the hasheesh delight, without its hallucination, continued for several days. And now a new fact flashed before me. Thi s agony was not new; I had felt it ages ago, in the same room, among the same people, and hearing the same conversation. To most men, such a sensation has happened at some time, but it is seldom more than vague and momentary. With me it was sufficiently definite and lasting to be examined and located as an actual memory. I saw it in an instant, preceded and followed by the successions of a distinctly recalled past life. What is the philosophy of this fact? If we find no ground for believing that we have ever lived self - consciously in any other state, and cannot thus explain it, may not this be the solution of the enigma? At the moment of the soul's reception of a new impression, she first accepts it as a thing entirely of the sense; she tells us how lar ge it is, and of what quality.

Prophet ically she notes it down upon the indestructible leaves of her diary, assured that it is to come out in the future revelation. Yet we who, from the tendency of our thought, reject all claims to any knowledge of the future, can only acknowledge perceptions as of the present or the past, and accordingly refer the dual realisation to some period gone by. We perceive the correspondence of two sensations, but, by an instantaneous process, give the second one a wrong position in the succession of experiences. The soul is regarded as the historian when she is in reality the sibyl; but the misconception takes place in such a microscopic portion of time that detection is impossible. In the hasheesh expansion of seconds into minutes, or even according to a much mi ghtier ratio, there is an opportunity thoroughly to scrutinise the hitherto evanescent phenomena, and the truth comes out. How many more such prophecies as these may have been rejected through the gross habit of the body we may never know until spirit vin dicates her claim in a court where she must have audience. In this world we are but half spirit; we are thus able to hold only the perceptions and emotions of half an orb. Once fully rounded into symmetry ourselves, we shall have strength to bear the pre ssure of influences from a whole sphere of truth and loveliness.

It would be no hard task to prove, to a strong probability, at least, that the initiation to the Pythagorean mysteries, and the progressive instruction that succeeded it, to a considerable extent consisted in the employment, judiciously, if we may use the word, of hasheesh, as giving a critical and analytic power to the mind, which enabled the neophy te to roll up the murk and mist from beclouded truths till they stood distinctly seen in the splendour of their own harmonious beauty as an intuition. One thing related of Pythagoras and his friends has seemed very striking to me. There is a legend that, as he was passing over a river, its waters called up to him in the presence of his followers, “Hail! Pythagoras.” Frequently, while in the power of the hasheesh dilirium, have I heard inanimate things sonorous with such voices. On every side they have sal uted me, from rocks, and trees, and waters, and sky, in my happiness filling me with intense exultation as I heard them welcoming their master; in my agony heaping nameless curses on my head as I went away into an eternal exile from all sympathy. Of this tradition of Iamblichus I feel an appreciation which almost convinces me that the voice of the river was indeed heard, though only by the quickened mind of some hasheesh - glorified esoteric. Again, it may be that the doctrine of the metempsychosis was firs t communicated to Pythagoras by Theban priests; but the astonishing illustration which hasheesh would contribute to"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 266 this tenet should not be overlooked in our attempt to assign its first suggestion and succeeding spread to their proper causes. I looked, an d lo! all the celestial hemisphere was one terrific brazen bell, which rocked upon some invisible adamantine pivot in the infinitudes above. When I cam it was voiceless, but I soon knew how it was to sound. My feet were quickly chained fast to the top o f heaven, and, swinging with my head downward, I became its tongue. Still more mightily swayed that frightful bell, and now, tremendously crashing, my head smote against its side. It was not the pain of the blow, though that was inconceivable, but the co lossal roar that filled the universe, and rent my brain also, which blotted out in one instant all sense, thought, and being. In an instant I felt my life extinguished, but knew that it was by annihilation, not by death. When I awoke out of the hasheesh s tate I was as overwhelmed to find myself still in existence as a dead man of the last century could be were he now suddenly restored to earth. For a while, even in perfect consciousness, I believed I was still dreaming, and to this day I have so little lo st the memory of that one demoniac toll, that while writing these lines I have put my hand to my forehead, hearing and feeling something, trough the mere imagination, which was an echo of the original pang. It is this persistency of impressions which expl ains the fact of the hasheesh state, after a certain time, growing more and more every day a thing of agony. It is not because the body becomes worn out by repeated nervous shocks; with some constitutions, indeed, this wearing may occur; it never did with me, as I have said, even to the extent"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"THE HASHEESH EATER 267 of producing muscular weakness, yet the universal law of constantly acceleration diabolisation of visions held good as much in my case as in any others; but a thing of horror once experienced became a kt»ma ½j ¥e... , a n inalienable dower of hell; it was certain to reproduce itself in some — to God be the thanks if not in all — future visions. I had seen, for instance, in one of my states of ecstasy, a luminous spot on the firmament, a prismatic parhelion. In the midst of my delight of gazing on it, it had transferred itself mysteriously to my own heart, and there became a circle of fire, which gradually ate its way until the whole writing organ was in a torturous blaze. That spot, seen again in an after - vision, through th e memory of its former pain instantly wrought out for me the same accursed result. The number of such remembered faggots of fuel for direful suggestion of course increased proportionally to the prolonging of the hasheesh life, until at length there was ha rdly a visible or tangible object, hardly a phrase which could be spoken, that had not some such infernal potency as connected with an earlier effect of suffering. Slowly thus does midnight close over the hasheesh - eater's heaven. One by one, upon its pall thrice dyed in Acharon, do the baleful lustres appear, until he walks under a hemisphere flaming with demon lamps, and upon a ground paved with tiles of hell. Out of this awful domain there are but three ways.

To the first restaurant at hand we hastened. Pass ing in, I called for that only material relief which I have ever found for these spiritual sufferings — something strongly acid. In the East the form in use is sherbet; mine was very sour lemonade. A glass of it was made ready, and with a small glass tube I drew it up, not being able to bear the shock of a large swallow. Relief came but very slightly — very slowly. Before the first glass was exhausted I called most imperatively for another one to be prepared as quickly as possible, let the flames should spr ead by waiting. In this way I kept a man busy with the composition of lemonade after lemonade, plunging my tube over the edge of the drained tumbler into the full one with a precipitate haste for which there were mortal reasons, until six had been consume d. I returned to hasheesh, but only when I had become hopeless of carrying out my first intention — its utter and immediate abandonment. I now resolved to abandon it gradually — to retreat slowly from my enemy, until I had passed the borders of his enchanted ground, whereon he warred with me at vantage. Once over the boundaries, and the nightmare spell"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"THE HASHEESH EATER 269 unloosed, I might run for my life, and hope to distance him in my own recovered territory. This end I sought to accomplish by diminishing the doses of the drug. The highest I had ever reached was a drachm, and this was seldom necessary except in the most unimpressible states of the brain, since, according to the law of the hasheesh operation which I have stated to hold good in my experience, a much less bolus wa s ordinarily sufficient to produce full effect at this time than when I commenced the indulgence. I now reduced my daily ration to ten or fifteen grains. The immediate result of even this modified resumption of the habit was a reinstatement into the glori es of the former life. I came out of my clouds; the outer world was reinvested with some claim to interest, and the lethal torpor of my mind was replaced by an airy activity. I flattered myself that there was now some hope of escape by grades of renuncia tion, and felt assured, moreover, that since I now seldom experienced anything approaching hallucination, I might pass through this gradual course without suffering on the way. As lemon - juice had been sometimes an effectual cure for the sufferings of exces s, I now discovered that a use of tobacco, to an extent which at other times would be immoderate, was a preventive of the horrors of abandonment. As, some distance back, I have referred to my own experi - ence upon the subject, asserting my ability at times to feel sights, see sounds , &c., I will not attempt to illustrate the present discussion by a narrative of additional portions of my own case. It might be replied to me, “Ah! yes, all very likely; but probably you are an exception to the general rule:"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 270 no body else might be affected so.” This was said to me quite frequently when, early in the hasheesh life, I enthusiastically related the most singular phenomena of my fantasy. But there is no such thing true of the hasheesh effects. Just as inevitably as t wo men taking the same direction, and equally favoured by Providence, will arrive at the same place, will two persons of similar temperament come to the same territory in hasheesh, see the same mysteries of their being, and get the same hitherto unconceive d facts. It is this characteristic which, beyond all gainsaying, proves the definite existence of the most wondrous of the hasheesh disclosed states of mind. The realm of that stimulus is no vagary; it as much exists as England. We are never so absurd a s to expect to see insane men by the dozen all holding to the same hallucination without having had any communication with each other. As I said once previously, after my acquaintance with the realm of witchery had become, probably, about as universal as a nybody's, when I chanced to be called to take care of some one making the experiment for the first time (and I always was called), by the faintest word, often by a mere look, I could tell exactly the place that my patient had reached, and treat him accordi ngly. Many a time, by some expression which other bystanders thought ineffably puerile, have I recongised the landmark of a field of wonders wherein I have travelled in perfect ravishment.

Tell thy grovelling disciple what then is a ‘lie’?” “Ha!” he replied, “it is il lusion, this truth that has been diverged from its real point . . . an illusive spring in the primo - genial fermentation of ‘fee - no - me - non,’ in this typo - cosmy apparent to the sense which you call ‘de Vurld’ ! ! !” With this, and promises of oceans of bliss ful reality from the highest eternality of ultimate ecstasy, he bade me sit in a chair and blow alternately through my nostrils; and, if I had faith, so he assured me, I should in six months’ time arrive at the supreme stage of the Highest in the infinite Ultimatum, and should burst as a chance illusively fermented bubble in the purest atmosphere of the highest reality.

During the summer of ’ 07 I had little time to waste at number 60 , and had almost forgotten about the Mahatma, who, so I had been told, had let England for Ameri ca, when I received a card announcing his return, and asking me to be present at a general meeting. This I did, and as usual was more than bored. After business was over the Mahatma entered the room, all his sheep floking round him to seek the turnips of his wisdom. On these occasions he would ask questions and select subjects upon which his disciples were supposed to write essays. One of these, I can still remember, was: “How to help the helpless hands”; another was: “What is dis - satisfaction, and what is true satisfaction?” And the answer was: “Love fixed on mortal things, without the knowledge of its source, increases vibration and creates dissatisfaction (‘mortal things’ is good!).” In his book, “Sri Brahma Dhara,\" which contains some of the most a stonishing balderdash ever put in print, may be found his philosophy. This is a stewed - up hash of Yoga, Vedanta, and outrageous verbosity. “Love,” he writes, “is the force of the magician Maya, and is the cause of all disorder” (it seems to be so even i n his exalted position). “This force of love — in the state of circumgyration in the extended world — is the cause of all mental movements towards the feeling of easiness or uneasiness: but the mind enjoys eternal beatitude with perfect calmness, when the for ce of love is concentrated over the unlimited extension of silence” (‘silence’ is really choice!)."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 288 “Virtue,” he defines as: “the bent of mind towards self - command” (and evidently practises it). His morals are good; but his scientific conceptions really “t ake the cake!” “there are three kinds of animate creations in the world,” he writes: “They are the creations from ( 1 ) the womb; ( 2 ) Eggs; ( 3 ) Perspiration. . . .” Another gem: “how is it that some of the bodies are male and some are female?” Answer: “If the male seed preponderates, a male body is produced; and if female, a female. While, when both are equally proportioned, an eunuch is born” (!) At one of his male meetings — there were also female ones; but mixed bathing in the ocean of infinite bliss was not allowed — he related to us his pet story, of how he had “flumoxed” the chief engineer and the captain of the liner which had brought him back from America. He informed them that coal and steam were absurd; what you want, he said, is to have two large ho les made in the sides of you ship, then the air will blow into them and turn the wheels, and make the ship go. When the captain pointed out to him, that if a storm were to arise the water might possibly flow into the ship and sink it, he roared out, “No! no! . . . get English! . . . get intellect! see! see! de vind vill fill de ship and blow it out of de vater and take it across over de vaves!” — Since this now becomes public property there probably will be a slump in turbines!

I arrived at 60 , South Audley Street at seven o'clock. There were already about twenty sheepish - looking tigers present, and when the Mahatma entered the room, I sat down next to him; for, knowing, in case a scrimmage should occu r, that a Hindoo cannot stomach a blow in the spleen, I thought it wisest to be within striking distance of him. The Mahatma opened the evening's discussion by saying: “Humph . . . I am Agnostic, you are believers. I say ‘I don't know,’ you contradict me. ” And during the next hour and a half more Bunkum was talked in that room that I should say in Exeter Hall during the whole course of the last century. At last it ended, and though I had made various attempts to draw His Holiness into argument, I had as yet failed to unveil his divinity. He now started dictating his precious philosophy, and in such execrable English, that it was quite impossible to follow him, and I once or twice asked him to repeat what he had said, and as I did so I noticed that severa l of the faithful shivered and turned pale. At length came the word “expectation” or “separation,” and as I could not catch which, I exclaimed “what?” “You pig - faced man!” shouted His Holiness, “you dirty fellow, you come here to take away my disciples . . . vat you vant vith this: vat! vat! vat! vat! . . .

Let us deal with Francis Thompson. Had he no friend to burn this manuscript? To save h im from blackening his own memory in this way? We were content to give him his appointed niche in the temple, that of a delicate, forceful spirit, if rarely capable of cosmic expansion. We did not look for eagle - flights; we thought of him as a wild goose sweeping from Tibet upon the poppy - fields of Yunnan. But the prose of a poet reveals the man in him, as his poetry reveals the god; and Francis Thompson the man is a pitiful thing enough. It is the wounded earthworm cursing the harrow; the snipe blasphe ming the lark. Shelley was a fine, pure, healthy man whose soul was habitually one with the Infinite Universe; Thompson was a wretch whose body was poisoned by drugs, whose mind by superstition. Francis Thompson was so much in love with his miserable sel f that he could not bear the thought of its extinction; Shelley was glad to die if thereby one rose could bloom the redder. This essay is disgusting; we were all trying to forget Francis Thompson, to remember his songs; and here we have his putrid corpse i ndecently disinterred and thrust under our noses. The worst of it all is the very perfection of the wrappings. what a poet Thompson might have been if he had never heard of Christ or opium; if he had revelled in Venice with its courtesans of ruddy hair, s wan gracefulness, and tiger soul! Instead, he sold matches in the streets of London; from which abyss a church meant warmth, light, incense, music, and a pageant of hope. To - day, as in the days of Nero, Christianity is no more than the slum - born shriek of the degenerate and undersized starvelings that inhabit the Inferno of Industrialism. So also Thompson, impotent from abuse of opium, reviles Shelley and Byron for virility. “O che sciagura essere senza cog!” — Dirt, dogma, drugs! What wonder and what hop e lies in the soul of man if from such ingredients can be distilled such wine as “The dream tryst?” Requiescat in pace.

II “ T HE boy comes in later. I want you to realize how beautiful was the little girl.

On another occasion, extraordinary miracle, one glance from her eyes had stopped the tongue of a drunken pope who was swearing at a peasant in the foulest language. She was, of course, a favo urite with all in the village: the simpler and nearer Nature their souls, the more they gave the child her proper place. But it must not be inferred that little Ljubov was either worshipped or freed from such menial works as children of her age are called upon to perform. Nor did her playmates realize her superiority. The alleged miracles and the reported cases of healing were heard of some ten years after her death, when eye - witnesses had all departed from this world. Yet, of course, they were possible , quite possible, quite. III “ A LL of you, suckling babes, have read the Russian tale of the Man who bought souls — or heard of it. Men of a similar turn of mind exist in Russia, and I want you to concentrate your mind upon such a man, albeit his bargains c ost him even less, and were of a more physical reality. From town to village he went, in search of treasures in the shape of eyes.

For hours, having retired to the house belonging to a rich lady whos e guest he was, he drivelled, with before him the enrapturing vision of Ljubov's priceless jewels. He proceeded carefully; made friends with all the children; and, the seventh day having come, he met her outside the village, by chance — so she thought — and m ade her a present of a few trifling ornaments. Then he placed over his own eyes two empty shells of walnut, and pretended to play some childish game of hide - and - seek. After a few minutes, it was her turn to don the blinding apparel. But there were differ ent from his, the empty shells he fixed under her eyebrows! Ljubov felt no pain, rather an exquisite sensation of physical bien - être , of wondrous languor.

The force within the nutshells had drawn the eyes out of them. The Man ran away, carrying a treasured little box, and no more was ever heard of him in those parts. IV “What boots it to tell of the long, awful days of darkness through which poor little Ljubov lived before she grew accustomed to her blindness?

Where was I. my little brethren, fathers of larvae, sons of the she - goat? Ah, I know . Well, poor little Ljubov was saved by her magnificent soul from despairing thoughts. She lived, very miserable at first, more resigned later on. And there was a boy, too. He was the blind - born son of an ex - soldier, and because of his father's queer an d unsocial manner, few people in the village would condescend to take interest in him. But he was no mean child, nevertheless, and his heart was big. Ljubov had denied herself the pitiful satisfaction of explaining her accident. No one ever heard from he r lips the tale of her lost eyes. And, as the months passed by, all remembrance of her, as she had been, died away. Men, women and children passed her by, and took no notice of her. Her parents were kind, but over - worked. Only Piotr, the blind - born chi ld, realized Ljubov’s beauty. For if he had no eyes to see with, his other perceptions were sharpened for that very reason. He could not very well understand at first how, and why, it had come to pass that he, alone in the world — for he was but an ignora nt peasant child — had not received the use of the five operations of the Lord. But the village deacon, who had been in trouble for some cause or another,"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 300 and was almost a genius in disgrace — “ terribly clever ” the old men said — once told the little Piotr what it was to be blind. Fortunately for the child's mental equilibrium, he also spoke of the compensation. “What they mean, boy, when they call you blind, is that you cannot see,” he said; “that is, your eyes have been given unto you by the devil, and not by God. Your father must have been rather a bad fellow, you know. When you hear the women singing at the dance, it is that God has given you your ears; if you didn't enjoy the sounds it would mean that the devil has given you your ears, as the Book says, w hich God wrote in Russian for our people: “ They have ears and they hear not .” However, you hear well, and smell well, and your two other senses are all right. What you miss, it’s the colour of things. I cannot explain it to you, and it would do you no g ood if I did. Your compensation is that you do not see that which is ugly, ugly like old Ivan Semenovich, and also that you hear and feel and smell with more accuracy than we do. Of course, it is nice to see as well, and I will pray Christ for you, espec ially if you can give me a few coppers with which to buy tapers. You must have plenty of them; people seem to give you very freely.” Thus the tiresome brute, who had but a few chances of getting drunk in the place. Happily, Piotr and little Ljubov taught one another a simpler and more natural theory. She was now twelve, and the boy fourteen years old. And I chanced to be staying in the neighbourhood. I met them, as hand in hand they cautiously crossed a lane, close to the spot where I was meditating.

The disciples exchanged a glance of amusement; one of them said: “Has a lady entered?” They were all ma de merry by that exhibition of Neptunian spirit of apropos. But Elphénor Pistouillat, like the French Southerner he was, missed the courteous element in life, and began to curse the twelve young men. He was a bad - tempered man, and a very theatrical one. He rose and walked to him who had caused them all to laugh. “I know you, sir,\" Elphénor said, purple in the face, “I know you, unwholesome monkey. Your father was a dealer in pork sausages and cooked ham, a trader in swine. Nothing better could be expect ed from you than your pig - like groans.” His blood was boiling already, and these few words he uttered were but a preliminary letting out of steam. He walked in the dark to a large cupboard at the far end of his room and took from a shelf twelve little wax figures which he stood on a small table. Rapidly he mumbled an invocation, an incantation, and a depreciation. Then he walked to the fireplace, took the red - hot poker which he kept ever ready for the purpose of lighting his charcoal, and returned with i t to the table."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 302 The twelve disciples felt that something was going to happen, but knew not what.

The could hear the old man, by his table, cursing them and hitting the wax figures with the hot poker, haphazard, careless of the spot where he struck; but he st ruck them all equally. The contortions of the men on the yellow painted floor were terrible. he took no heed of them, and went on, cursing them each by name and each time hitting one figure, corresponding the the name he was cursing. Finally, the red - hot iron had turned black again; and Elphénor's arm was becoming tired. he gathered all the wax figures and went and threw them all into a large pail of water, pushing them down again and again as they came to the surface. His victims were gradually coming b ack to their senses. Once more he gathered their waxen images and replaced them on the shelf. Then he turned to his disciples and shouted: “Sit down, ye workers of Iniquity. Did you feel the draught — or not? Do not interrupt me again. And if anyone kno cks again at the door, clear ye out of my visual path.” They were all trembling with excitement and a mixed feeling of anger and desire for a power equal to his.

The Man who stole Eyes was one of these. Without going into their respective or joint history let it be simply recorded that the proud collector of ocular jewels made present to the Lady of a pair of magnificent ear - rings — which were none other than the eyes of little Ljubov set in gold. When the Lady came to stay at the country house on the outskirts of the village, she wore her jewels. The simple peasants fell to gossip. The eyes they took for two weird precious stones resembling lapis lazuli. One of them spoke of his meeting with the Lady before poor blind little Piotr, who listened intently. I will now, my friends, give you — nay, lend you — a piece of information of the utmost importance. It's a fine bit of psychology, too.

Alack - a - day, fellows! That was a fine lady for a poor ignorant moujick to behold. She stood, to the end of his days, for a divine apparition.

Her image, however, remained clear before his eyes and he did not fail in his description of her. Well, little Piotr heard it all. As there was but one woman in the whole world whom he loved, the description of another woman did not in the least attract his attention. Only when mention was made of her magnificent jewels did his ears stand up. “What are ear - rings?” he asked of Ljubov, when he fel t her tiny hand in his, a little later. “They are beautiful things, Piotr,” she answered. “They are beautiful to the eye.” “Hah!” he sighed — for that was the one thing he could not well realize. “They are stones with fire or water in them.”"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"THE EYES OF ST.

She was walking in the garden and he listened to her voice while she sang softly to herself. Presently she sat down. Piotr was well used to directing his steps without the use of eyes, and he managed to creep behi nd her. A fixed idea had taken possession of his childish brain. He would take the jewels everyone thought so beautiful, and take them to Ljubov. Suddenly, he sprang forward and his hands searched in the darkness for the ears. A tiny little sound, made by the Lady, as she turned round, helped him to find the place. His fingers closed on each side over the ears and he pulled out with a violent movement.

I was hiding behind a tree when Piotr approached her, and so I witnessed their meeting. He, also, was quaking with excitement. Brandishing his two hands, somew hat red with the blood of his victim, he spoke pantingly. “Ljubov, my little sister,” he said, “I have two fine jewels for thee. Feel them.” But as she put her hand forward he withdrew his; and, instinctively, rubbed the two ear - rings with a corner of his blouse. The particles of flesh fell down during the process. Then he took a step nearer to her and seized her shoulder, endeavouring to place one pendant where he knew it ought to be worn. But his hand trembled much; neither was her own body steady.

Our villain, the Man who bought and stole Eyes, must have done his job very properly indeed, for Ljubov, who, in a vain attempt to see that which was shewn her, had open wide the dark cav ities under her eyebrows. Well, I suppose the eye touched a still sensitive nerve. No sooner had it done so than she uttered an exclamation. “I see! Piotr, I SEE !

By R ESPIRO . 2 s . 6 d . A New Editions. C. W. Pearce and Co., 139 , West Regent Street, Glasgow. If we in any way to shadow forth the Ineffable, it must be by a degrada - tion. Every symbol is a blasphemy agains the Truth that it indicates. A painter to remind us of the sunset has no better material than dull ochre. So we need not be surprised if the Unity of Subject and Object in Con - sciousness which is Samadhi, the uniting of the Bride and the Lamb which is Heaven, the uniting of the Magus and the God which is Evocation, the uniting of the Man and his Holy Guardian Angel which is the seal upon the work of the Adeptus Minor, is symbolized by the geometrical unity of the circle and the square , the arithmetical unity of the 5 and the 6, and (for more universality of comprehension) the uniting of the Lingam and Yoni, the Cross and the Rose. For as in earth - life the sexual ecstasy is the loss of self in the Beloved, the creation of a third consc iousness treanscending its parents, which is again reflected into matter as a child; so, immeasurably higher, upon the Plane of Spirit, Subject and Object join to disappear, leaving a transcendent unity. This third is ecstasy and death; as above, so below . It is then with no uncleanness of mind that all races of men have adored an ithyphallic god; to those who can never lift their eyes above the basest plane the sacrament seems filth. Much, if not all, of the attacks upon Thomas Lake Harris and his worthy successor “Respiro” is due to this persistent misconception by prurient and degraded minds. When a sculptor sees a block of marble he things “How beautfiul a statue is hidden in this! I have only to knock off the chilps, and it will appear!” This being ac hieved, the builder comes along, and says: “I will burn this, and get lime for my mortar.” There are more builders than sculptors in England."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 328 This is the Magic Mirror of the Soul; if you see God in everything, it is because you are God and have made the u niverse in your image; if you see Sex in everything, and think of Sex as something unclean, it is because you are a sexual maniac. True, it is, of course, that the soul must not unite herself to every symbol, but only to the God which every symbol veils. A nd Lake Harris is perfectly clear on the point. The “counterpart” is often impersonated, with the deadliest results. But if the Aspirant be wise and favoured, he will reject all but the true. And I really fail to see much difference between this doctrine and our own of attaining the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, or the Hindu doctrine of becoming one with God. We may easily agree that Lake Harris made the error of thinking men pure - minded, and so used language which the gross migh t misinterpret; but sincere study of this book will make the truth apparent to all decent me.

To say that all end in the Lock or the river i s to say that you know nothing about the subject; for many marry, as Mayhew points out; in fact, Mayhew, in his classic “London Labour and the London Poor” is the only author I know — always excepting Charles Drysdale — who in any way saw the modern London het aira as she really is. Drysdale in his courageous work, “the Elements of Social Science,” also points out that the life of the ordinary prostitute is a very much healthier one than that of the average factory girl. The authoress of this work seems to und erstand this in a way, for in spite of “the awful degradation” which she harps upon, she contradicts herself by writing: “I may here remark that the girls I come in contact with, if they marry happily, make excellent wives” (p. 66 ). The cure for the presen t degradation associated with prostitution is a common - sense one — one of not supposing that we are good and others are bad, of carting away our own manure before writing to the sanitary inspector about other people’s dung, and to cease hatching mysteries be tween the sheets of our family four - poster. If unions were sanctioned outside the marriage bond, even if such unions were only of an ephemeral nature, there would be no necessity to procure young girls, for natural love - making would take the place of state - fostered abduction. The root of the evil lies neither in the inherent lust of man after woman, which is natural, or of woman after gold, which shows her business - like capabilities; but in the unhealthy point of view adopted by the general public. There is nothing more disgusting in the act of generation, or even in the pleasures asso - ciated with it, that there is in alimentation, with its particular enjoyments. Dessert is quite a superfluous course after a good meal, and yet it is not con - sidered degrad ing to eat it; and so, as it is not considered a crime to eat for the pleasure of eating, neither should it publicly (privately of course it is not) be considered a crime if unions take place without offspring resulting. This double - faced attitude must ha ve the bottom knocked out of it as well as the front; it must utterly perish. From the natural, that is, the common - sense point of view, there are no such things as moral or immoral unions, for all nature demands is healthy parents and healthy children, h ealthy pleasures and healthy pains. The Church, the Chapel, and the Registry Office must go; for, so long as they remain , prostitutio n will spell degradation, and marriage falsehood and hypocrisy. Chaos will not result when Virtue weds with Vice, for wha t is possible to the savage is possible for us, and the children will be looked after better than ever.

His then secretary, Mr. Hewston, had given me to understand that the Vigilance Society made a practice of paying (o n behalf of and at the expense of the fathers) allowances to the mothers of illegitimate children, of caring for the mothers, helping them to get work,and eventually marrying them to honest fellows of their own class. This seemed too sensible to be true. Mr. Hewston's honest heart had let him to misunderstand. Mr. Coote indignantly corrected this view of the society's work.

This is a very extraordinary book, and it should be a fair “eye - opener” to such as consider the Qabalah a fanciful concatenation of numbers, words, and names. Also it may come as rather a rude shock to some of our “fancied” knowalls, our “cocksureites,” who are under the delusion that knowledge w as born with their grandmothers, and has now reached perfection in themselves, for it proves conclusively enough by actual measurements of existing monuments and records that the ancients, hundreds of years ago, were perfectly well acquainted with what we are pleased in our swollenheadiness to call “the discoveries of modern science.” Every ancient temple was built on a definite symbolic design and was not a haphazard erection of brick and mortar dependent on the £ s . d . On the contrary, it closely foll owed the measurements of the body of Christ or of a Man which it was supposed to represent. The three great canonical numbers are 2,368 (IESOUS CHRISTOS), 1,480 (CHRISTOS) and 888 (IESOUS), Numerous other numbers also occur but most hinge on these three. Here is an example. 888 , 1,480 and 2,368 are to each other in the ration of 3 , 5 and 8 . 358 is numerically equal to Messiah, and 358 ½ × 6 = 2,151 which is again a symbol of the Hebrew Messiah.

Last year we had the pleasure of review in Major Kelly’s “Kant’s Philosophy as Rectified by Schopenhauer,” and we hope that if the future further vol umes are to appear, and if they are as interesting as the present one, we may “continue the motion.” Kant’s categories are in type similar to the Sephiroth of the Qabalah emana - tions from an unknown “x” sign or God, and whether this sign is called “à prior i,” “autonomy” or “categorical affirmative” matters no whit. Kant’s ethics are futile, and to an intellect like Schopenhauer’s absolutely childish. Kant never could understand “morality” because he never transcended the reason, practically, or even theor etically. If there is a moral law in the Formative World it is probably the line of least resistance. But the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and fixed laws of heteronomy and of autonomy are absurd, and if Kant had once transcended the Reason he w ould have had direct experience of this fact. On p. 126 Schopenhauer sets him right as follows: “The essence of the world is will. . . . the only way of salvation is by negation of the will, or by self - denial and renunciation. . . .” And again: “. . . lif e is the attainment of self - consciousness, in order that the will may acquire a right knowledge of its own nature. . . .” (p. 157 ). “Evil and pleasure are but different manifestations of the one will to live” (p. 177 ). “The tormentor and the tormented are one.” . . . “Therefore what is good for one person may be just the opposite for another . . . all suffering is nothing but unfulfilled or crossed willing” (pp. 178 - 182 ). “When a man has so far got rid of this veil that it no longer causes an egoistical dis tinction between his own person and that of another, he will recognize his innermost and true self in all beings, regard their endless suffering"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"THE BIG STICK 341 as his own, and so appropriate to himself the pain of the while world\" (p. 184 ).

The first thing one has to do is to compose oneself in a comfortable position, for this book is large and weights I don't know how many pounds; the next to remember that the author has an axe to grind, or at least has co nstituted himself leading counsel for his client Egypt, and in a learned and most convincing argument not only proves the undoubted antiquity of his client's claim, but that it was from Egypt, or rather Central Africa, that the human race originated, and t hat it is to Egyptian symbolism, and more particularly to the Ritual of the Dead, that we must go if we would rightly understand the temples, rites, ceremonies, and customs of mankind past and present. From Egypt they came and to Egypt must we go. The boo k is in every sense a great book, and, by the way, it forms an excel - lent seventh volume to Gerald Massey's monumental work. Brother Wynn Westcott is very rightly condemned as displaying a peculiarly acute ignorance of both Freemasonry and Egyptology, and further on so is that chattering journalist, Mr. Andrew Lang — the Paul Carus of the British Isles. Dr. Churchward is a Freemason of a very high degree, but yet not high enough to understand that secrets that need safeguarding are no secrets at all. “L. H. ” for left hand is excusable because it saves printers' ink; but “these need no explanation to R.A.M.’s” etc., etc., is ridiculous because R.A.M.’s need not be told about it, and if you are not going to divulge this frightful secret about a “Tau” why bothe r to say so? Remember that “an indicible arcanum is an arcanum which cannot be revealed,” even by a R.A.M.! The Hebrew throughout is very faulty; either Dr. Churchward knows none, or else the proofs have been sadly neglected. But now let us turn to the subject over which he must have spent years of labour. Man he traces back to the Pygmies of Central Africa, these or beings very like them hundreds of thousands of years ago emigrated all over the world — they were Paleolithic man, and whether these ape - like little beings had a Mythos"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 342 or not would appear to be doubtful, but the next great exodus, that of Neolithic man, carried with it the Stellar Mythos, — that of the Seven Stars and the Pole Star, and the varied quarters to which these primitive men travelled is carefully indicated on the map at the end of the book. Though it may seem strange that they crossed vast oceans, it must be born in mind that the configurations of the globe have changed since those remote periods; besides, primitive man did get about the world in a most extraordinary way, as such islands as Madagascar and Easter Island prove. The inhabitants of the former are Polynesian and not African, of the later, seemingly Melanesian, judging by their skulls, and the Solomon Islands, the nearest M elanesian islands to Easter Island, are thousands of miles away. Ducie Island, the nearest island to Easter Island, is many hundred miles away, and the coast of South America is no less than 2,300 miles distant. And yet in this tiny island we find proofs of very high civilization, and it is curious that Dr. Churchward has not mentioned the numerous hieroglyphics found there concerning which a very full account is given in the Smithsonian Reports of 1889 . After these came another exodus, carrying with it the Lunar and Solar Mythos, and Horus became under varying names the supreme world - god, and his four sons, or emanations, the four quarters. It is impossible here to enter into the numerous entrancing speculations that Dr. Churchward draws, or to give any adequate idea of the vast number of proofs that he marshals to convince us — they are quite bewildering. In fact, they completely reverse our conception of polytheism; for it is we who are the idolators, and not our ancestors; it is we who sacrifice to many gods, and not those little Bushmen who felt and saw and lived with the One Great Spirit. Let us therefore mention that the chief points, a few out of a score, that have struck us are — The Custom of the Mark Sacred Stone; the universality of Horus worship; the startling identity of hieroglyphics, all over the world, with the Egyptian; and the symbolism of the Great Pyramid, and its use as a Temple of Initiation. A few others, however, do not understand. On p. 80 Dr. Churchward traces the “Bull Roarer” back to Egypt. But we can find no proofs of these ever having been used there. In Australia, as he states, they were used, and so also in New Zealand and New Guinea and over most of Europe; in Sussex, country boys to this day use them as toys. Again, the Eg yptian throwing - stick (p. 67 ) is not a boomerang at all; it was made of thick rounded wood and will not return when thrown. It is as perfectly distinct from the Australian weapon as the Australian is from the throwing - clubs of Fiji. The double triangle s ymbol (?) is so common in the Pacific Islands that it is to be found on nearly every club and utensil; in some cases it represents figures of men with bent knees and arms akimbo.

On p. 228 he quotes as an example of original sign - language that he “watched with interest our bluejackets leaning over the side of a man - of - war talking to one another” by means of their hands and fingers. Of course what they are really doing is semaphore signalling without flags after the official signalling with flags has ceased. In spite of these small over - eagernesses, this book is a revolutionary volume, a work that should stimulate argument and comment; and we hope that it will induce others to collect and discover the secrets of the past before they are devoured by our Minotaurean Civilization. It is a melancholy fact that though amongst the rudest of rude savages secrets have been kept and great systems maintained for hundreds of thousands of years, the “clever” children of the present with all their arts and crafts are only destroyers of the past. We defame antiquity, annihilate those who still venerate it — mentally we destroy their minds with a corrupt and idolatrous Christianity, a veritable haggis of guts and blood, and their bodies with gunpowder and loathsome diseases. In a few years all will have gone; but (say you?) all will be saved, stored in our libraries and museums. But, we an swer, even these in a few centuries will be dust and ashes; the very paper of this book which we are reviewing, beautiful though it be, will, like a girl's beauty, vanish before forty years are past. Our inventions are our curse, they are our destruction. What was coagulated in the minds of barbarians for thousands and tens of thousands of years we shall have destroyed utterly, utterly, in as many days and nights. Civilization has driven her plough over Stellar and Solar mythology, wantonly, and at hapha zard, and in their place she has cultivated the Unknowable and Andrew Lang!

In a Tuscan grove he findeth, from the antics of a Satyr, that the Gods sill dwell with men. Mistaking orgasm for ecstasty, he is found ridiculous. xvi. Baiting for It with gilded corn in a moonlit vale of Spain, he findeth the bait stolen by bermin. xvii. In Crete a metaphysician weaveth a labyrinth. Sir Palamede compelleth him to pursue the quarry in this same fashion. Running like hippogriffs, they plunge over the precipice; and the hermit, dead, appears but a mangy ass.

Hush — God knows — God knows! Then on a sudden in the midst of them Is a swart god, from hoof to girdle a goat, Upon his brow the twelve - star diadem And the King's Collar fastened on this throat.

We shall reward you by befoulment, by cant, by misunderstanding, and by understanding. This to you who wear the Phrygian cap, not as symbol of Liberty, O ribald ones, but of sacrifice and victory, of Inmost Enlightenment, of the s oul's deliverance from the fetters of the very soul itself — fear not; you are not ‘replacing truth of thought by mere expertness of mechanical skill.’ “You who hold more skill and more power than your great English predecessor, Robertus de Fluctibus, you h ave not feared to reveal ‘the Arcana which are in the Adytum of God - nourished Silence’ to those who, abandoning nothing, will sail in the company of the Brethren of the Rosy Cross towards the Limbus, that outer, unknown world encircling so many a universe. ” “John Bull,” in the course of a long review by Mr. “John Bull,” in the course of a long review by Mr. HERBERT VIVIAN HERBERT VIVIAN “The author is evidently that rare combination of genius, a humorist and a philosopher. For pages he will bewilder the mind with abstruse esoteric pronouncements, and then, all of a sudde n, he will reduce his readers to hysterics with some surprisingly quaint conceit. I was unlucky to begin reading him at breakfast and I was moved to so much laughter that I watered my bread with my tears and barely escaped a convulsion.” “The Times” “The Times” “The Light wherein he writes is the L.V.X., of that which, first mastering and then transcending the reason, illumines all the darkness caused by the interference of the opposite waves of thought. . . . It is one of the most suggestive definitions of KONX — the L VX of the Brethren of the Rosy Cross — that it transcends all the possible pairs of opposites. Nor does this sound nonsensical to those who are acquainted with that LVX. But to those who do not it must remain as obscure and ridiculous as spherical trigonom etry to the inhabitants of Flatland.” “The Literary Guide” “The Literary Guide” “He is a lofty idealist. He sings like a lark at the gates of heaven. ‘Konx Om Pax’ is the apotheosis of extravagance. the last word in eccentricity.
