Carroll \"Psyber Magick\" Part One Magick, Manifesting, And The High Self Intro: What do we mean by \"psychic\" influence? A. The ability to influence events, people and circumstances using other than, or in proper conjunction with, the normal \"sensory\" means. B. The ability to recognize, and properly build, create, influence and use the required energies, attitudes, beliefs and states of consciousness required to bring about the desired results. What do we mean by magick? Change in accordance with one's will and imagination, utilizing the energy of body, breath and mind. True magic selects a reality and then reaches back through time to shape us and events to be ready and prepared to meet it. This is counter-intuitive to western ideas of causality and struggle; STRUGGLE IS NOT EFFORT. \"All magic is, is change.

It is a primary rule of magick that who you bring into an operation is going to be what you get out. If you bring in your old self. ..loaded with weakness, lack of being deserving, an iron \"will to fail\" then that is what you will get out....but magnified many times worse. Therefore first and foremost to make magick work you must: Creating the willingness to be commanding. All you operations must be channeled through this willingness. B.

Person A should imagine floating above the group and looking down at the tops of everyone's heads. Then person A should float down into person B and imagine seeing the group from person B's perspective. Person C's job is to watch person B to see if he can tell WHEN person A has floated inside them. Everyone switches roles and takes a turn in each of the positions. Exercise Two: Staying in the same 3 person group, do the same exercise except do the following first: before floating above and stepping into person B, person A should defocus their vision and look peripherally at person B and C. Calibrate the difference in the feeling of the experience from how it feels when you look directly at the person. Exercise Three: Same as before, only this time, Person A shifts their posture to a slight rounding of shoulders...slight slumping forward and makes scooping gesture with hand. Calibrate difference in the feeling of the experience from previous exercise. Exercise Four: Same as before, only this time, A and B stand at least 10 feet apart. A, before stepping into B, imagines extending arm and touching B on small of back....feeling both the feeling of B's back against his hand AND what B's back feels like being touched by A's hand. . THEN step in....C should stay close to person B and observe when he believes B is being touched and WHEN B has been stepped into by A.

Remotely Influencing Version One: The Etheric Yank (Note: This can also be used to manifest/influence someone you have not even yet physically met! Distance is NO problem, nor is time with this operation!) 1. Energize with breathing 2.Enter place of unlimited possibility 3. Create magickal self. 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"4. Zip up energy created and surround yourself with gold bubble. 5. Sit down inside magickal circle. 6. Reach upward and invoke the High Self down into the working, stating words to the effect of, \"I now draw my High Self down into this operation, to insure the successful completion of this working\". 7. Begin to visualize and feel a circle of energy spinning around solar plexus area. 8. Allow this to form a tunnel or tube and extend it out to the person you wish to draw, seeing them at the other end. 9. Pull this tube forward, getting the sense that you are actually yanking it back in, like tugging a kite string. If you so desire, reach out with both hands and yank this tube or tunnel. 10. Now get the sense that the actual person is there, actually physically present, standing before you inside of your gold bubble.. 11. Open arms and greet them warmly. See your energy extending from your solar plexus to theirs, filling them up entirely and increase the brightness and warmth of gold bubble. 12. Reach out and unzip the person's energy meridians. Then unzip your own, letting your energy flow into and fill them. 13. Reach out now with your actual physical arms, and grab this person's head. Remove it from their body, turn it around, and place it on top of your head. 14As you do so, command that your unconscious is now absorbing everything it needs to know about this person to enable you to automatically act in every way you need to in order to bring about what it is you want from this person. 15. Now, replace this person's head back on their body. 16. Mentally, step around behind this person, and begin speaking in their ear as you wrap your arms around them. Imagine that you can feel what they would physically feel if this were occurring.. As you do, show them a movie screen of you and they doing what it is you want them to do with you, and as you do so, describe to THEM all the benefits, values, good feelings that flow to THEM as a result of this. (Magick MUST serve the interests of MORE than one person for it to truly work!) 17. As you show them this movie, shift perspectives from: A. Being inside of them, in the movie, experiencing what they would hear, see and feel in that movie. 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"B. Being inside of them watching the movie, feeling all emotional satisfaction or other feelings feel in their body as they watch the movie. C. Continue to narrate to them how they are responding. Example: \"Look how happy we are together\" or \"Look at how glad you are you hired me! Notice all the benefits you are getting in your business!\" If you are using this for seduction, make sure you give them WARM, SAFE, COMFORTABLE feelings BEFORE YOU \"TURN UP THE HEAT\". Take your time! 18. Step outside of this scene, and see them standing once again in front of you. Say to them, \"You want this now..don't you?\" 19. Hear and see them give their assent! \"Yes...Yes I do!\" Then zip UP their energy meridians, and lock them closed, seeing the energy of thought forms vibrant within them, spreading up, down and throughout their bodies 18. Say to them, \"Go then..and make these thoughts your own until you are compelled to act on them!\" 19. Extend the tube outward again, and see them vanish down its length. 20. Take some of the key images from this operation. See them floating again in front of you, within your gold bubble/circle. 21. Connect with your High Self through the aka cord. 22. Raise up arms as you lift up the thought forms to the High Self, adding golden/energized breaths each time. Do this four times. On the fourth one, notice how the thought forms seem to enter into a Higher Realm.. .you can imagine the bubbles they are in opening and expanding and they take on a life of their own. 23. As in the Huna prayer rite, say, \"Take these thought forms, manifest and real already in your realm, and make them manifest and real in this, the physical realm, for the greatest good of all concerned. So mote it be (or amen, or so let it be done). 24. The operation is concluded, let the rain of blessings fall. 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"25. Zip up your own energy meridians. 26. Close ritual. (We'll discuss different ways to do this!) Ending note: Do this ritual about once every 3-4 days for about 3 weeks. If you know the person and have frequent contact, you might suddenly find their non-verbal behavior changing toward you, or you may get a sudden inspiration upon awakening one morning as to exactly what step or steps to take to influence this person. Sometimes this ritual works by BOTH influencing them psychically AND giving you the exact insight you need. If need be, keep going for 5-6 weeks. If at any time you get a strong feeling of resistance while performing the ritual, stop. Enter a meditative state and evaluate the energies from which you are performing it. It may well be that what you wish to have occur would actually cause you OR the other person great harm, were it to be granted, and therefore, you are subconsciously resisting it, which is a GOOD thing. In this case, ask for guidance from Higher Intelligence! Remember, unless your operation will benefit AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE it will not work! Do NOT LUST FOR RESULTS! This should be done, as all of what you are learning, with an attitude of relaxed expectation. Nudge the universe...don't NOODGE..avoid the \"Daddy..are we there yet?\" phenomena! Most important, take the actions you need in the world as well as doing your magickal/psychic work! Remember too: YOU WILL GET NOT WHAT YOU \"WANT\" BUT WHAT THE ENERGIES YOU CREATE AND PROJECT CAN CONNECT WITH! If your energy/intent is needy, hostile, angry then this ritual will ONLY work to draw those who are in that place. Clear your energy to one of relaxed, excited, happy eager to share something that will work out best for ALL concerned AND yet commanding at the same time. Version Two: Dream VCR 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"(Note: I do this one laying down. Maybe it helps me get better rapport with someone who is asleep and dreaming!) 1. Pick a time when you reasonably believe or are informed your subject will be asleep. (I usually set my clock for 3:30 AM to do this...you gotta be motivated to get up that early!) 2. Do steps one through six from Etheric Yank; it still applies here. 3. Imagine that you are looking through the wall of your room into a room directly next door to yours...a room that shares an adjoining wall. Through that wall, you can see your subject, asleep and dreaming, in their bed. 4. As you do this, you can see that they are having a dream and you can vaguely perceive the images/thoughts running through their head, like cartoon dialogue balloons. You can even see them tossing and turning a bit and muttering out loud in their sleep. 5. Do what I call the Psychic Head-butt. (Not to be confused with a psychic Butt-head!) Reach out with your actual physical arms, with each hand on an opposite side of the bed. 6. As you yank the bed toward you, literally raise your head and torso forward, so that as the bed moves toward you, you equally move toward it. 7. Now imagine you are standing in their room, 2 or 3 feet from their bed. 8. Imagine now that there is a TV set floating about a foot away from the foot of their bed. 9. Reach out with your physical hands and feel the texture of the glass TV screen. I actually rap on it with my knuckles of my right hand so I can feel the texture of the glass and hear the sound the rap makes. 10. Imagine there is a cable running from the back of the TV to the back of your subject's head, just where the head joins the neck. (The occiput I believe it is called). 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11. Hear the click as you plug the cable in. 12. Now, see an image of your subject appearing on the TV screen. 13. Greet it warmly and ask, \"What's going on with (subject's name)?\" \"What do I need to learn and realize about them in order to influence them as I want?\" 14. Let it talk. When it's done, say, \"Thank you. You're dismissed\". 15. Next, imagine you have a VCR. Plug it into the back of the TV. 16. Now, command the TV to place itself inside the subject's mind, in the exact submodality location of where they see their most vivid and compelling dream imagines. This will almost always involve turning the TV around so the images are now facing THEM instead of you. 17. See a video-tape, appropriately labeled (\"Porno Princess IN HEAT\" for example if you are aiming at seduction! Or \"Hire Me NOW\" or \"Make This Business Deal..You Will Be Happy\" Briefly, from the place between your eyebrows, fire whatever series of images, thoughts etc need to be on that tape onto the tape..take care to include them enjoying all the benefits of giving YOU what YOU want...if you can't do this, then you are attempting to work an infringement...and it will not work....You do not have to see these images clearly..just get a sense that all the images that need to be on this tape(which is on an endless play loop, by the way) are now being fired/engraved on it. 18. Pop tape in VCR. 19. Hit play. 20. See the imagery from inside their dreaming body, feeling what it would feel like inside their body to have such an amazing dream. If it is a seduction dream, imagine what physical sensations they'd be having in their bodies. If it is a dream about hiring you, then of course, feel the satisfaction they feel in working with you, etc. etc. MAKE THIS VIVID!. 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"21. Switch perspectives, and see the scene from 2-3 feet away from their bed. See their actual physical body in bed, having whatever responses it is having. 22. Switch perspectives back to inside their dream. 23. Switch back to foot of bed. See them finishing dream....the thought bubbles receding now back into their mind, as they again enter a period of sleeping quietly. 24. End ritual by ending visualization and closing. 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"J: Hello friends and Piranha members, this is Joe Polish and welcome to another edition of the Joe Polish Superstar Audio Tape Series. And today I've got Mr. Ross Jeffries on the line. Ross can you hear me okay? R: I can hear you Joe. J: Fantastic, this should be an interesting interview considering that the very first tape of the month interview that I ever did was with Ross'. And that was gosh, a few years ago, quite a long time ago it seems. R: And also I need to jump in here and say I feel somewhat responsible for having created the marketing monster that you are since I believe it was me that first pointed out to you that you weren't a carpet cleaner, you're actually a marketer. I think I turned you on to Gary Halbert's newsletter. J: Yes, that is very true. You actually handed me the very first Gary Halbert newsletter and it's been an interesting few years ever since. R: So that's one of my fun things to do is to introduce viruses into people's minds and step back and watch the results. J: Exactly. R: That's sort of like a mental Johnny Appleseed. J: Yes, so this interview, R: Maybe I'm just mental, I don't know. J: Well either way you're a little wacky and so is Gary but both of you are very bright, R: Well Joe, you gotta be wacky to be successful in this world. If you're the average person and you think and act conventionally, you'll have a conventional life. J: Yes, I agree with that. So what I'd like to talk about today, well there's a lot of things but you have a lot of insights, you have a very interesting background in terms of what you do for a living and many of the things that you do, and we can talk a little bit about that. But you are actually one of the brightest people that I've ever met in terms of really understanding the mind sets that are required for people to achieve things and to be successful and to obtain results and to influence and persuade people. So I'd like to touch on all those subjects during this interview and I will say that the reason I am doing this interview is because that first initial interview that I did with you was so well received that that's what actually started my Tape Of The Month program. I never would have even thought to have done a on going interview series like I do today where I've interviewed so many successful people had I not ever first done that interview with you and had so many of my Piranha members say wow, this is really amazing. So I do want to thank you first off for starting that. R: Well you're welcome. I'll tell you something funny, every month when I get my marketing superstar series audio tape, I honestly I really do, I stop everything I'm 1"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"doing, I open up the envelope, I throw away the audio tape because I like my information presented in written form but I immediately sit down with the transcript of the interview and read it very thoroughly. And I consider I've been more than repaid many many times over with, it's amazing to me how you get some of the most intelligent people on the planet to offer you up information absolutely free too. Somebody should interview you and your strategies at getting brilliant people to work for you for free. J: Yeah actually me and Jeff Paul were talking not too long ago about one of my skills is direct response networking. And that's my ability to get very well known, very famous people, very bright people on the phone and get them to reveal some of their best secrets on all types of business things and just get their knowledge and put it on tape and share it with other people. So I actually do,think it's a skill and a unique ability that I've developed first and foremost from learning and understanding marketing and applying that to that type of situation. R: And let me also say to those of you who are just starting out as entrepreneurs, or those of you who are already far along the road, one of the hidden benefits that I never expected is not only just being your own boss, but more than that, you get to draw to you very very brilliant people and to me basically what life is about is drawing the right people to you and being able to enjoy them in the right ways and learn from them and to enjoy each other. And one of the benefits from being an entrepreneur if you're really out there sticking your neck out in the way you do, you're gonna meet people who admire that and because they admire it they're gonna be willing to work with you. And you'll meet some amazing people on the path. I think one of the things about being an entrepreneur is it should never be just about making the money. Making the money is a way to measure that you're doing what the market wants you to be doing, for sure. It's important and you gotta do that. And yet if that's all it's about, you could get a job working I guess as a president of a bank and make more money or maybe not. To me though it's gotta be about other things. You've gotta have a passion for what you're doing and you've gotta enjoy meeting the right kind of people along the way. J: Yeah, exactly. Now since we are talking about entrepreneurs Ross, what is your definition of an entrepreneur? R: I think an entrepreneur is someone who seeks out opportunity, brings it to the market, makes a profit off it but in doing so he makes, he or she by the way, he or she makes an impact that counts for something. And an entrepreneur is someone who is always looking for opportunities and then taking that opportunity, bringing it to the market place, making it work and then here's the important thing, they have to systemize it so they can repeat it over and over and over again. I know some people who you also know who I consider to be absolutely brilliant marketers. If 1 wanted a letter written and I didn't want to write it myself, which of course would never happen since I'm a brilliant writer myself, I would hire these people. And yet they're not entrepreneurs. Because they don't know how to systemize what they're doing. I can think of a very brilliant copy writer who shall go un-mentioned who's an absolute genius but the guy goes out of business and then makes his money again, he goes broke and makes his money again cause he said something to me once, he said you don't understand, once I create a promotion I lose interest entirely. So an entrepreneur it's not enough to merely create the opportunity, you have to bring it to life, you have to systematize it and keep it going. 2"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"J: Why do you think that some entrepreneurs really do, and when I say some entrepreneurs clearly there's a lot of people that run businesses that don't have those traits to keep things systemized, why do you see that some people can be successful for certain stretches of time and then lose it all, R: Their values are wrong. Their values are, there's a certain, one of these days I'm going to do a course on the intelligent management of creativity. Because one of the most dangerous things in the world is to be a creative person. And let me tell you what I mean by that. I don't mean the external dangers:' Sure if you're creative and you look at things differently, you're unconventional, you're gonna get criticized. And you're gonna get hounded to death by the media. I'm an expert in this. I am an expert in what it means to take incredible lies and hits from the media and criticism like you wouldn't believe. J: Yes that's true. R: That's not the real danger. The real danger in being a highly creative person is the total thrill is just in the creativity. Unless you're creating in the service of a practical, measurable market driven result, then you may as well be playing in a sandbox as far as having an impact on the world and building a business. A lot of creative people make a couple of mistakes. The first mistake that highly creative people make is that once they've done the creativity that's it. It's creativity in the service of the feeling they get when they create. Now there's nothing wrong with that. I love sitting behind my computer and writing my outrageous sales letters. I love creating new materials for my courses. I love it. I'm passionately in love with it. But I learned early on that unless I did that in the service of a measurable financial result, I wasn't gonna get anywhere. So that's the first problem with highly creative people. The second problem and this is a huge one, is creativity does not imply let alone guarantee mastery. Just because you create the system of something doesn't mean that you yourself are guaranteed mastery or application. You still have to work at applying it. Now I know that we both know people in the self-improvement field, we both know people who write books. And we also know that a lot of those people don't get the results they write about. It's said that those who can't do, teach. Well that's not true really, those who really do extraordinarily well always wind up teaching cause they want to convey their passion and their solutions to other people. But the bottom line is this. Many creative people think arrogantly and quite incorrectly that because they created something they automatically are the masters of it. And it's just not true. So if you consider yourself a creative person you better set up some kind of system to monitor your own practice and to monitor your own progress. Because the fact that you've created something doesn't give you mastery over it. It just doesn't. It's a huge myth. It is as big and as dangerous a myth as the myth you constantly discuss in your marketing material that if you're just very good at what you do, people will beat a path to your door. That's a huge lie. J: Yes, it is. R: Right along with the other lie hi I'm here from the government; I'm here to help you. That's a huge lie. Your check is in the mail. Well another huge lie is that if you've created something you're therefore the master of it and you're not. It's a huge delusion and don't thing that because you see someone on t.v. in an info- mercial that they're the master of what they're talking about. I can tell you from personal experience it ain't so. 3"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"J: I can second that also. Well very good point. There's a couple of things that you mentioned in what you just said. One is that you need to set up what you're doing in a manner to make money with and I wanted to ask you why is that so important that if you're gonna be successful, R: People come and take your stuff. If you're not paying your bills, you can feel great, it's the starving artist syndrome. You can be feeling great, you're creating something wonderful, but if the marketplace isn't buying it, we live in a capitalist society, they're gonna come and take your stuff. J: Yeah and what I mean by that is from the standpoint of if you really want to do something useful to the world and let's do it in terms of somebody that has information that they're passionate about that they would like to convey, that they need to bring in money, they need to make money in order to fuel the cause. And some people I think have a huge problem with, on one hand they want to be entrepreneurial they want to be capitalistic, but then a lot of people perceive money and going out and charging high fees and things like that as somehow is evil. R: Oh well that's because there exists in our society what I call a Marxist mist, m i s t. I believe that while communism may be dead, it's ghost lives on. In phrases like the following, filthy rich. Okay there's no such thing as filthy rich. There's filthy poor but there's no such thing as filthy rich. Or when people go to Vegas and they lose all their money, they say wow I really took a bath or I got cleaned out. No, no, no. You got dirtied up when you lose your money. There is, we live in a very schizophrenic society. We live in a society that on the one hand measures so much by money but on the other hand it's assumed that if you're really successful you must have cheated someone to get there. There's a tremendous undercurrent of envy that motivates people in our society. And we're taught that if you're rich, it's either cause you're lucky or because you ripped someone off or because you're an evil heartless person. Look at the famous characters in literature. Scrooge, for my money Scrooge was a hero. I think Scrooge was a hero. He was standing up and keeping his skepticism in the face of everyone else wanting to ram a celebration down his throat. He didn't feel like conforming. And they had to resort to super natural trickery to get him to change his mind. Frankly if Tiny Tim had kicked off in the story I would have celebrated. That little whining brat, put his face down in a pudding so he drowns in it. Where was I, I'm rambling here. J: That is funny. That is, got a humorous side to it. R: I am rambling here. J: Well definitely, R: Oh yeah about making money. Why people feel bad about making money. A lot of it has to do with media stereotyping. I mentioned Scrooge but look some of the movies in recent years about Wall Street and the devil is as businessman ectetera. So I think the media, the press likes to cater to the envy of the sheeple. I talk about sheeple. I think most people are sheeple. They look like humans, they talk like humans but really they're programmed to obey and to accept ideas without much critical thinking and they accept imagery and symbols even stronger than they do words. And if you ask most people when I say the word salesman. If you asked most of the listeners what imagery, not what words, but picture images pop up into their mind when I say salesman, they'll probably say well a used car salesman 4"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"who's wearing a mis-matched loud plaid jacket with a glow in the dark tie. He talks real fast, his hair is slicked back. He's got beady little eyes. Sounds like you Joe. J: Thank you Ross. R: These images are so pounded into the mindset of sheeple that this is the kind of thing that people have to deal with. And I think that we're taught that making money can only be done if you're ripping people off and it's just not true. I believe something. I believe that if you passionately, passionately,have something that you must share with people and you truly are having a positive impact then even with a minor bit of marketing knowledge you can do quite well. I believe that money is really a measure of the value that you're creating for other people. If you're genuinely are creating tremendous value for people then you must charge. If you don't charge then you're creating an imbalance in the universe. J: I agree, totally agree. Now a lot of people think that people with tons of money are people that make lots of money lack integrity. First off I'd like you to comment on that and secondly, R: It depends on how they made their money. If you're a Mafioso and you make your money that way, obviously you lack integrity. If you're a politician you're even worse than a Mafioso and you really lack integrity. But I don't' think you have to lack integrity to make money. And by the way, I honestly, honest, honest, honest to God don't believe that making money is the be all and end all of things. If you looked at you and I, financially I'm sure you're more successful than I am but simply I don't care to focus on it as much as you do. It's not really why I'm in the game. I'm extraordinarily happy with where I'm at. I love what I do, passionately love what I do and I'm happy where I'm at financially. I don't feel any motivation to really charge it up and make more than I do. I absolutely could if I really wanted to very easily. But I'm happy. J: Well what's the purpose of what you do then for you? R: Me? I don't know how much you want me to talk about what I do. What I like to do is I have a slogan I came up with about six months ago. And that is sorrow into solutions, pain into passion. I got into my work to solve problems I had in my own life. And when I see people, people come to me and they're expecting maybe a ten percent incremental improvement in what they're doing and I know I'm gonna hit them over the head with something so far beyond what they expected, they're staggered. I get the joy of seeing my customers staggered, astonished by the results they get with what I teach. They're not just happy, they're not just pleased, they're fuses literally are blown. If you take someone who's got a problem in their life that they've been failing at miserably and all of a sudden they're getting massive success it totally blows apart their view of the world. Suddenly they go back to that time when they were kids when anything could be possible and something wonderful was about to happen. I'm in it for that. I'm really truly in it to have that kind of impact on people and to draw to me absolutely brilliant people. My students and customers, some of them are so incredibly intelligent. A lot of my customers and students are innovators in some very technical fields. I had a student who wanted to come do a course. I said look I'll make you a deal. You can take one of my courses for free, I want you to explain physics to me. This is a kid who used to build thermo-nuclear weapons. Now he builds super computers for the National Security Agency. And so I spent three hours on the phone while he explained quantum physics to me. Now that may not be an interest of yours, but 5"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"it's always been an interest to me and I never could understand it before. And this kid elegantly made it all understandable to me. And by the way, I'm a math retard. 1 hate math. I can't, he did it without any mathematics. So part of the reason I'm in this is I get to meet the best minds possible. J: Yeah, that's pretty much why I do what I do in a lot of ways. R: But I think in your case you're compensating for a massive inferiority complex. J: It's possible, it's possible. Okay, so what is the purpose of business then Ross? R: For whom? J: For entrepreneurs in general. Aside from, R: I think an entrepreneur; I think really an entrepreneur is someone first of all who doesn't want to be told what to do. An entrepreneur is someone who knows that they're not gonna be able to survive in the nine to five corporate world. They don't want to be someone else's wait slave. And I'll tell you something, unless you have the mindset that says there's nothing else I can do, this is it, you may not make it. Because in the beginning it, I don't care who's system you're following and believe me please I believe in getting models. I don't mean Claudia Shiffer or anything like that, I mean getting examples of people who are already successful and learning from them. I totally believe in that. But nonetheless, you're gonna have a lot of frustration when you're starting out. There's a learning curve even with the best material, with your material, with Dan Kennedy's material, with Jeff Pauls' material, with anyones' material there's gonna be a learning curve. You're gonna make mistakes. And in the beginning it's gonna be a bit of a trial. Not necessarily a struggle cause by my definition, which I take from a very brilliant type of individual, Stuart Wilde, to me struggle is effort that's laced with emotion. So you don't have to struggle, but there's gonna be a lot of extra effort in the beginning. And unless you have the mindset that says you know what? There's nothing else I can do, I'm not meant to work for somebody else, often times people will quit. So I think to be successful in the beginning you just have to believe there's nothing else you can do. This is what you're meant to do. So first of all an entrepreneur I think is someone who can't work for anybody else. He knows he had to be his own boss, or she knows she. I want to be fair here, male or female whoever's got the drive I'm all for their being successful. J: Gotcha. Well what are some of the most difficult like, mental blind spots that entrepreneurs have to overcome before they can become successful? R: Entrepreneurs need to understand that the majority of people in the world, and therefore the majority of the market, the majority of the customer base are not - entrepreneurs. Now let me tell you what I mean by that. That's obvious but it also contains a very deeper truth. And it's this. As an entrepreneur we tend to be focused on opportunity. In NLP we have something called meta programs. And meta programs to throw away all the NLP jargon, J: Hold on a minute before you go into that, explain what NLP is. R: NLP is a discipline, neuro-linguistic programming. And one of the things that NLP lets you do is look at the software of the human mind and to see how people sort information in their mind and how they process their own unique individual, internal 6"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"world. It's an extraordinarily beautiful, elegant and powerful model for understanding people and also moving people where you want them to go. In any case, in NLP we talked about people who move away from and people who move towards. And what this basically means is some people move away from a bad thing that they don't want to happen. Other people move towards something they really do feel motivated that they want to get. And each of us has both of these programs depending on different context. But for example, you may read a book on the history of physics because you're really curious. You want to learn about the subject. Your neighbor may read the book because they don't want to appear to be stupid or illiterate so they're moving away from something. Most entrepreneurs when it comes to a really great opportunity presented to them are going to jump on it. Then they weigh their pennies at first but they're gonna jump on it. However the bottom line is most human beings don't think that way. For most human beings and this is very difficult for entrepreneurs to accept, most human beings you have to build in a propulsion system. And what that means is it's not enough to offer them a reward. You have to show them the penalty that they will incur if they don't take action right now. Now I used to chafe at this Joe. I used to hate this. This used to sound to me so much like the car salesman that says well, if you don't buy right now the car's gonna be driven off the lot because I'm sure it's gonna be sold tomorrow. Or you've heard people say well this sale is only good 'til midnight tonight. Now we know that's bull, we know it's still gonna be there. So I'm not talking about being stupid with it. You have to be intelligent and there are ways to do it. But the bottom line is most people will not act unless you, number one light a fire behind their butt and at the same time put a ring in their nose and pull them forward. You have to both pull them forward something they want and also push them away from a consequence that they don't want to suffer. And most entrepreneurs just don't get this. Because an entrepreneur he sees a great opportunity. Sure you don't need to twist my arm. I'll jump on it. But the sheeple out in the world, they need to be reminded of the consequences. One of the things I do in my sales letters, I got 75 people to pay me 2500 bucks a pop to come to a seminar in the Bahamas. And they came in from all over the world. And one of the things I did in that sales letter is I structured it and by the way, I believe what I said in the sales letter. I totally believe it. I said to them look, if you don't come and learn these skills you're gonna suffer big consequences. Because there's a lot of people out there who don't want you to learn these skills. A lot of people have a big investment in your staying stuck at where you're at because that's how they keep you under their thumb. That's how they exploit you. And if you don't come learn these skills, you'll one of the mass of people who never quite get where they want to go because people want to keep you down. So right away by accepting that frame, by accepting that premise, which I believe is true, I don't believe I'm lying, I believe this is true, by accepting that premise that you better come or you're gonna suffer and making that consequence very real to them and also playing into some of their preset beliefs and mindsets, I've already done half my sales job. I've made it very clear to them that if they don't come they're not gonna learn these skills somewhere else or they could learn these skills but it's gonna cost them a huge financial penalty because they're gonna have to study with the individual trainers I've brought together and if they do that it's gonna cost them 25 times as much. So right then just by setting up that premise, I've done half my job. Now the other half of my job is to paint an incredible picture in their mind of all the things they're gonna benefit if they do sign up for my course. But here's the thing you don't get in conventional marketing. Time after time conventional, I don't mean to put people down by saying conventional, the people you interview are brilliant, I only wish I could write a sales letter for example as good as John Carlton or Gary Halbert. But here's the thing you gotta understand. It's not enough to outline 7"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"benefits. That's not enough. You must also tell people the consequences and the penalties in their life if they don't take action. And I don't mean the penalty being well if you don't order today you won't get the bonus, that's not enough of a penalty. I mean what's gonna happen in their life, what their friends will think of them? What'll happen to their success? Their psychological state of mind, their happiness if they don't take action? J: So do you believe if properly presented the fear of loss will be greater than the gain? Or is it, R: You have to do both. To create an effective propulsion system you have to do both. And entrepreneurs are so focused on gain, we don't think about fear of loss too much. So it's a big mental blind spot for us. For example, as, carpet cleaner okay? I think we talked about this once or I even wrote something for you. It's a picture of a gigantic dust mite, blown up to gigantic size. Remember that? I think the headline was what else is lurking in your carpet? Now right away that's presenting a huge fear, like oh my God if I don't get rid of this, this science fiction monster's gonna eat my child's brain. J: Right. R: That kind of thing is very effective. Or if you're gonna pitch carpet cleaning one of the things you do is talk about how embarrassing it is when someone comes in and sees your, what are your friends really thinking when they see your filthy carpet? You know what I'm talking about? J: Exactly, yeah. R: That kind of thing really works. J: Yes it does. R: It tremendously works. So as entrepreneurs we need to bear in mind that human beings, most of the human beings in the world don't think in the way we do. J: Yes, that's very true. Well what do you, in terms of you mentioned earlier, lighting a fire under someone's butt, putting, pulling them forward with this imaginary ring in their nose. What is your take on motivation? Why do some people equipped with the same amount of money, the same type of information, you'd think the same intellect, why is it that some people just do things and other people don't? I know that's a big question but, R: Why do people, I think here's the difference. And this is something I learned from one of my co-trainers, a brilliant hypnotist by the name of Mark Cunningham who to my mind understands hypnosis on profoundly deep levels. You see it's one thing to consider a course of action as a delicious option, a fantasy that maybe one day he'll get around to doing it. Maybe one day he'll really take the step to change your life. And really it's nice to have the option. It's like a girl, a very popular pretty girl who already has a boyfriend but when a guy asks her for her number, she gives him the number just cause she likes the thought that she can always get attention somewhere else. She keeps him in mind as a delicious option one day if she's bored. But she never really gets around to going out with the guy. You understand? J: Yes. 8"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"R: Very few people can take a want and make it into a desire. And this is another thing that entrepreneurs should get. It's not enough to sell the people's wants. Because a want, if you don't get something you want so what. And even if you do get something you want so what, you move on to something else you want. Wants are shadowy. Wants are ephemeral. Wants are things that really don't matter because hey if you don't get quite what you want, you might get something else just as good, you follow me? J: Yes I do. R: But the nature of desire is you must act on it. The nature of desire is all your energy becomes focused on how do you get this for yourself right now? The nature of desire is you think about it as something that if you don't act you'll lose the opportunity forever. You'll fall back into the midst of the sheeple, those poor folks who even in the very midst of acknowledging what it is they most want to have, never really grasp it. They go their whole lives living in regret. So instead when you feel desire you've got to make a decision. You've got to decide to awaken the part of you that wants to go for it right now, that says no more waiting. And in order to really sell people you've got to move them from want into desire. And most entrepreneurs, we're so driven by desire we don't get this. And so the difference between why some people act and some people don't, some people have a very good strategy for taking a want and building it into a desire. They know how to take something that they want and make it so real that they can taste it. And then they go and they get it. But most people don't know how to do that and that's our job as marketers. Our job as marketers is to take a want and make it so believable and so attractive and then so you better get it now, that people actually take action. J: Now what is the difference between marketing and selling? Because you are phenomenal, R: Marketing is a lot more fun to me. Marketing involves elements that sales don't permit you to indulge in really. J: Such as? R: Well to me a huge part of being a marketer is being a showman. If you're gonna be a showman you have to create an enemy. You're a great showman; your enemy is all those evil, filthy, nasty bait and switch carpet scumbags. You created an enemy. And I create enemies too. Create an enemy or identify something that your market already considers to be an enemy and then make you versus, you and your market versus those evil so and sos, whatever the so and sos may be. It may be government regulators. It maybe gun grabbers. It may be gun lobby. It doesn't • matter. That's the way it works. You have to be a showman. And to be a showman you got to be larger than life. I don't know if they ever had them in Arizona but out here in California we used to have Cal Worthington. Cal Worthington was a car dealer and he would stand on his head. He would eat a bug. He would do commercials hi this is Cal Worthington and my dog Spot. And Spot could be a chimpanzee. It could be an elephant, anything but a dog. And Cal Worthington was known for the most obnoxious, loud, outrageous commercials. And he did a huge business. There's Crazy Eddie the king of selling televisions. I don't even remember all these people. But the point is you gotta be larger than life 9"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"to get people's attention. Marketing involves a lot of entertainment value that sales I think just doesn't. J: Well let's say that you are not larger than life at least mentally. You don't feel, for many of the listeners out there that can't imagine, they might perceive what you just said as well you gotta go out there and you gotta be outspoken and I'm introverted. I'm not extroverted and I can't go out there and be a showman like that. And what I want them to understand is through the ability of good marketing you can accomplish much showmanship, R: Your letter will be your showman. Your sales letter, your headline will do all the showmanship for you, okay? Another definition is marketing is salesmanship, my definition would be marketing is salesmanship brought to larger than life proportions through some medium like print or radio or t.v. So your sales letter can do that for you. I tend to think in headlines. I always think in headlines. There's, someone asked me, there's a NLP discussion group and they said how can we learn to market our NLP practice the way you market what you do? I said one of the things you need to do is learn to speak in headlines. Learn to think in headlines. And I came up with a headline just on the spot something like the amazing eat all you want diet that lets you pig out like a corn fed Iowa hog and lose weight while you sleep, okay? You need to think in gigantic terms. You need to think in terms of headlines. Now anyone can learn to do that. Someone said to me, how do you . learn to do that? I said go get the Enquirer, go get the weekly World News, go get the Globe, go get the Star. Get all these papers and write out the headlines in long hand, word for word. Do that for a couple of weeks and you'll learn to think in headlines. You don't need to do this in person, but you can do this through one of your marketing vehicles like a sales letter or promotional audiotape or recorded message or things like that. I'd like to do it in person cause I love it. I've always thought of myself as being this way even when I was a little kid. I enjoy going out there and taunting t.v. audiences, taunting radio audiences, taunting reporters. It's fun. J: Actually this is kind of an aside, we'll come back to what we were just talking about. But I want to ask you since you mentioned it on how to deal with fear, with failure, with criticism. You have, I've seen you on t.v. many times and many of the talk shows that you've done. R: Politically Incorrect. J: Yeah, which you dominated that entire show when you were on it, R: Joe, first of all, I believe in what I'm doing. And anyone who doesn't agree with me in my mind is an idiot and is just too stupid or dishonest to see it. So first of all you have to really, really, really believe in yourself. And you have to be so passionately committed to your message that getting your message out is more important than avoiding the heat. That's number one. Number two, I just take it as a game. I go out there and I'm like the evil wrestler. There's one of the things I liked about Andy Kaufman. Andy Kaufman if you've seen the movie Man On The Moon, he loved playing the role of the bad guy. And to an extent, you create a role for yourself. So when the criticism is leveled it's not really leveled at you it's leveled at -the role you're playing. And you understand that so you can step back from it. 10"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"J: Well a lot of times going out there and playing say, like the evil wrestler and stuff could be very disadvantageous to you if you do it in the wrong way, R: Fine, that's my role. You can do something else. You can play some other role, as long as it gets attention. But let me tell you something, you're gonna be lied about. If you're in the public eye, you're gonna get lied about. I've had reporters write stories about me that are flat out lies. I've had people say that they attended my seminars when they were never there. I've had people make up quotes from me that I never even came close to saying. I've had people, you have to understand when you deal with the press, most of the press and there're notable exceptions for which I'm grateful, most of the press are human scum. Journalism requires no licensing. It really requires no standards. Anyone who can get hired can be \"a journalist\". And mostly what they want to do is get their story out on deadline. They want to the least amount of work to write a story that gets attention and do it under deadline. Cause most of them are paid pretty poorly and they're working for more than one entity, so the more crap they can pump out the faster they're gonna do it. Now if you're doing something that's unique and different and really requires some series study to understand it, you're out of luck. Cause they can either not write the story, they can invest the time it takes to really understand what you're doing, which most of them don't.have the time or budget to do, or they can ridicule you. The easiest thing for them to do is to either ridicule you or portray you as a public menace. If they can portray you as public menace, then they're important. They've justified their existence. Suddenly oh, look at me I'm mister important journalist, I'm protecting you from this rip off, this con artist. So you gotta be prepared for that. J: Yeah well the reason that I like questions like that and I like hearing responses and especially from someone like you, because I honestly don't know if I know another person that is better at deflecting and throwing it right back in someone's face when someone insults you. I've seen people on t.v. viciously attack you. And you so eloquently make them look like complete idiots. R: Well because, I have to say I have a very verbal background. I grew up in a large family. I have two brothers and three sisters and they're all extremely bright and very verbal. My parents are both very bright and very verbal. I'm the second to the youngest child so to get attention at the dinner table I had to vie with like seven other people who were older than am and just as bright. So you learn to get your words in and throw insult back for insult and you just don't worry about it. My attitude, when I go on a talk show, my attitude is that I'm ten times smarter than anyone there. That I've seen it all before. That I could punch a hat pin through my frontal lobe and huff paint and drink a quart of rot gut and still wipe the floor with everyone there. And also my attitude is I'm smarter than the host, that I'm gonna get my words in and the first thing I do within a minute of being introduced on.the show is to take control by correcting something the host says. Cause nine times out of ten they're gonna get something wrong when they introduce you. I immediately correct them to show them that I am the boss. That they're lucky to have me there. That they're just one step above pond scum and that they're not even worthy to breath my waste. J: That is funny. R: That's the attitude you have to have. They respect that. Treat them like the animals that they know they are. I really dislike the media tremendously. 11"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"J: Okay well now, when you go on stage do you honestly believe that you are much better than everyone else. R: I believe I'm much brighter and I believe I know my subject matter much better than they do. J: Okay, in that context, R: Yes. J: Okay. R: Outside the studio no, I don't believe that. No, I don't. J: Well how could, how should one apply that to their own everyday life and becoming successful as an entrepreneur and just as a person in general? R: It's a weird mindset. Because on the one hand, you have to take on that role, when you're in the public eye if you want attention. But on the other side of the cover you have to be, in your real life, you have to be genuinely open to feedback. I'm incredibly open to feedback. One of the things that entrepreneurs have to look out for, and this is another mental blind spot is ego. You cannot let your ego get in the way. Your dedication has to be providing the best service or the best product that you've got. And in order to do that, you have to realize no matter how bright you are, you can't see the entire solution, In my courses and for fear of offending your listeners we can't really discuss the content, but what I will tell you is I invite my students to get up on stage and teach. I am incredibly open to feedback. If my students can show me a better way of doing things, I will say right up on stage this student figured out a better way to do this technique. Give him a big hand let's bring him up, he figured out something better than I did. If you're really devoted to finding answers, if you're really devoted to making a difference, you've got to put your ego aside and only take credit where credit is due and actively seek out and reward the contributions of other people. You must, I cannot emphasize this enough. Whether it's in finding technical solutions, creative solutions or if it's just dealing with your staff. You must encourage genuine feedback, even the criticism that seems to really insult you at first. That's probably the criticism that actually contains the most content that you have to pay attention to. It's the concept of what I call personal blasphemy. And personal blasphemy has nothing to do with anything religious. It has to do with an idea that's so contrary to what you think is true about what you're doing that your ears can't hear it. Because it's precisely in those moments that no matter how obnoxious it may be offered, that you may be offered a gem that you really need to pay attention to. I remember years ago when I was a former comedy writer and someone said you know you shouldn't be writing comedy you should be a teacher. And I got furious with him but they were right okay? What they suggested I teach was not what I'm teaching now but the point is this, if you relay want to be successful, yeah, when you're a showman you have to be larger than life. You have to be a little arrogant. But when it gets down to making decisions, you've got to be open to feedback. You've got to let your market tell you what it is they want. J: Do you think most people are closed minded or open-minded? R: Very closed-minded. Most people, you see the thing is this Joe. I learned something, which is, I have pretty good intuition. But it's intuition honed by years 12"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"of scintillating, astonishing failure. You've got to be open to making mistakes. And you've gotta realize the only way to get good at something is to really be lousy at it. In fact now that I've got pretty good mastery of what I do in my business, I seek out things that I really suck at. I'm not the most physically coordinated person in the world. J: I would agree. R: Well so now I seek out things that are difficult for me. I just learned to scuba dive. Now I was the only person to flunk out of the group class. I had to take individual lessons. There's a thirteen-year-old girl in the class who was kicking my butt. I'm serious, I had to take personal, individual lessons. But you know what? I loved it. I thought wait a minute, this is really forcing me to learn how I can learn better. Forcing me to learn how I can learn in conditions of extreme stress. I seek out and embrace things that I suck at because to me that's the mindset you have to have if you're really gonna be successful. So you gotta be open to feedback. You've gotta be willing to embrace uncertainty. And you've gotta realize the only way to learn things is to screw it up. You've gotta give yourself permission to screw up. I do everything I can to avoid screw-ups. I try to make sure that I have good judgment, which is one of the things I want to talk about next. But you know what? You're gonna make mistakes. And the people you work with are gonna make mistakes. And you just have to learn, you get to the point where at first you tolerate it and then you get to the point where you kind of like it. And then it gets to the point where hey it's a kick, I don't mind screwing up. But let's screw up in a different and unusual way. I don't want to repeat mistakes. That's when you get into trouble. J: Well for everyone that may be listening to this that may have been in business or multiple businesses for long periods of time and have not obtained any sense of their definition of success, any large amount of money, any personal satisfaction, what would you say to them? R: I'd say a couple of things. First of all, they probably haven't failed enough. Or they haven't paid attention to the feedback from the failure. Or they haven't failed in different ways. If you keep failing in the same way then it's like digging a rut for yourself. Go out and fail in new and interesting ways. That's the first thing. And here's the second thing. This is a paradox. The closer you get, the closer you get to the skill level you need to really succeed, the more frustrating it's gonna seem. Because you're gonna be getting closer and you're gonna be presented with opportunities you couldn't get even close to before. But you're not gonna have enough skill to complete it. The illustration I guess we can use is Jeff Paul. Jeff Paul when he went to Dan Kennedy, I remember Dan Kennedy saying all he had to tweak was one or two things. Jeff was one or two things away from being successful. Do you remember that? J: Yes. R: But I'm sure for Jeff that was the height of his frustration cause he knew he was doing so many things right. He was doing a lot of things right but he still wasn't seeing the results. So what I want to say to people if you're feeling, if you're feeling really defeated after years of struggle and you still haven't made it work kill yourself because there's too many people in the world. No, seriously, J: You are a demented individual. 13"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"R: Joe, you'll cut that out. What I'll say to people that have been struggling and they still haven't gotten the level of success they want, you're close. Because the closer you get to all the skills you need to really be successful, the more frustration you're gonna get. Because you're gonna be presented with opportunities you didn't have before. Let me use a metaphor if I could. Let's say you're born without legs okay? You can't even walk. All of a sudden you wake up one morning and oh my God, you've got legs. Well all of a sudden you're gonna be presented with challenges you didn't have before. You're gonna be walking up hill. You may be climbing steps and getting winded. You're gonna be put in situations that are completely unfamiliar and so it's gonna feel like you're completely out of control until you get your legs under you and really being to learn how to move in a natural way. END OF SIDE ONE R: And the other thing I'll say about if you're getting close and you still haven't quite gotten where you want to go, what you may need to do is find better people on your team. There's no way, as egotistical as I am about what I'm doing, there's no possible way that I could have the success that I'm enjoying today without the people I have on my team. I couldn't do it. I'm lucky enough where all I have to do is what I love. I create all the products. I write all the ads. I teach all the seminars. My business partner loves doing all the stuff that I hate. He loves keeping the books. He loves filling orders. He loves running the printing presses. He loves that. You couldn't pay me enough money to do that. You couldn't put a gun to my head and make me that do that. So it may be that you're just missing some people on your team that you need to have there. And by the way, this is one of the reasons why I believe in constant, continuing education. One of the biggest blind spots that any person can have is the belief that you're gonna learn in school what you need to learn to really be successful in the world. I think the notion that education is a scarce resource that can only be doled out at some government institution, is unbelievably destructive. I remember being at UCLA back in the late '70's early '80's and there were protesters fighting over whether they should have a scholarship program for a certain ethnic group. And a different ethnic group was saying no, the money should go to us. And I remember raising my hand and said excuse me, why are you all accepting the notion that education is something that has to be doled out to you by this institution? I'm learning all the time. And of course they, suddenly both racial groups came together and hated me, so I ran like hell and got outta there. I would strongly urge everyone, no matter how much you think you know, keep investing in your education. And do it from people who already have success. Joe I spend, I can't even calculate how much money I spend every year on reading books on self-improvement, getting tape courses on self- improvement. I don't spend money on the lectures cause generally speaking I'm pretty well known in that circuit so I get invited for free. I would have no problem paying for it, even if I did. In the beginning I did pay for it. In the beginning when I was working as a paralegal and really fairly broke, any money I did have went for marketing programs. It went for seminars. J: Yeah some people will say to me I have no money and I want to get more successful in business. What type of advertising should 1 spend it on? And if they're people that do not have any type of understanding of marketing background, my suggestion is you got money and you want to be more successful go buy some books and read and learn from others. 14"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"R: Learn from people who already are doing it. Seriously you will learn, I think anyone who really wants to make money in the world of marketing, if they had a choice between seriously, between going to a three year MBA program at Harvard or getting your Super Star Audio Tapes Series, to me it's a slam dunk choice, you go to Harvard, don't be an idiot. But if it's anything other than Harvard, no I'm teasing. I would get your tapes in a heartbeat. Because it's from people who know what they're doing. Pick models of people who are already successful and constantly, and the other thing I have to say is stretch yourself. You must stretch yourself. Find things that are difficult for you to do. If I, as a clumsy, uncoordinated dork from Gardena can learn, Gardena, California can learn to rock climb. By the way it took me four months of lessons three times a week to get the basics of rock climbing. I'm talking about just where to put my foot, how to swing my hips, literally there were five year old kids on Mommy and me day. I would go in on Mommy and me day cause I didn't want adults to see how crappy I am and these kids would be flying past me on the wall and going Mommy what's wrong with that man? I'm serious but I loved it. I would laugh when I would see the difference in my skill level and the difference in the skill level in my instructor. Instead of getting discouraged I laughed hysterically at how much I had to learn. J: Well you've actually learned how to channel things that would normally totally discourage people to the point to where they wouldn't take it on and you turn it into a positive thing. How does somebody in their mind do that? What is the strategy, you mentioned earlier, R: You want to know something? Now here's where we get into some really weird stuff. I've always believed, since the age of five that I was put here for a purpose. I've always believed that. Even in the days when I worked unbelievably boring, crappy jobs to support myself as a writer, which was a failed career but then again I use those skills as a marketer. Even then I always knew, I always thought to myself you know what? This is not your destiny. You're meant to contribute something. You're meant to make a difference. So first and foremost, you have to have a passion. You have to have a sense of purpose that says I may not know what it is, I may have to keep struggling to find it. But dammit, I know I have a purpose and I will not live a mediocre life. I have to tell you a big part of my success is that tacit refusal to give up and what it is is I can remember distinctly thinking this. Distinctly thinking I don't care what it takes, I will not live a mediocre life. When it comes time for me to go, I want to be able to look back and go I made a tremendous difference. You really have to have that kind of drive: At first, I think it's based on a no. It's based on saying no I will not settle. I will not live a mediocre life. I will not be a sheep. I don't care what it takes. You have to have the power of no. You have to creatively constructively channel that power of no. I remember when I was nineteen years old. I was terrified of women, could not talk to a woman. And I decided one summer I had a moment of awakening. And I thought to myself, I don't care if I die in the process I will not be a prisoner of fear. I remember thinking that, I will not be a prisoner of fear. I went out to the shopping malls and I spent all summer talking to any woman I could. Now often times all I could do was get up the courage to blurt hello before I ran and I threw up, I was that nervous. But by the end of summer I had conquered my fear. And when you walk through the world and you've conquered a fear it radiates off you. People know there's something different about you. And that came from a refusal. It came from my dogged determined refusal to be a prisoner of fear. And so one of the things you have to. do if you really want to move forward is you have to channel creatively, constructively channel the power of no. You must refuse to give up. You must refuse to be a prisoner of fear. You have to refuse to live a mediocre life. 15"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"J: Very good advice. R: Eventually what happens is you start out with that negative and then you start to get to enjoy the unknown and pretty soon you get addicted to it. So now 1 embrace things that I'm lousy at. I love it. And by the way if you're a single person this makes you very attractive to the opposite sex. If you have that devil may care of I don't care if I screw up, it makes you a very attractive person. It gives you charisma. I think one of the secrets of being charismatic is that you've overcome your fears and you embrace the things that other people run from. J: Yes, yes. At my boot camps where I've had you speak a couple of times and you've always been a very big hit. And of course there's always a few people that you're not everyone's cup of tea because you, R: Yeah, but you need more cute women to get me to some of these boot camps Joe. J: Well unfortunately the majority of the people tend to be men. R: Although that Jim Wolverton guy has got a cute butt, J: Yes he does. He's got a very fine butt. R: Jim call me. There's that one night of passion and I never hear from you. J: What I was gonna say is do you believe that some people just can not lead something other than a mediocre life? R: Yes, yes I do. Joe, it's not a function of intelligence although making good decisions is important. One of these days we should do a tape on making smart decisions. Because you can be enthusiastic all you like. If you make dumb decisions you're gonna fail. Some people I think are basically born to be sheep. Because they don't have willingness. Now I didn't say will. Will is important but you must also have willingness. And willingness means that basically willingness is more of a relaxed acceptance that yes you're gonna pay a price. Yes, you're gonna take some pain. Yeah, you're gonna hurt on occasion. And yeah you're gonna fall on your face. Yeah occasionally you're gonna be embarrassed. But you're willing to do it. Instead of steeling yourself and making yourself all tense and building armor you relax and you go okay I'm willing to take some hits. I'm a big boy or girl. I can handle it. I accept the price of having a life that's not mediocre. The price of living a life that's not mediocre is you're gonna have uncertainty, you're gonna have people envious, you're gonna have people hate you. But you know what? You're gonna be alive for every second of it. You will be more alive than all the sheeple. You'll be alive when it hurts. You'll be alive when it feels good and it feels good a lot of the time. You'll be alive when people tell you hey you made a difference in my life. I wouldn't be were it not for you. Or I wouldn't be here in the way I am were it not for you. One time, the first time someone says to you, you changed my life and you look in their eyes and you know they mean it. They mean it and they can even tell you exactly what they did from your material to make the difference. Nothing else matters after that. It's like my mother said to me. She said, I talked to her about the pain of childbirth. I said I can't understand why you would go through this six times. After the first time I would've quit. She said you know 16"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"what? It hurts worse than anything you can imagine but the minute they placed you in my arms, I forgot all the pain. J: I would imagine in your case, your mother would just become a downhill experience from that point on. R: I know. In my case, my mom is probably lying. No, what my mom probably meant to say was the minute they placed you in my arms the pain really started. You've got to have willingness. And that's not the same as will. Will is like G. Gordon Liddy holding his hand over the flame and not feeling the pain. That's not what I'm talking about. Will is important but willingness is even more important. Willingness is an open armed embracing of the consequences and the price you're gonna pay for doing what you do. J: Now I tend to believe that the majority of success and anything worth accomplishing you're gonna have to conquer certain mountains. You're gonna have to overcome fear. You're going to have to put up with exertion. In many cases no pain, no gain. However are there, in terms of the way that you've developed your mind set and stuff, do successful things come to you more easily or is there always difficulty and hardship to overcome? R: I think success gets easier, I really do. And on the other side of the cover you always want to stretch the limits of what you can do. I think it does get easier because you get mastery of some of the skills. And what you used to have to struggle with you can do easier. If asked you to knock out a great sales letter you could do it much faster than four years ago cause you just master the fundamentals. So it gets easier. But you're always gonna have a little trouble. You're always gonna have a little tsuris as we say in Yiddish. Like right now I'm involved in a lawsuit. I'm the plaintiff and I'm kicking butt but it's still tsuris. It's taking my focus. I've spent 40000 dollars so far. There're are other things I'd rather be doing. And when you're in business you're gonna have some troubles. That's just the way it goes. But listen I would much rather do this than work for somebody else. The alternative is ghastly to me, to work for somebody else. So to be successful I think you have to number one, know that you can't go anywhere else. You can't work for somebody else. That's not in as an option. And you've also gotta love what you do. You have those two things, you'll get through anything. J: Yep, you're right. Well Ross, we're running out of time. I'd like to wrap up with any famous last words you'd like to leave the listeners with. R: I would tell people pain into passion, sorrow into solutions. If you can implement that for yourself and for other people there's no limit to how successful you're . gonna be. You'll meet some wonderful people on the way and you'll have a great time. And you'll have the gift of being able to say when it all comes to an end, hey I made a difference and I loved every minute of it, even the difficult times. J: Yep, very good. Well as usual it's always entertaining and very thought provoking and very useful to listen to you. And to the listeners let me know what you thought of the interview with Ross. I do these to help you improve your thinking, improve your successes as an entrepreneur. If you'd like me to do another interview with Ross, he will be more than willing to do it because I have done a lot of stuff with him and he's spoken at the boot camps and we even did a video.

Take a giant step forward into this place 3. Imagine a time in your life when you just knew something wonderful was going to happen and anything is possible.(This is about a sense of excited anticipation of something G-R-E-A-T!) 4. Imagine this feeling as a shape, or a color, figure, character, ball of energy, etc outside of the circle. Use whatever you can to give this reality, FOR YOU. If you want to also represent it with a sound that you resonate to, OUT LOUD, that is also fine. You can also use a cartoon character, a character from the movies, books, comic books, a dream, a god or goddess that appropriate represents this energy FOR YOU. 5. Look at this and command(hot ask, but COMMAND) it to remain outside the circle and send its energy into you for the successful completion of this process. 6..

Extend your right hand, palm facing downward. Imagine the circle getting smaller and brighter as it moves toward your extended hand. As it gets closer to your hand and smaller and brighter, see it move toward the third finger of your right hand and slip onto that finger, forming a ring that you can feel on that finger, or, alternatively, if you have rings on other fingers on that hand, let it move onto whatever ring you feel it right for you. 15.

A Bro who has been into SS for about 4-5 years now but STILL has not used it to close with as much as ONE woman emailed me about how stuck he was. Here is the response I sent him. Please use this method ONLY if you have had NO results and feel something very powerful has been holding you back. This does NOT apply to most Bros. Here is the relevant text of what I sent him: Here is what is going on with you: At some point, in your life, you made a DECISION, at a deeply powerful level of the mind, a DECISION about the kinds of relationships and results you deserved to have with women. That decision shaped what you could do...how you thought..what you could perceive and WHAT RESULTS THE UNIVERSE COULD BRING TO YOU. That decision was SO deeply made and in such a powerfully altered state, it constituted a PRAYER...a PRAYER to your Higher Self to create a reality that you would go through and experience. This is why with ALL your exposure to the tools, you have never ACTUALLY used them to get the full results...that would run COUNTER to the \"prayer\" you sent up with full belief Printed for Ross Jeffries <sandworm@mediaone.net>"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Ross Jeffries, 12/18/99 11:24 AM -0800, To those Bros who still are DEEPLY s that your Higher Self has consistently made manifest. The \"prayer\" was, \"I deserve ALMOST success with women....NOT QUITE success...but I can NEVER get there because I am a bad person who would abuse this power. THIS is who I am and THIS is what I will always have with women\" . Now, I know that CONSCIOUSLY, this is NOT what you set out to do. But when we reach deep inside, and decide what our reality will be, it opens a channel to the \"High Self\" and says, \"this is what I believe, without doubt, will happen.\" Do you remember what Jesus said about, \"Whatever you ask for in prayer, without doubt, will be given to you?\" Well, that is what you INADVERTENTLY did. Here is how to change this. First, realize that according to the Hawaiian system of prayer called Huna, we have a High, Middle and Low Self. These correspond to the SuperConscious, the Conscious and Unconscious Minds. Prayer, properly done, consists of this: 1. The Middle self(conscious) forms an image of what it wants. 2.
