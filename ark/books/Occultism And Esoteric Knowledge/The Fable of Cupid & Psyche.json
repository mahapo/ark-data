In the introduc- tion, Taylor summarizes the intent of the work as follows: \"Is it not therefore most probable that the in- tention of the author in this work was to show that the man who gives himself to a voluptuous life, becomes a beast, and that it is only by becoming virtuous and religious, that he can divest himself of the brutal na- ture, and be again a man? For this is the rose by eat- ing which Apuleius was restored to the human, and cast off the brutal form; and, like the moly of Hermes, preserved him in future from the dire enchantments of Circe, the Goddess of Sense.\" In the same introduction Taylor also notes: \"The most important parts how- ever of The Metamorphosis, viz. the fable of Cupid and Psyche, and the eleventh book, in which Apuleius gives an account of his being initiated in the mysteries of Isis and Osiris, are not derived from any sources with which we are at present acquainted.\" The Fable of Cupid and Psyche here reproduced ap- peared as a separate volume twenty-seven years earlier in 1795.

In the fable Eros, or Cupid, is introduced as the Di- vine Principle in man and Psyche as the human soul. By rearranging the letters of the word \"Eros\" they become rose, thus forming a direct association with the sacred rose which restored Apuleius to human form. This is the flower that grew in the secret garden of the Troubadours and is prominently displayed in the mys- tical diagrams of the alchemists. It is also the crucified rose of the Rosicrucians where it signifies the Messiah as the embodiment of the infinite love of God and the mystery of the cleansing blood. In the Bible there is reference to the Rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys, and in Hermetic philosophy these represent the union of the Sun and Moon in the preparation of the universal medicine. Thus it appears that the entire classical concept of redemption is arcanely set forth in The Fable of Cupid and Psyche. The badge of the Order of the Garter includes a multi-petalled rose and the motto: \"Honi soit qui mal y pense\" (Evil to him who evil thinks). The morality of this fable is profound and exalted. Sacred and profane love are contrasted and those inner parts of human nature associated with this mystery are beautifully explained. As the plot of the story develops it is obvious that the supporting philosophical doctrines are derived from the secret teachings of the Mystery Schools.

The human being must sometime face the challenge of his own spiritual needs; by puri- fying his own emotions he preserves not only himself but the mortal world in which he lives.

In the third place, thofe powers of every mundane god, which are participated by the body fufpended from his nature, are called mundane; but thofe which are participated by his intellect, are cal- led fuper-rnundane , and the foul, while fubfi:8:ing in union with thefe fuper-mundane powers, is faid to be in the intelligible world; but when fhe wholly directs her attention to the mundane powcrs of her god, fhe is faid to defcend from the intelligible world, even while Iubfifting in the Heavens."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"[ vi ] Thus much being prernifed, let us proceed to the explanation of the fable: Pfyche, then, or foul, is de- fcribed as tranfcendantly beautiful; and this indeed is true of every hu- man foul, before it profoundly merges itfelf in the deftling folds of dark matter. In the next place, when Pfyche is reprefented as defcending from the fumrnit of a lofty mountain into a beautiful valley, this fignifies the defcent of the foul from the intel- ligible world into a mundane condi- tion of being, but yet without aban- doning its eflablifhment in the lIea- vens. Hence the palace which Pfyche beholds in the valley is, with great propriety, [aid to be r r a royal houfe, which was not raifed by human, but by divine, hands and art.\" The gems, too, on which Pfyche is [aid to have trod in every part of this palace, are evident! v Ivmbol ical of the flars.
