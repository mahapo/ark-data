The Chancellor of the A ∴ A ∴ views without satisfaction the practice of Probationers working together. A Probationer should work with his Neophyte, or alone. Breach of this rule may prove a bar to advancement. Some of the weaker brethren having found the postures in Liber E t oo difficult, the pitiful heart of the Præmonstrator of A ∴ A ∴ has been moved to authorise the publication of additional postures, which will be found facing this page.

Considerations before the Threshold . First concerning the choice of a particular Deity. This matter is of no import, sobeit that thou choose one suited to thine own highest nature. Howsoever, this method is not so suitable for gods austere as Saturn, or intellectual as Thoth. But for such deities as in themselves partake in anywise of love it is a perfect mode. 2. Concerning the prime method of this Magick Art. Let the devotee consider well that although Christ and Osiris be one, yet the former is to be worshipped with Christian, and the latter with Egyptian rites. And this, altho ugh the rites themselves are ceremonially equivalent. There should, however, be one symbol declaring the transcending of such limitations; and with regard to the Deity also, there should be some one affirmation of his identity both with all other simil ar gods of all other nations, and with the Supreme of whom all are but partial reflections. 3. Concerning the chief place of devotion . This is the Heart of the devotee, and should be symbolically represented"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 40 by that room or spot which he loves best. And t he dearest spot therein shall be the shrine of his temple. It is most convenient if this shrine and altar should be sequestered in woods, or in a private grove, or garden. But let it be protected from the profane. 4. Concerning the Image of the Deity. L et there be an image of the Deity; first, because in meditation there is mindfulness induced thereby; and second, because a certain power enters and inhabits it by virtue of the ceremonies; or so it is said, and We deny it not. Let this image be the mos t beautiful and perfect which the devotee is able to procure; or if he be able to paint or to carve the same, it is all the better. As for Deities with whose nature no Image is compatible, let them be worshipped in an empty shrine. Such are Brahma, and A llah. Also some post - captivity conceptions of Jehovah. 5. Further concerning the above . Let this shrine be furnished appropriately as to its ornaments, according to the book 777 . With ivy and pine - cones, that is to say, for Bacchus, and let lay before him both grapes and wine. So also for Ceres let there be corn, and cakes; or for Diana moon - wort and pale herbs, and pure water. Further, it is well to support the shrine with talismans of the planets, signs and elements appropriate. But these should be made accord - ing to the right Ingenium of the Philosophus by the light of the Book 777 during the course of his Devotions. It is also well, nevertheless, if a magick circle with the right signs and names be made beforehand. 6. Concerning the ceremonies . Le t the Philosophus prepare a powerful Invocation of the particular Deity, according to his Ingenium. But let it consist of these several parts: —"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"LIBER ASTARTÉ 41 First, an Imprecation, as of a slave unto his Lord. Second, an Oath, as of a vassal to his Liege. Third, a Memo rial, as of a child to his Parent. Fourth, an Orison, as of a Priest unto his God. Fifth, a Colloquy, as of a Brother with his Brother. Sixth, a Conjuration, as of a Friend with his Friend. Seventh, a Madrigal, as of a Lover to his Mistress. And mark well that the first should be of awe, the second of fealty, the third of dependence, the fourth of adoration, the fifth of confidence, the sixth of comradeship, the seventh of passion. 7. Further concerning the ceremonies . Let then this In - vocation be the princi pal part of an ordered ceremony. And in this ceremony let the Philosophus in no wise neglect the service of a menial. Let him sweep and garnish the place, sprinkling it with water or with wine as is appropriate to the particular Deity, and consecrating it with oil, and with such ritual as may seem him best. And let all be done with intensity and minuteness. 8. Concerning the period of devotion, and the hours thereof. Let a fixed period be set for the worship; and it is said that the least time is nine d ays by seven, and the greatest seven years by nine. And concerning the hours, liet the Ceremony be performed every day thrice, or at least once, and let the sleep of the Philosophus be broken for some purpose of devotion at least once in every night. Now to some it may seem best to appoint fixed hours for the ceremony, to others it may seem that the ceremony should be performed as the spirit moves them so to do: for this there is no rule."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 42 9. Concering the Robes and the Instruments . The Wand and Cup are to be chosen for this Art; never the Sword or Dagger, never the Pantacle, unless that Pantacle chance to be of a nature harmonious. But even so it is best to keep the Wand and Cup; and if one must choose, the Cup. For the Robes, that of a Philosophus, or that of an Adept Within is most suitable; or, the robe best fitted for the service of the particular Deity, as a bassara for Bacchus, a white robe for Vesta. So also, for Vesta, one might use for instrument the Lamp; or the sickle, for Chronos. 10. Concer ning the Incense and Libations. The incense should follow the nature of the particular Deity; as, mastic for Mercury, dittany for Persephone. Also the libations, as, a decoction of nightshade for Melancholia, or of Indian hemp for Uranus. 11. Concerning t he harmony of the ceremonies . Let all these things be rightly considered, and at length, in language of the utmost beauty at the command of the Philosophus, accompanied, if he have skill, by music, and interwoven, if the particular Deity be jocund, with dancing. And all being carefully prepared and rehearsed, let it be practised daily until it be wholly rhythmical with his aspiration, and as it were, a part of his being. 12. Concerning the variety of the ceremonies . Now, seeing that every man differeth essentially from every other man, albeit in essence he is identical, let also these ceremonies assert their identity by their diversity. For this reason do We leave much herein to the right Ingenium of the Philosophus. 13 . Concerning the life of the devo tee . First, let his way of life be such as is pleasing to the particular Deity. Thus to"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"LIBER ASTARTÉ 43 invoke Neptune, let him go a - fishing; but if Hades, let him not approach the water that is hateful to Him. 14 . Further, concerning the life of the devotee . Let him cut away from his life any act, word, or thought, that is hateful to the particular Deity; as, unchastity in the case of Artemis, evasions in the case of Ares. Besides this, he should avoid all harshness or unkindness of any kind in thought, word, or d eed, seeing that above the particular Deity is One in whom all is One. Yet also may he deliberately practise cruelties, where the particular Deity manifests His love in that manner; as in the case of Kali, and of Pan. And there - fore, before the beginni ng of his period of devotion, let him practise according to the rules of Liber Jugorum. 15 . Further concerning the life of the devotee . Now, as many are fully occupied with their affairs, let it be known that this method is adaptable to the necessities o f all. And We bear witness that this which followeth is the Crux and Quintessence of the whole Method. First, if he have no Image, let him take anything soever, and consecrate it as an Image of his God. Likewise with his robes and instruments, his suffumi gations and libations: for his Robe hath he not a night - dress; for his instrument a walking - stick; for his suffumigations a burning match, for his libation a glass of water? But let him consecrate each thing that he useth to the service of that particular Deity, and not profane the same to any other use. 16 . Continuation . Next, concerning his time, if it be short. Let him labour mentally upon his Invocation, concentrating it, and let him perform this Invocation in his heart whenever"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 44 he hath the leisure. And let him seize eagerly upon every opportunity for this. 17 . Continuation. Third, even if he have leisure and preparation, let him seek ever to bring inward the symbols, so that even in his well - ordered shrine the whole ceremony revolve inwardly in his heart,. that is to say in the themple of his body, of which the outer temple is but an image. For in the brain is the shrine, and there is no Image therein; and the breath of man is the incense and the libation. 18 . Continuation . Further concerning occup ation. Let the devotee transmute within the alembic of his heart every thought, or word, or act into the spiritual gold of his devotion. As thus: eating. Let him say: “I eat this food in gratitude to my Deity that hath sent it to me, in order to gain s trength for my devotion to Him.” Or: sleeping. Let him say: “I lie down to sleep, giving thanks for this blessing from my Deity, in order that I may be refreshed for new devotion to Him.” Or: reading. Let him say: “I read this book that I may study the n ature of my Deity, that further knowledge of Him may inspire me with deeper devotion to Him.” Or: working. Let him say: “I drive my spade into the earth that fresh flowers (fruit, or what not) may spring up to His glory, and that I, purified by toil, may give better devotion to Him.” Or, whatever it may be that he is doing, let him reason it out in his mind, drawing it through circumstance and circumstance to that one end and conclusioon of the matter. And let him not perform the act until he hath done th is."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"LIBER ASTARTÉ 45 As it is written: Liber VII . cap. v. — 22. “Every breath, every word, every thought, is an act of love with thee. 23. “The beat of my heart is the pendulum of love. 24. “The songs of me are the soft sighs: 25. “The thoughts of me are very rapture: 26. “And my deeds are the myriads of Thy children, the stars and the atoms.” And Remember Well, that if thou wert in truth a lover, all this wouldst thou do of thine own nature without the slightest flaw or failure in the minutest part thereof. 19 . Concerning the Lections . L et the Philosophus read solely in his copies of the holy books of Thelema, during the whole period of his devotion. But, if he weary, let him read books which have no part whatever in love, as for recreation. But let him copy out each verse of Thelema whi ch bears upon this matter, and ponder them, and comment thereupon. For therein is a wisdom and a magic too deep to utter in any other wise. 20 . Concerning the Meditations . Herein is the most potent method of attaining unto the End, for him who is thorou ghly prepared, being purified by the practice of the Transmutation of deed into devotation, and consecrated by the right performance of the holy ceremonies. Yet herein is danger, for that the Mind is fluid as quicksilver, and bordereth upon the Abyss, and is beset by many direns and devils that seduce and attack it to destroy it. Therefore let the devotee beware, and precise accurately his meditations, even as a man should build a canal from sea to sea. 21 . Continuation. Let then the Philosophus mediate upon"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 46 all love that hath ever stirred him. There is the love of David and of Jonathan, and the love of Abraham and Isaac, and the love of Lear and Cordelia, and the love of Damon and Pythias, and the love of Sappho and Atthis, and the love of Romeo and J uliet, and the love of Dante and Beatrice, and the love of Paolo and Francesca, and the love of Cæsar and Lucrezia Borgia, and the love of Aucassin and Nicolette, and the love of Daphnis and Chloe, the love of Cornelia and Caius Gracchus, and the love of Bacchus and Ariadne, and the love of Cupid and Psyche, and the love of Endymion and Artemis, and the love of Demeter and Persephone, and the love of Venus and Adonis, and the love of Lakshmi and Vishnu, and the love of Siva and Bhavani, and the love of Bu ddha and Ananda, and the love of Jesus and John, and many more. Also there is the love of many saints for their particular deity, as of St Francis of Assisi for Christ, of Sri Sabhapaty Swami for Maheswara, of Abdullah Haju Shirazi for Allah, of St Ignatiu s Loyola for Mary, and many more. Now do thou take one such story every night, and enact it in thy mind, grasping each identity with infinte care and zest, and do thou figure thyself as one of the lovers and thy Deity as the other. Thus do thou pass throu gh all adventures of love, not omitting one; and to each do thou conclude: How pale a reflection is this of my love for this Deity! Yet from each shalt thou draw some knowledge of love, some intimacy with love, that shall aid thee to perfect thy love. Thu s learn the humility of love from one, its obedience from another, its intensity from a third, its purity from a fourth, its peace from yet a fifth."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"LIBER ASTARTÉ 47 So then thy love being made perfect, it shall be worthy of that perfect love of His. 22 . Further concernin g meditation. Moreover, let the Philosophus imagine to himself that he hath indeed succeeded in his devotion, and that his Lord hath appeared to him, and that they converse as may be fitting. 23 . Concerning the Mysterious Triangle . Now then as three cor ds separately may be broken by a child, while those same cords duly twisted may bind a giant, let the Philosophus learn to entwine these three methods of Magic into a Spell. To this end let him understand that as they are One, because the end is One, so ar e they One because the method is One, even the method of turning the mind toward the particular Deity by love in every act. And lest thy twine slip, here is a little cord that wrappeth tightly round and round all, even the Mantram or Continuous Prayer. 24 . Concerning the Mantram or Continuous Prayer. Let the Philsophus weave the name of the Particular Deity into a sentence short and rhythmical; as, for Artemis: 'epelqon 'epelqon 'Artemij , for Shiva: Nama Shivaya namaha Aum; or, for Mary, Ave Maria; or, f or Pan, caire Swthr kosmou 'Iw Pan 'Iw Pan ; or, for Allah: Hua Allahu alazi lailaha illa hua. Let him repeat this day and night without cessation mechanically in his brain, which is thus made ready for the Advent of that Lord, and armed against all other. 25 . Concerning the Active and the Passive . Let the Philosophus change from the active love of his particular Deity to a state of passive awaiting, even almost a repulsion, the repulsion not of distaste, but of a sublime modesty."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 48 As it is written, Liber L XV . ii. 59 . I have called unto Thee, and I have journeyed unto Thee, and it availed me not. 60. I waited patiently, and Thou wast with me from the beginning. Then let him change back to the Active, until a veritable rhythm is established between the state s, as it were the swinging of a Pendulum. But let him reflect that a vast intelligence is required for this; for he must stand as it were almost without himself to watch those phases of himself. And to do this a high Art, and pertaineth not altogether t o the grade of Philosophus. Neither is it of itself helpful, but rather the reverse, in this especial practice. 26 . Concerning Silence . Now there may come a time in the course of this practice when the outward symbols of devotion cease, when the soul is as it were dumb in the presence of its God. Mark that this is not a cessation, but a transmutation of the barren seed of prayer into the green shoot of yearning. This yearning is spontaneous, and it shall be left to grow, whether it be sweet or bitter . For often times it is as the torment of hell in which the soul burns and writhes unceasingly. Yet it ends, and at its end continue openly thy Method. 27 . Concerning Dryness . Another state wherein at times the soul may fall is this dark night. And t his is indeed purifying in such depths that the soul cannot fathom it. It is less like pain than like death. But it is the necessary death that comes before the rising of a body glorified. This state must be endured with fortitude; and no means of allevi ating it may be employed. It may be broken up by the breaking up of the whole Method, and a return to the world without. This cowardice not only destroys the value"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"LIBER ASTARTÉ 49 of all that has gone before, but destroys the value of the Oath of Fealty that thou hast sworn, and makes thy Will a mockery to men and gods. 28 . Concerning the Deceptions of the Devil . Note well that in this state of dryness a thousand seductions will lure thee away; also a thousand means of breaking thine oath in spirit without breaking i t in letter. Against this thou mayst repeat the words of thine oath aloud again and again until the temptation be overcome. Also the devil will represent to thee that it were much better for this operation that thou do thus and thus, and seek to affright thee by fears for thy health or thy reason. Or he may send against thee visions worse than madness. Against all this there is but one remedy, the Discipline of thine Oath. So then thou shalt go through ceremonies meaningless and hideous to thee, and blasp heme shalt thou against thy Deity and curse Him. And this mattereth little, for it is not thou, so be that thou adhere to the Letter of thine Obligation. For thy Spiritual Sight is closed, and to trust it is to be led unto the precipice, and hurled there from. 29 . Further of this matter . Now also subtler than all these terrors are the Illusions of Success. For one instant’s self - satisfaction or Expansion of the Spirit, especially in this state of dryness, and thou art lost. For thou mayst attain to the False Union with the Demon himself. Beware also of even the pride which rises from having resisted the temptations. But so many and so subtle are the wiles of Choronzon that the whole world could not contain their enumeration. The answer to one and all i s the persistence in the literal fulfilment of the routine. Beware, then, last, of that devil who"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 50 shall whisper in thine ear that the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life, and answer: Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth a lone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. Yet shalt thou also beware of disputation with the devil, and pride in the cleverness of thine answers to him. Therefore, if thou hast not lost the power of silence, let it be first and last employed aga inst him. 30 . Concerning the Enflaming of the Heart . Now learn that these methods are dry one and all. Intellectual exercises, moral exercises, they are not Love. Yet as a man, rubbing two dry sticks together for long, suddenly found a spark, so also from time to time will true love leap unasked into thy meditation. Yet this shall die and be reborn again and again. It may be that thou hast no tinder near. In the end shall come suddenly a great flame and a devouring, and burn thee utterly. Now of thes e sparks, and of these splutterings of flame, and of these beginnings of the Infinite Fire, thou shalt thus be aware. For the sparks thy heart shall leap up, and thy ceremony or meditation or toil shall seem of a sudden to go of its own will; and for the little flames this shall be increased in volume and intensity; and for the beginnings of the Infinite Fire thy ceremony shall be caught up unto ravishing song, and thy meditation shall be ecstasy, and thy toil shall be a delight exceeding all pleasure thou hast ever known. And of the Great Flame that answereth thee it may not be spoken; for therein is the End of this Magick Art of Devotion. 31 . Considerations with regard to the use of symbols . It is"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"LIBER ASTARTÉ 51 to be noted that persons of powerful imagination, will, and intelligence have no need of these material symbols. There have been certain saints who are capable of love for an idea as such without it being otherwise than degraded by idolising it, to use this word in its true sense. Thus one may be impassione d of beauty, without even the need of so small a concretion of it as “the beauty of Apollo,” “the beauty of roses,” “the beauty of Attis.” Such persons are rare; it may be doubted whether Plato himself attained to any vision of absolute beauty without at taching to it material objects in the first place. A second class is able to contemplate ideals through this veil; a third class needs a double veil, and cannot think of the beauty of a rose without a rose before them. For such is this Method of most us e; yet let them know that there is this danger therein, that they may mistake the gross body of the symbol for the idea made concrete thereby. 32 . Considerations of further danger to those not purged of material thought . Let it be remembered that in th e nature of the love itself is danger. The lust of the satyr for the nymph is indeed of the same nature as the affinity of Quicklime for water on the one hand, and of the love of Ab for Ama on the other; so also is the triad Osiris, Isis, Horus like that of a horse, mare, foal, and of red, blue, purple. And this is the foundation of Correspondences. But it were false to say “Horus is a foal” or “Horus is purple.” One may say “Horus resembles a foal in this respect, that he is the offspring of two complem entary beings.” 33 . Further of this matter . So also many have said truly that all is one, and falsely that since earth is That One, and"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 52 ocean is That One, therefore earth is ocean. Unto Him good is illusion, and evil is illusion; therefore good is evil. By this fallacy of logic are many men destroyed. Moreover, there are those who take the image for the God; as who should say, my heart is in Tiphareth, and an Adeptus is in Tiphereth; I am therefore an adept. And in this practice the worst danger is this , that the love which is its weapon should fail in one of two ways. First, if the love lack any quality of love, so long is it not ideal love. For it is written of the Perfected One: “There is no member of my body which is not the member of some god.” Th erefore let not the Philosophus despise any form of love, but harmonise all. As it is written: Liber LXI. 32 : “For Perfection abideth not in the Pinnacles, or in the Foundations, but in the ordered Harmony of one with all.” Second, if any part of this lo ve exceed, there is disease therein. As, in the love of Othello for Desdemona, love's jealousy overcame love's tenderness, so may it be in this love of a particular Deity. And this is more likely, since in this divine love no element may be omitted. It i s by virtue of this completeness that no human love may in any way attain to more than to forthshadow a little part thereof. 34 . Concerning Mortifications . These are not necessary to this method. On the contrary, they may destroy the concentration, as c ounter - irritants to, and so alleviations of, the supreme mortification which is the Absence of the Deity invoked. Yet as in mortal love arises a distaste for food, or a pleasure in things naturally painful, this perversion should be endured"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"LIBER ASTARTÉ 53 and allowed to take its course. Yet not to the interference with natural bodily health, whereby the instrument of the soul might be impaired. And concerning sacrifices for love’s sake, they are natural to this Method, and right. But concerning voluntary privations and t ortures, without use save as against the devotee, they are generally not natural to healthy natures, and wrong. For they are selfish. To scourge one's self serves not one's master; yet to deny one's self bread that one's child may have cake is the act of a true mother. 35 . Further concerning Mortifications . If thy body, on which thou ridest, be so disobedient a beast that by no menas will he travel in the desired direction, or if thy mind be baulkish and eloquent as Balaam's fabled Ass, then let the pra ctice be abandoned. Let the shrine be covered in sackcloth, and do thou put on habits of lamentation and abide alone. And do thou return most austerly to the practice of Liber Jugorum, testing thyself by a standard higher than that hitherto accomplished, and punishing effractions with a heavier goad. Nor do thou return to thy devotion until that body and mind are tamed and trained to all manner of peaceable going. 36 . Concerning minor methods adjuvant in the ceremonies. I. Rising on the planes . By thi s method mayst thou assist the imagination at the time of concluding thine Invocation. Act as taught in Liber O, by the light of Liber 777 . 37 . Concerning minor methods adjuvant in the ceremonies. II. Talismanic magic . Having made by thine Ingenium a t alisman or pantacle to represent the particular Deity, and"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 5 4 consecrated it with infinite love and care, do thou burn it ceremonially before the shrine, as if thereby giving up the shadow for the substance. But it is useless to do this unless thou do really in thine heart value the talisman beyond all else that thou hast. 38 . Concerning minor methods adjuvant in the ceremonies. III. Rehearsal . It may assist if the traditional history of the particular Deity be rehearsed before him; perhaps this is best don e in dramatic form. This method is the main one recommended in the “Exercitios Espirituales” of St Ignatius, whose work may be taken as a model. Let the Philosophus work out the legend of his own particular Deity, and apportioning days to events, live th at life in imagination, exercising the five senses in turn, as occasion arises. 39 . Concerning minor methods adjuvant in the ceremonies. IV. Duresse . This method consists in cursing a deity recalcitrant; as, threatening ceremonially “to burn the blood o f Osiris, and to grind down his bones to powder.” This method is altogether contrary to the spirit of love, unless the particular Deity be himself savage and relentless; as, Jehovah or Kali. In such a case the desire to perform constraint and cursing may be the sign of the assimilation of the spirit of the devotee with that of his God, and so an advance to the Union with Him. 40 . Concerning the value of this particular form of Union or Samadhi. All Samadhi is defined as the ecstatic union of subject and object in consciousness, with the result that a third thing arises which partakes in no way of the nature of the two. It would seem at first sight that it is of no importance"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"LIBER ASTARTÉ 55 whatever to choose an object of meditation. For example, the Samadhi called Atm adarshana might arise from simple concentration of the thought on an imagined triangle, or on the heart. But as the union of two bodies in chemistry may be endothermic or exothermic, the combination of Oxygen with Nitrogen is gentle, while that of Oxygen w ith Hydrogen is explosive; and as it is found that the most heat is disengaged as a rule by the union of bodies most opposite in character, and that the compound resulting from such is most stable, so it seems reasonable to suggest that the most important and enduring Samadhi results from the contemplation of the Object most opposite to the devotee. [On other planes, it has been suggested that the most opposed types make the best marriages and produce the healthiest children.

Even in mathematics, the greatest parallelogram is formed if the lines composing it are set at right angles. E D ] 41 . Conclusions from the foregoing. It may t hen be suggested to the Philosophus, that although his work will be harder his reward will be greater if he choose a Deity most remote from his own nature. This method is harder and higher than that of Liber E . For a simple object as there suggested is o f the same nature as the commonest things of life, while even the meanest Deity is beyond uninitiated human understanding. On the same plane, too, Venus is nearer to man than Aphrodite, Aphrodite than Isis, Isis than Babalon, Babalon than Nuit. Let him de cide therefore according to his discretion on the"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 56 one hand and his aspiration on the other: and let not one outrun his fellow. 42 . Further concerning the value of this Method . Certain objections arise. Firstly, in the nature of all human love is illusion , and a certain blindness. Nor is there any true love below the Veil of the Abyss. For this reason We give this Method to the Philosophus, as the reflection of the Exempt Adept, who reflects the Magister Templi and the Magus. Let then the Philosophus at tain this method as a foundation of the higher Methods to be given to him when he attains those higher grades. Another objection lies in the partiality of this Method. This is equally a defect characteristic of the Grade. 43 . Concerning a notable danger o f Success. It may occur that owing to the tremendous power of the samadhi , overcoming all other memories as it should and does do, that the mind of the devotee may be obsessed, so that he declare his particular Deity to be sole God and Lord. This error h as been the foundation of all dogmatic religions, and so the cause of more misery than all other errors combined. The Philosophus is peculiarly liable to this because from the nature of the Method he cannot remain sceptical; he must for the time believe in his particular Deity. But let him ( 1 ) consider that this belief is only a weapon in his hands, ( 2 ) affirm sufficiently that his Deity is but an emanation or reflection or eidolon of a Being beyond him, as was said in Paragraph 2 . For if he fail herein, since man cannot remain permanently in Samadhi , the memorized Image in his mind will be degraded, and replaced by the corresponding Demon, to his utter ruin."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"LIBER ASTARTÉ 57 Therefore, after Success, let him not delight overmuch in his Deity, but rather busy himself wit h his other work, not permitting that which is but a step to become a goal. As it is written also, Liber CLXXXV : “remember that . . . Philosophy is the Equilibrium of him that is in the House of . . . Love.” 44 . Concerning secrecy, and the rites of Blood. During this practice it is most wise that the Philosophus utter no word concerning his working, as if it were a Forbidden Love that consumeth him. But let him answer fools according to their folly; for since he cannot conceal his love from his fellows, he must speak to them as they may understand. And as many Deities demand sacrifice, one of men, another of cattle, a third of doves, let these sacrifices be replaced by the true sacrifices in thine own heart. Yet if thou must symbolize them outwardly for the hardness of thine heart, let thine own blood, and no other's, be spilt before that altar. 1 Nevertheless, forget not that this practice is dangerous, and may cause the manifestation of evil things, hostile and malicious, to thy great hurt. 45 . Concerni ng a further sacrifice . Of this it shall be understood that nothing is to be spoken; nor need anything be spoken to him that hath wisdom to comprehend the number of the paragraph. And this sacrifice is fatal beyond all, unless it be a sacrificium indeed. Yet there are those who have dared and achieved thereby. 46 . Concerning yet a further sacrifice .

( a ) Certain actio ns induce the flow of the breath through the right nostril (Pingala); and, conversely, the flow of the breath through Pingala induces certain actions.

This sweat is different in character from that customarily induced by exertion. If the Practitioner rub this sweat thorough ly into his body, he will greatly strengthen it. ( b )The tendency to perspiration will stop as the practice is continued, and the body become auto - matically rigid. Describe this rigidity with minute accuracy. ( c ) The state of automatic rigidity will deve lop into a state characterised by violent spasmodic move - ments of which the Practitioner is unconscious, but of whose result he is aware. This result is that the body hops gently from place to place. After the first two or three occurences of this ex perience Asana is not lost.

In order both to economize his time and to develop his pwoers, let the Zelator practise the deep full breathing which his prelimina ry exercises will have taught him during his walks. Let him repeat a sacred sentence (mantra) or let him count, in such a way that his footfall beats accurately with the rhythm thereof, as is done in dancing. Then let him practise Pranayama, at first wi thout the Kumbakham, and paying no attention to the nostrils otherwise than to keep them clear. Let him begin by an indrawing of the breath for 4 paces, and a breathing out for 4 paces. Let him increase this gradually to 6.6 , 8.8 , 12.12 , 16.16 , and 24. 24 , or more if he be able. Next let him practise in the proper proportion 4.8 , 6.12 , 8.16 , 12.24 and so on. Then, if he choose, let him recommence the series, adding a gradually increasing period of Kumbhakham. 7. Fourth practice . Following on this third practice, let him quicken his mantra and his pace, until the walk develops into a dance. This may also be practised with the ordinary waltz step, using a mantra in three - time, such as ™pelqon, ™pelqon, 'Artemij ; or I AO ; I AO S ABAO ; in such cases the practice may be combined with devotion to a particular deity; see Liber CLXXV.

Fifth practice . Let him practice mental concentration during the dance, and investigate the following statement: ( a ) The dance becomes independent of the will. ( b ) Similar phenomena to those described in 5 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) occur. ( c ) Certain important mental results occur. 9. A note concerning the depth and fullness of the breathing. In all proper expiration, the last possible portion of air should be expelled. In this the muscles of the throat, chest, ribs, and abdomen must be full y employed, and aided by pressing the upper arms into the flanks, and of the head into the thorax. In all proper inspiration, the last possible portion of air must be drawn into the lungs. In all proper holding of the breath, the body must remain absolutel y still. Ten minutes of such practice is ample to induce profuse sweating in any place of a temperature of 17° C. or over. The progress of the Zelator in acquiring a depth and fulness of breath should be tested by the respirometer. The exercises should be carefully graduated to avoid overstrain and possible damage to the lungs. This depth and fulness of breath should be kept as much as possible, even in the rapid exercises, with the exception of the sixth practice following. 10. Sixth practice . Let the Zelato r breathe as shallowly and rapidly as possible. He should assume the attitude of his moment of greatest expiration, and breathe only with the muscles of his throat. He may also practise lengthening the period between each shallow breathing."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"LIBER RV 65 (This may be combined when acquired with concentration on the Visuddhi chakra, i.e. let him fix his mind unwaveringly upon a point in the spine opposite the larynx.

At any stage of breathing let him suddenly hold the breath, enduring the need to breathe until it passes, returns, and passes again, and so on until consciousness is lost, either risin g into Samadhi or similar supernormal condition, or falling to oblivion. 13. Ninth practice . Let him practise the usual forms of Pranayama, but let Kumbhakham be used after instead of before expiration. Let him gradually increase the period of this Kumbhakh am as in the case of the other. 14. A note concerning the conditions of these experiments. The conditions favourable are dry and bracing air, a warm climate, absence of wind, absence of noise, insects, and all other disturbing influences, 1 a retired situation , simple food eaten in great moderation at the conclusion of the practices of morning and afternoon and on no account before practising. Bodily health is almost essential, and should be most care - fully guarded. (See Liber CLXXXV, Task of a Neophyte.) A diligent and tractable disciple, or the Practicus of the Zelator, should aid him in his work. Such a disciple should be noiseless, patients, vigilant, prompt, cheerful, of gentle manner and reverent to his master, intelligent to anticipate 1 Note that in the early stages of concentration of the mind, such annoyances become negligible.

With all this he should be fierce and terrible to strangers and all hostile influences, determined and vigo - rous, unceasingly vigilant, the guardian of the threshold. It is not desirable th at the Zelator should employ any other creature than a man, save in cases of necessity. Yet for some of these purposes a dog will serve, for others a woman. There are also others appointed to serve, but these are not for the Zelator. 15. Tenth practice . Let the Zelator experiment if he will with inhalations of oxygen, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and other gases mixed in small proportion with his air during his practices. These experiments are to be conducted with caution in the presence of a medical m an of experience, and they are only useful as facilitating a simulacrum of the results of the proper practices, and thereby enheartening the Zelator. 16. Eleventh practice . Let the Zelator at any time during the practices, especially during periods of Kumbha kham, throw his will utterly to ward his Holy Guardian Angel, directing his eyes inward and upward, and turning back his tongue as if to swallow it. (This latter operation is facilitated by severing the frænum linguæ, which, if done, should be done by a co metent surgeon. We do not advise this or any similar method of cheating difficulties. This is, however, harmless.) In this manner the practice is to be raised from the physical to the spiritual plane, even as the words Ruh, Ruach, Pneuma, Spiritus, Geist , Ghost, and indeed words of almost all languages, have been raised from their physical meaning of wind, air, breath, or movement, to the spiritual plane."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"LIBER RV 67 (RV is the old root meaning yoni, and hence Wheel (Fr. roue, Lat. rota, wheel), and the correspond ing Semitic root means “to go” Similarly Spirit is connected with “spiral.” — E D .) 17.

Let a magical circle be constructed, and within it an upright Tau drawn upon the ground. Let this Tau be divided into 10 squares (see Liber CMLXIII., Illustration 1 ). 1. Let the Magician be armed with the Sword of Art. 1 2. Let him wear the robe of a Neophyte. 3.

Standing at the edge of the circle, let him banish the 7 planets by appropria te rituals. Let him face the actual position of each planet in the heavens at the time of his working. 7. Let him further banish the twelve signs of the Zodiac by the appropriate rituals, facing each sign in turn. 8. Let him at each of these 24 banishings make three circuits widdershins, with the signs of Horus and Harpocrates in the East as he passes it. 9. Let him advance to the square of Malkuth in the Tau, and perform a ritual of banishing Malkuth. But here let him not leave the square to circumambulate the ci rcle, but use the formula and God - form of Harpocrates. 10. Let him advance in turn to the squares Jesod, Hod, Netzach, Tiphereth, Geburah, Chesed, and banish each by appropriate rituals. 11. And let him know that such rituals include the pronunciation of the appro priate names of God backwards, and also a curse against the Sephira in respect of all that which it is, for that it is that which distinguishes it and separates it from Kether. 12. Advancing to the squares of Binah and Chokmah in turn, let him banish these als o. And for that by now an awe and trembling shall have taken hold upon him, let him banish these by a supreme ritual of inestimable puissance. And let him beware exceedingly lest his will falter, or his courage fail. 13. Finally, let him, advancing to the sq uare of Kether,"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"LIBER TAV 97 banish that also by what means he may. At the end whereof let him set his foot upon the light, extinguishing it; 1 and, as he falleth, let him fall within the circle. SECOND METHOD 1. Let the Hermit be seated in his Asana, robed, and let him meditate upon every several part of his body until that part is so unreal to him that he no longer includes it in his comprehension of himself. For example, if it be his right foot, let him touch that foot and be alarmed, thinking, “A foot! What is this foot? Surely I am not alone in the Hermitage!” And this practice should be carried out not only at the time of meditation, but during the day’s work. 2. This meditation is to be assisted by reasoning; as, “This foot is not I. If I should lose my foot, I sh ould still be I. This foot is a mass of changing and decaying flesh, bone, skin, blood, lymph, etc., while I am the Unchanging and Immortal Spirit, uniform, not made, unbegotten, formless, left - luminous,” etc. 3. This practice being perfect for each part of the body, let him combine his workings until the whole body is thus understood as the non - Ego and illusion. 4. Let then the Hermit, seated in his Asana, meditate upon the Muladhara cakkra and its correspondence as a power of the mind, and destroy it in the sa me manner as aforesaid. Also by reasoning: “This emotion (memory, imagination, intellect, will, as it may be) is not I. This emotion is 1 If armed with wand and lamp, let him extinguish the light with his hand. — N."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 98 transient: I am immovable. This emotion is passion; I am peace.” And so on. Let the other Cakkrams in their turn be thus destroyed, each one with its mental or moral attribute. 5. In this let him be aided by his own psychological analysis, so that no part of his conscious being be thus left undestroyed. And on his thoroughness in this matter may turn his success. 6. Lastl y, having drawn all his being into the highest Sahasrara Cakkra, let him remain eternally fixed in meditation thereupon. 7. Aum. THIRD METHOD 1. Let the Hermit stimulate each of the senses in turn, concentrating upon each until it ceases to stimulate. [The sense s of sight and touch are extremely difficult to conquer. In the end the Hermit must be utterly unable by any effort to see or feel the object of those senses. O.M.] 2. This being perfected, let him combine these two at a time. For example, let him chew gin ger (taste and touch), and watch a waterfall (sight and hearing), and watch incense (sight and smell), and crunch sugar in his teeth (taste and hearing), and so on. 3. These twenty - five practices being accomplished, let him combine them three at a time, and t hen four at a time. 4. Lastly, let him combine all the senses in a single object. And herein may a sixth sense be included. He is then to withdraw himself entirely from all these stimulations, perinde ac cadavar, in spite of his own efforts to attach himself to them. 5. By this method it is said that the demons of the Ruach,"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"LIBER TAV 99 that is, thoughts and memories, are inhibited, and We deny it not. But if so be that they arise, let him build a wall between himself and them according to the method. 6. Thus having stilled t he voices of the Six, may he sense the subtlety of the Seventh. 7. Aum. [We add the following, contributed by a friend at that time without the A ∴ A ∴ and its dependent orders. He worked out the method himself, and we think it may prove useful to many. O. M .] (1) The beginner must first practise breathing regularly through the nose, at the same time trying hard to imagine that the breath goes to the Ajna and not to the lungs. The Prana yama exercises described in the E QUINOX , Vol. I., No. 4 , p. 101 , must nex t be practised, always with the idea that Ajna is breathing. Try to realise that power , not air, is being drawn into the Ajna, is being concentrated there during Kumbhaka, and is vivifying the Ajna during expiration. Try rather to increase the force of co ncentration in Ajna than the increase exces - sively the length of Kumbhaka, as this is dangerous if rashly undertaken. (2) Walk slowly in a quiet place; realise that the legs are moving, and study their movements. Understand thoroughly that these movement s are due to nerve messages sent down from the brain, and that the controlling power lies in the Ajna. The legs are automatic, like those of a wooden monkey: the power in Ajna is that which does the work, is that which walks. This is not hard to realise, and should be grasped firmly, ignoring all other walking sensations. Apply this method to every other muscular movement."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 100 (3) Lie flat on the back with the feet under a heavy piece of furniture. Keeping the spine straight and the arms in line with the bo dy, rise slowly to a sitting posture, by means of the force residing in the Ajna ( i.e. try to prevent the mind dwelling on any other exertion or sensation). Then let the body slowly down to its original position. Repeat this two or three times every night and morning, and slowly increase the number of repetitions. (4) Try to transfer all bodily sensations to the Ajna: e.g. “I am cold” should mean “I feel cold,” or better still, “I am aware of a sensation of cold” — transfer this to the Ajna, “The Ajna is a ware,” etc. (5) Pain if very slight may easily be transferred to the Ajna after a little practice. The best method for a beginner is to imagine he has a pain in the body and then imagine that it passes directly to the Ajna. It does not pass through the intervening structures, but goes direct. After continual practice even severe pain may be transferred to the Ajna. (6) Fix the mind on the base of the spine and then gradually move the thoughts upwards to the Ajna. (In this meditation Ajna is the Holy of Holies, but it is dark and empty.) Finally, strive hard to drive anger and other obsessing thoughts into the Ajna. Try to develop a tendency to think hard of Ajna when these thoughts attack the mind, and let Ajna conquer them. Beware of thinking “ my Ajna .” In these meditations and practices, Ajna does not belong to you; Ajna is the master and worker, you are the wooden monkey."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" LIBER VIARVM VIÆ SVB FIGVRÂ DCCCLXVIII"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" A ∴ A ∴ Publication in Class B.

This book is not intended to lead to the supreme attainment. On the contrary, its results define the separate being of the Exempt Adept from the rest of the Universe, and discover his relation to that Universe. 1. It is of such importance to the Exempt Adept that We cannot overrate it. Let him in no wise adventure the plunge into the Abyss until he have accomplished this to his most perfectest satisfaction. 2. For in the Abyss no effort is anywise possible. The Abyss is passed by virtue of the mass of the Adept and his Karma. Two forces impel him: ( 1 ) the attraction of Binah, ( 2 ) the im pulse of his Karma; and the ease and even the safety of his passage depend on the strength and direction of the latter. 3.

It is even said that in certain circumstances it is possible to fall altogether from the Tree of Life, and to attain the Towers of the B lack Brothers. But We hold that this is not possible for any adept who has truly attained his grade, or even for any man who has really sought to help humanity even for a single second, 1 and that although his aspiration have been impure through vanity o r any similar imperfection. 5. Let the Adept who finds the result of these meditations unsatisfactory refuse the Oath of the Abyss, and live so that his Karma gains strength and direction suitable to the task at some future period. 6. Memory is essential to the individual consciousness; otherwise the mind were but a blank sheet on which shadows are cast. But we see that not only does the mind retain impressions, but that it is so constituted that its tendency is to retain some more excellently than others. Thus the great classical scholar, Sir Richard Jebb, was unable to learn even the schoolboy mathematics required for the preliminary examination at Cambridge University, and a special act of the authorities was required in order to admit him. 7. The first method t o be described has been detailed in Bhikku Ananda Metteya's “Training of the Mind” ( E QUINOX , I. 5 , pp. 28 - 59 , and especially pp. 48 - 56 ). We have little to alter or to add. Its most important result, as regards the Oath of the Abyss, is the freedom from all desire or clinging to everything which it gives. Its second result is to 1 Those in posession of Liber CLXXXV. will note that in every grade but one the aspirant is pledged to serve his inferiors in the Order."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"LIBER bracyt aid the adept in the second method, by supplying him with further data for his investigaiton. 8. The stimulation of memory useful in both practices is also achieved by simple medita tion (Liber E), in a certain stage of which old memories arise unbidden. The adept may then practice this, stopping at that stage, and encouraging instead of suppressing the flashes of memory. 9. Zoroaster has said, \"Explore the River of the Soul, whence or in what order you have come; so that although you have become a servant to the body, you may again rise to that Order (the A ∴ A ∴ ) from which you descended, joining Works (Kamma) to Sacred Reason (the Tao)” 10. The Result of the Second Method is to show the Ad ept to what end his powers are destined. When he has passed the Abyss and become N EMO , the return of the current causes him “to appear in the Heaven of Jupiter as a morning star or as an evening star.” 1 In other words, he should discover what may be th e nature of his work. Thus Mohammed was a Brother reflected in Netzach, Buddha a Brother reflected into Hod, or, as some say, Daath. The present manifestation of Frater P. to the outer is in Tiphareth, to the inner in the path of Leo. 11. First Method. Let the Exempt Adept first train himself to think backwards by external means, as set forth here following. ( a ) Let him learn to write backwards, with either hand. 1 The formula of the Great Work “Solve et Coagula,” may be thus inter - preted. S olve, the dissolution of the Self in the Infinite; Coagula, the presentation of the Infinite in a concrete form to the outer. Both are necessary to the Task of a Master of the Temple."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX ( b ) Let him learn to walk backwards. ( c ) Let him constantly watch, if convenient, cinemato - g raph films, and listen to phonograph records, reversed, and let him so accustom himself to these that they appear natural, and appreciable as a whole. ( d ) Let him practice speaking backwards; thus, for “I am He” let him say, “Eh ma I.” ( e ) Let him learn t o read backwards. In this it is difficult to avoid cheating one's self, as an expert reader sees a sentence at a glance. Let his disciple read aloud to him backwards, slowly at first, then more quickly. ( f ) Of his own ingenium let him devise other method s. 12. In this his brain will at first be overwhelmed by a sense of utter confusion; secondly, it will endeavour to avoid the difficulty by a trick. The brain will pretend to be working backwards when it is really normal. It is difficult to describe the natu re of the trick, but it will be quite obvious to anyone who has done practices ( a ) or ( b ) for a day or two. They become quite easy, and he will think he is making progress, an illusion which close analysis will dispel. 13. Having begun to train his brain in t his manner, and obtained some little success, let the Exempt Adept, seated in his Asana, think first of his present attitude, next of the act of being seated, next of his entering the room, next of his robing, et cetera, exactly as it happened. And let hi m most strenu - ously endeavour to think each act as happening backwards. It is not enough to think: “I am seated here, and before that I was standing, and before that I entered the romm,” etc. That series is the trick detected in the preliminary practi ces."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"LIBER bracyt The series must not run “ghi - def - abc,” but “ihgfedcba”: not “horse a is this” but “esroh a si siht.” To obtain this thoroughly well, practice ( c ) is useful. The brain will be found to struggle constantly to right itself, soon accustoming itself to accept “esroh” as merely another glyph for “horse.” This tendency must be constantly combatted. 14. In the early stages of this practice the endeavour should be to meticulous minuteness of detail in remembering actions; for the brain's habit of thinking forwa rds will at first be insuperable. Thinking of large and complex actions, then, will give a series which we may symbolically write “opqrstu - hijklmn - abcdefg.” If these be split into detail, we shall have “stu - prq - o — mn - kl - hij — fg - cde - ab,” which is much near to the ideal “utsrqponmlkjihgfedcba.” 15. Capacities differ widely, but the Exempt Adept need have no reason to be discouraged if anfter a month's continuous labour he find that no and again for a few seconds his brain really works backwards. 16. The Exempt Adept should concentrate his efforts upon obtaining a perfect picture of five minutes backwards rather than upon extending the time covered by his meditation. For this preliminary training of the brain is the Pons Asinorum of the whole process. 17. This five minute s' exercise being satisfactory, the Exempt Adept may extend the same at his discretion to cover an hour, a day, a week, and so on. Difficulties vanish before him as he advances; the extension from a day to the course of his whole life will not prove so di fficult as the perfecting of the five minutes. 18. This practice should be repeated at least four times"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX daily, and progress is shown firstly by the ever easier running of the brain, secondly by the added memories which arise. 19. It is useful to reflect during thi s practice, which in time becomes almost mechanical, upon the way in which effects spring from causes. This aids the mind to link its memories, and prepares the adept for the preliminary practice of the Second Method. 20. Having allowed the mind to return fo r some hun - dred times to the hour of birth, it should be encouraged to endeavour to penetrate beyond that period. If it be properly trained to run backwards, there will be little difficulty in doing this, although it is one of the distinct steps in the practice. 21. It may be then that the memory will persuade the adept of some previous existence. Where this is possible, let it be checked by an appeal to facts, as follows. 22. It often occurs to men that on visiting a place to which they have never been, it ap pears familiar. This may arise from a confusion of thought or a slipping of the memory, but it is conceivably a fact. If, then, the adept “remember” that he was in a previous life in some city, say Cracow, which he has in this life never visited, let him describe from memory the appearance of Cracow, and of its inhabitants, setting down their names. Let him further enter into the details of the city and its customs. And having done this with great minuteness, let him confirm the same by consultation wi th historians and geographers, or by a personal visit, remembering (both to the credit of his memory and its discredit) that historians, geographers, and himself are alike fallible. But let him not trust his memory to"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"LIBER bracyt assert its conclusions as fact, and a ct thereupon, without most adequate confirmation. 23. This process of checking his memory should be practised with earlier memories of childhood and youth by reference to the memories and records of others, always reflecting upon the fallibility even of such s afeguards. 24. All this being perfected, so that the memory reaches back into æons incalulably distant, let the Exempt Adept meditate upon the fruitlessness of all those years, and upon the fruit thereof, severing that which is transitory and worth - less from t hat which is eternal. And it may be that he being but an Exempt Adept may hold all to be savourless and full of sorrow. 25. This being so, without reluctance will he swear the Oath of the Abyss. 26. Second Method. Let the Exempt Adept, fortified by the practice of the First Method, enter the preliminary practice of the Second Method. 27. Second Method. Prelimary Practices. Let him, seated in his Asana, consider any event, and trace it to its immediate causes. And let this be done very fully and minutely. Here, f or example, is a body erect and motionless. Let the adept consider the many forces which maintain it; firstly, the attraction of the earth, of the sun, of the planets, of the farthest stars, nay, of every mote of dust in the room, one of which (could it be annihilated) would cause that body to move, although so imperceptibly. Also, the resistance of the floor, the pressure of the air, and all other external conditions. Secondly, the internal forces which sustain it, the vast and complex machinery of th e skeleton, the muscles,"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX the blood, the lymph, the marrow, all that makes up a man. Thirdly, the moral and intellectual forces involved, the mind, the will, the consciousness. Let him continue this with unremitting ardour, searching Nature, leaving nothi ng out. 28. Next let him take one of the immediate causes of his position, and trace out its equilibrium. For example, the will. What determines the will to aid in holding the body erect and motionless? 29. This being determined, let him choose one of the forces which determined his will, and trace out that in similar fashion; and let this process be continued for many days until the interdependence of all things is a truth assimilated in his inmost being. 30. This being accomplished, let him trace out his own histor y with special reference to the causes of each event. And in this practice he may neglect to some extent the universal forces which at all times act on all, as for example the attraction of masses, and let him concentrate his attention upon the principal and determining or effective causes. For instance, he is seated, perhaps, in a country place in Spain. Why? Because Spain is warm and suitable for meditation, and because cities are noisy and crowded. Why is Spain warm? and why does he wish to meditate? Why choose warm Spain rather than warm India? To the last question: Because Spain is nearer to his home. Then why is his home near Spain? Because his parents were Germans. And why did they go to Germany? And so during the whole meditation. 31. On anothe r day, let him begin with a question of another kind, and every day devise new questions, not only concerning his present situation, but also abstract questions."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"LIBER bracyt Thus let him connect the prevalence of water upon the surface of the globe with its necessity to such life as we know, with the specific gravity and other physical properties of water, and let him perceive ultimately through all this the necessity and concord of things, not concord as the schoolmen of old believed, making all things for man's bene fit or convenience, but the essential mechanical concord whose final law is inertia . And in these meditations let him avoid as if it were the plague any speculation sentimental or fantastic. 32. Second Method. The Practice Proper. Having then perfcted in hi s mind these conceptions, let him apply them to his own career, forging the links of memory into the chain of necessity. And let this be his final question: To what purpose am I fitted? Of what service can my being prove to the Brothers of the A ∴ A ∴ if I cross the Abyss, and am admitted to the City of the Pyramids? 33. Now that he may clearly understand the nature of this question, and the method of solution, let him study the reasoning of th anatomist who reconstructs an animal from a single bone. T o take a simple example. 34. Suppose, having lived all my life among savages, a ship is cast upon the shore and wrecked. Undamaged among the cargo is a “Victoria.” What is its use? The wheels speak of roads, their slimness of smooth roads, the brake of hi lly roads. The shalts show that it was meant to be drawn by an animal, their height and length suggest an animal of the size of a horse. That the carriage is open suggests a climate tolerable at any rate for part of the year. The height of the box sugge sts crowded streets, or the spirited character of the"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX animal employed to draw it. The cushions indicate its use to convey men rather than merchandise; its hood that rain sometimes falls, or that the sun is at times powerful. The springs would imply consi derable skill in metals; the varnish much attainment in that craft. 35. Similarly, let the adept consider of his own case. Now that he is on the point of plunging into the Abyss, a giant Why? confronts him with uplifted club. 36. There is no minutest atom of his composition which can be withdrawn from him without making him some other than what he is, no useless moment in his past. Then what is his future? The “Victoria” is not a waggon; it is not intended for carting hay. It is not a sulky; it is useless in tr otting races. 37. So the adept has military genius, or much knowledge of Greek: how do these attainments help his purpose, or the purpose of the Brothers? He was put to death by Calvin, or stone by Hezekiah; as a snake he was killed by a villager, or as an e lephant slain in battle under Hamilcar. How do such memories help him? Until he have thoroughly mastered the reason for every incident in his past, and found a purpose for every item of his present equipment, 1 he cannot truly answer even those Three Ques tions that were first put to him, even the Three Questions of the Ritual of the Pyramid;he is not ready to swear the Oath of the Abyss. 38. But being thus enlightened, let him swear the Oath of the Abyss; year let him swear the Oath of the Abyss. 1 A Brother known to me was repeatedly baffled in this meditation. But one day being thrown with his horse over a sheer cliff of forty feet, and escaping without a scratch or a bruise, he was reminded of his many narrow escapes from death. These proved to be the last factors in his problem, which, thus completed, solved ist self in a moment.   O.

Right - and left - hand sides in this case correspond, according to a somewhat complex rule which it is unnecessary to give here. The attributions to the Court Cards of the Tarot naturally follow. 4 . Lesser Squares. The upper side of each pyramid is governed by the Kerub standing on the file above it. The lower side is governed by the Kerub also, but in order descending as the are from right to left above.

It was not often the Daphnis led his goats too far toward the crags, for the plain was green and gracious. Only in one spot was the sward broken. There did mosses and flowers, yellow, blue, and white, cover a mound as soft and firm as a maiden's breas t. Daphnis, true child, loved to make believe that this mound was sacred to some nymph. He would never invade the circle, or allow his goats to wander on it. But he would take his flute and invoke the nymph, or express the faint stirrings of manhood in his boyish breast by some such simple song as this: — “Goats of mine, give ear, give ear! Shun this mound for food or frolic! Heaven is open; gods are near To my musings melancholic. Spring upon the earth begets Daffodils and violets.

But on the day of the summer sols tice, as he plainted with the old refrain, the lilies stirred more violently; and the day was windless. Also it seemed to him as if a faint mist inhabited their midst. And he sang: — “Mist, is this the fairy veil Of the bright one that's for me? Too pha ntastic, false and frail, See, it melts to vanity!” Yet was he eagerly afoot with curiosity, for now the mist rose in fiercer puffs, and little jets of flame spurted and sparkled amid the lilies: — “Is the earth herself (he sang) that breathes In the boso m of the flowers? Is it fatal fire that seethes From the heart of hateful powers?\"” And the tumult of the mound increasing ever, he went forward a step toward the circle; yet again his self - set fear caught him, and he drew back — yet again his eagerness lu red him. In the end, reality conquered imagination; he advanced delicately up the knoll. Like the nipple of a breast, earth protruded, red, puckered, fissured. This Daphnis saw as he broke through the tall lilies. From its centre jetted the dusky, rose - re d mist.

The nearer he approached the nipple the more fantastic were his antics, the more strident his laughter. Now at the foot of the mound appeared a company of merchants and slaves journeying in caravan. All these, attracted from their path by the unwonted sounds, beheld him thus dancing. The whisper went round: “He is possessed of the spirit of some God,” and they all fell upon their faces and worshipped. Then followed the wonder of all; for at high noon was the sun wrapped in blackness of eclipse. In the gathering darkness and the strange shadows Daphnis still leapt and laughed; but as the sun was wholly swallowed by the drago n, he gave one supreme shriek, and fell exhausted.

Beyond the last of these, where the temple narrowed, was a shrine hidden, for from the roof hung a veil of purple, on which were written in golden letters the names and titles of Apollo. It was the hour of worship; with uplifted hands a bearded priest in a voluminous robe of azure and gold cried aloud the invocations. He stood beyond t he tripod, his face toward the shrine. “Hail to the Lord of the Sun! Mystic, magnificent one! Who shall contend with him? None. Hail to the Lord of the Sun!

Hardly a minute — a string snapped; the whole music jarred; and the priest ran from the shrine, shrieking “Apollo! Apollo! Veil your faces! Apollo hath descended.” Himself he flu ng upon the marble before the tripod. There was a noise as of thunder; the veil was swept open as by a whirlwind, and Apollo, one flame of gold, entered the temple. As he passed, the priestesses fell dead and their torches were extinct. But a ray of glor y from above, a monstrance to the God, followed him. Slowly and majestically he moved to the tripod. In his hands he bore an instrument of wood, of unfamiliar shape. Music of triumph and of glory answered his paces. To the pythoness he advanced, thus dan cing. He took the lyre from her hands and broke it. She stared, entranced. He put the strange instrument into her hands and, drawing down her head, pressed his lips to her forehead. Then he breathed lightly on her hands. Darkness fell, and lightnings rent it; thunders answered them. Apollo was gone. After the thunder the temple was filled with rosy radiance. The old priest, still prone, raised and let fall his hands, in mechanical imitation of the signs of invocation. Obedient, the pythoness began to pla y upon the instrument given of the God, and the temple shuddered at sounds so ethereal, so soul shaking, so divine. A greater music had been given to the world.

His hut, built of bark and saplings, was on an arm of earth thrown between the Inlet and the roaring Pacific.

Not till the spring, till the awakening merriment of birds and earthy life sent a responsive thrill through sentient nature, did it move. Great - limbed and pallid, with nerveless skeleton body and cavernous eyes, he gazed upon the sunlit young earth and sun - blue sea, uncomprehending. He grew like a strong animal. In the clear airs, the open life, his limbs filled and became firm. Knowledge of the wild life, the wild creatures of the forest and sea, came to him intuitively. In strength and stature he was before long the finest man on the Inlet shores. But his mind had sustained a shock, and the past was a great blank to him. He went to live alone in an isolated cove of the Inlet. The country - folk thought he was mad, because of the strange and silent life he chose to lead.

The beautiful myth was a halo bound round the brows of his dead mother. The patriarchs of Learning, the magi of know - ledge, with incredulity and amaze paid him homage. Wonder - ment gave place to admiration and applause. The l aurels of scholarship were pressed upon him. For awhile the gate to an immortal fame was ajar. “A youthful daring spirit of invention, stimulated by the discoveries of science to take its flight to new and hitherto inaccessible regions,” had been written of him. A recluse, Michael Greig immured himself from the world, that wolfish hunger after knowledge quenching all impulses but one to push beyond. His soul struggled in the solitude of a lonely life, thought its wings moved in the serene atmosphere of pure philosophy. Lost in a maze of specula - tions, in lofty abstractions, his brain grew dizzy. “The consciousness of the limitations of man, that sense of an open Secret — which he cannot penetrate — in which is the essence of religion,” probed his faculties , dragging them earthwards.

Moth’r Mary constantly affirmed that she was a witch! I laughed to think that serious belief in the black arts was not dead, but found that several old people in this beautiful wilderness of th e world clung to ancient superstitions and remnants of folk - lore. Some fishermen, driven by a fresh breeze to a far corner of the Inlet, had seen a shadowy figure beside the man’s on the distant beach. They had heard weird laughter, and the notes of a si ren - song softly borne on the wind. Their sails had flapped helplessly in the wind as they tried to turn. They had tacked in the treacherous shallows on the further shore. Until night - fall they struggled vainly. Presently the singing ceased, and behold! the wind at once filled the sails and the smacks crept quietly into the broader swell. The fishermen told their story in the township, and the crones decided that witchery had been used. A settler’s boy, driving home his straying cattle through the mars hes in mid - summer, had seen the white reflection of a woman's form in a dark pool of water. Voices came through the trees.

The sun shone in shafted light on their iridescent wings. Only the wind and the sunlight and these light - winged creatures of air had ever pierced its depths of vaporous sh adow. But the boy had seen the tall figure of the Inlet madman among the trees, seen also a reflection of whiteness and floating hair, in the dark pool beside him. He had heard flute - like laughter, its echoing melody in the leafy stillness, and a deep - th roated answer. On the outskirts of the marsh, by the beaten narrow track, the half - scared youngster lay in ambush. He had heard the tinkling cattle - bells grow faint in the distance. Then, escaping from the hidden lair, he ran away with the tale. In the evening, old men foregathered on the verandah of the “Ship Inn.” Heads nodded. Tongues wagged wisely. Mysterious tales of sorcery and the like went round. They conjectured that the madman had dealings with the Evil One. This was the reason of his mis fortunes. The witch - woman was, therefore, an emissary of the Devil, they concluded. An old wood - cutter told me his version of the mystery, with professed dissent from the popular notion. He and some mates had been marking trees in a distant part of the forest and saw a strange spectacle. A woman all wreathed in flowers, bare - armed and bare - footed, was enthroned on the stump of a tree. In her tangled dusky hair showery clematis was woven. The Hermit lay at her feet, a trailing garland in his hands, his eyes upraised. In the silence a branch of hazel - wood snapped. Like a startled wild creature the woman fled.

The man sprang to his feet, face to face with t he surprised intruders. He stood, wild, fierce - eyed, like a lion at bay. His powerful limbs were quivering with passionate strength. Mute and sheepish, the wood - cutter and his mates slunk away down the hill - side. Wandering high up the range, I sought t he scene of this idyll. The mountains rose like a wall from the green of the bush tree - tops. There were depths and depths in their blue recesses. The slope of a timbered spur stood on the verge of a great forest. Through dim arcades of the forest I pas sed. The primeval majesty, the immensity, of the silent tree - world worked within me. There were patriarchal monarchs of the green - wood, giants of strength and lusty leafage, young trees in their slim, vigorous youth. Maenads, with rugged bark flying fro m glistening naked limbs, tossed their fragrant foliage. Dead trees with up - raised ghostly arms dolorously wailed a miserere to the blue sky. The hill - path grew steeper, the trees taller. The mountain gums were like columns of living marble, shining whi te in the green forest depths. Sometimes their whiteness was splashed with ochre, seamed with coral, stained steely blue. Through a track that was an alley of sweet - smelling flowering shrubs I went. Restless torrents tossed between the hills, cascading silvery in blue depths of mist. I crept through the dewy fern groves — moist and heated, smelling of life in the fertile mould, through damp ferny coverts of flowers. In the long forest aisles tall waving fern - fans shut away the light.

A high vaulted pavilion of leaves lifted and drifted in the winds, showing the blue of mid - heaven. Musks and hazel - woods thronged. Mimosas entirely golden with massy down of blossoms, and acacias in every hue of yellow, hedged about it. Fern - fans waved against the light. Uncurling fronds of ferny undergrowth, golden - brown and chrysoprase, spread amo ng the grasses. Clematis lay like snow among the threes, drooping in pendulous masses, casting starry trails to weave and twine over the bushes. The vines of the purple sarsa - parilla ran in festoons, and wound about the stately columns of the gums. At t heir bases delicate shoots sprang in a thicket of pale blue foliage. Near one end of the screening leafage was the natural altar, a gray, hewn tree - stump. Shafted sunlight played over the grassy lawn. Flights of butterflies fluttered from the shrubs. I flung myself into the deep fragrant grasses and pondered. There is a mysterious spell in the lonely stillness and beauty of the forest hills. The air, with its mingled musky aroma of trees, its wild, heavy fragrance of flowers, is narcotic. One drifts into a hazy dreamland of imagination. The bird - music swells, the singing and sighing of sweet notes, merry roulades, the long, quivering, tender breaths of sound. Throbbing exultant tremolos, warbling, whispering, and lonely sobbing notes, bouts of gusty merriment, rise and fall distantly on the enchanted air.

And I saw, in fancy, a flower - wreathed woman, with shadowy hair, garlanded with starry clematis, serving as priestess before it, and the figure of a strong man who worshipped. In this wilderne ss of deep green forest and sapphire Inlet, Spring made sanctuary. What an Eden it was in its exquisite loveliness and solitude! Two renegade souls of our modern time had made Eden of it. He was the Adam, purged of memory, she the Eve, “new - waked” to wo man’s primitive innocence and purity. But the day of their happiness was ended. “Happiness is the mirage of Life’s Desert,” I told myself. Twilight was creeping along the vistas of the forest. Moth’r Mary told me a story as she clattered backwards and forwards from the well in the gloaming. The old woman, with her stooping figure, short rough skirts, folded shawl and sun - bonnet, had an old - world simplicity. The spring water splashed over her pails. The clanking and jarring of her industrious occupati on, the clomping of her hob - nailed boots, accompanied the vigorous recitative. Her tongue ever wagged lustily as she worked. I hardly heeded the story as I watched the workings of the sunset. The great wall of the forest overhung us. Im - penetrable,the g reen depths faced me, and climbed up the range.

After the old woman had gone, the story emerged from a cell of my sub - conscious brain. Night came. The wall of the hills was dark, lit with the red stars of far - off fires. I mused over this last development of the Inlet Idyll. The first lambs of spring were crying like children in the chill winds of the morning, Moth’r Mary had said, when the madman of the Inlet strode into the township. The winter shadow of the hills lay on them still. The gorse was gleaming golden by the roadsides. Flocks of snowy geese meandering along the way - side scattered in terror as he passed. He carried something in his arms. The townsfolk — women, bare - legged children, and a few surly men, gathered curiously. He went to Moth’r Mary's humpy at the far end of the road. She crossed herself, and muttered a prayer against witchcraft, when she saw his stalwart, unkempt figure. All the countryside feared him since the rumours of that strange companion of his solitude had spread. He was gentle and tender as a woman, as he unfolded his arms. Wrapped in the hare - skins, he carried a child — a dark - skinned baby that wailed fretfully. The man's face was agonized at its cry. “He is sick,” he said, giving the child to Moth’r Mary, with piteous eyes. Half compassionately, half fearfully, the old woman took the infant. He left it with her, but came often again to the township bringing her fish and sea - fowl. She lost fear at the sight of hi m; scolded him garrulously, ranted, and interrogated."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 274 But to no purpose. He said the child belonged to him and would say no more. She protested that the Hermit was “soft,” not mad. With serious, tender eyes he watched the child grow, always bringing it some bright feathers or sea - shells to play with. My first impulse was to attribute the man’s action to a compassionate instinct for some woodman’s sick child. Scattered through the forests were the bark huts of log - men and road - menders. It found no answ ering sympathy. The solution to the rustic’s mind was the witch woman’s existence. I found myself agreeing with them, apart from all fanciful interpretation. He grew up a slight, wild, merry creature, this boy, and became the scourge of his old foster - mo ther’s life, with his mischievous ways. He was always coming back to her, with a will - o’ - the - wisp affection. The neighbours called him “The Devil's Brat,” with odd superstition that powers of evil had been agents of his birth. He was a lonely child. Th e man at the Inlet missed him for weeks sometimes. And at night an elfish face peering in at her window would give Moth’r Mary such a shock that she muttered prayers and charms to herself half the night. Then at dawn her maternal heart would melt when sh e found a bare, brown body asleep on her doorstep, and saw the pathos of the child face in the weariness and peace of sleep. She crooned a rare wealth of love and pity over him. On winter nights she left the door unlatched, and by the dead leaves round t he hearth she knew who had sheltered there.

"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"276 CHAPTER V T HOUGHT is the music of consciousness. It is the singing voice of the soul. From a world of intense thinking this man had passed. With clouded brain, as from sleep awakened, he went into the morning of a new life; from the darkness of pessimism into the daylight, with eyes dazzled, and the faith of a child. To him the stars were angels’ eyes. Earth was a garden — the garden of God. The winds and the sun and the sea had voices, and b reathed in his soul. Tutelary nature bred sense anew, with wild untrammelled strength. The poetry of an intense mind throve. A woman’s presence had won him from taciturn savagery. Was he mad, or was that solitary existence a phase of the eccentricity t o which great minds are akin? I asked myself. What of the woman? Was she some vagabond gipsy creature or perhaps the baggage of a distant islander? Their mutual love had imparadised life. That was all I knew. We became close companions, this lonely Ma n of the Inlet and I. And we would lie together for hours on the sands in the sunlight. In my company his strange restlessness was abated, and although there was a frontier over which his memory of personal things could not pass, his mind in the imperson al realm was vigorous and untrammelled."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"DIANA OF THE INLET 277 It was one day just after he had left me that I made a discovery. The point of a sapling with which I carelessly disturbed the sand suddenly brought to light a wreath of red berries tied with a woman's dark hair.

Then a piece of newspaper, yellow with sea - water and scarcely legible, hidden among some shells, ca me to light. But I read on this scrap of paper a paragraph which intimated that a search party was setting out with a view of discovering traces of a young lady who had been lost overboard from a craft called the “Maiai.” The vessel had encountered heavy w eather rounding the Promontory. A welcome lull occurring after sunset put the passengers and crew off their guard. Suddenly without the slightest warning an immense sea rose. “Big as a mountain,” the captain said. It thundered with terrific crash upon th e decks, sweeping the vessel from end to end. In a few minutes the sea was again tranquil. Some seamen had observed a woman’s figure standing aft before the sea came. That lady, it was feared, had been swept off in the receding swirl of the wave. Some hope was entertained of her being picked up by stray fishermen and being still alive on some desolate Straits Island. The paper was torn where a name had been written. With the guilty sensations of a peeping Tom, I peered further into the mystery. Accor ding to the ship's reading, the wave had arisen in lat. 38” 5', and long. 146” 4’ 5’ west.

I threw my imagination into the balance with that madman’s. The poesy of circumstance, the contemplation of a “soul set free,” filled me. A very revelry it was, in the upheaval of those “laws by which the flesh bars in the spirit.” Love lies above ourselves. It is that pure inspiration of the great spirit which made idyll in Eden. This, then, was the haven the immaculate woman of my conception had found. I wondered why she had left her Eden solitudes. Was it fear for the man, — fear of his passion and savage strength if force separated her from him? Did she think he was mad? Would they have fettered those splendid limbs, heaped insult and ignominy on the dignity of that great, simple mind? I seemed to hear a voice pl eading with me, the echo of a cry. “They would make thee kempt and shaven, Tenderness!” And again the hopeful “I will come again!” This scrap of paper must have come in the drift of fishermen’s “debris.” She had seen it and fled to stave off discovery. I thought deeply on the tangled skein of our instincts and conventions. The tide was low. The channels, between the green mud - banks, were blue as the cloudless sky. Sea - birds were feeding on their edge. Gulls and gannets, gathering along the beach and wading in the silver - laved sand, softly whistled among themselves. The waves rushed murmuringly.

The pressure of strong feeling assuaged throbbed in her soft, low voice. “I recognize in myself that primitive Woman who arises to mock at civilization and creeds,” she said. “The blood of Mother Eve beats against my brain.” “I want the man! my man — Adam of the Inlet shores!” her arms moved outwards tremulously. “Here is the I, the woman soaring over the immolation of Life, the detestable, heartless hopelessness of existence. I am come back to the Inlet!” she said. He words voiced wit h a throbbing passion fell softly into silence. Then she spoke again, with the slow speech of a mind far away. “The moon is rising on the Inlet,” she said, “a pale, silver moon in a dim sky; can’t you see it, breaking on the dim waters. The wailing of t he swans, the cries of the gulls, the moan of the struggling sea, don't you hear them? “It was the moon he loved as did Endymion. And when I came — a mortal woman, self - sent from a barren and desolate life, he loved and called me after her.” “Diane! Diane!” Was it the faint wailing note of a wild swan that beat the still air?"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"DIANA OF THE INLET 289 “Coming! Coming!” she cried with low harmonious voice of joyful promise. She lifted the dark - skinned boy and laid him against her breast. “Our two selves gave thee Soul, Beloved,” sh e murmured passionately, cradling the soft dark head in her arms. Round all the Inlet islands the dawn came stealing, out - lining the coves and headlands with a silver thread. All the sea - birds awoke in clamorous choir, with whirring wings. Wild swans took their arrowy flight across the shining surface of the Inlet. Speckled snipe, and red - bills, and oyster - catchers were feeding at the silver brim of the sea. A pelican arose from a sandy cove, and with slow flapping flight winged seawards. On an upla nd that gave on the Inlet panorama, a woman stood. Her eyes, and the sorrowful thought stirring in their depths, bade farewell to the beautiful scene, the sapphire blue, locked on the west by bold distant mountains. Purple they were, transfused with pink glow of the morning sky. The broad expanse of the Pacific lay beyond the Inlet. Sea - breakers rose against the sky.

It is now five years since I discovered my stelé at Bulak, but not until I obtained certain initiation in the city of Benares last year did the memory of my life in the Twenty - Sixth Dynasty when I was prince and priest in Thebai begin to retu rn. Even now much is obscure; but I am commanded to write, so that in writing the full memory may be recovered. For without the perfect knowledge and understanding of that strange life by Nilus I cannot fully know and understand this later life, or find that Tomb which I am appointed to find, and do that therein which must be done. Therefore with faith and confidence do I who was — in a certain mystical sense — the Priest of the Princes, Ankh - f - na - khonsu, child of Ta - nech, the holy and mighty one, and of Bes - na - Maut, priestess of the Starry One, set myself to tell myself the strange things that befell me in that life. Thus. At my birth Aphruimis in the sign of the Lion was ascending, and in it that strange hidden planet that presides over darkness and magic and forbidden love. The sun was united with the planet of Amoun, but in the Abyss, as showing"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 296 that my power and glory should be secret, and in Aterechinis the second decanate of the House of Maat, so that my passion and pleasure should likewise be unprofan ce. In the House of Travel in the Sign of the Ram was the Moon my sweet lady. And the wise men interpreted this as a token that I should travel afar; it might be to the great temple at the source of mother Nile; it might be . . . Foolishness! I have scar ce stirred from Thebai. Yet have I explored strange countries that they knew not of: and of this also will I tell in due course. I remember -- as I never could while I lived in Khemi - land -- all the minute care of my birth. For my mother was of the oldes t house in Thebes, her blood not only royal, but mixed with the divine. Fifty virgins in their silver tissue stood about her shaking their sistrons, as if the laughter of the Gods echoed the cries of the woman. By the bed stood the Priest of Horus with his heavy staff, the Phoenix for its head, the prong for its foot. Watchful he stood lest Sebek should rise from the abyss. On the roof of the palace watched the three chief astrologers of Pharaoh with their instruments, and four armed men from the corners o f the tower announced each god as it rose. So these three men ached and sweated at their task; for they had become most anxious. All day my birth had been expected; but as Toum drew to His setting their faces grew paler than the sky; for there was one dr ead moment in the night which all their art had failed to judge. The gods that watched over it were veiled. But it seemed unlikely that Fate would so decide; yet so they feared that they sent down to the priest of Thoth to say"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"ACROSS THE GULF 297 that he must at all costs a void the threatening moment, even if the lives of mother and child should pay for it; and still the watchmen cried the hour. Now, now! cried the oldest of the astrologers as the moment grew near — now! Below in answer the priest of Thoth summoned all his s kill. When lo! a rumbling of the abyss. The palace reeled and fell; Typhon rose mighty in destruction, striding across the skies. The world rocked with earthquake; every star broke from its fastening and trembled. And in the midst lo! Bes - na - Maut my mot her; and in her arms myself, laughing in the midst of all that ruin. Yet not one living creature took the slightest hurt! But the astrologers rent their robes and beat their faces on the ground; for the dread moment, the Unknown Terror, had gone by; and with it I had come to light. In their terror, indeed, as I learnt long after, they sent messengers to the oldest and wisest of the priests; the High - priest of Nuit, who lived at the bottom of a very deep well, so that his eyes, even by day, should remain fixed upon the stars. But he answered them that since they had done all that they could, and Fate had reversed their design, it was evident that the matter was in the hands of Fate, and that the less they meddled the better it would be for them. For he w as a brusque old man — how afterwards I met him shall be written in its place. So then I was to be brought up as befitted one in my station, half - prince, half - priest. I was to follow my father, hold his wand and ankh, assume his throne. And now I begin t o recall some details of my preparation for that high and holy task."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 298 Memory is strangely fragmentary and strangely vivid. I remember how, when I had completed my fourth month, the priests took me and wrapped me in a panther's skin, whose flaming gold and jet - black spots were like the sun. They carried me to the river bank where the holy crocodiles were basking; and there they laid me. But when they left me they refrained from the usual enchauntment against the evil spirit of the crocodile; and so for th ree days I lay without protection. Only at certain hours did my mother descend to feed me; and she too was silent, being dressed as a princess only, without the sacred badges of her office. Also in the sixth month they exposed me to the Sun in the desert where was no shade or clothing; and in the seventh month they laid me in a bed with a sorceress, that fed on the blood of young children, and, having been in prison for a long time, was bitterly an - hungered; and in the eighth month they gave me the aspic of Nile, and the royal Uraeus serpent, and the deadly snake of the south country, for playmates; but I passed scatheless through all these trials. And in the ninth month I was weaned, and my mother bade me farewell, for never again might she look upon my face, save in the secret rites of the Gods, when we should meet otherwise than as babe and mother, in the garment of that Second Birth which we of Khemi knew. The next six years of my life have utterly faded. All that I can recall is the vision of the g reatness of our city of Thebai, and the severity of my life. For I lived on the back of a horse, even eating and drinking as I rode; for so it becometh a prince. Also I was trained to lay about me with a sword, and in the use of the bow and the spear. For it was said that"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"ACROSS THE GULF 299 Horus — or Men Tu, as we called him in Thebai — was my Father and my God. I shall speak later of that strange story of my begetting. At the end of seven years, however, so great and strong had I waxen that my father took me to the old as trologer that dwelt in the well to consult him. This I remember as if it were but yesterday. The journey down the great river with its slow days! The creaking benches and the sweat of the slaves are still in my ears and my nostrils. Then swift moments of flying foam in some rapid or cataract. The great temples that we passed; the solitary Ibis of Thoth that meditated on the shore; the crimson flights of birds; — but nothing that we saw upon the journey was like unto the end thereof. For in a desolate pl ace was the Well, with but a small temple beside it, where the servants — they too most holy! of that holy ancient man might dwell. And my father brought me to the mouth of the well and called thrice upon the name of Nuit. Then came a voice climbing and co iling up the walls like a serpent, “Let this child become priestess of the Veiled One!” Now my father was wise enough to know that the old man never made a mistake; it was only a question of a right interpretation of the oracle. Yet he was sorely puzzled and distressed, for that I was a boy child. So at the risk of his life — for the old man was brusque! — he called again and said “Behold my son!” But as he spoke a shaft of sunlight smote him on the nape of the neck as he bent over the well; and his face black ened, and his blood gushed forth from his mouth. And the old man lapped up the blood of my father with his tongue, and cried"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 300 gleefully to his servants to carry me to a house of the Veiled One, there to be trained in my new life. So there came forth from t he little house an eunuch and a young woman exceeding fair; and the eunuch saddled two horses, and we rode into the desert alone. Now though I could ride like a man, they suffered me not; but the young priestess bore me in her arms. And though I ate meat like a warrior, they suffered me not, but the young priestess fed me at her breast. And they took from me the armour of gilded bronze that my father had made for me, scales like a crocodile's sewn upon crocodile skin that cunning men had cured with salt and spices; but they wrapped me in soft green silk. So strangely we came to a little house in the desert, and that which befell me there is not given me of the gods at this time to tell; but I will sleep; and in the morning by their favour the memory ther eof shall arise in me, even in me across these thousands of years of the whirling of the earth in her course."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"301 CHAPTER II So for many years I grew sleek and subtle in my woman’s attire. And the old eunuch (who was very wise) instructed me in the Art of M agic and in the worship of the Veiled One, whose priestess was I destined. I remember now many things concerning those strange rituals, things too sacred to write. But I will tell of an adventure that I had when I was nine years of age. In one of the sac red books it is written that the secret of that subtle draught which giveth vision of the star - abodes of Duant, whose sight is life eternal in freedom and pleasure among the living, lieth in the use of a certain little secret bone that is in the Bear of Sy ria. Yet how should I a child slay such an one? For they had taken all weapons from me. But in a garden of the city (for we had now returned unto a house in the suburbs of Thebai) was a colony of bears kept by a great lord for his pleasure. And I by my cunning enticed a young bear - cub from its dam, and slew it with a great stone. Then I tore off its skin and hid myself therein, taking also its jaw and sharpening the same upon my stone. Then at last the old she - bear came searching me, and as she put do wn her nose to smell at me, taking me for her cub, I drove my sharpened bone into her throat. I struck with great fortune; for she coughed once, and died."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 302 Then I took her skin with great labour; and (for it was now night) began to return to my house. Bu t I was utterly weary and I could no longer climb the wall. Yet I stayed awake all that night, sharpening again upon my stone the jaw - bone of that bear - cub; and this time I bound it to a bough that I tore off from a certain tree that grew in the garden. Now towards the morning I fell asleep, wrapped in the skin of the old she - bear. And the great bear himself, the lord of the garden, saw me, and took me for his mate, and came to take his pleasure of me. Then I being roused out of sleep struck at his he art with all my strength as he rose over me, and quitting my shelter ran among the trees. For I struck not home, or struck aslant. And the old bear, sore wounded, tore up the skin of his mate; and then, discovering the cheat, came after me. But by good fortune I found and wedged myself into a narrow pylon, too deep for him to reach me, though I could not go through, for the door was closed upon me. And in the angle of the door was an old sword disused. This was too heavy for me to wield with ease; yet I lifted it, an struck feebly at the claws of the bear. So much I wounded him that in his pain he dropped and withdrew and began to lick his paws. Thus he forgot about me; and I, growing bolder, ran out upon him. He opened his mouth; but before he could rise, I thrust the sword down it. He tossed his head; and I, clinging to the sword - hilt, was thrown into the air, and fell heavily upon my shoulder. My head too struck the ground; and I lay stunned. When I came to myself it was that a party of men and"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"ACROSS THE GULF 303 women had thrown water in my face and uttered the spells that revive from swoon. Beside me, close beside me, lay mine enemy dead; and I, not forgetful of my quest, took the blade of the sword (for it was snapt) and cut off the secret parts of the bear and took the little bone thereof; and would have gone forth with my prize. But the great lord of the house spake with me; and all his friends made as if to mock at me. But the women would not have it; they came round me and petted and caressed me; so that a ngry words were spoken. But even as they quarrelled among themselves, my guardian, the old eunuch, appeared among them; for he had traced me to the garden. And when they beheld the ring of the holy ancient man the astrologer they trembled; and the lord o f the house threw a chain of gold around my neck, while his lady gave me her own silken scarf, broidered with the loves of Isis and Nephthys, and of Apis and Hathor. Nor did any dare to take from me the little bone that I had won so dearly; and with it I made the spell of the Elixir, and beheld the starry abodes of Duant, even as it was written in the old wise book. But my guardians were ashamed and perplexed; for though I was so sleek and subtle, yet my manhood already glowed in such deeds as this — how sh ould I truly become the priestess of the Veiled One? Therefore they kept me closer and nursed me with luxury and flattery. I had two negro slave - boys that fanned me and that fed me; I had an harp - player from the great city of Memphis, that played languor ous tunes. But in my mis - chief I would constantly excite him to thoughts of war and of love; and his music would grow violent and loud, so"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 304 that the old eunuch, rushing in, would belabour him with his staff. How well I recall that room! Large was it a nd lofty; and there were sculptured pillars of malachite and lapis - lazuli and of porphyry and yellow marble. The floor was of black granite; the roof of white marble. On the Southern side was my couch, a softness of exotic furs. To roll in them was to ga sp for pleasure. In the centre was a tiny fountain of pure gold. The sunlight came through the space between the walls and the roof, while on the other sides I could look through and up into the infinite blue. There was a great python that inhabited the hall; but he was very old, and too wise to stir. But — so I then believed — he watched me and conveyed intelligence to the old magus of the well. Now then the folly of my guardians appeared in this; that while all day I slept and languished and played idly, at night while they supposed I slept, I slept not. But I rose and gave myself to the most violent exercises. First, I would go into my bathing - pool and hold my breath beneath the water while I invoked the goddess Auramoth one hundred times. Next, I wou ld walk on my hands around the room; I even succeeded in hopping on one hand. Next, I would climb each of the twenty - four smooth pillars. Next, I would practise the seventy - two athletic postures. Also in many other ways I would strive to make my strengt h exceeding great; and all this I kept most secret from my guardians. At last on one night I resolved to try my strength; so, pushing aside the curtain, I passed into the corridor. Spring - ing upon the soldier that guarded me, I brought him to the"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"ACROSS THE GULF 305 ground; and with my right hand under his chin, my left on his right shoulder, and my knee at the nape of his neck, I tore his head from his body before he could utter a cry. I was now in my fifteenth year; but the deed was marvelous. None suspected me; it was th ought a miracle. The old eunuch, distressed, went to consult the magus of the well; whose answer was; “Let the vows of the priestess be taken!” Now I thought this old man most foolish - obstinate; for I myself was obstinate and foolish. Not yet did I at al l understand his wisdom or his purpose. It often happens thus. Of old, men sent their priests to rebuke Nile for rising — until it was known that his rising was the cause of the fertility of their fields. Now of the vows which I took upon me and of my ser vice as priestess of the Veiled One it shall next be related."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"306 CHAPTER III I T was the Equinox of Spring, and all my life stirred in me. They led me down cool colonnades of mighty stone clad in robes of white broidered with silver, and veiled with a veil o f fine gold web fastened with rubies. They gave me not the Uraeus crown, nor any nemyss, nor the Ateph crown, but bound my forehead with a simple fillet of green leaves — ver - vain and mandrake and certain deadly herbs of which it is not fitting to speak. No w the priests of the Veiled One were sore perplexed, for that never before had any boy been chosen priestess. For be - fore the vows may be administered, the proofs of virginity are sought; and, as it seemed, this part of the ritual must be sup - pressed or gl ossed over. Then said the High Priest: “Let it be that we examine the first woman that he shall touch with his hand, and she shall suffice.” Now when I heard this, I thought to test the God; and, spying in the crowd, I beheld in loose robes with flushed f ace and wanton eyes, a certain courtesan well - known in the city, and I touched her. Then those of the priests that hated me were glad, for they wished to reject me; and taking aside into the hall of trial that woman, made the enquiry. Then with robes ren t they came running forth, crying out against the Veiled One; for they found her perfect in virginity, and so was she even unto her death, as latter appeared."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"ACROSS THE GULF 307 But the Veiled One was wroth with them because of this, and appeared in her glittering veil upon the steps of her temple. There she stood, and called them one by one; and she lifted but the eye - piece of her veil and looked into their eyes; and dead they fell before her as if smitten of the light - ning. But those priests who were friendly to me and l oyal to the goddess took that virgin courtesan, and led her in triumph through the city, veiled and crowned as is befitting. Now after some days he that guarded the sacred goat of Khem died, and they appointed her in his place. And she was the first woma n that was thus honoured since the days of the Evil Queen in the Eighteenth Dynasty, of her that wearied of men at an age when other women have not known them, that gave herself to gods and beasts. But now they took me to the pool of liquid silver — or so t hey called it; I suppose it was quicksilver; for I remember that it was very difficult to immerse me — which is beneath the feet of the Veiled One. For this is the secret of the Oracle. Standing afar off the priest beholds the reflection of her in the mirro r, seeing her lips that move under the veil; and this he interprets to the seeker after truth. Thus the priest reads wrongly the silence of the Goddess, and the seeker understands ill the speech of the priest. Then come forth fools, saying “The Goddess h ath lied” — and in their folly they die. While, therefore, they held me beneath the surface of the pool, the High Priestess took the vows on my behalf saying: I swear by the orb of the Moon; I swear by the circuit of the Stars;"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 308 I swear by the Veil, and b y the Face behind the Veil; I swear by the Light Invisible, and by the Visible Darkness; On behalf of this Virgin that is buried in thy water; To live in purity and service; To love in beauty and truth; To guard the Veil from the profane; To die befor e the Veil; . . . — and then came the awful penalty of failure. I dare not recall half of it; yet in it were these words: Let her be torn by the Phallus of Set, and let her bowels be devoured by Apep; let her be prostituted to the lust of Besz, and let he r face be eaten by the god —— . It is not good to write His name. Then they loosed me, and I lay smiling in the pool. They lifted me up and brought me to the feet of the goddess, so that I might kiss them. And as I kissed them such a thrill ran through me that I thought myself rapt away into the heaven of Amoun, or even as Asi when Hoor and Hoor - pa - kraat, cleaving her womb, sprang armed to life. Then they stripped me of my robes, and lashed me with fine twigs of virgin hazel, until my blood ran from me into the pool. But the surface of the silver swallowed up the blood by some mysterious energy; and they took this to be a sign of acceptance. So then they clothed me in the right robes of a priestess of the Veiled One; and they put a silver sistron in my hand, and bade me perform the ceremony of adoration. This I did, and the veil of the goddess glittered in the darkness — for night had fallen by this — with a strange starry light. Thereby it was known that I was indeed chosen aright. So last of all they t ook me to the banqueting - house and"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"ACROSS THE GULF 309 set me on the high throne. One by one the priests came by and kissed my lips: one by one the priestesses came by, and gave me the secret clasp of hands that hath hidden virtue. And the banquet waxed merry; for all the food was magically prepared. Every beast that they slew was virgin; every plant that they plucked had been grown and tended by virgins in the gardens of the temple. Also the wine was spring water only, but so consecrated by the holy priestesses that one glass was more intoxicating that a whole skin of common wine. Yet this intoxication was a pure delight, an enthusiasm wholly divine; and it gave strength, and did away with sleep, and left no sorrow. Last, as the first gray glow of Hormakhu paled the dee p indigo of the night, they crowned and clothed me with white lotus flowers, and took me joyously back into the temple, there to celebrate the matin ritual of awakening the Veiled One. Thus, and not otherwise, I became priestess of that holy goddess, and for a little while my life passed calm as the unruffled mirror itself. It was from the Veiled One herself that came the Breath of Change. On this wise. In the Seventh Equinox after my initiation into her mystery the High Priestess was found to fail; at her invocation the Veil no longer glittered as was its wont. For this they deemed her impure, and resorted to many ceremonies, but without avail. At last in despair she went to the temple of Set, and gave herself as a victim to that dreadful god. Now all m en were much disturbed at this, and it was not known at all of them what they should do."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 310 Now it must be remembered that the ceremonies are always performed by a single priestess alone before the goddess, save only at the Initiations. The others also had found themselves rejected of her; and when they learnt of the terrible end of the High Priestess, they became fearful. Some few, indeed, concealed their failure from the priests; but always within a day and a night they were found torn asunder in the outer courts; so that it seemed the lesser evil to speak truth. Moreover, the affair had become a public scandal; for the goddess plagued the people with famine and with a terrible and foul disease. But as for me, I wot not what to do; for to me always the Ve il glittered, and that brighter than the ordinary. Yet I said nothing, but went about drooping and sorrowful, as if I were as unfortunate as they. For I would not seem to boast of the favour of the goddess. Then they sent to the old Magus in the well; and he laughed outright at their beards, and would say no word. Also they sent to the sacred goat of Khem, and his priestess would but answer, “I, and such as I, may be favoured of Her,” which they took for ribaldry and mocking. A third time they sent to th e temple of Thoth the Ibis god of wisdom. And Thoth answered them by this riddle: “On how many legs doth mine Ibis stand?” And they understood him not. But the old High priest determined to solve the mystery, though he paid forfeit with his life. So con cealing himself in the temple, he watched in the pool for the reflection of the glittering of the Veil, while one by one we performed the"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"ACROSS THE GULF 311 adorations. And behind him and without stood the priests, watching for him to make a sign. This we knew not; but whe n it fell to me (the last) to adore that Veiled One, behold! the Veil glittered, and the old Priest threw up his arms to signal that which had occurred. And the flash of the eye pierced the Veil, and he fell from his place dead upon the priests without. They buried him with much honour, for that he had given his life for the people and for the temple, to bring back the favour of the Veiled One. Then came they all very humbly unto me the child, and besought me to interpret the will of the Goddess. And he r will was that I alone should serve her day and night. Then they gave me to drink of the Cup of the torment; and this is its virtue, that if one should speak falsely, invoking the name of the goddess, he shall burn in hell visibly before all men for a th ousand years; and that flame shall never be put out. There is such an one in her temple in Memphis, for I saw it with these eyes. There he burns and writhes and shrieks on the cold marble floor; and there he shall burn till his time expire, and he sink t o that more dreadful hell below the West. But I drank thereof, and the celestial dew stood shining on my skin, and a coolness ineffable thrilled through me; whereat they all rejoiced, and obeyed the voice of the Goddess that I had declared unto them. Now then was I alway alone with that Veiled One, and I must enter most fully into that secret period of my life. For, despite its ending, which hath put many wise men to shame, it was to me even as an eternity of rapture, of striving and of attainment beyond that which most mortals — and they initiates even! — call divine."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 312 Now first let it be understood what is the ritual of adoration of our Lady the Veiled One. First, the priestess performs a mystical dance, by which all beings whatsoever, be they dogs or demo ns, are banished, so that the place may be pure. Next, in another dance, even more secret and sublime, the presence of the goddess is invoked into her Image. Next, the priestess goes a certain journey, passing the shrines of many great and terrible of th e Lords of Khem, and saluting them. Last, she assumes the very self of the Goddess; and if this be duly done, the Veil glittereth responsive. Therefore, if the Veil glittereth not, one may know that in some way the priestess hath failed to identify herse lf with Her. Thus an impurity in the thought of the priestess must cause her to fail; for the goddess is utterly pure. Yet the task is alway difficult; for with the other gods one knoweth the appearance of their images; and steadily con - templating these one can easily attain to their imitation, and so to their comprehension, and to unity of consciousness with them. But with Our Veiled One, none who hath seen her face hath lived long enough to say one word, or call one cry. So then it was of vital urge ncy to me to keep in perfect sympathy with that pure soul, so calm, so strong. With what terror then did I regard myself when, looking into my own soul, I saw no longer that perfect stillness. Strange was it, even as if one should see a lake stirred by a wind that one did not feel upon the cheeks and brow! Trembling and ashamed, I went to the vesper adoration.

And the favour of her was restored to the people, so that all men were glad thereof. For if any man murmured, he was slain incontinent, the people being mindful of the famine and the disease, and being minded to have no more of such, if it could by any means be avoided. They were therefore exceeding punctual with their gifts. But I was daily more afraid, being in a great sweat of passion, of which I dared to speak to no man. Nor did I dare to speak even privily in mine own heart thereof, lest I should discover its nature. But I sent my fa vourite, the virgin Istarah (slim, pallid, and trembling as a young lotus in the West Wind), with my ring of office, to enquire of the old Magus of the well. And he answered her by pointing upward to the sky and then downward to the earth. And I read thi s Oracle as if it were spoken “As above, so beneath.” This came to me as I had flung myself in despair at the feet of my Lady, covering them with my tears; for by a certain manifest token I now knew that I had done a thing that was so dreadful that even n ow — these many thousand years hence — I dare hardly write it.

Even as I knew this by the manifest token the Veil burst into a devouring fla me; it ate up the robes of my office, lapping them with its tongues of fire like a tigress lapping blood; yet withal it burnt me not, nor singed one hair. Thus naked I fled away in fear, and in my madness slipped and fell into the pool of liquid silver, s plashing it all over the hall; and even as I fled that rosy cataract of flame that wrapt me (from the Veil as it jetted) went out — went out — The Veil was a dull web of gold, no more. Then I crept fearfully to the feet of the goddess, and with my tears and kisses sought to wake her into life once more. But the Veil flamed not again; only a mist gathered about it and filled the temple, and hid all things from my eyes. Now then came Istarah my favourite back with the ring and the message; and thinking that s he brought bad news, I slit her lamb's - throat with the magic sickle, and her asp's - tongue I tore out with my hands, and threw it to the dogs and jackals. Herein I erred sorely, for her news was good. Having reflected thereon, I perceived its import. For since the Veil flamed always at my assumption, it was sure that I was in sympathy with that holy Veiled One. If I were troubled, and knew not why; if my long peace were stirred — why then, so She! \"As above, so beneath!\" For even as I, being man, sought t o grasp godhead and crush it in my arms, so She, the pure essence, sought to manifest in form by love.

And lo! the Ve il flamed. Then I knew that She too blamed Herself alike for her ardour and for her abstinence. Thus seven days I lay, never stirring; and all that time the Veil flamed subtly and softly, a steady bluish glow changing to green as my thought changed from melancholy to desire. Then on the eight day I rose and left the shrine and clad myself in new robes, in robes of scarlet and gold, with a crown of vine and bay and laurel and cypress. Also I purified myself and proclaimed a banquet. And I made the pries ts and the citizens, exceeding drunken. Then I called the guard, and purged thoroughly the whole temple of all of them, charging the captain on his life to let no man pass within. So that I should be absolutely alone in the whole precincts of the temple. Then like an old gray wolf I wandered round the outer court, lifting up my voice in a mournful howl. And an ululation as of one hundred thousand wolves answered me, yet deep and muffled, as though it came from the very bowels of the earth. Then at the hour of midnight I entered again the shrine and performed the ritual. As I went on I became inflamed with an infinite lust for the Infinite; and now I let it leap unchecked, a very lion. Even so the Veil glowed red as with some infernal fire.

Her mouth moaned, her throat sobbed with love; her tongue thrust itself into me as a shaft of sunlight smites into the palm - groves; my robes fell shrivelled, and flesh to flesh we clung. Then in some strange way she gr ipped me body and soul, twining herself about me and within me even as Death that devoureth mortal man. Still, still my being increased; my consciousness expanded until I was all Nature seen as one, felt as one, apprehended as one, formed by me, part of m e, apart from me — all these things at one moment — and at the same time the ecstasy of love grew colossal, a tower to scale the stars, a sea to drown the sun . . .

And he recited the Formula of the Osiris as follows, even as it hath been transmitted unto us by the Brethren of the Cross and Rose unto this day: “For Asar Un - nefer hath said: He that is found perfect before the Gods hath said: These are the elements of my body, perfected through suffering, glori fied through trial.

Now, however, the old Magus clad me (for I was yet naked) in the dress of a Priest of Osiris. He gave me the robes of white Linen, and the leopard's skin, and the wand and ankh. Also he gave me the crook and scourge, and girt me with the royal girdle. On my head he set the holy Uraeus serpent for a crown; and then, turning to the people, cried aloud: “Behold the Priest of Asar in Thebai! “He shall proclaim unto y e the worship of Asar; see that ye follow him!” Then, ere one could cry “Hold!” he had vanished from our sight.

There I rejoined my body, making the magical links in the prescribed manner, and rose up and did adoration to the Osiris by the fourfold sign. Therefore the Light of Osiris bega n to dawn; it went about the city whirling forth, abounding, crying aloud; whereat the people worshipped, being abased with exceeding fear. Moreover, they hearkened unto their wise men and brought gifts of gold, so that the temple floor was heaped high; a nd gifts of oxen, so that the courts of the temple could not contain them: and gifts of slaves, as it were a mighty army. Then I withdrew myself; and taking counsel with the wisest of the priests and of the architects and of the sculptors, I gave out my o rders so that the temple might duly be builded.

Mighty was the concourse of the citizens on the great day of the consecration. Splendid rose the temple, a fortress of black granite. The columns were carved with wonderfu l images of all the gods adoring Osiris; marvels of painting glittered on the walls; they told the story of Osiris, of his birth, his life, his death at the hands of Typhon, the search after his scattered members, the birth of Horus and Harpocrates, the ve ngeance upon Typhon Seth, the resurrection of Osiris. The god himself was seated in a throne set back unto the wall. It was of lapis - lazuli and amber, it was inlaid with emerald and ruby.

For, it being unlawful for those mirrors to have ever reflected any mortal countenance, the slaves were both blinded and veiled; yet even so, it were best that they should die. At last the ceremony b egan. With splendid words, with words that shone like flames, did I consecrate all that were there present, even the whole city of Thebai.

Dark flames of lightning rent the clouds, giving no light. The thunder roared; the people were afraid. In his dark shrine the Osiris gloomed, dis - pleasure on his forehead, insulted majesty in his eyes. Then a pillar of dust whirled down from the vault of heaven, even unto me as I stood alone, half - defia nt, in the midst of the temple while the priests and the people cowered and wailed afar off. It rent the massy roof as it had been a thatch of straw, whirl - ing the blocks of granite far away into the Nile.

My brain had slipped control; I could no longer even think of the proper spells that might have brought me aid.

My tongue so swelled that I could hardly breathe; my face blackened; my eyes bulged out. The fiends came closer; drew strength from my weakness, made themselves material bodies, twitched me and spik ed me and bit me. I turned on them and struck feebly again and again; but they evaded me easily and their yelling laughter rang like hell’s in my ears. Howbeit I saw that they attacked me only on one side, as if to force me to one path. But I was wise en ough to keep my shadow steadily behind me: and they, seeing this, were all the more enraged: I therefore the more obstinate in my course.

Also she plucked me dates from the tree, and I ate thereof. Thus was I much comforted; and when I had eaten, she took my head upon her lap, and sang me to sleep; for her voice was like the ripple of the lakes under the wind of spring and like the bubbling of a well and like the tinkling of a fountain through a bed of moss. Also she had deep notes like the sea that booms upon a rocky shore. So long, long, long I slept. Now when I awoke the nymph had gone; but I took from my bosom a little casket of certain sacred herbs; and casting a few grains into the pool, repaid her for her courtesy. And I blessed her in the name of our dead lady Isis, and went on in the strength of that delicious meal for a great way. Yet I wist not what to do; for I was as it were a dead man, although my age was barely two and twenty years. What indeed should befall me? Yet I went on; and, climbing a ridge, beheld at last the broad Nile, and a shining city that I knew not.

But he, full of the news, told me that the ancient priestess of Isis, who had become priest of Osiris, had been taken up to heaven as a sign of the signal favour of the God. Whereat I could hardly hold myself from laughter; yet I controll ed myself and answered that I was not prepared to return to Memphis, for that I was vowed to Isis, and Osiris could not serve my turn. At this he begged me to stay as his guest, and to go wor - ship at the temple of Isis in this city. I agreed thereto, and the good man gave me new robes and jewels from the treasury of his own temple. There too I rested sweetly on soft cushions fanned by young boys with broad leaves of palm. Also he sent me the dancing girl of Sleep.

So then I woke at dawn, to find her still watching, still looking into my eyes with a tender smile on her mouth that cooed whispers infinitely soothing. Indeed with a soft kiss she waked me, for in this Art there is a right moment to sleep, and another to waken: which she was well skilled to divine.

Now their ritual (it appeared) differed in one point from that to which I was accustomed. Thus, it was not death to intrude upon the ceremony save only for the profane.

Also the veins of her forehead swelled, and foam came to her lips. We thought that she had died; her body swelled and shuddered; last of all a terrible c ry burst from her throat, inarticulate, awful. Yet all this while the Veil glittered, though something sombrely. Also the air was filled with a wild sweeping music, which rent our very ears with its uncouth magic. For it was like no music that I had eve r heard before. At last the Priestess tore herself away from the Veil and reeled — as one drunken — down the temple. Sighs and sobs tore her breast; and her nails made bloody grooves in her wet flanks.

Yea, by Osiris himself, I swear it! Even as the eyes of all living men revolve ceaselessly, so were mine fi xed! Then I shook myself and went forth into the city of Memphis, my face being veiled and my steps led by slaves. And there I went into the temples one by one; and I twitched aside my veil, whereat all men fell dead on the instant, and the gods tumbled from their places, and broke in pieces upon the floor. And I veiled myself, and went into the market - place and lifted up my voice in a chant and cried: Death, and desolation, and despair! I lift up my voice, and all the gods are dumb. I unveil my face, a nd all that liveth is no more, I sniff up life, and breathe forth destruction. I hear the music of the world, and its echo is Silence. Death, and desolation, and despair! The parting of the ways is come: the Equinox of the Gods is past. Another day: anothe r way. Let them that hear me be abased before me! Death, and desolation, and despair! Then I pulled away my veil, and the cold lightnings of death shot forth, and the people of the city fell dead where they stood. Save only one, a young boy, a flute - play er, that was blind, and, seeing not those eyes of mine, died not. Then to him I spake, saying: “Arise, summon the priests and the people, all that remain. And let them build a temple unto Osiris the God of the dead, and let the dead be worshipped for eve r and ever.”"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 336 This I said, and went out from the city with the two slaves that I had left in the gate, and we went unto Nile, unto a cave by the bank of the river; and there I abode for many months, weeping for Isis my Lady. For though I had avenged her in many dreadful deeds, yet I brought her not back unto life. Moreover the love of her was as it were dead in me, so that my heart stirred not at the thought of her. Say that my love wandered like a ghost unburied, frozen, adrift upon the winds! Now of my deeds at this period it is almost too horrible to tell. For I performed great penance, in the hope of vitalizing that dead principle in me which men call the soul. I starved myself shamefully, in this manner. First surrounding myself with all possible luxuries of food, brought in steaming and savoury from hour to hour, I yet condemned myself to subsist upon a little garlic and a little salt, with a little water in which oats had been bruised. Then if any wish arose in me to eat of the dainties around m e I gashed myself with a sharp stone. Moreover I kindled a great fire in the cave so that the slaves stumbled and fainted as they approached. And the smoke choked me so that I constantly vomited a black and ill - smelling mucus from my lungs, stained here and there with frothing blood. Again, I suffered my hair to grow exceeding long, and therein I harboured vermin. Also, when I lay down to sleep, though this I did not till with swollen tongue and blackened throat I could no longer howl the name of my dea d Lady, then (I say) did I smear my limbs with honey, that the rats of the cave might gnaw them as I slept. Moreover, I pillowed"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"ACROSS THE GULF 337 mine head upon a corpse dead of leprosy, and whenever that dead soul of mine stirred at all with love toward my Lady, then I caressed and kissed that corpse, and sang soft songs to it, playing with gracious words and gestures. All this spoke loudly to my soul, rebuking it for its weakness and corruption. So too the bitterness and foulness of my life would often overleap the limit of sensibility; and then for hours together would I be lost in a raging whirlwind of laughter. At this time my slaves would be afraid to come anigh me, and then darting out of the cave I would catch one by the hair and dragging him within put him to exquisite torture. This indeed was of great use to me; for I would devise atrocious things, and if they served to excite his utmost anguish I would then try them on myself. Thus I would run needles steeped in Nile mud beneath my finger - vails, so that th e sores festering might produce a sickening agony. Or again I would cut strips of skin and tear them off; but this failed, though it acted well enough upon the slave, for my own skin had become too brittle. Then I would take a piece of hard wood, and ham mer it with a stone against the bones, hurting the membrane that covers them, and causing it to swell. This too I had to abandon, for the limb of the slave died, and he swelled up and rotted and turned green, and in shocking agony he died. So then I was compelled to cure myself magically, and this was a great loss of force. Yet was I “Far from the Happy Ones,” although my lips hung on my fleshless face like bean - pods withered and blackened, and although there was not one inch of skin upon all my body tha t was not scarred."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 338 Yet my trial was nigh its end. For the people of Memphis, wondering at the frequent purchases of dead lepers made always by the same slave, began, as is the wont of the ignorant, to spread foolish rumours. At last they said openly “the re is an holy hermit in the old cave by Nile.” Then the barren women of the city came out stealthily to me in the hope that by my sanctity their dry sticks might blossom. But I showed them my dead leper, and said “Let me first beget children upon this, a nd after I will do your business.” This liked them not; yet they left me not alone, for they went home and cried out that I was an horror, a ghoul, a vampire. . . . And at that all the young and beautiful women of the city, leaving their lovers and their husbands, flocked to me, bringing gifts. But I took them to the dead leper and said, “When you are beautiful as that is beautiful, and when I am weary of its beauty and its delight, then will I do your pleasure.” Then they all raged vehemently against me , and stirred up the men of the city to destroy me. And I, not being minded to display my magic force, went by night (so soon as I heard of this) and took sanctuary in the shrine of Osiris that I had caused them to build. And there I attained felicity; f or uniting my consciousness with the god’s, I obtained the expansion of that consciousness. Is not the kingdom of the dead a mighty kingdom? So I perceived the universe as it were a single point of infinite nothingness yet of infinite extension; and beco ming this universe, I became dissolved utterly therein.

Moreover I was united with Isis the Mother of Osiris, being yet her brother and her lord. Woe, woe to me! for all this was but partial and imperfect; nor did I truly understand that which occurred. Only this I knew, that I should re turn to my city of Thebai, and rule therein as High Priest of Osiris, no longer striving to some end unheard - of or impossible, but quietly and patiently living in the enjoyment of my dignities and wealth, even as a man. Yet one thing I saw also, that as I sis is the Lady of all Nature, the living; and as Osiris is the Lord of the Dead, so should Horus come, the Hawk - headed Lord, as a young child, the image of all Nature and all Man raised above Life and Death, under the supreme rule of Hadit that is Force a nd of Nuit that is Matter — though they are a Matter and a Force that transcend all our human conceptions of these things.

So scarred and altered was I, though not yet thirty years of age, that they knew me not. So I offered myself as a serving - man in the temple of Osiris, and I pleased the priests mightily, for by my magic power — though they thought it to be natural — I sang songs unto the god, and made hymns. Therefore in less than a year they began to speak of initiating me into the priesthood. Now the High Priest at this time was a young and vigorous man, black - bearded in the fashion of Osiris, with a single square tuft beneath the chin. Him had they chosen after my departure in the whirlwind. And the High Priestess was a woman of forty and two years old, both dark and beautiful, with flashing eyes and stern lips. Yet her body was slim and lithe like that of a young girl. Now, as it chanced, it was my turn to serve her with the funeral offerings; flesh of oxen and of geese, bread, and wine. And as she ate she spake with me; for she could see by her art that I was not a common serving - man. Then I took out the consecrated Wand of Khem that I had from my father; and I placed it in her hand. At that she wondered, for that Wand is the sign of a great and holy initiation: so rare that (as they say) no woman but one has ever attained unto it. Then she blessed herself that she had been permitted to look upon it, and pray ed me to keep silence"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"ACROSS THE GULF 341 for a little while, for she had somewhat in her mind to do. And I lifted up the wand upon her in the nine - and - forty - fold benediction, and she received illumination thereof, and rejoiced. Then I fell at her feet — for she was the High P riestess — and kissed them reverently, and withdrew. Then three days afterwards, as I learnt, she sent for a priestess who was skilled in certain deadly crafts and asked of her a poison. And she gave it, saying: “Let the High Priest of the God of the dead g o down to the dead!” Then that wicked High Priestess conveyed unto him subtly the poison in the sacraments themselves, and he died thereof. Then by her subtlety she caused a certain youth to be made high priest who was slovenly and stupid, thinking in he rself “Surely the god will reject him.” But at his word the Image of the god glowed as was its wont. And at that she knew — and we all knew — that the glory was departed; for that the priests had supplanted the right ceremony by some trick of deceit and craf t. Thereat was she mightily cast down, for though wicked and ambitious, she had yet much power and knowledge. But instead of using that power and that knowledge she sought to oppose craft with craft. And suspecting (aright) whose cunning had done this t hing she bribed him to reverse the machinery, so that the High Priest might be shamed. But shamed he was not; for he lied, saying that the God glowed brighter than the Sun; and he lied securely, for Maat the Lady of Truth had no place in that temple. To such foulness was all fallen by my first failure to assume the god - form, and their priestly falsehood that my sanctity had rapt me into heaven. Nor had the wealth they lied to obtain availed them"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 342 aught; for Pharaoh had descended upon Thebai, and laid heav y hand upon the coffers of the temple, so that they were poor. Even, they sold good auguries for gold; and these were a very destruction to them that bought. Then they sold curses, and sowed discord in the city. Wherefore the people grew poorer still, a nd their gifts to the temple waxed even less. For there is no foolishness like the hunger after gain. Of old the gods had given blessing, and the people offered freely of their plenty. Now the priests sowed chaff, and reaped but barrenness. So I waited patiently in silence to see what might befall. And this foolish priestess could think of no better expedient than formerly. But this young stupid man had guessed how his predecessor was dead, and he touched not the sacraments; but feigned. Then she call ed for me — and I was now ordained priest — to take counsel of me; for she was minded to put me in his place. Thus she made a great banquet for me; and when we were well drunken she laid her head upon my breast and said mar - vellous things to me of love, to me , who had loved the Veiled One! But I feigned all the madness of passion and made her drunk thereon, so that she talked great words, frothing forth like dead fishes swollen in the sun, of how we should rule Thebai and (it might be) displace Pharaoh and ta ke his throne and sceptre.

Yet so drunken was she upon love and wine that there and then she performed the ritual of Adoration and Assumption. Then I in merry mood put out my power, and caused her in truth to become Osiris, so that she went icy stark, and her eyes fixed. . . . Then she tried to shriek with fear, and could not; for I had put upon her the silence of the tomb. But all the while I feigned wonder and applause, so that she was utterly deceived. And being tired of mocking her, I bade her return. This s he did, and knew not what to say. At first she pretended to have received a great secret; then, knowing how much higher was my grade of initiation, dared not. Then, at last, being frightened, she flung herself at my feet and confessed all, pleading that at least her love for me was true. This may well have been; in any case I would have had compassion upon her, for in sooth her body was like a flower, white and pure, though her mouth was heavy and strong, her eyes wrinkled with lust, and her cheeks flacc id with deceit. So I comforted her, pressing her soft body in mine arms, drinking the wine of her eyes, feeding upon the honey of her mouth. Then at last I counselled her that she should bid him to a secret banquet, and that I should serve them, disguise d in my old dress as a serving - man. On the next night after this he came, and I served them, and she made open love (though feigned) to him. Yet subtly, so that he thought her the deer and himself the lion. Then at last he went clean mad, and said: “I wi ll give thee what thou"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 344 wilt for one kiss of that thy marvellous mouth.” Then she made him swear the oath by Pharaoh — the which if he broke Pharaoh would have his head — and she kissed him once, as if her passion were like the passion of Nile in flood for the sandy bars that it devoureth, and then leaping up, answered him, “give me thine office of High Priest for this my lover!” With that she took and fondled me. He gaped, aghast; then he took off the ring of office and flung it at her feet; he spat one word in her face; he slunk away. But I, picking up the ring of office, cried after him: “What shall be done to who insulteth the High Priestess?” And he turned and answered sullenly: “I was the High Priest.” “Thou hadst no longer the ring!” she raged at him, her face white with fury, her mouth dripping the foam of her anger — for the word was a vile word! . . . Then she smote upon the bell, and the guard appeared. At her order they brought the instruments of death, and sum - moned the executioner, and left us th ere. Then the execu - tioner bound him to the wheel of iron by his ankles and his waist and his throat; and he cut off his eyelids, that he might look upon his death. Then with his shears he cut off the lips from him, saying, “With these lips didst thou bl aspheme the Holy One, the Bride of Osiris.” Then one by one he wrenched out the teeth of him, saying every time: “With this tooth didst thou frame a blasphemy against the Holy One, the Bride of Osiris.” Then he pulled out the tongue with his pincers, say ing: “With this tongue didst thou speak blasphemy against the Holy One, the Bride of Osiris.” Then took he a strong corrosive acid and blistered his throat therewith, say - ing: “From this throat didst thou blaspheme the Holy One,"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"ACROSS THE GULF 345 the Bride of Osiris.” T hen he took a rod of steel, white - hot, and burnt away his secret parts, saying: “Be thou put to shame, who hast blasphemed the Holy One, the Bride of Osiris.” After that, he took a young jackal and gave it to eat at his liver, saying: “Let the beasts tha t devour carrion devour the liver that lifted itself up to blaspheme the Holy One, the Bride of Osiris!” With that the wretch died, and they exposed his body in the ditch of the city, and the dogs devoured it. Now all this while had my lady dallied amor ously with me, making such sweet moan of love as never was, yet her face fixed upon his eyes who loved her, and there glared in hell's torment, the body ever striving against the soul which should exceed. And, as I judge, by the favour of Set the soul gat mastery therein. Also, though I write it now, coldly, these many thousand years afterward, never had I such joy of love of any woman as with her, and at that hour, so that as I write it I remember well across the mist of time every honey word she spoke, every witching kiss (our mouths strained sideways) that she sucked from my fainting lips, every shudder of her soft strong body. I remember the jewelled coils of hair, how they stung like adders as they touched me; the sharp rapture of her pointed nails pr essing me, now velvet - soft, now capricious - cruel, now (love - maddened) thrust deep to draw blood, as they played up and down my spine.

One would have said: the end of the world is come. But through all th at fiery abyss of sleep wherein I was plunged so deep, still stirred the cool delight of the knowledge that I had won the hand for which I played, that I was High Priest of Osiris in Thebai. But in the morning we rose and loathed each other, our mouths aw ry, our tongues hanging loose from their corners like thirsty dogs, our eyes blinking in agony from the torture of daylight, our limbs sticky with stale sweat. Therefore we rose and saluted each other in the dignity of our high offices; and we departed on e from the other, and purified ourselves. Then I went unto the Ceremony of Osiris, and for the last time the shameful farce was played. But in my heart I vowed secretly to cleanse the temple of its chicanery and folly. Therefore at the end of the ceremo ny did I perform a mighty banishing, a banishing of all things mortal and immortal, even from Nuit that circleth infinite Space unto Hadit the Core of Things; from Amoun that ruleth before all the Gods unto Python the terrible Serpent that abideth at the e nd of things, from Ptah the god of the pure soul of aethyr unto Besz the brute force of that which is grosser than earth, which hath no name, which is denser than"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"ACROSS THE GULF 347 lead and more rigid than steel; which is blacker than the thick darkness of the abyss, yet is within all and about all.

Yea! bitterly would I avenge him on the morrow."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"348 CHAPTER IX N OW this was the manner of my working, that I inspired the High Priestess to an Oracle, so that she prophesied, saying that Osiris should never be content with his servants unless they had passed the four ordeals of the elements. Now of old these rituals h ad been reserved for a special grade of initiation. The chapter was therefore not a little alarmed, until they remembered how shamefully all the true magic was imitated, so that the rumour went that this was but a device of the High Priestess to increase the reputation of the temple for sanctity. And, their folly confirming them in this, they agreed cheerfully and boasted themselves. Now then did I swathe them one by one in the grave - clothes of Osiris, binding upon the breast and image, truly consecrated , of the god, with a talisman against the four elements. Then I set them one by one upon a narrow and lofty tower, balanced, so that the least breath of wind would blow them off into destruction. Those whom the air spared I next threw into Nile where mos t it foams and races. Only a few the water gave back again. These, however, did I bury for three days in the earth without sepulchre or coffin, so that the element of earth might combat them. And the rare ones whom earth spared I cast upon a fire of cha rcoal."},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"ACROSS THE GULF 349 Now who is prepared for these ordeals (being firstly attuned to the elements) findeth them easy. He remains still, though the tempest rage upon the tower; in the water he floats easily and lightly; buried, he but throws himself into trance; and, l astly, his wrappings protect him against the fire, though all Thebai went to feed the blaze. But it was not so with this bastard priesthood of Osiris. For of the three hundred only nine were found worthy. The High Priestess, however, I brought through by my magic, for she had amused me mightily, and I took great pleasure in her love, that was wilder than the rage of all the elements in one. So I called together the nine who had survived, all being men, and gave them instruction and counsel, that they should form a secret brotherhood to learn and to teach the formula of the Osiris in its supreme function of initiating the human soul. That they should keep discipline in the temple only for the sake of the people, permitting every corruption yet with - draw ing themselves from it. Is not the body perishable, and the skin most pure? So also the ancient practice of embalming should fall into desuetude, and that soon; for the world was past under the rule of Osiris, who loveth the charnel and the tomb. All bei ng sworn duly into this secret brotherhood I appointed them, one to preside over each grade, and him of the lowest grade to select the candidates and to govern the temple. Then did I perform the invoking Ceremony of Osiris, having destroyed the blasphemou s machinery; and now at last did the God answer me, glittering with infinite brilliance."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 350 Then I disclosed myself to the Priests, and they rejoiced exceedingly that after all those years the old lie was abolished, and the master come back to his own. But t he god uttered an Oracle, saying: “This last time shall I glitter with brilliance in My temple; for I am the god of Life in Death, concealed. Therefore shall your magic henceforth be a magic most secret in the heart; and whoso shall perform openly any mir acle, him shall ye know for a liar and a pretender to the sacred Wisdom. “For this cause am I wrapped ever in a shroud of white starred with the three active colours; these things conceal Me, so that he who knoweth Me hath passed beyond them.” Then did th e god call us each separately to him, and in each ear did he whisper a secret formula and a word of power, pertaining to the grade to which I had appointed him. But to me he gave the supreme formula and the supreme word, the word that hath eight - and - seven ty letters, the formula that hath five - and - sixty limbs. So then I devoted myself there and then to a completer understanding of Osiris my God, so that I might discover his function in the whole course of the Cosmos. For he that is born in the years of th e power of a God thinketh that God to be eternal, one, alone. But he that is born in the hour of the weakness of the God, at the death of one and the birth of the other, seeth something (though it be little) of the course of things. And for him it is nec essary to understand fully that change of office (for the gods neither die nor are re - born, but now one initiates and the other guards, and now one heralds and the other sanctifies) its purpose and meaning in the whole scheme of things."},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"ACROSS THE GULF 351 So I, in this year V of the Equinox of the Gods ( 1908 ) wherein Horus took the place of Osiris, will by the light of this my magical memory seek to understand fully the formula of Horus — Ra Hoor Khuit — my god, that ruleth the world under Nuit and Hadit.

So now th e service of the Gods was to be secret and their magic concealed from men. They were to fall before the eyes of men from their place, and little sewer - rats were to come and mock at them, no man avenging them, and they utterly careless, not striking for th emselves. Yet was there knowledge of them which an initiate might gain, though so much more difficult, immeasurably higher and more intimate. My life from this moment became highly concentrated upon itself. I had no time either for ascetic practices or for any pleasures; nor would I take any active part in the service of the temple which, purified and regenerated, had become both subtly perfect and perfectly subtle. It was not all of the people who did at all comprehend the change that had occurred; but the others obeyed and made believe to understand, lest their fellows should despise them. So it happened that the more ignorant and stupid any person was the more he feigned understanding; so that the least devout appeared the most devout — as it is unto t his day.

These were interpreted by wise men an d translated into the language of the twilight and graven on stone and in the memories of men.

He saw the flower of the earth throughout all time, the gracious Greeks, what gracious gods they had invented. He saw Rome, in its strength devoted to Jupiter and Hercules, in its decay turning to emasculate Attis, slain Adonis, murdere d Osiris, crucified Christ. He could even trace in his own life every aspiration, every devotion, as a reflection of his physical and intellectual needs. He saw, too, the folly of all this supernaturalism. He heard the Boers and the British pray to the same Protestant God, and it occurred to him that the early successes of the former might be due rather to superior valour than to superior praying power, and their eventual defeat to the circumstance that they could only bring 60,000 men against a quarter of a million. He saw, too, the face of humanity mired in its own blood that dripped from the leeches of religion fastened to its temples. In all this he saw man as the only thing worth holding to; the one thing that needed to be “saved,” but also the one thing that could save it. All that he had attained, then, he abandoned. The intui - tions of the Qabalah were cast behind him with a smile at his youthful folly; magic, if true, led nowhere; Yoga had become psychology. For the solution of his original pro blems of the universe he looked to metaphysics; he devoted his intellect to the cult of absolute reason. He took up once more with Kant, Hume, Spencer, Huxley, Tyndall, Maudsley, Mansel, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, and many another; while as for his life, was he not a man? He had a wife; he knew his duty to the race, and to his own ancient graft thereof. He was a traveller and a sportsman; very well, then, live it!

What's the good of it?” We find him climbing mountains, skating, fishing, hunting big game, fulfilling the duties of a husband; we find him with the antipathy to all forms of spiritual thought and work which marks disa ppointment. If one goes up the wrong mountain by mistake, as may happen, no beauties of that mountain can compensate for the disillusionment when the error is laid bare. Leah may have been a very nice girl indeed, but Jacob never cared for her after th at terrible awakening to find her face on the pillow when, after seven years toil, he wanted the expected Rachel. So Fra. P., after five years barking up the wrong tree, had lost interest in trees altogether as far as climbing them was concerned. He mi ght indulge in a little human pride: “See, Jack, that's the branch I cut my name on when I was a boy”; but even had he seen in the forest the Tree of Life itself with the golden fruit of Eternity in its branches, he would have done no more than lift his gu n and shoot pigeon that flitted through its foliage.

Of these we have several examples. Two are dramatisations of Greek mythology, a subject offering every opportunity to the occultist. Both are markedly free from a ny such allusions. We have also a slim booklet in which the joys of pure human love are pictured without the faintest tinge of mystic emotion. Further, we have a play in which the Origin of Religion, as conceived by Spencer or Frazer, is dramatically sho wn forth; and lastly we have a satire, hard, cynical, and brutal in its estimate of society, but careless of any remedy for its ills. It is as if the whole past of the man with all its aspiration and attainment was blotted out. He saw life (for the first time, perhaps) with commonplace human eyes. Cynicism he could understand, romance he could understand; all beyond was dark. Happiness was the bedfellow of contempt. As to miracles and prophecies, he was as sceptical as the famous Pope of Rome who “didn't believe in them; he had seen too many.” If an angel had appeared to him, he would have explained him away as cheerily as the late Frank Podmore. He was as ready to acquiesce in the unhistoricity of Gotama as in that of Jesus. If he called himself a Bud dhist, it was the agnostic and atheistic philosophy and the acentric nominalist psychology that attracted him. The precepts and practices of Buddhism earned only his dislike and contempt. We learn that, late in 1903 , he was proposing to visit China on a s porting expedition when a certain very commonplace com - munication made to him by his wife caused him to postpone it. “Let's go and kill something for a month or two,” said he, “and if you're right, we'll get back to nurses and doctors.”"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 363 So we find them in Hambantota, the south - eastern province of Ceylon, occupied solely with buffalo, elephant, leopard, sambhur, and the hundred other objects of the chase.

However, nothing of which he was not certain will be entered in this place. We have one quite unspoiled and authoritative document “The Book of Resul ts,” written in one of the small Japanese vellum note - books which he used to carry.

We are uncertain.) The revea ling of the ritual (by W. the seer) consisted chiefly in a prohibition of all formulae hitherto used, as will be seen from the text printed below.

He remembers that he only agreed to obey her in order to show her how silly she was, and he taunted her that “nothing could happen if you broke all the rules.” Here therefore we insert a short note of Fra.

But we know that she was perfectly ignorant of the subtle correspondences, which were only existing at that time in Fr. P.'s own brain. And even it it were so, how are we to explain what followed — the discovery of the Stélé of Revealing? To apply test 4 , Fra. P. took her to the museum at Boulak, which they had not previously visited. She passed by (as P. noted with silent glee) several images of Horus. They went upstairs. A glass case stood in the distance, too far off for its contents to be recognize d. But W. recognised it! “There,” she cried, “There he is!” Fra. P. advanced to the case. There was the image of Horus in the form of Ra Hoor Khuit painted upon a wooden stélé of the 26 th dynasty — and the exhibit bore the number 666 ! (And after that it was five years before Fra. P. was forced to obedience.) This incident must have occurred before the 23rd of March, as the entry on that date refers to Ankh - f - n - khonsu. Here is P.'s description of the stele. “In the museum at Cairo, No. 666 is the stele of the Priest Ankh - f - n - khonsu. Horus has a red Disk and green Uraeus. 1 We may add, too, that Fra.

This should not be understood in the spiritualistic sense. It means that in each person is the sublime starry nature, a consciousness to be attained by the prescribed methods. [Yet it may mean some real connection between a given person and a given star. Why not? Still, this is not in my knowledge. See Lib. 418 .] 4 . The limited is a mere mask; the illimitable is the only truth. 5 . Nu, to unveil her self, needs a mortal intermediary, in the first instance. It is to be supposed that Ankh - f - n - khonsu, the warrior lord of Thebes, priest of Men Tu, is in some subtle manner identical with either Aiwass or the Beast. 6 .

The doctrine here taught is that the Light is innermost, essential man. Intra (not Extra) Nobis Regnum Dei. 9 . That Khabs is declared to be the light of Nu. It being worshipped in the cen tre, the light also fills the circumference, so that all is light. 10 . This is the rule of Thelema, that its adepts shall be invisible rulers. This, it may be remarked, has always been the case. 11 . “The many and the known,” both among Gods and men, are re vered; this is folly. 12 . The Key of the worship of Nu. The uniting of consciousness with infinite space by the exercise of love, pastoral or pagan love. But vide infra . 13 . This doctrine implies some mystic bond which I imagine is only to be understood by experience; this human ecstasy and that divine ecstasy interact. A similar doctrine is to be found in the Bhagavad Gita. 14 . This verse is a direct translation of the first section of the stele. It conceals a certain secret ritual, of the highest rank, connected with the two previous verses. 15 . The authority of the Beast rests upon this verse; but it is to be taken in conjunction with certain later verses which I shall leave to the research of students to interpret. I am inclined, however, to believe that “the Beast” and “the Scarlet Woman” do not denote persons, but are titles of office, that of Hierophant and High Priestess ( w and g ), else it would be difficult to understand the next verse. 16 . In II. 16 we find that Had is to be taken as 11 (see II. 16 , comment). Then Hadit = 421 , Nuit = 466 . 421 - 3 (the moon) = 418 . 466 + 200 (the sun) = 666 . These are the two great numbers of the Qabalistic system that enabled me to interpret the signs leading to this revelation. The winged secret flame is Hadit; the stooping starlight is Nuit; these are their true natures, and their functions in the supreme ritual referred to above. 17 . “Ye” refers to the other worshippers of Nuit, who must seek out their own election. 18 .

The prophet demanding a sign of his m ission, it is promised: a Samadhi upon the Infinite. This promise was later fulfilled — see “The Temple of Solomon the King,” which proposes to deal with the matter in its due season. 27 - 31 . Here is a profound philosophical dogma, in a sense possibly an exp lanation and illumination of the propositions in “Berashith.” The dyad (or universe) is created with little pain in order to make the bliss of dissolution possible. Thus the pain of life may be atoned for by the bliss of death. This delight is, however, o nly for the chosen servants of Nu. Outsiders may be looked on much as the Cartesians looked on animals. 32 .

I only put forward this suggestion to exhibit the profundity of thought required to deal even with so plain a passage. All the meanings are true, if only the interpreter be illuminated; but if not, they are all false, even as he is false. 41, 42 . Interference with the will of an other is the great sin, for it predicates the existence of another. In this duality sorrow consists. I think that possibly the higher meaning is still attributed to “will.” 43 . No other shall say nay may mean — No - other (= Nuit) shall pronounce the word N o, uniting the aspirant with Herself by denying and so destroying that which he is. 44 . Recommends “non - attachment.” Students will understand how in meditation the mind which attaches itself to hope of success is just as bound as if it were to attach itse lf to some base material idea. It is a bond; and the aim is freedom. I recommend serious study of the word “unassuaged” which appears not very intelligible. 45 .

Asar — Isa — is now the Candidate, not the Hierophant. Hoor — see Cap. III. — is the Initiator. 50 . Our system of initiation is to be triune. For the outer, tests of labour, pain, etc. For the inner, intellectual tests. For the elect of the A ∴ A ∴ , spiritual tests. Further, the Order is not to hold lodges, but to have a chain - system. 51 . The candidate will be brought through his ordeals in divers ways. The Order is to be of freemen and nobles. 52 . But distinctions must not be made before Nuit, either intellectually, morally, or personally. Metaphysics, too, is intellectual bondage; avoid it! Otherwise one falls back to the Law of Hoor from the perfect emancipation of Nuit. This is a great mystery, only to be understood by those who have fully a ttained Nuit and her secret Initiation. 53 . The prophet is retained as the link with the lower. Again the word “assuage” used in a sense unintelligible to me. 54 , 55 , 56 to the word “child.” A prophecy, not yet (May 1909 O.S.) fulfilled, so far as I know.

These theologies reflect mystic experiences of Infinite Contraction and Expansion, while philosophically they are the two opposing Infinites whose interplay gives Finity. 3 .

Hadit is both the Maker of Illusion and its destroyer. For though His interplay with Nuit results in the production of the Fi nite, yet His withdrawing into Himself is the destruction thereof. “The axle of the wheel,\" another way of saying that He is the Core of Things. “The cube in the Circle.” Cf . Liber 418 , “The Vision and the Voice,” 30 th Æthyr. “Come unto me” is a foolish w ord; for it is I that go. That is, Hadit is everywhere; yet, being sought, he flies. The Ego cannot be found, as meditation will show. 8 . He is symbolised by Harpocrates, crowned child upon the lotus, whose shadow is called Silence. Yet His Silence is the Act of Adoration; not the dumb callousness of heaven toward man, but the supreme ritual, the Silence of the supreme Orgasm, the stilling of all Voices in the perfect rapture. 9 . Hence we pass naturally and easily to the sublime optimism of Verse 9 . The l ie is given to pessimism, not by sophistry, but by a direct knowledge. 10 . The prophet who wrote this was at this point angrily unwilling to proceed. 11 . He was compelled to do so, 12 . For the God was in him, albeit he knew it not. 13 . For so long as any k nower remains, there is no thing known. Knowledge is the loss of the Knower in the Known. “And me” (not “and I”), Hadit was the passive, which could not arise because of the existence of the Knower; “and” implying further the duality — which is Ignorance. 1 4 . Enough has been said of the Nature of Hadit, now let a riddle of L.V.X. be propounded. 15 . I am perfect, being Not ( 31 al or 61 }ya ). My number is Nine by the fools (IX. the Hermit of f and # ). With the just I am Eight. VIII., Justice g Maat l , and One in Eight, a . Which is Vital, for I am None indeed, al . The Empress d III., the King h IV., are not of me.

III. + V. = VIII., and VIII. is XI., both because of the 11 letters in Abrahadabra ( = 418 = tyj = j = 8 ), the Key Word of all this ritual, and because VIII. is not Leo, Strength, but Libra, Justice, in the Tarot (see Tarot Lecture and 777 ). 17 - 21 . This passage was again very painful to the prophet, who took it in its literal sense. But “the poor and the outcast” are the petty thoughts and the qliphothic thoughts and the sad thoughts. These must be rooted out, or the ecstasy of Hadit is not in us. They are the weeds in the Garden that starve the Flower. 22 . Hadit now identifies himself with the Kundalini, the central magical force in man. This privilege of using wine and strange drugs has been confirmed; the drugs were indeed revealed. Follows a curse against the cringing altruism of Christianity, the yielding of the self to external im pressions, the smothering of the Babe of Bliss beneath the flabby old nurse Convention. 23 . The Atheism of God. “Allah's the Atheist! He owns No Allah.” Bagh - i - Muattar. To admit God is to look up to God, and so not to be God. The curse of duality. 24 . Hermits — see v . 15 . Our ascetics enjoy, govern, conquer, love, and are not to quarrel (but see vv. 59 , 60 — Even their combats are glorious). 25 . The cant of democracy condemned. It is useless to pretend that men are equal; the facts are against it. And we are not going to stay, dull and contented as oxen, in the ruck of humanity. 26 . The Kundalini again. The mystic Union is to be practised both with Spirit and with Matter. 27 . The importance of failing to interpret these verses. Unspirituality leads us to the bird - lime of Intellect. The Hawk must not perch on any earthly bough, but remain poised in the ether. 28 - 31 . The great Curse pronounced by the Supernals against the Inferiors who arise against them. Our reasoning faculties are the toils of the labyri nth within which we are all caught. Cf . Lib. LXV. V. 59 . 32 . We have insufficient data on which to reason.

Those without our circle of ecstasy do indeed die. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. 46 . The prophet was again perplexed and troubled; for in his soul was Compassion for all beings. But though this Compassion is a feeling perhaps admirable and necessary for mortals, yet it pertains to the planes of Illusion. 47 . Hadit knows nothing of these th ings; He is pure ecstasy. 48 . Hadit has never defiled His purity with the Illusions of Sorrow, etc. Even love and pity for the fallen is an identification with it (sympathy, from sun paqein ), and therefore a contamination. 49 . Continues the curse again st the slave - soul. “Amen.” This is of the 4 , i.e . should be spelt with 4 letters (the elements), ctma not }ma . The fifth, who is invisible, is u , 70 , the Eye. Now ctma = 741 + 70 = 811 = IAO in Greek, and IAO is the Greek form of hwhy , the synthesis of the 4 elements HB: ctma . (This u is perhaps the O. in N.O.X., Liber VII. I. 40 .) 50 Cf . I. 60 . 51 . Purple — the ultra - violet ( v . 51 ), the most positive of the colours. Green — the most negative of the colours, half - way in the spectrum. The Magical Image of Had it is therefore an Eye within a coiled serpent, gleaming red — the spiritual red of c and not mere B — at the apex of the Triangle in the half circle of Nuit’s Body, and shedding spangles as of the spectrum of eight colours, including the ultra - violet but not the ultra - red; and 52 . Set above a black Veil. This verse is very difficult for anyone, either with or without morality. For what men nowadays call “Vice” is really virtue — virtus, manliness — and “Virtue” — cowardice, hypocrisy, prudery, chastity, and so on are really vices — vitia, flaws. 53 . But the prophet again disliked the writing. The God comforted him. Also he prophesied of his immediate future, which was fulfilled, and is still being fulfilled at the time (An V., ! in 20 ° d ) of this writing.

At the ecstasy of this thought the prophet was rapt away by the God. First came a new strange light, His herald. 62 . Next, as Hadit himself, did he know the athletic rapture of Nuit's embrace. 63 . Each breath, as he drew it in, was an orgasm; each breath, as it went out, was a new dissolution into death. Note that throughout these books death is always spoken of as a definite experience, a delightful event i n one's career. 64 . The prophet is now completely swallowed up in the ecstasy.

The verse goes on to urge the prophet to identify himself with Hadit, to practise the Union with Nu, and to proclaim this joyful revelation unto men. 77 , 78 . Though the prophet had in a way at this time identified himself with the number 666 , he considered the magic square drawn therefrom rather silly and artificial, if indeed it had yet been devised, o n which point he is uncertain. The true Square is as follows: [It follows when it is discovered!] The House of the Prophet, not named by him, was chosen by him before he attached any meaning to the number 418 ; nor had he thought of attaching any importance to the name of the House. He supposed this passage to be mystical, or to refer to some future house. Yet on trial we obtain at once }ykclwb = 418 79 . So mote it be! III 1 . Abrahadabra — the Reward of Ra - Hoor - Khuit.

So also the Great Work, the equilibration of the 5 and the 6 , is shown in this God; fivefold as a Warrior Horus, sixfold as the solar Ra. Khuit is a name of Khem the Ram - Phallus - t wo - plume god Amon; so that the whole god represents in qabalistic symbolism the Second Triad (“whom all nations of men call the first”).

The author may be masonically justified in issuing ex cathedra , from his study chair, a new and mystic version of our old rites, but such, to be of value, must be grounded upon historic facts, and not upon the nonsense of garbled masonic histories. In the first volume the author shows an extraordinary lack of know - ledge, and hence is unable to fix his theory of an Inner and Secret Tradition upon any solid basis, and the volume, with its inflated diction, and troubled reasoning, is very un satisfactory. The second volume is much better, and is really an interesting study. In both however he does not seek to hide his con - tempt, often expressed in uncourteous language, against all who are opposed to his views, or otherwise against those degr ees from which nothing could be extracted to support his theorizing, and the writer of this review comes in, with many better men, for a slating.

This accounts for Waite's contempt of him. Imagine Walford Brodie reviewing a medical book which referred to him as an authority on paralysis!” In spite of this mild castigation he still refers to me with some contempt, and as he has so little regard for the feelings of others, generally, I may be pardoned for following suit.

The Royal Arch degree, when it had the “Three Veils” must have been the work, even if by instruction, of a Kabalistic Jew about 1740 , and from this time we may expect to find a Secret tradition, grafted upon Anderson's system; the Arch degree was, undoubtedly, developed out the the Knight of the Sword, or Red Cross, by the Harodim Templars of Clermont, an d that out of the operative Harodim. Any stupid assertion, however historically untenable, but which is supported by a large majority, is a safe stock in trade for all such writers as Bro. Waite; it pays to tickle the palate of the crowd. It would tak e up too much space to carry this further, but I will ask to point out, firsthand, some matters of general interest. (I, p. 4 ). The A. and A.S. Rite was not invented in America, it was known in Geneva several years before 1802 , when Charleston found o ut that it was of 33 Degree, and began to trade upon it. They had, however, some years before, the Morinite Rite of 25 Degree founded at Jamaica in 1767 , and not 1761 - 2 , hence anything referring to that date is false. (P. 10 ). Heredom is a French mod ification of Harodim ; even Barruel knew this. It is a term used by the Comicini builders of London, and is still in use with operative Lodges hailing from Durham. It was known to the operative Lodges of the Co. of Durham in 1735 , when two of them went u nder the G.L. of Lodon, and may be ages older than that, and identical with the “Quarter Masters” of Kelwinning, etc., under the Schau Statutes of 1598 and with the “Warden Courts” of Scotland and France, existing in 1622 , as Laurie points out. I can pro vide first - hand light as to the transliteration of the word into Heredomus, or Holy House. Many years ago, or about 1870 , I was in corres - pondence with Mr. J. W. Papworth on the subject, and he put the question to a very learned friend whom he knew at the British Museum, and who suggested to him the above derivation. As he requested that his name should not appear I sent it to the “Freemason’s Magazine,” under the signature of D , and it was at once adopted by Pike; hence the term “Holy House” is about f orty years old. I may mention that the Duke of Leinster's “Prince Mason” of Ireland,"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"REVIEWS 415 which is an amplified version of the London Rosecroix of 1770 , but very much older than that, uses the following words in presenting the Jewel of a Pelican, “You are st ill a Harodim, or Master of the workmen of the Temple,” — a Clermont echo. It seems to be everywhere kept out of sight that the Pelican feeding its young with its blood was the war banner of James III when England was invaded by him in 1715 . (P. 40 ). Ramsa y did no more in 1737 , than put his own gloss on what he learned in the Chapter of Clermont. It is true that in 1754 a change was made in the “Illustrious Knight” (Templar and Sepulchre), and an additional degree then added by an unknown de Bonneville, w hich may be a Jesuit pseudonym, which in 1758 became the 25 th degree, by adding the system of the Knights of the East, etc., and later the 32 Degree, and to which some of Ramsay's views were added; he could not have been a member of the English G.L., but w as a Jacobite Scotch Mason, and according to his own statement, made to his friend Gensau in 1741 , was born in 1680 - 1681 , and not in 1668 as given by Waite; such of these members as were voted Scotch rank by their Lodges, received the Harodim rank of Clerm ont. Thory says that these Scotch Masons in 1736 had four Lodges, and in ten years received 5,600 members. Personally, I think it likely that the Clermont claims from the Templars (Albigensian) may be just from their own operative Lodges. Fludd, rather than Ashmole, may have indoctrinated the London Masons, and I have given my reasons for this view in my American papers. (P. 295 ). Waite is mistaken in supposing that the Ordre du Temple was not established in England. There was a Convent in 1838 at L iverpool, and its members’ names are preserved. The same at London, and Sussex's consent was necessary for Reception; Dr. Robert Bigsby was a member of it, as also of Burnes’ revisal of Deuchar’s Masonic Knight Templar, which forms the basis of our 1851 r itual, which is not that of Dunckerley who worked the Clermont Templar Kadosh. There was also a Convent under the Duke of Sussex in India. (P. 312 ). In reference to Clermont Waite is floating on his own imaginary sea. Between 1688 and 1753 , Clermont had three well - known degrees of Harodim, and in 1754 a fourth was added. He quotes a garbled extract from Fratre Kristner, who is reliable, and adds a sneer against me. The Swedish Rite has knowledge that Count Scheffer was received by Derwentwater; Gra f von Schmittau; Count Posse, were Received 1737 , 1743 , 1747 . But Waite claims to be the infallible Pope, who is to judge evidence!!! (P. 322 ). Prince Adept was added to Knight of the Sun at Kingston in 1767 , in order that Morin might put in its place, the Prussian Noachite to give countenance to his frauds."},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 416 (P. 409 ). My view of HRDM - RSYCS . is that, as it now stands, it is the French Lectures of Clermont's three grades. I give my reasons for this in the “American Freemasons” papers. (II. p. 1 ). This volume, referring as it does, to more recent times, has fewer errors. It might even be extended, and earlier Hermetic details added. (P. 36 ). We here read in Waite's words of “ The thing called Co - Masonry .” I am not a Co - Mason myself, but I occ asionaly send things to the independent private quarterly termed “Co - Mason,” they are usually articles unsuited to the taste of mentally deficient Masons, or things that better informed Masons desire to hide. Again the system comes in for sarcasm owing to a supposed affinity with the Count St. Germain. We may not like Co - Masonry, for one thing, it affords less opportunity for the convivial Mason, who has no room for the intellectual part; but the system has come to stay, and we may as well treat it with c ivility. (P. 92 ). The reduced Rite of Memphis has never been so numerous as to receive respect, and Freemasons are too ignorant to understand it, and to attack it — as in Co - Masonry — may prove profitable. As a matter of fact, some mistake was made in Americ a as to the alleged reduction, but Egypt always held to the revised system of 1862 - 1866 ; at this time the Gd. Orient and the Chief of the Rite revised the whole system, mainly on an Hermetic basis, and gave to thirty - three leading ceremonies the power to confer, at intervals, the remaining sixty - two degrees which are generally added verbally in their relative places, and recently I furnished to America the necessary changes in a MS. of 200 pages. America had the Chapter degrees, 11 ° - 18 °, carefully edited, but the higher section was somewhat chaotic, and in 1872 I did not feel justified in making any great change. Bro. Waite thrice gives plates of its 90 - 95 Degree Jewel — the winged egg — but without identification. (P. 230 ). Rite of Swedenborg . Of this Ken neth Mackenzie was Grand Secretary from its introduction till his own death. Bro. Waite is quite mistaken in supposing that he had any hand in compiling the ritual; that and the Charter are in my hands as they came from Canada; the Charter is in the eng rossment of Colonel Moore, and carries the following names: Colonel W.J.B. McLeod Moore, Gd. Master of Templars, and 33 °; T.D.Harrington, Pt.G.M. of the G.L. of Canada, and 33 °; George Canning Longley, 33 °; The two first names were 33 ° Masons of the S.G .C. of Canada, then little esteemed, but founded by the Golden Square body of London; but Longley and myself were of the Martin - Cerneau body, though I have several 33 ° Patents of the Morinite Sect. Founded, as the Rite is, on a version of Ancient Masonry , carried back to a Feast of the Tabernacles, 5873 B.C., it is most interesting, but too lengthy for general use; under these circumstances I might feel inclined to print it for"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"REVIEWS 417 Master Masons, if Freemasonry was an intellectual body, but the needs of Eng lish Freemasonry, that in the best and most elaborate of works it is only working for the printer. The Rite was carried from London to the Americas, by Samuel Beswick, a Swedenborgian Minister, who wrote a book on the subject, and he informed me that they had rejected the matter added by Chastannier, and that what was left was the work of Swedenborg. Hence Bro. Waite's description of two secret and unnamed degrees, are of interest at this point. (P. 368 ). Knight or Priest of Eleusis . I have this skeleto n ritual of the Early Grand; and suppose it may be the old 1838 work of Memphis, of which Dr. Morison de Greenfield was an early member. As I look upon it the degree is intended to teach that early christianity absorbed the mysteries of Eleusis, and I me ntion this because I hear from New York that an eminent scholar, learned in Hermetic Greek, is making a translation in which he will prove that the Gospels and Epistles are pure Greek of the Eleusinian cult, and that the Jewish references are added to give a Semitic colouring. But I must conclude: I could make a decent sized volume in criticising and contesting Bro. Waite's book. J OHN Y ARKER , 33 °, 90 °, 97 ° W EST D IDSBURY , 12 / 12 / 11 . S HE B UILDETH HER H OUSE .

I have redrawn the plates for “A Brief Abstract of t he Symbolic Representation of the Universe” (a.k.a. Liber Chanokh ) and coloured the Watchtower diagrams according to the scheme in the Golden Dawn instructions (I used the planetary and zodiacal rather than elemental colours for Great Cross squares largely for æsthetic reasons). The version of the Enochian Alphabet in Plate IX does not follow that originally printed but is rather based closely on scans of the corrected final forms of the letters from a facsimile of the Dee diaries (it is available as a Tru eType font, along with the Alphabet of Daggers from The Vision and the Voice , and other magical scripts, at http://www.geocities.com/nu_isis/fonts.html ) . In the Table of Æthyrs I have added index numbers for the column “Names of Governers” (the 91 “Parts of the Earth as imposed by God) which numbers match the numbers of the sigils on Plate X.

In the Weiser facsimile the single foldout plate was replaced with a reproduction of the MS reduced with four pages of the MS to each printed page (each chapter beginning a new page). In any case, the original printing was even less legible than that in the Weiser reprint, and probably not much more so than the scans in this electronic edition. On the next pages there follows a transcription of th e MS, noting apparent changes, based on one prepared (I believe) by Bill Heidrick who did the key - entry for most of the online Equinox .
