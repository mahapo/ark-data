The central figure ofthis history was a monk Fr. R. C. — described in the earliest Rosicrucianmanifesto the Fama Fraternitatis as the “pious, spiritual and highlyilluminatedFather ... It is said that he was a German nobleman who had been educated in aconvent, and that long before the time of the Reformation he had made apilgrimage to the Holy Land in company with another brother of this convent, andthat while at Damascus they had been initiated by some learned Arabs into themysteries of the secret science. After remaining three years at Damascus, theywent to Fez, in Africa, and there they obtained still more knowledge of magic,and of the relations existing between the macrocosm and microcosm. After havingalso travelled in Spain, he returned to Germany, where he founded a kind ofconvent called Sanctus Spiritus, and remained there writing his secret scienceand continuing his studies. He then accepted as his assistants, at first, three,and afterwards, four more monks from the same convent in which he had<i3>been educated, and thus founded the first society of the Rosicrucians. They thenlaid down the results of their science in books, which are said to be still inexistence, and in the hands of some Rosicrucians. ft is then said that 120 yearsafter his death, the entrance to his tomb was discovered. A stair-case led intoa subterranean vault, at the door of which was written, Post annos CXX patebo.There was a light burning in the vault, which, however, became extinct as soonas it was approached. The vault had seven sides and seven angles, each sidebeing five feet wide and eight feet high. The upper part represented thefirmament, the floor, the earth, and they were laid out in triangles, while eachside was divided into ten squares. In the middle was an altar, bearing a brassplate, upon which were engraved the letters, A-C. R.C., and the words HocUniversi Compendium vivus mihiSepulchrum feci. In the midst were four figuressurrounded by the words, Nequaquam Vacuum. Legis Jugum. Libertas Evangelii. DeiGloria Intacta. Below the altar was found the body of Rosenkreutz, intact, andwithout any signs of putrefaction. In his hand was a book of parchment, withgolden letters marked on the cover with a 'V, and at the end was written, Ex Deonascimur. In Jesus morimur. Per Spiritum Sanctum reviviscimus.”It was upon this schema and from this original body, to state it briefly, thatthe Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn claimed direct descent. Its historylecture, however, volunteered very few verifiable details as to the historicalfacts which, from the scholarly point of view, we should be acquainted with—thedetails for example of the line of descent from, say, 1614 to 1865. Current<H>within the present day Order was the belief that at various dates within theperiod named, the Order as an organised body of students ceased to exist.Instead, there was an oral continuation of teaching from isolated initiateshere, there and everywhere, until more recent times when religious and politicalconditions did not militate against the advisability of formulating a group.With the institution of a definite body, the original system of grades wasre-established, and the systems of Alchemy, the Qabalah and Magic once more weretaught to zealous, aspiring Neophytes. As a cloak to their activities, theylikewise continued in the early agreement of the Order which was:'‘First, that none of them should profess any other thing than to cure the sick,and that gratis.Second, None of the posterity should be constrained to wear one certain kind ofhabit, but therein to follow the custom of the country.Third, that every year, upon the day C. they should meet together at the houseSanctus Spiritus, or write the cause of his absence.Fourth, Every Brother should look about for a worthy person who, after hisdecease, might succeed him.Fifth, The word R. C. should be their seal, mark, and character.Sixth, The Fraternity should remain secret one hundred years.With this preliminary account, we may turn to the claims of the Order within themore historical times of the late 19th century, though unfortunately, theseclaims are no more verifiable and certainly no clearer than those whichcharacterised its beginning.<I5>“The Order of the Golden Dawn/’ narrates the history lecture of that Order, “isan Hermetic Society whose members are taught the principles of Occult Scienceand the Magic of Hermes. During the early part of the second half of lastcentury, several eminent Adcpti and Chiefs of the Order in France and Englanddied, and their death caused a temporary dormant condition of Temple work.“Prominent among the Adcpti of our Order and of public renown were Eliphas Levithe greatest of modem French magi; Ragon, the author of several books of occultlore; Kenneth M. Mackenzie, author of the famous and learned MasonicEncyclopaedia; and Frederick Hockley possessed of the power of vision in thecrystal, and whose manuscripts are highly esteemed. These and other contemporaryAdepti of this Order received their knowledge and power from predecessors ofequal and even of greater eminence. They received indeed and have handed down tous their doctrine and system of Theosophy and Hermetic Science and the higherAlchemy from a long series of practised investigators whose origin is traced tothe Fratres Roseae Crucis of Germany, which association was founded by oneChristian Rosenkreutz about the year 1398 A. D.“The Rosicrucian revival of Mysticism was but a new development of the vastlyolder wisdom of the Qabalistic Rabbis and of that very ancient secret knowledge,the Magic of the Egyptians, in which the Hebrew Pentateuch tells you that Mosesthe founder of the Jewish system was ‘learned’, that is, in which he had beeninitiated.”In a slender but highly informative booklet entitled<i6>Data of the History of the Rosicrucians published in 1916 by the late Dr.William Wynn Westcott, we find the following brief statement: “In 1887 bypermission of S.D.A. a continental Rosicrucian Adept, the IsisUrania Temple ofHermetic Students of the G.D. was formed to give instruction in the mediaevalOccult sciences. Fratres M.E.V. with S.A. and S.R.M.D. became the chiefs, andthe latter wrote the rituals in modern English from old Rosicrucian mss. (theproperty of S.A.) supplemented by his own literary researches.”In these two statements is narrated the beginning of the Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn — an organisation which has exerted a greater influence on thedevelopment of Occultism since its revival in the last quarter of the 19thcentury than most people can realise. There can be little or no doubt that theGolden Dawn is, or rather was until very recently, the sole depository ofmagical knowledge, the only Occult Order of any real worth that the West in ourtime has known. A great many other occult organisations owe what little magicalknowledge is theirs to leakages issuing from that Order and from its renegademembers.The membership of the Golden Dawn was recruited from every circle, and it wasrepresented by dignified professions as well as by all the arts and sciences, tomake but little mention of the trades and business occupations. It includedphysicians, psychologists, clergymen, artists and philosophers. And normal menand women, humble and unknown, from every walk of life have drawn inspirationfrom its font of wisdom, and undoubtedly many would be happy to recognise andadmit the enormous debt they owe to it.<l7>As an organisation, it preferred after the fashion of its mysterious parentalways to shroud itself in an impenetrable cloak of mystery. Its teaching andmethods of instruction were stringently guarded by serious penalties attached tothe most awe-inspiring obligations in order to ensure that secrecy. So well havethese obligations, with but one or two exceptions, been kept that the generalpublic knows next to nothing about the Order, its teaching, or the extent andnature of its membership. Though this book wall touch upon the teaching of theGolden Dawn, concerning its membership as a whole the writer will have nothingto say, except perhaps to repeat what may already be more or less well-known.For instance, it is common knowledge that W. B, Yeats, Arthur Machen and, ifrumour may be trusted, the late Arnold Bennett were at one time among itsmembers, together with a good many other writers and artists.With regard to the names given in Dr. Westcott’s statement it is necessary thatwe bestow to them some little attention in order to unravel, so far as may bepossible, the almost inextricable confusion which has characterised everyprevious effort to detail the history of the Order. M.E.V. was the motto chosenby Dr. William Robert Woodman, an eminent Freemason of the last century. SapereAude and Non Omnis Moriar were the two mottos used by Dr. Westcott, anantiquarian, scholar, and coroner by profession. S. R. M. D. or S. Rhiogail MaDhream was the motto of S. L. MacGregor Mathers, the translator of The GreaterKey of King Solomon, the Book of the Sacred Magic of Ahramelin the Mage, and TheKabbalah Unveiled, which latter consisted of certain portions of the Zoharprefixed by an introduction of high<i8>erudition. He also employed the Latin motto Deo Duce Comite Ferro. S. D. A. wasthe abbreviation of the motto Sapiens Dominabitur Astris chosen by a FrauleinAnna Sprengel of Nuremburg, Germany. Such were the actors on this occult stage,this the dramatis personae in the background of the commencement of the Order.More than any other figures who may later have prominently figured in itsgovernment and work, these are the four outstanding figures publicly involved inthe English foundation of what came to be known as The Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn.How the actual instigation of the Order came to pass is not really known. Orrather, because of so many conflicting stories and legends the truth isimpossible to discover. At any rate, so far as England is concerned, without adoubt we must seek for its origin in the Societas Rosi crucian a in Anglia. Thiswas an organisation formulated in 1865 by eminent Freemasons, some of themclaiming authentic Rosicrucian irritation from continental authorities. Amongstthose who claimed such initation was one Kenneth H. Mackenzie, a Masonic scholarand encyclopaedist, who had received his at the hands of a Count Apponyi inAustria. The objects of this Society which confined its membership to Freemasonsin good standing, was “to afford mutual aid and encouragement in working out thegreat problems of Life, and in discovering the secrets of nature; to facilitatethe study of the systems of philosophy founded upon the Kaballah and thedoctrines of Hermes Trismegistus/’ Dr. Westcott also remarks that to-day itsFratres “are concerned in the study and administration of medicines, and intheir manufacture upon old lines; they also teach<i9>and practise the curative effects of coloured light, and cultivate mentalprocesses which are believed to induce spiritual enlightenment and extendedpowers of the human senses, especially in the directions of clairvoyance andclairaudience.”The first Chief of this Society, its Supreme Magus so-called, was one RobertWentworth Little who is said to have rescued some old rituals from a certainMasonic storeroom, and it was from certain of those papers that the Society’srituals were elaborated. He died in 1878, and in his stead was appointed Dr.William R. Woodman. Both Dr. Westcott and MacGregor Mathers were prominent andactive members of this body. In fact, the former became Supreme Magus uponWoodman’s death, the office of Junior Magus being conferred upon Mathers. Onelegend has it that one day Westcott discovered in his library a series of ciphermanuscripts, and in order to decipher them he enlisted the aid of MacGregorMathers. It is said that this library was that of the Societas Rosicruciana inAnglia, and it is likewise asserted that those cipher manuscripts were among therituals and documents originally rescued by Robert Little from Freemason’s Hall.Yet other accounts have it that Westcott or a clerical friend found themanuscripts on a bookstall in Farringdon Street. Further apocryphal legendsclaim that they were found in the library of books and manuscripts inheritedfrom the mystic and clairvoyant, Frederick Hockley who died in 1885. Whateverthe real origin of these mysterious cipher manuscripts, when eventuallydeciphered with the aid of MacGregor Mathers, they were alleged to havecontained the address of a Fraulein Anna Sprengel who purported to be a Rosi<20>crucian Adept, in Nuremburg. Here was a discovery which, naturally, not for onemoment was neglected. Its direct result was a lengthy correspondence withFraulein Sprengel, culminating in the transmission of authority to Woodman,Westcott and Mathers, to formulate in England a semi-public occult organisationwhich was to employ an elaborate magical ceremonial, Qabalistie teaching, and acomprehensive scheme of spiritual training, Its foundation was designed toinclude both men and women on a basis of perfect equality in contradistinctionto the policy of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia which was comprised whollyof Freemasons. Thus, in 1887, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn wasestablished. Its first English Temple, Isis-Urania, was opened in the followingyear.There is a somewhat different version as to its origin, having behind it theauthority of Frater F. R., the late Dr. Felkin, who was the Chief of the StellaMatutina as well as a member of the Societas Rosicruciana. According to hisaccount, and the following words are substantially his own, prior to 1880members of the Rosicrucian Order on the Continent selected with great care theirown candidates whom they thought suitable for personal instruction. For thesepupils they were each individually responsible, the pupils thus selected beingtrained by them in the theoretical traditional knowledge now used in the OuterOrder. After some three or more years of intensive private study these pupilswere presented to the Chiefs of the Order, and if approved and passed byexamination, they then received their initiation into the Order of the RoseaeRubeae et Aureae Crucis.<2I>The political state of Europe in the nineteenth century was such that thestrictest secrecy as to the activities of these people was very necessary.England, however, where many Masonic bodies and semi-private organisations wereflourishing without interference, was recognised as having far greater freedomand liberty than the countries in which the continental Adepts were domiciled.Some, but by no means all, suggested therefore that in England open Temple workmight be inaugurated. And Dr. Felkin here adds, though without the least word ofexplanation as to what machinery was set in motion towards the attainment ofthat end, “and so it was ... It came about then that Temples arose in London,Bradford, Weston-super-Mare, and Edinburgh. The ceremonies we have wereelaborated from cipher manuscripts, and all went well for a time.”Since the history of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn subsequent to thisperiod has already been narrated elsewhere there is little need to repeat it.Those who may be interested in a detailed meticulous history of the Rosicrucianclaim as it has existed in Europe during the past three hundred years areadvised to consult Arthur Edward Waite’s The Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross.While in my small work My Rosicrucian Adventure the events that occurred to theGolden Dawn, culminating in this present publication of its teaching andrituals, are delineated at some length. The motives which have confirmed me inthis decision to act contrary to the obligation of secrecy arc there presentedand discussed. And with these directions, let us pass from historical bones towhat is the dynamic life and soul of the Order, its teaching and ceremonialtechnique of initiation.<22>Before one can grasp the nature of ceremonial initiation, which was the assumedfunction of the Golden Dawn, a few fundamental notions of the philosophyunderlying its practice must be grasped. The basic theory of the Order systemwas such as to identify certain of the grades with various spiritual principlesexisting in the universe. Hence a philosophy which describes, classifies, andpurports to understand the nature of the universe must be studied before thesignificance of the grades can be appreciated. One of the most importantbackgrounds of the system is the scheme of the Qabalah, a Jewish systemdescribed at length in my Tree of Life and the knowledge lectures herein. Sinceit is primarily a mystical method, the Qabalah has innumerable points ofidentity with the more ancient systems elaborated by other peoples in otherparts of the world. Its most important root concept is that the ultimate rootfrom which this universe, with all things therein, has evolved is Ain Soph Aour,In finite or Limitless Light. So far as our minds are capable of conceiving suchmetaphysical abstractions, this is to be understood as an infinite ocean ofbrilliance wherein all things are held as within a matrix, from which all thingsw'ere evolved, and it is that divine goal to which all life and all beingseventually must return.Issuing from or within this Boundless Light, there manifests what is called theTree of Life. Qabalists have produced a conventional glyph indicating thereuponten numerations or Sephiroth which are the branches of that Tree growing orevolving within space, ten different<23>modes of the manifestation of its radiation — ten varying degrees of but oneubiquitous substance-principle.The first of these numerations is called Kether, the Crown, and is the firstmanifestation from the Unknown, a concentration of its Infinite Light. As theradiant apex of this heavenly tree, it is the deepest sense of selfhood and theultimate root of substance. It constitutes the divine centre of humanconsciousness, all the other principles which comprise what we call man beingrather like so many layers of an onion around a central core. From thismetaphysical and universal centre duality issues, two distinct principles ofactivity, the one named Chokmah Wisdom, and the other Bvnah, Understanding. Herewe have the roots of polarity, male and female, positive and negative, fire andwater, mind and matter, and these two ideas are the noumena of all the variousopposites in life of which we have cognisance.These three emanations are unique in a special way, and they especiallysymbolise that “Light which shineth in darkness/’ the Light of the spiritualSelf. As Light shines into darkness, illuminating it without suffering adiminution of its own existence, so the workings of the Supernals, as thesethree Sephiroth are called, overflow from their exuberant being without therebydiminishing in any degree the reality or infinite vitality of their source. Theyare considered hence to have but little relation with the inferior Sephirothwhich issue from them, except as stem and root. Yet though hardly in anyphilosophic relation to our phenomenal universe, we find when engaged in magicalworking that it is customary — even necessary — to open ourselves by invocationto its influence so that this divine power of the Supernal<24>Light, descending through the human mind, may sanctify and accomplish the objectof the ceremony itself. The Supernals are often portrayed diagrammatically andsymbolically as a woman clothed with the Sun, stars above her head and the moonat her feet — the typical anima figure of modern psychology.She represents thus that First Matter of the Alchemists, the description ofwhich given by Thomas Vaughan in his Coelum Terras is interesting to quote asindicating further the nature and qualities of the Supernals: “A most pure sweetvirgin, for nothing as yet hath been generated out of her .. . She yields tonothing but love, for her end is generation, and that was never yet performed byviolence. He that knows how to wanton and toy with her, the same shall receiveall her treasures. First, she sheds at her nipples a thick heavy water, butwhite as any snow; the philosophers call it Virgin’s Milk. Secondly, she giveshim blood from her very heart; it is a quick, heavenly fire; some improperlycall it their sulphur. Thirdly and lastly, she presents him with a secretcrystal, of more worth and lustre than the white rock and all her rosials. Thisis she, and these are her favours.”From this first triad, a second triad of emanations is reflected or projecteddownwards into a more coarse degree of substance. They likewise reflect thenegative and positive qualities of two of the Supernals with the addition of athird factor, a resultant which acts as a reconciling principle. In passing, Ishould add that planetary attributions are given to these Sephiroth asexpressing the type of their operation. Kether is Spirit, Chokmah refers to theZodiac, and Binah is attributed to Saturn.<25>The fourth Sephirah is Chesed, meaning Grace or Mercy; also Gedulah is its othername, meaning Greatness, and to it is referred the astrological quality calledJupiter. Its concept is one of construction, expansion and solidification.Geburah is the fifth enumeration, Power or Might, and it is a symbol of creativepower and force. Its planetary attribution is Mars, its quality being thatdestructive force which demolishes all forms and ideas when their term ofusefulness and healthy life is done. It symbolises not so much a fixed state ofthings, as an act, a further passage and transition of potentiality Intoactuality.Six is the harmonising and reconciling Sephirah, Tiphareth. The word itselfmeans beauty and harmony. It is attributed to the Sun, the lord and centre ofour solar system. Just as Kether referred to the most secret depths of theUnconscious, the core of man’s life, so Tiphareth is its reflection, the ego,the ordinary human consciousness. This Sephirah completes the second triad,which is a triad of consciousness, as the first triad of the Supernal Light maybe considered the triad of that which is supremely divine, the Superconscious.Netsach, Victory, to which the planet Venus is referred, is the first Sephirahof the third reflected triad, and marks an entirely different order of things.Here we enter the elemental sphere, where Nature’s forces have their sway. It isalso the region in the human sphere of what we may term the Unconscious. Themagical tradition classifies this Unconsciousness into several strata, and toeach of them is attributed some one of the four elements, Fire, Water, Air andEarth. Netsach is attributed to the element of Fire, and so far as concerns<26>the classification of man’s principles, it represents his emotional life.Its opposite pole on the Tree of Life, is Hod, which means Splendour, whichreceives the attribution of the planet Mercury, Its element is Water, and itsaction represents fluidic mind, the thinking, logical capacity in man, as wellas what may be called his magical or nervous force — what the Hindu systemsdenominate as Prana.The third of that triad is Yesod, the Foundation, the ninth Sephirah, theoperation of the Sphere of the Moon. This is the airy sphere of the fourthdimension, termed in occultism the Astral plane. Here we find the subtleelectro-magnetic substance into which all the higher forces are focussed, theether, and it constitutes the basis or final model upon which the physical worldis built. Its elemental attribution is that of Air, ever flowing, shifting, andin a constant flux—yet because of that flux, in perpetual stability. Just as thetremendous speed of the particles insures the stability of the atom, so thefleeting forms and motion of Yesod in all its implications constitute thepermanence and surety of the physical world.Pendant to these three triads in Malkuth, the Kingdom, referred to the elementof Earth, the synthesis or vehicle of the other elements and planets. Malkuth isthe physical world, and in man represents his physical body and brain, theTemple of the Holy Ghost — the actual tomb of the allegorical ChristianRosenkreutz.These Sephiroth are not to be construed as ten different portions of objectivespace, each separated by millions and millions of miles — though of course they<27>must have their correspondences in different parts of space. They are, rather,serial concepts, each condition or state or serial concept enclosing the other.Each Sephirah, be it spiritual, ethereal, or physical, has its own laws,conditions, and “times,” if one may borrow terminology from Dunne’s Experimentwith Time. The distinction between them is one of quality and density ofsubstance. The difference may well be one of dimension, besides representingdifferent type-levels of consciousness, the “lower” worlds or Sephiroth beinginterpenetrated or held by the “higher.” Thus Kether, the Crown, is in Malkuth,as one axiom puts it, by virtue of the fact that its substance is of aninfinitely rare, attenuated, and ethereal nature, while Malkuth, the physicaluniverse is enclosed within the all-pervading spirit which is Kether inprecisely the same way that Dunne conceives Time No. 1, to be enclosed orcontained, or moving as a field of experience, within Serial Time No. 2.So far as concerns the Supernals, for these are the ideas which must principallyinterest us, the Qabalah teaches us that they comprise an abstract impersonalprinciple. That is, it is explained as an exalted condition of consciousnessrather than of substance; an essence or spirit which is everywhere and at alltimes expressed in terms of Light. In one sense, and from a comparative point ofview, it may help our understanding if we imagine it to have certainsimilarities to what our leading Analytical Psychologists call the CollectiveUnconscious.Though wholly impersonal in itself, and without characteristics that are readilyunderstandable to the ordinary mind, the Supernals are, to all intents and pur<2B>poses, what is commonly thought of as God. In the Tibetan Buddhist system, ananalogous concept is Sunyata, the Void. And the realisation of the Void throughYoga processes and the technical meditations of the Sangha is, to quote Dr.Evan-Wentz’s book The Tibetan Book of the Dead, to attain “the unconditionedDharmakaya, or the Divine Body of Truth, the primordial state of uncreatedness,of the Supramundane Bodhic, All-consciousness — Buddhahood.” In man, this Lightis represented by the very deepest levels of his Unconscious — a mighty activitywithin his soul, which one magical system calls the higher and Divine Genius.Though the Golden Dawn rituals persistently use phraseology which implies thebelief in a personal God, that usage to my mind is a poetic or dramaticconvention. A number of its very fine invocations are addressed to a deityconceived of in a highly individualistic and personal manner, yet if the studentbears in mind the several Qabalistic definitions, these rituals take on addedand profound meaning from a purely psychological point of view. That is, theyare seen to be technical methods of exalting the individual consciousness untilit comes to a complete realisation of its own divine root, and that universalpure essence of mind which ultimately it is.It may be convenient for the reader if I tabulate the names of the Sephirothwith the Grades employed\" in the Golden Dawn, together with a few importantattributions:<29>1. Kether.The Crown. Spirit2. Chokmah. Wisdom.3. Binah. Understanding.4. Chesed. Mercy.5. Geburah. Might.6. Tiphareth. Harmony.7. Netzach. Victory. Fire.8. Hod. Splendour. Water.9. Yesod. Foundation.

Kingdom, EarthIpsissimus©—0Magus®—GOMagister Templi©=GDAdeptusExemptus©=EAdeptus Major©—0Adeptus Minor@=0Philosophus©=0Practicus®=GDTheoricus©—0ZelatorIn the consideration of the grades, T shall not discuss any others than thoseexisting between Zelator and Adeptus Minor. My reason for doing so is that it isimpossible for the ordinary individual to understand those above the grade ofAdeptus Minor, and individuals who lay claim openly to such exalted grades, bythat very act place a gigantic question mark against the validity of theirattainment. He that is exalted is humble. And to have tasted that which isconveyed by the Adeptus Minor grade is so lofty an experience that few in theirright minds, unless they were extremely saintlike in character, would considerthemselves as having passed officially to a higher spiritual state.Before proceeding to an analysis of the grades, and the ceremonies which weresupposed to confer them, it has been thought advisable to consider the nature of<3°>initiation itself, which was the avowed function and purpose of the Order. Whatexactly is Initiation? Those of us who have read some of the neo-occult andpseudoTheosophical literature will also have heard the word initiation just toooften to feel wholly at ease. Lesser Initiations and Greater Initiations havebeen written of at some length. But the entire subject was surrounded with thatvague air of mystery, that halo of sanctity and ambiguity whose only excuse canbe ignorance on the part of the writers thereof. The degree of phantasy andattenuated sentimentality which has obtained expression from these sources, plusthe real lack of knowledge as to the objects of these degrees and mysteries, actas a constant source of irritation. Particularly, when we remember that theywere issued to satisfy people spiritually hungry, and yearning with anindescribable hunger for but a few crumbs of the divine wisdom.Learned dissertations have been published describing in great detail the folkcustoms of Australian aborigines and Polynesian and other primitive peoples. Allthe strange habits and unfamiliar rites of these tribes are paraded before ourgaze—from their hour of birth, through the vicissitudes of their emotional life,to the moment of death and interrment. We are asked to accept that these areinitiations. The sole import attached to the word “initiation” in thisconnection is that of the formal acceptance of a boy at puberty, for example,into the communal life of his people.Moreover, Jane E. Harrison, Sir F. G. Frazer and a host of other excellentscholars have provided us with a wealth of anthropological data so far as theGreeks and Romans of another day are concerned. Some knowledge<3i>of their religious rites and observances is displayed. I he daily habits of thepeople are carefully noted and recorded in many a tome.They also describe, though more haltingly and with rather less confidence, thecircumstances surrounding the Ancient Mystery Cults. The symbolism of thesemystery religions was, we see, in certain aspects uniform. All were dramas ofredemption, plans of salvation, ways of purgation. Degrees of initiation,baptism by water, a mystical meal for the privileged, dramatic plays depictingthe life and death of some god or other — these are the familiar incidents ofthe cults described by our scholars.But the obvious question arises, what spiritual value have such things for us?Do they help our own interior development so that we may solve our personalproblems and handle more satisfactorily the rather difficult process of livingto-day? And is this sort of thing what the Adepts of old implied by initiation?And if this all there is to it, why should so many moderns have been socuriously perturbed and excited by it all. Some other meaning must be latentherein; some other purpose to the rite must have been understood by theiroriginal observers whereby they were spiritually assisted and aided not only todeal adequately with life but to further the conquest and manifestation of theirown latent spiritual nature.For despite every record, and every learned attempt to penetrate into thesignificance of these rites, as to the exact procedure of the Theurgic techniquewe still obtain no lasting satisfaction, or understanding. There was undoubtedlya secret about these celebrations, both<32>ethnic and early Christian, which no exoteric record has divulged or commonsense, so-called, succeeded wholly to explain away. And the reason no doubt isthis. Though the early writers felt no hesitancy in expounding certainprinciples of the philosophy of their Mysteries, none felt it incumbent uponhimself to record in black and white the practical details of the magicaltechnique. Hence it is, in the absence of a description of the practicalelements of these rites, that our scholars, anthropologists and philosophers donot feel inclined to attach much significance to the ancient Mysteries otherthan an ordinary religious or philosophic one. That is, it is their belief thatordinary notions of an advanced theological or philosophical nature werepromulgated therein. For I may add in passing the complete esoteric technique ofinitiation has never previously passed into open publication. It has beenreserved in all secrecy for initiates of the sacred schools of Magic, Whilevarious documents explaining the principia of this wisdom were circulatedamongst the members of these schools, the oaths of secrecy attaching to theirreceipt was such that in recent times, as I have said, few lay exponents of theancient religions and philosophies have ever so much as suspected the existenceof these principia.The root of the word itself means “to begin,” “to commence anew.” Initiation isthus the beginning of a new phase or attitude to life, the entry, moreover, intoan entirely new type of existence. Its characteristic is the opening of the mindto an awareness of other levels of consciousness, both within and without.Initiation means above all spiritual growth — a definite mark in the span ofhuman life.<33>Now one of the best methods for bringing about this stimulus of the inner life,so that one does really begin or enter upon an entirely new existencecharacterised by an awareness of higher principles within, is the Ceremonialtechnique. By this we mean that a Ceremony is arranged in which certain ideas,teaching and admonitions are communicated to the candidate in dramatic form in aformally prepared Temple or Bodge room. Nor is this all — otherwise, no claimcould be made on behalf of Magic that it really and not merely figurativelyinitiates. For the utterance of an injunction does not necessarily imply that itcan sink sufficiently deeply into consciousness so as to arouse into renewedactivity the dormant spiritual qualities. And we have already witnessed theinvalidity and spiritual bankruptcy of innumerable organisations, religious,secular, and fraternal so-called, which have their own rituals and yet, takingthem by and large, have produced very few initiates or spiritually-minded menand women, saints or adepts of any outstanding merit.The efficacy of an initiation ceremony depends almost exclusively on theinitiator. What is it that bestows the power of successful initiation? Thispower comes from either having had it awakened interiorly at the hands of someother competent initiator, or that a very great deal of magical and meditationwork has successfully been performed. It is hardly necessary at this juncture tolabour at a description of these exercises and technical processes ofdevelopment which were undertaken by candidates and would-be initiators. Thesehave been delineated at length elsewhere, both in my Tree of Life, and in anincomparably fine form in the Golden Dawn<34>documents presented herein. But it is necessary to emphasise the fact that ananterior personal training and prolonged magical effort are the sole means bywhich one is enabled so to awaken the dormant spiritual life of another that hemay well and truly be called “initiated.”Now we know from an examination of the above mentioned documents and of ancientliterature that the object of the Theurgic art, as the magical concept ofinitiation was then termed, was so to purify the personality that that which wasthere imprisoned could spring into open manifestation. As one of the alchemicalexpositors has expressed it: “Within the material extreme of this life, when itis purified, the Seed of the Spirit is at last found.” The entire object of allmagical and alchemical processes is the purification of the natural man, and byworking upon his’nature to extract the pure gold of spiritual attainment. Thisis initiation.§These Golden Dawn rituals and ceremonies of initiation are worthy of a greatdeal of study and attention. It is my sincere and fervent hope that meditationand a close examination will be made of the text. Now, if we examine these textscarefully, we shall find that we can epitomise in a single word the entireteaching and ideal of those rituals. If one idea more than any other ispersistently stressed from the beginning that idea is in the word Light. Fromthe candidate’s first reception in the 1 Tall of the Neophytes when theHierophant ad jures him with these words: “Child of Earth, long hast thou dweltin darkness. Quit the night and seek the day,” to the<35>transfiguration in the Vault ceremony, the whole system has as its objective thebringing down of the Light. For it is by that Light that the golden banner ofthe inner life may be exalted; it is in light where lies healing and the powerof growth. Some vague intimation of the power and splendour of that glory isfirst given to the aspirant in the Neophyte Grade when, rising from his knees atthe close of the invocation, the Light is formulated above his head in thesymbol of the White Triangle by the union of the implements of the three chiefofficers. By means of the Adeptus Minor ritual, which identifies him with theChief Officer, he is slain as though by the destructive force of his lower self.After being symbolically buried, triumphantly he rises from the tomb of Osirisin a glorious resurrection through the descent of the white Light of the Spirit.The intervening grades occupy themselves with the analysis of that Light as itvibrates between the light and the darkness, and with the establishment withinthe candidate’s personal sphere of the rays of the many-coloured rainbow ofpromise.“Before all things,” commences a phrase in one ritual, “are the chaos, thedarkness, and the Gates of the Land of Night.” It is in this dark chaotic nightso blindly called life, a night in which we struggle, labour and war incessantlyfor no reasonable end, that we ordinary human beings stumble and proceed aboutour various tasks. These gates of the far-flung empire of the night indeed refereloquently to the material bondage which we ourselves have created — a bondagewhereby we are tied to our circumstances, to our selves, to trial of every kind,bound to the very things we so despise and hate. It is not until we have clearlyrealised that we are enmeshed<3^>in darkness, an interior darkness, that we Can commence to seek for thatalchemical solvent which shall disperse the night, and call a halt to thecontinual projection outwards of the blackness which blinds our souls. As in theBuddhist scheme, where the first noble truth is sorrow, so not until we havebeen brought by experience to understand life as sorrow, can we hope for thecessation of its dread ravage. Only then does the prospect open of breaking theunconscious projection, the ending of which discloses the world and the whole oflife in a totally different light. “One thing only, brother, do I proclaim,”said the Buddha, “now as before. Suffering and deliverance from suffering.”These restricting circumstances and bonds are only the gates of the wilderness.The use of the word “gate” implies a means both of egress and ingress. By thesegates we have entered, and by them also may we go out if so we choose, to enterthe brilliance of the dawning Sun, and perchance greet the rising of thespiritual splendour. For “after the formless, the void, and the darkness, thencometh the knowledge of the Light.” As intimated above, one first must haverealised that one’s soul is lost in darkness before a remedy can be sought tothat irresponsible participation mystique, the unconscious projection outwardsof interior confusion, and aspire to that divine land which is, metaphorically,the place of one’s birth. In that land is no darkness, no formlessness, nochaos. It is the place of the Light itself — that Light “which no wind canextinguish, which burns without wicks or fuel.”Being “brought to the Light” then is a very apposite description of the functionof Initiation. It is the Great<37>Work, There is no ambiguity in the conception of the Rituals, for it appearsthroughout the entire work from Neophyte to Adeptus Minor and perhaps beyond.For the Path is a journeying upwards on the ladder of existence to the crown ofthe Tree of Life, a journey where every effort made and every step taken bringsone a little nearer to the true glory of the Clear Light. As we know, theexperience of the rising of the Light in both vision and waking state is commonto mystics of every age and of every people. It must be an experience of thegreatest significance in the treading of the Path because its appearance seemsalways and everywhere an unconditional psychic thing. It is an experience whichdefies definition, as well in its elementary flashes as in its most advancedtransports. No code of thought, philosophy or religion, no logical process canbind it or limit it or express it. But always it represents, spiritually, amarked attainment, a liberation from the turmoil of life and from psychiccomplications and, as Dr. C. G. Jung has expressed the matter, it “thereby freesthe inner personality from emotional and imaginary entanglements, creating thusa unity of being which is universally felt as a release.” It is the attainmentof spiritual puberty, marking a significant stage in growth.Symptomatic of this stage of interior growth is the utter transformation thatcomes over what previously appeared to be “the chaos, the darkness, and theGates of the Land of Night.” While man is assumed into godhead, and the divinespirit is brought down into manhood, a new heaven and a new earth make theirappearance, and familiar objects take on a divine radiance as though illuminedby an internal spiritual light. And<38>this is what, in part at any rate, was meant by1 the old alchemists, for thefinding of the Philosopher’s Stone converts all base metals into the purestgold. In his book Centuries of Meditation, Thomas Traherne gives an interestingdescription of the rapture of the inner personality, its reaction to the world,when it is freed by the mystical experience from all entanglements. He says:“The corn was orient and immortal wheat, which never should be reaped, nor wasever sown. I thought it had stood from everlasting to everlasting. The dust andthe stones of the street were as precious as gold; the gates were at first theend of the world. The green trees when I saw them first through one of thegates, transported and ravished me, their sweetness and unusual beauty made myheart to leap, and almost mad with ecstasy, they were such strange and wonderfulthings. The men!0 what venerable and reverend creatures did the aged seem! Immortal Cherubim!And the young men glittering and sparkling angels, and maids, strange seraphicpieces of life and beauty. Boys and girls tumbling in the street, and playing,were moving jewels ... I knew not that they were born or should die. But allthings abided eternally as they were in their proper places. Eternity wasmanifest in the Light of the Day, and something infinite behind everythingappeared . .And to illustrate the magical attitude towards life and the world wheninitiation has produced its true result, there is another exalted panegyric byTraherne which1 cannot desist from quoting. For let me add that Magic does not countenance aretreat from life, an escape from the turmoils of practical life. It seeks onlyto transmute what formerly was dross into gold. Initiation has as its<3 9>object the commencement of a new life, to transform the base and low into thepure and unutterably splendid. “All appeared new and strange at first,inexpressibly rare and delightful and beautiful. I was a little stranger whichat my entrance into the world was saluted and surrounded with innumerable joys.My knowledge was Divine; I knew by intuition those things which since myApostacy I collected again by the highest reason. My very ignorance wasadvantageous. I seemed as one brought into the state of innocence. All thingswere spotless and pure and glorious; yea, and infinitely mine and joyful andprecious. I knew not that there were any sins, or complaints or laws. I dreamednot of poverties, contentions, or vices. All tears and quarrels were hidden frommy eyes. Everything was at rest, free and immortal. I knew nothing of sicknessor death or exaction. In the absence of these I was entertained like an angelwith the works of God in their splendour and glory; I saw all in the peace ofEden ... All Time was Eternity, and a perpetual Sabbath ..Such is the stone of the Philosophers, the Quintessence, the Summum Ronum, truewisdom and perfect happiness.Psellus, the Neoplatonist, has written that the function of Initiatory Magic was“to initiate or perfect the human soul by the powers of materials here on earth;for the supreme faculty of the soul cannot by its own guidance aspire to thesublimest intuition and to the comprehension of Divinity,” It is a commonplaceaphorism in Occultism that “Nature unaided fails.” That is to say that thenatural life, if left to itself, and isolated from the impact of a higher typeof life or consciousness,<4°>can only produce a commonplace thing of the natural life. It reminds us of thesentiment of the alchemists who expressed contempt of their first matter as itexisted in its natural or impure state, in the condition where it normally isfound. But this first matter, cleansed and purified by the psycho-chemical artof alchemy, that is to say by Initiation — is that which is transformed into themost precious thing in the whole world. But until cleansed and purified it is oflittle or no value. Nature, however, aided where she had left off by wise anddevout men, may surpass herself. And this is why Psellus claims that the soul ofitself and by itself is not able to attain to divinity unless and until it isguided by Initiates and thus enfolded into another life. It is to effect thisintegration, to bring about this initiation, this exaltation of theconsciousness above its natural state to the light divine, that the magicalsystem of the Golden Dawn, or of any other legitimate initiating system, owesits existence. The function of every phase of its work, the avowed intention ofits principal rituals, and the explicit statement of its teaching, is to assistthe candidate by his own aspirations to find that unity of being which is theinner Self, the pure essence of mind, the Buddha-nature. Not only does thesystem imply this by its ritualistic movements and axiomata, but there are clearand unmistakable passages where these ideas are given unequivocal expression.Thus, we find it written that the entire object of initiation and mysticalteaching is “by the intervention of the symbol, ceremonial and sacrament, so tolead the soul that it may be withdrawn from the attraction of matter anddelivered from the absorption therein, whereby it walks in somnambulism, knowingnot whence<4i >it cometh nor whither it goeth.” And moreover, in the same Ritual, celebrated atthe autumnal and vernal Equinoxes, the Chief Adept officiating recites aninvocation beseeching guidance for the newly-installed Hierophant. It is asked“that he may well and worthily direct those who have been called from thetribulation of the darkness into the Light of this little kingdom of Thy love.And vouchsafe also, that going forward in love for Thee, through him and withhim, they may pass from the Desire of Thy house into the Light of Thy presence.”This is succeeded by sentences read by the Second and Third Adepti: “The desireof Thy house hath eaten me up,” and “I desire to be dissolved and to be withThee.”And finally, that not the least vestige of misunderstanding or misconception mayremain as to the objects of this divine Theurgy, let me reproduce one lastquotation from this same ritual. Referring to the Supernals and the Temple thatin old time was built on high, the speech adds: “The holy place was made wasteand the Sons of the house of Wisdom were taken away into the captivity of thesenses. We have worshipped since then in a house made with hands, receiving asacramental ministration by a derived Light in place of the cohabiting Glory.And yet, amidst Signs and symbols the tokens of the Higher presence have neverbeen wanting in our hearts. By the waters of Babylon we have sat down and wept,but we have ever remembered Zion; and that memorial is a witness testifying thatwe shall yet return with exultation into the house of our Father.”Thus and unmistakeably is the true object of the Great Work set before us, andwe shall do well ever to keep eye and aspiration firmly fixed thereto. For whilethe<42>road to the spiritual Zion demands great exertion, and because it is a way thatat times proceeds by devious routes, there is great temptation to linger by theroadside, to stroll down pleasant side-lanes, or to play absentmindedly withtoys or staves cut but to assist our forward march. But if we forget not to whatnoble city the winding path leads us, little danger can overtake any who pursueit steadfast to the end. It is only when the abiding city is forgotten that theroad becomes hard, and the way beset by unseen danger and difficulty.Prior to attempting to describe a few of the salient points of the Rituals —briefly, for since they appear within these volumes, they must be individuallystudied and experienced so that an individual point of view may be acquired — itmay be advisable to devote a few explanatory words to the Art of CeremonialInitiation itself.A useful and significant preface may be taken from Dr. Jung’s commentary toWilhelm’s translation of The Secret of The Golden Flower, where there is muchthat explains the ritualistic functions of Magic. “Magical practices are,” hedeclares, “the projections of psychic events wrhich, in cases like these, exerta counter influence on the soul, and act like a kind of enchantment of one’s ownpersonality. That is to say, by means of these concrete performances, theattention or better said the interest, is brought back to an inner sacred domainwhich is the source and goal of the soul. This inner domain contains the unityof life and consciousness which, though once possessed, has been lost and mustnow be found again.”From one point of view the officers employed in these Rituals represent justsuch psychic projections. They<43 >represent, even as figures in dreams do, different aspects of man himself —personifications of abstract psychological principles inhering within the humanspirit. Through the admittedly artificial or conventional means of a dramaticprojection of these personified principles in a well-ordered ceremony a reactionis induced in consciousness. This reaction is calculated to arouse from theirdormant condition those hitherto latent faculties represented objectively in theTemple of Initiation by the officers. Without the least conscious effort on thepart of the aspirant, an involuntary current of sympathy is produced by thisexternal delineation of spiritual parts which may be sufficient to accomplishthe purpose of the initiation ceremony. The aesthetic appeal to the imagination— quite apart from what could be called the intrinsic magical virtue with whichthe G. D. documents Z. 1. and Z. 3. deal at some length — stirs to renewedactivity the life of the inner domain. And the entire action of this type ofdramatic ritual is that the soul may discover itself exalted to the heights, andduring that mystical elevation receive the rushing forth of the Light.Applying these ideas then, to the Neophyte or @=H] — so called because it is notattributed to any of the enumerations or Sephiroth on the Tree of Life since itis a preliminary or probationary grade — we find that the Kerux is an officerwho personifies the reasoning faculties. He represents that intelligent activepart of the mind which functions ever in obedience to the Will — the QabalisticRuach, in a word. The higher part of that mind, the aspiring, sensitive, and theintuitive consciousness is represented by the Hegemon, who seeks<44>the rising of the Light. And the Hierophant, in this initial ceremony ofNeophyte, acts on behalf of the higher spiritual soul of man himself, thatdivine self of which too rarely, if ever at all, we become aware. “The essenceof mind is intrinsically pure,” is a definition of the Bodhisattva Sila Sutra,and it is this essential state of enlightenment, this interior Self, Osirisglorified through trial and perfected by suffering, which is represented by theHierophant on the dais. He is seated in the place of the rising Sun, on thethrone of the East, and with but two or three exceptions never moves from thatstation in the Temple. As the Qabalah teaches, the everlasting abode of thehigher Self is in the Eden of Paradise, the supernal sanctuary which is everguarded from chaos by the flaming sword of the Kerubim whirling every way on theborders of the abyss. From that aloof spiritual stronghold it gazes down uponits vehicle, the lower man, evolved for the purpose of providing it withexperience — involved in neither its struggles or tribulations, yet, fromanother point of view, suffering acutely thereby. And seldom does that Geniusleave its palace of the stars except when, voluntarily, the lower self opensitself to the higher by an act of sincerest aspiration or selfsacrifice, whichalone makes possible the descent of the Light within our hearts and minds. Thuswhen the Hierophant leaves the Throne of the East, he represents that HigherSelf in action, and as Osiris marks the active descent of the Supernalsplendour. For he says, as he leaves the dais with wand uplifted: “I come in thePower of the Light. I come in the Light of Wisdom. I come in the Mercy of theLight. The Light hath healing in its wings.” And having brought the Light to theaspirant,<45>he returns to his throne, as though that divine Genius ot whom he is the symbolawaited the deliberate willing return of the aspirant himself to the everlastingabode of the Light.Even in the communication of the usual claptrap of secret societies, the signsand grips, all these are explained solely in terms of the quest for the Light.Also the various groupings of officers and their movements in the Temple are notwithout profound meaning. These should be sought out, since they constantlyreiterate the implicit purpose of the rite. Thus, at the altar, the threeprincipal officers form about the candidate a Triad, representing in symbolicformation again the Supernal clear Light of the Void, and this also isrepresented by the number of the circumambulations about the confines of theTemple. The white cord bound thrice about the waist has reference to the sameset of ideas. Even upon the altar of the Temple are symbols indicating the riseof Light. A red calvary cross of six squares as symbolic of harmony andequilibrium is placed above a white triangle — the emblem of the Golden Dawn.They form the symbol of the Supernal Sephiroth which are the dynamic life androot of all things, while in man they constitute that triad of spiritualfaculties which is the intrinsically pure essence of mind. Hence the triangle isa fitting emblem of the Light. And the place of the Cross above the Trianglesuggests not the domination of the sacred spirit, but its equilibriation andharmony in the heart of man. Despite the fact that the whole of this intricatesymbolism can hardly be realised by the candidate at the time of his initiation,its intrinsic value is such that unconsciously as an organised body of sug<46>gestion it is perceived and noted and strikes the focal centre.We are taught by tradition that the entire object of the sacred rites was thepurification of the soul so that its power could gradually dissolve theimpediments of, and percolate through, the heavy body and opaque brain. “Know”says Synesius, “that the Quintessence and hidden thing of our stone is nothingelse than our viscous celestial and glorious soul drawn out of its minera by ourmagisteryHence the entire trend of the preliminary Neophyte grade of the GoldenDawn is towards the purification of the personality. It fulfils the testimony ofthe Hermetic Art so that the Light within could be fermented and perfected bythe ceremonial method of initiation. Purification and consecration — this is theinsistent and uncompromising theme caught by the candidate’s car. “Unpurifiedand unconsecrated thou canst not enter our sacred Hall!” Fire and water assistin these several consecrations until, eventually, the candidate is placed in theposition of balanced power, between the two Pillars, where the first link iseffected with his higher and divine Genius.§The Neophyte Ritual really stands by itself. It is an introductory ceremonyshadowing forth all the major formulae and techniques. With the Adeptus Minorritual it is concerned almost entirely with the Light itself. The five gradesthat are placed between them have as their object the awakening of the elementalbases of what must develop into the instrument of the higher. Awakened andpurified, they may be consecrated to the<47>Great Work, in order that they may become worthy vehicles for the indwelling ofthe Light. First, however, it is necessary that they be awakened. For,psychological truism that it is, until their presence is realised theirtransmutation cannot be accomplished. In symbolic form and pageantry, theceremony of each grade calls forth the spirits of a particular element. And as asteel placed in close proximity to a magnet receives some degree of itsmagnetism, and comparable to the electrical phenomenon of induction, so thepresence of power induces power. Contact with the appropriate type of elementalforce produces an identical type of reaction within the sphere of the Neophyte,and it is thus that growth and advancement proceeds. The speeches of theofficers deal almost exclusively with the knowledge pertaining to that elementand grade, and excerpts from fragmentary remains of the ancient Mysteries andfrom certain of the books of the Qabalah do much towards producing an impressiveatmosphere.The element offered for the work of transmutation in the Grade of Zelator is theearthy part of the Candidate. The ritual symbolically admits him to the firstrung of that mighty ladder whose heights are obscured in the Light above. Thisfirst rung is the lowest sphere of the conventional Tree of Life, Malkuth, theSanctum Regnum. To it are ascribed the first grade of Zelator, and the elementof Earth. Herein, after the Earth elementals are invoked, the Candidate isceremonially brought to three stations, the first two being those of e*il andthe presence divine. At each of these stations the Guardians reject him at thepoint of the sword, urging him in his unprepared state to return. His thirdattempt to go<4S>forward places him in a balanced position, the path of equilibrium, the MiddleWay, where he is received. And a way is cleared for him by the Hierophant, whoagain represents the celestial soul of things. During his journey along thatpath, the stability of earth is established within him, that eventually it mayprove an enduring temple of the Holy Spirit.Some have criticised these elemental grades a little harshly and severely;others have rejected them entirely. In a letter sent to me from a formerPraemonstrator of one G. D. Temple, these rituals too were condemned in thatthey were said to be simply a parade, redundant and verbose, of the occultknowledge that one of the Chiefs possessed at that time. In one sense, ofcourse, what those critics claim is perfectly true. The principal formulae andteaching are concealed in the preliminary Neophyte Grade and that of AdeptusMinor. It is the development of the ideas in these ceremonies which constitutesthe Great Work — the disclosure of the essence of mind, the invocation of thehigher Genius. These, however, are the high ends and the final goals of themystic term. Notwithstanding his limitations these are ultimates to which everyman must work. Meanwhile, in order to render that attainment possible in itsfullest sense, several important matters require attention. The personality mustbe harmonised. Every element therein demands equilibriation in order thatillumination ensuing from the magical work may not produce fanaticism andpathology instead of Adeptship and integrity. Balance is required for theaccomplishment of the Great Work. “Equilibrium is the basis of the soul.”Therefore, the four grades of Earth, Air, Water and Fire plant the<49>seeds of the microcosmic pentagram, and above them is placed, in the Portalceremony, the Crown of the Spirit, the quintessence, added so that the elementalvehemence may be tempered, to the end that all may work together in balanceddisposition. These grades are therefore an important and integral part of thework, despite shortsighted hostile criticism. To compare them, however, withthose which precede and follow, is symptomatic of an intellectual confusion offunction. It is rather as if one said that milk is more virtuous than Friday —which, naturally, is absurd. Yet similar comparisons in magical matters areconstantly being made without exciting ridicule. It is obvious that differentcategories may not be so compared. The purpose of the Neophyte ritual is quitedistinct from that of Zclator, and it is mistaken policy to compare them. Whatrightly could be asked is whether the Zelator and the other elemental gradesaccomplish what they purport to do. That is another matter. The concensus ofexperienced opinion is on the whole that they do, and I am content for the timebeing to accept that authority.The candidate by these grades is duly prepared, so it is argued, to enter theimmeasurable region, to begin to analyse and comprehend the nature of the Lightwhich has been vouchsafed him. The first three elemental grades could be takenjust as quickly as the candidate, at the discretion of the Chiefs, desired.There were no requirements other than to indicate by examination that theappropriate meditations had been performed and certain items of Qabalisticknowledge necessary to the magical routine committed to memory.Before proceeding further in the analysis of the grades-,<S°>there is one rather fine prose passage in the Zelator grade which must be givenhere — a passage of beauty, high eloquence, and lofty significance. “AndTetragrammaton placed Kerubim at the East of the Garden of Eden and a FlamingSword which turned every way to keep the path of the Tree of Life, for He hascreated Nature that man being cast out of Eden may not fall into the Void. Hehas bound man with the stars as with a chain. He allures him with scatteredfragments of the Divine Body in bird and beast and flower. And He laments overhim in the Wind and in the Sea and in the Birds. And when the times are ended,He will call the Kerubim from the East of the Garden, and all shall be consumedand become infinite and holy.”It would be a happy task, were it advisable, to devote several pages of thisintroduction to praising the excellence of what are called the four elementalprayers. Each one of the elemental Initiation ceremonies closes with a longprayer or invocation which issues, as it were, from the heart of the elementsthemselves. These must be silently read, continuously meditated upon andfrequently heard fully to be appreciated, when the reader will find his ownpersonal reactions crystallising. Recited by the Hierophant at the end of theceremony, these prayers voice the inherent aspiration of the elements towardsthe goal they are striving in their own way to reach, for here they areconceived as blind dumb forces both within and without the personal sphere ofman. They are given assistance by the human beings who, having invoked them andused their power, strive to repay in some way the debt owed to these otherstruggling lives.The grade after the Earth ceremony is that of Theor<5i>icus. It is referred to the Ninth Sephirah on the Tree of Life, Yesod, theFoundation, and to it are attributed the sphere of the operation of Luna and theelement Air. Here the candidate is conducted to the stations of the fourKerubim, the Angelic choir of Yesod. The Kerubim are defined in that ritual asthe presidents of the elemental forces, the vivified powers of the letters ofTetragrammaton operating in the Elements. Over each of these rules some one ofthe four letters of the mirific word and the Kerubim. It is always through thepower and authority and symbol of the Kerub that the elemental spirits and theirrulers are invoked. In this ritual, as in all the others, important practicalformulae of ceremonial magic are concealed.At this juncture, of the ceremony, with the Airy elements vibrating about himand through him, the Zelator is urged to be “prompt and active as the Sylphs,but avoid frivolity and caprice. Be energetic and strong as the Salamanders butavoid irritability and ferocity, Be flexible and attentive to images, like theUndines, but avoid idleness and changeability. Be laborious and patient like theGnomes, but avoid grossness and avarice. So shalt thou gradually develop thepowers of thy soul and fit thyself to command the spirits of the elements.”In each of the grades, several drawings and diagrams are exhibited, each oneconveying useful knowledge and information required in the upward quest. TheTarot Keys are also dealt with, as indicating pictorially the stages of thatjourney, and depicting the story of the soul. It may not be possible because ofthe exigencies of space to reproduce in these volumes a pack of Tarot cardsbased upon esoteric descriptions — though I should very<52>much liked to have done so. But by using the Waite and the available French andItalian packs, and by comparing them with the accounts given in the rituals, theimagination of the reader will render this omission unimportant.The third grade is that of Practicus referred to the Sephirah Hod, theSplendour, the lowest of the Sephiroth on the left hand side of the Tree, thePillar of Severity. Its attributions refer to the sphere of the operation ofMercury, but more especially to the element of Water which in this ceremony isinvoked to power and presence. As I have previously remarked, and it bearsconstant reiteration, the Tree of Life and the Qabalistic scheme as a wholeshould be carefully studied so that the aptness of the attributions both to theSephiroth and the Paths may be fully appreciated. Two Paths lead to the Sphereof Splendour, the Path of Fire from Malkuth, and the Path of the reflection ofthe sphere of the Sun from Yesod. Water is germinative and maternal, whilst Fireis paternal and fructifying. It is from their interior stimulation and union,the alchemical trituration, that the higher life is born, even as has been said,“Except ye be baptised writh water and the Spirit ye cannot enter the Kingdom ofheaven.”Therefore in this grade, the Candidate is led to the sphere of stagnant waterwhich by the presence of solar and fiery elements is vitalised and rendered aperfect creative base. Most of the speeches in this ritual are depicted asissuing from the Samothracian Kabiri, the deluge Gods, though the main body ofthe ritual consists of the sonorous and resonant versiclesof the ChaldaeanOracles, the translation, I believe, of Dr. Westcott, with a few<53>modifications authorised by Mathers. Briefly, the entire symbolism of thePracticus grade is summarised by the position on the altar of the principalGolden Dawn emblems so arranged that “the cross above the Triangle representsthe power of the Spirit rising above the triangle of the Waters.” That alsoindicates the immediate task of the Candidate. At this juncture, too, thediagrams displayed begin to take on especial significance, and though theirtheme apparently is biblical in nature, accompanied by explanations in a curiousphraseology consonant therewith, they are nevertheless highly suggestive, ascontaining the elements of a profound psychology. After this grade follows anautomatic wait of three months, referred to the regimen of the elements, aperiod as it were of silent incubation, during which time the rituals were givento the candidate that he may make copies for his own private use and study.The fourth grade of Philosophus carries the candidate one step further. TheSephirah involved is Netsach, Victory, to which is referred the operation of theplanet Venus and the clement of Fire, while the paths that connect to the lowerrungs of the ladder are principally of a watery nature. Thus the elementsencountered are of an identical nature with those of the preceding grade, buttheir order and power is quite reversed. Previously the water was predominant.Now the Fire rages and whirls in lurid storm, with water only as thecomplementary element whereon it may manifest, and in order that due equilibriummay be maintained, as it is written: — “The Ruach Elohim moved upon the face ofthe Waters.” These two are the primary terrestrial elements which, intelligentlycontrolled and creatively employed may<54>lead eventually to the restoration of the Golden Age. By their transmutation anew paradise may be re-created from the darkness and chaos into which formerlyit had fallen. For the Light may not legitimately be called forth upon man, nordwell within him, until chaos has been turned into equilibrium of completerealisation and enlightenment. Not until order has been restored to the lowerelements of his earthy kingdom, neither peace nor inner security may be hisrightful lot.The symbols depicted while traversing the Path of Peh, which joins the spheresof Fire and Water, indicate the results as it were of the first stages of thePath, for the Tarot card shown demonstrates the destruction of a Tower bylightning. The three holes blasted in the walls symbolise the Supernal Triad,the establishment of the divine through and following the destruction of theouter self. Though Fire and Water, warmth and moisture, are essentiallycreative, their stimulation within the being of the Neophyte draws hisattention, perhaps for the first time, to the chaotic condition of his naturalexistence, and the complete psychic muddle into which his ignorance andspiritual impotence have stranded him. Evocative of the highest within his soul,these elements equally call forth that which is base and low. The result of thefirst step is analytical, an unbalancing, the levelling down of all that manformerly held true and holy — the chaos, the darkness, and the Gates of the Landof Night. An unhappy state, but a very necessary one if progress is to be madeand if the preliminary chaos is to be transcended. From these ruins may beerected the new temple of Light, for it is always from the rubbish heap that areselected the materials for the manifestation of god-head.<55>These symbols have a dual reference. Not only do they refer to the epochs ofcreative evolution whose memory has long since faded even from the visiblememory of nature, but also to the recapitulations of these periods withinpersonal progress on the Path. “The Aspirant on the threshold of Initiation,”observes Crowley very aptly, “finds himself assailed by the ‘complexes’ whichhave corrupted him, their externalisation excruciating him, and his agonisedreluctance to their elimination plunging him into such ordeals that he seems(both to himself and to others) to have turned from a noble and upright man intoan unutterable scoundrel.” These arc the experiences and events which occur toevery aspirant when initiation forces the realisation upon him that “all issorrow.” In fact, it is my belief that the criterion or hall mark of successfulinitiation is the occurrence of these or similar experiences. The wholeuniverse, under the stimulation of the magical elements and inward analysis,seems to tumble like a pack of cards crazily about one’s feet. This is the solvehalf of the alchemical solve et coagula formula.Analysis must precede synthesis. Corruption is the primitive base from which thepure gold of the spirit is drawn. Moreover the alchemical treatises are eloquentin their description of the poisonous nature of this condition which, thoughextremely unpleasant, is a highly necessary one, and success in its productionis at least one symptom of good working. It is held that the highest results maynot be obtained until this particular type of change has occurred. So far as thenature of the environment and the creative power of the personal self permits,the task implied by the coagula formula is to assemble<S6>them and remould them nearer to the heart’s desire. And here again, thealchemists are adamant in their insistence upon the aphorism that “Natureunaided fails.” For the alchemist, so the tradition asserts, commences his workwhere Nature has left off. And were this solvi phenomenon to occur spontaneouslyin the course of nature, the result and the outcome — the coagulation ofpreviously dissolved elements — would not be very dissimilar to that whichpreviously existed. But with the technique of initiation, the chaos is lifted upand fermented so to speak, that from it, with the aid of the invoked white Lightof the divine Spirit, a higher species of being, illumined and enlightened, maydevelop.In two Altar diagrams — one called the Garden of Eden, shown in the Practicusgrade, and the other called The Fall shown in the Philosophus grade, all theseideas are expanded and synthesized. They should be carefully studied and receivelong meditation, for in them are many clues to the spiritual and psychologicalproblems which beset the traveller on the Path, and they resume the entirephilosophy of Magic. Many hints, moreover, which may be found useful asassisting meditation are contained in The ‘Curse’ from a Philosophical Point ofView in the second volume of Blavatsky’s Secret Doctrine in connection with thePrometheus myth and the awakening of Manas, mind.Since both of these diagrams may be found reproduced in the body of the textvery little by way of prolonged explanation need here be said. The first depictsa personified representation of the three fundamental principles in Man. Each ofthese is apparently separate, functioning independently on its own plane withoutco-opera<57>tion with, because apparently unaware of, cither the higher or the lower.Principally, it represents man in the now departed morning of the race, in theprimal rounds of evolutionary effort when self-consciousness had not yet beenwon by self-induced and self-devised efforts, and when peace and harmonyprevailed both within and without by right of heritage rather than throughpersonal labour. The diagram appears in the Water grade of Practicus, sinceWater is a fitting representation of this placid peace. At the summit of thediagram stands the Apocalyptic woman clothed with the Sun of glory, crowned withthe twelve stars, and the moon lying at her feet. Her symbolism pertains to thesupernal essence of mind, representing thus the type and symbol of theglittering Augoeides, the Neschamah. Speaking of an analogous psychologicalconception in his commentary to The Secret of the Golden Flower, Dr. C. G. Jungremarks that this figure represents “a line or principle of life that strivesafter superhuman, shining heights.” At the base of the tree stands Eve, theNefhesch or unconscious who, in opposition to this divine Genius, stands for thedark “earthborn, feminine principle with its emotionality and instinctivenessreaching far back into the depths of time, and into the roots of physiologicalcontinuity.” Between the two stands Adam, supported by the fundamental strengthof Eve, the Ruach or Ego not yet awakened to a realisation of its innate powerand possibility. From the larger point of view he represents the race as a wholeand “is the personified symbol of the collective Logos, the ‘Host’, and of theLords of Wisdom or the Heavenly Man, who incarnated in humanity.” Otherwise herepresents the individual Candidate on the Path, prior to the awak<58>eningof the “sleeping dogs” within his being, to use Blavatsky’s apt expression.Beneath these three figures sleeps a coiled dragon, silent, unawakened. None itwould seem is aware of that latent power, titanic and promethean, coiled beneath— the active magical power centered in man, his libido, neutral, of vastpotentialities but neither good nor evil in itself.Very similar in some respects is the diagram revealed in the Philosophus Grade.As the divine peace of the garden of Eden was manifested during the Water grade,so in this Grade of Philosophus, the power of Fire is shown to have called forthcatastrophe. Formerly called beneath the tree, the hydra-headed dragon in thisDiagram has usurped its proper place. Its several horned heads wind their way upinto the very structure of the Tree of Life, even unto Daath at the foot of theSupernals. Lured downwards by the tree of knowledge — and remembering in whatsense the Bible speaks of the verb “to know,” we gather that the root of thetrouble was an imperfect apprehension of creative power — towards the “darklysplendid world wherein continually lieth a faithless depth,” Eve, the lowerself, ceases to give support to Adam. She has yielded to the awful fascinationof the awakening psyche. Far easier is it to fall than to climb to the distantheights. Yet only from one viewpoint is the Fall catastrophic. The awareness ofthe rise of the Dragon endows man also with consciousness of power — and poweris life and progress. The Dragon stands as the symbol of the great enemy to beovercome, and, as the task of equilibration proceeds, the great prize awaitingsuccess.The Fall as a state of consciousness is analagous to<59>that condition described by various mystics as the dark Night of the Soul. It isaccompanied by a sense of intolerable dryness, a dreaded awareness of the factthat all the powers of the soul seem dead, and the mind’s vision closed in dumbprotest, as it were, against the harsh disciple of the Work itself. A thousandand one seductions will tend to lure the candidate from the contemplation of themagical goal, and there will be presented to him a thousand and one means ofbreaking in spirit his vow “to persevere in the divine science” without breakingit in letter. And it will appear that the mind itself will run riot and becomeunstable, warning the candidate that it were better for him to enjoy a lull inhis magical operations. This state is allegorically referred to by thealchemists in their descriptions of the poisonous Dragon which follows upon thecorruption of their First Matter. Vaughan calls it: “a horrible devouringDragon—creeping and weltering in the bottom of her cave, without wings. Touchher not by any means, not so much as with thy hands, for there is not upon earthsuch a violent, transcendent poison.” But as the mystics teach, if thiscondition be patiently endured, it passes, a higher spiritual consciousnessgradually dawning in the heart and mind. So also in the alchemical writings, wefind that Vaughan observes: “As thou hast begun so proceed, and this Dragon willturn to a Swan, but more white than the hovering virgin snow when it is not yetsullied with the earth.”The Qabalistic Sephirah of Daath is the conjunction of Chokmah and Binah on theTree of Life, the child of Wisdom and Understanding—knowledge. It refers to thesymbolic sphere formed wdthin or above the Ruach<6o>by means of experience obtained, and this assimilated becomes transmuted intointuition and faculty of mind. But fundamentally it is the ascent of the Dragonor, if you wish, an upwelling of the Unconscious archetypes —a highly dangerousand unbalancing ascent, until they are assimilated to consciousness—which firstrenders Daaih a possibility. It is the Fall which is responsible for theacquisition of self-knowledge. “Thus it stands proven ” claims B la vat sky,“that Satan, or the red Fiery Dragon, the ‘Lord of Phosphorus’ and Lucifer, or‘Light-bearer,’ is in us; it is our Mind—our tcmptor and Redeemer, ourintelligent liberator and saviour from pure animalism.”In the evolutionary scheme, the Fall occurs through a higher type ofintelligence coming into close contact with nascent humanity, thus stimulatingthe psyche of the race—or so the magical tradition has it. The recapitulation ofthis process within the individual sphere of consciousness proceeds through thetechnique of initiation whereby the Red Dragon is stirred into activity throughcontact with the fructifying powers of the elements, invoked through the skilland power of a trained initiator. The use of the divine prerogative, broughtabout by the magic of every-day experience, the awakening of Daaih, bringsdisaster at first because the awakened psyche is imperfectly understood and soabused for personal ends. But that very disaster anu and that abuse confers theconsciousness of self, and is instrumental, at least in part of breaking up theprimitive participation mystique. Consequently, the realisation of sorrow as itimpinges on the ego, or at least the sense of personal mental and emotionaldiscomfort, and<6i>an understanding of its causes, invariably constitute the first impetus toperform the Great Work, even as it comprises the motive first to seek theservices and aid of the analytical psychologist. This impetus and thisselfconsciousness are the prime implications of Daath. Its signification is ahigher type of consciousness, the beginning of a spiritual rebirth. It acts as aself-evolved link between the higher Genius, on the one hand, at peace in itsSupernal abode, and, on the other hand, the human soul bound by its Fall to theworld of illusion and sense and matter. Not until that self-consciousness andacquired knowledge are turned to noble and altruistic ends, so long will sorrowand suffering be the inevitable result. Continually will the Red Dragon, theinverted power of the eros, ravish the little kingdom of self until such time aswe open ourselves to the deepest levels of our unconsciousness, reconciling anduniting them with our conscious outlook, thus conquering the foe by driving itback to its proper realm. In such a way may we use, but neither ignore norrepress, the experience of life and its fruit to transcend our own personallimitations and attain to a participation mystique on a higher andself-conscious levehLet me quote a few especially appropriate lines from Jung in connection withthis Fall, when the fundamental basis of the Ruach has been attracted to thekingdom of shells and when Malkuth has been dissociated from the otherSephiroth: “Consciousness thus torn from its roots and no longer able to appealto the authority of the primordial images, possesses a Promethean freedom, it istrue, but it also partakes of the nature of a godless hybris. It soars above theearth, even above mankind,<62>but the danger of capsizing is there, not for every individual to be sure, butcollectively for the weak members of such a society, who again Promethean-like,are bound by the unconscious to the Caucasus.”For the Adept to be cut off from his roots, from contact with the vitalising andnecessary basis of his Unconsciousness, will never do. He must unite andintegrate the various levels of his entire Tree. His task must be to train anddevelop the titanic forces of his own underworld, so that they may become as apowerful but docile beast whereon he may ride.§The Adeptus minor grade continues the theme of these two diagrams. Escorted intothe Vault, the Aspirant is shown the lid of the Tomb of Osiris, the Pastos,wherein is buried our Father, Christian Rosenkreutz, and on that lid is apainting which brings fulfilment as it were to the narrative of the precedingdiagrams. It is divided into two sections. The lower half of the paintingdepicts a figure of Adam, similar to his presentation in the Practicus gradediagram, though here the heads of the Dragon are falling back from the Tree,showing the Justified One, the illuminated adept, by his immolation andself-sacrifice rescuing the fallen kingdom of his natural self from the clutchesof an outraged eros. But above this, as though to show the true nature behindthe deceptive appearance of things is illustrated a noble figure of majesty anddivinity described in the Ritual in these words. “And being turned I saw sevengolden Light-bearers, and in the<63>midst of the Light-bearers, one like unto the Ben Adam, clothed with a garmentdown to the feet, and girt with a golden girdle. His head and his hair werewhite as snow, and his eyes as flaming fire; his feet like unto fine brass as ifthey burned in a furnace. And his voice as the sound of many waters. And he hadin his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went the Sword of Flame, andhis countenance was as the Sun in his strength.”It is to effect this redemption of the personality, to regenerate the power ofthe dragon, and attempt to bring the individual to some realisation of hispotential godhead, that is the object of the Adeptus Minor Ceremony.It is for this reason that I hold that the Golden Dawn magic, the technique ofinitiation, is of supreme and inestimable importance to mankind at large. In itthe work of academic psychology may find a logical conclusion and fruition, sothat it may develop further its own particular contribution to modern life andculture. For this psycho-magical technique of ceremonial initiation indicatesthe psychological solution of the anima problem. “Arise! Shine! For thy light iscome!”Between the grade of Phdosophus and the Portal, an interval of seven months wasprescribed, the regimen of the planets. During that period, devised to assistthe gradual fructification of the seeds planted within, a review was advised ofall the preceding studies. Such a review certainly was imperative. As one of theChiefs of the Order expressed it:—“Remember that there is hardly a circumstancein the rituals even of the First Order which has not its special meaning andapplication, and which<64>does not conceal a potent magical formula. These ceremonies have brought theeinto contact with certain forces which thou hast now to learn to awaken inthyself, and to this end, read, study and re-read that w'hich thou hast alreadyreceived. Be not sure even after the lapse of much time that thou hast fullydiscovered all that is to be learned from these. And to be of use unto thee,this must be the work of thine own inner self, thine own and not the work ofanother for thee so that thou mayest gradually attain to the knowledge of theDivine Ones.”The Grade of the Portal, which conferred upon the Candidate the title of Lord ofthe Paths of the Portal of the Vault of the Adepti, is not referred to aSephirah as such. It may, however, be considered as an outer court to Tiphareth,exactly as the Adeptus Minor ceremony may be considered Tiphareth within. Itstechnical attribution is the element of Akasa, Spirit or Ether w'hich ismagically invoked by the usual procedure of invoking pentagrams and thevibration of divine names following upon the conjuration of the powers of thefour subsidiary elements. To this grade, there is attached no elemental prayeras in the former grades, but there is one remarkable invocation employed whichbears quoting here. In full Temple, the English version is not used, but it isvibrated in the original Enochian or Angelic tongue — a language which is atonce sonorous, vibrant and dramatically impressive. The following is the fullversion of which an abridged one was normally used in the Temple: “I reign overyou, (here the Order version names the three Archangels of the element) saiththe God of Justice in power exalted above the firmament of wrath. In whose handsthe Sun is as a sword and the Moon as a through<6S>thrusting fire. Who measureth your garments in the midst of my vestures andtrussed you together as the palms of my hands. Whose seat I garnished with thefire of gathering. Who beautified your garments with admiration. To whom I madea law to govern the holy ones, and delivered you a rod with the ark ofknowledge. Moreover, ye lifted up your voices and sware obedience and faith tohim that liveth and triumpheth. Whose beginning is not nor end cannot be. Whoshineth as a flame in the midst of your palaces and reigneth amongst you as thebalance of righteousness and truth. Move therefore and show yourselves. Open themysteries of your creation. Be friendly unto me, for I am the servant of thesame your God, a true worshipper of the Highest.”This grade, referred to the veil Paroketh, which separates the First and SecondOrders, is intermediate between the purely elemental grades and the spiritualgrade of Adeptus Minor. A crown to the four lower element, this Rite formulatesabove Earth, Air, Water and Fire, the uppermost point of the Pentagram,revealing the administration of the Light over and through the kingdom of thenatural world. It concerns itself with the recapitulation of the former grades,co-ordinating and equilibriating the elemental self which, symbolicallysacrificed upon the mystical altar, is offered to the service of the higherGenius. In that grade, too, aspiration to the divine is strongly stressed as thefaculty by which the veil of the inner sanctuary may be rent. It is the way torealisation. The five Paths leading from the grades of the First to the SecondOrders are symbolically traversed, and their symbols impressed within the sphereof sensation.A gestation period of at least nine months had to elapse<66>prior to initiation to the grade of Adeptus Minor, and since there can be nomisunderstanding the purpose and nature of this beautiful ceremony it requiresthe minimum of comment from my pen. It explains itself completely in one of thespeeches: “Buried with that Light in a mystical death, rising again in amystical resurrection, cleansed and purified through him our Master, o brotherof the Cross of the Rose. Like him, o Adepts of all ages, have ye toiled. Likehim have ye suffered tribulation. Poverty, torture and death have ye passedthrough; they have been but the purification of the gold. In the alembic ofthine heart through the athanor of affliction, seek thou the true stone of thewise.”The form of this ritual is beautiful in its simplicity and warrants a briefdescription. First of all, the candidate is led in, arrayed with insignia andbadges and calling himself by his various titles and mottos. But he is warnedthat not in any vainglorious spirit are the mysteries to be approached, but insimplicity alone. This is the signal for him to be divested of all his ornamentsand insignia, and by the Temple entrance, just prior to being bound upon a largeupstanding cross of wood, he stands alone, clad in a simple unornamented blackgown. The reader is earnestly recommended to study this Ritual again and again,until almost it becomes a part of his very life, incorporated into the fabric ofhis being, for herein are highly important and significant formulae of mysticalaspiration and of practical magic. In it is exemplified the technical “DyingGod” formula about which in The Golden Bough Frazer has written so eloquently.Examples of this are to be found in every mythology and every mystical religionthat our world has ever known. But I<67 >doubt that it has ever attained to a more clarified and definite expression thanin this ceremony of the Adeptus Minor grade. For we are clearly taught byprecept and by example that we are, in essence, gods of great power andspirituality who died to the land of our birth in the Garden of Hesperides, andmystically dying descended into hell. And moreover the ritual demonstrates thatlike Osiris, Christ, and Mithra, and many another type of god-man, we too mayrise from the tomb and become aware of our true divine natures. The principalclause of the lengthy Obligation assumed while bound to the cross, indicatingthe trend of its teaching, and the import of its objective, is: “I furthersolemnly promise and swear that, with the Divine permission, I will from thisday forward apply myself unto the Great Work, which is so to purify and exalt myspiritual nature that with Divine aid I may at length attain to be more thanhuman and thus gradually raise and unite myself to my higher and divine Genius,and that in this event, I will not abuse the great power entrusted to me,”The preface to the assumption of the obligation is under these circumstances atremendously impressive occurrence, and few could fail to be even faintly movedby it. It consists of an invocation of an Angelic power: “In the divine nameIAO, I invoke Thee thou great avenging Angel HUA, that thou mayest invisiblyplace thy hand upon the head of this Aspirant in attestation of his obligation ..It is not difficult to realise that this is a critical and important phase ofthe ceremony. During this obligation, because of the symbolism attached to itand because of the active aspiration which is induced at this juncture,<68>illumination may quite easily occur. In one of the documents describing certaineffects ensuing from this initiation, one of the Chiefs has written, that theobject of the ceremony conceived as a whole “is especially intended to effectthe change of the consciousness into the Neschamah, and there are three placeswhere this can take place. The first is when the aspiration is on the cross,because he is so exactly fulfilling the symbol of the abnegation of the lowerself and the Union with the higher.\"The Obligation assumed, the candidate is now removed from the cross, and theOfficers then narrate to him the principal facts in the history of the founderof the Order—Christian Rosenkreutz. On a previous page was given a summary ofthese historical facts. When the History lecture mentions the discovery of theVault wherein the Tomb and body of the illustrious Father were discovered, oneof the initiating adepts draws aside a curtain, admitting the candidate to achamber erected in the midst of the Temple similar to that described in thelecture. A few words roughly describing it may not be considered amiss. As aclimax to the very simple Temple furniture of the Outer grades, it comes as apsychological spasm and as a highly significant symbol. The vault itself is asmall seven-sided chamber, each side representing one of the seven planets, withtheir host of magical correspondences. The mediaeval Rosicrucian manifesto theFama Fraternitalis, translated in Arthur Edward Waite’s Real History of theRosicrucians, describes it at great length, though I shall here quote butbriefly: “We opened the door, and there appeared to our sight a vault of sevensides and seven corners, every side five foot broad and the height of eightfoot. Although the sun never<69>shined in this vault, nevertheless it was enlightened with another Sun, whichhad learned this from the sun, and was situated in the upper part of the centreof the ceiling. In the midst, instead of a tomb-stone, was a round altar... Now,as we had not yet seen the dead body of our careful and wise Father, wetherefore removed the altar aside; then we lifted up a strong plate of brass,and founda fair and worthy body, whole and unconsumed ”Around this fundamental symbolism, the Golden Dawn adepts, displaying a geniusof extraordinary insight and synthesis, had built a most awe-inspiringsuperstructure. The usual Order symbolism of the Light was represented by awhite triangle centred by the Rose — this placed upon the ceiling. The floordesign was so painted as to represent the Red Dragon and the forces of theprimitive archetypes upon which the candidate trod as emblematic of hisconquest. Placed in the centre of the Vault was the Pastos of Rosenkreutz —though the Pastos is also referred to as the Tomb of Osiris the justified One.Both of these beings may be considered as the type and symbol of the higher anddivine Genius. Immediately above this coffin rested the circular altar mentionedin the Kama. It bore paintings of the Kerubic emblems, and upon these wereplaced the four elemental weapons and a cross, the symbol of resurrection. Atone point in the ceremony, the acting Hierophant, or Chief Adept as he is nowcalled, is interred in the Pastos as though to represent the aspirant’s higherSelf which is hidden and confined within the personality, itself wanderingblindly, lost in the dark wilderness. The whole concatenation of symbols is anelaborate and dramatic portrayal of the central theme of the Great Work. In aword, it depicts the spirit<7°>ual rebirth or redemption of the candidate, his resurrection from the dark tombof mortality through the power of the holy Spirit.In the symbol of the Vault, the psychologist no doubt will see a highlyinteresting and complex array of Mother symbols, traces of which, used in verymuch the same way, may be found in the literary fragments we inherit from themystery cults of antiquity. It would be possible, and quite legitimate so tointerpret the Vault. For even the Order interpretation refers the Vault in itsentirety to the Isis of Nature, the great and powerful mother of mankind and allthat is. And an analysis of the separate parts of the Vault—the Venus door, thePastos, the two Pillars—would subscribe to that view. For regeneration and thesecond birth have always as creative psychological states been associated withthe Mother. And it may be recalled that the Neschamah or that principle in manwhich constantly strives for the superhuman shining heights, is always portrayedas a feminine principle, passive, intuitive and alluring. Whilst the universalcounterpart of this human principle, represented on the Tree of Life by theSupernals, is always described by the mediaeval alchemists as a virginal figure,from whose life and substance all things have issued, and through whose agencyman is brought to the second birth.The reader is earnestly recommended to study this Ritual again and again untilalmost it becomes a part of his very life, incorporated into the very fabric ofhis being. Very little aesthetic appreciation will be required to realise thatin this and the other rituals are passages of divine beauty and high eloquence.And the least learned will find ideas of especial appeal to him, as the scholar<7i>and the profound mystic will perceive great depth and erudition in what mayappear on the surface as simple statement. Properly performed, with initiatedtechnique and insight, these rituals are stately ceremonies of great inspirationand enlightenment.The apparent complexity of the above delineated scheme may be thought by someindividuals to be entirely too complicated for modern man and not sufficientlysimple in nature. While one can deeply sympathise with the ideas of the extremesimplicity cult in Mysticism, nevertheless it is evident that the complex andarduous nature of the routine is no fault of Magic. Man himself is responsiblefor this awkward situation, lo be purified was considered by the alchemists andthe Theurgists of a hygone day as not nearly enough. That purification andconsecration was required to be repeated and repeated, again and again. Becauseof countless centuries of evolution and material development—sometimes in quitefalse directions—man has spiritually repressed himself, and thus graduallyforgotten his true divine nature. Meanwhile, as a sort of compensation for thisloss, he has developed a complexity of physical and psychic constitution fordealing adequately with the physical world. Hence, methods of spiritualdevelopment refusing to admit the reality of that many-principled organisationmay not be recognised as valid, for the sole reason that man is not a simplebeing. Fundamentally and at root he may be simple; but in actuality he is not.Having strayed from his roots, and lost his spiritual birthright in a jungle ofdelusion, it is not always easy to re-discover those roots or to find the wayout from the Gates of the Land of Night.<7 2>In contradistinction to the above mentioned type of amorphous mystical doctrine,Magic does recognise the many-faceted nature of man. If that intricate structureso painfully constructed be considered an evil, as some seem to think, it is anecessary evil. It is one to be faced and used. Therefore Magic connives by itstechnique to use, develop, and improve each of these several principles to itshighest degree of perfection. “Thou must prepare thyself” councils Vaughan “tillthou art conformable to Him Whom thou wouldst entertain, and that in everyrespect. Fit thy roof to thy God in what thou canst, and in what thou canst notHe will help thee. When thou hast thus set thy house in order, do not think thyGuest will come without invitation. Thou must tire Him out with piousimportunities.Perpetual knockings at His door,Tears sullying his transparent rooms,Sighs upon sighs; weep more and more—He comes.This is the way thou must walk in, which if thou dost thou shall perceive asudden illustration, and there shall then abide in thee fire with light, windwith fire, power with wind, knowledge with power, and with knowledge anintegrity of sober mind!”Not enough is it to be illuminated. The problem is not quite as simple as that.It is in vain that the wine of the Gods is poured into broken bottles. Each partof the soul, each elemental aspect of the entire man must be strengthened andtransmuted and brought into equilibrium and harmony with the others. Integrationmust be the rule<7 3>of the initiate, not pathology. In such a vehicle made consecrate and truly holyby this equilibriation, the higher Genius may find a worthy and fit dwelling.This and this alone, may ever constitute the true nature of initiation.§With each of the grades just described, a certain amount of personal work wasprovided, principally of a theoretical kind. The basic ideas of the Qabalah wereimparted by means of so-called knowledge lectures, together with certainimportant symbols and significant names in Hebrew were required to be memorised.The Iamens—insignia worn over the heart—of the various Officers were referred indivers ways to the Tree of Life, thus explaining after a fashion the function ofthat particular office in the Temple of Initiation. Each path traversed, andevery grade entered, had a so-called Admission Badge. This usually consisted ofone of the many forms of the Cross, and of symbols of the type of the Swastika,truncated Pyramid, and so forth. To these astrological and elementalattributions were referred. Most of these symbols possess great value, and sincethey repeatedly recur under different guises through the stages of personalmagical work undertaken after the Adeptus Minor grade, they should receive thebenefit of prolonged brooding and meditation.Three of the most important items of personal study to be accomplished while inthe First or Outer Order, apart from the memorisation of the rudiments of theQabalah were: (a) The practice of the Pentagram Ritual with the QabalisticCross, (b) Tatwa Vision, and<7 4>(c) Divination by Geomancy and the simple Tarot method described by Waite in hisKey to the Tarot.The Pentagram Ritual was taught to the Neophyte immediately after his initiationin order that he might “form some idea of how to attract and come intocommunication with spiritual and invisible things.” Just as the NeophyteCeremony of admission contains the essential symbolism of the Great Work,shadowing forth symbolically the commencement of certain formulae of the Magicof Light, so potential within the Pentagram Ritual and the Qabalistic Cross arethe epitomes of the whole of that work. In all magical procedure it isfundamental, for it is a gesture of upraising the human consciousness to its ownroot of perfection and enlightenment by which the sphere of sensation and everyact performed under its surveillance are sanctified. Thus it should precedeevery phase of magical work, elementary as well as advanced. The written rubrichas previously appeared in my Tree of Life, and I may now add a word or twoconcerning the further directions which are orally imparted to the Candidateafter his admission.The prime factor towards success in that exercise is to imagine that the astralform is capable of expansion, that it grows tall and high, until at length ithas the semblance of a vast angelic figure, whose head towers amongst thedistant stars of heaven. When this imaginative expansion of consciousnessproduces the sense that the height is enormous, with the Earth as a tiny globerevolving beneath the feet, then above the head should be perceived orformulated a descending ray of brilliant Light. As the candidate marks the headand then the breast, so should this brilliance descend, even down to<75>his feet, a descending shaft of a gigantic cross of Light. The act of markingthe shoulders right and left whilst vibrating the Sephirotic names, traces thehorizontal shaft of the cross, equilibriating the Light within the sphere ofsensation. Since it has been argued above that the Great Work consists in thesearch for the Light, this ritual truly and completely performed leads to theaccomplishment of that Work and the personal discovery of the Light. ThePentagrams trace a cleansing and protecting circle of force invoked by the fourNames of four letters each about the limits of the personal sphere, and theArchangels are called, by vibration, to act as great stabilising influences.The study of the different types of divination may seem difficult to understandin an Order which purported to teach methods of spiritual development. Many willno doubt be rather perplexed by this. Divination usually is said to referexclusively to the low occult arts, to fortune-telling, and the prognosticationof the future. Actually, however, so far as the Order is concerned, theprincipal object for these practical methods is that they stimulate, as fewexercises can, the faculties of clairvoyance, imagination, and intuition. Thoughcertain readings or interpretations to the geomantic and Tarot symbols may befound in the appropriate text books, these rule of thumb methods do not conduceto the production of an accurate delineation of the spiritual causes behindmaterial events. These interpretations are usual to the beginner in the art, forhe requires a foundation of the principal definitions employed upon which hisown meditations can build. These textual delineations in actual practice serveonly as a base for the working of<76>the inner faculties, provides for them a thrust-block as it were from which theymay <Lkick-off.” In short, the effort to divine by these methods calls intooperation the intuitive and imaginative faculties to a very large extent.Everyone without exception has this faculty of divining in some degree, varyingonly in his ability to make it manifest. In most people it is wholly dormant.Again, while divination as an artificial process may be wholly unnecessary and ahindrance to the refined perceptions of a fully developed Adept, who requires nosuch convention to ascertain whence a thing comes and whither it is going, yetthese aids and stimuli have their proper place for the Neophyte. For those intraining they are not only legitimate but useful and necessary. It may beinteresting for the reader to attempt to acquire intuitive knowledge on anymatter without the divinatory aids first, and it will be seen how extremelydifficult it is to get started, to pick upon any one fact or incident whichshall act as a prompt or a starter of the interior mechanism. Having failed inthis way, let him see how much further he really may go by the judicious andsensible use of one of the Order methods. There is no doubt that the opening ofthe mind to an intuitive perception is considerably aided by these methods. Andthis is particularly true with regard to the rather lengthy Tarot method whichwas given to the initiate while engaged in the fulfilment of his Adeptus Minorcurriculum. Like all magical techniques, divination is open to abuse. The fact,however, that abuse is possible does not, as again and again must be reiterated,fully condemn the abused technique. The application of common sense to themagical art is as necessary as it is to all else.<77>There was a movement on foot in one of the Temples a little while ago toeliminate the stndy and practice of Geomancy from the scheme of training of theOuter Order. The prevailing tendency is so to simplify the road to Adeptship asto reduce the practical requisites to an absolute minimum by eliminating everyphase of the work which does not come “naturally,” and whose study might involvehard work. Most of the newly admitted candidates to this Temple within the pastfive years or more are utterly without any practical acquaintance with thistechnique.Originally, Astrology was taught as part of the regular routine. All instructionon this subject seems now to have been thoroughly extirpated from the Orderpapers. Perhaps in this particular instance the omission is just as well. Forrecent years have seen a great deal of meticulous attention paid to this studyby sincere and honest researchers, and there have been published many firstratebooks explaining its intricacies. All that the Order demands of the AdeptusMinor is that he should be able to draw up a map showing the position of Planetsand Signs, preparatory to certain operations requiring the invocation ofzodiacal forces.Tatwa vision requires but little mention in this place, for full instructions inthis technical method of acquiring clairvoyance may be seen in a later volume.They are compiled from a number of documents and verbal instructions obtainingwithin the Order. Since these oral “tit-bits” and papers were very scattered, ithas been found necessary to reorganise the whole matter. In that restatement,however, I have exercised no originality nor uttered personal viewpoints on anyphase of the techni<78>que, confining my labour solely to rc-writing the material in my possession. Itmay be interesting for the psychological critic to reflect upon the fact that itwas this technique to which most members of the Order devoted the greatestattention—the only technique in which, more than any other single branch of thework, there is greater opportunity for deception and self-deception. While inmany ways the Order technique may appear different from the vision methoddescribed in my Tree of Life, both are essentially the same. For they teach thenecessity of an imaginative formation of an intellectual or astral form, theBody of Light, for the purpose of exploring the different regions of the Tree ofLife or the several strata of one’s own psychic make-up. The simpler aspects ofthis investigation are taught just after the grade of Philosophus, thoughnaturally the full possibilities of this method and the complete details on thetechnical side do not reveal themselves until the teaching of the Second Orderhas been received.In addition to these technical methods there were meditations on the symbols andideas of the whole system, and it was quite frequently suggested that thestudent go through the ceremonies, after having taken the grades, and build themup in his imagination so that he re-lives them as vividly as when he was in theTemple. The practical exercise that accompanied the Portal grade was one inwhich the aspirant built up, again in the imagination, a symbolic form of theQabalistic Tree of Life, paying at first particular attention to the formulationof the Middle Pillar in the sphere of sensation or aura. This latter wasconceived to be an ovoid shape of subtle matter, and the imaginative formulationof the<79>various Sephiroth therein whilst vibrating the appropriate Divine Names went fartowards opening, in a safe and balanced way, the psycho-spiritual centres ofwhich the Sephiroth were but symbols. This technique, with the so-calledVibratory Formula of the Middle Pillar which is a development therefrom, Iconsider to be one of the most important practical systems employed in theOrder. Though the documents describe it in a very rudimentary and sketchyfashion, nevertheless it is capable of expansion in several quite astonishingdirections. I have discussed and expanded this technique at considerable lengthin my book The Art of True Healing.So far, I have confined myself to a bird’s eye view of the routine asestablished in the First or Outer Order of the Golden Dawn. The graduatedtraining of the entire Outer was intended as a preparation for the practicalwork to be performed in the Inner or Second Order of the Roseae Rubeae et AureaeCrucis. The assignation of personal magical work seems deliberately to have beenpostponed until after the Vault reception. It was held that the Ceremonyformulated a link between the Aspirant and his Augoeides, that connectionserving therefore as a guide and a powerful protection which is clearly requiredin the works of Ceremonial Magic. Since at the commencement of each seriousoperation the Initiate must needs exalt himself towards his higher and divineGenius that through him may flow the divine power which alone is capable ofproducing a pure magical work, the initial forging of that link is a matter ofsupreme importance.Let me now detail the curriculum of work prescribed in the Second Order. Thetraining of the Adeptus Minor<8o>consisted of eight separate items, and I quote the following from a syllabus“A—General Orders/' now in circulation.“Part One. A. Preliminary. Receive and copy: Notes on the Obligation. The Ritualof the ©—GO Grade. The manuscript, Sigils from the Rose. The Minutum Mundum.Having made your copies of these and returned the originals you should studythem in order to prepare to sit for the written examination. You must alsoarrange with the Adept in whose charge you are, about your examination in theTemple on the practical work.”“Part Two. Receive the Rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram. Copy and learnthem. You can now sit for the written examination in these subjects and complete‘A’ by arranging to be tested in your practical knowledge in the Temple.“Part One. B. Implements. Receive the Rituals of the Lotus Wand, Rose-Cross,Sword, and the Elemental Weapons. Copy and return them. There is a writtenexamination on the above subjects—that is on the construction, symbolism, anduse of these objects, and the general nature of a consecration ceremony and theforming of invocations. This can be taken before the practical work of making isbegun or at any stage during it.“Part Two. This consists in the making of the Implements which must be passed assuitable before the consecration is arranged for, in the presence of a Chief orother qualified Adept. The making and consecration are done in the order givenabove unless it is preferred to do all the practical work first, and makearrangements for consecration as convenient.<8i>“Part One. G. Neophyte Formulae. Receive and copy Z. 1. on the symbols andformulae of the Neophyte Ritual, Z. 3, the symbolism of the Neophyte in thisCeremony. Copy the God-form designs of the Neophyte Ritual. The writtenexamination on the Z. manuscripts may now be taken.“Part Two. To describe to the Chief or other suitable Adept in the Temple thearrangement of the Astral Temple and the relative position of the Forms in it.To build up any God-form required, using the correct Coptic Name.”The above three sections, A. B. G., completed the course prescribed for theZelator Adeptus Minor, the first sub-grade. The passing of these examinations,conferred the qualification for holding the office of Hierophant, that is theinitiator, in the Outer Order of the G. D.“Part One. C. Psychic. This consists in a written examination in the Tatwasystem. Its method of use, and an account of any one vision you have had fromany card.“Part Two. This consists in making a set of Tatwa cards, if you have not alreadydone so, and sending them to be passed by the Chief or other Adept appointed. Totake the examiner on a Tatwic journey, instructing him as if he were a studentand vibrating the proper names for a selected symbol.“Part One. D. Divination. Receive and study the Tarot system, making notes ofthe principal attributions of the Inner method.<82>“Part Two. Practical. On a selected question, either your own, or theexaminer’s, to work out a Divination first by Geomancy, then by HoraryAstrology, then by the complete inner Tarot system, and send in a correlatedaccount of the result.“Part One F. Angelic Tablets. Receive and make copies of the Enochian Tablets,the Ritual of the Concourse of the Forces, and the Ritual of the making of thePyramid, Sphinx, and God-form for any square. A written examination on thesesubjects may now be taken.“Part Two. Make and colour a pyramid for a selected square, and to make theGod-form and Sphinx suitable to it, and to have this passed by an Adept. Toprepare a Ritual for practical use with this square, and in the presence of aChief or other Adept appointed to build it up astraily and describe the visionproduced. To study and play Enochian chess, and to make one of the Chess boardsand a set of Chessmen.“Part One. E. Talismans. Receive a manuscript on the making and consecrating ofTalismans. Gather Names, Sigils, etc., for a Talisman for a special purpose.Make a design for both designs of it and send it in for a Chief to pass. Make upa special ritual for consecrating to the purpose you have in mind and arrange atime with the Chief for the Ceremony of Consecration.“II. Consecration and Evocation. Subject: A ceremony on the formulae of RitualZ. 2. Must be prepared before Examiner and must meet with his approval as tomethod, execution and effect.”<83>In the early Temples there was also issued a catalogue of manuscripts,enumerating in alphabetical order the documents circulated amongst the ZelatoresAdepti Minores.A.

The sole omissionsare the documents lettered H. J., L. and part of M.“J” consists simply of an elaborated commentary upon the Adeptus MinorObligation, written in a florid ponderous style reminiscent of EliphasLevi-cum-Arthur Edward Waite.“H” Clavicula Tabularum Enochi, is a more or less lengthy manuscript, turgid andarchaic, for the most part repeating, though not as clearly, the contents of “S,The Book of the Concourse of the Forces.” Incidentally, this document ispractically a verbatim duplicate of part of a lengthy manuscript to be found inthe Manuscript Library of the British Museum, Sloane 307. A good deal of theadvice given is typically mediaeval, and definitely unsound from a spiritualviewpoint, and is certainly not in accord with the general lofty tenor of theremaining Order teaching. It explains how to find precious metals and hiddentreasure, and how to drive away the elemental guardians thereof. It is aninferior piece of wrork—as also is the document “L”, and so I have decided toomit both.“M” has two sections, the Hermes Vision which 1 do propose to give, and theLineal Figures of the Sephiroth. Because of the extreme complexity of thelatter, and because it will be impossible to reproduce the several geometricaldrawings in colour which accompany that manuscript, the writer has deemed itsufficient to restate it in a general manner as a note to the instruction onTelesmatic Images.<85>The whole of the above described material I have arranged and classified in anentirely different way. The contents of these volumes will be found divided upinto so many chapters or separate books, each complete by itself. And thematerial in each book will be seen to be consistent and appertain to parts ofthe magical technique which are placed with it. The Table of Contents describesmy method of arrangement.Clearly from these disclosures there may be drastic results. But the good, Itrust, will immeasurably and ultimately outweigh whatever evil may come. Thatsome careless people will hurt themselves and burn their fingers experimentingwith matters not wholly understood seems almost inevitable. Theirs, however,will be the fault. For the formulae of Magic require intensive study prior toexperimental work. And since all the important formulae are given in theirentirety, and nothing withheld that is of the least value, there should be noexcuse for anybody harming himself. No serious hurt should come to anyone. Onthe contrary, the gain to those serious students of Magic and Mysticism who haveinitiative and yet refuse to involve themselves with corrupt occidt orders, andit is to these that I fain would speak, should be immeasurable.You are being given a complete system of attainment. This you must study anddevelop at your own leisure, applying it in your own particular way. The systemis complete and effectual, as well as noble. The grade rituals as I shallreproduce them have been tampered with, in some cases unintelligently. Theirefficacy, however, is not impaired, for the principal portion of those graderituals, which teaches the art of invocation, is in<86>tact. So that the unwise editing that they have received in the past severalyears has not actually damaged them; all that has been removed are a few items,more or less important, of Qabalistic knowledge. If the reader feels that thesemight be value to him, and for the sake of tolerable completeness would like tohave them, by Studying such Qabalistic texts as the Zohar and the SepherYetzirah both of which are now in English translation, or some such work asWaite’s Holy Kaballah, he will be in possession of the fundamental facts. It isin other parts of the Order work that injudicious tampering has been at work.Most of this is now restored and I believe that this book is an accuraterepresentation of the whole of the Order work from Neophyte to Theoricus AdeptusMinor.Some portions of the manuscripts have required editing, principally from theliterary point of view. Whole paragraphs have had to be deleted, othersshortened, sentences made more clear, the redundant use of many wordseliminated, and a general coordination of the manuscripts undertaken. Certainother sections—those dealing at length with Talismans, Sigils, Clairvoyance,Gcomancy and the Enochian Tablets—have been completely rewritten to render themmore coherent. But nothing that is essential or vital to the magical tenor orunderstanding of any document will be omitted, changed or altered. This I avowand publicly swear. Where personally I have seen fit to make comment on anymatter in order to clarify the issue or to indicate its antecedents, orconnections in other parts of the work, that comment or remark is so marked byme with initials.Let me therefore urge upon the sincere reader whose<8/>wish it is to study this magical system, to pay great attention to the scheme ofthe grade rituals, to obtain a bird’s eye view of the whole, to study everypoint, its movement and teaching. This should be repeated again and again, untilthe mind moves easily from one point of the ritual to another. The syntheticoutline of those rituals presented in this Introduction should be found helpfulas assisting in this task. Let him also study the diagrams of the Templelay-out, and build up in his imagination a clear and vivid picture of thatTemple together with the appropriate officers and their movements. Then it willbe an easy matter to devise a simple form of self-initiation. It will be simpleto adapt the text to solo performance. But a careful scrutiny and examination ofthe entire system should long precede any effort to do practical work, ifserious harm and danger is to be avoided. The language needs first of all to bemastered, and the symbolic ideas of the whole system assimilated andincorporated into the very fibre of one’s being. Intellectual acquaintance withevery aspect of the subject is just as necessary as personal integrity andselfless devotion to an ideal. Sincerity is indeed the most trustworthy shieldand buckler that any student may possess, but if he neglects the intellectualmastery of the subject, he will soon discover where his heel of Achilles islocated. But these two combined are the only safeguards, the fundamentalrequisites to an insight into the significance of Magic. Not only are they theonly sure foundation, but they conduce to the continual recollection of the goalat the end, which understanding arises through penetrating to the root of thematter, without which the student may stray but too readily from the<88>narrow way stretching before him. No matter how brilliant his intellectualcapacity, no matter how ardent his sincerity or potent his dormant magicalpower, always must he remember that they matter absolutely in no way unlessapplied to the Great Work—the knowledge and conversation of the Higher andDivine Genius. “Power without wisdom,” said a poet, “is the name of Death.” Andas Frater D. D. C. F. so rightly said of one phase of magical work, but whichhas its application to the whole scheme, “Know thou that this is not to be donelightly for thine amusement or experiment, seeing that the forces of Nature werenot created to be thy plaything or toy. Unless thou doest thy practical magicalworks with solemnity, ceremony and reverence, thou shalt be like an infantplaying with fire, and thou shalt bring destruction upon thyself.” In deviationfrom these injunctions lie the only actual dangers in the divine science.One of the essentials of preliminary work, is the committing to memory of theimportant correspondences and attributions. And I cannot insist too stronglythat this is fundamental. The student must make himself familiar first of allwith the Hebrew Alphabet, and learn how to write the names of the Sephiroth andDeity Names in that tongue—he will realise their value when he approaches thepractical work of invocation. Much time should be spent studying and meditatingupon the glyph of the Tree of Life and memorising all the importantattributions—divine Names, names of Archangels, Angels and Spheres and elements.All the symbols referred to the Iamens of the officers should be carefullymeditated upon, as also the various admission badges, and other<89>symbols given in the knowledge lectures. Above all, a great deal of time andattention should be paid to the Middle Pillar technique and the VibratoryFormulae of divine names.The student can easily adapt any fair-sized room to the exigencies of a Temple.The writer has worked in one hardly larger than a long cupboard, about ten feetlong by six or seven wide. All furniture from the centre should be cleared away,leaving a central space in which one may freely move and work. A small tablecovered with a black cloth will suffice for the Altar, and the two Pillars maybe dispensed with but formulated in the imagination as present. He may find itvery useful to paint flashing Angelic Tablets according to the instructionsfound elsewhere, as well as the Banners of the East and West, placing these inthe appropriate cardinal quarters of his improvised Temple. If he is able toobtain small plaster-casts of the heads of the Kerubim—the lion, the eagle, bulland man—and place these in the proper stations, they will be found together withthe Tablets to impart a considerable amount of magical vitality and atmosphereto the Temple. What actually they do bestow is rather subtle, and perhapsindefinable. They are not absolute essentials, however, and may be dispensedwith. But since Magic works by the intervention of symbol and emblem, thesurrounding of the student’s sphere with the correct forms of magical symbolism,assists in the impressing of those symbols within the aura or sphere ofsensation, the true magical Temple. This may be left to the ingenium and theconvenience of the student himself to discover after having made a closeexamination of the documents involved.<9°>Another matter upon which brief comment must be made concerns the Instruments.It would have given me great pleasure to have had illustrations of thesereproduced in colour, for only thus can one appreciate their significance andthe part they play in ceremonial. But this unfortunately has not been possible.Thus they are given only in black and white, which obviously cannot impartanything but the merest fraction of their actual beauty and suggestiveness. AndT impress upon the serious student, even implore him, to betake upon himself thetrouble of making these instruments himself. They are very simple to fashion.And the results obtained, to say little of the knowledge acquired or theintuitive processes that somehow are stimulated by that effort, are well wortheven a great deal of bother. To adopt temporarily part of the terminology nowcurrent among analytical psychologists, and identify the latent spiritual selfof man with what is known as the Unconscious, then be it remembered that thisvast subterranean stream of vitality and memory and inspiration can only bereached by means of a symbol. For the latter, states Jung, “is the primitiveexpression of the Unconscious, while on the other hand it is an ideacorresponding to the highest intuition produced by consciousness.” Thus theseweapons and magical instruments are symbolic representations of psychic events,of forces inhering within the potentiality of the inner man. By means of theirpersonal manufacture, magical consecration and continual employment they may bemade to affect and stimulate the dormant side of man’s nature. It is aninteresting fact that in his practice, Jung encouraged his patients to paintsymbolic designs which sometimes<9r>were comparable to the Eastern mandalas. It seems that the effort to paint thesedesigns had the effect of straightening out stresses and knots in theunconscious, thus accomplishing the therapeutic object of the analysis. And notonly were they thus means of self-expression but these designs produced acounter-effect of fascinating, healing and stimulating to renewed activity thehitherto unmanifested psyche.With the exception that the ordinary magical student is not neurotic orpsychopathic, the techniques are rather similar. For the magical tradition hasalways insisted upon the routine to be followed by the aspirant to that art. Hewas required to fashion the implements himself, and the more laborious he foundthat task, with the greater difficulties thrown before him, by so much more werethose efforts of spiritual value. For not only are these instruments symbols orexpressions of inner realities, but what is infinitely more of practical worth,their actual projection in this way from within outwards, the physicalfashioning and painting of these instruments, also works an effect. They bringto life the man that was asleep. They react upon their maker. They becomepowerful magical agents, true talismans of power.Thus, the Lotus Wand is declared in the Ritual to have the colours of the twelvesigns of the Zodiac painted on its stem, and it is surmounted by the Lotusflower of Isis. It symbolises the development of creation. The Wand has everbeen a symbol of the magical Will, the power of the spirit in action. And itsdescription in the instruction on the Lotus Wand is such that it is seen toembrace the whole of nature—the Sephiroth, the spiritual aspects of theelements, and the action of the Sun<92>upon all life by a differentiating process. Even as the whole of nature is theembodiment of a dynamic will, the visible form and vehicle of a spiritualconsciousness. The Lotus flower grows from the darkness and gloom of the secretdepths, through the waters, ever striving to open its blossoms on the surface ofthe waters to the rays of light of the Sun. So is the true magical or spiritualwill secreted within the hidden depths of the soul of man. Unseen, sometimesunknown and unsuspected, it lies latent through the whole of the life. By theserites of Magic, its symbols and exercises, we are enabled to assist its growthand development, by piercing through the outer husks of the restricting shell,until it bursts into full bloom—the flower of the human spirit, the Lotus of thehigher Soul. “Look for the flower to bloom in the silence .... It shall grow, itwill shoot up, it will make branches and leaves and form buds while the stormcontinues, while the battle lasts .... It is the flower of the soul that hasopened.” Note, moreover, the description of and the comment made by Jung to asymbolic design brought to him by one of his patients, evidently a design liketo the Lotus Wand, for he says: “The plant is frequently a structure inbrilliant fiery colours and is shown growing out of a bed of darkness andcarrying the blossom of light at the top, a symbol similar to the Christmastree.” This is highly suggestive, and students both of Yoga and Magic will findin this curious indications of the universality of cogent symbols. Magicalprocesses and symbols are, in short, receiving confirmation at the hands ofexperimental psychology. It remains for the reader to benefit thereby.The Rose-Cross is a Lainen or badge synthesising a<93 >vast concourse of ideas, representing in a single emblem the Great Workitself—the harmonious reconciliation in one symbol of diverse and apparentlycontradictory concepts, the reconciliation of divinity and manhood. It is ahighly important symbol to be worn over the heart during every importantoperation. It is a glyph, in one sense, of the higher Genius to whose knowledgeand conversation the student is eternally aspiring. In the Rituals it isdescribed as the Key of Sigils and Rituals.The Sword is a weapon symbolising the critical dispersive faculty of the mind.It is used where force and strength are required, more particularly forbanishing than for invoking—as though conscious intellection were allied to thepower of Will. When employed in certain magical ceremonies with the pointupwards, its nature is transformed into an instrument similar to the Wand. TheElemental weapons of the Wand, Cup, Dagger, and Pentacle are symbolicalrepresentations of the forces employed for the manifestation of the inner self,the elements required for the incarnation of the divine. They are attributed tothe four letters of Tetragrammaton. All of these are worth making, and bycreating them and continually employing them intelligently in the ways shown bythe various rituals, the student will find a new power developing within him, anew centre of life building itself up from within.One last word of caution. Let me warn the student against attempting difficultand complex ceremonies before he has mastered the more simple ones. The syllabusprovided on a former page for the use of the Minor Adept grades the work ratherwell. The consecration cere<94>monies for the magical implements are, of their kind, excellent examples ofceremonial work. Classical in nature, they are simple in structure andoperation, and provide a harmonious and easily flowing ritual. A good deal ofexperience should be obtained with the constant use of these and similar typeswhich the student should himself construct along these lines. A variety ofthings may occur to his mind for which a variety of operations may be performed.This of course, applies only to that phase of his studies when the preliminarycorrespondences and attributions have been thoroughly memorised and what ismore, understood, and when the meditations have been performed. This likewise isanother matter upon which too much emphasis cannot be laid.Above all, the Pentagram and Hexagram rituals should be committed to memory sothat no effort is required to recall at a moment’s notice the points or anglesof these figures from which the invocation of a certain force commences. Shortceremonies should be devised having as their object the frequent use of theselineal figures so that they become a part of the very manner in which the mindworks during ceremonial. After some time has elapsed, and after considerableexperience with the more simple consecration formulae, the student feeling moreconfident of himself and his ritualistic capacity, let him turn to the complexceremonies whose formulae are summarised in the manuscripts Z. 2. These requiremuch preparation, intensive study, and a great deal of rehearsal and experience.Moreover, he must not be disappointed if, at first, the results fall short ofhis anticipations. Persistence is an admirable and necessary virtue,particularly in Magic. And let him endeavour to<95>penetrate into the reasons for the apparent worthlessness or puerility of theaims of these formulae, such as transformation, evocation, invisibility, byreflection on the spiritual forces which must flow through him in order toeffect such ends. And let him beware of the booby trap which was set up in theOrder—of doing but one of these ceremonies, or superficially employing any phaseof the system as though to pass an examination, and considering in consequencethat he is the master of the technique.My work is now done.“Let us work, therefore, my brethren and effect righteousness, because the Nightcometh when no man shall labour . .. May the Light which is behind the veilshine through you from your throne in the East on the Fratres and Sorores of theOrder and lead them to the perfect day, when the glory of this world passes anda great light shines over the splendid sea.”<9^>First Knowledge Lecture1.

As is trueof every language, in Hebrew there are several quite distinct dialects. Thereare, however, two principal ones which should be mentioned. The Ashkenazic, adialect mostly in employment in Germany, Poland, and Russia; and the Sephardicused in Spain, Portugal, and the Mediterranean generally. Now since the Qabalahattained its prominence in Spain, most Qabalists have employed the Sephardicdialect. Personally I have found that the Ashkenazic dialect answers more nearlythan the other to the requirements of transliteration into English, and manyproblems that have assailed modern students would have been non-existent hadthey known of the pronunciation which I employed in my former works. Actually,however, the student must discover which of these two suits his own personalpredilection and answers to the necessity imposed by the results of study andexperience. The Order teaching employs the Sephardic pronunciation, and I havenot ventured to interfere with that in any way at all. I simply mention thematter here to render impossible the likelihood of confusion arising. I. R.)<I04>MEDITATION No. 1Let the Neophyteconsider a point as defined in mathematics—having position, but no magnitude—andlet him note the ideas to which this gives rise. Concentrating his faculties onthis, as a focus, let him endeavour to realise the Immanance of the Divinethroughout Nature, in all her aspects.Begin by finding a position, balanced, but sufficiently comfortable. Breatherhythmically until the body is still and the mind quiet. Keep this state for afew minutes at first—and for longer as you get more used to preventing the mindfrom wandering. Think now of the subject for meditation in a general way—thenchoose out one thought or image and follow that to its conclusion.The simplest rhythm for the beginner is the Fourfold Breath.1. Empty the lungs and remain thus while counting 4.2. Inhale, counting 4 so that you feel filled with breath to the throat.3. Hold this breath while counting 4.4. Exhale, counting 4 till the lungs are empty.This should be practised, counting slowly or quickly till you obtain a rhythmthat suits you—one that is comforting and stilling.Having attained this, count the breath thus for two or three minutes, till youfeel quiet, and then proceed with the meditation.<IOS>THE LESSER RITUAL OF THE PENTAGRAMTake a steel dagger in the right hand. Face East.Invoking Touch thy foreheadand say ateh (thou art)Touch thy breastand say malkuth (the Kingdom)Touch thy right shoulderand say ve-ceburaii (and the Power)Touch thy left shoulderand say ve-cedulah (and the Glory)Clasp thy hands before thee and say le-olam (for ever)Dagger between fingers, point up and say amen.Make in the Air toward the East the invoking pentagram as shown and, bringingthe point of the dagger to the centre of the Pentagram, vibrate the deity name—yod he vau he—imagining that your voice carries forward to the East of theUniverse.Holding the dagger out before you, go to the South, make the Pentagram andvibrate similarly the deity name—Adonai.Go to the West, make the Pentagram and vibrate Eheieh.Go to the North, make the Pentagram and vibrate Agla.Picture #1 [images/img_0001.png]<io6>Return to the East and complete your circle by bringing the dagger point to thecentre of the first Pentagram.Stand with arms outstretched in the form of a cross and say:—Before me Behind me At my right hand At my left handRaphaelGabrielMichaelAurielBefore me flames the pentagram— Behind me shines the six-rayed starAgain make the Qabalistic Cross as directed above, saying ateh, etc.For Banishing use the same Ritual, but reversing the direction of the lines ofthe Pentagram.<I07>THE USES OF THE PENTAGRAM RITUAL1. As a form of prayer the invoking ritual should be used in the morning—thebanishing in the evening.Picture #2 [images/img_0002.png]The names should be pronounced inwardly in the breath vibrating it as much aspossible and feeling tjiat the whole body throbs with the sound and sends out awave of vibration directed to the ends of the quarter.2. As a protection against impure magnetism. The Banishing Ritual can be used toget rid of obsessing or disturbing thoughts. Give a mental image to yourobsession and imagine it formulated before you. Project it out of your aura withthe Saluting Sign of a Neophyte, and when it is away about three feet, preventits return with the Sign of Silence.Now imagine the form in the East before you and do the Banishing Ritual of thePentagram to disintegrate it, seeing it, in your mind’s eye, dissolving on thefurther side of your ring of flame.3. It can be used as an exercise in concentration. Seated in meditation or lyingdown, formulate yourself standing up in robes and holding a dagger. Put your con<io8>sciousness in this form and go to the East. Make yourself ‘feel’ there bytouching the wall, opening your eyes, stamping on the floor, etc.Begin the Ritual and go round the room mentally vibrating the words and tryingto feel them as coming from the form.Finish in the East and try to see your results in the Astral Light, then walkback and stand behind the head of your body and let yourself be re-absorbed.(In the introduction I have given instructions for the performance of theQabalistic Cross. When tracing the Pentagrams, the imagination should be exertedto visualize them as flaming stars all about one. The impression should be of afire ring studded in four places with stars of flame.Likewise, when vibrating the angelic names, the student should endeavour toimagine four vast towering figures about him. But see further in my book “TheMiddle Pillar.” I. R.)< i°9>THE PILLARSIn the explanation of the Symbols of the Grade of Neophyte, your attention hasbeen directed to the general mystical meaning of the Two Pillars called in theRitual the “Pillars of Hermes” of “Seth” and of “Solomon.” In the 9th chapter ofthe Ritual of the Dead they are referred to as the “Pillars of Shu,” the“Pillars of the Gods of the Dawning Light,” and also as “the North and SouthernColumns of the Gate of the Hall of Truth.” In the I25th Chapter, they arerepresented by the sacred gateway, the door to which the aspirant is broughtwhen he has completed the negative confession. The archaic pictures on the onePillar are painted in black upon a white ground, and those on the other in whiteupon a black ground, in order to express the interchange and reconciliation ofopposing forces and the eternal balance of light and darkness which gives forceto visible nature.The black cubical bases represent darkness and matter wherein the Spirit, theRuach Elohim, began to formulate the Ineffable NAME, that Name which the ancientRabbis have said “rushes through the universe,” that Name before which theDarkness rolls back at the birth of time.The flaming red triangular capitals which crown the summit of the Pillarsrepresent the Triune manifestation of the Spirit of Life, the Three Mothers ofthe Sepher Yctsirah, the Three Alchemical Principles of Nature, the Sulphur, theMercury and the Salt.Each Pillar is surmounted by its own light-bearer veiled from the materialworld.At the base of both Pillars rise the Lotus flowers, sym<no>bols of regeneration and metempsychosis. The archaic illustrations are takenfrom vignettes of the 17th and 125th chapter of the Ritual of the Dead, theEgyptian Book of the “Per-em-Hru” or the “Book of Coming Forth into the Day,”the oldest book in the world as yet discovered. The Recension of the Priests ofON is to be found in the walls of the Pyramids of the Kings of the 5th and 6thDynasties at Sakarah, the recension of the 11th and 12th Dynasties on thesarcophagi of that period, and the Theban recension of the 18th Dynasty andonward is found on papyri, both plain and illuminated. No satisfactorytranslation of these books is available, none having been yet attempted by ascholar having the qualifications of mystic as well as Egyptologist.The Ritual of the Dead, generally speaking, is a collection of hymns and prayersin the form of a series of ceremonial Rituals to enable the man to unit himselfwith Osiris the Redeemer. After this union he is no longer called the man, butOsiris, with whom he is now symbolically identified. “That they also may be Oneof us,” said the Christ of the New Testament. “I am Osiris” said the purifiedand justified man, his soul luminous and washed from sin in the immortal anduncreated light, united to Osiris, and thereby justified, and the son of God;purified by suffering, strengthened by opposition, regenerate throughself-sacrifice. Such is the subject of the great Egyptian Ritual.The 17th Chapter of the Theban recension consists of a very ancient text withseveral commentaries, also extremely old, and some prayers, none of which comeinto the scheme of the original text. It has, together with the 12th chapter,been very carefully translated for the pur<in>pose of this lecture by the V. H. Frater M. W. T., and the V. H. Soror S. S. D,D. has made many valuable suggestions with regard to the interpretation. TheTitle and Preface of the 17th Chapter reads:“Concerning the exaltation of the Glorified Ones, of Coming and Going forth inthe Divine Domain, of the Genies of the Beautiful land of Amentet. Of Comingforth in the light of Day in any form desired, of Hearing the Forces of Natureby being enshrined as a living Bai.”And the rubric is:“The united with Osiris shall recite it when he has entered the Harbour, Mayglorious things be done thereby upon earth. May all the words of the Adept befulfilled.”Owing to the complex use of symbols, the ritual translation of the Chapter canonly be understood by perpetual reference to the ancient Egyptian commentaries,and therefore the following paraphrase has been put together to convey to modernminds as nearly as possible the ideas conceived by the old Egyptians in thisglorious triumphal song of the Soul of Man made one with Osiris, the Redeemer.“I am TUM made One with all things.“I have become NU. I am RA in his rising ruling by right of his Power. I am theGreat God self-begotten, even NU, who pronounced His Names, and thus the Circleof the Gods was created.“I am Yesterday and know Tomorrow. I can never more be overcome. I know thesecret of Osiris, whose being is perpetually revered of RA. I have finished thework which was planned at the Beginning,! am the Spirit made manifest, and armedwith two vast eagle’s plumes. Isis and Nephthys are their names, made One withOsiris.<U2>“I claim my inheritance. My sins have been uprooted and my passions overcome. Iam Pure White. I dwell in Time. I live through Eternity, when Initiates makeoffering to the Everlasting Gods. I have passed along the Pathway. I know theNorthern and the Southern Pillars, the two Columns at the Gateway of the Hall ofTruth.“Stretch unto me your hands, O ye Dwellers in the centre. For I am transformedto a God in your midst. Made One with Osiris, I have filled the eye socket inthe day of the morning when Good and Evil fought together.“I have lifted up the cloud-veil in the Sky of the Storm. Till T saw RA bornagain from out the Great Waters. His strength is my strength, and my strength isHis strength. Homage to you, Lords of Truth, chiefs who Osiris rules. Grantingrelease from Sin, Followers of Ma where rest is Glorious. Whose Throne Anubisbuilt in the day when Osiris said:“Lo! A man wins his way to Amcntet. I come before you, to drive away my faults.As ye did to the Seven Glorious Ones who follow their Lord Osiris. I am thatSpirit of Earth and Sun.“Between the Two Pillars of Flame. I am RA when he fought beneath the AshadTree, destroying the enemies of the Ancient of Days, I am the Dweller in theEgg. I am he who turns in the Disc. I shine forth from the Horizon, as the goldfrom the mine. I float through the Pillars of SHU in the ether. Without a peeramong the Gods. The Breath of my mouth is as a flame. I light upon the Earthwith my glory. Eye cannot gaze on my darting beams, as they reach through theHeavens and lick up the Nile with tongues of flame. I am strong upon Earth withthe strength of RA. I have come into Harbour as<II3>Osiris made perfect. Let priestly offerings be made to me as one in the train ofthe ancient of Days. I brood as the Divine Spirit. I move in the firmness of myStrength. I undulate as the Waves that vibrate through Eternity. Osiris has beenclaimed with acclamation, and ordained to rule among the Gods. Enthroned in theDomain of Horus where the Spirit and the Body are united in the presence of theAncient of Days. Blotted out are the sins of his body in passion. He has passedthe Eternal Gate, and has received the New Year Feast with Incense, at themarriage of Earth with Heaven.“TUM has built his Bridal Chamber. RURURET has founded his shrine. TheProcession’s completed. HORUS has purified, SET has consecrated, SHU made onewith OSIRIS, has entered his heritage.“As TUM he has entered the Kingdom to complete union with the Invisible. ThyBride, O Osiris, is Isis, who mourned Thee when she found Thee slain. In Isis,thou art born again. From Nephthys is thy nourishment. They cleansed thee in thyHeavenly Birth. Youth waits upon thee, ardour is ready at thy hand. And theirarms shall uphold thee for millions of years. Initiates surround Thee and Thineenemies are cast down. The Powers of Darkness are destroyed. The Companions ofThy Joys are with Thee. Thy Victories in the Battle await their reward in thePillar. The Forces of Nature obey Thee. Thy Power is exceeding great. The Godscurse him that curseth Thee. Thine Aspirations are fulfilled. Thou art theMistress of Splendour. They are destroyed who barred Thy way.”The 125th Chapter is concerned with the entry of an Initiate into the Hall ofthe Two Columns of Justice, and<H4>commenced with a most beautiful and symbolic description of Death, as a journeyfrom the barren wilderness of Earth, to the Glorious Land which lies beyond. Theliteral translation of the opening lines is as follows:“I have come from afar to look upon thy beauties. My hands salute Thy Name ofJustice. 1 have come from afar, where the Acacia Tree grew not. Where the treethick with leaves is not born. Where there come not beams from herb or grass. Ihave entered the Place of Mystery. I have communed with Set. Sleep came upon me,I was wrapped therein, bowing down before the hidden things. I was ushered intothe House of Osiris. I saw the marvels that were there. The Princes of the Gatesin their Glory.”The illustrations in this chapter represent the Hall of Truth as seen throughthe open leaves of its door. The Hall is presided over by a God who holds hisright hand over the cage of a hawk, and his left over the food of eternity. Oneach side of the God is a cornice crowned by a row of alternate feathers andUraei symbolising justice and fiery power. The door leaf which completes theright hand of a stall is called “Possessor of Truth controlling the Feet,” whilethat on the left is “Possessor of strength, binding the male and femaleanimals.” The 42 Judges of the Dead are represented as seated in a long row, andeach of them has to be named, and the Sin over which he presided has beendenied.This chapter describes the introduction of the initiate into the Hall of Truthby ANUBIS, who, having questioned the aspirant, receives from him an account ofhis Initiation, and is satisfied by his right to enter. He states that he hasbeen taken into the ante-chamber of the<H5>Temple and there stripped and blind-folded, he had to grope for the entrance ofthe Hall, and having found it, he was reclothed and annointed in the presence ofthe Initiated. He is then asked for the Pass-words and demands that his Soulshould be weighed in the Great Balance of the Hall of Truth, whereupon ANUBISagain interrogates him concerning the symbolism of the door of the Hall, and hisanswers being found correct, ANUBIS says: “Pass on, thou knowest it.”Among other things the Initiate states that he has been purified four times, thesame number of times that the Neophyte is purified and consecrated in theceremony of the Neophyte. He then makes the long Negative Confession, stating toeach Judge in turn that he is innocent of that form of Sin over which he judges.Then he invokes the Judges to do him justice, and afterwards describes how hehad washed in the washing place of the South, and rested in the North, in theplace called “Son of the Deliverers” and he becomes the Dweller under the OliveTree of Peace, and how he was given a tall flame of fire and a sceptre of cloudwhich he preserved in the salting tank in which mummies were swathed. And hefound there another sceptre called “Giver of Breath” and with that heextinguished the flame and shattered the sceptre of cloud, and made a lake ofit. The initiate is then brought to the actual Pillars, and has to name them andtheir parts under the symbol of the Scales of a Balance. He also has to name theGuardian of the Gateway, who prevents his passage, and when all these arepropitiated, the plea of the Hall itself cries out against his steps, saying“Because I am silent, because I am pure,” and it must know that his aspirationsare pure enough and high<n6>enough for him to be allowed to tread upon it. He is then allowed to announce toThoth that he is clean from all evil, and has overcome the influence of theplanets, and THOTH says to him: “Who is He whose Pylons are of Flame, whosewralls of Living Uraei, and the flames of whose House are streams of Water?” Andthe Initiate replies “Osiris!”And it is immediately proclaimed: “Thy meat shall be from the Infinite, and thydrink from the Infinite. Thou art able to go forth to the sepulchral feasts onearth, for thou hast overcome.”Thus, these two chapters, which are represented by their illustrations upon thePillars, represent the advance and purification of the Soul and its union withOsiris, the Redeemer, in the Golden Dawn of the Infinite Light, in which theSoul is transfigured, knows all, and can do all, for it is made One with theEternal God.KHABSAMPEKHTKONXOMPAXLIGHTINEXTENSION!<H7>Second Knowledge LectureThe Names and Alchemical Symbols of the Three Principles of Nature are:—SULPHUR 4 MERCURY $ SALT ©The Metals Attributed to the Planets in Alchemy are:—LEAD 1?

R.M. D.In the Tree of Life in the Tarot, each path forms the connecting link betweentwo of the Sephiroth. The King and the Queen are the correlations of the Abbaand the Alma in that suit; the Knight or Prince answers to Microprosopus, andthe Knave or Princess which was anciently a female figure, is referred to theBride, Kallah or Malkah.Combining, then, the material attributions of the Sephiroth and the Path, itresults that:0. Fool—The Crown of Wisdom, the Primum Mobile, acting through the Air on theZodiac.1. The Juggler—The Crown of Understanding, the beginning of material production,the Primum Mobile acting through the Philosophic Mercury on Saturn.2.

It shows in a glyph theteaching proper to the Practicus on entering the Sephirah HOD which he hasreached by the Paths of SHIN and RESH from MALKUTH and YESOD respectively.At the summit are the THREE SUPERNAL SEPHIROTH summed up into ONE—AIMA ELOHIM,the Mother Supernal—The Woman of the Apocalypse (Chap. 12) clothed with the SUN,the MOON under her feet, and on her head the Crown of Twelve Stars.It is written ‘So the Name JEHOVAH is joined to the Name ELOHIM, for JEHOVAHplanted a Garden Eastward in Eden.’From the Three Supernals follow the other Sephiroth of THE TREE OF LIFE. Belowthe TREE, proceeding from MALKUTH is THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE of GOOD AND of EVILwhich is between the Tree of Life and the World or Assiah or Shells, representedby the Coiled Up DRAGON with Seven Heads and Ten Horns—being the Seven InfernalPalaces and the Ten Averse Sephiroth. (These are described in the text of theRituals but are not read to the Candidate at his Grade. When studying thisdiagram, these descriptions should be looked up, but they are not required forthe exam.)The River NAHER flows forth from the Supernal Eden and in DAATH it is dividedinto Four Heads:—<144>PI SON: Fire—flowing to GEBURAII where there is Gold.GIHON: Water—the Waters of Mercy, flowing into CHESED.HIDDIKEL: Air—flowing into TIPHARETH.PHRATH (Euphrates): Earth — flowing into MALKUTH.It is written “In DAATH the Depths are broken up and the Clouds drop down dew.”The word Naher has the meaning ‘perennial stream' —‘never failing waters’ asopposed to other words meaning Torrent or Brook.The River going out of Eden is the River of the Apocalypse, the Waters of Life,clear as crystal proceeding from the Throne, on either side of the Tree of Life,bearing all manner of Fruit.Thus the Rivers form a Cross and on it The GREAT ADAM, the SON who is to rulethe Nations, was extended from TIPHARETH and his arms stretch out to GEBURAH ANDGEDULAH, and in MALKUTH is EVE, supporting with her hands the TWO PILLARS.<H5>Picture #14 [images/img_0014.png]Picture #15 [images/img_0015.png]ON THE GENERAL GUIDANCE AND PURIFICATION OF THE SOULLearn first, O Practicus of our Ancient Order, that true Equilibrium is thebasis of the Soul. If thou thyself hast not a sure foundation, whereon wilt thoustand to direct the forces of Nature?Know then that as Man is born into this world amidst the darkness of Nature andthe strife of contending forces, so must his first endeavour be to seek theLight through their reconciliation. Thus, thou who hast trial and trouble ofthis life, rejoice because of them, for in them is strength, and by their meansis a pathway opened unto that Light Divine.How should it be otherwise, O man, whose life is but a day in Eternity a drop inthe Ocean of Time? How, if thy trials were not many, couldst thou purge thy soulfrom the dross of Earth?Is it but now that the higher life is beset with dangers and difficulties; hathit not been ever thus with the Sages and Hierophants of the Past? They have beenpersecuted and reviled, they have been tormented of men, yet through this hastheir glory increased. Rejoice, therefore, O Initiate, for the greater thytrial, the brighter thy triumph. When men shall revile thee and speak againstthee falsely, hath not the Master said “Blessed art thou.” Yet, O Practicus, letthy victories bring thee not vanity, for with increase of knowledge should comeincrease of wisdom. He who knows little, thinketh he knows much; but he whoknoweth much hath learned his own ignorance. Seest thou a Man wise in his ownconceit? There is more hope of a fool than of him.<i46>Be not hasty to condemn other’s sin. How knowest thou that in their place thoucouldst have resisted the temptation? And even were it so, why shouldst thoudespise one who is weaker than thyself? Be thou well sure of this, that inslander and self-righteousness is sin. Pardon therefore the sinner, butencourage not the sin. The Master condemned not the adulterous woman, butneither did he encourage her to commit the sin.Thou therefore who desirest magical gifts, be sure that thy soul is firm andsteadfast, for it is by flattering thy weakness that the Evil One will gainpower over thee. Humble thyself before thy God, yet fear neither man nor spirit.Fear is failure and the forerunner of failure; and courage is the beginning ofvirtue. Therefore fear not the Spirits, but be firm and courteous with them, forthou hast no right either to despise or to revile them, and this too may leadthee into sin. Command and banish the Evil ones. Curse them by the Great Namesof God, if need be; but neither mock nor revile them, for so assuredly thou wiltbe led into error.A man is what he maketh himself within the limits fixed by his inheriteddestiny; he is a part of mankind. His actions affect not himself only, but alsothose with whom he is brought into contact, either for good or for evil.Neither worship nor neglect the physical body, which is thy temporary connectionwith the outer and material world. Therefore let thy mental equilibrium be abovedisturbances by material events. Restrain the animal passions and nourish thehigher aspirations; the emotions are purified by suffering.Do good unto others for God’s sake, not for reward,<i47>not for gratitude from them, not for sympathy. If thou art generous, thou wiltnot long for thine ears to be tickled by expressions of gratitude. Remember thatunbalanced force is evil, that unbalanced severity is but cruelty andoppression, but that also unbalanced Mercy is but weakness which would allow andabet evil.True prayer is as much action as Word; it is Will. The Gods will not do for manwhat his Higher Powers can do for himself, if he cultivate Will and Wisdom.Remember that this Earth is but an atom in the Universe, and thou thyself but anatom thereon. And that even couldst thou become the God of this Earth whereonthou crawlest and grovellest, thou wouldst even then be but an atom and oneamong many. Nevertheless, have the greatest self-respect, and to that end sinnot against thyself. The sin which is unpardonable is knowingly and wilfully toreject spiritual truth, but every sin and act leaveth its effect.To obtain magical Power, learn to control thought. Admit only true ideas whichare in harmony with the end desired, and not every stray and contradictory ideathat presents itself. Fixed thought is a means to an end; therefore payattention to the power of silent thought and meditation. The material act is butthe outward expression of the thought, and therefore it hath been said that “thethought of foolishness is sin.” Thought therefore is the commencement of action,and if a chance thought can produce much effect, what cannot fixed thought do?Therefore, as has been already said, establish thyself firmly in the Equilibriumof Forces, in the centre of the cross of the elements, that Cross from whosecentre the creative word issued in the birth of the dawning universe.<H8>As it was said unto thee in the Grade of Theoricus: “Be thou therefore promptand active as the Sylphs, but avoid frivolity and caprice. Be energetic andstrong like the Salamanders, but avoid irritability and ferocity. Be flexibleand attentive to images like the Undines, but avoid idleness and changeability.Be laborious and patient like the Gnomes, but avoid grossness and avarice.” Soshalt thou gradually develop the powers of thy Soul and fit thyself to commandthe spirits of the elements.For wert thou to summon the Gnomes to pander to thy avarice, thou wouldst nolonger command them, but they would command thee. Wouldst thou abuse the purecreatures of God’s creation to fill thy coffers and to satisfy thy lust forGold? Wouldst thou defile the Spirits of driving Fire to serve thy wrath andhatred? Wouldst thou violate the purity of the Souls of the Water to pander tothy lust and debauchery? Wouldst thou force the Spirits of the evening breeze tominister to thy folly and caprice?Know that with such desires thou canst but attract the evil and not the good,and in that can the evil will have power over thee.In true religion there is no sect. Therefore take heed that thou blaspheme notthe name by which another knoweth his God for if thou doest this thing inJupiter, thou wilt blaspheme YHVH; and in Osiris YEHESHUAH.“Ask of God and ye shall have,Seek and ye shall find.Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.”<H9>THE GARDEN OF EDEN AFTER THE FALLThis diagram is described in the Philosophus Ritual. It shows in a glyph theteaching proper to a Philosophus on entering the Sephirah NETZACH which he hasreached by the Three Paths of QOPH, TZADDI, AND PEH from the SEPHIROTH—MALKUTH,YESOD and HOD respectively.The Great Goddess EVE, being tempted by the fruits of the TREE OF KNOWLEDGEwhose branches tend upwards to the seven lower Sephiroth, but also downward tothe Kingdom of Shells, reached down to them and the two pillars were leftunsupported.Then the Sephirotic Tree was shattered. She fell and with her fell the GreatADAM. And the Great Red Dragon arose with his seven heads and ten horns, andEDEN was desolated—and the folds of the Dragon enclosed MALKUTH and linked it tothe Kingdom of the Shells.And the heads of the Dragon rose into the seven lower Sephiroth, even up toDAATH at the feet of Aima Elohim.Thus were the four Rivers of EDEN desecrated and the Dragon Mouth gave forth theInfernal Waters in DAATH—and this is LEVIATHAN, The Piercing and CrookedSerpent.But TETRAGRAMMATON ELOHIM placed the Four Letters YHVH of the NAME and theFlaming Sword of the Ten Sephiroth between the devastated Garden and theSupernal Eden, that this should not be involved in the Fall of ADAM.<IS°>And it became necessary that a Second Adam should arise to restore the System,and thus, as ADAM had been spread on the Cross of the Four Rivers, so the SecondADAM should be crucified on the Infernal Rivers of the four armed Cross ofDEATH—yet to do this He must descend into the lowest, even MALKUTH the Earth,and be born of her. (Psalm 74. ‘Thou breakest the Heads of Leviathan inpieces.’)And on the Dragon Heads were the names of the eight Kings of EDOM and on hishorns the names of the Eleven Dukes of EDOM, for DAATH having developed in theDragon a new Head, the Seven Headed Dragon with Ten Horns became Eight Headedand Eleven Horned.

It is usedwith various meanings by different writers but generally signifies Essence.The following names occur in Qabalistic writings:—AIN—the Negative PK (Nothing—Not)AIN SOPH ff10 r« (Limitless)AIN SOPH AUR hn rpa (The Limitless Light)These are the Veils of the Negative Existence depending from Kether.ARIK ANPIN r*w TIN—MACROPROSOPUS or The Vast Countenance is a title of Kether,and another of its titles is the Ancient of Days, AATIK YOMIN T01' YnV'Kether or the Vast Countenance emanates first as ABBA, the Supernal Father, andAIMA the Supernal Mother.ABBA N22N The Supernal Father is referred to YOD of Tetragrammaton, andAIMA ND'K The Supernal Mother is referred to HEH.ELOHIM C'rffs is a name given to these two Persons united.<JS3>Picture #17 [images/img_0017.png]<i54>As Elohim they become the parents of THE SON ZAUIR ANPIN pM» TiKt, also calledMICROPROSOPUS or the LESSER COUNTENANCE.ABBA is referred to YOD and the Sephira CHOKMAH. AIMA is referred to HEH and theSephirah BINAH, ZAUIR ANPIN is referred to the six Sephiroth—Chesed, Geburah,Tiphareth, Netsach, Hod, and Yesod, and of these especially to TIPHARETH.MALKAH The Queen, and KALAH FVio The Bride are titles of MALKUTH considered asthe Spouse of Zauir Anpin, the Microprosopus.The Letters of the Name YHVH contain these meanings, thus:—YOD is referred to ABBA. HEH to AIMA.VAU to ZAUIR ANPIN. HEH (final) to MALKAH.These Letters are also referred to the Four Worlds and the Four Suits of theTarot thus: —YOD HEH VAU HEH (f)ATZILUTHBRIAHYETZIRAHASSIAHWANDSCUPSSWORDSPENTACLESIn each of the Four Worlds are the Ten Sephiroth of that World, and eachSephirah has its own ten Sephiroth, making 400 Sephiroth in all — the number ofthe letter TAU, The Cross, The Universe, the Completion of all things.The Tarot is thus referred to The Tree of Life:<i55>The Four Aces are placed on the Throne of Kether— the remaining small cards ofthe suit desired on the respective Sephiroth, 2 on Chokmah, 3 on Binah, etc. The22 Trumps are then arranged on the Paths between them, according to the Lettersto which they correspond.The King and Queen of the suit are placed beside Chokmah and Binah respectively;the Knight and Knave by Tiphareth and Malkuth.Tiie Tarot Trumps thus receive the equilibrium of the Sephiroth they connect.The Admission Badges used in the grade of Philosophus are as follows:The Calvary Cross of Twelve Squares, admitting to the Path of Qoph, the 29thPath, refers to the Zodiac and to the Eternal River of Eden divided into FourHeads:Naiiar — The River \"i\"31.

Yet when you apply the Tree of Life to yourself,your right side, arm, and leg represent the side of Strength and Severity,Binah, Geburah and Hod, and your left side refers to the Pillar of Mercy. Sothat when you look at a diagram, you are looking, as it were, at a man facingyou, that your right side faces his left. His Merciful side forms the right handPillar in front of you, so that it is as if you looked at yourself in a mirror.Just as the man looks at you, so does the Moon look at you and so you say thatthe Moon in her increase is on the side of Mercy, the right hand pillar of theSephiroth; and in her decrease, the crescent is on the left hand Pillar ofSeverity.A Diagram, then, is a picture of a Man or the Moon facing you. The TemplePillars are similar:Black Pillar White Pillar Black Pillar White PillarSeverityMercyBoazJachin<i6i>Left NorthRight SouthStolistes DadouchosThat is, the white Mercy or Jachin Pillar is on your right hand as you approachthe Altar from the West and from the Hiereus. (See Chronicles II. iii, 17.) “Andcall the Name on the right hand (of him who enters) Jachin, and the Name of thaton the left, Boaz.”Now Boaz—Strength, Severity, Binah, Black Pillar; and Jachin—White Pillar ofMercy.So in making the Qabalistic Cross on your breast it is correct to touch theForehead and say Ateh—Thou art; the Heart—Malkuth; Right Shoulder, ve-Geburah;left shoulder ve-Gedulah, and with the fingers clasped on the breast say, Le,olahm, amen!(Note: The following items and attributions are those which were formerlyeliminated from the so-called knowledge lectures and rituals.

The corrosion of metals is usually of thecomplementary colour to that to which they naturally approximate. Thus Copper,which is reddish, becomes green in its corrosion of verdigris, etc.Mercury is the only planet which unites these three primary forms in one symbol.Saturn is composed of the cross and the crescent showing that Lead is corrosiveinternally and Luna externally. Jupiter is the reverse. Mars is Solar externallybut corrosive externally.Venus is opposite. Copper is externally of the nature of Gold, but internallycorrosive. Hence the name of the Sphere of Venus is Nogah—denoting ExternalSplendour but internal corruption.The Serpent Nehushtan, which Moses made when the Children of Israel were bittenby Serpents of Fire in the Wilderness, is the Serpent of the Paths of the Tree.And he set it on a pole—that is, twined it round the middle Pillar of theSephiroth. And the word used in the passage in Numbers 21 for Fiery Serpents isthe same as the Name of the Angels of Geburah, the same spelling, the samepointing, Seraphim. Round the Middle Pillar of the Sephiroth, because that isthe Reconciler between<i6s>the Fires of Geburah or Severity, and the Waters of Chesed or Mercy—and hence itis said in the New Testament that it is a type of Christ, the Reconciler. Andthe Serpent is of Brass, the Metal of Venus, whose Sphere is called Nogah, orExternal Splendour, as shewn further by the Alchemical Symbol of Venus, whereinthe Circle of the Sun is exalted above the Cross of Corrosion. And therefore itis said in the Zohar that “Alone of the Shells is the Serpent Nogah found inHoliness” and he is called the Balance of Justice. Why, then, is he called theExternal or False Splendour? Because he indeed uniteth the Paths, butcomprehendeth not the Sephiroth. Nevertheless, he is also the Celestial Serpentof Wisdom. But the Serpent of the Temptation is the Serpent of the Tree ofKnowledge of Good and of Evil, and not that of the Tree of Life.Here is a method of writing Hebrew words by the Yetsiratic attribution of theAlphabet, whence results some curious hieroglyphic symbolism. ThusTetragrammaton will be written by Virgo, Aries, Taurus, Aries. Eheieh, by Air,Aries, Virgo, Aries. From Yeheshua, the Qabalistic mode of spelling Jesus, whichis simply the Tetragrammaton with the letter Shin placed therein, we obtain avery peculiar combination—Virgo, Aries, Fire, Taurus, Aries. Virgo born of aVirgin, Aries the Sacrificial Lamb, Fire the Fire of the Holy Spirit, Taurus theOx of the Earth in whose Manger He was laid, and lastly Aries the flocks ofsheep whose Herdsmen came to worship Him. Elohim yields Air, Libra, Aries,Virgo, Water—the Firmament, the Balanced Forces, the Fire of the Spirit (ForAries is a fiery Sign), operating in the Zodiac, the Fire Goddess, and theWaters of Creation.<i66>The terms Raven or Crow, Lion and Eagle have various Alchemical significations.GenerallyRaven—Initiation through blacknessLion—-Heat and sulphurous actionEagle—SublimationOne great difference between Chemical and Alchemical processes is that Alchemyonly employs a gradual heat continually but carefully increased, and does notcommence with violent heat.The Cucurbite is a glass boiler attached to the lowrer part of the Alembic. Itconsists of a tube, a head, and a receiver added thereto for purposes ofdistillation.The Athanor or Philosophical Furnace is to produce a graduated heat.The Balneum Marine is the modern water bath—a vessel of hot water in which wasplaced the vessel to be heated.The Balneum Arenae or sand bath is a vessel of sand in which is placed thevessel to receive a dry heat.The Philosophic Egg is an oval glass vessel in which is placed the water orliquid to be acted upon, and which may be hermetically sealed.<i67>This represents the Alchemical Symbol of Sulphur on the Tree of Life. It doesnot touch the four lower Sephiroth. The Cross terminates in Tiphareth, whereby,as it were, the Supernal Triangle is to be grasped, and Tiphareth is thepurified Man.Picture #22 [images/img_0022.png]The Hexagram of Tiphareth is formed from the Pillars on each side. In Chesed isthe Water triangle, in Geburah the Fire triangle. And Tiphareth unites andreconciles them so as to form a reconciliation between them in the form of thehexagram.The Symbol of Salt on the Tree of Life embraces all the Sephiroth but Malkuth,and is as it were, the Reconciler between the Sulphur and Mercury. Thehorizontal dividing line implies the precept of Hermes “as above so below.”Picture #23 [images/img_0023.png]O<i68>The drawing represents the Trinity operating through the Sephiroth and reflecteddownwards in the four triangles of the Elements. Air is reflected from Ketherthrough Tiphareth to Ycsod. Water is reflected from Binah through Chesed to Hod;Fire is reflected from Chokmah through Geburah to Netzach; while Earth isMalkuth, the receptacle of the other Three.Picture #24 [images/img_0024.png]<i^9>(Note: The following Angelic Names have been assembled and tabulatedsystematically from a Philosophus manuscript entitled “The Lecture on theShemhamphoresch.” This document deals principally with the traditional modes offorming Angelic Names. It describes how various verses are taken from the bookof Exodus, and by methods of permutation, are formed into seventy two names ofthree letters each. To each of these names is added the suffix Yah or El, thusyielding angelic names and formulae. These seventy two Angels are allotted toeach quinary, or division of 5°, in the celestial heavens, so that with theother names a very complete hierarchy is given. Thus every Sign of the Zodiachas an Archangel, Angel, Angel of its corresponding house, and a vastsubhierarchy.Too much space would have been consumed to detail the methods by which thesenames are given. So I have contented myself to list, simply, all the Archangelicand Angelic Names of the twelve Zodiacal Signs, and state that they are veryimportant names, and their arrangement should be carefully studied. Thedocuments on Tarot attribute two of these Angels to each of the 36 small cards,and the anglicised transliteration of their names will there be found. But Ihave thought it advisable here to give the Hebrew letters and spelling so thatthe student may have them at his hand when dealing with the matters of Sigitsand Telesmatic Images, which are, as elsewhere explained, formed from the Hebrewspellings.

A Thesis on the Rituals.2. A meditation on the crosses which have been used as admission badges in theGrades. This is a preparation for the meditation which precedes the ©—E Gradeand should be applied for when you have been a Portal Member for seven months.3. A complete diagram of The Tree of Life.4. The practice of control of the Aura.5. The placing of The Tree of Life in the Aura.6. Tattwas—Astrology—Divination.1. The Thesis. Read the rituals. Build them up in imagination. Compare theOpening and Closing in the various Grades. Note the general underlying schemefor each Elemental Grade—and note where the differences occur. Follow thecareers of the various Officers. Note at what Grade an Officer disappears.Make a precis of each Ritual so that the general scheme becomes apparent. Thisis of the greatest assistance when you are called on to take Office because youwill not then need to follow everything in the Ritual but need only turn to thepage where your Office is mentioned and when you have no more to say, you canturn to the Closing and put the Ritual aside till required for<i75>that. Ability to do this and to move correctly in the Temple adds greatly to theharmony and repose of the whole Ceremony,Note the positions of the various officers—what mathematical shapes they makeamong themselves from time to time as they take up their places in the Temple.It may be a triangle, a cross, a pentagram, etc.Read the speeches carefully, and read them sometimes aloud so that you getfamiliar with the sound of your own voice in saying the words. Note that somespeeches are designed to create atmosphere by their archaic form and should beread rhythmically and sonorously, while others are informative and should beread in such a way as to make their points clear.Examples of archaic passages are challenges of Gods: “Thou canst not pass theGate of the Western Heaven unless thou canst tell me my Name.” And the speechesof the Kabiri in the Grades of Practicus and Philosophus. Information is givenin speeches about Tarot Keys and diagrams.Note the technique for traversing the various Paths— the words, and the badgeswith which the Path is entered, the length of the circumambulation and thespecial symbolism described therein.Let all these things soak into your mind, make notes as ideas occur to you—andpresently your personal reaction to the Grades will crystallise out and you willbe able to write your thesis.2. Make a list and drawings of the crosses which have been given you asAdmission Radges throughout the<I76>Grades, from the Swastika of the Zelator to the Fivesquared cross which you puton as you stood at the Altar at the second point of the Portal Grade. Read whatis said of them in the Rituals and knowledge lectures, and make notes aboutthem.3. The Tree of Life. This should be done fairly large in order that the writingand symbols should be clear. It is essential to show the Deity Names, Names ofArchangels and Angels in Hebrew in the Sephiroth, and to number the Paths andgive their attributions. Apart from this, the Tree should be your personalsynthesis of the Order symbolism as it applies to the Tree of Life. Colours maybe used.4. Control of the Aura. If you are not already familiar with the parts of yourown body such as nervous system, respiratory system, digestive system, get somesimple text-book such as is used in ambulance work, or attend a course offirst-aid lectures so that, before starting to work on your subtle body, you mayknow something about your physical body.Your physical body is interpenetrated by a subtle body or aura which alsosurrounds the physical body like an egg of light. You should now begin topractise controlling this aura or Sphere of Sensation. This means that you mustfirst try to get your emotional reactions under conscious control. Instead ofautomatically liking this, disliking that, you must try to understand themechanism which underlies these feelings To assist you in this, the study ofpsychology is recommended. There are many books on the subject, of which thefollowing are easy to understand and clearly stated.<I77>Psychology by Win. McDougall (Home University Library).Psychoanalysis for Normal People by Geraldine Coster.Psycho-synthesis by the Dean of Chester Cathedral.Machinery of the Mind by Violet Firth.Having built up some idea of the mechanism of your mental processes, you shouldnow try to make yourself negative or positive at will towards people or ideas.If you are likely to meet someone who always makes you argumentative andirritable, decide that your aura is closed to their power of irritating you andthat your mind will not be disturbed by what they say. It is good sometimes tolisten to views with which you disagree to teach you not only to make no verbalresponse, but to keep your feelings in abeyance also. In this way you come tolearn how much of your disagreement is due to prejudice or personal factors, andhow much to your regard for abstract truth.Again, sometimes practise opening your aura to people or ideas in an endeavourto see things from another’s point of view.The practice of deep breathing is also of help in establishing poise and incontrolling nervousness. It is good to expand the chest to its fullest extentand then to expand the diaphragm below the ribs as well and then to let thebreath out slowly and steadily on a vowel sound such as ah or ‘0.’If you are nervy, you will find that your breathing is shallow and that yourmuscles are tense. You tend to<i78>clench your hands and tighten up the abdominal muscles. To cure this, take adeep breath to full capacity, hold it while tensing and relaxing alternately theabdominal muscles. Do this (i.e. the tensing and relaxing of the muscles) threetimes and then relax completely into a chair. Allow all your muscles to go limpand let your breath out to the last gasp. Do the whole process three times, ifnecessary. It is designed to stimulate the solar plexus which is the heart ofthe nervous system which governs emotion.Another good exercise is to say the Deity Names aloud. Take a deep breath andsay them softly, smoothly and slowly, imagining the while that your voicetravels out to the confines of the Universe. This can be done in conjunctionwith the Pentagram Ritual,5. The Tree of Life in the Aura. In the aura which interpenetrates and surroundsour physical bodies, we are to build up a replica of the Tree of Life. ThePillar of Severity is on our right side, the Pillar of Mercy on our left, andthe Pillar of Benificence in our midst.It is best to build up the middle Pillar first. To do this stand up and raiseyourself in imagination to your kether—a brilliant light above your head.Imagine this light descending to daatii, at the nape of your neck, and thence totiphareth in your heart where it glows like sunlight and whence it radiates intothe other Sephiroth. From tiphareth the light goes to yesod in the region of thehips, and thence to malkuth in which your feet are planted. Having made a clearimage of the Middle Pillar, you can then establish the other Sephiroth byvibrating<i79>THE MIDDLE PILLAR AND THE HUMAN BODY.Picture #26 [images/img_0026.png]<i8o>the Deity Names. This can be done as an alternative to the Pentagram Ritual as apreparation for meditation.1. Imagine yourself standing in the Temple, facing West. The Black Pillar ofSeverity will be on your right —the White Pillar of Mercy on your left. You willmake the Middle Pillar as you stand between them.2. Imagine now that the Black Pillar is reflected in your right side—the WhitePillar in your left.3. Take a deep breath and raise your consciousness to your kether above yourhead and vibrate the Name eheieh—which means i am. Imagine the Light flowingdown through daath (at the nape of your neck) toTIPHARETH.4. In the same manner, establish yesod in the name shaddai el chai, and malkuthin the Name ADONAIHA-ARETZ.5. Make the Qabalistic Cross to indicate that you have called down the Light ofyour kether and balanced it in your aura. Then let your imagination dwell on theaura and see it oval and clear, pulsating with the glow from TIPHARETH.If you are called to see anyone who is ill, who is depressed, or who has adepressing effect on you, you should do this exercise beforehand. In the case ofthe person who has a depressing effect on you, you may also imagine that youraura is hardened at the edge so that they are unable to penetrate it, and sodeplete you of vitality (which is generally what such sensations mean).In all these practices it is well to remember that 'Strength is in Silence/ Ifyou talk about them, save to<i8i>your Chief, or if you try to analyse their effects, you will not benefit bythem. Try them with simple faith and in silence for a year before rationalisingthem.It is better at first to keep your aura to yourself, rather than to try to flowout towards others. Unless you are particularly vital and well-balanced, youwill only waste energy. So-called modes of healing and of ‘doing good to others’should be eschewed for a time. Such methods have a technique of their own andrequired trained and balanced minds and bodies to carry them out. Get yourselfright first before you attempt to interfere with others in any way but theordinary ways of kindly decent society.When you have practised the exercise of the Middle Pillar for some time and canvisualise it easily, you can establish the other Sephiroth.6. Tatwas—Astrology—Divination. The Tatwas are designed to assist you in yourresearches into the Soul of Nature. They are at first done with a senior member,and later can be done alone or with a companion of your own Grade. They shouldnever be allowed to become uncontrolled day-dreams. The method taught should bestrictly adhered to—a definite time, preferably in the morning being setaside—and they should not be attempted when you are feeling tired or when yourmind is too occupied with other things to let you ‘get away.’ They should not bedone too frequently—once in three weeks or a month is enough, once a week iftime and circumstances permit. Notes of the pictures and symbols seen should bekept together in a book.Astrology. This should be done as time permits. The<i82>subject is vast and highly technical, and can be studied fully through thevarious schools and correspondence classes if you are interested in it. From theOrder Lecture, you should be able to set up a true birth horoscope for any placeand any time. You can practise setting up horoscopes for the cases gvien in AlanLeo’s little book “1001 Notable Nativities” and see whether you can tell forwhat the horoscope was remarkable. You should attempt the reading of a horoscopefor someone you know and then get the data for someone about whom you knownothing, and see whether you can give a reading which satisfies their friends.The Order requires only that you should be able to set up an accurate horoscopeand that you should know how to work out the aspects and how to make a simpleassessment of the good and bad factors in a horary figure. If Astrologyinterests you further, it is a very fascinating field of research.Divination. You may try to develop your intuition by the use of horary and natalastrology, geomancy, and the reading of the Tarot Cards by the method given inthe small book by Mr. A. E. Waite.You are advised to attempt only questions in which you are not emotionallyinvolved because methods of divination can be a fruitful source ofself-deception to those who are psychic but not self-knowing. If you are givento having intuitions you must learn to say not only T was right about that’ butalso ‘I was quite wrong about that,’ and if you advertise only successes (as isusual) at the bar of your own conscience, learn to assess them honestly.<i83>The interval of time between portal and ©—E should be given to the study of thewhole make-up of yourself. All these methods are designed to assist you to getas far as you can along the road to self-knowledge.You are to realise the different layers of your being— some of which you havebeen led through symbolically in the Outer Grades—“Which in one sense quittethnot malkuth”—the Kingdom of yourself.This line of thought, coupled with the study of the Rituals, may lead you torealise what it was you gathered together in the first point of the PortalRitual, and what it is you are trying to perfect to lay on the Altar of theSpirit.(Note: The reader or student who is interested particularly in this subject ofthe Sphere of Sensation, or aura as it is called, would be well-advised to studyvery carefully the Order Tarot teaching. There is much in that set of documentswhich concerns the application of the ideology of the Qabalistic Tree of Life toa sphere. In that case the Pillar arrangement becomes slightly altered orextended so as to produce 4 Pillars about an invisible axis, the Middle Pillar.There is also much profound wisdom in the very skeletal attributions of the fivedivisions of the Tarot Pack to the surface or parts of the solid sphere. TheAces to the North pole, and the 36 decanate Cards to the South pole up to theEcliptic, while in between range the Princess cards which are the Thrones of theAces, the other Court cards, and the Trumps. The studied application of thisintricate scheme to the extended arrangement of the Tree of Life, and thence to<i84>the human personality and sphere in all its branches will yield a wealth ofsignificant material.I have also elaborated this scheme in two books. In “The Art of True Healing” Ihave dealt with the Aura and the Middle Pillar solely from the therapeutic pointof view. My other book, “The Middle Pillar,” considers the technique from aconsiderably wider view. Moreover it attempts to associate the results oftraining with the terminology of Analytical Phychology. I. R.) ■*We are told in the Portal that the nine months’ wait which must intervene beforethe Portal is again opened for the Aspirant has a correspondence to the ninemonths of gestation before birth. As the unborn child, stage by stage, growsthrough the ancestral history of the race so the Candidate in the Portal by asingle circumambulation for each, recalls his past Grades and, at the end of thefirst point regards their symbols upon the Altar as parts of his body, andcontemplates them as coming together in one place—the unity of his person.In the second point, he sacrifices his name—symbol of his idea of himself inorder that the idea of a new self and a new consciousness may be attained.This has a correspondence in the birth of a child. It emerges from the membranesand placenta which hitherto have been its body and source of life and findsitself not ‘dead’ after the dread change, but translated to a largerconsciousness.Thus the Portal foreshadows the kind of change and development necessary forunderstanding the symbolism of the ©—GO.<i85>We do not know what consciousness the unborn child has—how far it has choice inits development—through what agency it unfolds the potencies of its tiny seedand draws to itself the necessary materials for growth. The miracle happens—andgives us courage to believe that a similar miracle is even now enacting wherebya body will be ready for us when this, which seems so real to us, shall sharethe same fate as the placenta and membranes which ‘die’at our birth.But tradition, as embodied in our Order and shown somewhat less directly in therevealed religions, teaches that this development can be assisted by consciouseffort —indeed, that there comes a time when this effort must be made throughthe body and mind we are now endowed with. And realising that we are indeed in aPath of Darkness groping for Light, we must feel our way to an understanding ofthe meaning of life—the reason for death.To those who feel the call to make this effort, comes the Order with a series ofpictures, symbolic of the growth of the soul to new life. The meditations givenwith each Grade are designed to lead the mind towards ideas which will assist inself-knowledge—universal impersonal ideas which each must find in his own way—‘the secrets which cannot be told save to those who know them already.’The Aspirant is led to look backwards. First he must acknowledge his debt toevolution through which has been perfected the instrument wherein his mind worksand gathers material. Then, through meditation, he is led to see himself as notonly self-conscious—as one who receives impressions—one who criticises andwatches—<i86>one whose will is interfered with—one who is misunderstood—one to whom othersare ‘persons’ or masks (from Latin persona, a mask)—but, standing outsidehimself, he now becomes one who endeavours to sense how his mask appears toothers—sees himself as part of the consciousness of others, as one whoimpresses, one who is criticised and watched, one who interferes with the willof others, one who misunderstands.He may recall periods in his life when his convictions were sure, his judgmentsharsh and unjust, his actions shameful, and view himself in that picturedispassionately as an entity operative in the give and take of life, somethinggrowing and as outside the category of blame as is the bitterness of unripefruit.As the knowledge of his place and relative importance in the Universe matures,he will attain strength to be honest with himself—ashamed of nothing he finds inhis mind—one watching the antics of his personality with tolerant amusement—yetalways learning.He will reflect on words, and the power of words. He will catch himself weavingthem—twisting their meaning-deceiving himself and others wdth them. He willcatch himself under obsession to them—he will see how they fix and make possiblethe recall of events and emotions, and with this knowdedge he will become awareof how his words affect other people.As he begins to realise the tremendous miracle of words, the magic both good andevil of human communion by words, he will begin to grasp why the Orderreiterates the importance of silence. The true Magician must understand histools and, in periods of silence, he must contemplate words as one of them.<i87>As he thus traverses the long road to dispassionate self-knowledge, and nolonger has to waste energy in doing battle for and indulging wounded feelings indefence of a totally false idea of himself, he is led to meditate on the variedsymbols of the cross, and from this to contemplate the Crucified One, revealedto the West as Jesus of Nazareth.This life and the sayings of Jesus given in the Meditation should be studied andpictured in the mind.The mind must be taught to die to useless churnings over past things and vainapprehensions about future things. This is difficult, for human phantasies diehard, but once the effort is made, however transient the result, it becomeseasier with time to replace wasteful thoughts with those that cluster round apowerful symbol of eternal truth.As the time for the ©=11] Ceremony approaches, the Aspirant should withdraw asfar as may be from externals that these symbols may work in his mind.He will find them waiting on the threshold of his mind ready to tell their storyas he walks about or is occupied in mechanical tasks. Once a place has been madefor them no ‘time1 is required to develop them. They grow in the waste places.Definite times, too should be set aside for Meditation wherein ideas may beformulated as far as possible.Before going to sleep, the Aspirant should do the<i88>Pentagram Ritual and impress on his mind that he must recall on waking anyteaching that has been given him in dream or vision. This may be assisted, if onwaking, he calls before his mind the Sun rising, thinly veiled in clouds.This should be done at least the week preceding the Grade.The Ceremony will be a true initiation for the Aspirant only in so far as he hasprepared himself to receive it.Like a word, it is a symbol, the communication of whose essence depends on theunderstanding and experience of the recipient.<i8g>MEDITATIONLet the Aspirant meditate upon the Cross in its various forms and aspects asshown in the Admission Badges throughout the Grades.Let him consider the necessity and prevalence of sacrifice throughout nature andreligion.Let him realise the saying of the Master 'Whosoever shall save his life shalllose it, and whosoever shall lose his life shall save it/‘Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone, but ifit die, it bringeth forth much fruit/Let him endeavour to realise his own place and relative importance in theUniverse, striving to stand outside himself and allowing only such claims as hewould allow to another.Let him carefully abstain from talking of himself, his feelings or experiencesthat he may gain continence of speech, and learn to control the wastefulactivities of his mind.Let him contemplate the Sun as thinly veiled in clouds.<ig°>Picture #27 [images/img_0027.png]The Mtnijtum MundumCONCERNING THE TREE OF LIFEThis is the Book of the Path of the Chameleon—the knowledge of the colours ofthe forces which lie beyond the physical universe. Study thou well that sayingof Henries ‘that which is below is like that which is above,’ for if that whichis below is conformed according to the Law of the Concealed One—Great is hisName—be thou well assured that the closer thou adherest unto the Law of theUniverse in thy working, by so much the more is thy Magical working just andtrue.Recall what was said unto thee in the Ritual of the Paths of the Portal of theVault of the Adepti. ‘Therefore, by the straight and narrow path of Samekh, letthe Philosophus advance like the arrow from the Bow of Qesheth.’ Now Qesheth theBow is the Rainbow of Promise stretched above the earth, whose name is formedfrom the letters of the Paths leading from Malkuth. If then it be by the Path ofSamekh that the Philosophus should advance to the knowledge of the Adept,turning aside neither unto the right hand nor unto the left, whereon are theevil and threatening symbols of Death and the Devil, he must have a perfect andabsolute knowledge of the Bow, ere he can follow the Path of the Arrow. But theBow is of brilliant and perfect colour, whose analysis and synthesis yieldothers of'the same scale, and hence is this book entitled “The Book of the Pathof the Chameleon”—that Path, namely which ascendeth alone through the force ofQesheth, the Bow.And if thy knowledge and application of the outer knowledge, which thou hastalready learned, be faulty<i9J>and incorrect how wilt thou be able to keep thyself from turning aside unto thyhurt? Therefore, learn not knowledge by rote only as an unreasoning child, butmeditate, search out and compare, and to the end, see that thou think but littleof thyself—for only he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. Magical knowledgeis not given unto thee to tickle thy vanity and conceit, but that by its means,thou mayest purify and equilibriate thy spiritual nature and honour the Vast andConcealed One.This is the explanation of the first diagram of the Paths—the Sephiroth being inthe feminine scale and the Paths in the masculine or King’s scale. It is the Keyof the Forces which lie in Qesheth the Bow. Treasure it in thy heart and mark itwell, seeing that therein is the key of nature. Meditate on it and reveal it notunto the profane, for many and great are its mysteries.NOTE: There are four scales of colour which correspond to the Four Worlds. They are:The King ScaleA tziluthWandsYodFireThe Queen ScaleUriahCupsHehWaterThe Prince ScaleYetzirahSwordsVanAirThe Princess Scale AssiahPentaclesHehEarthThe colours differ according to the World or aspect of the Great Name theyrepresent:Thus Samech in:The King Scale is Deep Blue The Queen Scale is Yellow The Prince Scale is GreenThe Princess Scale is Grey Blue<I92>Tiphareth in:The King Scale is Rose The Queen Scale is Gold The Prince Scale is Pink ThePrincess Scale is Tawny YellowThe tree of life for the use of an Adeptus Minor is compounded of the first twoscales. The sephiroth are in the feminine, passive, or Queen Scale. The pathsare in the masculine, active, or King Scale. It thus represents the forces ofatziluth in the paths uniting the sephiroth as reflected in the Briatic World,one of the possible arrangements of the powers inherent in yod he of theGREAT NAME.First are the Feminine colours of the Sephiroth, the Queen's Scale. In Kethcr isthe Divine White Brilliance, the scintillation and corruscation of the DivineGlory— that Light which lighteth the universe—that Light which surpasseth theglory of the Sun and beside which the light of mortals is but darkness, andconcerning which it it not fitting that we should speak more fully.

The Sephira Chesed is also called Gedulah or Magnificense andGlory, and the Sephira Geburah is also called Pachad Terror and Fear.In Kether is the Radix of a Golden Glory and thence is there a pure, primitiveand sparkling, gleaming golden yellow which is reflected unto Tiphareth. Thus isthe first reflected Triad completed. And the Sphere of its operation is that ofShemesh, the Solar Light, and bestoweth Life, Light and Brilliancy in metallicmatter, and it ruleth the sphere of action of the Sun. And Yhvh Eloha va-Daathis a God of Knowledge and Wisdom, ruling over the Light of the Universe; and itsArch<i95>angel is Raphael, the Prince of Brightness, Beauty and Life. And the Name of theOrder of Angels is Melechim or Malakim, that is Kings or Angelic Kings, who arealso called the Order of Virtues, Angels and Rulers. The, Angels Peniel andPelial are also referred unto this Seohira. It especially rules the Mineralworld.The beams of Cbesed and of Tiphareth meet in Netzack and thence in Netsacharises a green, pure, brilliant, liquid, and gleaming like an emerald. And theSphere of its operations is that of Nogak or External Splendour, producing zeal,love, harmony, and it ruleth the Sphere of Action of the Planet Venus and thenature of the Vegetable World. And Jehovah Tzahaoth is a God of Hosts and ofArmies, of Triumph and of Victory, ruling the Universe in Justice and Eternity.And its Archangel Hanial is the Prince of Love and Harmony, and the Name of theOrder of Angels is Elohim or Gods who are also called the Order ofPrincipalities.

And the Sphere of its Operation isthat of Kokab, the stellar light, bestowing elegance, swiftness, scientificknowledge and art, and constancy of speech, and it ruleth the sphere of theaction of the planet Mercury. And Elohim Tzabaoth is also a God of Hosts and ofArmies, of Mercy and of Agreement, of Praise and Honour, ruling the Universe inWisdom and Harmony. And its Archangel is Michael, the Prince of Splendour and ofWisdom, and the Name of Order of Angels is Beni Elohim, or Sons of the Gods, whoare also called the Order of Archangels.<rg6>The beams of Chesed and Geburah meet in Yesod and thence ariseth in Yesod abrilliant deep violet-purple or puce, and thus is the third Triad completed. Andthe sphere of its operation is that of Levanah, the Lunar beam, bestowingchange, increase and decrease upon created things and it ruleth the Sphere ofAction of the Moon and the nature of mankind. And Shaddai is a God who sheddethbenefits, Omnipotent and Satisfying, and Al Chai is the God of Life, the LivingOne. Its Archangel is Gabriel the Prince of Change and Alteration. And the nameof the Order of Angels is Kerubim or Kerubic ones who are also called the Orderof Angels.And from the rays of this Triad there appear three colours in Malkuth togetherwith a fourth which is their synthesis. Thus from the orange tawny of Hod andthe green nature of Netsach, there goeth forth a certain greenish ‘citrine’colour, yet pure and translucent withal. From the orange tawny of Ilod mingledwith the puce of Yesod there goeth forth a certain red russet brown, ‘russet’yet gleaming tvith a hidden fire. And from the green of Netsach and the puce ofYesod there goeth forth a certain other darkening green ‘Olive’ yet rich andglowing withal. And the synthesis of all these is a blackness which borderethupon the Qlippoth.Thus are the colours of the Sephiroth completed in their feminine or Rainbowscale.Moreover, though the 'Free of Life operates through all the Ten Sephiroth, yetit is referred in a special manner to Tiphareth. Also, through the branches ofthe Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil stretch into the seven lower Sephirothand downwards into the Kingdom of Shells,<i97>yet it is referred especially unto Malkuth. Similarly with Netsach and Hod, theright and left columns of the Sephiroth are referred respectively thereto.In Malkuth, Adonai ha-Aretz is God, the Lord and King, ruling over the Kingdomand Empire which is the Visible Universe.And Cholem Yesodoth the Breaker of Foundations, (or Olam Yesodoth—the World ofthe Elements) is the Name of the Sphere of Operation of Malkuth which is calledthe Sphere of the Elements from which all things are formed, and its Archangelsare three:—Metatron, the Prince of Countenance reflected from Kether, andSandalphon, the Prince of Prayer (feminine), and Nephesch ha Messiah, the Soulof the Reconciler for Earth.

White, red, yellow, blue(nearly black) violet outside black (outside)Daath Lavender Grey White Pure Violet Grey flecked goldTHE MICROCOSM—MANThou shalt know that the whole Sphere of Sensation which surroundeth the wholephysical body of a man is called “The Magical Mirror of the Universe.” Fortherein are represented all the occult forces of the Universe projected as on asphere, convex to the outer, but concave to man. This sphere surroundeth thephysical body of a man as the Celestial Heavens do the body of a Star or aPlanet, having their forces mirrored in its atmosphere. Therefore its allotmentor organization is the copy of that Greater World or Macrocosm. In this “MagicalMirror of the Universe,” therefore, are the Ten Sephiroth projected in the formof the Tree of Life as in a solid sphere. (See also the Astronomic view of theTarot in Part Eight.)A man’s physical body is within the Ten Sephiroth projected in a sphere. Thedivisions and parts of the body are formed from the Sephiroth of the Tree ofLife, thus.Kether is above the Crown of the Head, and represents a crown which indeed ispowerful, but requires one worthy to wear it. In the crown of the head is placedthe faculty of Neschamah, which is the power of Aspiration unto that which isbeyond. This power Neschamah is especially attributed unto the Supernal Triad inAssiah, of which there are three manifestations which are included in thegeneral concept, Neschamah.From Chokmah and Binah are formed the sides of the brain and head. Therein existthe intellectual faculties of Wisdom and Understanding, shining into and illu<203 >minating their inferior, the Ruach. They are the mansions of the practicaladministration of the intellect, whose physical shewing forth is by reflectionin Ruach. In the Magical Mirror of the Universe, or the Sphere of Sensation, Manis placed between four pillars of the Tree of Life as projected in a sphere.These keep their place and move not. But the Man himself places in his Sphere ofSensation that point of the Zodiac which ascended at the moment of his birth andconception (for the same degree of the Zodiac ascendeth at both, otherwise thebirth could not take place). That is to say that at those times the same degreeof the Zodiac is ascending in the East of the Heavens of the Star whereon he isincarnated. Thus doth he remain during that incarnation facing that particularpoint in his sphere of sensation. That is to say, this sphere doth not revolveabout the physical body.From Chesed and Geburah are formed the arms. Therein exist the faculties ofoperative action, wherefore at their extremities are the symbols of the f ourElements and the Spirit, thus:—Thumb— SpiritFirej ru i mgeiTti / Ipv ITi n rrp-TWltCF111UCA 1 lllgCIAir_L/1 LL1 ,C X1Second Fingerj. inEarthThe arms are the manifestors of the executive power of the Ruach, and thereinare the faculties of touch strongly expressed.<204>From Tiphareth is formed the trunk of the body, free from the members, andtherein as in a receptacle of influences are situated the vital organs.The blood is Spirit mingled with and governing the watery principle. The lungsare the receptacles of Air which tempereth the blood as the wind doth the wavesof the sea—the mephitic impurities of the blood in its traversal of the bodyrequiring the dispersing force of the Air, even as the sea, under a calm, dothputrify and become mephitic.The heart is the great centre of the action of Fire, lending its terrible energyas an impulse unto the others. Thence cometh from the fiery nature the redcolour of the blood.The part above the heart is the chief abode of the Ruach, as there receiving andconcentrating the other expressions of its Sephiroth. This part is the centralcitadel of the body and is the particular abode of the lower and more physicalwill. The higher will is in the Kether of the body. For the higher will tomanifest, it must be reflected into the lower will by Neschamah. This lower willis immediately potent in the lower members and thus, in the region about theheart, is the lower will seated like the King of the body upon its throne.The concentration of the other faculties of the Ruach in and under thepresidency of the Will, at the same time reflecting the administrativegovernance of Chokmah and Binah, is what is called the human consciousness. Thatis, a reflection of the two creative Sephiroth under the presidency of the FourElements, or the reflec<205>tion of Aima and Abba as the parents of the human Jehovah. But the humanNeschamah exists only when the higher Will is reflected by the agency ofaspiration from Kcther into the lower body, and when the flaming letter shin isplaced like a crown on the head of Microprosopus. Thus only doth the human willbecome the receptacle of the higher Will and the action of Neschamah is the linktherewith. The lower will is the human Jehovah—an angry and jealous God, theShaker of the Elements, the manifestor in the life of the body. But illuminatedby the higher Will, he becometh yeheshuah, no longer angry and jealous, but theself-sacrificer and the Atoning and Reconciling One.This as regards the action of the more physical man.Unto this Ruach also are presented the reflections of the Macrocosmic Universein the Sphere of Sensation. They surround the Ruach which, in the natural man,feeleth them but vaguely and comprehendeth them not. The faculties of the Earthare shown forth in the organs which digest and putrify, casting forth theimpurities, even as the Earth is placed above the Qlippoth.Thou wilt say, then, that the Ruach cannot be the reasoning mind, seeing that itreflecteth its reason from Chokmah and Binah — but it is the executive facultywhich reasoncth, which worketh with and combineth the faculties reflected intoit. The reasoning mind, therefore, is that which useth and combineth thePrincipia of Chokmah and Binah so that the parts of Chokmah and Binah whichtouch the Ruach are the initiators of the reasoning power. The reason itself isa process and but a simulacrum of the action of the higher Wisdom<2o6>and Understanding. For the Air is not the Light—only the translator of theLight. Yet without the Air, the operations of the Light could not so well becarried out. The word Ruach, Spirit, also meaneth Air. It is like a thing thatgoeth out thou knowest not whither, and cometh in thou knowest not whence.‘The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, butcanst not tell whence it cometh nor whither it goeth. So is every one that isborn of the Spirit/This Air, the Ruach, permeatcth the whole physical body but its concentratedinfluence is about the heart. Yet, were it not for the boundary force of Chokmahand Binah above, of the sphere of sensation surrounding it, and of Malkuthbelow, the Ruach could not concentrate under the presidency of the Name, and thelife of the body would cease.Thus far concerning the Ruach as a whole, that is, the action of the Will inTiphareth.From Netzach and Hod are formed the thighs and legs, and they terminate in thesymbols of five, as do the arms; but they are not so moveable, owing to theeffect of Malkuth. In them are placed the faculties of support and firmness andbalance; and they show the more physical qualities of the Ruach. In them is thesustaining force of the Ruach. They are the affirmation of the Pillars of theSephiroth, as answering to the Passive, the arms more answering to the twopillars which are Active. They are the columns of the Human Temple.<207>From Yesod are formed the generative and excretory organs, and therein is theseat of the lower desires, as bearing more on the double nature of, on the onehand, the rejection of the Qlippoth, and on the other hand the simulacrum of thevital forces in Tiphareth. It is the special seat of the automaticconsciousness. That is, not the Will, but the simulacrum of the Will inTiphareth. Yesod is the lowest of the Sephiroth of the Ruach, and representeth“Fundamental Action.” It therefore governth generation. In Yesod is thereforethe automatic consciousness or simulacrum of the Will. This automaticconsciousness is to the Nephesch what the Daath action is to the Ruach. Thus,therefore, there being a simulacrum or reflection of the heart and vital organsin the parts governed by Yesod, if the consciousness of the Tiphareth be givenunto this wholly, it shall pave the way for disease and death. For this will bea withdrawing of the vital forces of the Name, which are in the citadel ofTiphareth, to locate them in Yesod, which is a more easily attacked position.For the automatic consciousness is the translator of the Ruach unto theNephesch.From Malkuth is formed the whole physical body under the command and presidencyof the Nephesch. The Nephesch is the subtle body of refined astral Light uponwhich, as on an invisible pattern, the physical body is extended. The physicalbody is permeated throughout by the rays of the Ruach, of which it is thematerial completion. The Nephesch shineth through the Material body and formeththe Magical Mirror or Sphere of Sensation. This Magical Mirror or Sphere ofSensation is an imitation or copy of the Sphere of the Universe. The spacebetween the physical body and the<2o8>boundary of the sphere of Sensation is occupied by the ether of the astralworld; that is to say, the container or recipient of the Astral Rays of theMacrocosm.The Nephesch is divided into its seven Palaces, combining the Sephiroticinfluences in their most material forms. That is, the world of passionsdominated by the Ruach, or by the world which is beyond. That is, its Sephirothare passionate, expressing a passionate dominion, Thus, its three SupernalSephiroth, Kether, Chokmah and Binah, are united in a sense of feeling andcomprehending impressions. Its Chesed is expressed by laxity of action. ItsGeburah by violence of action. Its Tiphareth is expressed by more or lesssensual contemplation of beauty, and love of vital sensation. Its Hod andNetzach, by physical well-being and health. Its Yesod, by physical desires andgratifications. Its Malkuth, by absolute increase and domination of matter inthe material body.The Nephesch is the real, the actual body, of which the material body is onlythe result through the action of Ruach, which by the aid of the Nephesch,formeth the material body by the rays of Ruach, which do not ordinarily proceedbeyond the limits of the physical body. That is to say, in the ordinary man therays of Ruach rarely penetrate into the sphere of Sensation.Shining through infinite worlds, and darting its rays through the confines ofspace, in this Sphere of Sensation is a faculty placed even as a light is placedwithin a lantern. This is a certain sense placed in an aperture of the upperpart of the Ruach wherein act the rays from Chokmah and Binah which govern thereason—Daath.<2Q9>This faculty can be thrown downwards into the Ruach, and thence can radiate intothe Nephesch. It consists of seven manifestations answering to the Hexagram, andis like the Soul of Microprosopus or the Elohim of the human Tetragrammaton.Therefore in the head, which is its natural and chief seat, are formed the sevenapertures of the head. This is the Spiritual Consciousness as distinct from thehuman consciousness. It is manifested in 7 as just said or in 8 if Daath beincluded. The Father is the Sun (Chokmah.) The Mother is the Moon (Binah.) TheWind beareth it in his bosom, (Ruach.) Its Nurse is the Earth, (Nephesch.) Thepower is manifested when it can be vibrated through the Earth.The following is the true attribution of the seven apertures of the head:Right Ear———Saturn Left Ear —JupiterRight Eye Sol Left Eye LunaMouth——Mercury (who is the messenger of the Gods) Right Nostril Mars LeftNostril VenusThese latter represent here the sonoriferous sense, The right and left eye, theluminous sense, as the Sun and Moon are the luminaries of the Macrocosm. Theright and left nostrils through which the breath passes, giving strength to thephysical body, are under Mars and Venus. The mouth is under Mercury, themessenger and the Speaker.This spiritual consciousness is a focus of the action of Neschamah. The lowerwill-power should control the descent of this spiritual consciousness into theRuach,<2IO>and thence into the Nephesch, for the consciousness must descend into theNephesch before the images of the Sphere of Sensation can be perceived. For itis only the rays of this consciousness permeating the Ruach that can takecognisance thereof. This faculty of the spiritual consciousness is the seat ofThought. Thought is a Light proceeding from the radiation of this spiritualconsciousness, traversing the Ruach as Light traverseth Air, and encounteringthereafter the symbols reflected in the sphere of Sensation, or magical mirrorof the Universe. These symbols are by its radiation (i. e. that of the Thought)reflected again into the Spiritual Consciousness where they are subjected untothe action of the Reasoning Mind and of the Lower Will. That is, in the ordinarynatural man when awake, the thought acteth through the Ruach, subject when thereto the action of the Lower Will, and submitted to the reasoning power derived asaforesaid from Chokmah and Binah. But in the ordinary man when sleeping, and inthe madman, the idiot, and the drunkard, the process is not quite the same. Inthe sleeping man, the concentration of the Ruach in his heart during the wakingtime hath produced a weakening of the action of the Ruach in its subsidiarySephiroth in the Physical Body. To preserve the salutary conjunction of theRuach with the Nephesch in the physical body (whose limits are fixed by theSephiroth of the Ruach) it is necessary to weaken the concentration in Tipharethto repair the strain which is produced by the concentration of the Ruach thereinduring the waking state. This reflux of the Ruach into its subsidiary Sephirothproduceth naturally a weakening of the Lower Will; and the Ruach, therefore,doth<211 >not reflect so clearly the Reasoning Faculty. Wherefore, the thought of thespiritual consciousness reflecteth the image in a confused series, which areonly partially realised by the lower will. (This is as regards the ordinarynatural man in sleep.)In the madman, as considered apart from obsession (thought-obsession isfrequently the accompaniment of mania, and still more frequently its cause) thethought and lower will are very strongly exercised to the detriment of thereasoning faculty. That is, that there is an alliance between the two formerwhich overpowereth the action of Chokmah and Binah in the latter.Monomania is shewn in the consideration of only one certain symbol which is tooattractive to the Will. A chain of thought is therefore simply a graduatedvibration arising from the contact of a ray of thought with a symbol. Ifcontrolled by the reasoning power and licensed by the Will, such vibrations willbe balanced and of equal length. But if uncontrolled by the lower Will and theReason, they wall be unbalanced and inharmonious. (That is, of uneven length.)In the case of the drunkard, the equilibrium of the Sphere of Sensation andconsequently of the Nephesch, is disturbed. In consequence the thought rays areshaken at each vibration, so that the sphere of sensation of the Nephesch iscaused to rock and waver at the extremities of the Physical Body where the Ruachaction is bounded. The thought therefore is dazzled by the symbols of the Sphereof Sensation, in the same way as the eyes can be dazzled in front of a mirror ifthe latter be shaken or waved. The sensation therefore then conveyed by the<2I2>thoughts is that of the Sphere of Sensation oscillating and almost revolvingabout the physical body, bringing giddiness, sickness, vertigo and the loss ofidea of place and position. Nearly the same may be said of Seasickness, and theaction of certain drugs.Restoration of the equilibrium of the Sphere of Sensation after this naturallyproduced a slackening of the concentration of the Ruach in Tiphareth, whencesleep is an absolute necessity to the drunkard. This is so imperative that hecannot fight against the need. If he does so, or if this condition be constantlyrepeated, the thought rays are launched through the Sphere of Sensation soirregularly and so violently that they pass its boundary without either thelower Will or the Reasoning Power or even the Thought itself consenting thereto;and the latter is therefore without the protection of the will. Thence arise theconditions of delirium tremens, and an opening is made in the Sphere ofSensation which is unguarded, and through which hostile influences may enter.But this latter cometh under the head of obsession.All thought action in the spiritual consciousness originated in radiation, andradiation is as inseparable from the spiritual consciousness as it is fromLight.This Spiritual Consciousness is the focus of the action of Neschamah. Thespiritual consciousness is, in its turn, the Throne or Vehicle of the Life ofthe Spirit which is Chiah; and these combined form the Chariot of that HigherWill which is in Kether. Also it is the peculiar faculty o/ N eschamah to aspireunto that which is beyond. The Higher Will manifests itself through Yechidah.The Chiah is the real Life Principle, as distinct<2I3>from the more illusionary life of the Physical Body. The Shining Flame of theDivine Fire, the Kether of the Body, is the Real Self of the Incarnation. Yetbut few of the sons of men know it or feel its presence. Still less do theybelieve in or comprehend those Higher Potencies—Angelic, Archangelic or Divine,of which the manifestation directly touching Yeckidah is the Higher Genius,This Yeckidah in the ordinary man can but rarely act through the spiritualconsciousness, seeing that for it to do so the King of the Physical Body, thatis the Lower Will, must rise from his Throne to acknowledge his superior. Thatis the reason why, in some cases, in sleep only doth the Higher Will manifestitself by dream unto the ordinary man. In other cases it may be manifested; attimes through the sincere practice of religious rites, or in cases where theopportunity for self-sacrifice occurreth. In all these cases the Lower Will hathfor a moment recognised a higher form of itself, and the yhvh of the man hathreflected from the Eternal Lord of the Higher Life. This Yeckidah is the onlypart of the man which can truly say—eiieieh, I am. This is then but the Ketherof the Assiah of the Microcosm, that is, it is the highest part of man as Man.It is that which toucheth, or is the manifestation of a higher and greater rangeof Being. This Ycchidah is at the same time the Higher Human Self and the LowerGenius, the God of the Man, the Atziluth of his Assiah, even as Chiah andNeschamah form his Briah, and Ruach his Yetzirah. This is the Higher Will andthe Divine Consciousness, as Daath is the Spiritual Consciousness, Tipharcth theHuman Consciousness, and Yesod the Automatic Consciousness.<2I4>It is the Divine Consciousness because it is the only part of man which cantouch the All-potent forces. Behind Yechidah are Angelic and Archangelic Forcesof which Yechidah is the manifestor. It is therefore the Lower Genius or Viceroyof the Higher Genius which is beyond, an Angel Mighty and Terrible. This GreatAngel is the Higher Genius, beyond which are the Archangelic and Divine.Recall the Tiphareth clause of an Adeptus Minor: “I further solemnly promise andswear that with the divine permission I will from this day forward apply myselfunto the Great Work which is so to purify and exalt my spiritual nature, thatwith the Divine Aid I may at length attain to be more than Human, and thusgradually raise and unite myself to my Higher and Divine Genius, and that inthis event, I will not abuse the great power entrusted unto me.”Note that this clause answereth unto Tiphareth, seeing that it is the Lower Willthat must apply itself unto this work, because it is the King of the PhysicalMan. All the Shining Ones (whom we call Angels) are microcosms of the MacrocosmYetzirah, even as Man is the microcosm of the Macrocosm or Assiah. AllArchangelic forms are microcosms of the Macrocosm of Briah, and the Gods of theSephiroth are consequently the Microcosms of the Macrocosm of Atziluth.Therefore apply this perfecting of the Spiritual Nature as the preparation ofthe Pathway for the Shining Light, the Light Divine,The evil persona of a man is in the Sphere of the Qhppoth, and the devils arethe Microcosms of the Macro<2I5>cosm of the Qlippoth. This evil persona hath its parts and divisions, and of itthe part which toucheth the Malkuth of the Nephesch is its Kether. Trembletherefore at the evil forces which be in thy own evil persona. And as above theKether of a Man are his Angelic and other forms, so below the Malkuth of theEvil Persona are awful forms, dangerous even to express or think of.<2l6>OF THE TASK UNDERTAKEN BY THE ADEPTUS MINORThis, then, is the task to be undertaken by the Adeptus Minor. To expel from theSephiroth of the Nephesch the usurpation by the evil Sephiroth; to balance theaction of the Sephiroth of the Ruach in those of the Nephesch. To prevent theLower Will and Human Consciousness from falling into and usurping the place ofthe Automatic Consciousness. To render the King of the Body, the Lower Will,obedient to and anxious to execute the commands of the Higher Will, that he beneither a usurper of the faculties of the Higher, nor a sensual despot—but anInitiated Ruler, and an annointed King, the viceroy and representative of theHigher Will, because inspired thereby, in his Kingdom which is man. Then shallit happen that the Higher Will, i.e., the Lower Genius, shall descend into theRoyal Habitation, so that the Higher Will and the Lower Will shall be as one,and the Higher Genius shall descend into the Kether of the Man, bringing withhim the tremendous illumination of his Angelic Nature. And the Man shall becomewhat is said of Enoch. '‘And Chanokh made himself to walk with God, and he wasnot, for God took him.” (Genesis, V. v. 24.)Then also this shalt thou know, that the Nephesch of the Man shall become as theGenius of the Evil Persona, so that the evil persona itself shall be as thepower of the Divine in the Qlippoth, as it is said: “Whither shall I go from thySpirit, or whither from thy Presence shall I flee? If I ascend up to Heaven,thou art there. If I make my bed in Hell, behold thou art there.” (Ps. cxxxix.)<2I7>Therefore even the Evil Persona is not so evil when it fulfileth its work. Forit is the beginner of a dim reflection of the Light unto the Qlippoth, and thisis what is hidden in the saying that “Typhon is the brother of Osiris.” Hearthou, then, a mystery of the knowledge of evil. The ©—GD Ritual of the AdeptusMinor saith that even the “Evil helpeth forward the Good.” When the evilSephiroth are expelled from the Nephesch into the Evil Persona, they are, in asense, equilibriated therein. The evil persona can be rendered as a great andstrong, yet trained, animal whereupon the man rideth, and it then becometh astrength unto his physical base of action. This Mystery shalt thou keep from theknowledge of the First Order, and still more from that of the Outer World, thatis as a formula, seeing that it is a dangerous secret.Now then shalt thou begin to understand the saying “He descended into Hell,” andalso to comprehend in part this strength, and thus begin to understand thenecessity of evil unto the material creation. Wherefore, also, revile notovermuch the evil forces, for they have also a place and a duty, and in thisconsisteth their right to be. But check their usurpation, and cast them downunto their plane. Unto this end, curse them by the mighty names if need be, butthou shalt not revile them for their condition, for thus also shalt thou be ledinto error.There is also a great mystery that the Adeptus Minor must know, viz.:How the spiritual consciousness can act around and beyond the sphere ofSensation. “Thought” is a mighty force when projected with all the strength ofthe lower Will under the guidance of the reasoning faculty and il<2l8>luminated by the Higher Will. Therefore, it is that, in thy occult working, thouart advised to invoks the Divine and Angelic Names, so that thy Lower Will maywillingly receive the influx of the Higher Will, which is also the Lower Geniusbehind which are the all-potent forces. This, therefore, is the magical mannerof operation of the Initiate when “skrying” in the spirit vision. Through hisown arcane wisdom, he knows the disposition and correspondences of the Forces ofthe Macrocosmos. Selecting not many, but one symbol, and that balanced and withits correlatives, then sendeth he a thought-ray from his SpiritualConsciousness, illuminated by his Higher Will, directly unto the part of hisSphere of Sensation which is consonant with the symbol employed. There, as in amirror, doth he perceive its properties as reflected from the Macrocosmos,shining forth into the Infinite Abyss of the Heavens. Thence can he follow theray of reflection therefrom, and while concentrating his united consciousness atthat point of his sphere of sensation, can receive the direct reflection of theray from the Macrocosmos. Thus receiving the direct ray as then reflected intohis Thought, he can unite himself with the ray of his Thought so as to make onecontinuous ray from the corresponding point of the Macrocosmos unto the centreof his consciousness. If, instead of concentrating at that actual point of thesphere of Sensation he shall retain the thought-ray only touching the sphere ofsensation at that point, he shall, it is true, perceive the reflection of theMacrocosmic Ray answering to that symbol in the sphere of his Consciousness. Ruthe shall receive this reflection tinctured much by his own nature, and thereforeto an extent untrue, because his<2*9>united consciousnesses have not been able to focus along the thought-ray at thecircumference of the Sphere of sensation. And this is the reason why there areso many and multifarious errors in untrained spirit visions. For the untrainedseer, even supposing him free from the delusions of obsession, doth not know orunderstand how to unite his consciousnesses and the harmonies between his ownsphere of sensation, and the universe, the macrocosmos. Therfore is it sonecessary that the Adeptus Minor should correctly understand the principia andaxiomata of our secret knowledge, which are contained in our Rituals andLectures.OF TRAVELING IN THE SPIRIT VISIONThe symbol, place, direction, or Plane being known whereon it is desired to act,a thought-ray as before is sent unto the corresponding part of the Sphere ofSensation of the Nephesch. The Thought-Ray is sent like an arrow from the bow,right through the circumference of the Sphere of Sensation direct unto the placedesired. Arrived there, a sphere of astral Light is formed by the agency of theLower Will, illuminated by the Higher Will, and acting through the spiritualconsciousness by reflection along the Thought-Ray. This sphere of Astral Lightis partly drawn from the surrounding atmosphere. This sphere being formed, asimulacrum of the person of the Syryer is reflected into it along thethought-ray, and this united consciousness is then projected therein. ThisSphere is then a duplicate, by reflection, of the Sphere of Sensation. As it issaid: “Believe thyself to be in a place and thou art there.” In this AstralProjection, however, a certain part of the consciousness must remain in the<220>body to protect the Thought-Ray beyond the Sphere of Sensation (as well as theSphere itself at that point of departure of the Thought-Ray) from attack by anyhostile force, so that the consciousness in this projection is not quite sostrong as the consciousness when concentrated in the natural body in ordinarylife. The return taketh place with a reversal of this process, and save topersons whose Nephesch and physical body are exceptionally strong and healthy,the whole operation of skrying and traveling in the Spirit Vision is of coursefatiguing.Also there is another mode of astral projection which can be used by the morepractised and advanced Adept. This consisteth in forming first a sphere from hisown Sphere of Sensation, casting his reflection therein, and then projectingthis whole sphere to the desired place, as in the previous method. But this isnot easy to be done by any but the practised operator.Thus far, regarding Skrying and Travelling in the Spirit Vision.(These instructions are considerably amplified with practical examples in alater volume dealing with Astral vision and clairvoyance. I. R.)<221 >CONCERNING THE MICROCOSMS OF MACROCOSMAs thou well knowest there be many and numberless other inhabitants of theMacrocosmos besides Man, Angels, and Devils. The animals are microcosms in asense, yet not so complete as man. In them are many and great mysteries. Theyalso have their magical mirror or sphere of sensation. But its polarisation isusually horizontal rather than perpendicular, and this isowing to the Sephirothnot being shewn therein. This Sphere, then, is not bounded by the Sephirothiccolumns, but they are especially governed by the Stellar System without theSephiroth. They are therefore ruled by the Paths, rather than by the Sephiroth,and are consequently classed each under an Element or a Planet, and a Sign. Thuseach followeth a formula which may be translated into letters, and these againform a vibratory name. As it is written: “And Adam gave names unto all thecattle and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field.” (Gen. II,v. 20.) Yet they arc ruled by the name yhvh, though classed rather by one ormore of its letters:Thus, Fish, etc., are under the influence of Water Birds are under the influenceof Air Quadrupeds are under the influence of FireCreeping things and insects are under the influence of EarthThere are some which partake of two elements, but in them one element is usuallychief, and besides the Elements, each is under a Planet and a Sign.<222>The vegetable kingdom is again under a somewhat different Law. These are under aPlanet and a Sign, a planet first differentiated by a Sign.The Mineral Kingdom is under the Signs only. Vegetables have a Sphere ofSensation, but corresponding only to the Planets and Zodiacal Signs. TheMinerals have also a Sphere which correspondeth unto the Signs only. But themetals are under the Planets only, and therein is the difference between themand the Minerals, wherefore also are they stronger. Shining Stones areespecially under the Light; and they are, as it were, centres for the actionthereof in the darkness of matter, as it is said: “My light is concealed in allthat shineth.” (This passage is it is believed from the Zend-Avesta.) They aretherefore under the rule of the three active elements with an earthy base.Shining through all things as a whole, are the rays of the Macrocosmos. Besidesthese classes of life there be multitudinous existences representing Forces ofthe Macrocosm, each with its own microcosm. Such are Elemental Spirits,Planetary Spirits, Olympic Spirits, Fays, Arch-Fays, Genii, and many otherpotencies which cannot be classed under these forms.Thus the Macrocosmic Universe is one vast and infinite sphere containing so manyand diverse infinite microcosmic forms, of which the perfect knowledge is onlyknown unto the advanced Adept.Also it shall here suffice to say that thou shalt make a distinction between theFour-handed race (the quad<223>rumana, Apes and monkeys) ) which be midway between Man and Beast and otheranimals. For they be neither the one or the other, but are the fallen anddebased result of a most ancient magical effect to formulate a material andimmediate link between the human and animal microcosms. This is elsewheretreated of, and it shall here be sufficient to say that they are not an ascent,from the beast unto the Man, but a mistaken magical fall from a man unto abeast. Anciently they were a terrible power upon this planet, as then havingmore of the man than of the animal, whereas now they have more of the animalthan of Man. The ancient traditions of their primal conditions are preservedunto this day in the legends of ogres and, in certain records, cannibalism andits rites.Regarding the beasts, they are, for the most part, easily obsessed, and theyhave not the spiritual responsibility of the man. Their nature is not evil, but,following a natural law—seeing that man is head of the Assiatic creation—so theanimal is higher than the vegetables or mineral. Also bear thou well in mindthat the race of the transformers are given unto cruelty. Such are above all therace of creeping things. As Man hath his Ruach which is upright in the.Tree ofLife, so hath the beast his Ruach which is horzontal; as it is said: “The Ruachof a man which goeth upwards (i.e. directeth itself upwards), and the Ruach ofthe beast which goeth downwards (or crosswise) in the Earth.” The Neschamah inthe Beast is not. The beast consisteth of a Ruach and a Nephesch with arudimentary Daath or Spiritual Consciousness. This Daath ever seeketh that whichis beyond it and thence are beasts not responsible, but are submitted untoobsession, and herein is a great mystery. Man, therefore, is placed<224>at the head of the beasts. Woe, woe, unto him if he teacheth their elementaryDaath cruelty and injustice instead of mercy and justice. For the Man is a Godunto the Beast, and the aspiration of the Beast is toward the Man, and great isthe office of the Beast, for he prepareth the foundation for the man. Man isresponsible for creation, and since he was originally placed in creation to beits Lord, as he is, so will the creation follow him. And thus it is possible forthe Genius of a Nation to change the climate of a country, and the nature of thebeasts therein. Men fell from primal estate, and then they who were formlessbecame imaged in form, deformed. And this is a mystery of the Demonic Planewhich entereth not into this section.The Elemental Spirits and other of their kind are an organisation not quite socomplete as man. In spiritual consciousness more keen, and yet in some ways hisspiritual superior though organically bis inferior. They are the formers of theprimal Man, that is the Elementary Man, and they have other and greater offices,for in them are many worlds and ranks and spheres. They are as the younger man(i.e. child) and towards them also is Man responsible, and he hath wrought themmuch injustice.<225>OF OBSESSION, TRANCE, DEATHObsession always entereth through a cutting off of the Higher from the LowerWill, and it is ordinarily first induced by a Thought-Ray of the Spiritualconsciousness (whence one danger of evil thoughts) ill-governed, penetrating theSphere of Sensation and admitting another potency, either human embodied, orhuman disembodied, elemental or demonic. The first action of such a force is toflatter the lower will, until he shall have established firmly an entrance intothe Sphere of Sensation, and thus shall cause a strain on the Nephesch whichshall render the Ruach less concentrated. As soon as the Ruach is sufficientlydispersed to repair the strain on the physical body, the lower will is weakened,and is soon seized upon and bound by the invader. Whence arise the sensations ofchill and drowsiness which are the usual forerunners of obsession. Now to yieldthe force necessary to overpower the lower will from any chance of communicationwith the higher the obsessing idea proceeds by seizing upon the Daath, and thisconsequently is the great point of attack, especially the part in the physicalbody which is at the back of the head about the junction with the Spine. Nowunless the lower Will shall voluntarily endeavour to restore the connection, itis impossible for the Higher Will to intervene, seeing that the Lower Will isKing of the Physical Body. Remember that no obsessing force can overpower thelower will, if that shall bravely and in spite of all opposition aspire unto theHigher Will.Trance may arise from the action of obsession, or from<226>the action of the Higher Will, therefore its aspects are varied.Death superveneth in the natural man, when the mental action of the Ruach andthe Nephesch is definitely and thoroughly interrupted in the physical body. Inthe Adept death can only supervene when the Higher Will consenteth thereto, andherein is implied the whole Mystery of the Elixir of Life.End of Volume One"}]
