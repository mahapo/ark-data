Viking MAGICK CHANTS Patricia Nelson Copyright 1988 FINBARR INTERNATIONAL THE VIKING AND THEIR GODS During the eight,ninth and tenth centuries of our era,the very name of the 'VIKINGS' struck terror in the hearts of the people of Europe.For it was then that these formerly peaceable northern"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"tribes came like a ball of fire to kill,maim and destroy everything they could int he then known western world. In their magnificent longships that measured 24 metres in length and held 80 men-ships which could withstand any storm - the Vikings of norway sailed westward to scotland,ireland and iceland,destroying everything they found in these countries.They even reached the greenland and the coast of north america. The Vikings of denmark were no less adventurous in their travels;their longships were perfect for manoeuvering the rivers of Europe,and they sailed down to and into England,the low Countries,France,Italy and Spain,reaching as far as the northern coastline of Africa. The swedish tribes went South-East through to russia and even reached the fabulous city of byzantium in Turkey,which they would have taken,but for the ferocity of a storm which came to the beleaguered city's rescue. The Viking raids were wholly destructive and despicable;they would simply kill and maim the inhabitants of towns and take everything of value therein and then return to their homeland,feasting on their conquests. They would repeat the same exercises over and over again,year after year.Eventually,they mellowed and instead of merely pillaging the lands they invaded,they began colonising them and they began farming,learned various crafts and took to town-life. Many of the peoples of America,Canada and Australia,not to mention europe,are descended from this fierce race of warriors.The gods and Goddesses of the Vkings were the spiritual sources of this ancient race;and from a psychological point of view,these deities represent the deepest forces within the collective"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"consciousness of the Viking descendents.They signify great occult powers. However,the occult power of viking beliefs is not confined to those of european racial origin.In this book,are simple chants to various Viking deities for the granting of good fortune,power,influence and so on. The chants possess no value at all,regardless of your racial origins,if you do not believe in their power to help you.Admittedly,there is no logical reason why chanting to an unseen deity of an ancient race should bring you good luck or help you pay the rent,but this is Magick,and Magick does not belong to the same world logic.All that matters is that these chants get results.Do not wonder how it happens--just believe that it will. Prior tot he ritual,suspend all doubts and allow your mind to enter the world of the miraculous,where anything can happen--the world of Magick. The Vikings were a fierce,hardy people,who lived in a cold and harsh climate.Consequently,they believed in a tough cosmos,populated by terrifying and awesome deities.Odin was the father of all the Gods and a powerful,primal force both within the mind of man and the cosmos-before there was the god/jehova of the christians,there was Odin. Odin was lord of the sky and was also the spirit of Wisdom,Poetry,Agriculture and War.He had only one eye-he sacrificed his other eye as the price for acquiring all-pervasive wisdom. His one eye is the Sun,which sustains all life on our planet.He is pictured as an awesome long bearded old man with two wolves seated at his throne and two ravens perched on his shoulders."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Odin was called 'Woden' by the Anglo-Saxons,and mythologists have identified him with mighty Zeus of the ancient Greeks. Frigga was the supreme Godddess in scandanavian mythology and was Odin's wife.She was Patroness of marriage and was pictured as a stately,mature Queen,surrounded by all her trappings of wealth and pomp.She has been likened to the Greek Hera,wife of Zeus. Freya- compared by mythologists to the roman Venus - was Goddess of Love,Peace,Youth and Beauty.Because of her great beneficience there are three chants to her in this book,compared to the usual one chant each for the other Gods. Idun was a Goddess associated with youthfulness;she was the keeper of the apples which kept the youthful gods forever that way. Sif was a Goddess who poessessed luxuriant golden hair,which trailed her footsteps.Her hair represented the golden grain which covered the northern fields,and as a consequence,she came to be looked upon as a Goddess of Fertility and Growth. Balder,son of Odin and Frigga,was supreme God of Light,the solar God,who dispersed all darkness.He has been identified witht he Greek Sun-God Apollo. Tyn was a ferocious War God,likened tot he Roman Mars,and was invoked as both an inducer of fearlessness and as a protector in times of danger."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Thor was also a fearsome deity,and ranked only second in importance to Odin amongst the Viking Gods.With his destructive hammer,it is fitting that in this book,he is invoked as a Worker of Revenge. Fenrir was a Wolf-God and was associated with the idea of savage strength.Also fearsome was Mimir,a huge water demon who controlled the source of secret knowledge and wisdom - it was to him that even the all-powful Odin was forced to yield,when he demanded an eye as the price of wisdom.

If,for private reasons,you cannot leave the candles to burn to the end,you may extiguish them after the ritual. If,for private reasons,you cannot burn candles at all,you can still perform the ritual(s); just put a great deal of feeling into them. Good Luck! "}]
