Powerful social and political forces were moving in the substratum of European culture. In 1614 the mysterious Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross proclaimed a universal reformation. Alchemy was emerging as a science of human regeneration and the astrologers were turning their attention toward those heavenly portents which signified rapid and enduring changes in mundane affairs. The Utopians were hard at work structuring a political commonwealth somewhat puritanical but closer to the hearts' desire of the public in general. The two class system of princes and paupers was becoming unbearable and the constant feuding between Church and State broke out in civil war which further disillusioned thoughtful persons. Lord Bacon was certainly a moving spirit in the fields of politics, science, and industry. He revolted against the institutions of higher edu- cation, insisting that scholars had picked the bones of Aristotle until nothing of value re- mained. King James I was the patron of the new revision of the Holy Bible in 1611 and there is at least an enduring rumor that Lord Bacon was involved in this important labor. King James I, although not a paragon of the virtues, was v"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"NEW ATLANTIS sympathetic with Bacon's dream of the advancement and proficience of learning and even read some of his Lordship's publications which he acknowledged to be \"beyond human understanding.\" The revolt against Cromwell brought the Royalist party back into power and Charles II was enthroned as King in May 1660. His reign started badly but improved with the passing of time and in the last five years of his life he gained immense popularity. In spite of his numerous shortcomings Charles II was a patron of learning and, among his first official acts, was the crea- tion of the Royal Society of London. This body was largely dedicated to the new learning as proclaimed by Lord Bacon. During the reign of Charles II there was a strong revival of interest in alchemy, Rosicrucianism, and broad programs bearing upon social and economic growth. The seeds planted some fifty years earlier sprouted and bore fruit, and the average Bri tisher found living a more constructive experience. In 1660 Thomas Sprat published his History of the Royal Society of London wi th a laudatory dedication to the king and numerous references to the debt which the Society owed to Lord Bacon. The Utopian dream of a philosophic commonwealth seemed near fulfillment and the king was inclined to favor the project. vi"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"NEW ATLANTIS Bacon's Utopia was published in 1627 under the title The New Atlantis and was appended to a larger work, the Sylva Sylvarum or The Natural History of Winds. Bacon I s secretary, Dr. Raw ley, described The New Atlantis as a work unfinished ---- because his Lordship's attentions were called to more serious matters. The Utopian idea seems to have gained ground as the result of the explora- tions of those navigators who brought home the first accounts of the civilizations of the West- ern Hemisphere. It was evident that the Aztec, Maya, and Inca forms of government had strong democratic elements. They were highly socialized states, comparatively free from the tragedies which had burdened Europe for ages. When Pizarro asked the Inca how criminals were punished in Peru he replied that he could not answer the question because there were no criminals. Bacon's New Atlantis describes the adventures of seamen who departed from Peru and he may well have been influenced by the glowing accounts of the great cities of Central and South America. R. W. Gibson in his book entitled FRANCIS BACON, A Bibliography of His Works of Baconiana to the Year 1750, Oxford: Scrivener Press, 1950, under entry No. 417 gives a full collation of this work as follows: \"New A tl an tis I Begun by the I WRD VERULAM, 1 Viscount St. Albans:! and!

Archbp. Tenison described the above work as 'a great & hardy venture to finish a piece after Lord Verulam's pencil.' \"The identi ty of 'R. H. Esquire' is not known, though Hazli tt states that the book was written 'perhaps by Richard Haines'.\" Directly following the title is an extrava- gant encomium to King Charles II; it would prob- ably have highly amused the King if he ever read its glowing lines. It would not follow that this dedicatory preface reveals so much the opinions of the author as his anxieties. R. H. Esquire must have realized that Bacon's concept of a commonweal th was not entirely compatible with the policies of the English State. He hoped, no doubt, that his tribute to the monarchy would protect him from any royal displeasure that might be dangerous to himself. The dedication extends to six pages and the anonymous author proclaims himself as \"Your Majesty's most faithful and most humbly devoted servant in the strictest ties of duty and allegiance.\" This is followed by a poem in Latin honoring Lord Bacon extending somewhat over one page sign- ed by G. Herbert. ix"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"NEW ATLANTIS A rather extensive preface follows; the general tone of which combines apology and self- justification. There is emphasis upon the moral responsibilities of government and the enlarge- ment of knowledge throughout the kingdom. The author makes much of good laws and gives a number of classical examples with occasional pertinent quotations. Beginning on page one is a summary of Lord Bacon's New Atlantis. It tells that a ship sailing from Peru for China by the South Sea becomes windbound until its crew faced starva- tion. By the light of God's mercy, however, they reached a beautiful island peopled by noble Christians. After some delays the physical needs of the crew were cared for and they were told that the place was named the Island of Bensalem. Here was insti tuted the order or society called \"Solomon's House ,\" which Bacon describes as the noblest foundation that was ever upon the earth. It was dedicated to the study of the works and teachings of God and sometimes entitled the Col- lege of the Six Days Work. Bacon in his original text set forth many details about the wonderful research facilities and the museum of arts and skills which had been assembled in the College of the Six Days Work. In the midst of this description Lord Bacon's fable ends and R. H. Esquire attempts to continue the narration. It is interesting that Plato's de- scription of old Atlantis was also left unfin- ished. x"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"NEW ATLANTIS It is difficult to avoid the implication that the College of the Six Days Work is a veiled account of an actual secret society-- an island of learned men in a sea of ignorance. As we continue to explore the text it also becomes apparent that the Royal Society of London was dedicated to the same purposes as Solomon's House on the Island of Bensalem where dwelt the \"sons of peace.\" In 1662, John Heydon, generally listed among seventeenth century writers on Rosicrucianism, published an extensive and curious work called The Holy Guide. He prefaces this book with an almost verbatim reprint of Bacon's New Atlantis, but does not credi t the original author. Heydon inserts direct references to the Rosicrucians at appropriate points in the original text, wishing to convey the impression that the masters of Solomon's House were Rosicrucian adepts. In the same volume Heydon describes the Rosicrucians as a divine society inhabiting the suburbs of heaven and officers of the Generalissimo of the World. As it is inconceivable that the identity of the true author would not be known to most of his readers, it can only be assumed that Heydon's purpose was to tie Bacon's fable directly with the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross. He must also have known of the supplement by R. H. Esquire, but he makes no reference to it.

R. H. Esquire in what he calls his \"novel\" describes a new kind of peerage by which the people of Bensalem, if truly qualified, were elevated and duly honored. They were given econo- mic advantage for their contributions to the common good but wore certain insignia considered more valuable than any temporal distinctions. Sir Edwin Durning-Lawrence, in his most intriguing book, Bacon ~ Shake-speare, devotes some attention to R,. H. Esquire and what he calls \"a solid kind of heraldry.\" Durning-Lawrence feels that the heraldic devices referred to are found on the title pages and frontispieces of books which may be characterized broadly as Baco- nian works. Examples of them can be found extend- ing from the Elizabethan period almost up to the present date. Durning-Lawrence then reproduces the title page of Bacon's History of Henry VII, printed in Holland in 1642, which shows a female figure holding in her right hand the great Salt, which in R. H. Esquire's list stands for wisdom. R. H. Esquire adds that similar heraldic symbols of pre-eminence are assigned to the de- grees for the clergy but he does not detail them.

No one is ad- vanced by money or favor but by eminent deserts. It is understandable that King Charles would not gi ve wholehearted approval to such a concept of peerage and the author hoped to soften the blow by his elaborate dedication. Remembering that the Royal Society was ori- ginally named Minerva's Mu suem , there is a de- scription of a ritual in which Minerva is intro- duced. The pages describing this ceremony are badly mispaginated which in writing of this type indicates the need of special attention by the reader. The hero of this occasion is named Verdu- go and he is described as dressed in grass green satin with a cloak of the same color. He is met at the entrance to the sanctuary by a fair youth impersonating Minerva, the Goddess of Invention, and was embraced by the \"Father.\" An orator pro- claimed the merits of Verdugo's invention where- upon the \"Father\" of Solomon's House removed Verdugo's cloak and invested him with the long robe of Minerva and the one personifying the goddess placed on his head a garland overstudded with precious stones. Minerva then presented him with a baton and later he was led into a large room, the \"Father\" accompanying him on the left hand and Minerva on the right. After the ceremony Verdugo's name and surname, his place of birth, and his invention were duly registered to be preserved for all posterity in Solomon's House. xiii"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"NEW ATLANTIS In addi tion to all such wonders there were special areas set aside for advancement of agri- culture and a beautiful arboretum devoted to all manner of rare and useful plants. There was also a section for the advancement of music, another for art and a third for scientific pursuits where rare, ancient telescopes and microscopes were available. The Hall of Fame incl uded many cele- bra ted names and others less known who lived in remote times. Prominent among the displays was a magnificent obelisk on the surfaces of which were carved the effigies of all the kings of the Island of Bensalem. In the Court of Virtue were brazen statues of the twelve apostles and monu- ments symbolizing their martyrdoms. In the Court of Orpheus was a spacious fountain wherein was a likeness of Orpheus playing upon his harp, and the waters artificially resounded his harmonies to approaching nymphs. While some may doubt the source of this continuation of Bacon's New Atlantis there is much to indicate that it is a most significant work. It certainly amplifies and continues much of the spirit of Bacon t s dream for the expansion of human knowledge. This may have inspired Ash- mole's elaborate collections of rare objects and encouraged John Evelyn in his planning of gardens and landscapes. The idea of a worldwide collec- tion of significant books and art such as is now assembled in the British Museum may have origi- na ted in Bacon's vision of Solomon's House.

Although there are traces of early Pro- testant prejudices, the general tone of the work is highly constructive. R. H. Esquire states defini tely that Solo- mon's House was the gathering place of great wits and Bacon wrote on one occasion that he rang the bell that brought the wits together. His The Instauratio Magna was an effort to record all knowledge useful to mankind and dedicated the wisdom of the past to the service of the future. Bacon believed that the tripodium of learning rested firmly upon the threefold foundation of tradition, observation, and experimentation. These were certainly the labors to which the mysterious sages of Bensalem were dedicated. Bacon was himself a faithful child of the Church of England. All his writings bear witness to the piety of his erudition. He recognized Deity as the Father of all works and that the wiser a man became the more dependent he was upon the wonders of faith. Bacon was not unaware of the shortcom- ings of his Church but believed that a combina- tion of integrity and intelligence could restore the glory of kingdoms and bring grace of spiri t to all useful labors making them fruitful for eternal good.

The one dictates, the other commands; the first declares what should be done, the latter sees it executed. Impossible it is that man should live without submitting to some government. For had everyone been left his own lawmak- er, to have been protected by his own single strength, as well as will, no man's person or propriety had been safe, and millions of mis- chiefs in that anarchy had succeeded.

Athens and Sparta, after their several civil combustions, began then only to flourish and increase, when the first had taken laws from Solon, the latter from Lycurgus. Then did the A ttic laws flourish when Solon had restored to that commonwealth that peace and liberty which lasted above 500 years after. Then did the Athen- ians in this Halcyon age (as Herodotus attests) bring some of their laws out of Egypt to complete their own institutes. The like did the Romans after them, when necessi ty forced them to r egu- late their city. For they sent their Decem-viri* into Greece, who out of the Attic laws and others made by Zaleucus amongst the Locrians, by Lycur- gus amongst the Lacedaemonians, by Charondas amongst the Thurians, by Phoroneus amongst the Argives, and other chief Grecians whom they con- sul ted, extracted certain platforms of law and * Board of ten commissioners (at Rome). 10"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"NEW ATLANTIS government, from whence those laws of the Twelve Tables Cicero so commends, were at last extracted and bui It up.

To the Saxon and Danish (by whom England was first conquered) the last conqueror added some of his Norman laws: out of all which, that which we still call the common law was compiled as being the common extract of them all. This Norman, I say, governed this sullen nation like himself a conqueror, with a rod of iron; retaining some of the old, but imposing more new laws. And though the people struggled under the weight of his new and heavy impositions, and petitioned him that the laws of Edward the Confessor might be re- stored, whereby they might be freed from extraor- dinary taxes, yet neither he nor his son Rufus that succeeded granted them that immunity.

In particular cases and circumstances occurring after they were made (for all things are not seen, at first glance) they may be, and are sometimes very deficient. So that to correct the rigor of a positive law (which cannot always carry the same bias in every green, and from every hand) here the equity or hopoinia of it, which considers of the time, place, person, and other com para ti ve circumstances more fully, may be useful: so as the Lesbian rule of equity be not made to bow and incline to the rough stone; for then as that prince of philosophers compares it well, it proves but a very leaden rule.

For by turning the needle in one alpha- bet, the other in the distant table will by a secret sympathy turn itself after the like man- ner. This secret was first experimented here by one Lamoran, who being suspected of apostacy because of his great intimacy with one Alchmerin, his friend and a Jew, and his little adhesion to some of his opinions, was sent into the island of Conversion close prisoner; who there to hold constant intelligence wi th his intimate, first found out this admirable invention.\" And there- with he showed me those two very tables by which, during that his confinement, thus they commmi- cated their thoughts each to other.

Then he brought forth the great burning- glass which Proclus made, wherein the sunbeams contracted might like lightning fire ships at a very great distance. The same, he told me, Archi- medes imitated when the Romans beseiged Syracuse. Here is also, said he, that ductile glass, which Faber the inventor thereof first presented to Ti berius Caesar, which is so pliable that it is not easily to be broken, yielding to the stroke of the hammer like silver or iron, and which though we daily make of the same, we preserve as a sacred relic in memory of the inventor whom he put to death. Then he produced out of a large vial some of that powder [which] is called sympa- thetical, and is now grown common in Europe also. \"This is,\" said he, \"••• the most salubrious bal- sam in the world, and cures all wounds that are not mortal, in a very short time, at distance. It is made only of the purest vitriol calcined white in the sun, to which we add the gum of traga- canth; this strewed on the bloody cloth or wea- pon, the spirits of the vitriol incorporating with the blood, the wound by attraction of light and of the sun heals; the atoms and spirits of the blood by diffusion participating either heat or cold.

Then he showed me ordinary ice, petrified and so hardened by art (he said) that it was as useful as ordinary glass or crystal, though not so transparent, and which no small fire should thaw. With several other the like rarities he entertained me till such time as the feast was ended, and Verdugo's invention was enrolled. And then, with thanks given to him for this great favor, Joabin led me back to the rest of our fellows who kept their stations in the great hall, whither we saw Verdugo led and attended back in the same order he went thence, and seated in a chair of crimson velvet at the foot of a little throne covered with the same and richly embroidered with gold, having a rich canopy of state over it of the same in the midst of the stage whereon sat the Father of Solomon's House that had adopted him.

Verdugo returned his thanks also with a grateful acknowl- edgement after mutual embraces and solemn leave- taking, and then all the company as silent as the night (which was then almost approached) dissolv- ed, each one betaking himself to his several home, and we to ours upon our mules, which there at the gate stood ready for us. The next morning I went betime to the seminary of law students which was a fair and spacious building consisting of three large courts, in the middlemost whereof the Alcaldorems inhabit, the other two being filled with the Procuratorans, Advocatorems, and other officers of smaller note belonging to that society. In the midsts of this middle court on the right hand of it (as I was directed) I as- cended about six steps, and then entered the lodgings of that good and learned Alcaldorem (who before had invi ted me thither) those being very spatious, neat and gravely furnished.

For they are very intent and upright (as the Jew had informed me) never listening to any cause before it be brought before then in open court, to be decided immediately upon hearing. After he had led me through a long gallery furnished round wi th the most eminent alcaldorem's pictures of that is- land, he brought me into a very fair library consisting altogether of law books , civil, canon, and municipal of all nations, at the upper end of which in golden characters on black marble was God's Law inscribed, which he delivered to Moses in the Ten Commandments.

Having unclasped it and opened its leaves full of red characters, he offered it me to kiss first, which I did, and then to peruse. But though the hands were all seemingly very legible, yet being writ- ten by their several kings in their native lan- guage, which I so little understood, I humbly requested him that as he had already been pleased to dilate upon them so that he would also do me the favor farther to interpret. Herein he showed a great willingness to inform me farther, but to prevent me of that happiness an Alguazillan sum- moned him away to do speedy justice.

This was, as he told me, the largest, most beautiful and populous city, next to the imperial one wherein Solomona resides, of the whole island.

Two sides of it were environed with a large watergraft, and wi thin upon the verge or bank set with six rows in equal distance wi th tall pine and fir trees. It had twelve gates and twenty-four towers, two towers being placed between every gate of equal height and bigness. The whole fabric of build- ings, which was all of one height in the same street, was seated within the walls without any adjoining suburbs. The streets (which were all thirty foot in breadth) were paved through wi th grea t stones of marble, such as the houses were all built with on the sides, and in the midst with large round and very smooth stones, the drills and water channels being on each side of the highway near the houses. Every house there had leaden cisterns to preserve all the rainwater that fell from the houses, this being for the many uses conceived better than any other. But the most necessary use of it is, at any drought when the springs should chance to fail or the pipes be faulty.

The citadel was environed as in an island with this stately river and fortified with two wet grafts besides, to which there were no passages but by drawbridges and those countersi tuat.ed, Having shown me that also with its inexpugnable strength (which is rarely permitted to any strangers especially), he led me to the Chri st Church Cathedral, si tuated upon the highest part in the city, next that whereon the citadel stands, which overlooked and commanded all the town. From a pleasant tower of this Mother Church he showed me at once the resplendent glory of the whole town, the curious pile whereof being compact of such uniform build- ings all covered with copper, beautified with gilt pinnacles and high, well-formed towers, was so pleasant a prospect that I stood amazed and dazzled with the luster, being unwilling to move thence, I was so ravished with admiration and delight. We descended at last into the body of the church, in which were no pews for any to sit and sleep in, only several rows of mats thick set for the people to kneel on; for ease, he told me, \" ••• helps devotion, whereas hardship and suffering at it distracts the mind and makes it 96"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"NEW ATLANTIS seem tedious.\" Here the women kneel or stand about the upper part of it surrounded with the females of their families that they may not be seen of the men who stand lower amidst their male servants.

But by the way, a little before noon, we entered one of the three uni versi ties wherein was the most famous college of agriculture that the island afforded. Here after we had refreshed ourselves, to pass away two or three hours of the hottest part of the day, he brought me acquainted with the Provi- doran General, and Principal then of that famous college. A reverend old man he was, and no less learned in the history of nature, then full of courteous humanity both in his discourse and carriage. He first led us into a very fair physic garden, wherein he told us were almost as many medicinal plants and herbs as he believed Solomon knew, at least as are anywhere now to be found serviceable for the use of man or beast. Having observed there the many rarities, he was pleased to show me particularly there growing, as the sensible plant, semper-vivum, saffron, licorice, rice, caraway, anise, gromwell, virga aurea, elicampane, with many more. He took me by the hand and led me a little out of the town over the river on the backside of that garden which envi- roned that other great nursery (as he called it) and contained about a thousand acres. \"Herein,\" said he, \"••• we daily try several experiments of setting, sowing, planting, grafting, inoculating, ameliorating the earth with several composts: as the dry with marl; the lean and hungry with dung of pigeons, men, or horses, soot, sea sand or ooze, chalk, etc.; the sandy with mud; the cold wi th ashes; the rich wi th brakes, straw, 100"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"NEW ATLANTIS seaweeds, folding of sheep, e tc , , all which, as we find the ground, we use and apply to it.

For we conceive the well improving of a small island better than the conquering of a new large king- dom. That we may do this in all places alike and to the purpose, we use the means, and they are these: we buy in all commons, for they rather make poor than maintain them; therefore those which we have had were either long since bought in by the Providorans in every particular pro- vince or divided by them amongst the inhabitants adjoining who had right therein, according to their right and due proportions; one such acre thus enclosed and improved being now more benefi- cial to the meanest of them than four were before in common. Next we search all grounds for iron, tin, lead, gold, silver, and all other beneficial things whatsoever; likewise we enjoin all hus- bandmen to search their grounds for beneficial earths such as marl, chalk, fuller's earth and 101"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"NEW ATLANTIS the like, in the search of which they often find several precious stones, useful composts, and medicinal earths. \"Though we breed many stout horses towards the maritime parts, that by looking on the sea they may acquire more fierceness and become more emboldened for field-service; they being here seldom employed otherwise. Yet we conceive that oxen being less subject to diseases and main- tained with less cost and trouble, and will suf- fer more hardship, toil and labor are fitter than horses for the plough or wagon, and are here therefore most used. In many places also, espe- cially where the streets are even, we use great mastiff dogs (of which here we breed many) to draw up and down the streets things upon sledges, made low on purpose and running on four little wheels. By this means one stout dog that is fed wi th little or no charge shall carry or draw as much as any three men. That we may not want workmen, the Providoran furnishes us on the sud- den with harvestmen, either of the condemned collar-men or other freemen out of the adjoining next city. So that in one day, notice beforehand given him, any man's harvest may be cut and inned with little charge and trouble. That these coun- try farmers may live plentifully, pay their rent and lay up, every farm of such a value is to maintain so many hives of bees for wax and honey, wi th which as with currants, raspberries, dam- sons, mulberries, cherries, pinapples, pears, and 102"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"NEW ATLANTIS apples (of which last we have above 200 species), many excellent drinks are made to keep their families and sell besides.

For firing and other necessary uses, they are enjoined to plant in all their woods (espe- cially near home) swift growers, as the abletree, the ash, sallow aspen, willow, for hoops and hopples. Likewise they are enjoined to plant near their houses almonds, olives, chestnuts, walnuts, and quinces. Those whose farms are of the largest value are obliged to maintain so many boxes of silkworms, for the keeping of which they are to plant mulberry trees proportionable, on whose leaves they feed with little charge. The great product and gain by them (as he demonstrated, together with the ways of preserving them, which were very ingenious) is, said he, scarce credi- ble. Our next chief care is to prevent mischiefs, and in paticular mildews and smuttiness of corn; 1. by changing each year the species of grain; 2. by limiting the ground and corn, which last pre- serves it from birds and worms also. For preserv- ing your orchard, we first prune the trees well from moss, mistletoe, and suckers, sometimes opening the roots and relieving them wi th a new compost.

To prevent his farther discourse in came two gardeners with each of them a large cornucop- ia in his hand, full of all the variety of frui t the season then afforded. Having tasted some of the choicest he recommended, with some of his choicer cool drinks and wines of the place, he made us taste afresh of his singular humanity by accompanying us back to our inn, where he civilly left us, and where the rest of our company (though the envious time would not) tarried for and wai ted on us.

Before it was a spacious court, thickset with tall cypress trees, pines and jasmines in rows, in the midst of which a whi te marble fountain was erected and held up by eight brazen lions, each of them according to the antique Roman manner pouring out of their mouths the crystalline water.

In the midst of this court an obelisk of wonderful art, all of shining copper, set forth on the one side the proud squadrons of the Romans and on the other the Carthaginian camp in warlike equipage; the valiant Hannibal leading the one army, and that invincible African Scipio the other. On the other side stood those masculine spirits, Fabius Maxi- mus the buckler of Rome, and Marcus Furius Camil- lus the sword, fighting in the high capitol in his country's defense; Mutius Scaevola, Caesar, Pompey, Alexander, and Marcus Varro the happy consul.

This is that renowned Hungar- ian, said Joabin, who so valiantly resisted the Turks incursions, and slew of them 50, 000 at the battle of Naxon. After we had sufficiently beheld these heroic champions, he led us up into a large rich hall, whose ceiling was of carved ivory, and walls embellished with most lively portraits. There was Lucretia killing herself in very earn- est, and Artemis wailing over her husband Mauso- Ius's monument, with some wonder why it should be reckoned one of the world's seven wonders. There was the chaste Spanish Coronella committing her body to the devouring flames, rather than suffer her soul to flame with the least incentive or thought of lust. At the end of the hall in a large table, Cydias represented the Argonauts, for which Hortensius the Orator paid 144,000 sesterces.

This is the imperial abode, said he, larger than any of the other courts. It was set with orange, lemon, pomegranate, and mulberry trees, and called the Court of Residence. Hence we ascended by many stately black marble steps into the chamber of Presence, where Solomona was standing and conversing with his ancient and prime nobles, whom he familiarly called the Copartners of his care.

He was of middle stature, somewhat fair and ruddy, and in whose mild and serene aspect might be discovered those inward virtues and graces which adorned his noble soul.

This was called the Court of Virtue. Having viewed this well, we passed through a stately hall into the Academy itself, to which it belonged. The quadrangle was envisioned on three sides with fair cloisters, the pillars and arches being of mosaic, of gold and azure and other curious colors, like that of Amarodoc at Fez in Barbary. \"This is that eminent Academy,\" said he \" ... placed here in this glor- ious center for the concourse of all the prime selected wits throughout the nation, where they translate, write, license books, correct others, and purify the native language to the highest pitch of elegance. Right against the hall the library ranged, which was large and magnificent. Underneath it we passed into the fifth court, called the Court of Orpheus. In the midst of this, between several ranks of laurel and myrtle trees was a spacious fountain wherein Orpheus was playing on his harp, and ravishing wi th his di- vine melody (which by water was artificially made to resound) the approaching nymphs. 112"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"NEW ATLANTIS Thence he led us through an outward green court set with box, laurel, holly, ~ fir, Y5!!!.J... cypress, juniper, tamarisk, rosemary, and many other sorts of green trees that with their ver- dure caused spring to dwell there all the year long, into a long paddock course, somewhat broad- er than ordinary, railed and set with firs and sycamores. About it multitudes of people were gathered, as well nobles as gentry, to behold the expected race. The race, soon after that Solomona was come, was thus performed: eight noblemen's jennets were placed in a rank at the farther end of the paddock, having no riders on them, only a few round, rattling bells were fastened to the saddle skirts, some of them made prickly so that, when they were all set forth on running together, these might spur them forward in the course. \"This is our way of racing,\" said he \"••• perform- ed without any danger or possibility of cheating in horsemanship, which is too often practiced by your European jockeys and riders.\" The race fin- ished, the owner of the winning horse received the prize Solomona gave, which was a silver basin filled with 500 duckats in gold; the same horse being led away soon after with a garland on his head triumphantly and accompanied with divers sorts of loud and still music.

For thus they argue the natural beauty best; if the face be homely, say they, it is still God's image, therefore lovely; if extraordinarily beau- tiful, the less reason by thinking to mend God's workmanship to hide or disfigure any part of that divine firmament. Here the most excellent in their skill and feats of activity from all parts of the nation showed their cunning and dexterity. Some in fenc- ing, running, wrestling, others in shooting, slinging, leaping, pitching the bar, vaulting, darting and other pastoral sports, where for all that overcame were great rewards and prizes given proportionably to the victors' deserts. But above all the rest, Solomona seemed most to be taken with one of the Davidans, or flingers of stones, who not only out threw all the rest, but directed his charge so surely that he could hit the site almost every time, and that with such a force that the blow would prove as mortal as David's did to great Goliath. I then asked Joabin whether Solomona de- lighted not also in hunting now and then?

His nobles and great officers ate immediately after al to- gether in the great hall. In this interval Solo- mona withdrew himself after his accustomed manner through a long privy gallery which led to his queen's court on the other side of the river, to visit her and his relations. The nobles, all dispatching their meal in as short a time, came up again attending his return which was not long after.
