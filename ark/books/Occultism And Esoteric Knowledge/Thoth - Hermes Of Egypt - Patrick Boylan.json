I he purpose of this essay is to indicate the chief ten dencies of ancient Egyptian speculation in regard to the god Thoth. Taking as the basis of his work a fairly complete examination of the chief references to the god in Egyptian literature and ritual, the author has tried to distinguish the more important phases of Thoth s character as they were con ceived by the Egyptians, and to show how these aspects, or phases, of his being help to explain the various activities which are assigned to him in the Egyptian legends of the gods, and in the ritual of tombs and temples. An attempt has been made, in many instances, to discover the simple concrete meaning which often underlies characteristic epithets of the god, and the need of seeking groupings among epi thets which can in any way be associated with well-defined activities or aspects of the god has been emphasised. The author has not aimed at anything like a full analysis of the individuality of the god. That would have demanded a much closer and more detailed study of Egyptian religious litera ture, and a more extensive recording of results, than Egypto logical scholarship has hitherto attempted in regard to any problem of ancient Egyptian religion. It will be noticed that texts derived from the Egyptian literature of the Graeco-Roman period have been freely used throughout this essay. Every student of Ptolemaic texts be comes rapidly convinced that those texts contain a consi derable amount of theology, which, though it cannot, perhaps,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"VI PREFACE. be always paralleled from the older texts, seems to be fully in line with genuine Egyptian thought of the early - - some times of the very early period. Hence, whenever the Ptolemaic texts seemed to promise any assistance in explain ing aspects of Thoth, they have been used as authentic documents of Egyptian speculation and belief. For the theological thought of the early period, the Pyramid texts have, of course, been minutely examined. Consi derations of space and expense have excluded the printing of quotations from the Pyramid texts, but frequent references to the numbered Spniche of Sethe s Pyramidcntexte will enable the reader to follow and control the writer s use of the Pyramid literature. Passages from the Book of the Dead, in like fashion, have been, for the most part, referred to, rather than quoted. The references are generally to Naville s Totenbuch (in the text of which, however, certain slight emendations based on \\V&amp;lt;&quot;&amp;gt;rtcrbuch material, have sometimes been incorporated). The theme of this essay was suggested to the writer some time before the outbreak of the Great War by Professor Krman. The subject had already been treated by the Russian scholar Turayeff in his lion, TOTT, which was published in 1898. Though that study was the outcome of painstaking work on the part of the distinguished Russian Egyptologist, it was, on the one hand, inaccessible to most students of Egyptology and Comparative Religion, and, on the other, it needed to be largely supplemented and modified in view of the great advance in Egyptological research since 1898. Most of the results of that advance were stored up in the material which had been gradually accumulated for the Berlin Wiirterbuch, and Professor Erman made the composition of this essay pos sible by procuring permission for the writer to make free use of that material. The writer s gratitude is due to Pro fessor Erman not only for procuring that permission, but also, and still more, for the unfailing generosity with which he"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"PREFACE. VII put at the writer s disposal his great store of knowledge and his keen critical ability whenever he was consulted on any question arising out of textual or other difficulties connected with the study of the character and worship of Thoth. To Professor H. Schafer, and to the other officials of the Egypt ian Museum at Berlin, and to many of the young scholars who were engaged on work connected with the Worterbuch, the author is greatly indebted for much courtesy and kindness. The thanks of the writer are due in a very special way to Professor Hermann Junker of Vienna. To him he owes his initiation into the Egyptian script and literature of the Ptole maic period, and to Dr. Junker s published work on the reli gion of the Ptolemaic period many points in the present essay are due, directly or indirectly. During the passage of this essay through the press, Dr. Junker has found time, in the midst of his academical duties in Vienna, to read the proofs, and to make many useful suggestions. For all his kindly help the writer is deeply grateful. To Dr. W. Till of Vienna who helped to prepare the MS for the printer, and assisted con stantly in the proof-reading, much thanks is also due. The title of the essay has been chosen partly to suggest from the beginning an important and intelligible aspect of Thoth to the general reader, and partly to remind the student that a god who, at first sight, might seem to be a divinity of purely Egyptian importance, was, nevertheless, associated with such a widely flowing current of ancient thought as the speculation of the Hermetic writings.

The name of Thoth. The name of the god with whom this essay is concerned occurs with considerable frequency in the texts of the Old Kingdom. In the oldest texts, however, it is written mainly with the familiar symbol of the god - - an ibis on a perch, and only very rarely do we find in the most ancient texts the fully written form of the name. The Old Kingdom gives us as a scriptio plena of Thoth s name ~l|%^.(i) This form of script is common also in the funerary texts of the Middle Kingdom, and is especially frequent in the inscriptions of the nomarchs of El-Bersheh.

From the foregoing textual and traditional material it is possible to reconstruct the Egyptian pronunciation of the god s name. The Sahidic eooyi belongs to the class of Coptic substantives ending in T, in which the chief vowel stands before the consonant that precedes the T. It would suggest, therefore, an Egyptian form like De-howti or Te-how-ti (cf. Steindorff, Kopt. Gramm.*, p. 60). The form GOOyT, again, with its short O reminds one of nisbe-forms ; and these nisbe- forms present, as Sethe has shown, the same general ap pearance as substantives with pronominal suffixes. As O)AHT and 0)ANT come from and ffjj] o, 2pAl-2pHI from ^, PA2T from p&amp;lt;D26, so, in like manner, the apparently nisbe- form D e howti would be derived from Dhwt.

Thoth in the legends of Osiris and Horus. Of all the numerous myths and legends to which ancient Egyptian monuments and texts refer there is but one which we can reconstruct with reasonable completeness. It is the legend or myth of Osiris. This legend, however, would have remained for us as incomplete and fragmentary as the multi tudes of others alluded to in passing, or vaguely outlined, in Egyptian rituals or calendars, had not the divinity which supplied its theme, become, in virtue of the most vigorous of ancient religious propagandas, and of historical accidents which are but obscurely known, the most powerful and vene rable of the Egyptian gods. Another circumstance -- quite external has contributed greatly to make the Osiris-legend of decisive importance for modern students of Egyptian religion : Plutarch selected that legend to illustrate by its various pha ses his theories on the nature and growth of religious beliefs. Plutarch has thus given us a moderately systematic account of the worship of Osiris, and of the origins of that worship ; and in Plutarch we find, grouped together to form a single picture, many features of the Osirian legend which would otherwise have remained for us without bond of connection, scattered here and there throughout the literature of Ancient Egypt. But, while Plutarch has thus systematised for us much that would have remained without him empty of meaning and reference, his very tendency to systematise, and his preoccu pations of theory often diminish the value of his work for modern students. He seems, at times, to confuse fact and sym bol, and his groupings of incident are often, no doubt, due more to the needs of logical construction, than to the realities of ancient Egyptian belief. Yet, however much Plutarch s phi losophy may colour his description of fact, we may take his account of the Osirian legend as largely reliable. The control"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"12 THOTH IN THE LEGENDS OF OSIRIS AND HORUS. which native Egyptian texts - especially very ancient ones supply, is, in the main, a ground of trust in Plutarch s account. The legend of Osiris, as outlined in Egyptian texts, and in Plutarch, may well be taken as the best starting-point for the study of the most ancient organised Egyptian theology. It will serve here to supply important points of view in regard to Thoth. To discover the real place of our god in the Osirian Cycle is to ascertain his importance in the most ancient re ligious thought of P^gypt. It is necessary to discuss whether Thoth belongs to the legend of Osiris essentially or merely extrinsically ; wether his importance as a divinity preceded, or was mainly due to, the growth of Osirian cult. It must obviously be of importance to show whether there are any outstanding aspects of Thoth which owe their origin solely or chiefly to the story and the religion of Osiris. And, as the legend of Osiris is closely involved with those of Horus the son of Isis, and Horus the Sun-god, it will be necessary to investigate Thoth s role in relation to the two Horuses, If we succeed in defining, even vaguely, Thoth s place in these ancient legends, we shall have reached some notion of his importance among the gods of Ancient Egypt, and some idea of his character as it was primitively conceived. a) Thoth in the legend of Osiris. In the Osirian legend of Plutarch there are five chief dramatis perstmae - - Osiris, the prudent king who procured for Egypt the blessings of peace, well-being, and civilisation, Isis his faithful spouse, Horus his son and heir, Typhon (Set) his unscrupulous and energetic rival, and Hermes (Thoth) who appears chiefly as thg friend and legal advocate of Horus. Plutarch speaks of a great la\\v-suit which Horus had to su stain against Typhon in which the strong support of Hermes for Horus. (i) The aim of Typhon in the law-suit was to prove the illegitimacy of Horus, and, thus, to deprive the latter of all right of succession to the throne of Osiris. Through the brilliant support of Thoth the legiti macy of Horus was established, and his right of succession (i) h. et O. ch. 54, 34 : 19, 8."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THOTH IN THE LEGENDS OF OSIRIS AND HORUS. i3 to Osiris confirmed. This victory of Horus over Set through the advocacy of Thoth Plutarch calls a victory of reason (Lo gos} over disorder and evil. Plutarch s description of this great law-suit, though we can follow it in its main features, is confused in detail. It is obvious that Plutarch had not sufficient data to give a per fectly clear and consistent narrative of the legal conflict bet ween Horus and Set, or of the part played in it by Thoth. There are gathered together in his narrative strands from several ancient legends. With the help of the native Egyptian texts, however, we can complete the Plutarchian version of the Osirian legend and of Thoth s place in it. It is clear from his work that Plutarch did not really regard Osiris as an ancient king who had founded the civili sation of Egypt, and had been opposed, and, at last, destroyed by his rival and brother. Osiris is for Plutarch a symbol either of the all-fertilising Nile, or of the moist reproductive powers of nature(i). He is satisfied that Osiris is somehow symbolic of generative or reproductive power in nature, for he finds that Osiris and Dionysos have been identified. He, further, raises with the Mathematikoi the question whether Osiris and Set (Typhon) are not to be contrasted with each other as sun and moon. (2) In this reference Plutarch finds many points in Osiris which suggest, strangely enough, his identification with the moon. Plutarch, then, is not seriously concerned with the idea of Osiris as a king. Whether, however, Plutarch was led to explain the Osirian legend symbolically rather than histori cally, because he had closely studied the native Egyptian teaching on the matter, or because a symbolical interpre tation fitted in best with his theories of religious develop ments, we cannot determine. He is wrong, at all events, in attempting, as he does, to reduce every feature of the legend to symbolism. In the legend of Osiris, as in most ancient myths, popular constructive fancy and priestly speculation have added many details of importance to the primitive myth. And these additions have not always been made in the spirit (1) h. et O. c. 32, 2 ff. : c. 33. (2) Is. et O. c. 34. Cf. cc. 36-39 : 4142."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"I 4 THOTH IN THE LEGENDS OF OSIRIS AND HORUS. of the legend s primitive symbolism. Hence, in order to ascer tain Thoth s true role in the Osirian story, we must seek to disentangle that story from the accretions made to it by the popular, and priestly mind. We cannot hope, however, to set up more than a purely tentative reconstruction of the pri mitive myth of Osiris. But it is obviously only by discovering the primitive form of the legend that we can decide whether Thoth was, in reality, one of its dramatis personae. i. The primitive Osiris-myth. The Osirian religion appears as well established in the oldest religious literature of Egypt - - the Pyramid texts. It is, indeed, the dominant religion of that literature. That the Osirian cult had passed through a long period of development before it appears in a stereotyped form in the Pyramid period must be assumed. But, even in the oldest texts, the primitive form of the myth, the nucleus out of which Osirian religion had grown, is almost forgotten. Even in the oldest texts we can see that a large mass of heterogeneous detail has already been built up about and above the primitive myth. Yet some times in the Pyramid texts the ideas of the primitive Osiris- myth show through the details superadded by century-long speculation. Erom these occasional glimpses of the primitive myth which the early literature gives us, much support can be derived for Plutarch s symbolic interpretation of the Osirian legend, and, particularly, for his view that Osiris represents somehow the reproductive forces of nature. It is well known that the ritual of the Osirian cult re sembles, even in the oldest texts, the ritual of the so-called &quot;mystery &quot;-religions, i and we know that in the ancient world the &quot;mysteries&quot; were, as a rule, attempts to dramatise occur rences in nature. It would be reasonable, therefore, to regard the &quot;mysteries&quot; of Osiris, or the &quot;Passion&quot; of Osiris as a dramatisation of some event in nature, possibly of the death of nature in late autumn and winter, and its revival in spring. If the primitive cult of Osiris was based on the recurrence (i) Herodotus II, ijof. speaks of the representation of the passion of Osiris at Sais as uyjt^cta. Plutarch also speaks of the dramatisation of Osiris sorrows as tsXtza- (Is. et O. 27). Cf.

That there is a well-pronounced magical element in the oldest Osirian texts seems fairly evident. But, so far, scholars have given little attention to this feature of early Osirian theology. The data at hand to determine the meaning of the pri mitive myth of Osiris are few. This essay is concerned with them only in so far as they help to throw light on the growth of the cult of Thoth. We give, therefore, no more than th* general heads of the Egyptian evidence for the Plutarchian or symbolical theory of the Osirian cult. Osiris is represented in the Pyramid texts (x) as carry ing off the dead as his booty, /. e. in his capacity as earth- god^ or Geb. (2) It appears, again, from ancient texts (3) that Osiris was sometimes worshipped as a tree. Schafer has given reasons (4) for connecting Osiris with the /?/rr-tree in Abydos by means of the notion of tree-worship. This ^Ar-tree stands in the closest connection with Osiris. It is mentioned in the &quot;mysteries&quot; of the god. It is not impossible that the motif of the legend in which the coffin of Osiris is discovered in the erica tree (5) is derived from the cult of Osiris as a tree. In many places Osiris appears quite unambiguously as god of burgeoning nature, or of vegetation. He it was, as we learn from Greek sources, (6) who discovered the vine, and taught men how to cultivate corn. This would not, of course, make Osiris a primitive corn-god, or vine-god for he was not anything so definite as this to start with. (7 } But the ancient Egyptian texts certainly bring him into close relation ,with developing plant-life. (8) He is lord of the vine when it is luxuriantly abundant (Pyr. 1524). We find Osiris sending (1) Pyr. 145 : 350. (2) Cf. Krman, Religion, p. 104. (3) Pyr. 128587 : Cf. Is. et O. c. 20. (4) A.Z. 1904, p. 109.

(3) When the corn sprouted in the clay image of the god, and when the green of the sprouting corn outlined the figure of the god, he could readily be seen to stand for nature in its reproductive power. A similar custom existed of sketching the figure of Osiris on a piece of stuff, strewing the outlined figure with earth, and planting corn in the earth thus strewn. (4) These customs seem to point clearly to an association of Osiris with the life of vegetation. It may, therefore, per haps, be safely assumed that, in some, at least, of his primitive aspects, Osiris was regarded as the fructifying principle of nature in its growth. It falls in well with this view, that, ac cording to Plutarch, (51 the feast of the death of Osiris was celebrated on the 17&quot; Hathor (November).

His death synchronised with the death of nature. With the symbolism of Osiris as representing the re productive powers of nature is connected his identification with the Nile. Thus, it is said, Pyr. 589: &quot;Horus comes: he perceives his father in thee, fresh (2) as thou art, in thy name fresh (living) water.&quot; In Edfu there is an unmistakable passage. Osiris is represented as spewing forth the Nile, and the accompanying text says: &quot;I hide my body to make thy fields prosper.&quot; (3) With this we may connect the frequent designation of the Nile as the &quot;outflow of Osiris&quot;. (4) In the Shabaka text Osiris appears as &quot;He to whom the waters of the inundation belong, and who is drowned himself therein&quot;; and one must agree with Erman when he says of this passage : &quot;His (i. e. Osiris ) role as god of the cultivated fields and of vegetation, could scarcely be expressed more clearly.&quot; (5) The dramatic element, which is known to have been an ciently present in the cult of Osiris, points, as was suggested above, to the probability that that cult developed from a nature-myth. Further, it has been shown that Egyptian litera ture gives clear, if not frequent, indications that Osiris was regarded anciently both as a Nile-god, and as an earth-god. It is not a very great assumption, then, to suppose that in the primitive myth of Osiris, this god represented, or was identified (1) From the iStli to the 25^ Hathor were made the Osirian barley-beds. Indeed it would seem as if all the chief Osirian festivals were celebrated in the month of Hathor. Cf. Davies and Gardiner, Tomb of Amcnemhct. p. 115.

This idea of Osiris may possibly underlie the legend of the dismembering and resto ration of his body. As in other lands, so also in Egypt, the waning and rebirth of nature furnished motifs for religious dramas. With the &quot;Passion&quot; of Osiris one is forced to com pare the saga of Tammuz, and the cult of Dionysos and Attis. The ancient nature-dramas -- Semitic, Asiatic, Greek agree substantially in the number and roles of their dramatis pcrsonac. There are present in all the dying nature-god, his spouse who bewails him, and his malicious foe and rival who brings about his destruction. How many actors do we find in the drama of Osiris? Isis appears in the drama obviously as the female counter part of Osiris. (2) Both are children of Heaven and Earth. If Osiris is the fructifying principle of nature, Isis must be the fructified nature that brings forth. She is, according to Plutarch ($} the female principle of nature. Isis is TSVES-.:, just like Osiris, and from the two proceed the vsvvYjT .y.xi ap/ai. To put it another way: Horus, according to Plutarch, (4) is the child of the Nile, and of the inundated soil, and hence his birthplace is the marshland, Buto. Isis, further, in her aspect as Selene, is regarded as mother of the Kosmos. (5) When everything seems to sink into the sleep of death in the shorten ing days of autumn, Isis bewails her dying spouse, -- nature unfructified bewails the passing of the life which would have kept her living and productive. Thus Osiris and Isis, as the fructifying and the fructified elements of life and nature, belong, of necessity, to the primitive nature-myth. Is the god Typhon, or Set, an equally necessary figure in the drama ? (1) Plutarch says (Is.ctO., 0.51, 4) that Osiris was represented ithy- phallically, &quot;because of his generative and luxuriant nature&quot;, Cf. chapters 3335 ibiJ. (2) For the Greeks Isis was, at times, identical with Demeter : Cf. Hero dotus II, 59 ; Diod. Sic. I. 25, 96. For Isis as goddess of fertility and corn- growing, cf. Augustine, DC civ, Dei, VIII, 27.

Set is this enemy. He is the brother of Osiris because the rivalry of brothers is the most obvious, and the most widely known. From the cosmic standpoint he is the power which brings the moisture and life of nature to an end. He is the evil principle which brings distruction to the source of fertility, to the &quot;good god&quot;, the SsOj^ He is n0t the ocean which swallows up the Nile, (i) but rather a symbol of what dries up and destroys (2). He symbolises all things which hinder or destroy the generative powers of nature. (3) With the destructive burning glow of the south wind (4) he fights against his brother. When the Nile failed to reach the wonted level of inundation, this was ascribed to the hindering power of the hostile Typhon. Every influence, indeed, which made difficult, or impossible, the till ing of the fields, or the growth of the crops, was incorporated in Set. All this is not stated, of course, about Set in the ancient Egyptian texts, and much of the above is based on Plutarch s philosophising. In some such way, however, we must recon struct the part of Set in the original myth of Osiris. As we shall see presently, however, the story of Osiris is so in extricably interwoven with that of Horus, that the features of the Osirian Set are quite obscured by details derived from the legend of Horus. It remains now to inquire what part - - if any, can have been played by Thoth in this primitive nature-myth of Osiris, this dramatic rehearsal of the phenomena of nature s growth and decay. Were Thoth primitively an astral deity, one might infer his right to some place in the drama in question, for the heavenly bodies -- particularly the sun and moon, might be looked on as influencing greatly the growth of nature, and the phases of agricultural life, both as life-giving, and as time-determining factors. Yet, so far as we can see, the old Osirian legend had just as little to do with the heavenly (1) Is. et O. c. 32, 2. (2) Is. et O. c. 33, i. (3) Is. et O. c. 49, 4. (3) Is. et O. c. 3g, 2."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"20 THOTH IN THE LEGFNDS OF OSIRIS AND HORUS. bodies as had the parallel nature-myths in the ancient world. No doubt, as thought developed, there were interwoven with the Osiris-leg-end many other myths which were concerned with the sun and moon. But these myths had little or nothing to do with the primitive cult of Osiris. An astral Thoth does not, therefore, fit into the primitive Osiris-legend, and the other aspects of Thoth, which we shall have to discuss, seem to fit him just as little as his astral qualities, to play a part in the drama of a vegetation-deity. Yet it cannot be denied that Thoth appears in a striking way in the saga of Osiris. This is evident, not merely from Plutarch, but from ancient native Egyptian texts. There is. however, the possibility that this activity of Thoth in the Osirian legend is due to secondary factors, that, while having no part in the primitive nature-myth, Thoth becomes nevitably connected with a more developed form of that myth. 2. The Saga of Osiris as King. It was more or less inevitable that a nature-myth like that of the dying Osiris should gradually be built up into a semi-historical drama ; and the story of Plutarch shows us the semi-historical form into which the Osirian legend deve loped. The transformation of the primitive myth must have begun very early, since, even in the oldest religious texts, it lias gone so far as to obscure almost completely the original story. In the Pyramid texts Osiris appears usually, not as a dying and revivified god of nature, but as a half-human, half- divine king of ancient Egypt, who succumbs to the malice and intrigues of his brother, is bewailed by his faithful spouse, and, finally, avenged by his posthumous son and successor, Horus. The chief shrines of ancient Osiris-cult seem to have stood in northern Egypt, and we may, therefore, possibly con jecture a northern origin of the developed form of the legend. To the ancient nature-myth Horus, the son of Isis hardly belongs. P&amp;gt;ut in a drama of rivals contending for the throne of Egypt such a son of Osiris and Isis was quite in place. This drama in its historico-political form was dominant in ancient Egypt, as the oldest texts show, and from this circum stance we can easily explain the importance and popularity in ancient Egypt of the &quot;Son who avenges his father&quot;."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THOTH IN THE LEGENDS OF OSIRIS AND HORUS. 21 Harsiesis, then, seems to belong- essentially to the semi- political form of the Osiris-story. Thoth appears as an im portant personage in the same story. The question thus arises whether Thoth belongs to the royal drama as a necessary dramatis persona - - whether his personality connects him es sentially with the legend, whether, therefore, his general character may not be largely derivable from the necessities of the semi-historical development of the Osirian nature-myth. On the other hand, it is possible - - and many things point that way that Thoth has come even into- the developed legend in a secondary fashion, bringing with him his pecu liarities, and not deriving them, to any noticeable degree, from his role in the legend. Plutarch introduces Thoth into the story of Osiris merely as the legal supporter of the son of Isis against Set. (i ) In the Pyramid texts many functions in regard to Osiris are assigned to him. One of these frequently referred to is the putting to gether of the scattered members of the dead Osiris. (2) The same activity is, however, also, and perhaps more naturally, ascribed to Nephthys in her quality as Scshat &quot;the Writer&quot;, the patroness of architects. (3) Thoth will come before us later as god of script and magic, and as guardian of the dead. Hence we are probably justified in assuming that this function exercised by him of assembling and uniting the disjecta membra of the dead, belongs to him out of all connection with the Osirian story, and that it belongs to him, just as it does to Seshat, because of some quality of his own peculiar individuality. In Pyr. 63g Thoth receives from Geb permission to put together the members of the god - - which seems merely to mean that Thoth receives from the grave or tomb ( the domain of the earth-god, Geb\\ the body of the king, so that he may somehow make it capable of resisting decay. There does not seem to be any certain reference to agricultural processes in the broken or divided body of the dead (i. e. the king, Osiris). (1) Whether the lawsuit in question belongs to the story of Osiris, and is not really borrowed from the legends of Horus, is not quite clear. (2) Pyr. 639 747 : 83o. (3) Pyr. 616. To this trace is an interesting parallel Berlin 1175 (M.

When the gates of v\\ S^ are opened by a word of power spoken by Anubis acting as Thoth (i) we can ex plain this also from Thoth s known character outside the Osirian drama, for Thoth, as we shall see, is Lord of magic speech. Indeed his activity as architect of Osiris body may, perhaps, be specially connected with his power of magic words, of wonderworking formulae. 12) While in the Pyramid texts Thoth appears in relation to Osiris mainly in the ceremony of reuniting the limbs of the dead king (== Osiris), we find him in the religious texts of the M. and N. Kingdom chiefly as advocate of Osiris in the great trial of the dead. From this function has arisen Thoth s familiar epithet &quot;he who made Osiris triumphant (^^I v5ft) against his foes&quot;. (3) The Pyramids, too, seem to refer to this activity of Thoth. According to Pyr. 1521 1528 a decree or decision making Osiris a god of heaven (as distin guished from a mere god of earth) was uttered as &quot;a great and mighty word that proceeded from the mouth of Thoth&quot;. This &quot;great word&quot; is not, perhaps, the same as the speech of Thoth which made Osiris &quot;triumphant&quot;, but it is clearly akin to it. The Pyramids do actually speak of a verdict which de clared Set to be ^ o &amp;lt;^N r i (&quot;guilty?&quot;; and Osiris _J^ ^&amp;gt; (4). Was this verdict also procured, or spoken, by Thoth? The Pyramid trial in which Osiris is declared to be &quot;triumphant&quot; (or &quot;justified&quot;) is not to be confused with the trial spoken of by Plutarch, in which Thoth prevails as Logos Pyr. 790 ; 17 1 3.

The trial referred to by Plutarch seems to have been held before the gods of Heliopolis. The trial described in the Egyptian funerary texts, in which Osiris was pronounced justified&quot;, seems to have been pictured by the Egyptians as a sort of exemplar death-trial, or judgment. The Bk. of the Dead puts this trial in the &quot;Princes House&quot; at Heliopolis; (i) but the localisation is probably to be ex plained by the growing preponderance of Heliopolitan theo logy. It is only very vaguely that the Pyramid texts speak of a trial of Osiris and Set, (2) and they give no idea of the place where it was held. Indeed the idea of a legal conflict between Osiris and Set decided before a divine tribunal is, to say the least, unobtrusive. (3) It is not impossible that this conflict is a purely secondary detail borrowed from the Horus- Set story. That Osiris should be brought before the gods to be judged is explicable enough when one remembers that Osiris with his Abydos title &quot;Prince of the Dead&quot; has to serve, in all things, as exemplar of those who should follow him to the &quot;west&quot;.

It is there put forward as a possibility (note i ) that Osiris was, in the first instance, a type of the dead king, and that it was only after the time of the O. K. that he became a god of the dead. The con necting link between the two ideas dead king and god of the dead would be the ever-growing custom of using the royal funerary ritual for nobles and burghers, as well as for kings. Thus, while in the O. K. the king alone was identified with Osiris, it became customary at a later time to identify all the dead with Osiris. This view is very important. It does not seem, however, to take sufficient account of the influence on the cult of Osiris of the identification of Osiris with the Abydenc god of the dead, the &quot;Prince of the Westerners&quot;. Further, no ex planation is offered of the identification of the dead king with Osiris in the O. K.

On the other hand, a trial or legal process of such earnestness as the judgment of the dead, could not be imagined otherwise than after the fashion of the great state- tribunal of Heliopolis. Thus the trial came to be located in Heliopolis, and to be conducted before the Heliopolitan gods of whom, as we shall see, Osiris himself actually was one. Then the old mythical rival of Osiris, the wicked Set, was introduced to provide the necessary role of plaintiff in a great lawsuit. with Osiris. But docs not this circumstance suggest a view like that put for ward in the text, -- that the &quot;Passion&quot; of a nature-god has been gradually transformed into a semi-historical drama in which the king of Egypt is slain by his rival brother ? The slaying of the king would, of course, be the chief incident in a funerary ritual. If Osiris came to be regarded as a king of ancient Egypt, what he did and suffered would naturally become exem- plaric for all kings of a later time, and then, in the fashion suggested bv Gardiner, for all Egyptians. Junker in his recent remarkable work Die Onurislegendc (&quot;Wien, 1917) is inclined to think that some features of Osiris as a king of Egypt rather than as a god of nature may be due to such con siderations as the political preponderance of the Osirian nome, Busiris, in the ancient period. The ancient local god of that nome ndti wears the peculiar orna ment of the two ostrich feathers on his head. (Pyr. 6143 : 220 c : i833d). These ostrich feathers appear then later in combination with the diadem of upper Egypt to form the . // crown. The t\\vo ostrich feathers appear also in the nome-signs of This and Elkab, and are found also in connection with the cult-symbol of Chad, and with the insignia of Sobek and Tatencn in Memphis. All this seems, accord ing to Junker (o;\\ cit. p. 65), to suggest the probability that some ancient chief, whose home was Busiris. succeeded in establishing an extensive kingdom in upper Egypt in the prc-dynastic period. The ancient god of the Busiris nome, ndti, had his worship recognised throughout the territory which became subject to the victorious chief of the ndti nome. Junker notes the interesting fact that the sacred lake in (I (1 ( was called &quot; &quot;&quot;&quot;^ a further indication of the ro- /) 1 1 /VSAAAA &quot; r \\ lineal importance of the Busiris nome in the prc-dynastic period. There can be little doubt that political influences of the most varied types worked together to bring about the great extension of Osirian cult in ancient Egypt. It was possibly a result of political movements that the cult of Osiris was established in Abydos. and that Osiris thus came to be identified with Hnti iinntin: the Abydenc god of the dead. The breaking up of the body of Osiris Junker is disposed to regard, rather as an echo of the ancient custom of dismembering the dead body of a de feated foe, and distributing the sundered limbs among the victors (cf. Pyr. 1 863 ft , and Pyr. 1543 50), than as a feature derived from a nature-myth (Onurislcgcudc, p. 55). Junker s &quot;theory of the political expansion of the Busirian nome and, with it, of Osirian cult supposes without much show of explanation the identification of Osiris with the local god ndti. But this identification is itself a problem."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THOTH IN THE LEGENDS OF OSIRIS AND HOKUS. 25 An eloquent advocate was just as necessary in the case as a vigorous plaintiff. Thus Thoth came to play his part in the lawsuit. But it is to be noted that, as before in regard to the reuniting of the limbs of the dead, so here also, Thoth s character fitted him for his special functions. Thoth was, as we shall see, quite apart from the trial of Osiris, connected with the dead, especially in relation to the Judgment. His peculiar eloquence, and the magical power of his words fitted him to be the advocate and general helper of the dead. Hence, in the great exemplar trial Thoth must be thought of as the advocate of the First of the dead&quot;. Because, again, the Osirian trial was constructed popularly after the fashion of a case in the High Court of Heliopolis, Thoth s activity in the trial was inevitably conceived after the manner of a High Court Assessor, Advocate, or Scribe. The growth of popular imagination in reference to the Trial of Osiris will have been connected by action and re action with the innumerable representations of the judgment- scene depicted on the tombs and coffins of the Middle and the New Kingdom, Out of a saga grew the pictorial setting, and this, in turn, helped to develop the saga. The popular notion of Thoth s intervention in the trial of Osiris must have gathered not a few of its details from Egyptian funerary art. In view of the foregoing, then, it may be said that Thoth s part in the semi-historical form of the Osirian drama is chiefly due to essential and independent features of Thoth s own character. That implies that Thoth is not in any way a creation of the Osirian myth, and that we must not take the Osirian drama as a starting point in the analysis of Thoth s personality. He seems, indeed, in many ways to be as ancient and as independent a god as Osiris himself. We find in Egyptian sources many references to other activities of Thoth in regard to Osiris which also seem to follow from the anciently conceived independent character of the god. Thus we learn that Thoth acted as vizier for Osiris (i ) probably when the latter was carrying on his campaign ot civilising the world. Thoth appears also as Secretary or (i) Mar.. Dcnd. II, 33 c.

Scribe of Osiris, (i) This idea is a detail borrowed from the legends of the sun-god. Thoth is the scribe of Re. and when Osiris, the great type of the Dead, comes to be identified with Re, Thoth becomes the secretary of Osiris (= the dead). In the passage of the Book of the Dead just referred to, (2) the dead is represented as seated at the side of Osiris, in the capacity of Thoth the Scribe. There is obviously a reference here to the voyages of the sun-god in his barque. But it looks strange, at first sight, that the dead should be likened to Thoth rather than to Osiris. There is here, however, merely a confusion of religious thought, due partly to an old theory which identified the dead with the moon-god, (3) and partly to the idea that the dead becomes one of the attendants of Re in his barque of millions . Kven the Pyramid texts give to the dead king the position of Scribe in the solar barque ; (4) and, at times, the official scribe of the sun-god is represented as ousted from his place to make way for the royal dead.

One of these legends is that referred to by Plutarch (Is. ct O. 19, 67), according to which Hermes (Thoth) crowned Isis with a crown of horns after she had been deposed by Horus. The Papyrus Sallier (IV, 3, 5 6) evidently refers to the same legend, when it tells how Horus cut oif the head of Isis. and how Thoth then probably by his magic for mulae - - set upon her shoulders the head of a cow so that she became the &quot;First of the Kine&quot; i.e. the goddess ofAtlih.

The texts in question, however, are too few, and too difficult in their isolation, to afford a basis for any view of Thoth s re lationship with the gods of the Osirian cycle, (i) There can be little doubt that the prominence of Thoth in the more developed form of the Osirian drama is largely due to the increasing popularity of Thoth himself. The more familiar he became to the religious mind of Egypt, the more striking was the role assigned to him in the most popular cult of the country - - the cult of Osiris. If it is true, as Maspcro suggested, (21 that the Osirian Saga had its beginnings in the Delta, we may suppose it to be possible that the ibis-god Thoth was brought into the Saga at first partly by geographical considerations. The Ibis-nome of Lower Egypt is so near many of the chief scenes of the Osirian tragedy, that the god of that nome would pass easily into the cast of the tragedy. The presence of Thoth in the cycle of Osirian legend is, therefore, due mainly to external reasons. When, therefore, we find the two gods Osiris and /ITioth standing together, apparently in close relationship, in such ancient texts as the funerary inscriptions of the M. K., we must not suppose that the two are essentially related to each other, or that Thoth (1) There seems to be a reference to this legend in an Kdfu lext Koch.

As our study of Thoth s character proceeds it will be come more and more evident how inevitably his own personal gifts fitted him to take a part in the semi-historical drama which was grafted on to the mysteries&quot; of the primitive nature-myth, (i) As the god of law and right Thoth would naturally become the ally of Osiris in his contest with Set, and his advocate in his trial as &quot;First of the Dead before the gods of Heliopolis. Thoth s other functions in regard to Osiris, the preparation of the god s ( king s &amp;gt; body for burial (with Anubisi, the bringing together of the god s limbs, the equipping of Osiris against the perils of the world beyond the grave, the offering of the due funeral sacrifices, and the carry ing out of the ritual prescribed for burial - - all these acti vities were equally required for every case of burial of king or noble. Indeed the details of the developed Osirian legend are little more than an echo of the main features of the life and death of the Pharaohs of the Old and M. Kingdoms. Every rite performed for the Pharaoh in historical times must have been performed also for the model Pharaoh, Osiris, in the far off past. The functions of Thoth in the legend are such as he must naturally, have performed outside it. Thoth was. in all probability, a god of the dead and of sacred ritual prior to his connection with the drama of Osiris. But, though it is true that Thoth s character and functions are not due to his connection with the Osirian legend, the central cult of Kgypt, with its elaborate ritual, with its literature, and pictorial representations, could not fail to give a more concrete defi- nitcness to the deities associated with it. Some measure of moulding and influence, and much help towards popularity must, therefore, have been derived by Thoth from the Osirian cult, though in himself he is already a definite individuality (f) It is obvious, of course, that the theory of the growth of a nature-myth into an historico- political drama in which a god of vegetation becomes a king of Kgvpt. is largely an assumption.

We shall see, in the course of this study how Thoth acquired a number of standing epithets through his association with scenes in the later forms of the Osirian le gend, and we shall see from these epithets something of the manner in which Egyptian theology tended to develop. b) Thoth in the legends of Horns. We must make careful distinction between Egyptian sagas dealing with the sun-god Horus and his enemy Set, and the legends of Osiris. Even Plutarch seems to know some thing of this necessary distinction when he speaks ii) of the birth of the &quot;ancient&quot; Horus (Harooris), thus implying that this Horus is other than the son of Osiris and Isis. Just as the primitive myth of Osiris the nature-god was enlarged as time went on, and greatly altered in motif by accretions due to popular and priestly theologising, so, in the legend of Horus and Set, an earlier and later stage can be distinguished. The subject cannot be fully investigated here, but tin- distinction of the earlier form of the legend from its later developments must be briefly explained so far as it affects the position, in ancient theology, of Thoth. In this legend, as in that of Osiris, the starting-point is to be sought in certain cosmic happenings, i 21 In the primitive myth of Horus, the sun and moon on the one hand, and darkening influences on the other seem to be the chief factors. In brief, it may be said that the primitive myth deals with the conflict of the powers of light with the powers of darkness. In due course this myth was enlarged into a legend of struggles between antagonists half-human, half-divine. The primitive myth can be traced somewhat more easily here than (1) /.v. ct (). 12, 6. (2) It is assumed here that one of the oldest forms of the ancient Horns (Haroeris) is Horus the god of heaven, or god of light, the god whose t\\vo eyes are the sun and moon, JJnti irti, &quot;He on whose forehead are the two eyes&quot;. The possible existence of another equally ancient form of Horus as warrior-god, who as falcon led the early tribes of Egypt to victory, and was later regarded as in carnate in the Pharaohs, need not be here discussed. The two aspects of Horus. as god of light, and as warrior-god, or god of battles, are close enough to be regarded merely as different aspects of the same divinity arising naturally from the transformation of a cosmic into a political or semi-political legend."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"3o THOTH IN THE LEGENDS OF OSIRIS AND BORIS. in the Osirian legend. Here the contending parties are out lined with a considerable amount of distinctness, \\vhereas the chief feature of Osiris is his vagueness and elusiveness. In the older form of the legend there is question mainly of the apparent defeat of the powers of light in time of eclipse of sun or moon, during the waning of the moon, at the setting of the sun, during the advance of darkling storm-clouds. The men of primitive times had puzzled over these cosmic events, and had sought to find their causes. For the ancient Egyptians the light which shone in sun and moon was thought of as the flashing of two eyes - the eyes of heaven. The god of heaven they called Hor - thinking of heaven, perhaps, as a great face (), with sun and moon as its two eyes.(i) When day passed into night, when the sudden storm burst, and, possibly, when the clouds were marshalled in the skies, the Egyptians thought of all this as the work of a power which was hostile to light. This power was regarded as evil and at some early period was identified with a local storm-god called Set. It is not possible to reconstruct all the features of the ancient legend. When we first meet it, it is no longer merely cosmic. It has been added to, and modified by priestly spe culation and popular fancy, so that the primitive myth of a conflict between light and darkness has become the story of an unceasing struggle between two adversaries half-human, half-divine. Myths tend, of course, to develop in this manner. The popular mind seeks naturally to transform the divinities of its legends into beings partly, at least, of flesh and blood, and to express cosmic events in the language of human history. Hence in the developed anthropomorphic form of the Horus- legend we find historico-political motifs which have nothing to do with the primitive saga. Interwoven with the saga arc many features that recall incidents of the struggles bet ween Upper and Lower Egypt in the pre-dynastic period. Details of all kinds have been added to the legend to give it a reasonable human aspect, and thus it is somewhat diffi cult, at times, to determine what is purely cosmic, and what is merely anthropomorphic in the story.

Set is the foe of Horus, as well as of Osiris. ]t is difficult to decide whether Set displays similar qualities in both legends. A fully satisfactory explanation of the origin of Set s cult, and of his connection with Osiris and Horus in the primitive period has not yet been discovered. It is possible that the similarity in name, and possibly, identity in personality of the Osirian Set with the enemy of the sun-god Horus, is largely responsible for the confusion of the Osirian legend with that of Horus. (11 The Osirian drama has supplied many features to the legend of Horus so many that it is often uncertain whether a par ticular text deals with a conflict between Osiris and Set, or with a struggle between Horus and Set. And it -is equally clear, on the other hand, that features of the Horus-legend have passed over into that of Osiris. It must be left to other inquirers to disentangle fully the two sets of myths. The task of determining Thoth s role in either is complicated by the general confusion as to the borrowings of both. The great importance of sun-worship in ancient Egypt may be inferred from the comparatively large number of centres of sun-cult which existed there. There was, for instance, the ancient shrine of the winged sun-disc in Edfu, where the glories of the rising sun were worshipped ; then there was the primitive shrine of the sun-god at Heliopolis, and there were other centres of sun worship at Thebes and Memphis. The god of these shrines was, certainly, not Horus the son of Isis. (2) Even before the cult of Osiris began to spread (i) Cf. Meyer. Seth-Typlum. p. 19. Plutarch (Is. ct (). 55; 51 ct /\\7.v.v.) describes Typhon (Set) as a destructive being. As a primeval storm-god, or god of the weather. Set could, obviously, be at once the foe of a vegetation-god and ot a god of light, of Osiris and Horus. As n weather-god Set would naturally be widely worshipped in the early period. Several Egyptian terms which refer to the phenomena of storms are determined by the symbol of Set. It is clear from several passages in the Pyr. texts that Set was not regarded in the ancient period merely as a malicious being. The detestation with which he was later regarded was due to the growth of legend, and, probably, in no small measure, to the growth of the legends of Osiris and Horus. 1,2) Haroeris the falcon-headed war-god had a very great number of cult- centres in ancient Kgypt.

There is no reason for thinking that the different sagas of the sun-god had any connection primitively with the saga of Osiris. In the beginning Haroeris was rather the god of heaven than the sun-god : sun and moon were indeed the eyes of Horus. But so fickle is po pular fancy that the god of heaven became identified at an early period with the greater eye of heaven, and his original character was almost forgotten. The role of Thoth in the different stages of the legend seems to be intrinsic and necessary to the saga. In the very ancient form of the legend, where the chief motif is the cosmic struggle between Horus and Set, Thoth acts as friend and protector -of Horus, and of his eye. To this activity of Thoth may be referred the Pyramid passages (Pyr. 594 597) which tell how the eye of Horus separated from its owner, was found by Thoth as it wandered on the further shore of the lake A K and was carried back to Horus on the ibis-wings of Thoth. With all this should be compared the Pyramid texts, 947, 976, 1176. iSy;, 1429.11) The eye of Horus which Thoth cares for is, to judge by the literature of the later period, the left eye the moon. The disappearance of the moon in eclipse and in the interval before the appearance of the new moon was a cause of anxiety to the Kgyptians and to other ancient ill Compare the strange passage Pyr. 174-, where the eye of Horus is borne on the wing of Set.

In one form of the legend it is Horus himself who seeks and brings back his eve ; but according to Pyr. 97&amp;lt;&amp;gt; the eye of Horus is carried on the wings of Thoth &quot;on the east side of the divine ladder&quot;. The legend of the flight of the eye and its return is obviously similar in many respects to the legends of the Destroying Kye of Re, of the angry eye which became the serpent on the diadem of the sun-god, of Onuris who fetched the divine lioness from the eastern desert, and of Hathor of Byblos. All these legends are intricately interwoven so much so. indeed, that it is often difficult to decide to which of them a parti cular feature or motif primitively belongs. Thoth is certainly associated primitively with the astral legend of the moon-eye that vanished and was found again. The primitive astral myth contains no suggestion of an angry eye of Horus. Thoth s function as pacifier of the eye is connected with the more reflective legend of the Kye as Serpent on the crown of Horus (in which Sechmet appears as the Eye in her form MAT./, and Thoth is the ship HAT./)."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"TROTH IN THE LKGENDS OF OSIRIS AND HORUS. 33 peoples, (i) To explain this disappearance, probably, the Egyptians devised the idea of a flight of the eye of Horus from its owner. The aim of the flight would be to escape the hostility of Set, and the exile of the eye would continue as long^ as there was a possibility that Horus might be overcome by Set. During its absence the eye was naturally under the protection of the moon-god Thoth. To Thoth also would fall the task of bringing back the eye to Horus when the season of danger was past. The place of the eye s sojourn, and the fashion of Thoth s care for it are variously described in the texts. In one prominent set of texts the eye is spoken of as having fled over a lake called Nh! (2) which is located in the eastern side of the heavens. On the shore of this lake Thoth is said to have found the eye, and to have brought it back to Horus, bearing it across the lake NM on his ibis- wings. In many texts, particularly those of the Ritual, it is implied that Thoth had to make a long search for the eye before he found it; in other texts it is insinuated- that the eye came of itself to the moon-god, as if seeking his pro tection.

The bringing- back to Horus of his Eye by Thoth has brought the latter into connection with several Egyptian legends of the Eye of Horus. It is thus that he has been associated with the legend of the angry Eye of Horus which refused to be reconciled with its lord. In this legend the angry eye becomes identified with the goddess Sechmct in her character as nsr-t and Thoth s function in her regard is shtp nsr-t, the pacifi cation of the nsr-t. In somewhat similar fashion Thoth has been brought into relation with the legend of Onuris. The name of this god Ini hri-t, &quot;He who brings the one that was far away&quot;, refers probably to the bringing to Egypt from the mountain lands of the eastern deserts of a goddess in leonine form who was forced or induced to leave her desert home by an ancient battle-god in lion or falcon form. This ancient god was Horus the warrior-god who, because he brought to Egypt the stranger goddess received the epithet Ini hri-t (Onuris) - : He that fetches her that was far away&quot;. Later this Hri.t came to be identified with the wdt-t and Ini hri-t was explained as &quot;He that brings the Eye that was far away&quot;.

It is only, indeed, in passages in which Set appears as a criminal in regard to the eye of Horus, that we can be sure that we have to do with the Set of the ancient legend of Horus. It is interesting to note how the two legends that of Osiris, and that of Horus- Set are, at times, in the same context interwoven, and yet held apart. In the myth of Horus which Naville has published the struggles of -Horus of the Horizon&quot; (= the ancient battle- god of Edfu), and those of Harsiesis against Set are narrated as if they were aspects of a single campaign.

The descriptions of Set and his companions, the leagued enemies of Horus of the Horizon, throughout the myth, suggest frequently those enemies of Re which are symbolised by the Apophis-serpent. The whole text furnishes a remarkable instance of the inter weaving of legends in Egyptian speculation, and of the ab sence of all sharp distinctions in Egyptian thought. Plutarch tells of a great lawsuit between Horus and Set which was conducted in presence of the gods. (2) The Horus in the case is the son of Isis.

Yet the Egyptian texts seem rather to speak of a lawsuit about the due apportioning of Kgypt between Horus and Set. (i) The point of legitimacy is not raised, and the texts in question are partly, at least, echoes of the early wars. The calendar of the Papyrus Sallier (IV, 9. 5 6) tells us that the result of the lawsuit in question was, that to Horus was assigned all Egypt, and to Set the desert ; Thoth, as the scribe of the gods, published the sentence. (2) It is probable, how ever, that the divine verdict was thought of differently in the earliest period. In the older tradition Set must have been assigned a portion of Egypt itself. In an ancient version of the legend it was Geb, and not Thoth, who reconciled Horus and Set. Egypt was indeed the &quot;inheritance of Geb&quot;, tor he was Lord of its soil, and to him, therefore, belonged the first right to assign the land of Egypt to various rulers. That Geb made the division of Egypt between Horus and Set is implied in the Shabaka text. (3) We are told in this an cient text that Geb, having brought to a close the strife bet ween the rivals, gives the South to Set and the North to Horus.

A remarkable Pyr. text (128) identifies Thoth and Re (i. e. moon and sun) with the Rhwi, and tells how Set (here, apparently, still a venerable deity) escaped from their hostility.

This is true, for instance, in Pyr. 478, and in those ancient texts in which he cooperates with Horus for the benefit of Osiris. As god of Ombos Set is often as kind, and as helpful as any other deity. (6) He often appears as a friend of Horus. (7) It is ob vious, then, that the three divinities Horus, Set and Thoth do not appear always in three distinct roles in ancient Egyp tian theology. Their characters are not always self-consistent, and, in the ancient legends they are represented as variously as the backgrounds of those legends required. As theology developed, and political situations changed, Set came to be, less and less, the mere god of Ombos, and, more and more, the symbol of evil. He is gradually excluded from the ritual, and ritual honours and functions which had been his arc gradually handed over to Thoth.

When, through political and religious change, Set became &quot;Lord of the desert&quot; he naturally fell out of the ritual of coronation. His place was taken by Thoth. In 50 lists of divinities collected by Schenke (Amon-Ra, p. 124 127) Thoth appears eleven times, Set eighteen times. When we look closer at these lists we find that Set has been forced out of his place seven times by Thoth, twice by Anubis, and eight times by Horus. In the primitive forms of these lists Thoth would, then, have appeared only four times, and Set would have appeared thirty five times. Schenke thinks that the exclusion of Set began in the XVIIIth Dynasty. Doubtless, political reasons had much to do with it. Set s unpopularity seems to be con nected somehow with the occupation of Northern Egypt by the Hyksos ; and the great number of Thoth-names to be found among the rulers of the XVIIIth Dynasty, suggests that the cult of Thoth was important in the movement which shook off the domination of the Hyksos. Horus and Set, the gods of the &quot;Two Lands&quot; which made up Egypt, were necessarily the chief figures in the early ritual of coronation. When Set \\vas excluded, his phice was naturally taken by the constant companion of Horus (== Sun-god), the moon-god Thoth, the Lord of sacred ceremonial. We may here bring together briefly the results of our inquiry into the position of Thoth in the legends of Osiris and Horus. 1. Thoth has no place in the primitive saga of the ve getation-god, Osiris. 2. In the developed, anthropomorphic, form of that saga Thoth is an important dramatis persona. His place in the drama is due partly to his own primitive character, and, partly, to the proximity of Thoth s shrine in the Delta to the home of the Osirian legend. The main features of Thoth s character in the legend seem to be largely individual and peculiar to him out of all relation with the Osirian religion. But there is no need to deny that the activity of Thoth in the Osirian drama may have helped to define his character more clearly for the people, and to extend his worship throughout Egypt. 3.

This office naturally belonged to him as a primitive moon- god. A deity protective of light was a necessary figure in the ancient sun-saga of Egypt. 4. In its developed form the Horus-legend has become entangled with the Osirian story. Thoth here appears either as arbitrator between two political rivals, Horus and Set, or as the active partisan and ally of one of the two. The texts which represent Thoth as an ally of Horus seem to be strongly influenced by the saga of Re and the Apophis. Features from the legend of Osiris and Set are also here present. The po sition of Thoth is further described in this developed and complex form of the legend of Horus as that of a judge in a suit between Horus and Set (as in the Pyramid texts), or as that of an advocate defending Horus in the case (so Plu tarch), or as that of a wise friend of the contending parties who seeks to reconcile them. Here, as in the older form of the Horus-legend, Thoth still appears at times as an astral deity : and sometimes he seems to represent a political power, allied, at one time with llorus, and at another, with Set, in the pre-dynastic battles of Egypt, (i ) (i) The position of Thoth in the various legends that centre round the Kye nl Horus is described and explained in a manner differing greatly from that of the text in Junker s remarkable book, Die Omirislegende (Wien, 1017).

Thoth and the Enneads of Heliopolis. The theology of the Pyramid texts is largely the product of a fusion of local cults with the theology of Osiris. Of those local cults the most important is that of the ancient solar shrine, Heliopolis. In the theology of Heliopolis itself we can trace clearly the inweaving of the Osirian saga with the local worship of Re-Atum. This inweaving appears most obviously, perhaps, in the Heliopolitan lists of the great gods, and, especially, in the list which is known as the Great Ennead of Heliopolis. In this list Osiris himself appears as a member of the family of the Heliopolitan sun-god, and Isis and Set appear with him in the same group. Further, we find that incidents of the Osirian drama have come to be lo calised in Heliopolis. This is true, for instance, of the great trial in which Osiris is declared victorious by the gods, (i) In Heliopolis the court is held : and it is the Heliopolitan gods who declare Osiris &quot;triumphant&quot;. At times it would seem as if Osiris had become a sun-god at Heliopolis, just as he became ffltl^f^ in Abydos. In the Pyramid texts the dead king, conceived as Osiris, is often represented in the guise of Osiris. It is to be noted that Haroeris has no place in the ancient Heliopolitan Ennead. (2) He was himself a sun- god, and did not need a place in the Ennead of a foreign solar shrine : In being he was really identical with Re-Atum. (1) As suggested above, this trial is a late development of the Osirian story. For apparent references in the Pyramid texts to the trial see Pyr. 956960, and cf. Pyr. 3i6 3i8 and Pyr. 1521 1523. (2) Plutarch puts the birth of the &quot;ancient Horus&quot; before that of the gods of the Osirian cycle. Horus was a heaven-god prior to becoming a sungod. Whether the ancient war-god in falcon shape was primitively a heaven-god or sun-god is not certain : he also was called Horus. Possibly there is here the iden tification of a local war-god with the heaven-god or sun-god. Thoth. the Hermes of Egypt."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"5 o THOTH AND THE ENNEADS OF HELIOPOLIS. We have now to consider the relation of Thoth to the Heliopolitan deities. Many attempts have been made to discover the primitive nucleus of the Heliopolitan Ennead. Schenke(i) regards that nucleus as consisting of the sun-god with Shu, Tefenet, Geb, Nut, Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Horus. Assuming that we have in Heliopolis an Ennead resulting from a combination of Osi- rian and Heliopolitan theologies, the Ennead would be : Sun-god Shu Tefenet Geb Nut Osiris, Isis, Set, Nephthys. Horus would have here no place - - except, of course, in so far as he might be identical with the sun-god himself. Thoth is not included in the list. (2 ) His appearance in the &quot;Little Ennead&quot; of Heliopolis is of no great importance except as illustrating the supplementing tendencies of Egyptian theology. The deities who appear in the Ennead (apart from Re-Atum) do not appear there as local deities. They have been quite removed from the surroundings of their local cults. Osiris is here no longer the god of Dedu or Abydos ; Set is no longer the local deity of Ombos. On the other hand, the ancient deities who are not included in the Great Ennead are more tenacious of their local individuality at the time when the Great Ennead was first devised. This is particularly true of Thoth. He retains his connection with a particular local shrine much longer than the Osirian gods of the older Ennead. It is possible, and perhaps likely, that the Enneadic grouping was not a primitive feature of Heliopolitan theology. It has been maintained recently by Capart (3) that the group ing of deities in primitive Heliopolis was ogdoadic. He bases his view on the Pyramid text 3 17, and endeavours to show that the primitive grouping in Heliopolis was one of four (1) Amon-Ra, p. 123 f. (2) Was Thoth a figure in Osirian drama before the assimilation of Osirian cult with that of Heliopolis &amp;gt; It is interesting to note that Pyramid lists of the gods which begin with Osiris and Set do not, as a rule, include Thoth.

Pyr. 3 17 sug gests, according to Capart, this grouping: Tefen - Tefenet Nu - Nut Osiris - - Isis Re - Nephthys. Above the eight, but in a transcendence which excluded him from being grouped with them, stood the local god, Atum. We know that an arrangement of this kind existed in Thoth s city Hmnn&amp;gt;, the -City of the Eight&quot; ; and Capart suspects that the Heliopolitan Ogdoad was formed under the influence of the ancient Eight of Hmnw. (i) If this view of Capart were to be^ accepted, then not merely Horus, Anubis, and Thoth, but Shu, Set, and Geb would be excluded from the most ancient Heliopolitan grouping of gods. Capart has, further, endeavoured to show how his postulated Ogdoad has deve loped into the Ennead of the Pyramid texts. His theory is ingenious . Re was identified, in the course of time, with Atum, and in the place of Re thus vacated was put Set ( another solar god, according to Capart). The god of heaven, Nu, was next replaced by the earth-god Geb. Shu, as the son of Re, must follow Re immediately : thus he takes the place of Tefen. The resulting Ennead would be : Re (== Atum) Shu (instead of Tefen) - Tefenet. Geb (instead of Nu) - Nut. Osiris - Isis. Set (instead of Re) Nephthys. The transcendence of Atum having disappeared by his identi fication with Re, the Ogdoad necessarily became an Ennead. (2) (1) There seems to have been variety of opinion in K gypt as to the first pair of emanations from the sun-god. They could be Shu-Tefenet ; Tefen-Tefenet, Hu-Sia, or flike-Sia, or Heart-Tongue (= Thoth-Horus). Cf. PSBA, vol. 38, P. 92 f. In the fusion of theologies this variety afterwards led to strange identifi cations. Some of these will be discussed later. The possibility that Shu, in certain aspects, might be somehow identified with Hu, Hike, and Thoth would easily lead to the passing of influences to and fro between Heliopolis and Hmunu. Note that in the &quot;grosser&quot; theories the first two emanations are male and female: in the more intellectual&quot; theories the two first emanations might be male (or sexless).

The contrary view, that the Ogdoad of Hermopolis is due to the influence of Heliopolis, and that the Ennead is primitive in the latter shrine, is older and more popular. Maspero has collected the evidence for it. (i) We are inter ested in the general question only in so far as it affects Thoth s position among the ancient gods. In the general obscurity of the problem one thing is clear - - that Thoth does not stand in the ancient groupings of gods in any family relationship to the gods of Heliopolis. This supports the view already put forward that Thoth is not primitively connected \\vith the Osirian legend. Yet, on the other hand, Thoth s re lations with the Heliopolitan Great Ennead are close and that, even in very ancient texts. His relations with the chief god of Heliopolis - - Re-Aturn - - are, as we shall see, especially intimate. It may be that the inclusion of Thoth in the Lesser Ennead, and his close connection with the gods of the Greater Ennead other than Re-Atum, are somehow conditioned by his assumption as a persona into the more developed form of the Osirian drama. The Book of the Dead has made us familiar with the idea of a trial of Osiris held before the gods of Heliopolis. (2) The same trial seems to be referred to in the Pyramid texts, (3) and every student of Egyptian theology knows how the idea of this trial dominates the entire religious speculation of Egypt. The precise points at issue in the trial cannot be ascertained. In the result Osiris was declared .JH, and was made one of the divine judges. He even became the president of the court. There is, obviously, much confusion of thought here. Possibly the whole story of the trial was elaborated to show that Osiris, as Prince, or Greatest, of the Dead, was subjected to the trial after death which every mortal must endure; in all directions Osiris should serve as the model of all men. Every man of Egypt besought for himself from the gods the verdict which Osiris had obtained. In the trial of Osiris some of the Temple&quot; and &quot;Lady of the Temple&quot;) is very hypothetical. Instead of build ing up a new theory on Pyr. 3 17, it would be much more reasonable to suppose that Tefen in that text is simply an epithet of Shu, the son of Re. (1) Rec., vol. 24, p. 169!&quot;.

Against this charge, apparently, Osiris was brilliantly defended by Thoth, so that the latter received for himself the title &quot;He who made Osiris victorious against his foes.&quot; We find Thoth active in still another great lawsuit pleaded before the Ennead in Heliopolis. The parties are here Horus and Set, and the trial is held in the Hall of the Two Ma ets. (i) It is to this lawsuit, probably, that Plutarch refers when he speaks of the successful pleading of the ad vocate Hermes (Thoth) on behalf of Horus against Set. The details of the divine lawsuits in which Thoth was en gaged were thought out after the model of the high courts in Egypt. It has thus come about that several of Thoth s most frequently recurring epithets are connected with features of legal practice in Ancient Egypt. It will help, not merely to explain the development of Thoth s cult, but also to il lustrate the methods of Egyptian speculation in religion, to indicate here some of the titles which were devised for Thoth because of his work in defence of Osiris and Horus before the Ennead of Heliopolis. a) In the lawsuits in presence of the gods Thoth ap parently acted as secretary of the court, and recorder of its V O Q C~\\ ^ o-==* verdict.

But it docs seem clear in the titles quoted in the text that ma ct means more than truth&quot; : the word seems to have a forensic sense, something like &quot;^, which itself stands close to &quot; &amp;lt;1 ~^. Ma et can be done as well as spoken. Ma ct, in the sense of &quot;just&quot; (TO o(/.a .ov), is an appropriate name for a fair verdict. Ma et appears often as goddess of justice and hence the officials of Ancient Egypt often bear the title &quot;priest of ma et&quot;. The higher law-officers advertised their loyalty to ma et by wearing an image or amulet of the goddess (cf. Cairo \\Vb. no. 7 3 where an official speaks of wearing on his breast a figure of ma et). \\Ve may assume that, for the Egyptians, as for our selves, that which is legally prescribed is, at least in theory, the just and fair. Hence to carry out what is legally prescribed is to accomplish ma et, to fulfil all the ritual laws in the divine cult would be a particularly perfect performance of ma ct. As including what is prescribed for cult ma et would correspond to ritiis (ritus sacrijicionon, ritus sacnficii : cf. ~TS n:j) = what is of precept, and to 0:7;xo; (particularly if determined by Osfo: or soo :). Ma et can also include what is truthful in word or expression, since men can claim true speech from their fellows. Since the forensic reference is sufficiently clear in ma et, it is natural that the great court in Heliopolis should stand under the patronage of the two ma cts (cf. Pyr. 3 17). Possibly the two ma cts symbolise the union of N. and S. Egypt under a single Supreme Court. It is possible, however, too, that the dual in the case merely symbolises the ideal fairness of the justice administered in Heliopolis. In this sense of intensified fairness the dual is used as a singular in the votive in- .cription of Ahvdos ^^^ hath reached unto heaven (line 61/62). (2) Cf.

As the details of the legendary trials of Osiris and Horus belong to the early period, it is likely that the legal epithets of Thoth which arose out of his connection with those trials, were drawn from the traditional legal procedure of Ancient Egypt. We find, in fact, in the texts of the Old and Middle Kingdoms abun dance of legal titles analogous to those of Thoth, ascribed to important personages in the State. We have seen that the court in which the trial of Osiris was held, and in which also, probably, the case between Horus and Set was tried, was the Great Hall of Heliopolis - probably the Supreme Court of Ancient Egypt. In the texts of the Old Kingdom the Supreme Court is called the D3d1-t n&amp;gt;r&amp;gt;t, (3) and the court in which Osiris was tried is called by the same name in the Book of the Dead (Totb. 18, 3).

Thoth is looked on as an official of the Ennead in the same way as an ancient Egyptian dignitary would have been an official of the Pharaoh, (i) Very probably, then, the great trial of Osiris, and the details connected with it, were modelled largely on the legal customs of ancient Egypt. Even in the later periods of Egyp tian religion we find this method of constructing the divine on the analogy of every day civil life in Egypt still steadily at work. We can see this from such epithets of Thoth as &amp;lt;c=&amp;gt; -2Jn given to him in the Graeco-Roman period (Edfu -r^JKi&amp;gt; a J/ld R. II, 78; 80).

Thoth and Re in the Solar barque. Thoth, as has been shown, stands with other ancient deities, such as Ptah, Min, Hr ;rr, Neit Anubis etc., outside the primitive Ennead of Heliopolis. Yet it cannot be denied that there are very close relationships expressed, even in very early texts, between Thoth and the Heliopolitan sun-god. In the Book of the Dead of the N. K. period Thoth often appears as secretary of Re (or of Osiris, thought of as sun-god) ; and he constantly appears with the sun-god in the solar barque (i) - - generally accompanied by Ma c et. Thoth is therefore a companion of the chief god of Egypt, wlierf the latter goes on his administrative journeys. It is not un likely that the Pyramid texts which speak of a &quot;ScriSe^ of the divine book at the right of Re&quot; refer to the presence and function of Thoth in the solar barque. The Pap. Harris, I, 6 8, refers to the &quot;writings of //wmr~the accountant of Re- Horus of the horizon&quot;.

(2) This is implied also in Pyr. 490 491, according to which the dead king becomes the Dhli in the prow of Re s ship who seals the decrees of Re, sends out Re s messengers, and does in general as he is ordered to do. Pyr. 267 268 transforms the king into &quot;Sia (the bearer of the divine book) at the right hand of Re&quot;. (3) It may, probably, be assumed that the bearer of the divine book is one witli the scribe of that book. But who is Sia ?

The mean ing of snk is not clear, but the whole passage recalls Pyramid texts like 962 and 963, where Thoth beheads the king s ene mies, and cuts out their hearts (cf. Pyr. 1999). In the late periods there is no doubt about the identity of Sia and Thoth Sia being freely used in the Greek period as a name of Thoth. Further, the &quot;Scribe of the divine book&quot; is also clearly (1) Cf. the prayer Totb. 94, I 4 (Nav.) for ink-bottle and palette for the dead. The dead is to be equipped as a scribe.

Since we find that in many Pyramid texts (i) the dead is identified with Thoth, and since the identity of Sia and Thoth in the later periods makes pro bable their identity also in the early texts, we need scarcely hesitate to take the scribe whom the dead displaces in Pyr. 955 as Thoth. The idea of the &quot;divine book&quot; seems to have been bor rowed from the methods of government administration in Kgypt. Just as the Pharaoh received reports from his mi nisters and various officials, and just as the details of all ad ministrative work in Egypt were carefully recorded, so must the king of the world, the sun-god, have official reports, and official records. (2) Thoth, as the friend, and trustworthy minister and scribe of Re, kept for him the great book of government (the &quot;divine book&quot;) in which every detail of Re s empire, and its administration would be carefully noted. (3) The book would not be primarily a &quot;Doomsbook&quot;, or &quot;Book of fate&quot;, but only an institution belonging to the practical side of Re s world-government.

In the Greek period Thoth s presence in the solar barque is looked upon mainly as intended for the protection of Re against his enemies. With this function of Thoth is connected his title Great in magic in the barque of millions&quot; (Totb. 182, 8). The title suggests the power of Thoth s magic as against the Apophis, and other foes of the sun-god. The Book of the Apophis (Brit.

The story brings Thoth into close connection with the moon, and is probably a genuine echo of the Egyptian spe culation which regarded Thoth as primarily a lunar god. In Egyptian texts Thoth s relationship with the moon appears to be of two kinds. In a great number of texts he is represented as being practically one with the astral body_ - with the moon itself.

We have already discussed the Pyramid passages which speak of Sia, the bearer, and, probably, the scribe, of the divine book at the right hand of Re. It is very likely that Sia is here, as elsewhere often, identical with Thoth. The &quot;right hand of Re&quot; would be the natural position of honour for the second of the great astral deities, and it is reasonable, therefore, perhaps, to assume that Sia is one with the moon, as well as with Thoth. We saw above that the text of the Book of the Dead (Nav., 178, 20) which describes Thoth as the moon that traverses the sky, is directly paralleled in Pyr. i3o.

K., his identification with the moon-god must be regarded as one of the oldest features of Kgyptian theology. The Pyr. text i3o, already referred to, is the clearest ancient statement of Thoth s identity with iouh, the moon: -U. If Re is the sun, Thoth must be the moon. The remark able text Pyr. 128 points in the same direction : The &quot;wayfarers of heaven&quot; are Re and Thoth as sun and moon (cf. Cairo, 20520).

In all such passages Thoth appears rather as the guardian of, than as one with, the moon.

Considered merely as the eyes of Heaven, sun and moon were to the Kgyptian of divine substance, but they were not gods. Hence they might require the help or care of some personal deity. The two eyes of heaven are often called wdl-t, a term which expresses the perfection of their bright splendour. Hut, in the majority of texts, and practically in all the texts of the Graeco-Roman period, jrdl-t is the name of the left rye, the moon. (Y) After the days of waning, disappearance, reappearance, and re-growth, the moon could well be described as the jrdl-t - the healthy, or sound, eye. After the perils of eclipse, the moon would come forth again perfect and brilliant, &quot;heiilthj-&quot; as before.

And hence to the left eye, rather than to the right, was given the name n dlt. In the incidents of the Horus-Set legend we have seen Thoth playing the role of defender of light against darkness. In this role, as we have seen, Thoth brings back to Horus the eye of the latter, which had been injured b^ Set. Most of the Pyramid texts which refer to this function of Thoth, speak of the eye brought back as the left eye of Horus, / . i-., the moon. There are, however, a number of ancient texts in which a rescue of the right eye of Horus by Thoth, is spoken of. (i &amp;gt; These texts belong to the circle of thought which has pro duced the numerous legends of the sun-god. The 17 th chapter of the Book of the Dead is the most familiar collection of such legends. In those of them in which Thoth appears, he acts, very naturally, as friend and protector of the powers of light against their foes. The right eye is not always represented as being brought back by Thoth to Horus : it seems often to return of itself and Thoth s function towards it is a some what unintelligible one of soothing it when it finds a rival established in its place, and, finally, resetting it on the face of Horus.

When Thoth brings back to its owner the left eye, or moon, he does not bring it back as a raging serpent (like the solar eye), but as a &quot;healthy&quot;, or &quot;convalescent&quot; eye. Egyptian literature delights to recur to the relations of Thoth towards the left eye of heaven. With constant repeti tion it tells how Thoth sought out the eye, and finding it ailing, probably, as a result of violence inflicted by Set, healed it, and then, on the day of full moon, delivered it up to it s owner in the fulness of its splendour, (i) Through his healing of the eye Thoth acquired his title &quot;Physician of the eye of Horus&quot; (Pap. Hearst, XIV, 5 7). We are told that the eye was cured by the application of Thoth s spittle (Book of Dead 17, 33: 167, 3), - - a detail of the legend derived, obviously, from the naive medicine&quot; of the people. It is possible that Thoth s position in the later period as patron of physicians may be due to the legend of his healing of the moon-eye ; but it is equally possible that this activity of Thoth in the legend may itself be due to the general popular conception of the god. Many of Thoth s familiar epithets are derived from his protective relation to the moon. He it is &quot;who seeks the H-ifi-/-eye for its lord&quot; (Berlin. P. 3055, col. 8, 9): and he it is also &quot;who makes full the eye&quot; : he is, further, the &quot;ba that fills the Eye&quot; (Champollion, Traraux sur Ic ritucl &amp;gt;. 157). Erom this latter function arises his name (Philae : Birth-House, Phot. 978), determined by and for those in particular who would wish to supplement the information supplied by the present study on Thoth and the deities with whom he is most often associated. The angry eve which is at length pacified bv Thoth. and set on the forehead of Horus is apparently the serpent of the Kgyptian diadem. The angrv eye which is pacified and restored to its own original place is a motif that belongs i&amp;lt;&amp;gt; the Nubian legend of Hathor (Telenet i, to the legend of Onuris who brought the goddess-lioness from the eastern desert to Kgypt, and to the legend of the beautiful goddess, Hathor of Byblos, the heroine of the Papyrus d Orbiney. Thoth s function of bringing back the moon-eye to Horus has brought him into connection with these other legends and also with the legend of Hathor as destroying Kye of the sun-god. i I ) Thoth is spoken of also as having avenged the Kye of Horus.

The worship of moon-god was inevitable in ancient Egypt, and the identification of the moon-god with a local divinity, such as Thoth may have been, was quite parallel with what happened in the case of the sun-god. This identi fication, however, had the very natural result that while, on tin- one hand Thoth was regarded as completely one with the moon-god in heaven, his reality as a local deity living in a well-known Egyptian centre would not be forgotten. Hence the need of detaching him from the moon, so far, at least, as to make him the guardian and protector of the Sacred Eye of llorus.

It may be said, however, that we have sufficient evidence to show that the moon had a formal worship of its own in the Old Kingdom. It is reasonable to assume that the worship of the moon, like solar worship, was universal in Egypt in the earliest period. It may be also assumed that, as the sun-god came to be identified with a number of local deities, - - appearing thus, as Atum, Ptah, Horus, Am on etc., without losing his own individuality as the sun-god, Re, so also the moon-god was identified with deities of local shrines at a very early period without losing his own special character of moon-god, fooh. One such deity was the ibis-god of the 15 th. Delta nome. Another was the ancient god Chonsu of Thebes. Both the Ibis-god and Chons appear as lunar deities in the M. K., though they have then as yet no other features in common. In the oldest texts Chons is simply the moon - - the Wanderer&quot;, as his name implies, (i) Thoth, on the other hand, though certainly a lunar deity in the older period, is also, even then, much more than merely a moon-god. His character, even in the earliest period, shows considerable complexity. The easiest explanation of the fact of Thoth s double relation to the moon is to assume that we have in his case an ancient identification of the moon-god with a local deity of pronounced individuality.

The symbols of Thoth. The most familiar symbols of Thoth are the ibis and the ape. Sometimes the god appears simply as an ibis or as an ape : sometimes as an ibis-headed, or an ape-headed man. It is difficult to decide whether his ibis-symbolism or his ape- character is the more primitive. The evidence seems to point to the predominance of the ibis symbolism in the earliest period. This symbolism fits in best with the Pyramid ritual which makes the ibis-god carry the Kye of Horus, or the soul of Pharaoh over the seas of heaven. The ape-symbolism seems of itself, to have had less to do with the lunar and funerary functions of Thoth - - for the ape was connected in some way, with the rising sun, and had nothing to do in Kgypt with the rule of a psychopompos. ( i) The presence of an ape on the balance in the Judgment-Scene is a secondary feature. In the later periods, it is true, Thoth is often repre sented as a moon-god in his ape-form. But these is no trace of this kind of representation prior to the N. K. The lunar ape of the late period is, of course, a product of the identi fication of the ibis-god, already regarded as a moon-god, with the ape-god. It may be that the ape-symbolism gives expression to fundamental features of Thoth s character which have no relation to his role as moon-god.

Note, however, the presence of the kfilnw and the bnti apes in the /// sbkt : Diim. Hist. In. II. 57 d.

Later, the popular fancy which attributed peculiar knowledge and astuteness to the apes will have tended to invest the ibis-headed god of wisdom with the ape-symbolism. Hut this is little more than mere conjecture. It is to be noted that, though the ape-god is often represented as presiding, as it were, over the work of scribes, he is not usually shown as equipped with writing materials, or as himself engaged in writing."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"THK SYMBOLS OF THOTH. 77 Even if it were possible to decide whether Thoth was more primitively ibis or ape, it would still be necessary to explain how he came to be represented in these forms. In the Pyramid texts, and in all texts of the O. K., Thoth appears as an ibis. We find, however, in the O. K. period statuettes and other representations of dog-headed apes which may, possibly, symbolise Thoth. ( i) If we knew the precise origin and meaning of the name ^j , we should, perhaps, be able to decide whether ibis or ape is the more primitive as symbol of Thoth, and we might then also be able to say why Thoth was thought of under a particular form. If the name Thoth meant as has been conjectured, &quot;the god of ibis-form&quot;, (2) we should infer, that the ibis was the more ancient and charac teristic symbol. It might then also, perhaps, be inferred that the primitive god of the 15 th Delta nome was an; ibis, and that a sort of crude animal worship anciently prevailed there. But if, as was conjectured above, Dchuti is simply = &quot;the one from Dehut&quot;, the doubt must remain whether the ibis-symbol stands for a sound-value, or indicates the actual &quot;physical&quot; appearance of the god. In the midst of such uncertainty it is idle to set up theories of a totemistic worship of Thoth in the Delta of the prehistoric period. Neither can we say with certainty that the symbolism of the ape is secondary in regard to the nature and cult of Thoth. ( 3 ) (1) See Petrie, Researches in Sinai, p. 123. pi. 127; Abrdos II, pi. 9. (If. Benedite, Scribe et babouin (Paris, 1911), p. 22 tV. Bene dite maintains that the Hermopolitan ape-god does not begin to appear in art before the Thinite period. He doubts, however, whether the early ape- figures of Hieraconpolis and Abydos are really symbols of the god Thoth : The dog-headed apes of the 3 rd Dynasty tombs at Medum and in the mastabas of the Memphite period are not. according to Benedite, representations of the ape-god, Thoth, but rather represen tations of an animal which, because it was not native to Kgypt, and had to be fetched from a great distance, had become a, sort of exotic plaything for the members of Pharaoh s household, and for the high nobilitv of the early period. Benedite is inclined to think that the splendid statue of an ape shown on p. 29 of his work, which is assigned by an inscription to the age of Snofru, really belongs to that period, and is one of the earliest representations of the sacred ape of Thoth (ibid. p. 29 f.

If it is to be assumed, as has been suggested, that a local deity of the i5th nome of the Delta, who was pictured as an ibis, was subsequently identified with the moon-god, we can discover various grounds for the identification of an ibis-god with the moon-god. Krman (Rel., p. ID ) ascribes thr transformation of the moon into an ibis to popular fancy which noticed the resemblance of the curved beak of the ibis to the sickle-crescent of the moon. In the later periods of Kgyptian speculation all kind of explanations of current reli gious symbols were devised. One of these finds an echo in Plutarch when he says (/.v. et (). 75, 8) that the mixture of white and black in the plumage of the ibis remends one of the waning moon, i i) It may be, too, that the Egyptians saw in the dignified flight and pose of the ibis, something of the majesty of the moon as it fared across the skies, or looked down silently on men.

When the two luminaries appeared at the same time in the sky Thoth s light was but a weak reflection of the glory of Re. Thus all apparent difficulties were solved. The Egyptian did not feel any sense of incongruity in legarding the same divinity as. at once, the lunar disc in the sky, an ibis-god &amp;lt;&amp;gt;r ape-god on earth, a guardian of the &quot;Eye of Horns&quot;, a companion of Re in the &quot;Barque of millions&quot;, and a minister and counsellor of Re in the government of the world.

The special functions of Thoth as lunar divinity. The general aspects of Thoth s r61e as moon-god have been already considered. It now remains to show in some detail how the notion of Thoth s lunar being worked out in concrete details. The ancient Egyptians were an agricultural people. They were interested, therefore, in setting up an exact calendar. The moon would naturally play a chief part in fixing the details of the calendar. The easily observed regularity of the moon s phases furnished a better basis for marking off periods of time than the variations of solar phenomena. Hence at a very early period in Egypt, as elsewhere, the moon was taken as the chief measurer of time. This importance of the moon is expressed very clearly in the later Egyptian texts : it is obvious enough also in the earlier texts. The Great Oasis text (Brugsch, 16, 3334) states the time-delimiting work of the moon very clearly. Of it is said that it is : Mf , Moon in the night, ruler of the stars, who distinguishes seasons, months and years : (i) he cometh ever-living, rising and setting.&quot; In the same text (1. 3off.) the left eye of the sun-god is said &quot;to distinguish seasons, months, and years&quot; (2) It is the (1) Of Genesis I, 14. 16.

We have already examined some of the most obvious lunar functions of Thoth. A great many other activities are ascribed to him which may also -- but not with equal cer tainty, belong to him as moon-god. Among these may be suitably considered here his activities in the organisation of various departments of civil and religious life. In a country in which, as in Egypt, the daily life of the people was largely ordered by reference to the phases of the moon, it was more or less inevitable that the moon-god should come to be looked on as the ordering principle of civil and religious life. The easily noted regularity of the moon s phases gave the moon a necessary predominance in fixing the date of the chief feasts in the temples, and of the chief events of the Egyptian civil year. This will have given a special impor tance to the early and general spread of moon-cult throughout Egypt ; and with the growth of lunar cult must have gone on equally the growth of the cult of the moon-god Thoth. It is not strange, then, to find that Thoth is described, at an early period, as the founder of the cult carried on in the temples as the originator of divine sacrificial worship, and as the author of all order in the State. Though, however, these important aspects of Thoth s activity may be largely due to his role as moon-god, it would be a mistake to infer that Thoth was for the Egyptian wholly or essentially a lunar divinity. The gods of Egypt can seldom, indeed, be described in a single formula. Et is possible that Thoth s association with the origin of civil and religious institutions is due only by accident, or secondarily, to his lunar character.

The same idea seems to find expression in Egyptian texts when Thoth is spoken of as &quot;he whose words have established the Two Lands&quot; (Tntb. Nav. 182, 4). A similar idea lies behind several of Thoth s epithets : c. g. JlM^I ra ^|| - &quot; the most ancient Legislator&quot; (Stele of Tutankhamen 1. 29, Rec., 29, 166, cf.

In the Ptolemaic texts he is snin hpir &quot;he that establishes laws&quot;. &quot;Establishing laws like the Lord of Hsr /. ( = Thoth)&quot;, is a constantly recurring epithet of the Pharaohs in the Graeco- Roman period. From the time of the N. K., then, Thoth was regarded as the source of law, and, therefore, as the founder of the social order, (i) We are not told, as a rule, whether Thoth was regarded as the author of special classes of laws. He is simply &quot;Lord of laws&quot;. Yet most of the legislation which is directly referred to him in the texts deals with cult. It is as author of the institutions of temple-worship that we find Thoth engaged so often in the building and furnish ing of shrines of all kinds. (2) We see him often with the architect-goddess Seshat measuring&quot; the sites of future temples. He did not content himself, however, with marking off sites : the erection, internal arrangement, and decoration of the temples were regarded as designed by him. It was usual for Egyptian shrines to boast of their complete conformity with the plans and prescriptions of Thoth. This is true particularly of the shrines of the later periods.

Thus it would seem as if Thoth were regarded as the framer of the rules of ecclesiastical architecture, and of temple-decoration in ge neral. Thoth was the first who set down in writing the laws of sacred architecture: Ptah was the Builder who executed the plans devised by Thoth.

Maxims of Anu (beg.): Pap. Hood, 1. 12. (2) ft is an interesting point that Seshat, the goddess of script, is often as sociated with Thoth in all matters dealing with sacred architecture. This implies that there was nothing casual, nothing left to the inspiration of individual architects in the designing of Egyptian temples. It may be noted here, also, that the Egyptian was conscious of no essential distinction between the pictorial decoration of the walls of tombs and temples, and the hieroglyphic script which went along with it.

K. quoted in the preceding paragraph the &quot;Divine words&quot; seem to be something other than mere script : they are carefully distinguished from the U (== the written sign, script), and seem to be what is conveyed or expressed by the written signs, rather than the signs themselves. It is a familiar idea of ancient Egyptian literature that the mere recital of the formulae of funerary offerings was sufficient to supply the dead with all the objects named in the formulae. Thus the words of such formulae might be regarded as possessing a magical efficacy of a creative kind. They could call into being that which they signified or named. It is not unreasonable, perhaps, to conjecture that this magical or creative effect of ritual formulae is expressed by calling such formulae i as in the M. K. texts above) mdn r ntr. Mdir suggests rather the spoken word than the written symbol, (i) Hence, when Thoth is called &quot;Lord of the mdw ntr his lordship over spoken words, rather than over script, is expressed. In his familiar epithet I^\\&amp;lt;c=| ! (Of. Mariette, Karnak, 16, Jr *^^ L v Thutmosis III) he who hath given word and script-sign&quot; the word (md)i ) is clearly distinguished from the written symbol (drf}. (2) Even though mdw ntr does mean &quot;hieroglyphs&quot; in the Graeco-Roman period, it may not always have had that mean ing. There is no lack of other words to express &quot;hieroglyph&quot; in Egyptian. The most familiar of those terms is drf, or better, &quot;drf of Thoth&quot;. An expert in hieroglyphics is &quot;he who knows the drf of Thoth&quot; (Berlin &amp;gt;3 16: XVIIIth Dyn.). &quot;Hieroglyphics&quot;, (1) Mdw = to speak: cf. MOyTC.

Thus the distinction between the script and what was expressed by it could be made with sufficient clearness in Egyptian. We hear also of &quot;books of the Divine Words&quot; (Totb., c. 170, 5X 1 &quot;) - which, obviously, cannot be &quot;books written in hieroglyphics&quot; merely, for in what other script could books of the time be written ? The title implies rather that such books contained collections of specially effective formulae. The Book of the Dead speaks (c. 68, 910) of a journey which Hathor made to Heliopolis &quot;bearing the writings of the Words (u1)r), the Book ofThoth&quot;. This &quot;Book&quot; can hardly be other than a collection of sacred formulae ascribed to Thoth as author. The title &quot;President of the mysteries of the Divine words&quot; which we find in the early period, (2) can scarcely mean &quot;overseer of hieroglyphs&quot; : it seems to point, as Schaefer says, (3) to the bearers &quot;special knowledge of script and li terature, and, above all, of sacred literature&quot;. (4) The mdn 1 ntr were, then, primarily not signs but words - words, above all, spoken by the gods (as in Pyr. 2047), but then, also, all such words or formulae as bore in themselves a divine, or creative, efficiency. Of such kind were the for mulae of sacred ritual. These formulae are technically known as mdw. Every ritual phrase of importance is prefaced with ~^ &quot;Recitation of the ;;/c/;j &quot;, as a stereotyped rubric. The Book of the Dead (c. 17, 3i puts this rubric more solemnly, Jipr mdit: &quot;the mdiv takes place&quot;. Pyr. 333 c. seems clearly to identity the &quot;Divine words&quot; with the effective or productive &quot;word&quot; of the liturgy, when it says : v~&amp;gt; &amp;lt;S^-^ M/WNA q I | (i) &quot;Thoth himself comes to tlice with \\ I I I&quot; where Q | I I I o I U I the &quot;words arc. apparently, the formulae ot the funerary service.

Possibly, indeed, indn 1 ntr may have meant &quot;magic formulae 7 even before it was employed as a designation for formulae connected with divine worship. In very ancient texts we find mdw ntr brought into connection both with ritual and magic. Thus in a tomb-inscription of the M. K. (Louvre C. 14) the deceased says : &quot;I knew 7 the mysteries of the Divine words, the celebration of the Heb-sed feasts, and every kind of hike : no one surpassed me therein . Hence Thoth s epithet &quot;Lord of the Divine words&quot; im plies his lordship over the formulae of ritual and cult. That lordship implies, again, that to Thoth was assigned the duty of superintending the celebration of ritual ceremonial, and that in Thoth w^as found the source of all such mysterious power as was contained in charms, and spells, and all invocations of the gods. There is abundant evidence in the texts that to Thoth was assigned the authorship of the forms of cult.

Even the incense was carefully prepared, we are told in the Sethos- temple in Abydos, &quot;according to the writings of Thoth which are in the library&quot;, / . c., according to the rules laid down in the* rituals of the temple. We may assume that the details of cult-ceremonial were ascribed to the authorship of Thoth, though it is only rarely that this is directly implied in the texts. (2) But it is evident that his closest connection with ritual is through his role as master of potent words, as &quot;Lord of the divine words&quot;. The ordering of the details of cult will have belonged to him as the orderer of things in general, in the Temples, as well as in the State- ; and his function as order-bringer is, probably, to be connected with his character as moon-god. Yet, it must be noted that the ancient moon-god, Chons, was not regarded in the early period as a founder of cult or ritual. It is only later, when Chons is brought into close connection with Thoth, that he is associated with the origin and celebration of cult- ritual. It is possible, then, that Thoth s association with ritual may have been primitively due to non-lunar aspects of his character. The being of Thoth is not reducible to, or derivable from, a single formula. The double symbolism ibis and ape - points to a fundamental complexity in his nature. It might be conjectured, perhaps, that the symbol of the ibis points (i&amp;gt; Vid. Mar.. Daui, I. 50 b ; and cf. von Lemtn. Ritualbuch dcx Amon- JieHstes. p. 64. (2) Cf., for instance, Ttitb.

But, even if we were to assume that ape and ibis show us the god of wisdom and the moon-god respectively, other problems remain. How deduce, for instance, Thoth s function as funerary god from ibis-symbolism, or from ape- symbolism alone, or from both together ?

The Pyramid texts, as has been seen, represent Thoth as the minister and as the scribe of Re, the sun-god. It has been conjectured above that this peculiar association of Thoth and Re may be due, in part at least, to the circumstance that the two greatest heavenly bodies, the rulers of the daily and nightly heavens, were inevitably put into a close official relationship in the primitive theologising of Egypt. In this official relationship, the moon-god would, of course, be sub ordinate to the sun-god, but would be immediately next to him in rank. As Re was thought of as an imperial ruler after the fashion of the Pharaoh, so the &quot;silver sun&quot;, the substitute for, and representative of, the sun-god was naturally looked on as Re s chief minister, or vice-gerent in the government of the world. To rule the world as chief minister of Re, Thoth would require a high degree of intelligence, and a great range of knowledge. Yet the position would not demand any mar vellous po\\ver of insight, or mysterious depths of knowledge. If, then, we find, as we do, in the Pyramids, that ancient texts ascribe to Thoth a peculiar power of knowledge as com pared with other gods, we need not look on this as necessarily derived from his role as lunar vice-gerent of Re. It will be more probable that any gift or power of special gnosis which the texts ascribe to Thoth belongs to him out of all connection with the world-government of Re, belongs to him, that is, in his own right. We have learned something already about Thoth s activity in the construction and furnishing of temples, and in the daily performance of the ritual in the shrines of Egypt. The power of Thoth as lunar deity to delimit men s lives, and to determine the course of their careers, has been also discussed.

To him is assigned the invention of language and script. He is regarded as^ the patron of the sciences, He can read the secrets of jnen s hearts. He is the &quot;one who knows&quot; (i) in every direction. In the end he comes to be looked on as Understanding (or Reason) itself, personified.. We shall here look rapidly through the texts for evidence on these points. a) Invention of script, language and literature. One of the very common epithets of Thoth is who hath given words and script&quot; (cf. Nav., Totb. c. 182, 3 f . etc. : Berlin 2293, XIX th Dyn.). The texts of the late period are particu larly clear as to his invention of writing (Pap. Hearst VI, gf. : Ebers i, 8 10). The script of funerary tablets is called the &quot;drf of Thoth&quot; (Berlin 7 3i6, XVIIIth Dyn.). Drf means primarily legible signs, the separate characters in script : but it sometimes means &quot;writing&quot; in the sense of documents or texts (cf. Mar., Dend. Ill, 72 a), and, in this further sense of the word, Thoth was also regarded as lord of script. One of his most widely used epithets is nb ssl, &quot;Lord of writing&quot;. All kinds of texts books, temple-inscriptions, collections of liturgical documents (&quot;rituals&quot;), inscriptions on stelae, and tablets were called ffii /%. \\ y s \\v&amp;gt; Parallel with the title &quot;Lord of script&quot; goes another familiar title of Thoth \\&amp;lt;^ &quot;Lord of books&quot; (Mar., Dend.

Apparently it was in his ape-form mainly that he received this veneration. We have an interesting illustration of this in the fact that in the scribes department of the Egyptian government-offices was set up a figure of the ape-g-od. (2) The scribal profession was, of course, one of the most highly respected of all in Egypt. It was respected, partly because of the comparative ease and pleasantness of the scribe s life, but, mainly, because the power of setting down records in script suggested to the common mind the possession by the scribe of mysterious and potent knowledge. Hence, as lord of the scribes, Thoth was regarded as the lord of all knowledge, and, peculiarly, as lord of all recondite and mysterious knowledge. He was the &quot;knower&quot; v.x~.* ::y/,v.

It is a deification parallel to that of Seeing-, and Hearing, (i) and Utterance = Hu\\ It may be said here, in general, that Sia is in no sense a Logos or Nous thought of as an emanation from, or as a self-manifestation of. a primitive divinity. This is indeed simply to say that Egyptian ideas must not be misrepresented in a Greek, or other non-Kgyptian, method of exposition. The very existence, however, of a god of Understanding in Egyptian theology inevitably raises questions of parallelism and dependence as between Egypt and the Hellenistic world in matters of philosophical theology. Some of these questions suggest themselves in the course of this study : but here already the general principle must be laid down that Egyptian conceptions must be studied as exclusively as possible from the native Egyptian point of view. That Sia is, at times, identical with Thoth we have seen. Yet the latter is often enumerated along with Sia as a distinct divinity. To Sia and to Hu is assigned a special manner of origin which marks both of them off from Thoth. The lyth ch. of the Book of the Dead (Xav. 17, 28 ff.) represents them as sprung from a drop of blood which issued from the phallus Re. This legend of their origin reminds one of the ma terialistic creation-story connected with Shu and Tefenet. And there are indications that the story is but a crass form of a myth which represented Understanding and Utterance as the first potencies which sprang- from Re, by the help of which Re then proceeded to build up the world. (2) As we shall see later, Thoth and Horus were regarded, at least in one important ancient school of Egyptian philosophy, as the two first creations of Re ; so that there is good reason in Egyptian for bringing Thoth into close connection with Sia and Hu. The distinction of Thoth from both Sia and Hu, and the close relation in which he stands with them are illustrated by the frequent appearances of the three divinities together n the same context. At times it seems as if the three divi- t. the hymns of Isis and Nephthys. I ap. Brit.

There can be no doubt that the Egyptians looked on Sia as a separate and independent deity, but it is, by no means easy to determine how clearly his individuality was realised. He seems to have had a character easily identified with that of other deities. Whenever it was necessary to emphasise the special wisdom of any god, it could be done most simply by identifying that god with Sia. Thus, of Amon it is said in the Leyden hymn (Leyden I, 350; 6 [== R s.], i 2j : &quot;All countenances are turned towards him : men and gods say / TA, he is Sia&quot;. Similarly it is said of Horus cq 1 &quot;thou knowest bodies even when no tongue doth ^ I move, in this thy name Sia&quot;. (2) Sia was, indeed, so abstract a divinity that he could be thus easily assimilated to other divinities and to none more easily than to Thoth, the most mysteriously wise and prudent of the gods. Though Sia is at different times, identified with very various gods, he is identified far more frequently with Thoth than with any other. Throughout the huge body of texts of the Graeco-Roman period the identification of Thoth with Sia is so frequent that Sia is simply a second name of Thoth. Particularly is this the case in the ritual scenes in which the figure of Ma et is presented by the Pharaoh to the deity who is being honoured. In nearly all these scenes Thoth is called Sia, and the king who presents Ma et is styled &quot;son of Sia&quot;, or &quot;likeness of Sia&quot; apparently because he takes the place of Thoth in the ritual action. In the Ptolemaic texts Sia is very frequently deter mined with the ibis-headed god, thus, $ (Mar., Dcnd. II, (1) Totb. M. K. 17. I.epsius, A. / ., I, 162, 17. Cf. Mission. I. 168. (2) Cf. Ps. 1 3 9 ,4-"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"106 THOTH THE ALL-KNOWING. 52 b, yib). Sometimes the identity of Sia with Thoth is ex pressed in an epithet, as, \\\\ &quot;Sia Lord of Hermopolis&quot; i^Mar., Dcnd. I, 68 a). As the presence of Ma et in the barque of Re symbolises the fairness and justice of the sun-god s rule, so also, in the ritual scenes in which the Pharaoh offers to the god an image of Ma et, it is implied that the rule of the Pharaoh is just and fair, like that of Re. When the king offers Ma et as if he were Thoth, and is called Sin, or &quot;Likeness of Sia&quot;, it is claimed implicitly by him that he is. in his life generally, and in the due performance of ritual particularly, a veritable Thoth, whose every action is an expression of Sia or Reason. It must not be supposed, however, that in the deification of Sia. and in his identification with Thoth, there is any subtle metaphysics. Sia is merely a personification of understanding or perception : he is not a Logos in the sense of a self- revelation of a primitive deity. The reason, or perception, or understanding of any god might be thus personified, - - and not merely the understanding of a primitive deity. It was natural, and indeed inevitable, that the intelligence of Thoth, the wisest of the gods, should be more frequently personified than the understanding of other divinities, fi) As god of literature, and of science, of theology, and of ritual, as the fountain and source of all knowledge and wisdom, Thoth, &quot;the knowing one&quot;, would, most easily of the gods, come to be fused witli Sia. But there is no deep methaphysics in the fusion. Thoth, simply as Sia, is not to be regarded as a world- ruling Nous in the Stoic sense. How far a conception analog ous to the Stoic Logos was possible to Egyptian thought will be seen in the following chapter. (i) How simply other divinities could be identified with Sia may be gathered, tor instance, from the Edfu text quoted above, p. 105, R. II, 15, where it is said of Horus : &quot;Thou knowest bodies without the movement of a tongue, in thy name Sia."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Chapter XII. Thoth as Creator. Egyptian theology does not show, in general, any clear tendency towards system. The great mass of religious texts in Egypt is marked by vagueness and even inconsistency. Individual gods are very rarely clear and well-defined per sonalities. Indeed, it is a feature of Egyptian theology that nearly every one of its gods is capable, in one way or another, of being fused with others. This fusion takes place, usually, as a result of the popularising of cults over wide areas, (i) In the earliest period each district was under the almost ex clusive patronage of the local deity : but, as the intercommuni cations of the various districts became in course of time more intense, and as one or other dynasty or district became specially powerful in the political life of Egypt, or, as certain cults, of their nature universal, or, at least, national, became more prominent, fusions of all kinds took place among the Egyptian gods. The local cult of each district generally showed itself ready to identify its god with the more powerful and popular god of a wider area. Thus, it might happen that a god like Re, or Atum, or Ptah could be identified with practi cally every divinity in Egypt. And when fusion of local deities with gods of wider influence had taken place all over the country, it was easy, as a next step, to interfuse the local divinities with each other. We must not, therefore, be surprised to find that local gods of apparently slight importance, often appear decorated with the titles of the great cosmic deities, or that these great cosmic deities often appear to be particularly related to some local cult. The case of Set, who, from being a local god - probably a storm-god - - was raised to the rank of enemy- (i) Such popularising was, in many cases, the direct or indirect result of political movements."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"loS THOTH AS CREATOR. in-chief of the powers of light, has been already mentioned. The existence of solar divinities with varying attributes in different, and often widely separated districts pf Ancient Egypt, is, probably, due also to the fusion of local cults with cults of their nature more widely known. The policy of identifying the divinities of local cults with the greater gods of Egypt, led to this, also, as suggested above, that each local god could assume the qualities, and activities of any or all of the great cosmic creative divinities. In this way any local god might become, through the ambition or zeal of his priests and worshippers, the primitive god, the creator of the world. Not only was there much fusion in Egypt of local gods with the cosmic deities, but the latter also tended to become interfused with each other. It is not strange, therefore, to find that Thoth, who stands forth among the great ancient gods as the wise and learned one, should appear as a wise cre ator, or as a sort of demiurgic Reason, or Logos. This may be due to the familiar tendency, just mentioned, to attribute to the god of a local shrine the activities of a primitive divinity. It might, of course, on the other hand, be the product of a genuinely speculative turn of ancient thought, taking Thoth, or Reason, as a creatively active mode of appearance of the primitive deity - - a turn of thought similar to that which excogitated the Demiurgic Nous of (ireek speculation. It is well known that the solar theology of Heliopolis, and the religion of Osiris dominated the theological specu lations of Egyptian priests at all periods familiar to us through texts and monuments. The Osirian cult and the Heliopolitan theology appear, in most of our texts, as inseparably con nected. The main speculative and systematic elements which appear in their fusion, are due, probably, to the solar theo logy. The dramatic factors are supplied by the cult of Osiris. Solar theology secured, at an early period, predominance in Egyptian thought, and retained it throughout the whole course of Egyptian history, (i) Each of the ancient centres of I l) The fact that it was the solar theology of Heliopolis, rather than that of any other ancient solar centre, that secured predominance in Ancient Kgypt is most probably to be accounted for by the political preponderance of Heliopolis at a very early period."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"THOTH AS CREATOR. 109 sun-worship had, however, its own peculiar system of theology. This was probably due, as has been suggested above, to the presence in each shrine of features derived from local (possibly non-solar) cults. But there was, of course, something common in all the local theories of solar theology. In all of them, so far as we can see, the speculation of the great primitive shrine and centre of sun-worship at Heliopolis made itself strongly felt at an early period. In each centre of sun-worship, the deity of the place, transformed into a copy of the Heliopolitan Re or Atum, appeared as the primitive deity, as creator ; and in each centre there was a special local theory of creation. Yet, so influential throughout the land was the theology of Heliopolis, that the creation-legends of Atum s shrine are reflected in most of the local cosmogonic systems. And this is true, not merely of local cults of which the sun-god was the deity, but also even of districts where a moon-god ap pears as chief divinity as, for instance, Hmnn , the &quot;City of the Eight&quot;. Even in this lunar centre we find traces of a solar theology, particularly in connection with creation. In deed there is much evidence to show that some of the most important details of the Heliopolitan story of creation were localised in Hmnw. (i) It cannot surprise us, therefore, if we find in Egyptian theology, not merely a close connection bet ween the speculations of Heliopolis and those of Hmnn , but even an attempt to fuse them systematically. Tn the theology of Heliopolis the great gods&quot; were the offspring of the primitive god. The gods of heaven and earth and air and water, the Nile-god who made Egypt fertile, and the unfriendly divinities who devastated the land with drought. and burning glow, and storm - - all should be, at Heliopolis, the children of the local god Re-Atum. This is so far true (i) Gf. Nav., Boo A* of Dead, c. 17, 4 5 : c. 64, 8 9 : c. 5. In the text of the Great Oasis (Brugsch, 26, 22 23) the scene of Amon s becoming is the Height , of Htntnv. So in the Ptolemaic inscriptions of Bab el-Abd, Karnak, there is a reference to the Eight il who created light in the &amp;lt;- Height&quot; [of Hmtnv] and took their place in Hermopolis with their father, the venerable one [Spsi == Thoth]&quot;. If the oldest creation-legends connected with the sun-god, are associated with Thoth s city, we must not be surprised to find that Thoth is identified, in some forms of speculation, with the first creation of Re (see below, p. H5ff.). In certain forms of the creation-legend it would seem as if the kli of Hermopolis was the place where Shu made distinction between earth and heaven. Cf. Totb.. c. 17."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"no THOTH AS CREATOR. that the Ennead of Heliopolis presents a sort of summary of cosmological teaching-. The gods of the Ennead are the gods of earth and heaven, and their grouping is indicative, to some extent, of the Heliopolitan view of creation. In the first great group of Nine Thoth does not find a place, and it is clear that his presence in the second Nine is due merely to systematisation. Excluded, then, from the first Ennead Thoth is excluded from the old Heliopolitan theogony and cosmogony. Other ancient gods are also omitted from the great Ennead of Heliopolis. One of these is Ptah. And yet it is to be noted that Ptah himself at a very early period, if not primitively, was a solar deity at Memphis. It is clear, then, that some of the most important of the older gods of Egypt were not included among the gods honoured in the shrine of Re-Atum. Yet we find that attempts were made at a very early period to bring both Thoth and Ptah into con nection with the creation-theories of Heliopolis. One of the most interesting documents of Egyptian theology deals directly with the problem of reconciling and interweaving the creation- theologies of Heliopolis and Memphis, and incidentally also with the relations between Thoth and the Heliopolitan Ennead. Hie document in question is the so-called Shabaka u-xt. i i ) It is so important for the study of Thoth s cult that it must be here summarised and discussed. The chief aim of the text is to depict Ptah, the local god of Memphis who presided over the guilds of stone-cutters and sculptors of ancient clays in Memphis, as the first of the gods, and the creator of all things. In order to find a place for other gods and other theologies, while still asserting the preeminence of Ptah, the other important gods of Egypt, in cluding Thoth and the Heliopolitan deities, are explained to be mere manifestations of Ptah. From the primitive god Ptah there issued eight emanations. These are so many different forms of Ptah, and constitute with him a Memphitic Ennead. In the next place we are told that Ptah and the Heliopolitan god Atum, are one, or, more precisely, that the creative activity of Atum is really a function of Ptah. Since the whole (ij Published in a critical cd. bv Erman. ilin Dcnkmal mcmphitischer 7 heulogie. Sitzungsb. d. p. Akad. i*&amp;gt;i i."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"THOTH AS CREATOR. in creative activity of Atum is but a function, or energy, of Ptah, each creative aspect or element of Atum must be, in some way, a form or manifestation of Ptah. Now all the members of Atum are to be regarded as creative. Among the organs of Atum his heart and his tongue are the most important, for it was by these that the gods were created. Atum is Ptah, and Ptah must create, like the sculptor that he is, by drawing forth plans from the treasure-house of his heart, and giving them effect by the command of his tongue. Thus the heart and tongue of Atum become, in the Memphitic theology, forms of the artist-god, Ptah. With the heart and tongue of Atum the text identifies the gods Thoth and Horus respectively. These two gods constitute together one of the eight primitive forms, or emanations of Memphitic Ptah. The other seven forms are then shown to be identical with other organs of Atum. Whatever, then, the Heliopolitan god Atum, the world-creator, thinks, speaks, or executes, is thought, spoken and accomplished by one or more of the eight primi tive forms or manifestations of Ptah. It follows that the gods who, in Heliopolitan belief, sprang from the mouth of Atum, viz. Shu and Tefenet, in reality sprang from Ptah. The old Heliopolitan legend told how certain gods were brought into being from the glands and hands of Atum ; (i) but, since the various members and organs of Atum are really forms of Ptah, it follows that the Heliopolitan gods, generally, have taken their being, in, truth, not from Atum, but from Ptah of Memphis. As in Heliopolis, so in Memphis, the primitive god is thought &quot;of as creating first of all other divinities, who then, in turn, create all other beings in the universe. The divinities first created here are Thoth and Horus, the heart and tongue of Ptah. (2) By the thought ofPtah s heart, and the utterance of his word were called into being Atum and his Ennead (Horus and Thoth standing, therefore, here also, outside the (1) Gf. Pyr. 1248. Gf.

The next product of the heart and tongue of Ptah is the 1 1 - - so that, not only the gods, but the &quot;divine words&quot; were created by Thoth and Horus. (i) It is to be noted that the heart (= Thoth), and the tongue ( = Horus) are not here conceived as two independent deities, but as a single form or emanation of Ptah. It is only in Atum that they are sundered - - as separate organs of that god. It is obvious that the creative activity of Ptah, exercised, as here described, through thought and command (= Thoth-Horus : Sia-Hu), is just such activity as would befit the head of a school of sculpture. In the ancient commentary which is attached to the text (2) Thoth recognises that Ptah, the &quot;creator of the gods&quot;, is &quot;greater in power than the gods&quot;. It was Ptah who founded every city and nome : it was he who built the temples, and set up the statues of the gods therein. The text assigns the earliest stages of the Osirian legend to Memphis - - possibly 1 in order to claim for Memphis the beginnings of ritual, or possibly, because Horus appears in this theology as a form of Ptah. The whole aim of the quaint text seems to be to set forth the theology of Heliopolis in a Memphitic form, and it serves well, therefore, to illustrate the tendency, already described, to assimilate the theologies of different shrines. For our purpose- it has the special value that it helps us to give a reasonably full answer to the question raised in the preceding chapter as to the possibility of conceiving the Egyptian Thoth as a sort of demiurgic Nous in the Hellenistic sense. (3) The text obviously represents Thoth as an organ, or faculty, of Atum - - not as a manifestation of that god. He is a form of Ptah, also, but only in the same sense in which Horus and the other deities are forms of the god viz. as a member or organ of Atum. Thoth is not set apart from the other deities in such a way as would imply a special philo- (\\ ) It is right to call attention here to the statement of Philo of Byblos (recorded in Kusebius, l*raep. er.

IX 3 sophy, or Logos-theory dealing with him. When Thoth is described as the heart of Atum, the outlook implied is like that of the Hymn to Amon of Leyden (J, 850. Recto 5, 15 17): &quot;His heart is Sia : his lips are Hu : all that exists is what is in his mouth&quot;, (i) The style of the Memphitic text is norm ally Egyptian. Ptah is the primitive deity : the other gods are, therefore, his members and organs. Thoth is simply the think ing heart, just as Horus is the commanding tongue of Ptah. Of Ptah, as of Amon, an Egyptian poet might have said : &quot;His heart is Sia (=. Thoth) : his lips (= tongue) are Hu (== Horus)&quot;. In making Thoth the thinking faculty of the primitive deity the Memphitic text does not, therefore, necessarily speak of a creative Logos or Nous. The text, indeed, does not make Thoth the heart of Ptah, but only the heart of Atum, and Thoth is connected with the heart of Atum just as the other gods are associated with the less noble organs of that deity. The identification of Thoth and Horus, as the first creative form of Ptah, with the thinking and commanding faculties of Atum obviously implies the theory of a creation by command ; but there is just as clearly implied in the text the more crude and materialistic kind of creation which was carried out by the glands and hands of Atum. It would be a mistake, there fore, to look for a genuine anticipation of Stoicism, or for any form of systematic philosophical thinking in the Sha- baka text. Since the text is as ancient as the Old Kingdom, the idea of Thoth as the heart of the solar deity must belong to a very early period of speculation. The idea occurs with striking frequency in the later literature of Egypt. Though in the Shabaka text Horus appears as the tongue of Atum, in the course of time he gives up this honour to Thoth, so that the latter appears both as heart and as tongue of the (i) Cf. same hymn I, 350, recto 4, where it is said: &quot;Amon arose from the ocean.

An echo of the Shabaka text is to be found perhaps in Diimichen, Geogr. luschriftcn II, 42 where Thoth is called &quot;Heart of Re, mighty in his words&quot; - where the reference to creation by command seems to be- fairly evident.

There are some indications that the epithet &quot;Heart of Re&quot;, so often assigned to Thoth, gave rise to much specu lation in the Greek period.

It contains an attempt, obviously, to explain the im portance of the ibis-god by a reference to his origin. That origin is shown to be closely connected with the origin of the sun-god himself. This is not strange, since, as is well known, the scene of several Egyptian creation-legends was laid in or near the &quot;City of the Eight . But the point of special interest peculiar to this text is its preoccupation with the familiar epithet of the ibis-god - &quot;Heart of Re&quot;. Here again we have clear echoes of the theology of the Shabaka text, tor here 1 nn (=- Ptah ) is again chief creator, and the Eight are described as &quot;sculptured (== &quot;Ptah-formed&quot;) in Memphis ; and here again, the heart and tongue of the chief god are the instrument of creation generally.

The spirit of the text connects it more closely with Thebes than with Helio- polis, but, after all, Amon of Thebes is a form of Re. In this legend Thoth appears as the first-begotten of Re. This relation of Thoth to the sun-god is suggested also by a number of familiar epithets of our god, such as, &quot;eldest child of Re&quot; (Metternich Stela 244), &quot;the great one, the eldest child of Re&quot; &amp;lt; Edfu R.

As first-born of the gods Thoth came to be regarded as creator of all that became subsequently to himself. A very natural extension of this creative activity made him creator of himself, so that he is sometimes called &quot;self-caused&quot; or &quot;self-begotten&quot; (ftl 01-^1 Turin Pap. P. and R. 25, 3 6). 1.4) In the Shabaka text&quot; we have already seen him functioning as a creator, but there he functions as creator only as a form of Ptah, and not, as it were, in his own right. But, just as many of the local deities of Ancient Egypt were revered as creators, and were not regarded as being sufficiently dignified without that activity, Thoth of Hermopolis also became a world-fashioner on his own account, and a rival of Atum.

But Thoth was neither ram, nor sculptor, nor potter, and could not create like any of these. The Shabaka text, and the many other texts above referred to, give us an idea of the peculiar kind of creation which was carried out by Thoth. He created as the heart of Atum, or of Re, and as the tongue of the sun-god which commanded thoughts into being. His special mode of creative work is creation by utterance. In the Thoth of later Egyptian speculation the aspects of thought and utterance which appear sundered in the Shabaka text are brought together into their natural unity. Eor the Egyptian the knowledge and power of the scribe were mysterious, for the scribe-, like a god, &quot;brought into being what was not .as Pyr. 1146 a, c says of the scribe of the divine book) : hence of Thoth, the chief scribe, it is said: C2 7r* r w (1 ^ - 7 - 1 & *~=^ D O I ~ D I &quot;what comes from his heart, at once takes place&quot; (Brugsch, / lies.

(2) That speech possesses creative efficiency is a genuinely oriental notion. Among the Semites the far-reaching power of the formula of blessing or of cursing, and the deep importance of the name, are well-known. It is therefore quite oriental and Egyptian to suppose that a word can summon a thing into being, or banish it into nothingness. The writer of the Shabaka text gives us clearly enough to understand how he conceives of creation through speech or utterance. He says : &quot;When the eyes see, the ears hear, and the nose inspires breath, they convey that to the heart : that (viz. the heart) it is which causes every decision to go forth, and the tongue it is which pronounces what the heart has thought. It (the tongue) fashioned (thus) all the gods, and the Ennead : (3) and every divine word also came into being through what the heart conceived, and the tongue commanded&quot; (op. cit. p. 989 f.). Thus, even the ancient period associated with Thoth s creative action the idea of a production by thought and utterance, by Sia, if we wish to express it so, and II u. It is important to note how, in the Shabaka text, the gods are first produced in this way, and then the &quot;divine words&quot;, /. e. probably all such formulae as were themselves endowed with a productive or creative power.

If Thoth is a creator, like other deities, in his own right, and after his o\\vn fashion, why is he so constantly spoken of as creating in his role of &quot;Heart of Re&quot; ? This seems to make him subordinate, as a creator, to the sun-god. It is possible, however, that this is due chiefly, or solely, to an attempt to fuse the theologies of Heliopolis and Hermopolis, to an attempt, that is, to equate the god of Hermopolis with the sun-god Re. Thoth himself as creator, out of all contact with Re, was a creator who worked like the scribe and philosopher, by thought, and by the power of productive speech. If, then, the attempt were made by a priest of Hermopolis to show that Thoth and Re are but different forms of a single deity, either deity must become a form or manifestation of the other. Obviously the thinker, Thoth, could more easily become a manifestation of Re than manifest himself through Re. Besides, Thoth, as moon-god, was already a substitute for, or repre sentative of Re. Vet in the fusion of the gods Thoth must not be made interior to Re. The problem was solved, on the one hand, by transferring Thoth s creation-activity to Re, and, on the other, by identifying the thought-principle of Re, the root-principle of creation, with Thoth. This is what we actually tind in the strange Kdfu text quoted above : it is also what is implied in calling Thoth &quot;Heart of Re&quot;. Thoth is conceived as the first product of Re s thought, but he is also, the thinking faculty itself of Re. Further, the thought-act of Re s heart by which Thoth is produced, is, at the same time, an act of the god who is the Heart of Re&quot;. Thus Thoth is, in every sense, self-begotten. It would be wrong, however, to see here any deep meta physics. There is really nothing here of a Stoic, or Philonic Logos. There is nothing more here, in fact, than the natural result of an Egyptian tendency to equate or fuse the theolo gical theories of different cult-centres. Apart from Re, Thoth takes place on earth. He is the throat of Jinn-rnf. Chons, the great god in Kdfu.&quot; Again (R.I. 2~5) Chons is &quot;the heart of He which knows all things, the tongue of Tnn which understands every thing.&quot; The theory of creation by utterance, as held in Kgypt, has often been dis cussed.

His word has power to call things into being. It is little wonder, then, to find him endowed with great magical powers. Magic presupposes always a special Gnosis. The magi cian claims to possess a higher and deeper knowledge than others, a knowledge of the secret nature of things, and of the hidden connections which hold things together. He is the wise one who knows the real names of things, the one whose words have power to control mysterious forces, and to ward off invisible perils. And the magician does all this by the power of his special gnosis, and without any appeal to physical strength. Thoth, as the wisest of the gods, became for the Egyp tian, of necessity, a magician. We saw above that Thoth stands in closest relation with temples and cult. Between the prayer of worship, and the formula of the magician there was a striking similarity. Ritual and magic stood near each other in the ancient religions. Thoth, therefore, as lord of ritual, became also inevitably, lord of magic. Again, we have seen that Thoth was the skilled physician who healed the damaged eye of Horus, and that he was the patron of physicians gene rally. Magic and medicine were, at one time, but different names for the same science. Thoth, as physician, was thus, already skilled in magic. Finally, the priests and physicians were of the learned professions, of &quot;those wo know&quot;, and Thoth, as the knowing one par excellence, could not fail to become the patron of both professions, and, therefore, a magi cian equipped with all possible knowledge of the worlds of gods, demons, and men.

The funerary cere-"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"THOTH IN MAGIC;. 125 monies for the dead king, which occupy the major part of these texts, consist largely of descriptions of magical acts, and the formulae which accompany them. The magic formulae of the Pyramid texts are already so ancient as to be stereo typed, and it is clear that the scribes who have handed on the Pyramid texts often had no clear idea of the sense of the ceremonial formulae which these texts contain. Some of the formulae transmitted in the Pyramid texts had, already in the Old Kingdom, become so unintelligible, that the scribes, in certain cases, add to them a commentary. It is clear, there fore, that a tradition of magic rites and formulae had already become fixed in the Old Kingdom. The question arises, then, whether we can find traces of Thoth s connection with magic in the earliest period of Egyptian literature. In the later periods this connection is clear. \\Vc can, therefore, most conveniently begin with the later period in order then to reacli back, it possible, to the oldest texts.

It is, therefore, possible that the name c=^p5r(2) might be- intended to identify Thoth with the ancient god Hike. It is also, of course, possible, in the abstract, to regard the god Hike of the O.

To make clear the function of Thoth as a magician \\\\c must here examine briefly the applications of the term hike as a substantive in Egyptian. In the Pyr. texts, and in the oldest texts of the Book of the Dead hike appears as a power (or quality) which is poss essed by the gods, and by all the deified dead, (i) It is some thing which is needed to make divinity complete a necessary item, so to speak, of a god s equipment. It is represented (Pyr. 397) as a quality of the gods which the king assimilates by devouring the substance of the gods, i 2) It is, further, set forth as a power or equipment of the Dead of which they may be robbed by various enemies in the Underworld. (3) It seems, thus, to resemble, somehow, other qualities, or endow ments needed for the full perfection of the glorified Dead - something, that is, on the same plane as the so-called Kas of Re. It deifies to some extent. Again, it is clear from a number of passages that hike implies power over things demonic and evil. It is used, for instance, against the foes of the sun-god, 14) or against sickness particularly against various forms of poi soning. (51 The power thus employed against evil is often described as if it were something carried in the mouth, and put into action by utterance. 1 6) In a few isolated passages hike seems to mean strangely enough, at first sight, an evil thing or influence which is to be expelled. (Ebers, 84, 7 etc.) Looking at the use of the word hike generally, we find that it seems to include the whole field of what might be called magical. It is a sort of mysterious power which can produce effects beyond the sphere of man s achievement: ( 7) it is a something before which demons of sickness, and of poison evil demons in general, must give way.

There are indications that the magical formulae of Thoth existed in special collections. A statue in Cairo (No. 583, XVIII th Dyn.) says: &quot;I was initiated into the divine book: I saw the glorifications of Thoth&quot;.

The magician is necessarily a being of great power, since even the strongest antagonists even demons, are compelled to submit to him. It is not improbable, therefore, that a number of epithets implying the possession of great power and strength which are often given to Thoth, are connected with his role as magician.

Another way of insuring oneself against sickness is to identify oneself by potent words with Horus, for Thoth will then hasten to protect the new Horus as he once protected the child Horus from the scorpion s sting. 12) The protection of Thoth seems to have been peculiarly efficacious against scorpion-attacks. The aid of the god is sometimes invoked in sickness by re minding Thoth of his own physical troubles, and his own successful treatment of them. *O Thoth heal me as thou didst nine times great&quot; \\vc have a superlative of a superlative, / . c. thrice greatest&quot; 7pi7ar ; &quot;.-7o:. It has been suggested that Thoth s title &quot;eight times great&quot; is to be ex plained as a reference to the fact that eight dog-headed apes were his oopu^opQt in Ihiunr. It is to be noted that the title of Thoth s High Priest at fjininr, \\\\ r dwl &quot;the Great of the Five&quot;, has been similarlv explained as referring to the four deities who were worshipped at an early period along with Thoth in Hninir. The four primitive divine beings afterwards became, by the addition of four fenulc deities, the eiuht oosjioVr. of Thoth and thus arose the name of their city JJtiunr. &quot;The Great of the Five&quot;, as a title of Thoth (as well as of his high priest), is related to the title &quot;rive times great&quot; which Thoth receives (of.

The powerful protection of Thoth s nrngic is alluded to in the saying in Anastasi, &quot;My god Thoth is a shield round about me&quot; (Anast. I, 8, 3).(i) As magician Thoth is powerful patron of physicians, and so, he is asked to give skill to &quot;those who know things&quot;, and &quot;to the physicians who are in his train&quot; (Pap. Hearst VI, loXfa) We have seen that, in the older texts Thoth acted as physician of the eye of Horus. From the Ebers Papyrus (90, 16; we learn that he once cured Horus from something like an un pleasant cold. For the ancients magic and medicine were so closely related that we cannot always mark them off clearly from each other in Fgyptian texts. Medicine was the science which dealt with the rites and formulae by which the unseen malicious spirits which caused disease could be expelled from the bodies of men. Its sphere was, therefore, largely coexten sive with that of Magic. The functions of Thoth as physician and magician help to explain the existence of enormous numbers of amulets in the form of figurines of Thoth which have been found in all parts of Egypt. Possibly also this side of the god s activity had much to do with the swift growth of his popularity in the Graeco-Roman period. In this period he appears clearly as an Egyptian Aesculapius. Thoth of Pnubs is represented in Philae in a temple-decoration of the time of Tiberius as Aesculapius, holding in his hand a staff round which a serpent winds itself. (3) In the Nubian temple of Dendur Thoth of Pnubs is shown in human form crowned with the diadem of Shu: he is seated and holds in his left hand the symbol of (1) Ps. 3 4 &amp;lt;-:;i ]:q rrrr nr.s.

(2) It is an epithet which belongs to Thoth in a special way in his form of Istn.

In Daressy s &quot;7V.v/t\\v ct dcssins magiques&quot; , p. 15 (Cat. du Mus. dit Caire, 9405) is a reference to the need of invoking Thoth in time of peril, and to the haste with which the god brings help: &quot;Thou grantest that Thoth comes to me when I call, and that he rescues me from the &quot; {j&amp;gt; * W I At least in the late texts, therefore, Thoth appears as a Heilpott, as a saviour, and protector from evil - - especially the evil of sickness. As the saviour who comes when he is invoked Thoth was one of the most popular of all the gods, and many hymns and prayers addressed to him by individuals of all classes have come down to us. It is to be noted that the form of Thoth in which he is thus popularly invoked, is most frequently his lunar, or ibis form; Thoth, as an Edfu text has it, is ^* X ^r &quot;the Ibis splendid in (Edfu, K, II, 16).

It is not true, of course, that Thoth is the only great magician among the gods even in the later periods. Every god possessed something of the peculiar quality, or power which is called hike some gods having more of it, others less. Thoth, probably on account of his special gnosis, and his connection with ritual formulae, w r as regarded as having a very special equipment of hike. It now remains to be seen whether he was also in the Middle, and Old, Kingdoms re garded as a god of magic. Thoth appears with considerable prominence in the fu nerary texts of the earlier periods. This, of itself, would sug gest that his connection with magic is very ancient. The early recognition of Thoth as author of sacred ritual would point in the same direction. Yet the textual evidence in the Middle Kingdom is otherwise almost nul. In the Old King dom there are traces of a special magical gnosis being as signed to Thoth.

The moon was associated with magic in the thought of several ancient peoples, (i) and it would seem at times as if that association caused the moon to be invested occasionally with a malicious and .sinister character. This may, perhaps, throw .some light on the strange circumstance that -Thoth appears at times in the Pyramid texts as hostile to the dead king (see Pyr. 954; 955). In certain texts of the Pyramids Thoth is described as a being of dread aspect who slaughters the enemies of Osiris (Pyr. 635; 962). A similar idea seems to be conveyed in the Book of the Dead (134, 10 n) where /s/;z (== Thoth) is spoken of as the &quot;^^ V*! fi? ^ 3 who bathes in the blood of the enemies of the god&quot;, ill (i) Gf. Psalm 121, 6."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"i3 4 TIIOTII IN MAGIC. This being, &quot;great in slaughter and mighty in dread&quot;, seems to bear little resemblance to the mild and benevolent ibis-god. There is something uncouth and barbarous in this description of Thoth; but it is at least possible that we have here a trace of an ancient view which ascribed to Thoth such malicious and dangerous power as the thought of the old world some times associated with the moon. Thoth s title ^^&quot; ^ n ft c Lord of terror&quot; in Pyr. 2iioc may also, as we said above, refer to his function as magical protector of Osiris, (i) The prominent part assigned to Thoth by the Pyr. texts in the ceremonies of preparing the royal dead for burial suggests, almost inevitably, his possession of magical powers. His position as &quot;Scribe of Re&quot; and &quot;Bearer of the Divine Rook&quot; points in the same direction. &quot;Scribe of the Divine Hook&quot; was a familiar title of the priest who is called Her-heb, her d&amp;gt;d* in the Old Kingdom. (2) In the later periods certainly, and, therefore, probably in the earlier also, the Herheb was regarded as peculiarly equipped with magical power. This power, then, must also have belonged to Thoth, the Scribe of the Divine Hook par excellence. When in Kdfu Thoth is called the great Ilerheb it is but another instance of the presence in Ptolemaic texts of ancient religious thought. The idea of Thoth as a god of magic in a special way may be regarded then, as an ancient possession of Egyptian speculation. (3) (it Cf. Plutarch, Is. ct ()., ch. 8.

In the Pyramid texts Thoth is associated with the ancient god of the dead, Anubis, in reconstructing- the body of the dead king- (or, Osiris), (i) and in the removal from it of the traces of burial (Pyr. 1247: 519). It is Thoth also who pro nounces the formulae of &quot;glorification&quot; (Pyr. 796) (2) though Anubis seems to recite them sometimes, as if he were taking the place of Thoth (Pyr. 796). We have to picture to our selves Thoth s functions in the mortuary ritual of the Pyramid period, in general after the manner of the Her-heb s activity in the ritual of later times. (3 ) The Pyramid text speak of the dead king as being borne on the wings of the ibis-god, either up to heaven, or across the celestial oceans. (4) Again, we find that the Feast of Thoth was one of the chief memorial days of the dead. Pyr. 2118 says: &quot;My heart is not weary to perform for thee the service for the dead every day, on the Feast of the month and half-month, on the feast of the laying down of the candle stick, on the Feast of Thoth, and on the -j 5, O~~0 (U^-feast), throughout the duration of thy years, and thy months which thou livest as god.&quot; (5) This Feast of Thoth (or &quot;Feast of (1) Pyr. 10 : 83o : 6^9.

In view of all this, Thoth must be regarded as a god of the dead in the Old Kingdom. The details of the Osirian legend bear out this view of his character. Obviously the functions of Thoth as advocate and judge in the trial of Osiris are the functions of a god of the dead. Though, as has been already noted, the various phases of the Osirian Trial were only gradually imagined -by people and priests, and it is dif ficult to decide which features of the Trial are the most pri mitive, it is likely that Thoth took his place naturally in the process from the beginning, because of his character as god of the dead. The Osirian cult was developed in Egypt mainly in the form of a mortuary cult, and as the Osirian religion came to dominate the entire worship of Egypt, the daily temple- worship of Egypt tended to become a sort of funerary ritual. It was, at all events, strongly influenced by the drama of Osiris. In a similar way even the court ceremonial of Egypt took on a sort of Osirian or funerary tone. The numerous pictorial representations of the Trial of Osiris which existed in the O. and M. K. must have exercised a great influence on the religious imagination of the people. Thus, temple- cult, state -ceremonial, and sacred art, emphasising every where the importance of Osirian religion, and setting its beliefs so concretely before the multitude, must have helped greatly to establish Thoth in his role as god of the dead. But as has been remarked, Thoth must have found his place the dead into the late period. Vid. Ritncl de I cmbaumcment, Pap.

The Lord ot sacred worship, and of the &quot;Divine w r ords&quot; belonged, of ne cessity, to the ritual of the dead : there the &quot;Knowing One&quot;, the &quot;mighty in word would naturally be in his right place. An ibis-god could more easily than other deities take care of the dead. He could bear them away on his wings over all the obstacles of the other world, to their place of blessedness. His lunar character also connected him in popular imagination witli the dead, ^i) The reappearance of the moon on the Feast of the New Moon symbolised very obviously the rebirth of the dead in the world beyond the tomb. Hence in Pyr. 782 we find that the dead king is reborn on the feast of the new moon. In the list of ceremonial days above referred to (Pyr. 2ii8b) the feasts of \\ and , of month and /^C 7C half-month, appear prominently, as if the glorification of the dead were- somehow connected with the life of the moon (cf. Pyr. 14531. The close association of the moon with the dead is quaintly expressed in Pyr. ioor, where looh is called the brother of the dead king. (2) Jn the Middle Kingdom we can see more clearly Thoth s close connection with the dead.

He stretches out his hand from heaven to grasp the arm of the dead in order to lead him up to the kingdom of the gods (cf. ibid., p. 201 and Pyr. 1247 d). In the New Kingdom and later periods the role of Thoth in the Judgment of the dead becomes more and more im portant. In these later periods the ceremonies which Thoth, Anubis, and Horus anciently performed for the dead Osiris are still performed by them for the dead worshippers of Osiris. Mortals were still subjected to the same dread Trial through which their great patron and model, Osiris, had so triumph antly passed. The priests who take part in funeral services of the late period call themselves by the names of Horus, Anubis and Thoth. (2) The ceremonies of reanimation of the dead were carried out even in the latest period of Egyptian culture, and the priests who perform them appear as Horus, Anubis and Thoth. (3) Similarly, in the ceremony of &quot;Opening the mouth&quot; the Hcr-hcb priest appears as Thoth. - To Thoth, as patron of the dead, prayers for a pleasant burial are addressed in the later periods.

In the innumerable representations of temple-liturgy, court-ceremonial, and funerary ritual which can be seen everywhere in Egypt Thoth appears not merely as the Lord of sacred formulae, but as the leader in the actual sacred ceremonial itself - - as a sort of official master of liturgical ceremonies. This is obvious in the case of Osirian cult. The Pyr. texts seem to imply this liturgical activity of Thoth also. They represent Thoth as acting- with Anubis in preparing- for burial the corpse of Osiris i Pyr. 83o, 639^:(ii as purifying- witli Horus the body of the god (or king&quot;) iPyr. 5igb. 63g): as pronouncing- the deifying- formulae over the body i Pyr. 17131.

When the dead has to enter into the presence of the Great Tribunal -&amp;gt;f the gods Thoth leads him in, makes plead ing- for him with the Judges, weighs his heart in the scales against the feather of Ma et, and, in the end, records the verdict. The details of all this ritual and ceremonial are fa miliar in the literature of the Book of the Dead: What Thoth once did for Osiris, the same must he do for every dead Egyptian since the Osirian ritual was the standard and guide for all funerary ritual in Egypt. Hence, as has been already noted, the priests who took part in funerary celebrations re garded themselves as incorporations of the Osirian gods. It will be true, of course, that the Osirian liturgy was, in its (i) For a late illustration of the cooperation of Horns and Thoth in the embalming of the ilea.i see Mnlli-r, /)/&amp;lt; bciitt n WiinJfitfrrus.

Possibly it may be held that the gods of the old Osirian drama reflect, to some extent, the priests and magicians who, in the primitive period, provided all that was necessary for the dead. When Thoth was given a place in the Osirian ritual, it was a place determined partly by his personal qualities, and, partly, by the associations of ancient custom. Thus his role in funerary ritual was imagined as that of a primitive Hcr-hcb of Osirian liturgy. In the later thought of Egypt the Her-hcb was himself regarded as some sort of incorporation of Thoth. Throughout the whole specu lative and religious development of the Egyptian mind there are many traces of this quaint kind of action and re-action between traditional custom and artificial speculation. It has been shown already that Thoth played a great part in Egyptian court-ceremonial. The fixing of the royal mimes, the determining of the years of reign, the foretelling of royal feasts and victories all these are functions assigned to Thoth in the coronation-ceremonies. They are all fully illustrated on the monuments. In the actual coronation-cere monies a priest, of course, took the part of Thoth. Even in the joyful liturgy of coronation there are echoes of the funerary, or Osirian, ritual. One of these is the purification of the king. This is very often represented. Sometimes it is performed by Horus and Set, sometimes by Horns and Thoth. (i) A very interesting feature of the coronation-ceremonial was the sym bolical uniting of the Two Lands -- represented by the rush and the papyrus. The ceremony was called SmJ tlwi. Properly speaking this ceremony belonged to the two gods who re presented the two great divisions of Egypt -- Horus and Set. It is, however, a remarkable fact that Set disappeared at an early date from the representations of this ceremonial. His place was taken by Thoth. This circumstance is to be associated with the substitution of the name of Thoth for that of Set in the lists of gods. In the purification-ceremony at the coronation Set also tends to disappear, leaving his place to Thoth. All this, of course, is somehow to be connected with the gradual (i) For role of Thoth and Horus in the ablutions of the king before he takes part in the temple- ritual see Blackman, Temple of Deir, plate 42."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"I 4 4 THOTH IN EGYPTIAN RITUAL. degradation of Set to the level of a Typhonic being, (i) In several representations of ritual the figure of Set has been replaced by that of Thoth, but the accompanying legends con taining the name of Set, have been left unchanged (cf. LD. Ill, Sybilll, 6 5 d;IIl, 2 38a).( 2 ) The substitution of Thoth for Set is to be explained partly by the role of Thoth as Lord of ritual, and partly by the circumstance that Horus and Thoth appear together in many other familiar ceremonies of court-procedure, and temple- cult, and thus, \\vould be regarded as suitable companions in the coronation functions. In the temple-cult, as has been said, many features of funerary ritual were reproduced - - as a result of the domi nating influence of Osirian religion in the temples. If we look closely at any particular temple-liturgy, that of Amon for in stance, we find in it numerous points of contact with the Osirian drama. Thus in the temple-worship of Egypt Thoth appears active almost in the same fashion in which he func tions in Osirian worship. It is true that the ritual of Egyptian temples was not quite taken up with the religion of Osiris. Other ancient myths and legends, over and above those of the Osirian cycle, are echoed and reflected in the temple cults. Thus, for in stance, many legends of the sun-god (such as the legend of Hathor-Tefenet), and many cosmogonical legends find ex pression occasionally in the worship of the temples. In the ritual texts which refer to such legends Thoth appears in the fashion proper to him in the legend in question. Junker, in his excellent treatise, l)cr Auszug dcr Hathor-Tefnut aus Nubicn, has shown how from the pictorial representation of ritual actions an important legend in which Thoth plays a pro minent part, can be actually, in large measure, reconstructed i cf. also his Onnrislegende). It must be admitted, however, that we cannot discover in every ritual act the legendary elements which be behind it. This is true, for instance, of a ritual action which is very (1) Cf.

(i) It has been conjectured that the wnsb is a water-clock, and that Thoth is associated with it as lord and measurer of time. But the wnsb (or wtt) is, appar ently, most frequently used in the ceremony of the pacification of Hathor (as the angry Horus-eye) by Thoth, and it is difficult to see how a water-clock could serve such a purpose. In the Nubian legend of Hathor Thoth is sent as an ape-god to calm the angry Hathor and induce her to come to Egypt. It is possible that the ape which appears as part of the object called wnsb was regarded as symbolical of the god who was sent to pacify Hathor, and that, thus, the wnsb came to be a recognised feature in the ceremony of pacifying the angry Horus-eye. It is to be noted that the ape-god who calms Hathor, and in duces her to leave Bwgm for Egypt in the form of the Nubian legend contained in the folk-tale published by Spiegelberg, (2) is called wns (the dog-headed ape, apparently) and there may be some kind of morphological connection between urns and wnsb. As the Hathor of the Nubian legend is the lunar eye of Horus, there is a close connection between the wnsb and lunar cult. If wns and wnsb are morphologically related (the b of wnsb being a formative element) the lunar implications of the wnsb could be explained from the moon-legend of the angry Hathor. (3) A very prominent feature of ritual functions throughout the later periods is the presentation of the figure of Ma et. In most instances of this ceremony Thoth is present, either in person, or as represented by the king (or priest). We have already discussed some of Thoth s associations with Ma et. 5J N/I (1) Gf.

We have seen the two together in the barque of the sun-god - Thoth as chief minister of the Ruler of the universe, Ma et as symbol of Re s methods of government. In somewhat si milar fashion the two come to be associated in ritual. Thoth is the Lord of ritual : Ma et is the symbol of conformity to law, and, especially, of conformity to ritual law. Thus when Thoth presents Ma et to a divinity, his action symbolises the perfection of the ritual service which is offered to the divinity in question. When, as sometimes happens, Ma et is presented to Thoth himself, this is partly due to Thoth s relation to justice, and partly to the symbolism of Ma et just described, /. e., the offering of Ma et to Thoth implies the perfection of the cult which is intended to be offered to him. Another function at which Thoth is constantly present is the offering of the wdl-t.

It has been shown above that Thoth anciently stood outside the Heliopolitan group of gods, and that he was not one of the actors in the primitive Osirian drama, but was brought into it in a more or less secondary fashion. Hence it is reasonable to infer that the cult of Thoth was known in Egypt previously to the Pyramid age and previ ously even to the growth and spread of Osirian religion. It is not possible, however, to determine where Thoth had his most ancient shrine. The &quot;Place of Thoth&quot; ( i) referred to in Pyr. 1271 cannot be located by any other Pyramid re ference. It is probable that in the early dynastic period - possibly even in the pre-dynastic period - Thoth had al ready several cult-centres. The standards of Hierakonpolis (I, pi. 29) show the sacred ibis of Thoth, and in Hierakon polis, too, we find a representation of a primitive shrine of Thoth which seems to point to the existence of a cult of the ibis-god in Hierakonpolis in the days of Narmer. (2) With the shrine depicted in Hierakonpolis should be compared the re presentation of a shrine, or other enclosure, in the midst of which stands an ibis, in Royal Tombs, II, pi. X ; 2.

It cannot be said with complete security that the Hermopolis in question is the Hermopolis Magna of Upper Egypt, rather than Her mopolis Parva of the Delta. Both towns are mentioned in an ancient list of centres of worship in Pyr. 191, (i) as Wnw of the South and Wnw of the North. It is known that the two Wnn&amp;gt; were important centres of Thoth s worship in the M. K. It is very difficult, however, to decide which of them is the more primitive home of Thoth s worship. Since, how ever, the nome of the Ibis (no. 15) is in the Delta, and the nome of which Hermopolis Magna was the capital is called the nome of the Hare, it has been conjectured that the Ibis- god, Thoth, was first worshipped in the Delta, and that his cult in Hermopolis Magna (Hmnw} developed later. (2) Such a view is based on the assumption that the nome-standards or nome-symbols represent the primitive objects of worship of the nomes. This is, however, a mere hypothesis. Where can one find a trace of the worship of a hare in the i5th nome of Upper Egypt ? Again, how, on this view, could we ex plain the designation of the northern Hermopolis in the Py ramids as &quot;Wnw (i. e. the Hare-nome) of the North&quot; ? It would, indeed, be very satisfactory if we could show that Thoth, the ibis-god and moon-god, was primitively worshipped in the Delta, and that at some later, indeterminable, date he was somehow assimilated to an ape-god revered as a god of wis dom in Hmnw. This hypothesis would explain the combined roles of Thoth as, on the one hand, lord of time and order, and, on the other, lord of wisdom and literature. Unfortu nately, however, it must remain a hypothesis, for we know nothing definite about the beginnings of Thoth s worship either in the Delta, or in Hermopolis Magna. The representations in Hierakonpolis and the Royal Tombs point, perhaps, to a fairly general worship of Thoth in the O. K. The existence of a special priesthood of Thoth (1) Gf.

K. is also suggested by the Snofru texts (i) of Wadi Maghara in Sinai in which Thoth appears beside Hathor, as an important divinity. Thoth s title in Sinai is nb hlswt. (2) This is, properly speaking, an epithet of Min : (3) it shows, however, that for the Egyptian miners in Sinai, Thoth s influence was not to be restricted to a single centre, or even to the soil of Egypt itself. (4) We have seen above that Thoth holds an important place in the funerary texts of the Middle Kingdom. Throughout this period he stands in the closest connection with Hrntw, the &quot;City of the Eight&quot;, the metropolis of the Hare-nome in Upper Egypt. From this connection arises his frequent title ^z^ ~~ &quot;Lord of the city of the Eight&quot; ( the modern Eshmunein). (5) (1) I rkunden, I. 54: L. D. II, 1523: Thesaurus 1495.

(4) Students of the history of religions will probably be familiar with Voelter s attempt to argue from the presence of Thoth-worship in Sinai to a connection between the Hebrew leader Moses and Thoth. In his book on the Hebrew Patriarchs (Die Patriarehen Israels. Leyden, 1912), and in his recent pamphlets, &quot;UVr war Mose 9, and Jahve mid Mose (both published by Brill, Leyden) Voelter has brought together a great mass of arguments to show that the Hebrew God Yahweh is really a form of the Egyptian god I.Iar-Sopd, and that Moses is a form of Thoth. The presence of Haihor in Sinai Voelter associates with the legends of the Eye of the sun-god (Horns) which was brought back to Egypt by Thoth. The story of Moses and Sippora is but an attempt, according to Voelter, to give a historical form to the legend of Thoth and Hathor. The speculations of Voelter are often highly in genious, but they are, for the most part, quite out of all relation with facts, and do not deserve to be seriously discussed. Eisler (Die kenitischen \\Veihinschriften der Hyksoszeit, Freibg. 1919^.154) thinks that Thoth is in place in Sinai because, Der Herr der Offenbarungen und Geheimnisse gilt offenbar auch als Herr der unerforschten Lander&quot;. He says further: &quot;Vielleicht ist Thoth auch als Gott, der die Brunnen in der \\Viiste kennt und offen- bart (Pap. Sallier, I, 82 ff. . . .

Often they call themselves ( 2 ) which was apparently the title of the chief priest of the City of the Eight (cf. Edfu Rochm. I, 129).

In another hymn to Thoth composed in the time of Rameses IV (pub. by Piehl, A. Z. 1884, p. 38 ff.) the &quot;Island of Flame&quot; is spoken of as the birthplace of Thoth. In the Pyramid texts the Isle of Flame is either an island in the lake or ocean which the dead have to cross, or a place where the dead have to give an exhibition of their power before they are admitted to the land of the gods. In the Pyramids the name of the island is written /VA/WSA HO MU i .(3) I 1 1 i &quot;ft 1 The exhibition of might to be given by the dead in the Isle of Flame is, apparently, a struggle against lying and in justice. (4) Here again there may be some remote suggestion of Thoth s position as &quot;Lord of Ma et&quot;. In the Book of the Dead (A. a. Nav,) 71, 16 18, we hear of seven words which caused a slaughter on the &quot;Island of Flame&quot;; and ch. 15 of the Book of the Dead (Naville, c. 15 B. I. [B. a.], 1. i3 14) speaks of the great god who lives on the Island, the golden youth who came forth from the lotus-flower. It is said also (Lacau, Textes rcl. XIX, Rec. 27, p. 217) that Hprr was born on the Isle of Flame. It is not obvious how the heavenly Isle of Flame cor responds to the necropolis of Hmnn r . The name &quot;Isle of Flame&quot; is certainly very ancient. It has been noted already that the tendency of Egyptian speculation was rather to elevate things earthly into things heavenly, than to bring heavenly things down to earth, and give them a dwelling there. The reference to the birth of the solar deity on the Isle of Flame suggests, perhaps, a means of connecting the Hermopolitan necropolis with the Isle of Flame in heaven. It is well known that in Hermopolis was laid the scene of a number of cosmogonies ; and according to one of those cosmogonies the sun-god ap peared in Hermopolis in a lotus-flower.

The coming forth of the primitive deity from a lotus-blossom flowering in the Nwn is also, as has just been said, localised in Hermopolis. So in Dendereh (Mar.

We have already discussed an important form of the ancient rcgend of the birth of the sun- god, the scene of which is also laid in Hermopolis. (2) There is an interesting modification of this legend to be found in the texts of the Graeco-Roman period which Sethe has ana lysed for the \\V&amp;lt;&quot;&amp;gt;rtcrbuch. According to these texts the Ogdoad, the eight primitive deities were formed in Thebes. Tnn created them in */pt: there they descended to their &quot;home&quot;, the Isle of Flame.

This form of the legend is, obviously, due to an attempt to connect the creative activity of Ptah-7 w/z with the idea of a creation of light in Hmnn .

(2) There are many indications that Hermopolis was a centre of cosmogonic speculation. Mysterious passages in the Book of the Dead indicate its importance in the funerary literature of Egypt (cf. Book of the Dead. [Naville], 56, 84 ; 64, 89 : ch. 5 ; cf. also Lepsius, Totb., c. 146, 3i- 35). It was known also as a source from which could be derived the most im portant and powerful magical formulae (Book of the Dead, Nav. 1 37 A, 23 24). Even in the days of Menkaure sacred formulae were sought in the &quot;City of the Eight 1 and were found &quot;under the feet of this god&quot; (/. e., probably, Thoth ; cf. Book of the Dead, Nav. 148, 1518). The name of Thoth s city, the &quot;City of the Eight&quot; has often been accounted for by reference to the cult, which existed there, of eight beings represented as having the forms of serpents, or frogs, or apes. There existed in Hermopolis - at least in the latter period a shrine of the Ogdoad be side that of Thoth. (3) The Eight are often mentioned and variously depicted - - but not in very ancient texts. The fa miliar designation of Thoth and of his chief-priest in Her mopolis - - &quot;Great of the Five&quot;, makes it unlikely that there (1) Note that in the &quot;hiyh place of Hni&amp;gt;nr&quot; Re won some sorts of viclorv over rebels.

Hence he is the god who raises up the sky by coming between it and the earth. In the darkness of night and greyness of dawn earth and sky seem to be merged in a close embrace. Between them comes the light, and raises up the heavens. Shu is thus the support of heaven : he is also, obviously, a light-god. Thus he came to be identified, on the one hand, with Re, and, on the other, with Chons in Thebes. It is probable that &quot;the raised up of Shu&quot; (the heaven) was thought of in the legends of Hermopolis as having been brought into being in Eshmunein by the shining forth in that ancient centre of the light which separated heaven from earth (/. c. by the appearance of Shu). (3) Cf. Pianchi-stela."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"i 5 8 THE CHIEF TEMPLES AND SHRINES OF THOTH. was primitively a cult of an Ogdoad in Eshmunein. The &quot;Five&quot; of Hermopolis were, probably, Thoth and four others. The Ogdoad may have developed from the four. An indi cation of this is the fact that of the names of the Eight four are feminine forms of the remaining four. Thus the four female deities may have been merely supplements made to the original group by priestly speculation. The name Hmnw for Hermo polis does not seem to go back into the ancient period. The possibility cannot, of course, be excluded that the name Hmmv is ancient, and that from the name itself has arisen the legend of the Hermopolitan Ogdoad. (i) It would be possible to set up several hypotheses to account for the introduction of an ibis-cult into Eshmunein. Such hypotheses, however, could not be tested. The com parative absence of ancient archaeological material in the Delta makes it practically impossible to determine whether the northern or southern Hermopolis is the older centre of Thoth-cult. It can scarcely be doubted, however, that there was a shrine of Thoth in the Delta in the most ancient period. It is the existence of such an ancient cult-centre in the Delta that, as we have seen, explains, in part at least, Thoth s as sociation with the Delta-drama of Osiris. The &quot;northern Wnw&quot; i Pyr. 191) is probably Thoth s centre in the Delta- but this designation affords no sound basis for a theory of the priority of the shrine in Middle Egypt. It is simply impossible, working with existing knowledge, to determine anything in reference to the mutual relations of the sanctuaries of Thoth in the Delta and in Middle Egypt.

The El Bersheh reference to the temples of Thoth in the north and south (supra, p. 151, n. 2) justifies us in assuming that there was a fairly widespread public cult of Thoth in the Middle Kingdom. With the XVIIIth Dynasty a period of exceptionally intense veneration of Thoth begins. That is evident from the extra ordinary popularity of personal names having &quot;Thoth&quot; as one of their constituents, throughout the duration of that dynasty. We hear in this period also of the building of different shrines in honour of the god. Queen Hatshepsowet boasts of her zeal for the worship of Thoth. She doubled the offerings usually set apart for his cult (Urk. IV, 38g. Inscription from Speos Artemidos), and erected new sanctuaries for the god. Appa rently she built a shrine for Thoth in the valley at Speos Artemidos (near Beni Hassan). It is probably from this shrine (i) RAJ is mentioned on the stone of Palermo.

We have, however, no reliable materials to form a judgment on the matter. It may be assumed, however, as highly pro bable that the art of Amarna, which is so different in certain features from the conventional art of Egypt, was, to some extent, at least, the work of artists of Thoth s city. The &quot;City of the Eight&quot; was an important centre of art as well as of religion, even in the Middle Kingdom, and the tomb-paintings of the nth. and 12 th. dynasties from Sheikh Sa id to Minieh, and in El Bersheh, were the work of the 1 fermopolitan School, (i) The peculiar methods of the Hermopolitan artists can be traced also, it is held, in the art of Amarna. (2; It is not legitimate, of course, to argue from the presence of Hermopolitan artists in Amarna, either that Amarna was in fluenced in any way by the religious news of Thoth s city, or that the worshippers of the sun-disc at Amarna were more kindly disposed to the cult of Thoth than to that of Amon. Possibly, however, it might be fair to infer from the traces of Hermopolitan art at Amarna something as to the style and method of temple-decoration in Thoth s city in the Amarna period. Erom the connection between Thoth-cult and Egyptian colonisation and propaganda, which we see in the work of Horemheb in Nubia, it is obvious that the cult of our god lost nothing of its importance through the politico- religious activities of Amenhotep IV. The period of the 19 th. Dynasty furnishes us with un mistakable evidence of the popularity and influence of Thoth in the Egypt of that dynasty. The great builders of temples Sethos I and Rameses II erected several shrines in his honour. In the time of Sethos I we find Thoth designated ^z &quot;Lord of Karnak&quot;.

The whole outlook of Egyptologists on the art and religion of Amarna, and on the supposed reform of Amenhotep IV is likely to be changed greatly in the near future. That either the cult of Itn in Amarna or the artistic methods of those who set up the royal buildings there contained features which were quite unconditioned by anything that preceded them in Egyptian culture is not likely to be maintained so stoutly in the future as it has been in the past.

Numerous temples were built in this period all over Egypt. The cult of Thoth was affected greatly by the Ptolemaic religious revival, and it would seem as if the ancient god of ritual enjoyed in this period of Egyptian renaissance a greater popularity and exercised a greater influence, than at any other period of Egyptian history. In the great temple of Hathor at Dendereh Thoth appears as one of the most important deities : he had there a special shrine and a special cult, as we can see from his epithets ^ (Brugsch, Thcs. 760) and I n| Q , &quot;Dweller in Den dereh&quot; (Mar., Dend. Ill, 68 u) (i) In the temple of Horus at Edfu Thoth was still more important. In that great sanctuary he was revered as one with Chons the moon-god, and in that character was identified; in some sense, with Horus himself. He is called there : *V&quot; *lC ^N^ / - AAAAAA -&amp;lt;2&amp;gt;- ^^YYY^i^ &quot;Chons-Thoth, the lion, ^-^ _ Q di i mighty in power, the f hm, many-coloured of plumage, the great in strength, the mighty of limb, who makes a slaughter among the enemies of the W^-Eye&quot; (2]. The god is here repre sented, at one time, as a falcon wearing the solar disc- (like Horus), and at another, as a lion. This idea of Thoth as a lion is suggested often, as we shall see, in the later Nubian temples. It is possible that it is ultimately derived from the identification of Thoth with Chons-Shu in Thebes. Thoth is connected in a very special way with one portion of the Temple of Edfu. This is the &quot;&-Miouse&quot;, the H-t sbk-t. It was, apparently, some kind of shrine or chapel of the moon-god which formed part of the temple of Horus. In this shrine were kept statues (or other representations) of Chons and (1) See Turayetf, p. 149. (2) Edfu, R. I. 263."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"166 THE CHIEF TEMPLES AND SHRINES OF THOTH.

(3) That the ^A- /-house was connected with moon-worship is clear from the fact that the lunar-eye, the moon as eye of the god of heaven, is called Sbk-t ^ (Edfu, R. I. 77).

I. 53) may be somehow connected with the celebrations in the Sbk-t-shr me on the month- days, or it may point to the existence of still another shrine which belonged to Thoth in Edfu. But the exact meaning of the epithet is obscure. (6 ) An interesting shrine of Thoth existed in the Ptolemaic period in Thebes. A remarkable Edfu narrative of the birth of the Ogdoad , Edfu, R. F, 77) speaks of an ~ of Thoth in &amp;lt;^&amp;gt; n XI IMG Medinet Habu). (7) This shrine of the god was erected by Ptolemy IX (Euergetes II).

In the text of the Dedication of the shrine (2) it is said that Thoth (or possibly Teos) was wont to descend on the temple each evening in the form of an ibis ; and every mor ning, according to the text, the god went forth again from the shrine. It would thus seem that the temple was looked upon as a centre for night-oracles received through incubation; and it is probable that the chief worshippers in the temple were the sick who came to get comfort in their pains from such dreams as the night-abiding god of healing might send to them. The peculiar epithet of Thoth in this shrine, - - Stm, &quot;he who hears&quot;, would fit in well with the customs of such a temple. (3 &amp;gt; The cult of Thoth in the later period in Nubia seems to have developed just as steadily as his cult in the Egypt of that period. In the great sanctuary of Philae Thoth was very specially ,-enerated.

Thus lie appears, for instance, in Philae as &quot;the god of wine who drinks abundantly&quot; and, again, as the lord of drunkenness and fes tivity&quot;. He appears here, further, as &quot;the living lion which overthrows the evil ones, mighty in strength, lord of victory&quot;. ( i ) In Philae, as in Dendereh, Thoth is identified with Shu : he is said to be &quot;the mighty Shu, Lord of wine&quot;.

Here again, as at Philae, it is the Nubian, rather than the Egyptian Thoth that is honoured. (5) The chief shrine of Thoth of Nubia was the temple of Dakkeh (Pselkis). This temple was built by the Nubian king (I (1 , Ergamenes, who was a contemporary of the I A I AAAAAA second, third, and fourth Ptolemies. Ptolemy IX, who built the shrine of Thoth in XUMG built also a Pronaos for Hermes Paotnuphis (i. e. Thoth of Pnubs) at Dakkeh.

In the temple of Ofedwineh the sacred sycamore is frequently depicted, and there also the goddess Isis is represented as seated under a tree, while Thoth stands beside her.

(i) There was however, another Pnubs in Upper Nubia (2) where Ergamenes lived in the early period of his rule. It is, therefore, likely that &quot;Thoth of Pnubs&quot; at Pselkis and elsewhere derived his title from the Upper Nubian town where Ergamenes began his reign. (3) Thoth of Pnubs is represented at times as an ape seated under a tree (probably the ;z/&amp;gt;.v-tree). (4) It is a reasonable conjecture that the Nubian Thoth was somehow associated with tree-worship. It is rather as ape than as ibis that he appears in Nubia, and an ape-cult would stand, perhaps, without difficulty in close relationship with the worship of a sacred tree. But it is not possible to indicate clearly the pro cess by which Thoth came thus to be worshipped in asso ciation with a sacred tree. In Dakkeh, the chief Nubian shrine of the god, his identity with Thoth of Hmnn is implied in some of the epithets ascribed to him. The epithets of Thoth which recur most often at Dakkeh are &quot;Lord of Pnubs in Takens&quot; (/. e. north Nubia), &quot;Lord of Dakkeh&quot;, &quot;the Twice- great of Hmnw , &quot;Lord of Bigeh&quot;, &quot;Lord of the southern lands , n p rhn i, shtp nfrn . Both in Dakkeh and in Dendur Thoth of Pnubs appears as a form of Shu.

(i) In the Nubian temple of Debod (which, like the shrine of Dakkeh, was also built by a native Nubian ruler) Thoth of Pnubs is represented as a man in a standing position who holds in the left hand a j-sceptre together with a serpent and two scorpions.

The descriptive epithet nQl] U m &quot;th- 6 shining one&quot; is applied to Chons in Edfu- texts, and it is possible that the word swi may also have helped to bring about the identification of Chons and Shu.

The real god of Pnubs, according to Junker, is the warrior-god Onuris, and through Onuris Thoth and Shu are equated. In proof of this theory Junker carefully examines the representations of Thoth of Pnubs at Philae, Dakkeh and Dendur. The scorpion and serpents which are described in the text above as coiling themselves round the sceptre held by Thoth of Pnubs, Junker regards as a late addition to the original simple 1 -staff . In some instances the god holds instead of the |-staff a staff on which is set a falcon-head bearing the sun-disc the familiar sceptre of Onuris. Further Junker points out that Thoth of Pnubs seldom or never is shown as receiving gifts such as arc generally offered to Thoth of Ifmmv writing-apparatus, bread, symbols of moon-worship etc. The epithets &quot;Lion of the South&quot; &quot;He who comes forth from Nubia , Lord of the southern lunds&quot; which arc assigned to Thoth of Pnubs prove, also, according to Junker that the connection between the ancient god of Hminr and the god of Pnubs is merely external and secondary. When Thoth of Pnubs is called Lord of wine who drinks abundantly&quot;. &quot;Lord of drukenness and gladness&quot; he is identified again with Onuris of Nubia^ who was looked on as the &quot;Lord of wine . When Thoth of Pnubs is called Lord of Ma f et, Lord of judging who dwells in the House of books&quot; (Philae, Phot. 1.156), and again, &quot;the Scribe of the Knnead&quot; (Kalabsheh, Phot. 1776), the ascription to him of these //wmi -epithets may be due. according to Junker, either to some fundamental agreement in character between Thoth of Hmnw and the local god of Pnubs, or, more probably, to the fact that Onuris also was looked on (even in the N. K.) as Lord of laws and judging. That Onuris, however, came to be regarded as judge and legislator needs itself to be explained. Junker admits that the representation of Thoth of Pnubs in ape-form makes a difficulty for his theory suggesting that the primitive local god of Pnubs was an ape-god with which Onuris came somehow to be identified. Junker is certainly right in maintaining that Thoth and Onuris-Shu are associated at Pnubs largely through the legend of Onuris. It is, however, not yet clear in spite of his painstaking statement of the evidence for theory that Tholh of Hmnw is related in purely external and secondary fashion with the god of Pnubs."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Appendix A.

Some divine associates of Thoth. (a) Isds and Istn. In the texts of the Greek period Thoth is very frequently called Isds and Istn. It has been generally assumed that Isds and Istn designate two distinct divinities, and possible con nections between Istn and a conjectured Persian inagos Ostanes have been put forward by Egyptologists in discussing the Hermetic legend of Dernocritus of Abdera. (i) The truth seems to be, however, that the name Istn has arisen through a con fusion of the sign 5 (ds) with the sign (&quot;) (2) Thus the name Isds determined with the ds-jar came to be read as Isds-n. and then as Isdn f or Istn. This misunderstanding was assisted probably by a confusion between * and AA^AA, and, possibly also, by the circumstance that there existed a word * A (dm) which (like ds) meant &quot;jar&quot; or &quot;pot&quot;. The following list of forms which appear in the texts will help to show how Isds has become Istn : (Totb. Nav., ch. 17,41); q| ! __ D ^J ( Totb Lepsius, 145, 3g. 81. 86); (j [1 ^^ (Mar., Dend.

It must be admitted, however, that the priestly scribes of the Graeco-Roman period probably regarded Isds and Istn as fairly distinct divinities. Whether in that period the name of a Persian sage Ostanes had any part in helping to set up Istn as distinct from, and independent of Isds, or whether, on the other hand, the Memphitic Ostanes of the story of De- mocritus is a double of the Kgyptian Istn,(i) must remain uncertain. We may regard it, however, as practically certain that Istn is not connected with a verb w$P , to &quot;se- parate&quot; or &quot;distinguish&quot; (as Brugsch thinks, Worterbuch, pp. i26f. i, and that Thoth s function J HSX^ ~~*\\ ^^-^ (Brit.

In pre-Ptolemaic texts the identification of Thoth with Isds is also found. In the Book of the Dead, ch. 17, 41 (Naville) Set and Isds are put together as the &quot;Lords of Ma et&quot;, (2) and Isds is called &quot;Lord of the west&quot;. (3) This reminds us of Thoth s epithet s^7^ in the Catalogue of the Egyptian collection in the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge (p. 84), and his other epithet &quot;Bull of the west&quot; (see list of epithets above), and suggests that the identification of Thoth with Isds goes back to the N. K. In the Book of the Dead edited by Lepsius, ch. 145, 86. 87 we read in a prayer to be recited at the gates of the netherworld : &quot;I enter into the house of Isds ; I extol (j* i the T^^QQJJ)&quot; ( cf - ^id. 81 f.). Since Hu and Sia appear & _K^ \\\\ i i YI vi in this context we have here a further suggestion of the same identification of Isds with Thoth. (1) In the text Edfu R.

(Gf. Edfu R. I, 521 for a similar list.) (2) For Thoth as nb ml f .t see list in Appendix B. (3) Grapovv in his edition of ch. 17 (Religiose Urkunden I, p. 44) reads Thoth instead of Set.

This identification of Thoth with Isds in the funerary texts of the N. K. and later periods did not prevent Egyptian scribes of the same periods from holding the two beings apart. Thus the members of the Dhil-t mentioned in Totb. (Nav.) 18, 24 are Thoth, Osiris, Anubis, and Isds -- Thoth and Isds being enumerated as distinct individuals, (i) In the context of Lepsius l^otenbuch just referred to (145, 81 83) Isds is grouped, as Thoth often is, with Hu and Sia, which suggests that, just as Hu and Sia are both identical with, and different from, Thoth (supra p. 104^), so also Thoth and Isds were identical and se parate for Egyptian religious thought - - being regarded, per haps, ultimately as one divinity appearing in different aspects. The primary ground for the identification of Thoth and Isds is probably to be sought in the fact that Isds (Istn) was one of the dog-headed apes associated with the worship of the rising sun in Hmnn&amp;gt;. (2) Thoth was himself an ape-god, and it is not strange that he came to be identified with one of the sacred apes of his own &quot;City of the Eight&quot;. (3) (b) Chons. Chons was an ancient moon-god whose worship \\vas well established at Thebes, in the Middle Kingdom -- and probably earlier. (4) The name Chons means &quot;Wanderer&quot;, or &quot;Traveller&quot;, (5) ( i \\ Note that the same Old] /in the tomb of \\b-nmnf, Thebes.

This may be due to a confusion between the jackal and the dog-headed ape. Or, possibly, as there is question of a standard, the familiar wp ir/ir/ has displaced the ape. Cf. L. D. IV, 55 c. (3) His similar association with the 6//-ape may have brought about his connection with the wn-sb. (4) The only reference to any centre of the cult of Chons outside Thebes in the M.

It is not possible to explain why Thebes became a centre of moon- cult. It might be conjectured, perhaps, that, in some unex plained fashion, looh, the moon, was primitively identified with a local god in Thebes, who then took on a special lunar name, and lunar qualities, and, either because his usual symbol had been a human form, or because it was natural to represent the increasing new moon by the symbol of a youth or child, (i) came to be represented in human form as a young man or a child. The association of Chons with Amon and Mut at Thebes as their child is, probably, of secondary origin. It was inevitable that Chons and Thoth should, in the course of time, be associated and gradually identified with each other. Their identification is not usual, however, until the period of the New Kingdom a fact from which it may be inferred &quot;that either or both gods possessed something more than merely lunar character. What was true of sun-worship was probably true also, to some extent, of moon-worship. The cult of the moon-god was centered in certain shrines by a process of assimilation between the moon-god and local di vinities, in which the local divinities retained something of their old non-lunar character. In the case of Chons the old The name is clearly connected with the verb which is written in the Pyramid texts A/wLv^jy.

In the New Kingdom their common element brought the two gods closely together, and ultimately led to their identification, (i) Through this identification the popularity of Chons increased and his worship extended widely outside Thebes. (2) From the 20 th dynasty on Chons constantly assumes activities of Thoth, and appears frequently as lord of script and literature, and as judge - - like Thoth. It is to be noted that Chons played no part in the Horus- Set legend, though, as moon-god, he might naturally have been expected to hold some place in the diama of the great struggle between light and darkness. This is one of the many points which go to show that Thoth s part in that legend is not due solely to his lunar character. It illustrates, too, the influence of local circumstance on the development of. early sagas. Before the great intensification of Chons-cult in the Ramesside age had begun Thoth, the rival of Chons, had become universally established in the worship of Egypt through his connection with the Osirian drama. Of the epithets of Chons which belong to him in his own right the most common perhaps, is pi iri x/jnr.(3) This (0 There is a Cairo ostracon of 2uth. dyn. containing a prayer to Chons- Thoth, the Ibis&quot; (\\\\ b. 91.

The increased importance and popularity of Chons in the Ramesside period, and later, may be due largely, as suggested in the text, to his fusion with Thoth. but it must alsj be regarded as possible that Thoth, on his side, derived new importance from his identification with the Theban Chons.

The measuring of time suggests the determining of fate. The office of Chons as healer or physician (as illustrated, for instance, in the nar rative of the Bentresh-stele) may possibly belong to him as moon-god, but more probably it is due either to his identi fication with Thoth, the physician of the Eye of Horus, or to the pride of his Theban worshippers who wished thus to make him at least as great as the moon-god of Hermopolis. In the texts of the Graeco-Roman period Chons and Thoth are frequently identified and Thoth -attributes are freely transferred to Chons. In Edfu they are identified not merely with each other but also with the god of Edfu, the winged sun-disc Horus Bhdti. They appear there in falcon- shape and receive the epithets of Horus. (i) At an early date Chons of Thebes was thrown together with Shu, and the two divinities were there often looked on as one. (2) Both were gods of light and their identification was inevitable when Shu began to be especially honoured at Thebes. Shu is the god of the light-space between earth and heaven : (3) as such he separates earth and heaven at the dawn, (4) and in separating them he seems to raise up and hold aloft the heavens. As bearer of the heavens Shu was identified by the Greeks with Herakles. Chons, then, as one with Shu was also identified with Herakles. Shu was one of the two &quot;lion-gods&quot;, and thus, too, Chons came to be repre sented sometimes as a lion. The identification of Thoth with Shu in Philae, and in Nubian inscriptions generally, may be due, in some measure, to the identification of Chons and Shu in Thebes ; but it may be due also - - if not solely - - to the part played by Thoth in the legend of Onuris. Shu and Onuris are one, and Thoth, like Onuris, is &quot;he who fetches (1) Gf. Edfu R. I, 275 where the epithets of Chons-Thoth are very similar to those of the Nubian Thoth-Arhensnuphis (Omirislcgende, pp. 7 12). Cf. also the long passage about Chons Edfu. R. II, 67 f. (2) Cf.

It would seem that her appearance in the Thoth-shrines at Hermopolis Magna and in the i5th.

When all the evidence dealing with the person and acti vities of Nhm-t-wtt has been weighed, it would seem as if she were, in most contexts, nothing more than Hathor con sidered as goddess of law and justice. It is as a personification of justice that she becomes a companion of Thoth, and a dweller in Thoth s chief centres.

Her name SsJ t means simply &quot;the Writer&quot;. The importance of the scribes profession in Egypt at all times must have led very early, indeed, to the setting up of a spe cial divinity as patroness of scribes a sort of deification of the scribal art. Whether this divinity of the scribes was always looked upon as an aspect, or mode of appearance, of one or other of the great goddesses of the Osirian cycle Nephthys, or Hathor, we do not know. It is possible that her identi fication with other great divinities is secondary. In the texts of the later periods - - particularly in those of Dendereh - she is constantly identified with Hathor. In Edfu she appears sometimes, just as she does in the Pyramids, as one with Nephthys. (i) The functions of S.sl-t greatly resembled some of those of Thoth.

(2) The similarity of their work brought Thoth and Ssl-t together, and sometimes Ss?-t is called the daughter, (3) and sometimes the sister (4) of Thoth. Epithets of Thoth tended to pass over to Ssl-t, and so it is not surprising to find her called Ji r-t hk*n&amp;gt; (5) &quot;Scribe of the Great Ennead&quot;, (6) and &quot;president of the Ht-ibt&quot;. (7) Neither is it strange to find her acting as a goddess of fate in cooperation with the Hsbw (the &quot;Reckoner&quot;, /. e. he who determines the sti == he who decrees fate). (8) The similarity of her work with that of the &quot;Lord of Hmnw&quot; has made her the &quot;Lady of Hmnn&amp;gt;&quot;. (9) Just as it is unjustifiable to look on Nhm-t-Wi as a divinity invented by the Egyptian priests as a counterpart, or female double, of Thoth, so neither are we justified in ac cepting the view suggested by Foucart (10) that the origin of a goddess of writing in addition to Thoth was due to the developing outlook of Egyptian science - - it being felt that, as knowledge expanded, one god was not sufficient to deal with it all. The existence of a worship and a priesthood of Ssl-t in the O. K. tells strongly against such a theory. s!-t had her own importance in the early period, out of all rela tion to Thoth, as the patroness of the ancient scribes. The most persistent of the epithets applied to Ssl-t is sfh-t e bm which, apparently, ought to mean &quot;She that puts off (or releases) the two horns&quot;.

Besides what could possibly be the meaning of the &quot;Seven of the Two Horus&quot; Sfh cannot well be regarded then, as connected here in any way with the word for &quot;seven&quot;. (2) Ihe epithet sfh-t bwi does not help to explain the asso ciation of Sslt with Thoth. The ground of their association is, however, not far to seek. Silt, the Egyptian Clio, is a more or less abstract divinity who was brought into close association with Thoth, the lord of literature, in her character as a personification of the scribal art. (i) See article by Schiifer, A. Z. 42, p. 72 on Me,:?* in Horapollo II, 29, and the goddess Ssl.t. Horap. says that seven signs held by two fingers signify .Mo-jja, ani-.sov, AJotpa. The &quot;seven signs &quot; are clearly, according to Schiifer, the seven rays, and the two fingers are V. The idea of seven has arisen from a misunder standing of sfh (taking it as the numeral sfh). The &quot;rays&quot; must still remain un explained. SxU is Mo-J7x as head of libraries: she is iMotpa because she determines the length of royal reigns : she is araicov, perhaps, because the years of royal reign are predetermined as eternal. 2) Gardiner points out (Xotc.s on the story of Sinuiie, p. 105) that means &quot;loosen the arrow&quot; and that f b may be used metaphoric- ally for &quot;bow . Is it possible to discover any point of connection between the muse of history and a designation, &quot;She that releases the bows&quot; ? The seven &quot;rays&quot; of the headdress of Ssl.t remind one of the conical crown of the Sumerian goddess Bau, on which stood seven horns narrowing upwards to a point. Cf.
