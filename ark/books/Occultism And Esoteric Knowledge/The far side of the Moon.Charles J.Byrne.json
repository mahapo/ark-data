Throughout human history, the far side of the Moon has been so near, its presence so obvious, and yet so hidden. It was only in the decade of the 1960s that we have been able to observe it, as opposed to inferring its existence. I have been fortunate to live during the period when the far side became visible and has been extensively examined by means that were not even known 50 years ago. During this time, we have learned much but of course we have asked new questions about secrets still hidden on the Moon. Some of these secrets will be revealed in the course of future exploration and robotic spacecraft missions. This book is about what we now know of the far side of the Moon, about what the current questions are, and about some possible answers. It is a companion book to The Lunar Orbiter Photographic Atlas of the Near Side of the Moon , my first book (Byrne, 2005), also published by Springer in 2005. Together, these books cover the entire Moon in photographs taken by the robotic spacecraft that have done much of their work behind the Moon, out of communica- tion with Earth for half of their orbital periods. The photographs of the near side book were taken by a single mission of the Lunar Orbiter project, Lunar Orbiter 4 that was flown in 1967. This book is primarily com- posed of photographs from each of the Lunar Orbiter missions of the National Aero- nautics and Space Administration (NASA) and from the Clementine mission of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). In addition, it contains images from the Russian Luna 3 and Zond 3, NASA’s Apollo 16, and Japan’s Nozomi. The Clementine mission provided a comprehensive survey of altitude, albedo (intrinsic brightness), and multispectral data in 1994. Lunar Prospector provided gamma ray spectroscopy in 1998. The data from these spacecraft have added insight into the mineral composition of the lunar surface (supported by ground truth from analysis of lunar rocks and soil returned by Apollo and Luna missions). Clementine imagery is used extensively in this book where it is superior in topographic resolution or uniformity of coverage. The reason for using photos from so many missions is that there has not been a single mission to systematically take pictures to show the topography of the far side of the Moon. Yet it has been possible to provide complete coverage of the far side by assembling photos from many sources. Many years ago, I had the pleasure of working on the Lunar Orbiter project, representing the Apollo program in its search for safe and interesting landing sites. I worked for Bellcomm, a contractor to NASA headquarters. The Lunar Orbiter project was amazingly successful for the time, providing extensive new images in five out of five missions. This performance is a credit to Boeing, the prime contrac- tor and manufacturer of the spacecraft, to Eastman Kodak, who made the camera system, and to the project management team at NASA’s Langley Research Center, directed by Lee Scherer of NASA headquarters. The Langley team, who included Cliff Nelson, Israel Taback, and Norm Craybill, later managed the Viking project, which sent the first lander to Mars. The limited scanning technology of the time resulted in artifacts in the images that distract a viewer. There are bright lines running across the mosaics between framelets and brightness variations from the spacecraft’s scanner that appear as streaks within the framelets. Lunar scientists have become used to these artifacts, but they detract from the value to students and casual observers. Preface Preface v"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Since the first photos were received, I have wanted to clean up the scanning artifacts. Advances in the art of computation and the capacity of modern com- puters has enabled processing of the photos to remove nearly all of the scanning artifacts, resulting in clear images that are much easier to view. Drawing on an understanding of the nature of the artifacts, I have written a software program that measures and compensates for the systematic artifacts and designed a filter that further reduces them, with minimal impact on the images of the Moon. This process is described in Appendix A. It was with great satisfaction that, with the publication of this book, I have com- pleted the publication of a comprehensive set of cleaned photographs from the Lunar Orbiter project. The photos are those that were selected by D. E. Bowker and J. K. Hughes for their book Lunar Orbiter Photographic Atlas of the Moon (Bowker, 1971). All of the far side photographs of Lunar Orbiter and the other photographs in the book are on the enclosed Compact Disc. A CD with the near side photo- graphs was provided with my near side book. While preparing these two books, I attended a series of yearly meetings of the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC), sponsored by the Lunar and Plan- etary Institute, a NASA contractor. In the course of these meetings, where lunar and planetary scientists report on their current work, I became interested in the differences between the near and far sides of the Moon, and the attempts to explain that difference. Consequently, while preparing for this book on the far side, I took some time off to see if I could contribute to this question. It turned out that my back- ground in communication research, specifically the art of finding signals in noise, led to a new hypothesis, with supporting quantitative evidence. I took the approach that a giant basin on the near side would be a signal, a pattern of elevation data, and that the subsequent history of bombardment of the Moon would be noise, ran- dom perturbations of the signal. Just as noise adds to a signal in communications, the principle of superposition establishes that the characteristic form of an impact adds to the form of an earlier basin, especially one of a much larger scale. Accordingly, I modeled the elevation signal that would be produced by a giant basin, and varied the characteristics of such a basin, much like tuning a radio, until the maximum signal-to-noise ratio was found. Then the Near Side Megabasin revealed itself. This resulted in the parameters of the Near Side Megabasin that I reported to LPSC 2006 (Byrne, 2006). The method of this analysis is described in Chap. 13. It remained to explain the crustal thickness data, which was qualitatively in agreement with the Near Side Megabasin, but in quantitative disagreement with the parameters I had first estimated (Byrne, 2006) by nearly an order of magnitude. Fortunately, I was able to contact H. Hikida and M. A. Wieczorek, who are actively studying the crustal thickness problem (Hikida, 2007), and they generously shared their new data. This reinforced the qualitative agreement with the ejecta that would be generated by the Near Side Megabasin, but also reiterated the quantitative disagreement. The point that I had missed in 2006 was that the Moon was soft and easily deformed in the early times when the megabasins were formed. This has long been known (Lemoine, 1997) but not by me. The great weight of the ejecta on the far side would have caused it to sink, retaining its shape, but not its scale. This phenomenon is known as isostatic compensation. Given the accepted densities of the mantle and crust, isostatic compensation would cause the ejecta of the Near Side Megabasin to sink into the mantle, leaving only one-sixth of the initial depth of the deposit, accounting for the quantitative discrepancy. The implication of the crustal thickness data is that both the cavity of the Near Side Megabasin and its ejecta would have been six times deeper at the time of its formation, before isostatic compensation, than the current topography would require. This new modification to the Near Side Megabasin hypothesis is in quantitative agreement with all the relevant data that I have been able to review, and it answers many questions about the topography and crustal thickness of the Moon. I hope that it will be a lasting contribution to the understanding of the Moon, and that it will stimulate further questions and topics of research. Several sources contributed to the digital imagery in this book. Lunar Orbiter pho- tography has been archived as hard copy photographs, each about 60 cm (about 2 ft) Preface vi"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"wide, at each NASA Regional Planetary Image Facility, including one at LPI in Houston, Texas. LPI has digitized this important archival source and published the images in the Digital Lunar Orbiter Phot ographic Atlas of the Moon on the LPI Web site (http://www.lpi.usra.edu). Further, the LPI staff has added annotations to the photos, outlining nearly all of the named features. A team led by Jeff Gillis carried out this important work (Gillis, 2002); Jeff was supported by Washington University at St. Louis and is currently with the Univer- sity of Hawaii. LPI technical and administrative support was provided by Michael S. O’Dell, Debra Rueb, Mary Ann Hager, and James A. Cowan with assistance from Sandra Cherry, Mary Cloud, Renee Dotson, Kin Leung, Jackie Lyon, Mary Noel, Bar- bara Parnell, and Heather Sco tt. The selection of photos that were made available on the LPI Digital Archive is that selected for Lunar Orbiter Photographic Atlas of the Moon by Bowker and Hughes (Bowker, 1971). NASA, NRL, the Russian space agency, and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) have made public the base data for the photos in this book. Processed images were downloaded from web sites at NRL, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Ricardo Nunes and Phil Stookes have contributed mosaics. Photos with annotated overlays identify the major features within each of the photos. These overlays were extracted digitally from those published by LPI, but I made additions, especially for the Clementine images, in the style established by LPI. The names of features, both by LPI and myself, are aligned with the list approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), as maintained by Jennifer Blue of the USGS Astrogeology Branch. Notes with each photo point out salient aspects of the features. These notes, as well as those for my near side book, have been reviewed by Don Wilhelms, USGS retired, the author of my primary reference, who has taught me a great deal about lunar geology. The assignments of geological age to many far side features are derived from his book, which has contributions by John McClauley and Newell Trask (Wilhelms 1987). A reference that I used heavily in the preparation of this book is The Clementine Atlas of the Moon by Ben Bussey and Paul Spudis (Bussey, 2004). The dimensions of features (except for basins) are taken from this book, which in turn is based on the IAU catalog at USGS. Of course, I am personally responsible for any errors in this final book. The combination of cleaned photos, labeled features, and notes are intended to serve as powerful aids to learning the geography of the Moon as well as valuable reference material. My love and gratitude go to my wife Mary, who read and re-read the early drafts of this book and made many helpful comments. Throughout the project of cleaning the photos and writing this book helpful sug- gestions and comments were made by Tammy Becker, Jeff Gillis, Mary Ann Hager, Ray Hawke, Paul Spudis, Ian Garrick-Bethell, Mark Robinson, Peter Schultz, Ewen Whitaker, and Don Wilhelms.

The Far Side Unknown: A Mystery The far side of the Moon is the side that we cannot see from Earth. Because the rotation of the Moon is locked in syn- chronism as it revolves around Earth, its near side always faces Earth. If people lived on the Moon, those who lived on the near side would always see Earth and those who lived on the far side would never see it. This situation (which is common to the large moons of all planets) has led to an aura of mystery about the far side of the Moon ever since humans thought about the night’s illumination. When humanity thought it was at the center of the universe, this condition seemed natural enough, but when the Copernican view of the solar system prevailed, there was a period when people wondered what the far side might be like. Was there a pattern there like the one on the near side? Was it completely different? Was it colored, like Mars, or nearly colorless like the near side? Were there seas and oceans, as once were thought to be on the near side? The near side of the Moon is a symbol of romance. The far side has often been called the dark side of the Moon, as if our inability to see it meant that it was never lit (it receives as much sunlight as the near side). As an example of our feel- ings, in the enormously popular album “The Dark Side of the Moon” by Pink Floyd, the far side of the Moon is a symbol for depression, for alienation. When space probes Luna 3, Zond 3, and Lunar Orbiter 1 transmitted images back to Earth (Figure 1.1), it became apparent that the nature of the far side of the Moon was indeed very different from that of the near side. Many ques- tions were answered, but many new ones were raised. 1.2. The Far Side Revealed: A New Mystery Surprisingly, there were only a few patches of mare on the far side. There was no “Woman in the Moon” to travel with the “Man in the Moon.” It was more like we were seeing the back of the head of the Man in the Moon. The far side of the Moon is remarkably uniform at first view, heavily cratered and with little variation in brightness (Figures 1.2 and 1.3). Even before the Clementine mission, examination of the Lunar Orbiter photography identified a number of large basins on the far side including the giant South Pole-Aitken Basin. Many of these basins are outlined in Figure 1.4, and are shown in great detail in photographs and images of this book. Now we knew more about both similarities and differences between the near side and the far side. Mysteries were resolved, but the new mystery was how the striking differences in the two sides of the Moon came about. The differences are so great that Robert Lepage used the contrast as a metaphor in his film “Far Side of the Moon” for extreme differences between personalities and to the competitive space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. Since the polar orbit was oriented so that the sun was directly behind Clementine as it passed over the Moon’s equator, the images show the inherent brightness (albedo) of the Moon. Shadows appear only near the poles. Figures 1.2 and 1.3 are lambert equal-area projections. 1.3. The Current View of the Far Side This book provides comprehensive coverage of the far side of the Moon, the only book that has been dedicated to the far side alone. It is a guide to the different regions of the far side and the interactions among the features there. Photographs from the five Lunar Orbiter missions provide most of the coverage in this book. The photographs pre- sented here have been computer-processed to remove the artifacts introduced in scanning them in the spacecraft and reproducing them on Earth and are cleaner and easier to understand than the photos that have been used in research for the past 40 years. The cleaning process is described in Appendix A. Although the primary purpose of the five Lunar Orbiter missions was to survey the near side in preparation for the Apollo landings, they covered all of the far side as well. Photographs from several other space missions are included, especially where they provide coverage that complements that of the Lunar Orbiter missions. In par- ticular, photos from the Clementine missions cover the Polar Regions. Chapter 1 The Far Side of the Moon"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" The Far Side of the Moon 2 Figure 1.1.

Consequently, there is little information about the shape of the surface except near the poles, where the sun angle is more favorable to showing the topogra- phy and the images are superior to the Lunar Orbiter photos."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" The Far Side of the Moon 3 The Apollo missions also had a subordinate mission to photograph the far side. Because of their equatorial orbits and lighting conditions, their excellent photographs are limited to the equatorial region from the cent ral near side, around the eastern limb, to the central far side. Con- sequently, only a few of the Apollo photographs appear here. The far side is divided into regions based on the fea- tures that have influenced them. The form of presentation changes in each chapter to accommodate the nature of the photography since it is derived from a number of different missions. Notes describe interesting aspects of each image, explaining the geologic nature and relative ages of the features, with special attention to the nature of their interactions.

The Near Side Megabasin The main purpose of this book is to provide comprehensive images of the far side of the Moon produced by the Lunar Orbiter, Clementine, and Apollo missions. But in organizing the material, my interest turned to seeking an explanation for the dichotic nature of the Moon. Is there an explanation for the dramatic differences between the near and far sides? Astrophysicists and astronomers have been puzzling over this question ever since the evidence arrived. An early hypoth- esis, first put forward by Wood in 1973 (Wood, 1973), is that a large impact on the near side has thrown its ejecta onto the far side. Since then, Cadogan (Cadogan, 1974) suggested the Gargantuan Basin, Whitaker (Whitaker, 1981) proposed the even larger Procellarum Basin, and Lucey suggested a basin centered in the southeast of the near side (Feldman, 2002). None of these hypotheses were accompanied by convincing topographic evidence, and in time, all proposals, while not completely refuted, where not confirmed either. Figure 1.4. The Clementine view of the far side of the Moon in a geometric projection (a graph of latitude against longitude). Many of the basins are shown here to provide reference points. The basins near the poles appear elongated by the stretching of the projection. NRL base map."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" The Far Side of the Moon My personal search for a large near side basin found a site that had not previously been considered, and a size that far exceeded previous proposals. A model of this feature, scaled up from the shapes of lunar basins, fit the evidence of the Moon’s unusual form, as measured by the laser-ranging LIDAR instrument carried by Clementine. This hypothetical impact, which I have informally called the Near Side Megabasin (Figure 1.5), provides a quanti- tatively supported explanation of the differences between the near and far sides of the Moon. The supporting evi- dence for the Near Side Megabasin is provided in Chapter 13, at the end of this book. Its center is to the northeast of the center of the Moon as we see it, at 8.5° north latitude and 22° east longitude. The interior of this basin covers more than half of the Moon; its rim is nearly all over on the far side. It has covered all of the far side with its ejecta, creating a mound that is currently about 5 km thick in the region opposite to the Near Side Megabasin’s center (its antipode). In short, this feature apparently dominated the nature of both the entire far side and the entire near side and is a potential explanation for the major differences between the two. Throughout this book, the major influence of the Near Side Megabasin is mentioned in the notes on the photo- graphs and marked on some of the photos. If this feature is confirmed by further examination, this book will serve as an early documentation of it. Should it be refuted, then the mystery will remain but this book will still serve as a com- prehensive photographic guide to all other features on the far side of the Moon. Figure 1.5. This cartoon illustrates how the current shape of the Moon may have come about. It is suggested (Byrne, 2006, 2007) that a very large comet or asteroid (perhaps 600 km in diameter or more) struck the Moon at the point that is now at 8.5° north latitude and 22° east longitude. The impact excavated a cavity that covers more than half the Moon, nearly all of the near side except a small area near the southwest limb. The ejecta con- centrated at the antipode of the point of impact, forming a large bulge. The elevations in this figure are exaggerated. See Chapter 13 for more detail on the Near Side Megabasin. 4"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" The Spacecraft Missions and Images 5 2.1. Spacecraft Programs This chapter describes the programs that have contributed photography to this book on the far side of the Moon. It does not discuss the missions that have been limited to the near side, where much has been learned in detailed examination of the surface and sample return. The missions are described in chronological order. Luna 3 and Zond 3 The former Soviet Union launched two flybys of the Moon: Luna 3 in October, 1959 and Zond 3 in July, 1965. Luna 3 covered the western part of the far side and Zond 3 covered the eastern part of the far side (beyond the western limb, as we see it from Earth). Between them, they photographed most of the far side. Lunar Orbiter The series of five NASA Lunar Orbiter missions, starting with Lunar Orbiter I in August, 1966, provided improved res- olution and picture quality, covering nearly the entire Moon. The photos these spacecraft returned showed us the topogra- phy of the Moon and provided the primary observations for the comprehensive geologic analysis performed by the USGS Astrogeology Branch and others. This photographic record is still the starting point for research on the topographic fea- tures of the Moon. Lunar Orbiter I took the famous picture of the Earth, looking back from beyond the Moon; in a sense, this was the first self-portrait of our planet. Most of the pho- tographs in this book are from the Lunar Orbiter missions. Each of the missions has provided some of the total coverage of the far side of the Moon. Apollo The Apollo program made many contributions to our under- standing of the Moon, including the photographic coverage taken from lunar orbit by cameras in the Co mmand Module. They provided the first photographic negatives returned to Earth, free of the artifacts introduced by transmission from the Moon. Because of Apollo mission’s constraints, these photos were limited in their coverage to a band near the lunar equator. The far side photos were further limited by the lighting conditions to about 110° from the East Limb of the Moon. The first color pictures of the Earth from beyond the Moon were taken by Apollo 10, a manned mission into lunar orbit that was a rehearsal for the series of landing mis- sions begun by Apollo 11 in July, 1969. In the later Apollo mis- sions (15, 16, and 17) panoramic and mapping cameras joined the hand-held Hasselblad cameras to provide more systematic coverage, within the mission constraints. Apollo photographs in this book provide broad coverage of parts of the East Limb. Clementine In 1994, after more than 20 years of analyzing the results from the earlier mission, the Naval Research Laboratory launched the Clementine spacecraft. This spacecraft entered a near- polar orbit, and while the Moon rotated under its orbital plane, achieved uniform coverage of the entire Moon. This was the first mission to cover the Moon in a way that provided “the big picture.” The images showed the Moon in a way that permitted direct comparison of the near and far sides; until then, equiva- lent views were manually constructed by airbrushed representa- tions of rectified photographs. In addition to the visual imagery, Clementine carried multispectral sensors that provided data about mineral composition of the surface. A laser altimeter (LIDAR) carried by Clementine provided an accurate measure- ment of the elevations of the Moon’s surface, at a resolution of about 0.25° (about 7.5 km). Clementine images are used in this book for the polar sections and broad coverage of the South Pole-Aitken Basin. Lunar Prospector In 1998, NASA launched the Lunar Prospector spacecraft, which introduced a novel instrument that measured the energy spectrum of solar neutrons that rebounded from the lunar surface. Comparison of the spectrum of the rebound- ing neutrons from the Moon with the spectrum of neutrons directly from the sun showed the distribution of energy lost from the collisions with the nuclei of the elements on the sur- face, and therefore their atomic weight. The resulting distri- bution of thorium was a clue in the development of the Near Side Megabasin proposal. Although results from Lunar Pros- pector are discussed, this book does not contain images that are derived from the Lunar Prospector instruments, because they are best presented in false color (Prettyman, 2007). Nozomi Nozomi was launched toward Mars on July 3, 1998, by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). On its way, looking back toward Earth, it took a picture of the far side Chapter 2 The Spacecraft Missions and Images"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" The Far Side of the Moon 6 of the Moon. Unfortunately, the maneuver to insert Nozomi into Mars orbit was unsuccessful, but the project achieved a unique view of the Moon. 2.2. The Images It is not so easy to obtain imagery from space, mostly with highly automated spacecraft that encounter an environment that is very unlike that on Earth, but must return what they sense to earth for interpretation by scientists. Each program solves its problems in its own way, accomplishing the goals of its investigators using the techno logy available to its design- ers. Keep in mind that the robotic spacecraft collected all of the imagery of the far side of the Moon while out of communi- cation with Earth. In the case of some of the missions, human operators had extensive control from orbit to orbit, but the spacecraft and their instruments were on their own when they were behind the Moon. With the historic record available to us, we are free to inte- grate the products of these missions for our own goals, to make them available to more people. With that background in mind, let us survey the imagery available to form a view of the far side of the Moon. Luna 3 and Zond 3 The Luna 3 and Zond 3 spacecraft used vidicon cameras to take single frames of images, store them in memory during their flybys, and transmit them to Earth. Expecting a pattern like that of the front side of the Moon, and needing bright illumination, the mission planners scheduled their flybys when the sun would be high. Luna 3 continued on past the Moon and transmitted as much as it could of its memory at long range. Zond 3 returned toward (but not to) Earth and had better communications geometry. Ricardo Nunes, an amateur astronomer in Portugal, cre- ated mosaics of individual images from these two spacecraft. (see Figures 2.1 and 2.2). Both mosaics have been produced by image processing techniques developed in our own times, long after the images were obtained and examined. Lunar Orbiter The Lunar Orbiter spacecraft provided two innovations for lunar imagery. First, they carried retro-rockets to inject them into orbits around the Moon, just as spacecraft orbited earth. This allowed for an extended mission, so that the lighting could be optimal for a large range of lunar longitudes. Second, they used photographic film to record the images. The nega- tives were developed on the sp acecraft, using a Bimat process whereby the negative was placed in contact with a second emulsion carrying developing solution. The developed nega- tives were scanned by a combination of mechanical and elec- tronic techniques, transmitted to Earth, and the image was reconstructed there. This permitted a combination of high resolution with broad coverage, far more than vidicon tubes could provide, and even more than today’s electronic cam- eras that use CCD technology. Each Lunar Orbiter exposure consisted of two frames taken by different lenses in two positions on the same strip of film. One image was called high-resolution (limited cov- erage) and the other medium-resolution (wider coverage) (Figure 2.3). The relation between the two frames is shown in Figure 2.4. Depending on the orientation of the spacecraft, the H1 frame can be either to the north or to the south, as shown. Figure 2.1.

The gray area in an arc along the right edge of the Moon is Oceanus Procellarum."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" The Spacecraft Missions and Images 7 The preexposed calibration strip, shown on the left here, is on the right if the H1 frame is to the north. Phil Stooke of the University of Western Ontario has assem- bled a mosaic of Lunar Orbiter photos that cover the entire far side (Figure 2.5). He has converted each of these photo- graphs into a common projection, selected the best area of each photo, and harmonized the brightness and contrast to produce the mosaic. This is an unusual image because it repre- sents the spherical Moon as if it was illuminated at a constant sun angle everywhere. It demonstrates the full coverage of the Lunar Orbiter missions, at their various orbital altitudes. Of course, the resolution varies from point to point. In the photography of the near side, the high-resolution images were contiguous for selected targets, with the medium-resolution images providing context. On Lunar Orbiter 4, the mission accomplished contiguous high-reso- lution coverage for the entire near side of the Moon. The far side photos were arranged to give contiguous coverage with medium-resolution photos from all five missions. There- fore, the high-resolution photos provided only sampling on the far side and only occasionally overlap. When they do overlap, this book often presents them as mosaics. The entire process of transmitting imagery for Lunar Orbiter was analog. Only recently have these pictures been digitized. This was done by the Lunar Planetary Institude (LPI), using a digital camera on the large hard copy pho- tographs archived at the Regional Planetary Image Facility (RPIF) there. The equivalent number of pixels across the width of the hard copy originals is about 5,000. The digitized images provide about 900 pixels in width. The precise count of pixels varies from frame to frame, since the pictures were taken with small margins and then cropped. The process of scanning the negatives in the spacecraft and reconstructing them on the ground introduced artifacts that degrade the visual quality of the images (Figure 2.6). Fortunately, the noise introduced by the artifacts is mostly in the north-south direction, while the signal pro- duced by the slanting sunlight is mostly in the east-west direction. Therefore, it is possible to separate the signal from the noise and greatly increase the perceptual image quality (Figure 2.7). The method of doing this is described in Appendix A.

This figure shows the arrangement of the field of views of the frames taken by the Lunar Orbiter medium-resolution and high-resolution cameras. On the ground, the high-resolution frames were reconstructed in three subframes for easier handling by interpreters. The spacecraft was usu- ally oriented so that the top of each frame or subframe pointed approxi- mately to either the north or the south. By convention, the reconstructed frames are always oriented so that north is up. Figure 2.5. Mosaic of the far side of the Moon constructed of Lunar Orbiter photographs from all five missions.

The cleaned images are all provided in the Compact Disc accompanying this book and their use for research and talks is encouraged. Apollo Apollo 16 took photos with three cameras, the mapping camera, the panoramic camera, and the hand-held Hasselblad. Figure 2.8 shows a mosaic of two successive exposures of the mapping camera. Apollo 15, 16, and 17 carried mapping cameras. Clementine Clementine’s CCD camera system was very different from the Lunar Orbiters’ film cameras. All the Clementine images in this book are mosaics constructed from the UV–vis (ultra- violet and visible range) camera. It took a field of view of 4.2° × 5.6° with an array of 288 × 384 pixels. The camera took a series of contiguous frames as the motion of the spacecraft moved in its polar orbit. The camera recorded overlapping images on the next orbit, as the Moon rotated beneath the spacecraft orbital plane. The sc ans were assembled into a mosaic after being transmitted to Earth and the resulting image was smoothed and corrected for the orbital geometry at USGS. The resolution varied from 100 to 500 m. As mentioned above, the Clementine mission was designed for a high sun angle as the craft passed over the lunar equa- tor, a desirable situation for the multispectral imagery that distinguishes mineral composition. However, the topogra- phy is washed out in this condition (Figure 2.9). In the zones Figure 2.6.

Figure 2.9 shows a typical Clementine image in the equatorial area. The sun elevation is about 75°. Most of the shading is caused by albedo variations such as the dark shade of mare basalt contrasting with the light shade of highland anorthosite. Topography is washed out but rays of young craters are clearly shown. A particular characteristic of the Clementine imagery is that it is available at uniform resolution over the entire Moon, and is especially useful in organizing coverage of very large features like the South Pole-Aitken Basin. Figure 2.10 shows a Clementine image near the South Pole, where the sun elevation is low and reveals the topography.

As terms are introduced, they are shown in bold print. These terms are also defined in the glossary. 3.1. Origin of the Moon After considering other possibilities, the consensus view is that the Moon began as a small rocky planet sometimes called Theia (the goddess) after Theia Euryphaessa, the mother of Selene (the goddess of the Moon) in Greek mythol- ogy. Originally in an orbit somewhere near what is now the asteroid belt, interaction with other bodies disrupted that orbit and turned Theia toward the Sun. On the way, it encountered Earth, striking a glancing blow that vaporized, melted, and pulverized Theia and part of Earth’s crust. The Moon coalesced from that part of the resulting cloud that orbited Earth. Part of the evidence for this is the deficiency of volatile materials like water and sulfides in the Moon; they must have stayed in the cloud and were dissipated into space or back to Earth. 3.2. The Magma Ocean As the Moon coalesced, it would have formed a very hot molten body, nearly spherical but slightly oblate because of its rota- tion, and perhaps distorted additionally by the proximity of Earth’s gravity. The molten mixture of elements that existed in this early time, 4 billion years ago, is called the Magma Ocean . As the Magma Ocean cooled, the heavier compounds drifted toward the core and the lighter ones rose toward the surface. Some of the heaviest and most common elements like iron, perhaps in combination with some sulfur, settled to the core. Lighter elements, especially silicon and oxygen in the form of silicates of metals like aluminum, started to form a crust that established a discontinuity in density like that between the crust of Earth and its mantle. On Earth, that boundary is called the Mohorovicic ́ discontinuity. Our current understanding of the very early formation of the Moon does not explain the differences between its two sides. The difference must have come about later. 3.3. Bombardment Early in the history of the inner solar system, there was an extended period of heavy bombardment by bodies smaller than planets, probably fragments of bodies that were of planetary size or perhaps smaller that collided and fragmented. The asteroid belt may be a remainder of that period, composed of small bodies that achieved a relatively stable orbit. A significant fraction of that material was thrown toward the sun, impacting all of the rocky planets and their moons. This process is ongoing today, thankfully at a lesser rate but occasionally penetrating roofs and dent- ing cars, although more commonly splashing in the ocean. Such a body approaches a planet or moon with at least the escape velocity of the planet, the velocity that accounts for the potential energy lost as a body entered the planet’s gravity field. In the case of the Earth and Moon, typical impact velocities are about 20 km s −1 (12.5 miles per sec- ond), far greater than the speed of sound in solid material. The resulting collision is called a hypervelocity impact , causing a crater to be formed in the target surface that was in the way of the speeding impactor . 3.4. The Near Side Megabasin I propose that the Near Side Megabasin, an impact basin whose central depression covers more than half of the Moon, has differentiated the two sides of the Moon. It could have caused the depression on the near side (where the large maria occur) and also the thicker, mounded crust of the far side. The shape of the far side was, of course, further modi- fied by the South Pole-Aitken Basin to establish the current configuration. The general idea is not new (Wood, 1973; Cadogan, 1974; Whitaker, 1981), but the Near Side Mega- basin is larger than former proposals of the Gargantuan Basin and the Procellarum Basin and is of the appropriate scale to do the job. Oceanus Procellarum is entirely within this newly proposed basin, formed by the evolution of the internal depression. The rim of the depression is nearly all on the far side. The center of impact is not quite centered on the near side of the Moon but is at 8.5° north latitude and 22° east longitude. More detailed parameters, along Chapter 3 The History of the Moon and Its Features"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" The History of the Moon and Its Features 11 with the analysis leading to this hypothesis, are described in Chapter 13. In that chapter, a model of impact basins is presented and accepted scaling laws are used to show that the large-scale shape of the present Moon is consistent with the ejecta blanket that such a large basin would produce. The mound of ejecta on the far side conforms quite well with the shape of this model. The term megabasin is used in different technical con- texts to mean a depression in terrain (or a minimum of a mathematical function) that is so large that it contains smaller basins within it. In this sense, the Moon contains another megabasin, the South Pole-Aitken Basin, the result of another giant impactor striking the Moon. This impact occurred later than the earlier and larger one that is pro- posed to have produced the Near Side Megabasin. 3.5. The South Pole-Aitken Basin The South Pole-Aitken Basin extends for about 80° across the far side Southern Hemisphere. Its floor is largely exposed despite shallow deposits of mare in the floors of the deeper basins and craters within it. 3.6. Impact Features: Craters and Basins Craters produced by hypervelocity impacts all develop according to similar laws. Indeed, similar craters are observed from any explosive release of energy such as underground tests of nuclear bombs or explosive release of energy from volcanoes. The shapes of impact features are nearly indepen- dent of the nature of their impactors and nearly independent of the approach angle, if that angle is more than 25° from the horizontal. Some differences due to impactor composition are introduced by entry through an atmosphere, but that is not relevant to the Moon. There are three primary divisions of the features of an impact feature: the transient crater, the apparent crater, and the ejecta. The transient crater forms quickly, within seconds or minutes, de pending on size. It is roughly hemispherical below the surface and produces a turbulent zone of frac- tured, melted, and pulverized material in the target. Its diam- eter relative to that of the impactor depends on the gravity of the planet, but for Earth, estimates range from 5 to 10 times the diameter of the impactor. It follows, of course, that the impactor contributes less than 1% of the material that remains in the transient crater. The apparent crater is the cavity that is in the visible sur- face after the event. It results from the material that is removed when the expanding energy released by the impact reaches the surface and, not meeting further resistance, ejects a layer of the material there. The apparent crater is much shallower than the transient crater for large craters and basins. Ejecta is the material thrown out from the apparent crater. Some of this material forms a rim around the crater whose depth is about 20% of the depth of the apparent crater, measured from the original target surface. Ejected material that falls beyond this rim, out to about twice the rim radius from the center of the feature, forms a continuous deposit called the ejecta blanket. The depth of ejecta falls off rap- idly beyond the rim. This ejecta blanket often has ridges and troughs radial to the center of the apparent crater. Beyond the ejecta blanket, the ejected debris consists of powdery material that may produce plains and rays. Boulders that are ejected produce, upon landing, their own s econdary craters . These “secondaries” sometimes land in radial strings or chains, called catena . For a given type of target surface, crater morphology undergoes a progression from a simple symmetrical cavity to a cavity with a central peak, and then to a disrupted surface that forms an internal ring. Beyond a certain size, multiple rings appear both inside and outside of the appar- ent depression. Such impact features are called ringed basins. Lunar impact features larger than 300 km in diameter usu- ally exhibit rings (or arcs of rings) and those smaller than 300 km usually do not. Therefore, the term basin is used for features with diameters larger than 300 m and the term crater is used for features that are smaller. Throughout this book, attention is drawn to the examples of these structures and how the structures of neighboring impact features interact. The reader is encouraged to form personal views of the patterns of these structures. 3.7. Mare Basalt Some deep craters and basins on the far side, as well as most such features on the near side, are filled with mare material, lava extruded from below. As we have mentioned, there are fewer and smaller areas of mare on the far side, relative to that on the near side. The largest, in the central floor of the South Pole-Aitken Basin, is ab out the size of Mare Imbrium (1,023 km in diameter). T he Imbrium Bas in is filled all the way to its rim but the larger South Pole-Atken Basin just has concentrations of mare in the deeper craters and basins of its central floor. All other areas of mare on the far side are much smaller; the largest of them is Mare Moscoviense, 277 km in diameter. Mare material is basaltic, like our ocean floor. It originates from the heavier material in the mantle , which is richer in iron and magnesium and lacking in aluminum and silicates, in relation to the crust. As the Magma Ocean cooled, the man- tle material settled because of its higher density. However, radioactive elements of the uranium series liberated heat energy, remelting parts of the mantle. The molten material expanded, became less dense, and rose to the surface, where it cooled. The radioactive elements leave their signature: high concentrations of the products of radioactive decay of uranium, like thorium. A related set of elements is known as KREEP , for potassium (chemical symbol K), rare earth ele- ments (REE), and phosphorus (chemical symbol P). They tend to stick together, and are enriched when mantle rock is remelted, because they do not crystallize easily but they do melt easily. These two types of tracers, both detected in the maria, are telltales of the history of basalt that has come to the surface. The KREEP tells us that the material was remelted and the thorium tells us what remelted it."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" The Far Side of the Moon 12 The high concentrations of thorium in the mare material of the South Pole-Aitken Basin tells us that uranium, nor- mally low in the mantle, has been stirred up to be nearer the surface by the large transient crater of that basin. The same sort of turbulent lifting of heavy elements probably occurred beneath the floor of the Near Side Megabasin, which has an even stronger thorium and KREEP signature on its surface. 3.8. The Ages of the Lunar Features An interesting attribute of a lunar feature is the time it was formed. The ages of different features on the Moon are inferred from several sources. The most precise ages are determined from measurement of isotope ratios in our precious rock samples; association of the samples with specific features establishes their time of for- mation. Since no samples have been returned from the far side, estimates of the age of events there can only be determined by estimates of ages relative to features of the near side. When rock samples are unavailable, geologists have resort to less precise measures. For example, sharply defined fea- tures are recent because meteorite bombardment softens the edges of features by a process called mass-wasting . And counts of crater densities are used to estimate the time a sur- face has been exposed to bombardment. A very powerful principle used by geologists is superposi- tion . Where one feature overlays another, it is considered to be a younger feature, unless there is evidence to the contrary. There are exceptions. For example, an impact may throw a boulder from an older layer of rock onto a younger layer. But the general rule is useful, especially in the emplacement of the ejecta blanket of one basin on top of the ejecta layer of another. The vertical sequence of layers from different sources is called stratigraphy . The principle of superposition has other implications than aging. When one layer is deposited on another, the topography of the surface reflects the configuration of the lower layer, as modified by variations in depth of the upper layer. For example, it is sometimes possible to detect the shape of a crater that has been buried by an ejecta blanket. If a crater forms on a slope or rim of an earlier basin, its shape is superimposed on the earlier shape. Sometimes one event causes another, even though super- position is not involved. For example, the shock wave of a younger impact event can be seen to have caused a landslide at the rim of older nearby crater. The notes accompanying the photos in this book fre- quently point out examples of superposition and causality. Named Age Ranges of the Moon Systematic study of stratigraphy, together with other clues, establishes a chain of evidence that leads to a relative age range of most of the features of the Moon. These age ranges, called periods, are named for archetype features. In order from the oldest to the younger, they are the pre-Nectaria n Period , Nec- tarian Period , Early Imbrian Period , Late Imbrian Period , Eratosthenian Period , and Copernican Period . The impact of the Nectarian Basin defines the bound- ary between the pre-Nectarian and Nectarian Periods. The Imbrium Basin ev ent introduces the Early Imbrian Period and the Orientale Basin event (the youngest basin) begins the Late Imbr ian Period. The Eratosthenes crater is the archetype of the Eratosthenian Period and Copernicus is the archetype of the Copernican Period. The Early and Late Imbrian Period s are often called epochs. The far-flung ejecta of these giant basins overlaps and provides a precise means for judging relative ages. A summary of estimates for the absolute age of the periods of lunar history is given in Table 3.1 (Wilhelms, 1987). Of course, these absolute ages have uncertainty ranges, but these are not shown in the table. After the Orientale event 3.8 billion years ago, there were no further basins formed; in fact, all subsequent craters are smaller than 190 km in diameter. The time of heavy bombardment had passed. The ejecta blankets of the smaller craters formed in later times no longer over- lapped, except rarely. Relative ages of the younger features are established by judgements about the degree of ero- sion of them; they become less sharp as they are hit by the continuing arrival of small impactors. If a feature has a similar degree of erosion to the crater Eratosthenes, it is judged to be of the Eratosthenian Period. If it appears to be as fresh or fresher than the crater Copernicus, it is assigned to the Copernican Period. The designations of these age periods predate the views of the far side of the Moon and so they are all defined in refer- ence to features on the near side. The relative ages of far side features are based on the stratigraphic relations, fea- ture by feature, from one basin’s ejecta to another across the limbs all the way to the far side. For this purpose, especially important basins are Crisium, Orientale, and Imbrium, since their deposits fall on the far side. Features on the far side that are younger than the Orientale Basin are assigned to the Late Imbrian, Er atosthenian, or Copernican Periods depend- ing on the sharpness of their features (mass-wasting is a form of erosion that smoothes features with time) and on counts of subsequent (superposed) craters. A somewhat controversial indication of age among younger impact features (late in the Eratosthenian Period or early in the Copernican Period) is the presence of rays of bright material forming a star-shaped pattern. One hypoth- esis is that these rays dim uniformly with age and their pres- ence or absence can be used to establish relative age. This rule has met with contradiction; some craters that appear fresher than others have lesser rays. Period Age range (billions of years ago) Interval (millions of years) Pre-Nectarian 4.6 to 3.92 680 Nectarian 3.92 to 3.85 70 Early Imbrian 3.85 to 3.80 50 Late Imbrian 3.80 to 3.15 650 Eratosthenian 3.15 to ~1.0 ~2,150 Copernican ~1.0 to present ~1,000 Table 3.1. Estimates of absolute ages of the periods."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" The History of the Moon and Its Features 13 Recent research (Hawke, 2007) suggests that there are two mechanisms for rays to darken and fade. All rays start to darken with time because exposure of the fresh pow- dered material to the solar wind causes the iron in the grains to aggregate, absorbing radiation. In time, the effect stabilizes, reaching a condition called maturity. The second effect relates to impacts in areas composed of anorthositic highlands near maria. The anorthositic minerals are inher- ently lighter than the basaltic mare, even after they become mature. Consequently, they only dim as meteoroid bombard- ment mixes the rays with the substrate, a process that takes much longer than the solar wind effect. These rays are called compositional rays. The time required to thoroughly mix a compositional ray with its substrate so that it fades depends on the thickness of the ray, and therefore on the size of the associated impact feature. The suggestion has been made that the duration of the Copernican Period be redefined in light of the new under- standing. It is proposed (Hawke, 2007) that the start of the Copernican Period be defined to be the time of the impact event of Copernicus, whose rays are now nearly mature but have bright compositional contrast. In the past, Copernicus has served as the archetype crater of the Copernican Period, which was allowed to extend prior to the Copernicus impact event. It will be interesting to see how this proposal is adopted in future geologic research and mapping work. If it is, then craters that are located on the far side, provided they are out- side of the South Pole-Aitken Basin and the very small other areas of mare, will be considered Copernican only if they have visible (immature) rays. This is because the composition of those areas of the far side is very uniform, so that the appear- ance of compositional rays blends into that of the substrate. Since the discovery of the South Pole-Aitken Basin and the proposal of the Near Side Megabasin, it might be useful to designate new periods to decompose the pre-Nectarian Period. For example, one could define a period between the first formation of the lunar crust to the Near Side Megabasin event, a period between that event and the South Pole-Ait- ken Basin event, and a period between that event and the Nectaris Basin event."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" The Far Side of the Moon 14 The photographs presented in this book are grouped into regions, as shown in Figure 4.1. Each region is covered in one chapter. In the order of their chapters, they are the following. 4.1. The Western Far Side Region This chapter includes photographs of the Earth taken from space, as well as the basins along the limb. The large craters Tsiolkovskiy and Gagarin are in this region, as is the Men- deleev Basin. 4.2.

It contains the largest concentrations of mare on the far side. The South Polar Region includes craters whose floors are permanently shadowed and show a high concentration of hydrogen. Some of this hydrogen may be in the form of water ice crystals just below the surface. 4.4.

Identification of Named Features In general, each chapter covers its region with two sets of images, those intended for overlapping, contiguous coverage, and those that are samples at higher resolution. Each con- tiguous coverage image is presented twice, once with anno- tations and once unmarked. Annotated Images The annotated images show the named features recognized by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Each fea- ture is outlined, either by the staff of the Lunar and Plan- etary Institute or by the present author. A few small named features (less than 50 km in diameter) are not annotated, for practical reasons. Since the images overlap, some fea- tures appear on more than one image. All annotated fea- tures are listed in an index. Spelling of Feature Names The spelling of the feature names is that of the IAU, as it appears in the catalog maintained by the United States Geo- logical Survey (USGS). The text follows the conventions of the annotations. In some cases, the spelling of IAU names differs from the spelling used in the text, when persons the features are named for are mentioned. An example of this distinction is that one far side crater is called Tsiolkovskiy, while the text refers to Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky, the Russian rocket scientist. The spelling is the same in Russian; the dif- ference lies in diverse transliteration rules used by the IAU and by translators to the English language. Features Identified on High- Resolution Images Only one copy of most of the high-resolution samples is pro- vided. To identify features that are referenced in the notes with minimal obscuration of the images, they are marked by short letter codes that are indicated both in the images and after the feature name in the text. Capital letters are used for IAU named features and small letters are used for other features mentioned in the notes. Lettered Craters Smaller craters of interest to researchers but too numerous to be assigned specific names are designated by the name of a nearby feature, followed by a single letter (Tsiolkovskiy W, for example). The IAU recognizes these designations. The lettered craters are not annotated in this book unless they are specifically mentioned in a note. On the near side of the Moon, these letters have not been assigned systematically. However, on the far side, a convention proposed by Ewen Whitaker (Whitaker, 1999) has been adopted. In this convention, the letter is chosen according to the approxi- mate direction from the named feature, using the 15° divisions of a 24-h clock face as a guide. The numbers 1 through 24 are replaced by the letters A through Z, with the omission of I and O. The direction indicated by Z points due north. 5.2. Identification of Basins The geologists of the USGS Astrogeology Branch maintain the names of basins. The IAU does not formally identify basins, partly because there is no universally accepted way to distin- guish small basins from large craters. Where a basin coincides with a named feature or surrounds a named mare, that name is adopted for the basin. Where it is not, the practice is to name the basin for two named craters near its periphery (the Keeler- Heaviside Basin, for example). On annotated images, basins with compound names are usually shown as dashed outlines. The rim of the Near Side Megabasin, as proposed by the present author, is indicated by dashed lines, in the same manner as the other basins. 5.3. Latitude and Longitude The latitude and longitude of each annotated image is indicated either by edge notes or by overlaid meridians and parallels.

Scale and Age Because so many of the images in this book are taken from high orbits and are often taken at oblique angles, scale changes widely within most of the images. A scale bar would be misleading. Consequently, care has been taken to identify the diameter of a few features within each image. The diameter and age of many features are given in a “key” table that accompanies the notes of each annotated image. The diameter is usually taken from the IAU catalog. The diameter of basins is as given by the USGS (Wilhelms, 1987). In some cases, these diameters differ slightly from the IAU diameters when a basin coincides with a named feature, but the USGS diameter is always used for basins, for consistency. The age period assigned to features is also taken from the USGS (color plates of Wilhelms, 1987). An attempt has been made to include all features named in these plates in the keys, as well as some features identified, but not named, on the plates."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" The Far Side of the Moon 18 6.1. Overview This region is west of the center of the far side, if you are looking toward Earth (as the Apollo astronauts were) but of course it is out of sight beyond the East Limb if you are on Earth looking toward the Moon. The region is the most heav- ily photographed part of the far side because it was sunlit when the Lunar Orbiters and the Apollo Command Modules passed over it in their near-equatorial orbits. Most of this region is shown in Figure 6.1. The Mendeleev Basin near the top dominates the view. The crater Tsiolkovs- kiy at the lower left contains one of the largest areas of dark, relatively fresh, mare pierced by its central peak. The crater is named after Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. “Tsiolkovsky” is the most common English transliteration of his name, but the International Astronomical Union, using another rule, des- ignates the crater’s name as Tsiolkovskiy. Tsiolkovsky was a Polish-Russian rocket and space flight theoretician in the early twentieth century. The crater Gagarin at the lower right has a smaller crater, Isaev, within its northwest sector. This crater has penetrated the floor of Gagarin and has produced a crustal weakness that permitted lava to penetrate and form a dark mare surface. Like nearly all of the far side, the area is completely cov- ered with impact craters; in fact, they obscure each other so that only the younger craters can be seen clearly. The older basin, Mendeleev, near the top of Figure 6.1 has probably had its floor flooded with mare, but then ejecta from younger basins has covered the dark mare with lighter material. This hidden feature is sometimes called cryptomare. The rim of the Near Side Megabasin runs through this region, at about 120° east longitude, a little west of Tsiolkovs- kiy and about a diameter west of Mendeleev. This rim, a rise of about a kilometer, runs along the sudden transition between the bright sunlit washed out area and the gray area to the right of the rim. 6.2. Photos Lunar Orbiter Medium-Resolution Frames The approximate coverage of the medium-resolution photos targeted for the Western Far Side region is shown in Figure 6.2. The actual medium-resolution photos are shown starting on page 21. All of the medium-resolution photos are shown before the corresponding high-resolution frames, to avoid breaking the continuity of contiguous coverage and annota- tion of the medium-resolution photos. A key table is provided to identify the dimensions and age of prominent features in each annotated picture. Lunar Orbiter High-Resolution Subframes There are three high-resolution subframes for each of the medium-resolution Lunar Orbiter frames that are labeled in Figure 6.2, and three such subframes for LO1-117M, whose principal ground point is off the chart. In each case, the high- resolution frame H2 is centered on the principal ground point, H1 is to the north of H2, and H3 is to the south of the central frame. The three subframes of LO1-102H and LO1-117H are reassembled into mosaics because they show the especially interesting photos of the Earth rising over the lunar horizon. The high-resolution photos are marked with code letters to identify features that are mentioned in the notes that accom- pany each picture. At least one dimensioned feature is men- tioned in each note in order to establish scale for the photo.

Overview The Korolev Basin was an early target of Lunar Orbiter I. The basin is named after Sergei Korolev, the chief designer of the first Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile, the R-7. He also led the design of Sputnik I, the first artificial satellite of Earth. This series of exposures (see Figure 7.5) covers quite a large sample of the far side crust – about 40° in each dimension. An overview of the area is shown in Figure 7.1. As is typical for the highlands on both the near and far sides, the surface is fully battered by craters, one overlapping the other. This basin is in the highest area of the Moon, a mound that rises about 5 km over the reference geoid (see Figure 7.2). It has been suggested that this mound is ejecta from the nearby South Pole-Aitken basin but although that basin had a con- tribution, it was a relatively minor one. The major source is, more likely, the proposed Near Side Megabasin, whose antipode is located in the southwest quadrant of the floor of Korolev. In this view, Korolev sits on top of the mound of ejecta from the Near Side Megabasin. As with all basins, the shape of the original surface where it impacted has modified the Korolev Basin, which has been formed on the curved surface of a mound. This is an illus- tration of the principle of superposition. As a basin forms in response to an impact, it follows the shape of the target sur- face. This is obvious in the case of a flat, level target whose only shape parameter is its elevation. For a flat surface with a slope, it is also obvious that the final shape can be estimated by adding the slope to the shape of a typical impact basin. The same principle applies to a surface with curvature, so long as the angle that the slopes make with the horizontal is small. The impact explosion will likely follow the initial target surface and the basin shape will be superimposed on the original target. Figure 7.3 shows a radial profile of the elevation of the Korolev Basin. The antipode mound has distorted it so that it does not look much like the general model of impact basin radial profiles (see Figure 13.4). The curved line represents an estimate of the shape of the mound prior to the Korolev impact. It has a maximum elevation of 5000 m above the ref- erence geoid of the Clementine database. After subtracting the quadratic curve from the measured ele- vation profile, the corrected radial profile is shown in Figure 7.4. Correcting for curvature makes a much better fit to the model of impact basins. As can be seen, the Korolev Basin is like any other impact basin, once the curvature is removed. The target surface also had an average slope relative to the basin because the basin is a little to the northeast of the antipode. It is not necessary to correct for slope because the process of deriving the radial profile automatically removes it. There is one internal ring within Korolev, which shows as a bump in Figure 7.4. It can also be seen in the mosaic of Figure 7.2. Also, the center of the floor of Korolev, within the inner ring, has been raised above the level that the model of Figure 13.4 predicts for a fresh basin. This may reflect the deposit of ejecta from the Hertzsprung Basin to the east. 7.2.

Overview The South Pole-Aitken Basin is the most prominent feature of the far side. Centered at 54° south latitiude and 169° west longitude, its rim extends from 15° south latitude (just south of the Korolev Basin) to beyond the South Pole of the Moon, at 80°south latitude, over on the near side. The crater Aitken is not especially notable in itself; it simply happens to be near the rim of the basin, opposite the South Pole (also near the rim), and so both Aitken and the pole are convenient references. Because this enormous basin extends to and beyond the South Pole, the coverage of the entire South Polar Region is included in this chapter. First Lunar Orbiter and then Apollo photography revealed parts of the mountainous rim of the South Pole-Aitken Basin. Because the basin is so large, it can only be seen in part in individual photos. Several analysts contributed to the description of this basin and the USGS mapped it as a definite feature in 1978. At the Clementine postmission press confer- ence in 1994, Gene Shoemaker enthusiastically presented the Lidar data that confirmed its remarkable size and depth. Figure 8.1 shows an elevation map centered on the South Pole-Aitken Basin. Note that it is an elliptical basin, indicat- ing that the impactor had a low angle of approach. Its major axis is tilted about 10° toward the west from the north. Mul- tispectral data from Clementine revealed an asymmetrical distribution of heavy elements that suggests that the impac- tor arrived from the south (Garrrick-Bethell, 2004). The area of greatest long-range slope on the Moon extends from the deepest part of the Apollo Basin to the mound of Near Side Megabasin ejecta, surmounted by the rim of the Korolev basin. The impact of the South Pole-Aitken Basin into this region of deep, light, porous ejecta may help explain its extraordinary depth, which was even greater before it underwent isostatic compensation. 8.2. Clementine The Clementine mission, in polar orbit, took brightness data of the entire Moon, including the South Pole-Aitken Basin and the South Polar Regions (see Figures 8.2 and 8.3). This was done in the form of limited-area exposures of a CCD camera from which mosaics were constructed to show very large areas, up to full coverage of the entire Moon. The South Pole-Aitken Basin is darkened by mare basalt in the floors of the deeper craters and basins within its depres- sion. The South Pole-Aitken Basin was formed early in the pre- Nectarian Period. The incursion by mare basalt was completed in the Late Imbrian Period, which allowed time for the maria here to be extensively overlain with rays and ejecta from craters and basins outside of the region. Clementine’s near-polar orbit was aligned in such a way that the sun was always nearly in the plane of the orbit, so that brightness variations due to topography were essentially lacking near the equator, although there were strong shad- ows near the poles. Figure 8.3 shows the South Polar Region, part of which is within the cavity of the South Pole-Aitken Basin. The floors of the deep craters very near the South Pole are always in shadow, which makes them the coldest places on the Moon. The Prospector spacecraft’s instruments detected hydrogen in those craters but could not determine whether the hydro- gen is frozen or adsorbed or has combined with oxygen to form water ice. Both hydrogen and water arrive on the Moon, the hydrogen in the solar wind and the water from comets, and so many think that both forms may be held in the cold- traps of the polar craters. 8.3. Clementine and Lunar Orbiter Coverage The approximate coverage of the Clementine images and Lunar Orbiter medium-resolution photos targeted for the South Pole-Aitken Basin and the South Polar Region is shown in Figure 8.4. This combination of coverage provides both a systematic overview of the South Pole-Aitken Basin through Clementine images and good topographic views with Lunar Orbiter photos.

A special Clementine image is provided to cover this area and each of the craters named in honor of these astronauts is shown there. The coverage of the South Pole-Aitken Basin continues with a series of custom Clementine images, also in sinusoi- dal projection, each covering the latitude range from 55° south to 75° south. The far side is covered in four of these images, each 45° in longitude range. The region from 70° south latitude to the South Pole is covered in an ortho- graphic projection downloaded from the NRL web site. This area shows the permanently shadowed craters that may con- tain water ice. Three basins were formed in the South Polar Area during the early periods of heavy bombardment: the Schrödinger Basin, the Sikorsky-Rittenhouse Basin, and the Amundsen- Ganswindt Basin. These basins, each over 300 km in diam- eter, are so close to each other that they overlap. Many craters near the South Pole are named after explor- ers of Earth’s South Pole such as Roal Amundsen and Robert Scott. One crater is named as Gene Shoemaker, the geologist who did more than any other to expand our knowledge of impact craters on both the Earth and the Moon.

Overview This region covers that part of the northwestern far side between the East Limb, past the 180° meridian, all the way to 150° west longitude. It covers from 20° north to 60° north latitude. This area is entirely covered with craters of all sizes and a few basins. The upper layers of the surface have been depos- ited by ejecta from several basins. Most recently, the Hum- boldtianum Basin and the Moscoviense Basin (Figure 9.1) arrived in the Nectarian Period, the time range when most of the large craters struck as well. In the pre-Nectarian era, Freundlich-Sharanov and Birkoff left their deposits. Below those layers is a layer from the South Pole-Aitken Basin that is at least 100 m thick. The proposed Near Side Megabasin would have depos- ited the foundation layer of ejecta over most of this region. The rim of the Near Side Megabasin runs along the 130° east meridian. Its ejecta blanket covers all the Northwestern Far Side Region east of the rim. The deep layers of ejecta material that have been reworked by going through the impact process repeatedly have resulted in a surface that is very uniform in element composition. Except for Mare Moscoviense, there are only a few small patches of mare material. 9.2. The Moscoviense Basin The Moscoviense Basin is the most prominent of the basins that have extensively modified this area. The heavy ejecta blanket of the Moscoviense Basin has covered the central part of this region but has been covered in turn by ejecta from the Humboldtianum Basin (to the north) and the Men- deleev Basin (to the south). The images of the Moscoviense Basin in Figures 9.1 and 9.2 are taken from oblique medium-resolution photos taken on different orbits, with different sun elevation angles. The main ring, 445 km in diameter, can be seen in both images. The inner ring is 210 km in diameter. Chains of craters formed by secondary impactors ejected from Moscoviense extend into the outer reaches of its ejecta blanket, surviving ages of erosion from later impacts. Long after the basin was formed, the floor of Moscoviense was flooded with mare, covering the impact features that were formed in the interim and creating a new surface for the lower rate of smaller impacts that followed. 9.3. Photos Lunar Orbiter Medium-Resolution Frames The approximate coverage of the medium-resolution photos targeted for the Western Far Side Region is shown in Figure 9.3. Lunar Orbiter 5 took these pictures in a systematic series, with successive medium-resolution frames overlapping. The pictures were taken at high altitude and obliquely because the mission profile was compromised between completion of the medium- resolution coverage of the far side and the high-resolution cov- erage of the candidate landing sites for the later Apollo landings that were to explore sites of special scientific interest. Photos LO5-085M and -103M have been combined in a mosaic, as have L05-158M and -163M. The medium-resolution photos are shown starting on page 96.

Kidinnu ( K , Early Imbr ian, 56 km) is the crater with the strong central peak, as is typical of craters of this size.

This group of craters exemplifies the broad range of names approved through the nomenclature process of the International Astronomical Union.

Either one crater about the size of Ley or a cluster of smaller impacts split the eastern rim ( Cr ) of Campbell into two ridges. Lava darkened by iron has found its way upward into the depression. This mare ( Cm ) is off-center because of diversion by the irregular rubble of ejecta that Von Neuman (next page) deposited on the floor of Campbell.

This pattern is often seen at the edges of mare on the near side as well. The lava has covered plains areas ( p ) near the northern shore, darkening the surface, and then has flowed away, exposing the surface with some erosion. The rim of the Moscoviense Basin is rugged and rounded and, unlike many of the near side basins, lacks cliffs because the basin was formed in deep, fractured ejecta. Radial troughs and ridges can be seen in the ejecta blanket especially to the north, where the east-to-west lighting shows them clearly. The impact of Stearns ( S , 36 km) has been assigned by USGS to the Eratosthenian Period (the time after the Late Imbrian and before the Copernican Periods). The follow- ing passage, from “The Geologic History of the Moon” by Don Wilhelms, describes the reasons for the age assignment, based on the image above: freshness of Stearns’ interior is evident, despite oblique viewing angle and observation by shadow. Smoothed radial ejecta and secondary craters are also preserved, despite rugged terra substrate; periphery of Stearns is pitted by small craters.

Vertical scale can be estimated by the shadow that Perkin’s rim throws on its floor.

The material cast into Debye is about 20 km wide, 30 km long, and 1.5 km high, with a volume about 900 km 3 . The mass of such a volume is of the order of 2000 × 10 12 kg (a million, million tons).

Overview This region extends from the Birkhoff Basin to the Hertz- sprung Basin (see Figure 10.5 for detailed coverage). The Eastern Far Side Region was photographed by Lunar Orbiter 5 in order to complete coverage of the far side. Because of mission constraints, the photographs were taken at an early, high orbit, which reduced the resolution. That is why this chapter covers a relatively large area with the usual number of photographs. Remote sensing instruments have established that the area is unusually uniform in the distribution of chemical elements and minerals. Few areas of mare basalt have been identified. Apart from topography, the only major patterns visible to remote sensing are due to bright rays associated with young craters like Jackson and Ohm. The upper layers of the surface have been deposited by ejecta from a number of basins. As in the other far side regions, the lowest layers above the pristine crust were deposited by the proposed Near Side Megabasin and the South Pole-Aitkcen Basin early in the pre-Nectarian Period, then came the Coulomb-Sarton Basin and the Birk- hoff Basin later in the pre-Nectarian Period. The Korolev Basin came in the Nectarian Period and the Hertzsprung Basin came later in the Nectarian Period; its ejecta blanket overlays that of Korolev. Light ejecta came fr om the Imbrium Basin at the start of the Ea rly Imbr ian Period. Finally, the Orientale Basin covered most of this region at the end of the Early Imbrian Period. 10.2. The Birkhoff Basin The Birkhoff Basin covered most of the northern part of this region with its ejecta at an early time. Yet an even ear- lier and larger feature, the Coulomb-Sarton Basin, underlies Birkhoff ’s ejecta. The ancient floor of Birkhoff (Figure 10.1) records the subsequent history of several nearby craters: Sommerfield, Rowland, Stebbins, and Carnot. Birkhoff is small for a basin, only about 10% larger in diameter than the conventional boundary between large cra- ters and basins. There is a faint inner ring, 150 km in diam- eter. If there were outer rings, they have been obliterated by the surrounding large craters. 10.3. The Hertzsprung Basin The Hertzsprung Basin is shown in Figure 10.2. Its ejecta once covered most of the central part of the Eastern Far Side Region. Orientale deposits have subsequently covered the eastern parts of the Hertzsprung Basin. Hertzsprung has a prominent inner ring that is 265 km in diameter. Most of the chains of craters crossing the southeastern sector of Hertzsprung come from Orientale, but some are radial to the Mendel-Rydberg Basin, which is older than Ori- entale, but must be younger than Hertzsprung. 10.4. Rayed Craters Figures 10.3 and 10.4 show the bright rays of Jackson and Ohm, as seen by Clementine at a wavelength of 415 nm. Jack- son has been identified as Copernican because of its sharp features and relative lack of impacts in its internal cavity and external ejecta blanket. Ohm was classified as Eratosthenian before this Clemen- tine albedo data became available. Although they are some- what dimmer than those of Jackson, the rays around Ohm are of the same composition as the underlying material and have not yet been fully darkened to maturity by the solar wind. This is evidence that Ohm is younger than is Coper- nicus (whose rays are nearly fully mature) and therefore its impact probably occurred in the Copernican period. Robertson has a young topography but lacks a ray pattern. It was assigned to the Copernican Period but the lack of vis- ible rays suggests that Robertson could be sufficiently older than Copernicus to be Eratosthenian. 10.5. Photos Lunar Orbiter Medium-Resolution Frames The approximate coverage of the medium resolution photos selected for the Eastern Far Side region is shown in Figure 10.5. All but one of these photos were taken by Lunar Orbiter 5 early in its mission (LO4-051 is the exception). Three tiers of pictures were taken; the northern tier near 60° north, Chapter 10 The Eastern Far Side Region: Birkhoff to Hertzsprung"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" The Eastern Far Side Region 125 the central tier near 20° north and the southern tier near 20° south. Within each tier, the medium-resolution photos provide overlapping east–west coverage. The pictures were taken at high altitude and obliquely. Photos LO5-031M and 032M have been combined in a mosaic. LO5-025 M is not presented because it is redundant with LO5-029 and 008. The medium-resolution photos are shown starting on the next page. They are shown in west-to-east order for each of the three tiers shown in Figure 10.5, starting with the north- ern tier and proceeding to the south. All of the photos pre- sented after LO5-031 and 032 were taken at very long range (5000 to 6000 km from the targets) and extreme oblique angles. Consequently, the emphasis on annotating the named features was placed on the high-resolution subframes for these pictures. All of the medium-resolution photos are shown before the high-resolution frames, to avoid breaking the continuity of contiguous coverage of the medium-resolution photos.

Overview This region extends from the North Pole of the Moon down to 55° north latitude (on the far side). Lunar Orbiter spacecraft on missions 4 and 5 photographed this region with their medium-resolution cameras from the near side, shooting over the North Pole. As a result, the Lunar Orbiter coverage of the North Polar Far Side Region is quite low in resolution and at a very oblique angle. The Clementine spacecraft, in its nearly polar orbit, sys- tematically covered nearly all the Moon, including this region. While the topographic information in the Clementine photography of the equatorial area is poor (the mission was optimized for multispectral photography), the images north of 55° have a low sun elevation and are superior to the Lunar Orbiter photographs. Therefore, our comprehensive cover- age of this region is primarily with the Clementine images. The Lunar Orbiter photographs of the region can be found on the enclosed CD, as well as the images from Clementine. The elemental abundance within this area is fairly uniform except for a relatively high concentration of hydrogen near the North Pole, detected by the Prospector mission. The hydrogen may be at least partly in the form of water ice that has been deposited by comets. Moderately high iron content is associ- ated with some of the deeper craters. The crater Compton on the southern boundary of this region near the western far side limb exhibits mare material on its floor. Compton also has a high level of thorium, as measured by Prospector. The Humboldtianum Basin, just over the limb from this region, has spread the eastern part of its ejecta blanket onto part of this region. The Birkhoff and Coulomb-Sarton Basins have also spread their ejecta into the southeastern part of this region. 11.2. The Western Far Side Limb (Eastern Near Side Limb) Early in its mission, Lunar Orbiter 4 took a photo of the north- ern sector of the East limb (eastern near side limb) of the Moon (see Figure 11.1). In the foreground is Mare Humboldtianum, within the inner ring of the Nectarian Humboldtianum Basin. Schwartzschild is judged to precede the Humboldtianum Basin; therefore, its ejecta is covered by that of Humbold- tianum. The Bel’kovich impactor landed just within the rim of Humboldtianum and the impact added its ejecta to the area. Below those layers is a fourth layer from the South Pole- Aitken Basin. These layers, deepest in the space between Bel’kovich and Shwarzschild, are analogous to multiple lay- ers of sedimentary and volcanic deposits on Earth, but have been deposited by sudden, discrete impact events instead of by repeated episodes of flooding by water or lava from the same volcano. 11.3. Bel’kovich K, a Copernican Crater In the part of the North Polar Far Side Region within 40° of the pole, only Bel’kovich K (Figure 11.2) and Birkhoffz have been identified as Copernican in age. In the area of the near side within 40° of the North Pole, Carpenter, Philolaus, Anax- agoras, Thales, and Hayn have been assigned to that period. A similar pattern occurs in the equivalent area near the South Pole, where no Copernican craters have been identified on the far side but Zucchius and Rutherford are near side Copernican craters. This pattern suggests that the Moon reached its approxi- mate current polar axis and rotational orientation before the Copernican Period. The reason for the relative lack of polar craters is that both comets and asteroids are likely to approach in the plane of the solar system, approximately aligned with the current lunar equator. Further, due to the focusing effect of Earth’s gravity field, impacts are more likely to strike the near side of the Moon. 11.4. Clementine Mosaics The approximate coverage of the Clementine images for the North Polar Far Side Region is shown in Figure 11.3. The area is covered in five sectors: the polar cap from the pole down to 70° north latitude and four sectors from 75° down to 55° north latitude, each covering a range of 45° in longitude. These sectors are based on Clementine, 750 nm data (NRL, USGS Map-a-Planet web page).

It also is actu- ally less smoothed by ejecta because the pole is near the edge of the ejecta blankets described above.

Overview The last region to be covered in this book is the West Limb, the eastern boundary of the far side dominated by the Ori- entale Basin (Figure 12.1). This completes the photographic coverage of the entire Moon that was begun in the compan- ion volume, “Lunar Orbiter Photographic Atlas of the Near Side of the Moon,” which started with the near side portion of the same area. Orientale, the youngest of the large basins, the one that ended the era of the basins, is on the leading edge of the Moon as it rotates around the Earth. This large basin and its ejecta establish the boundary in time between the Early Imbr ian Period and the Late Imbrian Period. The eastern edge of the Orientale Basin can be seen from Earth, but only when the Moon’s libration is favorable. Its eastern ejecta pattern was detected first, and called the Hev- elius formation after the seventeenth century astronomer. Hevelius started the practice of using names with roots meaning “eastern” for features near the western edge of the near side because he was observing through a telescope whose optics inverted images. At about 25° north latitude along the limb, the Orientale ejecta blanket terminates, exposing the ejecta of the near side Imbrium Ba sin. The Lorentz Basin (pre-Nectarian, 325 km) lies beneath that. The shore of Oceanus Procellarum comes to within 10° of the far side in the range of 20°–50° north latitude. Near the limb south of Orientale are the Mendel- Rydberg and Pingre-Hausen Basins. First came Mendel-Rydberg (630 km) in the pre-Nectarian Period, followed by Pingre- Hausen (300 km) in the Nectarian Period. These two overlap- ping basins were then covered with Orientale ejecta. 12.2. The Crater Hausen Hausen (Figure 12.2, Eratosthenian, 167 km) is the third larg- est impact feature to have ever followed Oriental, the last of the basins. Of craters that were formed after the Orientale event, only Humboldt (189 km) and Tsiolkovskiy (185 km), both Late Imbr ian, are larger than Hausen. The sudden shift in the size of impact features between the 950 km Orientale and the 189 km Humboldt suggests an abrupt end of the time of large impactors. 12.3. Radial Profile of the Orientale Basin The general shape of the Orientale Basin can be estimated from the photographs. Photoclinometry, the science of infer- ring slopes from brightness variations, can provide profiles in the east–west direction. But these techniques emphasize irreg- ularity in the basically symmetric result of the impact. A radial profile derived by averaging the elevations at each radius from the center is shown in Figure 12.3. This type of profile reduces the random variations introduced by the inherently chaotic impact process. The resulting graph is typical of the profiles of all impact basins, although there are variations in the number of internal rings (2, 1, or 0) and the degree of mare flooding. 12.4. Photos Lunar Orbiter Medium-Resolution Frames The Orientale Limb Region is covered in three frames and two mosaics of medium-resolution frames from Lunar Orbiter 4, presented from north to south. The principal ground points of the medium-resolution photos of this region are shown in Figure 12.4. Frames LO4-181M and -187M have been com- bined in a mosaic, as have the three photos LO4-180M, LO4- 186M, and LO4-194M. The medium-resolution photos are shown starting on page 174. All of the medium-resolution photos are shown before the high-resolution frames, to avoid breaking the continuity of contiguous coverage of the medium-resolution photos.

In addition, there are four subframes, LO4- 196H3, LO4-195H1, LO4-195H2, and LO4-195H3, whose medium-resolution frames are unusable. In general, sub- frames overlap in the east–west direction, and are presented as mosaics. However, the subframes of LO4-189H, H2, and H3 and LO4-188 H1 and H2 are shown on separate pages.

How the Far Side Differs from the Near Side and Why Chapter 1 presented the history of the discovery of major differences between the near side and the far side of the Moon, based on images returned from spacecraft. In this chapter, additional evidence of difference is provided and a new view of the cause of the difference is discussed. There is good evidence that very early in the history of the Moon, a giant impact created the Near Side Megabasin. The near side is nearly all within the depression of this giant basin, and its rim and ejecta cover the far side. A photograph of the eastern limb from the Apollo camera in the Command Module of Apollo mission 16, taken as it awaited return of the Lunar Module ascent stage, is shown in Figure 13.1. The terminator is about 35 beyond the limb in this picture. Although some of the impression of ruggedness on the far side is due to its nearness to the terminator (where the low sun angle increases the length of shadows), most of the impression is due to differences in the topography. The Clementine and Lunar Prospector spacecraft missions gave us a wealth of new information about the Moon, but the mystery deepened. Clementine’s laser altimeter revealed the remarkable depth of the giant basin in the southern far side, the South Pole-Aitken Basin, which extends from the South Pole up to 17° south latitude. It is about 6.8 km deep, deeper than any other lunar crater but mare floods only the deepest craters and basins within it. The altimeter also con- firmed, with additional precision, that the Moon is irregu- larly shaped, with a bulge of several kilometers on its far side (see Figures 13.2 and 13.3). Further, its center of gravity (the center of spacecraft orbits) is shifted about 2 km toward the near side from the center of its surface figure. The Lunar Prospector spacecraft provided additional news of the unusual surface distributions of relatively heavy elements like titanium, iron, and thorium. These materials tended to be more abundant at the surface of the near side. The only unusual concentrations on the far side were found to be within the South Pole-Aitken Basin. We have known since 1984 that the Moon owes its ori- gin to the Mars-sized planet Theia. The name refers to the Titan goddess in Greek mythology who created light and was the mother of Helios (the sun), Eo (dawn), and Selene, who personified the Moon. The orbit of Theia was disrupted until it struck Earth a glancing blow and was essentially vapor- ized, along with part of the Earth’s crust. The debris formed a temporary ring around Earth. The Moon coalesced from this ring, having lost its volatile material to space and part of its iron core to Earth. So why did not the Moon form a nearly spherical, uniform ball, perhaps slightly ellipsoidal because of its spin about its poles? We know why the Moon has a near and a far side; that is, why we consistently see the same side throughout the lunar month. Just as the Moon’s gravity causes tides in the oceans of Earth, the Earth’s much stronger gravity causes a tidal effect on the solid (once partially molten) Moon. While the Moon was still spinning in relation to Earth’s gravity field, the resultant dissipation of energy damped the spin until the Moon fell into synchronism. That is, its period of rotation is equal to its period of revolution. This has happened with all the large moons of the planets. But until recently, there has been no explanation of the strongly asymmetric shape of the Moon. Cadogan and Whitaker each proposed that a large impact had hit the near side, creating a basin much larger than the known basins and spreading its ejecta on the far side. Cadogan proposed the Gargantuan Basin and Whitaker proposed the Procellarum Basin. Both basins share the arc of the west edge of Oceanus Procellarum, but the proposed Procellarum Basin extended further to the east. Their think- ing was essentially correct, but the geologic evidence of their proposed basin boundaries was not confirmed. 13.2. Impact Basin Models: The Search for the Source of the Far Side Crust Recently, using the refined data from the Clementine laser altimeter that is shown in Figures 13.2 and 13.3, I undertook a search for a basin whose ejecta covers the far side of the Moon. The first step was to form a generalized model of an impact basin. Projectiles from beyond Earth’s orbit cause impact: maverick stony or metallic bodies from the asteroid belt or icy comets from the Kuiper belt. They arrive at the Moon with velocities far in excess of the speed of sound in Chapter 13 The Near Side Megabasin"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":" The Near Side Megabasin 195 Figure 13.1.

This elevation map is the same as that of Figure 13.2 except that it is centered on the far side. Note that the East Limb is t he western limb of the far side. The dark depression is the South Pole-Aitken Basin. The large Korolev Basin is just north of the South Pole-Aitke n Basin, at the top of the far side bulge. The bulge would be approximately circular if it were not for the impact of the South Pole-Aitken Basin. the surface material, in other words at hypervelocity. In such circumstances, the effect is nearly the same as a powerful explosion. The most important property of the impactor is simply its kinetic energy. The angle of the impact is of sec- ondary importance. Only if the approach is less than 30 from the horizontal does the shape of the impact basin become significantly elliptical, rather than circular. Through a discipline called dimensional analysis, impacts of all sizes can be compared to normalized models. The tech- nique covers size ranges from laboratory experiments all the way up to the large lunar basins. Figure 13.4 shows radial profiles of several lunar basins that are first measured using Clementine elevation data and then normalized by both depth and diameter. It also shows a model radial profile that matches key features of the selected basins. The depth and the diameter of the profiles were each nor- malized separately because the ratio of depth to diameter depends on many factors including the energy of the impact and the nature of the target surface. For example, the density, porosity, layering, and curvature of the target surface all influ- ence how the energy of impact is dissipated. Further, isostatic compensation can act to decrease the vertical scale of a basin over time. This effect would be especially strong for a very large and very early basin, which is exactly what is being sought. The model of an impact basin and its ejecta shown in Figure 13.4 fits the medium-sized basins, but could not be"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" The Far Side of the Moon 196 expected to fit a basin of the size of the South Pole-Aitken Basin or larger because of the curvature of the Moon. For the smaller basins, the ejecta can be assumed to follow approxi- mately ballistic trajectories, like the flight of a cannon ball. But actually, the ejected material is launched in an elliptical orbit into the vacuum of space. Therefore its launch veloc- ity (speed and angle) must be estimated and included in the model. How the ejected material is launched at the edge of the expanding explosion is known from laboratory measure- ments. The angle of launch is nearly constant at about 45 and the mass rate of ejection per angle of azimuth is nearly inde- pendent of radius. However, the velocity varies strongly with the radius of launch, being very high at the point of impact and falling to zero at what will become the edge of the impact basin. Figure 13.5 shows the radial profile of velocity that is consistent with the ejecta model of Figure 13.4. Recently, a theoretical study (Richardson, 2007) of the ejection velocity has been published that agrees well with the empirical curve of Figure 13.5, and agrees precisely out to a radius of 0.91. Another important difference between the ejecta pattern of very large basins and medium basins is the area avail- able for the circular ring of ejecta to occupy. On an approxi- mately flat surface, the depth of a ring of ejecta at a given radius from the center is simply its volume divided by the width of the ring multiplied by the circumference of a circle of equivalent radius. But when the basin is so large that its ejecta must be considered as falling on a spherical surface, the circumference of the circle is reduced. In fact, when the ejecta, in its orbit, reaches the far side of the Moon (the anti- pode of the impact point), the ejecta from all directions con- verges, theoretically at a point. Of course, variations from the assumptions actually spread the ejecta out somewhat in the vicinity of the antipode. Now that I had a general model of an impact basin, I was ready to search for the basin that had left its debris on the far side. 13.3. The Near Side Megabasin and its Effects on the Far Side I varied the model’s parameters (latitude and longitude of the center, the diameter, and the depth) until I arrived at a best match to the measured lunar surface. The result was sur- prising. I found that a single new impact basin, together with the familiar South Pole-Aitken Basin, could account for all the mysterious evidences of topographic asymmetry. At this point, I did not consider the effect of isotopic adjustment. However, only the depth parameter of the basin is affected by that phenomenon. Internal Basin and Rim To do its work, the new impact basin had to be very large indeed. In fact, it covered more than half the Moon. Its center is on the near side at latitude 8.5° north and 22° east, in the western part of Mare Tranquillitatis, not far from the Apollo 11 landing. But its rim is on the far side! The radius of the Near Side Megabasin turned out to be about 3,000 km, more than half way around the Moon. The basin is somewhat ellip- tical, with an eccentricity of about 0.4. Its major axis runs from southeast to northwest. All of the mare areas of the near side are within this basin. Since it includes many smaller basins, I refer to it as the Near Side Megabasin. The South Pole-Aitken Basin also has smaller basins within it and could be called the Far Side Megabasin if it did not already have a familiar name. Ejecta Blanket When the parameters of the Near Side Megabasin and the South Pole-Aitken Basin were adjusted, these two basins and their ejecta explained most of the evidence of the mysterious asymmetry of the Moon. The bulge on the far side is centered Figure 13.4. The solid line is a radial profile of a generalized impact basin. The light lines are radial profiles of several lunar basins ranging from 200 to 900 km in diameter. A radial profile of a basin is a plot of the average height or depth around a circle, as a function of the radius from the cen- ter of the basin. Some of these basins have inner and outer rings and have been partially filled with mare, features that are neglected in the model. The sample basins were measured using the high-resolution Clementine data- base topogrd2. Figure 13.5.

The South Pole- Aitken impact later took a big bite out of the ejecta of the Near Side Megabasin, making it look somewhat like a pie with a large slice cut out (see Figure 13.3). This complex pat- tern of the two interacting basins probably contributed to the difficulty in perceiving it earlier. The ejecta pattern of the Near Side Megabasin is unlike that of any other basin, not because the dynamics of its transient crater and internal basin are any different, but simply because it is so large in relation to its spherical target. The manner of the deposit is shown in Figure 13.6. Ejecta from Antipode to Escape Scarp The impact that caused the Near Side Megabasin was so vio- lent that much of the material ejected from the basin had escape velocity, and was lost to the Moon. When the ejection velocity fell below the escape velocity, it was still sufficient to throw the ejecta beyond the antipode. Then, as the explo- sion expanded and the velocity fell further, the material was deposited progressively back toward the antipode. A scarp (cliff or region of high slope) was left at the radius where the ejecta whose velocity was just short of the escape velocity fell. In total, two layers of ejecta were deposited; one layer between the edge of the basin and the antipode and the other layer between the antipode back toward the edge. Although the ejecta forming the layer beyond the antipode left the basin first, it forms the upper layer, because, having a high velocity, it followed an orbit further out into space and landed after the layer between the rim and the antipode. Antipode Bulge The bulge on the far side of the Moon, shown clearly in the elevation map of Figures 13.2 and 13.3, was caused by the heavy double layer of ejecta that fell into the limited region near the antipode point. It must have formed an enormous mountain at the antipode. Alas, we cannot see that mountain now, because a subsequent impact formed the Korolev Basin (see Chapter 7). The antipode is well within that basin. Model Compared to Measurement The “proof of the pudding” of the pattern of ejecta caused by the Near Side Megabasin is a comparison of the model’s esti- mate with the measured radial profile, centered at the impact point (see Figure 13.7). The vertical scale of the model in Figure 13.6. This series of sketches shows the evolution of the Near Side Megabasin as its transient crater expands. (A) The impactor of the Near Side Megabasin may have been 600 km in diameter, assuming that it was about one-tenth the basin diameter. The initial ejection veloc ity, appropriately scaled, would have been greater than the lunar escape velocity. (B) As the transient crater (the region of vaporized, molten, and fractured rock) expands, the velocity falls below escape velocity. Ejecta is deposited inside of a specific boundary that is nearly circular. The orbits are not to s cale; their apolunes are much larger than shown. (C) As the transient crater continues to expand, the ejection velocity falls further and (at a specific time after impact) the eje cta all fall together at the antipode, producing the center of the far side bulge. (D) As the transient crater expands, the ejecta lands on the region between the antipode and the expanding transient crater. Ultimately, the two meet as the velocity falls to zero, at the rim of the Near Side Megabasin."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" The Far Side of the Moon 198 Figure 13.7 is affected by isotopic adjustment in the same way as the elevation. Isostasy has reduced all elevation variations produced in the crust during the early period when the crust and mantle were soft by a factor of 6 (see Section 13.5). At the time of its formation (before isostatic compensation), the Near Side Megabasin must have been 21 km deep at its center in order to produce enough ejecta, before it subsided due to isotropic adjustment. Figure 13.7 shows a depression at the antipode (near the right side of the graph) that is due to the Korolev Basin. The level floor of the Near Side Megabasin reflects refilling of the basin from below. Ejecta from later basins lies on top of the refilled crust. So when we look at the far side, nearly all that we see has been deposited there from the near side or is the effect of the South Pole-Aitken Basin or subsequent impacts. Only a few outbreaks of mare are truly native to the far side, coming from its lower crust or upper mantle. The geometry of the far side can be understood as evolving from the Near Side Megabasin; its rim, its ejecta blanket, the antipode mound, and the scarp resulting from the transition to ejecta returned to the Moon from ejecta sent into space. 13.4. The South Pole-Aitken Basin and its Effects on the Near Side The South Pole-Aitken Basin was first identified from Lunar Orbiter photographs shot at an oblique angle. Later, the Cle- mentine mission provided much more detail, revealing this basin to be the largest known up to that time, not only on the Moon but even in the entire Solar System. It is about 2400 km in diameter. Model Compared to Measurement The model and measured radial profile of the South Pole- Aitken Basin are shown in Figure 13.8. The model shown is for a circular basin, although we know that the South Pole- Aitken basin is actually elliptical, with an eccentricity of about 0.7. Part of the discrepancy between the model and the measured radial profile is due to this elliptical shape. Since the South Pole-Aitken Basin took a large bite out of the ejecta of the Near Side Megabasin, it must have come somewhat later. Like the earlier basin, it left one layer of ejecta over the whole Moon outside of its internal basin and a second layer near the antipode. The model indicates that ejecta of the South Pole-Aitken Basin is currently at least 175 m in topography, 1050 m in crustal thickness, everywhere outside of its internal basin, including on top of the ejecta from the Near Side Megaba- sin. However, there appears to have been a refilling of the Near Side Megabasin (up to about 1700 m below the original surface). The mound at or near the antipode of the South Pole-Aitken Basin has been covered by a lava flow in the area called Mare Frigoris. In a recent paper (Schultz, 2007), Peter Schultz has sug- gested that when the transient crater of the South Pole-Aitken Basin terminated, it launched a massive shock wave through the Moon. Because of the oblique velocity of the impactor, this shock wave would be offset from the antipode. It may have struck the northwestern near side, causing a fracture pattern that later resulted in ridges and faults in Oceanus Procellarum, Mare Imbrium, Mare Humorum, and other fea- tures, a pattern that has previously been reported by Schultz and others (Wilhelms, 1987). 13.5. Thickness of the Crust The Moon, like Earth, has a crust formed of lighter miner- als (anorthosites, mostly silicates) that have separated from the body of magma that resulted from the Moon’s formation. The heavier minerals that were left are in the mantle, the Figure 13.7. The radial profile of the Near Side Megabasin. The smoother curve is derived from the model of impact basins. The rougher curve is an average depth, as a function of radius, from the impact point at 8.5 north latitude and 22.0 east longitude. The measured profile excludes the south- east quadrant, where the South Pole-Aitken Basin lies. Figure 13.8. The radial profile of the South Pole-Aitken Basin, to the same scale as Figure 13.7. The measured profile excludes the southeast quadrant, where the Near Side Megabasin lies. The model of the South Pole- Aitken Basin indicates that the ejecta that had just less than escape velocity does not quite reach the antipode, although there is a large mound around the antipode. This mound cannot be directly observed today because it is beneath Mare Frigoris. The fill in the floor of this basin consists partly of mare and partly of ejecta from nearby basins."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" The Near Side Megabasin 199 material beneath the crust. Studies of the Moon’s fine-scale gravitational field (Zuber, 1994; Lemoine, 1997), derived from tracking orbital spacecraft, together with topographic data, allow estimation of variations in thickness of the layer of crust (Hikida, 2007). The gravity field over a topographic high (a mound) in the crust would increase due to the excess mass. When the grav- ity is smooth there, as has been observed over the highlands (Lemoine 1997), it is inferred that there is a compensating mass of crust depressed into the underlying mantle to sup- port, through buoyancy, the extra weight of the mound. The relative density of the crust and mantle material deter- mines the ratio of the variation in total thickness of crust to the variation in surface elevation. For the values used in Hikida, 2007 (2.8 g cm −3 for crust and 3.36 g cm −3 for mantle), this ratio is 6.0. It follows that attributing the current topog- raphy of the far side to the variation in the deposit of ejecta from the Near Side Megabasin implies that the deposited depth is six times the current variation in elevation. Dividing the crustal thickness data provided by Hikida and Wieszorek by this value and setting the thickness of the pristine crust to 47.5 km provides an excellent match to the far side high- lands, including the bulge. To generate the ejecta needed to provide the amount that was added to the far side, the depth parameter of the Near Side Megabasin must be 21 km. Then, with the other param- eters, and the model of the South Pole-Aitken Basin, there is a match between the ejecta and both topography and crustal thickness on the entire far side except within the South Pole- Aitken Basin. On the near side, much of the crust that was originally there would be removed by the Near Side Megabasin impact. In addition to the transfer of the ejecta to the far side, a simi- lar mass of crust would be driven off of the Moon. In addi- tion, the crust under the basin may have been additionally thinned by some of it being driven deep into the mantle by the turbulence of the transient crater. Some crust probably was regenerated and rose into the cavity to form the level floor shown in Figure 13.7. A large effect on the crust would be expected from the action of the transient craters below the Near Side Megabasin and the South Pole-Aitken Basin. They would extend down- ward for distances of the order of the radius of the basins, hundreds of kilometers. The turbulence within those tran- sient craters may have driven crust down into the mantle, exchanging it for heavy mantle materials. The transient cra- ters of subsequent large basins would reinforce this action. This could be the explanation of the measured thinness of the crust below the Near Side Megabasin and the South Pole- Aitken Basin. Figure 13.9 shows how the Near Side Megabasin modified the thickness of the crust. The same effect would operate on the South Pole-Aitken Basin. 13.6. Parameters of the Near Side Megabasin Table 13.1 contains the proposed parameters of the Near Side Megabasin. These parameters were adjusted to best fit both the topographic and crustal thickness data. The depth is that of the initial basin, before isostatic compensation and before regenerated crust filled the level floor. The current depth, including the regenerated crust and mare fill is about 1800 m from floor to the estimated original target surface. 13.7. Asymmetry of the Center of Mass The transfer of crust from the near side to the far side would have moved the center of mass backward relative to its ini- tial position. But since the crust is lighter than the mantle, the center of figure would be shifted back even more, so that the center of mass would have a net motion forward, as is observed. 13.8. Heavy Element Anomalies The high concentrations of heavy elements (iron, mag- nesium, and thorium) that are observed within the South Pole-Aitken Basin and the proposed Near Side Megabasin Figure 13.9. This cartoon shows how isostatic compensation affects the additional crust that is deposited by the Near Side Megabasin. It sinks down into the mantle, driving the primitive crust before it.

Summary The following hypothetical scenario accounts for both the topography and the thickness of the crust, in shape and in magnitude. 1. The primitive crust was 47.5 km deep and uniform. 2. The Near Side Megabasin formed a cavity (21 km deep in the center) over the near side of the Moon, extend- ing beyond the limbs. Below the cavity, crust was driven into the mantle and mantle material raised. Some ejecta escaped from the Moon and the rest covered the far side, with a depth at the bulge of tens of kilometers. 3. The ejected crust subsided, carrying the primitive crust down into the mantle. The ejecta left above the mean sur- face (about 1/6 of the original depth) established the cur- rent topography of the far side. The cavity of the Near Side Megabasin had a similar compression. 4. The South Pole-Aitken Basin was formed after the Near Side Megabasin, with a vertical scale 6 times its current scale. It too experienced isostatic compensation. 5. The crust beneath the two megabasins partly returned from the transient craters, leaving the level floors that are found today. An important question is “How well does our model com- pare with the measured topography of the Moon?” To answer this question, parameters of over 50 large basins as they are today, including the two giant basins following isostatic compensation, were estimated. Their internal cavity, internal rings, ejecta blanket, and mare or crustal fills were simulated. The resulting comprehensive model is shown in Figure 13.10, along with the current elevation map of Figure 13.2. As is readily seen, the model and the elevation map are in close qualitative and quantitative agreement, much as is the radial profile of Figure 13.7. Figure 13.10. The bottom figure is the map of the current elevations of the Moon, as measured by the LIDAR instrument of Clementine.

Apparent crater: The present surface cavity of an impact feature. Basalt: Rock containing a collection of minerals relatively low in silica, containing iron and magnesium, similar to the fl oors of Earth’s oceans. Basin: Large craters have distinctive features, internal and exter- nal rings in particular, which smaller craters lack.

Crust: The upper layer of rock composed of lighter minerals such as silicates that have separated from a melt and risen above the mantle because of their low density. The surface of the Moon is crust, except where it is covered by maria. Since the maria pool in the cavities of impact features, the areas of exposed crust tend to be higher and are often called highlands. Cryptomare: It is sometimes possible to infer the existence of the dark fl at surface of basaltic mare even though it is hidden by bright debris from surrounding impact features. Early Imbrian Period: The age range from the Imbrium Basin event to the Orientale Basin Event. This period is often called an epoch. Ejecta: The material thrown out from the cavity of an impact crater. Some ejecta from lunar impact features reached lunar escape velocity and was lost to the Moon. Meteoroids that have struck Earth and been recovered include some ejected from craters of the Moon and of Mars. Ejecta blanket: The continuous layer of ejecta extending for approximately one crater (or basin) radius outside of the rim of an impact crater or basin.

Impactors usually come from the asteroid belt, but they may be comets from the Kuiper belt. Isostasy, isostatic compensation: A condition of balance between the weight of a body and the buoyant force of a supporting medium that lacks shear strength.

KREEP: An acronym for a mineral consisting of potassium (Chemical symbol K), phosphorus (P), and the collection of elements called rare earth elements (REE). These REE elements are sometimes called “incompatible” because they are the last to solidify from a melt as it cool and the fi rst to melt as a solid heats.

If the Moon is viewed from the far side, the directions are reversed; the limb at 90° east is toward the west, but it is still called the East limb so that we can say “Mare Smythii is at the East Limb” no matter what our viewpoint. Magma Ocean: The analysis of lunar samples has led to a consensus that the minerals of the crust (highlands) and maria separated from molten rock (magma). An ocean of magma formed when the Moon coalesced from the vapor, melt, and debris left over after the collision with Earth.

Mascon: A concentrated mass that affects the gravity fi eld of the Moon. Mascons are associated with pipes of high-density mantle material that fl ooded maria. Mass-wasting: The steady rain of small meteoroids onto the surface of the Moon erodes boulders and sharp features of the topogra- phy.

Dark plains are probably caused by fi re-foun- tains, volcanic features that emit beads of glass propelled by gas emissions. Rays: Young impact features show bright star-like patterns called rays spreading radially for very long distances, far beyond ejecta blankets. Rays are characterized as optical or compositional. Compositional rays are composed of brighter minerals than the background strata. Optical rays have formed too recently to be darkened by exposure to the solar wind. Rima: A long, narrow depression.

Nature of the scanning artifacts An example of a typical Lunar Obiter subframe, as down- loaded from the web page of the Lunar and Planetary Institute, is shown in Figure A.1. The scanning artifacts (“venetian blind effect”) make it difficult to visualize the lunar surface. A.2. A program to clean the artifacts Current computing technology makes it possible to esti- mate and remove most of the scanning and reconstruction artifacts (Byrne, 2002). A two-stage process is used to clean the images in this book. First, the systematic artifacts such as white lines between framelets and brightness variations across framelets are measured and removed. Second, a filter suppresses remaining variable striping patterns. The cleaned image is shown in Figure A.2. The software programs for each of the stages were written in Visual Basic ® and run in a Windows 98 environment. They use utility routines from “Visual Basic Graphics ® Program- ming, a book by Rod Stevens (Stevens, 1999). Steps of Stage 1 The steps performed by the program that measures and removes systematic artifacts (Stage 1) are the following: 1. Search from the top of the mosaic image for the first iden- tifiable bright line between framelets (a framelet edge) 2. Jump half a typical 40-pixel framelet width and search for the next identifiable framelet edge 3. Repeat the jump-and-search process until the bottom of the image is reached 4. Calculate the precise framelet width of the image (which varies between 38 and 43 pixels on the currently sampled images) by averaging the framelet width between succes- sive identified framelet edges. Successive edges are those separated by about one typical framelet width 5. Extrapolate or interpolate those framelet edges that were not identified by search processes 6. Scan each framelet edge and, for each horizontal pixel coordinate, estimate the excess brightness by compari- son with the immediately adjacent pixels. Then remove the excess brightness from the pixels of the affected scan lines 7. Determine the average linearized brightness ratio of the pixels, as a function of their relative position between fra- melet edges, for the entire mosaic image. A model of the nonlinear contrast function is used in the linearization process 8. Correct the brightness of each pixel for the average nor- malized brightness ratio corresponding to its position between framelet edges. The contrast model is used in the correction. Specific Techniques of Stage 1 The program addresses several problems that are specific to the mosaics. Finding the edges of framelets . Usually, framelet edges are represented by bright lines caused by light shining between the framelet filmstrips as the mosaics were laid up. Although they are narrower than the distance between scans of the digital images, the lines appear in either two or three adja- cent lines of pixels because the scan spot used in creating the digital images was larger than the distance between scans. The scan lines are usually tilted with respect to the framelet edges by two or more pixels across a frame and have curva- ture of the order of one pixel across a frame. In many frames, the white lines are obscured by saturation or overcome by image signal in large parts of the frame. Development arti- facts and some valid signals can produce false segments of bright lines that are not at framelet edges. The approach taken to find these lines is to search in a band of scan lines 17 pixels high, looking in 17 × 21 blocks of pixels for a bright white line segment of either two or three pixels in width. A quadratic best-fit line is calculated using the centers of the line segments. Successive fits are calculated, eliminating those centers that are most off the line until all remaining centers are within half a pixel of the line. If the remaining centers are at least 25% of the possible centers, the Appendix A Cleaning the Scanning Artifacts- from Lunar Orbiter Photos"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":" Appendix A 205 line is accepted as a framelet edge. If not, the band is moved down the picture to find an edge. Removing each framelet edge line . For each horizontal pixel index, the pixels above and below the calculated verti- cal value of the best-fit line are examined to determine the probable value of the excess brightness of the line and a weighted value is subtracted from the brightness of the two or three pixels near the line. This process preserves more detail in the image than simply averaging the brightness around the line. Contrast model . The streaking artifact was applied in the spacecraft on a low contrast image, essentially linear in its relation between photographed brightness and density. However, the atlas images were printed at high contrast and are therefore nonlinear. Thus, in order to determine and compensate for streaking, it is necessary to linearize the brightness by reversing the contrast function. An empirical study was conducted, varying the assumed contrast function and minimizing the residual fundamental and second and third harmonics of the artifacts at the framelet frequency. The resulting contrast function has a linear contrast gain of 3 between output brightness values of 0.1–0.9 of the full range and exponential curves at each end of the brightness range. Special handling . A few images require special techniques. For example, a feature has been added to compensate for an alternating pattern of darker and lighter framelets in some of the images. Quantitative Results of Stage 1 A spectral analysis program has been written to compare the spectra of the input and output images to provide a quanti- tative measure of improvement. Figure A.1 shows the fine- scale normalized vertical spectral density of LO4-140H3 before and after processing. The removal of systematic artifacts greatly improved the appearance of the pictures. The venetian blind effect disap- pears, providing a subjective effect of more direct visual con- tact with the lunar surface. However, traces of the framelet artifacts remain in parts of some of the images. Steps of Stage 2 Stage 2 is a two-dimensional filter process that performs the following steps: 1. Generate the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the image Figure A.1. LO4-187H2, Mare Orientale and Montes Rook. Figure A.2. LO4-187H2 after removal of systematic artifacts and filtering. Figure A.3. Spectral density of LO4-140H3 for periods near the framelet width (about 40 pixels). The solid line shows the spectrum of the raw photo and the dashed line shows the spectrum after removal of the systematic artifacts."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":" Appendix A 206 2. Multiply the transform by a two-dimensional filter that suppresses streaks, that is, patterns that extend horizon- tally more than vertically. This filter is formed from the combination of a low-pass filter and a high-pass filter, as suggested by Lisa Gaddis of USGS (Gaddis, 2001). 3. Return to the spatial domain by an inverse two-dimen- sional Fourier transform. The remaining artifacts are substantially removed by appli- cation of the two dimensional filter (see Figure A.2). Careful comparison of filtered images with the originals verifies that shadows, topographic variations, and albedo variations such as associated with rays are preserved. This is true even when the digital images are examined under magnification that resolves the pixels. Specific Techniques of Stage 2 Fourier Transform and inverse transform: A fast-Fourier- transform algorithm runs in the vertical direction and stores arrays of the real and imaginary parts of the transform. The same algorithm runs in the horizontal direction on these arrays to create the real and imaginary two-dimensional arrays that are now in the frequency domain. The same process is used for the inverse transform. The fast-Fourier-transform algorithm used is limited to image arrays that have dimensions M and N that must be integer powers of two; therefore, the dimensions of the actual images are built up to the next power of two by add- ing virtual blank brightness data. Filter characteristic: The filter has a low-pass characteristic in the vertical (north–south) direction to suppress the frame- let frequency and its harmonics. In the horizontal direction (east–west), it has a high-pass characteristic to reject patches of horizontal stripes while permitting topographic detail to remain. Both filters are of the second-order Darlington type. A second-order low-pass Darlington filter has the form Gf fT () () , = + 1 1 2 where f is the frequency and T is the period of the frequency that reduces the filter function G ( f ) to 0.5. A high-pass Darlington filter has the form Gf fT () () . =− + 1 1 1 2 Examination of the two-dimensional Fourier transform of an input image (whose systematic artifacts have been removed) shows strong noise at horizontal frequencies whose period is less than 150 pixels and vertical frequencies whose period is more than 25 pixels. A compound (two-dimensional) “Normal” filter with the following form is used to suppress the noise: Gfxfy fx fy (, ) () () , =− +× − +× ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎧ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ ⎪ ⎫ ⎬ ⎪ ⎭ ⎪ 1 1 1 150 1 1 125 22 where fx is the frequency in the x direction (east–west) and fy is the frequency in the y direction (north–south). The “Normal” filter is used as the default, and is effective for most of the pictures. If streaks remain after application of the “Normal” filter, a “Strong” filter is used instead. This happens most often when large areas of dark sky or shadow beyond the terminator appear in an image. The form of the “Strong” filter is Gfxfy fx fy (, ) () () . =− +× − +× ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎧ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ ⎪ ⎫ ⎬ ⎪ ⎭ ⎪ 1 1 150 1 1 150 22 A.3. Summary The Lunar Orbiter photographs have been used as the major reference for topographic information for the last 40 years. They commonly appear in papers about the Moon even today in their original state, artifacts included. Throughout this time, researchers have learned to distin- guish the artifacts from the topographic information. It is my hope that these cleaned photographs will make the nature of the Moon more available to both nonprofessionals and to new students of the Moon."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Age, absolute, 12 Age, lunar periods —Copernican, 12 —Early Imbrian, 12 —Eratosthenian, 12 —Late Imbr ian, 12 —Nectarian, 12 —pre-Nectarian, 12 Aitken, 60, 61 —elevation, 61 Albedo, 201 Amundsen-Ganswindt Basin, 76 Annotated images, 16 —latitude and longitude, 16 Anorthosite, 201 Antipode, 201 Apollo, 5, 194 —cameras, 8 —coverage, 5 —mission, 3 Apollo 11 landing site, 196 Apollo Basin, 3, 15, 60, 63 Apollo photos —East Limb, 195 —Tsiolkovskiy, 8 Apparent crater, 201 Asteroid belt, 194 Australe Basin, 23, 24, 84 Basalt, 201 Basin, 11, 16, 201 —names, 16 Bel’kovich, 160, 161 Bel’kovich K, 160, 161 Birkhoff Basin, 3, 15, 94, 124, 160 Bombardment, 10 Cadogan, P.

A nearby feature that is ann otated is identified for each of these small features and a page showing that feature is listed. The names in bold print are explicitly labeled on the Lunar Aeronautical Charts (LAC). The column marked “LAC” is the page number in “The Clementine Atlas of the Moon” (Busey, 2004). Some of these features were formerl y designated by letter codes and are shown as such on the LAC charts.
