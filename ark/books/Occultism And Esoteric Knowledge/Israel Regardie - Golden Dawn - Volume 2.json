Hiereus steps between thePillars, andfacing Candidate, says:Hiereus Frater , I shall now proceed to instructyou in the secret Step, Signs, Grip and Wordsof this Grade.Firstly, advance your left foot a short space, asif entering a portal. This isthe Step.The Signs are two. The First or Saluting Signis given thus: Lean forward andstretch botharms out thus: (make Neophyte do this). Italludes to your conditionin a state of Darkness,groping for Light.The second Sign is the Sign of Silence, and isgiven by placing the leftfore-finger on your lipthus (makes Neophyte do it). It is the positionshown inmany ancient statues of Harpocrates,and it alludes to the strict silence youhave swornto maintain concerning everything connectedwith this Order. The firstsign is always an-swered by the second.The Grip or Token is given thus: Advance yourleft foot touching mine, toe andheel, extend yourright hand to grasp mine, fail, try again, andthen succeed intouching the fingers only. Italludes to the seeking guidance in Darkness.TheGrand Word isHar-Par-Krat, and it is whis-pered in this position mouth to ear,in syllables.(They exchange the Word) It is the EgyptianName for the God ofSilence, and should alwaysremind you of the strict silence you have sworntomaintain.< 3°>The Pass-Word is It is periodicallychanged each Equinox, so that a Member whohas resigned, demitted or beenexpelled, may bein ignorance of the existing Pass-Word.I now place you between the two Pillars ofHermes and of Solomon in thesymbolical Gate-way of Occult Wisdom.Hiereus leads Neophyte forward and then takesback the Sword and Banner asHegemon handsthem to him. He stands North East of the BlackPillar and says:Let the final Consecration take place.Stolistes and Dadouchos come forward andpurify and consecrate the Hall as in theOpen-ing, but on returning to the East, Stolistes turnsround to Neophyte, makesa cross of Water onhis brow, sprinkles three times, and says:Stol I purify thee with Water.Dadouchos likewise turns round from the Eastand says after making a cross andcensing threetimes:Dad I consecrate thee with Fire.

Hegemon takesCandidate behind Black Pillar, andstands be-hind Kerux. Hiereus comes next, followed byStolistes and Dadouchos.Kerux leads off, allsalute on passing Hierophant who stands hold-ing Sceptre andBanner as in the Opening. Hier-eus drops out on reaching his Throne.Hegemonreturns to between the Pillars after passing Hier-ophant twice. Hedirects Neophyte to followKerux, who with the other Officers passes Hiero-phantthrice. After the third passing, Hierophantsays:Take your place North West of the Stolistes.Kerux indicates this and goes onfollowed byStolistes who falls out in the North and returnsto his place.Hegemon replaces his chair between the Pillarsand sits down. Kerux replaces theRose, Lamp,Cup and Paten in their proper places on theAltar.All are seated.The Three Fold Cord bound about your waist,was an image of the three-foldbondage of Mor-tality, which amongst the Initiated is calledearthly or materialinclination, that has boundinto a narrow place the once far-wandering Soul;< 32 >and the Hood wink was an image of the Dark-ness, of Ignorance, of Mortality thathasblinded men to the Happiness and Beauty theireyes once looked upon.The Double Cubical Altar in the centre of theHall, is an emblem of visibleNature or the Ma-terial Universe, concealing within herself themysteries of alldimensions, while revealing hersurface to the exterior senses. It is a doublecubebecause, as the Emerald Tablet has said “Thethings that are below are areflection of thethings that are above.” The world of men andwomen created tounhappiness is a reflectionof the World of Divine Beings created to Happi-ness.It is described in the SEPHER YET-SIRAH, or The Book of Formation, as “AnAbyssof Height” and as an “Abyss of Depth”,“An Abyss of the East” and “An Abyss oftheWest”, “An Abyss of the North” and “An Abyssof the South.” The Altar is blackbecause, unlikeDivine Beings who unfold in the Element ofLight, the Fires ofCreated Beings arise fromDarkness and Obscurity.On the Altar is a White Triangle to be the Imageof that Immortal Light, thatTriune Light,which moved in Darkness and formed the Worldof Darkness and out ofDarkness. There are twocontending Forces and One always unitingthem. And theseThree have their Image in thethree-fold Flame of our Being and in the three-foldwave of the sensual world.<33 >Hierophant stands in the form of Cross, saying:Glory be to Thee, Father of the Undying. ForThy Glory flows out rejoicing, tothe ends of theEarth!He reseats himself.The Red Cross above the White Triangle, is anImage of Him Who was unfolded inthe Light.At its East, South, West and North Angles area Rose, Fire, Cup of Wineand Bread and Salt.These allude to the Four Elements, Air, Fire,Water, Earth.The Mystical Words — Khabs Am Pekht — areancient Egyptian, and are the origin ofthe Greek“Konx Om Pax” which was uttered at the Eleu-sinian Mysteries. A literaltranslation would be“Light Rushing Out in One Ray” and they sig-nify the sameform of Light as that symbolisedby the Staff of the Kerux.East of the Double Cubical Altar, of createdthings, are the Pillars of Hermesand of Solomon.On these are painted certain Hieroglyphics fromthe 17th and the125th Chapters of the Bookof the Dead. They are the symbols of the twropowers ofDay and Night, Love and Hate, Workand Rest, the subtle force of the Lodestoneandthe Eternal out-pouring and in-pouring of theHeart of God.The Lamps that burn, though with a veiled light,upon their summits shove thatthe Pathwayto Hidden Knowledge, unlike the Pathway of< 34 >Nature — which is a continual undulation, thewinding hither and thither of theSerpent — isthe straight and narrow way between them.It was because of this that I passed betweenthem, when you came to the Light,and it wasbecause of this that you were placed betweenthem to receive the FinalConsecration.Two contending Forces and one which unitesthem eternally.

Remember your Obligation inthis Order to secrecy — for Strengthis in Si-lence, and the Seed of Wisdom is sown in Silenceand grows in Darknessand Mystery.Remember that you hold all Religions in reve-rence, for there isnone but contains a Ray fromthe Ineffable Light that you are seeking. Re-memberthe penalty that awaits the breaker ofhis Oath. Remember the Mystery thatyouhave received, and that the Secret of Wisdomcan be discerned only from theplace of BalancedPowers.Study well the Great Arcanum of the properequilibrium of Severity and Mercy, foreither< 36 >unbalanced is not good. Unbalanced Severityis cruelty and oppression; unbalancedMercy isbut weakness and would permit Evil to existunchecked, thus makingitself, as it were, theaccomplice of that Evil.Remember that things Divine are not attainedby mortals who understand the Bodyalone, foronly those who are lightly armed can attain thesummit.Remember that God alone is our Light and theBestower of Perfect Wisdom, and thatno mor-tal power can do more than bring you to thePathway of that Wisdom, whichhe could, ifit so pleased him, put into the heart of a child.For as the whole isgreater than the part, so arewe but Sparks from the Insupportable Lightwhich isin Him.The ends of the Earth are swept by the Bordersof His Garment of Flame — from Himall thingsproceed, and unto Him all things return.Therefore, we invoke Him.Therefore even theBanner of the East falls in adoration before Him.Hiero Before you can ask to pass to a higher Grade,you will have to commitcertain rudiments ofOccult Knowledge to memory. A manuscript lec-ture in thesesubjects will be supplied you bythe Chief in whose charge they are. When youcanpass an examination in this elementary Kab-balistic knowledge, you will informthe Memberin whose charge you are, and arrangements willbe made for you to sitfor examination. If youare found perfect you will then apply for ad-< 37 >mission to the next Degree. Remember, thatwithout a Dispensation from the SecondOrder,no person can be admitted or advanced to aGrade of the First Order.Kerux conducts Neophyte to his table and giveshim one of the small dishes ofsolution to hold.Kerux Nature is harmonious in all her workings, andthat which is above is asthat which is below.Thus also, the Truths which by material Sci-ence weinvestigate, are but special examplesof the all-pervading Laws of the Universe.So,within this pure and limpid fluid, lie hidden andunperceived of mortal eyes,the elements bear-ing the semblance of blood, even as within themind and brainof the Initiate lie concealed theDivine Secrets of the Hidden Knowledge. Yetifthe Oath be forgotten, and the solemn pledgebroken, then that which is secretshall be re-vealed, even as this pure fluid reveals the sem-blance of blood.Kerux adds fluid from the other dish.Let this remind thee ever, 0 Neophyte, how eas-ily by a careless or unthinkingword, thou maystbetray that which thou hast swrorn to keepsecret and maystreveal the Hidden Knowledgeimparted to thee, and planted in thy brain andin thymind. And let the hue of blood remind theethat if thou shalt fail in this thyoath of secrecy,thy blood may be poured out and thy bodybroken; for heavy is thepenalty exacted by theGuardians of the Hidden Knowledge from thosewho wdlfullybetray their trust.<38>Hierophant comes to the table. The Register issigned.Hiero Resume your seat, and remember that your ad-mission to this Order does notgive you the rightto initiate any other person without a Dispen-sation from theGreatly Honoured Chiefs of theSecond Order.Kerux directs Neophyte to his seat.Hierophant returns to the dais.CLOSING OF THE NEOPHYTE GRADExHiero (gives knock ')Kerux goes to the North East, faces West, andraising Lamp and Wand, says:Kerux HEKAS!

The Seven Circles which sur-round the Heptagram, representthe Seven Plan-ets and the Seven Qabalistic Palaces of Assiah,the Material World— which answer to theSeven Apocalytic Churches which are in Asiaor Assiah — asthese again allude to the SevenLamps before the Throne on another Plane.Within each circle is a triangle to represent theThree Fold Creative Ideaoperating in all things.On the right hand side of each is the HebrewName of theAngel who governs the Planet; onthe left side is the Hebrew Name of the sphereofthe Planet itself; while the Hebrew letterbeneath the base is one of theduplicated lettersof the Hebrew Alphabet which refer to the SevenPlanets.The Seven Double Letters of the Hebrew Alpha-bet have each two sounds associatedwith them,one hard, and one soft. They are called “double”,because each letterrepresents a contrary orpermutation, thus: Life and Death; Peace andWar; Wisdomand Folly; Riches and Poverty;Grade and Indignity; Fertility and Solitude;Powerand Servitude.<62>These Seven letters point out 7 localities:Zenith, Nadir, East, West, North,South, andthe Place of Holiness in the midst sustainingall things. TheArchetypal Creator designed,produced, combined and formed with them thePlanetsof the Universe, the Days of the Week,and in Man, the Gate of the Soul. He haslovedand blessed the number 7 more than all thingsunder His Throne. The powersof these 7 let-ters are also shown forth in the 7 Palaces ofAssiah, and theSeven Stars of that Vision arethe 7 Archangels who rule them.He leads Neophyte to W. of Altar, and returnsto his place, and is seated.Hierophant comes toE. of Altar, takes censer from Altar, and holdingit withchain short, makes cross and three for-ward swings, replaces it, and says:Hiero Before the Veil of the Holy of Holies, stood theAltar of Incense, of whichthis Altar is an image.It was of the form of a double cube, thus rep-resentingmaterial form as a reflection andduplication of that which is Spiritual. Thesidesof the Altar, together with the top and bottom,consist of ten squares, thussymbolising the TenSephiroth of which the basal one is Malkuth,the realisationof the rest upon the materialplane, behind which the others are concealed.Forwere this double cube raised in the air im-mediately above your head, you wouldbut seethe single square forming the lowest side, theothers from their positionbeing concealed fromyou. Just so, behind the material Universe, liestheconcealed form of the Majesty of God.<63 >The Altar of Incense was overlaid with Gold torepresent the highest degree ofpurity, but theAltar before you is black to represent the ter-restrial Earth.Learn then, to separate the purefrom the impure, and refine the Gold oftheSpirit from the Black Dragon, the corruptiblebody. Upon the Cubical Altar,were Fire, Water,and Incense, the Three Mother Letters of theHebrew Alphabet;Aleph, Mem, and Shin. Memis silent, Shin is Sibilant, and Aleph is the ton-gueof a balance between these contraries inequilibrium, reconciling and mediatingbetweenthem. In this is a great Mystery, very admirableand recondite. The Fireproduced the Heavens,the Water, the Earth, and the Air is the recon-cilerbetween them. In the year, they bring forththe hot, the cold, and the temperateseasons,and in man, they are imaged in the head, thechest, and the trunk.I now confer upon you the Mystic Title ofPericlinus de Faustis, which signifiesthat onthis Earth you are in a wilderness, far from theGarden of the Happy.And I give you the symbol of ARETZ whichis the Hebrew name for Earth, to whichthe<D — [Toj Grade of Zelator is referred.

Also inChaldee it is called THRAA, TheGate, whichhas the same number as the Great NameADONAI, written in full: Aleph,Daleth, Nun,Yod, which both equal 671 in total numeration.It is also called the“Gate of Death”, “The Gateof Tears”, and the “Gate of Justice”, the “GateofPrayer”, and “The Gate of the Daughter ofthe Mighty Ones”. It is also called“The Gate ofthe Garden of Eden” and the Inferior Mother,and in Christiansymbolism, it is connected with< 65 >the Three Holy Women at the foot of the Cross.The Tenth Path of the SepherYetsirah whichanswereth to Malkuth is called “The Resplen-dent Intelligence”,because it exalts above everyhead and sitteth upon the Throne of Binah.Itilluminateth the Splendour of all the Lights,(the Zohar ME-OUROTH) and causeththecurrent of the Divine Influx to descend fromthe Prince of Countenances, theGreat Arch-angel Metatron.Frater before you can be eligible foradvancement to the next Grade of CD — GO, youwill be required to pass anexamination in cer-tain subjects.

It is composed of22 squaresexternally, thus referring to the 22letters that are placed thereon. Twenty-twoarethe letters of the Eternal Voice, in the Vault ofHeaven; in the depth ofEarth; in the Abyss ofWater; in the All-Presence of Fire. Heaven can-not speaktheir fullness — Earth cannot utterit. Yet hath the Creator bound them in allthings.He hath mingled them in Water. He hathwhirled them aloft in Fire. He hathsealed themin the Air of Heaven. He hath distributed themthrough the Planets. Hehath assigned untothem the Twelve Constellations of the Universe.(Places Crossaside)The 32nd Path of the Sepher Yetzirah, whichanswereth unto MALKLJTII and theLetterTAU, is called the Administrative Intelligence,and it is so-called becauseit directeth and asso-ciateth in all their operations, the Seven Planets,< 78 >even all of them in their own due courses. Toit, therefore, is attributed thedue knowledge ofthe Seven Abodes of ASSIAH, the MaterialWorld, which aresymbolised in the Apocalypseby the Seven Churches.It refers to the Universe as composed of theFour Elements, to the KERUBIM, totheQLIPPOTH, and to the Astral Plane. It is theReflection of the Sphere ofSaturn. It repre-sents the connecting and binding link betweenthe Material andFormative Worlds, Assiah andYetsirah, and necessarily passes through theAstralPlane, the Abode of the Elementals andthe Shells of the Dead. It is the Rendingof theVeil of the Tabernacle, whereon the Kerubimand the Palm Trees aredepicted. It is the Pass-ing of the Gate of Eden,Hierophant rises and leads Zelator to the Westof Altar. He draws attention tothe Key of theUniverse.These ideas are symbolically resumed in therepresentation of the Twenty FirstKey of theTAROT, in front of you. Within the oval formedof the 72 circles, is afemale form, nude save fora scarf that floats round her. She is crownedwith theLunar Crescent of ISIS, and holds inher hands, two wands. Her legs form a cross.Sheis the Bride of the Apocalypse, the KabbalisticQueen of the Canticles, theEgyptian ISIS orGreat Feminine Kerubic Angel SANDAL-PHON on the left hand of theMercy Seat ofthe Ark.< 79 >The Wands are the directing forces of the posi-tive and negative currents. TheSeven PointedHeptagram or Star alludes to the Seven Palacesof Assiah; thecrossed legs to the symbol of theFour Letters of the Name.The surmounting crescent receives alike the in-fluences of Geburah and Gedulah.She is thesynthesis of the 32nd Path, uniting Malkuthto Yesod.The oval of the 72 smaller circles refers to theSCHEMHAMPORESCH, or Seventy-twofoldName of the Deity. The twelve larger circlesform the Zodiac. At the anglesare the FourKERUBIM which are the vivified powers ofthe letters of the Name YODHE VAU LIEoperating in the Elements, through which youhave just symbolicallypassed in the precedingCeremony.The Fan, Lamp, Cup and Salt represent thefour Elements themselves whoseinhabitantsare the Sylphs, Salamanders, Undines andGnomes.Be thou, therefore, prompt and active as theSylphs, but avoid frivolity andcaprice.Be energetic and strong as the Salamanders,but avoid irritability and ferocity.Be flexibleand attentive to images, like the Undines, butavoid idleness andchangeability; be laboriousand patient like the Gnomes, but avoid gross-ness andavarice.So shalt thou gradually develop the powers of<8o>thy soul, and fit thyself to command the Spiritsof the Elements.The Altar, as in the preceding degree, representsthe Material Universe. On itsright is symboli-cally the Garden of Eden, represented by thestation of Hegemon,while on its left is symboli-cally GEHENNA, the Abode of Shells, repre-sented bythe station of Kerux.(Hierophant returns to his throne. Kerux stepsforward and stands at Zelatorsleft hand.)I have much pleasure in conferring on you theTitle of Lord of the 32nd Path.You will now quit the Temple for a short time,and on your return the Ceremony ofyour Re-ception into the ® = GO Grade of Theoricus willbe proceeded with.Kerux leads Zelator out.<8i>SECOND PARTPicture #11 [images/img_0011.png]Temple arranged as in diagram,Kerux takes up CADUCEUS Badge.Hiero Frater Kerux, you have my commands to in-struct the Zelator in the properalarm, and topresent him with the necessary AdmissionBadge.Honoured Hegemon, guard the Portal and ad-mit them on giving the proper alarm.<82>Kerux takes Caduceus Admission Badge andbrings Zelator to the door to give theknocks.Hegemon opens the door and leads Zelator ina little way and faces him toHierophant.Hiero Frater Periclinus de Faustis, as in the ZelatorGrade there were given thesymbolical repre-sentations of the Tree of the Knowledge of Goodand Evil, of theGate of Eden and of the HolyPlace, so in this Grade of Theoricus, the Sanc-tumSanctorum with the Ark and the Kerubimis shown, as well as the Garden of Edenwithwhich it coincides; while in the 32nd Path lead-ing hereunto, through whichyou have just sym-bolically passed, the Kerubic Guardians arerepresented, andthe Palm Trees, or Trees ofProgression in the Garden of Eden. HonouredHegemon,conduct the Zelator to the West, andplace him thus before the Portal of the32ndPath of TAU by which he has symbolically en-tered.{Done. Zelator faced to West, Kerux returnsto place.)Hiereus By what symbol dost thou enter herein!’Heg By the peculiar emblem of the Kerux, which isthe Caduceus of Hermes.Zelator hands it to Hiereus, who turns it towardsZelator, and reads'.HiereusThe. Tree of Life and the Three Mother Lettersare the Keys wherewith tounlock the Caduceusof Hermes. The upper point of the Wand restson Kether, andthe Wings stretch out to Chok-mah and Binah, the Three Supernal Sephiroth.< 83 >The lower seven are embraced by the Serpents,whose heads fall upon Chesed andGeburah.They are the Twin Serpents of Egypt — thecurrents of the Astral Light.Furthermore, thewings and top of the Wand form the letterShin, the symbol ofFire; the heads and upperhalves of the Serpents form Aleph, the symbolof Air;while their tails enclose MEM, the sym-bol of Water. The Fire of Life above, theWatersof Creation below, and the Air symbol vibratingbetween them.Hierophant comes to the East of Altar. Hege-mon directs Zelator to face him fromthe Westof the Altar, and then returns to his place.Hiero The symbols before you represent alike the Gar-den of Eden and the Holy ofHolies.Before you stands the Tree of Life formed ofthe Sephiroth and their connectingPaths. Intoits complete symbolism, it is impossible to enterhere, for it is theKey of all things when rightlyunderstood. Upon each Sephira are written inHebrewletters, its Name, the Divine Namesand those of Angels and Archangelsattributedthereto.The connecting Paths are twenty-two in num-ber and are distinguished by theTwenty-TwoLetters of the Hebrew Alphabet, making withthe Ten Sephiroththemselves the Thirty-twoPaths of Wisdom of the Sepher Yetsirah.The course of the Hebrew Letters, as placed onthe paths, forms as you see, theSymbol of theSerpent of Wisdom, while the natural succession<84>of the Sephiroth forms the Flaming Sword, andthe course of the Lightning Flash,as shown inthe drawing below.The Cross within the Triangle, Apex down-wards, placed upon the Altar at thebase of theTree of Life, refers to the Four Rivers of Para-dise, while theangles of the triangles refer tothe Three Sephiroth, Netsach, Hod, and Yesod.TheTwo Pillars, right and left of the Tree arethe symbols of Active and Passive,Male andFemale, Adam and Eve. They also allude to thePillars of Fire and Cloudwhich guided the Isra-elites in the wilderness, and the hot and moistnatures arefurther marked by the Red Lampand the Cup of Water.The Pillars further represent the Two Kerubimof the Ark — the right, Metatron,Male — andthe left, Sandalphon, Female,Above them ever burn the Lamps of their Spirit-ual Essence, of w'hich they arepartakers in theEternal Uncreated One.Hierophant stands in the Sign of Theoricus.Glory be unto Thee, Lord of the Landof Life,for Thy Splendour filleth the Universe.After a short pause, Hierophant comes to theWest of the Altar, and says:The ©' = 0 Grade of Theoricus is referred toYESOD, as the Zelator Grade is toMalkuth.The Path between them is assigned to the Let-ter TAU, whose portal younow see in the West,and through which you have just symbolicallypassed.< 85 >To this Grade, as to those preceding it, certainSigns and Tokens are attributed.They consistof a Sign, Token, Grand Word, Mystic Num-ber and Pass-word formedtherefrom.The Sign is thus given. Stand with feet togetherand raise both arms upwards andback, palmsup, as if supporting a weight, thus1^. It repre-sents you in the Pathof YESOD, supportingthe Pillars of Mercy and Severity. It is the Signmade by theGreek God ATLAS, who supportedthe Universe on his shoulders and whom Her-culeswas directed to emulate. It is the ISIS ofNature, supporting the Heavens.The Grip is that of the First Order which youreceived in the preceding Grade.The Grand Word is a name of Seven Letters,SHADDAI EL CHAI, which means theAl-mighty and Living One.The MYSTIC NUMBER is 45, and from it isformed the Pass-Word which is MEM HE,theSecret Name of the World of Formation. Itshould be lettered separately whengiven.Unto this Grade and unto the Sephirah YESOD,the Ninth Path of the SepherYetsirah is re-ferred. It is called the Pure and Clear Intelli-gence, and it isso called because it purifiethand maketh clear the Sephiroth, provethandcmendeth the forming of their representation,and disposeth their duties orharmonies, where-in they combine, without mutilation or division.TheDistinguishing Badge of this Grade, whichyou are now entitled to wear is theSash of the<86>Zelator, with the addition of a white cross abovethe triangle and the numbers (Dand HI in acircle and square respectively, left and rightof its summit — andbeneath the triangle, thenumber 32 between two narrow parallel whitelines.

I am the SolarFire pouring forth its beamsupon the lowerWorld — Life-giving, Light-producing. By whatsymbol dost thou seekto pass by?”Heg By the symbol of the Pyramid of Flame.Hiero Hear Thou the voice of AXIEROS, the FirstKABIR: “The Mind of the Fatherwhirled forthin reechoing roar — comprehending by invinci-< 97 >ble Will, ideas omniform, which flying forthfrom that One Fountain issued. For,from theFather alike were the Will and the End, bywhich yet they are connectedwith the Father,according to alternating Life through varyingvehicles.But as they were divided asunder, being by In-tellectual Fire distributed intoother Intellec-tuals. For the King of all previously placed be-fore thepolymorphous World, by which theUniverse shines forth decked with ideas allvari-ous, of which the Foundation is One and Alone.From this: the others rushforth distributed andseparated through the various bodies of theUniverse and areborne in swarms through itsvast Abysses, ever whirling forth inIllimitableRadiation.They are Intellectual Conceptions from thePaternal Fountain, partakingabundantly ofthe Brilliance of Fire in the culmination of Un-resting Time.But the Primary, Self-Perfect Fountain of theFather pours forth thesePrimogenial Ideas.These being many, ascend flashingly into theShining World andin them are contained theThree Supernals — because it is the Operator— becauseit is the Giver of the Life-bearingFire — because it filleth theLife-producingBosom of Hecate — and it instilleth into theSynoches, theenlivening strength of Fire, en-dued with Mighty Power.< 98 >The Creator of all, Self-operating, formed theWorld, and there was a certainmass of Fire, andall these self-operating He produced, so that theCosmic Bodymight be completely conformed— that the Cosmos might be manifest and notappearmembranous.And He fixed a vast multitude of in-wanderingstars, not by a strain laboriousand hurtful, butto uphold them with stability, void of move-ment— forcing Fireforward into Fire.”Hereunto is the speech of AXIEROS.Hegemon leads Theoricus tothe seat of Hiereuswho rises holding his red Lamp. They halt beforehim.Hiereus AXIOKERSOS, the Second KABIR, spake toKasmillos the Candidate and said:*T am theleft basal angle of the Triangle of Flame. I amthe Fire Volcanic andTerrestrial, flashinglyflaming through Abysses of Earth — Fire-rend-ing — Firepenetrating — tearing asunder thecurtain of Matter — Fire constrained —Firetormented — raging and whirling in lurid storm.By what sign dost thou seekto pass by?Heg By the Symbol of the Pyramid of Flame.Hegemon returns to his place — signing Theor-icus to remain.Hiereus Hear thou the voice of AXIOKERSOS, theSecond KABIR: “For not in Matterdid theFire which is in the Beyond First enclose HisPower in acts, but in Mind;for the Former ofthe Fiery World is the Mind of Mind, Who firstsprang from Mind,clothing the one Fire with< 99 >the other Fire, binding them together so thatHe might mingle the fountainouscraters whilepreserving unsullied the brilliance of His ownFire— and thence aFiery Whirlwind drawingdown the brilliance of the Flashing Flame —penetratingthe Abysses of the Universe; thence-from downwards all extend their wondrousrays,abundantly animating Light, Fire, Aether andthe Universe.From Him leap forth all relentless thunders, andthe whirlwind-wrapped,storm-enrolled Bosomof the All-splendid Strength of Hecate, Father-begotten, andHe who encircleth the Brillianceof Fire and the Strong Spirit of the Poles,allfiery beyond.”Hereunto is the speech of AXIOKERSOS.Hiereus leads Theoricus round to Hegemonwhorises with Lamp.Heg AXIOKERSA, the Third KABIR, spake toKasmillos the Candidate, and said: “I amtheRight Basal Angle of the Triangle of Flame. Iam the Fire astral and fluid,winding and cor-ruscating through the Firmament. 1 am the Lifeof beings — thevital heat of existence. By whatSign dost thou seek to pass by?”Hiereus prompts Theoricus and returns to hisplace after placing a seat West ofthe Altar forTheoricus.Theo By the Symbol of the Pyramid of Flame.Heg Hear Thou the voice of AXIOKERSA, theThird KABIR: ‘‘The Father hathwithdrawnHimself but hath not shut up His Own Fire in< ioo>His Intellectual Power. All things are sprungfrom that One Fire, for all thingsdid the Fatherof all things perfect, and delivered them overto the Second MindWhom all races of men callFirst. The Mind of the Father riding on thesubtlegirders which glitter with the tracingsof inflexible and relentless Fire.The Soul, being a brilliant Fire, by the Powerof the Father remaineth immortaland is Mis-tress of Life, and filleth up the many recesses ofthe Bosom of theWorld, the channels beingintermixed, wherein she performeth the worksofIncorruptible Fire.” Hereunto is the speechof AXIOKERSA.Hegemon 'places Theoricus in the seat in theWest facing Hierophant.Hiero Stoop not down unto the darkly splendid Worldwherein continually Iieth afaithless Depth, andHades wrapped in clouds delighting in unintel-ligibleimages, precipitous, winding, a blackever-rolling Abyss, ever espousing a Body,un-luminous, formless and void.Nature persuadeth us that there are puredaemons and that even the evil germs ofMattermay alike become useful and good. But these areMysteries which are evolvedin the profoundabyss of the Mind.Such a Fire existeth extending through the rustl-ings of Air or even a Fireformless whence com-eth the Image of a Voice, or even a flashingLight,abounding, whirling forth, crying aloud.Also there is the vision of theFire-flashing Cour-< ior >ser of Light, or of a Child borne aloft on theshoulders of the Celestial Steed,fiery or clothedin gold, or naked and shooting with a bow, shaftsof light, andstanding on the shoulders of ahorse.But if thy meditation prolongeth itself, thoushalt unite all these symbols inthe form of aLION.Then when no longer are visible to thee theVault of the Heavens, and the Mass ofthe Earth;when to Thee, the Stars have lost their light andthe Lamp of the Moonis veiled; when the Earthabideth not and around thee is the LightningFlame —then call not before thyself the Visi-ble Image of the Soul of Nature, for thoumustnot behold it ere thy body is purged by theSacred Rites — since, everdragging down theSoul and leading it from the Sacred Things, fromthe confines ofMatter, arise the terrible Dog-faced Demons, never showing true image untomortalgaze.So therefore first the priest who governeth theworks of Fire must sprinkle withthe lustralwater of the Loud, Resounding Sea.Labour thou around the Strophalos of Hecate.When thou shalt see a terrestrialDemon ap-proaching, cry aloud and sacrifice the StoneMNIZOURIN.Change not the barbarous Names of Evocation,for they are Names Divine, having inthe SacredRites a power ineffable. And when, after all thephantoms havevanished, thou shalt see that< 102 >Holy and Formless Fire — that Fire which dartsand flashes through the HiddenDepths of theUniverse, Hear Thou the Voice of Fire.Hereunto is the speech ofKabir.Hegemon conducts the Theoricus to the foot ofHierophant’s Tkrone, and taking theTriangularPyramid, hands it to Hierophant.The Solid Triangular Pyramid is an appropriatehieroglyph of Fire. It is formedof four triangles,three visible and one concealed, which yet isthe synthesis ofthe rest. The three visible tri-angles represent Fire, Solar, Volcanic,andAstral, while the fourth represents the latentHeat —- AUD, active — AUB,passive — AUR,equilibrated — while ASCH is the name of Fire.{Puts Pyramidaside.)The Thirty First Path of the Sepher Yetsirahwhich answereth unto the LetterSHUNT is calledThe Perpetual Intelligence, and it is so-calledbecause itrcgulateth the proper motion of theSun and the Moon in their proper order,eachin an orbit convenient for it.It is therefore a reflection of the Sphere of Fire,and the Path connecting theMaterial Universeas depicted in Malkuth with the Pillar of Se-verity and theside of Geburah, through theSephirah HOD.Hierophant rises. Hegemon steps back and whenhe has descended from the Dais,indicates toTheoricus to follow him. He leads Theoricus tothe West of the Altar,Hegemon follows and< 103 >stands on the South Side — Hierophant beingon the North.Before you upon the Altar, is the Twentieth Keyof the TAROT, which symbolicallyrepresentsthese ideas. To the uninitiated eye it apparentlyrepresents The LastJudgment with an angelblowing a trumpet and the Dead rising fromtheir tombs —but its meaning is far more oc-cult and recondite than this, for it is a glyphofthe powers of Fire.The Angel encircled by the rainbow, whenceleap corruscations of Fire, andcrowned withthe Sun, represents MICHAEL, the Great Arch-angel, the Ruler ofSolar Fire.The Serpents which leap in the rainbow are sym-bols of the Fiery Seraphim. TheTrumpet rep-resents the influence of the Spirit descendingfrom BINAH, while theBanner with the Crossrefers to the Four Rivers of Paradise and theLetters of theHoly Name.He is also AXIEROS, the first of the Samo-thracian Kabiri, as well as Zeus andOsiris.The left hand figure below, rising from the Earthis SAMAEL, the Ruler ofVolcanic Fire. He isalso AXIOKERSOS, the Second Kabir, Plutoand Typhon.The right hand figure below is ANAEL, theRuler of Astral Light. She is alsoAXIOKERSA,the Third Kabir, Ceres and Persephone, Isis andNephthys. She is,therefore, represented in du-plicate form, and rising from the waters.Aroundboth these figures dart flashes of Lightning.< 104 >These three principle figures form the Fire Tri-angle, and further representFire operating inthe other Three Elements of Earth, Air, andWater.The central lower figure with his back turned,and his arms in the Sign of theTwo equals Nine,is AREL, the Ruler of latent heat. He is risingfrom the Earth asif to receive the properties ofthe other three. He is also KASMILLOS,theCandidate in the Samothracian Mysteries, andthe Horus of Egypt. He rises fromthe rock-hewncubical Tomb and he also alludes to the Candi-dates who traversesthe Path of Fire. The threelower figures represent the Hebrew letter SHIN,towhich Fire is especially referred. The sevenHebrew Yods allude to the Sephirothoperatingin each of the Planets and to the Schemhampho-resch.Hierophant returns to his Throne. Hegemoncomes round to the North of the Altar,andstands before Theoricus, who remains in theWest.I have much pleasure in conferring on you theTitle of Lord of the Thirty FirstPath.You will now quit the Temple for a short time,and on your return the ceremony ofyour pas-sage of the Thirtieth Path will take place.Theoricus is lead out by Hegemon who makesthe Neophyte sign on passingHierophant’sThrone.

Hethen ad-mits Theoricus after having given him The< io6>Greek Cross of Thirteen Squares. As he bringshim in, Hegemon says:Heg Behold He hath placed His Tabernacle in theSun.He leads Theoricus to the North East, and placeshim facing the Pillars.Hiero (knocks) Prater Porais de Rejectis, before youin the East lie the Portalsof the 30th, 25th, and28th Paths leading from the Two equals NineGrade ofTheoricus to those Grades which arebeyond.

Hege-mon indicates this to Theoricus.All are seated,facing Hierophant.Biero The Father of All congregated the Seven Firma-ments of the Cosmos,circumscribing the Heav-en with convex form. He constituted a Septe-nary ofWandering Existences, suspending theirdisorder in well-disposed zones. He madethemsix in number and for the seventh, he cast intothe midst thereof the Fire ofthe Sun — into thatCentre from which all lines are equal — that theSwift Sun maycome around that Centre eagerlyurging itself towards that Centre ofResoundingEight. As rays of light, His locks flow forth,stretching to theconfines of Space, and of theSolar Circles, and of the Lunar flashings and oftheAerial Recesses, the Melody of the Aether< io8>and of the Sun and of the Passages of the Moonand of the Air.The wholeness of the Sun is in the supermun-dane orders, for therein a SolarWorld and end-less Light subsist. The Sun more true measurethall things by time,for He is the Time of Time,and his disc is in the Starless above theinerraticSphere, and he is the centre of the Triple World.The Sun is Fire andthe Dispenser of Fire. Heis also the channel for the Higher Fire.O Aether, Sun and Spirit of the Moon, ye are theLeaders of Air. And the GreatGoddess bringethforth the vast Sun and the brilliant Moon andthe wide Air, andthe Lunar Course and theSolar Pole. She collected! it, receiving the mel-ody ofthe Aether and of the Sun and of theMoon, and of whatsoever is contained inair.Unwearied doth Nature rule over the Worldsand Works, so that the Period ofall things maybe accomplished. And above the shoulders ofthe Great Goddess, isNature in her vastnessexalted.Thus far the voice of the Kabiri.Hegemon conducts Theoricus to Hierophant, towhom the he hands the Solar GreekCross.The Solar Greek Cross is formed of thirteensquares which fitly refer to theSun’s motionthrough the Zodiac, these Signs being furtherarranged in the arms ofthe Cross according tothe Four Elements with the Sun in the centreandrepresenting that luminary as the centre ofthe whole. The Thirtieth Path of theSepher< 109 >Yetzirah which answereth to the Letter Reshis called the CollectingIntelligence, and it is socalled because from it the Astrologers deducethejudgment of the Stars, and of the CelestialSigns, and the perfections of theirscience ac-cording to the rules of their resolutions. It istherefore theReflection of the Sphere of theSun and the Path connecting YESOD withHOD —Foundation with Splendour.Hierophant rises. Hegemon and Theoricus stepback and follow him to the Altarwhere he placesTheoricus in the West, Hierophant North, Hege-mon South.Before you upon the Altar is the NineteenthKey of TAROT which symbolicallyresumesthese ideas. The Sun has twelve principal rayswhich represent the TwelveSigns of the Zodiac.They are alternately waved and salient as sym-bolising thealternation of the masculine andfeminine natures. These again are subdividedintothe 36 Decanatcs or sets of ten degrees inthe Zodiac, and these again into 72,typifyingthe 72 quinances or sets of five, and the 72-foldName Schemhamphoresch.Thus the Sun em-braces the whole creation in its rays.The seven Hebrew Yods on each side, fallingthrough the air, refer to the Solarinfluencedescending. The Wall is the Circle of the Zodiac,and the stones are itsvarious degrees and di-visions.The two children standing respectively on Wa-ter and Earth represent thegenerating influence< IIO>of both, brought into action by the rays of theSun. They are the two inferiorand passive Ele-ments, as the Sun and Air above them are thesuperior and activeElements of Fire and Air.Furthermore, these two children resemble theSign Geminiwhich unites the Earthy Sign ofTaurus with the Watery Sign Cancer, and thisSignwas, by the Greeks and Romans, referredto Apollo and the Sun.Hierophant returns to his Throne. Hegemoncomes to the North by Theoricus whoremainsin the West.I have much pleasure in conferring upon youthe title of Lord of the ThirtiethPath.

(done)Hiereus By what Symbol dost thou enter herein?Heg By the Peculiar Emblem of the Stolistes, theCup of Water.Hiereus The Cup of the Stolistes partakes in part ofthe Symbolism of the Laverof Moses and theSea of Solomon. On the Tree of Life, it embracesnine of theSephiroth, exclusive of Kether. Yesodand Malkuth form the triangle below, thefor-mer the apex, the latter the base. Like Caduceus,it further represents theThree Elements of Wa-ter, Air, and Fire. The Crescent is the Waterwhich is abovethe Firmament, the Circle is theFirmament, and the Triangle the consumingFirebelow, which is opposed to the CelestialFire symbolised by the upper part of theCad-uceus.Hiereus puts admission badge aside. Hegemondirects Theoricus to Hierophant whosechairshould now be moved back towards the West,and placed in readiness for theCandidate at theClosing. Hiereus and Hegemon stand either sideof the Altar,facing it.Before you is represented the symbolism of theGarden of Eden. At the summit isthe SupernalEden, containing the Three Supernal Sephiroth,summed up andcontained in Aima Elohim, the<H3 >Mother Supernal, the Woman of the twelfthchapter of the Apocalypse, crowned withtheSun and the Moon under her feet, and upon herhead the Crown of Twelve Stars,Kether. Andwhereas the Name, YOD HE VAU EIE, is joinedto the name Elohim, whenit is said Tetragram-maton Elohim planted a Garden Eastward inEden, so thisrepresents the power of the Fatherjoined thereto in the Glory from the Faceofthe Ancient of Days. And in the Garden wasthe Tree of the Knowledge of Goodand of Evil,which latter is from Malkuth, w:hich is the low-est Sephirah betweenthe rest of the Sephirothand the Kingdom of Shells, which latter isrepresentedby the Great Red Dragon coiledbeneath, having Seven Heads (the Seven In-fernalPalaces) and Ten Horns — (The TenAverse Sephiroth of Evil, contained in theSevenPalaces).And a River Naher went forth out of Eden,namely from the Supernal Triad, towater theGarden (the rest of the Sephiroth), and fromthence it was divided intoFour Heads in Daath,whence it is said “In Daath the Depths arebroken up and theclouds drop down dew/1 Thefirst Head is PISON, which flows into Geburah(whencethere is Gold.) It is the River of Fire.The Second Head is GIHON, the RiverofWaters, flowing into Chesed. The Third isHIDDEKEL, the River of Air, flowingintoTiphareth, and the Fourth which receiveth thevirtues of the other three, isPHRATH, Eu-phrates, which floweth down upon the Earth.< U4>This River going forth out of Eden is the Riverof the Apocalypse, the Waters ofLife, clear ascrystal proceeding out of the Throne of Godand the Lamb, on eitherside of which was theTree of Life, bearing Twelve manner of Fruits.And thus dothe Rivers of Eden form a Cross,and on that Cross the Great ADAM, the Sonwho wasto rule the Nations with a Rod of Iron,is extended from Tiphareth and his armsstretchout to Gedulah and Geburah, and in Malkuthis Eve, Mother of all, theCompletion of all, andabove the Universe she supporteth with herhands theEternal Pillars of the Sephiroth. Asit was said to you in the Thirtieth Path,“Andabove the shoulders of that Great Goddess isNature in her vastness exalted.”The Three equals Eight Grade of Practicus isreferred to the Sephirah Hod and theThirtiethand Thirty First Paths—those of Resh and Shinare bound thereto.The Sign of this Grade is given thus. With thehands together, raise the armstill the elbowsare level with the shoulders. With the thumbsand fore-fingersmake a triangle on your breastthus {showing it)—a triangle apex downwards.Thisrepresents the Element of Water, to whichthis Grade is attributed.The Grip or Token is the general Grip of theFirst Order. The Grand Word is aName of tenletters, ELOHIM TSABAOTH, which meansLord of Hosts. The Mystic NumberIs 36, andfrom it is formed the Pass-word of this Gradewhich is ELOAH, one ofthe Divine Names. It<n5>should be lettered separately when given thus— Aleph, Lamed He. Unto this Gradeand untothe Sephirah Hod, the Eighth Path of the SepherYetsirah is referred. Itis called the absolute orperfect Path, because it is the means of thePrimordial,which hath no root to which it maybe established, except in the penetralia ofthatGedulah (Magnificence) which emanate fromthe subsisting properties thereof.The distinguishing badge of this Grade whichyou are now entitled to wear, is thesash of theTheoricus with the addition of a purple crossabove the white crossand the numbers threeand eight within a circle and a square respec-tively, leftand right of its summit — and belowthe number 32, the numbers 30 and 31 inpur-ple between two narrow purple lines.This Grade is especially referred to the Elementof Water and therefore the GreatWatch-Toweror Tablet of the West forms one of its principalemblems.Hierophant and Theoricus turn towards it.It is known as the Second or Great WesternQuadrangle or Tablet of Water, and itis oneof the Four Great Tablets delivered unto Enochby the Great Angel Ave. Fromit are drawn theThree Holy Secret Names of God — EMPEHARSEL GAIOL — which areborne upon theBanners of the West, and numberless Divineand Angelic Names whichappertain unto theelement of Water. The meanings of the Tablets< ii6>of Earth and Air were explained to you in thepreceding Grades.Turning to the Altar, Hierophant indicates theCross and Triangle.The Cross above the Triangle represents thepower of the Spirit of Life risingabove the tri-angle of the Waters and reflecting the Triunetherein, as furthermarked by the Lamps atthe angles. While the Cup of Water placed atthe junctionof the Cross and Triangle repre-sents the maternal Letter MEM.Hierophant returns to his Throne in the East.Hegemon indicates the seat West ofthe Altarto Theoricus who sits down.

As they approach the East for the< 126 >second time, Hierophant rises holding up Cupof Water. Hegemon and Practicushalt.The priest with the Mask of OSIRIS spake andsaid: I am Water, stagnant andsilent and still,reflecting all, concealing all. I am the Past — Iam theInundation. He who riseth from theGreat Water is my Name. Hail unto ye,Dwell-ers of the Land of Night! For the rending ofDarkness is near.Heg. leads Practicus round to Iliereus who risescup in hand as they approach.Hegemon andPracticus halt before him.HiereusThe Priest with the Mask of FIORUS spakeand said: I am Water, turbid andtroubled. Iam the Banisher of Peace in the vast abode ofthe Waters. None is sostrong that can with-stand the Great Waters — the Vastness of theirTerror — themagnitude of their Fear — theRoar of their Thundering Voice. I am the Fu-ture,mist-clad and shrouded in gloom. I amthe Recession of the Torrent. The stormveiledin Terror is my Name. Hail unto the MightyPowers of Nature and the Chiefsof the Whirl-ing Storm!Hegemon takes Practicus round to his own seat,takes up Cup and says:Heg The Priestess with the Mask of ISIS spake andsaid: The traveller through theGates of Anubisis my Name.

Hail unto thee Dwellers< 127 >of the Wings of the Morning!Heg. replaces Cup and leads Pradieus to a seatWest of the Altar, and returns toplace.Hiero (rising) I arise in the place of the Gathering ofthe Waters, through therolled back Cloud ofNight. From the Father of Waters went forththe Spirit,rending asunder the veils of Dark-ness. And there was but a Vastness ofSilenceand of Depth in the place of the Gathering Wa-ters. Terrible was theSilence of that UncreatedWorld — Immeasurable the depth of thatAbyss. And theCountenances of Darkness half-formed arose — they abode not — they hastedaway —and in the Darkness of Vacancy, theSpirit moved and the Lightbearers existedfora space.I have said Darkness of Darkness — are not theCountenances of Darkness fallenwith Kings?Do the Sons of the Night of Time last for ever?and have they not yetpassed away? Before allthings are the Waters and the Darkness andthe Gates ofthe Land of Night. And the CHAOScried aloud for the Unity of Form — and theFaceof the ETERNAL arose. Before the Gloryof that Countenance the Night rolled backandthe Darkness hasted away. In the Waters be-neath was that Face reflected, inthe FormlessAbyss of the Void. From those Eyes darted raysof terrible splendourwhich crossed with the cur-rents reflected. That Brow and those Eyesformed thetriangle of the Measureless Heavens—- and their reflections formed the triangleof< 128 >the Measureless Waters. And thus was formu-lated the Eternal Hexad — the numberof theDawning Creation,Hegemon conducts the Practicus to the foot ofHiero’s throne ■— handing to Hierothe CalvaryCross of twelve squares.The Calvary Cross of Twelve Squares fitly rep-resents the ZODIAC which embracesthe Wa-ters of Nu as the ancient Egyptians called theHeavens, the Waters whichbe above the Firma-ment. It also alludes to the Eternal River ofEden, dividedinto four Heads which find theircorrelations in the four triplicities of theZodiac.Places Cross aside.The 29th PATH of the Sepher Yetsirah whichanswereth unto the letter QOPII iscalled theCorporeal Intelligence — and it is so called be-cause it forms thevery body which is so formedbeneath the whole Order of the Worlds andtheincrement of them. It is therefore the reflectionof the Watery Sign of Piscesand the Path con-necting the material universe as depicted in Mal-kuth with thePillar of Mercy and the side ofChesed, through the Sephira NETZACH, andthroughit do the Waters of Chesed flow down.Hiero, Hegemon and Practicus come to theWestof the Altar.Before you upon the Altar is the r8th Key ofTAROT which symbolically resumestheseIdeas. It represents the MOON with four He-brew YODS like drops of dewfalling, two dogs,two Towers, a winding Path leading to the Hori-< 129 >zon, and, in the fore-ground, Water with a Cray-fish crawling through it to theland.The Moon is in its increase on the side of Mercy,Gedulah, and from it proceedsixteen principaland sixteen secondary rays, which make 32, thenumber of thePaths of Yetsirah. She is theMoon at the feet of the Woman of Revelations,rulingequally over the cold and moist naturesand the passive elements of Earth andWater.It is to be noted that the symbol of the Sign isformed of two lunarcrescents bound together.It thus shows the lunar nature of the Sign. TheDogs arethe Jackals of the Egyptian ANUBIS,guarding the Gates of the East and of theWest,shown by the two 'bowers between which lies thePath of all the heavenlybodies ever rising inthe East and setting in the West. The Cray-fishis the SignCancer and was anciently the Scara-beus or Khephera, the emblem of the Sunbelowthe Horizon as he ever is when the Moon is in-creasing above. Also, whenthe Sun is in the SignPisces the Moon will be well in her increase inCancer asshown by the Cray-fish emblem.Hiero returns to place. Hegemon remains withPracticus West of Altar.I have now much pleasure in conferring uponyou the title of LORD of the 29thPATH.

As they approach Hiero. thesecondtime, he rises Cup in hand. They halt.The Priestess with the Mask of ISIS spake andsaid: I am the Rain of Heavendescending uponEarth, bearing with it the fructifying and ger-minating power. Iam the plenteous Yielder ofHarvest. I am the Cherisher of Life.Hegemon leads Practicus to seat of Hiereus. Herises. Cup in hand.

Also togovern all things and ordereverything not ordered. For in the whole Uni-verseshineth the Triad over which the Monadruleth. This Order is the beginning of allsec-tions.Hiereus For the Mind of the Father said that all thingsshould be cut into Three.Whose will assentedand then all things were divided.For the Mind of the Eternal Father said, IntoThree, governing all things byMind. And thereappeared in it the Triad, Virtue, Wisdom andMulticient Truth.Thus floweth forth the formof the Triad, being Pre-existent, not thefirstEssence, but that whereby all things are meas-ured.Heg For thou must know that all things bow beforethe Three Supernals. The firstCourse is Sacred— but in the midst thereof another, the thirdaerial, whichcherisheth Earth in Fire, and theFountain of Fountains and of all Fountains —< 133 >the Matrix containing All. Thence springethforth abundantly the generation ofmultifariousMatter.Hegemon conducts Pradieus to the foot ofHiero’s Throne and hands to Hiero theSolidPyramid of the Elements.Hiero This Pyramid is attributed to the Four Ele-ments. On the four trianglesare their HebrewNames: Asch — Fire; Mayim — Water; Ruach— Air; Aretz — Earth. Onthe Apex is the wordETH composed of the first and last letters ofthe Alphabetand implying Essence. The squarebase represents the Material Universe and onitis the word OLAM meaning World.Hiero puts Pyramid aside.The 28th PATH of the Sepher Yetzirah whichanswereth unto the Letter TSADDI iscalledthe Natural Intelligence — and it is so calledbecause through it isconsummated and per-fected the Nature of every existing being underthe Orb ofthe Sun. It is therefore the reflectionof the Airy Sign Aquarius, theWater-bearer,unto which is attributed the Countenance ofMan, the ADAM whorestored the World.Hiero, Hegemon, and Pr adieus come West ofthe Altar,Before you upon the Altar is the 17th Key ofTAROT which symbolically resumestheseideas.The large STAR in the centre of the Heavenshas seven principal and fourteensecondary rays< 134 >and this represents the Heptad multiplied bythe Triad. This yields 21 — theNumber of theDivine Name EHEIEH which, as you alreadyknow, is attached toKETHER.In the Egyptian sense, it is SIRIUS, the Dog-Star, the Star of Isis-Sothis.Around it are theStars of the Seven Planets each with its seven-foldcounterchanged operation.The nude female figure with the Star of the Hep-tagram on her brow is thesynthesis of Isis, ofNephthys, and of Athor. She also representsthe planet VENUSthrough whose sphere theinfluence of Chesed descends. She is Aima,Binah,Tebunah, the Great Supernal Mother —Aima Elohim, pouring upon the Earth theWa-ters of Creation which unite and form a Riverat her feet, the River goingforth from the Su-pernal Eden which floweth and faileth not.Note well, that in this Key she is completely un-veiled while in the 21st Keyshe is only partiallyso.The two Urns contain the influences from Chok-mah and Binah. On the rightsprings the Treeof Life, and on the left the Tree of Knowledgeof Good and ofEvil whereon the Bird of Hermesalights, and therefore does this Key representtherestored World, after the formless and theVoid and the Darkness, the New ADAM,theCountenance of the Man which falls in the SignAQUARIUS. And therefore doththe astronom-ical ripple of this sign represent, as it were,< I3S >Waves of Water — the ripples of that Rivergoing forth out of Eden — but,therefore also,is it justly attributed to Air and not unto Waterbecause it isthe Firmament dividing and con-taining the Waters.Hierophant returns to his place.I have much pleasure in conferring upon youthe Title of Lord of the 28th Path.You willnow quit the Temple for a short time and onyour return the Ceremony ofyour passage ofthe 27th PATH will take place.Hegemon leads Practicus out.< 136 >THE 27TH PATH OF PEHThe Temple is symbolically in HOD, and the Paths inthe East and S.

Hierophant rises, red Lamp in hand.Hiero Ere the Eternal instituted the Formation, Be-ginning and End existed not.Therefore, beforeHim, He expanded a certain Veil, and thereinHe instituted thePrimal Kings. And these arethe Kings who reigned in Edom before therereigned aKing over Israel.But they subsisted not. When the Earth wasformless and void — behold this is thereign ofEDOM. And when the Creation was established,lo, this is the reign ofIsrael. And the Wars of<i38>titanic forces in the Chaos of Creation, Lo, theseare the Wars between them.From a Light-bearer of unsupportable bright-ness, proceeded a radiating flame,hurling forth,like a vast and mighty Hammer, those sparkswhich were the Primalworlds. And these Sparksflamed and scintillated awhile, but being unbal-anced,they were extinguished. Since lo, theKings assembled, they passed awaytogether,they themselves beheld, so they were astonished.They feared. Theyhasted away. And these bethe Kings of Edom who reigned before therereigned aKing over Israel.Hegemon takes Fractious round the Temple,and halts before Hiereus who rises withRedLamp in hand.Hiereus The Dukes of Edom were amazed, tremblingthey took hold of the MightyMoab.

TheLord thundered through theHeavens and thehighest gave forth His Voice — Hail-stones andflashings of Fire.He sent out His Arrows andscattered them: He hurled forth His Lightningsanddestroyed them.Then the channels of the Waters were seen andthe Foundations of the World werediscovered.At Thy rebuke, O Lord — at the blast of theBreath of Thy Nostrils,the Voice of Thy Thun-der was in the Heavens and Thy Lightningslightened theWorld.

His Glorycov-ered the Heavens and the Earth was full of His< Mo >praise. His brightness was as the Light. He hadKARMAIM in His Hands and therewas thehiding of His Power.Before Him went the pestilence and FlamingFire went forth at His Feet. He stoodand meas-ured the Earth. He beheld and drove asunderthe Nations. And theEverlasting Mountainswere scattered — the Perpetual Hills did bow.His ways areeverlasting. I saw the tents of Cu-shan in affliction and the curtain of theLandof Midian did tremble.Was the Lord displeased against the Rivers?Was Thy Wrath against the Sea thatThou didstride upon Thy horses and Chariots of Salvation?Thou didst cleaveasunder the Earth with theRivers. The Mountains saw Thee and they trem-bled. Thedeluge of waters rolled by. The Deeputtered His voice and lifted up His handsonhigh. The SUN and the MOON stood still intheir Habitations. At the Light ofThine arrowsthey went — at the shining of Thy GlitteringSpear. Thou didst marchthrough the Land inindignation.

Also, the Calvary Cross of Six Squaresforms the Cube, andis thus referred to the SixSephiroth of Microprosopus w'hich are Chesed,Geburah,Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod and Yesod.Hegemon faces Practicus to the Diagram at theAltar. Hiero comes West of Altarand pointsto Diagram. Hegemon resumes seat.< H5>Hiero This is the symbolic representation of THEFALL. For, the Great Goddesswho, in the© — [H Grade was supporting the Columns ofthe Sephiroth, in the signof the d>= 0 Grade,being tempted by the Tree of Knowledge (whosebranches indeedtend upward into the SevenLower Sephiroth, but also tend downward untotheKingdom of Shells) reached down unto theQlippoth, and immediately the Columnswereunsupported and the Sephirotic system wasshattered, and with it fell ADAM,the MICRO-PROSOPUS.Then arose the Great DRAGON with SevenHeads and Ten Horns, and the Gardenwasmade desolate, and MALKUTH was cut offfrom the Sephiroth by his intersectingfolds, andlinked unto the Kingdom of Shells, And theSeven Lower Sephiroth werecut off from theThree Supernals in DAATH, at the feet ofAIMA ELOHIM.And on the Heads of the Dragon are the Namesand Crowns of the Edomite Kings. Andbecausein DAATH was the greatest rise of the GreatSerpent of Evil, therefore isthere, as it were,another Sephirah, making for the Infernal orAverse Sephiroth,Eleven instead of Ten.And hence were the Rivers of Eden desecrated,and from the Mouth of the DRAGONrushedthe Infernal Waters in DAATH. And this isLEVIATHAN, The Crooked Serpent.Put between the Devastated Garden and theSupernal Eden, YOD HE VAU HE ELOHIM< H6 >placed the Letters of THE NAME and THEFLASHING SWORD that the uppermost partofthe Tree of Life might not be involved in theFall of Adam. And thence it wasnecessary thatthe SECOND ADAM should come to restoreall things and that, as theFirst Adam had beenextended on the Cross of the Celestial Rivers,so the SONshould be crucified on the Cross ofthe Infernal Rivers of DAATH. Yet, to dothis,he must descend unto the lowest first, even untoMalkuth and be born of her.The © — DlI Grade of PHILOSOPHUS is re-ferred unto the Sephira NETZACH andthe27th, 28th, and 29th PATHS are bound thereto.The Sign of this Grade is givenby raising thehands to the fore-head, and with the thumbsand index fingersforming a triangle, apex upthus .... This represents the element of FIREto whichthis Grade is allotted, and also theSpirit which moved upon the Waters ofCre-ation. The Grip or token is the general Gripof the First Order. The GRANDWORD is aName of nine letters — YOD HE VAU HETZABAOTH, which means Lord ofArmies.The Mystic Number is 28 and from it is formedthe Pass Word KAPH CHETH, whichshouldbe lettered separately when given. It meansPower.Unto this Grade, and unto the Sephira NET-ZACH, the Seventh Path of the SepherYetzirahis referred. It is called the Recondite Intelli-gence, and it is socalled because it is the Reful-< H7 >gent Splendour of all the Intellectual Virtueswhich are perceived by the Eye ofthe Mind andby the Contemplation of Faith.The distinguishing Badge of this Grade whichyou will now be entitled to wear, isthe sash ofa Practicus, with the addition of a bright greencross above theviolet cross and the numbers© in a circle and [U in a square on either sideofits summit, and below the number 31, the num-bers 27, 28, and 29 in brightgreen, between nar-row bars of the same colour.This Grade is especially referred to FIRE, andtherefore, the Great Watch-Toweror Terres-trial Tablet of the South forms one of its princi-pal Emblems. It isknown as the Fourth or GreatSouthern Quadrangle and is one of the FourGreatTablets delivered unto ENOCH by theGreat Angel Ave. From it are drawn theThreeHoly Secret Names of God OIP TEAAPEDOCE, which are borne upon the Bannersofthe South, and numberless Divine and An-gelic Names which appertain unto theElementof Fire. The meanings of the other Tablets havealready been explained toyou.The Triangle surmounting the Cross upon theAltar represents the Fire of theSpirit surmount-ing the Cross of Life and of the Waters of Edom.You will notethat it thus forms the AlchemicalEmblem of Sulphur. The Red Lamps at theanglesof the Triangle are the Three-fold formof Fire.< 148 >Hiero resumes his seat. Hegemon conducts Frac-tious to him.The Portals in the East and North East con-duct to higher Grades. The others arethose ofPaths you have already traversed. This Gradeis related to the PlanetVENUS, Ruler in NET-ZACH. Its Symbol, when inscribed on the Treeof Life is shownin the East. It embraces thewhole of the Sephiroth, and is therefore afittingemblem of the Isis of Nature; hence, also, itscircle is representedlarger than that of Mercury.Hegemon leads Philosophus to a seat West oftheAltar, facing East, and removes the diagramof The Fall.

Are you willing to takethese pledges?Phil. I am willing.2nd Ad. Then you will take in your right hand the Ban-ner of the West (3rd Ad.gives it to him) and placeyour left hand in that of the Very Honoured 3rdAdept,who is the living Symbol of the Black Pillarwhich ruleth in the Outer Order, andtouch the cor-responding Emblem, the Black Sash of restriction,on your breast,and thus bind yourself while raisingthe Light which you hold, in witness of yourpledge.Phil, raises right hand holding Banner and Light,while his left hand,held by 3rd Ad. touches Sash.2nd Ad.

Thirdly, do you also promise to regard all theknowledge imparted to youas a trust, given intoyour hands, not for your selfish advantage, but fortheservice of all mankind, that the ancient traditionof Initiation be kept pure andundefiled, and theLight be not lost for those that seek it in this Path?Phil. I do.2nd Ad. And lastly, do you solemnly promise to exercisebrotherly love, charityand forbearance towards theMembers of the Order, neither slandering, back-bitingnor reviling them, whether you have causefor the same or not, but uniting withthem to forma fabric of mutual confidence and support; anddo you furtherundertake, not to be a stirrer up ofstrife, of schism, or of opposition to theChiefs, butrather to uphold their authority in all loyalty?Phil. I do.2nd Ad. Then, realising the Cross about your neck, youwill lift up your righthand, holding the Banner andthe Light and say: —“I undertake to maintain the Veil between the Firstand the Second Orders, andmay the Powers of theElements bear witness to my pledges.”Done.

The Symbol of the 1st Grade of Neophyte is© = 0, To the first O isattached a Circle — to thesecond, a Square. The union of the circle andthesquare hath many meanings, of which one must beput before you, for this youmust accomplish in< 166 >your own person, ere you can advance further. Forif in the Mystic sphere ofTruth, the way of Initi-ation may be trodden alone, yet in another Sphere,ithath a three-fold aspect. Part that can be given toman from without — part thatcan be attained byman himself—part that can only come from theDivine. Now, inthe Order, you were given intellec-tual teaching, and won your Grades in testsof whatwas taught.

The Cross of Four Triangles called the MalteseCross, is a Symbol of theFour Elements in balanceddisposition. It is here given in the colours oftheKing’s scale, and is also assigned to the Four Sephi-roth ruling the Gradesof the Outer—Earth toMalkuth, Air to Yesod, Water to Hod and Fire toNetzach.It is again, the Cross which heads the Praemonstra-tor’s Wand, who representsthe Sephira Chesed,the Fourth Sephira. Four is also the Number ofJupiter, whosePath unites Chesed to Netzach.The Cross is therefore a fit Emblem for aPhiloso-phus of the Grade of © = 13.In this diagram are represented the Circle, the Point,the Line, the Cross, theSquare and the Cube. Forthe Circle is the Abyss, the Nothingness, the AIN.ThePoint is Kether. Now, the Point has no dimen-sion, but in moving, it traces theLine. This givesthe first number — Unity — yet therein, lies dual-ityunmanifest, for two Points mark its ends. Themovement of the line maketh thePlane or Squarethus:—(indicates). The motion of the Point atangles to its firstdirection and intersecting itmaketh the Cross. So therefore, are the Squareandthe Cross but one Symbol, deriving from the Circleand the Point.Below, is shown the Occult Symbol of Malkuth, theTenth Sephira. It is in Fourparts, correspondingto the Maltese Cross. They are Fire of Earth, Waterof Earth,Air of Earth, Earth of Earth, as is indi-cated by the Symbol. They correspond tothe FourGrades of the First Order, which in one sense, quit-< 168 >teth not Malkuth, being the Grades of the FourLowest Sephiroth of Malkuth inAssiah. Uponthem, is surcharged a white Hexagram in a Circle.The 6 and the 4make 10, the number of Malkuthon the Tree. The Hexagram is also the Sign oftheMacrocosm—of Tiphareth, and of the Six UpperSephiroth, wherefore here it iswhite — Spirit rulingover matter. Six is a perfect number, for its wholeequalsthe sum of its parts.Six are the middle points of the planes hound-ing a cube, which derives from thesquare, and fromthe Cross, if the centre point moves thus (indicatesthirddirection).In these numbers and figures are hid many revel-ations.Remember that the whole number of Malkuth is496 — which is again a perfectnumber. Malkuthmust then be equated and perfected by the 6 rul-ing the 4: andthe link between 6 and 4 is the num-ber of the Pentagram.2nd Ad. Having achieved the entry into Malkuth, it isneedful that you shouldpass through the Path ofTau, the dark Path of the Astral Plane. Go, there-fore,to the Tablet of the East.Phil, goes to E. Hs. and IIeg. bar the way, points ofimplements downwards andtouching. Heg. de-mands 2 — 9 Sign and Words.

Heg. makes invok-ing Pent, and directs Phil,to uncover Lamp. Heg.takes Phil, to the Altar and directs him to put Roseleavesat East side, then, standing East of the Altarin Yesod, Heg. shows GreatHermetic Arcanum.Heg. This Symbol represents the Great Hermetic Ar-canum. The feet of the Figurerest upon the Earthand the Sea. In the Hand are represented the hotand moistnatures, symbolised by the torch andthe horn of water. These are furtherstrengthenedby the Solar and fiery Emblems of the King andLion, and the Luna andwatery emblems of theQueen and Dolphin. Above the Whole figure risethe wings ofthe aerial nature, the Reconciler be-tween the Fire and the Water. Compare thisSym-bol with the Angel described in the 10th Chapterof the Apocalypse of St.John: —“And I saw an-other mighty Angel come down from Heavenclothed with acloud; and a rainbow was upon hishead, and his face as it were, the Sun, andhisfeet were as pillars of fire, and he had in his handa little book open; andhe set his right foot uponthe Sea and his left foot upon the Earth, and hecriedwith a loud voice as when a lion roareth, (theGreen Lion, the Path of Leo aboveTiphareth, refer-ring to Teth) and when he cried, seven thundersuttered theirvoices (seven Aeons, representedunder the regimen of the Planets.) TheDragonissuing from the cave represents volcanic fires.Heg. leads Phil, onceround, and hands him over toHiereus in the North and returns to place.Hiereus. This is the Image of the Vision of Nebuchad-nezzar, which was showedyou in the passage of< >the 27th Path, leading to the © = 0 Grade of Phi-losophus. ‘‘Thou, O King,sawest and beheld a greatimage. This Great Image, whose brightness wasexcellentstood before thee and the form thereofwas terrible. This Image’s head was puregold, hisbreast and his arms were silver, his belly and histhighs were brass,his legs of iron and his feet partof iron and part of clay. Thou sawest tillthat a stonewas cut out without hands, which smote the Imageupon its feet, whichwere part of iron and part ofclay, and brake them to pieces. Then was theiron,the clay, the brass, the silver and the Gold brokento pieces together andbecame like the chaff of thesummer threshing floors; and the wind carriedthemaway and no place was found for them; and thestone that smote the Imagebecame a great moun-tain and filled the whole earth. Thou, O King, arta King ofKings, for the God in heaven hath givenunto thee (makes Qabalistic Cross) theKingdom,the Power and the Glory!Thou art this head of Gold, (to Phil.) Thou art thishead of Gold! Thy headrepresents in thee thedominion of the Divine ruling over the rest of thebody.The Silver is the world of the heart, the brassis the material passion, the ironis the firm purpose,and the feet, part of iron and part of clay, are themingledstrength and infirmity of the natural man.And the Stone made without hands isthe EternalStone of the Wise, which will become the Moun-tain of Initiation,whereby the whole Earth shallbe filled with the knowledge of God.Hiereus takes Phil, to second diagram.<171 >Hiereus. This Tablet shows the Symbolic manner inwhich certain names have beenused by our ancientbrethren. You will note that the initials of this sen-tencemake the Latin word Vitriolum, Sulphuricacid. Furthermore, the word Vitriol,Sulphur, andMercury each consist of seven letters answeringto the alchemicpowers of the seven Planets. Theinitials of the following sentence inLatin—(thesubtil fluid, the Light of the Earth) make the wordS. A. L. T. salt,and further, the four words of thesentence answers to the four Elements —Subtilis,Air; Aqua, Water; Lux, Fire; and Terra, Earth.And the four words unitedyield 20 letters, that is,the product of four, the number of theElements,multiplied by Five, the number of the Pentagram.The words Fiat Lux,meaning “Let there be Light,”consist of 7 letters. The letters of Fiat formtheinitials of Flatis, Air; Aqua, Water; Ignus, Fire;and Terra, Earth. (Heg.goes to South). Whichfour names again yield 20 letters as in the previouscase.And the word Lux is formed from the anglesof the Cross, L V X.He leads Phil, once round and then to Heg. whoawaits them in the S.Heg. The Seraphim in the vision of Isaiah are describedas having six wings:—“With twain Me covered hisface, and with twain He covered his feet, andwathtwain he did fly.” That is, his synthesis is to befound in the Hexagram andin the idea of the Seven,more especially dominating the planetary region.But theKerubim of Ezekiel have each 4 faces —those of the Lion, the Bull, the Man andthe Eagle< 172 >counterchanged with each other by revolution,whence the symbolic forms of thewheels besidethem, wherein was the Spirit; and wath two of thewings they coveredtheir bodies and two werestretched upwards one to another. So the synthesisofthe Kerubim is found in the revolving Cross, inthe Pentagram, and in the idea ofone Spirit domi-nating the four Elements. But the Kerubim of St.John’s vision inthe Apocalypse are uncompounded,having single heads, but they have six wingsandthus unite the powers of the seven with the four.And their cry is similar tothat of the Seraphim ofIsaiah: — “Holy, Holy, Holy”.Heg. returns to place. 2nd and 3rd Ad. bar way inS.

The mysteries may nowbe partially be revealed unto you.2nd Ad. takes Phil, to Tarot Key of Death.znd Ad. The 13th Key of Tarot represents the figure ofa Skeleton, upon whichsome portions of flesh stillremain. In a field he is reaping off with theScytheof Death the fresh vegetation which springs fromcorrupting bodies buriedtherein — fragments of< 178 >which — such as hands, heads and feet appearabove the soil. Bones also arestrewn upon the sur-face. One of the heads wears a kingly crown; an-other isapparently that of a person of little note,showing that Death is the equaliserof all condi-tions. The five extremities, the head, hands and feet,allude to thepowers of the number five, the LetterHe, the Pentagram — the concealed Spirit ofLifeand the Four Elements — the originator of all liv-ing form. The Sign ofScorpio especially alludes tostagnant and foetid water — that property ofthemoist nature which initiates putrefaction and decay.The eternal change fromlife into death throughdeath into life, is symbolised by the grass whichspringsfrom and is nourished by putrifying andcorrupting carcasses; the herbiage, inits turn affordsfood to animals and man, which again when dead,nourishethvegetable life and bring to growth andperfection the living herbige. This isfurther shownby the figure itself putrifying and decaying as itreaps the grassof the field. “As for man, his days areas grass, as a flower of the field, so heflourisheth.”The top of the scythe forms the Tau Cross of Life,showing that whatdestroys also renews.The whole is a representation of the eternal trans-mutation of the life ofnature, which reforms allthings into fresh images and similitudes.This sym-bolrepresents the corrosive and destructive actionof the infernal Fire as opposedto the Celestial —the Dragon of the Waters, the Typhon of theEgyptians, theSlayer of Osiris — which later yetrises again in Horus. The Scorpion, Serpent ofEvil,delineated before the figure of Death in the more< 179 >ancient form of the Key, refers to the mixed andtransforming, thereforedeceptive, nature of thisemblem. Behind him, is the Symbol of the Name-less One,representing the Seed and its germ, notyet differentiated into Life, thereforeincapable ofdefinition. The Scorpion is the emblem of ruthlessdestruction; theSnake is the mixed and deceptivenature, serving alike for good and evil; theEagleis the higher and Divine Nature, yet to be foundherein, the AlchemicalEagle of distillation, theRenewer of life. As it is said: —“Thy youth shallberenewed like the Eagles.” Great indeed, andmany are the mysteries of thisterrible Key.md Ad. and Hiereus show Phil, the figure ofTyphon.Hiereus. This drawing represents the symbolic figureof Typhon, the Destroyer.The eleven circles rep-resent the eleven Averse Sephiroth. He stands uponEarthand Ocean, his head lost in the clouds, a colos-sal image of evil anddestruction. The brow denotesthe confusion of opposing Elemental Forces inthehigher regions of the Air, and confusion of mindand madness in man. The eyesare the devouringflames of lust and violence — the breath is storm,devastationand rage, alike in the Universe whichis the greater w'orld, and in Man who isthe lesser.The arms and the hands are the swrift executors ofevil works, thebringers of pestilence and disease.The heart is malice and envy in man, thenourisherof evil in the atmosphere, which later are again sym-bolised by thenumerous and twining serpents.< i8o>2nd Ad. The 24th Path of Sepher Yetzirah to which theTarot Key of Death isreferred is the ImaginativeIntelligence, and it is so called because itgivethform to all similitudes which are created in like man-ner similar to itsharmonious elegances. For theoutward form always follows the Hidden law,thusfrom Chaos is produced Harmony, just as a beau-tiful flower is produced fromdecaying matter.

(knocks) By the Power of Pan and the Goat ofMendes, stand.3rd Ad. Thus far and no farther are you permitted topenetrate the Path of Ayin,whose mysteries maynow be partially revealed to you. The 15th Keyof the Tarotrepresents a goat-headed, satyr-likeDemon whose legs are hairy — his feet andclaws,standing upon a Cubical Altar. He has heavy bat-like wings. In his lefthand, which points down-wards, he holds a lighted torch, and in his right,whichis elevated, a horn of water. The left handpoints downwards to show that it isthe infernal andburning, not the celestial and life-giving flame whichis kindledin his torch—just as when the Sun is inCapricornus, to which cold and earthySign this Keycorresponds, Solar light is at its weakest and the na-tures of coldand moisture triumph over heat anddryness. The cubical Altar represents theUniverse— right and left of it, bound thereto by a cord at-tached to a circlewhich typifies the centre of theEarth, are two smaller demons, one male andonefemale. They hold a cord in their hands. The wholefigure shows the grossgenerative powers of natureon the material plane, and is analogous to the Panofthe Greeks and the Egyptian Goat of Mendes (thesymbol of Khem). In certainaspects, this Key rep-< 182 >resents the brutal forces of nature, which to theunbelieving man only obscureand do not reflectthe luminous Countenance of God. It also alludesto the sexualpowers of natural generation. Thustherefore the Key fitly balances the symbolofDeath on the other side of the Tree of Life. Of thesmaller demons, one pointsdownwards and oneupwards, answering to the positions of the handsof the centralfigures. Beneath his feet are Penta-grams on which he tramples (whence comestheirtitle of Wizard's foot) and his head Is covered withthe evil and reversedPentagram. As his hands bearthe torch and the horn — the symbols of FireandWater, so does his form unite the Earth in his hairyand bestial aspect, andthe Air in his bat-like wings.Thus he represents the gross and materialisedEle-mental Forces of Nature; and the whole would bean evil symbol, were it notfor the Pentagram ofLight above his head which regulates and guideshismovements. He is the eternal renewer of all thechanging forms of Creation inconformity with theLaw of the All-Powerful One (Blessed be He)which controllinglaw is typified by the controllingPentagram of Light surmounting the whole.ThisKey is an emblem of tremendous force; many anduniversal are its mysteries.Hiereus and 3rd Ad. go to diagram of Pan.Hiereus. This drawing represents the Symbolic figureof Pan, the Greek God ofNature. He stands uponthe Cube of the Universe, holding in his right handthepastoral staff of rural authority, and in his leftthe 7 reeded pipe symbolicalof the harmony of< 183 >the Planetary Spheres. The Nine Circles representthe Sephiroth with theexception of Kether, exactlythose which are included in the symbol on the TreeofLife. The ruddy face is the heat of the Earth —the horns are the Rays — the bodycontains theElements and the Cube is the firm basis. Observethat the higher partof the figure is human, growingmore bestial as it nears the Earth.3rd Ad. The 26th Path of the Sepher Yetzirah, to whichthe Tarot Key of the Devilis referred, is called theRenovating Intelligence, because, by it, God theHolyOne reneweth all the changing forms whichare renewed by the Creation of theWorld.

W. of Altar, facing East.Hiereus. In guardianship and not in enmity, have Ibarred your venturing, 0Philosophus. Now mayit be revealed unto you how that in my Lamen ofOffice ishidden the Key which you seek. For theTriangle in the Circle is the high symbolof theHoly Trinity, and the first three Sephiroth and ofBinah wherein is theSphere of Saturn, Ruler ofthe Path Tau. Therefore do I wear it, and there-fore,when you entered the Hall of the Neophytesin the o — o, when first the hood-winkwas raised,you beheld before you the Sword that barred andthe Symbol whicha'vercometh the barrier. TheLamen in its more special attribution to theHie-reus, has the following meanings. In the circle arethe Four Sephiroth,Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod and<iS4>Yesod. The first three mark the angles of the Tri-angle inscribed within, whilethe sides are the Pathsof Nun, Ayin and Peh, respectively.

From the manycoloured Bow, is loosed inYesod, the Arrow of Sagittarius — Samekh,soaringupward to cleave open the Veil unto the Sun inTiphareth. Thus it is a fitsymbol for hope andaspiration, for in the Sign Sagittarius, Jupiter,Ruler ofKaph is Lord. Thus, by this straight andnarrow way only, is advance between thedangersthat have threatened you, possible.3rd Ad. descends to North side of Altar.3rd Ad. But Sagittarius, the Archer, is a bi-corporateSign — the Centaur, theMan and the Horse com-bined. Recall what was said unto thee in the pas-sage ofthe 31st Path of Fire, leading unto the 3 — 8Grade of Practicus: —“Also there isthe vision ofthe fire flashing Courser of Light, or also a childborne aloft uponthe shoulders of the CelestialSteed, fiery or clothed with gold, or naked and<i8S>shooting from the bow, shafts of light, and stand-ing on the shoulders of ahorse. But, if thy medita-tion prolongeth itself thou shalt unite all thesesym-bols in the form of a Lion.” For thus wilt thou cleaveupward by the Path ofSagittarius, through theSixth Sephira into the Path of Teth, answering toLeo,the Lion — the reconciling Path betweenMercy and Severity, Chesed and Geburah,beneathwhose centre hangs the glorious Sun of Tiphareth.Therefore, by thestraight and narrow Path ofSagittarius, let the Philosophus advance, likethearrow from the centre of Qesheth, the Bow. Andas this Sign of Sagittariuslieth between the Signof Scorpio—Death and Capricornus the devil, sohad Jesus topass through the Wilderness, temptedby Satan.2nd Ad. descends to South of the Altar.2nd Ad.

This drawing represents the more ancient formof the 14th Key of Tarot,for which the later andmore usual form of Temperance was soon substi-tuted, asbetter representing the natural symbolismof the Path Sagittarius. The earlierfigure was con-sidered not so much a representation of this Pathalone, as thesynthesis of that and the others con-joined. The later figure, therefore, isbetter adaptedto the more restricted meaning. The more ancientform shows afemale figure crowned with the crownof five rays, symbolising the FivePrinciples ofNature, the concealed Spirit and the Four Elementsof Earth, Air,Water and Fire. About her head isa halo of light. On her breast is the Sun ofTiphar-< 191 >eth. The Five-rayed Crown further alludes to theFive Sephiroth Kether, Chokmah,Binah, Chesedand Geburah. Chained to her waist are a Lion andan Eagle, betweenwhich is a large cauldron whencearise steam and smoke. The Lion representstheFire in Netzach— the Blood of the Lion, and theEagle represents the Water inHod, the Gluten ofthe Eagle — whose reconcilement is made by theAir in Yesod,uniting with the volatilised Waterarising from the cauldron through theinfluence ofthe Fire beneath it. The chains which link the Lionand the Eagle toher waist, are symbolic of the Pathsof Scorpio and Capricornus as shown by theScor-pion and the Goat in the background. In her righthand, she bears the Torchof Solar Fire elevatingand volatilising the Water in Hod by the fieryinfluenceof Geburah, while with her left hand, shepours from a vase the Waters of Chesedto tem-perate and calm the Fires of Netzach. This laterform is the usual figureof Temperance, symbolisingin a more restricted form than the preceding,thepeculiar properties of this Path. It represents anAngel with the Solar emblemof Tiphareth on herbrow, and wings of the aerial and volatilisingnature, pouringtogether the fluidic Fire and thefiery Water — thus combining, harmonisingandtemperating those opposing elements.One foot rests on dry and volcanic land, in the back-ground of which is avolcano whence issues anirruption. The other foot is in the water by whosebordersprings fresh vegetation, contrasting strong-ly with the arid and dry nature ofthe distant land.On her breast is a square, the emblem of rectitude.< 192 >The whole figure is a representation of that straightand narrow way of which itis said “few there bethat find it” which alone leads to the higher andglorifiedlife. For to pursue that steady and tran-quil mean between two opposing forces,is indeeddifficult, and many are the temptations to turnaside either to theright or to the left — wherein,remember, are but to be found the menacingsym-bols of Death and the Devil.The 25th Path of the Sepher Yetzirah to which theTarot Key of Temperance isreferred, is called theIntelligence of Probation, and it is so called becauseitis the primary temptation by which the Creatortries all righteous persons. Thatis, that in it, thereis ever present the temptation to turn aside to theone handor to the other,2nd and 3rd Ads. give Cup and red lamp to Phil,who holds them in form of TauCross.Ch. Ad. Let this remind you once more, that only inand by the reconciliation ofopposing forces is thePath-way made to true occult knowledge and prac-ticalpower. Good alone is mighty and Truth aloneshall prevail. Evil is but weaknessand the powerof evil magic exists but in the contest of unbalancedforces, whichin the end, will destroy and ruin himwho hath subjugated himself thereto.

Seeing that you are now Lord of the Paths ofthe Portal of the Vault ofthe Adepti, and areentered into the Second Degree, approaching theSecond orInner Order, it is fitting that you shouldhave the knowledge of these emblems tocompleteas far as may be, your understanding of the Powersof the Officers of theFirst or Outer Order. Bothrefer in natural succession of numbers to thesixfollowing the five. Thus all progress is by steps,gradual and secure. Theinner revelation may comesuddenly to some, even in the twinkling of an eyeor itmay be after long waiting — a slow and grad-ual process from the beginning, yetever the liquidmust be prepared to the point of saturation.The Hierophant’s Lamen is a synthesis of Tiphar-eth, to which the Calvary Crossof six squares, form-ing the cube opened out, is fitly referred. The twocolours,red and green, the most active and the mostpassive, whose conjunction points outthe practicalapplication of the knowledge of equilibrium, aresymbolic of thereconciliation of the celestial es-sences of Fire and Water, for the reconcilingyellowunites with blue in green, which is the complemen-< 194 >tary colour to red, and with red in orange which isthe complementary colour toblue. The small innercircle placed upon the Cross alludes to the Rosethat isconjoined therewith in the symbolism of theRose and Cross of our Order.The field of the Banner of the East is White, thecolour of light and purity. Asin the previous case,the Calvary Cross of six squares is the number sixofTiphareth, the yellow Cross of Solar Gold, andthe cubical stone bearing in itscentre the sacred Tauof Life, and having bound together upon it the formof theMacrocosmic Hexagram, the red triangle ofFire and the blue triangle of Water —the RuachElohim and the Waters of Creation. The six anglesof the Hexagramdescribed upon the Tree of Lifewill give the Planets referred to it asfollows:Daath, Saturn; Chesed, Jupiter; Geburah, Mars;Netzaeh, Venus; Hod,Mercury; Yesod, Luna —while in the centre is the Sun of Tiphareth.Upon my breast is a symbol, which, O Lord of thePaths of the Portal of theAdepti, is as yet unknownto you. It is no Symbol of the Order of theStellaMatutina, nor of the First or Outer Order, nor evenof your Degree. It isthe symbol of the Red Rose andthe Cross of Gold, uniting the powers of the 4and5 and of the 6 within itself, but to learn its fullmeaning, it is needfulthat you be admitted to thefellowship of that other Order to which theStellaMatutina is one of the Veils. Of this matter, youhave no right to speak toany below your degree.Admission further can be earned no more by excel-lence in intellectual learningalone, though that also< I9S >is required of you. In token that ail true knowledgecometh of grace, not ofright, such admission isgranted, not on demand, but at the discretion oftheGreatly Honoured Chiefs of the Second Order.Moreover, an interval of nine monthsmust elapsebefore the Portal is again opened to you. Nine isthe number of Lunain Yesod, nine lunar monthsare the period of gestation before birth; Five isthenumber of the Pentagram of the Microcosm, theesoteric Luna number — thenumber of the Spiritand the Four Elements — of the Soul entering thebody.

By virtueof these honours and dignities, I now cometodemand my reception and acknowledgement asan Adeptus Minor of the © — E Gradeof theSecond Order.Second O Aspirant! It is written that he who exaltethhimself shall be abased,but that he who hum-bleth himself shall be exalted, and that blessedare the poorin spirit for theirs is the Kingdomof Heaven. It is not by proclamation ofhon-ours and dignities, great though they may be,that thou canst gain admissionto the Tomb ofthe Adepti of the Rose of Ruby and the Crossof God, but only bythat humility and purityof spirit that befitteth the aspirant unto higherthings.< 206 >Associate Adeptus Minor, bring unto me therecommendation and attestation whichhe bear-eth; and test thou his knowledge ere he berejected for the sins ofpresumption and spirit-ual pride.Third Thou knowest the arrangement of the Ten Se-phiroth on the Tree of Life;now what symbolicweapon doth their natural succession form?Aspirant answers unprompted.Third And what symbolic creature is traced by thenatural succession of thePaths?Aspirant answers unprompted.Second 0 Aspirant. Let this be a sign unto thee. Forthe Flaming Sword and theSerpent of Wisdomshall be the symbol which shall procure theeadmission. Returnthou then, and divest thy-self of these ornaments. They are not humbleenough toentitle thee to be received. V. H.Frater Hodos Chamelionis, clothe him intheblack robe of mourning. Let his hands be boundbehind his back, symbolic ofthe binding forceof his obligations, and put a chain about hisneck, the emblemof repentance and humility.Hodos Mighty Adeptus Major, it shall be done.Ilodos Chamelionis salutes and retires withAspirant, strips him of allornaments, bringshim back to door in plain black robe, roped andcarrying diagramof Sword and Serpent.

Therefore,even as servants look unto the hands of theirmasters andhandmaidens unto their mistresses,even so our eyes look unto Thee, for Thoualoneart our help. 0 Lord our God, who should notextol Thee. Who should notpraise Thee.All is from Thee — All belongeth unto Thee.Either Thy Love or Thy Anger all mustagainre-enter. Nothing canst Thou lose, for all musttend unto Thy Honour andMajesty.Thou are Lord alone, and there is none besideThee. Thou dost what Thou wilt withThymighty Arm, and none can escape from Thee.Thou alone helpest in theirnecessity the humble,the meek-hearted and the poor, who submitthemselves untoThee; and whosoever humblethhimself in dust and ashes before Thee, unto such< 208 >an one Thou art propitious.Who should not praise Thee, then, 0 Lord ofthe Universe, unto whom there is nonelike?Whose dwelling is in Heaven, and in every vir-tuous and God-fearing heart.0 God the VastOne, Thou art in al! things. 0 Nature, Thou Selffrom Nothing, forwhat else can I call Thee?In myself I am nothing. In Thee I am Self, andexist inThey Self-hood from Nothing. LiveThou in me, and bring me unto that Self whichisin Thee. Amen.Let the hands of the Aspirant be unbound.This is done, Aspirant remains kneeling. Officersrise.Third Think not, O Aspirant, that the trial of humilitythrough which thou hastpassed, was ordainedbut to jest with thy feelings. Far from us be anysuchdesign. But it was intended to point outto thee that the truly wise man is butlittle inhis own eyes, however great his attainmentsmay appear to the ignorant,and that even thehighest intellectual achievements are but asnothing in thesight of the Lord of the Universe,for He looketh at the heart. It is written:“WhenI consider the Heavens, the work of Thy fingers,the moon and stars whichThou hast ordained,what is man that Thou art mindful of him, orthe son of manthat thou visitest him?” Andcouldst thou even attain unto the height of aGodupon this earth, how small and insignifi-cant yet wouldst thou be in thepresence of Godthe Vast One.Second Rise, then, O Aspirant of the Rose of Ruby and< 209 >the Cross of Gold. Rise, glorified by suffering.Rise, purified by humility.Aspirant rises.Second Despise not sadness, and hate not suffering, forthey are the Initiatorsof the heart; and theblack robe of mourning which thou wearest isat once thesymbol of sorrow and of strength.Boast not thyself above thy brother if hehathfallen, for how knowest thou that thou couldsthave withstood the sametemptation. Slandernot, and revile not. If thou canst not praise, donot condemn.When thou seest another in trou-ble and humiliation, even though he be thyenemy,remember the time of thy own humili-ation when thou didst kneel before the doorofthe Tomb, clothed in the Robe of Mourning,with the Chain of Affliction aboutthy neck,and thy hands bound behind thy back, and re-joice not at his fall.And in thine intercourse with the members ofour Order, let thy hand given untoanother bea sincere and genuine pledge of fraternity. Re-spect his or hersecrets and feelings as thouwouldst respect thine own. Bear with one an-otherand forgive one another, even as the Mas-ter hath said.V. H. Frater Hodos Chamelionis, what is thesymbolic age of the Aspirant?Hodos His days are an hundred and twenty years.Second It is written: “My Spirit shall not always strivewith man, seeing that healso is flesh, yet hisdays shall be an hundred and twenty years.”< 2ro >Associate Adeptus Minor, unto what do those120 years of the Aspirant’s symbolicage corre-spond?Third To the Five Grades of the First Order throughwhich it is necessary for theAspirant to havepassed before he can enter the Tomb of theSacred Mountain. Forthe three months inter-val between the Grades of Practicus and Philos-ophus arethe Regimen of the Elements; andthe seven months between the Philosophus andthePortal symbolise the Regimen of the Plan-ets; while the Elements and the Planetsbothwork in the Zodiac; so that three plus sevenmultiplied by twelve yieldeththe number 120.Second O Aspirant, ere thou canst enter the Tomb ofthe Adepti of the Rose ofRuby and the Crossof Gold, it is necessary to take a solemn Obli-gation ofSecrecy, Fidelity, Fraternity, and Jus-tice. But as in all the previousobligations, thereis nothing contained therein contrary to thycivil, moral, orreligious duties. Art thou willingto take such a pledge?Aspirant I am.Second Let the Aspirant be bound to the Cross of Suf-fering.The Aspirant is led to the Cross, and his handsput through the running noosesand cords arebound about his waist and feet. Two Adeptistand on either side tosupport him, and ThirdAdept takes his place ready to hand Cup andDagger toSecond Adept who stands in frontof and facing Aspirant.< 211 >Second Adept holds out Rose Crucifix to Aspi-rant, saying:Second The Symbol of Suffering is the symbol ofstrength. Wherefore bound as thouart, strive toraise this holy symbol in thy hands, for he thatwill not striveshall not attain.Aspirant takes Crucifix in both hands, the cordsbeing allowed to run out longenough to allowhim to do so.Second I invoke Thee, the great avenging Angel HUA,in the divine name I AO, thatThou mayest in-visibly place Thy hand upon the head of theAspirant inattestation of his Obligation.Second Adept raises his hands on high to invoketheforce; then lowers them and takes crucifixwhich is replaced by Third Adept onAltar.Aspirant is now bound more firmly to the cross.Second Repeat after me your sacramental Name, andsay:OBLIGATIONKether I, (Christian Rosenkreutz), a member of theBody of Christ, do this dayspiritually bind my-self, even as I am now bound physically uponthe Cross ofSuffering. That I will to the utmostlead a pure and unselfish life, and willprovemyself a faithful and devoted servant of thisOrder.Binah That I will keep secret all things connectedwith the Order, and its SecretKnowledge, fromthe whole world, equally from him who is amember of the FirstOrder of the Stella Matu-tina, as from an uninitiated person, and that I< 212 >will maintain the Veil of strict secrecy betweenthe First and Second Orders.Chesed That I will uphold to the utmost the authorityof the Chiefs of the Order,and that I will notinitiate or advance any person in the FirstOrder, eithersecretly or in open Temple, with-out due authorisation and permission; thatIwill neither recommend a Candidate for admis-sion to the First Order withoutdue judgmentand assurance that he or she is worthy of sogreat confidence andhonour, nor unduly pressany person to become a candidate; and that Iwillsuperintend any examination of Membersof lower Grades without fear or favour inanyway, so that our high standard of knowdedgebe not lowered by myinstrumentality; and Ifurther undertake to see that the necessaryinterval oftime between the Grades of Practi-cus and Philosophus and between thelatterGrade and the Portal, be, when possible, main-tained.Geburah Furthermore, that I will perform all practicalwork connected with thisOrder in a place con-cealed and apart from the gaze of the outer anduninitiatedworld, and that I will not displayour Magical Implements, nor reveal the useofthe same, but will keep secret this Inner Rosi-crucian Knowledge even as thesame hath beenkept secret through the ages; that I will notmake any symbol orTalisman in the FlashingColours for any uninitiated person without aspecialpermission from the Chiefs of the Order.< 213 >That I will only perform any practical magicbefore the uninitiated which is of asimple andalready well-known nature; and that I will showthem no secret mode ofworking whatsoever,keeping strictly concealed from them our modesof Tarot andother Divination, of Clairvoyance,of Astral projection, of the Consecration ofTal-ismans and Symbols, and the Rituals of thePentagram and Hexagram, and mostespeciallyof the use and attribution of the Flashing Col-ours, and the Vibratorymode of pronouncingthe Divine Names.Tiphereth I further promise and swear that with theDivine Permission I will,from this day forward,apply myself to the Great Work — which is,to purify andexalt my Spiritual Nature so thatwith the Divine Aid I may at length attain tobemore than human, and thus gradually raiseand unite myself to my higher andDivineGenius, and that in this event I will not abusethe great power entrustedto me.Netzach I furthermore solemnly pledge myself neverto work at any importantsymbol without firstinvocating the highest Divine Names connectedtherewith, andespecially not to debase myknowledge of Practical Magic to purposes ofevil andself-seeking, and low material gain orpleasure, and if I do this,notwithstanding thismy oath, I invoke the Avenging Angel HUA,that the evil andmaterial may react on me.Hod I further promise to support the admission ofboth sexes to our Order, on aperfect equality,< 214 >and that I will always display brotherly loveand forbearance towards the membersof thewhole Order, neither slandering nor evil-speak-ing, nor repeating nortale-bearing, wherebystrife and ill-feeling may be engendered.Yesod I also undertake to work unassisted at the sub-jects prescribed for studyin the various prac-tical grades from Zelator Adeptus Minor toAdept AdeptusMinor, on pain of being de-graded to that of Lord of the Paths of the Por-talonly.Malkuth Finally, if in my travels I should meet astranger who professes to be amember of theRosicrucian Order, I will examine him with carebefore acknowledginghim to be such.Such are the words of this my Obligation as anAdeptus Minor, whereunto I pledgemyself inthe Presence of the Divine One, and of the GreatAvenging Angel, HUA,and if I fail herein —may my Rose be disintegrated and my powerin Magic cease.Third hands Dagger to Second Adept and holdsCup conveniently for him. Seconddips point ofDagger in Wine and makes Cross on Aspirant— on brow, feet, righthand and left hand, andheart, saying:(for brow) There are Three that bear witness inHeaven; the Father, the Word, andthe HolySpirit, and these Three are One.(for feet) There are Three that bear witness on Earth;the Spirit, the Water, andthe Blood, and theseThree agree in One.<2I5>{right hand) Except ye be born of Water and the Spirit,ye cannot enter theKingdom of Heaven.{left hand) If ye be crucified with Christ, ye shall alsoreign with Him.{He marks heart in silence) Then says:Second Let the Aspirant be released from the Crossof Suffering. It is written,that he who humblethhimself shall be exalted.V. H. Frater Hodos Chamelionis, remove fromthe Aspirant the Chain of Humilityand theRobe of Mourning, and re-invest him with theCrossed Sashes.This is done.Third Know, then, 0 Aspirant, that the Mysteries ofthe Rose and the Cross haveexisted from timeimmemorial, and that the Rites were practised,and the Wisdomtaught, in Egypt, Eleusis,Samothrace, Persia, Chaldea and India, and infar moreancient lands.The story of the introduction of these mysteriesinto mediaeval Europe has thusbeen handeddown to us.In 1378 was born the Chief and Originator orour Fraternity in Europe. He was ofnoble Ger-man family, but poor, and in the fifth year ofhis age was placed in acloister where he learnedboth Greek and Latin. While yet a youth heaccompanied acertain brother P. A. L. on apilgrimage to the Holy Land, but the latter,dyingat Cyprus, he himself went to Damascus.There was then in Arabia a Temple of theOrderwhich was called in the Hebrew tongue< 216 >“Damkar” O30\"1), that is “The Blood of theLamb.” There he was duly initiated,and tookthe Mystic title Christian Rosenkreutz, orChristian of the Rosy Cross.He then so far im-proved his knowledge of the Arabian tonguethat in thefollowing year he translated the book“M” into Latin, which he afterwardsbroughtback with him to Europe.After three years he went on into Egypt, wherethere was another Temple of theOrder. Therehe remained for a time still studying the mys-teries of Nature.After this, he travelled by seato the city of Fessa, where he was welcomed attheTemple there established, and he thereobtained the knowledge and theacquaintanceof the habitants of the Elements, who revealedunto him many of theirsecrets. Of the Frater-ternity he confessed that they had not retainedtheirWisdom in its primal purity, and that theirKabala was to a certain extentaltered to theirreligion. Nevertheless, he learned much there.After a stay oftwo years he came to Spain,where he endeavoured to reform the errors ofthelearned according to the pure knowledgehe had received. But it was to them alaughingmatter, and they reviled and rejected him, evenas the prophets of oldwere rejected. Thus alsowas he treated by those of his own and othernations whenhe showed them the errors thathad crept into their religions. So, after fiveyearsresidence in Germany, he initiated three of hisformer monastic brethren,Fratres G. W., I. A.,< 217>and I. O., who had more knowledge than manyothers at that time. And by thesefour was madethe foundation of the Fraternity in Europe.These worked and studiedat the writings andother knowledge which C. R. C. had broughtwith him, and bythem was some of the MagicalLanguage transcribed (which is that of theEle-mental Tablets) and a Dictionary thereof made;and the Rituals and part ofthe Book “M” weretranscribed.For the True Order of the Rose Cross descend-eth into the depths, and ascendethinto theheights — even unto the Throne of God Him-self, and includeth evenArchangels, Angels andSpirits.These four Fratres also erected a building toserve for the Temple andHeadquarters of theirOrder, and called it the Collegium ad SpiritumSanctum, orthe College of the Holy Spirit. Thisbeing now finished, and the work ofestablish-ing the Order extremely heavy, and because theydevoted much time timeto the healing of thosesick and possessed, who resorted to them, theyinitiatedfour others, viz.: Fratres R. C. (theson of the deceased father’s brother of C.R. C.),C. B. a skilful artist, G. C., and P. D., who wasto be Cancellarius; allbeing Germans except1. A., and now eight in number. Their agreementwas:r. That none of them should profess any otherthing, than but to cure the sick,and that freely.2. That they should not be constrained to wear< 218 >any distinctive dress, but therein follow thecustom of the country.3. That every year on the day of CorpusChristi, they should meet at theCollegium adSpiritum Sanctum, or write the cause of absence.4. Every one should look for some worthy per-son of either sex, who after hisdecease mightsucceed him.5. The word R.C. to be their mark, seal, andcharacter.The Fraternity to remain secret for one hun-dred years. Five of the Fratres wereto travelin different countries, and two were to remainwith ChristianRosenkreutz.Second Frater I.O. was the first to die, and then in Eng-land where he hadwrought many wonderfulcures. He was an expert Kabbalist as his book“H”witnesseth. His death had been previouslyforetold him by C. R. C. But those whowerelater admitted were of the First Order, and knewnot when C. R. died, andsave what they learnedfrom Frater A., the successor of D, of the Sec-ond Orderand from their library after his death,knew little of the earlier and higherMembers,and of the Founder, nor yet whether those ofthe Second Order wereadmitted to the Wisdomof the highest members. The discovery then ofthe Tombwherein that highly illuminatedMan of God, our Father C. R. C., wasburiedoccurred as follows.After Frater A. died in Gallia Narbonensi, theresucceeded in his place Frater N.N. He, while< 219 >repairing a part of the building of the Collegeof the Holy Spirit, endeavouredto remove abrass memorial tablet which bore the names ofcertain brethren, andsome other things. In thistablet was the head of a strong nail or bolt, sothatwhen the tablet was forcibly wrenchedaway it pulled with it a large stone whichthuspartially uncovered a secret door, {he drawsback curtain, revealing door),upon which wasinscribed in large letters “Post CXX AnnosPatebo”— After anhundred and twenty yearsI shall open, with the year of our Lord under,1484.Frater N. N., and those with him thencleared away the rest of the brickwork, butletit remain that night unopened as they wishedfirst to consult the ROTA.Third You will now quit the Portal for a short time,and on your return theCeremony of Openingthe Tomb will be proceeded with. Take withyou this Wand andCrux Ansata, which willensure your re-admission.Aspirant goes out, carrying the Wand and Cruxof Chief Adept.SECOND POINTPrepare Tomb as in diagram. Chief Adept liesin Pastos on his back to representC. R. C.He is clothed in full Regalia; on his breast is thecomplete Symbol ofthe Rosy Cross suspendedfrom the double Phoenix Collar. His arms arecrossed onbreast, and he holds Crook andScourge; between them lies the book “T”. Lid< 220 >Picture #27 [images/img_0027.png]< 221 >of Pastos closed and Circular Altar stands overit. Other Adepti outside Tomb asbefore. Onthe Altar are replaced Rose Cross, Cup of Wine,Chain and Dagger.Second Associate Adeptus Minor, let the Aspirant nowbe admitted.Third Ad. opens the door, and admits Aspirant,who carries Wand and Crux ofChief. He is placedin front of and facing Vault Door.Second Before the Door of the Tomb, as symbolic Guar-dians, are the ElementalTablets, and the Keru-bic Emblems, even as before the mystical Gateof Eden stoodthe watchful Kerubim, and theSword of Flame. These Kerubic Emblem bethe powersof the Angles of the Tablets. TheCircle represents the four Angles boundto-gether in each Tablet through the operation ofthe all-pervading Spirit, whilethe Cross withinforms with its spokes the Wheels of Ezekiel’sVision; andtherefore are the Cross and the Cir-cle white to represent the purity of theDivineSpirit. And inasmuch as we do not find the Ele-ments unmixed, but eachbound together witheach — so that in the Air we find not only thatwhich issubtle and tenuous, but also the quali-ties of heat, moisture and dryness, boundto-gether in that all-wandering Element; and fur-ther also that in Fire, Waterand Earth we findthe same mixture of Nature — therefore theFour Elements arebound to each Kerubic Em-blem counterchanged with the colour of theElementwherein they operate; even as in the< 222 >Vision of Ezekiel each Kerub had four faces andfour wings. Forget not thereforethat the Tab-lets and the Kerubim are the Guardians of theTomb of the Adepti.Let thy tongue keep silenceon our mysteries. Restrain even the thought ofthyheart lest a bird of the air carry the matter.Third Upon more closely examining the Door of theTomb, you will perceive, evenas Frater N. N.,and those with him did perceive, that beneaththe CXX in theinscription were placed thecharacters IX thus:POST CXX ANNOS PATEBOIXbeing equivalent to Post Annos Lux CrucisPatebo— At the end of 120 years, I, theLightof the Cross, will disclose myself. For the lettersforming LVX are madefrom the dismemberedand conjoined angles of the Cross; and 120 isthe product ofthe numbers from 1 to 5, multi-plied in regular progression, which number fiveissymbolised in the Cross with four extremitiesand one centre point.Second On the following morning, Frater N. N. and hiscompanions forced open thedoor (he opens itwide) and there appeared to their sight a Tombof Seven Sidesand Seven Corners. Every sidewas five feet broad, and eight feet high, evenasthe same is faithfully represented before you.Second Adept enters and passes byNorth toEast of Vault, and turns to face West. ThirdAdept places Aspirant onNorth facing South,and takes his place at South facing North.< 223 >Second Although in the Tomb the Sun does not shine,it is lit by the symbolicRose of our Order in thecentre of the first heptagona! ceiling. In themidst ofthe Tomb stands a circular Altar withthese devices and descriptions on it:A.G.R.C.—Ad Gloriam Roseae Crucis.A.C.R.G.—Ad Crucis Rosae Gloriam.Hoc Universal Compendium Unius MihiSepulchrum Feci —Unto the Glory of the Rose Cross I have con-structed this Tomb for myself as aCompendiumof the Universal Unity.Within the next circle is written:Yeheshua Mihi Omnia — Yeheshua is allthings to me.In the centre are four figures of the Kerubimenclosed within circles surroundedby the fol-lowing four inscriptions and each distinguishedby one of the lettersof the Tetragrammaton: —Yod — Lion — Nequaquam Vacuum —Nowhere a Void.Hell — Eagle — Libertas Evangelii —Liberty of the Gospel.Vau — Man — Dei Intacta Gloria ■—■Unsullied Glory of God.Heh(f)—Ox — Legis JugumYoke of the Law.and in the midst of all is Shin, the Letter of theSpirit forming thus the DivineName Yeheshua,from the Tetragrammaton. Therefore, by God’sGrace, having comethus far, let us kneel downtogether, and say:< 224 >All kneel, joining wands above Altar.Second Unto Thee, Sole Wise, Sole Mighty and SoleEternal One, be praise andGlory forever, Whohas permitted this Aspirant who now kneelethbefore Thee topenetrate thus far into the Sanc-tuary of Thy Mysteries. Not unto us, butuntoThy Name be the Glory. Let the influence ofThy Divine Ones descend upon hishead, andteach him the value of self-sacrifice, so that heshrink not in the hourof trial, but that thus hisname may be written on high, and that hisGenius maystand in the presence of the HolyOnes, in that hour when the Son of Man isin-voked before the Lord of Spirits and His Namein the presence of the Ancientof Days.It is written: “If any man will come after Me,let him take up his cross, anddeny himself, andfollow Me.”Third Adept hands Cham to Aspirant, and takesWand and Cross from him.Second Take therefore this Chain, O Aspirant, and placeit about thy neck andsay: I accept the Bondsof Suffering and Self-Sacrifice.znd and 3rd Adepts rise.Aspirant repeats wordsas directed.Second Rise, then, my Frater, in the symbol of self-renunciation and extendthine arms in the formof a cross.Aspirant rises, feet together, and arms extended.Second Associate Adeptus Minor, take from the Altarthe Dagger of Penance and theCup of Tribu-lation, that I may confirm the vow of the< 225 >Aspirant forever by marking him afresh withthe Stigmata of the Cross.Second takes Dagger from Third and marksAspirant anew as at Obligation: brow,feet, righthand, left hand, and heart. Gives Dagger backto Third who replaces iton Altar, and then handsAspirant the Rose Crucifix.Second Take that symbol, raise it with both handsabove thy head and say: “Thuswill I uphold theSign of Suffering and of Strength.” And I heardthe voice of theKing of Earth cry aloud andsay: “He that aideth me in my suffering, thesameshall partake with me in my rising.” Re-place then, O Aspirant, that Cross upontheAltar, and say: “In and by that Sign, I demandthat the Pastos of our Founderbe opened, formy victory is in the Cross of the Rose.”For it is written “If ye be crucified with Christ,ye shall also reign with Him.”Aspirant replaces Crucifix and repeats wordsas directed. Third gives him backWand andCrux of Chief Adept. Second and Third Adeptsmove away Altar revealingupper part of Pastos.They open lid, disclosing Chief Adept within.Third And the Light shineth in Darkness, and thedarkness comprehendeth it not.Second Touch with the head of thy Wand the Rose andCross upon the breast of theForm before thee,and say: “Out of the darkness, let the light* >5arise.Done. Chief, without moving or opening hiseyes, says:< 226 >Chief Buried with that Light in a mystical death,rising again in a mysticalresurrection, cleansedand purified through Him our Master, O Broth-er of theCross and the Rose. Like Him, 0Adepts of all ages, have ye toiled. Like Himhaveye suffered tribulation. Poverty, torture anddeath have ye passed through.They have beenbut the purification of the Gold.In the alembic of thine heart, through theathanor of affliction, seek thou thetrue stoneof the Wise.Aspirant gives Wand and Crux to Chief Adeptwho gives in exchange the Crook andScourge.Chief Quit then, this Tomb, O Aspirant, with thinearms crossed upon thy breast,bearing in thyright hand the Crook of Mercy and in thy leftthe Scourge ofSeverity, the emblems of thoseEternal Forces betwixt which the equilibriumof theUniverse dependeth; those forces whosereconciliation is the Key of Life, whosesepa-ration is evil and death. Therefore thou art in-excusable, whosoever thouart, that judgestanother, for in that thou condemnest another,thou condemnestbut thyself. Be thou thereforemerciful, even as thy Father who is in Heavenismerciful. Remember that tremendous Obli-gation of rectitude and self-sacrificewhich thouhast voluntarily taken upon thyself, and trem-ble thereat. And let thehumble prayer of thyheart be: “God, be merciful to me a sinner, andkeep me inthe pathway of Truth.”Thus, then, did Frater N. N. and his compan-< 227 >Thirdions, having moved aside the Circular Altar,and having raised the brazen plateor lid of thePastos, discover the body of our Founder, withall the ornaments andinsignia as here shownbefore you. Upon his breast was the Book “T”,a scrollexplaining in full the mystic Tarot; atthe end of which was written a briefparagraphconcerning Christian Rosenkreutz, beneathwhich the earlier Fratres hadinscribed theirnames. Following this came the names of thethree Highest Chiefsof the Order, viz:Frater Hugo Alverda, the Phrisian, in the576th year of his age.Frater Franciscus de Bry, the Gaul, in the495th year of his age.Frater Elman Zata, the Arab, in the 463rdyear of his age.Last of all was written: Ex Deo Nascimur; InYchcshuah Morimur; Per SpiritumSanctumReviviscimus. “In God are we born, in Yehesh-uah we die, through the HolySpirit we riseagain.”They renclose the Pastos, and replace Altar.Second So, then, our Frater N. N. and his companionsreclosed the Pastos for atime, set the Altar overit, shut the Door of the Tomb, and placed theirsealsupon it.All quit the Vault. Aspirant carries Crook andScourge; the door is closed, andAspirant is ledout of the Portal. The Tomb is then re-openedand Chief Adeptreleased.< 228 >THIRD POINTTomb prepared as in diagram.

It is, as thou seest, thediagram of the Sephiroth and the Paths, withthecolours appropriately attributed thereto.See that thou reveal it not to theprofane, formany and great are its mysteries.Kether is the highest of all, and herein scintil-lates the Divine WhiteBrilliance, concerningwhich it is not fitting that I should speak morefully.Chokmah is Grey, the mixture of colours.< 234 >Binah is darkness, the absorption of colours.And thus is the Supernal Triadcompleted. InKether is the root of the Golden Glory, andthence is the yellowreflected into Tiphareth.In Chokmah is the root of Blue, and this isreflectedinto Chesed; in Binah is the root ofRed, and this is reflected into Geburah.Andthus is the first reflected Triad completed. Thebeams of Chesed and Tipharethmeet in Net-zach and yield Green. The beams of Geburahand Tiphareth meet in Ilodand yield a tawnyOrange. The beams of Chesed and Geburahfall in Yesod and yieldPurple. And thus is theThird Triad completed. And from the rays ofthe ThirdTriad are these three colours shownin Malkuth, together with a fourth which isthesynthesis. For from the Orange Tawny of Hodand the Greening Nature of Netzachis reflecteda certain Greenish Citrine — Citron; from theOrange Tawny mixed withthe Puce of Yesodproceedeth a red russet Brown — Russet; andfrom the Green andthe Puce cometh a certainother darkening green — Olive. The synthesisof allthese is blackness and bordereth on theQlippoth.But the colours of the 22 Paths are derived fromand find their roots in those ofthe First Re-flected Triad of the Sephiroth, the Three Super-nals not otherwiseentering into their compo-sition, and thus are their positive colours found.Untothe Air is ascribed the Yellow colour ofTiphareth. Unto the Water is ascribedthe Blue< 235 >Colour of Chesed. Unto the Fire is ascribed theRed Colour of Geburah. Thecolours are to befound in Malkuth.Those of the Planets are in the Rainbow scale;thus: Saturn — Indigo; Jupiter —Violet; Mars— Red; Sol — Orange; Mercury — Yellow;Venus — Green; Luna — Blue.Unto the Signs of the Zodiac are ascribed thefollowing: Aries — Scarlet; Taurus— Red-Orange; Gemini — Orange; Cancer — Amber;Leo — Greenish-Yellow; Virgo —Yellowish-Green; Libra — Emerald; Scorpio — Greenish-Blue; Sagittarius — Blue;Capricornus — In-digo; Aquarius — Purple; Pisces — Crimson.Further, thou wiltobserve that the colours ofthe Paths and the Sephiroth form a mutual bal-anceand harmony on the Tree. Colours areForces, the Signatures of the Forces; andtheChild of the Children of the Forces art thou.And therefore about the Throneof the MightyOne is a Rainbow of Glory, and at His Feet isthe Crystal Sea. Butthere are many other attri-butions of colour also, seeing that therespectiverays meet and blend with each other. And there-fore do I greet theewith the Mystic Title of“Hodos Chamelionis”, the Path of the Chame-lion, thePath of Mixed Colours, and I give theethe Symbol of Hiddekel, the Third Riverwhichfloweth towards the East of Assiah.They return to Altar, and 2nd Adept indicatesCrook and Scourge thereon.Second The colours of the Crook and Scourge are takenfrom those of the MinutumMundum Diagram,< 236 >and they thus represent the just equilibriumbetween Mercy and Severity on theTree ofLife. The Crook therefore is divided into thecolours symbolic of: Kether,Aleph, Chokmah,Taurus, Chesed, Leo, Tiphareth, Aries, Hod,Capricornus. And theScourge into those sym-bolising: Netzach, Scorpio, Tiphareth, Gemini,Binah,Cancer, Geburah. Mem.Third (indicates Sword and Serpent) The colours ofthe Minutum Mundum are alsothe key to thosewhich compose the Admission Badge of theSword and Serpent; andthus by their aid itmay be the better examined and comprehended.The one isascending, the other is descending;the one is fixed, the other is volatile; theoneunites the Sephiroth, the other the Paths. Fur-thermore, in the Serpent ofWisdom is shownthe ascending Spiral, and in the Sword the rushof the descendingWhite Brilliance from beyondKether, differentiated into various shadesandcolours, darkening more and more as they nearMalkuth.Chief (indicates Diagram of Mountain) This is thesymbolic Mountain of God in thecentre of theUniverse, the sacred Rosicrucian Mountain ofInitiation, the MysticMountain of Abiegnus.Below and around it are darkness and silence,and it iscrowned with the Light ineffable. Atits base is the Wall of Enclosure andSecrecy,whose sole Gateway, invisible to the profane, isformed of the TwoPillars of Hermes. The ascentof the Mountain is by the Spiral Path of theSerpentof Wisdom. Stumbling on between the< 237 >Pillars is a blindfolded figure, representing theNeophyte, whose ignorance andworthlessnesswhile only in that Grade is shown by the © = GO,and whose solefuture claim to notice and rec-ognition by the Order is the fact of hishavingentered the Pathway to the other Grades, untilat length he attains to thesummit.I now proceed to instruct you in the mystic sym-bolism of the Tomb itself. Letthe Altar bemoved aside. {Done) It is divided into threeparts — the Ceilingwhich is White; the Hep-tagonal Walls of seven Rainbow colours, andthe Floorwhose prevailing hue is black; thusshowing the powers of the Hep tad betweentheLight and the Darkness.On the ceiling is a Triangle enclosing a Rose of22 petals, within a Heptangleformed of a Hep-tagram reflected from the Seven Angles of theWall. The Trianglerepresents the Three Super-nal Sephiroth; the Heptagram, the LowerSeven; theRose represents the 22 paths of theSerpent of Wisdom.The Floor has upon it also the Symbol of a Tri-angle enclosed within aHeptagram, bearing thetitles of the Averse and Evil Sephiroth of theQlippoth,the Great Red Dragon of SevenHeads, and the inverted and evil triangle. Andthusin the Tomb of the Adepti do we treaddown the Evil Powers of the Red Dragon(ChiefAdept stamps thrice on diagram) and so treadthou upon the evil powers ofthy nature.

The remaining squares representthe Kerubim and the EternalSpirit, the ThreeAlchemic Principles, the Three Elements, theSeven Planets, andthe Twelve Signs, all oper-ating in and differentiating the rays of eachplanet.Note that in all, the Central Uppersquare alone remains white and unchanged,rep-resenting the changeless Essence of the DivineSpirit, thus developing allfrom the One, throughthe Many under the government of One.The colours of the varying squares may be eitherrepresented by the colour of thePlanet and thecolour of the Force therein mixed together, or< 240 >Picture #32 [images/img_0032.png]< 241 >Picture #33 [images/img_0033.png]Picture #34 [images/img_0034.png]Picture #35 [images/img_0035.png]Picture #36 [images/img_0036.png]by these colours being placed in juxtaposition,or in any other convenientmanner; but thefoundation of them all is the Minutum Mun-dum Diagram.The symbolism of the Altar was briefly explainedto you in the Second point.

And it is so assumed ac-cordingly.Second Cum Potestate et Gloria.Third Amen!< 251 >The Chiefs are seated.Chief Fratres et Sorores of the Roseae Rubeae etAureae Crucis. We know that theMystic Tem-ple, which was erected of old by Wisdom, as aWitness of the Mysterieswhich are above theSphere of Knowledge, doth abide in the Super-nal Triad — inthe Understanding which tran-scends Reason, in the Wisdom which comes be-foreUnderstanding and in the Crown whichis the Light of the Supernals. We know thattheShekinah, the co-habiting Glory, dwelt in theInner Sanctuary, but the firstCreation wasmade void. The Holy Place was made waste andthe Sons of the House ofWisdom were takenaway into the captivity of the Senses. We haveworshipped sincethen in a house made withhands, receiving a Sacramental Ministration bya derivedLight in place of the Co-habitingGlory. And yet, amidst Signs and SymbolstheTokens of the Higher Presence have never beenwanting in our hearts. By theWaters of Baby-lon we have sat down and wept, but we haveever remembered Zion,and that Memorial is aWitness testifying that we shall yet return withexultationinto the House of our Father. As aWitness in the Temple of the Heart, so intheOuter House of our Initiation, we have everpresent certain Watchers fromwithin, deputedby the Second Order to guard and lead theLesser Mysteries of theStella Matutina andthose who advance therein, that they may befitted in duecourse to participate in the Lightwhich is beyond it. It is in virtue of thisconnect-<252>ing link, this bond of consanguinity, that I haveassumed the things which arewithout in theTemple of the Stella Matutina into the thingswhich are within thecompany of the SecondOrder at this secret meeting held at theEquinox for the solemn purpose of proclaiminga new Hierophant charged with theRites of theTemple during the ensuing six months, beinga part of the temporaryperiod which intervenesbetween us and our rest.Second Let us work, therefore, my Brethren and effectrighteousness, because theNight cometh.Third Wherein no man shall labour.Chief (rises) Fratres and Sorores of the Roseae Rubeaeet Aureae Crucis, by thepower in me vested, Iproceed to the installation and investiture oftheHierophant of the Stella Matutina Templein the Order of the R.

TheVery HonouredAdeptus Secundus will now de-liver the Charge before Installation, (he sitsdown)Second (rises) The high Office to which you have beenappointed by the decree ofthe Chiefs of theSecond Order involves duties of a solemn kindand their properfulfilment is a sacred responsi-bility which rests for a period upon you.Whilethe rule of the Outer Order is more particularlycommitted to the Imperator,while the instruc-tion of its members is entrusted to the Praemon-strator aboveall, and the general business ofthe Temple devolves especially upon theCan-cellarius, amidst the distinction of these servicesthere is still a commonground of interactionwhich must be maintained by a perfect adjust-ment to ensurethe right conduct and harmonyof the whole. In like manner, the Chief Officers< 254 >of the Temple are distinct and yet allied; theperfection and beauty of itsRitual depends in-deed upon the Hierophant as the Expounder ofthe Mysteries, butnot on him alone. For allmust work together to encompass the good of all.Iinvite you, therefore, not only to take counselwith the Chiefs of the SecondOrder on all im-portant occasions and to maintain a regularcommunication withthe Guardians of the OuterTemple, but to consult and assist the LesserOfficersso that these Rites which, under the Su-preme Authority, are about to be placedin yourhands, may, after your term of Office, be restoredto the Chief Adept notmerely intact in theirworking but showing an increased beauty anda greater Lightof Symbolism.

H. Frater, N.O.M.Among those characteristics which are truly neces-sary in the pursuit of magicalknowledge and power,there is hardly any one more essential than thorough-ness.And there is no failing more common in modernlife than superficiality.There are many who, even in this grade which hasbeen gained by serious study,after being charmed andinstructed by the first view of the Vault ofChristianRosencreutz, have made no attempt to study it as anew theme. There aremany who have attended manyceremonial admissions and yet know nothing oftheattribution of the seven sides, and nothing of theemblematic arrangement ofthe forty squares uponeach side.Some of you do not even know that Venus is in anastrological sense misplacedamong the sides, and nottwo in five have been able to tell me why this is so,orwhat is the basis of the arrangement of the seven colorsand forces. Many havetold me which element out ofthe four is missing, and others have told me thatthesign Leo occurs twice, but very few can tell me whythe two forms of Leo arein different colours in eachcase, and only a few can tell me withouthesitationwhich Three Sephiroth have no planet attached.And yet even in the ®—P grade you are told you mustanalyse and comprehend thatLight or Knowledge, and< 280 >not only take it on personal authority. Let us then beAdepti in fact, and notonly on the surface; let our inves-tigations be more than skin deep. That onlywhich youcan demonstrate is really known to you, and that onlywhich iscomprehended can fructify and become spir-itual progress as distinguished fromintellectual gain.Unless you can perceive with the soul as well as seewith theeye your progress is but seeming, and you willcontinue to wander in the wilds ofthe unhappy.Let your maxim be Midtum non multa — Much,rather than many things. And tremblelest the Masterfind you wanting in those things you allow it to besupposed thatyou have become proficient in. Hypocrisydoes not become the laity; it is a fatalflaw in the char-acter of the occultist. You know it is not only the teacherinthis Hall before whom you may be humiliated, butbefore your higher and divineGenius who can in nowise be deceived by outward seeming, but judgeth youby theheart, in that your spiritual heart is but thereflection of his brightness andthe image of his person,even as Maikuth is the material image of Tiphareth,andTiphareth the reflection of the crowned Wisdomof Kether, and the concealed One.There is but a couple of pages in the 5-6 Ritual whichrefer to the symbolism ofthe seven sides of the Vault.Read them over carefully, and then let us studythesethings together. First, the seven sides as a group, andthen the fortysquares that are on each side.The seven sides are all alike in size and shape andsubdivision, and the fortysquares on each side bearthe same symbols. But the colouring is varied intheextreme, no two sides are alike in tint, and none of the< 281 >squares are identical in colour excepting the singlecentral upper square of eachwall, that square bearingthe Wheel of the Spirit. The Seven walls are undertheplanetary presidency, one side to each planet. The sub-sidiary squaresrepresent the colouring of the combinedforces of the planet; the symbol of eachsquare is rep-resented by the ground colour, while the symbol is inthe colourcontrasted or complementary to that ofthe ground.Now these planetary sides are found to be m a specialorder, neither astronomicalnor astrological. The com-mon order of the succession of the planets is thatdefinedby their relative distances from Earth, putting the Sun,however, in theEarth’s place in the series thus: Saturn,Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury,Moon. Saturn isfarthest from the Earth, and the Earth is between Marsand Venus.Beginning with Saturn in the case of theWalls of the Vault, the order is Saturn,Jupiter, Mars,Sun, Mercury, Venus, Moon, Elere Mercury and Venusare transposed.But there is something more than this. For Saturn,the farthest off, is neitherthe door nor the East, noranywhere else that is obviously intended. For it isthecorner between the South and the South-West sides.Nor is Luna, at the otherend of the scale, in any nota-ble position on the old lines.There is, then, a new key to their order to be foundand used, and such as arevery intuitive see it at aglance. The planets are in the order of theRainbowcolours, and in colours because this Adeptus Minorgrade is the especialexponent of colours. You Adept!are in the Path of the Chamelion — HodosChamelionis.< 282 >If now you take the planetary colours and affix theplanets and arrange them inthe order of the solar spec-trum and then bend up the series into a ring andmakethe chain into a Heptagram, and turn the whole aboutuntil you get the twoends of the series to meet at theEastern point, you will have this mysterium:Violet—Jupiter. Indigo—Saturn. Blue—Moon.Green—Venus. Yellow—Mercury. Orange—Sun.Red—Mars.Science teaches, and has rediscovered a great truth,that however valuable theseven colours of the prismmay be, there are rays invisible and so notdemonstratedhere by space. Beyond the red end of the spectrumbegins the violet,and these have a great chemical orYctsiratic force. These forces, ever presentand unseen,are represented by the Chief Adept standing erect atthe Easternangle, the most powerful person in thegroup, and delegate of the Chiefs of theSecond Order,and through them of the mystic Third Order. He itis who has,symbolically, at any rate, passed from deathunto life, and holds the Keys of allthe creeds. And heit is who may place in our hands the Keys of the lockedPalaceof the King if we are able to make our knockingheard. Representing the East,coming from the East,he faces the Western world, bringing intuition withhim;before him lies the symbolic body of our MasterC.R.C., our grand exemplar andfounder — or at othertimes, the empty pastos, from which he has arisen, theChiefAdept.He has Mars and Geburah at his right hand, andJupiter and Gedulah at his lefthand. He faces Venusin the West, the Evening Star, which represents the<283 >entry of the Candidate who has toiled all day until theevening. At even heenters the Western door of theplanet Venus, that sole planet unto whose symbolaloneall the Sephiroth are conformed. At “evening time thereshall be light,” thelight of the mixed colours. So thenewly admitted Adept comes in contact withtotalityof the planetary forces for the first time. A great oppor-tunity opensbefore him; let him see well that he useit worthily. He enters through the greenside of thevault. Green is the colour of growth; let him see thathe grows.Upon each side of the vault are forty squares, fivevertical series and eighthorizontal, the whole beingsymbolically 5'x8'. Now the published and printedFamaFraternatitas says these forty feet were dividedinto ten squares. If you aremathematicians you wouldknow that ten similar squares could not alone beplacedin such an area and yet fill it. Ten squares alone to filla rectanglecould only be placed in an area of the shape5' x 6'. Hence in the Fama, tensquares is a blind whichwe know to represent “Ten Squares are markedandsalient”—they are the Sephiroth.Besides the Ten Sephiroth, there are the following:There are the Four Kerubim,Three Alchemical Prin-ciples, Three Elements, Seven Planets, TwelveZodiacalSigns, One Wheel of the Spirit — thus 40 in all. TheSpirit wheel is onevery side and always in the centre,and is always depicted unchanged in blackupon white.Upon the sides there are always the 4 Kerubic em-blems— zodiacal, yet different,for the Eagle replacesScorpio. (Scorpio has three forms, the Scorpion, theEagle,and the Snake for the evil aspect.)< 284 >These Kerubim represent the letters of the nameYHVH, and note that they arealways arranged in theHebrew order of the letters. Yod for the Lion, Heh fortheEagle, Vau for the Man, Heh final for the Ox, theTauric Earth.Note that these four Zodiacal signs are not in theirown colours, but as symbolsof the elements have ele-mentary colours. As Zodiacal signs, then, they arefoundto be compounds of the zodiacal and planet colours;but they are here asKerubic emblems compounded ofthe Elemental colour and the Planetary colour oftheside.The Three Principles are composed of the colour ofthe Principles, and the colourof the Planet of any par-ticular wall. Mercury being fundamentally blue,Sul-phur red, and Salt yellow.The Three Elements have fundamentally the usualthree colours, Fire red, Waterblue, Air yellow. Notethat Earth is missing.The Seven planets have their colours as are oftenstated, and note that each ofthe seven is set beside itsappropriate Sephira, so that there are threeSephirothwhich have no Planet; Kether, Chokmah, and Malkuth.The 12 Zodiacal Signs are the lower portion of thesides of the vertical column.The central one has noneof the twelve; they are so allotted between thefourremaining columns. Further note that they are onlythree ranks, the 5th, 7th,and 8th; none are in the 6thrank from above.This arrangement then shows: Four Triplidties andthree Quaternaries. Observewell the arrangement; itis complex but not confused.< 285 >1. Kerubic.2. Cardinal.Fixed. Shining Rank.Fiery. Solar Rank.3. Common (mutable). Airy. Subtle Rank.From above down, or in columns these are: EarthySigns. Airy Signs. Watery Signs.Fiery Signs.Rank 5. The Kerubic line shows the signs in theorder of Tetragrammaton read inHebrew.Rank 7. The Cardinal line shows the signs from theright in the order ofastronomical sequence of the solarcourse; vernal equinox, summer solstice,autumn equi-nox, winter solstice.Rank 8. The common line shows the Signs again ina different position. Here theearliest in the year isGemini on the left of Mem, and passing left to Virgo,youthen go round to extreme right to Sagittarius, passcentrewards to Pisces closeto Malkuth.The colouring of each square is dual — a ground col-our, and the colour of theemblem. The ground colouris a compound of the colour of the Planet of thesidetinting the colour of the Force to which the Square isallotted.Each side has the Square of its own planet in its ownunmixed colour, and withthis exception all the colouredgrounds are compound. The emblem colour isalwayscomplementary to the ground colour.The ritual of the Adeptus Minor gives the definitecolours of each planet andsign which are to be usedin this system. There are other allotments of colourtoeach of these symbols and forces, but these areretained as mysteries yet to beevolved and revealedwhen you have become familiar with the present sim-ple andelementary system.< 286 >CONCERNING THE USE OF THE VAULTBy G. H. Frater, F. R.The Vault of the Adepti may be said to represent orsymbolise various things;first of course, it is the sym-bolic burying place of our Founder C. R. C. It isalsothe mystic Cavern in the Sacred Mountain of Initiation.— Abiegnus; andtherefore it is the Chamber of Initi-ation wherein, after passing through thepreliminarytraining of the Outer, we are received into the Portalof the Vault ofthe Rose of Ruby and the Cross of Gold.All who are eligible should use the Vault when it isin its place. When workingit is well to be clothed inthe White Robe and yellow sash, yellow slippersandyellow and white Nemyss on your head. Rose Crossshould be upon the breast.Remember that within theVault you never use a banishing Ritual. The chamberishighly charged by the Ceremonies which have beenheld there and the atmospherethus created should notbe disturbed.At first I do not recommend you to fast as a prelim-inary. Though later on whenyou set yourselves to attainsome definite point, this may be necessary. Beingthenclothed, and at peace, you enter the Vault, light thecandle, and kindleeither a pastile in the small censeror, if you prefer it, some incense in thelarger one. Placea chair as near East as you can, and having shut thedoor standin the East, facing West, the door by whichyou entered, the wall bearing thesymbol of Venus. Now< 287>cross your hands upon your breast in the Sign of OsirisArisen, breathe in afourfold rhythm, regularly, andcompose your mind. Then being calm andcollected,make the full L V X Signs, repeating the accompanyingwords, andendeavour to bring down the Divine WhiteBrilliance. Having done this, seatyourself, and giveyourself up to meditation, tranquil and without fear.At firsttry to feel, it may be, or to see the play of thecolours as they pass and repassfrom side to side andfrom square to square. Then await with serene expec-tationwhat message may be vouchsafed to you. Whenyou are used to the place it is wellto extinguish the light,for the darker the material atmosphere the better itis.Before leaving the Vault make the L. V. X. Signs,and quit it with arms crossedupon breast in the Signof Osiris risen.If you have elected to work in a group of two or three,proceed in the samemanner, but take care to placeyourselves in balanced disposition. Let me warnyounever to argue, even in a friendly manner, while in theVault. It may oftenhappen that one of you sees moreor less differently from the others. In thiscase makean audible note of the differences but do not go on todiscuss it tillyou have ended the sitting, as any discus-sion is apt to disturb the delicatecurrents and so breakthe thread of your vision. It is permissible to takenotesin writing during the sitting, but on the whole it is per-haps moresatisfactory to impress everything clearly onyour mind and write it downimmediately afterward.The next seven visits should be devoted to a care-ful study of each side of theVault in turn, recallingall you know about each before you begin, and havingyourqueries defined before you expect replies.< 288 >Another time, contemplate the roof, and if you feelstrong enough, the floor. Butit is best for you to havean advanced Adept with you for the latter. Againyoumay draw aside the Altar, lift the lid of the Pastos andcontemplate thefigure you may perceive lying withinit. For this you should have a small candlelit on theAltar. Or you may lie down in the Pastos yourself andmeditate there.Sometimes you may see the simulacrumof C. R. C. in the Pastos, or it may be yourown HigherSelf. In every case you should gain knowledge, power,and satisfaction.If you do not, you may be sure youare either acting from a wrong motive, or youare notphysically strong enough, or your methods are at fault.No normal personin a good state of mind can possiblyspend half an hour in this way withoutfeeling betterfor it. But if you should happen to be out of harmonywith yoursurroundings or at variance with your neigh-bours, leave there thy gift beforethe Altar, and go thyway, first be reconciled.When more than one person enters the Vault theymust all make the L V X Signstogether.< 289 >U nofficialTHE THREE CHIEFSBy Frater A. M. A. G.The first Temple founded in England in 1887-88under the governance of theHermetic Order of theGolden Dawn was named very appropriately Isis-Urania.Isis-Urania is Venus, and she is the occult planetwhich represents the Genius ofthis Order — Venus,the Evening and the Morning Star, presaging the risingof theSun of ineffable Light. Venus is also, as Isis, asymbol of the QabalisticShekinah, the Glory of thePresence Divine, the Holy Spirit. After the Revoltinthe Order about 1900, the schismatic sect appropriatedas the name of theirOrder, Stella Matutina, the Morn-ing Star, thus continuing the significance ofthe enlight-ening function and purpose for which the Order wasfoundedoriginally. For, if one may speak of the Orderas having a specific purpose, thenthat sublime motiveis to bring each man to the perfection of his own Kether,tothe glory of his own higher Genius, to the splendourof the Golden Dawn arisingwithin the heart of his soul.And its technique is always encompassed throughtheuplifting of the heart and mind by a theurgic invocationto Isis-Urania, thesymbolic personification of theSephiroth of the Supernal Light.It is well known that Venus is a planet peculiarlyassociated with occult andmystical aspiration. In theSecret Doctrine we find Blavatsky stating that“Venus,or Lucifer, the planet, is the light-bearer of our Earth,< 290 >in both a physical and mystical sense.” And in quotingfrom the Stanzas of Dzyan,she presents the statementthat “Thus Earth is the adopted child andyoungerbrother of Venus.” Hence a good deal of wisdom is con-cealed in the verychoice of the name of the Order. Tothis we will have occasion to refer on alater page.In the Ritual of the Grade of Adeptus Minor, theThird Adept, reading from thehistorical account of theorigins of the Order, states that “The True Order oftheRose Cross ascendeth into the heights even untothe Throne of God himself.” Ifthe reader will well havestudied the preliminary knowledge material of theOuterOrder, he will remember it is said that the symbol ofVenus — a true symbolof growth and development —embraces all the Ten Sephiroth of the Qabalistic'Freeof Life. Since the Order is under the presidency of Venus,and in view ofthe above quotation, it would seem thatthe Order considered from a variety ofviewpoints isallied to the Tree of Life, and vice-versa. Thus the sys-tem ofgrades, and the division of the organisation intoThree Separate Orders - - theOrder of the Golden Dawnin the Outer, the Second Order of the R.R. et A.C.,andthe unnamed Third Order of Masters, whose Sephirothobtain above the Abyss —is based upon a natural anda very recondite series of correspondences. “Asaboveso below.” So that as the Tree of Life consists of a glyphwhich representsnot only a material physical universebut also a uranography of the invisible andspiritualworld, so does the Order consist, in all actuality, of morethan anexternal Order. Concealed within and behindthe grade system, is the invisibleOrder, of true adepts,unknown and, in most cases, unnamed Masters.< 291 >At the close of the Second Point of the 5-6 Ceremony,there are named, withoutfurther reference, the Namesand Ages of the “Three Highest Chiefs of theOrder”,These Chiefs are Hugo Alverda, whose age is given as576, Franciscus, whodied at the age of 495 years andElman Zatar, who died at the age of 463, Inadditionto these three there is Christian Rosencreutz the Found-er who died atthe age of 106 years.These enormous ages, unbelievably long in the caseof the three chiefs,imply—that is if we accept thehistory in its obvious and literal sense — that,as Adepts,they had discovered and employed the secret of theElixir of Life, inorder to prolong the period of their use-fulness on Earth. And though they havedied, that isdiscarded their purely physical instruments, it is notto besupposed they are cut off from our sphere of activ-ity. Such is not the occultteaching. Apart from theprobability that they may have since incarnatedvolun-tarily once more on this plane to continue their workon behalf of mankindin their own silent ways, theywould have become what are known in the East asNir-manakayas. Speaking in the Secret Doctrine of one groupof Adepts, Blavatskygives a definition of Nirmanakayaswhich is distinctly worth quoting: \",Marutsis, in occultparlance, one of the names given to those Egos of greatAdepts whohave passed away, and who are known alsoas Nirmanakayas; of those Egos for whom— since theyare beyond illusion — there is no Devachan (heaven)and who, havingeither voluntarily renounced it for thegood of mankind, or not yet reachedNirvana, remaininvisible on Earth.” Such must therefore be the natureof thedivine guardians of our Order. A few lines fol-< 292 >lowing the above quotation in the Secret Doctrine,Madame Blavatsky furtherremarks “Who they are ‘onearth* every student of Occult science knows.’*Whetherthey do or not, at any rate, it is clear that theOrder has a little to say onthis matter.There is an enormous amount of significant materialin the Secret Doctrine whichshould be very suggestiveto the student of the magical wisdom. For theSecretDoctrine assists in the comprehension of the Orderknowledge, and likewisethe Order knowledge makesbrilliantly clear what are otherwise highly obscurepas-sages in that colossal monument of Blavatsky’s erudi-tion. The only one ofthese points that I wish to considerat the moment is this question of Adepts inrelation tothe Order. In the first half of Volume Two of the SecretDoctrine,there is a passage or two which I must quote:“Alone a handful of primitive men —in whim the sparkof divine Wisdom burnt bright, and only strengthenedin itsintensity as it got dimmer and dimmer with everyage in those who turned it tobad purposes — remainedthe elect custodians of the Mysteries revealed toman-kind by the Divine Teachers. There were those amongthem, who remained intheir Kumaric (divine purity)condition from the beginning; and traditionwhispers,what the secret teachings affirm, namely, that these Electwere the germof a Hierarchy, which never died sincethat period\" The magical tradition has ittoo that theThree Chiefs and Christian Rosencreutz were of thosewho retainedtheir knowledge of their divine origins andspiritual nature, and they have beenconstantly withus. The student would be well-repaid to study whatH. P. B. has tosay in the first Volume of the Secret< 293 >Doctrine about the stem and root of Initiators, thatMysterious Being who, bom inthe so-called Third Raceof our evolutionary era, is called “The GreatSacrifice”and “the tree from which in subsequent ages, all thegreat historicallyknown Sages and Hierophants ... havebranched off.” More cannot be quoted here,but it isall highly significant, and the employment of Ordermethods corroboratesa great deal of what she wrote.But I do intend to quote from what she calls theCate-chism of the inner Schools, which deals still further withthe theme of theSecret Chiefs of our Order, or the undy-ing Adepts of all Ages. ‘The inner manof the first . . .only changes his body from time to time; he is everthe same,knowing neither rest nor Nirvana, spurningDevachan and remaining constantly onEarth for theSalvation of mankind. . . . Out of the seven virgin-men(Krnnara)four sacrificed themselves for the sins of theworld and the instruction of theignorant, to remain tillthe end of the present Manvantara. Though unseenthey areever present. When people say of one of them,‘He is dead’, behold, he is aliveand under another form.These are the Head, the Heart, the Soul, and the Seedofundying knowledge. Thou shalt never speak, O Lanoo,of these great ones before amultitude, mentioning themby their names. The wise alone will understand.”ThoughI have little intention to speak of them more clearly,little harm can bedone from what is already statedabove, for the names used are clearly thepseudonymsor magical mottos of those great beings.If however, we consider these Chiefs from a whollydifferent point of view, theresults are no less suggestive.Some students of the Order have thought thatthese< 294 >Three Chiefs may be considered as representative ofcertain principles in Natureor Sephiroth of the Treeof Life, particularly as it is said that the Order oftheRose Cross (the Ankh or the Venus symbol) ascendethunto the Throne of Godhimself. How may we discover,then, what principles are involved, and why? Twohintsare given in the Adeptus Minor Ritual as to what pro-cedure the student mayfollow in order to elucidatethese obscure mysteries. Almost deliberately theritualstates, in the first place, that Damcar, whither ourFather C. R. C.journeyed, may be transliterated intoHebrew, thus yielding two words which, iftrans-lated mean the “Blood of the Lamb”. The Lamb hasalways been a symbol ofthe Higher Ego. Secondly, thereis the analysis of the Key-word I. N. R. I.,wherebythe English letters are transliterated into Hebrew, attrib-uted tocertain Yetziratic correspondences, Egyptiandeities, signs and ideas. This must,then, be our tech-nique with regard to this problem. The Qabalah is themeanswhereby we may unlock the closed doors of theveiled intimations which abound inthe Order rituals.Through the application of this technique to theNames and Ages of the Chiefs,one may reasonably con-clude that, as the historical lection of the ThirdAdeptshowed, They represent the Triune Supernal Light,the Divine WhiteBrilliance invoked in the Vault ofthe Adepti — the letter Shin extended,bursting throughthe balanced elemental powers of Tetragrammaton toconfer theattainment of the Grade. If we transliteratethe Names into Hebrew, first, ofall, we have the fol-lowing: —< 295 >D3D'33K“iD — 541 — 10 = i — Kether $yjm = • 84 = 12 — 3 — Binah 0IKn^Kn — 776 — 20 — 2. — Chokmah £(It may be here remarked that the method of reducingnumbers to units as shownabove, while often called The-osophical addition, is actually the mode ofworkingcalled Aiq Beker, or the Qabalah of Nine Chambers. Thismethod of workingwas eliminated from the Orderpapers issued in one Temple by several high-gradeiniti-ates, whose natural stupidity was far in excess of theiradeptship. By thismethod of Aiq Beker, the 22 lettersand 5 finals of the Hebrew alphabet aregrouped togetherby threes according to units, tens, and hundreds inninedivisions.)Elman Zata is represented in the Rituals as beingan Arab; that is his originsare in the South and East,representing heat and fire, and so the AlchemicalSul-phur is a fit attribution. Sulphur is also an attributionof Chokmah, towhich also the element of Fire is allo-cated. Hugo is called the Phrisian. If werefer this placeto Frisia in Denmark, the North, then the AlchemicalSalt is aproper reference — Binah, and the element ofWater, the Great Salt Sea.Franciscus is the Gaul, whichcountry is a point between the North and theSouth,a temporate zone. Hence, he is the reconciler betweenthem, a mediator,surely the Alchemical Mercury. Thusfrom this point of view, the Gematria of theNames ofthe Three Chiefs, allies them with the Light of the Super-nal Sephiroth,that Light which ascendeth into theheights, even unto the Throne of God himself.Leaving, however, the Gematria of their individualNames for a moment, andproceeding to the Qabalah< 296 >of the numbers of their Ages, an equally interesting andsignificant fact isrevealed.Hugo’s age is given as 576, which reduces to 18 — 9.Franciscus age is given as495, which reduces to 18 — 9.Elman’s age is given as 463, which reduces to 13 —4.9 plus 9 plus 4, added together yield 22. 22 is the num-ber of the letters ofthe Hebrew Alphabet, the totalityof the Paths linking the Sephiroth on the Treeof Life.This number also represents, therefore, the Serpent ofWisdom which risesfrom Malkuth to Kether, theascending Spiral, the path which the aspirant totheGreat Order must tread. In short, the Chiefs representthe Path itself whichis to be followed, even as Theyrepresent the goal which is at the end thereof.Each initi-ate, it is the universal tradition of the Mystic path, mustnot onlytread the Way, but must become, even as didthese Three Chiefs, that Path itself.By referring the number 22 in a slightly different wayto the Qabalah of NineChambers, wre may obtain 220,which is the Gematria of Kor \"13, the Lamb,Abi-Agnus,the Strength of our Race — also the initials of ChristianRosenkreutz.Moreover, 2 plus 2, equals 4, which is thenumber of Daleth, which means a door,referred toVenus, the symbolical figure which embraces the wholeTree of Life,revealing that compassion or love is thatfiery force which binds togetherthrough an orderlygrowth and progression the whole Sephlrotic Schemeinto aUnity. And Daleth and Venus are the attributionsof that door into the Tomb ofthe Justified One, theVault of the Adepti, even as the reciprocal Path ofVenus,Daleth, on the Tree of Life, is the Secret Gate< 297 >which leads out from the Garden of Venus into thenewer life, the Glory of theBoundless Light. The secretof that Gate abides in the womb of the GreatMother,the intrinsic regenerating nature of the Empress of theTarot —Isis-Urania.Again, there are other considerations. At the end ofthe Order document on thesymbolism of the neophytegrade there is the statement that “Nephesch ha-Mesiach,the Animal Sou! of the Messiah” is “theShekinah or Presence between theKerubim.” Note thatShekinah represents, as I previously attempted to pointout,Aima Elohim, the Supernal Sephiroth as a syntheticUnity, the Divine WhiteBrilliance. Since this is spokenof as between the Kerubim, the Middle Pillar oftheTree, which is thus by definition the Path of theRedeemer or Messiah, thepath of the Sushumna tra-versed by the Kundalini serpent is referred to.NowMessiah in Hebrew is spelt rps?D and its Gematria is358. There is anotherword in Hebrew having preciselythe same enumeration, and that word is ^3,Nachash,meaning a Serpent. As we demonstrated above, theascending Spiral isrepresented by the Serpent of Wis-dom, which is the path of the 22 letters ofthe Alphabet— and to this Serpent are the ages of the Three Chiefsreferred. Thusbetween the Serpent of Wisdom whichrepresents the Way to the Crown, the Paths ofthe Treeof Life, and the Power of the Chiefs of the Order, thereis seen agematria connection. Interestingly enough,in all ancient systems, the Serpent isalso the Tempter,Lucifer — and once again, Lucifer is Venus, the Re-deemer.Thus the Three Chiefs of the Order of the R. R. etA. C. are the symbolicrepresentatives of the Way to< 298 >that Land which is beyond “honey, and spice and allperfection”, the Way to theLight itself. But they arealso the Light at the end of the Way; they havebecomethe divine attainment. How significant becomes thestatement “I am the Way,the Truth and the Life. Noman cometh unto the Father but by me.”There is one last correspondence before closing thispaper. The symbolic drama ofthe Adeptus Minor Rit-ual has as its goal the union of the aspirant withthedivine nature of Christian Rosencreutz. Theoretically, itis assumed that ourFather C. R. C. is the type and sym-bol of spiritual attainment, a man whoachieved unionwith his Higher and Divine Genius, and was brought tothe Light ofhis Kether. He is portrayed as a living man,who symbolically died, and likeOsiris of old, was glori-fied through trial, perfected through suffering, androseagain in a mystical resurrection. Now in the Ritual, heis referred to as“The Light of the Cross” and this latteris pictorially shown as “I, CXX”, whichis 120. TheLight of the Cross, CXX, is of course the LVX, the Lightof theSupernals. Now 120 reduces to 12, and it is inter-esting to note that 12 is alsothe numeration of the GreatAngel HUA who is invoked to overshadow theAspirantwhen he is bound to the Cross of Obligation. HUA is,in the Zohar, one ofthe mystical Titles of Kether, theCrown of the Tree. Analysis of the Nameexpands theidea considerably. The Name is composed of three let-ters, Heh, Vau,Aleph. Ileh, is 5 in number, the Penta-gram which is also the symbol of themicrocosm. Vauis 6, the Hexagram, the symbol of the Macrocosm, theGreater World.Aleph, is Unity. Thus the whole namesymbolises the union of the microcosm withMacrocosm,< 299 >and is a complete synthesis of the nature of the AdeptusMinor Grade itself, theaccomplishment of the GreatWork. So that the very expression of C. R. C. —‘I,theLight of the Cross” with the implication of its number,identifies himmystically with the Great Angel HU A.Botli become therefore the symbolicrepresentatives ofthe higher and divine Genius of the Candidate for initi-ation— giving us the rationale of dramatic ceremonial,that the depicting of the lifeof a revered personalitywho at one time in the past attained, may alsoinducewithin the heart and mind of the aspirant the over-whelming glory of thatsame attainment.It becomes peculiarly significant to trace out, in thisslight way, the unity andidentical nature of all the sym-bols employed, and show how by analogousmethodsand meditation the whole of the Order teaching maybe expanded into aprofound and highly significantsystem.(Note: Since there is no need for me to hide behinda cloak of anonymity, thisessay was written by me soonafter my advancement to the Adeptus Minor Grade.A.M.
