The subjects treated of are of so deeply interesting a nature that they have ever engaged, and ever will engage the at- tention of every thinking being. They are themes that never can bo buried out of sight. They demand our close attention. We must face them all: willingly or unwillingly. Much of the vast amount of information to be found in the following pages has been dilligently and laboriously culled from the great store- house ot facts accumulated by men who have devoted their time, energies and learning to prove, investigate, and explain tht various deep and mystical beliefs and practices so universally and expressively designated the \" Black Arts.\" All those dark mysteries that have captivated the imaginations, stimulated the investigations, and often baffled the keenest in- tellectual acumen of both by-gone and modern philosophers are here revealed in all their naked truthfulness. The fleshy integuments are stripped away, and the skeleton itself revealed. This book is written in the interest of no sect or party in re- ligion or science. All the following subjects are treated of fully, fairly, candidly and exhaustively: Sorcery, Astrology, Mind- Eeading, Midnight Apparitions, tho Churchyard Ghost, the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Threatening Omen, the Unlucky Day, the Cattle-Charm, thfli Spell on the Living, the Second-Sight ot the Highland Seer, the Clairvoyance of modern Times, the Table-Tippings. These, however, are but a very few of the subjects, described and dis- cussed in these pages, There is no dodging any question how- ever enshrined by superstition, and no attacking of any belief simply because it is the belief of some confiding souls. Many of the most awful and tsriible secietj ^re icalt with in a fearless but honest manner. The belief, for instance, in the visits of departed spirits to those still in the flesh is treated with that fairness and impartiality that should ever be atccrdcd to the faith held by a large body of honest people. We have been forced to tear down many a ricketty pile merely upheld by its antiquity and turned the calcium light of truth upon the scat- tering rats and bats of superstition. Cn tie other hand we are compelled to admit that some secrets are too deep and profound to be explained satisfactorily by the sharpest human intel- lect. But it must not be supposed that this book deals mainly with ideas and beliefs. Many practical, useful money-making Arts are fully described, and the proper manner in which to practice them clearly explained. We commend this book, in all honesty, to every fearless soul who is willing to accept our guidance, and who is resolved to investigate for himself every subject that mortal man feels touches his pocket, his principles and his happiness.

Waivino the consideration of the many controversies formerly kept up on this subject, founded on misinterpretation of various passages in the sacred writings, it is my purpose in the present section to consider witchcraft only as a striking article of popu- lar mythology; which, however, bids fair in another century to be entirely forgotten. \"Witchcraft is defined by Reginald Scot, in his Discovery, p. 284, to be, \" in estimation of the vulgar i)eople, a supernatural work between a corporal old woman and a spiritual devil;\" but, he adds, speaking his own sentiments on tho subject, •* it is, in truth, a cozening art, wherein tho name of God is abused, i)ro- phaned, and blasphemed, and his power attributed to a vile creature.\" Perkins defines witchcraft to be \" an art serving for the working of wonders by the assistance of the Devil, so far as God will permit;*' and Delrio, an art in which, by the power of the contract entered into with the Devil, some wonders are wrought which pass the common understanding of men.\" Witc'icraft, in modera estimation, is a kind of sorcery (espec- ially in M'omea), in which it is ridiculously supposed that an old woman, by entering into a contract with th« Dovil, is ta-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 SORCEnr AND WITCirCBAFT. abled in many instances to change the course of Nature, to raise winds, perform actions that require more than human strength, and to afflict those that offend her w ith the sharpest pains. King James's reason, in his Dsenionology, why there are or were twenty women given to witchcraft for one man, is curious. \" The reason is easy,\" as this sagacious monarch thinks, \" for, AS that sex is frailer than man is, so is it easier, to be entranped in these gross snares of the Divell, as was over well proved to be true by the serpent's deceiving of Eva at the beginning, which makes him the homelier with that sexe sensine.\" His majesty, in this work, quaintly calls the Devil \" God's ape end hangman.'\" Gibbon, in his Decline and Fall of the Reman E:npire, vili. ed. 1789-90, p. 157, speaking of the laws of the Lombards, a.d. 643, tells us : The ignorance of the Lombards, in the state of Paganism or Christianity, gave implicit credit to the malice and mischief of witchcraft ; but the judges of the seventeenth cen- tury might have been instructed and confounded by the wis- dom of Rotharis, who de/ides the absurd superstition, and pro- tects the wretched victims of popular or judicial cruelty.\" He adds in a note : \"See Leges Rotharis, No. 379, p. 47. Striga is used as the name of witch. It is of the purest classic origin (Horat. Epod. v. 20 ; Petron. c. 134) ; and from the words of Petronius (quaa Striges comederunt nervos tuos?) it may be in- ferred that the prejudice was of Italian rather than barbaric extraction.\" Gaule, in his Select Cases of Conscience, touching Witches and \"Witchcrafts, 1G46, observes, p. 4 , \"In every place and parish, every old woman with a wrinkled face, a furred brow, a hairy lip, a gobber tooth, a squint eye, a squeaking voice, a scolding tongue, having a rugged coate on her her back, a skud- cap on her head, a spindle in her hand, a dog or cat by her side, is not only suspected but pronounced lor a witch. * * Every new dicease, notable accident, miracle of Nature, rarity of art, nay, and strange work or just judgment cf God, is by them accounted for no other but an act or effect of witchcraft** He says, p. 10 : Some say the devill was the first witch when he plaied the imposter with our first parents, possessing tho"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"SORCERY AND WITCHCRAFT. cerpent (as his impe) to their delusion (Gen. iii.) : and it ii •whispered that our grandame Eve was a lictle guilty of such kind of society.\" Henry in his history of Great Britain, iv. 543, 4to., speaking of our manners between a.d. 1399 and 1485, says : \" There was not a man then in England who entertained the least doubt of ;jic reality of sorcery, necromancy, and other diabolical arts.\" According to the popular belief on this subject, there are three sorts of witches : the first kind can hurt but not help, and are with singular propriety called the black witches. The second kind, very properly called white ones, have gifts directly opposite to those of the fomier ; they can help but not hurt, Gauie, as cited before, says; \"Accoiding to the vulgar con- ceit, distinction is usually made between the white and tho hlack ucitch ; the good and the bad witch. The odd witch they are wont to call him or her that workes malefice or mischiefe to the bodies of men or beasts ; the good witch they count him or her that helps to reveale, prevcnr, or remove the same.\" Cotla, in the Tryall of Witchcraft, p. CO, says : \"Thiskinde is not obscure, at this day swarming in this kingdom, whereof no man can be ignorant who lusteth to observe the uncon- trouled liberty and licence of open and ordinary resort in all places unto wise men and wise women, so vulgarly termed for their reputed knowledge concerning such deceased persons as are supposed to be bewitched,\" The same author, in his Short Discoverie of Unobserved Dangers, 1612, p. 71, says : \"The mention of witchcraft doth now occasion the remembrance in the next place of a sort (company) of practitioners whom our custome and country doth call wise men and wise women, re- puted a kind of good and honest harmless witches or wizards, who by good words, by hallowed herbcs and salves, and other superstitious ceremonies, promise to allay and calme divels, practices of other witches, and the forces of many diseases,\" Perkins by Pickering, 8vo, Cambr.

Yet I do not think that Hodges made any known contract with the devil, but thought it an effect of art.' The third species, as a mixture of white and black, are styled the gray witches ; for they can both help and hurt. Thus the tnd and effect of witchcraft seems to be sometimes good and sometimes the direct contrary. In the first case the sick are healed, thieves are bewrayed, and true men come to their goods. In the second, men, women, children, or animals as also grass, trees or corn, &c., are hurt. The Laplanders, says Schefifer, have a cord tied with knots for the raising of the wind : they, as Ziegler relates it, tie three ma- gical knots in tbis cord : when tbey untie the first there blows a favorable gale of wind ; when the second, a brisker ; when the third, the sea and wind grow mighty, stormy, and tempestuous. This, he adds, that wo have reported concerning the Laplan- ders, does not in fact belong to them, but to the Finlanders of Norwav, because no other writers mention it, and because the Laplanders live in and iuland country. However, the method of selling winds is tbis : \" They deliver a small rope with three knots upon it, with this caution, that when they loose the first they shall have a good wind; if the second, a stronger; if the third, such a storm will arise that they can neither see how to"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"soncrnr Ayp witciicbaft. 11 direct the sliip nnd ftvoid rocks, or so much ns stand upon lb© decks, or handle the tackling.\" The same is admitted by King James in his Dsemonology, p. 117. The following passage is from Scot's Discovery, p. 33: '* No one endued with common sense but w ill deny that the elements are obedient to witches and at their commandment, or that they may, at their pleasure, send rafn, hail, tempests, thunder, light- ning, when she, being but an old doting w oman, casteth a flint stone over her left shoulder towards the west, or hurleth a little sea-sand up into the dement, or wetteih a brccm^piigin water and sprinkleth the s ame in the air; or diggeth a pit in the earth, and, putting water therein, stirreth it about with her finger; or boileth hog's bristles; or layeth sticks across upon a bank \"wher© never a drop of water is; or bury eth sage till it be rotten: all which things are confessed by witches, and affirmed by writers to be the means that witches use to move extraordinary tempests and rain.\" Ignorance,\" says Osboume; in his Advice to his Son, 8vo. Oxf. 1CC6, reports of witches that they are unable to hurt till they have received nn nlmes; which, though ridiculous in it- selfe, yet in this sense is verified, that charity seldom goes to the gate but it meets with ingratitude,\" p. 94. Spotiswood, as cited 1 y Andrews, in Lis Continuation of Henry's History of Great Britain, p. t.CZ, snys, In the North \" (of Britain) there were '* matron-like witches and ignorant witches.\" It was to one of the superior sort that Satan, being pressed to kill James the Sixth, thus excused himself in French, \" II est homme de Dieu.\" Camden, in his Ancient and Modem Manners of the Irish says: \" If a cow becomes dry, a w itch is applied to, who, in- spiring her with a londness for some other calf, makes her yield her milk.\" (Gough's Camden, iii. C59.) He tells us, ibid. : \" The women who are turned off (by their husbands) have re- course to witches, who are supposed to inflict barrenness, impo- tence, or the most dangerous diseases, on the former husband or his new wife.\" Also, \"They account every woman who fetches fire on May-day a witch, nor will they give it to any but sick persons, and that with An imprecation, believing she will"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 SORCERY Ay D WITCHCRAFT steal all the butter next summer.

They imagine the butter 60 stolen may be recovered if they take some of the thatch hang- ing over the door and burn it. The mode of becoming a witch, according to Grose, is as fol- lows: A decrepit 8uperanuated old woman is tempted by a man in black to sign a contract to become his both soul and body. On the conclusion of the agreement he gives her a piece of money, and causes her to write her name and make her mark on a slip of parchment with her own blood. Sometimes, also, on this occasion, the witch uses the ceremony of putting one hand to the sole of her foot, and the other to the crown of her head. On departing, he delivers to her an imp or familiar. The fam- iliar, in the shape of a cat or a kitten, a mole, millerfly, or some other insect or animal, at stated times of the day, BV.cks he blood through teats on different jiarts of her body.\" There is a great variety of the names of these imps or familiars. A witch,\" (as I read in the curious tract entitled, Eound about our Coal Fire,) \" according to my nurse's account, must be a haggard old woman, living in a little rotten cottage, under a hill, by a wood-side, and must be frequently si)inning at the door; she must have a black cat, two or three broomsticks, an imp or two, and two or three diabolical teats to suckle her imps. She must be of so dry a nature, that if j'ou lling her into a river she will not sink; so hard then is her fate, that, if she is to un- dergo the trial, if she does not drown, she must be burnt, as many have been within the memory of man.\" In the Relation of the Swedish Witches, at the end of Glan- vil's Sadducismus Triumphatus, we are told that \" the devil gives them a beast about the bigness r.nd shape cf a yoi:ng cat which they call a carrier. \"What this carrier brings they must receive for the devil. These carriers fill themselves so full sometimes, that they are forced to spew by the way, which spewing is found in several gardens where colworts grow, and not far from the houces of those witches.

The Sabbath of witches is a meeting to which the sisterhood, after having been annointed with certain magical ointments, pro- vided by their infernal leader, are supposed to be earned through the air on brooms, conl-staves, spits, &c, lleginald Scot, in bis Discovery ot Witchcraft, b. iii. c. i. p.. 40i speaking of the vulgar opinion of witches flying, observes that \"the devil teacliefh them to make oinlment of the bowels and members of children, whereby they ride in the air and accom- plish all their desires. After burial they steal them out of their graves and seeth them in a cauldron, till the flesh be made pot- able, of which they make an ointment by which they ride in tho air.\" Wierus exposes the folly of this opinion in his book De Prgestigiis Doemonum, proving it to be a diabolical illusion, and to be acted upon only in a dream. And it is exposed as such by Oldham (Works, Gth edit. p. 254) : \"Am men in sleep, though motionless they lie, Fletlj^'d by a dream, believe they mount and flye; So ^iiches some enchanted wand bestride.

There is a Scottish proverb, \"Ye breed of the witches, ye can do nao good to yoursel.\" They afterwards open graves for the purpose of taking out joints of the lingers and toes of dead bodies, with some of the winding-sheet, in order to prepare a powder for their magical purposes. Here also the devil distributes apples, dishes, spoons» or other triHes, to those witches who desire to torment any par. ticular person, to whom they must present them. Here also, for similar purposes, the devil baptises waxen images. King James, in his Dcemonology, book ii. chap. 5, tells us that \" the devil teaeheth how to make pictures of wax or clay, that by roasting thereof, the persons t'aat they bear the name ol may bo continually melted or dried away by continual sickness.\" It appears from Strype's Annnls of the lleformation, i. 8, un- der anno 1558, that Bishop Jewel, preaching before the queen, said; *' It may i)lease your grace to understand th:.t witches and sorcerers within these lew last year>4 arc marvellously increjised within your Grace's realm.

C6, says that witches ** take likewise the roots of mandrake, according to some, or as I rather suppose the roots of hriony, which simple folks take for the trxi9> mandrake, and make thereof an ugly image, by which they represent the person on whom they intend to exercise their witchcraft.\" H3 tells us, ibi.l, p. 2G ; \"Some plants have roots with a number of threads, like beards, as mandrakes, whereof witches and impostors make an ugly image, giving it the form of the face at the the top of the root, and leave those strings to make a broad beard down to the feet.\" Sometimes witches content themselves with a revenge less mortal, causing the objects of their hatred to swallow pins, crooked nails, dirt, cinders, and trash of all sorts ; or by dry- ing up their cows and killing their oxen ; or by preventing butter from coming in the churn, or beer from working. Sometimes, to vex squires, justices, and country parsons, fond of hunting, they change themselves into hares, and elude the speed of the fleetest dogs. It was a supposed remedy against witchcraft to put some of the bewitched person's water, with a quantity of pins, needels, and nails, into a bottle, cork them up, and set them before the fire, in order to confine the spirit ; but this sometimes did not prove sufficient, as it would often force the cork out with a loud noise, like that of a pistol, and cast the contents of the bottle to a considerable height.

In vexing the parties troubled, witches are visible to them only ; sometimes such parties act on the defensive against them, striking at them with a knife, &c.

It was a part of the system of witchcraft that drawing blood from a witch rendered her enchantments ineffectual, as appears from the following authorities : In Glanvill's Account of the Daemon of Tedworth, speaking of a boy that was bewitched, he says ; \" The boy drew towards Jane Brooks, the woman who had bewitched him, who was behind her two sisters, and put his hand upon her, which his father perceiving, immediately scratched her face and drew blood from her.

In t Butler, in his Hudibras, part I. c. iii. 1. 343, alludes to this trial : \" He that gets her by heart must say her The back way, like a witch's prayer.\" t King James, in the work already quoted, adding his remark, on this mode of trying witches, says : \" They cannot even shed tears, though wonipn in general are like the crocodile, ready to weep upon every light occasion.\""},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 SOnCEUT AyD WITCIICnAFT this stale she was cast into a pond or ri\\'er, in wliicli, if guilty, it was Ibouglit imi^ossible for Lierto sink.

There vrero other modes of trial, by the stool, and by shaving off every hair of the witch's body. They were also detected by putting hair, parings of the nails, and urino of any jicrson bewitched into a btono bottle, and hanging it up in the chimney. Cotta, in his Short Discoverie of the Unobserved Dangers, p. 54, tells us : \"Neither can I beleevc (Ispeako it with reverenco unto graver judgements) that the forced coming of men or Komen lo the burning of hewUched caitdl, or to the burning of the dung or vr '.ne cf such as are beicitched, or floating of botlies above the water, or the lii:e, are any trial of a witch.\" Gaule, in his Select Cases of Conscience touching Witches and \"Witchcraft, also (p. 75) men- tions \" some marks or tokens of t.yall altogether unwarrantable, as proceeding from ignorance, humor, superstition.

One way is by watching the suspected party when they go into their house ; and then presently to take some of her thatch from over tho door, or a tile, if the house be tyled : if it bo thatch, you must wet and sprinkle it over with the x^atient's water, and likewise with white salt ; then let it burn cr smoke through a trivet or tho framo of a skillet ; you must bury the ashes that way which the susi^ected witch liveth. 'Tis best done either at the change, full, or quarters of the moon ; or otherwise, when the witch's bigniUcator is in square or opposition to the moon. But if the witch's house be tiled, then take a tile from over the door, heat him red hot, put salt into the patient's water, and dash it upon the red-hot tile, until it be consumed, and let it smoak through a trivet or frame of a skillet as aforesaid. 2. Another way is to get two new horseshoes, heat one of them red hot and quench him in the patient's urine ; then immediately nail him on the inside of the threshold of the door with three nails, the heel being upv.-ards; then, having the patients urino, set it over the fire, and set a trivet over it ; put into it three horse- nails and a little white salt. Then heat the other horseshoe red hot, and quench hioi several times in the urine, and so let it boil and waste until all bo consumed : do this three times, and Ut it ba near the change, fall, or quarters of th« moon ; or lot"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"soRcrr.T ASD wrrcncnAFT. 23 the moon be in square or opposition unto the witch's significzv- tor. 3. Another way is to stop the urine of the r>atient close up in a bottle, and put iuto it three nails, pine, or needles, with a iittle white salt, keeping' the urine always warm. If you let it remain long in the bottle, it will endanger the witch's life ; for I have found by experience that they will be grievously tor- mented, making their water with great difficulty, if any at all, and the moor if the moon be in Scorpio, in square or opposition to his significator, when its done. 4. Another way is either at the new, full, or quarters of the moon, but more especially when the moon is in square or opposition to the planet which doth personate the witch, to let the patient blood, and while the blood is warm put a little white salt into it, then let it burn and smoak through a trivet. I conceive this way doth more afflict the witch than any of the other three before mentioned.\" He adds, that sometimes the witches will rather endure the misery of the above torments than appear, \" by reason country people ofttimes will fall upon them, and scratch and abuse them shrewdly\" I fmd the following in Articles to be enquired of within the Archdeaconry of Yorke, by the Church Wardens and sworno Men, A. D. 1G3— (any year till 1610), 4to. Lond. 6.

These were called witch- finders. The old, the ignorant, and the indigent (says Granger), such as could neither plead their own cause nor hire an advocate, were the miserable victims of this wretch's credulitj', spleen, and avarice. He pretended to be a great critic in special marks, which were only moles, scorbutic spots, or warts, which fre- quently grow large and pendulous in old age, but wero absurd- ly supposed to be teats to suckle imps.

Tlie experiment of swiminirg was aMengtli tried upon Hop- kins himself, in his own way, and he was, upon the event, con- demned, and, as it seems, executed, as a wizard. Hopkins had hanged, in one year, no less than sixty reputed witches in his own county of Essex. In Gardiner's England's Grievance in Relation to tho Coal Trade, p. 107, we have an account that, in 1C40 and 1050, tho magistrates of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, sent into Scotland to agreo with a Scotchman, who pretended knowledge to £nd out witches by pricking them with pins. They agreed to give him twenty shillings a-pisce for all he could condemn, and bear his travel- ing expen -os. On Lis arrival the bellman was sent through the town to :nvite .all persons that would bring in an}' complaint against any vroman for a M itch, that she might be sent for and tried by tho persons appointed. Thirty women wei'c, on this, brought into the town-hall and stripped, and then openly had pin? thrust into their bodies, about twenty-seven of whom ho found guilty. His modn was, in the sight cf all the people, to lay the body of the per on suspected naked to tho waist, and then he r.;n a i in into her thigh, and then suddenly let her coats fall, demanding whether she had nothing cf Lis in her body bat did not bleed : the woman, through fright and shame, being auiazad, replied little ; then he put his hand up her coats and pulled out the pin, settling her aside as a guilty person and a child of the devil. By this sort of evidence, one wizard and fourteen witches wero tried and convicted at the assizes, and afterwards executed. Their names are recorded in tho parish register of St. Andrew's. See Brand's history of Newcastle-up- on-Tyne. Nash, in his History of Worcestershire, iL 38, tells us that, \" 14th May, 1G60, four persons accused of witchcraft were brought from Kidderminster to Worcester Gaol, one \"Widow Ilobinson, and her two daughters, and a man.

Many great charges against them, and little proved, they were put to the ducking in the river : they would not sink, but swam aloft. The man had live teats, the woman three, and the eldest daughter one. \"When they went to search the women none wore visible ; one advised to lay them on their backs and keep open their mouths, and then they would ap- pear ; and so they presently appeared in sight. It appears from a Eehition printed by Matthews, in Long Acre, London, that, in the year 171G, Mrs. Hicks, and her daughter, aged nine years, were hanged in Huntingdon for witchcraft, for selling their souls to the devil, tormenting and destroying their neighbors, by making them vomit pins, raising a storui, so that a ship was almost lost, by pulling off her stock- ings, and making a lather of soap. By the severe laws once in force against witches, to the dis- grace of humanity, great numbers of innocent persons, dis- tressed with poverty and age, were brought to violent and untimely ends. By the 33 Henry VIIL c. viii. the law adjudged all Yv'itchcraft and Sorcery to be felony without benefit of clergj'. By statue 1 Jac. L c. xii. it was (>rdered that all persons invoking any evil spirit, or consulting, covenanting with, enter- taining, employing, feeding, or rewarding any evil spirit ; or taking up dead bodies from their graves to be used in any witchcraft, sorcery, charm, or enchantment, or killing or other- wise hurling any person by such infernal arts, should be gniHy of felony without benefit of clerg}', and sulTer death. And if any person should attempt by sorcery to discover hidden treas- ure, or to restore stolen goods, or to provoke unlawful love, or to hurt any man or beast, though the same were not affected, ho or she should suffer imprisonment and pillory for the first offence, and death for the second. On March 11, 1G13, Margaret and Philip Flower, daughters of Joane Flower, were executed at Lincoln for the supposed crimo of bewitching Henry Lord Kosse, eldest son of Francis Manners,"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"SORCERY A^B WITCHORAFT.

They were tried at the Lent As- sizes before Sir Henry Hobart, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and Sir Edward Bromley, one of the Barons of the Exchequer, and cast by the evidence of their own confessions. To effect the death of Lord Henry \"there was a glove of the said Lord Henry buried in the ground, and as that glove did rot and waste, so did the liver of the said lord rot and waste.\" The spirit employed on the occasion, called Butterkin, appears not to have had the same power over the lives of Lord Francis and Lady Katherine.

The prejudices of popular credulity are not easily effaced. Men of learning, either from conviction or some other equally powerful motive, adopted the system of Dsemon- ology advanced b}' James I. ; and it was only at a recent period that the legislature repealed the Act made in the first year of the reign of that monarch, entitled an Act against Conjuration, Witchcraft, and dealing with Evil and Wicked Spirits.\" Lord Verulam's reliections on witches, in the tenth century of his Natural History, form a fine contrast to the narrow and bigoted ideas of the royal author of the Daemonology. \"Men may not too rashly believe the confession of witches, nor yet the evidence against them ; for the witches themselves are imaginative, and believe oftentimes they do that in which they do not ; and people are credulous in that point, and ready to impute accidents and natural operations to witch- craft. It is worthy the observing that, both in ancient and late times (as in the Thessalian witches, and the meetings of witches that have been recorded by so many late confessions), the great wonders which they tell, of carrying in the air, transforming themselves into other bodies, &c. are still reported to bo wrought, not by incantations or ceremonies, but by ointments and anointing themselves all over. This may justly move a va?.n to think that these fables are the effects of imr.g- inatiou ; for it is certain that ointments do all (if they be laid on anything thick), by stopping of the pores, shut in the vapors, and send them to the head extremely.

If I mis. take not, this is a connexion which has cost our domestic animal all that persecution with which it is, by idle boyc at least, 'sncessantly pursued. In ancient times the case was very different. These animals were anciently revered as emblems of the moon, and among the Egyptians were on that account so highly honored to receive sacrifices and devotions, and had stately temples erected to their honor. It is said that in what- ever house a cat died, all the family shaved their eyebrows. No favorite lap-dog among the moderns had received such posthu- mous honors. Diodorus Siculus relates that a Eoman happen- ing accidentally to kill a cat, the mob immediately gathered about the house where he was, and neither the entreaties of some principle men sent by the king, not the fear of the Romans, with whom the Egyptians were then negotiating • peace, could save the man's life.

Such are the grand secrets of Albertus JIagnus, FASCINATION OF WITCHES. I have no doiibt but that this expression originated in the poi^ular superstition concerning an evil, that is an enchanting heiDitcldng eye. In confirmation of this I must cite the follow- ing passage from Scot's Discovery, p. 291 : \" Many writers agree with Yirgil and Theocritus in the effect of bewitching eyes, affirming that in Scythia there are women called Bithise, having two balls, or rather hlacks, in the apples of their eyes. These (forsooth) with their angry looks do bewitch and hurt, not only young lambs, but young children.\" He says, p. 35 : \"The Irishmen affirm that not only their children, but their cattle, are (as they call it) eye-hiiien, when they fall suddenly sick.\" In Vox Dei, or the great Duty of Self-Eeflection upon a Man's own Wayes, by N.

[The following very curious particulars are taken from a recent number of the Athenaeum : — Turrdngihe Coal ; a Couni- ercharm io the Evil Eye. It is necessary that persons with the power of an evil eye go through certain forms before they can effect their object ; and it is supposed that during these forms the evil they wish is seen by them, by some means, before it takes efiect upon their victim. One of the simplest of these forms is looking steadfastly in the fire, so that a person seen sitting musing with his eyes fixed upon the fire is looked upon with great suspicion. But if he smokes, and in lighting the pipe puts the head into the fire, and takes a draw while it is there, it is an undeniable sign that there is evil brewing. Now, if any pe;-son observe this, and it being a common custom in the country to have a large piece of coal on the fire, the tongs be taken privately, and this coal be turned right over, with the exorcism utterd, either privately or aloud, \"Lord be wi' us,\" it throws the imagination of the evil-disposed person into con- fusion, dispels the vision, and thwarts for the time all evil inten- tions. Or if an individual who is suspected of having wished evil, or cast an ''ill e'e,\" upon anything, enter the house upon which the evil is, and the coal he turned upon him, as it is termed, that person feels as if the coal was placed upon his heart, and has often been seen to put his hand to his breast, exclaiming, \"Oh !\" Nay, more ; he is unable to move so long as the coal is held down with the tongs,— and has no more power over that house. In Heron's Journey through Part of Scotland, ii. 228, we read : \"Cattle are subject to be injured by what is called an evil eye, for some persons are supposed to have naturally a blast- ing power in their eyes, with which they injure whatever offends or is hopelessly desired by them. Witches and warlocks are also much disposed to wreak their malignity on cattle.\" \"Charms,\" the writer adds, \" are the cheif remedies applied for"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"86 FASCINATION OF WITCRES. their diseases. I have been, mj-self, acqiTainted with an anti- bnrgher clergyman in these parts, who actually procured from A person who pretended skill in these charms, two small pieces of wood, curiously wrought, to be kept in his lather's cow- house, as a security for the health of his cows. It is common to bind into a cow's tail a small piece of mountain-ash wood, as a charm against witchcraft. Few old women are now suspect- ed of witchcraft ; but many tales are told of the conventions of witches in the kirks in former times. [\"Your interesting papers,\" says a correspondent of the Athenaeum, \"upon 'Folk Lore,' have brought to my recollec- tion a number of practices common in the west of Scotland. The lirst is a test for, as a charm to prevent, an 'ill e'e.' Any- individual ailing not sufficiently for the case to be consideped serious, but lingering, is deemed to be the object of ' an ill e'o,' of some one 'that's no canny.' The follov\\-ing operation is (hen performed ;— An old sixpence is borrowed from some neighbor, without telling the ol>ject to which it is to be applied ; as much salt as can be lifted upon the sixpence is put into a table- spoonful of water, and melted ; the sixpence is then put into the solution, and the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands of the patient are moistened three times with the salt water ; it is then tasted three times, and the patient afterwards 'scored aboon the breath,' that is, by the operator dipping tho forefinger into the salt water, and drawing it along the brow. When this is done the contents of the spoon are thrown behind, and right over the fire, the thrower saying at the same time, * Lord preserve us frae a' scathe ! ' If recovery follow this, thero is no doubt of the individual having been under the influence of an evil eye.\"] Volney, in his travels in Egypt and Syria, i. 246, says \"The ignorant mothers of many of the modern Egyptians, whose hollow eyes, pale faces, swollen bellies, and meagre ex- tremities make them seem as if they had not long to live, be- lieve this to be the effect of the evil eye of some envious person, who has bewitched them ; and this ancient prejudice is still general in Turkey.\" \" Nothing,\" says Mr. Dallaway, in his Account of Cojx-"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"TOAD STONE.

Gaule, as before cited, p. 142, speaking of the preservatives against witchcraft, mentions, as in use among the Papists, \"the tolling of a baptized bell, signing with the signe of the crosse, sprinkling with holy water, blessing of oyle, wax, candles, salt, bread, cheese, garments, weapons, &c,, carrying about sainta reliques, with a thousand superstitious foperiers ;\" and then enumerates those which are used by men of all religions : \" 1. In seeking to a witch to be holpen against a witch. 2, In using a certain or supposed charme, against an uncertaineor suspected witchcraft. 3. In searching anxiously for the witches signe or token left behinde her in the house under the threshold, in the bed-straw ; and to be sure to light upon it, burning every odd ragge, or bone, or feather, that is to be found. 4, In swear- ing, rayling, threatning, cursing, and banning the witch ; as if this were a right way to bewitch the witch from bewitching. 5.

Meantime she tolerates defiance thorough the wrathfull spittle of matrons, in stead of fuell, or maintenance to her damnable intentions.\" He goes on — \"Children cannot smile upon her without the hazard of a perpetual wry mouth : a very nobleman's request may be denied more safely than her petetions for butter, milke, and small becre ; and a great ladies or queens name may be less doubtfully derided.

Tetragramaton.\""},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40 SOROEllER A YD MAGICIAN, THE SORCERER AND MAGICIAN. A soRCEBER and magician, says Grose, differs from a witch in this : a witch derives all her power from a compact with the devil : a sorcerer commands him, and the infernal spirits, by his skill in powerful charms and invocations; and also soothes and entices them by fumigations. For the devils are observed to havs delicate nostrils, abominating and flying some kind of stinks : witness the flight of the evil spirit into the remote parts of Egypt, driven by the smell of a fish's liver burned by Tobit. They are also found to be peculiarly fond of certain perfumes : insomuch that Lilly informs us that, one Evens having raised n spirit at the request of Lord Bothwell and Sir Kenelm Digby, and forgotten a suffumigation, the ?-pirit, vexed at the disapoint- ment, snatched him out of his circle, and carried him from his house in the Minories into a field near Batersea Causeway. King James, in his Dremonologia, says : \"The art of sorcery -consists in divers forms of circles and conjurations rightly joined together, few or more in number according to the number of persons conjurers (always passing the singular number), According to the qualitie of the circle and form of the appari- tion. Two principle things cannot well in that errand be wanted : holy water (whereby the devil mocks the Papists), and some present of a living thing unto him. There are likewise certain dales and houres that they observe in this purpose. These things being already and prepared, circles are made, triangular, quadrangular, round, double, or single, according to the form of the apparition they crave. But to speake of the di- verse forms of the circles, of the innumerable characters and crosses that are within and without, and out-through the same ; of the diverse forms of apparitions that the craftie spirit illudes them with, and of all such particulars in that action, I remit it over to many that have busied their heads in describing of the same, as being but curious and altogether unprofitable. And this farre only I touch, that, when the conjured spirit appears, which will not be while after many circumstances, long prayers and much muttering and raurmurings of the conjurers, like a pa- pist priest© despatching a hunting masse--how soone, I say, h9"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"SOnCERER AND MAGICIAN. appeares, if they have missed one jote oi all their rites ; or if any of their feete once slyd over the circle, through terror of this fearful apparition, he paies himself at that time, in his owne hand, of that duo debt which they ought him and other- VI ise would have delaied longer to have paied him ; I meane, he carries them with him, body and soul. \" If this be not now a just cause to make them weary of these formes of conjuration, I leave it to you to judge upon ; considering the longsomeness of the labor, the precise keeping, of dai3s and houres (as I have said), the terribleness of th« apparition, and the present peril that they stand in, missing the leest circumstance of freite that they ought to observe : and, on the other part, the devill is glad to moove them to a plain© and squfire dealing with them, as I said before.\" \"This,\" Grose observes, \"is a pretty accurate description of thic mode of conjuration, styled the circular method ; but, with all due respect to his Majesty's learning, square and tri- angular circles are figures not to be found in Euclid or nny of] the common writers on geometry. But perhaps King James learnt his mathematics from the same system as Doctor Sach- everell, who, in one of his speeches or sermons, made use of the following simile : 'They concur like parallel lines, meeting in one common centre.' \" The difference between a conjuror, a witch, and an enchanter, according to Minshew, in his dictionarj', is as follows: \"The conjuror seemeth by jorairs and invocations of God's powerful names, to compel the divell to say or doe what he commandeth him. The witch dealeth rather by a friendly and voluntarie conference or agreement between him and her and the divell or familar, to have his or her turn served, in lieu or stead of blood or other gift offered unto liim, especially of his or her soule. And both these differ from inchanters or sorcerers, because the former two have personal conference with the divell, and th« other meddles but with medicines and ceremonial formeg of words called charmes, without apparition.\" Reginald Scot, in his Discourse on Devi lis and spirits, p. 72, tells as that, with regard to conjurors, \"The circles by which"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"42 SORCERER AND MAGICIAN. they defend themselves are commonly nine foot in breath, but the eastern magicians must give seven.\" Melton, in his astrologaster, p. 16, speaking of conjurors says : \"They always observe the time of the moon before they set their figure, and when they have set their figure and spread their circle, first exorcise the wine and water which they sprinkle on their circle, then mumble in an unknown language. Doe they not crosse and exorcise their surplus, their silver wand, gowne, cap, and every instrument they use about their blacke and damn- able art ? Nay, they crosse the place whereon they stand, be- cause they thinke the devill hath no power to come to it when they have blest it.\" The followinfi passage occurs in A Strange Horse-Bace, by Thomas Dekker, 1613, signat. D. 3 : \"He darting an eye upon them, able to confound a thousand conjurers in their own circles (though with a wet finger they could fetch up a little divell).\" The old vulgar ceremonies used in raising the divell, such as making a circle with chalk, setting an old hat in the centre of it, repeating the Lord's Prayer backward, &c. &c., are now altogether absolete, and seem to be forgotten even amongst our boys. Mason in his Anatomic of Sorcerie, 1612, p. 86, ridicules \" In chanters and charmers — thej', which by using of certain© conceited words, characters, circles, amulets, and such-like vain and wicked trumpery (by God's permission) doe worke great marvailes : as namely in causing of sicknesse, as also in curing diseases in men's bodies. And likewise binding some, that they cannot use their naturall powers and faculties, as we see in night-spells ; insomuch as some of them doe take in hand to bind the divell himselfe by their inchantments.\" Th6 following spell is from Herrick's Hesperides, p, 304 : \" Holy water come and bring : Cast in salt for seasoning ; Set the brush for sprinkling : Sacred spittle bring ye hither ; Meale and it now mix together, And a little oyle to either :"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"SOnCERER A^'D MAGICIAN. 43 Give the tapors here their liE;ht, King the saints-bell to affright Far from hence the evil sprite.\" Another mode of consulting spirits was hy the berryl, by means of a speculator or seer, who, to have a complete sight, ought to be a pure virgin, a youth who had not known woman, or at least a person of irreproachable life and purity of man- ners. The method of such consultation is this : the conjuror, having repeated the necessary charms and adjurations, with the Litany, or invocation peculiar to the spirits or angels he wishes to call (for every one has his particular form), the seer looks into a crystal or berryl, wherein he will see the answer, represented either by types or figures : and sometimes, though very rarely, will hear the angels or spirits speak articulately. Their pronunciation is, as Lilly says, like the Irish, much in the throat. In Lodge's Devil's Incarnat of this Age, 1596, in the epistle to the reader, are the following quaint allusions to sorcerers and magicians: \"Buy therefore this Ch'isiall, and you shall see them in their common appearance : and read these exorcisms advisedly, and you may be sure to conjure them without crossings : but if any man long for a familiar for false dice, a spirit to tell fortunes, a charme to heale disease, this only book can best fit him.\" Valiancy, in his Collectanea de Eebus Hiber- nicis, No. xiii. 17, says : In the Highlands of Scotland a large chrystal, of a figure somewhat oval, was kept by the priests to work charms by ; wjiter poured upon it at this day is given to cattle against diseases ; these stones are now preserved by the oldest and most superstitious in the country (Shawe). They were once common in Ireland, I am informed the Earl of Tyrone is in jiossession of a very fine one.\" In Andrew's Con- tinuation of Henry's History of Great Britain, p. C88, we read : \"The conjurations of Dr Dee having induced his familiar spirit to visit a kind of talisman, Kelly (a brother adventurer) was ap- pointed to watch and describe his gestures.\" The dark shining stone used by these impostors was in the Strawberry Hill collec- tion.

A delineation of another is engraved in the frontispiece to Awbrey's Miscellanies. This mode of in- quiry was practised by Dr. Dee, the celebrated mathematician. His speculator was named Kelly. From him, and others practis- ing this art, we have a long muster-roll of the infernal host, their different natures, tempers, and appearances. Dr. Reginald Scot has given us a list of some of the chiefs of these devils or spirits. These sorcerers, or magicians, do not always employ their art to do mischief ; but, on the contrary, frequently exert it to cure diseases inflicted by witches, to discover theives, recover stolen goods, to fortell future events and the state of absent friends. On this account they are frequently called White Witches. Ady, in his candle in the dark, p. 29. speaking of common juglers, that go up and down to play their tricks in fayrs and markets, says: \"I will speak of one man more excelling in that craft than others, that went about in King James his time, and long since, who called himself the King's Majesties most ex- cellent Hocus Pocus, and so was he called, becaus that at the playing of every trick he used to say: ' Hocus pocus, tontus, tal- ontus, vade celeriter jubeo,' a dark composure of words to blinde the ej'es of beholders.\" In the Character of a Quack-Astrologer, 1673, our wise man, \"a gipsy of the uper form,\"' is called \"a three-penny prophet that undertakes the telling of other folks' foriimes, meerly to supply the pinching necessities of his o?cn.\" Ibid, signat B. 3, our cunning man is said to \"begin with theft; and to help people to what they have lost, picks their pocket afresh: not a ring or a spoon is nim'd away, but pays him twelve-pence toll, and the ale-drapers' often-straying tankard yeilds him a con- stant revenue: for that purpose he maintains as strict a corres- pondence with gilts and lifters as a montebank with applauding midwives and recommending nurses: and if at any time, to keep up his credit with the rabble, he discovers anything, 'tis done by the same occult hermetic learning, her«tofor« profast by the renowned Moll Cutpurse.\""},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"SORCERER AXD MAGICIAN. 45 The following curious passage is from Lodge's Incarnato Devils, lo9H, p. 13: \"There are many in London now adaies that are besotted with this sinne, one of whom I saw on a white horse in Fleet street, a tanner knave I never lookt on, who with one figure (cast out of a schollcr's studie for a necessary servant at Borcordo) promised to find any man's oxen were they lost, restore any man's goods if they were stolne, and win any man love, where or howsoever he settled it, but his jugling knacks were quickly discovered.

Item, whether you have any conjurers, charmers, calcours, witches, or fortune- tellers, who they are, and who do resort unto them for coun- sell ?\" In the Statistical Account of Scotland, xii, 465, in the ac- count of the parish of Kirkmichael, county of Banfif, we read: \"Among the branches into which the moss-grown trunk of superstition divides itself, may be reckoned witchcraft and magic. These, though decayed and withered by time, still retain some faint traces of their ancient verdure. Even at present witches are supposed, as of old, to ride on broomsticks through the air. In this country, the 12ih of May is one of their festivals. On the morning of that day ihey are frequently seen dancing on the surface cf the water oi Avon, brushing the dews cf the lawn, and milking cows in their fold. Any un- common sickness i-i generally attributed to their demoniacal practices. They make fields barren or fertile, raise or still whirlwinds, give or take away milk at pleasure. The force of their incantations is not to be resisted, and extends even to the moon i:i the midst of her aerial career. It is the good fortune, however, of this country to be provided with an anti-conjuror that defeats both them and their sable patron in their combined efforts. His fame is widely diffused, and wherever ho goes crescil eundo. If the spouse is jealous of her husband, the anti- conjuror is consulted to restore the affections of his bewitched heart.

Sometimes Iho occa- sion of spirits revisiting this world is to inform their heir in what secret place, or i^rivate drawer in an old trunk, they had hidden the title deeds of the estate; or where, in troublesome times, they buried their mone}^ or plate. Some ghosts of mur dered persons, whose bodies have been secretly buried, cannot be at ease till their bones have been taken up, and deposited in consecrated ground, with all the rites of Christian burial. This idea is the remains of a very old piece of heathen superstition: the ancients believed that Charon was not permitted to ferry over the ghosts of unburied persons, but that they wandered up - and down the banks of the river Styx for an hundred years, after which they were admitted to a passage. \" Sometimes ghosts appear in consequence of an agreement made, whilst living, with some particular friend, that he who first died should appear to the survivor. Glanvil tells us of the ghost of a person who had lived but a disorderly kind of life, for which it was condemned to wander up and down the t irth, in the company of evil spirits till the day of judgment. In most of the relations of ghosts they are supposed to be mere \"?riul beings, without substance, and that they can pass through alls and other solid bodies at pleasure. A particular instance f this is given in Eelatiun the 27th in Glanvil's Collection, ivhere one David Hunter, neatherd to the Bishop cf Down and Connor, was for a long time haunted by the apparition of an old woman, whom he was by a secret impulse obliged to follow whenever she appeared, which he says he did for a considerable time, even if in bed with his wife: and because his wife could not hold him in his bed, she would go too, and walk after him till day, though she saw nothing; but his little dog was so well acquainted with the apparition, that he would follow it as well as his master. If a tree stood in her walk, he observed her al- ways to go through it. Notwithstanding this seeming imma- terialitj', this very ghost was not without some substance; for having performed her errand, she desired Hunter to lift her from the ground, in the doing of which, he says, she felt just like a bag of feathers.

Glanvil mentions an instance of this, in Eelation 17tli, of a Dutch lieutenant who had the faculty of seeing ghosts; and who, being prevented making way for one which he mentioned to some friends as coming towards them, v/as, with his companions, yiolentlj'^ thrown down, and sorely bruised. We further learn, by Relation 16th, that the hand of a ghost is ' as cold as a clod.' \" The usual time at which ghosts make their appearance is midnight, and seldom before it is dark; though some auda- cious spirits have been said to appear even by daylight: but of this there are few instances, and those mostly ghosts who have been laid, perhaps in the Eed Sea (of which more hereafter), and whose times of confinement wei'e expired: these, like felons confined to the lighters, are said to return more troublesome and daring than before. No ghosts can appear on Christmas Eve; this Shakspeare has put into the mouth of one of his char- acters in * Hamlet.' *• Ghosts,\" adds Grose, \" commonly appear in the same dress they usually wore whilst living; though they are sometimes clothed all in white; but that is chiefly the churchyard ghosts, who have no particular business, but seem to appear pro bono publico, or to scare drunken rustics from tumbling over their graves. I cannot learn that ghosts carry tapers in their hands, as they are sometimes depicted, though the room in which they appear, if without fire or candle, is frequently said to be as light as day. Dragging chains is not the fashion of English ghosts; chains and black vestments being chiefly the accoutrements of foreign spectres, seen in arbitrary governments: dead or alive, English spirits are free. \" If, during the time of an apparition, there isa lighted candle in the room, it will burn extremely blue: this is so universally acknowledged, that many eminent i^hilosophers have busied themselves in accounting for it, without once doubting the truth of the fact. Dogs, too, have the faculty of seeing spirits, as is instanced in David Hunter's relation, above quoted ; but in that case they usually show signs of terror, by whining and creeping to their master for protection: and it is generally supposed that they often see things of this nature when their owner cannot"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"GHOSTS, OR APPARITIONS. « there being son:e\"persons, particularly those born on a Christmas eve, who cannot see spirits. *• The coming of a spirit is r.nnounced some time before its appearance b)' a variety of loud and dreadful noises; sometimes rattling in the old hall like a coach and six, and rumbling up and down the staircase like the trundling of bowls or cannon- balls. At length the door flies open, and the spectre stalks sloAvly up to the bed's foot, and opening the curtains, looks steadfastly at the person in bed by whom it is \"seen; a ghost being very rarely, visible to more than one person, although there are several in company. It is here necessary to observe, that it has been universally found by experience, as well as affirmed by divers aj^paritions themselves, that a ghost has not the power to speak till it has been first spoken to: so that, notwithstanding the urgency of the business on which it may come, everytLing must stand still till the person visited can find sufficient courage to speak to it: an event that sometimes does not take place for many years. It has not been found that female ghosts are more loquacious than those df the male sex, both being equally re- strained by this law. \" The mode of addressing a ghost is by commanding it, in the name of the three persons of the Trinitj', to tell you who it is, and what is its business: this it mny be necessary to repeat three times; after which it will, in a low and hollow voice, de- clare its satisfaction at being spoken to, and desire the party ad- dressing it not to be afraid, for it will do him no harm. This being premised, it commonly enters its narrative, which being completed, and its requests or commands given, with injunct- ions that they be immediately executed, it vanishes away, fre- quently in a flash of light; in which case, some ghosts have been so considerate as to desire the party to whom they appeared to shut their eyes. Sometimes its departure is attended with de- lightful music. During the narration of its business, a ghost must by no means be intewrupted by questions of any kind; so doing is extremely dangerous: if any doubts arise, they must be stated after the spirit has done its tale. Questions respecting its state, or the state of any of their former acquaintance, ar<3 of- fensive, and not often answered ; spirits, perhaps, being restrainf"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"60 GHOSTS, OB APPABITIOm cd from divulging the secrets of their prison-honse. Occasion, ally spirits will even condescend to talk on common occur- ences. \" It is somewhat remarkable that ghosts do not go about their business like the persons of this world. In cases of murder, a ghost, instead of going to the next justice of the peace and lay- ing its information, or to the nearest relation of the person mur- dered, appears to some poor laborer who knows none of the parties, draws the curtains of some decripit nurse or alms-wo- man, or hovers about the place where his body is deposited. The same circuitous mode is pursued with respect to redressing injured orphans or widows: when it seems as if the shortest and most certain way would be to go to the person guilty of the in- justice, and haunt him continually till he be terrified into a res- titution. Nor are the pointing out lost writings generally man- aged in a more summary way; the ghost commonly applying to a third person ignorant of the whole affair, and a stranger to all concerned. But it is presumptuous to scrutinize too far into these matters: ghosts have undoubtedly forms and customs pe- culiar to themselves. \" If, after the first appearance, the persons employed neglect, or are prevented from, performing the message or business committed to their management, the ghost appears continually to them, at first with a discontented, next an angry, and at length with a furious countenance, threatening to tear them in pieces if the matter is not forllivrith executed: sometimes ter- rifying them, as in Glanvil's llelation 26th, by appearing in many formidable shapes, and sometimes even striking them a violent blow. Of blows given by ghosts there are many in- stances, and some wherein they have been followed with an incurable lameness. \"It should have been observed that ghosts, in delivering their commissions, in order to ensure belief, communicate to the per- sons employed some secret, known only to the parties concern- ed and themselves, the relation of which always produces the effect intended. The business being completed, ghosts appeal with a cheerful countenance, saying they shall now be at rest, and will never more disturb any one; and, thanking their"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"GHOSTS, OR APPARITIONS. 51 agents, by way of reward communicate to them something rela- tive to themselves, which they will never reveal. ** Sometimes ghosts appear, and disturb a house, without deigning to give any reason for so doing: with these, the short- est and only way is to exorcise and eject them; or, as the vulgar term is, lay them. For this purpose there must be two or three clergymen, and the ceremony must be performed in Latin; a language that strikes the most audacious ghost M'ith terror. A ghost may be laid for any term less than an hundred years, and in any place or body, full or empty ; as, a solid oak — the pom- mel of a sword— a barrel of beer, if a yeoman or simple gentle- man — or a pipe of wine, if an esquire or a justice. But of all places the most common, and what a ghost least likes, is the Red Sea; it being related in many instances, that ghosts have most earnestly besought the exorcists not to confine them in that place. It is nevertheless considered as an indisputable fact, that there are an infinite number laid there, perhaps from its being a safer prison than any other nearer at hand; though neither history nor tradition gives us any instance of ghosts es- caping or returning from this kind of transportation before their time.\" In the Statistical Account of Scotland, xxi. 148, parish of Mon- quihitter, in the additioDal communications from the Rev. A. Johnstone, we read: \" In opinion, an amazing alteration has been produced by education and social intercourse. Few of the old being able to read, and fewer still to write, their minds were clouded by ignorance. The mind being uncultivated, the imag- ination readily admitted the terrors of superstition. The ap- pearance of ghosts and demons too frequently engrossed the conversation of the young and the old. The old man's fold, where the Druid sacrificed to the demon for his corn and cattle, could not be violated by the ploughshare. Lucky and unlucky days, dreams, and omens, were most religiously attended to, and reputed witches, by their spells and their prayers, were art- ful enough to lay every parish under contribution. In short, a system of mythology fully as absurd and amusing as the myth- ology of Homer obtained general belief. But now ghosts and demons are no longer visible.

Books, trade, manu- facture, foreign and domestic news, now engross the conversa- tion; and the topic of the day is alv\\^ays warmly, if not ingenu- ously, discussed. From believing too much, manj'-, particular- ly in the higher walks of life, have rushed to the opposite ex- treme of believing too little; so that, even in this remote corner, scepticism may but too justly boast of her votaries.\" Gay has left us a jjretty tale of an apparition. The golden mark being found in bed is indeed after the indelicate manner of Swift, but yet is one of those happy strokes that rival the fel- icity of that dash of the sponge which (as Pliny tells us) hit off so well the expression of the froth in Protogenes's dog. It is impossible not to envy the author the conception of a thought which we know not whether to call more comical or more point- edly satirical, [The following singular account of an apparition is taken from a magazine of the last century: \" As I was turning over a parcel of old papers some time ago, I discovered an original letter from Mr. Caswell, the mathematician, to the learned Dr. Bentley, when he was living in Bishop Stillingfleet's family, inclosing an account of an apj^arition taken from the mouth of a clergyman who saw it. In this account there are some curious particulars, ' and I shall therefore copy the whole narrative without any omis- sion, except of the name of the deceased person who is supposed to have appeared, for reasons that will be obvious. \" ' To the Rev.

However, I am obliged to you upon that and other accounts, and if I had opportunity to shew it, you should find how much I am your faithful servant. \" ' I havo sent you inclosed a relation of an apparition; the story I had from two persons, who each had it from the author, and yet their accounts somewhat varied, and passing through more mouths has varied much more; therefore I got a friend to bring me the author at a chamber, where I wrote it down from the author's mouth; after which I read it to him, and gave him another copy; he said he could swear to the truth of it, as far as he is concerned. He is the curate of Warblington, Batchelour of Arts of Trinity College, in Oxford, about six years standing in the University; I hear no ill report of his behaviour here. He is now gone to his curacy; he has promised to send up thehanda of the tenants and his man, who is a smith by trade, and the farmer's men, as far as they are concerned. Mr. Brereton, the rector, would have him say nothing of the story, for that he can get no tenant, though he has offered the house for ten pounds a year less. Mr. P. the former incumbent, whom the apparition represented, was a man of a very ill report, supposed to have got children of his maid, and to have murthered them; but I advised the curate to SfcV nothing himself of this last part of P., but leave that to the parishioners, who knew him. Those who knew this P., say he had exactly such a gown, and that he used to whistle. * \" ' Yours, J.

Dec. 15, 1695. \" Narrative. —At Warblington, near Havant, in Hampshire, within six miles of Portsmouth, in the parsonage-house dwelt Thomas Perce the tenant, with his wife and a child, a man-ser- vant, Thomas , and a maid-strvant.

Upon this the maid, hasting up stairs, having recovered but two steps, cried out; on which the master and mistress ran down, found the candle in her hand, she grasping the child about its neck with the other arm. She told them the reason of her crying out; she would not thatnight tarry in the house, but removed to another belonging to one Henry Salter, farmer; where she cried out all the night from the terror she was in, and she could not be persuaded to go any more to the house upon any terms. On the morrow (i. e. Tuesday), the tenant's wife came to me, lodging then at Havant, to desire my advice, and have con- sult with some friends about it; I told lier I thought it was a flam, and that they had a mind to abuse Mr, Brereton the rec- tor, whose house it was; she desired me to come up; I told her I would come up and sit up or lie there, as she pleased; for then as to all stories of ghosts and apparitions I was an infidel. I went thither and sate up the Tuesday night with the tenant and his man-servant. About twelve or one o'clock I searched all the rooms in the house to see if any bod}'- were hid there to impose upon me. At last we came into a lumber room, there I smiling told the tenant that was with me, that I would call for the apparition, if there was any, and oblige him to ccme. The tenant then seemed to bo afraid, but I told him I would defend him from harm ! and then I repeated Barbara celarent Darji, (fee, jestingly; on this the tenant's countenance changed, so that he was ready to drop down with fear. Then I told him I per- ceived he was afraid, and I would prevent its coming, and re- peated Baralipton, &c., then he recovered his spirits pretty well, and we left the room and went down into the kitchen, where we were before, and sate up there the remaining part of the night, and had no manner of disturbance. \" Thursday night the tenant and I lay together in one room and the man in another room, and he saw something walk along in a black gown and place itself agr.inst a window, and there stood for some time, and then walked off. Friday morning the man relating this, I asked him why he did not call me, and I"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"GHOSTS, OR APPARITIONS. 55 told him I thought that was a trick or flam ; he told me the reason why he did not call me was, that he was not able to speak or move. Friday night we lay as before, and Saturday night, and had no disturbance either of the nights. Sunday night I lay by myself in one room (not that where the man saw the apparition), and the tenant and his man in one bed in another room; and betwixt twelve and two the man heard something walk in their room at the bed's foot, and whistling very well; at last it came to the bed's side, drew the curtain and looked on them; after some time it moved off; then the man called to me, desired me to come, for that there was something in the room went about whistling. I asked him whether he had any light or could strike one, he told me no; then I leapt out of bed, and, not staying to put on my clothes, went out of my room and along a gallery to the door, which I found locked or bolted; I desired him to unlock the door, for that I could not get in; then he got out of bed and opened the door, which was near, and went immediately to bed again. I went in three or four steps, and, it being a moonshine night, I saw the appar- ition move from the bed's side, and claj) up against the wall that divided their room and mine. I went and stood directly against it within my arm's length of it, and asked it, in the name of God, what it was, that made it come disturbing of us? I stood some time expecting an answer, and receiving none, and thinking it might be some fellow hid in the room to fright me, 7 put out my arm to feel it, and my hand seemingly went through the body of it, and felt no manner of substance till it came to the wall; then I drew hack my hand, and still it was in the same place. Till now I had not the least fear, and even now had very little; then I adjured it to tell me what it was. When I had said those words, it, keeping its back against the wall, moved gently along towards the door. I followed it, and it, going out at the door, turned its back to- ward me. It went a little along the gallery. I followed it a little into the gallery, and it disappeared, where there was no corner for it to turn, and before it came to the end of the gal- lery, where was the stairs. Then I found myself very cold from my feet as high as my middle, though I was not in great fear. I went into the bed betwixt the tenant and his man, and they"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"66 GHOSTS, OR APPABITIOm complained of my being exceeding cold. The tenant's man leaned over Lis master in the bed, and saw me stretch out my hand towards the apparition, and heard me speak the words; the tenant also heard the words. The apparition seemed to have a morning gown of a darkish color, no hat nor cap, short black hair, a thin meagre vissage of a pale swartliy color, seemed to be of about forty-five or fifty years old; the eyes half shut, the arms hanging down; the hands visible beneath the sleeve; of a middle stature. I related this description to Mr. John Lardner, rector of Havant, and to Major Battin of Langstone, in Havant parish; they both said the description agreed very well to Mr. P., a former rector of the place, who has been dead above twenty years. Upon this the tenant and his wife left the house, which has remained void since. The Monday after last Michaelmas-day, a man of Chodson, in Warwickshire, having been at Havant fair, passed by the fore- said parsonage-house about nine or ten at night, and saw a light in most of the rooms of the house; his pathway being close by the house, he, wondering at the light, looked into the kitchen window, and saw only a light, but turning himself to go away, he saw the appearance of a man in a long gown; he made haste away; the apparition followed him over a piece of glebe land of several acres, to a lane, which he crossed, and over a little meadov/, then over another lane to some pales, v. hich belong to farmer Henry Salter, my landlord, near a barn, m which were some of the farmer's men and some others. This man went into the barn, told them how he was frighted and followed fiom the parsonage-house by an apparition, which they might see stand- ing against the pales, if they went out; they went out, and saw it scratch against the pales, and make a hideous noise; it stood there some time, and then disapi^eared; their description agreed with what I saw. This last account I had from the man himself, whom it followed, and also from the farmer's men. \" Tho.

DIVINATION. Divinations differ from omens in this, that the omen is an indication of something that is to come to pass, which happens to a person, as it were by accident, without his seeking for it; whereas divination is the obtaining of a knowledge of something future, by some endeavor of his own, or means which he him- self designedly makes use of for that end. Gaule, in his Mag-astromancers Posed aud Puzzel'd, p. 165, enumerates as follows the several species of divination: \" Slwe- omancy, or divining by the elements; Aeromancy, or divining by the ayr; Pyromancy, by fire; Hydromancy, by water; Geomancy, by earth; Iheomuncy, pretending to divine by the revelation of the Spirit, and by the Scriptures, or word of God; Dcemonom- ancy, by the suggestions of evill daemons or devils; Idolomancy, by idolls, images, figures; Psyehomancy, by men's souls, affect- ions, wills, religious or morall dispositions; Aniinopomancy, by the entrails of men, women, and children; Iheriomancy, by beasts; Orniihomancy, by birds; Ichihyomancy, by fishes; Boiano- mancy, by herbs; Lithomancy, by stones; Cieromancy, by lotts; Oniromancy, by dreams; Onomalomancy, by names; Arilhmancy, by numbers: iograri^/iTnancj/, by logarithm es; Sternoinancy, from the breast to the belly; Gasirotnancy, by the soiind of, or signes upon the belly; Omphelomancy, by the navel; Chiromancy, by the hands; Pcedomxincy, by the feet; Onychomancy, by the nayles; Cephaleonomancy, by bray ling of an asses head; Tuphramancy, by ashes; Capnomancy, bv smoak; Livanomancy, by burning of frankincense: Carramancy, by melting of wax; Lecanomancy, by"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Divimm ROD. 69 a basin of water; Caioxtromancy, by looking-glasses; Chartomancy, by writing in papers (this is retained in «3hoosing Valentines, &c.); Macharomancy, by knives or swords; Chrysiulloinancy, by glasses ; Dadalomancy, by rings ; Coseinomancy, by sieves ; Axino- mancy, by sawes; Caitabomancy, by vessels ' of brasse or other metall; Roadomancy, by starres; Spaialamancy, by skins, bones, excrements; Scyomancy, by shadows; Astragalomancy, by dice; Oinomancy, by wine; Sycomancy, by figgs; Typomancy, by the coagulation of cheese; Alphitomancy, by meal, flower, or branne; Crithornancy, by grain or corn; Aleciromancy, by cocks or pullen; Gyroinancy, by rounds or circles; Lampadomancy, by candles and lamps; and in one word for all, Nagomancy, or Necromancy, by inspecting, consulting, and divining by, with, or from the dead.*' In Holiday's Marriage of the Arts, 4to., is introduced a species of divination not in the above ample list of them, entitled An- ihropomancie. DIVINING ROD. Divination by the rod or wand is mentioned in the prophecy of Ezekiel. Hosea, too, reproaches the Jews as bting infected with the like superstition: \" My people ask counsel at their stocks, and iheir siq^ declareth unto them,\" Chap. iv. 12. Not only the Chaldeans used rods for divination, but almost every nation which has pretended to that science has practised the same method. Herodotus mentions it as a custom of the Alani, and Tacitus of the old Germans. [The earliest means made use of by the miners for the dis- covery of the lode was the divining rod, so late as three years ago the process has been tried. The method of procedure was to cut the twig of an hazel or apple tree, of twelve months' growth, into a forked shape, and to hold this by both hands in a pecu- liar way, walking across the land until the twig bent, which was taken as an indication of the locality of a lode. The person who generally practices this divination boasts himself to be the seventh son of a seventh son. The twig of hazel bends in his"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"60 DIVIDING EOD. hands to the conTiction of the miners that ore is present; but then the peculiar manner in which the twig is held, bringing muscular action to baar upon it, accounts for its gradual de- flection, and the circumUaaco of the strata walked over always containing ore gives a farther credit to the process of divina- tion. ] The vulgar notion, still prevalent in the north of England, ol the hazel's tendency to a vein of lead ore, seam or stratum of coal, &c., seems to be a vestige of this rod divination. The virgula divina, or baculus divinatorius, is a forked branch in the form of a Y, cut oH an hazel stick, by means whereof people have pretended to discover mines, springs, &c., underground. The method of using it is this: the person who bears it, walking very slowly over the places where he suspects mines or springs may be, the effluvia exhaling from the metals, or vapor from the water impregnating the wood, makes it dip, or incline, which is the sign of a discovery. In the Living Library, or Ilistoricall jJeditations, fol. 1621, p. 283, we read: \" No man can tell why forked sticks of hazill (rather than sticks uf other trees growing upon the very same places) are fit to shev/ the places vvhere the vtines of gold and silver are. The sticke bending itselfe in the places, at the bot- tome where the same veines are.\" See Lilly's Historj^ of his Life and Times, p. 32, for a curious esperiuient (which he confesses, however, to have failed) to discover hidden treasure by the hazel rod. In the Gent. Mag. for February 1752, xxii. 77, we read : *• M. Linnaeus, when he was upon his voyage to Scania, hearing his secretary highly extol the virtues of his divining wand, was wil- ling to convince Inm of its insufficiency, and for that purpose concealed a purse of one hundred ducats under a ranunculus, which grew by itself in a meadow, and bid the secretary Imd it if he could. The wand discovered nothing, and M. Linnseus's mark was soon trampled down by the company who were present; so that when M. Liunaus went to finish the experi- ment by fetching the gold himself, he was utterly at a loss where to seek it. The man with the wand assisted him, and pro- nounced that he could not lie the way they were going, but <juito"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"DIVINATION BY LOTS, 61 the contrary: so pursued the direction of his wand, and actually dug out the gold. M. Linnaeus adds, that such another experi- ment would be sufficient to make a proselyte of him.\" \"We read; in the same work for Nov. 1751, xxi. 507: \" So early as Agriccla the divining rod was in much request, and has obtained great credit for its discovery where to dig for metals and springs of water: for some years past its reputation has been on the decline, but lately it has been revived with great success by an ingenious gentleman, who, from numerous experiments, hath good reason to believe its effects to be more than imagination. He says, that hazel and willow rods, he has by experience found, will actual- ly answer with all persons in a good state of health, if they are used with moderation and at some distance of time, and after meals, when the operator is in good spirits. The hazel, willow, and elm, are all attracted by springs of water; some persons have the virtue intermittently; the rod, in their hands, will at- tract one half-hour, and repel the next. The rod is attracted by all metals, coals, amber, and lime-stone, but with different degrees of strengtli. The best rods are those from the hazel, or nut tree, as they are pliant and tough, and cut in the winter months. A shoot that terminates equally forljied is to be met with, two single ones, of a length and size, may be tied to- gether with a thread, and will answer as well as the other.\" In the Supplement to the Athenian Oracle, p. 234, v/o read, that the experiment of a hazel's tendency to a vein of lead ore is limited to St. John Baptist's Eve, and that with an hazel of that same year's growth.\" DIVINATION BY VIRGILIAN, HOMERIC, OR BIBLE LOTS. This is a species of divination performed by opening tho works of Virgil, &c., and remarking the lines which shall be covered with your thumb the instant the leaves are opened; by which, if they can be interpreted in any respect to relate to you, they are accounted prophetic. This custom appears to have"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"62 DIVINATION BY LOTS. been of very ancient date, and was tried with Homer's poem as well as Virgil's. They who applied to this kind of oracle were said to try the sortes Ilomericce, or sories Virgiliance. King Charles the First is said to have tried this method of learning his fate, and to have found the oracle but too certain. Dr. Johnson, in his Life of Cowley, suspects that great poet to have been tinctured with this superstition, and to have con- sulted the Virgilian lots on the great occasion of the Scottish treaty, and that he gave credit to the answer of the oracle. Dr. Ferrand, in his Love Melancholy, 1610, p. 177, mentions the \" kinde of divination by (he opening of a hooke at all adventures; and this was called the Vale)dmian chance, and by some sories Virgiliance; of which the Emperor Adrian was wont to make very much use.\" He adds, \" I shall omit to speak here of as- tragalomancy, that wae done with huckle bones; ceromancy, and all other such like fooleries.\" Dr. Nathaniel Home, in his Daemonologie, ]650, p. 81, says: \"For sorcery, properly so called, viz. divination by lotts, it is too much apparent how it abounds. For lusory lots, the state groans under the losse by them, to the ruine of many men and families; as the churches lament under the sins by them ; and for other lots, by sieves, books, &c., they abound as witchery, &o., abounds.\" The superstitious among the ancient Christians practiced a similar kind of divination by opening the Old and Neio Testamoif. See Gibbon's Decline and Fall, vi. 333. He is speaking of Clovis, A. D. 507, who, marching from Paris, as he proceeded with decent reverence through the holy diocese of Tours, con- sulted the shrine of St. Martin, ' the sanctuary and oracle of Gaul. His messengers were instructed to remark the words of 'the psalm which should happen to be chanted at the precise moment when they entered the church. These words most fortunately expressed the valor and victory of the champions of heaven, and the application was easily transferred to the new- Joshua, the new Gideon, who went foiih to battle against the enemies of the Lord. He adds: \" This mode of divination, by accepting as an omen the first sacred words which in particular circumstances should be presented to the eye or ear, was derived"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"DIVINATION BY THE BLADE-BONE, 63 from the Pagans, and the Psalter or Bible was substituted to the poems of Homer and Virgil.

This mode of divination is mentioned there also as being more gen- eral, and practiced to tell who or who shall get such a person for their spouse or husband. Mason, in tlie Anatomic of Sor- cerii, 1612, p. 91, enumerates, among the then prevailing super- stitions, \"Turning of o. sieve to show who had hewilched one.\" Melton, in his Astrologaster, p. 43, gives a catalogue of many superstitious ceremonies, in the first whereof this occurs: \"That if anything be lost amongst a company of servants, with the trick of the sivo and sheers, it may bo found out againe, and who stole it.\" Grose tells us that, to discover a thief by the sieve and shears, j^ou must stick the point of the shears in the wood of the sieve, and let two persons support it, balanced upright, with their two fingers; then read a certain chapter in the Bible, and afterwards ask St. Peter and St. Paul if A or C is the thief, naming all the persons you suspect. On naming the real thisf, the sieve will turn suddenly round about.

In the Athenian Oracle, i. 425, divination hy a Bible and key is thus described : \"A Bible having a key fastened in the middle, and being held between the two forefingers of two persons, will turn round after some w'ords said: as, if one desires to find out a thief, a certain verse taken out of a psalm is to be repeated, and those who are suspected nominated, and if they are guilty, the book and key will turn, else not.\" DIVINATIONS BY ONIONS AND FAGGOTS IN ADVENT.

We are indebted to that valuable and interesting magazine tlie \" Popular SScieuce Mouthly,\" lor the following explanation of the i)henouienon of mind reading. It wan writtsn by a phyfiieiiin of high standing (George M. Beard, M. D.) who has given much attention to this and kindred subjects. In the history of science and notably in the history of i^hysiology and medicine, it has often happened that the ignorant and ob- scure have stumbled upon facts and phenomena which, though wrongly interpreted by themselves, yet, when investigated and explained, have proved to be of the highest interest. The phen- omena of the emotional trance, for example, had been known for ages, but not until Mesmer forced them on the scientific world, by his public exhibitions and his ill-founded theory of animal magnetism, did they receive any serious and intelligent study. Similarly the general fact that mind may so act on body as to produce involuntary and unconscious muscular motion was by no means unrecognized by physiologists, and yet not until the •* mind-reading \" excitement two years ago was it demonstrated that this principle could be utilized for the finding of any object or limited locality on which a subject, with whom an operator is in physical connection, concentrates his mind. Although, as I have since ascertained, experiments of this kind had been previously pe.-formed in a quiet, limited way in private circles, and mostly by ladies, yet very few had heard of cr wit- nessed them; they were associated in the popular mind very naturally with \" mesmerism \" ot \"animd magnetism,\" and by some were called \" mesmeric games,\" The physiological ex- planation had never been even suggested ; hence the first public exhibitions of Brown, with his brilliantly successful demonstra- tions of his skill iu this direction, were a new revelation to phy- siologists as well as to (he scientific world in general. The method of mind-reading introduced by Brown, which is but one of many methods that have been or may be used, is at follows: The operator, usually blind-folded, firmly applies the back"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72 THE ART OF MIKD BEADIKO. of the hand of the snbject to be operatad on against Lis own forehead, and with his other hand presses lightly upon the palm and fingers of the subject's hand. In this position he can detect, if sufficiently expert, the slightest movement, impulse, tremor, tension, or relaxation, in the arm of the subject. He then re- quests the subject to concentrate his mind on some locality in the room, or on some hidden object, or on some one of the letters of the alphabet suspended aloDg Ihe -wall. The operator, blind- folded, marches sometimes very rapidly with the subject up and down the room or rooms, up and down stairways, or out-of-doors through the streets, and, when he comes near the locality on which the subject is concentrating his mind, a slight impulse or movement is communicated to his hand by the hand of the sub- ject. This impulse is both involuntary and unconscious on the part of the subject. He is not aware, and is unwilling, at first, to believe, that he gives any such impulse; and yet it is sufficient to indicate to the expert and practised operator that he has ar- rived near the hidden object, and then, by a close study and careful trials in different directions, upward, downward, and at various points of the compass, he ascertains precisely the local- ity, and is, in many cases, as confident as though he had re- ceived verbal communication from the subject. Even though the article on which the subject concentrates his mind be very small, it can quite frequently be picked out from a large number, provided the subject be a good one, and the op- erator sufficiently skillfuh The article is sometimes found at once, with scarcely any searching, the operator going to it di- rectly, without hesitation, and with a celerity and precision that, at first sight, and until tha physiological explanation is under- stood, justly astonish even the most thoughtful and skeptical, (lu New Haven I saw Brown, before a large audience, march off rapidly through the aisle and find at once the person on whom the subject was concentrating Lis mind, although there was the privilege of selecting any one out of a thousand or more present.) These experiments, it should be added, are performed in public or private, and on subjects of unquestioned integrity, in the presence of experts, and under a combinution of circumstance"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"THS ART OF MIND HEADIKQ. n and conditions for the elimination of sources of error that make it necessary to rule out at once the possibility of collusion. The alternative is, therefore, between the actual transfer of fhought from subject to operator, as has been claimed, and the theory of unconscious muscular motion and relaxation on the part of the sulject, the truth of which 1 have demonstrated by numerous experiments. One of the gentlemen with whom I have experiment, Judge Blydenberg, who bcgnn to test his powers directly after I first called public attention to the subject in New Haven, claims to succeed, even with the most intellectual persons, provided they fully comply \\vith the conditions, and honestly and persistently concentrate their minds. One fact of interest, with regard to his experiments, is the exceeding minuteness of the objects that he finds. A large number of the audience empty their pockets cn the table, until it is covered vith a medley of keys, knives, trinkets, and miscellaneous small oljects. Out of them the 6u1 ject belects a small sec<l a littlo larger than a pea, and even this the operator, after Kcme searching, hits precisely. One may take a large bunch of keys, throw them on the table, and he picks out the very one on which the subject concentrates his mind. Another fact of interest in his experiments is that, if a subject thinks ovtr a number of articles in different parts of the room, and, after some doubt and hesitation, finally selects some one, the operator will lead him, sometimes successively, to the dif- ferent objects on which he has thought, and will wind up w ith the one that he finally selected. He also performs what is known as the \" double test,\" which consists in taking the hand of a third party, who knows nothing of the hidden object, but who is connected with another party who does know, and who concentrates his mind upon it. The connection of these two persons is made at the wrist, and the motion is communicated from one to the other through the arms and hands. The \"double test\" has been regarded by some as an argument against the theory that this form of mind-reading was simply the utilizing of unconscious muscular motion on the part of the persons operated upon."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"7i TJTE ART OF MIM) nEADIKG. ' This gentleman represents that the sensation of muscular thrill is very slight indeed, even with good suhjects; and, in or- der to detect it, he directs his own mind as closely as possible to the hand of the subject. In all these experiments, with all mind-readers, the require- ment for the subject to concentrate the mind on the locality agreed upon is absolute; if that condition is not fulfilled, noth- ing can be done, for the very excellent reason that, without such mental concentration, there will bo no unconscious muscular tension or relaxation to guide the operator. Experiments of the following kind I havo made repeatedly with the above-named gentleman: A dozen or more pins may be stuck about one inch or half an inch apart into the edge of a table; I concentrate my mind on any one of these pins, telliug no one. The operator enters the room, gets the general direction of the object in the usual way, and, when he has ccme near to the row of pins, he will limit the physical connection to one of his index-fingers, pressing firmly against one of mine, and in this way ho soon finds the head of the pin on which my mind has been concentrated. The only limitation of area in the locality that can be found by a good mind-reader with a good subject is, that two objects should not be so near to each other that the finger of the operator strikes on both at once, \"When I began the study of this subject, I supposed, even after the true theory of the matter had become clear to me, that very small objects and narrow areas could not be found in this way. Subsequent experiments showed that this supposition was erro- neous. In a wide hall, in the presence of a large audience, where the subject had the right to think of any object he chose, Brown once found, after considerable searching, so limited an area as a capital letter in the title of a newspaper pinned up on the wall and barely within reach About an hour af'er, in the Bame place, he iound a very small vial out of quite a large num- ber ranged in a row. Although reasoning deductively from the known relations of mind to body, I had established conclusively j to my own mind that the so-called mind-reading was really > xnuscle-readiDg, yet I could cot believe, until the above-named l"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"TUB ART OF MIKD nEADIXG. 75 experiments had been made, and frequently repeated, that it vrc.s possible for even the most expert operator to find Bnch F.mall oljects; r.nd no physiologist, I am sure, vould have be- lieved snch precision in these experiments conceivable until his general deductions had been many times verified, and supple- mented by observations in which every source of error was guarded ag.ninst. As already remarked, there are a variety of ways of making the physical connection between subject and oj^erator. A lady may go out of the room, and while she is absent an object is hidden. She returns, and two ladies, who know where the ob- ject is, stand up beside her in the middle of the room and placo both cf their hands upon her body, one hand in front, the other behind; all three stand therefor a moment, the two subjects who know where the object is, keeping their minds intensely concentrated on that locality. In a moment or so this lady who is to find the object moves off in the direction where it is, tho other ladies with her still keeping their hands upon her, and in nearly all cases she finds it. This is accomplished by the un- conscious muscular tension of the two ladies who know where the object is, acting upon the person of the lady who is seeking it. This experiment I have repeated with a number of amateur performers, and in all cases with pretty uniform success. This method is easier, both to learn and to practice, than some of the others; it is also far less artistic, and is not at all adapted for the finding of very small localities. It illustrates, however, the general principle of mind acting on body producing muscular tension in the direction of that locality on which the thoughts are con'^entrated. The relaxation, when the locality or its neighborhood is reached, is not so distinctly appreciated in this method of ex- perimenting, which is BufScient, however, to ens.ble the operator to get the right direction and to proceed until the corner or side of the room is reached; then, by a combination of manipulation and guess-work, she will, after a few trials, get hold of the pre- cise ol ject hidden, or locality thought of.

The special methods of muscle-reading here described may be varied almost indefinitely, the only essential condition being, that the connection between the subject or subjects is of such a nature as to easily allow the sense of muscular tension or relax- ation to be communicated. Instead of two subjects, there may be three, four, or half a dozen, or but one. With a number of subjects the chances of success are greater thr.n with one, for the twofold reason that the united muscular tension of all will be more readily foU than that of but one, and because any single subject may be a bad one — that is, one who is capable of mus- cular control- -while among a number there will be very likely one or more good ones. For these two reasons, amateurs suc- ceed in this latter method when they fail or succeed but im- perfectly after the method of Brown. A method frequently used, although it is not very artistic, consists in simply taking the hand of the olject and leading him directly, or, as is more likely to be the case, indirectly to the locality on which his mind is concentrated. J. Stanley Grimes thus describes the performance of a mind- reader in Chiccgo: \"I repeatedly witnessed similar perform- ances with different experts in this branch and under circum- stances where every element of error from intentional or unin- tentional collusion was rigidly excluded. At the request of the company the same young lady was again sent from the room and blindfolded, as on previous occasions. The gentleman re- quested the company to suggest anything they desired the subject should be willed to do, thus removing any possibility of a secret agreement to deceive between the parties.

In the ex- periment described by Mr. Grimes the subject placed three fin- gers of his right hand on the shoulder of the operator. Note the fact that in all these experiments direction and locality are all that the miud-reader finds; the quality of the object found, or indeed whether it be a movable object at all, or merely a limited local- ity, as a figure in the carpet or on the wall, is not known to the mind-reader until he picks it up or handles it; then if it be a small obj ^,ct, as a hat, a book, or coin, or tidy, he very naturally takes it and moves off with it in the direction indicated by the unconscious muscular tension of the subject, and leaves it where he is ordered by unconscious muscular relaxation.

I have said that various errors of inference, as well as of ob- servation, have been associated with these experiments. A young lady who had been quite successful as r.n amateur in this art was suljected by mo to a criiical analysis of her powers before a large private audience. She supposed that it was necessary for all the persons in the audience to concentrate their minds on the sul jsct as well as those whose hands were upon her. I proved by some decisive experiments, in which a comparison was made with what could be done by chance alone, that this was not necessarj^ and that the silent, unexpressed will of the aiiclicnco had no effect on the operator, save certain nervous sen- sations created by the emotion of expectanc}'. Similarly, I proved that, when connected with the subjects by a wire, she could find nothing, although she experienced various subjective sensations, which she attributed to \" magnetism,\" but which were familiar results of mind acting on body. Another lady, who is quite successful in these experiments, thought it was necessary to hide keys, and supposed that \" mag- netism \" had something to do with it. I told her that that was not probable, and tried another object, and found that it made no difiference what the object was. She supposed that it was necessary that the object should be secx'eted on some person. I found that this was not necessary She does not always succeed in finding the exact locality at once, but in some cases she goes directly to it; she very rarely fails. In order to settle the question beyond dispute whether un- conscious muscular action was the sole cause of this success in finding objects, I made the following crucial experiments with this Lidy: Ten letters of the alphabet were placed on a piano, the letters being written on large pieces of paper. I directed her to see how many times she would get a letter which was in the mind of one of the observers in the room correctly by chance purely, without any physical touch. She tried ten times, and got it right twice. I thrn had her try ten experiments with the hand of the person operated on against the forehead of the oper- ator, the hand of the operator lightly touching against the fin-"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE ART OF MIND BEADIXG. 79 gers of tliis hand, and the person operated on, concentrating her mind all the while on t :e object, and looking at it. In ten ex- j)eriments, tried this day, with the same letters, she was success- ful six times. I then tried the same number of experiments with a wire, one end being attached to the head or hand of tho subject, and the other end to the head or hand of the operator. The wire was about ten feet long, and was so arranged— being made fast at the middle to a chair — that no unconscious muscu- lar motion could be communicated through it from the person on whom she was operating. She was successful but once out of ten times. Thus we see that by pure chance she was successful twice out often times; by utilizing unconscious muscular action in the method of Brown she was successful six times out of ten. Wben connected by a wire she was less successful than when she depended on pure chance without any physical connection. In order still further to confirm this, I suggested to this lady to find objects with two persons touching her body in the manner we have above described. I told these two to deceive her, con- centrating their minds on the object hidden, at the same time using conscious motion toward some other part of the room. These experiments, several times repeated, showed that it was possible to deceive her, just as we had found it possible to de- ceive other muscle-readers. The question wli ether it is possible for one to be a good muscle-reader and pretty uniformly successful, and yet not know just how the trick is done, must be answered in the affirm- ative. It is possible to become quite an adept in this art with- out sTispecting, even remotely, the physiological explanation. The muscular tension necessary to guide the operator is but slight, and the sensation it produces may be very easily refer- red by credulous, uninformed operators to the passage of \" mag- netism;\" and I am sure that with a number of operators on whom I have experimented this mistake is made. Some operators de- clare that they cannot tell how they find the locality, that their success is to them a mystery ; these declarations are made by private, amateur performers, who have no motive to deceive me, and whoso whole conduct during the experiments confirms their statements. Other operators speak of thrills or vibrations"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"80 THE AB T OF MnD BEADIXG. xrhich tbey feel, auras and all sorts of indefinable sensations. These manifold sj'mptoms are purely subjective, tbe result of mind acting on the body, the emotions of wonder and expec- tancy develoinng various phenomena that are attributed lo \" an- imal magnetism,\" \" mesmerism \" or \"electricity \"—in short, to everything but the real cause. I have seen amateurs who de- clared that they experienced these sensations when trying with- out success to \" read mind through the wires, or perhaps with- out any connection with t]ie subject whatever. Persons who are in the vicinity of galvanic batteries, even though not in the cir- cuit, very often report similar experiences. The facts which sustain the theory that the so-called mind- reading is really mus('le-reading — that is, unconscious muscr.lar tension and relaxation on the part of the subject — may be thus Bummarizod: 1. Mind-readers are only able to find direction and locaUly, and, in order to find even these, thej' must be in physical connection wi:h th'j sul.ject, who must move his body or some portion of it — as the fingers, hand, or arm. If the sul ject sits perfectly still, and keeps his fingers, hand, and arm, perfectly quiet, so far as it is possible for him to do so by conscious effort, the mind- reader can never find even the hcalitrj on which the subject's mind is concentrated; he can only find the direction where the locality is. Mind-readers never tell what an object is, nor can they describe its color or appearance; locality, and nothing more definite than locality, is all they find. The object hidden may be a coin or a corn-cob, a pin or a pen-holder, an elephant's tusk or a diamonnd-pin— it is all the same. Again, where con- nection of the operator with the subject is made by a wire, bo arranged that mass-motion cannot be communicated, and the subject concentrates his mind ever so steadily, the operator does just what he would do by pure chance, and no more. This I have proved repeatedly with good subjects and expert perform- ers 2. The subject can successfully deceive the operator in various Trays — first of all, by using muscular tension in the wrong di- rection, andmtiscular relaxation at the wrong locality, while at the same time the mind is concentrated iu the right direction."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"THE ATtT OF MIKD nEALlNQ. 61 To deceive a good oper.ator in tliis way is not always easy, but after some i^ractice the art can be acquired, and it is a perfectly fair test in all experiments of this nature. Yet another way to deceive the mind-reader is, to think of some object or locality at a great distance from the room in which the experiments are made, and, if there be no ready means of exit, the performer will be entirely baffled. I am aware that some very surprising feats have been done in the way of finding distant out-of-door localities by muscle-readers, but in these cases there has usually been an implied understanding that the search was to be extended to out-of-doors; muscle-readers nave thus taken their subject up and down stairs or from one room or hall into another, and out-of-doors until the house or locality was reached. In Danielsonville, Connecticut, Brown, after an evening's ex- hibition in which his failures had been greater than usual (the intelligent committee having the matter in charge being pre- pared by previous discussion of the theory of unconscious mus- cular motion), took a subject, and led him from the hotel in the darkness through the streets, to some rather out-of-the-way building on which the subject had fixed his mind. A somewhat similar exploit is recorded of Corey, a performer in Detroit. Another wr.y in which deception may be jiractised is for the subject to select some object or locality on the person of the muscle-reader. This object may be a watch, or a pocket-book, or a pencil-case, or any limited region of his clothing, as a but- ton, a cravat, or wristband. If such a selection be made, and the method of physical connection above described be used, the experiment will be a failure, provided the muscle-reader does not know or suspect that an object on his own jierson, is to be chosen. Similarly, if the subject selects a locality on his own person, as one ot the fingers or finger-nails of the hand that con- nects with the muscle-reader. When such tests are used, there is not, so to speak, any leverage for the tension of the arm to- ward the locality on which the mind is concentrated, and the muscle-reader either gets no clew, or else one that misleads him 3. When a subject, who has good control over his mental and"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"61 THE ART OF MIXD BEADIXG. muscular movements, keeps the arm counected with the opera- tor pcr/ed/^/ stiff, even thoufjh his mind be well concentrated on the hidden oLject, the operator cannot find either the direction or the locality. This is a test which those who have the requisite physical qualifications can sometimes fulfill without difiiculty. Here I may remark that the requirement to concentrate the mind on the locality and direction sought for all the time the search is being made is one that few, if any, can perfectly ful- fill. Any number of distracting thoughts will go through the best-trained mind of one who, in company with a blindfolded operator, is being led furiously up and down aisles, halls, streets, and stairways, fearful each moment of stumbling or striking his head, and followed, it may be, by astonished and eager investi- gators. And yet these mental distractions do not seem to in- terfere with the success of the experiment unless the arm is kept studiously rigid, in which case nothing is found save by pure chance. The best subjects w^ould appear to be those who have moderate pov.-er of mental concentration and slight control over their muscular movements. Credulous wonder-loving subjects are sometimes partially entranced through the emotions of rev- erence and expectation; with subjects in this state, operators are quite sure of success. 4. The uncertainty and capriciousness of these experiments, even with expert operators, harmonize with the explanation here given. Even with good subjects all mind-readers do not uniformly succeed; there is but little certainty or precision to the average results of experiments, however skillfully perform- ed. An evening's exhibition may be a series of successes or a series of failures according to the character of the subjects; and even in the successful tests the operator usually must try various directions and many localities, sometimes for ten or fifteen min- utes, before he finds the locality sought for; cases where the operator goes at once in the right direction, stops at the right locality, and knows when he has reached it, exceptional. 5. Many of those who became expert in this art are aware that they succeed by detecting slight muscular tension and relaxation on the part of the subject. Some operators have studied the subject scientifically, and are"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"THE ART OF MWD READIXG, 83 able to analyze witli considerable precision tlie different steps in the process. In the minds of many this fact alone is evidence adequate to settle the question beyond doubt. G. A theoretical and explanatory argument is derived from the recent discovery of motor centers in the cort?x of the brain. I was repeating the experiments of Fritsch and Hitzig at the time when my attention -vvas first directed to the remarkable ex- hibitions of Brown, and the results of my studies in the electri- cal irritation of the brains of dogs and rabbits suggested to me the true explanation of mind-reading before any opportunity had been allowed for satisfactory experiments. The motto \"when we think, we move,\" which I have some- times used to illustrate the close and constant connection of mind and body, seems to be justified by these experiments on the brain, and may assist those who wish to obtain a condensed statement of the physiology of mind-reading. Taking into full consideration the fact that all physiologists are not in full ac- cord as to the interpretation to be given to these experiments, whether, for example, the phenomena are due to direct or reflex action, still it must be allowed, by all who study this subject experimentally, that thought-centers and muscle-centers are near neighbors, if not identical. The popular theory to account for these failures is the weari- ness or exhaustion of the operator; but both in New York and in New Haven it was observed that Brown met with his most brilliant successes in the latter part of the evening, the reason being that he happened then to have better subjects. From an editorial in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal (September 23, 1875), referring to the mind-reading exhibitions, and accepting the explanation here given, I make the following extract: \"The whole performance seems to us to furnish good illustrations of one or two well-known principles of great physi- ological interest. Of these the most important is one that finds at once support and application in the modern doctrine of the nature of aphasia and kindred disorders; namely, that the thought, the conscious mental conception, of an act differs from the voluntary impulse necessary to the performance of that act only in that it corresponds to a fainter excitation of neryous een*"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"£4 THE ART OF MIXD LEADIXG. ters in the cortex cerebri which in both cases are anatomically identical. Thus, in certain forms of aphasia, the power to think iu words is lost at the same time with the power of si')eech. Some persons think definitely only when they think aloud, and it would readily be believed in the case of children and unedu- cated persons that the ability to read would often be seriously interfered with if they were not permitted to read aloud. Simi- liarly, a half-premeditated act of any kind slips often into per- formance before its author is aware of the fact. Further, there is reason to think, from the experiments of Ilitzig, that these same centers may be excited by the stimulus of electricity so as to call out some of the simpler co-ordinated movements of the muscles on the opposite side of the body. Applying, now, this principle to the case iu hand, it will be evident that for the per- son experimented with to avoid giving 'muscular hints,' of either a positive or negative kind, would be nearly impossible.\" In all tbese experiments it should be observed there is no one muscle, there is no single group of muscles, through which this tension and relaxation are developed; it is the finger, the hand, the arm, or the whole bod}', according to the method employed. Among the various methods of making connection between the subject and operator, are the following: 1. The back of the subject's hand is held firmly again?t the forehead of the operator, who, with his other hand, lightly touches the fingers of the suLject's<4iand. Tuis is, undoubtedly, the most artistic of all known methods. 2. The hand of the operator loosely grasps the wrist of the subject. This is a very inartistic method, and yet great success is of- tentimes attained by it, 3. One finger of the operator is applied to one finger of the subject, papilla3 touching papillae. This is a modification of the first method; by it exceedingly small objects or localities are found. 4. The oijerator is connected in the usual way with a third party who does not know the locality thought of by the subject, but is connected with the subject by the wrist (\" double test\"). In this experiment, wliich astounded even the best observers."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"THE ART OF MVD READIXG, 85 the imconscions muscular motion was communicated from tlie Buliject to the arm of tho third party, and through the arm of the third party to the operator. 5. Two, Ihree or more snljects, who agree on the locality to be thought of, apply their hands to the body of the operator in front and behind. This method is excellent for beginners, and the direction is easily found by it; but it is obviously not adaj^ted for the speedy finding of small objects; it is frequently used by ladies. C. The hand of the subject lightly rests on the shoulder of the operator. In all these methods the operator is usually blindfolded, so that he maj' get no assistance from any other source than the unconscious muscular action of the subject. The movements of the operator in these experiments may be either very slow, cautious, and deliberate, or rapid and reckless. Brown in his jiiablic exhibitions, was very careful about getting the physical connection right, and then moved off very rapidly, sometimes in the right direction, sometimes in the wrong one, but frequently with such speed as to inconvenience the subject on whom he was operating. These rapid movements give greater brilliancy to public experiments and serve to entrance the subject, and thus to render him far more likely to be uncon- scious of his own muscular tension and relaxation through which the operator is guided. The power of muscle-reading depends mainly, if not entirely, on some phase of the sense of touch. Dr. Hanbury Smith tells me that a certain maker of lancets in London, had acquired great reputation for the superiority of his workmanship. Sud- denly there was a falling off in the character of the instrument that he sent out, and it was found that his wife, on whom he had depended to test the sharpness of the edge on her finger or thumb, had recently died. That the blind acquire great delicacy of touch has long been known; Laura Bridgman is a familiar illustration. Dr. Carpen- ter states (although there are always elements of error through the unconscious assistance of other senses in cases of this kind)"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86 THE ART OF MIXD READING, that Miss Bridgm.in recognized bis brother, whom she had not met for a year, by the touch of the hand alone Every physician recognizes the fact of this difference of sus- ceptibility lo touch; and in the diagnosis of certain conditions of disease, much depends on the tadus erudlius. I am not sure whether this delicacy of perception, by which muscle-reading is accomplished, is the ordinary sense of touch, tbat of contact, or of some of the special modifications of this sense. It is to physiologists and students of diseases of the nervous system a well-known fact that there are several varieties of sensibility— to touch, to temperature, to pressure or weight,and to pain- -which, possibly, represent different rates or modes of vibration of the nerve-force. The proportion of persons who can succeed in muscle-read- ing, by the methods here described, is likewise a natural subject of inquirj'. Judging from the fact that out of the comparitively few who have made any efforts in this direction, a large number have succeeded after very little practice, and some few, who have given the matter close attention, have acquired great j)roficiency, it is i)robable that the majority of people of either sex, between the ages of fifteen and fifty, could attain, if they chose to labor for it, with suitable practice, a certain grade of skill as muscle- readers, provided, of course, good subje cts were experimented with. It is estimated that about one in five or ten persons can be put into the mesmeric trance by the ordinary processes; and, under extraordinary circumstances, while under great excite- ment, and by different causes, every one is liable to be thrown into certain stages or forms of trance; the capacity for the trance- state is not exceptional; it is not the peculiar property of a few individuals— it belongs to the human race; similarly with the capacity for muscle-reading. The age at which this delicacy of touch is most marked is an inquiry of interest; experience, up to date, would show that the very old are not good muscle-readers. I have never known of one under fifteen years of age to study this subject; although it is conceivable that bright children, younger than that age, might have sufficient power of attention to acquire th© art, certainly if they had good instruction in it"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Tins ART OF Mim) BEADiyO. 87 In these mind-reading experiments, as indeed in all similar or allied experiments with the living human beings, there are fiix sources of error, all of which must be absolutely guarded against if the results are to have any precise and authorative value in science. 1. The involuntary and unconscious action of brain and mus- cle, including trance, in which the subject becomes a pure auto- maton. I have used the phrase \"involuntary lifo \"to cover all these phenomena of the system that appear independently of the will. The mnjority of those who studied the subject of mind- readidg— even physicians and physiologists— tailed through want of a proper understanding or appreciation of this side of physiology. 2. Chance and coincidences. Neglect of this source of error was the main cause of the unfortunate results of the wire and chain experiments with mind-readers. 3 Intentional deception on the part of the subject. 4. Unintentional deception on the part of the subject. 5. Collasion of confederates. To guard against all the above sources of error it is necessary for the experimenter himself to use deception. 6. Uuintentional assistance of audience or bystanders. When the muscle-reader performs before an enthusiastic audience, he is likely to be loudly applauded after each success; and, if the excitement be great, the applause, with shuffling and rustling, may begin before he reaches the right locality, while he is approaching it; when^ on the other hand, he is far away from the locality, the audience will inform him by ominous silence. The performance thus becomes like the hide-and-seek games of children, where they cry \" \"Warm ! \" as the blindfolded operator approaches the hidden object; ** Hot ! \" as he comes close to it; and \" Cold ! \" when he wanders far from it. Some of the apparent successes with the wire-test may be thus ex- plained. In regard to all the public exhibitions of muscle-readers, it should be considered that the excitement and eclat of the occa- sion contribute not a little to the success of the operator; the •ubjects grow enthusiastic— are partly entranced, it may bo —"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"83 AlCnEMT. become partners in the cause of iLe performer — and uncon- Bciously riJl liira far more tlian tliey would do in a similar en- tertainment that was purely private. In a private entertainment of muscle-reading at vi'bicli I was present, one of the subjects, while standing still, with liiii Lands on the operator, actually took a step forward toward the locality on which his mind was concentrated, thus illustrating in a visible manner the process by which muscle-reading is made possible. The subject under discussion, it will be observed, is to be studied bolh inductively and deductively. The general claim of mind or thou.qht reading is disproved not by any such ex- periments as arc hero detailed, no matter how accurate or nu- merous the;' may be, but my reasoning deductively from the broad principle of phj'siolo'gy, that no human being has or can have any qualifies dirercnt in hbul fjora those that belong to the race in general.

Alchkmy was the most important branch of natural magic; it had for its aim the transmutation of metals, that is the conver- sion of the baser metals into solid, virgin gold. To attain this end, the alchemists sought as well to discover the *• powder of prcjection,\" as they termed it, which, thrown upon any metal, instantaneously converted it into gold, as to seek out the \"Philosopher's Stone,\" or base of all matter, which enjoyeel the additional property of repairing the ravages of dis- ease and time upon the human frame, and, in this wise, securing not only unlimited wealth but health and vigor to a very old age. Authors of the Middle Ages, occupied by these day dreams, cite, be it understootl, the names of a goodly number of person- ages, who, they state, had actually discovered the philosopher'? fitone."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"ALCIIEMT. 60 Amand de Villeneuve was conducted tbrongli his researches to the discovery of a substance, which he assumed to be the \"Elixir ot long life,\" but the augmented use ot this article, in our day, experience has shown to be far from conducive to the health or happiness of a majority of the people. In th^ following terms he announces his discovery in his treatise entitled \" The Conservation of Y\"outh.\" \" Who would have imagined that from wine we could extract a liquid, demanding diSerent treatment, which has neither its color, its nature, nor its efifects? This water is spirits of wine, or better. Water of Life {Aqua Viice), and this name befits it for it causes us to live a long time.\" Nicholas Flamel is the most illustrious of all those to whom has been attributed discovery of the philosopher's stone. A writing master and engraver, Nicholas Flamel succeeded in ob- taining the most colossal fortune of his daj-, so that, oftentimes, the king came to tap the money chest of the artisan. He erected the famous Tower of Saint Jacques, from the bell of which, in a subsequent century, rang the signal for commencing the Mas- sacre of St. Bartholomew, and enriched the church with magnifi- cent donations. He carried his luxury to such a degree as to enact, during his lifetime, a mausoleum for Pernella, his wife, and himself, covered with bas reliefs, in which alchemists in a later day pretended to have discovered the various operations indicated for the correct accomplishment of the Great Work. Flamel himself declared that he had discovered the philoso- pher's stone, still, according to the historian, La Martiuiere, his riches had a less marvellous origin. Flamel, according to this version, had been called as a writing master to make out an inventory of some goods to be sold at auction, and among the articles he discovered a little manuscript book, written in part in Hebrew and in part in some unknown characters which he purchased for three sous. Several days afterwards Flamel and Pernella made a pilgrim- age to the Church of Saint Jacques de- Galice. While returning they encountered a Jewish rabbi, whom they accosted. Flamel showed his book to the labbi, who, having read it, informed him that it contained the veritable rules for making the philoso-"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"90 ALCEEJ^fT. pher's stone, whereupon Flarael offered the Jew to work together as faithful partners. During the time that Flamel, PerncUa and the rabbi were laboring conjointly at alchemical toil, the king issued a mandate that all Jews mast instantaneously' evacuate France, carrying nothing with them, as all their goods had been confiscated. The Jews left their treasures in charge of Flamel, and as they were all massacred, he found himself enriched from their stores. In order not to be disturbed in possession of this sudden wealth, Flamel sagaciously circulated the report as to his discovery of the philosopher's stone. Nevertheless, despite all the mishaps, encoTintered by those who have given themselves up to prosecution of the Great Work, there are alchemists in these modern times. At the present moment there are a number of learned scholars devoted to the practice of alchemy. It is curious to examine the recipes recommended to obtain the philosopher's stone or the powder of perfection. Here we have one of them: \"Take a crucible in which the earth of Saturn can be held at a great heat. Then take a pound of river sand and as much lead. Place them in a crucible, over a strong fire, until they are melted and reduced to earth; then take glass and place it in the aforesaid crucible, and above place a quantity of iron, which cannot be dissolved at a red heat during twelve hours; after which time you will withdraw it and find your glass, which has carried off all coloring matter and the gold which could be iron; after that you pulverize the whole and put it into aqua regia; which charges itself with r.ll the gold ; then you cause this to evaporate, after which take the gold and place it in a crucible for the purpose of melting it.\" Here is another recipe, which is scarcely more clear; \"In the name of God, take a denier of fine gold, three deniers of silver, melt them together, throw in ten deniers of saturne, which is the true mediator, do not keep them long melted, but throw in, as soon as possible, an ingot, which you have placed in subtile filings, then mix with them a philosophic egg, herme- tically sealed, and then consign them to the secret furnace.

ASTBOLOGY. Astrology, posterior as all practices of divination are to magic properly so called, is however the most ancient of the soothsay- ing devices. If historians are to be believed it was invented by the Chal- dean shepherds, who were the original observers of the stars and chroniclers of regularity in celestial phenomena. These shepherds in selecting their stars, in approximating their appearance and occultation to certain circumstances in daily life, were rapidly led to a conclusion that the human body submitted to the influence of the bodies, peopling the firma- ment. However some modern savants have given to astrology a total- ly dififerent origin from this creation popularly assigned to it. In the first ages, say they, men, perceiving that monuments erected to perpetuate memory of events could not resist the rav- ages of time, bestowed upon the stars, sole durable monuments, the names cf heros or of memorable events. Le Clerc, a savant of the twentieth century, has pubblshed in the eighth volume of his \" Uuiversal Library,\" a work by the Cyrean philosopher Erathenes, in which the names of the constellations are explain- ed after the historical facts they commemorate. From Le Clerc's authority, this origin has been assigned to judicial astrology. The populace, philosophers in themselves, concluded in be- lieving the celestial bodies to be inhabited by intelligences, to which they should address their prayers, who likewise presided over human destiny."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"92 ASTBOLOGT. Ancient Greece and Eome believed in astral influences. Cbristiaiaity itself could not uproot this superstition which was perpetuated down to the Eighteenth century. Kings and great lords had their astrologf^rs whom they con- sulted before embarking in any great enterprise, or affair of im- portance. Louis XL attempted nothing without the advice of Mortius Galeotti, a celebrated astrologer, whom he had taken from the court of Matthias Corvin, King of Hungary. It was in accordance with his counsels that to prevent a war between France and Burgundy, he journeyed to Peronne on a visit to the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, his mortal enemy. This latter, happy of having Louis XL within his power, incarcerated him in the citadel at Peronne. Louis XL furious against his astrologer, who had placed him in this perilous situation, caused him, to come to his prison after having notified Tristan the Hermit, excutioner of France, to hang him as he emerged.

ABT 07 MAKING ARTIFICIAL PFcECIOUS STONES, One daj', not long ago, (he jewelers of Paris were in a high state of excitement, and justly so, for the news had reached them from lae Academy of Sciences that two chemists, MM. E. Fremy and Fell, had discovered a process for the manuf.:cturo by the pound of certain kinds of precious stones ranking in value next to the diamond, and frequently commanding still larger prices than the hitter— namely, the ruby, the sapphire, and the most precious of all, the Oriental emerald. At first the Parisian jewelers consoled themselves with the thought that the genuine stones would always be preferred to the artificial ones, but the excitement increased when it became known that 'MIL Fremy and Feil did not propose to imitate precious stones, but that iheir productions would be perfectly equal to the natural"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"ARTIFICIAL PRECIOUS ST0y£3. 97 ones, and taat a watch would run on tlieir artificial rubies as well as on natural ones, becaaso botn of them were equally hard. Nov/ tho dealers in precious stones asserted that it was sinful to imitate ITaturo's work in that manner, and that tho Government ought to prohibit it. On tho other hand, a few cn- ihnsiastio feuiudonistes proclaimed that tho discovery in question foreshadowed a still more important one — that of making gold and diamonds; that the dreams uf tho alchemists were about to be realized, and that poverty and wretchedness would be no more. Of the prospect of poverty and wrt;;chedness coming to an end we say nothing here. As for the transformation of lead and other base metals into gold and silver, we have to declare that this branch of alchemy is something altogether different from the manufacture of precious stones. Most of our modern chem- ists hold metals to be simple, immutable elements, which have ahvays been what they are now, and which may change their form, but never their peculiar nature. Not so with precious stones, most of which, and especially those that are most highly prized, are of very lowly origin indeed. In the eyes of tho chemist the ruby, the sapphire, the topaz, etc., are simply modi- fications of one siibstance (alumina), which, as clay, forms tho greater portion of the earth's crust; and the diamond, which is the prince of all precious stones, is simply pure crystallized carbon, and so allied to charcoal, lampblack, etc. Other highly esteemed precious stones, such as the emerald, the aqua-marina, and chrysoberyl, on the one hand, and the hyacinth, on tho other, contain \"earths\" chemically related to argillaceous earth — name! 3% the former consists of beryl-earth, and the latter of zirconia; but these earths in themselves are neither rare nor precious, so that in some countries the streets are paved with the irapurer brothers of the emerald. The same is true of all other precious stones, including pearls ; in the main they are formed of substances ot no value whatever, and to be found everywhere, such as agillaceous earth, silicic acid, fluor-spar, boracic acid, lime, magnesia, etc, Their only superiority consists in the fact tkat tho common substance in them Las reached an extraordi-"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"98 ARTIFICIAL PRECIOUS STONES. nary degree of crystallization, for, aside from tlieir beauty, their rarily enhances their value in the market. Chemical combinations and simple substances of mineral as well as ot organic nature assume their due crystal shapes, which are so well defined as frequently to bear a strong resemblance to those of cut stones, only when they pass from the liquid into the solid state, and they assume a large size only when this transition takes place very slowl}'. For instance, if we dissolve in hot water as much alum as can be dissolved therein, and sus- pend in the fluid, while allowing it to cool in a quiet place, a wire vessel — a brisket, a rosette, or a crown, wrapped in wool— we shall Gnd next morning that wire vessel covered with glass- like, transparent, more or less large, glittering octahedral crys- tals. Cold water is unable to hold in solution as large a quantity of the salt as warm water; and the surialus, as the tem- perature of the v/ater decreases, has to separate slowly from it. In so doing, small crystals are formed. They grow constantly as the separation goes on, and, if we leave the solution exposed to the fresh air so that it slowly evaporates, we shall at last ob- tain very large crystals. If the alum contained an impure ad- mixture of other salts, they would remain in the water. Ci'ys- tallization, as a general thing, is also a purification ot foreign admixtures. In all probability, in Nature many precious stones have formed in the same manner; and most mineralogists concur in the opinion that rock-crystals, consisting of nothing but silicic acid, and frequently weighing hundreds of pounds, have originated thus. It is almost certain that this formation from liquids into solid bodies has taken place in a large class of half-precioua stones, such as quartz and pyrites, consisting likewise of noth- ing but silica — namely, agate, jasper, opal, chalcedony, chryso- prase, carnelian, heliotrope, and others. At the same meeting of the Parisian Academy where MM. Fremy and Feil described their process of manufacturing arti- ficial rubies and sapphires, M. Monnier stated that he had ob- tained artificial opals by pouring a hiLjlily-dilu ted solution of oxalic acid cautiously upon a solution as thick as molasses cf siliyate of soda, which brings about a slow separation of the sii_"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"ARTIFICIAL PRECIOUS STONES. 99 icic acid. When, in so doing, he used a solution of the sulphate of nickel protoxide, he obtained apple-green stones, such as the chrysoprase. Thus we see that, as long as the process of separation lasts, we may talk of the growth of precious stones ; and we perceive, from the laws of crystallization, how by the attraction of similar parts, and the exclusion of foreign ones, the formation of precious stones of perfectly \"pure water\" among the more impure cneS; which are frequently found, becomes more intelligible. Another process of crystallization is the slow cooling of molten substances. This can be explained very strikingly to students of chemistry if a kettle of sulphur or molten bismuth is cooled slow]}', until it is covered with a crust of congealed matter, so to speak. Pierce that crust in the middle, and pour out a por- tion of the liquid, and there will form on tho walls of the cavity thus created crystals of surpassing beauty, and the whole as- sumes the appearance of a so-called crystal druse, a form often assumed by amethysts and other half-precious stones. It has been thought that, to make artificial diamonds, it was necessary only to melt coal; but, unfortunately, the results thus far ob- tained are of no value. Nature's most successful way of producing precious stones was not to dissolve minerals, but to put them into a fiery liquid con- dition, and to separate tho new productions slowly from their former impure parts by chemical and electric influences, as we shall see directly. The earth, like the sun and most fixed stars at present, was undoubtedly formerly in a fievy, liquid condi- tion. Then the elements were commingled; all substances met, and entered the strangest combinations; the whole globe was an immense chemical laboratory. The earthy substances with the light metals, at tho last period of those gigantic processes, prob- ably formed tho \" mother-liquor,\" from which, under various chemical agencies, there separated now valuable metals, now grains of gold, and still more frequently substances which were ennobled by crystallization. The \" mother-liquor,\" cooled with its productions, we call primitive formations— granite, feldspar, porphyry, etc. It may here be stated that these primitive pro- cesses have rscently been imitated in part, and that two princi-"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"100 ARTIFICIAL PRECIOUS STOI^ES. pal components of feldspar, albite and crthoclase, have lately been obtained from a fiery, liquid mixture of minerals. Precious stones so formed would be colorless if, in the terribla furnace of the primordial world, fire-proof metals had not taken upon themselves the task performed by aniline in our present dying-works. Long before there were colored plants and ani- mals, metals played the parts of pigments in Nature, and thus produced, in stones, colors almost surpassing in brilliancy those to be found in the animal kingdom. Eubiea and emeralds are probably colored with tchrome, sapphires with cobalt, lapis- laiulis with iron, and other precious stones with copper, nickel, manganese, etc. But we only have to ref^r our readers to the magnificent windows of Gothic cathedrals, with their gorgeous colors, produced by combinations of metals in the molten state. The false precious stones made in Paris with so much perfection from heavy strass-glass are colored with metallic oxides in aa lasting a manner as the genuine stones. Tho first precious stono reproduced, not only in its appear- ance, but its real nature, and in all its component parts, is tho lapis-lazuli, the sapphire of tho ancients, not to be confounded with the sapphire of our modern jswelcrs. This ud transparent stone, of a magnificent azure-blue color, was most highly prized by the ancient Hindoos, Assyrians, Persians, Jews, Egj'ptians, Greeks, etc. ; and this irrefragably refutes tho erroneous theory of some archceologists that t!io ancients v/erc unable to distin- guish the blue color. \"When pulverized, this stono furnishes the surpassingly beautiful ultramarine color with w^hich tho ar- tists of the middle ages delighted to paint the mantle or gown of the Virgin Mary, although they had to pay tho most extrava- gant prices lor tho pigment, which they always charged in the bills of those who had ordered a sacred picture from Ihcm. Some fifty or sixty years ago, Gmelin, the German chemist, dis- covered that this most beautiful of blue colors could bo artifici- ally produced by heating argillaceous earth with soda, sulphur, and carbon ; and now that Guimet, the French chemist, has practically introduced this process, Europe manufactures annu- ally about 100,000,000 pounds of this pigment, most of which ia produced in Germany."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"ARTIFICIAL PRECIOUS STOKSS. 101 At a very eaily period cliemists devoted tlieir attention to the artificial reproduction of rubies and sapphires, which, as vr& have said before, consist of nothing but crystallized argillaceous earth, colored by minute particles of metals. Several decades ago, the chemist Gaudin succeeded in obtaining small ruby pellets from pure argillaceous earth, precipitated from dissolved alum and moistened with cbromate of potash. The color ot these rubies, according to the quantity of chromate which they contained, was either tliat of a rose or bordering on purple. The pellets were so hard th.-it they easily cut glass, garnets, and to- pazes; but they were not crystals, and their transparency was by no means periect. Similar experiments were made by th« chemists De Bray, Sainte-Claire Deville, Caron, Senarmont, Ebelmann, and others. It was long aclmowledged that a crys- tallization of argillaceous or berj'l-earth had to be obtained, and to that end it was necessary to reduce them with the requisite quantities of the coloring metallic combinations into a state of fiery liq-aefaction. Boric acid was selected for that purpose, because when heated it slowly evaporates. It appears as vapor in volcanic countries, and is especially obtained in Tuscany. The belief that this liery means of reduction had played in Na- ture a part in the formation of precious stones was perfectly justifiable; and so boric acid was placed in comparatively largo quantities with argillaceous or beryl-earth in open platinum crucibles, which were subjected to a long-continued heat in por- celain furnaces. In fact, as soon as the larger portion of the boric acid has evaporated, there are evolved from the fiery, liquid mass small rubies, sapphires, or emeralds. This was discovered some twenty years ago, but the crystals were too small to make the process a remunerative one. Far more satisfactory were the results of Fremy's recent ex- periments. They are based upon a different principle, namely, that of sex>arating the argillaceous earth slowly from its usi;al combination with silicic acid, as it is found in Nature every- where, by bringing to bear upon it a substance of stronger af- finity for the acid. In consequence, small crystals of argilla- ceous earth are formed in the fiery, liquid \"mother-liquor,\" irhich, in the coarse of further separation, grow slowly. In the"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"102 ARTIFICIAL PBECIOUS STONES. glass-factories of M. Feil, quantities of tliis \" mother-liquor \" of precious stones, weighing from twenty-five to fifty pounds, wero easily kept in a fiery, liquid state for two and three weeks, and in this way very favorable results were obtained. The most ad- vantageous process turned out to be the separation of the argil- laceous earth from the silicic acid by means ot oxide of lead, for which purpose a mixture of equal parts of pure porcelain-clay and red-lead was placed in a large crucible of firt-proof clay and exposed for weeks to rn intense red heat. Usually, the lead also extracts the silicic acid which the walls of the crucible contain, and cats holes through them. Hence, to avoid losses, the precious-stone crucible should be placed m another. After several weeks of patient vv-aiting, vividly recalling tho expectant watching of the old alchemists at their crucibles in which the philosopher's stone was to be created, the crucible is taken out and cooled. After destroying the crucible, the con- tents are found to consist of two strata, above a glassy one, con- sisting principally of silicate of lead, and below a crystalline one, containing the most beautiful crystals of argillaceous earth, in round clusters. If nothing but argillaceous earth and red- lead has been placed in the crucible, these crystals are as color- less as glass. They will cut glass and rock-crystal, nay, even tho very hard topaz; in short, they arc precious corundums or diamond-spar, bo called because, next to the diamond and crystalline boron, it if the hardest of all stones. Now rubies, sapphires, and Oriental emeralds, are nothing but colored corundums, and the former two can bo easily obtained by the addition of the requisite quantities of the coloring metal- lic combinations. \"When there was added to the mixture of ai> gillaceous earth and red-lead two or three per cent, of bichro- mate of potash, the crystals showed the beautiful rose-color of the ruby; when only a small quantity of that salt waa used, and simultaneously a still smaller quantity of oxide of cobalt was added, sapphires were obtained. The i:)recious stones thus pro- duced, as a rule, are covered with a firm crust of silicate of lead, which is best removed chemically by melting it with oxide of lead or potash, or by means of hydrate of fluor-spar. Among a number of pounds of such crystals of argillaceous earth which"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"ARTIFICIAL PRECIOUS ST02ii:S, 103 the inventors submitted to the Academy, there were nu- merous jiieces that could not be distinguished at all from natu- ral rubies and sapphires. They possessed their crystalline shape, their M eigbt, hardness, color, and adamantine lustre, al- though the latter was not altogether faultless. How completely the imitation of Nature has succeeded, may be inferred from a peculiarity which the artificial rubies have in common with the natural ones: both, upon being heated, lose their rose-color, and do not recover it until they are cooled again. The diamond-cutters who were requested to grind these artificial rubies found them not only as hard as the natural ones, but in many instances even harder; they were not long in blunting their best tools made of the hardest steel. For the use of watch-makers they are, perhaps, better than the natural stones. But jewelers, too, are certain, sooner or later, to derive a great deal of benefit from these discoveries. The rubies hitherto ob- tained, although very beautiful, did not equal the first-class natural stones; but they are only the first productions of a new process, and it is decidedly creditable to the inventors that they immediately divulged their method without trying to mystify the public. Now others, too, may follow up this new branch of a promising alchemy. Perhaps more time should be given to the crystals for their formation, for Nature had a great deal of time for such productions, and it was owing to this fact, per- haps, that it achieved such glorious triumphs. There can be no doubt but that, at some future time, these crystals of argilla- ceous earth will be colored also green, yellow, and purple, and that thus the precious stones, which were hitherto distinguished as Oriental emeralds, topazes, and amethysts, from inferior stones of the same name, will be produced. The addition Oriental,\" in this connection, has no geographical meaning, and was ap- plied by jewelers to the harder and better classes of emeralds, topazes, and amethysts. Perhaps these Oriental stones will be cheaper at an early day than the inferior ones, and the middle classes may wear as brilliant stones as piincesses do now."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"lOi MESMERISM, ODYLISM, TABLE-TUENING, AND SPIRITUALISM. The aphorism that \" history repeats itself\" is in no case more true than in regard to the subject on which I am now to address you. For there has been a continuity from the very earliest times of a belief, more or less general, in the existence of *' oc- cult\" agencies, capable of manifesting themselves in the pro- duction of mysterious phenomena, of which ordinary experience does not furnish the ralionale. And while this very continuity is maintained by some to be an evidence of the real existence of such agencies, it will be my purpose to show you that it proves nothing more than the wide-spread dijBfnsion, alike among minds of the highest and of the lowest culture, of certain tendencies to thought, which have either created ideal marvels possessing no foundation whatever in fact, or have by exaggeration and distor- tion invested with a preternatural character occurrences which are perfectly capable of a natural explanation. Thus, to go no further back than the first century of the Christian era, we find the most wonderful narrations, alike in the writings of pagan and Christian historians, of the doings of the Eastern \"sorcer- ers\" and Jewish \"exorcists\" who had spread themselves over the Roman Empire. Among these the Simon Magus slightly men- tioned in the book of Acts was one of the most conspicuous, being recorded to have gained so great a repute for his \"magic arts\" us to have been summoned to Rome by Nero to exhibit them before him ; and a Christian father goes on to tell how, when Simon was borne aloft through the air in a winged chariot in the sight of the emperor, the united prayers of the apostles Peter and Paul, prevailing over the demoniacal agencies that sustained him, brought him precipitately to the ground. Nothing is more common than to hear it asserted that these are subjects which any person of ordinary intelligence can in- vestigate for himself. But the chemist and the physicist would most assuredly demur to any such assumption in regard to a chemical or physical inquiry ; the physiologist and geologist would make the same protest against the judgment of unskilled persMLS in questions of physiology and geology; and a study of"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"MESMERISM, ODTLISM, TABlE-TUltKim, ETC. 105 mesmerism, odylism, and spiritualism, extending over more than forty years, may be thought to justify me in contending that a knowledge of the physiology and pathology of the human mind, of its extraordinary tendency to self-deception in regard to matters in which its feelings are interested, of its liability to place undue confidence in persons having an interest in deceir- ing, and of the modes in which fallacies are best to be detected and frauds exposed, is an indispensable qualification both for the discrimination of the genuine from the false, and for the re- duction of the genuine to its true shape and proportions. It was about the year 1772 that Mesmer, who had previously published a dissertation \" On the Influence of the Planets on the Human Body,\" announced his discovery of a universal fluid, \"the immediate agent of all the phenomena of Nature, in which life originates, and by which it is preserved;\" and asserted that he had farther discovered the power of regulating the opera- tions of this fluid, to guide its currents in healthy channels, and to obliterate by its means the tracks of disease. This power he in the first instance professed to guide by the use ot magnets ; but having quarreled with Father Hell, a Professor of Astron- omy at Vienna, who had furnished him with the magnets with which he made his experiments, and who then claimed the dis- covery of their curative agency, Mesmer went on to assert that he could concentrate the power in and liberate it from any sub- stance he pleased, could charge jars with it (as with electricity) and discharge them at his pleasure, and could cure by its means the most intractable diseases.

The state of French society at that time, as I have al-'"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"106 MESMERISM, ODTLISM, TABLE-TURNING, ETa ready remarked, was peculiarly favorable to his pretensions. A feverisli excitability prevailed, which caused the jjublic mind to be violently agitated by every question which it took up. And Mesmer soon found it advantageous to challenge the learned so- cieties of the capital to enter the lists against him; the storm of opposition which he thus provoked having the effect of bringing over to his side a large number of devoted disciples and ardent partisans. He professed to distribute the magnetic fluid to his congregated patients from a baquet or magnetic tub which he had impregnated with it, each individual holding a rod whic)i i)ro_ ceeded from the baquet ; bat when the case was particularly in- teresting, or likely to be particularly profitable, he took it in hand for personal magnetization. All the surroundings were such as to favor, in the hysterical subjects who constituted the great bulk of his patients, the nervous paroxysm termed the '* cri.=is,\" which was at once recognized by medical men as only a modified form of what is commonly known as an \"hysteric fit the influence of the imitative tendency being manifested as it is in cases where such fits run through a school, nunnery, factory, or revivalist-meeting, in which a number of suitable subjects are collected together. And it was chiefly on account of the moral disorders to which Mesmer's proceedings seemed likely to give rise that the French Government directed a scien- tific commission, including the most eminent savants of the time— such as Lavoisier, Bailly, and Benjamin Franklin — to in- quire into them. After careful investigation they came to the conclusion that there was no evidence whatever of any special agency proceeding from the baquet; for not only were they un- able to detect the passage of any influence from it that was ap- preciable, either by electric, magnetic, or chemical tests, or by the evidence of any of their senses; but, on blindfolding those who seemed to be most susceptible to its supposed influence, all its ordinary effects were produced when they were without any connection with it, but belived that it existed. And so, when in a garden of which certain trees had been magnetized, the patients, either when blindfolded, or when ignorant which trees had been aiagnetized, would be thrown into a convulsive fit if they be- lie ved themselves to be near a magnetized tree, but were really"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"MESMERISM, ODYLISM, TABLE-TURNING, ETC. 107 at a distance from it ; while, conversely, no effect M'oiild follow their close proximity to one of these trees when they believed themselves to be at a distance from any of them. Further, the commissioners reported that, although some cures mij^ht be* wrought by the mesmeric treatment, it was not without danger, since the convulsions excited were often violent and exceed- ingly apt to spread, especially among men feeble in body and weak in mind, and almost universally among women ; and they' dwelt strongly also on the moral dangers which, as their inquir- ies showed, attended these practices. Now, this report, although referring to a form of mesmeric procedure which has long since passed into disrepute, really deals with what I hold to be an important principle of action, which, long vaguely recognized under the term \"imagination,\" now takes a definite rank in physiological science; namely, that in individuals of that excitable nervous temperament which is known as \"hysterical\" (a temperament by no means confined to women, but rare in healthy and vigorous men), the expectation of a certain result is often sufficient to evoke it. Of the influ^ ence of this \"expectancy\" in producing most remarkable changes in the bodily organism, either curative or morbid, the history of the history of medicine affords abundant and varied illustra- tions ; and I shall presently show you that it operates no less remarkably in calling forth movements which, not being con- sciously directed by the person who executes them, have beei/ attributed to hypothetical occult agencies. In the hands of some of his pupils, however, animal magnet- ism, or Mesmerism (as it gradually came to be generally called), assumed an entirely new development. It was discovered by the Marquis de Puysegur, a great landed proprietor, who ap- pears to have practised the art most disinterestedly for the sole benefit of his tenantry and poor neighbors, that a state of pro- found insensibility might be induced by very simple methods in some individuals, and a state akin to somnambulism in others ; and this discovery was taken up and brought into vogue by numerous mesmerizers in France and Germany, while, d'^ir- ing the long Continental war, and for some time aiterward, i*^ remaiaed almost unknown in England.

About twelve years afterward, two amputations were performed in our own country— one in Nottinghamshire, and the other in Leicestershire- -upon mesmerized patients, who showed no other sign of consciousness than an almost inaudible moaning ; both of them exhibiting an uninterrupted placidity of countenance, and declaring, when brought back to their or- dinary state, that they were utterly unaware of what had been done to them during their sleep.

Writing in 1845, Dr. Noble, of Manchester (with whom I was early brought into association by Sir John Forbes in the pursuit of this inquiry), said : \"We have seen a needle thrust deeply under ^e nail of a woman sleeping mesmericallj', without its exciting a quiver; we have seen pungent snuff in large quantities passed up the nos- trils under the same circumstances, without any sneezing being produced until the patient was roused, many minutes after- ward; we have noticed an immunity from all shock when per- cussion-caps have been discharged suddenly and loudly close to the ear; and we have observed a patient's little-linger in the flame of a candle, and yet no indication of pain. In this latter case all idea of there having been courageous dissimulation was removed from our mind in seeing the same patient afterward evince both surprise and indignation at the treatment received; as, from particular circumstances, a substantial inconvenience was to result from the injury to the linger, which was by no means slight.\"* *SrUUh mnd F9r9iffi% MtdUal Stvitw, Jifitil, lUi."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"MESMERISM, 0DTLIS3f, TABLE-TURNING. ETC. 109 This \"mesmeric sleep\" corresponds precisely in character with what is kuown in medicine as *' hj-steric coma;\" the insen-* sibility being as profound, while it lasts, as in the coma of nar- cotic poisoning or pressure on the brain ; but coming on and passing off with such suddenness as to show that it is dependent upon some transient condition of the sensorium, which, with our present knowledge, we can pretty cerfainly assign to a re- duction in the supply of blood caused by a sort of spasmodic contraction of the blood-vessels. That there is no adequate ground for regarding it as otherwise than real, appears further from the discovery made not long afterward by Mr. Braid, a surgeon practising at Manchester, that he could induce it by a very simple method, which is not only even more effective than the \"passes\" of the mesmerizer, bat is, moreover, quite inde- pendent of any other will than that of the person who subjects himself to it. He found that this state (which he designated as hypnotism) could be induced in a large proportion of individu- als of either cex, and of all ranks, ages, and temperaments, who determinately fix their gaze for several minutes consecutively on an object brought so near to their eyes as to require a degree of convergence of their axes that is maintainable only by a strong effort. The first state thus induced is usually one of profound coma- tose sleep; the \"subject\" not being capable of being roused by sensory impressions of any ordinary kind, and bearing without the least indication of consciousness what would ordinarily pro- duce intolerable uneasiness or even severe pain. But, after some little time, this state very commonly passes into one of somnambulism, which again corresponds closely on the one hand with natural, and on the other with mesmeric, somnambu- lism. In fact, it has been by the study of the somnambulism artificially induced by Mr. Braid's process that the essential nature of this condition lias been elucidated, and that a scientific rationale can now be given of a large proportion of the phen. omena reported by mesmerizers as having been presented by their somnambules.

This contention, however, seems to me to rest up- on an entirely incorrect appreciation of the probative force of evidence ; for, as I shall endeavor to prove to you in my suc- ceeding leciure, the only secure basis for our belief on any sub- ject is the confirmation afforded to external testimony by our sense of the inherent probability of the fact testified to; so that, as has been well remarked, \"evidence tendered in support of what is new must correspond in strength with the degree of its incompatibility with doctrines generally admitted as true ; and, where statements obviously contravene all past experience and the universal consent of mankind, any evidence is inadequate to the proof, which is not complete, beyond suspicion, and abso- lutely incapable of being explained away.\" It was asserted, about thirty years ago, by Baron von Reich- enbach, wliose researches on the chemistry of the hydrocarbons constitute the foundation of our present knowledge of paraffin and its allied products of the distillation of coal, that he had found certain \"sensitive\" subjects so peculiarly affected by the neighborhood of magnets or crystals as to justify the assump- tion of a special polar force, which he termed Odyle, allied to, but not identical with, magnetism; present in all material sub- stances, though generally in a less degree than in magnets and crystals; but called into energetic activity b}' an 3' kind of phys- ical or chemical change, and therefore especially abundant in the human body. Of the existence of this odylic force, which he identified with the \"animal magnetism\" of Mesmer, he found what he maintained to be adequate evidence in the i^eculiar sensations and attractions experienced by his \"sensitives\" when in the neighborhood either of magnets or cr3'stals, or of human beings specially charged with it. After a magnet had been re- peatedly drawn ulong the arm of one of these subjects, sha"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"JdESMEEISM, 0DYLIS3I, TABLE-TUENINQ, ETC. Ill would feel a pricking, streaming, or sliooting sensation ; she would smell odors proceeding from it ; or she would see a small volcano of flame issuing from its poles when gazing at them, even in broad daylight. As in the magnetic sleep light is often seen by the somnambule to issue from the operator's fingers, so the odylic light was discerned in the dark by Von Eeichen- bach's \"sensitives,\" issuing not only from the hands, but from the head, eyes, and mouth, of powerful generators of this force. One individual in particular was so peculiarly sensitive, that she saw (in the dark) sparks and flames issuing from ordinary nails and hooks in a wall. It was further affirmed that certain of these \"sensitives\" found their hands so powerfully attracted by magnets or crystals as to be irresistibly drawn toward them ; and thus that if the attracting object were forcibly drawn away, not only the hand, but the wliole body of the \"sensitive\" was dragged after it. Another set of facts was adduced to prove the special relation of odyle to terrestrial magnetism— namely, that many \"sensitives\" cannot sleep in beds which lie across the magnetic meridian; a position at right angles to it being to some quite intolerable. Von Keichenbach's doctrine came before the British publio under the authority of the late Dr. Gregory, the Professor of Chemistry in the University of Edinburgh ; who went so far as to affirm that, \"by a laborious and beautiful investigation, Eeichcnbach had demonstrated the existence of a force, influ- ence, or imponderable fluid — whatever name be given to it — which is distinct from all the known forces, influences, or im- ponderable fluids, such as heat, light, electricity, magnetism, and from the attractions, such as gravitation, or chemical at- traction.\" It at once became apparent, however, to experienced physicians conversant with the proteiform manifestations of that excitable, nervous temperament, of which I have already had to speak, that all these sensations were of the kind which the physiologist terras \"subjective ;\" the state of the sensorium on which they immediately depend being the resultant, not of physical impressions made by external agencies upon the or- gans of sense, but ot cerebral changes connected with the ideas with which the minds of the \"sensitives\" hud come to be \"pos-"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"112 MESMERISM, ODTLISM, TABLE-TURNIXG, ETC, sessed.\" The very fact that no manifestation of the supposed force could be obtained except through a conscious human or- ganism should have been quite sufficient to suggest to any philosophic investigator that he had to do not with a new physi- cal force, but v/ith a peculiar phase ot physical action, by no means unfamiliar to those who had previously studied the influ- ence of the mind upon the body. And the fact which Von Reichenbach himself was honest enough to admit— that when a magnet was poised in a delicate balance, and the hand of a \"sensitive\" was placed above or beneath it, the magnet was never drawn toward the hand— ought to have convinced him that the force which attracted the \"sensitive's\" hand to the mag- net has nothing in common with physical attractions, whose action is invariably reciprocal; but that it was the product of her own conviction that she must thus approximate it. So \"pos- sessed\" was he, however, by his pseudo-scientific conception, that the true significance of this fact entirely escaped him; and although he considered that he had taken adequate precautions to exclude the conversance of any suggestion of which his \"sen- sitives\" should be conscious, he never tried the one test which would have been the experimenlum crucis in regard to all the sup- posed influences of magnets —that of using eleclro-magnels, which could be \"made\" and \"unmade\" by completing or breaking the electric circuit, without any indication being given to the \"sen- sitive\" of this change of its conditions. And the same remark applies to the more recent statement of Lord Lindsay, as to Mr. Home's recognition of the position of a permanent magnet in a totally-darkened room; the value of this solitary fact, tor which there are plenty ot ways of accounting, never having been tested by the use of an electro-magnet, whose active or passive condi- tion should be entirely unknown, not only to Mr. Home, but to every person present. That \"sensitives\" like Von Reichenbach's, in so far as they are not intentional deceivers (which many hysterical subjects are constitutionally prone to be), can feel, see, or smell, anything that they were led to believe that they would feel, see, or smell, was soon proved by the experimental inquiries of Mr. Braid, many of which I myself witnessed. He found that not only in"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"MESMERISM, ODTLISM, TABLETUBKIXG. ETC. 113 bvsterical girls, but in many men and women ''of a highly- concentrative and imaginative turn of mind,\" though otherw'iso in ordinary health, it was sufficient to fix the attention on any particular form of expectonc?/— such as pricldng, streaming, heat, cold, or other feelings, in any part of the body over which a magnet was being drawn ; luminous emanations from the poles of a magnet in the dark, in some cases even in full daylight; or the attraction of a magnet or crystal held within reach of tho hand — for that expectancy to be fully realized. And, conversely, the same sensations were equally produced when the subjects of them were led to believe that the same agency was being em- ployed, although nothing whatever was really done ; the saruo flames being seen when the magnet was concealed by shutting it in a box, or even when it was carried out of the room, without the knowledge of the subject; and the attraction of the magnet for the hand being entirely governed by the idea previously suggested, positive or negative results being thus obtained with either pole, as Mr. Braid might direct. \"I know,\" he says, of one of his subjects, \"that this lady was incapable of trying to deceive myself or others present; but she was self-deceived and spell-bound by the predominance of a preconceived idea, and was not less surprised at the varying powers of the instrument than were others who witnessed the results.\"* One of Mr. Braid's best \"subjects\" was a gentleman residing in Manchester, well known for his high intellectual culture, great general ability, and strict probity. He had cuch a remark- able power of voluntary abstraction as to be able at any time to induce in himself a state akin to profound reverie (correspond- ing to what has been since most inappropriately called the \"biological\"), in which he became so completely \"possessed\" by any idea strongly enforced upon him, that his whole state of feeling and action was dominated by it. Thus it was sufficient for him to place his hand upon the table and fix his attention upon it for half a minute, to be entirely unable to withdraw it, if assured in a determined tone that he could not do so. When his gaze had been steadily directed for a short time to the poles of a magnet, he could be brought to see flames issuing from \"The Power of the Mind over the Body,\" 1846, p. 20,"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"114 MESMERISM, ODTLISM, TABLE-TURXING, ETC them of any form or color that Mr. Braid chose to Dame. And when desired to place his hand upon one of the poles, and to fix his attention for a brief period upon it, the peremptory as- surance that he could not detach it w as sufficient to hold it there with such tenacity that I saw Mr. Braid drag him round the room in a way that reminded me of George Cruikshanlc's amus- ing illustration of the German fairy-story of \"The Golden Goose.\" The attraction was dissolved by Mr. Braid's loud, cheery \"All right, man,\" which brought the subject back to his normal condition, as suddenly as the attraction of a powerful electro-magnet for a heavy mass of iron ceases when the circuit is broken. Now the phenomena of the \"biological\" condition seem to me of peculiar significance, in relation to a large class of those which are claimed as manifestations of a supposed \"spiritual\" agency. When a number of persons of that \"concentrative and imaginative turn of mind\" which predisposes them to the \"bio- logical\" condition sit for a couple of hours (especially if in the dark) with the expectation of some extraordinary occurrence — such as the rising ond floating in the air, either of the human body, or of chairs or tables, without any phj-sical agency ; the crawling of live lobsters over their persons ; the contact of the hands, the sound of the voices, or the visible luminous shapes, of their departed friends— it is perfectly conformable to scien- tific probability that they should pass more or less completely (like Keichenbach's \"sensitives\") into a state which is neither waking nor sleeping, but between the two, in which they see, hear, or feel, by touch, anything they have been led to expect will present itself. And the accordance of their testimony, in regard to such occurrences, is only such as is produced by the community of the dominant idea with v.'hich they are all \" pos- sessed,\" a community of which historj' furnishes any amount of strangely-varied exnmples. And thus it becomes obvious that the testimony of a single cool-headed skeptic, who asserts that nothing extraordinary has reidlj- occurred, should be accepted as more trustworthy than that of any number of believers, who have, as it were, created the sensorial result by their anticipa- tion of it."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"MESMERISM, ODYLISM, TABLE-TURNING, ETC. 115 I have now to show you that the like expectancy can also pro- duce movements of \\arious kinds, through the instrumentality of the nervo-rauscular apparatus, without the least conscious- ness on the part of its subject of his being himself the instru- ment of their performance; a physiological fact which is the key to the whole mystery of table-turning and table-talking. I very well remember the prevalence in my schoolboy days of a belief that, when a ring, a button, or any other small body, suspended by a string over the end of the finger, was brought near the out- side or inside of a glass tumbler, it would strike the hour of the day against its surface; and the experiment certainly succeeded in the hands of several of my schoolfellows, who tried it in all good faith, getting up in the middle of the night to test it, in entire ignorance, as they declared, of the real time. But, as was pointed out by M. Chevreul, who investigated this subject in a truly scientific spirit more than forty years ago, it is impos- sible by any voluntary effort to keep the hand absolutely still for a length of time in the position required; an involuntary tremulousness is always observable in the suspended body, and if the attention be fixed on it with the expectation that its vibra- tions will take a definite direction, they are very likely to do so. But their persistence in that direction is found to last only so long as they are guided by the sight of the operator, at once and entirely losing their constancy if he closes or turns away his eyes. Thus it became obvious that, in the striking of the hour, the influence which determines the number of strokes is really the knowledge or suspicion present to the mind of the operator, which involuntarily and unconsciously directs the action of his muscles; and the same rationale was applied by M. Chevreul to other cases in which this pendule explorateur (the use of which can be traced back to a very remote date), has been appealed to for answers to questions of very diverse character. When, liowever, \"Odyle\" came to the front, and the world of curious but unscientific inquirers was again \"possessed\" by the idea of an unknown and mysterious agency, capable of manifesting itself in an unlimited variety of ways, the pendule exploraieur was brought into vogue, under the name of odometer^ by Dr. Herbert Mayo, who investigated its action with a gr«at"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"116 MESMERISM, ODTLISM, TABLE-TURKING, ETC. show ot scientific precision ; starting, however, with the fore- gone conclusion that its oscillations w ere directed by the hypo- thetical \" odyle,\" and altogether ignoring the mental participa- tion of the operator, whom he supposed to be as passive as a thermometer or a balance. By a series of elaborate experiments, he convinced himself that the direction and extent ot the oscil- lations could be altered, either by a change in the nature of the substances placed beneath the \"odometer,\" or by the contact of the hand of a person of the opposite sex, or even of the experi- menter's other hand, with that from which it was suspended. And he gradually reduced his result to a series of definite laws, which he regarded as having the same constancy as those of physics or chemistry. Unfortunately, however, other experi- menters, who worked out the inquiry with similar perseverance and good faith, arrived at such different results, that it soon came to be obvious that what astronomical observers call the ••personal equation\" of the individual has a very large share in determining them, A very intelligent medical friend of my own, then residing abroad, wrote m'e long letters full of the de- tailed results of his own inquiries, on which he was anxious for my opinion. My reply was simply : \"Shut your eyes, or turn them away, and let some one else watch the oscillations under the conditions you have specified, and record their results ; you will find, if I do not mistake, that they will then show an entire want of the constancy you have hitherto observed.\" His next letter informed me that such proved to be the case; so that he tad come entirely to agree with me as to the dependence of the previous uniformity of his results on his own expectancj'. A very amusing «rpose of the mystery of the •' magnetometer\" resulted from its application by Dr. Madden, an homoeopathic physician at Brighton, to test the virtues of his \" globules,\" as to which he had, of course, some performed conclusions of his own. The results of his first experiments entirely corresponded with his ideas of what they ought to be; for when a globule of one medicine was taken into his disengaged hand, the sus- pended ball oscillated longitudinally ; and when this globule was changed for another of opposite virtues, the direction of the oscillations became transverse. Another homoeopathio physi-"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"MESMERISM, ODYLISM, TABLE-TURNING. ETC. 117 cia,n, however, was going through a similar course of experi- ments; and his results, while comformable to his own notions of the virtues of the globules, were hy no means accordant with those of Dr. Madden, The latter was thus led to reinvestigate the matter with a precaution he had omitted in the first instance; namely, that the globules should be placed in his hand by an- other person, without any hint being given him of their nature. From the moment he began to work upon this plan, the whole aspect of the subject was changed; globules that produced longi- tudinal oscillations at one time gave transverse at another, while globules of the most opposite remedial virtues gave no sign of difference. And thus he was soon led to the conviction, which he avowed with a candor very creditable to him, that the system he had built up had no better foundation than his own anticipa- tion of what tbe results of each experiment should be; that an- ticipation expressing itself unconsciously in involuntary and iraperceiitible movements of his finger, which communicated a rhythmetical vibration to the framework when the oscillations of the ball suspended from it were watched. Thus, by the investigations of scientific experts who were alive to the sources of fallacy which the introduction of the human element ahvays brings into play, the hypothesis of odylic force was proved to be rompletely baseless; the phenomena which were supposed to indicate its existence being traceable to the physiological conditions of the human organisms through whose instrumentality they were manifested. The principle that the state of \" expectant attention \" is capable of giving rise either to sensations or to involuntary movements, according to the nature of the expect;incy, had been previously recognized in phj'siolo- gical science, .md was not invented for the occasion; but the phenomena I have been describing to you are among its most pregnant instances.\" The same principle furnishes what I believe to be the true scientific explanation of the supposed mystery of the divining- rod, often used where water is scarce for the discovery of springs, and in mining-districts for the detection of metallic veins. This rod is a forked twig shaped like the letter Y, hazel being usually preferred; and the diviner walks over the"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"118 MESMERISM, ODYLISM, TABLE- TURKim, ETC. ground to be explored, firmly grasping its two prongs with his hands, in such a position that its stem points forw^ard. After a time the end of the stem points downward, often, it is said, with a sort of writhing or struggling motion, especially when the fork is tightly grasped; and sometimes it even turns backward, so as to point toward instead of away from the body of the diviner. Now, there is a very large body of apparently reliable testimony, that when the ground has been opened in situations thus indicated, either water- springs or metallic veins have been found beneath; and it is quite certain that the existence of such a power is a matter of unquestioning faith on the part of large numbers of intelligent persons who have witnessed what they believe to be its genuine manifestations. This subject, however, was carefully inquired into more than forty years ago by MM. Chevreul and Biot ; and their experimental conclusions anticipated those to which I was myself led in ignorance of them by physiological reasoning. They found that the forked twig cannot be firmly grasped for a quarter of an hour or more in the regulation position, without the induction of a state of muscular tension, which at lasts dis- charges itself in movement ; and this acts on the prongs of the fork in such a manner as to cause its stem to point, either up- ward, downward, or to one side. The occasion of this discharge and the direction of the movement are greatly influenced, like the oscillations of bodies suspended from the finger, by expect- ancy on the part of the operator ; so that if he has any suspicion or surmise as to the \"whereabouts\" of the object of his search, an involuntary and unconscious action of his muscles causes the point of the rod to dip over it. Again, since not one individual in forty, in the localities in which the virtues of the divining-rod are still held as an article of faith, is found to obtain any results from its use, it becomes obvious that its movements must be due, not to any physical agency directly affecting the rod, but to some influence exerted through its holder. And that this influence is his expectation of the result may, I think, be pretty confidently affirmed. For it has been clearly sLown, by careful and repeated experiments, that, while the rod dips when the \" diviner \" knows or believ«a"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"MESMERISM ODYLISM, TABLE-TURNING. ETC 119 he is over a water-spring or a metallic vein, the results are un - certain, contradictory, or simply negative, when he is blind- folded, so as not to be aware precisely where he is. The follow- ing is a striking case of this kind that has been lately brought to my knowledge: \" A friend of mine,\" says Dr. Beard,* \" an aged clergyman, of thorough integrity and fairness, has for many years— the larger part of his natural life, I believe — enjoyed the reputation of being especially skilled in the finding of places to dig wells, by means of a divining-rod of witch-hazel, or the fresh branches of apple or other trees. His fame has spread far, and the accounts that are given by him and of him are, to those who think human testimony is worth anything, overwhelmingly convincing. He consented to allow me to experiment with him. I found that only a few momenta were required to prove that his fancied gift was a delusion, and could be explained wholly by unconscious muscular motion, the result of expectancy and coincidence. In his own j^ard there was known to be a stream of water running through a small pipe a few feet below the surface. Marching over and near this, the rod continually pointed strongly down- ward, and several times turned clear over. These places I marked, blindfolded him, marched him about until he knew not where he was, and took him over the same ground over and over again; and, although the rod went down a number of times, U did not once point to or near the places previously indicated. I very well remember having heard, some thirty-five years ago, from Mr. Dilke (the grandfather of-the present Sir Charles), of an experiment of this kind which he had himself made upon a young Portuguese, who had come to him with a letter ot in- troduction, describing the bearer of it as possessing a most re- markable power of finding, by means of the divining-rod, metals concealed from view. Mr. Dilke's family being at a summer residence in the country, his plate had all been sent to his chamber.\" in the Adelphi, where he was visited by the Portu- guese youth; to whom he said, \"Go about the room with your rod, and try if you can find any mass of metal.\" The youth did so; and his rod dipped over a large standing desk, in which Mr. Dilke's plate had been temporarily lodged. Seeing, how- ever, that there were circumstances which might reasonably sug- gest this guess, Mr. Dilke asked the youth if he was willing to * Eevieio of Modicine and Pharmacy (New York), September, 1875."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"1-20 MESMERISM, ODTLISM, TABLE- TVBmm, ETC nllow his divining power to be tested under conditions which should exclude all such suggestion ; and, having received a ready assent, he took his measures accordingly. Taking his plate-box down to his country residence, he secretly buried it just beneath the soil in a ncAvly-ploughed field; selecting a spot which he could identify by cross-bearings of conspicuous trees, and getting a plough drawn again over its surface, so as to make this correspond precisely with that of the rest of the field. The young diviner was then summoned from London, and chal- lenged to find beneath the soil of this field the very same i)late which he h^d previously detected in Mr. Dilke's desk at the Adelphi ; but, having nothing whatever to guide him even to a guess, he was completely at fault. Mr. Dilke's impression was that he was not an impostor, but a sincere believer in his own power, as the \" dowsers\" of mining-districts seem unquestion- ably to be. The test of blindfolding the diviner, and then leading him about in different directions, so as to put him com- pletely at fault in regard to his locality, is ono that can be very readil}'' applied, when the diviner is acting in good faith ; but, as I shall show you in the next lecture, it requires very special precautions to blindfold a person who is determined to see ; and, in some of the cases which seem to have stood this test, it seems not improbable that vision was not altogether pre- cluded. An additional reason for attributing the action of the divin- ing-rcd to the muscular movements called forth by a state of expectancy (perhaps not always consciously entertained) on the part of the performer seems to me to be furnished by the di- versity of the powers that have been attributed to it ; such as that of identifying murderers and indicating the direction of their flight, discovering the lost boundaries of lands, detecting the birthplace and parentage of foundlings, etc. The older writers do not in the least call in question the reality of the pow- ers of the hazel-fork, but learnedly discuss whether they are due to natural or to diabolic agency. \"When in the last century the phenomena of electricity and magnetism became objects of scientific study, but had not yet been comprehended under the grasp of law, it was natural that those of the divining-rod"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"MESMERISM, ODYLISM, TABLE-TUB NINO, ETC. 121 should be referred to agencies so convenient, which seemed ready to account for anything otherwise unaccountable, But, eince physicists and physiologists have come to agree that the moving power is furnished by nothing else than the muscles of the diviner, the only question th:;t remains is, What calls forth its exercise? And the conclusive evidence I have given you that the definite oscillations of suspended bodies depend on invol- untary movements unconsciously determined by states of expect- ancy, clearly points to the conclusion that we have in the sup- posed mystery of the divining-rod only another case of the same kind. It is well known that persons who are conversant with the geological structure of a distiict are often able to indicate with considerable certainty in what spot, and at what depth, water will be found; and men of less scientific knowledge, but of considerable practical experience, frequently arrive at a true conclusion on this point, without being able to assign reasons for their opinions. Exactly the same maybe said in regard to the mineral structure of a mining-district ; the course of a metallic vein being often correctly indicated by the shrewd guess of an observant workman, where the scientific re- asoning of the mining-engineer altogether fails. It is an experience we are continually encountering in other walks of life, that particular persons are guided, some apparently by an original and others by an acquired intuition, to conclusions for which they can give no adequate reasons, but which subsequent events prove to have been correct; and I look upon the divining- rod in its various applications as only a peculiar method of giving expression to results worked out by an automatic process of this kind, even before they rise to distinct mental consciousness. Various other methods of divination that seem to be practised in perfectly good faith — such, for example, as the Bible and key test, used for the discovery of stolen property— are probably to be attributed to the same agency ; the cerebral traces of past oc- curences supplying materials for the automatic evolution of a result (as they unquestionably do in dreams) when the occur- ences themselves have been forgotten. Many of the cases of so-called thought-reading are clearly of th« same kind; the communication being made by unconscious"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"122 mCElPT FOB SUMMONING SPIRITS, muscular action on the part of one person, and automatically interpreted by tlie other— as in the following instance: Several persons being assembled, one of them leaves the room, and during his absence some object is hidden.

He walks about the room between the two, and generally succeeds before long in finding the hidden object; being led toward it (as careful ob- servation and experiment have fully proved) by the involuntary muscular action of his unconscious guides, one or the other of them pressing more heavily when the object is on his side, And the finder as involuntarily turning toward that side. These and other curious results of recent inquiry, while strictly comformable to physiological principles, greatly extend our knowledge of the modes in which states of mind express themselves unconsciously and involuntarily in muscular action; and I dwell on them the more because they seem to me to afford the key (as I shall explain in my next lecture) to some of these phenomena of spiritualistic divination, which have been most perplexing to many who have come in contact with them, with- out being disposed to accept the spiritualistic interpretation of them.

It is not unreasonable to suppose that the divine honors paid to heathen gods were originally con- ferred on men of high renown and fame, for being possessed of unusual magnetic powers, such powers being symbolized by num- erous additional arms and hands. It was supposed that the Cadit- ceus of Mercury possessed the power of putting any one whom it touched to sleep. He used it to deepen the slumbers of Argus, after having lulled him to sleep with the music of his lyre. A pas- sage in Piautus makes him say of Sosia, \" What if I stroke him gently with the hand, so as to put him to sleep.\" This goes to show that the use of the \" Caducevs \" was sometimes dispensed with in the operation of inducing sleep. The priests of Egypt made the knowledge of the secret, the last and holiest rite of their ancient magic, in the initiation of their candidates, and they made great use of fascination in the cure of diseases. The well-known record in the Scriptures, where the psalmist David, in his old age, had his days lengthened out, by deriving a fresh supply of life from the physical and ner^'ous system of the young damsel who was com- manded to share his couch, is an instance of the operation of a natural law which is often ridiculed at the present day.

It used to be a practice among the natives of some of the Pacific Islands, to relieve weariness and exhaustion by pat- ting the tired one, a process which resulted in a complete restora- tion of physical energ}'. Even the gestures and motions, incanta- tions and mummeries of an Indian \"pow-wow,\" are intimately de- pendent on the efficacy of magnetism for the desired result — aided, no doubt, by the excited imagination of the patient operated upon. St. Gregory, Bishop of Tours, tells us of the efficacy of pilgrimages to the tombs of saints. He says : \" Any person filled with faith, coming near the tombs and praying will be speedily cured of whatever illness may befall them. Some affirm that the saints appear to them in the night, during their dreams, and reveal the proper remedies. \" Protogene, St. Martin, St. Fortunatus, and many others, give similar testimony. Fabricius, in speaking of the practice of the country people, who went to the Church of St. Anthony, of Padua, for the purpose of obtaining salutary visions during their sleep, says: \"This exactly resembles the ancient pagan worship ; and, in truth, even at the present day, the churches of the saints are resorted to, to receive the same kind of revela- tions for curing diseases.\" The Queen of Navarre, while l3'ing at Metz, at the point of death, described the battle of Jarnac in every minute particular; told of her sons victory; the death of the Prince of Conde, and the enemy's flight; all of which was soon afterwards confirmed. This instance of clairvoyant vision is as well attested as that of Emanuel Swedenborg, who saw a city burning, while eighty miles distant, and described the progress of the fire to the surrounding by-standers. Cardanus, in 1501, per- formed man}' great cures by fascination. He could go into the state at will and could wake when he chose, and while in the state cured himself of slight attacks of the gout, prescribed reme- dies, saw objects at a great distance, and foretold future events with correctness. For all this he was imprisoned as a sorcerer at Bologna, though he only claimed that nature had endowed him thus strangely. In 1679, William Maxwell, an Englishman, laid down propositions similar to those afterwards promulgated by Mesmer. In the seventeenth century, there appeared in England a Dr. Streper Levret, an Irish gentleman, and also Valentine"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"THE PRACTICAL CLAIRVOYANT. Greatrakes, who professed to cure diseases by stroking with the hands. Greatrakes, who was a very pious man, felt impressed, he said, to lay hands on cases of ague, and afterwards to treat all kinds of diseases. \" I laid hands on all that came,\" said he, \"and many were cured and some were not.\" The Eoyal Society exam- ined into the mystery and accounted for the phenomena by sup- posing that there existed a \"Sanative Contagion in Mr. Great- rake's body, which had an antipathy to some particular diseases and not to others.\" Truly a sage conclusion. The science was first made widely manifest in Europe, about the close of our Revo- lutionary War by Dr. Anton Mesmer, and though he was by no means the first who applied it to the cure of disease, yet to him is undoubtedly due the credit of its revival, and hence it is usually called mesmerism, in his honor. Mesmer was born in 1734, at Mers- burg, on the shores of Lake Constance, and died in 1815. When 42 years old, he took the degree of doctor of medicine in the Uni- versity of Vienna. It is said that the Professor of Astronomy at Vienna had invented a peculiar form of magnetized steel plates which he applied successfully to the cure of diseases. Mesmer obtained these magnets from the astronomer and applied them in his own way, and soon found out that the efficacy was not in the form of the plates, but in the manipulations ; that the peculiar mode of using them to insure success was in making passes, as they are now called. A quarrel sprung up, and the final result was that Mesmer was obliged to leave Vienna, and in 1778, he arrived at Paris, whither his popularity preceded him. So great became his success, that the French Government took up the matter and of- fered him a large annual income, if he would unfold his secret. This proposition Mesmer rejected, though he sold the secret to in- dividuals, requiring them to pledge themselves not to reveal his instructions. After many vicissitudes, the sum of £14,000 was raised by his disciples, whom he had instructed, but whom he did not consider entitled to practice it publicly. Mesmer used a box filled with iron filings and pounded glass. A cord was passed around the bodies of the subjects, connecting them with one another, a piano-forte was used, and a rod of iron was held by the magnetizer while making the passes. Some of the patients M^ere tranquil ; some were affected by coughing and spitting ; others were troubled with slight pains, universal heats and perspiration ;"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"128 INTRODUCTORY. others were terribly agitated and tortured with convulsions. Some of these convulsions were extraordinary in number, duration, and severity, and were often accompanied with spasms of the throat and wandering motions of the eyes, to which were added, piercing shrieks, weeping, immoderate laughter and hiccough. In view of these absurd preparations and unnecessary manifestations, it is hardly to be wondered that the Committee of Investigation ap- pointed by the French Academy of Science and Medicine, reported in language lilie this : \"In conclusion, as most of the patients were of a nervous temperament, we have thought that the whole thing may be explained by referring the whole matter to the power of the imagination, as this power has no limit.\" This conclusion, however satisfactory to themselves, was like \"jumping out of the frying-pan into the fire.\" One of Mesmer's pupils, the Marquis De Puyseger, retired to his estate in the country, to heal the sick, and there he made the discovery of \"Clairvoyance.\" Up to this time all the operators had used steel rods, according to Mesmer's instructions. When the clairvoyant was asked where the magne- tizing influence came from, he replied: \" From your hands, from your eyes, from all parts of your bodies.\" He was then asked, what was the use of the metallic rods. \" They are of no use at all ;\" so they were discarded. About the year 1810, a Yankee from Con- necticut, named Perkins, probably following the idea suggested by galvanism, made a forked instrument from diiTerent metals, and called it a \" Tractor.\" This was passed over portions of the hu- man body affected by disease, and in a great many cases the opera- tion was followed by relief. He went over to England and se- cured the introduction of his \"Tractors\" in the hospitals, and the '* Friends\" built an establishment in London, for the gratuitious use of them for the afflicted. After a while, a Dr. Haygarth made an imitation \"Tractor\" of wood, and cured a rheumatic patient with its use, and then he proclaimed that the whole matter was the result of imagination, and every body believed him. However, there was no denying the fact that cures were effected, which set thinking men to work at experimenting, and as one theory after another was exploded, fact was added to fact, and the truth of the science was gradually brought to light, through patience and per- severance."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"THE PEACTICAL CLAIRVOYANT. 127 \" Natare hears bat one kind of questions— they are experiments.

In presenting this little work to the public we feel that we arc supplying a wjint tliat lias been lung felt by those who have niade a study of the subject of Animal Mag- netism, or Mesmerism, as it is commonly called. Hereto- fore it has been necessary to buy a groat deal of b )ok in order to get a small amount of practical infortnatiou on the subject under consideration, and it is to obviate this diflSculty that this work has been written and sent forth on its mission. We will first direct our attention to those individuals who have no faith in Mesmerism, and believe it all a hum- bug because so unreasonable. Dear friends, will yru be so kind as to explain how it is that electricity, one of the most subtile elements in nature, is capable of producing such stupendous results ? It dashes tlie tall oak to splint- ers here, fires a house there, destroys life, both vegetable and animal, and yet man has bridled it, and has made it the world's messenger. You know these things arc true, for you have seen and heard ; but can you explain the why and wherefore ? Until you can, do not denounce what thousands upon thousands have seen and felt and do testify to. Permit us to cull your attention to a few familiar facts which have a direct bearing on our subject, that you may try your skill in explaining every-day mys- teries. To begin wiih : It is a well established fact that serpents possess the ability to charm birds by using some mysterious power to fascinate them and cause tliem to become the victims of the charmer. Many a person whose integrity cannot be questioned, has testified to this strange fact. Cats possess"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"128 THE PRACTICAL CLAIRVOYANT. llie same power as serpents, though perhaps in a less dcfrree. Wo know of one niosmerizer who so cliarmed a bird that he w:is enabled lo catcli it, tiioiig'h it was a work lasting three hours. Another operator so completely magnetized a cat tliat it was in vain that its niisirOv-s called it; it heeded not, fur it was in the power of the operator, who, by the way, was a stranorer to the family. There is a method of stopping the flow of blood, which is nmch practiced tlirouj;hotit the land, which consists in the re- peating of tlie bleed ng person's name in connection with a certain verse in the book of Ezekiel. This is done several limes, and, as a general rule, ti»e bleeding soon ceases. Knowitig that the principle of mesmerism was the secret of the whole matter, we have frequently stopped bleeding of the nose by simply fixing our minds on the afflicted one and willing resolutely for the bleeding to stop. One of our pupils, who had taken lessons in mag- netism from us, was enabled to stop a serious bleeding resuliing from a cut received by his brother, by willing it to slop, according to the instructions we had given him. Another mysterious matter we will speak about is what is denominated \"Mind Reading\" — a subject which has attracted considerable attention in the newspapers of late. It is performed in this way : The operator, or medium, is blindtolded, while some other person in the room secretes some object — a knife, ribbon, or handkerchief* Then the mediun) takes the hand of the person who hid the object, and presses it against his (the medium's) forehead, keep- ing it there. The one who hid the object must keep his mind fixed firmly on the secreted article, and resolve men- tally to go towards it, ^et at the same time making not the least muscular movement that would indicate tiie direction of his thoughts. The medium will feel an indescribable \" drawing\" sensation f om the hand he holds against his forehead, and by following the indications of the \" draw- ing\"\" he will be enabled to lead the owner of the hand"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"THE PBACTICAL CLAIBVOYANT. 12V direcfly to llio object.

Seemingly on'y a \" heai t-i-haped\" piece of wood, with only iwo legs, the third being formed by a sharpened lead pencil. Planchette at work.

Great care must be taken not to influence the motion of th-j \" plancliettu\" in the least by any muscular action of the fingers.

Sometimes, if several will place their fingers on it at once, it will move readily for them, although it relusea to make any motion lor any of ihem 6ini>ly. M my persons have received wonderfnl revelations from the liitle tripod. We have known it to write out answers in accordance with the mental dictation of a by- stander. The operators, who were asking the questions, were much chagrined at the apparently irrelevant answers, but were compelled to acknf)wle'l^e the joke when the by- slander explained how he. had brought his will power to bear in making \" planchette\" answer as he desired. We wdl leave this phase of magnetic phenomena and return to everyday matters ngiin. The power of the human eye over the brute creation is undoubtedly the re- sult, in part at least, of a mesmeric influence. You can h irdiy get a dog to look you in the eye for more than a few seconds, if you fix your gaze st'^adfastly in return. If you are in danger of being bitten by a dog at any time, keep cool if 3^>ii can, and look resolnt»*ly in the eyes of tlie brute, and bring all your powers of concentration to bear in willing him to keep away from 3'ou. M my dogs will turn away and walk off on being treated tliiis, but. nov7 and then yon will come across a cur who is only Mibject to the intluence while your eye^ arc (ixed upon him ; tne mo- ment the gaze is withdrawn the brute is ready to advance again.

It is of the .areatest impo* tance that the moRmcvizin|i^ opera'or shou'd be a heahiiy person, ])os-cssing\" \"a sound mind in a honnd body.\" This is vrry cs.-entiiii, from the fact that the nervous flu d which passes I'lom the system of the operator into that <f the snbj ct niesmen'zcd Bhould be derived from a healthy somce, lest the snbj- ct be injured by tlic reception of a diseased nervuus Ihi d ; nlso for another reason, tiiat if the (tperator is in p« or health he weakens iiis own s\\stfm still more by ma;^net- izin;^ during a time ot phys'c d indisi osition.

The i)re8enee of a confidential friend of tlie subject on all occasions is a preliminary that the mesmerist siiould never negb ct. Not only is his own character and that of his subject involved, on account of real or supposed possibil- ity of abuse of power, but the credit of a science having m;«ny able and bitter enemies is at stake, and, therefore, this precaution against plausible misrepresentation should on no account be ovei looked ; and, further, the njind of the subject is more compl. tely lesigned where a friend is at hand.

Take any per- son by tlie hand in the presence of one other person, or bef )re a hundred, placinuf the ball of your thumb on tiic back of his hand an inch above th(i knuckle of tho ring finger, between it and the wrist.

Then tell him to « lose liis eyes, and when he has done so, press the eyelids down gently wi h your finders, usin;;- the hand whi< h is fn c. Now place this hand on the top of his head, letting the"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"1^ THE PRACTICAL CLAIUVOTANT. thumb rest on lii.s foreliead* just aliovc llic nose, bearings partially downwards, slill Kccpinp^ 3'onr other tliumb on llio ULNAR NERVK.

If you can hold your sul jeet's eyes closed by ihc modes just mentioned, or if yon can contnd Ihe action of the lids to a considerable extent, ihen tell him lo clasp his liands togother t ghtly on his head or across his knee, and then say, \" You can't separate thenj.\" To the inlinite sur- prise of almost everybody, he will be able to do so only wiih f^rcat difficulty, or hot at all. Let him he seat( d, and taking hold of the chair, firmly say, \" You can't rise.\" He will remain seated in spile of all his efforts. Give him a stick to lioldand you can prevent him from letting it fall, though he may strive his best to do so. You can prevent his walk- ing ii single step. Yon can arrest h s voice in the middle of a sentence, and he will vainly strive for utterance. In short, yon can control his muscular efforts in any way you desire, by simply speaking your commands in a resolute tone, and keeping your mind firmly on the work. Care must be taken not to let the subject injure himself by over- exertions. AYc once caused a subj<!Ct to strain his back, while trying to lilt a single chair, which, light as it was, he could not move an inch. Freqn(3ntly you will succeed better by making a few passes ovt r the arms, hands, or fingers, before giving a command, observing to make the slr»»ke in the direcnon of the extremities. You may not be able to control the subjf'ct to any gi eater extent than already described ; but if he is very imprrssible you can do much more, which we will speak of hereafter.

Let each subjc.'ct hold the coin about a foot from liis cyi-a, and fix his gMze on it, wi.h his mind per- fectly passive and withdrawn as mucii as possible from all external surroundings. During the twenty or t!iirty min- utes occupi d, the spectators must be as silmt as the gi ave, and the eyes of e;ich subject rive ed on his coin, and his muscles as motion'ess as a statue. The result will be more I'avoiable if you keep your mind on the entire class of subjects, and still better if you occasiona'ly make passes over them, though you may safely withdraw your mir.d from them and direct your attention to keeping the audience as quiet as possible. When the half-hour has ex- pired, attend to the subjects, one at a tinjo, and take the communication throu;^h the ulnar or median nerve, as already .shown, and you can experiment wiih all those whoso eyes you succeed in closing. Qu'te likely yon will find one or two who have passe i into the mesmeric slum- ber b(,'fore the sitting is ended, especially if y«m have in- structed every one not to res st the drojping of their eye- lids and the drowsy feeling while gazing at the coins.

ThOvSe whom you cannot influence to any degree, you will pass by, re ainiiig only the most itnpressible to experiment with. Only be sure to throw off the influeiice from every one who holds a coin, and be sure that you do not forget to do so belore the entertainment is brought to a close.

DANGERS TO BE AVOIDED. We now c^^mc to speak of the dangei s of animal maof* ncti>rn, boili imaginary ;ind real. The lirst tlioui^lit wliich enters Ihc minds ot* a majority of persons, \\vli< n tli' y arc n)ado to realize the trutli of mcsmedsn), is, that it may become an a.i;cnt of great power for cvd in iha bands of bad njcn. But it is a fact, wiiii li all observing inesmerists have noticed, that the moral liicnlties pi ty important pait in the sncccssfnl cxereise of the ma^Mietic power. Wo r<dy on the word of eminent wiiters on the subject, and also tlie testimony <.f nnmeions operatoi-s, that wlien m<^n n»ake a l'a<l nsi; of tl)o power lliey possess magnetically, they finally loose ihat power eniiiely. Cases of this kind arc on record ; and further, that wh'Mi once the power is lost, it is lost forever. The same law governs the mental man that governs the pliysical man ; as the abnse of the funetions of a physical or<!aii n-snits in the loss of the fnnciion, so the abuse of a mentil p.iwer, like mesmerism, resjilis in its 1 )ss. TluMcforo we would say to those un- prinC'! led villains who study this bo.>k f <r an evil purpose, yon will not oidy lose a mystcnions power, l^estowed lor good pnrposos, but yon will be thwarted in another way whieh we will now mak() known. Many things may be nccoraplisi.ed in i he w >y of exp rimcnts w'lieh could not be Inought about by lh<^ < pi raior if he were in earnest. The mind of the Kubj(3et feels that the op.-rator is not n ally meaning to lead him into harai, and In^ governs hims- lf accordingly. But the m- ment an operator is influenced by byd m dives he 1 ses Control of his subject, and the sub- j( ct will resist him both mentally . ai.d p!iy>ically.

If a person be moral before being mesmerized, he w ll be donl)ly so in tlie mngn' tic state, and also stronger phys- ieull\\ ; and in case lie sees fit, ulide magniMized, to resist the operator, he becomes almost as dangerous as an en- raged lunaiic. But all such attempts as the one just refeired to may be baffled by taking the precaution to have at least one friend of the subjeet pri^ssnt during the sitting. 'Ihis should never be neglected. Let u-; suppose that mesmerism could be used lor infamous purpose-^, as many will sli 1 contend who are opposed to ir. That would make it a prime necessity for every intelligent man and woman to become; practically acquainted wiili its phe- nomena, in order that they might be able to guard them- selves and tlieir friends, if mesmerism is dan^-erous, how great the need to comprehend the danger, and to l)e able to delect it under all circumstainrcs. The oltener a person allows himself to be mesmerized, the more easily and readily he enters the state. Such persons sometimes be- come feai ful 1( St. they may be thrown into the state una- wares, while other persoiis who have never been subj' cted, ofjen entertain fears of like character. If a person who is easily subjected wishes to ward otT tiie influ( nee of any one whom he has reason to believe is trying to magnetize him, let him join the tips of his ihumbs and fingers, and at the same time resist mentally, lie \\vi 1 b(.» still more suc- cessful in resisting the influence if he grasps his hands together so as to unite the median nerves of his two palms, and resist menially also. This method forms a circl(3 within one's own syslem, gu irded at all points, like the military hoUww squ ire of ''Guard against Cavalry.''^ But the best plan of all is for the susceptible subject to be- come deeply mesmerized, and while in the state let the operator speak to him in regard to his fears, etc.: \" Now do you wish for the abili y to resist the influence, that you may not become mesmerized in the least agaiubt your"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"THE PBACnCAL CLAIRTOTANT. 151 will?\" \" Yes, of contsc,\" snys the Riil joct, or perhaps ho may simply iMd. \"Well,\" continues ihe operator, *' resolve firmly in your mind that yon siiall not, at any future time, be snbjccied contrary t ) your wishes/' *'Alake a strong determinaticn to be at all times free from the nK^smcric influence except at such times as you are perfectly willinii^.\" The snlject wiil he seen to piess his lips together in a very dccid' d manner, and the oper;it(»r sh«.nl<l continue his advice, telling liim that by firm resolntion he will he able at all times to resist. Whei» tlie subject is wakened he will find himself able lo ward off all inflnences, if he choosovs to do so. This depends uf)on one of the principles of nicsmerism, that impress ons made on the mind of the puhjoct whih; in the sleep are retained after ho is awakent d. This should lead tHe operators to be a little careful j«bout the mental impressions they make on t eir subjects, lest unpleasant consequences lollow. A very com:n<>n etror, into which m;»ny fall, is that of a good snbject submit ing himself to many operators in the conrse of a short time. When an excellent snbject is found, he is often retjuired to sit for this < peralor, then in a few honrs to sit for that one, at the rate of a dozen or more operators in the space of a week, or less. This is very injurious to the nervous sys- tem of the subject, since it is impossible to throw off all the nervous fluid that an operator has imparted, and a little nervous fluid from each of a dozf^i ditl'erent individuals is not calculated to benefit a snbject, by any nieans. It is bi'St for a snbject to confine himself to one operator, and to allow no change until several days have intervened. There seems to be a difference in the efficiency of different opera- tors with regard to the same subject, whi< h indicates a difference in the quality of the nervous fluid. Subjects should not submit themselves to operators of immoral char- acter, or of impure physical hab.ts, as the nervous fluid from bad persons is an undesirable po.-sessioji. The sub- i'ect who is fjequently mesnjerized by a niesmeristof poor lealth may find himself loaded with the operator's disease ;"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"THE PBACnCAL CLAIRVOtAlCT. wliile, on the otlier liand, the operator will find his own Bystcrn improving\" at ihc expense of the unwise subject. The h:i(\\ ollects of lettin.s;' children sleep wiJi the old and inlirm is an example of like chai actor. Do not impress it on tlie mind of a magnetized subject that you cannot awaken him, or else you may lind tiiut you will not. be able to briti;^ him out of tlie si ate ; as liie subject will then contiol liimseU\", and will not wake till he gets ready. S.)inetiines you will be truuMed a Utile by the influence of the minds of the bystanders, who have, ignor.intly or o her- wise, put tl'emsclves iu communie:ition with the subject l>y handling him too freely or by fixing their gaze and atten- tion upon him loo intently. A few words to the snbjfct, instructing him to obey you alone, and to ward off ou side interference, will set matters right again. Attempt no dangerous experiments with a siibjoet. Remember that the impressions m:ide on his mind are seemingly real to him, and the shock or scare y(n\\ may produce will be likely to cling to him when awakened. We once caused a subject to weep over what he supposed to be the dead body of his father; and then, as the audience were seriously affected, we brout^ht him into a natural state and dismissed (he asfecmbly. But the young man who was the subject, told us jifierward, tliat the saddening influences affjcted him considerably tlie next day. Jr^o, you see, one cannot be too cautious. Let all changes be gradual, and let the last cx- perim nt be of a cheer! ul natuie. Av'oid drunkards, for though they are generally subjected with ease, they are hard to w.iken, and are likely to deceive you by making you believe that they are iKJt in the least unde-r the influ- ence, when, in reality, they are completely mesnierized. We would advise you to steer clear of tliose who may have a predisposiiion to insanit3', or who may be subject to organic disease of the heart. It is best to be on the safe side when you mesuierize Ibr the purpose of try ng experi- ments.

We have known more than one person bronjrht out of a revival \"trance\" in this way. More tlian that, we have seen a number of persons thrown into the psychological state (like that in tlie coin experinu ni, descril^ed in chapter four), and a few into a \"trance\" state, l-y the efforts of the preacher in charge, who did not sciuple t > use mesmeric passes until we detected him and exposed his practice to the cliurch, when th(i wonders ceased, and the people's eyes were opened. We do not mention these tilings to scoff at religion, nor to ridicule any demoustiational practice, but to put well meaning peop'e on their guard, that they m ly not have mere m -wiie.ic phenomena palmed off on them as being a high order of religious experience."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"THE PRACTICAL CLAIRVOYANT. CHAPTER SIXTH. MEDICAL USE OF MESMERISM. We propose to give a few directions in regard to the use of mesmerism in curing diseases of the simph-r sort. Serious cases of disease should be treated mesmerically only by operators who arc tliorough'y {icquainted with the human system and its ailments, or wlio act under the ad- vice of a physician who is well informed on the subject of animal magnetism. It is generally best to begin as though YOU were g(Mng to mesmerize your patient, and should ho become purti.tlly mr.gneiized, or even pass completely into the state, it will do no harm wliatever. You cmnot be too careful in making the pusses when mesmerizing for disease, as there is danger of throwing the patient's disease upon your own system. Throw your Iiands away ftoin your body — not towards it — at th-; completion of each pass. Some cperatois wash their hands Ireely in cold water when they hive done ti eating a sick person. A great many operators declare they feel sympathetic sympioms in their own bodies not unlike the pains of the patient whom they are magnetizing. Such diseases an nervous lie.idache, nenralg a, toothache, earache, rlieumat'sm, and local inflammation, are easily subdued in the manner here- afier desciibed. But one must exercise some common sense, r»r els(} he will throw away his strength and accom- plish but 1 ttltj good. For instance, it would bo out of the qu' Stion to cure a sick-headache which was the result of indigestion in an ovei loaded stomach. So long as the caus'j of a disease is not removed tlie resulting pains can- not be more than temporardy iclieved. Where t'le disease i > pro liKjed by a disarrangement of the nervous system, mesmerism wdl prove a swift and 8urc cure. Headache can be relieved by making upward passes from the neck"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"156 THE PRACTICAL CLAIEVOYANT. to the crown of tlic hend, as if demcsmerizing. This is doMo by the operator walking nroiind the patient so as to affect every portion of the h(jad, finisliing eacli pass ae if drawing some dehjtia'ions influence from tiie pati' nt's licad. S'line cuses can be cured by making downward instead of npwaril passes. Fre(]ucnily the patient will be relieved by bieatliing on his head a lew times alter you have com- nkcnced (lie passes. Sliould the disease not yield to this treatment (which is to be used while the patient is awake), then ])nt the patient to sleep and follow the foregoing directions tiie same as when he was awake. Neuralgia, when sev< re, is best treated by the complete mesmeiizing of the patient, ami as soon as the sleep is produced let local ])asses, without contact, b(? mad<! over the pait affected Mild cases can usnally be relieved ly a few general passes, as in mesmerizing a subject, followed by Method of Curing Toothache, Neuralgia, or Headache. local passes over the seat of disease. All local passes used in tr<'ating di-ease should l e finished by a drawing motion of the hands ; the operator at the same time will- ing firndy to draw some malevolent influence iVom the patient's system, the removal of which, though not seen, is nevertheless proceeding under the man pulati(ms. Wtien each pass is finished, iiing your hands briskly fiom the"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"THE PEACTICAL CLAIRVOYANT. 157 patient (not in the diiection of your own person), as if you weie throwing the di^-eat^c from your fin^-er-tips. Rheumatism may be treated by local passes, continuing the treameiit for Imlf an liour at a time, preceded by tlse mesmeric slumber in very severe cases. Let t!ie local passes be mude in the diicctiun wliich the arterial blood flows, tliat is towards llie extremities, commencin^^ each pass at tlie point of diseased action nearest tlui heart. As u gener;»l rule, all local passes should be made in like manner, observing also not to hold ti:e hands in such a position as to demesmerize while bringing them up to re\" peat the passes. Should ri<ri<'.ity of the patient's muscles n su't fiom your man pulations, it can be easily removed by patting the rigid part gently with your hand, or by blowing ir briskly two or llirc c tinv s, or I y a few reveiso passes. Molheis and nuises may frequently prevent fi's and convulsions during teething, by makii g downward passes over the head, lace, and dic^t of the chdd. Ear- ache, that comm<jn com|)l int amon;^ children, may bo cured by fobowing the direeiions for relieving head icho, and by liieaihing in tie ear .-flectjd. It is a g' od plan to force the l)reath into a folded liandK<M'chief placed t-n the sj)ot where the pain is located. When peisons are naturally very susceptible to mesmerism, < r have become BO by repeat(jd trials, then any portion of their bod es may be rnagn(Mized by local passes without affeciing the lest of their systems. A jaw m ly be mesmerized and a tooth drawn without pain ; a fi^ot may be made insensible and an ingrowing nail taken away. Serious surgical opera- tions may be f)erforme(l by mesnjeiizing th(3 paiiint most profoundly, and wdiile in the htale 1 e will be insensible to the pain, and he may I e awakfned. except that poriiou of the body operated on by the surueon, which portion may bo left to rapidly heal in a magnetic state, without pain. The curious fact tl at persons deeply magnetized become compleb ly insensible to pain at the will of the operator, prumis( s muc li future good to the human family. Another"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"158 THE PRACTICAL CLAIEVOYANT. fact equally curious is, thiit while the subject feels no pain inflicted on Ids own body, he is keenly sensitive to pains given the hody of the < perator who controls him. A needle thrust in tlie operator's arm will cause the subject to flinch, while, at the same time, he will pay no attention what- ever to a thrust in his own person. Anoiher very successful method of mesmeric treatment practiced by one ol the leading magneti.^ f)hysicians is to instruct the patient when deeply magnetized to make a firm resolntion, with all the poweis of his will, that he shall be well and free from his di.-ease upon awaking. Let the subject he thoionghly taught, while in the magnetic Uate, to forgot his disease, to be rid of it, and in no case be allowed to entertain ideas that he will feel badly when awaki^ned, and the result will be astonishing. D sease of a simple character, like ague, is often cured by one trial. Some magnetizers make a practice of letting their patients describe their own diseases while in a magnetic state, and also to prescribe the remedies. We think t!iis decidedly unsafe, unless th(! p itient has developed un loubted clair- voyant faculties of a high degree. The patient may describe symptoms and condiiions which do not exist in his system, and the impression, while mignetized, though f il-ein it-elf may bring about real results whivh will be directly the reverse of those mentioned in the preceding paragiaph ; also, the subject's own mental prescription while in a state of coma may cause a physical necessity for the remedies prescribed. Let all the impressions entertained by the subject be of a nature to bi ing about a favorable result, since the power of magnetic imagination will produce great results in the natural state, so far as the physical B^'stem is concerned. In your treatment, be actuated by a sincere desire to do good ; follow the directions given in full conlidence ; see that your sul ject is made free from all fear, and you will be absolutely astonished at ^^jurself, and the only trouble will be that you will be annoyed by tiie springing up of a neighborhood practice for ihe treatmeut of simple diseases."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"THE PRACTICAL CLAIRYOYANT. 159 CHAPTER SEVENTH, PUBLIC LECTURING. Prrhaps it will not be amiss to p^ive our readers a few hints on the above-named subject, since a lew of tliem, at any rale, will ultimately s(^ek t<) difinsc the knovledge of mesmerism through the powers of oratory and declama- tion. While we do not wish to restrict the tyro lecturer to onr particular plan, yet we believe that a definite plan will be of f^reat advantage to tlie beginner, who may vary the programme to huit his individual taste and the circumstances wliich surround iiim. In addressin.;- an audience on the important subject of Animal Magnetism, it is best lo inform them that the great mystery has been known to the world for age.'', and th;it it. is no new-fani^'led humbug, but a truth will established. After citing to them historical accounts of magnetic wonders, call tl;cir attention to the mysterious facta of our present tifne, giving such instances as cannot be gainsayed. Seek to impress the audience that there is much more in this thing which they are inclined to ridicule than they imngine. VVe do not know as it is worth while to spend much time in exphiining a theory — one fact is worth a thousand theories ; and then, too, there are so many theories advocated in regard to the sub- ject, that perhaps it would be just as well to st-t them all aside. A promisctious audience ran ly lias the patience to sit quietly and listen to a line sputi arojument which, after all, may be entirely w mistake. When you have finished 3'onr address, which should deal with the subject only in a g( iieral w;iy, you can state to the audience that yon are leady to experiment, but that if they wish your cxjieriment to be entirely successful they must obey orders.

Let all the assembly close their eyes t'ghlly for lialf a minute or m- re. During that tin»e fix your mind (irmly on tlie who'e assembly, wi.ling their c\\es to remain closed. Then tell them that they cannot 0|)cn their e^'cs. Perhaps two or three in the crowd will be able to do t^o — (Duds s:iys about one in twenty live on an average), 'i liosc who cmnot open their eyes will be excellent sid'jects for any experiment you may wish to perf rm during the evening ; that is, if yuu can get them to come forward and snbniit tht inselves. Next try the coin experiment, getting as many individuals to submit themselves as possible. We will not repeat the directions given in a preceding chapter. Whoa you (ind a subject who is easily controlled by \" taking ilie communication\" through the median nerve, with thumb on the foiehcad, first experiment in controlling his muscles ; let him clasp his hands tightly together over his head, across his knees, and around {I cane, stren-^thening ;\\our influence by a few passes over his hands before telling him lh »t he cannot separate them.

The palms of the hands contain a great variety of lines running in different directions, every one of which bears a certain relation to the events of a person's life; and from them, witli the most infallible certainty, can be told every circumstance that will happen to any one, by observing them properly. It is therefore recom- mended to pay strict attention to this subject, as by that means you will undoubtedly gain very excellent knowledge for your pains. And first is given the names of the several lines as they hold iheir places, and then particularize their qualities. There are five principal lines i;i the hand, viz : • The Line of Life. The Line of Death. The Table Line. The Girdle of Venus. The Line of Fortune. And besides these arc other Lines, as the Line of Saturn, the liver Line, and some others, but these only serve to explain the principal Lines. The chief Line on which persons of the profession lay the greatest stress, is the Line of Life, which generally takes its rise where the thumb-joint plays with the wrist on the inside ; and runs in an oblique direction to the inside of the innermost joint of the fore finger. The nex\\; is the Line of Death, which separates the fleshy part of the hand on the little finger side, from the hollow of the hand, running in \\arious directions in different people. The Table Line originates with the Line of Life at the wrist, and runs through the hollow of the hand towards the middle finger."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"FOETUNE-TELLEB AND DREAM-BOOK. The Girdle of Venus takes its course from the extremity of th© lowermost joint of the litllo linger, and, forming a curve, termi- nates between the fore and middle fingers. The Line of Fortune strikes from behind the ball, or mount of the fore linger, across the palm and Line of Life, and loses itself in or near the fleshy part of the hand, cn the little finger side. If the Line of Life ii crossed by other lines at or near the wrist, the person will meet with sickness in the beginning of life, and the degree ot sickness will be proportioned to the size, length, and breadth of the intervening lines. If the Line of Life runs fair and uninterrupted, the person will enjoy good health ; and accord- ing to its length towards the outside of the fore finger, you may judge if the person will live long, as the longer the line the longer the life. If the Line of Death is short, and runs even, without being broken or divided, it shows that the person will enjoy a good length of days, and not be subject lo many maladies; but if it is interrupted, it evidently shows that the person's life will be en- dangered by illne^ss. If this line ends abrablly, and with a broad point, it shows that the person will die suddenly ; i£ it goes olf in a tapering point, the last illness will be slow, and consuming by degrees. If other lines run across it, the person will be of a weakly and infirm habit of body, often incapable of following any hard or laborious business. The line of Fortune, by its approach to the Girdle of Venus, shows that there ii a strong kindred between them, and their dis- tance, at their two extremities, clearly jioints out that love is in- consistent with childhood and eld age; yet i:i those where the cros> lines approach from the one \\j the other i:ear their ends, 1 rove that the persons were, or v. ill l;e susceptible ci iDve i.i child/- 1 ooJ or old age. For example, it the cross lines are at the be- ,t inni ig of the Girdle ot Venu^, ami bear towards the tail of the Line of Fortune, it evidently iadicutcs that the perrjon was sus- ceptible of love at an earlier period tlian U3ual; it these lines of communication are crossed by other small lines, the person has been disappointed i i his wishes, cr f everely punished for r,ratify- ing them ; if plain and straight, that ]ie has been successful ; if the lines take their rise from the tail cl: the Girdle, and lead towards the head of the Line of Fortune, tlie i)er5on will be amorous in his old age, and, according to the situation cf the transverse lines, will be successful or unfortunate i.i his amours; if the Line of Fortune runs smooth, broad, and clear, the person will enjoy afilaence through life, and be prosperous in all his undertakings ; if it is intersected by short lines at the beginning, near the fore finger, it denotes that the person was poor, or at least with a small capital; if these lines occur towards the middle, at either end, he will be prosperous in the first and last of life, but meet"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"FORTUNE-TELLER AND DREAM-BOOK. 185 with disappointments at raid-age ; if the cross lines occur at the extremity, and not before, lie will die poor and distressed. If transverse lines, crossed by others, pass from the Line of Life to the Line o£ Fortune, the person vv'ill be engaged in quarrels and broils, or lawsuits and disunion with his neighbors. If the hollow palm of the hand, which some call the Plain of Mars, is full of cross lines, running into each other, the person will bo of a humorsome, uneven, and testy temper, jealous and hasty, quarrelsome and lighting, and endeavoring to set others by the ears; he will meet with very frequent misfortunes, and bear them very uneasily ; whereas, if the hollow or palm of the hand has none but the unavoidable lines, that is to say, those that must unavoidably pass through it, he will bo of a sweet and amiable dis- position, full of sensibility, gratitude, and love, faithful benevo- lent, and kind ; and, though subject to crosses, losses, and disap- pointments, will bear them with a:i oven and agreeable temper ; from this part chielly it is recommended to persons to choose their companions for life, cither for friendship or marriage. The mount or ]jall oi the thumb bears a peculiar analogy to the events of a person's liic, with respect to disputes, quarrels, and lawsuits ; if tliis moimt has m.any long, stniight lines, reaching from the thumb to the Lino of Life, they show that the i)erson will have several personal encounters, either with hands, clubs, pistols, or swords ; but if the lines are curved or crooked, they indicate lawsuits, and, according to the degree of crookedness, they will be long or short ; but if these lines end in n, straight direction to- wards the Line of Life, they will end prosperously ; if otherwise, they will be attended with an unfavorable issue. MOLES. FIFTY-TWO GREEK OBSERVATIONS ON THESE SPOTS OF DESTINY. The Greeks attach much importance to Moles, but i;i a different mode to the old English track, as to the limbs, features, etc. To those born in the first week of tlie year, reckoning from the first of January to the seventh, they pronounce all moles above llie shoulders to be fortunate indicators, — the more in number the better ; and all leneath, the reverse to those born in the course of the second week. Moles of any sort arc ominous of evil in the early part of life. Fourth week — So many important turns of fate as there are spots. Fifth week — So many lovers. Sixth week — So many important journeys. Seventh week — Moles on the arms indicate prosperity. Eightii week — So many perils. Ninth week — So many intrigues. Tenth week — So many legacies.

It is to be observed, that the above predictions are stronger or weaker according to the mumber of moles. The B'rlh of Chil'lren, and Other Eventa, tciih Bespecl to ihe Moon's Age and Daj of ihe ^Veek. — To bo born the first day of the new moon portends tlieir life shall be pleasant, with an increase cf riches. A child born on the second day will grow apace, and be inclined to lust, of either sex. It is lucky on this day to send messages of trade, buy land, and sow seed. A child bora on the third day will be short-lived. Never begin any work of moment on this day. Thefts committed on this day will soon be discovered. The fourth day is bad. Persons falling sick on this day rarely recover, and the dreams will have no effect. The fifth day is favorable to begin a good work, and the dreams will be tolerably successful ; the child bom on that day will bo deceitful and proud. The sixth day, the dreams will not immediately como to paaa; and the child born will not live long."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"FORTUNE-TELLER AND DREAM-BOOK. 187 The seventh. Do not tell your dreams on this day, for much depends on concealing them ; if sickness befalls you on this day, you will soon recover ; the child born will live long, but have many troubles. The eighth day, the dreams will come to pass, and it is a very prosperous dn,y. The ninth day differs very little from the former; the child born this day will arrive at great riches and honor. The tenth day is likely to be fatal ; those who fall sick will rarely recover ; but the child born on this day will live long, and be a great traveler. The eleventh is a good day to be married, or commence a jour- ney. A child born at this age of the moon will be healthy, hand- some, and of a good constitution, with a particular mole on his lorehead. If a female, will be remarkable for wisdom. On the twelfth day, the child born will meet every affection, but be of a bad temper. This is a very unlucky day, particularly to those falling sick. A child born on the thirteenth day will be unfortunate both in temper and estate ; though a good day for marriages, or to find things which have been lost. Persons imprisoned this day will soon have their liberty. A child whoso nativity is on the fourteenth day, will die as a traitor. An excellent day to ask a favor. Take physic on this day. The fifteenth day is very unfortunate. A good day to find any- thing that is lost. The child born on the sixteenth day will bo unmannerly and un- fortunate. Buy and sell on this day. Dreams portend luck on this day, The seventeenth of the moon, a child to be born on, shows it will be foolish. You may take physic, let blood, or contract busi- ness on this day. The eighteenth day is fortunate, both for male and female, bom on it. A nativity on the nineteenth day, the child will be wise ana urtu- OU3, and will arrive at great honors. Your dreams portend good on the twentieth day of the moon ; though a child born on that day will be dishonest. A child born the twenty-first day will be of so unhappy a dispo- sition, that, let him look to the sword of justice, perhaps \"black with murder, sacrilege, and crimes.\" An unhappy fatality attends this day. On the twenty-second day, the child that is born will purchase a good estate ; he will be handsome, religious, and well beloved. This is a good day to remove bees. On the twenty-third day, the child that is born will be of an"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"188 FOBTTJNE-TELLER AND DBEAM-BOOK. ungoveniablo temper, a groat traveler, but will die miserable. Good day to be married, or commence business. On the twenty-fourth day, the child born will achieve many he- roic actions, and will be much admired for them. Thj c'lild born on the twenty-flfth day will be very wicked, and meet wdth many dangerj. It is a very unfortunate day, and threatens vexation. On the twenty-sixth day, the child bc:n shall be very amiable; if a male, will meet but an indifferent state in the world ; if a female, she will bo married to a rich man for her beauty. On the twenty-seventh day, a child born on this day will have every engaging quality, but will not rise to any great preferment. This i j a ver / lucky day. On the twenty-eighth day, the child that is born shall be the de- light of his i^arents, but have much sickness. To Know Whe'her Your Love of a Person loill be Mutual. — Take tho number of tho first letter o[ your name, the number of tho planet, and day of tho week, put all these together, and divide them by 30 ; if it be above, it will come to j-our mind, and if below, to the contrary ; and mind that number which exceeds not 30.

Prepirj yourself threo days previous to the eve of this female saint, by living on bread and water and sprigs of parsley, and touch no other thing whatever, or your labor will be lost ; the eve begins at the sixth hour. Go to bed as soon as you conveniently can, and speak not a word after you once begin to undress ; get into bed, lay on your left side with your head as low as possible, then repeat the following verse three times : St. Anne, in silver clouds descend.

Magic Bose. — Gather your rose on the 27th of J une ; let it be full blown, and as bright a red as you. can get ; pluck it between the hours of three and four in the morning, taking cu,rc to have no wit- ness of the transaction ; convey it to you • chamber, and hold it over a chaffing dish or any convenient utensil for the purpose, in which there is charcoal and sulphur of brimstone ; hold your rose over the smoke about live minutes, and yon will see it have a won- derful effect on the flower. Before the rose gets the least cool, clap it in a sheet of writing-paper, on which is written your own name and that of the young man you love best; also the date of the year, and the name of the morning star that has the ascend- ency at that time ; fold it up and seal it neatly with three separate seals, then run and bury the parcel at the foot of the tree from which you gathered the flower; liere let it remain untouched till the Gth of July ; take it up at midnight, go to bed and place it under your pillow, and you will have a singular and most eventful dream before morning ; or, at least before your usual time of rising. You may keep the rose under 3-our head three nights without spoiling the charm ; when you have done with the rose and paper be sure to burn them. Cupid's Nosegay. — On the first niqrht of the new moon in July, take a red rose, a white rose, a yellow flower, a blue one, a sprig of rue and rosemary, and nine blades of long grass ; bind all to- gether with a lock of your own hair ; kill a white pigeon, sprinkle the nosegay with the blood from the heart, and some common salt ; wrap the flowers in a white handkerchief, and lay it under your head, on the pillow, when you go to rest; and, before morning, you will see j-our fate as clear as if you had your nativity cast by the best Astrologer in the world ; not only in respect to love, lovers, or marriage, but in the other most important affairs of your life ; storms, in this dream, foretell great trouble ; and graves or church- yards are fatal tokens, and so is climbing steep and dangerous places. Love's Cordial. — To be Tried the Third Night of a New Moon. — Take brandy, rum, gin, wine, and the oil of amber, of each a teaspoon- ful ; a tablespoonful of cream, and three of spring water ; drink it as you get into bed ; rei)eat — This mixture of love I take for my potion, That I of my destiny may have a notion ; Cupid befriend me, new moon bo kind. And show unto me the fate that's design'd."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"FORTUNB-TELLEE AND DREAM-BOOK. You will dream of drink, and, according to the quality or manner of it being presented, you may tell the condition to which you will rise or fall by marriage. Water is poverty ; and, if you dream of a drunken man, it is ominous that you will have a drunken mate. If you dream of drinking too much, 3-ou will fall, at a future period, into that sad error yourself, without great care ; and what is a worse sight than an inebriated female ? She can not guard her own honor, ruitis her own and family's substance, and often clothes herself with rags. Trouble is often used as an excuse for this vicious habit, but it gives more troujle than it takes away. The Xine Jic^s.— Got nine small keys ; they must all bo your own by begging or purchase (borrowing will not do, nor must you tell what you want them for) ; plait a three-plaited band of your own hair, and tie them together, fastening the ends with nine knots, fasten them with one of your garters to your left wrist on going to bed, and bind the other garter round your head ; then say — St. Peter, take it not amiss. To try your favor I've done this ; You arc the ruler of the keys, Favor me, then, if you please; Let me then your influence prove, And see my dear and wedded love. This must be done on the eve of St. Peter's, and is an old charm used by the maidens of Rome in ancient times, who put great faith in it. The Ring and O'.ive-hranch. — Buy a ring, it matters not it being gold, 80 as it has the semblance of a wedding-ring, and it is best to try this charm on your own birthday. Pay for your ring with some small bill ; for, whatever change you receive, you must f.ive to the lirst begger you meet in the street ; and if no one asks alms of you, give it to some poor person ; for you need not, alas ! go far before you find one to whom your charity will be acceptable ; care- fully note what they say in return, such as \"God bless you,\" or wishing you luck and prosperity, as is usual. When you get home, write it down on a sheet of paper, at each of four corners ; and, in the middle, put the two first letters of your name, your age, and the letters of the planets then reigning as morning and evening stars ; get a branch of olive and fasten the ring on the stalk with a string or thread, which has been steeped all day in a mixture of honey and vinegar, or any composition of opposite qualities, very sweet and very sour ; cover your ring and stalk with the written paper carefully wrapped round and round ; wenr it in your bosom till the ninth hour of the night ; then repair to the next churchyard and bury the charm in the grave of a young man who died unmar- ried ; and while you are so doing, repeat the letters of your own"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"FOETUNE-TELLER AND DEEAM-BOOK. 191 CJhristian name three times backwards ; return liome, and keep as silent and quiet as possible till you go to bed, which must be before eleven ; put a light in your chimney, or some safe place ; and, be- fore midnight, or just about that time, your husband that is to bo will present himself at the foot of the bed, but will presently dis- appear. If you arc not to marry, none vv ill come ; and, in that case, if you dream before morning of children, it shows that you will have them unmarried ; and if you dream of crowds of men, beware of prostitution. The Witches' Chain. — Let three young women join in making a long chain, about a yard will do, of Christmas, juniper, and mistle- toe berries ; and at tlie end of every link put an oak acorn. Exactly before midnight lot them assemble in a room by themselves, where no one can disturb them ; leave a window open, and take the key out of the keyhole and hand it over the chimney-piece ; have a good fire, and place in the midst of it a long thinnish log of wood, well sprinkled with oil, salt, and fresh mould ; then wrap the chain round it, each maiden having an equal share in the business ; then sit down, and on your left knee let each fair one have a prayer-book opened at the matrimonial service. Just as the last acorn is burned, the future husband will cross the room ; each one will see her own proper spouse, but he will bo invisible to the rest of the wakeful virgins. Those that are not to wed will see a coffin, or some mis- shapen form, cross the room ; go to bed instantly and you will all have remarkable dreams. This must bo done either on a Wednes- day or Friday night, but no other. Love-ktUrs. — On receiving a love-letter that has any particular declaration in it, lay it wide open ; then fold it in nine folds, pin it next your heart, and thus wear it till bed-time ; then place it in your left-hand glove, and lay it under your head. If you dream of gold, diamonds, or any costly gems, your lover is true, and means what he says ; if of white linen, you will lose him by death ; and if of flowers, he will prove false. If you dream of his saluting you, he is at present false and means not what he professes, but only to draw you into a snare. Strange Bed. — On going to rest, take a glass of water, half fill It with salt, and drink it off as quick as you can ; do not speak after- wards, but compose yourself to sleep, and thirst will cause you to dream ; which joined to a strange bed, will have a true effect. To See a Future Husbavd. — On Midsummer-eve, just after sunset, three, five, or seven young women are to go into a garden, in which there Id no other person, and each to gather a sprig of red sago, and then, going into a room by themselves, set a stool in the middle of tho room, and on it a clean basin full of rose-water, in which the"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"192 FORTUNE-TELLEE AND DREAM-BOOK. sprigs of sage nro to bo put, and, tying a line across the room, on one side of the stool, each woman is to hang on it a clean shift, turning the v. ron;^ side outwards ; then all are to sit down in a row, on the opposite si ic of the stool, as far distant as the room will admit, not speaking a single word the vWiole time, whatever they see, and in a few minutes after twelve, each one's future liusband will take her sprig out of the rose-water, and sprinkle her shift with it. On St. Agnes' night, 21st January, take a row of pins, and pull out every one, one after another, saying a paternoster or sticking a pin in your sleeve, and you will dream of him you will marry. A slice of the bride-cake thrice drawn through the weddincc-ring, and laid under the head of an unmarried woman, will make her dream of her future husband. The same is practiced in some parts of Europe with a piece of the groaning cheese. Another way to see a future spouse in a dream : The party in- quiring must sleep in a different county from that in which she usually resides, and, on going to bed, must knit the left garter about the right-legged stocking, letting the other garter and stocking alone ; and as you rehearse the following verse, at every comma tie a knot • This knot I knit, to know the thing I know not yet, That I may see, the man that shall my husband be, How hc.goes, and what he wears, And what he does all days and years.

It is an offense against the Greek churcli (or indeed any Christian one) and always proves unfortur natc to a person so doing ; and under this head we also record the fifty- two Babbaths, Ash Wednesday, and the eve of St. Jude. The Charm.— This must be tried alone, and with profound secrecy, between the hours of nine and twelve at night, — neither sooner nor later. Take a v/hite dove, and kill it ; take out the heart and liver, and roast it until you can powder it on a piece of white paper ; mix one teaspoonful of this witii a drachm of dragon's blood, put them in half a gill of Cyprus wine, and drink it on going to bed ; previously mix the blood that flows from the bird with wheaten flower, into a cake of the form of a heart, prick it with the first letters of your name, and the form of a Maltese cross — Which is thus designed ; leave the cake baking over the fire, as it will have a great influence in your dream. When you dream any particular dream, write it down on a sheet of paper, round and round i:i a circle, so that the last word comes into the middle, and place it under your pillow on going to bed, and you will dream more fully on the subject. Hymeneil Charm. — The night before your nuptials, write your name on a piece of paper, as small as possible, the name of your spouse elect, the date of the wedding-day, the month, and the year ; inclose all in a circle of blood drawn from one of your fingers, fold the paper i:ito nine folds, place it in the stocking drawn from your left log, and place it between your head and the pillow, and b}^ your dreams of that night you may guess what will be the fate attending your nuptial life. For a Girl to Ascertain if She wi l Soon Marry. — Find a green pea- pod with exactly nine peas in it, and hang it over the door of a room or entry-way, without letting any person know that you have done so ; you must then watch the door and see who goes through first ; if it is a bachelor, or an unmarried young man, you will posi- tively be married before the current crop of poas is disposed of ; if it is a woman, you will liave to sigh in single 1 lessedness another year ; if a married man, be careful and not allow j^our lover too much liberty in his attentions, or tho consec^uences may bo re- gretted."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"FOETUNE-TELLER AND DREAM-BOOK. PHYSIOGNOMY ; OB, THE AET OP DISCOVEKING A PEKSON'S DISPOSITION BY THEIR FEATURES. That the form of the features display the disposition of the soul, and may be demonstrated by the principles of philosophy, is ob- vious to every person of the least reflection. It is impossible for man to feel any passion, without the countenance sympathizing with the sensation, so as exactly to express the internal emotion. That passion, therefore, which is predominant in the human char- acter, being the most frequently excited, must, by repetition, ex- press the prevailing disposition on the countenance. And as every person has a temper peculiar to himself, that temper must impress on the visage such signs as display, to a discriminate observer, the particular passion or temperament, which distinguishes every human being from the rest of his fellow creatures. The face that is plump, round, and ruddy, denotes the person to bo of an agreeable temper, and deserving friendship, as well as faithful in love ; and the man, though sometimes in an unguarded moment may be led astray, yet he soon returns, and proves more affectionate than before. The face that is smooth and even, with well-proportioned fea- tures, shows the person to be of a good disposition, but somewhat inclined to suspicion, yet of an agreeable conversation, and strongly addicted to the delights of love. A face whose cheek-bones stick out, with thin jaws, is of a rest- less disposition, fretful, and always foreboding evil, v^ithout any plausible reason ; and more disposed than capable of enjoying the Dleasures of love. If the forehead is large, round, and smooth, it denotes the man or woman to be of an open, generous temper, and will be extremely good-natured ; his love for the fair one whom he selects will be tender, manly, and inviolable, provided her own misconduct does not banish it from his breast; his conversation vfill be lively, modest, and pleasing ; and he will seldom die before he attains the age of sixty, or upwards. If the forehead is flat in the middle, the man or woman will be found to be proud, and little disposed to generosity ; in love affairs the man will be violent, and very cautious of his own reputation, as well as that of his mistress ; he Vv ill get many children, v/hom he will not suffer to degrade themselves ; but if they should, he will beat them with the utmost severity, and v/ill not be easily prevailed on to forgive them. If there is a hollow across the forehead, in the middlo^ of man or woman, with a ridge, as of flesh, above, and another Ijelow, the man will be a good scholar, and the woman great in whatever oc-"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"rOETUNE-TELLEB AND DBEAM-BOOK. 195 CTipation she may be engaged in ; they will not be liberal in be- stowing, but if they can be of service without hurting themselves, they will do it cheerfully ; love will not be their prevailing passion, and they will have but few children, and those at very distant periods — perhaps three, four, sometimes seven yeirs, between every two ; they will meet with many crosses, but will bear them with a tolerable share of patience. If the forehead projects immediately over the eyebrows, running flat up to the hair, the man or woman will be sulky, proud, inso- lent, imperious, and treacherous ; and will never forgive an injury, but will take every opportunity to prejudice the person ; will have few children, and in quick succession. If a crescent or half-moon line passeth through the forehead, the party must beware of evil. If the temples are hollow, with the bones advancing towards the forehead on either side, so that the space between is flat, with a small channel of indenture rising from the upward part of the nose to the hair, the man or woman will bo of a daring temper, and a restless and wandering disposition, extremely lewd, and never seriously attend to one object ; in understanding will be rather weak, and will trouble themselves but little about the conse- quences that may result from their proceedings ; they will seldom have above one or two children, and will not live to an advanced age. The eye that is large, full, prominent, and clear, denotes a man or woman to be ingenuous and without deceit ; of an even, agree- able disposition ; modest and bashful in the affairs of love; will suffer no great Iiardships, nor enjoy any great share of happiness ; will have several children, but more girls than boys. The eye that is small, but advanced in the head, shows the man or woman fo be of a quick wit, lively genius, agreeable conversa- tion, and good morals, but inclined to jealousy. The man or woman whose eyes are sunk in the head, is of a jealous, distrustful, malicious, and envious nature ; he will have many children, whom ho will, if possible, avoid providing for. Next, the nose thp.t is even on the ridge, and flat on the sides, with little or no hollow between the eyes, declares the man or woman to be sulky, disdainful, and treacherous. The nose that rises with a sudden bulge, a little below the eyes, is petulant and noisy. The nose that is small, slender, and peaked, shows the person to be jealous, fretful, and suspicious. The nose that is small, tapering, round in the nostrils, and cocked up, shows the person to be ingenious, smart, of a quick apprehension, but giddy, and seldom looking into consequences. The lips that are thick, soft, and long, bespeak the person to be"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"196' FORTUNE-TELLEB AND DREAM-BOOK. of weak intellect, peevish, and is strongly addicted to the pleasures of love. If the under lip is thicker than the upper, and more prominent, the person is of a weak understanding, artful, and knavish. The lips that are moderately plump and even, declare the person to be good-humored, humane, sensible, and just. The lips that are thin, show the person to be of a quick and lively imagination, and eager in the pleasures of love. The lips that are thin and sunk in, denote the person to be sly and revengeful, and in love or friendship moderate and uncertain. The chin that is round, with a hollow between that and the lip, shows the person to be of a good disposition, kind, and honest; sincere in friendship, and ardent in love. The chin that comes dovrn flat from the edge of the lip, and ends in a kind of chisel form, shows the person to be silly, credulous, jealous, and ill-tempered. Thus is shown, according to the most learned and judicious ancient authors, all that can really be gathered from that index of the human mind, the face, and all its parts. HOW TO TELL A PEESON'S CHAEACTER, BY MEANS OF CABAIilSTIC CALCULATIOXS. This is said to have been the invention of the sage Pythagorus, whose doctrine was that cver^-thing in the universe was repre- sented and governed by certain figures or numbers, to which he ascribed mysterious properties and virtues. According to him, everything, from the Supremo Being himself down to the minutest atom, was distinguished by its own proper number ; and his belief was shared by numberless other philosophers. Without entering into any detail of this system, we will proceed to describe how these calculations are made. An alphabetical table must be first prepared with its corresponding numbers, thus : A B 0 1 D E F G H I 1 2 5 6 7 8 9 K L M \\ N 0 P E S 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 T U X Y Z J V Hi Hu 100 200 300 ' 400 500 600 700 800 900"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"FORTUNE-TELLER AND DREAM-BOOK. 197 This is accomplished by a list of numbers, with their various Interpretations and significations, as follows : 1. Passion, ambition, design. 2. Destruction, death, catas- trophe 3. Religion, destiny, the soul, charms. 4. Solidity, wisdom, power. 5. The stars, happiness, graces, marriage. 6. Perfection, labor. 7.

Now write down the name of the person whose character you wish to learn, and beneath each letter composing it place the cor- responding number. (Should the letter W be one of them, it mast be represented by two V's, which will give the number 1400.) Add them all together, and by comparing the product with the table of significations, you will discover what you wish to know. When the product exceeds the highest number given in the table, the first number is cut off, and the remainder alone used. We give an example, supposing the name to be Jean Jacques Rousseau ; — J 600 J 600 E 80 E 5 A 1 0 50 A 1 C 3 U 200 N 40 Q 70 S 90 U 200 S 90 646 E 5 E 5 S 90 A 1 — U 200 969 716 646 Jean. 969 Jacques. 716 Eousseau. 2331 Total. Of this total of 2331, we cut off the 2,000, leaving 331, which, on reference to the table of significations, reads as follows : — Belief, faith, and philosophy, for 300 ; love of glory, virtue, for 31 ; giving no bad sketch of his character. It may be as well to observe, that, when the total consists of a number not precisely marked on the table, the answer may be obtained by dividing it into hundreds, tens, and units ; thus, supposing the number obtained was 179, it could be divided into 100, 70, and 9. Care must be taken to add up the lines of figures correctly, as the slightest mistake will, of course, entirely change the whole meaning. FORTUNE-TELLING BY THE GROUNDS IN A TEA OR COFFEE CUP.

Long wavy lines denote vexations -and losses, — their impor- tance depending on the number of lines. Straight ones, on the contrary, foretell peace, tranquility, and long life. Human figures are usuilly good omens, announcing lovo affairs and marriage. If circular figures predominate, the person for whom the experi- ment is made may expect to receive money. If these circles are connected by straight unbroken lines, there will be delay but ul- timately all will be satisfactory. Squares foretell peace and hap- piness ; oblong figures, family discord ; whilst curved, twisted, or angular ones, are certain signs of vexations and annoyances, their probable duration being determined by the number of figures. A crown signifies honor ; a cross, news of a death ; a ring, marriage, — if a letter can be discovered near it, that will be the initial of the name of the future spouse. If the ring is in the clear part of the cup, it foretells a happy union ; if clouds are about it, the contrary ; but if it should chance to be quite at the bottom, then the mar- riage will never take place. A leaf of clover, or trefoil, is a good sign, denoting, if at the top of the cup, speed}- good fortune, which will be more or less distant ia case it appears at or near the bot- tom. The anchor, if at the bottom of the cup, denotes success in business ; at the top, and in the clear part, love and fidelity ; but in thick, or cloudy parts, inconstancy. The serpent is always the sign of an enemy, and if in the cloudy part, gives warning that great prudence will be necessary to ward off misfortune. The coffin portends news of a death or long illness. The dog, at the top of the cup, denotes true and faithful friends ; in the middle, that they are not to be trusted ; but at the bottom, that they are se- cret enemies. The lily, at the top of the cup, foretells a happy marriage ; at the bottom, anger. A letter signifies news ; if in the clear, very welcome news ; surrounded by dots, a remittance of money ; but if hemmed in by clouds, bad tidings and losses ; a heart near it denotes a love-letter. A single tree portends restora- tion to health : a group of trees in the clear, misfortunes which may be avoided; several trees, wide apart, promise that your wishes will be accomplished ; if encompassed by dashes, it is a token that your fortune is in its blossom, and only requires care to bring to maturity ; it surrounded by dots, riches. Mountains signify either friends or enemies, according to their situation. The sun, moon, and stars, denote happiness and success. The clouds, happiness or misfortune, according as they are bright cr dark. Birds are good omens, but quadrupeds — with the exception of the dog — foretell trouble and difficulties. Fish imply good news from across the water. A triangle portends an unexpected legacy ; a single straight line, a journey. The figure of a man in- dicates a speedy visitor ; if the arm is outstretched, a present;"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"FOETUNE-TELLEE AND DEEAM-BOOK. when the figure is very distinct, it shows that the person expected will be of dark complexion, and vice versa. A crown near a cross indicates a large fortune, resulting from a death. Flowers are signs of joy, happiness, and peaceful life. A heart surrounded by dots signifies joy, occasioned by the receipt of money; with a ring near it, approaching marriage. How to Bead Your Fortune by the White of an Egg. — Break a new- laid egg, and, carefully separating the yolk from the white, drop the latter into a large tumbler half full of water ; place this, un- covered, in some dry place, and let it remain untouched for four- and-twenty hours, by which time the white of the egg will have formed itself into various figures — rounds, squares, ovals, ani- mals, trees, crosses, etc. — which are to be interpreted in the same manner as those formed by the coffee-grounds. Of course, the more whites there are in the glass, the more figures there will be. This is a very pretty experiment, and much practiced by the young Scotch maidens, who, however, believe it to have more effi- cacy when tried on either Midsummer Eve or Hallowe'en (31st Oc- tober). To Choose a Husband by the Hair. — Black. — Stout and healthy, but apt to be cross and surly ; if very black and smooth, and a large quantity, will be found where he fixes his attachment, not ad- dicted to lewdness, make a good husband, and take care of his fami- ly ; but if short and curly, will be of an unsettled temper, given to drinking, somewhat quarrelsome, will show much fondness at first paying his addresses, but be unsteady and forgetful afterwards. White, ok I'aib Haik. — Will be of a weak constitution, rather stupid, very fond of music, will cut no great figure in the world, very moderate in his amorous wishes, but get many children. Yellow. — Inclined to jealousy. Light Brown. — Neither very good nor very bad, middling in all respects, rather given to women, but upon the whole is a good character. Dark Bko^^n. — Sensible and good-humored, careful, attentive to business, and generally makes a good husband. Very Dark Brown. — Of a robust constitution, and of a grave disposition, but good-tempered and sensible ; very fond of his wife, though he may chance now and then to go astray. Ked. — Will be artful, cunning, and deceitful, and much given to wenching ; loves a chemise so well that his wife will scarce have one to her back ; but is generallv of a lively temper.

Have ready three dice, but try your first question with a single one, the next with two, and the third with three. This may be done three times over at one sitting, making in all nine questions, and their suitable answers, but no more ; for the dice then turn fatal, and of evil tendenc\" to the holder, and only serve to con- fuse the truth. One. — A letter or paper of great importance. Two. — A long journey from which you will benefit. Three.— A surprise, and causes a strange bed. Four. — You will soon meet with ingratitude. Five. — A new lover, but not the right one yet. Six. — Unexpected money, and prosperity before you. ANSWERS FROM THE TWO DICE. Two. — A vexatious dispute, not easily settled. Three. — A merry night, followed by unpleasant consequences and expense. Four. — You have something on your mind, and the sooner you act according to the dictates of your own conscience the better, or it will be too late. Five. — You will soon have a pleasant adventure. Six. — You arc doomed to be happy in wedlock. Seven. — You will meet with a severe trouble. Eight. — If dice tell true, then peace adieu ; for you will soon in- volve yourself in a labyrinth of perplexities and trouble. Nine. — You have made a hasty promise, and do not mean to ful- fill it, but you will be compelled'^to do it, and cannot get off. Ten. — You ruin your own fortune by needless delays, and the opportunities will be lost. Eleven. — You have secret enemies, in whom you confide; but you will soon discover them. Twelve. — You will never thrive by what is called luck ; so be industrious, and that will bring you sure gain ; and perseverance will bring you wealth. ANSWERS from THE THREE DICE. Three. — A long sail on the wide ocean. Four. — Pleasure in youth, and then a sad reverse. Five. — Many changes, but a happy old age. Six. — Unhappy in love, but fortunate in other respects. Seven. — Something unpleasant is preparing for you. Eight. — A great rise in life, and soon. Nine. — Do not venture on the water for a month to Gom«.

Seventeen. — You will gain a happy establishment. Eighteen. — Long life, riches, happiness, and content. If the same throw occurs twice to one person, it foretells a height of power they could never expect. LUCKY DAYS, Etc. The day of the week on which you were born will always be the best for you to begin any business, but not to complete it ; Fridays and Tuesdays are best for women, Sundays and Mondays for men. There are three months in a year in which it is not reckoned fortunate to enter on a new house or sign a lease ; those arc April, July, and November; neither is the 11th of any month good for such projects. Let women be careful what they transact in the thirty-first year of their life, for it is to all females a year of importance, whether they are married or single ; some great change will await them, or they will lay under peril or temptation, have a great loss or great gain, go an unexpected journe3^ or, in short, something or other remarkable is to happen, and dark-complexioned women have in general this fate stronger than others. THE MOON. Lucky days for business, three first days of the moon's age ; for marriage, the 7th, 9th, and 12th ; requesting favors, 14th, 15th, and 17th, but beware the 16th and 21st ; to answer letters, if pos- sible choose an odd day of the moon ; to travel on land, choose the increase of the moon ; and to embark on the ocean, choose the de- cline. March is a fortunate month for beginning a new building ; and it is singular, but nevertheless reckoned true, that it is good to open a concert-room, a music-shop, or begin a new piece of music on the eve of St. Cecilia. It is not good to marry on your own birthday, or on any martyr s ; every other saint's day is fortunate in this concern ; neither is it fortunate for a woman to marry in colors ; let her dress be as white as possible, except ghe boa widow, then let her choose some pleasant color, but beware of green and yellow. To meet a funeral as you are going to church to tie the nuptial knot, betokens the death of your first child in its infancy."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"FOKTUNE-TELLER AND DREAM-BOOK. To meet a white horse when you are going on any particular business is a sign of success, and a piebald one, if you are going to ask a favor ; to be followed by a strange dog is lucky, especially to a man who is going courting. For a pigeon to fly into the house not belonging to it is a sign of sickne=is, and if it rests on a bed, it is death ; but two pigeons are a sign of a wedding. Never pick up an odd glove in the street; it is not fortunate. Never tell any dream before breakfast, nor any at all that you use a charm to procure, even to your most trusty friend. If you dream any dream three times, look on it as an omen or friendly warning, particularly if it regard water, traveling, or any other perilous business. It may be intended by a watchful Providence to save you from danger, so do not despise the caution. There are several remarkable instances in history — such as William the Second, the Duke of Buckingham, and many others — who might have escaped death at that time by a due attention to these warn- ings. FORTUNE-TELLING BY CARDS. In fortune-telling by cards — as in all games in which cards are employed — the Ace ranks highest in value. Then comes the King, followed by the Queen, Knave, Ten, Nine, Eight, and Seven — these being generally the only cards used. - The order and comparative value of the different suits is as fol- lows : First on the list stand \" Clubs,\" as they mostly portend hap- piness : and — no matter how numerous or how accompanied — are rarely or never of bad augury. Next come \"Hearts,\" which usually signify joy, liberality, or good temper; \"Diamonds,\" on the contrary, denote delay, quarrels, and annoyance ; and \"Spades\" — the worst suit of all — grief, sickness, and loss of money. We are, of course, speaking generally, as, in many cases, the position of cards entirely changes their signification — their indi- vidual and relative meaning being often widely different Thus, for example, the King of Hearts, the Nine of Hearts, and the Nine of Clubs, respectively signify — a liberal man, joy, and success in love; but change their position, by placing the King between the two Nines, and you would read that a man, then rich and happy, would be ere long consigned to a prison ! The individual meaning attached to the thirty-two cards em-« ployed, is as follows : — Ace of Clubs. — Signifies joy, money, or good news ; if reversed, the joy will be of brief duration. Kino of Clubs. — A frank, liberal man, fond of serving hU friends ; if reversed, he will meet with a disappointment."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"FORTUNE-TELLER AND DREAM-BOOK. Queen of Clubs. — An affectionate woman, but quick tempered and touchy ; if reversed, jealous and malicious. Knave of Clubs. — A clever and enterprising young man ; if re- versed, a harmless flirt and flatterer. Ten of Clubs. — Fortune, success, or grandeur ; reversed, want of success in some small matter. Nine of Clubs. — Unexpected gain, or a legacy ; reversed, some trifling present. Eight of Clubs. — A dark person's affections, which, if returned, will be the cause of great prosperity ; reversed, those of a fool, and attendant unhappiness if reciprocated. Seven of Clubs. — A small sum of money, or unexpectedly re- covered debt ; reversed, a smaller amount. Ace of Hearts.— A love-letter, or some pleasant news; re- versed, a friend's visit. King of Heaets. — A fair, liberal man ; reversed, will meet with disappointment. Queen of IIeaets. — A mild, amiable woman; reversed, has been crossed in love. Knave of Hearts. — A gay young bachelor, who dreams only of pleasure ; reversed, a discontented military man. Ten of Hearts. — Happiness, triumph; reversed, some slight anxiety. Nine of Hearts. — Joy, satisfaction, success ; reversed, a pass- ing chagrin. Eight of Hearts. — A fair person's affections ; reversed, indif- ference on their part. Seven of Hearts. — Pleasant thoughts, tranquillity; reversed, ennui, weariness. Ace of Diamonds. — A letter, soon to be received ; and, if the card be reversed, containing bad news. King of Diamonds. — A fair man — generally in the army — but both cunning and dangerous ; if reversed, a threatened danger, caused by machinations on his part. Queen of Diamonds. — An ill-bred, scandal-loving woman ; if reversed, she is to be greatly feared. Knave of Diamonds. — A tale-bearing serwant, or unfaithful friend ; if reversed, will be the cause of mischief. Ten of Diamonds.— A journey, or change of residence; if re- versed, it will not prove fortunate. « Nine of Diamonds. — Annoyance, delay ; if reversed, either a family or a love quarrel. Eight of Diamonds. — Love-making; if reversed, unsuccessful. Seven of Diamonds. — Satire, mockery; reversed, a foolish scandal. N.

Ace op Spades. — Pleasure ; reversed, grief, had news. King of Spades. — An envious man, an enemy, or a dishonest lawyer, who i3 to bo feared ; reversed, impotent malice. Queen op Spades. — A widow ; reversed, a dangerous and ma- licious woman. Knave op Spades. — A dark, ill-bred young man ; reversed, he is plottin-jf some mischief. Tex of Spades. — Tears, a prison; reversed, brief affliction. Nine of Spades.— Tidings of a death; if reversed, it will be some near relative. • Eight of Spades.— Approaching illness ; reversed, a marriage broken off, or offer refused. Seven of Spades. — Slight annoyances ; reversed, a foolish in- trigue. The Court cards of Hearts and Diamonds usually represent per- sons of fair complexion ; Clubs and Spades the opposite. Four Aces, coming together, or following each other, announce danger, failure in business, and sometimes imprisonment.

Two Aces. — A plot ; if reversed, it will not succeed. Four Kings. — Rewards, dignities, honors; reversed, they will be less, but sooner received.

It requires no great effort to commit these -significations to memory, but it must be remembered that they are but what the alphabet is to the printed book ; a little attention and practice, however, will soon enable the learner to form these mystic letters into words, and words into phrases ; in other language, to assemble i:hese cards together, and read the events, past and to come, their pictured faces pretend to reveal. There are several ways of doing this ; but we will give them all, one after another, so as to afford our readers an ample choice of methods of prying into futurity. No. 1. — Dealing ike Cards by Threes. — Take the pack of thirty-two selected cards (viz., the Ace, King, Queen, Knave, Ten, Nine, Eight, and Seven of each suit), having laefore lixed upon the one you in- Lend to represent yourself, supposing always you are making the '.'ssay on your own behalf. If not, it must represent the person for whom you arc acting. In doing this, it is necessary to remember that the card chosen should be according to the complexion of the chooser — King or Queen of Diamonds for a very fair person, the same of Hearts for one rather darker, Clubs for one darker still, md Spades only for one very dark indeed. The card chosen also loses its signification, and simply becomes the representative of a dark or fair man cr woman, as the case may be. This point having been settled, shufilo the cards, and either cut them or have them cut for you (according to whether you are"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"FORTUNE-TELLER AOT) DREAM-BOOK. 207 acting for yourself or another person), taking care to use the left hand. That done, turn them up by threes, and every time you find in these triplets two of the same suit — such as two Hearts, two Clubs, etc. — withdraw the highest card and place it on the table before you. If the triplet should chance to be all of the same suit, the highest card is still to be the only one \\rithdrawn ; but should it con- sist of three of the samz v:due but dlffertnt suits, such as three Kings, etc., they are to be all appropriated. We will suppose that, after having turned up the cards tiiree by three, you have been able to withdrav/ six, leaving twenty-six, which you shuffle and cut, and again turn up by threes, acting precisely as you did before, until you have obtained either thirteen, fifteen, or seventeen cards. Kecol- lect that the number must always be uneven, and that the card representing the person for whom the essay is made must make one of it. Even if the requisite thirteen, fifteen, or seventeen have been obtained, and this one has not made its appearance, the op- eration must be recommenced. Let us suppose the person whose fortune is being read to be a lady, represented by the Queen of Hearts, and that fifteen cards have been obtained and laid out — in the form of a half circle — in the order thc}^ were drawn, viz., the Seven of Clubs, the Ten of Diamonds, the Seven of Hearts, the Knave of Clubs, the King of Diamonds, the Nine of Diamonds, the Ten of Hearts, the Queen of Spades, the Eight of Hearts, the Knave of Diamonds, the Queen of Hearts, the Nine of Clubs, the Seven of Spades, the Ace of Clubs, and the Eight of Spades. Having con- sidered your cards, you will find among them two Queens, two Knaves, two tens, three sevens, two eights, and two nines ; you are, therefore, able to announce, — \"The two Queens before mo signify the re-union of friends ; the two Knaves, that there is mischief being made between tliem. These two tens denote a change of profession, which, from one of them being between two sevens, I see will not be effected without some difficulty, — the cause of which, according to these three sevens, will be illness. However, these two nines promise some small gain, resulting — so say these two eights — from a love affair.\" You now begin to count seven curds, frcm r'ght to left, beginning with the Queen of Hearts, who represents the lady you are acting for. The seventh being the King of Diamonds, you may say, — \" You often think of a fair man in uniform.\" The next seventh card (counting the King of Diamonds as one) proves to bo the Ace of Clubs ; you add, — \"You will receive from him some very joyful tidings ; he besides, intends making you a present.\" Count the Ace of Clubs as \"one,\" and proceeding to the next seventh card, the Queen of Spades, you resume, — \"A widow is endeavoring to injure you, on this very account;"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"208 FOETUNE-TELLEE AND DEEAM-BOOK. and\" (the seventh card, counting the Queen as one, being the Ten of Diamonds) \"the annoyance she pives you will oblige you to either take a journey or change your residence ; but \" (this Ten of Diamonds being imprisoned between two sevens) \"your journey or removal will meet with some obstacle.\" On proceeding to count as before, calling the Ten of Diamonds one, you will find the seventh card prove to be the Queen of Hearts herself, the person for whom you are acting, and may therefore safely conclude by saying, — \"But this you vvdll overcome of yourself, without needing any one's aid or assistance.\" Now take the two cards at either extremity of the half circle, which are, respectively, the Eight of Spades and the Seven of Clubs, imite them, and continue, — \" A sickness, which will lead to your receiving a small sum of money.\" Eepeat the same manoeuvre, which brings together the Ace of Clubs and the Ten of Diamonds, — \"Good news, which will make you decide, on taking a journey, destined to prove a very happy one, and which will occasion you to receive a sum of money.\" The next cards united, being the Seven of Spades and the Seven of Hearts, you say, — \" Tranquillity and peace of mind, followed by slight anxiety, quickly succeeded by love and happiness.\" Then come the Nine of Clubs and the Knave of Clubs, fore^ telling, — \"You will certainly receive money, through the exertions of a .clever dark young man — Queen of Hearts and King of Diamonds — which comes from the fair man in uniform ; this rencounter an- nounces some great happiness in store for you, and complete ful- fillment of your wiskes. Knave of Diamonds and Nine of Dia- monds — Although this happy result will be delayed for a time, through some fair young man, not famed for liis delicacy. Eight of Hearts and Ten of Hearts — Love, joy, and triumph. The Queen of Spades, who remains alone, is the widov/ who is endeavoring to injure you, and who finds herself abandoned by all her friends !\" Now gather up the cards you have been using, shuffle^and cut them with tlie left hand, and proceed to make them into three packs by dealing one to the left, one in the middle, and one to the right; a fourth is laid aside to form \"a surprise. ' Then continue to deal the cards to each of the three packs in turn, until their number is exhausted, when it will be found that the left-hand and middle packs contain each five cards, whilst the one on the right hand consists of only four. Now ask the person consulting you to select one of the three"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"FOBTUNE-TELLER AND DREAM-BOOK. 209 packs. Wo will suppose this to be the middle one, and that the cards comprising it are the Knave of Diamonds, the King of Dia- monds, the Seven of Spades, the Qaeen of Spades, and the Seven of Clubs. These, by roGollccting oar previous instructions regard- ing the individual and relative signification of the cards, are easily interpreted as follows : *' The Knave of Clubs — A fair young man, possessed of no deli- cacy of feeling, who seeks to injure — the King of Diamonds— a fair man in uniform — Seven of Spades — and will succeed in causing him some annoyance — the Queen of Spades — at the instigation of a spiteful woinan — Seven of Clubs — but by means of a small sum of money matters will be finally easily arranged.\" Next take up the lert-ha:id pack, which is \"for the house,\" — the former one ha\\ ing been for tlie lady herself. Supposing it to con- sist of the Queen of Hearts, the Knave of CIu'ds, the Eight of Hearts, the Nino of Diamonds, and the Ace of Clubs, they would read thus : \" Queen of Hearts — The lady whoso fortune is being told is, or soon will be, in a house — Xnavo of Clubs — where she will meet with a dark young man, v/ho — Eight of HcarLs — vvdll entreat her assistance to for.vard his interests with a fair girl — Nine of Dia- monds — lie having met with delays and disappointment — Aco of Clubs — but a letter v.nll arrive announcing the possession of money, which will remove all dilTiculties.\" The thir I pack is \"for those who did not expect it,\" and will bo compose I of four cards ; let us say the Ten of Hearts, Nino of Clubs, Eight of Spades, and Ten of Diamonds, signifying — \" The Ten of Hearts — An unexpected piece of good fortune and great happiness — Nino of Clubs — caused by an unlooked-for leg- acy — Eight of Spades — which joy may perhaps be followed by a slight sickness — Ten of Spades — the result of a fatiguing journey.\" There now remains on the table only the card intended for \"the surprise.\" This, however, must be left untouched, the other cards gathered up, shuflled, cut, and again laid out in three packs, not forgetting at the first deal to add a card to \"the surprise.\" After the different packs have been duly examined and explained, as before described, they must again bo gathered up, shuflled, etc., indeed, the whole operation repeated, after which the three cards forming \" the surprise \" are examined ; and supposing them to bo the Seven of Plearts, the Knave of Clubs, and the Queen of Spades, are to bo thus interpreted : \"Seven of Hearts — Pleasant thoughts and friendly intentions — Knave of Clubs — of a dark young man — Queen of Spades — rela- tive to a malicious dark woman, or widow, who will cause him much unhappiness.\" No. 2. — Dealing ihe Cards hy Sevens. — After having shuffled the"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"rOBTUNE-TELLEB AOT) DBEAM-BOOK. pack of thirty-two selected cards — which, as we before stated, consist of the Aco, Kin.i?, Queen, Knave, Ten, Nine, Eight, and Sev n, of each suit, — either cut t'lem yourself, or, if acting for ano her peroon, l^c that pirsoa cut them, taking care to use the le,iha A. Then count savcn cards, beginning with the one lying on tne top of the pack. The first six are useless, so put them aside, and retain only the seventh, whi( ]i is to be place:! face up- permost on the table beiore you. Repeil this three times more, then shuffle and cut the carls you hive tiirown on one side, toge her with those remaining in your liand, and tell Ihom out ia sevei s as before, im.il y )u liave thus obtained twelve cirds. It i?, htwever, indispansaV 1 i that the one representing th.) persoi whose fortune is bei ]g told should be among the number; t ere- fore, the whole operation muit le reeommeace I in case of i . n3t having made its appearance. Your t .velve e r-ls being n )vv spie id out before you in the order in which they have como to hand, you may begin to e>;plain them as described in the manner of dealing the cards in t'.irtei, — always bearing in mind both their individual and relative signification. Thus, you first couat the cards by sevens, beginning with the one representing the person for whom you are acting, going from right to left. Then take the two cards at either extremity of the line or half circle, and unite them, and afterward form the three heaps or packs and \"the surprise\" pre- cisely as we have before described. Indeed, the only difference betwf^e 1 the two methods is the manner in which the cards are oLtaine 1. Ko. 3. — Dealing the Cards hy Fifteens. — After having well shuffled and cut the cards, or, as we have before said, had them cut, deal them out in two packs, containing sixteen cards in each. Desire the per:On consulting jou. to choose one of them; lay aside the first card, to form \"the surprise;\" turn up the other fifteen, and range them in a half circle before you, going from left to right, plaeing them in the order in which they come to hand, and taking care to re nark whether the one representing the person for whom ycu are acting be among them. If not, the cards must be all gathere I up, shuffled, cut, and dealt as before, and this must be repeate I until the missing card makes its appearance in the pack chosen by the person it represents. Now proceed to explain them — first, by interpreting the meaning of any pairs, triplets, or quar- tettes among them ; then by counting them in sevens, {Toing from right to left, and beginning with the card representing the person consul iag you ; and, lastly, by taking the car'^Is at either extremity of the line and pairing them. This Ijeing done, gather up the fif- teen cards, shuffle, cut, and deal them so as to form three packs of each five cards. From each of these three packs withdraw the topmost card, a-id place them on the one laid aside to form \"the surprise,\" thus forming four packs of four cards each."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"FOETUNE-TELLEE AND DEEAM-BOOK. 211 Desire the person for whom you are acting to choose one of these packs \"for herself,\" or \"himself,\" as the case may be. Turn it up, and sjiread out the four cards it contains, from left to right, e::plaii.inpj their individual and relative signification. Next proeee I i-i like manner with the pack on your left hand, which will be \"for t ie house;\" then the third one, \"for those who do not expect it;\" and lastly, \" the surprise.\" in. order to render our meaning perfectly clear, we will give another example. Let us suppose that the pack for the person consulting you is comj^osed of the Knave of Hearts, the Ace of Diamonds, the Queen of Clubs, and the Eight of Spades reversed. By the aid of the list of meanings we have given, it will be easy to interpret them as follows : \"The Knave of Hearts is a gay young bachelor — the Ace of Dia- monds — who has written, or will very soon write, a letter — the Queen of Clubs — to a dark woman — Eight of Spades reversed — to make proposals to her, which will not be accepted.\" On looking back to the list of significations, it will be found to run thus : — Knave of Heaets. — A gay young bachelor, who thinks only of pleasure. Ace of Diamonds. — A letter, soon to be received. Queen of Clubs. — An affectionate woman, but quick tempered and touchy. EiGKT OF Spades. — If reversed, a marriage broken off, or offer refused. It will chus ])e seen that each card forms, as it were, a phrase, from an p.ssemblage of which nothing but a little practice is re- quired CO for^fi complete sentences. Of this we Vv'ill give a further example, by interpreting the signification of the three other packs — \" For the house,\" \"for those who do not expect it,\" and \"the surpribe.\" The first of these, \"for the house,\" we will suppose to consist of the Queen of Hearts, the Knave of Spades reversed, the Ace of Clubs, and the Nine of Diamonds, which reads thus : \"The Queen of Hearts is a fair woman, mild and amiable in disposition, who — Knave of Spades reversed — will be deceived by a dark, ill-bred young man — the Ace of Clubs — but she will receive some good news, which will console her — Nine of Diamonds — although it is probable that the news may bo delayed.\" The pack \"for those who do not expect it,\" consisting of the Queen of Diamonds, the King of Spades, the Ace of Hearts re- versed, and the Seven of Spades, would signify, — \"The Queen of Diamonds is a mischief-making woman — the King 01 Spades — who is in league with a dishonest lawyer — Ace of Hearts reversed — they will hold a consultation together — Seven of Spades — but the harm they will do will soon be repaired,\" Last comes \"the surprise,\" formed by, W9 will suppose, th«"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"212 FORTUNE-TELLEB AND DREAM-BOOK. Knave of Clubs, the Ten of Diamonds, the Queen of Spades, and the Nin3 of Spades, of which the interpretation is, — \"The Knave of Clubs is a clever, enterprising young man — Ten of Diamonds — about to undertake a journey — Queen of Spades — for the purpose of visiting a widow — Nine of fcpades — but one or both of their live 3 will be endangered. i\\o. 4. — The Tiven'y-cn'' Cards. — After having shuffled the thirty- two cards, and cut, or had them cut, with the left land, withdraw fr:m the pack the first eleven, and Tar them on one ; iJo. The r mainder — twenty-one i:i all — are to ho again shuffled and cut. T at done, liy the topmost car l on one side to fo:m \" ihe sur- pr:se,\" and range the remaining twenty before you, in the order in which they come to hand. Then look whether t'le car.l repre- senting the person consulting you be among them : if net, one must be withihMwn from the el eve i useless ones, and pi c) 1 at the right extremity of the row, — where it represents the missing card, no matter what it may really be. We will, however, suppose that the person wishing to make the essay is an officer in the army, and consequently represented by the King of Diamonds, and that the twenty cards ranged before j'ou are — the Queen of Diamonds, the King of Clubs, the Ten of Hearts, the Ace of Spades, the Quee 1 of Hearts reversed, the Seven of Spades, the Knave of Dia- mon Is, the Ten of Clubs, the King of Spades, the Eight of Dia- mon Is, the King of Hearts, the Nine of Clubs, the Knave of Spades rerer :ed, the Seven of Hearts, the Ten of Spade?, the King of Dia- m^nls, the Ace of Diamonds, the Seven of Clubs, the Nine of H earts, the Ace of Clubs. You now proceed to examine the cards as they lay, and perceiving that all the four Kings are there, you can predict that groat rewards await the person consulting you, and that he will gain great dignity and honor. The two Queens, cno of them reversed, announce the reunion of two sorrowfvil fiieuds ; the three Aces foretell good news ; the three Knaves, one of them reverse !, quarrels with some low person ; the three Tens, improper conduct. You now begin to explain the cards, commencing with the first on the left, viz., the Queen of Diamonds: \"The Queen of Dia- monds is a mischief-making, underbred woman — the King of Clubs — endeavoring to win the affections of a worthy and estima- ble man— Ten of Hearts — over whose scruples she will triumph — Ace of Spades — the affair will make some noise — Queen of Hearts reversed — and greatly distress a charming fair woman who loves him — Seven of Spades — but her grief will not be of long duration. Knave of Diamonds — An unfaithful servant — Ten of Clubs — will make away with a considerable sum of money — King of Spades — and will be brought to trial — Ei^ht of Diamonds — but saved from punishment through a woman's agency. King of Hearts — a fair man of liberal disposition— Nine of Clubs— will receive a larg«"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"FOETUNE-TELLEE AND DEEAM-BOOK. 213 sum of money — Knave of Spades reversed — which will expose him to the malice of a dark j'outh of coarse manners. Seven of Hearts — Pleasant thoughts, followed by — Ten of Spades — .rreat chagrin — King of Diamonds — await a man in uniform, vsJ.o is (he perso i consuting mc — Ace of Diamo:ids — but a letter he will speedily receive — Seven of Clubs — containing a small sum of moncj' — Nine of Hearts — will restore his good spirits — Ace of Clubs — which will be further augmented by some good news.\" Nov/ turn up \"the surprise\" — which we will suppose to prove the Ace of Hearts — \"a card that predicts great happiness, caused by a love-i letter, but which making up the four Aces, shows that his sudden joy will be followed by great misfortunes.\" Now gather up the cards, shuffle, cut, and form into three packs, at the first deal laying one aside to form \"the surprise.\" By the time they are all dealt out, it will be found that the two first packets are each composed of seven cards, whilst the third con- tains only six. Desire the person consulting you to select one of these, take- it up, and spread out the cards from left to right, explaining them as before described. Gather up the cards again, shuffle, cut, form into three packs (dealing one card to the surprise), and proceed as before. Repeat the whole operation once more ; then take up the three cards forming tha surprise, and you then give their interpretation. We may remark that no matter how the cards are dealt, whether by threes, sevens, fifteens, or twenty-one, when those lower than the Knave predominate, it foretells success ; if Clubs arc the most numerous, they predict gain, considerable fortune, etc. ; if pioture- cards, dignity and honor; Hearts, gladness, good news; Spades, death or sickness. These significations are necessarily very vague, and must of course be governed by the position of the cards. The Italian Method. — Take a pack composed of tliirty-two selected cards, viz., the Ace, King, Queen, Knave, Ten, Nine, Eight, and Seven of each suit. Shuffle them well, and either cut or have them cut for you, according to whether you are acting for yourself or another person. Turn up the cards by threes, and when the triplet is composed of cards of the same suit, lay it aside; when of three different suits, pass it by without withdrawing any of the three ; but when composed of two of one suit and one of another, withdraw the highest card of the two. When you have come to the end of the pack, gather up all the cards except those you have withdrawn; shuffle, cut, and again turn up by threes. Repeat this operation until you have obtained fifteen cards, which must then bo spread out before you, from left to right, in the order in which they come to hand."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"214 FOETUNE-TELLER AND BREAM-BOOK. Care must, however, be taken that the card representing the per- son making the essay is among them ; if not, the whole operation must be recommenced until the desired result is attained. We will suppose it to be some dark lady— represented by the Queen of Clubs — who is anxious to make the attempt for herself, and that the cards are laid cut in the following order from left to right : Ten of Diamonds, Queen of Clubs, Eight of Hearts, Ace of Dia- monds, Ten of Hearts, Seven of Clubs, King of Spades, Kine of Hearts, Knave of Spades, Ace of Clubs, Seven of Spades, Teu of Spades, Seven of Diamonds, Ace of Spades, Knave of Hearts. On examining them you will find there are tl;ree Aces among them, announcing good news ; but, as they are at some distance from each other, that it may be some time before the tidings arrive. The three Tens denote that the conduct of the person consulting the cards has not been always strictly correct. The two Knaves are enemies, and the three Sevens predict an illness caused by them. You now begin to count five cards, beginning with the Queen of Clubs, who represents the person consulting you. The fifth card^^ being the Seven of Clubs, announces that the lady will soon re- ceive a small sum of money. The next fifth card proving to be the Ace of Clubs, signifi.es that this money will be accompanied with very joyful tidings. Next comes the Ace ci Spades, prom- ising complete success to any projects undertaken by the person consulting the cards ; then the Ace of Hearts, followed at the proper interval by the King of Spades, showing that this good news will excite the malice of a dishonest lawyer; but the Seven of Spades coming next, announces that the annoyance he can cause will be of short duration, and that a gay, lair young man — the Knave of Hearts — will soon console her lor what she has suffered. The Ace of Diamonds tells that she will soon receive a letter from this fair young man — the Nino of Hearts — announcing a great success — Ten of Spades — but this will bo followed by some slight chagrin — Ten of Diamonds — caused by a journej- — Ten of Hearts — but it will soon pass, although— Knave of Spades — a bad, dark young man will endeaver to turn her into ridicule. The Queen of Clubs, being representative of herself, shows that it is toward her the dark young man's malice will be directed. Now take the cards at either extremity of the line, and pair them together. The two first being the Knave of Hearts and the Ten of Diamonds, you may say : \"A gay young bachelor is preparing to take a journey — Ace of Spades and Queen of Clubs — which will bring him to the presence of the lady consulting the cards, and cause her preat joy. Seven of Diamonds and Eight of Hearts — Scandal talked about a fair young girl. Seven of Spades and Ten of Hearts — Great joy"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"FOETUNE-TELLER AOT) DREAM-BOOK. 215 mingled with slight sorrow. Seven of Clubs and Ace of Clubs — — A letter promising money. Knave of Spades and King of Spades — The winning of a lawsuit. The Nine of Hearts, being the one <!ard left, promises complete success.\" Now gather up the cards, shuffle, cut, and deal them out in five packs — one for the lady herself, one for \"the house,\" one for \"those who do not expect it,\" one for \"those who do expect it,\" and one for \"the surprise\" in the first deal, for \"consolation.\" The rest are then equally distributed among the other five packs, which will four of them contain three cards, while the last only consists of two. We will suppose the first packet, for the lady herself, to be com- posed of the Ace of Diamonds, the Seven of Clubs, and the Ten of Hearts. The interpretation would read thus : \" Ace of Diamonds — A letter will be shortly received — Seven of Clubs — announcing the arrival of a small sum of money — Ten of Hearts — and containing some very joyful tidings.\" The second pack, for \"the house,\" containing the King of Spades, the Nine of Hearts, and the Knave of Spades : \"The person consulting the cards will r.^ceive a visit — King of Spades — from a lawyer — Nine of Hearts — which will greatly de- light — Knave of Spades — a dark, ill-disposed young man.\" The third pack, for \"those who do not expect it,\" composed of the Ace of Spades, the Knave of Hearts, and the Ace of Clubs, would read : \" Ace of Spades — Pleasure in store for — Knave of Hearts — a gay young bachelor — Ace of Clubs — by means of money ; but as the Knave of Hearts is placed between two Aces, it is evident that he runs a great risk of being imprisoned ; and from the two cards signifying respectively ' pleasure ' and 'money,' that it will be for having run into debt.\" \"The fourth pack, for \"those who do expect it,\" containing the Eight of Hearts, the Queen of Clubs, and the Ten of Diamonds : \" The Eight of Hearts — The love affairs of a fair young girl will oblige — the Queen of Clubs — the person consulting the cards — Ten of Diamonds — to take a journey.\" The fifth pack, for \"the surprise,\" consists of the Seven of Spades and the Ten of Spades, meaning : \"Seven of Spades — Slight trouble — Ten of Spades — caused by Bome person's imprisonment — the card of consolation. Seven of Diamonds — which will turn out to have been a mere report.\" Present, Pasf, and Future. — The person wishing to try her fortune in this manner (we will suppose her to be a young, fair person, represented by the Eight of Hearts), must well shufile, and cut with the left hand, the pack of thirty-two cards ; after which she must lay aside the topmost and undermost cards, to form the sur-"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"216 FOKTUNE-TELLER AND DEEAM-BOOK. prise. There will now remain thirty cards, which must be dealt out in three parcels — one to the leit, one in the middle, and one to the right. The left-hand pack represents the Past ; the middle, the Present ; and the one on the right hand, the Future. She must commence with the ' ' Past,\" which we will suppose to contain these ten cards : The King of Clubs, the Ace of Spades, the Knave of Diamonds, the Nine of Diamonds, the Ace of Hearts, the linave of Hearts, the Queen of Hearts, the King of Spades, the Knave of Clubs, and the King of Hearts. She would rem.ark that picture-cards predominating was a favorable sign, also that the presence of three Kings proved that powerful persons were interesiirg themselves in her ailairs. The three Knaves, however, warn her to beware of false friends, and the Nine of Diamonds predicts some great annoyance overcome by some good and amiable person represented by the Queen of Hearts. The two Aces also give notice of a plot. Taking the cards in the order they lay, the explanation would run thus : \" The King of Clubs— A frank, open-hearted man — Ace of Spades — fond of gaj-ety and pleasure, is disliked by — Knave of Diamonds — a young man in uniform — Nine of Diamonds — who seeks to injure him. The Ace of Hearts — A love-letter — Knave of Hearts — from a gay young bachelor to a fair, amiable woman — Queen of Hearts — causes — King of Spades — a lawyer to endeavor to injure a clever — Knave of Clubs — enterprising young man, who is saved from him by— King of Hearts — a good and powerful man. Never- theless, as the Knave of Clubs is placed between two similar cards, he has run great risk of being imprisoned through the machinations of his enemy.\" The second parcel, \"the Present,\" containing the Ten of Dia- monds, the Nine of Spades, the Eight of Spades, the Queen of Diamonds, the Queen of Clubs, the Eight of Hearts, the Seven of Spades, the Ten of Spades, the Eight of' Diamonds, signifies : \"The Ten of Diamonds — A voyage or journey, at that moment taking place — Nine of Spades — caused by the death or dangerous illness of some one — Eight of Spades — whose state will occasion great grief — Queen of Diamonds — to a fair woman.

Let the party stand in a circle, and, the bag being handed around, each draw three cards. Pairs of any are favorable omens of some good fortune about to occur to the party, and gets back from the pool the sum that each agreed to pay. The king of hearts is here made the god of love, and claims double, and gives a, faithful swain to the fair one who has the good fortune to draw him ; if Yenus, the queen of hearts, is with him, it is the conquering prize, and clears the pool ; fives and nines are reckoned crosses and misfortunes, and pay a forfeit of the sum agreed on to the pool, beside the usual stipend at each new game ; three nines at one draw shows the lady v/ill be an old maid ; and three fives, a bad husband. Good and Bad Omens. — The word omen is well known to signify a sign, good or bad, or a prognostic. It may be defined to be that indication of something future whicn vro get as it were by accident, and without seeking for. A superstitious regard to omens seems anciently to have made very considerable additions to the common load of infelicity. They are in these enlightened days pretty gen- erally disregarded, and we look back with perfect security and in- difference on those trivial and truly ridiculous accidents which al- ternately afforded matter of joy and sorrow to our ancestors. Omens appear to have been so numerous, that we must despair of ever being able to recover one-half of them ; and to evince that in all ages men have been self-tcrmentors, the bad omens fill a cata- logue infinitely more extensive than that of the good. An exten- sive set of omens has been taken from what first happens to one, or what animal or person one meets first in the morning, or at the commencement of an undertaking — the first-foot, as it is called."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"218 FORTUNE-TELLER AND DREAM-BOOK. To stumble has universally been held to presage misfortune. Some semblance of a reason might be found for this belief, inas- much as stumbling may be supposed to indicate that that self-pos- session and conscious courage, which arc in themselves half a vic- tory over circumstances, are lacking — the Vv'antof them, therefore, being hrJf a defeat ; but in most cases the interpretation seems al- together arbitrary. The dread of a hare crossing the path seems to be widely prevalent ; while to see a wolf is a good omen. This feeling is probably a remnant of war-like times, when the timid hare suggested thoughts of cov^-ardice and flight ; while the bold wolf-, sacred to Odin, was emblematic of victory. The character of the hare for being unlucky is also connected with the deep- rooted belief that witches arc in the habit of transforming them- selves into hares. That to meet an old woman is unlucky, is an- other very general belief; arising, without doubt, from the same causes that led to their being considered witches. In some places women in general are unlucky as first-foot, with the singular ex- ception of women of bad reputation. This belief prevailed as far back as the age of Chrysostom. Priests, too, are ominous of evil. If hunters of old met a priest or friar, they coupled up their hounds and went home in despair of any further sport that day. This superstition seems to have died out, except in the case of sailors, who still consider the clergy a \" kittle cargo,\" as a Scotch skipper expressed it, and anticipate a storm or mischance when they have a black coat on board. This seems as old as the Prophet Jonah. Sneezing, likewise, has long been looked upon as supernatural, for this reason, that it is sud- den, unaccountable, uncontrollable, and therefore ominous. The person is considered as possessed for the time, and a form of ex- orcism is used. A nurse would not think she ha.d done her duty, if, when her charge sneezes, she did not say, \"Bless the child,\" just as the Greeks, more than tvvo thousand years ago, were in the in- variable habit of saying, \"Zeus protect thee.\" One general remark, however, it is important to make in regard to omens. A.n omen is not conceived to be a mere sign of what is destined to be — it is conceived as causing, in some mysterious way, the event it forebodes ; and the consequence, it is thought, may be prevented by some counteracting charm. Thus the spill- ing of salt not only forebodes strife, but strife is conceived as the consequence of the spilling of the salt, and may be hindered by taking up the spilled salt, and throvving it over the left shoulder. Perhaps half the superstitious beliefs that yet survive among civi- lized and Christian communities frroup themselves round the sub- ject of love and marriage — of sucli very ijiter.se interest to all, yet so mysterious in its origin, and problematic in its issue. The lik- ing or passion for one individual, rather thrin any other, is so un- ftccoimtable, that the god of lovo has been fabled blind ; it is of"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"rOKTUNE-TELLER AND DEEAM-BOOK. 219 the nature of fascination, magic, spell. And then, whether happi- ness or the reverse shall be the result, seems beyond the reach of ordinary calculation. All is apparently given over to mystery, chance, fortune ; and any circumstances may, for what we know, influence or indicate what fortune's wheel shall bring round. Hence the innumerable ways of prognosticating which of two or more persons shall be first married, who or what manner of per- son shall be the future husband or wife, the number of children, etc. It is generally at particular seasons, as at the Eve of St. Agnes, and Halloween, that the veil of the future may bo thus lifted. The observation of lucky and unlucky days v/as once an impor- tant matter, and was often the turning point of great events. It is now mostly confined to the one subject of marriage. In fixing the wedding-day, May among months and Friday among days aro shunned by many people, both in educated and uneducated circles ; for in this matter, which is the exclusive province of women, and in which sentiment and fancy are in every way so much more active than reason, the educated and uneducated are reduced to a level. A Book of Precedents, published in London in IGIG, contains a Calendar, many of the days in which have the letter B afiQxed, which signifieth such days as the Egyptians note to be danger- ous to begin or take anything in hand, as to take a journey or any such like thing.\" The ancients thought that some hours in the day were fatal to life, and modern testimony corroborates this theory. A writer in the ' Quarterly Review,' having ascertained the hour of death in 2,880 instances of all ages, has arrived at this conclusion : \" The maximum of death is from 5 to G o'clock, A. M., when it is 40 per cent, above the average ; the next, during the hour before mid- night, when it is 25 per cent, in excess ; a third hour of excess is that from 9 to 10 o'clock in the morning, being 17A per cent, above. From 10 A. M. to 3 P. M. the deaths are less numerous, being 16 per cent, below the average, the hour before noon being the most fatal. From 3 o'clock P .M. to 7 P. M., the deaths rise to 5 per cent, above the average, and then fall from that hour to 11 P. M., averaging G per cent, below the mean. During the hours from 9 to 11 o'clock in the evening there i*s a minimum of G per cent, be- low the average. Thus the least mortality is during midday hours — namely, from 10 to 3 o'clock ; the greatest during early morning hours, from 3 to G o'clock.\" •'Nail gifts\" aro white specks on the finger-nails; which, ac- cording to their respective situations, are believed to predict cer- tain events, as indicated in the following couplet, which is repeated while touching the thumb and each finger in succession : A gift, a friend, a foe, A lover to come, a journey to go."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"220 FOETUNE-TEIXER AND DEEAM-BOOK.
