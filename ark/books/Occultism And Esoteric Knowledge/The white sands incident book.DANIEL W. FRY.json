FRY Illustrated In loving gratitude to Alan and all our other extra-terrestrial friends , who came to help us in our time of need. ABOUT THE A UTHOR DANIEL W. FRY was born in Verdon, Minnesota (a small steamboat landing on the Mississippi Riv er, in the northe rn part of Aitken County ). The date of his birth was July 19, 19 08. He was left an orphan at the age of nine, and from that time until he reached the age of sev enteen, he was reared under the guardians hip of his ma ternal grandmother , with whom he came to California in 1920. There was little to distinguis h his child hood and early youth from that of an y other normal American boy except, perhaps , that his cr aving for knowledge (especially 2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"scient ific knowl edge) was out of all proportion to the nat ural curiosity of the y oung boy. His parents ha d left practica lly no estate and at the age of eighteen, he found himself entirely dependen t upon his own resources. He c ompleted his high school tr aining and attempted to go on to college, but because of the great depression which w as then causin g a despe rate competition for all types of emplo yment, he found it impossible to support hi mself while at tendin g school. Realizing t hat he migh t nev er have the opportun ity of ma triculat ion at a recogniz ed seat of learning , he thereupon instituted a nigh t school class of one in t he textbook an d reference section of the Pasadena Public Libr ary. Here he spent most of his evenings for sev eral years, studyin g the same sub jects whic h he would have been taki ng if he had been able to attend a coll ege or univ ersity . He became especially interested in the chemistry and use of explosiv es, with t he result that he became an explosiv es technicia n and blaster. He follo wed this trade until it eventua lly led him into the field of rock etry. He was married in Pasadena in 1934, and has ha d a ha ppy and peaceful domestic life, marr ed only by the nec essity of frequent mo ving which w as required in the pursu it of his profession. They hav e thre e children, one son an d two da ughters. Mr. Fry has been employ ed for the pas t five tears by Aer ojet General Corporation, the world's largest developers and manufac turers of r ocket engine. Durin g the years of 19 40 and 1950, Mr. Fry spent most of his time at the Whi te Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico , wher e he w as engaged in settin g up instrumenta tion for the test ing of a se ries of v ery large motors. PUBLISHER'S NOTE At a t ime when people ev erywher e are bec oming conscious of the existence of other people from other w orlds and when men of ea rth are about to realize their age- old dream of in terplanetary tr avel, it is most ti mely to learn from a competen t observ er just what it takes to understan d the meaning and purpose of the persistent visits to our atmosp here of Fly ing Saucers and extra-terrestria l people. It takes considerable cour age and dete rmination to relate an inci dent which m ay seem incredible to the a verage person who has no correspon ding expe rience with which to compare it , especially if one's r eputation , posi tion and livelihood are at stake. The White Sa nds Incident would perhaps never have become publi cly known had not Daniel W. Fry re alized the vita l need of the world for jus t the kind of information the extra-terrestrial people ha d given him. Yielding to the urgency of the si tuation he has at last (after four y ears of silence) revealed his astoundi ng experience which includes a ride in a rem ote-controlled space shi p from Whi te Sands to New Y ork and return in approximately 30 minu tes, whic h rep resents a spe ed of some 8 000 miles an hour . Were it not for the fact that Mr. Fry is a hi ghly trained technicia n and rocket expe rt fully con versant with all the scientific import and value of his unusua l experi ence, one migh t wonder if he had cor rectly obse rved or interpreted all the fac ts. It is extremely fortunate that there can be no q uestion of Mr . Fry's competence to accur ately observ e and ev aluate facts . His daily occupa tion requires this faculty in the highest degr ee. While Mr. Fry is a self -made ma n what he lacks in academic educat ion is amply compensa ted for by his innate fitness for scient ific and technological study and research. It is to th is younger generation of technici ans, enginee rs and p hysicis ts 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"that civilization must look for its future adv ancement , for they are less ham pered by the stereotyped and out-moded concepts of a by e-gone d ay.

FRANKLIN THOMAS The White Sands Incident White Sands Proving Grounds , July 4, 1950. Tonigh t I joined the ranks of t he F. S. B. (Flying Saucer Believers). Not only have I seen on e, I hav e touched it, ente red it, and ridden in it. Also, if I can st ill trust my senses, I have commu nicated at some leng th with t he op erators. Now that it has gone, and I am back in my quarters, it seems more and more incredib le that it could really have hap pened. Wit h all the scient ific brain and ta lent that is available at White Sands Proving Grounds, why should I , a sim ple techni cian, be chosen, either by chance or design , to be the first human of the present day earth, to ride in a true space v ehicle? The improbabil ity of the event is so great that I have almost begun to doubt my own sanity . Naturally, if I were to attemp t to convince anyone els e that I rod e in a \"saucer\" toni ght, I would soon find myself occupyi ng a nicely pa dded cell in the nearest Booby Hatch . Still this is the gr eatest event in my life, an d I can't k eep it entirely to m yself, so I am writing this down exactly as it hap pened while it is still sharp and clear in m y memo ry. 15 This being the Fourth of J uly, I had intended to go in to Las Cruc es to se e the fireworks di splay and perhaps do a lit tle cel ebrating on m y own. Owing to a bi t of misinformation on bus schedules, I missed the last bus into town and found myself stranded in an almost deserted arm y cam p with nothi ng whatev er to do ex cept sit in my room and read (a textbook on heat transfer , by Cork). At about seven thirty in the ev ening, the blowe r on the air condi tioning system quit operating, as it does every few da ys, and always when the weather is especially hot. 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"By eigh t-thirty it was unbear ably hot and stuffy in m y room, and I decided to take a walk in the hope that it would be cool er outsi de. I started down the back road which goes by the stat ic test stand near the base of the Organ Moun tains and ends up in El Paso, some sixty miles to the south. Before reaching the test stand area, howev er, I turned off to t he right on a small dirt road which goes pas t the rifle r ange and on into the flats at the base of the Organ Mountai ns. I had gone abou t half a mi le past the rifle r ange on this road when I first saw it. The sun had been down for s ome t ime, an d there w as practically no da ylight left, but the sky was brigh t with stars, and the moon, though not yet above the ho rizon, was 16 produci ng considerable diff used lig ht in the sky. As I look ed up at a group of especially brigh t stars hangi ng just over the peaks of the mountai ns, one of t he stars suddenly went out. This, of course, im mediately riveted my attention on tha t spot , for stars don't .just go out, (not in a cloudless sky anyway). At first I though t that a passing plane ha d cut off the light, but even with t he thoug ht, I knew it couldn' t be that, for a mo ving plane would requir e less than a second to pass a given spot , and the star starred out. Also, in the silence of t he des ert area around the pro ving grounds at night, a plane could be heard muc h farther t han it could be se en, and there w as no sound at all. No weather balloons wer e sent up at nig ht, and a weather balloon would be rising quite rapidly: therefore it would only eclipse a star fo r a few seconds. Then another star ju st to the righ t went out, and a few seconds later two more just below. By this time a strong prickli ng sensation w as traveling up my spine. Whatev er it was tha t was cutting off the lig ht of the stars. was increasing rapidly in apparent size and since the bearing remained consta nt, it could only mean t hat it was comin g directly toward me. Then final ly I saw it and at the same ti me realized why I had not been able to se e it soone r. It's color appear ed to be so neatly that of the night sky that even when it was quite close it was diff icult to see 17 anything but the outline. It was still coming toward me, and I felt a strong inclination to run, but long expe rience in blast ing and rocket work had taug ht me that it is foolish to run from an approaching missile until you are sure of it s trajectory; since you are jus t as likely to run into it, as aw ay from it . Also , you ha ve no chance to judge it s trajectory while y ou are runnin g. The object was now very close, and I could see. th at it was an ovate sp heroid about thirty fe et in diameter at t he equator or largest part. It was now tr aveling at not more than fifteen or twenty miles per hour and seemed to be decel erating at a rate that would bring it to zero v elocity by the time it reached the ground . I could also see that unless it cha nged course, it would miss me by at least fifty feet. Somewhat reassur ed by its slowness of motion, I remained wher e I was and watched it glide in as lightly as a bit of thi stle down floating in the bre eze and settle to t he gr ound abou t seventy feet aw ay withou t the sligh test bump or jar. Except for the cr acklin g of brus h beneath it, it hadn' t made a sound. For perhaps twenty or thirty seconds I stood starin g at it like a chi ld at his first circus performance. I have been wo rking for some y ears in the field of rock et and othe r missile development , and through my work and connections at Whi te Sands , I had though t that I was fairly well acquain ted wit h most 18 of the developmen ts in the aircr aft field. But here w as a cr aft so far adv anced o ver anything I had ever hea rd of, that I felt like the backwoods farmer wh o, on first seeing a giraffe, said, \"Well I see it, but I don't believ e it.\" My first conscious though t was, \"if the Russia ns hav e ships like this, God help America!\" But with the thou ght came t he realization that this could not be a craft from R ussia , or an ywher e else on 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"earth for tha t matter; for who ever had built this craft ha d solv ed a lot of problems of which our best physicis ts are only begin ning to dream. The ship's operation was silent . Ther e had been no thrum ming of propelle rs, no flash and roar of inca ndescent gases being hurled from noz zles to produce t hrust. The ship had simp ly coasted quietly in from the \"great blue yonder\" and sett led gentl y to earth. Perhaps that was the answe r. The craft had been coming down since I first saw it. Perhaps it was jus t gliding in; but before landin g it had slow ed down to only a few miles per hour and had shown no evidence of falli ng. Only a helicopter o r a \"lighter than air cr aft\" could do this , but there we re no propelle r blades whatev er on this vehicle, and the fac t that the brush was crushed fla t under it when it settled to the ground pro ved conclusively that this was no \"lig hter tha n air\" cr aft. Wha tever this vehicle was and whatev er else it could do, it could 19 certainly play \"hob\" wit h Sir Isaac Newton's best known law. Suddenly I realiz ed that while all this had been going through my min d, I had been unconsc iously approaching the shi p. I am not and have never been a her o. Every instinct and bit of reas on I had shouted that I shoul d be pu tting as much distance as possib le betwe en myself and this unknown, an d therefo re unpredic table, device. Unfortu nately , I hav e alw ays been cursed with an overactive curiosity , and when the object of tha t curiosity is of a scient ific nature, especially an important advance in science, the curiosity becomes a ma nia whic h swe eps all reason befo re it. I approached with in a few feet of t he craft and t hen began slowly circlin g about it. It was as it had ap peared from t he air , a sp heroid, consider ably flattened at the top and bottom so tha t the vertical di mension w as about six teen feet. while t he ho rizontal diamete r was about thirty feet at the widest point , which was abou t seven feet above the ground. Its curvature w as such that if view ed from below, at an angle of less than 45 degr ees from the v ertical , it mig ht appear to be saucer -shaped, althoug h it was sha ped mor e like a soup bowl inverted o ver a sauce dis h. The dark blue color which it appear ed to hav e when I had first seen it in the air , was gone now. It was just a polished metal surface, silver 20 color, with what seemed to be a very slight violet iridescence. I walked completely around the cr aft without seeing any sign of opening or seams. \"If there is an yone inside,\" I though t, \"they mus t get in through the top or bottom .\" I paused t hen, to tak e stock of the sit uation . What should I do next? Should I return to the base and report the adv ent of the cr aft? This, at first , seem ed the logical thing to do, but then anot her though t intervened. It would take at least three quarters of an hour fo r me to get back to the base, fin d someone in au thority , and return with other obse rvers. What if the cr aft tool: off in the meantime? The re would be not hing but a crumpled patch of brush to subs tantiate m y story . Who would believe me? If any one did believe, who w ould dare to adm it it? I ha d read enough of the ridicule heaped upon those who ha d been incau tious enough to ad mit having seen some unexp lained objects fly ing in the air . How much worse w ould be t he lot of one who claimed to hav e seen one land and to hav e been close enough to touc h it, yet had no proof ex cept a flattened patch of brush! This t hought reminded me t hat; although I had been close en ough to touch t he craft for sev eral min utes, I had not, as yet, actually done so . Perhaps I could learn somethin g abou t the material of which it was made by the feel. At any rate I could tell the temper ature. I step ped for ward and gingerly 21 placed a fin ger tip to the polis hed metal . It was only a few degrees abo ve the air temper ature, and it was incredibly smooth. It is diffic ult to describe the degree of smoothness . If you we re to run y our fi nger o ver a large pearl which ha d been 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"covered with a thi n soap film y ou migh t receive a sensation somewhat similar to that which I felt when I touched the metal . I strok ed the metal with the pal m. of m y han d and felt a sligh t but definite t ingling in m y finger ti ps an d the heel of m y palm . Then a crisp voice came out of t he air at my side, \"Better not touch the hull , pal, it's still hot!\" I had not realized how much tension I w as under unti l the voice suddenly shattered the silence. I leaped backw ards several feet, catchi ng my heel in a low bush and sprawling at full length in the sand . I heard someth ing that sounded like a low chuckle and then the v oice came again in a some what friendlier tone, \"Take it easy , pal, you're among friends .\" The humil iation of m y ungraceful posture, combi ned with the mil d tone of the v oice and its famili ar phr ases, served to sweep aw ay all the fear which I had felt an d replaced it with a mil d irritation . I arose brushi ng off my clothes and tugging at a sand burr which had found a home in m y hair. \"You could have turned t he volume down,\" I grumb led. \"You didn' t hav e to blas t out at me lik e tha t. You scared me out of a w eek's growth.\" 22 \"Blast out?\" the v oice hesita ted. \"Oh yes, you mean the amp litude of the w arning was too great. Sorry, buddy, but you we re about to kill yourself and there wasn't time to did dle with controls.\" \"You mean that the hull is high ly radioac tive?\" I ask ed. \"If so , I am stil l muc h too close.\" \"It isn't radioacti ve,\" w as the reply. \"I used the term `hot' because it was the best I could think of in your lang uage to explai n the condition . The hull has a field abou t it which repels all other mat ter. The field is very powe rful at molecular dista nces bu t diminishes by the seventh powe r of the dista nce so tha t the force becomes negligi ble a few microns away from the hull . Perhaps you noticed that the surface seem ed very smooth and slippery . That is because your flesh did not ac tually touch the metal but was held a short di stance from the surface by t he repuls ion of the field. We use t he field to protect t he hull from being scratched or dama ged in landi ng. It also low ers air frict ion tremendously when it is nec essary to travel at hi gh speed through an atmospher e.\" \"But how would this kill me?\" I asked. \"I did touch the hull and felt only a slig ht tingle in my hand and wha t did you mean, by that crack about my language? If y ou aren't a Yank, I never heard one.\" \"As to your first question,\" the v oice replied im perturbably, \"it wouldn't have killed you at once. 23 In fact, it migh t have taken several months, but it would h ave been jus t as certain as if it had been ins tantaneous. The best way tha t I can explai n it to you is to sa y that exposure of the hum an ski n to the fo rce field causes the skin to produce what you call `antibodies' in the blood stream. For some r eason whic h we don't y et fully understand, these ant ibodies are absorbed by the liv er, whose func tion they attac k causi ng the liv er to become greatly enlarged and conges ted. In cases wher e the skin is exposed to the field for a minu te or more death is practically certain. In your case, I don't th ink you ha ve been exposed long enough to be in an y great da nger; although you will undoub tedly feel some effects soone r or later , provided , of course, that your biological functions are identical with ours and we have every re ason to believ e tha t they ar e. \"As to your sec ond quest ion, I am not , as you call it, a `Yank'; although my present assignment requires me to become one. The fact that you believed me to be one of your country men, is a testi monial to the success of the effo rt I hav e exp ended durin g the last two of y our y ears to lea rn and practice t he use of y our langu age and idiom. 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"As a mat ter of fact, I hav e nev er yet set foot upon your planet . It will require at least four mor e of your years for me to become adap ted to your atmospher e and gr avity and to become immu nized to your biotics.\" 24 I stood silently for what seemed a long time but was probably only a few seconds, attempti ng to digest the fu ll meanin g and implicat ion of th is speech. At last I said slowly , \"If I ha d not with my own ey es, se en this craft come in and land, I would have said that you we re some nut who had been readin g too man y `science fiction' stories. As it is, I am prepared to admit the possi bility of almost anything. Besides, since my being here and seeing you land was entir ely accident al, it is obvious t hat my belief or disbelief could not be of the sligh test importance to you.\" \"On t he contr ary,\" replied the voice. \"It is importan t to us th at you be giv en every opportun ity to acquain t yourself wit h the facts and to form your own opinion according ly. One of t he principa l purposes of t his expedi tion is to determine the bas ic adaptability of the ea rth race, particularly the degre e of their ability to ada pt their minds quickly and calmly to conceptions which are completely foreign to their customary modes of thou ght. Previous expedi tions by our ancesto rs met with almost total failure in this respect . This time there is hope t hat we may be able to find mind s sufficiently receptive so tha t we ma y be of som e assistance in the progress of y our race. In your case, at least up to the pres ent moment . your conduc t has surpassed our best expecta tions.\" 25 \"I can se e,\" I said , \"that your race, what ever it is, and ours has at least one thing in common; that sarcasm is the principal form of humor . Howev er, you can't anno y me that way. I've been kid ded by experts. \"I realize tha t everything I hav e done since y ou first came in to sigh t, has been wrong. In the first place, if I had any sense, I would hav e gotten out of her e fast when I first saw y ou comin g, instead of waiting, perhaps to be crushed under the ship. When you lan ded, instead of leaving, or at least remain ing at a comparatively safe dis tance, I had to come snooping around your cr aft. Then, when y our w arning voice came t hrough your speak er-or whatev er it is-instead of accepti ng the w arning calmly and quickly, I jumped like a scared r abbit and landed in the sand in about as undignified a position as it is possible to imagi ne. Last , but not least, you apparent ly suppose that I believ e the statements which you ha ve made. As I sai d befor e. I am prepared to consider the possibility that they ar e true. I am also prepar ed to consider the possibility that they ar e a lot of `ho oey.' \" \"Precisely ,\" replied the voice. \"Let me explain my posit ion. No sarcasm was intended . I meant exactl y what I said . In the first place you said that curiosity im pelled y ou to investigate the cr aft, subjecti ng yourself to unknown hazards rather than to 26 seek safety in flight. This typifies the strug gle betwe en the desire fo r knowledge and the desir e for the safety of the stat us quo. I believe that there is an old saying among your people tha t self-pres ervation is the first law of na ture. It is encour aging to note that the desire fo r knowl edge can occasionally overcome the animal instinct. When I called a warning to you, your reaction w as not one of fea r as you se em to think. A reaction of pure f ear would have froz en you into immobilit y at least for a moment . Instead, you acted insta ntly and in the pr oper man ner. The fact that you stumbled merely in dicates that your concentr ation on the details of the ship was so great that you failed to main tain a clear a venue of retr eat. \"As for believin g what I say, mer ely because I say it , that is the last thing which we desire. What we ne ed are min ds suf ficientl y open to rec eive evidence (ev en though that evidence be contrary to all preconceiv ed opinion) and minds sufficien tly agile to assim ilate that evidence and arrive at logical conclusions. The fact that in sp ite of 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"being in circumsta nces completely unique in your expe rience, you ar e listening calmly to my voice and makin g logica l replies, is the best evidence that your min d is of the type w e hoped to find .\" \"Thanks for the complimen ts,\" I said . \"I wish I could believ e that I deserv ed them, but your st atement 27 implied t hat you propos e to use me in sore pr oject which involves the scientific advancement of the people of ea rth. Why pick me? Just because by t he me rest accident I happened to be her e when y ou landed. I could easily p ut you in touch wit h any one of dozens of men right here at the base, who ar e far more adv anced than I in science.\" Basic laws \"When y ou say that you hap pen to be here by the merest acci dent, you greatly underestima te us,\" was the reply. \"The br ains of many earth men transmi t readily , but you are one of the v ery few whos e brain also receiv es well. If you inqu ire when you return to your quarters, you will dis cover that the air condi tionin g sys tem did not break down tonigh t although it has frequently done so in t he past . But to get bac k to the subject of discu ssion, we hav e investigated the min ds of ma ny of y our top scient ists. In every case we found that their min ds ha d hardened into the mould of their present concep tions. They have adv anced too far . Consequentl y they would have too far to ret reat. I can make my meaning plainer by an analogy . A man seeking scientific knowledge is lik e an ant climbing a tree. He knows when he is moving upward, but his vis ion is too short to encompass the entire trunk. The r esult is that he is lik ely to get out on a lower limb without realizing that he has left t he main trunk . All goes well for a time. He can still climb upward and ev en plu ck 28 a few of the fruits of his progress, bu t soon he begin s to become confused as the solid branch suddenl y begin s to break u p into myriads of twigs and leaves all poin ting in different directions . So the se eker of knowl edge finds that the gr eat `Basic Laws' which have always been so uns hakeable, now begin to divide and to point in opposite directions . The scientis t comes to t he conclusion that he is nearing the lim it of the knowledge which can be conc eived by the mind and that all physical laws ult imately become purely sta tistical. When he has reached this point he can mak e furt her progress only by following a line of abstr act mathemati cal reasoning. This is like traveling on a tr ain in one of y our su bways. You will probably eventually arrive at your desti nation , but since you cannot see wher e you are goin g along the w ay, you have no w ay of bein g sure tha t there was not a much shorte r and easie r way to get to the same place. Your science is now in this position . For example, your scientist is now obliged to sta te tha t the electron is at the same time both a particle and a wave motion . They attem pt to rationaliz e this by sa ying that the electr on is a particle in a wave of probab ility. This is a condition which cannot be visualiz ed by the mind and the only means of progress ar e through the subw ays of abs tract mathema tics. \"The funda mental truths are always sim ple and understan dable when viewed from the proper perspectiv e. 29 So the br anch becom es simple an d understandable as a `br anch' when view ed from above on the main trunk . In short, what y our science mus t do if it is to continue to progress, is to go back down the limb on which you are trapped to the poin t wher e it joins the mai n trun k and then start up aga in This we can and will help your pe ople to do, but only if they wish it and are able to follow the pa th which we will point out. 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"This, however, is for the future. Before we can be of an y assista nce to the people of earth, two thi ngs must be accomplis hed. First: Our bodies mus t become biologicall y adapted to your en vironmen t, so that when we come among you we will be identical with your people. This as I said befor e will require at least four mor e years. The second condi tion is mor e difficult. The poli tical tensions which now exist betwe en your na tions mus t be eased.

This cargo cr aft is being used to bring us sam ples of y our atmos phere so tha t we can accus tom ourselv es to it . The cargo hold is evacuated so that when I open t he intak e port, the hold becom es filled wit h atmospher e at whatev er temper ature and pressur e exists there. Also an y bacteria which are in the air ar e brought along for stu dy an d for the produc tion of an titoxins. The intake port is on the top of the cr aft. I will open it now.\" 31 I heard a sound which w as partly a hiss and part ly a murmur which came from the top of the shi p. It las ted for about fifteen seconds. I was surpris ed at the small volume of the sound . Any port large enough to ha ve filled a ship that size with air in fifteen seconds should have produced quite a roa r. Then I realized that the hul l was almost , if not entirely , sound- proof and since most of the sound of t he ente ring air would have been produced inside t he hull , very lit tle would be audible outside. Then I heard a single click come from the surface of the ship , a small but sharp click such as mi ght have come from the operation of a sin gle arm rela y or a small solenoid, and a portion of the hull just to m y left, moved back upon itself for a distance of sev eral inc hes and then mo ved sidew ays, disappearing into the wall of the hull, leaving an oval sha ped opening about five feet in height and three feet wide. I mo ved over to t he port or hatch , whichev er it migh t be called, and du cking my head sli ghtly, advanced into the opening. Because of the curvature of the hu ll of course, m y head w as ins ide the craft while my feet were still on the ground. The compartment into which I was looking occupied only a small portion of the ship's volume. It was a ro om about nine fe et deep and seven feet wide, with the floor about sixteen inches abo ve the ground and t he ceiling sligh tly over six feet above 32 the floor. The w alls were slightly curv ed and t he intersections of t he walls we re beveled so tha t there we re no sharp angles or co rners. Of course, t he wall near est me, through which t he op ening led, was the hull itself and ha d the same curv ature 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"inside and out. This w all was about four inc hes thic k and it was into this wall tha t the door o r hatch had been dr awn. The room contained four s eats which looked much like our modern `body contour chairs' ex cept that they we re some what smal ler than the ones to which we ar e accustomed. The seats were facing the openin g in which I was standing and we re arr anged in two ro ws of two e ach in the center of the ro om, leaving an aisle between the seats and either wall. In the center of the rea r wall, wher e it joined the ceilin g, there was a box or cabinet with a tube and lens which resembled a small moving picture pr ojector , except that there w ere no visible film spools or any other mo ving parts. Light was comin g from this lens. It was not a beam of lig ht such as would come fr om a mo ving picture projector but a diffused glow which, while it did not seem especially bright still furnis hed enough light for comfo rtable se eing. The seats and the light seemed to be the only furnishi ngs in the otherwise bare metal room. \"Not a very in viting cabin ,\" I though t, \"looks more like a cell.\" 33 \"As I said before; it's plai n, but you'll fi nd the seat comfortable,\" said the v oice. \"Step in and ta ke a seat if you wish to ride. W e don't have too muc h time.\" Almost au tomatica lly I stepped up on to the floor of the cabi n and started for one of the seats. Before I reached it , I heard a click as the door began to slide out of its recess in the wall behind me. Ins tinctively, I half turned as thou gh to leap out to the compar ative safety of t he op en desert behind me, bu t the do or was already closed. If this was a trap, I was in it now an d there w as no use strug gling aga inst the inevitable. \"Wher e would you lik e to go?\" came t he voice again , and this time it did not seem to be comin g from beside me b ut rather fr om inside me, as thou gh I were hearing words which I myself were speaking. \"I don't know how far y ou can tak e me in the time y ou have,\" I replied . \"And since this compart ment has no windows, it won't matter whic h way we go, as I won't be able to see anything.\" \"You will be able to see,\" w as the reply. \"At least as much as you could see from any vehicle in the air at night. If you would like a sug gestion we can take you to New York City an d return y ou here in abou t thirty minu tes. The lig ht pattern of New York City at nig ht from about twenty miles up has always been 34 to us one of the most impressiv e sigh ts to be se en on your planet.\" \"To New York-and bac k-in thirty minu tes!\" I said. \"That's eight thousa nd miles per hour! How can you produce energies of tha t order on a craft lik e this, and how can I stand the acceler ation? Y ou don't even have seat belts on t hese seats !\" \"You won't feel an y ill effects from the acceler ation,\" was the reply . \"In fact , you won't feel the acceleration at all . Just take a seat, and I will start the cr aft. I will explai n some of the t hings which puzzle you, durin g the ride.\" I sat down in the left front seat which was the one nea rest the doo r and foun d tha t it was indeed very comforta ble. The material of which it was made felt like foam rubber with a vinylite covering . Howev er, there were no seams or joints such as an oute r covering would requir e, so the ma terial, whatev er it was, probab ly had been moulded into its frame in a single oper ation. Then the voice brok e into my thou ghts again. \"I will now turn off the compartment light and turn on t he viewing beam.\" For a moment the ro om became utterly dark . Then the projector agai n became active. This time it was not a diff used glow , but a beam-j ust as in a mo vie or slide projector . The beam, or that part of 35 1 1"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"it which was visib le at all , was a deep violet, at the very top of the visible spectru m, The beam spread over the door, throug h which I had come, an d the door disappeared. I t did not slide back into the w all as it had befor e. It simply ceased to exist, at least vis ually. It was as thou gh I were lo oking through the finest type of plate glass or Luci te windo w. \"There isn't time to giv e you a complete understa nding of all the th ings which you would like to know abou t this craft and about us, but perhaps I can explai n a few of the basic principles about which y ou seem to be curious,\" the voice said---or rather my voice said- --for I was jus t begin ning to realiz e that the words which I had been hearing were not coming to m y ears as sound waves at all but rather we re origina ting directly in m y brain. Transparent do or \"The do or, as you se e, has become tr ansparent. This start les you, because y ou ar e accus tomed to thinki ng of metals as being completely opaque. However, ordinary glass is just as dense as many metals and harder than most and y et transm its light quite readily . The beam of en ergy, which is now actin g on the metal of t he do or, is what you would call a frequency multiplier . The beam penetr ates the metal and acts upon any light that reaches it in such a way that the frequency of the lig ht is multiplied to that of the r ange between what you know as the \"X -ray\" and the \"Cosmic R ay\" spectrums. At these 36 frequencies the waves pass through the metal quite readily . Then, when t hese waves leave the metal on the inside of the doo r, they aga in interact with t he viewing beam, produci ng what y ou would call `beat' frequencies which are identica l with the origina l frequencies of the light, so that while y ou are apparently seeing throug h the metal you are actu ally seeing a rep roduc tion. If you are ready I will now start the cr aft.\" Instinctively, I braced myself in the seat and grip ped the sides with my hands. A moment later, the ground sud denly fell away from the shi p with incredible rapidity . I say that the gr ound `fell aw ay' because I did not feel the sli ghtest sense of motion myself, and the shi p was as steady as a rock. In spite of the fact that we must have been acceler ating at the r ate of at least ten g's, I could have sworn tha t we w ere standing still. The ligh ts of t he arm y base at the Proving Grounds, which had been hi dden by a small hill, sprang into sig ht insta ntly and began drawing together lik e a flock of baby chicks when called by the mother hen. A few s econds later the li ghts of the town of Las Cruces came into view in the lower left han d corne r of the window , and I knew that we had risen at least a thousand feet in those two or three s econds . The ship was rotati ng slightly to my left as it rose, and I was also able to see the hi ghway 37 from Las Cruces to El Paso, a very narrow but brillia nt ribbon ill umina ted by the headli ghts of the thousands of cars tha t were upon it. The ligh ts of El Paso and Ciuda d Juarez were jus t a solid glow on t he ho rizon, but as we contin ued to rise, they seemed to draw nearer and to break up into patc hes of v aried brilli ancy. I could see the pat ch whic h rep resented t he Pr esidio ar ea, the hu ndreds of t housands of lights of Fort Bliss, and t he intensely bright spot which w as downtown El Paso. I even imagined that I could distinguish the thi n dark line which was the Rio G rande separ ating El Paso from its Mexican twin, Ciudad Juarez. A few more sec onds and the ship had rotated un til the lig hts of these cities passed out of view on the righ t han d edge of the viewing scre en. 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The viewing screen w as now pointed southeast and had stopped revolving . The surface of t he earth now appeared to be glowin g with a slightly gre enish phosp horescence. At the same time, the sky outside of the ship had become mu ch darker, and the st ars se emed to ha ve doub led in brilliance. \"We must have ente red the stratosphere,\" I though t. \"If so , we must have risen more than ten miles in what can't have been mor e than fifteen or twenty seconds, yet I have not felt the slig htest sensation of acceler ation.\" 38 \"You are now about thirteen miles above the surface,\" I heard the voice say. \"And you are rising at appro ximately one-half mile per s econd . We have brought you up rather slowly so that you could have a better opportunity to view y our local ci ties from the air. We will tak e you up to thirty -five miles for the ho rizontal flight. At th at level the residual atmosp here is attenua ted to a degr ee which offers no ap preciab le resistance to the motion of the cr aft.\" \"By the way,\" I sai d. \"What ha ppened to the moon ? It was just coming up when I enter ed your ship , and it mus t be somewher e in the sky , but everything looks so dark outside.\" \"It looks dark,\" was the reply , \"sim ply because ther e is not suf ficient atmosp here at this lev el to diffuse t he ligh t. You would not see any evidence of the moonlig ht unless it were shini ng directly on t he viewing scre en. I have purposely kept the craft from rotatin g far enough for this to hap pen, as the lig ht is qui te intense above the atmospher e, and it would be diffic ult, if not im possible to see an ything else while it was vis ible. You ar e now hi gh enough that I can begin to ad d a substa ntial horiz ontal component to your v ertical motion. \"Since ther e will be lit tle of interest to see durin g the next few minu tes, I will ta ke this time to explain a few of the thing s that puzzle you. In the first pl ace; y ou mentioned something about `seat belts' and ques tioned 39 whether y ou could endure the acceler ation. This is a question which seems to have come up quite frequent ly in the mi nds of the men of science of y our pla net. \"Whenev er our v ehicles have been obse rved by an y of your pe ople, and when the velocities and acceler ations of these cr aft are described, disbelief is alw ays apparent . We have heard some of y our most learn ed men mak e the statement that: `No human being or othe r higher form of life, as we know it could surviv e acceler ation of this orde r.' This has alw ays been a ma tter of disap pointment to us in our evaluation of the intelligence of the people of ea rth. It seems to us that even a moder ately intelligent lay man with t he average knowledge which you people possess should be able to refute this statement a once. The answer is, of course, sim ply that the force which acceler ates the v ehicle, acts, not only upon every atom of the v ehicle i tself bu t also ac ts equall y upon every atom of mass which is within it, including the pilot or passen gers. \"In your airplane the situa tion is entir ely different. You ha ve propellers or jets, which produce a thrust upon one part of the shi p. This local thrus t accelerates t he ship but not the pilot . The pilot is acceler ated only by thrust agains t those parts of his body which are in contac t with the seat. Because of the inertia of the remainder of the body, compression 40 is produced which causes the feeling of acceler ation, or in extreme cases, black out or actual crushing of the body . Our only lim it of acceleration is the limit of available force.\" \"But in this case,\" I thoug ht, \"why am I not floatin g around in the air as thi ngs are supposed to do within a missile which is in fre e fall?” 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"\"The answe r to this also should be fairly obvious,\" w as the reply. \"Before the ship was put into motion , you were resting upon the seat, and there was a force of one gravity ac ting betwe en your body an d the seat. Since the force which acceler ates both the ship and y our body acts in exact propo rtion to the mass, and since the earth's gr avity continues to act u pon both , the original force betwe en your body and the seat will remain constant, except that it will decreas e as the force of gr avity of the planet decreases with dista nce. \"When tr aveling betwe en planetary bodies, far from an y sourc e of natur al gravity, we find it necessar y, for pr actica l reas ons, to repr oduce this force artific ially. The gravity to which we ar e accus tomed is but little mor e than one-hal f of th at which exists upon the earth. This is the princ ipal reason th at it will take so muc h time fo r us to become ordinary members of y our race. If we w ere to land now upon t he surface of y our planet and leave the protection of our ships , the high gravitationa l force would put 41 a severe strain upon our internal organs , which in a few da ys would produce seri ous illness, an d eventuall y death . This is not merely calcu lation . We know it to be true because i t has been tried sev eral times in the past. By remain ing in our shi ps wher e we can control the fo rce to which we ar e subjected, and by increasing that force by small but regular increments , we can bu ild up the supporti ng tissues an d streng then our muscu lar systems until, eventually, your gr avity will become as natur al to use as our own is now . \"When t his time comes, it is our hope tha t you and a few othe r members of y our race, who have retained suff iciently open min ds, will be able to assist us in bridg ing the considerable gul f which exists between our cul ture and yours.

Any knowledge o r assistance which we can gi ve will be fre ely offered.\" 42 \"Could you explain to me the principles of operation of this craft?\" I asked. \"How do you produce the tremendous amoun ts of energy necessary to acceler ate a shi p like this to such hi gh velocit ies, an d how do y ou apply that ene rgy without producin g any outward evidence of its ap plication?\" Nuclear Submarin e \"In order to do th is\" was the reply, \"I would have to give you an entirely new groundwork in Basic Ph ysics. As I said before, y our science is attemp ting to mak e one low er limb take the place of t he entir e tree of knowledge, with t he result that your science has becom e greatly overcomplicated . Then, when this science is app lied to practical ends, the resultin g apparatus becomes prohibit ively complex . For example: Certain engineers and scientist s of y our country are now engaged in planning a submarine to be driv en by what y ou call atomic or nuclear en ergy. They plan to do this by construc ting a `pile' in which t he ligh ter isotope of ur anium fissions produci ng heat energy and free neutrons which are absorbed by. the heavier isotope of uranium converting it into the next heavier el ement in the transur anic series which also, in turn, is fissionable.

If they achiev e an overall efficiency of t hirty per cent it will be a great feat of engineering. \"If they we re capa ble of thi nking in simpler terms, they could , with the knowl edge which they now possess, construct a sim ple thermopile abou t the fission pi le and convert the resulting temper ature gr adien t directly into electric energy wit h an efficiency of at least ninety -four to ninety -eight per cent, with no mo ving parts, at a smaller cost , and consider ably less mass per unit of en ergy output . Compared wit h our methods , even this system would seem w astefully complex. \"Your greatest need is to disco ver the utter sim plicity of the basi c laws or facts of nature. Then y ou will easily be able to produce eff ects which now se em to you to be impossible. \"When y our engineers design a vehicle for tr ansportation of freight or passengers, they feel it necessary to pro vide a means of produci ng an en ergy differ ential within the vehicle itself as a moti ve pow er. Yet your ancesto rs, for thousan ds of y ears traveled to all parts of your planet in shi ps which had no internal energy source but which were op erated 44 entirely by the kinet ic ene rgy of the at mospher e. While th is was not always a reliable source, it was suffi ciently successful that it should have made y our people r ealize that there are man y types of en ergy differ ential constantly available and it is only necessary to desig n a means whereby the flow of energy can be made to produce the desir ed result. Matter and energy \"One of the princ ipal obstacles to the r apid progr ess of your science is tha t your scient ists have not yet ful ly grasped the simple un ity of ma tter and energy. One of your greatest thinkers, a prof essor, Albert Einstein, published, many years ago, the mathematica l formula which described quan titatively the equiv alence of matter and energy. This formula , while perfectly correct mathematical ly, leads to the incor rect conclus ion, that matter is convertible in to en ergy and vice versa. The truth is tha t matter and energy are me rely differ ent aspects of the same entity . \"Consider a geometric plane surface ha ving two dimensions. If this plane is perpendicu lar to y our line of sight you perceiv e it as a plane surface. This repr esents the matter aspect of the entity . If now y ou rotate the pl ane through an angle of ninety degr ees, the surface will disappear from y our sig ht, leaving only one dimension. This is the energy aspec t of the entity. You ha ve not changed the pla ne in any way. You ha ve merely chan ged y our point of 45 view, or technicall y you have chan ged y our poin t of ref erenc e. The amount of en ergy which is ap parently contained by a gi ven body of matter depends entirely upon how far it has rotated upon the mass energy axis with respect to the given observ er. Another observer, obse rving the same body from a differ ent reference point, would find an entirely different amount of energy conta ined. Assume that we have an observ er upon each of two pla nets which are traveling through space at , say half of 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"the speed of ligh t, but which are traveling at exactl y the same spe ed and upon parallel cours es. If no other bodies of matter existed in the universe, the observers would, inevita bly, come to the conclus ion tha t their r espectiv e planets had no kinetic energy, since the only ref erence points available ar e at the same en ergy level. If we now postu late a third planet, and assume t hat it is at rest in space, both observers will note tha t, while their re specti ve planets have no kinetic energy relativ e to each other, they both have a very hi gh energy with respect to the third body . There would still be no means of determinin g which of the bodies were actually moving. It could only be dete rmined tha t there was a relativ e motion or an ene rgy differential between them. \"Anot her clue which your Dr. Einstein brought to light through abstr act mathemati cal reasoning was that: As a body of mat ter increases in velocity , its 46 dimension decr eases in the direction of motion. When the body reach es the v elocity of light, it ceas es to ha ve any dimension in the direction of motion. This, of course, is because i t has rotated upon the mass energy axis, relative to tha t observ er, until it has ceas ed to be mat ter and has become pure en ergy. Thus y ou will see that it requires 9x 10 20 ergs of ene rgy to acceler ate one gr am of mass to the spe ed of ligh t. Since at this velocity it ceases to be matter , it is obvious tha t no amoun t of energy could further increase its velocity with respect to the giv en reference poin t. \"How ever, there will be time enough for furt her discussions of ph ysics later . Since this is principa lly a sigh t-seeing tour, I shoul d be poin ting out the sigh ts to you. \"The large city to the north of y ou is Sain t Louis, and the glow on t he ho rizon dead ahead is Cincin nati. You will be o ver it in less th an two minutes, and soon after y ou will be able to see the lig hts of Pit tsburg h. \"You see tha t we ha ve learned a great deal of y our geogr aphy as well as y our language.

Due to our eastw ard travel, I knew tha t the moon must now be almost directly overhead, but the surface of the earth gave little evidence of i ts refl ected light. The greenish phos phorescence which I had seen when rising in Ne w Mexico , had almos t disappeared. I have nev er hea rd any estimate of t he earth's albedo , but, judging from its almost total darkness at this level, I think that the reflectivit y of the land areas at least, must be very low. Of course it was only moonlig ht I was judging by, and I was not nearly far enough from the ea rth's surface to form an y true estima te of the albedo . The ligh ts of Cinci nnati were almost underneath me no w. There were too many lights, and they were too close together to distin guish man y of them indiv idually. The gener al effect was that of looking down upon a bonfire, which had burned down to a bed of bright coals, with a few much brighter point s which flashed and sparkled lik e rhinestones in a spotl ight. Of course Cincinna ti was not t he only city visible from t his point. At an al titude of thirty-five miles the line of sigh t becomes v ery long, and even in the restricted area of the viewing scre en, I could see, 48 at any one time, li terally hu ndreds of v arious size \"embers,\" sparkles and pin-points of light, all repres enting human habitations, enterprises or guidi ng beac ons. 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"\"You will be over New York City in a few minu tes,\" I heard myself sa y. \"And I am going to begi n to bring y ou down to the twenty mile lev el.

This you ha ve the ability to do , an ability which is remarkable in one of y our race. \"In fact it was through this ability that I first made contact with your mind. It was three nigh ts ago. You had returned to your bed but found it diffic ult to sle ep because the pressure of the events of the day had been unus ually great. You made use of a menta l device which was very interesting to me because of 55 its simp licity and effectiveness. Do y ou remembe r what it was?\" \"Oh y es,\" I said . \"I use it often when sleep doesn't come r eadily . I simply visual ize a room which is completely dark except for ten lum inous numer als on t he far w all of the room.

I then begin , one by one to erase the numerals, k eeping my mind focused upon the remaining ones, bu t lowe ring the degre e of concentr ation with each erasure. I usually fall asleep while ther e are stil l several num bers to go, but in no case ha ve I ever remained conscious more than a few sec onds after t he last one is gone.\" \"Exac tly,\" Alan replied . \"And not only does this process relax the conscious mi nd but it also returns all extraneous thoug hts to their proper place in the fili ng cabinet of the unconsc ious portion of the min d. Under these conditions the unconscious mind transmits and receiv es much more readily than the conscious mind ever does. \"I should, perhaps, be ashamed to admi t it, but in your case the tempta tion w as too great to resist, and I am afr aid that I ransack ed your mi nd as pe rhaps no mi nd has ever been r ansac ked befor e.

I had no dif ficulty in visualizin g the luminous numer als on the area of the viewing screen, but when I attempted to ex clude t he doz ens of questions which were beat ing an insi stent tattoo upon the fringe of m y consciousness , I found it practically impossi ble.

It is essenti ally a stor age ba ttery which is capa ble of being charged from any of a number of nat ural energy dif ferential s which may be available. By the word `charged,' I merely mean that a poten tial differ ence is created betwe en two poles of t he accumul ator. The material of t he poles has a vailable free electrons in quantities bey ond anything of which you could conceiv e. The control mechanism allows t hese electrons to flow t hrough the two fo rce rings which you se e at the top and bottom of the cr aft. You ar e 59 familiar enough with electrodynami cs to know that a mo ving electron cr eates a magnetic field. The tremendous surge of electrons throug h the force rings produces a very strong magnetic field. Since the direction and am plitude of flow can be controlled t hrough either ring , and in several paths through a `single' ring , we can produce a field which is in opposition or in conjunc tion with an y mag netic field throug h which we wish to tr avel. This also giv es us control of the attitude of t he craft with respect to the given field . Magnetic Field Propulsion \"All bodies of ma tter which are in motion hav e magnet ic fields about them for the reason just given: that all mat ter contains electrons and all electrons in motion produce ma gnetic fields.

I had been through steep di ves and sharp p ull-outs in airplanes, and have ridden in ma ny amu sement devices calc ulated to produce the feeling of weightlessness, but had never felt anything like this before. The re was no sensat ion of falli ng. It simply felt as thoug h my organs , having been rel eased from a heavy strain, were springin g upw ard like elastic bands, when released from tension. Fortunately this sensation was of short duration. In a few seconds I felt almost normal again . 62 \"I don't feel v ery weightless now ,\" I though t, and pushed down sharply with my hands on either side of the seat. I ros e in a slow and more or less gr aceful sweep, almost to the ceiling of the compartmen t.

The result was tha t I came to rest wit h my knees in the chair and my eyes only a few inches from the back cushion. It was then that I saw somethin g which I had overlooked when I had first enter ed the ship. It was only a simple desig n imprinted in the material of the seat, but I recognized the sym bol and the recognition must have produced a powe rful mental shock wave which Alan misinterpreted for fea r or pain , for the gravity was immed iately normaliz ed, causi ng me to expe rience another rough moment as m y organs all attempted to occupy t he space normally assigned to m y intesti nes. \"What is it?\" I heard Alan's voice, an d for the first time there seemed to be a defin ite trace of concern. Then-\"Oh, I see you hav e noticed the symbol and recogniz ed its significa nce.\" 63 \"Yes,\" I said. \"Anyone who has ever read to an y extent would recogniz e the symbol of the tree and the serpent.

FRY \"IT IS EASIER T O RIDICULE THAN T O INVESTIGA TE, BUT IT IS NO T AS PROFIT ABLE.\" --Alan. FOREWORD Ever since the pub lication of the Whi te Sand s Inci dent we hav e been besieged by the public for furt her information from t he same sourc e. Finally we hav e prevailed upon Mr. Fry--who is a v ery bus y man -to make written repo rt of his su bsequent contact with ALAN of t he extr a-terr estrial group . This he has done, and the conten t of Al an's Message to the People of Earth is so filled with information of vital signi ficance to mankind, and partic ularly to the people of our time, that we ha ve decided to rel ease it to you just as we ha ve received it, with no attem pt to enlarge o r embellish it in an y way, and with but very little commen t from Mr . Fry. While it thus becomes a v ery small book which may be quick ly read, it will be found to be powe r-packed. Every sentence is vital and there are no unnecessary wo rds. We are sure Mr. Fry could have written at great length of the wisdom of his extra- terrestrial friend; but he has prefe rred to let the message speak for itself. Those who have hea rd Mr. Fry in lecture hall s or on r adio or television progr ams, will realiz e that his only concern is that the people understa nd the urgency of t he message and the wisdom revealed by his extr a-terrestrial friends . 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"7 In the y ears which follow ed Daniel W . Fry's first encounter with the extr a-terrestrial people and their spacecr aft, many other people ha ve come forw ard to relate experi ences which confirm the pres ence of people from other w orlds, with in our atmospher e if not upon our e arth. While many attemp ts at communic ation have been made by the space pe ople, they have not always been successful. In recent months, however, there ha ve been a few instances of contacts and commu nication with extraterrestrial people in widely separated parts of the wo rld which corrobor ate Dan Fry's expe rience both as to method of rec eption and the content of the message. It seems quite obvious by now t hat from whatev er place they come the extr a-terrestrials hav e a simi lar message for the people of our time. As this book goes to press ther e has jus t come in to our hands a most remarkable commu nication of this kind. It is from Austria an d is written in German bu t we ar e translating it into Eng lish for the benefit of t hose who have read the Whi te Sands Incident or hav e hea rd Alan's Message to Men of Eart h direct from the lips of Mr . Fry, but who may hav e felt t hat he stands alone and unsu pported in his clai ms, or that the ordinary form of telepath y may have been inv olved. Other recent contac ts, besides the one in 8 Austria , have shown clearly th at there is a mode of communic ation, far superior to ordinary telepa thy, in use by our extra-terrestrial friends wher eby the v oice of the commu nicator is heard within one's own head in a sort of clair audience which i t is not possib le to confuse wit h the telepathic reception of though ts and ideas from another person or with t hought s or impressions arising withi n one's o wn mind from subconscious lev els. With this type of commu nication it matters not if the min d wanders or if other thoughts pass through the min d, for the v oice still remains strong and clear, and is not in the least dis turbed by your fleeting thoug hts and questions. We have been so intrigued with t his aspect of the experience of Mr . Fry and several others tha t we have made in quiry in to the mode of reception wher ever messages from people of other wo rlds are bein g received. We are con vinced we a re confronted wit h a true clairaudience and are approaching the in dependent voice which the scientific investigator longs to encounter . The r ecent contact in northern Canada has been considered by some to be a bi t fantastic, but becomes more compr ehensi ble and acceptab le the moment we realiz e that the three huge \"spacemen\" may have been w earing space sui ts! However the fact that 9 the badly frightened and uneducated Italian lad also st ated that the spacema n did not speak to hi m from the outside, but actual ly wit hin his head , lends more credibilit y to genu ineness of the encounter t han any detail related. This young man had never heard of \"flying saucers\" and certainly he had nev er read about spacemen, extra-senso ry perception , telepat hy, clairaudience, independent voice or voice-in - head phenomena. This fact alone giv es it the appear ance of a v ery real expe rience. In the case of Mr . Von Cihlar of Vien na he w as ma de to comprehend exactly what the man from Mars wished to say to him, although he is con vinced the man uttered no sound and probably did not speak German an yway. Accordin g to Mr. Fry i t is entirely possible t hat the extr a-terrestrial people ma y have an electronic device capable of modulating the audi tory ne rve currents in such a way that speech may be hea rd by us althoug h no one is speaki ng within range of our Bearing. That this is easily possible is evidenced by the fact that the ear is not essential to hearing, nor is sound for that matter. Any electronics engineer can easily 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"set up a device whereby the hu man body as a whol e may become a r adio receiving set with t he ne rves carrying the modu lated current which will 10 in consequence be hea rd as sound and interpreted as speech. As their scientific knowledge is quite eviden tly much superi or to ours, this type of communi cation shoul d pres ent no di fficulty to them, b ut it is also entirely possible that they are so far bey ond us in science tha t they ma y have discovered a way to modulate our nerv e currents or br ain waves directly without the need of in tervening electronic ga dgets. Perhaps they ha ve learned how to activate som e dorman t or lit tle used br ain cells which open up these ne w, or at least li ttle used , facu lties. In view of t he fact that we find frequent references to t he third eye in the commu nications comin g from the people of other w orlds, it is not unlik ely that they have also made this disco very. In no other w ay can we hope to account for s ome of t he thin gs contained in the text of the messages r eceiv ed. This particularly applies to the knowledge of the rem ote pas t exhib ited by Alan in his Message to Men of Earth , and in his abi lity to probe t he working of Dan's mind as narrated in The White Sands Inci dent , and then t here is t he prophetic aspect of th is contac t, and in fac t of all the other contact s, which im plies the poss ession of a superior faculty of insig ht and intuition at least in regard to the future of mank ind. 11 Clearly we ha ve her e to deal with unus ually highl y dev eloped type of in dividuals , in all probability not of the rank and file of the inha bitants of othe r worlds or planets , but rather the most advanced indivi duals of their sphere of life, beings similar in many resp ects to t hose usually denominated Masters when ap pearing amon g men. At least they certainly' manifest some of the accompl ishments of Adep tship. At all events they hav e achiev ed a mastery o ver space tr avel, mag netics, gravitation and other scientif ic ma tters, not likely to be possess ed by the rank and file of t heir people any more than our adv ances in nuclear ph ysics are understood by average la yman. Because w e are privileged to receiv e a vita l and spirit ual message from such advanced an d perfected beings , delivered wit h clear and prophetic ins ight, it behoo ves us to giv e heed while t here is yet time to change the trend of ev ents. In this way yet may perhaps avoid the pit fall from which only Michael and his angels could save us by direct interv ention. An ever-increasin g number of ou r people un becoming uneasy o ver the ap parently impending fulfillment of prophecy and the imminent dun Pr of another wo rld war-this time of a most destructiv e sort. The dev elopmen t of nuc lear weapons, guided missiles, nerv e gases, and bacterial w arfare does not 12 help to alla y the suspicion that we ma y be on the v erge of a w ar of exte rmina tion instead of mer ely self-pres ervation and freedom. So it comes almost as an answe r to our prayers and fondes t hopes, that in all contac ts with t he extr a-terr estrial people, throug h whatev er chan nel they reach us , the cheerful view prevails, and they assure us th at the greatly feared catas trophe may be a verted if we will bu t heed their oft repeated warnings. But it has remained for Daniel W . Fry and his extr a-terrestrial friends to tell us exactly what is the problem confronti ng humanity and exactly how it may be solv ed. But most importan t of all just what we may do to help prev ent the impend ing world war and world confla gration, which threatens to bring about t he doom of our e ra of civ ilization. The situa tion is so se rious that it becomes necessary to mak e an at tempt to alert all thinking people to the dangerous trend of ev ents while there is ti me to tak e correctiv e measures, and so find the w ay to peac e. It is obvious, however, that there can be no lasti ng peac e until there is mut ual trust and un derstandi ng among na tions and a willi ngness to live and let liv e.

FRANKLIN THOMAS 14 ALAN'S MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE OF EARTH INTRO DUCTIO N For the benefit of those who ha ve not y et read THE WHITE SANDS INCIDEN T, some explana tion should be made as to the sourc e of this message, and the means of its delivery. For the pas t seven years, as ev ery reade r knows, our ne wspa pers and magazines, our radio an d television stations have carried count less stories conce rning the sighting of v arious objects, usuall y in the air , but occasionally upon the ground, whose appear ance an d whose actions do not cor respond to an y pattern with which we ar e fam iliar upon this earth. To man y persons, these objects are still classified as unknown . The re are even a few who, in spite of t he overwhelmin g mass of evidence, sti ll dog matica lly assert that these objects \"cannot exist.\" Some reputab le scientis ts, after casual investigation , have dismissed these phenomena as \"meaning less.\" Many others ha ve dismissed them without any pretense of in vestigation . On the othe r hand, there is a large an d ever growing group of people whose intense interest, and whos e realization of t he tremendous import of these 17 visitations , have given them the en ergy and the patience to gather an d to examine minutely, all of t he available da ta. To every one of t hese persons, three facts become evident beyond any reas onable doubt . First, that these objects are real. They do exist. Second, that they ar e extra-terrestrial , being far abo ve and bey ond anything with which we are famili ar on ea rth. Third, that they ar e guided by intell igence, an intelligence obviously greate r than our own, althoug h we ma y not alw ays be able to fathom its purpose or follo w its workings. 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The book called THE WHITE SANDS INCIDENT , IS the fact ual and object ive account of an experience which the write r has had with one of these extraterrestrial cr aft, and the establishmen t of commu nication with the gu iding intelligence.

There w as a sense of urgency in this contac t which had not been present during our pr evious meetings.

There is a saying in the rec ords of the previous civil ization of y our world which I believ e shoul d be on t he frontispiece of ev ery book of philosoph y. \"It is easie r to ridicule tha n to investiga te, but it is not as profitable.\" Yes, you will be called a liar by some and a fool by others.

In the first pla ce ther e is the psychological aspect. If we we re to appear as membe rs of a superior race, comin g from abo ve to lead the people of y our world, 23 about thirty perc ent of these people w ould insist upon considering us as Gods, and would attemp t to place upon us, all responsibility for their own w elfare.

No Land ing on the White House Lawn \"From t he pr actical sta ndpoin t, you know as well as we that if we w ere to land our craft near the seat of your governmen t, we would immediately be surr ounded an d taken in charge by those mil itary forces whos e duty it is to protect the heads of your government from any possible dan ger. We would be questioned for hours, perhaps days befor e any request which we might mak e would even be giv en consideration. We would be forced to di splay our superio rity in the realm of the material science. Once thi s superiority had been demonstr ated, the military leade rs would inevita bly adopt the position that it was imper ative that their coun try acquire an d `pr otect' this advanced scien tific knowl edge. The atti tude of your go vernmen t, in common with the governments of other adv anced nations of your planet toda y, is that all new knowledge, particul arly scienti fic knowledge, is the prop erty of t he state. 24 This is not t he fault of an y indiv idual or political faction , but is simpl y a philosophism of government which developed during the las t two great wars upon your ea rth. It was given muc h impet us in your country by the necessary secr ecy attendi ng the development of your nuclear weapons. Howev er the sec recy of mil itary `security' has now grown far bey ond the boun ds of its reason, and has become, in man y cases, only an ex cuse to conceal an ything which mi ght embarr ass an y membe r of your governin g bodies.

Its existence is not the fault of an y race, creed or political faction, but is purely the re sult of na tural tendencies. It is an extremely simp le problem, and like most simple th ings, its importa nce has been o verlooked by too many of y our people. Al so, like all simple problems, the solu tion is inher ent in the complete understandi ng of the problem. In orde r that you ma y understan d it thoroughly , I will sta te it in the simplest possible terms. Three Branches of Science \"There are three types or br anches of science which are nec essary for the pr oper development of manki nd: the S piritual Science, the Social Science and the Physical or Material Science. The spiritual and social sciences mu st come first . Ther e can be no dev elopment of the ma terial science unless there first exists a foundat ion of the spiritual and social sciences. You can pro ve this to yourself by considering 27 the differ ence between man and the anim als. The animal has no spiri tual or social science and consequently has never dev eloped a ma terial science. A few of y our insects such as the ant and t he be e have dev eloped a rudi mentary form of social science to the extent that they are able to live together in large numbers, work together for their mu tual welfare, and hav e a form of disci pline which is common to all. As a result of this they also hav e dev eloped a very limi ted material science, in that they do er ect struct ures, and store food aga inst a future time of need. The fact , howev er, that they h ave no spirit ual scienc e has pro ven an absolute bar to further development with the re sult that they hav e not ad vanced a single: step in thousa nds of years. \"Mank ind, on t he othe r hand, has, from the v ery begin ning of his developmen t, sensed t he fact that there is a su preme powe r and in telligence which perv ades and controls all nature. Man's attitude tow ard this power has v aried from fear and resentment, to rev erenc e and lo ve, but always he has had t he desir e to learn more of the nature of thi s powe r. Thus the sp iritual science had its beginnin g in the v ery dawn of hu man intelligence. With the realization th at man could impro ve the 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"condi tions of his life only by co-oper ation, came the first trib al gatherings which wer e the beginni ng of the social science. 28 \"From t he founda tion pro vided by these two sciences the superstruct ure of the material science began to em erge, an d her e begins the problem. The dev elopment of the material science, being constantly stimulated by the ev er increasing needs and desires of the body , progr esses normally according to the square of time. This to o, you can pro ve to y ourself if you consider the inventions and material dev elopments which have taken place within the las t thirty of y our y ears, compare them with the development of the previous one hun dred years and then compare tha t in turn, with the previous one thousand years. Y ou will see at once that the development of the material science tak es pla ce at a rate which is constan tly accel erating. The spiritua l and social sciences on the other hand , progress normally; only directly with time, and even this rate of progr ess is not always maintai ned. \"You now hav e the problem of a huge an d massi ve struct ure, growing at an ev er increasing rate, stand ing upon, and supported only by a foundation which is growing at a muc h smaller r ate. It is obvious that unless some means are found to sti mulate greatly the growth of the founda tion, a time will inevit ably come when the struc ture will collapse upon that founda tion, bringi ng ruin and destruction to both . This has occurr ed before upon your earth, and your 29 civilization has now ente red the stage where it is likely to occur again. \"Your race is now in constan t dan ger of total destruction by an agency which it has itself produced. Why shoul d a people be menaced by their own creations? Sim ply because t hey ha ve not progr essed far en ough in the spiri tual and social sciences to enable t hem to determine t he uses to which their creations shal l be pu t. \"Most of the th inkers of y our race ar e well aw are of the danger inher ent in the use of nuclear weapons, but there is another aspect of the problem which is not gener ally recognized. That is the fact that unless unity is achiev ed between y our nat ions, the very existence of such weapons will eventua lly bring about t he downfall of your civilization, even though they are nev er used. The trut h of th is fac t can he understood by an yone who will think a little. Civilizations are built and maint ained by men of vision, who think and work for the fu ture. What man will be willi ng to dedica te his life and his work to the benefit of gener ations yet un born, when the foreseeable: fu ture do es not extend beyond the next twenty -four hours ? \"Already many articles ha ve appear ed in your newspapers an d magazines, commenti ng upon t he rapid rise of wha t they describe as ju venile delinq uency . Some writers place the blame upon the 30 parents , some upon the schools, othe rs blame the church or the sta te. Ac tually none of these agencies are especially at fau lt. The c ondition is due principal ly to the fact that youth is partic ularly sensi tive to a condition of insecurity , (any of your psychologists will verify th is) and never in the history of your race has the fu ture been less secure. \"It has been p ublicl y stated by one of y our hi ghest governmen t officia ls, that the political and military tension between y our go vernment and the go vernment of Russia may continue at its present level for the next forty y ears.

No civilizat ion which the uni verse has yet produced could endure un der these conditions .\" \"I think I understand the problem now ,\" I sai d. \"But what about the solution?

Hardly! You would instead, if you were at all intelligen t, begin at once to seek the means to enlarge and streng then the foundat ion. \"The pr ogress of t he material science can not successfu lly be halted. Either it will go forward, or it will go back . If it goes back, it will collapse because of the fact that the princi pal supportin g members will be the first to weak en under a progr am of retrogression. There is nothin g that is intrinsicall y wrong with your material science. It will progress and expand to horiz ons as yet undreamed of , if only y our people will provide a founda tion capa ble of sup porting it.\" \"And if they do not?\" I asked. \"Then y our civ ilization will go down,\" Alan replied slowly . \"It will destro y itself in a holocaust which will leave few surviv ors. Thos e few who do surviv e will hav e neither the abi lity nor the desire to rebuild their science. In a few gener ations their descendan ts will have returned almost to the lev el of the animal. Then the proc ess of ev olution will begin again . In fifteen or twenty thousa nd years another civil ization will emerge. I t will face the same problems and h ave the same opportu nity for their solut ion. If it fails, it will in turn go down. This is an immutable 32 law of the un iverse, but one which oper ates according to the free choice of the r ace. Your race and your cult ure are not doomed to extinction , they ma y contin ue upon their upward course until they have left this danger behin d them for ever. The choice is yours.\" \"There is li ttle doubt,\" I said, \"which choice the people would make, if they were aware of the alternativ es between which they were choosing .\" \"Precisely ,\" Ala n replied. \"That is why we are her e, and that is wh y you ar e here.\" \"As I have said before: our ancestors w ere a group of survi vors of the last complete collapse of civilization on this planet . This was mo re tha n thirty thousa nd years ago as you measur e time toda y, but even then they had developed a material science which was, in some r espects at least, considerably advanced over your present position. They followed the natur al laws, instead of pi tting one agai nst the other as your science does, so that their devices we re much simp ler, and yet they could accompl ish things which you hav e not y et been able to do . They, too, failed to realize the absolute necessity of an equal developmen t of the spiritual and social v alues. \"A political and social cleft developed betwe en the two princi pal nations of that era. Friction between the two increased yearly, until at last it exploded 33 into a w ar of annih ilation .
