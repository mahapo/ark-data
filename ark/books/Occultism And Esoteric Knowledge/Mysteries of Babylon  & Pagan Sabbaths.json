He expelled the pagan priests ordained by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places of the cities of Judah, and on those around Jerusalem – those pagan priests who burned incense to Baal – to the Sun , to the Moon , and to the planets [the seven heavenly lights that rule over the days of the pagan week] – to all the host of heaven.  Has Satan truly deceived the whole world? Can we really believe this? If this is true, how has he deceive d the whole world? Does the Bible and history give us a clue? What was Nimrod‟s Tower of Babel all about? Did it have anything to do with changing Jahwah's calendar? Has the Babylonian Mysteries and the worship of Nimrod been Satan‟s instrument in decei ving the whole world? Has Satan given the world a false Sabbath – a false appointed time to meet with Jahwah? Before we begin this study, let‟s go to the Scriptures and get the understanding of how Jahwah reveals wisdom and to whom. Jahwah reveals the wisdom of His Word so that it is “ here a little and there a little .” He does this in order to separate His people, His “little flock”, from the rest of the pagan world. Isaiah 28:9 states exactly how we are to acquire His knowledge and doctrine – how we have to get weaned from the breast and milk. We have to start eating meat. “ To whom will He teach knowledge? And to whom will He make to understand doctrine? To them that are weaned from the milk , and drawn from the breasts . ” Then He goes on to exp lain how He teaches this knowledge of meat and why He teaches knowledge in this way. Verse 10 - For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little . (Verse 12) .... This is how ye may cau se the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing .’ Yet they would not hear .” Verse 13 states why Jahwah gives His doctrine in this way: “ But the word of Jahwah was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared and taken.” The mysteries of Jahwah's kingdom are not revealed to everyone. Even when the Messiah walked the earth he continually spoke in parables and His d isciples questioned him about this in Matthew 13:10 - 16: The disciples came to him and asked, “ Why do you speak to the people in parables? ” He replied, “ The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them . Whoever has will be given more (secrets), and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. This is why I"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Page 3 of 13 speak to them in parables , because they see and yet cannot perceive; and they hear and yet do not listen, nor d o they understand. In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: ‘You will indeed hear but never understand; you will indeed look but never see. For this people’s heart has grown hard; they have stopped their ears and shut their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and be converted and I would heal them.’ But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.’” Paul relates in Colossians 2 that all treasures of wisdom and knowledge are stored up in the Messiah. This wisdom and knowledge are revealed to those in the M essiah but they are hidden to those outside. Now that we understand how to obtain Jahwah's wisdom let‟s begin the study. In order to understand the Mysterie s of Babylon, we must follow the leading of the Ruwach ha‟qodesh as related first in Scriptures and second in history as it fills in the blank spaces. History tells us astrology is the origin of all pagan religious systems since the time of the Tower of B abel. The seven planetary gods/heads/lords of ancient astrology were the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, which were inscribed on the top of the Tower of Babel. “Thus they said, „Go, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top ( is inscribed ) with the heavens...‟” (Genesis 11:4) This historical information will help us to understand how the planetary gods of Babel and the number 666 are tied together, i.e. how the Mystery Babylonian Religion can be traced from Babel in Genesis 11 t o the woman that rides the scarlet coloured beast in Revelation 17. II Kings 23:4 & 5 gives some insight on what the Babylonian Mystery Religion, i.e. Baal worship, was all about: “Then the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest....to bring out of the Ho use/Temple of Jahwah all the vessels that were made for Baal , for Asherah /grove, and for all the host of heaven...He expelled the pagan priests ordained by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places of the cities of Judah, and on those around Jeru salem – those pagan priests who burned incense to Baal – to the sun , to the moon , and to the planets ( the seven heavenly lights that rule over the days of the pagan week ) – to all the host of heaven.” Note: Asherah is (#842 in the Strongs‟ Concordance) th e name of a Phoenician goddess. A straight, perpendicular wooded pole represented this goddess in this ancient religion. It was a Sacred Pole used to keep time, i.e. to set the pagan feasts. It seems quite obvious that Paul is speaking of these same pol es in Galatians 4:3, 8, 9, & 10: “So we also, when we were infants, we were enslaved under the elements of the world; (In “ A Critical Lexicon and Concordance to the Greek and English New Testament” by Ethelbert Bullinger, Page 247, it states “elements” is from the Greek word “ stoicheion, ” which means a small upright rod, especially the gnomon of the sundial or the shadows thrown by it.) “ Formerly, when you did not know Jahwah, you were slaves to gods, who are not gods at all. ( i.e. the gods/lords of the se ven heavenly lights of Babylonian Worship ). But now, after you have come to know Jahwah, or rather to be known by Jahwah, how can you turn back again to the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Page 4 of 13 weak/powerless and destitute elements/sacred poles . Why do you want to be in bondage to them all over again? ( In bondage to these gods through using these Sacred Poles to set false festival times .) You are observing (setting times) special days, months, set times, and years (instead of Jahwah's sacred days, months, set times, and years.)” The most sacred numbers in Astrology were 1, 6, 12, 36, 111, & 666 . According to Roy Anderson in “Revelation of John,” the pagan priests wore amulets called “Sigilla Solis” – the “Sun Seal” which symbolized 36 constellations. The amulet was divided into thirty - si x squares. (Note: The numbers 1+2+3 to 36, when added up, equal the number of the “ mystery god ” – “ the hidden one,” 666 .) In the squares, numbers 1 - 36 were arranged in such a way as to total 111 either horizontally or vertically. The two diagonals of th e square also total 111. One such amulet example is: 6 32 3 34 35 1 7 11 27 28 8 30 19 14 16 15 23 24 18 20 22 21 17 13 25 29 10 9 26 12 36 5 33 4 2 31 The sum of the six columns computed either horizontally or vertically total 666. Genesis 10 :10 states that Babel was the beginning of Nimrod‟s Kingdom. “ Saturn ” was the name given to the pagan worship of the Babylonian Ruler Nimrod, who was known as the God of the Chaldean Mysteries . The name Saturn in Chaldee is pronounced “ Satur ” but in Aram aic it is spelled “ Stur ” as shown in the book “ The Two Babylons ” by Rev. Alexander Hislop. “ Stur ” has the numerical value of “ 666. ” “ Saturn ” means “ The Hidden One,” which relates that this whole pagan religion is hidden – secret. In Greek, Saturn was kn own as “ Kronos ,” which means “ time .” (Saturn was given a day of time in the pagan week – Satur - day .) In Egypt, Saturn was known as Apis – the bull god of Memphis. The golden calf at Mt. Sinai was none other than the image of Apis, the bull of Memphis. A fter the Israelites made this golden calf, a false feast was declared to honor Jahwah: Exodus 32:5 & 6 – “Thus when Aaron saw it (the golden calf), he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, „ Tomorrow is a feast to Jahwah.‟ ( Note : This was not a true appointed - time feast for Jahwah; it was a false feast . Could this have been the false weekly Sabbath dedicated to Saturn/Apis/Nimrod, i.e. Saturday/Saturn’s day?) "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Page 5 of 13 One of the web sites I recently visited, stated that 666 formed a wor d in Latin/Greek – “DICLUX” – which means “ Gods of Light .” This hasn‟t been confirmed as yet, but the definition sure fits all of the other research – very interesting! Paganism is mainly a religion of nature worship of which the sun and the moon are the predominant deities. The sun is usually the male and the moon the female (as Horus and Isis of Egypt.) It is very interesting to note in ancient mythology, the serpent was universally the symbol of the sun . Sun worship and serpent worship began side by side. The sun was proclaimed to be the source of all fleshly life and the serpent the origin of all spiritual life. But remember, Revelation 12 states that the serpent has “deceived the whole world.” At this time, it would be very enlightening to make s ome comparisons between the serpent/dragon of Revelation 12 and Nimrod, since Nimrod‟s Babylonian kingdom was set up in rebellion against Jahwah's government/kingdom. The dragon/serpent/Devil/Satan had seven heads. According to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Ba bylon, the seven heavenly luminaries of the sun , the moon , and the five planets were inscribed on top of the Tower of Babel. The word “ Heads ” in Greek is “ kephale ” which also means “supreme, chief, prominent, master, lord .” This is truly revealing as “ Ba al ” in Hebrew also means lord, master, and owner. Revelation 12:3 also states that this dragon beast had 10 horns. “ Horns ” in the Scriptures symbolize powers or kingdoms. Well guess how many city governments Nimrod set up in the beginning of his kingdom – a great big ten: Babel, Erech, Accad, Calneh, Shinar, Asshur, Ninevah, Rehoboth - ir, Calah, & Resen. This religion of the serpent with the seven heads and ten horns has passed down from one occult priesthood to another all the way down through the yea rs as man was scattered throughout the earth from the time of the Tower of Babel. In the Orient today, everything is symbolized by that same serpent. A Buddhist temple in Thailand has two winged serpents adorning the entrance to the sanctuary. The serpe nt symbolizes a guardian to the temple in Alexandria, Egypt. Even we in the United States have adopted the serpent called Æsculapius in the medical field. In Greece, this serpent was the god of drugs & medicines – a counterfeit healer. In Italy, the Rom ans adopted the worship of the serpent as a symbol of power that carries the soul to heaven. In the Archaeological Museum in Rome, a sarcophagus of the dead has two serpents pulling a chariot, taking these people to heaven. Rome also adopted this symbol of the serpent as the healer. Revelation 12 describes Satan and his kingdom and his entire apostasy as the dragon or the winged serpent. The New Age Movement of today is using the serpent as a symbol of energies with which our minds should unite. The re ligion of the serpent is characterized in the Scriptures as the “destroyer” and the “enemy.” The seven heads of that dragon are depicting the seven planetary gods that began in Babel. The ten horns denote all the powers"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Page 6 of 13 that rule this Babylonian world ki ngdom. That old serpent/dragon was cast out onto the earth. He deceived the whole world . After the kingdom of Babylon fell, the entire system of Babylonian and Egyptian mythology was transferred to Pergamos in Asia Minor. John tells about it in Revelat ion 2:13 when writing to the Church of Pergamos: “I know where you live; it is where the throne of Satan is .” Later the system was carried into the City of Rome, where the Roman Catholic Church now has its headquarters. This system was already beginning to work during the days of the apostles, but its fulness had not been revealed. Paul calls this entire hidden god system of Saturn Worship “ the mystery of iniquities ” in Thessalonians 2:7. In Revelation 17:5, John refers to it as “ Mystery, Babylon the Gr eat .” Remember Nimrod‟s Babylonian Mystery Religion was shrouded in secrecy, i.e. went underground, after his death and dismemberment. The pieces of his body were sent to the different cities over the land as a warning against this false religion. Some ancient writings state that Shem (Son of Noah) killed Nimrod, dismembered his body and sent the pieces to the various cities as a warning. When this system was established in Rome – the City of the Seven Hills (Revelation 17:9) – it became known for ce nturies as “ Saturian Land.” The original name of Rome was “ The City of Saturnalia. ” The apostles warned the early church about this pagan religion, foreseeing that it would eventually corrupt the church. Little by little, despite their warnings, the chu rch slipped into “apostasy” and the Babylonian Mysteries were established in the apostate church and her daughters. In “The Book of Days” – Volume 1, page 435, B. R. Chambers reveals that the church has a festival named the “Festival of St. Satur,” which is held on March 29 th . Can you believe that one! The Kingdom of Rome in Hebrew is called “ Romith ” and the letters add up to 666 . This whole system is described in the Catholic Encyclopedia under the subject of “Astrology.” Saturn is described as star of the sun – the great planet and ruler of the heavens. ( Note : If the serpent in ancient mythology was symbolized by the sun and Saturn was the star of the sun , it would strongly suggest why Saturn was the center of worship in the Babylonian Mystery Reli gion.) The Egyptian priests were undoubtedly taught by the old Chaldian priests . The Egyptians developed astrology to a condition from which it varies but little today. The hours of the day and night received special planets as their rulers , thus the hi gh and the low stood under the influence of the stars which proclaimed through the priests the coming fate of the land and its people. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Page 7 of 13 The astrology of the ancient people of India was similar, though not as developed. They also regarded the planets as ru lers of different hours of the days. India then in turn influenced and helped with the development of astrology in ancient China. The encyclopedia then traces this astrology to Greece. The Assyro - Babylonian and Egyptian priests taught the Greek astro logers. Both of these priestly castes were called Caldeans . It was through the Hellenic (Greek) philosophers that these astrological secrets of the Orient reached the profane world. After the overthrow of the Assyro - Babylonian Empire, the priests of thos e regions found refuge in Greece and spread their teachings by writings and word of mouth. Astrology soon consumed the entire philosophical conception of the nature among the Greeks and rapidly infiltrated religious worship . The Jews , very soon after the y were driven into Western Europe, busied themselves with astrological study, being inspired to do so by their own Talmud . This spread of astrology was furthered by the Jewish scholars living in Christian lands, as astrology was considered a very necessar y part of their cabalistic and Talmudic studies . Under the topic “ Sunday, ” the Catholic Encyclopedia states: “ The seven planets, known to us as Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon, each had an hour of the day assigned to them, a nd the planet which was regent during the first hour of any day of the week gave its name to that day. During the first and second century the week of seven days was introduced into Rome from Egypt, and the Roman names of the planets were given to each su ccessive day . ” (Note: This confirms that the seven day week – the modern pagan week – did not reach Rome until after the Messiah‟s death.) The same encyclopedia describes the Gnostic Religion as including the Babylonian religion of astrology. Many schol ars have concluded that the culprit that Paul was fighting in Coloss æ was an outbreak of Gnosticism. In order to grasp some of the points Paul makes in his letter to the Colossians, one must have a basic understanding of Gnosticism. Gnosticism was a melt ing pot of existing religions, which included the Babylonian religion of astrology . Babylonian religion believed that the planetary system had a fatalistic influence on this world‟s affairs. The greatness of the Seven – the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn – the sacred hebdomad – was symbolized for millenniums by the temple towers (ziggurats.) One such temple tower was the famous Tower of Babel, whose top was inscribed with the seven heavenly luminaries. The temple towers were bu ilt in stories of either three or seven. (Note : Hebdomad as noted in the dictionary means a"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Page 8 of 13 period of seven days; a week . ) These luminaries ceased to be worshipped as deities, but they remained rulers and powers whose almost irresistible force was dreaded by man. They were changed from gods to evil spirits. Every soul had to pass the adverse influence of these spirits before it could ascend to the only good God beyond. This ascent of the soul through the planetary spheres to the heaven beyond began to b e conceived as a struggle with adverse powers, and became the first and predominant idea in Gnosticism. When Gnosticism came in touch with Christianity, which must have happened almost immediately on its appearance, Gnosticism threw herself with strange rapidity into Christian forms of thought....As Christianity grew within and without the Roman Empire, Gnosticism spread as a fungus at its root, (i.e. a counterfeit religion) and claimed to be the only true form of Chritianity but set apart for only the gift ed and elect. So rank was its poisonous growth that there seemed a danger of stamping out the true church established by Jahshuwah. In Revelation 2, the churches of Ephesus and Pergamos were warned against having anything to do with the Nicolaitanes, whi ch was a Gnostic group. Simon Magus and Marcion were also well - known Gnostics.” Now let‟s take a look at the beast of Revelation 13 & 17 and see if there is any connection with Nimrod & the ancient worship of the seven luminary gods of the heavens. Re velation 13 describes this beast as a leopard, a bear and a lion. “ Nimr ” is a word that means “ l eopard .” Some scholars think that “ Nimrod ” came from this word “ Nimr . ” In the Berlin Museum are amulets that were worn by pagan priests. On the front of the amulet was the god of the sun standing on a lion. On the back was the diagram of mystic numbers adding up to 666 as shown in the previous example. In “Two Babylons,” Hislop states that Nimrod was worshipped as the sun - god and while under the name of Mit hra, he was exhibited in sculpture as a lion . This beast has the paws of a bear . In the “ Dictionary of Symbolism ” – page 33, Hans Biedermann states: “As a dangerous animal the bear is at times the embodiment of the devil‟s power . The young David‟s figh t with a bear , mentioned in the Bible, is taken by Christian exegesis to be a prototype of the triumph of Christ over the forces of darkness .” This story is found in 1 Samuel 17:34 - 37: “And David said unto Saul, „Thy servant kept his father‟s sheep, and t here came a lion and a bear , and took a lamb out of the flock: And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his mane, and smote him, and slew him. Thy servant slew both the lion and bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living Elohim. ’ David said moreover, „Jahwah that delivered me out of the paw"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Page 9 of 13 of the lion , and out of the paw of the bear, will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine‟”.... Biedermann further says, “In Norse myth Odin appears at times as a bear (Björn).” Mercury – a Roman god – was identified with the Teutonic god called Woden (same as Odin ) in Anglo - Saxon, and his day of the week accordingly became “ Woden‟s day ” (Wednesday). The lion, the bear, the serpent, Jahwah's hatred of the festivals and the worship of Saturn – the star god are all a part of a parable of the Day of Jahwah described in Amos 5:18 - 26: “Woe to those who yearn for the day o f Jahwah! What will this day of Jahwah mean for you? Darkness and not light! It will be as though a man fled from a lion only to meet a bear ; or went into the house and rested a hand against the wall, and was bitten by a serpent .... I despise your feast da ys ; I cannot stand your solemn assemblies ......O House of Israel. You will take up the tabernacle your king, and Chin your star - god , the images which you made for yourselves ....” These are some important facts to ponder: - The United States is a part of the H ouse of Israel – We as a nation look to our king/president/government to meet all of our needs instead of looking to and depending on Jahwah – Chiun is none other than the planet Saturn , and we pay honor to this star god by naming Saturday in his honor. This beast of Satan has seven heads – the Babylonian worship system was controlled by the seven heavenly luminary bodies. This beast of Satan has ten horns – Nimrod‟s Babylonian kingdom began with ten cities/governments/powers. Revelation 17 describes the location of the City of Babylon. In order to understand a subject, go back to its beginnings. The Tower of Babel was the beginning of Nimrod‟s kingdom. Thus far, we have traced in the foregoing study how the Mysteries of the Babylonian false religio n left the Tower of Babel – flowed all through the Babylonian Kingdom into Egypt – from there into Greece and then into the City of Rome, also known as the City of Saturnalia. From the City of Rome, this religion completely consumed Christianity. The ap ostles foresaw this apostasy and were adamant in their warning to the Messiah‟s flock. Verse 9 of Revelation 17 describes the heads of the beast: “The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman/whore/apostate church sits.” Remember “heads” in Gr eek also means “lords” and “masters.” “Babel” can also be read as “Bab - bel”, i.e. “Gate of Bel”; Bel is just another form of Baal, which means “lord” or “master.” “Mountain” in Greek is “ oros ” which means a mountain, as lifting itself above the plain ; A rising ; Perhaps akin to 142 – airo , which means to lift, lift up; See also 3722 – orthros – which means a rising of light fro m the same as Oros . Could this verse read “ The seven lords are seven risings on which the woman (whore/apostate church) sits,” ( m eaning the seven luminary risings are lords over the seven days of the weeks on which all pagan religions worship after the fashion"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Page 10 of 13 of the Babylonian Mysteries )? The Muslims worship on Friday over which the planet Venus rises and rules – The Jews and thei r followers worship on Saturday over which the planet Saturn rises and rules – The Catholic Church and all of her daughters worship on Sunday over which the Sun/serpent rises and rules. The earthly dwelling house for Bel (a ziggurat) was first named “ Ekur ,” which meant “ The Mountain of the earth.” “ The Dictionary of Symbolism ” by Hans Biedermann – page 228 states: “ The ziggurat structures of ancient Mesopotamia were architectural translations of divine mountains ; the mountain is ...the abode for the gods.” The Tower of Babel (a seven - tiered ziggurat) was inscribed with the seven luminary lights: the Sun, the Moon, & the five planets of Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. History relates that ziggurats of Babylonia were topped with either an observat ory for watching the heavenly luminaries or a sanctuary dedicated to the god or gods they worshipped. Other scholars believe that each of the seven tiers of the Tower of Babel was dedicated to one of the seven lights of heaven. The modern pagan week is n amed after these same seven heavenly lights according to their risings that rule over the first hour of each day, i.e. they are the lords or masters or heads ruling that day. The Seven - day week, as created by Jahwah, was shown by the phases of the Moon, n ot by the risings of these seven pagan gods of the Babylonian Mysteries. So there would be no question as to when His week began and ended, Jahwah created a big, big clock in the heavens. The true weekly Sabbath – the appointed time for meeting with Jahw ah – the day that is sanctified and set apart by Jahwah at creation – is appointed by the phases of the moon. This Sabbath is Jahwah's sign or mark as stated in Exodus 32:13: It is the “sign/mark between Me and you forever so that you may know that it is Jahwah that sanctifies/purifies you.” The true Sabbath gives glory & points to the Creator. It is interesting that the Greek word for “Mountain” – oros is akin to #142 – airo – which means, “ to expiate sin .” If the true Sabbath is Jahwah's mark, the n the mark of the beast – 666 – has to refer to the keeping of a false sabbath created by the devil and his Babylonian Mystery System. This false sabbath – this false appointed time – is Satan‟s way of leading mankind away from Jahwah. As it says in Reve lation 12, that old serpent – dragon – Satan – the Devil – has deceived the whole world. Luke 3:4 - 6 & Isaiah 40:3 - 5 states that “... Mountains and hills will be brought low.” Is it referring to these seven mountains/hills of Revelation 17? Zechariah 8:2 & 3 calls Zion “the mountain of Jahwah Sebaoth – the holy/separated mountain .” ( Sebaoth denotes a mass of people gathered/assembled together an appointed time .) Lucifer himself is seated on the mountain of feasts/appointed times to deceive, as is found in Isaiah 14:13: “ For thou (Lucifer) ha s said in thine heart, ‘I will ascend into heaven; I will"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" Page 11 of 13 exalt my throne above the stars of El; I will sit also upon the M ount of the appointed times/festivals on the sides of the N orth . ” In the King James “ appointed t imes ” is translated as “ congregation ;” the Hebrew word is moed - #4150 in the Strong‟s Concordance, which can also refer to the appointed festivals of Jahwah. “ North ” is the Hebrew word tsaphon which also means “ hidden ”; it is from the word tsaphan (6845 in Strong‟s Concordance) which means to hide by covering; keep secret . ) Lucifer is hiding Jahwah ‟ s true Sabbaths by covering them over. It is also interesting to take note of the name “Lucifer.” The name is from 1984 (Strong‟s ) halal which means “ to shine ” or “ give light .” Here is some food for thought. Does the Battle of Har - ma - ged - don refer to this same Mountain of Appointed Times? Sometime ago, one of the web sites I visited wrote an article on the word “Harmageddon.” This site traced the word back to the Hebrew word “moed.” A Biblical scholar was quoted as saying that “moed” was pronounced as “Moh - gehd,” which referred to “Harmageddon” – “ Har ” meaning “ Mountain ” and “ Ma - ged ” meaning “ Appointed Times .” (Note: Revelation 16:12 - 16 – “The s ixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East. Then I saw three evil spirits that looked like frogs. They came out of the mouth of the Dragon , out of the mouth of th e Beast and out of the mouth of the False Prophet . They are spirits of demons performing miraculous signs, and they go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of Jahwah the Almighty. Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. Then he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Har - ma - ged - don .” In the very next chapter, Revelation 17, John talks about the wom an sitting on the scarlet beast. ( Remember the original scriptures had no chapters or verses. ) “ Then one of the seven messengers who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying to me, ‘Come, I will show you the judgment of the G reat Whore sitting o n many waters, with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and the inhabitors of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. So He carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness (Note: The golden calf was set up in the wilderness ) and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having s even heads and ten horns ...And upon her forehead was a name written a m ystery/secret : Babel (gate of Bel/Baal) the Great, the Mother of the Whores and of the abominations of the earth.” The Gate of Bel leads us to a false Sabbath and away from Jahwah. Jahshuwah, the true door/gate, leads us to the true Sabbath and into the presence of Jahwah. It definitely is worth our consideration. Remember the h ead of t he golden image in Daniel 2 was Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon . The head thinks for and controls the whole body of the false Babylonian whore; also the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Page 12 of 13 Mark of the Beast – 666 – can be in the forehead, i.e. the m ind . The Babylonian pagan holiday of Chr istmas is celebrated worldwide. It was originally called “The Saturnalia Feast.” Christianity, as you well know, adopted “The Saturnalia Feast” as their own, but dressed it up in a different name – calling it “Christ‟s Mass.” Who is the worldwide church that holds a mass to Christ? It is none other than the Roman Catholic Church, whose headquarters is located on the s even hills of Rome – The City of Saturnalia. We know and understand that Satan uses the “little horn” as described in Daniel 7:25 to pr esent a false calendar to the world. “ He (the little horn) will insult the Most High, he will torment/wear out the holy ones of the Most High and he will attempt to change the calendar and the ordinances. ” According to John Knox‟s Bible translation the w ord “calendar” is used for that which the “little horn” will attempt to change. Here is some more food for thought. What was the original Garden of Eden? George M. Lamsa states in the “Old Testament Light” – page 13 – that the word “ Eden ” comes from the Hebrew word “ iddan .” In “The Brown - Driver - Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon” – page 1105, “ iddan ” means a fixed, appointed, or definite time. With this definition in mind, the Garden of Eden would be a “Garden of Time” – “A Garden of Definite time” – “A Set - time Garden” – “A Garden of Measuring Time.” This garden was a place where man met and walked with Jahwah. Could this also be a place in time? In conclusion, Jahwah knew from the beginning that Satan and man would falsify His appointments by changi ng the time, therefore He created a clock in heaven to establish His “appointed meetings.” As is stated in Psalms 19:1 - 2, “The heavens d eclare /rehearse the glory of El; and the firmament sheweth His handiwork. Day after day prophesying (His) promises; An d night after night r eveals (His) k nowledge .” His handwork i s His creation which points back to the Creator. The pagan week certainly does not given glory to the Creator – only to the Babylonian pagan gods. If Jahwah states that “Satan has deceived the whole world,” then he has indeed deceived the whole world. If Jahwah states that this false mystery religion originated in Babylon, then that is where it originated. If Jahwah states that it is His pleasure to give the kingdom to His “ little flock, ” then His flock is indeed little . If He states that the wheat and the tares will be mixed together until the end times , i.e. until the harvest, then they will indeed be mixed together until the harvest. I personally believe that this is the separating of the wheat and the tares – this is indeed the beginning of the harvest. The Body of Christ – the little flock – is receiving the true weekly Sabbath. They are going into the presence of Jahwah – into the Holy of Holies where the s eat of mercy is located – whe re there is a true Sabbath of rest .
