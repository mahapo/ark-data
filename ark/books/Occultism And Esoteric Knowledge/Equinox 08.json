The growth of interest in these matters has been simply marvellous. Numberless societies, associations , orders, groups, etc., etc., have been founded in all parts of the civilized world, all and each following some line of occult study. While all these newly organized associations do some good in preparing the minds of thoughtful people for their even tually becoming genuine disciples of the One Truth, yet there is but ONE ancient organization of Mystics which shows to the student a Royal Road to discover the One Truth. This organization has permitted the formation of the body known as the “ANCIENT O RDER OF ORIENTAL TEMPLARS.” It is a modern School of Magi.

It is recorded in symbol, parable and allegory, requiring a Key for its interpretation. The symbols of Freemasonry were originally derived from the more ancient mysteries, as all who have travelled the burning sands know. The ritual and ceremonie s, signs and passwords have been preserved with great fidelity: but the Real Key has been long lost to the crowds who have been initiated, advanced and raised in Masonry. The KEY to this knowledge can, however, be placed within the reach of all those who unselfishly desire, study and work for its possession. The Symbols of Ancient Masonry, the Sacred Art of the Ancient Chemi (Egyptians), and Homer's Golden Chain are but different aspects of the One Great Mystery. They represent but different degrees of in itiation. By the Right Use of the “Key” alone the “Master Word” can be found. In order to afford genuine seekers after Hermetic Truth some information on the aims of the Ancient Order of Oriental Templars, we now print the preliminary instruction issued by the Fratres of this Order. FIRST INSTRUCTION To all whom it may concern — Let it be known that there exists, unknown to the great crowd, a very ancient order of sages, whose object is the amelioration and spiritual elevation of mankind, by means of"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"ORDER OF ORIENTAL TEMPLARS ix co nquering error, and aiding men and women in their efforts of attaining the power of recognizing the truth. This order has existed already in the most remote and prehistoric times; and it has manifested its activity secretly and openly in the world under different names and in various forms; it has caused social and political revolutions, and proved to be the rock of salvation in times of danger and misfortune. It has always upheld the banner of freedom against tyranny, in whatever shape this appeared, whether as clerical or political, or social despotism or oppression of any kind. To this secret order every wise and spiritually enlightened person belongs by right of his or her nature; because they all, even if they are personally unknown to each other , are one in their purpose and object, and they all work under the guidance of the one light of truth. Into this sacred society no one can be admitted by another, unless he has the power to enter it him - self by virtue of his own interior illumination: n either can any one, after he has once entered, be expelled, unless he should expel himself by becoming unfaithful to his principles, and forget again the truths which he has learned by his own experience. All this is known to every enlightened person; but it is known only to few that there exists also an external, visible organization of such men and women who, having themselves found the path to real self - knowledge, are willing to give to others, desirous of entering that path, the benefit of their experi ence and to act as spiritual guides to those who are willing to be guided. As a matter of course, those persons who are already sufficiently spiritually developed to enter into conscious communion with the great spiritual brotherhood"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX x will be taught direc tly by the spirit of wisdom; but those who still need external advice and support will find this in the external organization of that society. In regard to the spiritual aspect of this secret order, one of the Brothers says — “Our community has existed eve r since the first day of creation when the gods spoke the divine command: ‘Let there be light!’ and it will continue to exist till the end of time. It is the Society of the Children of Light, who live in the light and have attained immortality therein. In our school we are instructed directly by Divine Wisdom, the Celestial Bride, whose will is free and who selects as her disciples those who are devoted to her. The mysteries which we are taught embrace everything that can possibly be known in regard t o God, Nature and Man. Every sage that ever existed in the world has graduated at our school; for without wisdom no man can be wise. We all study only one book, the Book of Nature, in which the keys to all secrets are con - tained, and we follow the only possible method in studying it, that of experience. Our place of meeting is the Temple of the Holy Spirit pervading the universe; easily to be found by the elect, but for ever hidden from the eyes of the vulgar. Our secrets cannot be sold for money, but we give them free to every one capable to receive them.” As to the external organization of that society, it will be necessary to give a glance at its history, which has been one and the same in all. Whenever that spiritual society manifested itself on the outward plane and appeared in the world, it consisted at its beginning of a few able and en - lightened people, forming a nucleus around which others were"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ORDER OF ORIENTAL TEMPLARS xi attracted. But invariably, the more such a society grew in numbers, the more became attracted to its elements, such as were not able to understand or follow its principles; people who joined it for the purpose of gratifying their own ambition or for making the society serve their own ends obtained the majority over those that were pure. Thereupon th e healthy portion of it retired from the field and continued their benevolent work in secrecy, while the remaining portion became diseased and disrupted, and sooner or later died disgraced and profaned. For the Spirit had departed from them. For this rea son the external organization of which we speak has resolved not to reveal its name or place to the vulgar. Furthermore, for the same reason, the names of the teachers and members of this society shall remain unknown, except to such as are intimately ass ociated with them in their common work. If it is said that in this way the society will gain only few members, it may be answered that our society has a spiritual head, and that those who are worthy of being admitted will be guided to it by means of thei r intuition; while those who have no intuition are not ripe for it and not needed. It is better to have only a comparatively small number of capable members than a great many useless ones. From the above it will be clear that the first and most necessa ry acquirement of the new disciple is that he will keep silent in regard to all that concerns the society to which he is admitted. Not that there is anything in that Society which needs to be afraid of being known to the virtuous and good; but it is not necessary that things which are elevated and"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX xii sacred should be exposed to the gaze of the vulgar, and be bespattered by them with mud. This would only impede the society in its work. Another necessary requirement is mutual confidence be - tween the teacher and the disciple; because a disciple who has no faith in his master cannot be taught or guided by him. There may be things which will appear strange, and for which no reasons can be given to the beginner; but when the disciple has attained to a certai n state of development all will be clear to him or her. The confidence which is required will also be of little service if it is only of a short duration. The way of development of the soul, which leads to the awakening of the inner senses, is slow, and without patience and fortitude nothing will be accomplished. From all this it follows as a matter of course that the next requisite is obedience. The purpose of the disciple is to obtain the mastery over his own lower self, and for this reason he must n ot submit himself to the will of his lower nature, but follow the will of that higher nature, which he does not yet know, but which he desires to find. In obeying the will of the master, instead of following the one which he believes to be his own, but wh ich is in reality only that of his lower nature, he obeys the will of his own higher nature with which his master is associated for the purpose of aiding the disciple in attaining the conquest over himself. The conquest of the higher self over the lower s elf means the victory of the divine consciousness in man over that which in him is earthly and animal. Its object is a realization of true manhood and womanhood, and the attainment of conscious immortality in the realization of the highest state of existe nce in perfection."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"ORDER OF ORIENTAL TEMPLARS xiii These few preliminary remarks may be sufficient for those who desire information concerning our order; to those who feel themselves capable to apply for admission, further instructions will be given.

What would life be without love? A desert! There would be no true happiness without love. And y et we must admit that love is in some ways a great danger. We must remember that many great teachers have forbidden it. What did the great Buddha say to Ananda? “Beware of women, Ananda!” “But Lord, they are subtle of speech!” “Don’t speak to them, A nanda!” “But, Lord, suppose they speak to us?” “Keep wide awake, Ananda!” Think of Paul’s contemptuous permission, “It is better to marry than to burn” — it is easy to see that Paul had never been married! — and of his Master’s plain prohibition of anythi ng of the sort. If our own Beloved Lord and Teacher does not join the band, it is (may I suggest with all humility?) because He wants us to be strong enough to manage our own affairs without resorting to the extreme of prohibition. But it is hard upon th e weak. Think of A, who left the noblest and the most exalted pursuits for a baser love, a love in a boarding - house in Hoxton, a love with spectacles and elastic - sided boots; think of B, who married (on her holiday as a maid - of - all - work in Bayswater) a forty - pfenning fly - by - night from Hamburg, who cockolded him openly in"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX xxiv the streets of Venice, and nearly sobbed the station into the lagoon as she was torn shrieking from her favourite gondolier by the girls she was supposed to be chaperoning; think of C, who forgot the heavenly choir for the earthly, and of D, who was last seen in Naples being sick out of a window on the second floor; think of E, who married a girl named Ethel Maud, reaping in himself that recompense of his error which was meet; think of F , who might have performed the Operation of the Sacred Magic of Abra - melin the Mage, and has taken up Goat Golf instead; think of G, who went ashore once too often, and was caught by a girl named Alphonsina Nectarine Stubbs; think of H, who had to shave of f the loveliest red beard to show what a strong chin he really had; think of I — no! that isn't grammar — think of Me! My catalogue need not stop there, but it shall. Against all this what have we to urge but the awful example of J, who wanted to store up Oja s, and went off his K — nut? No, dear readers, love is not all that it's cracked up to be. It's a good boy to have to answer the bell, but it's a bad packing - house when you're the pig! Love is like champagne. You must drink it quickly; and if you keep i t corked up too long, you find it has gone flat. It is a fine pick - me - up; but champagne all day is nastier than skilly. FRATER PERDURABO is a wise man. He never says “Keep off the drink!” If you cannot drink soberly and decently you are not fit.

P. still less occupied with magic; he spent the winter skat ing at St. Moritz, where his only occult exploit seems to have been parson -baiting, and though he returned to Scotland in the spring, it was only for a few days. For on April 27 , 1905 , one of the old comrades of his journeys in Central Asia sought him o ut, and proposed a new Expedition. Fra. P. gleefully accepted, and on May 6 , having got together his kit, left his home, and sailed for India on the 12 th. His diary is henceforth barren of all interest to us. We learn only that the success of his plans was spoilt by a mutiny, which resulted in the death of four innocent people, and a good deal of damage to the mutineers, and that in con - sequence he went off to visit his old friend the Maharaja of Moharbhanj, and shoot big game. After spending a few days with this amiable despot, he went off alone into the jungle, and his thoughts immediately reverted to magic, to the performance of the Great Work, though not as yet to the Egyptian revelations. His antipathy to these, with their irrational instructions, grew and grew. It was only with the shattering of his reason that he could possibly accept them, and act on them. Yet even in this month's wandering in the jungle we find little in the diary but the record of exercise of strange magic powers.

And on one night — “Had long colloquy with Golden Hawk; invited —— (the Adept) and learnt that the Great Work was to create a new Universe. Whence severe self - criticism.” Th is at the end of his journey. Yet during this journey we find that he had written down the secrets of the Mystic Path in a mysterious MS., which few indeed have been privileged to see. In Calcutta he was very busy. He had been attacked by armed robbers, and, slaying two of them, was, in the then political condition of Bengal, likely to be offered up as a scapegoat. Further, his wife and child joined him, and it seemed most desirable that he should pursue his travels, which he did. But of this week one il luminating sentence is preserved. Fra. P. was driving through Calcutta with Mr. E —— T —— , and complaining to him that the analysis of impressions showed no connection between them. There was no coherence in the non - Ego, and so no sanity in the Universe. H is companion pointed out that the same criticism applied with equal force to the Ego. This fell on Fra. P. with the force of a thunderbolt. He had always known this in an intellectual way; now it stabbed him to the heart. Through the rest of the drive he sat silent, and in the bustle of the succeeding days of “Bandobast” for his newly projected walk through China, this awakening stood behind his mind, alert and operative. From Calcutta he proceeded to Rangoon (Nov. 3 - 6 ), where"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 10 he found his old comrade, I .

It was from him that he received the instructions which were to help him to reach the great and terrible pinnacle of the mind whence the Adept must plunge into the Abyss, t o emerge naked, a babe — the Babe of the Abyss. “Explore the River of the Soul,” said Ananda Metteya, “whence and in what order you have come.” For three days — the longest period allowed by the Buddhist law — he remained in the Choung, meditating on this matter ; but nothing seems to have come of it. He set his teeth and settled down doggedly to this consideration of the eternal why. Here is a being in Rangoon. Why? Because he wanted to see Bhikku A. M. Why? Because . . . and so on to the half - forgotten pas t, dark seas that phosphoresced as the clean keel of his thought divided them.

We can almost see him — lean, brown, stern and immobile, watching the wavelets of the great river, and the flying -fish, and the one thought: Why?

I am as one who should have plumed himself for years upon the speed and strength of a favourite horse, only to find not only that its speed and strength were illusory, but that it was not a real horse at all, but a clothes - horse. There being no way — no conceivable way — out of this awful trouble gives that hi deous despair which is only tolerable because in the past it has ever been the Darkness of the Threshold. But this is far worse than ever before; for it is not a despair of the Substance, but of the Form. I wish to go from A to B; and I am not only a cripple, but there is no such thing as space. I have to keep an appointment at midnight; and not only is my watch stopped, but there is no such thing as time.

Indeed, there is absolute silence on all mystic matters until December 20 , over a month later. On that day, jumping on to his Burmese pony, a few yards after fording the stream which marks the Chinese frontier, the animal backed before he was in the saddle, and fell with him over a cliff of some forty feet in height. “Neither hurt,” he remarks. “Later, kicked on the thigh by a mule.” It is of no purpose here to deal with Fra. P .’s private affairs; but one must mention that all this time of interior insanity he was “playing the man” very vigorously. His moral force no doubt saved the Europeans of Tengyueh from a panic which might easily have resulted in massacre. After the de ath, perhaps by poison, of the Consul, the admirable and undervalued Litton, he was the only person who kept his head, and knew how to assert the authority of the white man. So that we must understand that this “black insanity” of which Fra. P. speaks was a private little insanity of his own; it in no way interfered with the normal working of his magnificent and heroic brain.

Not from the meditation on the Reason, which ended once for all in the Destruction of that Reason, but by the “Sammasati” meditation on his Kamma. Baffled again and again, the fall with his horse supplied the one factor missing in his calculations. He had repeatedly escaped from death in manners almost miraculous. “Then I am some use after all!” was his conclusion. “I am indeed SENT to do something.” For whom? For the Universe; no partial good could possibly satisfy his equation. “I am, then, the ‘chosen Priest and Apostle of Infinite Space.’ Very good: and what is the message? What shall I teach men?” And like the lightning from heaven fell upon him these words: “ THE KNOWLEDGE AND CO NVERSA - TION OF THE HOLY GUA RDIAN ANGEL .” Just that.

It is time to break off for a moment from the Diary to ask the reader to remark how extraordinarily full is this passage of P.’s life.

After this, practically continuous ill - health, only interrupted by the most shocking domestic tragedies. Throug h all this, Fra.

I am sure I did. Such is the fragmentary account of what was then the greatest event in Fra. P.’s career. Yet this is an account of the highest of the trances — of Shivadarshana itself, as we know from ot her sources. The “vision,” to use still the name become totally inadequate, appears to have had three main points in its Atmadarshana stage — 1 . The Universal Peacock. 2 . The Universe as Ego. “I who am all and made it all abide its separate Lord,” i.e . th e Universe becomes a single and simple being, without quantity, quality, or conditions. In this the “I” is immanent, yet the “I” made it, and the “I” is entirely apart from it. (This is the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, or something very like it.) 3 . This Trinity is transcended by an impersonal Unity. This is then annihilated by the Opening of the Eye of Shiva. It is absolutely futile to discuss this: it has been tried and failed again and again. Even those with experience of the earlier part of t he “vision” in its fullness must find it totally impossible to imagine anything so subversive of the whole base, not only of the Ego, but of the Absolute behind the Ego.

It must be clearly under - stood that the Bhagavad - Gita, Anna Kingsford, St. John, and all other writers with the possible exception of Lao Tze , describe nothing higher than Atmadarshana. For the first time in the known history of the world there had arisen the combination of the utmost attainment with the intelligence and literary ability to make it comparatively articulate. It is no wonder, then, that we hail Fra. P. as the greatest of all Teachers. This entire experience from the Passing of the Abyss to the Shivadarshana has been so wonder fully described in “Aha!” by Mr. Aleister Crowley, who was privileged to get his material first - hand from Fra.

Or if the good work was going on, it was subconscious. He was standing by the gilded st atue of Jeanne d'Arc, his mouth wide open, his Baedeker limp in his perspiring hand. “She's riding astride!” The molten madness throbbed in his brain. “She's got man's clothes on!” The shocking truth must out: Theodore Bugg had come to Paris for Pleasur e! He had only been able to spare two days, the Sunday and Monday of Whitsuntide. He had travelled by the night boat on Saturday, arriving in Paris on Sunday morning — the first step downward!

He stared, fascinated as by a basilisk, his eyes starting further and further fr om his head as his moral sense dragged his body backwards along the Rue de Rivoli.

May I wrap it up for you?” But Bugg had thrust it into his inner pocket, and, p ressing a sovereign into the man's hand, dashed without looking behind him from the shop, eager to put time and space between himself and his compromising position. He hurried to his hotel, not without many a suspicious glance over his shoulder, and packed his bag. He had ten minutes to spare.

Theodore Bugg was not a sensitive man; excess of intuitive sympathy had not made his life a hell; but he felt that his domestic relations were strained. Es pecially since “that Mrs. Grahame” had evinced a liking for Gertrude. Her husband's colonelcy was the gilding of the pill; but the pill was a bitter one, for Mrs. Grahame went motoring and even golfing on Sunday instead of going to Church, and once or tw ice had taken Gertrude with her, to the scandal of the neighbourhood. Colonel Grahame, too, rather got on Bugg's nerves, in spite of the “honour of his acquaintance.” Such thoughts went dully through his mind as he waited in the garden for his daughter to come in to tea from the “Art Class.” But when she arrived, portfolio in hand, her beauty and the splendour of her long easy swing determined him to be gracious. Under such circumstances conversation is apt to be artificial; but Gertrude was gay and garrulous, and the tea went very pleasantly until her father's eye unluckily fell on the portfolio. “And what has my little fairy been doing lately?” he asked with elephantine lightness. “Oh, sketches mostly, father. This week we're copying from old Gre ek masterpieces, though. Let me show you, father, dear.” She opened the portfolio and turned over the"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"HIS SECRET SIN 57 leaves. “I'm getting on splendidly. Mr., Davis thinks I ought to go to Paris and study properly. Do let me.” “How can you think of such a thing, Gert rude? A daughter of mine! Study properly!!! No indeed! A little sketching is a nice accomplishment for a young lady, but — ” His jaw dropped. A thin, graceful pencil sketch it was that he clutched in frenzied fingers; but he could not mistake the sub ject. “Wretched girl,” he shouted, “where did you get the — the – the — Damn it all, what d'ye call it? — the — ay! that's it! — the model for this vile, filthy, lewd, obscene, lustful thing? Damn it! you're as bad as Cousin Jenny! (Cousin Jenny was a blot on th e ’scutcheon of the Buggs). You're a harlot, miss!” And then, with an awful change as the truth came home to him: “O my God! O my God! Damn it!” he screamed, “how did you get the keys of my little safe?” The girl had frozen colder than the stone, but t here was a new light in her eye, and if the curl of a lip could tread a worm into the dust, that lip was hers and that worm the author of her being. She had withdrawn as one who comes suddenly upon a toad, and the first flaming of her face had died instan tly to deadlier ice. Bugg saw his mistake, his masses of mistakes. There being but one more to make, he made it; and, finding himself in the frying - pan of discovery, leapt into the fire of things irrevocable and not to be forgotten. His fat, heavy - jowled , coarse face all twitching, he fell on his knees and clasped his hands together. “So you found me out? Don't, don't give away your poor old father, Gertie!

I must think.” And she stood motionless until her hapless father attracted her attention by backing into his wicker chair. “Don't touch holy things,” she snapped suddenly , taking the sketch from his nerveless hand, and replacing it reverently in the portfolio. The action seemed to decide her. “I'll give you an address to send my things to,” she said, and walked out of the garden. Theodore Bugg sat stunned. “Holy things,” she had said. She called that lustful French photograph holy! Was this Original Sin; or was it that strange new thing people were talking about — what was it? Ah! heredity. Heredity? His secret sin become her open infamy? Truly the sins of the fathers were visited on the children! By this time he was upstairs and in his bedroom. He must destroy the accursed thing; he must destroy — Ah! yes. He had contaminated Gertrude by having such a thing in his house. He must be the Roman father, and — what would a R oman father do? He had the match alight, but he could not put it to the edge of the packet.

Then, gulping down a sob, he went to the drawer of a cabinet and pulled out the revolver which he had bought (and loaded, under the shopman’s guidance) against burglars. Yes, he must kill himself. He drew back the hammer. Cold sweat beaded his flabby face. He could not; and anyhow, how did one? He thought of many stories of people who had shot themselves ineffectively. He felt for his heart and failed to find it, wondered if it had stopped and he were dying, had a fit of fear paralysing all his will. He thought of himself lying dead. “No, by God! I can't do it!” he cried, and flung the pistol back into the drawer. As luck would have it, the weapon exploded. The bullet broke his jaw, tore away four molars, smashed the cheek - bone, pulped the right eye, and, glancing from the frontal bone, found its billet in the ceiling. He lost consciousness and fell. His head struck the grate where yet smouldered the ashes of the photograph. It was three months before he recovered, and then with only half a face to face the world with. He still thinks that Gertrude gave him away, for the street - boys have taken to calling him “old Venus.” But he is wrong; the boys have their a esthetic reasons for the name.

It is to be supposed that Nature was weary of the procession, for Plac ide had never married, but lived alone in his hut in the forest of Fontainbleau, just too far from the borders for it ever to be worth his while to go into a village for a drink except on very special occasions. He had even been overlooked for military s ervice; and the Prussians had come and gone without interfering with his chopping. He could not read or write, and his language had many less than half a thousand words. In such conditions he deserved his Christian name. In the forest even an hour calms the most turbulent spirit; a day will cure most worries; and a week with an axe may be recommended to neurasthenics as more than the equivalent of the most expensive Weir - Mitchell treatment and rest - cures. If fashionable doctors could afford to be honest , they would order work - cures for nine - tenths of their patients. Forty - eight years with an axe in the forest had turned Placide Gervez into a mixture of Stoic, Cynic, and Epicurean; he boasted the simplicity and fortitude of each in respect of pain, propr iety, and pleasure. The droning hum of the forest, broken rarely by the birds — magpie, crow, cuckoo, and nightingale — meant nothing to him in the summer; nor did the monotonous drip depress him in the winter. The ringing thud of his axe and the crash of the"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 82 murdered tree were neither history nor tragedy to him; the comic and the pastoral were equally sealed books, for the forest has neither satyrs nor shepherds. He had no sport, since in his boyhood his father had thrashed him for throwing his axe at a stag ; and no society, for the nearest forester thought him a boor. He chopped to live, and lived to chop. It was the philosopher of the Rue de Chevreuse who cast the grain of sand into the wheels of this approximation to the solution of the problem of perpet ual motion. The philosopher was really a painter, but so bad a painter that he was only known as a theorist in the cafe which supplied his crême de menthe. There he would hold forth interminably on God and man. Blessed with such means as a mediocre fath er's devotion to cutlery and an only son had supplied, it was his habit on occasion to descend into the country. Picture him, if you please, as very short and moderately fat, middle - aged at thirty - two, clad in a bourgeois suit and an artist’s tie, a red h andker - chief under a black felt hat upon a bushy head garnished with a little beard and moustache, perspiring in a sandy and interminable bridle - path leading from the Long Rocher to nowhere in particular. These walks he would undertake (a) for his health, (b) to absorb the beauties of nature — as he would often demonstrate. Yet the greatest of philosophers are not always logical, and he would have been compelled to discover other reasons for his choice of company. This consisted of a lady whose age was re ndered only more uncertain by her efforts to nail conjecture to the number 25 . Her hair paled visibly from"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"THE WOODCUTTER 83 the scalp, and her neck darkened visibly from the chin. She had made the fortune of India in rice powder, and of China in vermilion. The extravaga nce of her person and attire, exaggerated even for the Café d’Harcourt, the fortress whence her sallies, was in Fontainebleau a thing to make earth’s guardian angels throw up the sponge. This was a summer’s afternoon; and the strange pair, encountering Pl acide Gervez as he chopped, accosted him. The philosopher, whose irrelevant name was Théophraste Goulet, drew out a cigarette and offered it to his intended victim. It is impossible in a polite nation to leave a man until you have finished the cigarette he gives you — a man, if he was a man, once gave me an Irish cigarette, but that story is a separate cheque — and Placide could not have cut that knot save with his axe. However, in the first pause of the voluble ass for breath, he pointed to his work, utte red the adjective “Hard,” and continued to chop. However, the purport of the discourse — in a highly con - densed form — was as follows. God is good, was the First Postulate of Theophrastus. Hence, all God does is good. Hence, since God made man, He meant ma n to do good. Hence, man should do good. Agreed. Then, what is good? The necessities of life are good, for otherwise no other good were possible without them. Food is good, shelter is good, all that tends to the health of the individual and the repr oduction of the species is good. For if not, let food be bad, let art be good. Then, since artists need food, good is based on bad, which is absurd. Agreed, then, that necessary things are good. Yes; but are"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 84 these the only good? No; for these benefits absorb only part of the time and energy of man. Is it good to chop wood? Yes, undoubtedly; but it is also good to render woodcutting in art. Then why should not the woodcutter be an artist? Why should he not chop miracles of carving? The Michael An gelo of Fontainebleau? Why not? What does Browning say? “I want to know the butcher paints, the baker rhymes for his pursuit,” and so on. Very well; then what do you do that is truly good? That is, unnecessarily, supererogatively, and therefore super latively good? You, my friend! You chop wood. Good. You cherish a fair wife; you have strong children to defend the fatherland. Good again. You eat, you drink, you make merry: all good. But do you achieve fame? No. Glory? No. Are you a great sai nt? No. A great artist? No. A great sinner? No. Nothing great? No. Very well, then: not good. Rise up, man! (the peroration) Be not slothful, be ambitious! Be statesman, artist, divine, strategist, inventor; nay, thief or murderer, if you will! But do not be content to chop wood! During this quarter of an hour of eloquence his was not the only discourse. The fair friend of the philosopher, eager to impress men in her way as he in his, and equally omnivorous, was busy with Placide Gervez. F irst a sidelong glance struck armour quite impenetrable to such assault, quickly followed by smiles first secret and then open, gestures at first subtle and at last unmistakable, finally by the unspeakable grimace of the tongue which she had learnt in her time at the red - shuttered convent in the Rue des Quatre Vents. Her triumph was that once the woodcutter struck aslant, and swore."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"THE WOODCUTTER 85 Théophraste ended his discourse, and, pleasantly parting, sauntered off with his mistress, arm - in - arm. Neither of them giv e their victim another thought. Out of the wood they went, and (thank God!) out of the story. But Placide leant upon his axe and stared after them. In his brain one thought only remained, which Théophraste might have formulated logically as “Some men do not chop wood.” And in his heart and eye was a dull animal lust. Two strangers had come to his soul’s Inn. There being only one room, he put them to bed together, in this form of something like it: “Chop — chop — chop — chop; I’m sick of it. Even if I had a fine girl from Paris like that, what could I do but chop — chop — chop — chop?” For the first time in his life he went home half an hour earlier than his custom, to the accompaniment of a terrific thunderstorm that rolled up from the valley of the Loing and fel l like night upon the forest, like a dark winter's night that afternoon of May. He was wet to the skin before he reached his hut. Opening the door, he glowered with dull surprise. Equally wet, standing in one corner and wringing out a blouse, was a girl of about twenty years old, an Amazon maid. He could see that she was a lady — that is, that she was not a villager; but he had no means of knowing that she was the Honourable Diana Villiers - Jernyngham - Ketteringham. Placide spoke a patois that a Parisian m ight have surmised to be Cherokee, and Diana's boarding - school French would have been given up by that Parisian as no earthly language at all."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 86 She told him that she was staying at the Savoy Hotel at Fontainebleau, and had gone for a walk and lost her way in the forest; and she asked him how far was it to the nearest village, and would he please take her there, and she would give him money. All this while Placide lit his fire, and proceeded to cook beans. He did not understand her, or try to understand he r. There was a strange animal in his hut, possibly a human animal; it might like beans; he would offer it beans. It was not his affair; his affair was to chop — chop — chop — chop. Diana was a little afraid of this silent beast at first. But the offer of food seemed kindly, and she ate some beans lest he should take offence, found them surprisingly good, nodded satisfaction, and even asked for more. This part concluded, she went to the door. The rain poured unceasingly; the forest stood in pools; and it was too dark to tell one tree from another. The woodcutter joined her, shook his head, said “far” and “to - morrow,” and pointed to a heap of straw. This strong - minded young lady knew when to bow to the inevitable; she took an armful of the straw, and retiring with it to the other end of the hut, made the sleep sign which every savage understands, and lay down. Placide Gervez grunted assent, and lying down with a surly “Bon soir” dropped instantly to sleep. How was he to know what dreams would echo his quarte r of an hour with the two philosophers of Paris? About eleven o'clock the next morning some the well - horsed search - party from Fontainebleau reached the hut."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"THE WOODCUTTER 87 At the door, as carefully stacked as the rest, they found the severed limbs of the Honourable Dia na.

But she was a hard - working orphan, too, with no relations but a semi - mythical brother on the Yukon who had not found enoug h gold to send her any; and she earned her living — two pounds a week — as violinist to the splendid tea - parties of the Hotel Escoffier. Her liking for Professor Zircon was little more than a child’s, though the shaggy - headed old analyst told another story to his brother experts at the War Office. And indeed, though her nature was incapable of great passion, what she had she gave, and to the innocence of a child added a dog’s fidelity and trust. Professor Zircon was a happy old man; he called her his Chlorid e of Gold. Muriel means salt, you know, he would explain to the fellows at the club, and salt is a compound of hydrochloric or muriatic acid — I wonder if we shall produce a little Zirconium Chloride! At this jest thus elaborated he was wont to laugh seven time a week; and trot happily back to his house in Kensington for dinner. Seven times a week he would let himself in through the laboratory and pretend surprise when he found Muriel reading a novelette in his own armchair. “What, what! and how the deuce did you get in?” or “Tut! tut! my dear madam, to what am I indebted for the honour of this visit?” or “I beg a thousand pardons, madam, I really thought this was my house,” and Muriel, genuinely pleased and amused, would enter into the little comedy,"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 92 alw ays ending up with kisses in the old armchair, and a dainty dinner. This had continued for nearly three years with no interruption but once when the Professor's wife, from whom he had long been separated, succeeded in getting into the house on some preten ce, and creating a very considerable uproar before the professor and his butler could master her rage. She was a big muscular woman from Australia with the body of a tiger and the temper of a snake. She would have made a winning fight of it but for Zirco n's adroit sortie to the laboratory and timely return with a bottle of chloroform. The professor dined alone that night; at the very outset of the battle Muriel had fled in tears to the little room in Walham Green where she lived under the alleged guardia nship of a most paunchy ex - dresser. No other incident disturbed the ripples of their harmless, petty liaison. Even the earlier rumours of the brother in Alaska had died down to folk - lore. The Professor had never got away from his work in time to hear he r play the fiddle; anyhow, he hated music. Nor had Muriel ever stayed too late to alarm her landlady, who thought she played at supper as well as at tea. The illness of the Secretary of War alarmed only the German Ambassador, who could not be positive t hat in case of his death an accident might not happen and a capable person be appointed to the post. The annoyance of his death — telephoned to the Office at three o’clock one afternoon — was concentrated on Professor Zircon, torn away from a compound with h alf the Greek Alphabet dotted about its name by a white - haired little Colonel who"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"PROFESSER ZIRCON 93 assured him that it really wasn't decent. “We won't go to the Club, dear man. We'll just drop in at the Escoffier for tea.” The Professor grunted an assent; but he was mor e than half pleased. He wondered what his fairy looked like in her butterfly wings. The lounge of the Escoffier was full of people; but right across the room Professor Zircon could see Muriel with cornflowers in her yellow - ashen hair and her simple musli n dress. But she wore the diamonds he had given her, a string of starlight at her neck. How well he remembered that evening! He had taken her into the laboratory and heated up some sugar with sulphuric acid, loving her amazement as it swelled and blac kened. “That is carbon now,” he had said, “if we could only crystalize it, what splendid diamonds we could have! But we can’t — not to any effect. Diamonds are always found in a kind of blue mud — I suppose there can't be any here?” leading her to a box f ull of modelling clay which he used in some of his experiments. And he made her dive and dirty her dear little fingers ever so, before she ran against the necklace. And when they retrieved it quite, and washed it, and he put it round her neck for her v ery own! She played in her demure, modest way; not very good, but pleasing enough to people who only wanted an excuse for not having to think sufficiently to talk while they wolfed foie gras and watercress, muffins and eclairs, cheesecakes and hot buttere d toast. And she seemed to care as little for them as they for her.

Suddenly the Professor paled. A last glance over his shoulder showed him that a bearded man had risen and was handing a flower to Muriel. And Mur iel was blushing and trembling with some emotion too profound to estimate, but clear enough to the analyst. When a man has detected a thousandth of a grain of atropine in the carcass of a barmaid, he does not hesitate to read the heart of a girl. And as a Government expert he was clothed with official infallibility — a triple buckler. He went on casually talking to the Colonel for a few minutes before politeness allowed him to throw himself into a moving taxicab and roar his address at the astonished drive r. It was the first time he had come home to an empty house since he had picked up Muriel on an omnibus and carried her off to a discreet Italian restaurant near Sloane Square where a flask of Chianti emptied to the bottom had left not a dreg of discretio n. The arm - chair shocked him. This was the last time that she would sit in it, the false little harlot! The eternal emptiness of things, the unbreakable solitude of life, struck a chill to his marrow. How was he to know that only by uttermost surrender of the self to the Beloved can that curse be broken?"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"PROFESSER ZIRCON 95 Then a gleam of sanity crossed the bigoted scientific mind of the man. She might be able to explain. But he brushed away the idea. How can a fact ever be upset? Credulity itself is reason compared to the mind of the logician who has once allowed emotion to infect his brain, who has missed the factor of the personal equation. The idea returned. So long she had sat there in her childish purity that the conservatism of his hard old brain reacted. It could not be. Things could not change. Yet? In the upshot he was English enough to try her before condemning her, German enough to lay a trap for her in the very nature of that trial. His consideration passed from judgment to execution, and his face s et like a mask. Ultimately he went to a small safe in the wall, took out a half - hoop diamond ring, and dropped it into the coal - scuttle. Reward or punishment! Either the old trick — or a new one! He turned on his heel and went softly into the laboratory. Meanwhile Muriel Madox tripped along from the Escoffier in the bright February air. Her heart was very light and very anxious. The incident of the afternoon — should she tell the Professor? Concealment was foreign to her nature; for the first time in her life she hesitated. How would it affect their relations? It would be better to think it over, to sleep on it. It never occurred to her for a moment that the Professor might already know. In the end she decided to say nothing; but so absorbed had been her tiny brain in its little problem that"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 96 she forgot the obvious corollary of removing the flower from her dress. She was nestled in the arm - chair when the old analyst tiptoed into the room and clapped his hands over her eyes. “Who is it?” said he gaily. “Why, you're Jack from Alaska, of course,” she answered, laughing. “Guess again?” And the child guessed the German Emperor, and Lewis Waller, and everyone else she could think of. “Wrong.” “Wrong.” “Wrong.” “Why,” she cried, jumping up and facing him, “it's Professor Zircon! The last person in the world I should have expected to find here!” She threw her arms round his neck and called him a “dear silly.” “Well, what's the news, child?” “No news. I'm so sorry the chief's dead.” “Doesn't matter to m e. What a pretty flower in your dress!” She had an instinct of sudden and terrible danger; and lied instantly. “I bought it for your buttonhole.” And she fastened it there. Professor Zircon called her a sweet, thoughtful fairy, and gave her a kiss. S uch a shudder ran through him as rarely stirred his veins. He had some flash of memory, of Judas, perhaps, signalled across the forty years since he had heard the legend of the Gospels at his mother's knee. “But there is news!” he added gaily. \"I'm going to show you my great discovery.

Now we'll see if we've managed to crystallize any coal\" So the child began to hunt in the scuttle, and in a few minutes found the ring glittering in its dusty setting, like the eyes of a snake in the jungle. “Oh, you darling!” she cried. “Oh, you old fraud! You said nothing about making gold!” “Ah! that's a little accident,” replied the Professor. “Discoveries never come singly.” “And is it really for me? All my very own?” “Who else should it be for, darli ng?” “You're a darling sweet boy.” “Run away and wash your hands! I've warmed up your own element for you, you dear little Spirit of Salt!” She ran gleefully into the laboratory. On the bench stood the basin she had used so often, with the soap and towel s neatly at its side. She seized the soap, and plunged both hands into the nearly boiling hydrochloric acid. Then she turned her head to him, her mouth a tragic square, incapable even of uttering even a shriek. “How will you play the fiddle,” screamed Z ircon, “with no fingers? How will you play the harlot? I saw you and your lover. There's his flower!” He flung it at her. “But I'm even with you — Oh! I'm even with you!” And he foamed into a spate of the filthiest abuse. It broke the spell.

She fell on the floor fainting. “Vile thing!” screamed Zircon, spurning her with his foot. He choked: his brain fell suddenly clear with the lucidity of intellect. He walked into the dining - room, and whistled as he walked. There he sat down. The next move in his infernal revenge was the waking of Muriel, and that might be soon or late. He had not calcu lated the effect of waiting; his nerves cried out. For the first time he had a glimpse of the doctrine of eternal punishment — perceived that the resurrection of the body was no necessary condition. Tortured, he gazed upon the second hand of his watch. He could have sworn it stopped, when it shook and staggered on with the importance of Big Ben, and he realized that his own time - sense was radically upset. He wondered if it was the same with her — the devil in him gloated. “A gentleman to see you, sir!” sai d he butler, opening the door. “He wouldn't give his name!” “I’ll see him,” said Zircon, as blithe as a lark. “Show him in!” In strode the bearded stranger of the afternoon. “You damned scoundrel!” he addressed the smiling Professor. “So this is where m y sister spends her evenings!

Into this trap fell even the author of the injunction, “De mortuis nil nisi bonum,” though one may concede that it was exc usable, even creditable, in him to have been unable to foresee my Uncle. Born, as will presently become clear, in the earliest years of the reign of Queen Victoria, his genius quickly developed. He had that simplicity of vision, that flashing insight, wh ich stamps the highest types of intelligence. When only six years old, while meditating on the increasing difficulty of earning an honest living, and the increasing risk of earning a dishonest one, he saw a fond mother give her little boy a penny to buy sweets. In a single second his mind was made up; his career was determined. How, thrilled the Master - Thought — how can I get that penny? A rapid calculation assured him of the soundness of his instinct. Probably at least a hundred thousand mothers — of the world's six hundred million — give a penny to some child every day. A hundred thousand pence a day is over a hundred and fifty thousand pounds a year; if he could only get ten per cent. of that, he wouldn't be doing so badly."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 246 That night, as he said his pra yers at his mother's knee, she was surprised and pleased to hear a new petition: “And oh! dear Jesus, do let me do ever such a great work for other little children! Bring them all in! Don't let me miss one out.” Hot stuff for six, I don't think. It was ev ident, to his astuteness and business capacity, that this work demanded the most complete organization. He therefore obtained a post under the Government, so that, while touching a good salary, his whole time was free to devote to his great scheme. “Punc tuality,” he often said to me, “is the thief of time; procrastination is the soul of business,” and would justify his paradox by pointing out that if you only left letters unanswered long enough, the need to answer them disappeared. His system, in fact, b ecame extremely popular; even Charles Dickens playfully animadverts upon it in one of his novels. A secretary being necessary to him, he pressed his sister A —— into the service, thereby saving her from such terrible temptations as love, marriage, or even o ccasional relaxation, which is known to be the devil’s subtlest engine, and saving himself from the expense of hiring a drudge. He applied the same fine intelligence to all the problems of life. Onanism, he argued, is demonstrably safe and eco - nomical; f urther, it is secret, and can be passed off as chastity; hence credit with the pious. Again, “I am out to get the money that parents give their children; I am the sole Inventor of the ‘Kinchin - lay’; and I am certainly not going to queer my own pitch by g etting children.

At least it is certain that nothing was ever brought home to him. While he was still a young man he definitely founded an organization on the lines of the well - known and justly admired Children's Scripture Union. He issued a card, price one penny, with the days of the year, and a “portion of Scripture” indicated for reading on this day. As the card could be prepared in half an hour by any one, and printed at about fourpence halfpenny a hundred, there was a small but suffic ient margin of profit — or would have been but for the expense of getting the scheme under way. My uncle's genius never hesitated. “Of all the puppies on earth, the ‘pi’ set at Cambridge are the most priggish,” he exclaimed enthusiastically. So he got hold of a few, and called them Evangelists. They were to go down (of course, at their own expense) to the seaside — where the children with the pennies were, not to the slums, where there were plenty of children but no pennies — and hold “services,” the object of all which was to sell these cards, and force the unhappy infant who was really interested in Judges to switch off to Leviticus. Christian parents were, however, quick to see that my uncle’s genius had forged a new tyranny, and his scheme had the heartiest of receptions. The Children's Special Service Mission had met with un - qualified success; his own might easily match it, so he surmised — as the event proved, justly.

My uncle was now in a position to develop his scheme fully, and the ri ng of philanthropic blackmailers and black - guards who run religious charities were compelled to admit him to a share of the spoils. He founded a Magazine, with some external and internal resemblance to that excellent paper, Our Own Magazine , which, with co nsummate impudence, he declared to contain nothing but true stories. These stories are usually about the good little girl who “converts” the horrid, swearing bargee, and the good little boy who brings his “thoughtless” mother to Jesus. This, being a mon thly, brought in another twelve pennies annually from every victim. He also published leaflets which he could sell by the hundred to the kind of idiot that likes to give such things to strangers who have never done it any harm. He had all these things tr anslated into dozens of languages, and the rill of pennies swelled to a mighty river. By this time his sister A —— was worn out, and died. For a month he had to pay a typist; but she little knew my uncle if she thought she had a permanent job. He rushed off to some ghastly Welsh “resort,” to be acclaimed as the Founder of the Faith by the flourishing branch of the “Mission” which he had established there, and, selecting a female with features and character of an anæmic cow, married her and her money, sac ked the typist, and settled down as the principal ornament of London's most suburban “subbub.” I suppose none even of his accomplices will regret his death; to the lachrymal glands of a crocodile he added the bowels of compassion of a cast - iron rhinoceros ; with the"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"AN OBITUARY 249 meanness and cruelty of a eunuch he combined the calculating avarice of a Scotch Jew, without the whisky of the one or the sympathetic imagination of the other.

A ∴ A ∴ "},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":" PREFACE AN any good thing come out of Palestine? is the broader anti - Semetic retort to the sneer cast by the Jews themselves against the harmless and natural Nazarene; one more example of the poetic justice of History. And no doubt such opponents of the modern Jew will acclaim this volume as an admirable disproof of that thesis which it purports to uphold. The dissimilarities, amounting in some case s to sheer contradiction, which mark many numbers, will appear proof positive that there is nothing in this numerical Qabalah, especially as we may presume that by filling up this dictionary from the ordinary Hebrew Lexicon one would arrive at a mere hotch - pot. Apart from this, there is a deeper - lying objection to the Qabalah; viz., that the theory is an example of the fallacy Post hoc propter hoc. Are we to believe, askes the sceptic, that a number of learned men deliberately sat down and chose words for t he sake of their numerical value? Language is a living thing, with many sources and diverse; can it be moulded in any such arbitrary fashion? The only reply seems to be a mere assertion that to some extent it certainly is so. Examples of a word being spe lt deliberately wrong do occur; and such a jugglery as the changing of the names Abram and Sarai to Abraham and Sarah can hardly be purposeless. Once admit the end of such a wedge, and it is difficult to say whether it may not be driven home so far as to split asunder the Tree of Knowledge, if not the Tree of Life. Another line or argument is the historical. We do not here refer to the alleged forgery of the Qabalah by Rabbi Moses ben Leon — was it not? — but to the general position of the ethnologist that th e Jews were an entirely barbarous race, incapable of any spiritual pursuit. That they were polytheists is clear from the very first verse of Genesis; that Adonai Melekh is identical with “Moloch” is known to every Hebraist. The “Old Testament” is mainly the history of the struggle of the phallic Jehovah against the rest of the Elohim, and that his sacrifices were of blood, and human blood at that, is indisputable. C"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"PREFACE iv Human sacrifices are to - day still practised by the Jews of Eastern Europe, as is set forth a t length by the late Sir Richard Burton in the MS. which the wealthy Jews of England have compassed heaven and earth to suppress, and evidenced by the ever - recurring Pogroms against which so senseless and outcry is made by those who live among those degene rate Jews who are at least not cannibals. Is it to such people, indeed, that we are to look for the highest and sublest spiritual knowledge? To this criticism there are but two answers. The first, that an esoteric tradition of great purity may co - exist wi th the most crass exoteric practices. Witness the Upanishads in the land of Jagganath, hook - swinging, and the stupidest forms of Hatha - Yoga. Witness the Tipitaka (with such perfections as the Dhammapada) in the midst of peoples whose science of torture wo uld seem to have sprung from no merely human imagination. The descriptions in the Tipitaka itself of the Buddhist Hells are merely descriptions of the actual tortures inflicted by the Buddhists on their enemies. The second, that after all is said, I find it works very well. I do not care whether 1 − is an impossible, an unimaginable thing, or whether de Moivre really invented it, and if so, whether de Moivre was an immoral man, and wore whiskers. It helps me to make certain calculatio ns; and so long as that is so, it is useful, and I stick to it. Other criticisms of the methods of the Qabalah itself have been made and disposed of in the article on the subject in “The Temple of Solomon the King” (Equinox V) and no further reference nee d be made to them in this place. It is only necessary to say that that article should be studied most thoroughly, and also the article “A Note on Genesis” in the second number of The Equinox.

the whole numbers from 1 to n inclusive and is the number of ways in which n diffe rent things can be arranged. Sub - factorial n , or || n , is the nearest whole number to n ÷ e , and is the number of ways in which a row of n elements may be so deranged, that no element may have its original position.

The software I used to set up mathematical expressions cannot cope with the notation Cr owley used to represent factorials. In the expressions for || n and e I have therefore substituted the modern use of n ! for n factorial. 0 ! is conventionally defined as 1 ; for a positive integer n , n ! is thus equal to ( n - 1 )! × n . e is defined as the sum from n = 0 to infinity of 1 /( n !), otherwise written: ∑ ∞ = ≡ 0 i i e ! While I am not familiar with the notation of sub - factorials used here, I will observe that if we similarly define sub - factorial 0 as 1 (again, simply a s a convenience) then for any positive integer n , || n = n × || ( n - 1 ) + ( - 1) n . [ ( - 1) n = 1 if n be even, - 1 if n be odd.] Or we could have a computer do it thus (using the conventional notation of the C programming language): int subfact (int n) { if (n < 1) return 1; /* strictly speaking should be undefined for negative numbers */ else return (n*subfact(n - 1) + 1 – 2*(n%2)); /* 1 - 2*(n%2) is 1 if n be even, - 1 if n be odd */ } Similarly, the rather ugly expression for || n given in the preface simp lifies to: ... ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! + − + − 3 2 1 0 n n n n to n + 1 terms; or, in sigma notation, ∑ = − n i i i n 0 1 ! ! ) ( I have made alterations to the page of abbreviations, signs and figures to reflect actual use. The notation of a box around a number to indicate a perfect squa re is used only in the table of factors; in the main table a root symbol was used. Similarly, we were informed that “R (n) before [a number shows that the number is] a reciprocal (or ‘amicable’) number” which is nowhere defined and nowhere used. The prin ted edition did not explain that p was used in the main table to denote prime numbers. A “perfect” number is one which is the sum of its factors (including 1 ), e.g. 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 ; 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 ; 496 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 31 + 62 + 124 + 248 . The citations of “S.D. ii. 467 ” in the entries for 157 and 227 refer not to the Sepher Dtzenouthia but to Blavatsky’s Secret Doctrine . My thanks to Tim Maroney for this information. Pietro di Abano was neither the actual nor the imputed author of the “Arbatel of Magick” ( de magia vete rum ), in fact “Arbatel” may well have been meant as the author’s name. The first and only known book of the “Arbatel” (an outline description of the work lists nine volumes) was printed as Basle in 1575 and bound up in vol. i of the Lyons edition (ca. 160 0 ) of Cornelius Agrippa’s Opera which included the Heptameron , a short Grimoire of planetary magick spuriously attributed to d’Abano. References to page numbers in 777 have been changed to refer to column numbers. Finally, I will note that this etext of Li ber D was completely re - entered by myself, and I take full responsibility for any errors in it which do not occur in the printed edition. I have corrected a few errors which could be dealt with within the entry for a given number: many words are mis - spelt , and placed at the correct numeration for the mis - spelling. — T.S.]"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":" 253 REVIEWS M Y P SYCHIC R ECOLLECTIONS .

Probably Mr. George will say (with a maiden blush) that his novel is none the worse fo r that; he would deny the truth of the poet’s vision — insist that the cosmos is but incoherency of heterogeneous incident. I may, however, urge with more hope of his attention that his novel breaks off at the really interesting part. What did Suzette say? Did the family tyranny make a man of Henri?

A DMIRABLE , this Odyssey of emasculation. The verse is at all times facile and clever beyond all praise, though there are three or four faulty rhymes, and I cannot pass (twice) “pleeceman” and “pleece,” unless they are so spelt. The story is very typical and very tragic. An idle youth without en ough guts even to go wrong. When, after infinite struggle, he gets into debt, an aunt conveniently dies and leaves him everything. After innumerable mild philanderings, not one of which brings him even within whistling distance of the méthode du Dr. Fern andez , he returns to the lady whose acres adjoin his own; and Mr. Frankau, with consummate art, leaves us uncertain whether he will even summon up the energy to marry her. Smart, shallow, shoddy society in every clime is pictured admirably well; this book will be a classic, in a hundred years, for its historical interest. But it behoves somebody to write a commentary within the next twelve months, or a good third of the allusions will be for ever unintelligible. It is one of the most readable books I have struck for a long while; alas! that so depressing a portrait should be so real. Anarchy would become the only thinkable political creed if “One of Us” represented more than a negligible and almost outworn fringe of the antimacassar of society. A LEISTER C ROWLEY .

BY ALEISTER CROWLEY The “Daily Mail” says — “This is a garland of some fifty or sixty devotional hymns to the Virgin, in which the author, while not excee ding the bounds of Catholic orthodoxy, fills his verses with quaint and charming conceits, very much in the style of the ‘metaphysical’ poets of the seventeenth century. Indeed, in turning over the pages of ‘Amphora,’ as the little volume was entitled w hen published anonymously two years ago, by Burns & Oates, we feel them to be the work of a recipient of the tradition of Vaughan the Silurist, George Herbert, and Crashaw, although Mr. Crowley is smooth where they are rugged, plain where they are perple xing. “These poems indicate a mind full of earnest aspiration towards his spiritual Queen, a mind of an engaging naiveté, un - troubled by the religious and philosophical problems which weary more complex intelligences. This little work can be cordially re commended to Catholic readers.” Father Kent writes in “The Tablet” — “Among the many books which benevolent publishers are preparing as appropriate Christmas presents we notice many new editions of favourite poetic classics. But few, we fancy, can be mor e appropriate for the purpose than a little volume of original verses, entitled 'Amphora,' which Messrs. Burns & Oates are on the point of publishing. The following stanzas from a poem on the Nativity will surely be a better recommendation of the book t han any words of critical appreciation: “The Virgin lies at Bethlehem. (Bring gold and frankincense and myrrh!) The root of David shoots a stem. (O Holy Spirit, shadow her!) “She lies alone am id the kine. (Bring gold and frankincense and myrrh!) The straw is fragrant as with wine. (O Holy Spirit, shadow her!)” Lieut. - Col. Gormley writes — “The hymns ordinarily used in churches for devotional purposes are no doubt excellent in their way, but it can scarcely be said, in the case of many of them, that they are of much literary merit, and some of them indeed are little above the familiar nursery rhymes of our childhood; it is therefore somewhat of a relief an d a pleasure to read the volume of hymns to the Virgin Mary which has just been published by Messrs. Burns & Oates. These hymns to the Virgin Mary are in the best style, they are devotional in the highest degree, and to Roman Catholics, for whom devotion to the Virgin Mary forms so important a part of their religious belief, these poems should indeed be welcome; personally I have found them just what I desired, and I have no doubt other Catholics will be equally pleased with them.\" “Vanity Fair” says — “To t he ordinary mind passion has no relation to penitence, and carnal desire is the very anti - thesis of spiritual fervour. But close observers of human nature are accustomed to discover an intimate connection between the forces of the body and the soul; and the student of psychology is continually being reminded of the kinship between saint and sinner. Now and then we find the extremes of self and selflessness in the same soul. Dante tells us how the lover kissed the trembling mouth, and with the same th rill describes his own passionate abandonment before the mystic Rose. In our own day, the greatest of French lyric poets, Verlaine, has given us volumes of the most passionate love songs, and side by side with them a book of religious poetry more sublim ely credulous and ecstatic than anything that has come down to us from the Ages of faith. We are all, as Sainte - Beuve said, ‘children of a sensual literature,’ and perhaps for that reason we should expect from our singers fervent religious hymns. “There is one of London's favourites almost unrivalled to express by her art the delights of the body with a pagan simplicity and directness. Now she sends us a book, ‘Amphora,’ a volume of religious verse: it contains song after song in praise of Mary,” etc. etc. etc. The “Scotsman” says — “Outside the Latin Church conflicting views are held about the worship of the Virgin, but there can be no doubt that this motive of religion has given birth to many beautiful pieces of literature, and the poets have never ti red of singing variations on the theme of ‘Hail Mary.’ This little book is best described here as a collection of such variations. They are written with an engaging simplicity and fervour of feeling, and with a graceful, refined literary art that cannot but interest and attract many readers beyond the circles of such as must feel it religiously impossible not to admire them.” The “Daily Telegraph” says — “In this slight volume we have the utterances of a devout anonymous Roman Catholic singer, in a numbe r of songs or hymns addressed to the Virgin Mary. The author, who has evidently a decided gift for sacred verse and has mastered varied metres suitable to her high themes, divides her poems into four series of thirteen each — thus providing a song for eac h week of the year. The songs are all of praise or prayer addressed to the Virgin, and though many have a touch of mysticism, most have a simplicity of expression and earnestness of devotion that will commend them to the author's co - religionists.” The “ Catholic Herald” says — “This anonymous volume of religious verse reaches a very high level of poetic imagery. It is a series of hymns in honour of Our Lady, invariably expressed in melodious verse. The pitfalls of religious verse are bathos and platitud e, but these the sincerity of the writer and a certain mastery over poetic expression have enabled him — or her — to avoid. The writer of such verse as the following may be complimented on a very high standard of poetic expression: “The shadows fall about the way; Strange faces glimmer in the gloom; The soul clings feebly to the clay, For that, the void; for this, the tomb! “But Mary sheds a blessed light; Her perfect face dispels the fears. She charms Her melancholy knight Up to the glad and gracious spheres. “ O Mary, like a pure perfume Do thou receive this falling breath, And with Thy starry lamp illume The darkling corridors of death!” The “Catholic Times” says — “The ‘Amphora’ is a collection of poems in honour of our Blessed Lady. They are arranged in four books, each of which contains thirteen pieces. Thus with the prol ogue there are fifty - three poems in all. Needless to say they breathe a spirit of deep piety and filial love towards our Heavenly Mother. Many beautiful and touching thoughts are embodied in the various verses, which cannot but do good to the pious soul .” The “Staffordshire Chronicle” says — “Under this title there has appeared an anonymous volume of verses breathing the same exotic fragrance of Rossetti’s poem on Our Lady that begins ‘Mother of the fair delight.’ There is the same intense pre - Raphaelit e atmosphere, the same aesthetic revelling in Catholic mysticism, the same rich imagery and gorgeous word - colouring that pervade the poetic works of that nineteenth - century artist. A valuable addition to the poetic literature on the Mother of our Lord.” The “Guardian” says — “The devotional fervour of ‘Amphora’ will make them acceptable to those who address their worship to the Blessed Mother of the Christ. The meaning of the title of the book is not very obvious. It cannot surely have anything to do wi th the lines in Horace, ‘Amphora coepit,’ ” etc. The “Catholic Times” says — “As far as we can gather from his other works, the author is not a Catholic, perhaps not even, strictly speaking, a Christian; but here we have page after page of most exquisite pra ise of Her, whom Wordsworth greeted as ‘our tainted nature's solitary boast,’ until one marvels at the fecundity of concept, imagery, and fit expression.”"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":" OCCULTISM To the readers of “The Equinox.” — All who are interested in curious old Literature should w rite to FRANK HOLLINGS for his Catalogue of over 1000 items.

The original work, of which this is a translation, is uni que, no other copy being known, although both Bulwer Lytton and Eliphas Levi were well aware of its existence; the former having based part of his description of the sage Rosicrucian Menjour on that of Abra - Melin, while the account of the so - called Observa tory of Sir Philip Derval in the Strange Story was, to some extent, copied from that of the Magical Oratory and Terrace given in the present work. There are also other interesting points too numerous to be given here in detail. It is felt therefore that by its publication a service is rendered to lovers of rare and curious Books, and to Students of Occultism, by placing within their reach a magical work of so much importance, and one so interestingly associated with the respective authors of Zanoni and of t he Dogma and Ritual of Transcendental Magic . The Magical Squares or combinations of letters, placed in a certain manner, are said to possess a peculiar species of automatic intelligent vitality, apart from any of the methods given for their use; and stude nts are recommended to make no use of these whatever unless this higher Divine Knowledge is approached in a frame of mind worthy of it.

It is all very splendid. . . . We feel drearily sensible of our outer darkness.

B. Neuburg’s ‘Triumph of Pan’ (‘The Equinox’ Office), much of which merits the ambiguous distinction of being unusual. Though by no means deficient in originality, vigour or imaginative power, his verse is too often cumbered with the fantastic symbols of a species of erotic my sticism, into which we feel no desire to probe; while the lack of reticence consistently displayed constitutes an artistic blemish not lightly to be excused. The author’s serene confidence in the immortality of his lays would be better justified were he to make some attempt to discriminate between the gold and the rubbish, and, incidentally, refraining from penning such grotesque - ness as is contained, for example, in ‘The Sunflower,’ where we are informed how, among other portents —  “ ‘a greater god arose, And stole the earth by standing on his toes And blowing through the air.’ “It is difficult to believe that the persons to whom certain poems are inscribed will experience any very lively gratification at the compliment.” — Athenaeum . “. . . really notable fluency and fecundity of expression. . . .

In the author of the present collection of poems . . . we have a veritable twentieth - century mystic and apostle of ecstasy who, according to his dedication, gives his songs —  “ ‘By the sign that is black and forbidden,  By the word that is uttered no more.’ “'The Triumph of Pan,' from which the book borrows its title, is a remarkable sequence of some for ty ‘philosophic and ecstatic’ stanzas . . . he would also seem to ‘hold opinion with Pythagoras’ although we question if even Nietzsche himself could quite fathom the undercurrent of the lay. . . . Despite occasional extravagances in thought and in dict ion his work is that of a cultured scholar, his verbal artistry undeniably inspired with the true spirit of poetry. Whether he sings of ‘Violet skies all rimmed in tune,’ of red ravens, of purple kisses, of silver stars ‘crested with amber melody,’ or of the 'rhythmic sway of the idle moon,' he is always musical albeit, like Wagner, whose effects he now and then distinctly recalls, often utterly unintelligible. . . .

A ∴ A ∴ PUBLICATION IN CLASS B. ====================== BOOK 777 HIS book contains in concise tabulated form a comparative view of all the symbols of the great religions of the world; the perfect attributions of the Taro, so long kept secret by the Rosicruci ans, are now for the first time published; also the complete secret magical correspondences of the G ∴ D ∴ and R. R. et A. C. It forms, in short, a complete magical and philosophical dictionary; a key to all religions and to all practical occult working. Fo r the first time Western and Qabalistic symbols have been harmonized with those of Hinduism, Buddhism, Mohammedanism, Taoism, &c. By a glance at the Tables, anybody conversant with any one system can understand perfectly all others. The Occult Review says: “Despite its cumbrous sub - title and high price per page, this work has only to come under the notice of the right people to be sure of a ready sale. In its author’s words, it represents ‘an attempt to systematise alike the data of mysticism and the result s of comparative religion,’ and so far as any book can succeed in such an attempt, this book does succeed; that is to say, it condenses in some sixty pages as much information as many an intelligent reader at the Museum has been able to collect in years. The book proper consists of a Table of ‘Correspondences,’ and is, in fact, an attempt to reduce to a common denominator the symbolism of as many religious and magical systems as the author is acquainted with. The denominator chosen is necessarily a large one, as the author's object is to reconcile systems which divide all things into 3, 7, 10, 12, as the case may be. Since our expression ‘common denominator' is used in a figurative and not in a strictly mathematical sense, the task is less complex than ap pears at first sight, and the 32 Paths of the Sepher Yetzirah, or Book of Formation of the Qabalah, provide a convenient scale. These 32 Paths are attributed by the Qabalists to the 10 Sephiroth, or Emanations of Deity, and to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, which are again subdivided into 3 mother letters, 7 double letters, and 12 simple letters. On this basis, that of the Qabalistic ‘Tree of Life,' as a certain arrangement of the Sephiroth and 22 remaining Paths connecting them is termed, the autho r has constructed no less than 183 tables. “The Qabalistic information is very full, and there are tables of Egyptian and Hindu deities, as well as of colours, perfumes, plants, stones, and animals. The information concerning the tarot and geomancy excee ds that to be found in some treatises devoted exclusively to those subjects. The author appears to be acquainted with Chinese, Arabic, and other classic texts. Here your reviewer is unable to follow him, but his Hebrew does credit alike to him and to his printer. Among several hundred words, mostly proper names, we found and marked a few misprints, but subsequently discovered each one of them in a printed table of errata, which we had overlooked. When one remembers the misprints in ‘Agrippa’ and the fac t that the ordinary Hebrew compositor and reader is no more fitted for this task than a boy cognisant of no more than the shapes of the Hebrew letters, one wonders how many proofs there were and what the printer’s bill was. A knowledge of the Hebrew alpha bet and the Qabalistic Tree of Life is all that is needed to lay open to the reader the enormous mass of information contained in this book. The ‘Alphabet of Mysticism,’ as the author says — several alphabets we should prefer to say — is here. Much that has b een jealously and foolishly kept secret in the past is here, but though our author has secured for his work the imprimatur of some body with the mysterious title of the A ∴ A ∴ , and though he remains himself anonymous, he appears to be no mystery - monger. Ob viously he is widely read, but he makes no pretence that he has secrets to reveal. On the contrary, he says, ‘an indicible arcanum is an arcanum which cannot be revealed.’ The writer of that sentence has learned at least one fact not to be learned from b ooks. “G.C.J.” T"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":" WILLIAM NORTHAM, ROBEMAKER, 9 Henrietta Street, Southampton Street, Strand T ELEPHONE — 5400 Central MR.

The following full - page plug for Book 4 appeared on the back board of the first edition. The music scores at the beginning are presented as 150 d.p.i. black and white scans; this seems about the limit at which they remain rea dable. I have neither the patience nor the knowledge of musical notation necessary to re - set them. In The Symbolic Representation of the Universe , a number of apparent errors occur in both the texts and translations of the Angelic Keys or Calls. With the exception of what appeared to be obvious typos these have not been corrected; the student is directed to sources like James ( Enochian Evocation , a.k.a. Enochian Magick of Doctor John Dee ), Turner ( Elizabethean Magic ) and Laycock ( Enochian Dictionary ), as well as to the electronic version of this text annotated by myself, online at http://www.geocities.com/nu_isis/liber084.pdf The Ankh design for the Tarot has been re - drawn and coloured. It has not, however, been completely conformed to the description in the text: adding the names of the Trumps to the circle would make an unreadable mess of it; and the Taurus sign and pentacle would have to be made disproportionately small to fit in the Earth space where the arms of the Tau join. The writing in Theban scr ipt at the top reads HRU not HUA and should be read left to right (the Theban script corresponds to the Latin alphabet, not the Hebrew). Some errors in the printed edition of the Tarot paper (planetary symbols and Hebrew names of the angels; the composito r consistently gave Kaph for Nun) have been corrected (the majority by Heidrick). Only a few of the erro r s in Sepher Sephiroth have been corrected in this edition; see my notes at the end of that text. In notes to his key entry, Bill Heidrick remarks that in the original the body of the work was printed single - sided. Heidrick also remarks of Sepher Sephiroth : Some curiosity will undoubtedly be evoked by the many Latin meanings of Hebrew words given below. Most of these are directly from the glossary in Ka bbalah Denudata , but others are euphemisms for sexual terms. Kabbalah Denudata is available on microfilm, but no translation of the Latin or checking of the entries from that source or Kabbalah Unveiled by Mathers has been attempted yet. An extensive stud y of these entries will be included in the Gematria project now in process of compilation by Bill Heidrick. This project is expected to ultimately extend to several times the number of entries here, including notes of source, discussions of differences be tween Crowley's approach and that of traditional Qabalah and into new areas. I believe that some of Bill Heidrick’s Qabalistic researches have been published in the journal of Thelema Lodge, O . T .
