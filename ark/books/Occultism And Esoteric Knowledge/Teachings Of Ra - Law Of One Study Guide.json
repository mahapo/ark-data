[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION: CARLA CHANNELS RA I. CONSCIOUS CHANNELING During all the years that I had been channeling had always channeled consciously, using my free will to clothe telepathic concepts in my own language. II. THE 1ST TRANCE CHANNELING When Elaine, a member of the meditation group died, someone suggested that I try to contact her. I could not say no. After some moments of consciously offering myself for the contact with Elaine, I became unaware of the passing of time, and when I awakened, Tom had what sounded like Elaine’s voice on tape speaking through me. That was my first experience with trance. [Note: Carla had already been involved in scientific channeling research with questioner Dr. Don Elkins for over twenty years by this point. But up until now, her work had been from a conscious state only.] III. THE NEXT CONTACT WAS RA This work was extremely draining on me, and I did not want to continue. However, only a few days later I received a new contact which I had never had before. As I do in all cases I challenged this entity in the name of Christ, demanding that it leave if it did not come as a messenger of Christ Consciousness. It remained, so I opened myself to its channel. I went into trance almost immediately and the entity which called itself Ra began its series of contacts with us. This contact is ongoing, fascinating and to me, a source of some disquiet. (B1, 48-49) IV. PROCEDURE James gives Carla a half-hour back message before each session because she will have to remain absolutely motionless for between an hour and an hour and forty-five minutes. Then we meditate so that the harmony we try to produce in our daily lives will be intensified, and so our desires are unified into the single desire to see contact with Ra. We perform a ritual of protection and Carla lays down, covered with a white sheet. She mentally recites the Prayer of St. Francis. At some point the leaves her physical body, and Ra begins to use it to make the words which form the responses to Don's questions. James meditates and sends light to Carla for the duration of the session. (B1, 50-51) V. FATIGUE RA: Do you understand how to nurture this instrument (Carla)? At this time she is quite fatigued. 1. The laying on of hands at the neck region for a brief period. 2. A gift of water into which the love of all present has been given. The charging of the water is done by those present placing their hands over the glass and visualizing the power of love entering the water. This will charge that very effective medium with those vibrations. (B1, 69) THE MESSAGE OF RA  WHO IS RA? THE MESSAGE OF RA"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The sessions began on Jan 15, 1981 (Books I-IV published in 1982-1984; Book V published in 1998) DEFINITIONS 1. Social memory complex = a large group of completely integrated souls - or \"group soul” for short 2. Mind/body/spirit complex = person, human, or entity having free will 3. Catalyst = stimulus for growth, something that presents a chall1enge and an opportunity to learn a lesson. 4. Density = density of consciousness - or density of vibration (B4, 28). Frequently used by Ra as an analog to what is currently thought of as “dimensions” in the Universe. The densities are organized into an eight-fold “octave” system, analogous to the musical octave and the visual light spectrum. Therefore the higher the density, the higher the level of consciousness. 5. Wanderer = higher-density soul that has volunteered to incarnate as human, with a contractual agreement to forget its true soul nature throughout its human life unless it consciously desires to seek the information. 6. Harvest = the process whereby a soul and / or planet “Graduates” from one density to the next. Occurs naturally as a planetary system traverses through different areas of energy density in the galaxy, thus creating dimensional shifts. These shifts occur in precise, measurable cycles of time. Earth is very soon to make such a shift, and the scientific proof for this is featured in Wilcock’s work. 7. Distortion = anything that may erroneously be seen as a separate or individual unit, (since all is One,) including all philosophical ideas, teachings and concepts related to the Oneness as well as such things as the nature of light in the different densities, since there is only One Light that has “distorted” itself into an Octave. The frequent use of the word “distortion” has been a stumbling block for many readers of Ra, as it can apply to almost anything and is usually not considered to be a negative term. At times Ra refers to their own teachings being distortions, as they themselves have not fully penetrated the Octave and returned to Oneness. THE BEGINNING AND ENDING STATEMENTS At the beginning of each session, Ra normally begins as follows: RA: I am Ra. I greet you in the light and love of the One Infinite Creator. We communicate now. At the end of each session, Ra normally closes as follows: Ra: I am Ra. I leave you in the light and love Of the One Infinite Creator, Go forth, therefore, rejoicing in the power and peace of the One Infinite Creator. Adonai. NOTE: With the exception of a few stray instances in one session where Dr. Elkins was asking questions that Ra strongly did not approve of, Ra always prefaces any new statement that they make with the words “I am Ra.” The reader should know that Ra prefaced every quote cited in this book with this, and that the statement was not included in this text in order to enhance readability. Therefore when the reader sees “RA:” in the text it is understood that the statement began with “I am Ra” in the source document. ADDITIONAL NOTE: Again, in order to enhance readability for larger numbers of souls, certain minor changes in the syntax of Ra’s statements have been made. Every effort was made to ensure that these changes did not alter the core message in any way. In order to be sure that you are quoting the source verbatim, please refer to the original texts, available through L/L Research Group at www.llresearch.org ."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"If you quote from this document without referencing the source books, please make note of that to avoid distortions. 1. INTRODUCTION TO RA MATERIAL I. FIRST STATEMENT RA: I am Ra. I have not spoken through this instrument before. We had to wait until she was precisely tuned, as we send a narrow-band vibration. We greet you in the light and love of our Infinite Creator. We have been called to your group because you have a need for a more advanced approach to what you call, seeking the truth. We hope to offer you a somewhat different slant upon the information which is always and ever the same. (B1, 65) II. WHO IS RA? RA: W e are those who are of the Law of One, of Unity. In our vibration the polarities are harmonized; the paradoxes have a solution. W e are one. W e have walked your planet and seen the faces of your peoples. We now feel a great responsibility of helping remove certain distortions that have been given to the law of One. (B1, 65) We, as social memory complex or group soul, made contact with a race on your planet which you call Egyptians. We spoke to one who heard and understood, and was in a position to decree the law of One. (Based on the Edgar Cayce Readings, we can see that this was the entity Ra-Ta, who helped Ra design the Great Pyramid with Hermes and much later reincarnated as Cayce himself). However the priests and the peoples of that era quickly distorted our message, robbing it of the compassion with which unity is informed. (B1, 66) III. RA STILL SEEKS TO BECOME ALL THERE IS RA: We still seek to become all that there is, and still we are Ra. Thus our paths go forward. (B1, 78) IV. IS RA ONE OF MANY ? QUESTION: When I am communicating with you as Ra, are you at times individualized as an entity or am I speaking to an entire social memory complex? RA: You speak with Ra. There is no separation. You would call it a social memory complex thus indicating many-ness. To our understanding, you are speaking to an individualized portion of consciousness (B1, 162) [NOTE: In other words, Ra represents an entire planet worth of beings who have all fused into one unified consciousness. Each density in the Octave moves closer and closer to the fully unified One Mind of the Creation, the structures and abilities of mind becoming increasingly difficult for the human entity to fathom.] 2. THE HISTORY OF RA I. IN 3RD DENSITY RA WAS HELPED BY 6TH DENSITY ENTITIES "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"RA: We were aided by 6th density entities during our own 3rd density experiences. Being extremely less warlike than humans we found this teaching to be of help. We had not developed the interrelationships of your money system and power. We were a more philosophical 3rd density planet than your own and our choices of polarity were much more centered about understanding sexual energy transfers and the appropriate relationships between self and other-self. (B3, 66) QUESTION: What civilization was it that helped Ra in 3rd density, using the pyramid shape? RA: Your people have a fondness for the naming. These entities have begun their travel back to the Creator and are no longer experiencing time. (B3, 71) II RA WAS TOO COMPASSIONATE IN 4TH DENSITY RA: As a group soul in 4th density, we had the tendency towards compassion even to martyrdom in aid of other selves. When the 5th density harvest was achieved, we found that in this vibratory level flaws could be seen in the usefulness of such unrelieved compassion. We spent much time in contemplation of those ways of the Creator which fill love with wisdom. (B2, 95) III. RA MADE CONTACT WITH EARTH PEOPLES A. RA WAS AT THE 6TH DIMENSION WHEN EARTH WAS VISITED RA: I am part of the social memory complex that voyaged outward from a planet in your solar system, the one you call Venus. We are a race old in your measures. When we were at the 6th dimension our physical beings were what you call golden. We were tall and somewhat delicate. The covering of our physical body complex had a golden luster. In this form we decided to come among your peoples. Your peoples were much unlike us in physical appearance. Thus we did not mix well with the population and were obviously other than they. Our visit was relatively short. This was when we built the pyramids. (B1, 90) When we chose this mission among your peoples, we would have been perceived as light had we arrived on earth in our natural form. (B1, 103) B. HOW DID YOU JOURNEY FROM VENUS TO EARTH? We used thought. (B1, 90) C. DID YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR DIMENSION TO BE ON EARTH? From the 6th dimension we are capable of manipulating energy with thought which is the intelligent infinity present in each particle of light, or distorted light, so that we were able to clothe ourselves in a replica of our 6th density mind/body/spirit complexes which were visible in the third density. We were allowed this experiment by the council that guards this planet. (B1, 91) D. WHERE IS THIS COUNCIL LOCATED? RA: This Council is located in the 8th dimension of the planet Saturn, taking place, in 3rd dimensional terms, in the rings of Saturn. (B1, 91) E. THEIR GIFTS WERE MISUSED RA: We are those of the Confederation who, eleven thousand years ago, came to two of your planetary cultures which at that time were closely in touch with the Creation of the One Creator, It was our naive belief that we could teach by direct contact. These cultures were already closely aligned with an all-embracing belief in the live-ness or consciousness of all. We came and were welcomed by the peoples we wished to serve. We attempted to aid them in technical ways having to do with healing of mind/body/spirit complex through the use of the crystal. Thus were the pyramids created. However, it turned out that those in power reserved this technology for themselves. This was not intended by the law of the One. We left your peoples. However we have never left your vibration due to our responsibility for the changes in consciousness we had first caused and then found distorted in ways not relegated to the Law Of One."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"We attempted to contact (mentally) the rulers of this land (Egypt). In the 18th dynasty we were able to contact a pharaoh, Aten or Ikhnaton. He was a wanderer. This entity became convinced that the vibration of One was the true spiritual vibration and thus decreed the law of One. But his beliefs were accepted by few. When he fell, the polarized beliefs in many gods came into their own. (B1, 70-71) RA: We came to your peoples to give the law of One. We wished to impress upon those who wished to learn of unity that in unity all paradoxes are resolved; all that is broken is healed: all that is forgotten is brought to light. (Fk,142) F. THE TIMES WHEN RA HAS MADE CONTACT WITH EARTH RA: The 1st attempt to aid your peoples occurred about 75,000 years ago. [Helped Martians come to Earth]. Next help was given to those of Mu about 58,000 years ago. Next, help was offered to Atlantis about 13,000 years ago. The next attempt was to help the Egyptians [and to some in South America] about 11,000 years ago. About 3500 years later [7500 years ago] help was offered again to some in South America. There were a few attempts to aid those in Egypt about 2300 years ago by others in the Confederation. The remaining part of this cycle we have never gone from your 5th dimension and have been working to prepare for the harvest. (B1, 135-136) F. COULD PEOPLE HAVE LIVED ON VENUS THEN? RA: The 3 rd density conditions are not hospitable to the life-forms of your peoples. But the 5 th and 6th dimensions of that planetary sphere are quite conducive to growing / learning. (B1, 90) RA: The beings inhabiting Venus at this time are 5th density entities. (It,124) G. RA STILL OFFERS ILLUMINATION Near the end of Book 3 the questioner asks if enough material has been covered by that point to, if published, make the necessary reparations for the earlier naive actions of Ra. RA: We mean no disrespect for your service but we do not expect to make full reparations for these distortions. The nature of your language is such that what is distorted cannot, to our knowledge, be fully undistorted but only illuminated somewhat. (B3, 162) V. THE CYCLES RA HAS COMPLETED RA: The path of our learning is graven in the present moment. There is no history as you understand the concept. Picture a circle of being. We know the alpha and omega as infinite intelligence. The circle never ceases. It is present. The densities or cycles we have traversed are: 1. 1ST DENSITY: The cycle of awareness  2. 2ND DENSITY: Growth 3. 3RD DENSITY: Self-awareness  4. 4TH DENSITY: Love or understanding 5. 5TH DENSITY: Light or wisdom RA: We spent much time/space in 5th density balancing the intense compassion we had gained in 4th density, (B2, 93)  6. 6TH DENSITY: Light/love, love/light or unity  (also frequently referred to as compassionate wisdom )  7. 7TH DENSITY: The gateway cycle  (also frequently referred to as that density where one perceives the sacramental nature of all things )"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"RA: At the 7th level or dimension, we shall. if our humble efforts are sufficient, become one with all, thus having no memory, no identity, no past or future, but existing in the all. (B1,153) 8.8TH DENSITY: The octave which moves into a mystery we do not plumb. (B1, 153) QUESTION: Does this mean that in the 8th density you would have awareness of all that is? RA: This is partially correct. It is our understanding that it would not be our awareness, but the awareness of the Creator. In the Creator is all there is. (B1, 153)   3. HOW WERE THE PYRAMIDS BUILT?  I. THEY WERE BUILT BY THE FORCE OF ONE RA: The larger pyramids were built by our ability using the forces of One. THE STONES ARE ALIVE. THIS HAS NOT BEEN UNDERSTOOD BY YOUR CULTURE. (B1, 72-73) [Note: Ra refers to the fact that the stones exist in the first density of consciousness, the density of awareness. The first, second and third densities of conscious lifeforms are all visible to third-dimensional beings such as ourselves.] II. HOW WERE THE BLOCKS MAKING UP THE PYRAMIDS MOVED ? RA: Imagine the activity within all that is created. The energy, though finite, is quite large. This energy is intelligent. It is hierarchical. Just as you have a hierarchy of vehicles, or bodies, so does each atom of such a material as rock. When one can speak to that intelligence, the finite, physical energy of the physical rock body is put into contact with that infinite energy which is resident in the more well-tuned higher bodies, be they rock or human. With this connection made a request may be given. The intelligence of infinite rock-ness communicates to its physical vehicle or body, and that splitting and moving which is desired is then carried out. (B1, 77) III. WAS THIS WAS DONE MENTALLY BY ONE INDIVIDUAL ? RA: There is a distinction between individual power through the Law of One and the power available through the combined understanding of the Law of One by a group soul. One individual, purified of all flaws, could indeed move a mountain. However, in the case of mass understanding of unity, each individual may contain an acceptable amount of distortion and yet the mass mind could move mountains. (B1, 78) There are those among your people at this time whose purity is already one with intelligent infinity. (B1, 82) IV. WHY NOT CREATE IT AS A WHOLE INSTEAD OF WITH BLOCKS? We did not want to be worshipped as builders of a miraculous pyramid. Thus it appears to be made, not thought. (B1, 79) V. RESURRECTION DUE TO INITIATION IN THE QUEEN'S CHAMBER "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"RA: The concept of initiation demands the centering of the being upon the seeking of the Creator. The initiation in the Queen’s chamber involved the abandoning of self to such desire to know the creator in full that the purified in-streaming light is drawn in balanced fashion through all energy centers, or chakras, meeting in the inner eye chakra and opening the gate to intelligent infinity. Then true life is experienced, or, as your people call it, resurrection. (B3, 49) VI. THE USE OF THE RESONATING CHAMBER QUESTION: You said that the resonating chamber was used so the adept could meet the self. Would you explain that? RA: One meets the self in the center or in the deeps of the being. It is analogous to the burial and resurrection of the body wherein the entity dies to self and, through this confrontation of apparent loss and realization of essential gain, is transmuted into a new and risen being. The chamber worked on the mind and the body. The mind was affected by sensory deprivation and the archetypical reactions to being buried alive with no possibility of extricating the self. The body was affected by both the configuration of the mind and by the electrical properties (piezoelectrical) of the materials used. (B3, 112) VI. CAN THE PYRAMID STILL BE USED FOR HEALING AND INITIATION ? RA: It is like a piano out of tune. It plays the tune, but, oh, so poorly. Only the ghost of the streaming still remains. The time of the pyramids is past. (B1, 81-82) WHO ARE WE? 4. THE VARIOUS ORIGINS OF THE 3RD DENSITY BEINGS ON EARTH I. THE FIRST GROUP CAME FROM MARS A. THE MARTIAN PLANET BECAME UNINHABITABLE BEFORE THE COMPLETION OF ITS CYCLE RA: The first entities of 3rd density to come here were brought from Mars. This planet’s environment being inhospitable to 3rd density beings, STATEMENT: I assume you're saying that the guardians transferred the Martian race here after the race had died, in the physical sense, on Mars. RA: This is correct. (B1, 106) RA: The warlike actions of these beings caused such difficulties in the atmospheric environment of their planet that it became unlivable for 3rd density experience before the end of its cycle. Thus the Red Planet entities were unharvested and continued on your planet to attempt to learn the law of one. (B1, 107)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"QUESTION: How long ago was this? RA: About 75,000 years ago. Your planet was not 3rd density in its environment until this time. (B1, 107) B. ONLY 2ND DENSITY ENTITIES WERE ALREADY HERE ON EARTH RA: Those of 2nd density. The second density is the density of the higher plant life and animal life which exists without the upward drive towards the infinite. (B1, 107) QUESTION: Recent research has indicated that the normal sleep cycle for entities on this planet is 25 hours instead of 24 hours. Is this correct, and, if so, why is this? RA: This is correct in some cases. The planetary influences experienced in memory by those from Mars have some effect upon the 3rd density bodily complexes. The Martian race has given its genetic material to many bodies upon your plane. (B3, 100) II. 65 MILLION ARE WANDERERS A. WHO ARE THE WANDERERS? RA: Imagine, if you will, the sands of your shores. As countless as the grains of sand are the sources of intelligent infinity. W hen a social memory complex has achieved a complete understanding of its desire, it may conclude that its desire is to serve any entities who call for aid. These entities whom you may call the Brothers aid Sisters of Sorrow move toward this calling of sorrow. They come from all reaches of the infinite creation. They are not sorrowful themselves, but come to aid those that are in sorrow. They are the Wanderers. There are approximately 65 million on Earth, (B1, 127) B. MOST ARE 6TH DENSITY RA: Few there are of 4th density. Most are of 6th density. The desire to serve must be distorted towards a great deal of purity of mind and what you call foolhardiness or bravery. The challenge and danger to the W anderer is that it will forget its mission, become karmically involved, and thus be swept into the maelstrom and turbulence which it had intended to avert. (B1, 127) C. DO WANDERERS TEND TO BE ILL? QUESTION: Do the Wanderers have physical ailments in this 3rd density situation? RA: Due to the extreme difference between the vibratory distortions of 3rd density and the higher densities, they generally have some kind of handicap or feeling of alienation which is severe, for example, allergies. (B1, 127-128) D. WHY DO THEY INCARNATE IN A DENSITY (THE 3RD) LOWER THAN THEIR OWN? RA: The Wanderer has the potential of greatly accelerating the density of consciousness from whence it comes. This is due to the intensity of life experiences and opportunities in 3rd density. Thus the positively polarized Wanderer chooses to accept the danger of forgetting what it is in order to be of service to others by radiating love of others. If the forgetting is penetrated, the amount of catalyst in 3rd density will polarize the W anderer with much greater efficiency than could be expected in the higher and more harmonious densities. (B2, 67) E. THE FEAR IS THAT THEY WILL NOT AWAKEN Carla Rueckert: “It is no wander that Wanderers have some difficulty waking up within the illusion we call consensus reality. There is always the fear, as one enters incarnation, that one will not awaken at all, but be lost for the whole life experience.” (B5, 58) III. 3RD DENSITY ENTITIES FROM MALDEK INCARNATED ON EARTH AS 2ND DENSITY ENTITIES"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"A. THEY CAME TO EARTH AFTER DESTROYING THEIR OWN PLANET (MALDEK) RA: There are those from Maldek. In your distant past there was a population of 3rd density beings upon a planet which was within your solar system. They had a civilization somewhat similar to Atlantis (B1, 109). After destroying their planet, they came to Earth. It was the only planet in your solar system which was livable and capable of offering the lessons necessary to decrease their distortions with respect to the Law of One. (B1, 91) B. DID ALL THE PEOPLE OF MALDEK HAVE THE FEAR PROBLEM? RA: In the occurrence of planetary dissolution none escaped- (B1, 111-112) C. AT FIRST THEY WERE SO TRAUMATIZED THEY FORGOT THEY WERE CONSCIOUS RA: The war caused the disintegration of the network of biological life, i.e., their biosphere. These entities were so traumatized by this occurrence that they were in what you might call a knot or tangle of fear. No beings could aid them. No one could reach them. Finally about 500,000 or 600,000 years ago the Confederation succeeded in reaching them and untied the knot of fear. The entities were then able to recall that they were conscious. (B1, 110) D. AFTER REGAINING CONSCIOUSNESS. THEY WENT TO THE LOWER ASTRAL PLANES This awareness brought them to what you might call the lower astral planes where they could be nurtured until all were healed of this trauma. Then the group decision was to place upon itself a karmic condition. (B1, 110) E. THEN THEY INCARNATED IN A MORE ANIMAL FORM (NEANDERTHAL) RA: For this purpose they came into incarnation upon your planet in 2nd density forms, i.e., in forms that were not human. They experience this until the distortions of destruction are replaced by distortions toward the desire for a less distorted vision of service to others. (B1, 110) QUESTION: Was the body complex available at that time what we refer to as the ape body? RA: That is correct. (B1, 110) Many have removed the karma and gone onto a 3rd density experience on a 3rd density body. (B1, 111) [Note: Ra goes into detail to explain that this karmic alleviation, not evolution, accounts for the emergence of Neanderthal Man on our planet in the past.] F. HOW DID THEY COME HERE? RA: They came through the process of harvest and were incarnated through the process of incarnation from your higher sphere within this density. (B1, 91) RA: Many incarnated within your Earth's surface instead of upon it. (B1, 92) G. HAS 2ND DENSITY CONSCIOUSNESS FROM ANOTHER PLANET INCARNATED ON EARTH? RA: There are no 2nd density consciousness complexes here on your planet at this time. (B1, 108) H. TWO RACES ARE ON EARTH IN 2ND DENSITY FORM RA: However there are two races which use the 2nd density form. One is from Maldek. They dwell within your deeper underground passageways and are known to you as 'Bigfoot'. They are working on what you would call karmic restitutions. The other race that is here in 2nd density form is one whose body complexes are greatly able to withstand the rigors of nuclear radiation which the body complexes you use would not do - in the event that there is a nuclear war. They dwell in uninhabited deep forest in various places on your planet. They are scarce and very able to escape detection. These entities of the glowing eyes are those most familiar to your peoples. (B1, 108) I. THEN THERE ARE 2 TYPES OF BIGFOOT?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"RA: There are 3 types of Bigfoot, using the same name for 3 different races. The 3rd is a thought-form (B1, 109) J. WHY ARE NO REMAINS OF BIGFOOT FOUND? RA: Exploration of the caves which underlie some of the western coastal mountain regions of your continent will one day offer such remains. (B3, 102) IV. WHAT ARE THE PERCENTAGES ? RA: About 1/2 of the 3rd density entities [on your planet] are from Mars; about 1/4 are from 2nd density of your own planet; the other 1/4 are from elsewhere. (B1, 187) 5. SIMULTANEOUS TIME I. DO WE LIVE MANY LIVES SIMULTANEOUSLY ? QUESTION: The Seth material says that each of us is a part of an Oversoul or Higher Self which has many pans in many dimensions. Does this mean that we have many experiences, or lives, going on simultaneously? (B2, 63) RA: The correctness of the statements is variable. The more in balance an entity becomes, the less the need for parallel experiences. RA: TRUE SIMULTANEITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY W HEN ALL THINGS ARE SEEN TO BE OCCURRING AT ONCE. II. PARALLEL UNIVERSES The concept of various parts of the being living experiences of varying natures simultaneously is not precisely accurate due to your understanding that this would indicate that this was occurring with true simultaneity. This is not the case. The case is, rather, from one universe to another universe. Parallel existences in these different universes can then be programmed by the Higher Self using the information available from the mind/body/spirit complex. (B2, 63) III. IS ALL OF CREATION SIMULTANEOUS ? RA: The nature of true simultaneity is such that, indeed, all is simultaneous. However, in your mode of perception you perhaps would more properly view the seeding of the creation as that of growth from the center or core outward. There is a center to infinity. From this center all spreads. Therefore there are centers to the creation, to the galaxies, to star systems, to planetary systems and to consciousness. (B4, 63) [Note: Taken together, Kimball’s Symmetric Theory and the “Anisotropic Universe” theory both show us that the entire Universe is structured just like a gigantic spiraling galaxy, composed of many smaller galaxies. Wilcock’s Convergence: The Physics of Ascension will go into detail about this once complete. Here we can see Ra already mentioning it in 1981, well before these discoveries were made. Only in the year 2000 were discoveries published that verified that the visible universe is “flat.”] 6. THE HIGHER SELF I. IT KNOWS WHAT LESSONS HAVE NOT BEEN LEARNED PROPERLY QUESTION: What is the Higher Self? RA: The Higher Self as you call it, is the self which exists with full understanding of the accumulation of experiences which have not been learned properly. It aids the entity in achieving healing, and assists in programming further life experiences. (B2, 62)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"RA: The Higher Self may communicate with the entity during the discarnate part of a cycle (in between lives) - or during the incarnation if the proper pathways or channels through the roots of mind are opened. (B2, 65) II. THE MIND/BODY/SPIRIT TOTALITY = PARALLEL COMPONENTS OF AN ENTITY RA: The mind/body/spirit totality is a nebulous or vague collection of all that may occur, all of which is held in the mind's understanding of itself; it is as the shifting sands and is in some part a collection of parallel developments of the same entity. This information is made available to the Higher Self aspect. The Higher Self may then use these projected probability/possibility vortices in order to better aid in what you would call future life programming. (B2, 62 and 65) -NOTE: Seth speaks a lot about these parallel developments of your self in various parallel universes. III. THE HIGHER SELF: YOUR SELF FROM YOUR FUTURE RA: The Higher Self seems to exist simultaneously with the mind/body/spirit complex which it aids. This is not actually simultaneous, for the Higher Self is moving to the mind/body/spirit complex as needed from a position in development of the entity which would be considered in the future of the entity. (B2, 63-64) QUESTION: Then the Higher Self operates from the future as we understand things, and it would know, as far as I am concerned, what was going to happen. Is this correct? (B2, 64) RA: This is incorrect, as it would he a violation of free will. The Higher Self is aware of the lessons learned through 6th density. The choices which must be made to achieve the Higher Self, as it is now, must be made by the mind/spirit/body complex itself. Thus the Higher Self is like a map on which the destination is known and the roads are shown, and the traveler has already reached the destination in some universe, maybe this one. The Higher Self at the destination looks back on the way that has been traveled and assists the traveler in arriving at the goal in an easier way. So the Higher Self can program the entity for certain lessons and predisposing limitations, but the rest is up to the free choice of the entity. (B2, 64) IV. THE HIGHER SELF IS A GIFT FROM THE MID 7TH DENSITY SELF QUESTION: Is the Higher Self of every entity of a 6th density nature? RA: Yes. It is an honor/duty of self to self as one approaches 7th density. (B2, 64-65) QUESTION: Does the Higher Self have some type of vehicle or body? (B2, 64) RA: This is correct. RA: The Higher Self is a manifestation given to the late 6th density entity as a gift from its future selfness. The mid 7th density's last action before turning towards the allness of the Creator and gaining spiritual mass is to give the resource of the Higher Self to the 6th density self. This 6th density self offers its living bank of memory of experience to the Higher Self. Knowing this, you may see your self, your Higher self, and your mind/body/spirit totality as one. They are the same being. (B2, 69) V. TRUE SIMULTANEITY REMOVES ALL SEEMING CONTRADICTIONS RA: The Higher Self protects when possible and guides when asked, but the force of free will is paramount. The seeming contradictions of determinism and free will melt away when it is accepted that there is such a thing as true simultaneity. The Higher Self is the end result of all the development experienced by the mind/body/spirit complex up to that point (i.e., up to the end of 6th density.) (B3, 150)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"VI. THE HIGHER SELF IS ALSO CALLED THE MAGICAL PERSONALITY RA: When the magical personality is properly invoked the self has invoked its Higher Self. Thus a bridge between space/time and time/space is made and the 6th density magical personality experiences directly the 3rd density catalyst for the duration of the working. It is most central to deliberately take off the magical personality after the working in order that the Higher Self may resume its appropriate function as your Higher Self operating in many realms, not just in the 3rd density. (B3, 192) QUESTION: The 3 aspects of the magical personality are stated to be power, love and wisdom. Are these its only primary aspects? (B3, 192) RA: The magical personality is a being of unity, a being of 6th density, and the equivalent of what you call your Higher Self and at the same time is a personality enormously rich in variety of experience and subtlety of emotion. (B3, 192) THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS: SETTING UP THE GAME 7. THE BEGINNING OF ALL THINGS I. THE INFINITE ONE = THE SOURCE = INTELLIGENT INFINITY A. THE INFINITE ONE IS UNFOCUSED AND UNDIFFERENTIATED QUESTION: Can you tell me the first known thing in creation? RA: The first known thing in creation is infinity. (B1, 129) B. AWARENESS DAWNS QUESTION: What is the next step? RA: Infinity became aware. (B1, 129) II. FROM THE INFINITE ONE DESIRING TO EXPERIENCE ITSELF ARISES THE CREATOR A. THE CREATOR CREATES (OUTER) SPACE RA: As the Creator decides to experience Itself It generates into that plenum (nothingness that has the potential for being) full of the glory and the power of the One Infinite Creator which is manifest to your perceptions as space or outer space. (B4, 65) B. THE CREATOR DIVIDES INTO (OR CREATES) INDIVIDUALIZED PORTIONS OF ITSELF RA: Step by step, the Creator becomes that which may know (or experience) Itself, and the portions of the Creator partake less purely in the power of the original word or thought. The creation itself is a form of consciousness which is unified. THE CREATOR DOES NOT PROPERLY CREATE AS MUCH AS IT EXPERIENCES ITSELF. (B1, 65) III. THE CREATOR = THE FOCUSING OF INTELLIGENT INFINITY INTO INTELLIGENT ENERGY RA: Awareness led to the focus of infinity into infinite energy. You have called this by various names, the most common being ‘logos' or ‘love' [But love is actually the 2nd distortion]. (B1, 129) RA: The Creator is the focusing of infinity as an aware conscious principle called intelligent infinity. (B1, 129) (NOTE: When infinity focuses itself, then creation occurs.)"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"RA: Love may be seen as the type of energy of an extremely high order which causes intelligent energy to be formed from the potential of intelligent infinity in a particular way. All love emanates from the Oneness. (B2, 8) IV. INTELLIGENT INFINITY AND INTELLIGENT ENERGY  RA: There is unity. This unity is all there is. This unity has a potential and a kinetic. The potential is intelligent infinity, Tapping this potential will yield work [or the kinetic part.] This work [or kinetic part] has been called by us, intelligent energy. [Yet] there is no difference, potential or kinetic, in unity. The basic rhythms of intelligent infinity are totally without distortion of any kind. The rhythms are clothed in mystery, for they are being itself. Its unity is undistorted. However, there is a vast potential to be tapped into by focuses of energy, which we call intelligent energy, (So, in a certain sense It does have a potential - as seen from that which taps into It, but not as seen from that which It is.) (B2, 7) - (Recall Tillich's ground of being). V. THE GREAT CENTRAL SUN AND THE RHYTHM OF INTELLIGENT INFINITY RA: Intelligent infinity has a rhythm or flow as of a giant heart beginning with the central sun as you would conceive of this, the presence of the flow inevitable as a tide of beingness without polarity, without finiteness, the vast and silent all beating outward, outward and inward until all the focuses are complete. Then their spiritual nature or mass calls them inward, inward until all is coalesced. This is the rhythm of reality. (B2, 6) 8. THE TOOLS OF REASON = 3 BASIC DISTORTIONS OF THE ONE THE 1ST DISTORTION = FREE W ILL QUESTION: The 1st distortion of intelligent infinity is free will. Can you give a definition of this distortion? RA: In this distortion of the Law of One it is recognized that the Creator will know Itself (or experience Itself). (B2, 7) The primal distortion is free will. (B2, 8) QUESTION: The Creator then grants total freedom of choice in the ways of knowing. Is this correct? (B2, 7) RA: This is quite correct. (B2, 7) QUESTION: Then all other distortions spring from this first distortion, is this correct? RA: It is both correct and incorrect. In your illusion of physical existence all experience springs from the Law of Free will or the Way of Confusion. In another sense, which we are learning, the experiences are this distortion. (B2, 7) II. THE 2ND DISTORTION = LOVE A. THE FOCUSING OF FREE WILL YIELDS LOVE RA: The 1st distortion, free will, finds a focus which is known to you as logos, the Creative Principle or love. This focus may be called the 2nd distortion. (B1, 148) RA: The second distortion is the distortion of love. (B2, 7-8) B. LOVE SEEKS TO KNOW ITSELF RA: The distortion love is the great activator and primal co-Creator of various creations using intelligent infinity. (B2, 8)... Love uses Its intelligent energy to create a certain"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"pattern of illusions or densities in order to satisfy Its own intelligent estimate of a method of knowing itself. (B2, 9) III. THE 3RD DISTORTION = LIGHT (NOTE: Light, or light energy, is transformative: it may, or may not, be connected to love) RA: This intelligent energy thus creates a distortion known as Light. From these 3 distortions come many, many hierarchies of distortions each having its own paradoxes to be synthesized, no one being any more important than another. (B1, 148) RA: The origin of all energy is the action of free will upon love. The nature of all energy is light, including the inner light which is the guiding star of the self. This is the true nature of all entities. (B3, 30) RA: THE INNER LIGHT IS YOUR HEART OF BEING. ITS STRENGTH EQUALS YOUR STRENGTH OF W ILL TO SEEK THE LIGHT. (B3, 46) RA: A certain amount of awareness of the inner light is necessary to attract the in-streaming light upward spiraling from the south magnetic pole of being (the toot chakra), (B3, 46) 9. THE CREATION A. THE CREATOR EXPLORES THE CONCEPT OF MANYNESS (INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES) RA: That which is infinite cannot be many, far many-ness is a finite concept. In an infinite Creator there is only unity, (B1, 66-67) RA: Intelligent infinity discerned a concept, namely, freedom of will of awareness. This concept was finiteness. This is the first and primal paradox or distortion of the Law of One. Thus the one intelligent infinity invested itself in an exploration of many-ness. Due to the infinite possibilities of intelligent infinity (or the Oneness), there is no ending to many- ness. The exploration thus is free to continue infinitely into an eternal present. (B1, 130-131) RA: EACH ENTITY (MIND/BODY/SPIRIT COMPLEX) IS A UNIQUE PORTION OF THE ONE CREATOR. (B2, 22) II. THE CREATION HAS AN INFINITE NUMBER OF DIMENSIONS WITHIN THE OCTAVE FORMAT RA: The next sep is an infinite reaction to the creative principle (intelligent energy) following the Law of One in one of its basic distortions, namely, freedom of will. Thus many, many dimensions, infinite in number, are possible. The energy moves from the intelligent infinity due first to the outpouring of randomized creative force which then creates patterns. These patterns of energy begin to regularize their own rhythms and fields of energy, thus creating dimensions and universes. At this point the physical universes were not yet born. The steps are simultaneous and infinite. (B1, 129-130) RA: The universe is infinite. This has yet to be proven or disproven, but we can assure you that there is no end to your selves, of your journey of seeking or your perceptions of the creations. (B1, 66) III. AN INDIVIDUALIZED PORTION OF GOD CREATED OUR GALAXY (BILLIONS OF STARS) QUESTION: Was our galaxy created by intelligent infinity or by a portion of it? RA: The galaxy and all other material things are products of individualized portions of intelligent infinity. As each exploration began, an individualized portion of the One would, in its turn, find its focus and become co-creator. Using intelligent infinity each portion created a universe. Allowing the rhythm of free choice to flow and playing with the infinite spectrum of possibilities, each"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"individualized portion channeled love/light into intelligent energy, thus creating the so-called Natural Laws of any particular universe. Each has its own local version of illusory Natural Laws. IT SHALL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT ANY PORTION, NO MATTER HOW SMALL, OF ANY DENSITY OR OF ANY ILLUSORY PATTERN CONTAINS, AS IN A HOLOGRAPHIC PICTURE, THE ONE CREATOR WHICH IS INFINITY. THUS ALL BEGINS AND ENDS IN MYSTERY. (B1, 131) RA: The white light which emanates and forms the articulated sub-logos has its beginning in what may be metaphysically seen as darkness. The light comes into that darkness and transfigures it, causing the chaos to organize and become reflective or radiant. Thus the dimensions come into being. (B2, 78-79) QUESTION: Considering only our Milky Way Galaxy at its beginnings, I will assume that the first occurrence that we could see with our telescopes was the appearance of a star of the nature of our sun. Is this correct? (B4, 64) RA: The first manifestation of the Creator or logos in creating a galaxy is the appearance of a cluster of outward swirling energies that produce new energy centers for the Logos. These energy centers are called stars. The closer to the, shall we say, beginning of the manifestation of the logos the star is, the more it partakes in the one original thought. (B4, 64) IV. THE LOGOS FOR OUR GALAXY CREATED THE SUN BEFORE THE PLANETS RA: The co-creator, individualizing the galaxy, created energy patterns which focused in many centers of conscious awareness of intelligent infinity. The progression is from the galaxy spiraling energy to the solar spiraling energy to the planetary spiraling energy to the spiraling energy which started the 1st density of awareness in planetary entities. (B1, 131-132) [Note that all the stable basic particles (electron, proton, and neutron - and also quarks) cannot exist without spinning (spiraling). In Convergence: The Physics of Ascension Wilcock discusses how this spiraling, expanding growth principle applies to all levels of order in the universe, from the micro to the macro, and how they are all perfectly harmonically partitioned from each other by a factor of 34560 (see the work of Ray Tomes.) Although Ra does not directly indicate that this partitioning is harmonic in the above quote, it can be inferred from context; so again, in 1981 Ra was well ahead of the times.] V. THE CREATION OF BEINGS' AWARENESS IS FOCUSED INTO INDIVIDUAL CONSCIOUSNESS A. 1ST DENSITY ENTITIES APPEAR ON EARTH RA: EACH STEP PLAYS OUT AGAIN THE DISCOVERY OF AW ARENESS BY INTELLIGENT INFINITY. IN A PLANETARY ENVIRONMENT ALL BEGINS IN W HAT YOU W OULD CALL CHAOS, ENERGY UNDIRECTED AND RANDOM. SLOW LY THERE FORMS A FOCUS OF SELF-AW ARENESS. THUS THE LOGOS MOVES. LIGHT COMES TO FORM THE DARKNESS, according to the creator's patterns and vibratory rhythms. This begins with the 1st density which is the density of consciousness, the mineral and water life upon the planet learning from fire and wind the awareness of being. This is the 1st density. (B1, 132) B. THE EVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGH THE DENSITIES (1) 2ND DENSITY ENTITIES EVOLVE FROM 1ST DENSITY RA: On the planet second density beings begin to move about within and upon its being."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"(B1, 132) (2) 3RD DENSITY ENTITIES EVOLVE FROM 2ND DENSITY RA: The 2nd density strives towards the 3rd density which is the density of self-- consciousness or self-awareness. (B1, 133) 10. THE LAW OF ONE RA: THE LAW OF ONE SIMPLY STATES THAT ALL THINGS ARE ONE, THAT ALL BEINGS ARE ONE. (B1, 92) I. THERE IS NO REAL (OR ETERNAL) POLARITY RA: In truth there is no right or wrong. There is no polarity for all will be reconciled at some point in your dance through the mind/body/spirit complex with which you amuse yourself. This belief in polarity is chosen instead of understanding the complete unity of thought that binds all things together. You are every thing, every being, every emotion, every situation. You are unity. You are infinity. You are love/light, light/love. You are. This is the Law of One. (B1, 67) The Law of One, although beyond all words, may be approximated by saying that all things are one, there is no polarity, no right or wrong, no disharmony, but only one identity. All is one; and that one is love/light, light/love, the Infinite Creator. (B1, 85) THE LAW OF ONE SAYS THAT ALL THINGS ARE ONE CREATOR. THUS SEEKING THE CREATOR IS DONE NOT JUST IN MEDITATION AND IN THE W ORK OF THE ADEPT, BUT IN THE EXPERIENCE OF EVERY MOMENT. (B3, 49) IN EACH INFINITESIMAL PART OF YOURSELF RESIDES THE ONE IN ALL OF ITS POW ER. (B1, 146) RA: The unity of the Creator exists, not only in a self-aware being, but within the smallest portion of any material created by Love. (B2, 111) RA: Each mind/body/spirit complex is a unique portion of the One Creator. (B2, 22) JIM MCCARTY: “All events are illusions or mysteries because each represents the One Creator in one disguise or another, offering us a greater or lesser opportunity to find love, joy, balance and perfection in each moment.” (B5, 56) II. THE PROGRESSION THROUGH DENSITIES OCCURS IN ALL GALAXIES QUESTION: Is the progression of life in other galaxies similar to ours? (B1, 156) RA: The progression is close to being the same, with only minor variations. QUESTION: Then the Law of One is truly universal in creating a progression towards the 8th density in all galaxies. Is this correct? (B1, 156) RA: This is correct. RA: This octave of Infinite knowledge of the One Infinite Creator is as it is throughout the One Infinite Creation, with variations programmed by sub-logoi of what you call major galaxies and minor galaxies. These variations are not significant but may be compared to various regions in which different pronunciations of the same sound vibration are used. (B3, 159) 11. AN EXTENSION OF THE 1ST DISTORTION:"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE VEIL OF FORGETFULNESS AND THE WAY OF CONFUSION I. THE VEIL OF FORGETFULNESS A. THE VEIL MAKES YOU FORGET YOUR TRUE IDENTITY AND PURPOSE RA: This is the only place of forgetting. It is necessary for the 3rd density entity to forget what it really is so that the mechanisms of confusion or free will may operate upon the newly individuated consciousness complex. (B1, 193) RA: The veiling process is a space/time phenomenon; it is not present in the metaphysical realm (time/space). (B4, 73) RA: Without the veil the mind was not caught in your illusory time. (B4, 94) QUESTION: Why must an entity come into an incarnation and lose conscious memory of what he wants to do? Why can't he accomplish the same thing in between incarnations when the entity is aware of what he wants to do? (B2, 132) RA: W ERE THERE NO POTENTIALS FOR MISUNDERSTANDING..., THERE W OULD BE NO EXPERIENCE. (B3, 24) QUESTION: The first change made for the extension of free will was to make the communication between the conscious mind and unconscious mind relatively unavailable one to the other during the incarnation. Is this correct? (B4, 40) RA: We would perhaps rather term the condition as relatively more mystery-filled than relatively unavailable. (B4, 41) B. THE VEIL SPLITS THE MIND INTO CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS PARTS QUESTION: The idea was then to create some type of veil between the conscious mind and the unconscious mind. Is this correct? (B4, 41) RA: This is correct. QUESTION: It was probably the design of the logos to allow the conscious mind greater freedom under the first distortion by partitioning it from the unconscious mind which had a greater communication with the total mind, therefore allowing for the birth of \"uneducated\" portions of consciousness. Is this correct? (B4, 41) RA: This is roughly correct. (B4, 41) II. THE LAW OF CONFUSION A. RA DOES NOT GIVE INFORMATION THAT WOULD VIOLATE THE LAW OF CONFUSION RA: There is a limit beyond which information (if given by Ra) would be an intrusion upon the law of confusion. (B3, 53) RA: It is not our understanding that we have the right or duty to share our perceptions on any subject except philosophy without direct question. (B1, 73) RA: Unless the question contains the potential for answers which may infringe upon free will, we offer our answers - even if the question is unimportant. (B1, 95) QUESTION: Would it be helpful if Ra were to describe the techniques that Ra used while Ra was in 3rd density to evolve spiritually? (B3, 98) RA: That question lies beyond the Law of Confusion. (B3, 98) B. DOES RA INCORPORATE INCORRECT DATA? QUESTION: If I were in the place of Ra right now, the 1st distortion of the law of One might cause me to mix some incorrect data with the true information I was transmitting to this group. Do you do this? RA: We do not intentionally do this. However there will be some confusion. It is not our intent to create incorrect information, but to express the feeling of the Infinite Mystery of the One Creation in its infinite and intelligent unity.

THE \"EQUAL TIME” RULE: OPPORTUNITY, FOR BOTH POLARIZATIONS, MUST BE BALANCED (1) THE MALDEK EXAMPLE QUESTION: How did the Confederation send this love and light to those of Maldek after they destroyed their planet? RA: There dwell within the Confederation planetary entities who from their planetary spheres do nothing but send love and light as pure streamings to those who call. This is not in the form of conceptual thought but of pure and undifferentiated love. (B1, 195) QUESTION: Did the 1st distortion of the Law Of One require that equal time be given to the self-service group? RA: In this case it was not necessary for a certain time because the orientation of these Maldek entities was such that the aid of the Confederation was not perceived. (B1, 195) QUESTION: Since it was not perceived, it was not necessary to balance this. Is that correct? RA: That is correct. What is necessary to balance is opportunity. When there is ignorance, there is no opportunity. (B1, 195) (2) THE EXAMPLE OF THE CHILDREN WITH A DOUBLE BODY IN ACTIVATION QUESTION: There are many children now who have demonstrated the ability to bend metal mentally which is a 4th density phenomenon. (B3, 91) RA: These entities are those incarnating with a double body in activation. This transitional body is one which will be able to appreciate 4th density vibratory complexes as the in-streamings increase without the accompanying disruption of the 3rd density body. (B3, 90) QUESTION: Is the reason that they can bend metal with their minds and the 5th density Wanderers who are here cannot the fact that these children have the 4th density body in activation? RA: This is correct. The mind/body/spirit of the Wanderers are activated only to the level of 3rd density and are subject to the forgetting which can only be penetrated with disciplined meditation and working. (B3, 92) QUESTION: These children are not infringing upon the 1st distortion because they are children now and they won't be old enough to really affect people's choice of polarization until the transition to the time of harvest is well advanced. However, the Wanderers who have come here are older and have a greater ability to affect people's polarization. They must do their affecting as a function of their ability to penetrate the forgetting process in order to be within the 1st distortion. Is this correct? (B3, 92) RA: That is quite correct. RA: It would be an infringement of the 1st distortion (free will) if W anderers penetrated the forgetting so far as to activate the more dense higher density bodies and thus be able to live in a god-like manner.

JESUS DID NOT INFRINGE ON FREE WILL"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"QUESTION: What was the orientation of Jesus with respect to this type of communication (the communication style used by evangelists)? (B3, 173) RA: Jesus offered himself as a teacher to those which gathered to hear and even then he spoke as through a veil so as to leave room for those not wishing to hear. (B3, 173) – i.e., in parables II. WHY DIDN'T HIS MAGICAL WORKS INFRINGE UPON FREE WILL ? QUESTION: It would seem that seeing the miracles performed by Jesus would abridge free will to some extent in that a seemingly magical occurrence took place as a result of the working of an adept. Could you speak on this paradox that is immediately the problem of anyone doing healing. (B3, 173) RA: We are humble messengers of the law of One. To us there are no paradoxes. The workings which seem magical and therefore seem to interfere upon free will do not, in themselves, do so, for each witness sees what it desires to see. (B3, 173) III. INTERFERENCE WITH FREE WILL OCCURS IF YOU CLAIM THE HEALING IS FROM YOU RA: Interference with free will occurs in magical healing only if the entity doing the working takes credit for the healing itself and claims it is due to its own skills. He who states that no working comes from it, but only through it, is not interfering with free will. (B3, 173) 13. THE MYSTERY OF INFINITY I. GRASP INFINITY THROUGH MYSTERY RA: The mystery and unknown quality of the occurrences we are allowed to offer have the hoped for intention of thinking your peoples grasp infinity, and then and only then, can the gateway be opened to the Law of One. (B1, 99) RA: The entity which reaches intelligent infinity most often will perceive this experience as one of unspeakable profundity. It is not unusual for the entity to immediately desire the cessation of the incarnation. However, the desire to communicate or use this experience to aid others is extremely strong (B2, 51) II. CLOUDED IN MYSTERY QUESTION: The concept of intelligent infinity is that it expands outward from all locations everywhere. It expands outward uniformly from every point everywhere at the velocity of light. Is this correct? RA: This concept is incorrect as is any concept of intelligent infinity. Yet the concept is correct in the context of one particular Logos , or Love, or focus of this Creator. The one undifferentiated intelligent infinity, unpolarized, full and whole, is the macrocosm of the mystery-clad being. (B2, 10-11) [Note: Dr. Elkins’ question is building off of the physics concepts of Dewey Larson. Ra’s answer implies that the physics laws in this particular galaxy may not be the same as in other galaxies, since the galaxy/Logos itself creates the framework for the Octave of densities in its own unique way.] DIFFERENT STRUCTURES 14. THE ARCHITECTURE AND NATURE OF THE DENSITIES [NOTE: Some quotes will be repeated in this section for further clarity.]"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"I. HARMONIC STRUCTURE OF DIMENSIONS RA: All the octave of your densities would be clearly visible were not the fourth through the seventh freely choosing not to be visible. (B1, 133) [Note: The first two densities are of elemental/mineral life (1 st ) and plant/animal life (2 nd .)] A. ORIGIN OF ALL DENSITIES RA: The first known thing in the creation is infinity. The infinity is creation... Infinity became aware. This was the next step... (Then,) awareness led to the focus of infinity into infinite energy. You have called this by various vibrational sound complexes, the most common to your ears being “Logos” or “Love.” (B1, 129) [Note: We now can define this energy, which Ra later refers to as “intelligent infinity,” using scientific methods. Physicists have discovered a multi-dimensional “zero-point energy” that exists outside of the scope of physical matter as we now understand it. Ra explains to us that the density or vibrational level of the zero-point energy is the most important factor in understanding the structure of the dimensions.] RA: The next step is still at this space/time nexus in your illusion achieving its progression as you may see it in your illusion... The energy moves from the intelligent infinity due first to the outpouring of randomized creative force, this then creating patterns which in holographic style appear as the entire creation no matter which direction or energy is explored. (B1, 129) [Note: This is also a fundamental principle behind fractals; namely, self-similarity on all levels. See Convergence III for more details.] RA: These patterns of energy begin then to regularize their own local, shall we say, rhythms and fields of energy, thus creating dimensions and universes. (B1, 130) B. DEFINITION OF “DENSITY:” SIMILAR TO SOUND AND LIGHT VIBRATION RA: The term density is a, what you call, mathematical one. The closest analogy is that of music, whereby after seven notes on your western type of scale, if you will, the eighth note begins a new octave. Within your great octave of experience which we share with you, there are seven octaves or densities. Within each density there are seven sub-densities. Within each sub-density, there are seven sub-sub- densities. Within each sub-sub-density, seven sub-sub-sub-densities and so on infinitely. (B1, 157-158) [Note: Even though this material came several years before the widespread knowledge of chaos theory and fractals, what Ra is describing is precisely a fractal-based, harmonic universe.] RA: The nature of vibration is such that it may be seen as having mathematically straight or narrow steps. These steps may be seen as having boundaries. Within each boundary there are infinite gradations of vibration or color. However, as one approaches a boundary, an effort must be made to cross that boundary."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"These colors are a simplistic way of expressing the boundary divisions of your density. There is also the time/space analogy which may be seen as the color itself in a modified aspect. (B2, 42) [Note: In the Convergence series, Wilcock explains how geometry is the third major component of this Octave dimensional vibration of intelligent energy – and Ra discusses this as well.] C. SPIRALING ENERGY (LIGHT) FORMS THE DENSITIES RA: In a planetary environment all begins in what you would call chaos, energy undirected and random in its infinity. Slowly, in your terms of understanding, there forms a focus of self-awareness... Light comes to form the darkness, according to the co-Creator’s patterns and vibratory rhythms, so constructing a certain type of experience. This begins with first density which is the density of consciousness, the mineral and water life upon the planet learning from fire and wind the awareness of being. This is the first density. QUESTIONER: How does this first density then progress to greater awareness? RA: The spiraling energy, which is the characteristic of what you call “light,” moves in a straight-line spiral thus giving spirals an inevitable vector upwards to a more comprehensive beingness with regard to intelligent infinity. (B1, 132) QUESTIONER: When the Earth was second-density, how did the second-density beings on it become so invested (with third-density consciousness?) RA: There was... the simple third-density investment (or increase of awareness) which is the line of spiraling light calling distortion upward from density to density. (B1, 135) RA: The energies moved in increasingly intelligent patterns until the individualization of various energies emanating from the creative principle of intelligent infinity became such as to be co-Creators. Thus the so- called physical matter began. The concept of light is instrumental in grasping this great leap of thought as this vibrational distortion of infinity is the building block of that which is known as matter, the light being intelligent and full of energy... This light of love was made to have... certain characteristics, among them the infinite whole paradoxically described by the (spiraling) straight line, as you would call it. This paradox is"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"responsible for the shape of the various physical illusion entities you call solar systems, galaxies, and planets of revolving and tending towards the lenticular (disk-shaped.) (B1, 130) [Note: What Ra is telling us here is that light forms all matter, and that once emitted, it moves in a straight-line spiral in all directions. This would naturally form a spherical field, as explained below. Although the discoveries had not yet come out at the time that this material was brought through, scientists now acknowledge that our Galaxy must be surrounded by a sphere of “dark matter.” (See Convergence III .)] D. THE SPIRALING ENERGY MOVES OUTWARD IN A SPHERE SHAPE QUESTIONER: The concept that I have right now of the process, using both what you have told me and some of Dewey Larson’s material having to do with the physics of the process, is that intelligent infinity expands outwards from all locations everywhere. It expands outward uniformly like the surface of a bubble or a balloon... It expands outward at what is called unit velocity or the velocity of light... RA: This concept is incorrect as is any concept of the one intelligent infinity. This concept is correct in the context of one particular Logos, or Love, or focus of this Creator which has chosen Its, shall we say, natural laws and ways of expressing them mathematically and otherwise. (B2, 10- 11) [Note: It appears now that Ra’s reticence to answer this question fully in the positive is at least partially due to the fact that the speed of light is different for each density, being another representation of frequency.] E. SPIRALING LIGHT ENERGIES IN AN EXPANDING SPHERE FORM SPECIFIC GEOMETRIES FOR EACH DIMENSION [Note: Again, this is an area where further research was needed to flesh out the cosmological design that Ra was setting forth. As explained in Convergence, researchers such as Dr. Hans Jenny have proven that sphere-based Platonic Solid geometries emerge within a vibrating fluid, their edges or nodes formed by visible spiraling lines. One example of this is as follows: "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"What we see in fluid vibrations holds true for density vibrations as well. Thus, each density has a specific geometry. The ancient Vedic Hindu cosmology clearly defined these geometries for each density, most likely from an Atlantean inheritance of Ra’s teachings.] [Note: What we do have from Ra is a clear description of these energy forms, representing the dimensions, emerging on the Earth as well as within the human energy field. Ra makes us see that the importance of these energy forms is in the fact that energy is continually streaming into and back out of them, especially at their corners or node points, which Ra often refers to as “nexi.”] RA: Imagine, if you will, the many force fields of the Earth in their geometrically precise web. Energies stream into the Earth planes, as you would call them, from magnetically determined points. Due to growing thought-form distortions in understanding of the Law of One, the planet itself was seen to have the potential for imbalance. The balancing pyramidal structures (built by the Confederation) were charged with crystals which drew the appropriate balance from the ENERGY FORCES STREAMING INTO THE VARIOUS GEOMETRICAL CENTERS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY W HICH SURROUND AND SHAPE THE PLANETARY SPHERE. [Note: When the Global Grid is properly mapped, as in the Becker-Hagens map featured in chapter 18 of Convergence II , it is indeed easy to see how the Grid shapes our planetary landmasses. And of course, the sites of ancient pyramids fit perfectly over these grid nodes and lines.] RA: Only the ghost of the streaming (energy into the Great Pyramid) still remains due to the shifting of the streaming points which is in turn due to the shifting electromagnetic field of your planet... (B1, 81-82) RA: Love creating light, becoming love/light, streams into the planetary sphere according to the electromagnetic web of points or nexi of entrance. These streamings are then available to the individual who, like the planet, is a web of electromagnetic energy fields with points or nexi of entrance. (B1, 144) RA: The gate to intelligent infinity can only be opened when an understanding of the in-streamings of intelligent energy are opened unto the healer. These are the so-called Natural Laws of your local space/time continuum and its web of electromagnetic sources or nexi of in-streaming energy. (B1, 164) RA: The fourth density is a vibrational spectrum. Your time/space continuum has spiraled your planetary sphere and your, what we would call galaxy, what you call star, into this vibration. This will cause the planetary sphere itself to electromagnetically realign its vortices of reception of the in-streaming of cosmic forces (intelligent energy) expressing themselves as vibrational webs so that the Earth thus be fourth-density magnetized, as you may call it. (B1, 160) RA: IT IS CORRECT THAT THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE ENERGY FIELD OF AN ENTITY OF YOUR NATURE AND PLANETARY BODIES, FOR ALL MATERIAL IS CONSTRUCTED BY MEANS OF THE DYNAMIC TENSION OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD. THE LINES OF FORCE IN BOTH CASES MAY BE SEEN TO BE MUCH LIKE THE INTERWEAVING SPIRALS OF THE BRAIDED HAIR."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THUS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE WIND AND INTERWEAVE FORMING GEOMETRIC RELATIONSHIPS IN THE ENERGY FIELDS OF BOTH PERSONS, AS YOU WOULD CALL A MIND/BODY/SPIRIT COMPLEX, AND PLANETS. (B2, 124) RA: The (positive) adepts then become living channels for love and light and are able to channel this radiance directly into the planetary web of energy nexi. (B2, 131) F. VIBRATIONAL / DENSITY CHANGE QUESTIONER: Speaking of the rapid change that occurred in the physical vehicle from second density (ape beings) to third density (humans:) this occurred, you said, in approximately a generation and a half. Body hair was lost and there were structural changes. I am aware of the physics of Dewey B. Larson, who states that all is motion or vibration. Am I correct in assuming that the basic vibration that makes up the physical world changes, thus creating a different set of parameters, shall I say, in this short period of time between density changes allowing for the new type of being? Am I correct? RA: This is correct. (B1, 184) II. THE 1ST DENSITY = FIRE, AIR, EARTH AND WATER A. THE 1ST DENSITY IS NOT AWARE AND, AT FIRST, IT IS FORMLESS QUESTION: When 1st density is formed we have fire, air, earth and water. At some point there is the first movement of life towards consciousness. Could you describe this? RA: The 1st or red ray density, though attracted towards growth, is not in the proper vibration for those conditions conducive to the spark of awareness. (B2, 87) B. WIND AND FIRE BRING FORM TO EARTH AND WATER QUESTION: Can you tell me how, in the 1st density, wind and fire teach earth and water. (B4, 32) RA: The air and fire of that which is formless literally illuminates and forms the formless, for earth and water were, in the timeless state, unformed. As the active principles of fire and air blow and burn incandescently about that which nurtures that which is to come, the water learns to become sea, lake and river, and the earth learns to be shaped, both offering opportunity for viable life. (B4, 32) III. THE 2ND DENSITY = ANIMALS, PLANTS AND MINERALS A. QUESTION: HOW LONG DID THE 2ND DENSITY LAST ON THIS PLANET? RA: It is your longest density. It lasted approximately 4.6 billion years. (B4, 13) QUESTION: The end of Ra's 3rd density coincided with the beginning of this planet's 2 nd density. Is that correct? (B4, 124) RA: This is roughly correct. QUESTION: Did Venus become a 4th density planet at that time? (B4, 124) RA: This is so. B. WHAT TYPE OF 2ND DENSITY ENTITIES CAN CHANGE TO 3RD DENSITY? QUESTION: Suppose an individual entity of 2nd density is ready for transition to 3rd density. Would this 2nd density entity be an animal? RA: There are 3 types of 2nd density entities which become enspirited (i.e., 3rd density), 1. The most common are animals."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 2. The second most common are trees, 3. The third is mineral. Occasionally a certain location becomes energized to individuality through the love it receives and gives in relationship to a 3rd density entity which is in relationship to it. This is the least common transition. (B4, 177) C. QUESTION: HOW DO 2ND DENSITY ENTITIES BECOME ENSPIRITED? RA: Entities do not become enspirited. They become aware of the intelligent energy within each portion, cell, or atom of its beingness. The self-awareness comes from within even the catalyst of certain experiences. There is an inevitable pull toward eventual realization of self. (B1, 177) D. WHY DID THE LOGOS USE TWO-LEGGED ERECT FORMS EVOLVE INTO 3RD DENSITY? RA: We are not entirely sure why our logos and several neighboring logoi chose the bipedal, erect form of the 2nd density apes to invest with higher consciousness. It has been our assumption that our logos was interested in further intensifying the veiling process by making it almost certain that speech would take precedence over telepathy. The tool making abilities of the ape form lessoned the probability of rediscovering the powers of the mind. (B4, 138) E. 3RD DENSITY BEINGS CAN BRING SELF-AWARENESS TO THEIR PETS RA: Much as you would put on a vestment, so do your 3rd density beings invest or clothe some 2nd density beings with self-awareness. This often occurs when you have pets. It has also been done by various other means of investiture. These include many so-called religious practices which personify and send love to various natural 2nd density beings in their group form. (B1, 134) The development of self-awareness also occurs without such investiture because the upward line of spiraling light is always calling one to move upward from one density to another, higher density - but it takes longer when no investiture is made. (B1, 135) F. THOUGHT-FORMS RA: Thought-form entities feed upon fear... Some exist in the astral plane. Others wait within the Earth's surface. It is our impression that this type of information is unimportant. (B2, 101) IV. OVERVIEW OF 3RD THROUGH 7TH DENSITIES RA: The 3rd density being, having the potential for complete self-awareness, thus has the potential for minimum activation of all energy centers. The 4th, 5th, and 6th densities are those refining the higher energy centers. The 7th density is a density of completion and turning towards timelessness or foreverness. (B2, 89) RA: THE INTENSITY OF 4TH DENSITY IS THAT OF THE REFINING OF THE ROUGH-HEW N SCULPTURE. HOW EVER, IN THE 3RD DENSITY THE STATUE IS FORGED IN THE FIRE. This is a type of intensity which is not the property of 4th, 5th, 6th or 7th densities. (B4, 20) RA: In the 4th and 5th densities the positive polarity functions without any need of the negative polarity and vice versa. It is to be noted that in attempting to sway 3rd density entities in choosing polarity there evolves a good bit of interaction between the two polarities. In 6th density, the density of unity, the 2 paths must take in each other. This is not difficult for the positive polarity which sends light/love to all otherselves. For the service-to self polarized entities it is difficult enough that at some point the negative polarity must be abandoned. (B4, 31) V. THE 3RD DENSITY OUTER PLANET ENTITIES= HUMAN BEINGS "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"[Wilcock note: Here, Dr. Childers originally included whales and dolphins as being third-density beings but this idea is not supported by any quote from Ra. It appears from the quote above that our entire galaxy chose the “erect bipedal form with opposable thumbs” as the vehicle for all 3 rd density consciousnesses to use.] A. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE 3RD DENSITY? RA: The purpose of incarnation in 3rd density is to learn the ways of love. (B4, 67) B. HOW LONG DOES 3RD DENSITY LAST? QUESTION: The 3rd density is, comparatively speaking, the twinkling of an eye, the snap of a finger in time compared to the others. Why is it so short compared to 1st and 2nd density? RA: The 3rd density is a choice. The prelude to choice must encompass the laying of the foundation, the establishment of the illusion and the viability of that which can be made spiritually viable. The remainder of the densities is continuous refining of the choice. The choice is, as you put it, the work of a moment but is the axis upon which the creation turns. (B4, 13-14) RA: We are aware of creations in which 3rd density is lengthier to give a variant experience of the Creator. This creation is somewhat more condensed by its Logos than some other logoi have chosen. This creation is seen by us to be quite vivid. (B4, 14) C. WHAT IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR BEING IN 3RD DENSITY? QUESTION: What is needed to be in 3rd density? RA: There is one necessity for 3rd density, namely, self-awareness or self-consciousness. The body must be capable of abstract thought. The fundamental necessity is the combination of rational and intuitive thinking. (B1, 179) D. THE 3RD DENSITY HAS MORE CATALYSTS RA: Consider a 2nd density entity, the tree for instance. It is self-sufficient. Consider a 3rd density entity. The weakening of its physical vehicle, or body, was designed to distort entities towards a predisposition to deal with each other. Thus, the lessons which approach a knowing of love can be begin. The quickest way to learn is to deal with other-selves. This is a much greater catalyst than dealing with the self. Dealing with the self without otherselves is akin to living without mirrors. Then the self cannot see the fruits of its beingness. (B1, 180) E. CHANGES IN CONSCIOUSNESS IN 3RD DENSITY ARE GREATER THAN IN 4TH OR 5TH RA: There is very little work in consciousness in 4th and in 5th densities compared to the work done in 3rd density. (B2, 119) VI. 3RD DENSITY INNER PLANES = THE ASTRAL AND DEVACHANIC PLANES A. THE ASTRAL AND DEVACHANIC PLANES QUESTION: How many levels do we have then in the 3rd density at this time? RA: The 3rd density has an infinite number of levels. [Note: Elsewhere Ra explains that there are infinite octaves within octaves for every level of density.] QUESTION: I’ve read that there are 7 astral planes and 7 devachanic levels. Is this correct? RA: You speak of some of the more large distinctions in levels in your inner planes. That is correct. (B1, 168) QUESTION: Who inhabits the astral and devachanic planes? (B1, 168) RA: The astral planes vary from thought-forms in the lower extremities to enlightened beings who become dedicated to teaching and learning in the higher astral planes. In the devachanic planes are those even more close to the primal distortions of love/light. Beyond"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"these planes there are others. The invisible, or inner, 3rd density planes are inhabited by those who do not have body complexes such as yours; they do not collect about their spirit/mind complexes a chemical body. In the upper levels, desire to communicate knowledge back down to the outer planes of existence becomes less due to the intensive learn/teaching which occurs on these levels. B. THE URANTIA BOOK QUESTION: Who transmitted the Urantia Book? RA: This was given by a series of discarnate entities of your own Earth planes, the so- called inner pans. This material is not passed by the Council. (B1, 141) C. HOW DOES REINCARNATION WORK? RA: The illusion is created of light, or more properly but less understandably, light/love. This is in varying degrees of intensity. The spirit complex of an entity moves along the (spiraling) line of light until the light grows too glaring, at which time the entity stops. The entity may have barely reached 3rd density or may be very, very close to the ending of the 3rd density experience. RA: Some incarnate automatically, that is without any conscious self-awareness of the process of spiritual evolution. They are under the Guardians, beings whom you may call angelic. (B2, 121) RA: When the entity becomes aware of the mechanism for spiritual evolution, it will arrange and place those entities and lessons necessary for maximum growth and expression of polarity in the incarnative experience before the forgetting occurs. The only disadvantage of this is that some entities will attempt to learn to much during one incarnative experience that the intensity of the catalyst disarranges the entity and is not maximally used as intended. (B2, 122) D. HOW ARE REINCARNATIONS INTO THE PHYSICAL ALLOCATED? RA: Entities wishing to obtain critically needed experience in order to become harvestable are incarnated with priority over those who will, without too much probable/possible doubt, need to re-experience this density. (B1, 169) E. CAN WE CHOOSE OUR PARENTS? QUESTION: When incarnation ceases to be automatic, can an entity decide when he needs to incarnate for the benefit of his own learning. Does he select his parents? (B1, 194) RA: This is correct. QUESTION: At this time what percentage of the entities incarnating are making their own choices? RA: About 54%. (B1, 194) F. WE CAN GROW MORE IN 3RD DENSITY THAN IN BETWEEN INCARNATIONS. RA: This is correct. (B1, 113) G. MORE PERSONAL HELP IS AVAILABLE PROM THE INNER PLANES Jim McCarty: “The personal guides and teachers of the inner planes of our planet have much more leeway in offering personal information. Go to them for readings on your health and otter specific issues. Go to outer sources with questions that transcend space and time. If it will matter less in 10,000 years than it does now, it is probably not a universal question.\" (B5, 30) VII. A PHYSICAL VEHICLE IS NECESSARY FOR GROWTH IN EACH DENSITY - EXCEPT THE 8TH QUESTION: Was the physical body a device designed to accelerate the evolution of the mind? RA: It is perhaps more accurate to note that the yellow-ray physical vehicle is a necessity without which the mind/body/spirit complex cannot pursue evolution at any pace. The mind/body/spirit complex has an existence independent of any physical vehicle. However, in order to evolve, change, learn and manifest the Creator, the physical vehicles appropriate to each density are"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"necessary. Your question implied that physical vehicles accelerated growth. The more accurate description is that they permit growth. (B5, 183) VIII. THE 4TH DENSITY FOR THOSE OF POSITIVE ORIENTATION A. WHAT DETERMINES WHETHER YOU GRADUATE INTO 4TH DENSITY? RA: The necessity for graduation to 4th density is an ability to use, welcome and enjoy a certain intensity of the white light of the One Infinite Creator. (B4, 71) RA: It's a function of the intensity of the violet ray of the individual. (B2, 103) B. WHAT IS THE 4TH DENSITY LIKE? RA: There are no appropriate words. We can only say what it is not and approximate what it is. Beyond 4th density our ability to describe the density grows more limited until we become without words. (B4, 71) 1. It uses a type of bipedal body which is much denser in consciousness and more full of life. It does not use your heavy chemical vehicles or body. (B1, 157) 2. 4th density is not of words, unless chosen. One is aware of the thoughts and vibrations of otherselves. 3. It is a plane of compassion and understanding of the sorrows of 3rd density. 4. It is a plane striving towards wisdom or light. 5. It is a plane wherein individual differences are pronounced although automatically harmonized by group consensus. (B1, 157) 6. There is no disharmony within the self or within other peoples. It is not within the limits of possibility to cause disharmony in any way. (B1, 157) 7. When sickness is present, it is easily healed. (B1, 157) RA: The 4th density is one of revealed information. Selves are not hidden to self or other- selves. The imbalances or distortions which are of a destructive nature show in mote obvious ways, the body acting as a machine resource for self revelation [Recall that ACIM calls the body a learning device for the mind]. Illnesses such as cancer are very amenable to self-healing once the mechanism of the destructive influence has been grasped by the individual. (B2, 82) RA: The 4th density abounds in compassion. This compassion is folly when seen through the eyes of wisdom. It is the salvation of 3rd density but creates a mismatch in the ultimate balance of the entity. (B2, 95) C. THE NEED TO CONSUME FOOD TEACHES PATIENCE QUESTION: Is the physical vehicle similar to the one in 3rd density? (B2, 103) RA: The chemical elements are not the same. However, the appearance is similar. QUESTION: Is it necessary to eat food? RA: This is correct. (B2, 103) QUESTION: This means that some kind of social catalyst, like having to work to get food, is active in 4th density. Is this correct? RA: This is incorrect. The 4th density being desires to serve and the preparation of foodstuffs is extremely simple due to increased communication between entity and living foodstuff. Therefore, the work needed to acquire food is not a significant catalyst. But there is a catalyst involved. It is the necessity for eating the food. Eating food is not considered to be of importance to 4th density entities and therefore it aids in teaching patience. (B2, 104) QUESTION: How does it teach patience? RA: To stop the functioning of service-to-others long enough to ingest food is to invoke patience. (B2, 104) D. THE SOCIAL MEMORY COMPLEX IS A 4TH DENSITY PHENOMENON. (B2, 72) RA: The work that is accomplished in positive 4th density is that work whereby the positive social memory complex, having through slow stages, harmoniously integrated"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"itself, goes forth to aid those of less positive orientation which seek their aid. Greater and greater intensities of understanding or compassion are attained. This intensity continues until the appropriate intensity of the light may be welcomed. This is 4th density harvest. (B2, 119) QUESTION: At what stage does a planet achieve social memory? RA: W hen its entire group of entities are of one orientation or seeking. Then the group memory lost to the individuals in the roots of the tree of mind becomes known to the social complex, thus creating a social memory complex. (B1, 119) RA: When a group of mind/body/spirits becomes able to form a social memory complex, all experiences of each entity is available to the whole of the complex. (B2, 111) E. IS AN ENTITY IN THE 4TH DENSITY NORMALLY INVISIBLE TO US? RA: The 4th density is, by choice, not visible to third density. It is possible for 4th density to be visible. However, the 4th density entity must concentrate upon a rather difficult vibrational pattern or complex - which is the 3rd density you experience. (B1, 126) F. IT HAS THE CONCEPT OF PROTECTING LOVED OTHER-SELVES RA: The impulse to protect the loved other-self is one which persists through the 4th density, a density abounding in compassion. (B2, 48) G. LIFESPAN AND LENGTH OF CYCLE RA: The typical time for one incarnation or \"lifetime\" in the harmonious 4th density is approximately 90,000 of your years as you measure time. (B2, 102) QUESTION: How long is a cycle of experience in 4th density in our years? RA: The cycle lasts approximately 30 million of your years if the entities are not capable of being harvested sooner. (B2, 103) [NOTE: Recall that the cycle for 3rd density is 75 thousand years.] IX. THE 4TH DENSITY FOR THOSE OF NEGATIVE ORIENTATION QUESTION: Could you give me some idea of what conditions are like on a 4th density negative or service-to-self planet? RA: The planetary conditions of 4th density negative include the constant alignment and realignment of entities in efforts to form dominant patterns of combined energy. The early 4th density is ore of most intensive struggle. When the order of authority has been established and all have fought until convinced that each is in the proper placement for power structure, the social memory complex begins. The 4th density effect of telepathy and the transparency of thought are always used for the sake of those at the top of the power structure. (B2, 73-74) RA: In the 4th density the methods used in battle are mental rather than manifested weapons. (B3, 123) X. THE 5TH DENSITY A. 5TH DENSITY IS THE WISDOM DENSITY QUESTION: Graduation into 5th density is a function of the violet ray for the entire memory complex. Is this correct? RA: This is correct although in 5th density entities may choose to learn as a social memory complex or as mind/body/spirit complex. The wisdom density is an extremely free density whereas the lessons of compassion leading to wisdom necessarily have to do with other- selves. (B2, 103)"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"B. THE LAW OF ONE IS CONSCIOUSLY ACCEPTED RA: 5th density is extremely white in vibration. (B2, 50) QUESTION: At what point in the densities is it necessary for an entity to be consciously aware of the Law of One in order to progress? RA: The 5th density harvest is of those who accept the honor and duty of the Law of One. (B1, 157) C. AMBROSIA IS CONSUMED, BUT IT IS NOT A CATALYST QUESTION: I am guessing that it is not necessary to ingest foodstuffs in 5th density. Is this correct? RA: This is incorrect. However, the vehicle needs food which may be prepared by thought - a nectar or ambrosia or light broth of golden white hue. (B2, 104) QUESTION: Does the fueling of the body teach, i.e., is it a catalyst for learning? RA: In 5th density it is a comfort for those of like mind gathered together to share in this broth, thus becoming one in light and wisdom while joining hearts and hands in physical activity. It becomes a solace rather than a catalyst for learning. (B2, 105) D. PHYSICAL APPEARANCE QUESTION: Do some of them look just like us? Could they pass for Earth people? RA: That is correct. Those of this nature are most often 5th density. (B3, 22) QUESTION: I assume the same answer would apply to the Orion group. Is this correct? RA: This is correct. (B3, 22) RA: In 5th density the manifestation of the physical complex is more and more under the control of the conscious mind complex. Therefore the 5th density entity may dissolve one manifestation and create another. (B4, 136) F. LIGHT IS A TOOL RA: In 5th density light is as visible a tool as your pencil's writing. (B3, 131) (NOTE: See Topic #55: Working with Light.) XI. RA IS 6TH DENSITY RA: 6th density is white with a golden quality. This quality relates to the blending into wisdom of the compassion learned in 4th density. (B2, 50) RA: I am 6th density with a strong seeking towards 7th density. The harvest for us will be in only (approximately) 2.5 million of your years and it is our desire to be ready for harvest as it approaches our space/time continuum. (B1, 138) QUESTION: And you ready yourselves for this harvest through service? RA: This is correct. (B1, 139) QUESTION: Can you describe the techniques used by Ra in seeking in the direction of service? RA: Much is lost in transmission of concept from density to density, and the discussion of 6th density is inevitably distorted greatly. However, we shall attempt to answer. We seek the Creator upon a level of shared experience to which you are capable of knowing about. Rather than surrounding ourselves in light we have become light. Our understanding is that there is no other material except light. Our techniques are an infinitely subtle continuation of the balancing processes which you are now beginning to experience. We seek without polarity. Thus we do not invoke any power from without, but our search has become internalized as we become light/love and love/light. We seek balances between love and wisdom which more and more allow our understanding of experience to be informed that we may come closer and closer to the unity with the One Creator which we so joyfully seek. (B3, 98) XII. THE 7TH DENSITY RA: The 7th density being, the completed being, the Creator who knows Itself, accumulates mass (i.e. spiritual mass) and compacts into the One Creator once again (presumably as it enters 8th density). (B2, 75)"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"RA: There are portions of the 7th density which, although described to us by our teachers, remain mysterious. We have experienced a great deal of the available refining catalyst of this octave, and our teachers have worked with us most carefully that we may be one with all, that in turn our eventual returning to the great all-ness of creation shall be complete. (B4, 58) XIII. THE HIGHEST DENSITY IS THE 8TH DENSITY QUESTION: The Law of One is truly universal in creating a progression towards the 8th density in all galaxies. Correct? RA: That is correct. There are infinite forms, infinite understandings, but the progression is one. (B1, 156) RA: Intelligent infinity is brought into intelligent energy from the 8th density. (B1, 141) XIV. THE NEXT OCTAVE BEGINS AT THE COMPLETION OF THE 8TH DENSITY RA: The 8th density functions also as the beginning density or 1st density of the next octave of densities. QUESTION: Are you saying that there are an infinite number of octaves of densities? RA: W e can not speak in firm knowledge of all the creations. W e only know that they are infinite. W e assume an infinite number of octaves. However it has been impressed upon us by our own teachers that there is a mystery-clad unity of creation in which all consciousness periodically coalesces and again begins. W e understand it is cyclical in nature. (B2, 15) [Note: It is possible that this could relate to the macro-galaxy formed by all galaxies in the Universe as a whole, and its behavior in terms of expansion and eventual re-contraction.] XV. THE AKASHIC RECORDS RA: Intelligent infinity is brought into intelligent energy from 8th density. Edgar Cayce used this gateway to view the present, which is not the continuum you experience but your planet’s potential social memory complex - which you call the “Akashic Records” or the \"Hall of Records”. (B1, 141) XVI. TIME/SPACE OPERATES IN THE 3RD DENSITY INNER PLANE (NOTE: Presumably this is what is also called the astral plane) A. INCARNATION TAKES YOU FROM TIME/SPACE TO SPACE/TIME RA: The incarnative process involves being incarnated from time/space to Space/time. (B3, 145) B. IN TIME/SPACE, AN “IMAGE” IS MADE OF OCCURRENCES AT DIFFERENT TIMES  QUESTION: As an entity goes through the death process in 3rd density it finds itself in time/space. Would you describe that. (B3, 158) RA: In space/time the spatial locations of different material objects, all of which appear in the visual field at the same instant of time, produces a tangible framework for the illusion of space. In time/space the inequity (i.e., the differences perceived?) is upon the shoulders of what you call time. This property renders entities and experiences intangible in a relative sense. C. PARTICLES MOVE FASTER THAN LIGHT IN TIME/SPACE In your framework each particle, or core vibration, moves at a velocity which approaches what you call the speed of light from the direction of superlumimal (greater-than-light- speed) velocities."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" D. EVERYTHING CAN BE REVIEWED AND FORGIVEN IN TIME/SPACE In these metaphysical planes there is a great deal of what you call time which is used to review and re-review the learning and teachings of a previous space/time incarnation. The extreme fluidity of these regions makes it possible to penetrate many things which need to be absorbed before healing of an entity may be accomplished. Each entity is located in a somewhat immobile state in space - much as you are located in space/time in a somewhat immobile state in time (i.e., it’s not that time is unchanging in space/time but rather that we do not have any control over the flow of time by making it stop or go slower or go faster). There will be certain helpers which assist in this healing process. The process involves seeing the experience in fill against the backdrop of the entity's total experience, forgiving the self of all mis-steps as regards the missed guideposts during the incarnation and, finally, the careful assessment of the next necessities for learning. This is done entirely by the Higher Self until an entity has become conscious in space/time of the process and means of spiritual evolution at which time the entity will consciously take part in all decisions. (B3, 157) RA: In space/time it is not possible to determine the course of events beyond the incarnation but only to correct present imbalances. In time/space, on the other hand, it is not possible to correct any imbalanced actions but rather to perceive the imbalances and thusly forgive the self for that which is. THE ADVANTAGE OF TIME/SPACE IS THAT OF THE FLUIDITY OF THE OVERVIEW . THE ADVANTAGE OF SPACE/TIME IS THAT, W ORKING IN DARKNESS W ITH A TINY CANDLE, ONE MAY CORRECT THE IMBALANCES. (B3, 158) E. TIME/SPACE HAS ITS OWN STRUCTURE AND LAWS RA: Time/space is no more homogeneous than space/time. It is as complex and complete a system of illusions, dances and patterns as is space/time and has as structured a system of what you may call natural laws (B3, 152) F. EACH PLANET WITH 3RD DENSITY ENTITIES HAS A CORRESPONDING TIME/SPACE QUESTION: Are the processes that we are talking about processes that occur on many planets in our Milky Way Galaxy, or do they occur on all planets, or what percentage? RA: These processes occur upon all planets which have given birth to sub-logoi such as yourselves. (B3, l58) G. ALL TIMES ARE SIMULTANEOUS IN TIME/SPACE RA: In time/space, which is precisely as much of your self as is space/time, all times are simultaneous, just as, in your geography, your cities and villages are all functioning, bustling and alive with entities going about their business all at once. So it is in time/space with the self. (B3, 151) [Note: It is important to remember that Ra indicates each dimension as having a space/time and time/space component.] 15. THE GALAXIES DEFINITIONS: 1. Logos - a galactic level creator; the creator of all the stars in a particular galaxy. Defines the natural laws of physics for that galaxy, establishes its own “personality” of deep-mind archetypes and a form for consciousness to express itself, such as the human bodily form: the template for all evolution in this and neighboring galaxies."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"2. Sub-Logos = An entity whose physical body is a star = a planetary level creator; the creator of all the planets in a particular solar system. I. EACH GALAXY IS CREATED BY A DIFFERENT LOGOS RA: A Logos may create what you call a star system or a logos may create billions of star Systems (i.e., a galaxy), Them are many different logos entities or creations. (B2, 13) QUESTION: How much of the creation was crated by the same logos that created this planet? RA This planetary Logos is a strong Logos, creating approximately 250 billion of your star systems for Its creation. (B2, 13) QUESTION: I believe that some planets develop quite rapidly into higher density planets and some take longer times. Can you give some idea of that development? RA: The particular Logos of your major galaxy has used a large portion of Its coalesced material to reflect the being-ness of the Creator. In this way there is much of your galactic system which does not have the progression you speak of but dwells spiritually as a portion of the Logos. Of those entities (i.e., planets) on which consciousness dwells there is a variety of time periods needed to attain higher densities of consciousness. (B2, 24) II. THE SPACE NEAR THE CENTER OF THE GALAXY IS AT A MORE ADVANCED PHASE QUESTION: Does that mean that the stars near the center of the galaxy do not have planets? RA: That is incorrect. The Logos has distributed Itself throughout your galactic system. However, the time/space continua of some of your more central sun Systems are much further advanced. (B2, 29) QUESTION: Could you say that there is a greater spiritual density or quality in the center of this galaxy? RA: The spiritual density or mass of those towards the center of the galactic spiral is due to the varying timelessness states during which the planetary spheres may coalesce. (B2, 29) III. SOME GALAXIES HAVE A GREATER PERCENTAGES OF NEGATIVE HARVESTS RA: There have been Logoi with greater percentages of negative harvests. There are Logoi which have offered a neutral background against which to polarize. This Logos chose not to do so but instead to allow more of the love and light of the Infinite Creator to be both inwardly and outwardly visible and available to those undergoing Its care in experimenting. (B4, 141) IV. IN OUR GALAXY COMMUNICATION FROM HIGHER REALMS (SUCH AS FROM RA) IS ALLOWED QUESTION: Were there any other plans set up by the Logos for the evolution of Its path through the densities. RA: One more; that is, the permeability of the densities so that there may be communication from density to density. (B4, 141) V. THE LOGOS (GALACTIC CREATOR) DIVIDES ITSELF INTO OTHER INDIVIDUALIZED CREATORS QUESTION: Since there are many individualized portions of consciousness in our galaxy, did the Logos then subdivide into more individualization of consciousness to create these consciousnesses? (B2, 14) RA: This is correct. It would seem that if one Logos creates the intelligent energy ways for a large system there would not be the necessity of the further sub-Logos differentiation. However, within limits, this is precisely the case. (B2, 14)"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"VI. RA'S INTERACTION WITH OTHER GALAXIES QUESTION: We presently find ourselves in the Milky Way Galaxy of some 200 or so billion stars, and we know or millions and millions of these large galaxies spread out through what we call space. To Ra's knowledge, can I assume that the number of these galaxies is infinite? (B4, 59) RA: This is precisely correct and is a significant point. QUESTION: The point being that we have unity. Is that correct? RA: You are perceptive. QUESTION: Then what portion of these galaxies is Ra aware of? Has Ra experienced consciousness in many other of these galaxies? (B4, 59) RA: No. QUESTION: Has Ra experienced or does Ra have knowledge of any of these other galaxies? Has Ra traveled to, in one form or another, any of these galaxies? (B4, 59) RA: WE HAVE OPENED OUR HEARTS IN RADIATION OF LOVE TO THE ENTIRE CREATION. APPROXIMATELY 90% OF THE CREATION IS AT SOME LEVEL AWARE OF THE SENDING AND ABLE TO REPLY. ALL OF THE INFINITE LOGOI ARE ONE IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF LOVE. This is the type of contact which we enjoy rather than travel. (B4, 59) VII. RA HAS AIDED VARIOUS SUB-LOGOI (STARS SYSTEMS) IN THE GALAXY QUESTION: What are the limits of Ra's travel in the sense of directly experiencing or seeing the activities of various places? Is it solely in this galaxy, and if so, how much of this galaxy? RA: Although it would be possible for us to move at will throughout the creation within this logos, that is to say, the Milky Way Galaxy, so called, we have moved where we were called to service; these locations being local and including Alpha Centauri, the planets of your solar system. Cephus and Zeta Reticuli. To these sub-logoi we have come, having been called. (B4, 59-60) QUESTION: Were the calls from 3rd density or some other density? (B4, 63) RA: In general, from other densities. In the case of your Sun 3rd density is the density of calling. QUESTION: Ra then has not moved at any time into one of the other major galaxies. Is this correct? RA: That is correct. (B4, 60) VIII. RA'S KNOWLEDGE OF OTHER GALAXIES QUESTION: Does Ra have knowledge of any other major galaxy or the consciousness of anything in that galaxy? RA: There are those among our social memory complex which have become Wanderers in other major galaxies. Thus there has been knowledge of other major galaxies, for to one whose mind/body/spirit complex has been crystallized the universe is one place and there is no bar upon travel. (B4, 60) QUESTION: Is Ra familiar with the archetypical mind, i.e. the basic structure of the mind, of some other logos that is not the same as the one we experience? (B4, 139) RA: THERE ARE SOME OF RA W HICH HAVE SERVED AS FAR W ANDERERS TO THOSE OF ANOTHER LOGOS. THE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN ONE W HICH STAGGERS THE INTELLECTUAL AND INTUITIVE CAPACITIES. (B4, 139) IX. ALL THE INFINITE NUMBER OF GALAXIES ARE OF THIS OCTAVE QUESTION: All of these galaxies, this infinite number of galaxies that we can just begin to become aware of with our telescopes, are all of the same Octave. Is this correct? (B4, 60) RA: That is correct."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"   16. THE PLANETS IN OUR GALAXY    I. HOW MANY ARE INHABITED? QUESTION: How many planets in our galaxy are inhabited? (B1, 154) RA: Approximately 1/5 of all planetary entities contain awareness of one or more densities. (NOTE: RA is saying that 1/5 of the planets have beings of some density or other on them.) QUESTION: Are the processes that we are talking about processes that occur on many planets in our Milky Way Galaxy, or do they occur on all planets, or what percentage? (B3, 158) RA. These processes occur upon all planets which have given birth to sub-logoi (more accurately, sub-sub-logoi) such as yourselves. The percentage of inhabited planets is approximately 10%. (B3, 158) QUESTION: What percentage of stars have planetary systems? RA: Approximately 32% of stars have planets as you know them while another 6% have some sort of clustering material which can be inhabited in some densities. (B3, 158) II. HOW MANY LOOK LIKE US ? QUESTION: If you were to move a 3rd density entity from some other planet to this planet, what percentage of all those within the knowledge of Ra would look enough like entities of Earth that they would go unnoticed in a crowd? (B4, 136) RA: Perhaps 5 percent. QUESTION: What percentage would be similar enough to us that we would assume they were human even though they were a bit different? (B4, 137) RA: Perhaps 13 to 15 percent. [Note: It is important to remember that Ra is discussing all of the Creation, not just the Milky Way and neighboring galaxies, which decided upon the humanoid form.] III. HOW MANY ARE AWARE ? QUESTION: How many planets, in total, in this galaxy of stars are aware, regardless of density? RA: Approximately 67 million. (B1, 154) IV. WHAT DENSITY ARE THEY IN ? QUESTION: What percentage are of the different densities? RA: 1st density = 17%; 2nd density = 20%; 3rd density = 27%; 4th density = 16%; 5th density = 6%; (That only adds up to 86%.) The other information must be withheld. (B1, 154) V. DO THEY ALL MOVE FORWARD BY USING THE LAW OF ONE ? QUESTION: Of the planets with these first densities, have all of them progressed from the 3rd density by knowledge and application of the Law of One? RA: This is correct. (B1, 154) VI. HOW MANY ARE NEGATIVE? QUESTION: What percentage are polarized negatively towards service to self? RA: Given the Law of Confusion we cannot answer this. We may say that the negatively oriented spheres are much fewer. (B1, 154) VII. HOW MANY HARVESTS ARE NEGATIVE? RA: Among planetary harvests approximately 10% are negative, approximately 60% are positive and the remaining 30% are mixed - with nearly all those harvested in the mixed harvest being positive. It is almost unknown for the majority of a mired harvest to be negative. When a planet"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"moves strongly towards the negative there is almost no opportunity for harvestable positive polarization. (B3, 109) QUESTION: Why is there almost no opportunity in that ease? RA: The ability to polarize positively requires a certain degree of self determination. (B3, 109) VIII. IS OUR PLANET HOLLOW ? RA: You may say that your sphere is of a honeycomb nature. The center is, however, solid if you would so call that which is molten (presumably molten iron). (B3, 69) QUESTION: Are there 3rd density entities living in the honeycomb areas? RA: This was at one time correct. This is not correct at the present time. (B3, 69) 17. SOME PLANETS IN OUR GALAXY WERE CREATED WITHOUT POLARITY I. PLANETS WITH A GARDEN OF EDEN-LIKE EXISTENCE - WITHOUT ANY NEGATIVE POLARITY A. FREE WILL IS NOT REALLY PRESENT - BECAUSE CERTAIN CHOICES ARE NOT POSSIBLE QUESTION: Would it be possible for this work of our density m be performed if all of the sub-logoi (planetary creators) chose the same polarity for a particular expression of a logos (galactic creator)? Suppose our sun created nothing but positive polarity. Would work then be done in 4th density and higher on that basis? (B4, 21) RA: It is, to our knowledge, only in the absence of free will that the conditions of which you speak obtain. (B4, 41) B. THERE W AS NO VEIL OF FORGETFULNESS RA: There were logoi which chose to set the plan for the spiritual evolution through the densities without the prior application of free will. (B4, 21) QUESTION: Was the veil that blocked out knowledge of previous incarnations, etc, in effect for these entities which know only the service-to-others orientation. (B4, 37) RA: No. C. PROGRESS THROUGH THE 3RD AND 4TH DENSITIES WAS EXTREMELY SLOW RA: In such a procession of densities you find an extraordinarily long 3rd density, as you measure time; and likewise, for 4th density. Then as the entities begin to see the Creator, there is a very rapid procession towards the 8th density. This is due to the fact that one who knows not, cares not. (Note: I do not know what this means??) (B4, 21) D. THE FINAL GIFT TO THE CREATOR WAS WITHOUT QUALITY RA Those logoi, whose creations have been set up without free will have not, in the feeling of the logoi, given the Creator the quality and variety of experience of Itself as have those Logoi which have incorporated free will in their creations. (B4, 21) E. WHAT WERE THESE SOCIETIES LIKE? QUESTION: Prior to the forgetting process there was no concept of anything but service-to- others polarization. What sort of societies evolved in this condition? RA: It was a most boring experience in which lessons were learned with the relative speed of the turtle compared to the cheetah. (B4, 67) RA: When one dwells within what might be seen as a state of constant inspiration, even their most sophisticated societies lacked will, high spirit or gusto. (B4, 68) RA: The societies did not have intentional enslavement of some for the benefit of others, this not being seen to be a possibility when all are seen as one. There was, however, the"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"requisite amount of disharmony to produce various experiments in what you may call governmental structures. (B4, 75) F. WHY COULDN'T THEY PROGRESS MORE RAPIDLY? (1) THEY DID NOT EXHIBIT STRONG LOVE OR SERVICE TO OTHERS QUESTION: Why did they have such a difficult time serving others to the extent necessary for graduation since this was the only polarization available? (B4, 68) RA: Consider, if you will, the tendency of those who are divinely happy, as you call this distortion. They have little urge to alter or better their condition. There is the possibility of love of other-selves and service to other-selves, but there is the overwhelming awareness of the Creator in the self. The Connection with the Creator is that of the umbilical cord. The security is total. Therefore no love is terribly important, no pain terribly frightening; no effort, therefore, is made to serve for love or to benefit from fear. (B4, 69) (2) THEY HAD TROUBLE OVERCOMING THE BARRIER BETWEEN THE DENSITIES QUESTION: Elsewhere you stated that the condition for being harvestable into 4th density is being polarized more than 50% service to others. Was this also the condition before the veil? (B4, 70) RA: Prior to the veiling process the movement through densities would he that of an entity walking up a set of your stairs, each of which had a certain quality of light. The stair upon which an entity stopped would be either 3rd density light or 4th density light. Between the two stairs lies the threshold. To cross that threshold is difficult. There is resistance at the edge, shall we say, of each density. (B4, 71) (3) THERE WAS VERY LITTLE DEVELOPMENT OF FAITH OR WILL The facility of faith or will needs to be understood, nourished and developed in order to have an entity which seeks past the boundary of 3rd density. THOSE ENTITIES W HICH DO NOT DO THEIR HOMEW ORK, BE THEY EVER SO AMIABLE OR LIKABLE, SHALL NOT CROSS. It was this situation which faced the logoi prior to the veiling process. (B4, 71) (4) CATALYSTS WERE NOT EFFECTIVE STATEMENT: Prior to the veiling process that which we call catalyst after the veiling was not catalyst simply because it was not efficiently creating polarity. What we call catalyst was seen much more clearly as the experience of the One Creator and was not seen as something that was caused by other entities. (B4, 176) H. THERE WAS A REVIEW BUT NO HEALING IN THE PLACE IN BETWEEN INCARNATIONS QUESTION: For those of our planet there is healing activity and a review of the incarnation that occurs in the astral plane, between physical incarnations. Did that occur prior to the veil? RA: Where there has been no harm there need be no healing. (B4, 69) QUESTION: Before the veil, during the review of the incarnation, were the entities at that time aware that what they were trying to do was to polarize sufficiently for graduation? (B4, 70) RA: That is correct. QUESTION: Then I am assuming that this awareness was somehow reduced when they incarnated into 3rd density even though there was no veil. Is this correct? (B4, 70) RA: That is distinctly correct."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"QUESTION: I assume that the condition of having an overwhelming awareness of the Creator was present throughout the entire spectrum of experience, whether it might be between incarnations or during incarnations; that the entities just simply did not manifest the desire to create the polarization necessary for graduation at harvest time. Is this correct?  RA: You begin to grasp the situation. (B4, 70) II. PLANETS WITH ONLY POSITIVE POLARIZATION ARE NEAR THE CENTER OF THE GALAXY QUESTION: The progress of evolution was from the center outward toward the rim of the galaxy. In the early evolution of this galaxy the first distortion (free will) was not extended down past the level of the sub-logos (their “sun”) simply because it was not thought of or conceived of. This extension of the first distortion, which created polarization, was something that occurs in what we would call a later time as the evolution progressed outward from the center of the galaxy. Is this correct? (B4, 26) RA: That is correct. QUESTION: Is this pattern, where the central suns had no negative polarization, also found in the other major galaxies with which Wanderers from Ra have experience? (B4, 61) RA: That is correct. [Note: Refer to part V, “Word” of the effectiveness of total free will spread to other galaxies. Once the Creation was already well along the way of its development, the idea of creating a veil between the conscious and subconscious aspects of mind, body and spirit were seen to be of immense evolutionary value, and the decision to engender this veil spread almost instantly throughout all of the creation, in a “hundredth monkey” fashion.] III. THE CONCEPT OF POLARITY A. THE CONSEQUENCES OF POLARITY WERE UNIMAGINED UNTIL EXPERIENCED QUESTION: Did any logoi using evolution with only one polarity choose the service-to- self path? RA: Those whom you would call early logoi which chose lack of free will foundations, with no exception, chose the service-to-others path. The, shall we say, saga of polarity, its consequences and limits, were unimagined until experienced. (B4, 22) QUESTION: The Logoi that did not choose this free will path did not choose it simply because they had not conceived of it. Later Logoi experienced it as an outcropping or growth from their extension of the first distortion. Is that correct? (B4, 22) RA: Yes. QUESTION: The central suns of our galaxy, in starting the evolutionary process in this galaxy, provided for the refinement or consciousness through the densities we experience here. However, they did not conceive of the polarization of consciousness of the type of service-to-others polarity versus service-to-self polarity. Is that correct? (B4, 28) RA: Yes, that is correct. B. WAS THERE ANY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE TO GUIDE THE LOGOI? QUESTION: I presume these logoi in the center of the galaxy wished to create a system of experience for the One Creator. Did they then start with no previous experience or information about how to do this? (B4, 26)"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"RA: At the beginning of this creation, or octave, there were things known which were the harvest of the preceding octave. About the preceding Creation, we know as little as we do of the octave to come. (B4, 27) C. WAS THE CONCEPT OF POLARITY BROUGHT OVER FROM THE PREVIOUS OCTAVE? QUESTION: Was there any concept of polarity carried through from the previous Octave in the sense of service-to-others or service-to-self polarity? RA: There was polarity in the sense of the mover and the moved. There was no polarity in the sense of service-to-self and service-to-others. (B4, 28) QUESTION: In our octave of existence we have the concept of the 7 densities of vibration (or consciousness), with the evolutionary process moving forward through successive densities. Was this concept carried through from the previous octave of existence? RA: To the limits of our knowledge, which are narrow, the ways of the octave are without time; that is, there are 7 densities in each creation infinitely. (B4, 28) IV. THE INTRODUCTION OF POLARITY A. POLARITY AROSE FROM THE EXTENSION OF THE 1ST DISTORTION (FREE WILL) QUESTION: In the original evolution plan, the 1st distortion was not extended by the logos to the product of its creation. At some point the 1st distortion was extended, and the first service-to-self polarity emerged. Is this correct? (B4, 29) RA: The Logoi always conceived of themselves as offering free will to the sub-- Logoi in their care. The sub-Logoi (planetary creators) had freedom to experience and to experiment with consciousness, the experiences of the body, and the illumination of the spirit. (B4, 29) QUESTION: Was the veil, or loss of remembering consciously, which occurred before the incarnation, the primary tool for extending the first distortion. (B4, 38) RA: This was the first tool. B. BOTH POLARITIES APPEARED IMMEDIATELY QUESTION: When this experiment with the veiling process first occurred, did it result in service-to-self polarization in the first experiment? (B4, 42) RA: The early, if we may use this term, Logoi produced service-to-self and service-to- others entities immediately. The harvestability of these entities was not so immediate and thus refinements of the archetypes began. (B4, 42) NOTE FROM THE FOREWORD: The archetypical mind is the mind of the logos, the blueprint used to make the Creation and the means by which we evolve in mind, body and spirit. (B4, Foreword p.1) C. THE “KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL\" RA: For example, consider the relative harmony and changing quality of existence in one of your primitive tribes. The entities have the concept of lawful and taboo, but the law is inexorable (unchanging) and all events occur as predestined. \"There is no concept of right and wrong, good or bad. It is a culture in monochrome (colorless). (B4, 21) D. LUCIFER IS NOT THE “DEVIL\" RA: In this context you may see the one you call Lucifer as the true light-bringer in that the knowledge of good and evil both precipitated the entities of this logos (galactic creator) from the Edenic conditions of constant contentment and also provided the impetus to move, to work, and to learn. (B4, 21) [Note: In other words, the presence of the negative forces provided the catalyst for growth, giving the knowledge of polarity and evil. By creating such intense struggle and hardship,"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"the Luciferian force stimulated desire for change and growth in otherwise harmonious but slow-advancing cultures.] E. OUR LOGOS INCLUDED POLARITY IN ITS PLAN QUESTION: Then did this particular logos that we experience plan for this polarity and know all about it prior to its plan? (B4, 22) RA: That is quite correct. F. FREE WILL IN THE FULL SENSE (TOTAL FREE WILL) IS GIVEN RA: The first logos to instill what you now see as free will, in the full sense, in its sub- logos came to this portion after contemplation in depth of what we call significators. The logos put forward the possibility of the mind, body, and spirit as being complex (i.e., having a split mind or veil), and having a significator that would balance all catalysts. In order for the significator to be what it is not. It then must he granted the free will of the Creator. (B4, 29) F. DID TOTAL FREE WILL INCREASE MAGICAL ABILITY? QUESTION: Was the magical potential at the end of the 4th density, before the extension of free will, as great as it is now at the end of the 4th density? (B4, 43) RA: If we may use this misnomer, magic, the magical potential in 3rd and 4th density was then far greater than after the veiling. However, there was far, far less desire or will to use this potential prior to veiling. (B4, 43) QUESTION: Why was it less? RA: Magical ability is the ability to consciously use the so-called unconscious. Therefore there was maximal magical ability prior to the veiling. (B4, 43) V. \"WORD\" OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TOTAL FREE WILL SPREAD TO OTHER GALAXIES QUESTION: There must have been some type of communication throughout the octave so that, when the first experiment became effective. Knowledge of this spread rapidly and was picked up by budding galactic spirals. Is this correct? (B4, 62) RA: That is correct. To be aware of the nature of this communication is to be aware of the nature or the logos. Much of what you call creation has never separated from the One logos of this octave and resides within the One Infinite Creator. Communication in such an environment is the communication of cells of the body. That which is learned by one is known to all. (B4, 62) 18. THE SIRIUS SYSTEM AND BALANCE I. THE 3RD DENSITY ENTITIES EVOLVED FROM TREES QUESTION: I was wondering if the social memory complex from the Sirius star evolved from trees? RA: This approaches correctness. Those 2nd density vegetation forms which graduated into 3rd density upon the planet bearing the name of Dog were close to the tree as you know it. (B2, 72) II. THEY MUST MEDITATE UPON HOSTILE ACTIONS QUESTION: Since warlike actions are impossible with vegetation, would they not have the advantage going into 3rd density from the 2nd, of not carrying a racial memory of war and therefore develop a more harmonious nature and accelerate their evolution? (B2, 72) RA: This is correct. However, to become balanced and to begin to polarize properly it is then necessary to investigate movements of all kinds, especially those that are warlike. (B2, 72) QUESTION: Would their investigations of warlike actions be primarily of the type that they extracted from Charlie Nixon's memory rather than warfare among themselves? RA: This is correct."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Entities of this heritage would find it nearly impossible to fight. Indeed, their studies of movements of all kinds is their form of meditation due to the fact that their usual activity is upon a level you would call meditation and this must be balanced, just as your entities need constant moments of meditation to balance your activities. (B2, 72-73) III. THEY MOVED WITHOUT MOVING THEIR I FOS QUESTION: We are told by Charlie Nixon that these entities moved without moving their legs. Is this a direct function of the mind somehow connected to the planet's magnetic action? RA: This is largely correct. It is an electromagnetic phenomenon which is controlled by thought impulses of a weak electrical nature. (B2, 73) QUESTION: Was their craft visible to us and made of 3rd density material like this chair? RA: This is correct. 19. THE SUN I. A HIERARCHY OF CREATORS: LOGOS CREATED THE SUN, THE SUN CREATED THE PLANETS (Recall that the logos -- creative principle = Creator-God) QUESTION: Is our sun the physical manifestation of a sub-logos? (B2, 18) RA: That is correct. QUESTION: The planetary system of our sun, in all its densities, is the total of the experience created by our sun as a sub-logos. Is that correct. (B3, 23) RA: That is correct. QUESTION: Are there any sub-sub-logoi that are found in our planetary system that are sub to our sun, on a creative level below our sun? RA: That is correct. QUESTION: Would you give me an example of what I call a sub-sub-logos? RA: One example is your mind/body/spirit complex. (B2, 18) QUESTION: Then every entity that exists would be some type of sub or sub-sub-Logos. Is this correct? RA: This is correct.  THE ENTIRE CREATION IS ALIVE. (B2, 18) II. THE SUN HAS NO LESSONS TO LEARN NO DENSITIES TO MOVE THROUGH QUESTION: Do the sub-logoi, such as our sun, have a metaphysical positive or negative polarity? RA: Not as you use the term. Entities through the level of planetary have the strength of intelligent infinity through the use of free will. THE CREATIONS OF THE ONE INFINITE CREATOR DOES NOT HAVE THE POLARITY YOU SPEAK OF. (B2, 18) QUESTION: Does the sun itself have a density? RA: The sub-logos which is our sun is of the entire octave and is not that entity which experiences the learning and teachings of entities such as yourself. (B2, 86) III. THE SUN IS SEEN AS IT REALLY IS ONLY IN 4TH - 7TH DENSITY QUESTION: Could I look at a single sun as an entity?"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"RA: YOU CAN, BUT NOT WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF 3RD DENSITY SPACE/TIME. (B3, 110) RA: Metaphysically, the sun achieves a meaning to 4th through 7th densities according to the growing abilities of entities in these densities to grasp the living creation and other-self nature of this sun body. Thus by the 6th density the sun may be visited and inhabited by those dwelling in time/space and may even be partially created from moment to moment by the processes of 6th density entities visiting within the sun. (B2, 85) IV. 6TH DENSITY LEVEL PRODUCES THE LIGHT OF THE SUN QUESTION: Could you explain how the 6th density entities are creating the sun? RA: In this density some entities whose means of reproduction is fusion may choose to perform this portion of experience as part of the beingness of the sun body. Thus you may think of the light that you receive as offspring of the generative expression, or birthing, of 6th density love. (B2, 85- 86) 20. THE BLACK HOLE AND THE GREAT CENTRAL SUN I. GRAVITY RA: THE METAPHYSICAL AND PHYSICAL ARE INSEPARABLE. (B2, 20) RA: Gravity, the attractive force, which we also describe as the pressing outward force towards the Creator, is greater spiritually upon the entity you call Venus due to the greater degree of their success at seeking the Creator. When all of creation, in its infinity has reached a spiritual gravitational mass of sufficient nature, the new creation infinitely coalesces the light seeking and finding its source and thusly ending the creation, and then beginning anew creation much as you consider the black hole with its condition of infinitely great mass at the zero point from which no light may be seen. (B2, 20) II. IN THE BLACK HOLE ALL CONTAINED WITHIN UNITES WITH THE CREATOR QUESTION: Then the black hole is a point at which the environmental material has succeeded in uniting with the Creator. Is this correct? RA: The black hole which manifests in 3rd density is the physical complex manifestation of this spiritual or metaphysical state. That is correct. (B2, 20-21) III. IT BECOMES A GREAT CENTRAL SUN QUESTION: The white light contains the experiences through all the densities. As we go into the 8th density we go into a black hole which becomes, on the other side, another logos or sun and starts another octave of experience. Can you comment on this? (B2, 78) RA The blackness of the black hole, metaphysically speaking. Is a concentration of white light being systematically absorbed once again into the One Creator. Finally, this absorption into the One Creator continues until all the infinity of creations have attained sufficient spiritual mass in order that all form once again. The great central sun if you would so imagine it, of the intelligent infinity awaiting potentiation by free will- Thus the transition of the octave is a process which may be seen to enter into timelessness of unimaginable nature. To attempt to measure it by your time measures would be useless. Therefore the concept of moving through the black hole of the ultimate spiritual gravity well and coming immediately into the next octave misses the subconcept of this process which is timelessness. (B2, 79) IV. WHAT IS SPIRITUAL MASS ?"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"RA Spiritual mass is that which begins to attract the out-moving and on-going vibratory oscillations of being-ness into the gravity well of the great central sun, core, or Creator of the infinite universes. (B2, 69-70) MOVES WITHIN THE GAME: APPARENT CHANGES A. CHANGES IN PLANET EARTH 21. THE COMING EARTH CHANGES I. OUR DISHARMONY AFFECTS THE EARTH RA: W hen an entire planetary system of peoples and cultures repeatedly experiences disharmony on a great scale, the earth under the feet of these entities shall begin to resonate with this disharmony. (B3, 68) [Note: This has long been understood in the teachings of the Ancient East. Typhoons, hurricanes and earthquakes were seen as being caused by the disharmony of the people.] RA: In the event of mixed harvest there is nearly always disharmony and therefore, added catalyst in the form of your so-called \"Earth changes”. It is the Confederation's desire to serve those who may indeed seek more intensely because of this added catalyst. We do not seek for the success of added numbers to the harvest for this would not be appropriate. We are servants. If we are called, we shall serve with all our strength. To count the numbers is without virtue. (B3, 109) (i.e., remain detached from the outcome.) II. EARTH WILL HAVE BECOME A 4 TH DENSITY PLANET BY APPROXIMATELY 2011 RA: This sphere... has not made an easy transition to the vibrations which beckon. Therefore, it will be fetched with some inconvenience... This inconvenience, or disharmonious vibratory complex, [i.e. the disharmony of the peoples creating Earth Changes] has begun several of your years in your past. It shall continue unabated for a period of approximately thirty of your years. QUESTION: In 30 years this will be a 4th density planet. Is this correct? (1981 + 30 = 2011) RA: This is so. (B1, 93) [This session was held in Jan. 1981.] QUESTION: Our planetary population has only a certain amount of time to progress. This time is divided into three 25,000-year cycles. At the end of 75,000 years the planet progresses itself. W hy is this so precise? RA: The living flow creates a rhythm which is as inevitable as one of your timepieces. Intelligent energy offers a type of clock. The gateway from intelligent energy to intelligent infinity opens regardless of circumstance on the striking of the hour. (B1, 105) [Note: Refer to Convergence II and Convergence III for specific information regarding the scientific validity of these statements from Ra. The time cycles they discuss are very real and very observable, and the date of approximately 2011 is well in sync with the Mayan Calendar, an ancient and highly accurate cycle measurement system.] III. EARTH ITSELF IS MOVING INTO A HIGHER VIBRATIONAL PATTERN RA: The 4th density is a vibrational spectrum. Your time/space continuum has spiraled your solar system into this vibration. This will cause the planet itself to electromagnetically realign its vortices of reception of the in-streaming of cosmic forces expressing themselves as vibrational webs so that"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"the Earth will be 4th density magnetized. This is going to occur with some inconvenience due to the energy of the thought-forms of your peoples which disturb the orderly constructs of energy patterns within your Earth's spirals of energy which increases entropy and unusable heat. This will cause your planet to have some ruptures in its outer garment while making it appropriately magnetized for 4th density. Those who remain in 4th density on Earth will be of positive orientation. (B1, l60) QUESTION: Is there a clock-like face, shall I say, associated with the entire galaxy so that as it revolves it carries all of those stars and planetary systems through transitions from density to density? Is that how it works? (B3, 95) RA: You are perceptive. You may imagine a 3-dimensional clock face superimposed on space or a spiral of endlessness which is planned by the Logos for this purpose. (B3, 95) [Note: In other words, the background “zero-point” energy that makes up all of the Universe has different levels of density, which we interpret as different dimensions. The energy vibrates in harmonic resonance. There is a stationary and a moving component to this vibration. The stationary component would be represented by the “three-dimensional clock face” that Ra is referring to here; a highly stable, harmonic “standing wave” created by the Galaxy’s very existence. The moving component would be the stars and planets themselves. As they pass through different areas of density within the “standing wave” of harmonic zero-point energy, their density levels will also shift accordingly. This moving component also occurs in very precise harmonic intervals of time, which Ra refers to as 25,000-year cycles and which Wilcock has demonstrated as existing on an integrated, galaxy-wide level.] RA: This material world is transformed by the spirit into that which is infinite and eternal. (B4, 53) IV. HOW LONG ARE THESE CYCLES? RA: One major cycle is approximately 25,000 of your years. (B1, 92) [Note: The easiest physical method of measuring this cycle is through a natural wobble in the Earth’s axis known as precession, which takes about 25,920 years to complete. This wobble appears to be ultimately controlled by the Solar System’s passage through changing energetic density / stress areas.] RA: There are 3 cycles of this nature. Those who have progressed sufficiently may be harvested at the end of any of these 3 major cycles. After this is completed (75,000 years) all are harvested regardless of their progress, for during that time the planet itself has moved through the useful part of that dimension and begins to cease being useful for the lower levels of vibration within that density. (B1, 93) V. THE 20-DEGREE SHIFT OF THE PLANETARY AXIS AT CYCLE COMPLETION QUESTION: When the planetary axis realigns, will it realign 20 degrees east of north to conform to the green vibration? (B3, 63) RA: There is every indication that this will occur. We cannot speak of certainties. (B3, 64) (No other clarification is given about this at this point.) 22. THE HARVEST OF PLANET EARTH I. WHAT ABOUT THE HARVEST 50,000 YEARS AGO (the end of the 1st cycle) RA: There was none. (B1, 138) II. WHAT ABOUT THE HARVEST 25,000 YEARS AGO (the end of the 2nd cycle) RA: The harvest at that time was extremely small and consisted of those entities of extreme distortion towards service toward those who would be repeating the major cycle. (B1, 138)"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"STATEMENT: Then these entities who could have been harvested into the 4th density chose to remain here in service to the planetary population. RA: That is correct. There were harvestable entities who chose the manner of their entrance into the 4th dimension. (B1, 138) QUESTION: In the 2 nd 25,000 year major cycle was there any great civilization that developed? (B1, 196) RA: None became great as the greatness of Lemuria or Atlantis. However, in the South American region there grew to be a great vibratory distortion towards love. These entities were harvestable at the end of the 2nd major cycle without having ever formed strong social or technological complexes. (B1, 196) QUESTION: What was the lifespan of these entities, and what was the world population then? RA: The lifetime of these entities was about 900 years. The population of Earth at that time was about 345,000 entities. (B1, 198) QUESTION: How many of this number were harvestable? RA: Approximately 150. QUESTION: These were the ones who stayed to work on the planet. Correct? RA: That is correct. They were visited by the Confederation and became desirous of staying in order to aid the planetary consciousness. (B1, 199) QUESTION: What type of visit was this? RA: A light being appeared bearing what might be called a shield of light. It spoke of the oneness and infinity of all creation and of those things that await those ready for harvest. It described in golden words the beauties of love as lived. It then showed those who were interested the plight of 3rd density when seen as a planetary complex. It then left. And all these entities stayed. (B1, 199) QUESTION: Are any of these entities names that we would know from our historical past? RA: Saint Augustine, Saint Teresa, Saint Francis of Assisi. (B1, 199) III. WHAT WAS THE REACTION OF THE CONFEDERATION TO THIS ? RA: We became concerned. We allowed entry of other entities, not Wanderers, into 3rd density. This was done randomly so that free will would not be violated for there was not yet a call. (B1, 200) QUESTION: When was the first call for help sent out? RA: The first calling was that of the Atlanteans in a time before they became technologically advanced. At about the time when we first appeared in the skies over Egypt, other entities of the Confederation appeared unto Atlanteans. (B1, 200) QUESTION: What conditions were necessary for these visitations to occur? RA: There were two: (1) the calling by those whose square overcame the resistance of those unwilling to search or learn. (2) the relative naiveté of those members of the Confederation who felt that transfer of information to the Atlanteans would be as helpful to them as it had been for the Confederation entity. We remind you that we were one of the naive members of the Confederation and are still trying to recoup the damage for which we feel responsibility. (B1, 201) QUESTION: This turned out to be a mistake because it was perverted by the Atlanteans. Is this correct? RA: This is correct. IV. WHAT IS THE DENSITY LEVEL OF PLANET EARTH NOW ? RA: Your planet is 3rd density in the beingness of its peoples, but the planet is now in a 4th density space/time continuum. (B1, 133) V. HOW DOES A 3RD DENSITY PLANET BECOME A 4TH DENSITY PLANET? "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"RA. The 4th density is as regularized in its approach as the striking of a clock upon the hour. Your planetary sphere has spiraled into space/time of a different vibrational configuration. This causes the planetary sphere to be molded by these new distortions. However, the thought-forms of your people vary greatly and are not able to point in one direction. Thus the harvest will be such that many will repeat the 3rd density cycle. The energies of your W anderers, your teachers, and your adepts at this time are all bent upon increasing the harvest. However there are few to harvest. (B1, 133) [Note: Elsewhere Ra tells us that even in the harvest of Venus, a highly positive third- density planet, only 20% of the population graduated.] RA: The harvest is now. There is at this time no reason to aim for longevity, but rather to encourage efforts toward seeking the heart of the self, for this which resides clearly in the violet-ray energy field will determine the harvesting of each person. (B1, 138) RA: You must see the Earth as being 7 planets. There is red, orange, yellow, and there will soon be a completed green color vibratory locus for 4th density entities which they will call Earth. DURING THE 4TH DENSITY EXPERIENCE, THE 3RD DENSITY SPHERE IS NOT USEFUL FOR HABITATION, (presumably by 3rd density beings) because the early 4th density entity will not know precisely how to remain undetectable by 3rd density. Thus in 4th density the red, orange and green energy nexi (centers) of your planet will be activated while the yellow is in potentiation along with blue and indigo. (B3, 86) VI. THE UPCOMING HARVEST INTO 4TH DENSITY A. EARTH WILL BECOME 4TH DENSITY POSITIVE QUESTION: The Earth seems to be negative. So why will Earth go into 4th density positive instead of 4th density negative? RA: For those of harvestable quality, those oriented in the ways of service to others greatly outnumber those whose orientation is toward service to self. (B1, 166) B. WHO GOES WHERE? QUESTION: As we enter the 4th density there will be a 3 way split. (B1, 151) (1) Harvestable entities of positive polarity will remain for 4th density experience on this planet (2) Harvestable entities of negative polarity going to another 4th density planet (3) Unharvestable entities going to another 3rd density planet. Is this correct? (B3, 89) RA: This is correct but the positively oriented harvestable entities will remain in this planetary influence but not upon this plane. (B3, 89-90) C. THERE IS NO LOSS QUESTION: What will we lose as the yellow goes from activation into potentiation and what will we gain as green comes into total activation? RA: It is misleading to speak of gains and losses. It is to be kept in the forefront of your thinking that there is one creation in which there is no loss. (B3, 89) D. INCOMPATIBILITY OF 3RD AND 4TH DENSITY ELECTRICAL FIELDS RA: If a 3rd density entity were electrically aware of 4th density in full, the 3rd density electrical fields would fail due to incompatibility. (B3, 90) (Remember that many bodily systems, especially the nervous system, are electrical in nature.) VII. ALL BODIES ON EARTH THAT ARE STILL PHYSICAL MUST BE VACATED (\"DIE”) BEFORE THOSE BEINGS CAN INHABIT THE 4TH DENSITY EARTH"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"QUESTION: As this transition continues into 4th density activation, in order to inhabit this 4th density earth it will be necessary for all 3rd density physical bodies to go through the process which we refer to as death. Is this correct? (B3, 92) RA: This is correct. [NOTE: If the physical body has been transitioned into light body, then there is no physical body present and no \"death process\" to go through. Certain highly advanced souls may be able to attain this at the point of cycle completion. Through Wilcock, Ra further revealed that there will be an ET-assisted transition off of the Earth plane prior to the 20-degree polar realignment. This highly joyful and even ecstatic transition will not seem like death at all, even though the time of 3 rd density incarnation will come to a natural and unseen end along the way.] VIII. THE CONDITION FOR BEING HARVESTABLE A. OVER 51% SERVICE TO OTHERS, LESS THAN 50% SERVICE TO SELF QUESTION: The book Oahspe says that if an entity is over 51% service to others and less than 50% service to self, then the entity is harvestable for the positive 4th dimensional level. RA: This is correct. The negative path is quite difficult for attaining harvestability and requires great dedication. TO BE HARVESTABLE IN THE NEGATIVE ORIENTATION REQUIRES AT LEAST 95% SERVICE TO SELF and 5% service to others. (B1, 167) QUESTION: Does this mean these two percentages for the positive and negative path yield the same rate of vibration? RA: The vibratory rates are not to be understood as the same in the positive and negative orientations. They are to be understood as having the power to accept and work with intelligent infinity to a certain degree or intensity. Neither the blue or green vibratory energies are seen in the vibratory patterns of negative 4th and 5th rates of vibration. On the other hand, the positive entity has the full spectrum of true color time/space vibratory patterns. Each is capable of doing 4th density work. This is the criteria for harvest. (B2, 112) B. ENERGY BALANCE IS NEEDED RA; The brilliance or rotational speed of the energy centers is not as important for harvestability as the balanced aspect or violet ray manifestation of an entity; for those entities which are unbalanced, especially as to the primary rays (red, yellow and blue) will not be capable of sustaining the impact of the love and light of intelligent infinity to the extent necessary for harvest. (B2, 90) - also see (B2,92) QUESTION: Is each chakra activated to completion and greatest intensity by the end of the experience of each density? RA: Hypothetically speaking, this is correct. However, the fully activated being is rare. IT IS NECESSARY FOR GRADUATION ACROSS DENSITIES FOR THE PRIMARY ENERGY CENTERS TO BE FUNCTIONING IN SUCH A W AY AS TO COMMUNICATE W ITH INTELLIGENT INFINITY AND TO APPRECIATE AND BASK IN THIS LIGHT IN ALL ITS PURITY. However, to fully activate each energy center is the mastery of the few, for each center has a variable speed of rotation or activity. The important observation to be made once all necessary centers are activated to the minimal necessary degree is the harmony and balance between these energy centers. (B2, 80) C. AWARENESS OF THE LAW OF ONE IS NOT NEEDED FOR HARVEST INTO 4TH DENSITY"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"QUESTION: It is not necessary for an entity to be consciously aware of the Law of One to go from 3rd to 4th density. Is this correct? (B1, 157) RA: That is correct. D. FOR WHICH HARVEST IS AWARENESS OF THE LAW OF ONE NEEDED? QUESTION: At what point in the densities is it necessary for an entity to be consciously aware of the law of One in order to progress? RA: The 5th density harvest is of those whose vibratory distortions consciously accept the honor/duty of the Law of One. (B1, 157) IX. WILL JESUS RETURN TO EARTH ? QUESTION: Will Jesus return to Earth (the 2nd coming)? RA: The particular mind/body/spirit complex you call Jesus will not return except as a member of the Confederation speaking through a channel. However there are others of the identical congruency of consciousness that will welcome those to the 4th density. This is the meaning of the 2nd coming. (B1, 165) X. WILL ANYONE GO TO A 4TH DENSITY NEGATIVE TYPE PLANET? RA: There is a possibility of a small harvest of this type. (B1, 117) QUESTION: Has anyone well known in our history gone to a 4th density negative type planet? RA: Yes, but the number is small. A few have penetrated the 8th level (while in 3rd density). QUESTION: What are some specific examples? (B1, 117) RA: Taras Bulba, Genghis Khan and Rasputin. They were aware, through memory of Atlantean understandings involving use of the various centers of mind/body/spirit complex energy influx in attaining the gateway to intelligent infinity. (B1, 118) QUESTION. Could they do paranormal things (magic)? RA. That is correct. They were bent single mindedly upon service to self, sparing no efforts in personal discipline to empower this gateway. (B1, 118) XI. WHAT TYPE OF BEINGS WILL LIVE ON THE PLANET AFTER THE HARVEST ? A. WILL 4TH DENSITY BEINGS BE INCARNATE ON THE PLANET? RA: The probability/possibility vortices indicate this to be most likely. (B2, 105) B. WILL ANY 5TH DENSITY ENTITIES BE ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET? RA: Not for a fairly long measure of your time as 4th density beings need to spend their learning and teaching time with their own density's entities. (B2, 105) RA: 5th density beings will not live on the surface of the planetary sphere until the planet reaches 5th density vibratory level. (B2, 106) XII. RA WORKS TO INCREASE EARTH'S HARVEST A. WHY DOES RA WORK WITH EARTH? QUESTION: For the last 2300 years you have been working to create as large a harvest as possible at the end of the 75,000-year cycle. Why have you done this? RA: We came among you to aid you about 11,000 years ago to aid you but our efforts toward service were distorted. Our desire is to eliminate as far as possible the distortions caused by those misreading our information. The One Being of the creation is like a body. Would one ignore a pain in the leg? (B1, 139) B. DOES RA WORK WITH ANY OTHER PLANETS BESIDES EARTH? RA: We work only with this planet at this time. (B1, 139) C. HOW MANY PEOPLE CALL ON YOU NOW? (1981) RA: Approximately 352,000. (B1, 139) D. HOW DOES RA PERFORM SERVICE? RA: We have used channels such as this one, but usually they just feel inspired by their dreams. (B1, 140)"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"QUESTION: When you contact people in their dreams or otherwise, they first have to be seeking in the direction of the Law of One. Is that correct? RA: That is correct. (B1, 140) 23. THE HARVEST OF VENUS I. OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE QUESTION: I am guessing that before 3rd density was completed Ra, being polarized positively, probably had some difficulty in that the negative polarity was not appreciated. Is that correct? (B4, 129) RA: Our harvest was overwhelmingly positive and our appreciation of those which were negative was relatively uninformed. Although there was no negative, planetary harvest as such, there were two entities which harvested themselves during the 3rd density in the service-to-self path. (B4, 129) QUESTION: What was the average total population of Venus in 3rd density? RA: We were a small population which dwelt upon what you would consider difficult conditions. It was a harshly bright planet in the physical sense. Our harvest was approximately 6.5 million mind/body/spirit complexes out of a total population of 38.5 million. Those of us which had the gift of polarity felt deep compassion for those who seemed to dwell in darkness. To those who wish to sleep we could only offer those comforts designed for the sleeping. SERVICE IS ONLY POSSIBLE TO THE EXTENT IT IS REQUESTED. (B4, 129) II. ONLY TWO HARVESTABLE NEGATIVE ENTITIES QUESTION: What techniques did the two negatively harvested entities use for negative polarization upon such a positively polarized planet? (B4, 130) RA: The technique of control over others and domination unto the physical death was used. On a planetary influence much unused to slaughter these entities were able to polarize by these means. You would call these two entities ruthless dictators or despots who waged holy war. (B4, 130) III. PREVIOUSLY THE TWO WERE POSITIVELY ORIENTED WANDERERS QUESTION: What was the origin of these two entities? RA: These entities were Wanderers from early positive 5th density. (B4, 130) QUESTION: And though they had already evolved through a positive 4th density, they switched polarity when they reincarnated into 3rd density. Is this correct? (B4, 131) RA: That is correct. IV. CATALYST FOR THEIR SWITCH: OVERABUNDANCE OF LOVE QUESTION: What was the catalyst for their change? RA: From their viewpoint of wisdom there was an overabundance of love on Venus. These two entities looked at those still in darkness on Venus and saw many who found such harmony sickening. The Wanderers felt a more wisdom oriented way of seeking love could be more appealing to those in darkness. These entities had agreed to serve together and so they did, glorifying the One Creator, but not as they intended. The end of this was the graduation of the two Wanderers into 4th density negative. (B4, 131)"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"QUESTION: I'm guessing that these Wanderers entered Ra’s 3 rd density to seed greater wisdom in what they saw as an overabundance of compassion in the Ra culture. Is this correct? (B4, 131-132) RA: This is incorrect. Before the incarnation it was the desire of these Wanderers only to aid in service to others. (B4, 132) – [Childers: In replying that the questioner is incorrect, it seems that Ra misunderstood the question (or I’m missing something) because Ra’s comment seems to be saying the same thing as the questioner said. [Wilcock: To me it seems clear that wisdom can be taught from the positive polarity or the negative, for very different reasons. These entities were fourth-density and thus they did not possess the knowledge of wisdom prior to incarnation. Their original desire to teach service to others was corrupted during physical incarnation.] QUESTION: I can’t understand why they thought Venus needed help with harvest when it was doing so well. RA: Wanderers are always drawn to whatever percentage has not yet polarized and come when there is a call. There was a call from those which were not positively polarized but which sought to be positively polarized and sought wisdom, feeling the compassion of other-selves upon Venus as complacent or pitying towards otherselves. (B4, 32) V. THESE TWO EVENTUALLY RETURNED TO POSITIVE POLARITY QUESTION: What was the attitude of these two entities after they graduated into 4th density negative and realized they had switched polarities? (B4, 132) RA: They were disconcerted. QUESTION: What happened to them? RA: They worked with the 4th density negative for some period until within this framework, the previously learned patterns of the self had been recaptured and the polarity was, with great effort, reversed. There was a great deal of 4th density positive work then to be retraced. (B4, 132) QUESTION: How is Ra aware of this information? RA: These entities joined Ra in 4th density positive for a portion of the cycle which we experienced. (B4, 133) B. GROW ING 24- SPIRITUAL GROWTH I. MUCH MORE PROGRESS CAN BE MADE HERE THAN IN BETWEEN INCARNATIONS QUESTION: Is it correct that entities can accelerate their growth much more while in the 3rd density than in between incarnations of this density? RA: This is correct. (The reason is that one can work within the framework of the two primal distortions of the law of One.) In 3rd density each entity is free to accept, reject or ignore others about it. Yet here there are many who practice the ways of love. If, in addition to this, an entity chooses to accept responsibility for each moment of experience, then this empowers its progress. (B1, 113) II. THE HEART OF THE MATTER QUESTION: Is there anything of importance for spiritual growth on the service-to-others path other than knowledge of self, disciplines of personality and strengthening the will? RA: This is technique. This is not the heart. Let us remember that we are all one. This is the great learning and teaching. In this unity lies love. In this unity lies light. This is the fundamental teaching of all planes of existence in materialization: unity, love, light and joy. The 2nd ranking lessons are in meditation and service. (B3, 16)"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"III. WHAT ARE SOME EXERCISES TO PERFORM ? (B1, 114) RA: EXERCISE 1: REALIZE THAT THE MOMENT CONTAINS LOVE. THAT IS THE LESSON OF THIS DENSITY. CONSCIOUSLY SEE THAT LOVE IN AW ARENESS AND IN UNDERSTANDING DISTORTIONS. EXERCISE 2: THE UNIVERSE IS ONE BEING. W HEN YOU VIEW ANOTHER, SEE THE CREATOR. EXERCISE 3: GAZE W ITHIN A MIRROR. SEE THE CREATOR. EXERCISE 4: GAZE AT THE CREATION, W HICH LIES ABOUT THE MIND/BODY/SPIRIT OF EACH ENTITY. SEE THE CREATOR. The foundation for these exercises is meditation, contemplation or prayer. With this attitude these exercises can be processed. Without it, the data will not sink down into the roots of the tree mind, thus enabling and ennobling the body and touching the spirit. (B1, 114) IV. THE MYSTERY OF THE ONE RA: Gaze at the stunning mystery of the One Infinite Creator. Behold the glory, the majesty, the mystery and the peace of oneness. Let no consideration of bird or beast, darkness or light, shape or shadow keep any which seeks from the central consideration of unity. (B4, 194) RA: (Yet) no source which is of the 3rd density will resolve all paradoxes or bring all into unity. (B4, 194) V. THE BEST SERVICE QUESTION: What are some of the \"best ways\" for being of service to others? RA: The best way of service to others is the constant attempt to seek to share the love of the Creator as it is known to the inner self. This involves self-knowledge and the ability to OPEN THE SELF TO THE OTHER W ITHOUT HESITATION AND RADIATE THAT W HICH IS THE ESSENCE, OR THE HEART. (B1, 166-167) QUESTION: What is the greatest service that our population could perform individually? RA: There is but one service. The Law is One. The offering of self to Creator is the greatest service, the fountainhead. (B1, 43) VI. DISTILL THE LOVE AND LIGHT IN EACH EXPERIENCE RA: The proper role of the entity in this density is to experience all things desired and then to analyze understand and ACCEPT ALL EXPERIENCES, DISTILLING FROM THEM THE LOVE/LIGHT WITHIN THEM. THAT WHICH IS NOT NEEDED FALLS AWAY. (B1, 169-170) VII. BECOME AWARE OF THE OTHER AS BEING THE SAME AS YOURSELF RA: We suggest that you attempt to become aware of the other-self as self. Become aware of the intelligent energy expressed in nature and expressed in self-love shared when appropriate. (B1, l71)"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"VIII. WHY IS THERE MALE AND FEMALE ? QUESTION: Bisexual reproduction begins in 2nd density. What is the idea behind this? RA: The 2nd density is one in which the groundwork is being laid for 3rd density work. The mechanism of reproduction capitulates in 3rd density into a vast potential for service to others and to one's self. Many types of energy transfer occur. Those who are magnetically attracted, one to the other, have opportunities for many types of service which would be unavailable to the independent entity. (B2, 28) QUESTION: So, the basic reason for having bisexual reproduction was to increase the opportunity of the experience of the One Creator? Is that correct? RA: That is not merely correct but is the key to that which occurs in all densities. (B2, 28) IX. UNLEARNED LESSONS WILL BE REPEATED RA: If one opportunity is missed, another will appear until the student of the life experience grasps that a lesson is being offered and undertakes to learn it. (B2, 46) X. PERPETUAL CHILDHOOD RA: The greater preponderance of your entities find themselves in what may be considered a perpetual childhood. (B1, 188) XI. DEFENSES QUESTION: Even 4th density positive has the concept of defensive action, but above the level of 4th density the concept of defensive action is not in use. Both offensive and defensive actions occur frequently in our present density. If an entity is polarized strongly enough in his thought in a positive sense, defensive action is not going to be necessary for him because the opportunity to apply defensive action will never originate for him. Is that correct? (B2, 47) RA: This is unknowable. An entity able to program experiences may choose the number and the intensity of the lessons to be learned. It is possible that an extremely positively oriented entity might program for itself situations testing the ability of the self to refrain from defensive action even to the point of physical death of self or other-self. This is an intensive lesson, and it is not known what entities have programmed for themselves. We may, if we desire, read this programming. However, this is an infringement and we choose not to do so. (B2, 47) XII. THE ROLE OF LIGHT, THE 'UPWARD' SPIRALING LIGHT RA: The term \"upward spiraling light\" does not mean moving upward in the usual sense; it refers to that which reaches toward the source of love and light. (B3, 61) QUESTIONER: I assume that from all points in space light radiates in our illusion in a 360-degree solid angle and this scoop shape with the pyramid is like a focusing mechanism. Is this correct? RA: This is precisely correct. (B3, 61) STATEMENT: The adept sees or visualizes the light moving downward from the crown chakra down to the feet. Ra has stated that the Creator enters from the feet and moves upward, that this spiraling light enters from the feet and moves upward. (B3, 170) RA: The upward spiraling light developed in its path by the will, and ultimately reaches a high place of mating with the inward fire of the One Creator Even so, this is still only preparation for the work upon the mind/body/spirit which may be done by the adept. (B3, 172) XIII. DESIRE, WILL AND POLARITY ARE THE KEYS QUESTION: Desire and will are the important factors in this process. Is this correct? RA: We would add one other quality. In the magical personality desire will and polarity are the keys. (B3, 172) XIV. THE PROBLEM WITH THE EVANGELISTS’ METHODS"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"QUESTION: Many so-called evangelists have great desire and very great will. and possibly great polarity. But it seems that in many cases there is a lack of awareness that creates a less than effective working in the magical sense. Is this correct? (B3, 172) RA: You are partially correct. But free will must be seen as paramount in examining the polarity of a service-to-others working. Those entities you speak of are attempting to generate positive changes in consciousness while abridging free will. This causes the blockage of the magical nature of the working except in those cases wherein an entity freely desires to accept the working of the evangelist. (B3, 172) V. THE ADEPT RA: THE ADEPT IS ONE W HICH HAS FREED ITSELF MORE AND MORE FROM THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE THOUGHTS, OPINIONS AND BONDS OF OTHER SELVES. Whether this is done for service to others or for service to self it is a necessary part of the awakening of the adept. This freedom is seen by those not free as what you would call evil or black. The magic is recognized; the nature is often not. (B4, 50) RA: In service-to-others there is an association with the heart of all other selves and a disassociation from the illusory husks which prevent the adept (or anyone else) from correctly perceiving the self and other-selves as one. (B4, 51) QUESTION: The positively or negatively polarized adept is building a potential to draw directly on the spirit for power, is this correct? RA: It would be more proper to say that the adept is calling directly through the spirit to the universe for its power, for the spirit is a shuttle. (B4, 51) XVI. DREAMS AS A TOOL FOR SPIRITUAL GROWTH A. UNCONSCIOUS MIND DOESN'T USE WORDS RA: The nature of the unconscious is of the nature of concept rather than word. (B4, 97) B. CLUES FOR REMOVING BLOCKS QUESTION: You have stated that dreaming, if made available to the conscious mind, will aid greatly in polarization. Could you say how it does this? RA: Dreaming is an activity of communication through the veil between the unconscious mind and the conscious mind. In one who is blocked at two of the three lower energy centers the dreaming will aid polarization because there will be a repetition of recent catalyst, as well as deeper blockages, thereby giving the waking mind clues to the nature of these blockages. (B4, 97) QUESTION: In remembering dreams, an individual can find specific clues to current energy center blockages and may, thereby, reduce or eliminate these blockages. Is this correct? RA: That is correct. (B4, 99) C. THE ADEPT’S MOST USEFUL TOOL IF THE HELP OF GUIDES IS REQUESTED RA: Dreaming becomes the most efficient tool for polarization when three things happen: (1) one consciously chooses the path of the adept (or spiritual seeker) and (2) each energy center is balanced at least to a minimum degree, and (3) one begins to open the indigo-ray (psychic) center. If it is known by the adept that work may be done in consciousness while the so-called conscious mind rests, this adept may call upon those who guide it, and most of all, the magical personality which is the Higher Self as it moves into the sleeping mode of consciousness. (B4, 98)"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"D. DIRECT HEALING IN THE DREAM STATE RA: The activity of dreaming is ant activity in which there is made a finely wrought and excellently fashioned bridge from conscious to unconscious. In this state the various distortions are healed. Continued lack of this possibility can cause serious problems. (B4, 99) QUESTION: This portion of deep has been called REM. Is this correct? (B4, 100) RA: Yes. XVII. PIERCING THE VEIL: GREEN-RAY ENERGY RA: By far the most vivid and even extravagant opportunities for piercing the veil area result of the interaction of polarized entities. (B4, 77) QUESTION: By what process would two polarized entities attempt to penetrate the veil? RA: The penetration of the veil has its roots in the development of green-ray activity, that all-compassionate love which demands no return. If this path is followed, the higher energy centers shall be activated and crystallized until the adept is born. Within the adept is the potential for dismantling the veil to some extent that all may be seen again as one. The other self is the primary catalyst in this particular path to the piercing of the veil. (B4, 78) RA: The awareness of all as Creator is that which opens the green-ray center. (B4, 82) XVIII. REALIZATION OF THE ONE RA: The seeker seeks the One. THE ONE IS TO BE SOUGHT BY THE BALANCED AND SELF-ACCEPTING SELF W HO IS AW ARE BOTH OF ITS APPARENT DISTORTIONS AND ITS TOTAL PERFECTION. Resting in this balanced awareness, the entity then OPENS THE SELF to the Universe which it is. The light energy of all things may then be attracted by this intense seeking, and wherever the inner seeking meets the attracted cosmic prana, the realization of the One takes place. The purpose of clearing each energy center is to allow that meeting place to occur at the indigo ray vibration, thus making contact with intelligent infinity and dissolving all illusions. Service to others is automatic at the released energy generated by this state of consciousness. (B3, 51) RA: The contact with intelligent infinity is most likely to produce an unspeakable joy in the entity experiencing such contact. (B4, 53) 25. BEING TRULY HELPFUL I. FEEDING THE HUNGRY QUESTION: Many people try to help those who are in need, giving them food if there is hunger as there is now in the African nations, by bringing them medicine when needed. This is creating a vibration that is in harmony with green-ray (love) or 4th density but it is not balanced with the understanding of 5th density that these entities are experiencing catalysts, and a more balanced administration of the needs of the hungry would be to provide them with the learning necessary to reach the sate of awareness of 4th density than it would be to minister to their physical needs at this time. Is this correct? (B2, 96) RA: This is incorrect. TO AN ENTITY WHICH IS STARVING, THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE IS THE FEEDING OF THE BODY."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" You may extrapolate from this. On the other hand, you are correct in your assumption that the green ray response is not as refined as that which has been imbued with wisdom. The wisdom enables the entity to appreciate its contributions to the planetary consciousness by the quality of its being without regard to activity or behavior which expects results on the physical planes. (B2, 96) II. PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIP QUESTION: What type of parent child relationship would aid in the activation of the energy centers from red to violet? (B2, 99) RA: The appropriate teaching device of parents is the open-hearted being-ness of the parent and the total acceptance of the being-ness of the child. There are two things that are especially important in this relationship other than the basic acceptance of the child. (1) Firstly, the experience of whatever means the parent uses to worship and give thanksgiving to the One Infinite Creator should, if possible, be shared with the child entity on a daily basis. (2) Second, the compassion of the parent to child may well be tempered by the use of discipline due to the understanding that the child entity may well learn the biases of service-to-others or service-to-self from the parental other-self. This is the reason that some discipline is appropriate. (B2, 99) III. GIVING SUPPORT IN DIFFICULT TIMES QUESTION: Can you give suggestions regarding the instrument's upcoming hospital experience? RA: We may make one suggestion and leave the remainder with the Creator. It is well for each to realize its self as the Creator. Thusly each may support each including the support of self by humble love of self as Creator. (B3, 188) 26. AN IMPORTANT VARIABLE: POLARITY I. ANALOGOUS TO ELECTRICITY QUESTION: It seems there is an extreme potential in this polarization the same as there is in electricity. In a battery there is a positive and negative pole or terminal. The more you build the charge on either of these, the more the voltage, or potential difference, and the greater the ability to do physical work. Is this a correct analogy? (B1, 182) RA: This is precisely correct. QUESTION. If we have no polarity in electricity, we have no action. If we have no polarity in consciousness, we also have no action or experience. Is this correct? RA: This is correct. The thing that is missing without polarity is the charge. The charge is provided by the individualized entity using the in-pourings and in-streamings of energy by the choices of free will. (B1, 185) QUESTION: To make an analogy, when polarization in the atmosphere occurs to create thunderstorms, lightning, and much activity, this more vivid experience could be likened to the polarization in consciousness which creates the more vivid experience. Is this correct? (B4, 165) RA: Given a disclaimer about the conditions producing the storm, we agree with this analogy. II. THE TURNING POINT RA: There is a turning point, a fulcrum which swings as an entity makes its will to service. If this will and desire is for service-to-others, the corresponding polarity will be activated."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"In the circumstances of this group there are three such wills acting as one with the instrument in the central position of fidelity to service. This is as it must be for the balance of the working and the continuance of the contact. Our vibratory complex is one-pointed in these workings and our will to serve is also of some degree of purity. This has attracted the attention of the polar opposite which you experience. (B3, 165) III. INVOKING OF LIGHT STRENGTH A CONFIGURATION OF FREE W ILL, ONE-POINTED IN SERVICE-TO- OTHERS, ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR THE ALERTING OF A GREAT MASS OF LIGHT STRENGTH. THIS POSITIVE LIGHT STRENGTH, HOW EVER, OPERATES ALSO UNDER FREE W ILL AND MUST BE INVOKED. We could not speak to this and shall not guide you, for the nature of this contact is such that the purity of your free will must, above all things, be preserved. (B3, 165) RA: Those who are upon the service-to-others path may also call upon the light strength in direct proportion to the strength and purity of their will to serve. (B3, 170) IV. SWITCHING BACK FROM NEGATIVE ORIENTATION TO POSITIVE RA: The entity which incarnates into negative space/time will not find it possible to maintain any significant positive polarity as negativity, when pure, is a type of gravity well that pulls everything into it. Thus the entity, while remembering its learned and preferred polarity, must needs make use of the catalyst given and recapitulate the lessons of service to self in order to build up enough polarity in order to cause the potential to occur for reversal of polarization. (B3, 154) V. RELATION BETWEEN HARVESTABILITY AND DEGREE OF POLARIZATION QUESTION: Is it possible to increase polarization without increasing harvestability? RA: In the 3rd density an increase in the serving of others or the serving of self will almost inevitably increase the ability of an entity to enjoy a higher intensity of light. Thus it is almost impossible to polarize without increasing harvestability in 3rd density. In the 5th density harvest, polarization has very little to do with harvestability. (B3, 156) 27. MEDITATION I. KUNDALINI RA The lower energy pole (root chakra) will draw the universal energy into itself from the cosmos. Then it will move upward to be met and reacted to by the positive spiraling energy moving downward from within. The measure of an entity's level of ray activity is the locus where the south pole outer energy has been met by the inner spiraling positive energy. As the entity grows more polarized this locus will move upward. Your peoples call this kundalini. It is the meeting place of cosmic and inner vibratory understanding. (B2, 125) RA: The metaphor of the coiled serpent being called upwards is very appropriate. We are attempting then, as entities of any true color of this octave, to move the meeting place of inner and outer natures further upward along the energy centers. One method of approach is this: Seat within ones self of those experiences which are attracted to the entity through the south pole (root chakra). EACH EXPERIENCE W ILL NEED TO BE OBSERVED, EXPERIENCED, BALANCED, ACCEPTED AND SEATED W ITHIN THE INDIVIDUAL. As the individual grows in self-acceptance and awareness of catalyst, the location of the comfortable seating of these experiences will rise to the new true color entity."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The experience, whatever it may be, will be seated in red ray and considered as to its survival content, etc. Each experience will be sequentially understood by the seeker in terms of: 1. survival (first density) then in terms of 2. personal identity, (second density) then in terms of 3. social relations, (third density) then in terms of 4. universal love, (fourth density) then in terms of 5. how the experience may be linked to universal energies , (fifth and 6. sixth density) and finally in terms of 7. the sacramental nature of each experience (seventh density.) Meanwhile the Creator lies within. In the north pole the crown is already on the head and the entity is potentially a god. The energy is brought into being by the humble and trusting acceptance of this energy through meditation and contemplation of the self and the Creator. where these energies meet is where the serpent will have achieved its height. (B2, 125-126) II. TWO OTHER TYPES OF MEDITATION QUESTION: In meditation is it best to leave the mind as blank as possible and let it run down or is it better to focus on some object for concentration? (B2, 126) RA: Each type is useful for a particular reason. (B2, 127) A. QUIETING THE MIND RA: The passive mediation involving clearing the mind, the emptying of the mental jumble, is useful for those who wish to achieve an inner silence as a base from which to listen to the Creator. (B2, 127) B. VISUALIZATION = THE TOOL OF THE ADEPT RA: The other type of meditation which may be called visualization has a different goal. It is the tool of the adept. Those who learn to hold visual images in mind are developing an inner concentrative power that can transcend boredom and discomfort. W hen the ability has become crystallized, one can effect planetary consciousness. Only those wishing to pursue the conscious raising of planetary consciousness will find visualization particularly satisfying. (B2, 127) RA: The key is first silence, and secondly, singleness of thought. Thusly a visualization which can be held steady to the inward eye for several of your minutes will signal the adept’s increase in singleness of thought. This is done for the purpose of transmuting planetary harvestability. (B2, 130) III. THE MOST POWERFUL CONNECTION RA: When the positive adept touches intelligent infinity from within, this is the most powerful of connections. The adepts become living channels for love and light and are able to channel this radiance directly into the planet's web of energy nexi (or focal points.) The ritual will always end in praise and thanksgiving and the release of this energy into the planetary whole. (B2, 131) IV. SHOULD THE SPINE BE VERTICAL ? QUESTION: Is a vertical positioning of the spine useful or helpful in the meditative procedure? RA: It is somewhat helpful. (B3, 119) 28. ENLIGHTENMENT QUESTION: Is there some way to help an entity to reach 4th density level in these last days?"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"RA: It is impossible to help another being directly. It is only possible to make catalyst available in whatever form, the most important being the radiation of realization of oneness with the Creator from the self, less important being information such as we share with you. We cannot offer short cuts to enlightenment. Enlightenment is of the moment, an opening to intelligent infinity. It can only be accomplished by the self, for the self. Another self cannot teach enlightenment, but only teach/learn information, inspiration, or a sharing of love, of mystery, of the unknown that makes the other-self reach out and begin the seeking process. (B1, 161-162) C. JESUS 29. JESUS, AN ENLIGHTENED HEALER    I. JESUS CAME FROM THE HIGHEST PART OF THE 4TH DENSITY RA: The entity Jesus was a member of 4th density of the highest level of that sub-octave. He desired to enter planetary service in order to share the love vibration in as pure a manner as possible. This entity could have gone onto the 5th density but chose instead to return to 3rd density for this particular mission. (B1, 162) II. THE ORION GROUP OPPOSED HIM QUESTION: When Jesus incarnated was there an attempt by the Orion group to discredit him? RA: This is correct. They built on negative information already present given by the one your peoples call \"Yahweh”. This led Judas to believe that Jesus, if pushed into a corner, could be made to see the wisdom of using the power of intelligent infinity to rule others. This resulted in the death of Jesus. III. WHY WAS JESUS SUCH A GOOD HEALER ? QUESTION: If Jesus was 4th density and there are Wanderers on the planet today who came from 5th and 6th density, what made Jesus such a good healer and could these 5th and 6th density beings here now do the same? (B1, 164) RA: Those who heal may be of any density which has the consciousness of spirit (i.e., 4th through 7th). The gate to intelligent infinity can only be opened when an understanding of the in- streamings of intelligent energy are opened to the healer. True healing is simply the radiance of the self causing an environment in which a catalyst can occur to cause the recognition of the self, by the self. (B1, 164) Jesus first discovered his ability to penetrate intelligent infinity when he became angry at a playmate who was fatally wounded by Jesus's touch. Jesus determined to discover how to use this energy for the good, not for the negative. Jesus was extremely positively polarized and remembered more than most Wanderers do. He was galvanized by this experience and he left his home when he was 13.5 years old and walked to many other places seeking further information. This went on until he was 25, when he returned home. When he became able to integrate and synthesize all experiences, he began to speak to other-selves. He was absolved karmically of the destruction of the otherself when he forgave those who put him to death. In forgiveness lies the stoppage of the wheel of action, of what you call karma. (B1, 164-165) IV. NOW JESUS IS IN 5TH DENSITY QUESTION: In what density is Jesus now? RA: This entity studies now the lessons of the wisdom vibration, the 5th density, also called the light vibration. (B1, 165) V. THE CHOICE TO BE A MARTYR "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"RA: When Jesus decided to return to the location called Jerusalem for the holy days, he turned from work mixing love and wisdom and embraced martyrdom which is the work of love without wisdom. (B3, 185) RA: This entity (Jesus) is aware of certain over-balances towards love, even to martyrdom but has not yet, to any significant degree, balanced these distortions. We do not imply that this course of unbridled compassion has any fault but affirm its perfection. It is an example of love which has served as beacon to many. For those who seek further, the consequences of martyrdom must be considered, for in martyrdom lies the end of the opportunity, in the density of the martyr, to offer light and love. Each entity must seek its deepest path. (B3, 186) RA: Jesus incarnated with the plan of martyrdom. There is no wisdom in this plan but rather understanding and compassion extended to its fullest perfection. (B4, 82) D. HEALING 30. CAN YOU TRAIN US IN HEALING AWARENESS? I. IN GENERAL A. FORGIVENESS REMOVES KARMA QUESTION: You stated that forgiveness removes karma. This includes forgiveness not only of other selves but also forgiveness of self as well. Is this correct? RA: You are correct. Forgiveness of other-self is forgiveness of self. (B1, 73) QUESTION: Would you define karma? RA: Our understanding of karma is that which maybe called inertia. Those actions which are put into motion will continue. The stoppage of the inertia of action may be called forgiveness. (B2, 51) B. DEEP ACCEPTANCE OF THE LAW OF ONE PRODUCES HEALING RA: HEALING OCCURS WHEN A MIND/BODY/SPIRIT COMPLEX REALIZES DEEP WITHIN ITSELF, THE LAW OF ONE; THAT IS, THAT THERE IS NO DISHARMONY, NO IMPERFECTION; THAT ALL IS COMPLETE AND WHOLE AND PERFECT. Then the intelligent infinity within this entity re-forms the illusion of the body, mind or spirit to a form congruent with the Law of One. The healer acts as energizer or catalyst for this completely individual process. (B1, 86) II. THE PRE-REQUISITE FOR MENTAL WORK RA: This is the most demanding part. (B1, 84) RA: THE PREREQUISITE OF THE MENTAL W ORK IS THE ABILITY TO RETAIN SILENCE OF SELF AT A STEADY STATE. The mind must be opened like a door. The key is silence. (B1, 87) III. THE DISCIPLINES OF THE MIND A. 1ST: BALANCE YOUR POLARITIES RA: The polarity of your dimension must be internalized. Where you find patience, find the corresponding impatience and vice versa. Each thought has an opposite. Identify both those things which you approve and those which you disapprove within yourself and then balancing each and every positive and negative charge with its equal. The mind contains all things. Therefore you must discover the completeness within yourself. (B1, 87) B. 2ND: ACCEPT THE COMPLETENESS WITHIN YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"RA: Accept the completeness within your consciousness. It is not for a being of polarity in the physical consciousness to pick and choose among attributes, thus building the roles that cause blockages and confusions in the already distorted mind complex. Each acceptance smoothes part of the many distortions that the faculty you call judgment engenders. (B1, 87-88) C. 3RD: SEE THE COMPLETENESS IN ALL OTHER ENTITIES RA: This is like the 1st discipline but with the emphasis on your gaze outward toward the fellow entities that you meet (i.e., how you see your brother). In each entity there exists completeness. Thus the ability to understand each balance is necessary. When you view patience, you are responsible for mirroring in your mental understandings, patience/impatience, and vice versa. (B1, 88) D. THE 4TH MENTAL DISCIPLINE RA: This one is the acceptance of the other-self polarities. (B1, 88) E. THE 5TH MENTAL DISCIPLINE RA: This involves observing the geographical and geometrical relationships and ratios of the mind, the other mind, the mass mind and the infinite mind. (B1, 88) IV. THE DISCIPLINES OF THE BODY A. BALANCE LOVE AND WISDOM RA: In the streamings reaching your planet at this time, these understandings and disciplines have to do with the balance between love and wisdom in the use of the body in its natural functions. (B1, 84) QUESTION: In the healing exercises concerning the body, what do you mean by the disciplines of the body in the balance between love and wisdom? RA: There are natural bodily functions having to do wit the other-self, i.e., touching, loving, the sexual life, craving company to combat bodily loneliness. Find, in these functions, your love for yourself and also your love for the other. Observe the love of self and the love of other self in contrast to wisdom regarding the use of natural functions. There are many fantasies and stray thoughts which may be examined in this balancing process. (B3, 74-75) B. UNDERSTAND BOTH POLARITIES RA: It is necessary to know your body well. How the emotions affect different parts of the body. Understand and accept the bodily polarity. The body is a creature of the mind’s creation. It has its biases. The biological bias must be first completely understood, and then allow the opposite bias to find full expression in understanding. The simplest example is that each biological male is female, and vice versa. (B1, 88) C. TRANSMUTE NATURAL FUNCTIONS TO SACREDNESS RA: Imagine the body. Imagine the more dense, i.e., more obvious, aspects of the body. Proceed from there to the very finest knowledge of energy pathways which revolve and cause the body to be energized. Understand that all natural functions of the body have all aspects from dense to fine, and can be transmuted to what you may call sacramental. (B1, 85) V. THE THIRD AREA IS THE SPIRITUAL A. CONTACT INTELLIGENT INFINITY RA: In this area the first two disciplines are connected through the attainment of contact with intelligent infinity. (B1, 85) B. INTEGRATE THE UPWARD YEARNING WITH THE DOWNPOURING OF DIVINE ENERGY RA: Consider a magnet. It has two poles. One reaches up, the other down."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"THE FUNCTION OF SPIRIT IS TO INTEGRATE THE UP-REACHING YEARNING OF THE MIND/BODY ENERGY W ITH THE DOW N-POURING INSTREAMING OF INFINITE INTELLIGENCE. (B1, 85) The spiritual complex embodies fields of force and consciousness which ate the least distorted of your mind/body/spirit complex. This is the longest and most subtle part of your learning IT IS THE W ORK OF W IND AND FIRE. THE SPIRITUAL BODY ENERGY FIELD IS A PATHW AY OR CHANNEL. When body and mind are receptive and open, then the spirit can become a functioning shuttle or communicator from the entity's individual energy/will upwards, and from the streamings of the creative fire and wind downwards. (B1, 89) C. REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE RA: EACH ENTITY IS THE CREATOR. The entity, as it becomes more and more conscious of itself gradually comes to the turning point at which it determines to seek either in service to others or in service to self. The seeker becomes the adept when it has balanced with minimal adequacy the appropriate energy centers, red, orange, yellow, and blue, with the addition of green for the positive, thus moving into indigo work The adept then begins to do less of the preliminary or outer work having to do with function, and begins to effect the inner work which has to do with being. AS THE ADEPT BECOMES A MORE AND MORE CONSCIOUSLY CRYSTALLIZED ENTITY IT GRADUALLY MANIFESTS MORE AND MORE OF THAT W HICH IT ALW AYS HAS BEEN SINCE BEFORE TIME; THAT IS, THE ONE INFINITE CREATOR. (B3, 192-193) VI A SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW OF THESE DISCIPLINES QUESTION: The disciplines of the personality are the paramount work of any who have become consciously aware of the process of evolution. Is this correct? RA: Quite. The heart of the discipline of the personality is threefold. (1) One, know your self. (2) Two, accept your self. (3) Three, become the Creator. The 3rd step, when accomplished, renders one the most humble servant of all, transparent in personality and completely able to know and accept other-selves. To become the Creator is to become all that there is. THEN THERE IS NO PERSONALITY OF THE TYPE THE ADEPT HAD W HEN IT BEGINS ITS LEARNING. As the consciousness of the indigo ray becomes more crystalline, more work may be done; more may be expressed from intelligent infinity. (B3, 181-182) 31. HEALING I THE TWO BASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR HEALING A. FORGIVENESS OF OTHERS AND FORGIVENESS OF SELF RA. You may observe the thoughts of anger becoming those cells of the physical bodily complex going out of control to become what you call cancer. (B2, 81) QUESTION: Are you saying that cancer is quite easily healed mentally and once the entity forgives the other-self at whom he is angry, the cancer will disappear? RA: This is partially correct. The other portion of healing has to do with forgiveness of self. B. A GREATLY HEIGHTENED SENSE OF RESPECT FOR THE SELF"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"RA: Another part of healing has to do with demonstrating a greatly heightened respect for the self. This may conveniently be expressed by taking care in dietary matters. This is quite frequently a part of the healing and forgiving process. (B2, 82-83) RA: Information on dietary matters is not to be understood literally but as a link or psychological nudge for the body and the mind and the spirit. Thus it is the care and respect for the self that is the true thing of importance. (B2, 83) II. SECONDARY TECHNIQUES A. PHYSICAL TECHNIQUE: FASTING PURGES THE MIND OF TOXIC THOUGHT- FORMS RA: Those entities in need of purging the self of a poison thought-form or emotion do well to follow a program of careful fasting until the destructive thought-form has been purged. The by-product of this is the ridding of the physical body of excess material. See the value not to the body but see the body used as a link for the mind and spirit (B2, 83) [Note: Colon hydrotherapists will all tell you that toxic, decaying food material can be stored in the large intestine for years.] RA: The discipline or denial of the unwanted, cancerous portion as an appropriate part of the self is taken through the tree of mind down through the trunk to subconscious levels where the connection is male. Then the body, mind, and spirit, in unison, express denial of the excess or unwanted spiritual or mental material as part of the entity. All then falls away. (B2, 91) QUESTION: Is the entity consciously programming this release and using fasting as the method of communication to itself? RA: This is not only correct but may be taken further. If the self is sufficiently aware of the workings of this catalyst and of the techniques of programming, it may, using only faith and concentration of the will, cause reprogramming without using fasting, dieting, or other similar bodily disciplines. (B2, 91) [Note: This degree of adepthood is quite rare and should not be seen as an excuse to abandon healthy dietetic practice and go eat at Mc Donald’s. It is best to combine these techniques with healthy diet.] B. MENTAL TECHNIQUE: FOCUSED ATTENTION (1) THERE IS ONLY ONE TECHNIQUE OF PROGRAMMING QUESTION: You said that if the self understands sufficiently the workings of the catalyst and the techniques of programming, it may cause reprogramming through concentration of the will and the faculty of faith alone, without fasting, diet or other analogous bodily complex disciplines. What are the techniques of programming which the Higher Self uses? (B2, 98) RA: THERE IS BUT ONE TECHNIQUE FOR THIS GROW ING OR NURTURING OF W ILL AND FAITH, AND THAT IS THE FOCUSING OF ATTENTION. The attention span of those you call children is considered short. The spiritual attention span of most of your peoples is that of the child. Thus it is a matter of wishing to become able to collect one’s attention and hold it upon the desired programming."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"This, when continued, strengthens the will. The entire activity can only occur when there exists faith that an outcome of this discipline is possible. (B2, 98) (2) INCREASE YOUR ATTENTION SPAN THROUGH VISUALIZATION QUESTION: What are some exercises for increasing the attention span? RA: The visualization of a shape and color which is of personal inspirational quality to the mediator is the bean of the religious aspects of this son of visualization. The visualization of simple shapes and colors which have no innate inspirational quality to the entity form the basis for what you may call your magical traditions. Whether you imagine the rose or a circle is not important. However, it is suggested that one or the other path be chosen in order to exercise this faculty. (B2, 98) III. CONVENTIONAL METHODS A. SHOULD YOU TAKE MEDICINE? RA: THE MECHANICAL VIEW OF THE BODY HAS CREATED THE CONTINUING RAPID GROW TH OF ILL-HEALTH DUE TO THE STRONG CHEMICALS USED TO CONTROL AND HIDE BODILY DISTORTIONS. (B3, 101) B. SHOULD YOU SEE A DOCTOR? QUESTION: Assume that a sickness occurs within a particular entity who then has a choice of seeking allopathic aid (i.e., seeing a doctor) or experiencing the catalyst of the sickness and not seeking correction of the sickness (i.e. not seeing a doctor). Can you comment? (B3, 101) RA: If the entity is polarized towards service-to-others, it asks which path offers the most opportunity for service-to-others. For the negatively polarized entities the opposite is the case. For the unpolarized entity the considerations are random and most likely in the direction of distortion towards comfort. (B3, 101) IV. METAPHYSICAL UNDERSTANDING OF HEALING A. THE PATH OF THE ENERGY IN HEALING QUESTION: Once the healer has become properly balanced and unblocked with respect to energy centers, it is possible for him to act in some way as a collector and focuser of light, collecting light through the left hand and emitting it through the right. (B3, 113) RA: You are correct but we suggest a few adjustments. The energy brought in by the outstretched hand circulates through the various energy centers to the base of the spine, turning at the red energy center (root chakra) towards a spiral at the yellow energy center and then passing through the green energy center - this then continuing for the 3rd spiral through the blue energy center and being sent from there through the gateway back to intelligent infinity. It is from the green center that the healing prana moves into the polarized healing right hand and from there to the one to be healed. (B3, 113-114) B. THE ONE AND ONLY TRUE DESCRIPTION OF HEALING RA: The crystallized healer is a channel for intelligent energy which offers an opportunity to an entity that it might heal itself. In no case is there any other description of healing. This is also true of the more conventional healers of your culture and if these healers could but fully realize that they are responsible only for offering the opportunity of healing, and not for the healing, many of these entities would feel an enormous load of misconceived responsibility fall from them. (B3, 116) C. THE KEY TO HEALING IS IN THE ETHERIC BODY RA: Healing is first done in the time/space portion (metaphysical part) of the mind/body/spirit complex, then is adopted by the form-making or etheric body, and finally is given to the space/time physical illusion for we by the physical body."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"IT IS THE ADOPTION OF THE CONFIGURATION W HICH YOU CALL HEALTH BY THE ETHERIC BODY IN TIME/SPACE W HICH IS THE KEY TO PHYSICAL HEALTH, NOT ANY EVENT W HICH OCCURS IN SPACE/TIME. (B3, 118) V. IF YOU WANT THE SICKNESS, AT ANY LEVEL, IT STAYS RA: If the entity, at any level, desires to remain in the configuration which seems to need healing (for example, sickness), it will do so. (B3, 115) RA: An entity may not consciously seek healing and yet subconsciously be aware of the need to experience the new set of distortions which result from healing. Similarly an entity may consciously desire healing greatly, but within the being, at some level, find some cause which makes the illness seem appropriate. (B3, 115) JIM MCCARTY: \"Pre-incarnatively chosen limitations confuse many healers who have the opinion that no disease is ever necessary. However it seems that some people choose lessons that will utilize the entire information and not just a portion of it. Thus the distortions needed to present the opportunities for these kinds of lessons are not meant to yield to healing efforts\" (B5, 93) VI. RA ABRIDGES FREE WILL BY GIVING STRONG HEALING ADVICE TO CARLA A. THE SPIRITUAL HEALING NEEDED RE-ENFORCEMENT QUESTION: Carla would like for me to ask if there is any problem with her kidneys? RA: This query is more complex than its brevity would indicate. The kidneys of this instrument (i.e., Carla) is much damaged. The time/space equivalent which rules the body complex is without flaw. There was a serious question, due to psychic attack, whether the spiritual healing would endure. THE SPIRITUAL HEALING HAS ENDURED BUT IT HAS THE NEED TO BE RE-ENFORCED BY AFFIRMATION OF THE ASCENDANCY OF THE SPIRITUAL OVER THE APPARENT OR VISIBLE EFFORTS AT HEALING (B4, 25) B. TAKING MEDICINE WEAKENED THE HEALING RA: When this instrument began ingesting substances (medicine) designed to heal the kidneys in a physical sense, this instrument (Carla) was ceasing the affirmation of healing. Due to this the healing was weakened. This is of some profound distortion and it would be well for the instrument to absorb these concepts. We ask your forgiveness for offering information which may abridge free will, but the dedication of he instrument is such that it would persevere regardless of its condition, if possible. Thusly we offer this information that it may persevere with a fuller distortion towards comfort. (B4, 25) C. A SPIRITUAL HEALER WAS THE CATALYST QUESTION: What was the experience that caused the healing of the time/space kidney? RA: This experience was the healing of self by self with the catalyst of the spiritual healer whom you call Pachita. (B4, 25) 32. BALANCE CAN REMOVE THE NEED FOR CATALYSTS I. ENCOUNTERING CATALYSTS RA: A catalyst not used fully by the mind and spirit is given to the body. (B3, 75) A. PAIN AS CATALYST RA: The experience of pain is most common among your entities. The pain may be physical, but more often it is of the mental or emotional complex. In some few cases the pain is of the spiritual complex. This creates a potential for learning. The lessons to be learned almost always include patience. tolerance, and the ability for the light touch."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Very often the catalyst for emotional pain will result in the opposite, in a bitterness and impatience. In these cases there must be additional catalyst provided to after the unmanifested self more opportunities to DISCOVER THE SELF AS ALL-SUFFICIENT CREATOR CONTAINING ALL THAT IS AND FULL OF JOY. (B2, 52) B. SICKNESS AS CATALYST QUESTION: Do contagious diseases play any part in this process with respect to the unmanifested self? RA: Contagious diseases are those entities of 2nd density which offer an opportunity for this type of catalyst. If this catalyst is unneeded, then the 2nd density creatures as you would call them, do not have an effect. (B2, 52) C. TRAUMA AS CATALYST RA: Among your entities a large percentage of all progression has as catalyst, trauma. (B2, 55) D. THE PURPOSE OF CATALYSTS RA: All catalysts are designed to offer a challenge or lesson. In your density such experience may be loved and accepted or it may be controlled. These are the two paths. W hen neither path is chosen, the catalyst fails in its design and the entity proceeds until some catalyst strikes it which causes it to form a bias toward acceptance and love or toward separation and control. (B2, 110) RA: The purpose of incarnative existence is evolution of mind, body and spirit. In order to do this it is not strictly necessary to have catalyst. However, without catalyst the desire to evolve and the faith in the process do not normally manifest and thus evolution occurs not. (B3, 29) E. IS CATALYST NECESSARY ONLY IF THERE IS AT LEAST A PARTIAL BLOCKAGE OF ONE ENERGY CENTER? RA. This is not correct. Although activating or unblocking each energy center is of primary importance, so also is the refining of the balances between the energies so that the tones of vibratory being-ness coming from each energy center resonate in clarity and harmony with those from the other energy centers. Each energy may be activated without the beauty that is possible through the appreciation of what you call the deeper personality or soul identity. (B3, 26) QUESTION: As an analogy for activating the energy centers, anybody can pull out each string on a stringed musical instrument and release them, producing notes. But that doesn't necessarily produce music. A musician's hands can make music. Is this correct? RA: This is correct. IN THE BALANCED INDIVIDUAL THE ENERGY LIES WAITING FOR THE HAND OF THE CREATOR TO PLUCK HARMONY. (B3, 27) II. THE PROGRESSION OF CATALYST- FROM MENTAL TO PHYSICAL RA: Catalyst is offered to the entity. If it is not used by the mind complex, it will then enter the body and manifest as some form of physical distortion or sickness THE MORE EFFICIENT THE USE OF CATALYST, THE LESS PHYSICAL SICKNESS OR DISTORTION THERE W ILL BE. On some 3rd density planetary spheres catalyst has been used more efficiently. In the case of your sphere there is much inefficient use of catalyst, and therefore much physical distortion. (B3, 124) RA: At first people had longer lifetimes. Eventually catalysts were not being properly assimilated. Therefore lifetimes needed to be shorter. (B4, 15) III. IF YOU RESPOND AT ALL TO THE CATALYST YOU’RE STILL USING IT "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"RA: The catalyst of experience works in order for the teachings of this density to occur. However, if there is seen in the being a response, even if it is simply observed, the entity is still using the catalyst for learning. The end result is that the catalyst is no longer needed. Thus the density is no longer needed. This is not indifference or objectivity, but a finely tuned compassion and love which sees all things as love. This seeing elicits no response due to catalytic reactions. Thus the entity is now able to become co-Creator of experiential occurrences. This is the truer balance. (B2, 94) V. THE COMPLETELY BALANCED ENTITY A. DOES A BALANCED ENTITY HAVE AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE TO BEING ATTACKED? QUESTION: W ould a perfectly balanced entity feel any emotional response when attacked by the other-self? RA: Yes, it would. The response is love. BALANCE IS NOT INDIFFERENCE BUT RATHER THE OBSERVER NOT BLINDED BY ANY FEELINGS OF SEPARATION BUT RATHER FULLY IMBUED W ITH LOVE. (B2, 95) B. ARE ANY SITUATIONS EMOTIONALLY CHARGED TO A BALANCED ENTITY? RA: For a balanced entity no situation has an emotional charge but is simply a situation like any other in which the entity may or may not observe an opportunity to be of service. The closer an entity comes to this attitude the closer an entity is to balance. It is not our recommendation that reactions to catalyst be repressed or suppressed unless such reactions would be a stumbling block not consonant with the law of One to an other-self. It is far, far better to allow the experience to express itself in order that the entity may then make fuller use of this catalyst. (B2, 97) [Note: Wilcock’s favorite paraphrased Ra quote is based on this passage: “To a perfectly balanced entity, there is no such thing as an emotionally charged situation. There are only two choices; the choice to be of service, or the choice to withdraw from the situation.”] V. RANDOM CATALYSTS OCCUR IN UNPOLARIZED ENTITIES RA: In an unpolarized entity, catalyst of the physical distortion nature will be generated at random. The hopeful result, as you say, is the choice of polarity. Often this choice is not made, and the catalyst continues to be generated. (B3, 124) QUESTION: Until an entity becomes consciously aware of the evolutionary process, the Logos or intelligent energy creates the potentials for an entity to gain the experience necessary for polarization. Is this correct? (B4, 155) RA: That is correct. VI. PHYSICAL CATALYSTS ARE LESS PROMINENT IN NEGATIVE POLARIZATION RA: Mental and bodily distortions are found in beings which have need of experiences that aid in polarization. It is more likely for positively oriented individuals to be experiencing physical distortions due to their lack of consuming interest in the self and their emphasis in service to others. In the negatively oriented individual the physical body is likely to be more carefully tended and the mind disciplined against physical distortion. (B3, 124)      33. THE END OF THE PHYSICAL BODY (DEATH)"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"RA: THE ONLY NEED AT DEATH IS THE RELEASING OF THAT ENTITY FROM ITS BODY BY THOSE AROUND IT AND THE PRAISING OF THE PROCESS BY THOSE WHO GRIEVE. BY THESE MEANS MAY THE ONE W HO HAS EXPERIENCED PHYSICAL DEATH BE AIDED, NOT BY CAREFUL AND REPEATED RITUALS. (B3, 9) RA: Natural death is most harmonious; the death by murder is confused and the entity needs some time/space in which to get its bearings. DEATH BY SUICIDE CAUSES THE NECESSITY FOR MUCH HEALING WORK AND THE MAKING OF A DEDICATION TO THE 3RD DENSITY FOR THE RENEWED OPPORTUNITY OF LEARNING THE LESSONS SET BY THE HIGHER SELF. (B3, 143) 34. MENTAL ILLNESS I. WE NOW EXPERIENCE GREEN RAY VIBRATION QUESTION: Does the fact that the basic vibration that we experience now is green true color or 4th density account for the fact that there are many mental effects on metal objects, such as bending metal with the mind? RA: This is not only correct but may be taken further. The great number of entities with the so- called mental diseases is due to effect of this green ray true color upon the mental configurations - those unready mentally to face the self for the first time. (B2, 83) II. IS THIS DIFFICULT FOR THOSE ON THE SERVICE TO SELF PATH ? QUESTION: Is it those entities on the service-to-self path who have extreme difficulty mentally with this green ray vibration? RA: This is incorrect. It is those who have distracted themselves and failed to prepare for this transition yet who are somewhat susceptible to its influence who may be affected. (B2, 83-84) 35. CHANGING SOCIETY RA: Those most active in attempting to remake or alter the society are those working from feelings of being correct personally or of having answers which will put power in a more correct configuration. These interactions most often concentrate upon the 2nd and 3rd energy centers. (B2, 53) There are some few whose desires to aid society are of a green ray nature or above. These entities, however, are few due to the understanding of 4th ray that universal love freely given is more to be desired than principles or even the rearrangement of peoples or political structures. (B2, 53) RA: At the present space/time the conditions of well-meant and unintentional slavery are so numerous that it beggars our ability to enumerate them. (B4, 76) [Note: The conditions in which most animals are raised for our mainstream food supply certainly is one factor that could be missed by many who read this.] E. ENERGY CENTERS AND ENERGY TRANSFERS 36. SEXUAL ENERGY"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"I. HOW THE VEILING AFFECTED SEXUAL ENERGY TRANSFER A. BEFORE THE VEILING (SEPARATION BETWEEN CONSCIOUS / SUBCONSCIOUS MIND, BODY AND SPIRIT) RA: Before the veiling each activity was a transfer of sexual energy. There were some sexual transfers of strength. Most were rather reduced in strength due to the lack of veiling. (B4, 73) In the 3rd density, entities are attempting to learn the ways of love. If it is impossible to not see that all are one being, it becomes much more difficult for the undisciplined personality to choose one mate and, thereby, initiate itself into a program of service. It is much more likely that the sexual energy will be dissipated more randomly without either great joy or great sorrow. Therefore the green-ray transfer occurred almost without exception in sexual energy transfer prior to veiling but it was weakened and without significant crystallization. (B4, 73) RA: Before the veiling sexual intercourse was that of two entities possessed of green-ray capability. THE AW ARENESS OF ALL AS THE CREATOR IS THAT W HICH OPENS THE GREEN RAY CENTER. Thus there was no possibility of blockage due to the sure knowledge of each by each that each was the Creator. The energy transfers were weak due to the ease with which such transfers could take place. (B4, 82-83) RA: Before the veiling process there was a near total lack of the use of this sexual energy transfer beyond green ray. There was, in 3rd density, little purpose to be seen in the more intensive relationships that occur in the mating process, since each other-self was seen to be the Creator and no other-self seemed to be more the Creator than another. (B4, 102) B. AFTER THE VEILING RA: After the veiling it became infinitely more difficult to achieve green-ray energy transfer due to the great areas of unknowing concerning the body and its manifestations (referring to blocks?) However, when such energy transfer was experienced, it was more likely to provide a catalyst for bonding of self with other self in a properly polarized condition. This was due to the great shadowing of the manifestations of the body from the conscious mind. (B4, 102) RA: After veiling, sexual energy transfers and blockages are far more efficient in crystallizing those who seek the green-ray energy center. (B4, 73) II. POLARIZATION PRODUCES SPIRITUAL ENERGY TRANSFER A. SEXUAL ENERGY CONNECTS THE METAPHYSICAL REALM TO THE PHYSICAL REALM RA: The energies transferred during sexual activity are not, properly speaking, of space- time. There is a great component of what you might call metaphysical energy transferred. (B4, 85) Sexual energy is a form of vibratory bridge between space/time and time/space. (B4, 112) B. SEXUAL EXPRESSION STARTS WITH DIFFERENCE AND MOVES TOWARD ONENESS QUESTION: Could you define sexual energy transfer? RA: Energy transfer implies the release of potential energies across, shall we say, a potentiated space. The sexual energy transfers occur due to the polarization of two mind/body/spirit complexes, each of which have some potential difference one to the other. (B2, 31) C. THE MAGNETIC ATTRACTION MAKES AN ACT OF WILL UNNECESSARY"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" QUESTION: Would you define magnetic attraction? RA: In your bisexual natures there is that which is of polarity. This polarity is variable according to the male/female polarity of each entity. Thus you may see the magnetism which two entities with the appropriate balance, male/female versus female/male polarity, meeting and thus feeling the attraction which polarized forces will exert, one upon the other. THIS IS THE STRENGTH OF THE BISEXUAL MECHANISM: IT DOES NOT TAKE AN ACT OF W ILL TO DECIDE TO FEEL ATTRACTION FOR ONE W HO IS OPPOSITELY POLARIZED SEXUALLY. IT W ILL OCCUR IN AN INEVITABLE SENSE, giving the free flow of energy a proper avenue. This avenue may be blocked by some distortion toward a belief- condition. Mating to the entity that this attraction is not desired. However,  the basic mechanism functions as simply as would, shall we say, the magnet and a piece of iron. (B2, 34) III. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE ENTITIES RA: The male stores physical energy, the female stores mental and mental/emotional energy. In 3 rd density sexual energy transfer, the male offers physical energy, the female is thereby refreshed, having far less physical vitality. The female offers inspiration, healing and blessing to the male which by nature is less vital in this effect. (B4, 112) RA: In energy transfer the female is able to potentiate that which may be within the conscious mind of the male so that it may feel inspirited. IN A MORE GENERAL SENSE. THAT W HICH REACHES MAY BE SEEN AS A MALE PRINCIPLE. THAT W HICH AW AITS THE REACHING MAY BE SEEN AS A FEMALE PRINCIPLE. (B4, 159) IV. BLOCKAGES OF SEXUAL ENERGY TRANSFERS A. THE ROOT CAUSE OF BLOCKS QUESTION: Before the veiling sexual energy transfer was always possible, but it is not always possible after the veiling. What is the primary source of the blockages? (B4, 109) RA: The root cause of blockage is the lack of the ability to see the other-self as the Creator, or to phrase it differently, the lack of love. (B4, 110) B. TYPES OF BLOCKS QUESTION: Can you speak on the various types of blockages that occur in our sexual reproductive complex? 1. RED RAY: RA: The first energy transfer is red ray and has to do only with your reproductive system. 2. YELLOW AND ORANGE RAY: (a) ONLY ONE VIBRATES IN THIS COLOR RA: In the orange-ray-attempts and yellow-ray attempts to have sexual intercourse, a blockage will be created if only one entity vibrates in this area"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"and that entity will have a never ending appetite for this activity. What these vibratory levels are seeking is green ray activity. (B2, 30-31) (b) TREATING SELF OR OTHER AS OBJECT RA: There is the possibility of orange or yellow ray energy transfer but this will be negatively polarized with one being seen as object rather than other- self and the other seeing itself as plunderer or master of the situation. (B2, 30-31) 3. GREEN RAY: (a) FEAR OF OR DESIRE FOR POSSESSING OR BEING POSSESSED RA: In green ray there are two possibilities, Firstly, if both vibrate in green ray, there will be a mutually strengthening energy transfer. The female draws the energy from the roots of the being-ness through the energy centers. The male finds in its energy transfer an inspiration which satisfies and feeds the spirit portion of the mind/body/spirit complex. This energy transfer will be blocked only if one or both entities have fear of possession or of being possessed, of desiring possession or desiring being possessed. (B2, 30-31) (b) NOT OFFERING UNIVERSAL LOVE RA: The other green my possibility is when only one of the two entities offers green ray energy, the other not offering universal love energy. This results in a blockage of the one not offering the green ray energy and increases frustration or appetite. (B2, 30-3l) 4. BLUE RAY: RARE RA: The blue ray energy transfer is somewhat rare among your peoples at this time but is of great aid due to energy transfers involved in becoming able to express without reservation or fear. 5. INDIGO RAY EXTREMELY RARE RA: The indigo ray transfer is extremely rare among your peoples. This is the sacramental portion of the body complex whereby contact may be made through violet my with intelligent infinity. No blockages may occur at these later two levels. (B2, 30-31) V. CAN ONE TELL WHICH RAY IS PRESENT IN THE ENERGY TRANSFER ? A. QUESTION: Is there any way to tell which ray the transfer was for an individual after the experience? (B4, 87) RA: There is only a subjective yardstick. B. GREEN: LOVE IS MADE WHOLE RA: If the energies have flowed so that love is made whole, green-ray transfer has taken place. C. BLUE: COMMUNICATION IS EASIER If greater ease in communication and greater sight has been experienced, the energy has been refined to the blue-ray energy center. (B4, 87) D. INDIGO: WILL AND FAITH ARE STIMULATED If the polarized entities find that the faculties of will and faith have been stimulated, not for a brief while but for a greater duration of what you call time, you may perceive the indigo-ray transfer. (B4, 87) E. VIOLET: AN OPENING TO THE GATEWAY TO INTELLIGENT INFINITY We may not speak of the violet-ray transfer except to note that it is an opening to the gateway to intelligent infinity. Indeed, the indigo-ray transfer is also this but the veil has not been lifted. (B4, 87)"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"VI. SHARING SEXUAL ENERGIES A. TRANSFER THROUGH THE RAYS CAN OCCUR ONCE GREEN RAY IS REACHED RA: Once green-ray energy transfer has been achieved by two mind/body/spirits in mating, the further rays are available without both entities having the necessity to progress equally. Thus a blue ray vibrating entity or indigo ray vibrating entity with the green ray other-self can serve as catalyst for the learn/teaching of the other-self until the other-self teaches green ray. such energy transfer through the rays is not possible. (B2, 40) B. REFINEMENT LEADS TO HIGH SEXUAL MAGIC RA: Sexual energy transfer takes place upon a non-magical level by all those entities which vibrate green-ray active, it is possible, in the case of a being who dedicates itself to the service of the One Infinite Creator, to refine this energy transfer. When the other self also dedicates itself in service to the One Infinite Creator, the transfer is doubled. There are refinements from this point onward leading to the realm of high sexual magic. (B3, 176) VII. THE GREAT KEY = UNCONDITIONAL LOVE RA: The great key to blue, indigo. and. finally, that great capitol of the column of sexual energy transfer, violet energy transfers, is the metaphysical bond or distortion which has the name among your peoples of unconditional love. IN THE BLUE RAY ENERGY TRANSFER THE QUALITY OF THIS LOVE IS REFINED IN THE FIRE OF HONEST COMMUNICATION AND CLARITY; THIS NORMALLY TAKES A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIME TO ACCOMPLISH. THIS IS ONE METHOD OF CRYSTALLIZING THE BLUE-RAY CENTER. (B4, 86-87) VII. TANTRA YOGA RA: The energy transfer does not leap between green and green energy centers but is the sharing of the energies of each from red ray upwards. It is most efficient when both entities have orgasm simultaneously. However, it functions as transfer if either has the orgasm and indeed, in the case of the physically expressed love between a mated pair which does not result in orgasm, there is nevertheless a considerable amount of energy transferred... as long as both entities are aware of the potential difference and release its strength to each other by desire of the will in a mental dedication. You may see this practice in what you may call other than Christian religious distortion systems of the Law of One. (B4,84) QUESTION: Could you give an example? RA: We preface this example with the reminder that each system is quite distorted and its teachings always half-lost. However, one such system is that called the Tantric Yoga. (B4, 84) IX. SACRAMENTAL SEXUALITY A. ACTIVATE INDIGO RAY RA: Motivation of indigo ray vibration is the beginning of the sacramental nature of your bisexual reproductive act. It is unique in bearing the allness, the wholeness, the unity in its offering to the other self. (B2, 40) RA: The male principle must reach and penetrate, in a symbolically sexual fashion, the inner secrets of the feminine principle before sanctified sexuality which is related to the feminine principle of mind, can be used. (B4, 161) B. SEE THIS AS THE CREATOR EXPERIENCING SELF RA: You may see this activity, as all experiential activities, as the Creator experiencing Itself. (B2, 31) QUESTION: Could this be the primal mechanism for the Creator to experience Itself?"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"RA: This is not a proper term. It is one appropriate way. The bisexual knowing of the Creator by Itself Las the potential for two advantages. Firstly, in the green ray activated being there is the potential for a direct and simple analogue of what you may call joy, the spiritual or metaphysical nature which exits as intelligent infinity. This is a great aid to comprehension of a truer nature of being-ness. The other potential advantage is having a sacramental understanding or connection with the gateway to intelligent infinity, for with appropriate preparation, experience of intelligent infinity may be obtained. (B2, 31-32) RA: After the veiling it was far more likely that higher energy transfers would be sought by the mated pair of mind/body/spirit complexes, thus allowing the Creator to know Itself with great beauty, solemnity and wonder. Intelligent infinity having been reached by this sacramental use of this function, each entity gained greatly in polarization and ability to serve. (B4, 102) X. COMPLETE FUSION QUESTION: Can you expand on what “complete fusion nature\" means? RA: The entire creation is of the One Creator, Thus the division of sexual activity into simply that of the bodily complex is an artificial division, all things thusly being seen as sexual equally, the mind, the body and the spirit, all of which are part of the polarity of the entity. THUS SEXUAL FUSION MAY BE SEEN, W ITH OR W ITHOUT W HAT YOU CALL SEXUAL INTERCOURSE, TO BE THE COMPLETE MELDING OF THE MIND, THE BODY, AND THE SPIRIT IN W HAT FEELS TO BE A CONSTANT ORGASM OF JOY AND DELIGHT IN THE OTHER'S BEING-NESS. (B2, 41-42) XI. WHITE MAGIC RA The heart of white magic is the experience of the joy of union with the Creator. This joy will necessarily radiate through the life experience of the positive adept. It is for this reason that sexual magic is not restricted solely to the negatively oriented polarizing adepts but when most carefully used has its place in high magic as it, when correctly pursued, joins body, mind and spirit with the One Infinite Creator. (B3, 161) XII. HOMOSEXUALITY RA: If an entity has had roughly 65% of its incarnations in the sexual/biological body complex of the opposite polarity to its present body complex, this entity is vulnerable to infringement in your urban areas and may become what you call homosexual. (B2, 35) XIII. PRESENT DAY MARRIAGE VERSUS MATED RELATIONSHIPS RA: As your peoples became open to the concepts of hostility and war and greed of ownership, these ideas filtered down the tree of mind into body complex expressions, sexuality being an example. (B2, 37) QUESTION: Is the entire population infected in some way? RA: There is some contamination of the sexual, this showing mostly in your own culture as the various predispositions to adversary relationships, or, as you call them, marriages, rather than the free giving one to another in the love and light of the Infinite Creator. (B2, 37) [Note: Of course, this is a controversial statement. What they mean is that the forcing of a legal contract between two entities can cause much embitterment and feelings of ownership, attachment and possession. They do not, however, disapprove of mated relationships, and in fact encourage them. Remember that free will is the primary distortion of the Law of One, and such a contract makes any possible future free-will decision to end the relationship into a complex legal nightmare, not to mention a social and religious stigma. One possible compromise is the renewable-contract marriage, where the vows are consciously chosen to be reinstated at each anniversary.]"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"QUESTION: Did the Logos plan, before the veiling, to create a system of random sexual activity? RA: It was the intention of the original Logoi that entities mare with one another in any fashion which caused a greater polarization. It was determined after much observation that polarization increased many fold if the mating were not indiscriminate. Consecutive Logoi preserved a bias toward the mated relationship which is more characteristic of more disciplined personalities and the higher densities. The free will of each entity, however, was always paramount and only a bias could be offered. (B4, 88) XIV. SEXUAL ENERGY IN 4TH DENSITY RA: In 4th density the choice has been made and the veil has been lifted. In positive polarities true sharing is almost universal, in negative polarities true blockage is almost universal; the conqueror obtains orgasm, the conquered almost never. (B4, 111) 37. ROTATION AND CRYSTALLIZATION OF CHAKRAS I. DO CHAKRAS ROTATE OR CRYSTALLIZE ? RA: In the first 3 energy centers a full unblocking of this energy will create speeds of rotation. As the entity develops the higher energy centers, however, these centers will then begin to express their nature by forming crystal structures. This is the higher or more balanced form of activation. (B3, 9) II. THE CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE OF THE VARIOUS CHAKRAS A. RED ENERGY CENTER - It has the shape of a spoked wheel. B. ORANGE ENERGY CENTER - It has a flower shape containing three petals. C. YELLOW ENERGY CENTER - Rounded in shape, many faceted as a star D. GREEN ENERGY CENTER - Lotus-shape, the number of points dependent upon the strength of this center. E. BLUE ENERGY CENTER - Capable of having perhaps 100 facets and capable of great flashing brilliance. F. INDIGO ENERGY CENTER - Usually the basic triangular or 3 petaled shape G. VIOLET ENERGY CENTER - The least variable. Has 1000 petals. (B3, 10) III. CLEARING ENERGY BLOCKS RA: The indigo center is the most important for the work of the adept. However, it cannot, no matter how crystallized, correct to any extent whatsoever imbalances or blockages in other energy centers. They must be cleared seriatim (one after the other) from red upwards. (B3, 180) IV. THE USE OF ENERGY CENTERS BY POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ENTITIES RA: The negative will use the 3 lower centers for separation from and control over others by sexual means, by personal assertion, and by action in your societies. The positively oriented entity will he transmuting strong red-ray energy into green-ray energy transfers and into radiation in blue and indigo. Also it will be transmuting selfhood and place in society into situations in which the entity may merge with and serve others; and finally radiate unto others without expecting any transfer in return. (B3, 29) V. CRYSTALLIZATION "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"RA: It is well to remember that the chakras or energy centers can be functioning properly without crystallization. (B4, 83) QUESTION: Would they be equivalent in electrical circuitry to a completed circuit, red through green, with a high resistance, where the total quantity of energy transferred is small? RA: The uncrystallized, lower centers cannot deliver the higher voltage. The crystallized centers may become quite remarkable in their high voltage characteristics. (B4, 83) 38. THE 7 CHAKRAS, THEIR RAYS AND BLOCKAGES I. ROOT CHAKRA: RED RAY, THE FOUNDATION RAY RA: The basic energy of red ray - this ray is the basic strengthening ray for each density. (B2, 77) RA: The south pole (root chakra) is one which attracts. It pulls unto itself those things magnetized to it. This red ray, being the lowest center of the physical vehicle, will have the first opportunity to react to any experience. It has the opportunity to function first, and therefore relates to survival. Once it is balanced and unblocked, much is open to the seeker. (B2, 128) RA: The first balancing is of the Malkuth, or Earth, vibratory energy complex, called the red-ray complex. An understanding and acceptance of this energy is fundamental. (B1, 144) II. EMOTIONAL OR PERSONAL CENTER: ORANGE RAY, THE RAY OF MOVEMENT TOWARDS YELLOW RAY RA: The next energy complex which may be blocked is the emotional or personal complex, also known as the orange-ray complex. This blockage will often demonstrate itself as personal eccentricities or distortions with regard to self-conscious understanding or acceptance of self. (B1, 145) RA: The orange ray is that influence or vibratory pattern wherein the mind/body/spirit complex expresses its power on an individual basis. Power over individuals may be seen to be orange ray. This ray has been quite intense among your peoples on an individual basis. You may see in this ray the treating of other-selves as non-entities, slaves or chattel, thus giving other-selves no status whatsoever. (B2, 38) III. 3RD CHAKRA YELLOW-RAY: RAY OF SELF-AWARENESS AND INTERACTION WITH OTHERS (B2, 92) A. RELATES TO GROUPS RA: The yellow ray concerns the entity in relation to groups or societies. It is at the heart of hostile actions in which one group of entities feels the necessity and the right of dominating other groups of entities until bending their wills to the wills of the masters. (B2, 38) RA: The usual nature of sexual interaction, if one is yellow or orange in primary vibratory patterns, is one of blockage and then insatiable hunger due to the blockage. When two selves are of this pattern. one entity experiences the pleasure of humiliation and slavery and bondage, the other experiencing the pleasure of mastery and control over another entity. In this way a sexual energy transfer of a negative polarity is experienced. (B2, 39) B. BLOCKAGES RELATED TO EGO The third blockage resembles most closely that which you have called ego. It is the yellow- ray or solar plexus center. Blockages in this center will often manifest as distortions toward power manipulation and other social behaviors concerning those close and those associated"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"with the mind/body/spirit complex. Those with blockages in these first three energy centers, or nexi, (i.e. red, orange and yellow) will have continuing difficulties in ability to further their seeking of the Law of One. (B1, 145) C. OCCURS FIRST IN SOME PLANTS AND ANIMALS QUESTION. What is the simplest entity having both orange and yellow ray energy centers? RA: Those having animal and vegetative natures which find the necessity for reproduction by bisexual techniques or who find it necessary to depend in some way upon other selves for survival and growth. (B2, 89) IV. HEART CHAKRA: GREEN-RAY RAY OF COMPASSION & ALL-FORGIVING LOVE (B2, 92) A. THE TURNING POINT RA: With the green ray transfer of energy you come to the great turning point sexually as well in other modes of experience. The green ray may be turned outward, the entity then giving rather than receiving . (B2, 39) GREEN-RAY ACTIVITY IS THAT ALL-COMPASSIONATE LOVE WHICH DEMANDS NO RETURN. (B4, 77) B. SPRINGBOARD TO INFINITE INTELLIGENCE RA: The center of heart, or green-ray, is the center from which third-density beings may springboard, shall we say, to infinite intelligence. Blockages in this area may manifest as difficulties in expressing what you may call universal love or compassion. (B1, 145) C. POSSIBLE REVERSALS RA: The green ray activation is always vulnerable to the yellow or orange ray of possession. Fear of possession, desire for possession, fear of being possessed, desire to be possessed: these are the distortions which will cause the deactivation of green ray energy transfer. (B2, 43) RA: The influences of the true color green acting upon yellow ray entities have caused many entities to revert to the consideration of self rather than the stepping forward into consideration of other-self or green ray. This may not be seen to be of a negatively polarized nature, as the negative polarized entity is working very intensively with the deepest manifestations yellow ray group energies, especially the manipulations of other-self for service to self. Those reverting to the orange ray, and we may add these are many upon your plane at this time, are those who feel the vibrations of true color green and, therefore, respond by rejecting governmental and societal activities as such and seek once more the self. (B2, 88) V. THROAT CHAKRA: BLUE-RAY, COMMUNICATION, FIRST RAY OF RADIATION OF SELF REGARDLESS OF ANY ACTIONS OF ANOTHER RA: Once the green ray has been achieved, the ability to enter blue ray is immediate and is only awaiting the efforts of the individual. (B2, 43) RA: The first giving beyond green ray is the giving of acceptance or freedom, thus allowing the recipient of blue ray energy transfer the opportunity of feeling accepted, thus freeing that other-self to express itself to the giver of the ray. (B2, 39) RA: The blue-ray center of energy streaming is the center which, for the first time, is outgoing as well as inpouring. Those blocked in this area may have difficulty in grasping the spirit/mind complexes of its own entity and further difficulty in expressing such understandings of self. Entities blocked in this area may have difficulties in accepting communication from other mind/body/spirit complexes. (B1, 145) RA: The blue ray entity is a co-Creator. (B2, 92) VI. INNER EYE OR PINEAL CHAKRA- INDIGO-RAY RA: THE INDIGO RAY IS OPENED ONLY THROUGH CONSIDERABLE DISCIPLINE AND PRACTICE LARGELY HAVING TO DO W ITH"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"ACCEPTANCE OF SELF, NOT ONLY AS THE POLARIZED AND BALANCED SELF BUT AS TUE CREATOR, AS AN ENTITY OF INFINITE W ORTH. THIS W ILL BEGIN TO ACTIVATE THE INDIGO RAY. (B2, 43) RA: The indigo-ray energy center is fed, as are all energy centers, by experience - but far more than the others it is fed by what we have called the disciplines of the personality. (B3, 160) RA: THE INDIGO RAY IS THE RAY OF AW ARENESS OF THE CREATOR AS SELF. Thus one whose indigo ray vibrations have been activated can offer the energy transfer of Creator to Creator. (B2, 40) RA: The indigo ray, though precious, is that ray worked upon only by the adept, as you would call it. It is the gateway to intelligent infinity bringing intelligent energy through. This is the energy center on in those teachings considered hidden and occult, for this ray is that which is infinite possibilities. Those who heal, teach and work for the Creator in any way which may be seen to be as balanced are those of the indigo ray. (B2, 77)  RA: Those blocked in this (indigo-ray) center may experience a lessening of the influx of intelligent energy due to manifestations which appear as unworthiness... The indigo-ray balancing is quite central to the type of work which revolves about the spirit complex, which has its influx then into the transformation or transmutation of third density to fourth density, it being the energy center receiving the least distorted outpourings of love/light from intelligent energy and also the potential for the key to the gateway of intelligent infinity. (B1, 145) VII. CROWN CHAKRA: COLOR = VIOLET QUESTION: When there's a feeling in the crown chakra in meditation, what is happening? RA: The entity is experiencing in-streamings at that energy center to be used either: (1) for the unblocking of this center (2) for its tuning to match the harmonics of its other energy center (3) or to activate the gateway to intelligent infinity. (B3, 32) RA: (The violet ray center) is simply the total expression of the entity’s vibratory complex of mind, body and spirit. It is as it will be, “balanced” or “imbalanced” has no meaning at this energy level, for it gives and takes in its own balance. Whatever the distortion may be, it cannot be manipulated as can the others and, therefore, has no particular importance in viewing the balancing of an entity. (B1, 145) The energy ingress ends with indigo (inner eye chakra). The violet ray is a thermometer or indicator of the whole. (B3, 31) 39. THE VARIOUS ENERGY BODIES QUESTION: In our esoteric literature numerous bodies are listed, ie, the physical, etheric, emotional, and astral. Is this the right number? RA: To answer your query fully would be the work of many sessions such as this one, for the interrelationships of the various bodies and each body’s effects in various situations is an enormous study. However, we shall begin by referring your minds back to the spectrum of true colors and the usage of this understanding in grasping the various densities of your octave. We have the number seven repeated from the macrocosm to the microcosm in structure and experience . Therefore, it would only be expected that there would be seven basic bodies which we would perhaps be most lucid by stating as red-ray body, etc."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"However... this will be confusing, for various teachers (may have) named a subtle body one thing and another find a different name. (B2, 114) [Note: In other words, confusion can arise due to spiritual faiths such as Hinduism and Buddhism which may have differing names for the same energy bodies.] I. THE RED-RAY BODY RA: The red-ray is your chemical body. However, it is not the body which you have as clothing in the physical. It is the unconstructed material of the body, the elemental body without form. This basic unformed material body is important to understand for there are healings which may be carried out by the simple understanding of the elements present in the physical vehicle. (B2, 114) [Note: Two such examples of this would be mineral supplementation and the use of magnetism for healing. It can also relate to far more subtle studies of how vibration affects various elements.] II. THE ORANGE RAY BODY RA: This is the physical body complex. It is still not the body you inhabit. but rather the body formed without self-awareness, the body in the womb before the spirit/mind complex enters. This body may live without the inhabitation of the mind and spirit complexes, but seldom does so. (B2, 114) II. THE YELLOW RAY BODY RA: (This) is your physical vehicle which you know of at this time and in which you experience catalyst. IV. THE GREEN-RAY BODY RA: This is a lighter body packed more densely with life. It is the body that is seen in séance when what you call ectoplasm is furnished. Some call it the astral body. Others have called it the etheric body, but this is not correct in the sense that the etheric body is that body of gateway wherein intelligent energy is able to mold the mind/body/spirit complex. (B2, 115) V. THE BLUE-RAY BODY OR LIGHTBODY RA: The light body or blue-ray body may be called the devachanic body. There are many other names for this body especially in your so-called Indian Sutras or writings, for there are those among these peoples which have explored these regions and understand the various types of devachanic bodies. There are many, many types of bodies in each density, much like your own. (B2, 115) RA: There is always some difficulty in penetrating blue primary energy for it requires that which your people have in great paucity (i.e., scarcity); that is, honesty. Blue ray is the ray of free communication with self and with other-self . (B2, 121) VI. THE INDIGO-RAY BODY RA: This is what we choose to call the etheric body. It is the gateway body. You may only see this body as that of light as it may mold itself as it desires. (B2, 116) RA: This is the first body that activates itself upon death. It is the “form-maker” (or what the Egyptians referred to as “Ka.”) This body remains until understanding has been gained by the mind/body/spirit complex. Then a body of another ray (e.g. green) is activated. (B2, 116) RA: This indigo body, being intelligent energy, is able to offer the newly dead, as you would term it, a soul perspective and a place from which to view the experience most recently manifested. (B2, 117) VII. THE VIOLET RAY BODY RA: You may call this the Buddha body or that body which is complete. Within it lies a sense of wholeness which is extremely close to unity with all that there is. (B2, 115) RA: This may be seen to be manifested by a sense of the consecrate or hallowed nature of everyday creations and activities. (B2, 121) MOVES COMING FROM BEYOND OUR PLANET"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Link to Introductory Page – Law of One / Ra Material Study Guide 40. THE CONFEDERATION I. THE CONFEDERATION SERVES THE CREATOR RA: I am one of the members of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator. There are approximately fifty-three civilizations, comprising approximately five hundred planetary consciousness complexes in this Confederation. This Confederation contains those from your own planet who have attained dimensions beyond your third. It contains planetary entities within your solar system and planetary entities from other galaxies (solar systems.) It is a true Confederation in that its members are not alike, but allied in service according to the Law of One... They are available to you through your thought. II. HOW MANY ON THIS PLANET CALL FOR YOUR SERVICES ? RA: I am called personally by 352,000. (B1, 97) III. WHAT IS THE RESULT OF APPLYING THE LAW OF SQUARES TO THIS? [Note: Due to the natural bias of the One Creator towards the positive polarity, any call for help that is rooted in service-to-others is significantly increased in its strength: hence, the “law of squares.” In endlessly multiplying “fractal” fashion, the “voice” of each entity who calls is squared in strength by each additional entity who calls thereafter, and it quickly multiplies into the equivalent of a huge number of entities. That number becomes the new equivalent for how many entities are requesting service.] RA: The number is approximately meaningless in that there are many, many digits. It constitutes a great calling which we of all creation feel and hear as if our own entities were distorted towards a great and overwhelming sorrow. It demands our service. (B1, 97) STATEMENT: If the Confederation landed on Earth, they would be taken as gods, breaking the Law of Free Will and thus reducing their polarization of service to all. [Ra did not disagree with this] (B1, 150) IV. WHY THE CONFEDERATION WAS FORMED ? RA: THE DESIRE TO SERVE BEGINS, IN THE DIMENSION OF LOVE OR UNDERSTANDING (4TH DENSITY), TO BE AN OVERW HELMING GOAL OF THE SOCIAL MEMORY COMPLEX. (B1, 155) V. THOUGHT WARS RA: [In a thought war] The negative become depleted through failure to manipulate, and the positive become depleted through failure to accept what is given. (B1, 214) QUESTION: What is meant by \"failure to accept what was given\"? RA: The most accepting and loving energy would be to so love those who wished to manipulate that those entities were surrounded and engulfed, transformed by positive energies. This, however, being a battle of equals, the Confederation is aware that it cannot, on equal footing, allow itself to be manipulated in order to remain purely positive, for then though pure it would not be of any consequence, having been placed by the so-called powers of darkness under the heel, as you may say."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Thus those who deal with this thought-war must he defensive rather than accepting in order to preserve their useful service to others. Thus they cannot fully accept what the Orion group wishes to give, that being enslavement. Thusly some polarity is lost due to this friction, and both sides must then regroup. (B1, 214) RA: This is the most difficult work of the Confederation. Only four planetary entities at any one time are asked to partake in this conflict. (B1, 214) QUESTION: What density are these 4 planetary entities? RA: 4th density. The 4th density is the only density besides your own which, lacking the wisdom to refrain from battle, sees the necessity of battle. (B1, 214)    41. UFOs I. UFOS FROM THE CONFEDERATION RA: The crafts you call UFOs have not been used by us in your present space/time memory complex. (B1, 94) A. DO ANY OF THE CONFEDERATION MEMBERS COME HERE IN SPACE CRAFT? RA: We must state that this information is unimportant. If you will understand this, the information may be offered. Each planetary entity wishing to appear within your 3rd dimension of space/time distortion must request permission to break quarantine, as you would call it. At present there are seven which are operating with craft in your density, Their purpose is very simple: to allow those entities of your planet to become aware of infinity which is often best expressed to the uninformed as the mysterious unknown. (B1, 95) Any request is laid before the Council of Saturn. B. WHO ARE THE MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL OF SATURN? RA: They are representatives from the Confederation and also those from those vibratory levels of your inner planes bearing responsibility for your 3rd density. The names are not important because there are no names. The name concept is not part of the Council. If names are requested, we will attempt them. However, not all have chosen names. To back up this council, there are twenty-four entities which offer services as requested and are called the Guardians. (B1, 98) The Council has not allowed the breaking of quarantine in the time/space continuum. But permission has been granted to appear in thought form capacity for those who have eyes to see. However, there is a certain amount of landing taking place. Some are the entities known to you as the group of Orion. (B1, 99) II. THE MEETING WITH PRESIDENT EISENHOWER QUESTION: Did Dwight Eisenhower meet with either the Confederation or the Orion group in the 1950's? RA: The one of which you speak met with thought-forms which are indistinguishable from 3rd density. This was a test. We, the Confederation, wished to see what would occur if this extremely positive oriented and simple congenial person with no significant distortion towards power happened across peaceful information from the Confederation. We discovered that this entity did not feel that those under his care could deal with the concepts of other beings and other philosophies. Thus an agreement reached then allowed him to go his way and ourselves to do"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"likewise, and also allowed a very quiet campaign be continued alerting your peoples to our presence gradually. Events have overtaken this plan. (B5, 46) III. UFOS FROM ORION RA: Many UFOs seen in your skies are of the Orion group. They send out messages. Some are received by those who are oriented toward service to others. THESE MESSAGES THEN ARE ALTERED TO BE ACCEPTABLE TO THOSE (POSITIVE) ENTITIES WHILE WARNING OF DIFFICULTIES AHEAD. This is the most that self-serving entities can do when faced with those who wish to serve others. The contacts which the Orion group finds most helpful to their cause are those contacts made with entities (people on Earth) whose orientation is towards service to self. (B1, 124) IV. WHY DON'T THE ORION UFOs LAND IN MASS ON EARTH ? QUESTION: Does it work better for those of Orion to work behind the scenes to get recruits who follow the Orion Crusaders of their own free will, or is it just as good for the Orion group to land on our planet and demonstrate remarkable powers and get people like that? (B1, 151) RA: Working behind the scenes is better for the Orion group in that it does not infringe upon the Law of One by landing. A mass landing would create a loss of polarization [of the Orion group] due to the infringement upon the free will of the planet. However, it would be a gamble. [NOTE: Presumably it is a gamble, rather than a certainty, because only a very limited number would get through the quarantine.] If the planet were conquered and became part of the Empire, the free will could then be re-established. This is restrained in action due to the desire of the Orion group to progress towards the One Creator. This desire to progress inhibits the group from breaking the Law of Confusion (B1, 151) V. IN WHICH DENSITIES DO BEINGS NEED SPACESHIPS ? A- 3RD DENSITY ENTITIES RA: For the most part those coming from distant points do not need craft as you know them. The question requires understanding you do not possess. We shall attempt to state what can be stated. There are a few 3rd density entities (for example, those from Sirius) who have learned how to use craft to travel between star systems while experiencing the limitations you now understand, namely very long flight times. (B3, 7) B. 4TH, 5TH AND 6TH DENSITY ENTITIES RA: 4th, 5th and 6th density entities use one of two other means. (1) One type of craft can arrive without any time lapse at all, using a slingshot gravitic light effect. (B3, 7) (2) The other type is a type of experience (rather than a craft). These entities have learned the necessary disciplines enabling them to view the universe as one being and, therefore, are able to proceed from one location to another by thought alone, materializing the necessary craft, if you will, to enclose the light body of the entity. (B3, 7) C. 6TH DENSITY ENTITIES RA: In 6th density there are virtually no entities which any longer use outer technology for travel or communication. (B3, 13) VI. DO CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OCCUR ? RA: They have occurred. We may note that in a universe of unending unity the concept of a \"Close Encounter\" is humorous, for are not all encounters of a nature of self with self? Therefore, how can any encounter be less than very, very close? (B3, 19)"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"VII. HOW DID RA CONSTRUCT THEIR SPACECRAFT ? QUESTION: When you came to this planet in craft 18,000 and 11,000 years ago, these craft have been called bell craft and looked somewhat like a bell. Is this correct? [- They were photographed by George Adamski.] (B3, 153) RA: This is correct. QUESTION: Were these constructed in time/space or in space/time? RA: We ask your persistent patience, for our answer must be complex. A construct of thought was formed in time/space. This portion of time/space is that which approaches the speed of light. In time/space, at this approach, the conditions are such that time becomes infinite and mass ceases so that one which is able to skim the, shall we say, boundary of this time/space is able to become placed where it will (in space/time I suppose). When we were where we wished to be we then clothed the construct of light with that which would appear as the crystal bell. This was formed through the boundary into space/time. Thus there were two constructs, the time/space or immaterial construct, and the space/time or materialized construct. (B3, 153)        42. THE QUARANTINE OF EARTH AFFECT ON FREE WILL I. DOES THE CONFEDERATION STOP ORION'S SHIPS FROM LANDING HERE ? RA: Every effort is made to quarantine this planet. However, the network of guardians does not hinder each and every entity from penetrating the quarantine. (B1, 123) II. HOW DOES THE CONFEDERATION STOP ORION'S SHIPS ? RA: There is contact at the level of light form or light-body-being, depending on the level or the guardian. These guardians sweep reaches of your Earth's energy fields to be aware of any entities approaching. An entity approaching is hailed in the name of the One Creator. Any entity thus hailed is bathed in love/light, and it will, of free will, obey the quarantine due to the power of the law of One. (B1, 124) QUESTION: What would happen if the entity, so hailed, did not obey? RA: To not obey quarantine after being hailed on the level of which we speak would be equivalent to your not stopping upon walking into a solid brick wall. (B1, 124) QUESTION: What would happen if they tried? RA: The Creator is one being. The vibratory level of those able to breach the quarantine boundaries is such that upon seeing the love/light net, it is impossible to break this law. Therefore nothing happens. No attempt is made. There is no confrontation. The only beings who are able to penetrate the quarantine are those who discover windows or distortions in the space/time continua surrounding your planet's energy fields. Through these windows they come. These windows are rare and unpredictable. (B1, 124) QUESTION: Does this account for the large numbers of UFOs in 1973? RA: This is correct. (B1, 124) III. FREE WILL "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"QUESTION: Considering the free will distortion of the Law of One, how can the Guardians quarantine Earth? Does this interfere with free will? RA: The Guardians guard the free will distortion of the mind/body/complexes of 3rd density on Earth. Events which required activation of quarantine were interfering with the free will distortion of your people. (B1, 149) QUESTION: Does this not interfere with the free will of the Orion group? RA: The balancing is from dimension to dimension. The attempts of the Orion Crusaders to interfere with free will are acceptable upon the dimension of their own understanding. However, those of your dimension form a dimension of free will which is not able to recognize in full the distortions toward manipulation. Thus the quarantine is needed to balance the dimensional variances in vibration. (B1, 149) IV. WINDOWS IN THE QUARANTINE, MORE ON FREE WILL QUESTION: Windows occur to let the Orion group come through once in a while. Are they needed as a balancing to prevent the Guardians from reducing their positive polarization by totally eliminating the Orion contact through shielding? (B1, 150) RA: This is partially correct. Balancing allows an equal amount of positive and negative influx. In your particular planetary sphere less negative information or stimulus is necessary than positive due to the somewhat negative orientation of your social complex distortion. (B1, 150) STATEMENT: In this way, total free will is balanced so that individuals may have an equal opportunity to choose service to others or service to self. Is this correct? RA: This is correct. (B1, 150) STATEMENT: This is a profound revelation, I believe, in the Law of Free Will. (B1, 150) 43. THE GREAT CHOICE: TO SERVE OTHERS OR SELF I. THE CHOICE IS NOT MADE IN 2ND DENSITY QUESTION: Can an entity start in 2nd density with service to self and just stay on the path of service to self and never be pulled out of it. Is this correct? RA: This is incorrect. The 2nd density concept of serving self includes the serving of those in the tribe or pack. This is not seen in 2nd density as separation of self and other-self. All this is seen as self. It the pack becomes weakened, so does the entity within the pack. The new or initial 3rd density has this innocent bias toward viewing those in the family, the society, or the country, as self. This distortion, though nor useful for progress in 3rd density, is without polarity. THE BREAK BECOMES APPARENT W HEN THE ENTITY PERCEIVES OTHER-SELVES AND CONSCIOUSLY DETERMINES TO MANIPULATE OTHER SELVES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE SELF. THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE NEGATIVE PATH. (B1, 180-181) II. IS IT A CONSCIOUS CHOICE ? QUESTION: Does the entity consciously choose which path (service to self or service to others) it will take? RA: The majority of 3rd density beings is far along the chosen path before realization of that path is conscious. (B1, 181) III. WHAT CREATES THE BIAS TOWARD THE CHOSEN PATH ? RA: W e can speak only in metaphor. Some love the light. Some love the darkness. It is a matter of the unique and infinitely various Creator choosing and playing among"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"its experiences as a child upon a picnic. Some enjoy the picnic and find the sun beautiful, the food delicious and glow with the joy of creation. Some find the night delicious, their picnic being pain, difficulty, sufferings of others and the examination of the perversities of nature. These enjoy a different picnic. All these experiences are available. It is the free will of each entity which chooses the form of play. (B1, 181) RA: Your 3rd density experience is distorted or skewed so that the positive orientation has more aid than the so-called negative. (B4, 204) IV. THE DEPENDENCE OF BOTH POLARITIES ON THE VEIL QUESTION: The very nature of the service-to-self distortions that create the negative path are a function of the veil and depend on at least a partial continued veiling. Is this correct? (B4, 204) RA: THE POLARITIES OF BOTH PATHS ARE DEPENDENT UPON A LIMITED VIEW POINT. (1) Negative Polarity The negative polarity depends more heavily upon the illusory separation between the self and all other mind/body/spirit complexes. (B4, 204) (2) Positive Polarity The positive polarity attempts to see through the illusion to the Creator in each mind/body/spirit complex, but for the greater part is concerned with behaviors and thoughts directed toward otherselves in order to be of service. This attitude, in itself, is full of the stuff of your 3rd density illusion. (B4, 204) V. CHANGING PATHS      QUESTION: I assume that an entity on either path can decide to change paths at any time, the path changing being more difficult the later along the path the change is made. Is this correct? RA. This is incorrect. The further an entity has polarized, the more easily this entity may change polarity, for the more power and awareness the entity will have. (B1, 181) VI. CHOOSING IN MORE SUBTLE SITUATIONS QUESTION: The average lifespan dropped due to the intensification of a lack of service to others? Is this correct? RA: This is in part correct. By the end of the 2nd cycle the law of Responsibility had become effective. Entities had discovered many ways to indicate bellicose nature, not only as tribes or nations but also in relationships. Barter had given away to the concept of money. The concept of ownership had won ascendancy over the concept of non-ownership. Each entity then was offered many more subtle ways of demonstrating either service toward others or service toward self through manipulation of others. (B1, 197) 44. ENTITIES OF NEGATIVE POLARIZATION I. THE ELITE GROUP SEEKS TO ENSLAVE ALL OTHERS RA: Consider a simple example of bad/good intentions, namely Adolf Hitler. The intention was to presumably unify by choosing the distortion complex called \"elite” (the Nazis) from a social memory complex (the German people) and then enslaving, by various effects, those who are seen by the distortion"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"as non-elite. The Orion group added to that the distortion thought of empire (i.e., conquer other countries). (B1, 100) QUESTION: What is the purpose of the Orion group? RA: Their purpose is conquest. (B1, 102) RA: The negative polarization is greatly aided by the subjugation or enslavement of otherselves. The entity which enslaves the other or is able to dominate the other gains in negative polarity. The other-self loses negative polarity but it will gain in its desire for further negative polarization. (B3, 33) RA: In negative thinking there is always the pecking order, and the power against power in separation. (B3, 82-83) QUESTION: Assuming that a single negatively oriented entity is responsible for the recruiting of a harvested 3rd density entity and adds its polarity to his negative polarity and power, what type of benefit is this and how is it used by the entity? (B4, 108) RA: The so-called pecking order within the negative group is immediately challenged. The entity with more power exercises that power to control more other-selves. QUESTION: How is that power measured? RA: In some cases there is a kind of battle, a battle of wills. The weapons consist of the light that can be formed by each contender. In most cases where the shift of power has been obvious it is simply acknowledged. (B4, 108) II. THEY PROGRAM THEIR INCARNATION FOR HEALTH, WEALTH, POWER AND CONTROL RA: The negatively oriented entity will program for maximal separation from and control overall those things and conscious entities it perceives as other than the self. (B3, 28) RA: A negatively oriented individual mind/body/spirit complex will ordinarily program (his next incarnation) for wealth, ease of existence and the utmost opportunity for power. Thus many negative entities burst with the physical complex distortion you call heath. However, it may choose a polarized condition in order to improve the distortion towards negative states such as anger, hatred and frustration. Such an entity may use an entire incarnative experience honing a blunt edge of hatred or anger so that it may polarize more towards the negative or separated pole. (B3, 28) III. THEY ARE PROTECTED FROM OTHERS ACCORDING TO THEIR LEVEL RA: There are those on the negative path who take great care in the preservation of the distortion your peoples perceive as fairness/ugliness. This fairness (i.e. beauty) is, of course, then used to manipulate other-selves. (B4, 103) RA: Those who choose separation, that being the quality most indicative of the negative path, are protected from other-selves by a strength equivalent to their degree of transformation which the mind has"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"experienced in the negative sense. Those on the positive path have no such protection against other-selves for upon that path the seeker encounters mirrors for reflection in each other-self it encounters. (B4, 201) IV. THE NEGATIVE RAY PATTERN OMITS GREEN RAY (LOVE) RA: The negative ray pattern is the red/orange/yellow moving directly to the blue, this (blue) being used only to contact intelligent infinity. (B2, 78) RA: The 4th density entity is aware of the full array of possible methods of viewing the universe of the One Creator and it is convinced that the ignoring and non-use of the green-ray energy center will be the method most efficient in providing harvestability of 4th density. (B4, 107) RA: The service-to-self choice is one which denies the very center of the spectrum, that being universal love. Therefore all that is built is based on an omission. This omission shall manifest in 4th density as the love of self; that is, the fullest expression of the orange and yellow energy centers which are then used to potentiate adepthood. When 5th density has been achieved, the wisdom density is explored by entities which have no compassion, no universal love. THEY EXPERIENCE THAT WHICH THEY WISH BY FREE CHOICE, BEING OF THE EARNEST OPINION THAT GREEN-RAY ENERGY IS FOLLY. (B4, 91) RA: That which is not may be seen as a self-imposed darkness in which harmony is changed into a continuing disharmony. However, that which is not cannot endure throughout the octave and as darkness eventually calls the light, so does that which is not eventually call that which is. (B4, 92) V. THEIR USE OF ANGER QUESTION: If an entity polarizes toward the service-to-self path, would anger have the same physical effect that it would have on the entity polarizing on the service-to-others path? Would it cause cancer for example? RA: The catalytic mechanisms are not dependent on which polarity is chosen but on the use to which this catalyst is put. The entity which uses anger to polarize consciously on the positive or negative path does not experience the bodily catalyst but uses the catalyst in mental configuration. (B2, 108) RA: The negatively oriented entity will funnel this energy into a practical means of venting the negative aspect of this emotion so as to obtain control over other-self or otherwise control the situation causing anger. CONTROL IS THE KEY TO NEGATIVELY POLARIZED USE OF CATALYST. ACCEPTANCE IS THE KEY TO POSITIVELY POLARIZED USE OF CATALYST. BETWEEN THESE POLARITIES LIES THE POTENTIAL FOR THE CANCEROUS GROW TH OF TISSUE. (B2, 108) QUESTION: Then if a negatively polarized entity is unable to control his own anger, he may get cancer. Is that correct? RA: This is correct. The negative polarization contains a great requirement for control and repression."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Emotion, which is of itself disorganized, needs to be repressed and then brought to the surface in an organized use in order to be useful to a negatively polarized entity. For example, negative entities may control and repress sexual desire in order that in the practice thereof, the will of the entity may be used to enforce itself upon the other-self with greater efficiency when the sexual behavior is allowed. (B2, 109) VI. THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SEPARATION AND SPIRITUAL ENTROPY RA: In the Orion group there are a very few 3rd density, a larger number of 4th density, a similarly large number of 5th density, and very few of 6th density. Their numbers are perhaps one tenth of ours as the problem of spiritual entropy causes them to experience constant disintegration of their social memory complexes. Their power is the same as ours. THE LAW OF ONE BLINKS AT NEITHER THE LIGHT OR THE DARKNESS, BUT IS AVAILABLE FOR SERVICE TO SELF AS W ELL AS SERVICE TO OTHERS. (B1, 100) Those seeking intelligent infinity through the use of service to self create the same amount of power but have constant difficulty because of the concept of separation which is implicit in seeking power over others. (B1, 100) RA: Only very rarely is the social memory complex of negative polarity capable of acting totally as one being. The loss of polarity due to spiritual entropy is quite large. (B4, 108) VII. THE LAW OF ONE IS AVAILABLE TO EITHER PATH RA: It should be noted, and carefully pondered, and accepted, that the Law of One is available to any social memory complex striving together for any goal, be it service to others or service to self. The laws are placed into operation and the illusion of space/time is used as a medium for the development of the results of the choices freely made. Thus all entities learn, no mater what they seek. (B1, 100) RA: THOSE W HICH HAVE CHOSEN THE SERVICE-TO-SELF PATH HAVE SIMPLY USED THE VEILING PROCESS IN ORDER TO POTENTIATE THAT W HICH IS NOT. THIS IS AN ENTIRELY ACCEPTABLE METHOD OF SELF- KNOW LEDGE OF AND BY THE CREATOR. (B4, 91) VIII. THE SPIRITUAL POWER OF THE NEGATIVE ENTITY QUESTION: When the negative entity increases his power, for example through removing light, what kind of power is it? RA: The power of which you speak is a spiritual power. The powers of the mind do not encompass such works as these. Consider the possibilities of moonlight. You are aware that we have described the Matrix of the Spirit as a Night. (B4, 49) - Earlier: RA: The Matrix of the Spirit is what you may cal the Night of the Soul or Primeval Darkness. The Potentiator of the Spirit is light in its sudden and fiery form; i.e., lightning itself. (B4, 27) The moonlight, then, offers either a true picture seen in shadow or a chimera and falsity. The power of falsity is as deep as is the power to discern truth from shadow. The shadow of hidden things is an infinite depth in which is stored the power of the"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"One Infinite Creator. The negative adept, then, is working with the power of hidden things (only partially) illuminated (and seen in a way) that can be false or true. To embrace falsity, to know it, and to seek it, and to use it gives a power that is most great. This is the nature of the power of the visitor. This may shed some light upon the power of one who seeks to serve others, for the missteps in the night are oh! so easy. (B4, 49) RA: The relationship of a 5th density negative to 4th density negative entities is one of the more powerful and the less powerful. Thus 4th density negative entities are willing slaves of such a 5th density entity, there being no doubt whatsoever of the relative power of each. (B4, 106) RA: ANY ORGANIZATION W HICH DEMANDS OBEDIENCE W ITHOUT QUESTION UPON THE BASIS OF RELATIVE POW ER IS FUNCTIONING ACCORDING TO THE ABOVE DESCRIBED PLAN. (B4, 106) IX. AMOUNT OF ILLNESS ON A 3RD DENSITY NEGATIVE PLANET QUESTION: Is physical disease and illness rather widespread on a 3rd density negative planet before harvest into 4th density negative? RA: They are less likely to be found as 4th density negative begins to be a probable choice of harvest. Much more care is taken of the physical body as well as more discipline being offered to the self mentally. This is an orientation of great self-interest and self-discipline. (B3, 123) X. THE PROGRESSION OF NEGATIVE ENTITIES INTO THE 4TH DENSITY RA: The negatively polarized entity achieves harvest due to extremely efficient use of red and yellow/orange (energy centers), moving directly to the gateway indigo (inner eye chakra). It brings the in-streamings of intelligent infinity through this intelligent energy channel. (B2, 112) QUESTION: As our cycle ends and graduation occurs, is it possible for anyone to go from a 3rd density to a 4th density planet that is of a self-service or negative type? RA: That is correct. (B1, 117) QUESTION: Has this happened to anyone well known in our history? RA: The number of entities thus harvested is small. However, a few have penetrated the 8th level. Penetration of the 8th level or intelligent infinity level allows the entity to be harvested if it wishes at any time during the cycle. Examples are, Taras Bulba, Genghis Khan, and Rasputin. (B1, 117- 118) QUESTION: How do these negative entities get to 4th density? RA: They were aware through memory of Atlantean understandings having to do with the use of various centers of mind/body/spirit complex energy influx in attaining the gateway to intelligent infinity. (B1, 118) QUESTION: Could they do paranormal things while incarnate? RA: That is correct. The first two made little use of theses abilities but they were bent single- mindedly upon service to self. All three of them are now in the 4th density. Each chose a 4th density planet which was dedicated to the pursuit of the understanding of the law of One through service to self. One is in the Orion group. (B1, 118) RA: The one you speak of as Genghis Khan is incarnated in a physical light body distributing material on thought control to those you would call crusaders, i.e., a shipping clerk. These crusaders move in their chariots to conquer planetary social complexes before they reach the stage of achieving social memory. (B1, 119) XI. HOW DO NEGATIVE ENTITIES PROGRESS FROM 4TH TO 5TH DENSITY ?"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"RA: The graduation into 4th density negative is achieved by those beings who have consciously contacted intelligent infinity through the use of red, orange and yellow rays of energy. (B2, 73) RA: The 5th density is harvested from the 4th density who are in turn harvested from 3rd density. Those not oriented towards seeking service for others can use the gateway to intelligent infinity. The beings are harvested because they can see and enjoy the light/love of the appropriate density. Those who have found this without benefit of a desire for service to others nevertheless, by the law of Free Will, have the right to the use of that light/love for whatever purpose. There are systems of study which enable the seeker of separation to gain these gateways. The distortion lies in the effect that THOSE WHO SEEK TO SERVE THE SELF ARE SEEN BY THE LAW OF ONE AS PRECISELY THE SAME AS THOSE W HO SEEK TO SERVE OTHERS, FOR ARE NOT ALL ONE? TO SERVE YOURSELF AND TO SERVE OTHERS IS A DUAL METHOD OF SAYING THE SAME THING, IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE ESSENCE OF THE LAW OF ONE. (B1, 101) The ability to love, accept and use a certain intensity of light thus creates the requirement for both positive and negative 4th to 5th density harvesting. (B2, 113) XII. NEGATIVE ENTITIES IN THE 5TH DENSITY RA: The 5th density is the density of light or wisdom. The so-called negative service-to-self entity in this density is at a high level of awareness and wisdom and has ceased activity except by thought. The 5th density negative is extraordinarily compacted and separated from all else. (B1, 215) RA: Orion members do not perceive any virtue in other selves. Therefore there are very, very few 5th density Orion members. (B2, 120) QUESTION: What does a 5th density negative entity look like? RA: 5 th density beings are very light beings although they do have the type of physical vehicle which you understand. 5th density negative beings are very fair to look upon in your standard of beauty. But there is little or no means of perceiving such an entity. (B3, 84) XIII. ARE THERE ANY 6TH DENSITY NEGATIVELY POLARIZED WANDERERS IN OUR PAST? RA: This information could be harmful. We withhold it. Please attempt to view the entities about you as part of the Creator. (B2, 67) XIV. THERE ARE NO NEGATIVE HIGHER SELVES RA: There are no negative beings that have obtained the Higher Self manifestation. (B2, 66) XV. NEGATIVE SIXTH DENSITY ENTITIES SWITCH TO THE POSITIVE PATH RA: As the 6th density approaches, the negative orientation is thrown into confusion and little space travel is attempted. (B3, 13) RA: These negatively oriented mind/body/spirit complexes have a difficulty which to our knowledge has never been overcome, for after 5th density graduation wisdom is available but it must be matched with an equal amount of love. This is difficult to do for negatively oriented entities so they will choose to release the negativity and leap into 6th density positive. (B2, 66) RA: The 6th density negative entity is extremely wise. It observes the spiritual entropy occurring due to the lack of ability to express the unity of the 6th density. THUS, LOVING THE CREATOR AND REALIZING AT SOME POINT THAT THE CREATOR IS NOT ONLY SELF BUT OTHER-SELF AS SELF, THIS ENTITY CONSCIOUSLY CHOOSES AN INSTANTANEOUS"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"ENERGY REORIENTATION SO THAT IT CAN CONTINUE ITS EVOLUTION. (B2, 66) XVI. ORION'S 1ST SERIOUS INROAD INTO HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS RA: The Yahweh group worked with those living on Mars 75,000 years ago to make the body bigger and stronger through a new genetic coding. (B1, 174) RA: However, the Orion group were able to use this distortion (larger body) to teach the thoughts of the elite. Those of the Orion group were able for the first time to make serious inroads upon the consciousness of the planetary complex. (B1, 175) QUESTION: What allowed the Orion group to succeed at this? RA: Those who are strong, intelligent, etc. have a temptation to feel different from those who are less intelligent and strong. This allowed the Orion group to form the concept of the holy war, as you may call it. This is a seriously distorted perception. There were many of these wars of a destructive nature. (B1, 175) XVII. HOW DOES ORION USE MIND CONTROL TO ENSLAVE POPULATIONS ? RA: The most typical approach of Orion entities is to choose what you might call the weaker- minded entity that it might suggest a greater amount of Orion philosophy to be disseminated. (B3, 21) RA: A mistaken Orion contact with highly polarized positive entities can wreak havoc with Orion troops unless these Crusaders are able to depolarize the entity mistakenly contacted. This occurrence is almost unheard of. THEREFORE THE ORION GROUP PREFERS TO MAKE CONTACT ONLY W ITH THE WEAKER-MINDED ENTITY. (B3, 21) RA: They follow the law of one, observing free will. Contact is made with those who call. Those contacted disseminate the philosophy of their particular understanding of the law of One which is service to self. These become the elite. THEY (THE ELITE) BEGIN TO CREATE CONDITIONS W HEREBY THE REMAINDER OF THE POPULATION IS ENSLAVED BY THEIR FREE W ILL. Technology is provided by this group in the form of various methods of control or manipulation of others to serve the self. (B1, 119-120) QUESTION: You mean that some scientists receive technical information telepathically that results in usable gadgetry? (B1, 120) RA: That is correct. [Note: Studies of the effects of electromagnetic fields on human consciousness are well known but rarely discussed.] QUESTION: What non-technical information do they give? RA: Through telepathy the philosophy of the Law of One with the distortion of service to self is promulgated. In advanced groups there are exercises and rituals given. (B1, 125) XVIII. WHAT ABOUT THE ABDUCTIONS AND PHYSICAL EXAMS ? RA: The Orion group uses the physical examination as a means of terrifying the individual causing it to feel the feelings of an advanced 2nd density being such as a laboratory anima1. The sexual experiences are a sub-type of this experience. THE INTENT IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE CONTROL OF THE ORION ENTITIES OVER THE TERRAN INHABITANT. The thought-form experiences are subjective and, for the most part, do not occur in this density (B3, 21)"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"XIX. ORION'S METHODS IN THE 1ST CYCLE QUESTION: What is an example of Orion's early methods? RA: In the 1st 25,000-year cycle the Orion group tried (unsuccessfully) using statues of stone in your Pacific areas and in the Central American areas. (B1, 189) QUESTION: The stone heads of Easter Island? RA: That is correct. QUESTION: Did the Orion entities land or do it from mental planes? (B1, 189) RA: They were constructed at a distance by thought. QUESTION: How would these heads influence people to take up the path of service to self? {B1, 189) RA: Picture, if you will, entities living in such away that their mind/body/spirit complexes seem to be at the mercy of forces they cannot control. Given a statue or rock formation charged with power, it is possible for those viewing this structure to ascribe to this power the power of nature, Then this has the potential for further distortion to power over others. (B1, 189-190) XX. ARE THERE ANY ORION ENTITIES LIVING ON EARTH NOW? RA: No. However, the crusaders from Orion use two types of entities to do their bidding. The first is a thought form; the second, a kind of robot. (B1, 126) QUESTION: Is the robot what is normally called the 'Men in Black'? RA: This is incorrect. The Men in Black are a thought-form type of entity which have some beingness to their makeup. They have certain physical characteristics given them. They are able to materialize and dematerialize when necessary. (B1, 126) XXI. NEGATIVE ENTITIES IN THE INNER PLANES OF 3RD DENSITY RA: Temptations are offered by those negative entities of what you would call your inner planes. These, shall we say, dark angels have been impressed by the service-to-self path offered by those who have come through the quarantine from days of old. (B1, 135) XXII. DO POSITIVE ENTITIES EVER CALL ON THOSE FROM ORION? QUESTION: Is it possible for a person to be confused and call on both the Confederation and the Orion group? RA: It is entirety possible. Many of your so-called contacts among your peoples have been confused and self destructive because THE CHANNELS W ERE ORIENTED TOW ARDS SERVICE TOW ARDS OTHERS, BUT, IN THE DESIRE FOR PROOF , W ERE OPEN TO THE LYING INFORMATION OF THE CRUSADERS FROM ORION W HO W ERE THEN ABLE TO NEUTRALIZE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CHANNEL (B1, 125) XXII. DAYDREAMS QUESTION: If I were to daydream strongly about building a ship, would this occur in one of the other densities? (B1, 158) RA: This would, or would have, or shall occur. (B1, 158)"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"QUESTION: Does the Orion group use this principle to create conditions favorable to their purpose? RA: The Orion group uses daydreams of hostile or other negative natures to strengthen these thought-forms. (B1, 159) XXIII. WHY DO THE CRUSADERS FROM ORION DO THIS ? RA: To serve the self is to serve all. But the service of the self, when seen in this perspective, requires an ever-expanding use of the energies of others for the manipulation to the benefit of the self with distortion towards power. (B1, 122) RA: THE NEGATIVELY ORIENTED BEING W ILL BE ONE W HO FEELS THAT IT HAS FOUND POW ER THAT GIVES MEANING TO ITS EXISTENCE PRECISELY AS THE POSITIVE POLARIZATION DOES FEEL. (B2, 130) RA: This negative entity will strive to offer these understandings to the other-selves, most usually by the process of forming the elite, the disciples, and teaching the need and rightness of the enslavement of other-selves for their own good. These other- selves are conceived to be dependent upon the self and in need of the wisdom and guidance of the self (i.e., the elite group.) (B2, 130) 45. PSYCHIC GREETINGS BY NEGATIVELY ORIENTED ENTITIES (Carla was under psychic attack during most of the trance channeling) I. THE PROCESS RA. The 5th density negative entity becomes aware of power emerging into the 3rd density. This power has the capacity of energizing those 3rd density entities which may be available for harvest. This negative entity is desirous of disabling this power source. It sends its 4th density legions. Temptations are offered to one's ego. If they are ignored, the entity decides that it must attempt the disabling itself. IT IS BOUND BY THE 1ST DISTORTION BUT MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY FREE W ILL DISTORTION. THE FREE-W ILL, PRE-INCARNATIVE DISTORTIONS OF THE INSTRUMENT W ITH REGARDS TO THE PHYSICAL VEHICLE SEEM THE MOST PROMISING TARGET. (B3, 140) II. SEE \"ATTACKS” BY 4TH AND 5TH DENSITY NEGATIVE ENTITIES AS PSYCHIC GREETINGS A. SEE THE CREATOR IN ALL ENTITIES JIM MCCARTY: 'If one wishes to see such a greeting as a difficult attack, then that becomes the experience. However, one can choose to see the Creator in all entities and events, and also can praise and seek the light within any situation. Then that will tend to become the experience. (B5, 47) B. 4TH DENSITY ENTITIES CAN ONLY USE THE EGO TO AFFECT US RA: The 5th density sees the difficulty posed by the light (i.e., this group channeling Ra) and directs 4th density negative entities to seek targets of opportunity for attacking the group. If 4th density temptations toward distortions of the ego are not successful, the 5th density entity then thinks in terms of the removal of the light (i.e., making Carla's body unviable). (B3, 84) RA: 4th density entities lack the subtlety and magical practice which the 5th density experience offers. (B1, 106)"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"C. GREETINGS FROM 5TH DENSITY ENTITIES ARE RARE QUESTION: Isn't it unusual that a 5th density negative entity would do this (attack Carla) rather than sending a 4th density servant? (B3, 85) RA: This is correct. NEARLY ALL POSITIVE CHANNELS AND GROUPS MAY BE LESSENED IN THEIR POSITIVITY OR RENDERED QUITE USELESS BY WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL THE TEMPTATIONS OFFERED BY THE 4TH DENSITY NEGATIVE THOUGHT FORMS. They may suggest many distortions. THEY SUGGEST DISTORTIONS TOW ARDS THE AGGRANDIZEMENT OF THE SELF OR TOW ARDS THE FLOW ERING OF THE ORGANIZATION IN SOME POLITICAL, SOCIAL OR FISCAL W AY. THESE DISTORTIONS REMOVE THE FOCUS FROM THE ONE INFINITE SOURCE OF LOVE AND LIGHT of which we are all messengers; humble and knowing that we, of ourselves, are but the tiniest portion of the Creator, a small part of a magnificent entirety of infinite intelligence. (B3, 85) D. 5TH DENSITY ENTITIES ARE MORE ABLE TO PENETRATE THE QUARANTINE RA: This 5th density entity is able to penetrate in time/space configuration the field of this particular entity (Carla). It has moved through the quarantine without any vehicle and thus has been more able to escape detection by the net of Guardians. (B3, 130) E. 5TH DENSITY CONSCIOUSNESSES CAN UTILIZE THE POWER OF SUGGESTION DIRECTLY IN THE MIND RA: Consciousness is sent forth without vehicle as light. The light would work instantly upon an untuned individual by suggestion, that is the stepping out in front of the traffic because the suggestion is that there is no traffic. This entity (Carla), as each in this group, is enough disciplined in the ways of love and light that it is not suggestible to any great extent. However, there is a predisposition of Carla's physical body which this negative entity is making maximal use of it is hoping, for instance, by means of increasing dizziness, to cause the Carla to fall or to indeed to walk in front of your traffic because of impaired vision. (B3, 130) F. THEY CAN ONLY \"ATTACK” THROUGH PRE-EXISTING DISTORTIONS RA: You may expect this psychic attack to be constant as this instrument has been under observation by negatively oriented entities for some time. The attack now is in the area of the kidneys and urinary tract. There is also distortion in the form of arthritis. (B3, 87) QUESTION: Is there anything we can do to alleviate this attack? RA: No, but understanding its mechanism might be of aid. The Orion group cannot interfere directly but only through preexisting distortions of mind/body/spirit complexes. (B3, 42) G. ONE DAY THE INTENSITY OF THE 'ATTACKS' ON CARLA INCREASED QUESTION: Can you tell me the reason for the intensification of this psychic attack? RA: The cause is the intensive seeking for what you may call enlightenment. The seeking upon your parts has not abated, but intensified. (B3, 148) QUESTION: What was the Orion entity's objective with respect to this entity (Carla)? RA: The Orion entity wishes to remove the instrument (Carla). (B3, 187)"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" QUESTION: Is this a 4th or 5th density entity? RA: The instrument is being greeted by a 5th density Orion entity which has lost some of its polarity due to its lack of dictatorship over the disposition of the instrument's body. (B3, 187) RA: CARLA HAS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF AN ORION LIGHT BEING. THIS IS EXTREMELY RARE. (B3, 186-187) III. AN EXTREMELY RARE POSSIBILITY: BEING SWITCHED TO NEGATIVE POLARITY A. IT'S ONLY HAPPENED ONCE IN THIS MASTER CYCLE RA: The plan is to take the mind/body/spirit complex, while it was separated from its yellow body complex shell, and then place it within the negative portions of your time/space (the metaphysical realm). The shell (physical body) would die and the Higher Self would have the choice of leaving the mind/body/spirit complex in negative time/space or of allowing incarnation with negative polarity. Thus the entity would become a negatively polarized entity without the advantage of native negative polarization. It would find a long path to the Creator under these circumstances although the path would eventually end well. (B3, 137-138) RA: When the instrument leaves the physical vehicle, it does so freely. Thus the misplacement of the mind would not be a violation of its free will if the instrument followed the negative entity willingly. (B3, 140) QUESTION: Why would the instrument follow the negatively polarized entity to the place of negative time/space? W hy would one of us freely follow the negative entity? RA: The positive polarity sees love in all things. The negative polarity is clever. (B3, 140) QUESTION: How many Wanderers here have experienced this displacement into negative time/space? RA: There has been only one. (B3, 145)    QUESTION: IF THE NEGATIVE POLARITY USED ANY OTHER APPROACH THAT DID NOT USE THE FREE WILL OF THE OTHER-SELF, HE WOULD LOSE POLARIZATION AND MAGICAL POWER. IS THIS CORRECT? RA: THIS IS CORRECT. (B3, 140-141) B. IT REQUIRES A TRANCE-STATE-CONTACT WITH A SOCIAL MEMORY COMPLEX RA: You inquire why the negative friends are not able to remove an entity into negative time/space at the death experience. This is largely because the entity without the attachment to the space/time physical complex (the body) is far more aware and without the gullibility which is somewhat the hallmark of those who love wholeheartedly. QUESTION: Why is the trance state different? Why are there not protective entities available in this particular state? RA: The unique characteristic here is the willing of the mind/body/spirit complex outward from the physical complex of 3rd density for the purpose of service-to-others. (B3, 143) RA: The uniqueness of this situation is not the lack of friends, guides, angelic presences, etc. The unique characteristic of the workings which the social memory complex Ra and your group have begun is the intent to serve others with the highest attempt at near purity which we as comrades may achieve. This has alerted a much more"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"determined entity of negative polarity which is interested in removing this particular opportunity (i.e. this group.) (B3, 132) IV. CARLA WAS MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO ATTACK WHILE IN THE TRANCE STATE QUESTION: When a 6th density Wanderer is in what we call the trance state, leaving the 3rd density physical, he does not have the full capability to magically defend himself. Is that right? RA: In the case of the instrument Carla this is correct. It is also correct when applied almost without exception to those instruments working in trance which have not consciously experienced magical training in time/space in the present incarnation. The entities of your density capable of magical defense in this situation are extremely rare. (B3, 139) V. ATTACKS ON THE OTHERS IN THE GROUP WERE MOST UNSUCCESSFUL QUESTION: Is this so-called attack offered to myself and Jim as well as to Carla? RA: That is correct. QUESTION: I personally have felt no effect that I am aware of. RA: The questioner has been offered the service of doubting the self and of becoming disheartened over various distortions of a personal nature. The questioner has not chosen to use these opportunities, and the Orion entity has basically ceased to be interested in maintaining constant surveillance of this entity (the questioner). (B3, 132) VI. WHY WAS CARLA GREETED SO OFTEN ? QUESTION: The 5th density negative visitor is dead set against our communication with Ra. Can you tell me why this is so important to him since it will have a very limited effect, I would guess, on the harvest of this planet. (B4, 48) RA: The fidelity of Ra to remove distortions is total. The instrument through which we speak and its support group have a similar fidelity. The questions have led rapidly into somewhat abstruse regions of commentary. This content does not lesson the underlying purity. Such purity is as a light. Such an intensity of light attracts attention. (B4, 48) QUESTION: What does the 5th density negative visitor hope to gain from all this? RA: The entity hopes to gain a portion of the light, that is, the mind/body/spirit, of the instrument. Earning this, the entity intends to put out the light. (B4, 48) RA: The gain for the negative entity is an increase in negative polarity because it has removed a source of radiance and thereby, offered to this space/time the opportunity of darkness where once there was light. In the event that it succeeded in enslaving the mind/body/spirit complex of the instrument it would have enslaved a fairly powerful entity, thus adding to its power. (B4, 49) VII. RA'S COMMENT ON HOW TO VIEW THE NEGATIVE ENTITY TRYING TO REMOVE CARLA RA: Upon the many other planes of existence there are those whose every fiber rejoices at service and there are those such as the entity responsible for the psychic attacks which wish only to terminate the life upon the 3rd density plane of this instrument (Carla.) All are the Creator. There is only one vast panoply of biases and distortions, colors and hues, in an unending pattern. In the case of those with whom you are not in resonance, you wish them love, light, joy and bid them well. No more than this can you do,"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"FOR YOUR PORTION OF THE CREATOR IS AS IT IS. YOUR EXPERIENCE AND OFFERING OF EXPERIENCE, TO BE VALUABLE, NEEDS BE MORE AND MORE A PERFECT REPRESENTATION OF W HO YOU TRULY ARE. Could you, then, serve a negative entity by offering the instrument's life (i.e., offering Carla's physical form to die so it can be destroyed)? It is unlikely that you would find this a true service. Thus you will see, in many cases, the loving balance being achieved. Love is offered, light being sent. THE SERVICE OF THE SERVICE-TO-SELF ORIENTED ENTITY IS GRATEFULLY ACKNOWLEDGED, WHILE BEING REJECTED AS NOT BEING USEFUL IN YOUR JOURNEY AT THIS TIME. THUS YOU SERVE ONE CREATOR WITHOUT PARADOX. (B3, 129-130) VIII. IS THE 1ST DISTORTION WHAT ALLOWS THE PSYCHIC ATTACK ON CARLA? QUESTION: How did the 5th density negative entity who attacked Carla penetrated the quarantine? RA: This was done through a very slight window which less magically oriented entities could not have used to advantage. (B3, 131) QUESTION: Why did the window exist? Does it have to do with the 1st distortion (free will)? Ate we experiencing the same type of balancing in receiving the offerings of this entity as the planet as a whole receives? RA: This is precisely correct. As the planetary sphere accepts more highly evolved positive entities or groups with information to offer, the same opportunity must be offered to similarly wise negatively oriented entities. (B3, 131) QUESTION: All of this is a result of the at distortion in creating a totally free atmosphere for the Creator to become more knowledgeable of Itself through the interplay of its portions, one with respect to another. Is this correct? (B3, 166) RA: That is correct. 46. HOW TO RESPOND TO ENTITIES OF NEGATIVE POLARIZATION HOW CAN THESE EFFECTS BE NULLIFIED ? A. MEDITATE IN A STATE OF LOVE FOR THE NEGATIVE ONES RA: To meditate in love for these senders of images and light is the most available means of nullifying the effects of such occurrences. To downgrade these experiences by the use of the intellect or will is to invite the prolonging of the effects. Far better to share such experiences and join hearts and souls in love and light with compassion for the sender and with armor for the self. (B5, 75) B. LOVE THEM AS THE DARK SIDE OF YOURSELF Carla Rueckert: “To look on these experiences of being “attacked” as less than vitally important was to invite their prolongation, when faced and given full consideration, without fear, just being with these energies and loving them, seeing them as the dark side of oneself, the greetings were simply experiences to have and to ponder, working toward the acceptance of the full self. To embrace the greeting as coming from the self and as loved by the self, was to draw its teeth and neutralize its venom.” (B5, 72) RA: Send them love, light, peace and joy, and bid them well. (B3, 129) APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER LIGHT AND LOVE"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"QUESTION: Then we experience in this seeming difficulty the wisdom of the 1 st distortion and therefore must fully accept what we experience. Is this correct? (B3, 131) RA: In our view we would perhaps go further. One can express appreciation of this opportunity. This is an intensive opportunity, and as it affects the instrument’s (Carla’s) distortions toward pain and dizziness, it enables the instrument to continuously choose to serve others and to serve the Creator. Similarly it offers a continual opportunity for each in the group to express support and demonstrate the light and love of the Infinite Creator. (B3, 132) ACCEPT A POLARIZED AND BALANCED POSITION QUESTION: There is no other service at this time that we can offer this fifth density Orion entity. Is that correct? RA: That is correct. There is a natural difficulty in being of service to this entity since what you consider service is considered non-service by this entity. AS YOU SEND THIS ENTITY LOVE AND LIGHT AND W ISH IT WELL, IT LOSES ITS POLARITY AND NEEDS TO REGROUP. On the other hand, if you allowed it to be of service by removing Carla from your midst you might perhaps perceive this as not being of service. You have here a balanced and polarized view of the Creator; two services rendered, mutually rejected, and in a state of equilibrium in which free will is preserved and each allowed to go upon its own path of experiencing the One Infinite Creation. (B3, 133) DO NOT OFFER SERVICE W HERE NONE IS W ANTED QUESTION: If there is anything we can do for this particular entity, if you would communicate its requests to us we will at last consider them because we would like to serve in every respect. RA: We perceive that we have not been able to clarify your service versus its desire for service. You need, in our humble opinion, to RELINQUISH YOUR DESIRE TO SERVE W HERE NO SERVICE IS REQUESTED. GLORY IN THE STRENGTH OF YOUR POLARITY AND ALLOW OTHERS OF OPPOSITE POLARITY TO SIMILARLY DO SO, seeing the great humor of this polarity in view of the unification in 6 th density of these two paths. (B3, 134) THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY FOR THE GROUP TO END THE PSYCHIC GREETINGS QUESTION: Is there something that the instrument (Carla) could do to eliminate the problems that she has, i.e., the cold feeling of these attacks? (B3, 85) RA: Yes. QUESTION: What? RA: You could cease in your attempts to be channels for the love and the light of the One Infinite Creator. (B3, 85) THERE ARE VARIOUS SAFEGUARDS QUESTION: Carla performs service that involve channeling other members of the Confederation. We are reluctant to continue this because of the possibility of her slipping into trance and being offered the services of the negatively polarized entity. Are there any safeguards to create a"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"situation whereby she cannot go into trance other than at a protected working such as this one? (B3, 146) RA: There are three. The third is a simple means to keep the instrument in its physical complex. The hand may be held. QUESTION: Are you saying that just by holding Carla’s hand during the channeling sessions, this would prevent trance? (B3, 147) RA: That is correct. It prevents those levels of meditation which necessarily precede trance. (B3, 147) FREE WILL DOES NOT GUARANTEE “SMOOTH SAILING ” QUESTION: You mentioned a positively oriented entity that was ‘enticed’ into moving into negatively polarized time/space. I am sure that if the positively oriented entity had full understanding of what he was doing he would not have done it. What philosophical principle is operating here (i.e., is his free will being violated)? (B3, 146) RA: There are two important points here. (1) FIRST, FREE WILL DOES NOT MEAN THAT THERE WILL BE NO CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN CALCULATIONS GO AWRY. THIS IS SO IN ALL OF THE LIFE EXPERIENCE. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO MISTAKES (ACIM WOULD SAY NO SINS), THERE ARE SURPRISES. (B3, 146) (2) Secondly, that which we and you do in working s such as this carries a magical charge, if you would use this much misunderstood term, perhaps we may say a metaphysical power. Those who do work of power are available for communication to and from entities of roughly similar power . It is fortunate that the Orion entity does not have the native power of this group. However it is quite disciplined whereas this group lacks the finesse equivalent to its power. Each is working in consciousness but the group has not begun a work as a group. (B3, 146) 47. THE 10 COMMANDMENTS RA: The origin of the 10 commandments follow the law of negative entities impressing information upon positively oriented mind/body/spirit complexes. The information attempted to copy or ape positive information while retaining negative characteristics. This was done by the Orion group. (B1, 152) QUESTION: What was their purpose in doing this? RA: Their purpose is conquest and enslavement. This is done by establishing an elite and causing others to serve the elite through various devices such as the laws you mentioned. (B1, 152) RA: They created an elite called the Sons of Levi. (B3, 67) QUESTION: Was the recipient of the commandments (Moses) positively or negatively oriented? RA: The recipient was one of extreme positivity. (B1, 152) RA: He (Moses) gave to your planetary peoples the possibility of a path to the One Infinite Creator which is completely positive. (B3, 67) QUESTION: It would be wholly unlike an entity fully aware of the knowledge of the Law of One to ever say, “Thou shalt not”. Is this correct? RA: That is correct. (B1, 152) HOW TO W IN THE GAME"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"RA: Consider the example of a man who sees all the poker hands. He then knows the game. It is but child’s play to gamble, for there is no risk. In time/space and in the true color green density, the hands of all are open to the eye. The thoughts, the feelings, the troubles, all these may be seen. There is no deception and no desire for deception. Thus much may be accomplished in harmony but the mind/body/spirit gains little polarity from the interaction. In a lifetime the cards are love, dislike, limitation, unhappiness, pleasure, etc. They are dealt and re-dealt continuously. You may, during this incarnation begin to know your own cards. You may begin to find the love within you. You may begin to balance your pleasure, your limitations, etc. However your only indication of other-selves cards is to look into the eyes. You cannot remember your hand, their hands, perhaps even the rules of the game. This game can be won only by those who lose their cards in the melting influence of love. It can only be won by those who lay their pleasures, their limitations, their all upon the table face up and say inwardly: “All, all of you players, each other-self, whatever your hand, I love you.\" This is the game: to know, to accept, to forgive, to balance, and to open the self in love. This cannot be done without the forgetting, for it would carry no weight in the life of the mind/body/spirit being-ness totality. (B2, 133) ADONAI RA: We leave you in appreciation of the circumstances of the great illusion in which you now choose to play the pipe and timbrel and move in rhythm. We are also players upon a stage. The stage changes. The acts ring down. The lights come up once again. And throughout the grand illusion and the following and the following there is the undergirding majesty of the One Infinite Creator. All is well. Nothing is lost. Go forth rejoicing in the love and light, the peace and the lower of the One Infinite Creator. I am Ra. Adonai. (B5, 175) MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS 48. THE POWER OF CRYSTALS, PYRAMIDS AND CERTAIN SOUNDS I. USING CRYSTALS RA: There are crystals that work on the energies coming into the spiritual body, there are crystals which work on the distortions from spirit to mind and through which balance the distortions between the mind and body. Without the relative crystallization of the healer working with the crystal, the crystal will not be properly charged. The other ingredient is the proper alignment with the energy fields of the planet. (B1, 72) QUESTION. Can intelligent energy be tapped and brought into the physical illusion by working through the crystalline structure? RA: This is correct only in so far as the crystalline physical structure is charged by a correspondingly crystallized or regularized or balanced mind/body/spirit complex. (B2, 21) RA: The uses of the crystal include the use for betting for power, and even for the development of lifeforms. We feel it is unwise to offer instruction on how to develop lifeforms at this time as your"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"peoples live shown a tendency to use peaceful devices of power for disharmonious reasons. (B2, 23) - Note: However, information on this is given in (B3, 43) II. USING A SMALL PYRAMID SHAPE A. THE PYRAMID SHAPE CATCHES PRANA RA: The pyramid shape is a collector which draws that in-streaming energy from the bottom or base, and allows this energy to spiral upward in a line with the apex. The energy is not Earth energy, but is light energy which is omni-present. (B3, 55) RA: The pyramid shape is an arrangement for the centralization of the spiraling upward light energy. The magnetic fields of an individual are affected by this spiraling energy. Certain shapes intensify the spiraling prana, the all-present, primal distortion of the One Infinite Creator. Vaulted and conical shapes (like your tepees) also intensify spiraling light. Your eaves, being rounded, are places of power due to this shaping. (B3, 39) B. SIT ABOVE THE PYRAMID FOR NO MORE THAN 30 MINUTES PER DAY RA: The small pyramid shape, placed beneath a portion of the body complex may energize the body complex. This should be done for brief periods only, not to exceed 30 of your minutes. (B3, 46) QUESTION: Would the pyramid shape be placed beneath the bed? (B3, 48) RA: That is correct. It may be placed directly beneath the cushion (presumably the pillow) upon which the body complex rests. W e again caution that the 3rd spiral of upward lining light, that which is emitted from the apex of this shape, is most deleterious to an entity in overdose and should not be used over-long. (B3, 48) QUESTION: If I used a wire frame that was 4 pieces of wire joined at the apex running down to the base, and the pyramid were totally open, this could do the same thing to the spiraling light. Is this correct? (B3, 55) RA: This is correct, but there are many metals not recommended. Expensive metals are best, or wood or plastic. (B3, 55) C. MAKE APEX ANGLE NO GREATER THAN 70 DEGREES QUESTION: The dangerous pyramid shape would be a 4-sided pyramid that was large enough to create the King's chamber effect. Is this correct? RA: That is correct with the additional understanding that the 76 degree apex angle is characteristic of the powerful shape. (B3, 50) QUESTION: What angle less than 76 degrees would not produce this dangerous effect? RA: Any angle less than 70 degrees. (B3, 50) D. THE DIMENSIONS QUESTION: You mean the sum of the 4 base sides should be 1.16 of the height of the pyramid? (B3, 48-49) RA: That is correct. RA: The most appropriate size for use beneath the head is an overall height small enough to make placing it under the cushion of the head (pillow) a comfortable thing. (B3, 120) RA: The Giza pyramid offers an excellent model. Be sure the pyramid is so small that there is no entity small enough to crawl inside it. (B3, 121) E. THE PYRAMID AMPLIFIES THE 2ND SPIRAL OF LIGHT"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"QUESTION: There are many people who are now bending metal by mentally requesting that it happen. What's happening? RA: As this 2nd spiral of light ends at the apex, the light there may be likened to a laser beam in the metaphysical sense and when intelligently directed may cause the bending (of iron) not only in the pyramid. This is possible through indigo contact with intelligent energy. (B3, 56) F. WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF THIS RADIATION OF ENERGY? RA: The vibration offered by the energizing spiral of the pyramid is such that each cell, both in space-time and time/space, is charged as if hooked to your electricity. The keenness of mind, the physical and sexual energy of the body, and the attunement of will of spirit are all touched by this energizing influence. It is possible to overcharge a battery and this is the cause of our cautioning any who use such pyramidal energies to remove the pyramid after a charge has been received. (B3, 120) RA: There is no application for direct healing. In most cases it is most helpful in alleviating weariness and in the stimulation of physical or sexual activity. (B3, 122) G. THE RADIATION PRODUCED IS MUCH LIKE THE SUN'S RAYS QUESTION: Is this spiraling light energy somehow connected to the indigo energy center? RA: This is incorrect. This energy moves within the field of the physical complex and irradiates each cell of the space/time body, and as this is done it also irradiates the time/space equivalent which is closely aligned with the space/time yellow ray body (i.e., the physical body). This is not a function of the etheric body or of free will. This is a radiation much like your sun's rays (It acts on the physical body). Thus it should be used with care. Any sudden feeling of weariness would be a sure sign that the entity had been over-radiated (B3, 121) III. SOUNDS OF POWER QUESTION: Rituals that have been used previously are effective because these words have built a bias in consciousness. Is that correct? RA: This is, to a great extent, correct. The exception is the sounding of some of what you call your Hebrew and some of what you call your Sanskrit vowels. These sound vibration complexes have power before time and space and represent configurations of light which built all there is. (B3, 183) QUESTION: Why do these sounds have this property? RA: In the case of Hebrew that entity known as Yahweh aided this knowledge through impression upon the material of genetic coding which became language, In the case of Sanskrit the sound vibrations are pure due to lack of previous alphabet or letter-naming. (B3, 184) (Note: Refer to the work of Stan Tenen at www.meru.org for up-to-date information on the sacred geometric properties of the Hebrew alphabet.) RA: Of paramount importance is the magical personality. With the appropriate emotional will, polarity and purity, work may he done with or without the proper sound vibration complexes. However, there is no need for the blunt instrument when the scalpel is available. (B3, 183) 49. FAMOUS PEOPLE I. NIKOLA TESLA RA: The entity known as Nicola Tesla received information from Confederation sources desirous of aiding this extremely, shall we say, angelically positive entity in bettering the existence of others. Unfortunately, like many"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Wanderers, the vibratory distortions of 3rd density caused him to become distorted in his perceptions of other people and his mission was not completed. (B1, 121) RA: Information offered Tesla was also experimented with for potential destruction - example: your so-called Philadelphia Experiment. (B1, 219) II. ALBERT SCHWEITZER RA: This entity was able to mobilize great amounts of energy and money. This entity spent much green ray energy both as a healer and as a lover of what you know as an organ. This entity yellow ray was bright and crystallized by the efforts needed to procure the funds to promulgate its efforts. However, the green and blue rays were of a toweringly brilliant nature as well. (B2, 53-54) III. GENERAL GEORGE PATTON RA: This entity was of a strong yellow ray activation with frequent green ray openings and occasional blue ray openings. This entity polarized somewhat towards the positive due to its singleness of belief in truth and beauty. It perceived itself a gallant figure. It polarized somewhat towards the negative in its lack of understanding the green ray it carried with it, rejecting the forgiveness principle which is explicit in universal love. The sum total was a slight increase in positive polarity but a decrease in harvestability due to the rejection of the law of responsibility, that is, seeing universal love. (B2, 56) QUESTION: Did the death of this entity almost immediately after the war occur so it could be immediately reincarnated so it could make harvest? (B2, 56) RA: That is precisely correct. IV. FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT RA. The one known as FDR developed very quickly up through red, orange, yellow and green and began to work in the blue ray energy center at a tender age. He mated with an entity whose blue ray vibrations were of a strength more than equal to his own thus acquiring catalyst for further growth that was to persist throughout the incarnation. This entity had some difficulty with continued green ray activity due to the need to acquire power. Polio opened the opportunity for concentration upon the more universal or idealistic acts of power: that is, the non-abusive uses of power. Thus the entity had lost some positive polarity due to excessive use of orange and yellow ray energies at the expense of green and blue ray energies, and then had regained the polarity due to the catalytic effects of a painful physical limitation. (B2, 57-58) QUESTION: Did FDR place the physical limitations on his body himself? RA: This is partially correct. The basic guidelines for the lessons and purposes of incarnation had been carefully set forth before incarnation by the mind/body/spirit complex totality. If FDR had avoided the excessive enjoyment or attachment to the competitiveness which may be seen to be inherent in the processes of its occupation, this entity would not have had the limitation (polio.) (B2, 58-59) V. ADOLF HITLER RA: This is an entity who, in attempting activation of the highest rays of energy while lacking the green ray key canceled itself out as far as polarization towards either positive or negative. This entity was basically negative, however, its confusion was such that the personality disintegrated, thus leaving the mind/body/spirit complex unharvestable and much in need of healing. This entity followed the pattern of negative polarization, which suggests the elite and the enslaved, this being seen by the entity to be of an helpful nature for the societal structure. However, in drifting from the conscious polarization into a twilight dream world, this entity failed in its attempt to serve the Creator in a harvestable degree along the path of service to self."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Thus we see insanity which may often arise when an entity attempts to polarize more quickly than experience may be integrated. (Some of the people in his government were able to polarize in a harvestable nature on the negative path.) (B2, 59) QUESTION: Where is Adolf Hitler now? RA: At this time he is in a training process in the middle astral planes of your spherical force field. This entity was greatly confused and needed a great deal of care. (B1, 17) VI. ABRAHAM LINCOLN RA. This entity saw the work done by those who began the democratic concept of freedom in danger of being abridged by the rising belief and use of the principle of enslavement of entities. This is a negative concept of a fairly serious nature in your density. This entity therefore went forward into what it saw as the battle for the light. This entity did not gain or lose karma by these activities due to its detachment from any outcome. Its attitude throughout was one of service to others. The polarity of the individual was somewhat, but not severely, lessened by the cumulative feelings and thought forms which were created due to large numbers of entities leaving the physical plane due to trauma of battle. (B2, 61) 50. NUCLEAR ENERGY I. BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ENTITIES WERE INVOLVED QUESTION: How did we learn about nuclear energy? Was it mixed with both positive and negative orientation? (B1, 120) RA: That is correct. The entities responsible for the gathering of the scientists were of mixed intent. The scientists who discovered nuclear energy were overwhelmingly positive in their orientation. The scientists who followed their work were of mixed orientation, including one extremely negative entity who is still on Earth. (B1, 121) II. THE REINTEGRATION OF SOULS IS NEEDED IN A NUCLEAR EXPLOSION RA: The use of intelligent energy transforming matter into energy is of such a nature among these weapons that the transition from space/time 3rd density to time/space 3rd density, or what you call your heaven-worlds is interrupted in many cases. There is a need for re-integration of souls when these nuclear devices are used in your space/time continuum. This is a service we may perform, (B1, 219) RA: Those who were destroyed, not by radiation. but by the trauma of energy release, found a disarrangement of that unique vibratory complex you have called the spirit complex without possibility of re-integration. This would be a loss to the Creator and we were given permission, not to stop the events, but to ensure the survival of the disembodied mind/body/spirit complex. (B1, 219) 51. MESSAGES FROM MICHAEL"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"RA: There are some distortions in the descriptions of the one known as Michael. However, the distortions have to do primarily with the fact that these entities are not a social memory complex, but rather a group of mind/body/spirit complexes dedicated to service. These entities work together, but are not completely unified; thus they do not completely see each others thoughts, feelings and motives. However, their desire to serve is the 4th dimensional type of desire, thus melding them into what you might call a brotherhood. [Reference was made to a book, “Road in the Sky” by George Hunt Williamson and the mention of the elder race] (B1, 147) 52. HELPERS I. NO ONE IS WITHOUT HELPERS RA: There are those whose lessons are more random due to their inability to comprehend the nature of evolution of mind, body and spirit. Of these we may say that the process is guarded by those who never cease their watchful expectation of being of service. There is no entity without help, either through self-awareness of the unity of creation or through guardians which protect the less sophisticated mind/body/spirit from any permanent separation from unity while the lessons of your density continue. (B2, 130) II. THERE ARE 3 LEVELS OF HELPERS THAT ASSIST IN THE HARVEST RA: In time of harvest there are always harvesters. There is some supervision necessary to ensure that this bounty is placed as it should be without bruise or blemish. There are 3 levels watching over the harvest. (B3, 6) A. PLANETARY HELPERS = ANGELS, HIGHER SELF, INNER PLANE HELPERS RA: The 1st type is planetary and that which may be called angelic. This type of helper includes the Higher Self of an entity and those inner plane entities which have been attracted to this entity through its inner seeking. (B3, 6) B. CONFEDERATION HELPERS MAKE SURE NONE STUMBLE RA: The 2 nd class are those of the of the Confederation who stand at the edge of the steps of light/love so that those entities harvested will not, no matter how confused or unable to make contact with their Higher Self, stumble and fall away for any reason other than the strength of the light. These Confederation entities catch those who stumble and set them aright so that they may continue into the light. (B3, 6) C. THE GUARDIANS DETERMINE PRECISELY THE LIGHT VIBRATION EMITTED RA: The 3rd group is called the Guardians. This group is from the octave above our own and serve as light bringers. They provide the precise emissions of light/love in exquisitely fastidious disseminations of discrimination so that the precise light/love vibration of each entity may be ascertained. (B3, 6) [Note: Apparently, by saying “the octave above our own,” Ra is referring to seventh- density entities and not entities outside of our own Octave of all creation.] 53. ATLANTIS"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"RA: They were able to use intelligent infinity in an informative manner. They used intelligent energy as well, manipulating greatly the natural influxes of the indigo or pineal ray from divine or infinite energy. Thus they were able to create lifeforms. This they began to do instead of healing and perfecting their own mind/body/spirit complexes, turning their distortions toward what you may call negative. About 11,000 years ago 40% of them died in the first war. About 10,821 years ago in your illusion the 2nd war, the most devastating one, caused earth-changing configurations and the larger part of Atlantis was no more. Some escaped to Tibet, Peru, and Turkey. (B1, 115) 54. THE MIND, BODY, AND SPIRIT I. THE MIND/BODY/SPIRIT COMPLEX RA: The term \"mind/body/spirit\" should be used to refer to those entities dwelling in 3rd density prior to the veiling process. The term “mind/body/spirit complex\" refers to those entities dwelling in 3rd density after the veiling process. (B, 09) II. THE MIND RA: The body is the material experienced in space/time or time/space. The mind reflects the in- - pourings of the Spirit and up-pourings of the body complex. It contains feelings and thoughts. Moving further down the tree of mind we see the intuition which is more in tune with the total being-ness complex. Moving down to the roots of mind we find the progression of consciousness which gradually turns from the personal to the racial memory, to the cosmic influences, and thus becomes a direct contractor of that shuttle we call the spirit complex. (B2, 25) III. THE SPIRIT RA: The spirit complex is the channel whereby the in-pourings from all the various universal, planetary and personal in-pourings be funneled into the roots of consciousness and whereby consciousness can be channeled to the gateway of intelligent infinity. (B2, 25) IV. THE BODY RA: W hat is important is the balanced blending of the energy centers in such a way that intelligent energy is able to channel itself with minimal distortion. The mind/body/spirit complex is not a machine. It is rather what you might call a tone poem. (B3, 25) RA: The body is the creature of the mind and is the instrument of manifestation for the fruits of mind and Spirit. (B4, 57) 55. WORKING WITH LIGHT I. LOVE/LIGHT AND LIGHT/LOVE QUESTION: Is there any difference between light/love and love/light?"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"RA: There is the same difference as between teach/learning and learn/teaching. Love/light is the enabler, the power, the energy giver. Light/love is the manifestation which occurs when light has been impressed with love. (B1, 148) II. THE 3 SPIRALS OF LIGHT ENERGY A. The fundamental spiral which is used for study and healing. B. The spiral to the apex which is used for building. C. The spiral spreading from the apex which is used for energizing. (B3, 57) III. DEVELOPING LIGHT IN THE MIND/BODY/SPIRIT RA: Note the great way of the development of light in the microcosmic mind/body/spirit. It is assumed that an adept will have its energy centers functioning smoothly and in a balanced manner to its best effort before a magical working. All magical workings are based upon evocation and/or invocation. The first invocation of any magical working is that invocation of the magical personality. Begin the invocation of this magical personality by the motion of putting on something. Since you do not have an item of apparel, the gesture which you have made is appropriate. The 2nd evocation is the evocation of the great cross of life. This is an extension of the magical personality to become the Creator. All invocations are drawn through the indigo ray center. (B3, 170-171) 56. RIGHT BRAIN/LEFT BRAIN RA: It may seem that the rational or analytical mind might have more of a probability of pursuing the negative orientation. However, this same ability to structure abstract concepts and to analyze experimental data may be the key to rapid positive polarization. Those whose analytical capacities are predominant have somewhat more to work with in polarizing. The function of intuition is to inform intelligence. As you may see, these two types of brain structure need to be balanced in order that the net sum of experiential catalyst will be polarization and illumination, for without the acceptance by the rational mind of the worth of the intuitive faculty, the creative acts which aid in illumination will be stifled. (B2, 124) 57. TRUE COLOR RA: Each of the true color densities has the 7 energy centers and each entity contains all this in potentiation. The activation, while in yellow ray, of violet-ray intelligent infinity is a passport to the next octave of experience. (B2, 122) ASCENSION2000 HOMEPAGE "}]
