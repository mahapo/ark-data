From the time of the Crusades to the twenty-first century, a handful of families have controlled the course of world events and have built their own status and wealth through collective efforts and intermarriage. The greatest elite society was that of the Knights Templar. Admission to the organization often required breedi ng and wealth that were the privilege of a select few. Outside the cor e a larger force was needed both to fight wars and to maintain the organ ization's far-flung assets. These forces would grow to include an army, a navy, various real estate (including agricultural properties), and a b anking empire. Admission standards changed over time to the degree necessary to maintain the needed personnel, but the elite core w as always in control. When the massive Templar organization was suddenly outlawed by the avarice of the French king, it did not die; it simply moved under- ground. The survival of the underground Templars ha s been touched upon by several authors, but only recently has more in-depth research brought the Templars' survival to light. The Templars survived militarily. By pledging thems elves to various powers, the military orders survived their open att ack by both state and church and the mass executions and imprisonments of the fourteenth century. The Knights of Christ, the Teutonic Knight s, the Swiss Guard, and the Scots Guard, as well as several small but p owerful military orders, outlived those who persecuted them.

The Templar organization survived and regrouped fin ancially. The massive Templar, Incorporated that would bring bank ing to its modern form survived by moving to Switzerland, where a han dful of bankers maintained and often controlled the massive wealth of the European elite. The Swiss cantons, often flying flags only s lightly different from the Templar flags, protected by the Alpine passes a nd the Swiss Guard, took the role of the Templar preceptory. The neutra l status and the preservation of secrecy would attract the funds of Europe from the fourteenth century to the twenty-first. The Templar ideal of commitment to learning, discov ery, and broth- erhood greatly affected the world over the subseque nt centuries. For example, neo-Templar organizations were responsible for advances in various sciences. Prince Henry, the grand master of the Knights of Christ, made advancements in the art of navigation and fund ed the voyages of discovery. And various members of the Royal Society progressed in astronomy, in medical arts, and even in the transmu tation of metals, and their accomplishments frequently became the foundat ion of modern sci- ences. Until the early 1300s, learning and experime ntation were consid- ered heretical and could easily place a scientist u nder the control of the Inquisition. Later post-Templar organizations under stood the value of secrecy to avoid religious persecution for philosop hical and scientific dis- cussion. The Masonic brotherhood created in post-Templar Sco tland was largely responsible for influencing the American co ncepts of liberty, freedom, due process, and democracy. The concept of the \"military lodge\"—in which a non-permanent lodge traveled with soldiers— brought to America by the fighting units of Europe would further the ideals and fight the war for independence. Secretiv e groups such as those meeting at Saint Andrews Lodge in Boston woul d instigate the Boston Tea Party, and they spread like wildfire thr oughout the colonies.

Many were neces sarily organized in secret. Many would preserve their secrecy by oaths taken in Masonic fraternal lodges. The climax was when French forces , enlisted through Masonic channels, arrived under the command of high -ranking Masons and Knights of Saint John and defeated the British at Yorktown. The result was an elected American president who wa s a Mason, sworn in on the Bible of a Masonic lodge by the gra nd master of New York's Masons and a new form of government. Another was the nation's capitol, which was built by employing Masonic geome tric principles and was dedicated in a strictly Masonic ceremony co mplete with high- ranking government members in Masonic aprons. But there was a downside. Secret societies and the elite of mainstream societ y would strive to perpetuate themselves through any means possible. T he higher ideals of liberty and equality were compromised by the elite, who remained in control. The breakup of the Templars was directly responsibl e for the dra- matic rise in piracy that plagued Europe, America, and even the Indian Ocean. The pirates themselves were organized in fra ternal brother- hoods, they pledged themselves to the good of the g roup, they prom- ised to share equally in the proceeds, and they eve n fought under the same battle flag that was flown by the Templar figh ting fleet. Stranger still, the pirate bases—ports in Scotland, Ireland, and America where pirates could openly dock and sell their booty—were protected by Masonic cells that extended to the courthouses and capitol buildings. Smuggling, too, grew as a worldwide enterprise desp ite its illegal- ity. Ports from Salem and Newport to the Caribbean and Bermuda, which harbored and facilitated the trade of pirates , had no qualms about aiding and abetting smugglers. For the same reasons that Masonic organizations grew into labor and artisan guilds th at protected the livelihood of their members, individuals in the smu ggling business needed to be considered trustworthy. In Bermuda, wh ere possibly two thirds of the eighteenth-century trade was illegal, trading partners had to maintain secrecy. The island was and is a bastio n of Masonry; the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"4 Introduction Customs House itself more closely resembles a Mason ic temple than a government office. Unfortunately, the slave-trading industry was also furthered by Masonic groups. The Knights of Christ were actually responsible for organizing the importation of human cargo to Europe and later for licensing the trade in the Americas. The chivalric orders that controlled the governments of Portugal and Spain sold licenses to other govern- ments, which in turn organized companies to propaga te the trade. The royals of Europe were the ultimate beneficiaries of the business; for a share of the profits, they granted licenses to elit e merchants and busi- nessmen who were part of the court. Licenses to tra de in slaves were sold by the merchants and businessmen to the highes t bidders, allowing newcomers to join the merchant class—yet connection s would super- sede wealth. In America, democracy and free enterpr ise theoretically allowed anyone to play a role in the buying and sel ling of humans, but it was a handful of elite families, connected to co unterparts in England and France, that took over the business. When the American Revolution broke out, Benjamin Fr anklin turned to the Masonic elite of France, who controll ed the slave trade, to get arms, supplies, and military support. In the first fourscore years of American history, the slave-trading ports from Char leston to Newport were controlled by a handful of families bound by M asonic and family ties. They were not like the Jeffersons and Madison s, who saw the even- tual end to the institution as befitting the new de mocracy; it was a mer- cantilist capitalism that the slave traders put abo ve freedom and democracy. These merchants would not relinquish the lucrative trade and seemed to stop at nothing in fighting abolition. Th e presidency was something members of the mercantile elite felt they could buy, and when money couldn't decide an election they used ot her means to seize control. In an effort to derail abolition, Pr esidents Harrison and Taylor suffered sudden and suspicious deaths that p ut pro-slave vice presidents in power. When even death failed to halt abolition, the coun- try wound up in the most destructive war it ever fo ught. The Civil War"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Introduction 5 ended at Appomattox, where the armies of Jefferson Davis surren- dered—but not for the elite. A conspiracy organized by members of the quasi-Masonic Knights of the Golden Circle to kill President Lincoln sought to nullify the Emancipation Proclamation and its effects on the trade with England. The postwar efforts at reconstr uction would also be stained by another Masonic group of \"knights,\" the Ku Klux Klan. Although piracy and smuggling were no longer as pro fitable in the newly independent America, institutions such as the slave trade and ille- gal drug trafficking would take their place. The la tter provided riches for the elite that would become the bedrock of the American industrial age. The illegal drug trade that the Americans and British united to cre- ate in the first half of the nineteenth century wou ld be a never-ending plague. Again, a select core of families controlled the trade, and in both Britain and America they were organized in Masonic cells. Family and lodge connections were the only tickets to admittan ce. While it is not surprising that America's Founding Fathers were mostly slave owners, a legal activity, it may be su rprising to discover that they were often smugglers as well. Profits from dru g running, smuggling, slave trading, and even piracy are directly respons ible for the founding of several of the country's most important banks, whic h are still in operation today. New England's staunch insurance business was born and prospered through profits earned from insuring opium and slav e ships. The large railroad system that was built throughout the conti nental United States in the nineteenth century was funded with profits from illegal drug smug- gling. And one of the greatest opium fortunes would provide seed money for the telephone and communications industry. The European Knights Templar was a massive organiza tion, but at the center was a hereditary elite that controlled a nd reaped the rewards of the group. Even after the reported demise of the group, it retained remarkable clout and power, always behind the scene s. In America the influence of a core elite was as str ong. This elite class positioned itself to control the masses no longer f or holy crusade, but rather to enrich itself. Rooted in the Masonic lodg e system, a new class formed through connections made at the most famous lodges, such as"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"6 Introduction the Holland No. 8 Lodge in New York and the Solomon 's Lodge of Charleston, where members could control politics an d legitimate busi- ness while also enjoying the profits of corrupt and even criminal under- world dealings. The family wealth of Franklin and Theodore Roosevel t had been built on drug running. As in all opium-smuggling fa milies, inbreeding was important. The Delano side of Franklin Delano R oosevelt was an opium smuggler who made a fortune, lost it, and ret urned to drug run- ning to recoup it. Ulysses S. Grant married into an opium-dealing fam- ily with connections in Europe and America. The fir st families of New York and New England who graciously provided funds for Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Brown, and Princeton Universities d onated money earned in the illegal drug trade. The same men woul d build railroads and textile mills, found banks and insurance compan ies, and keep the family wealth intact for generations to come. Besid es the Roosevelts and Grant, other presidents—including Taft and both Bushes—were connected by a bizarre cult at Yale that was founde d by and funded with money from the China trade. That organization is as secretive, elite, and powerful today as it was two centuries ago. Other presidents have been connected to piracy by t heir relations. John Tyler married into a family whose status was a chieved on pirate booty. Millard Fillmore's great-grandfather was tri ed for piracy. Like opium trading, piracy was an enterprise that depend ed on a widespread system of recognition and trust. From Cape Cod and eastern Long Island to New York City, North Carolina, and New Or leans pirates trusted each other and knew those in power who prov ided shelter, legal protection, and a market for their goods. When on l and, the pirate cap- tains reported to the powerful few who protected th eir trade. These connections were made and preserved through the Mas onic halls. Governors, mayors, and judges licensed and invested in pirate voyages, the proceeds of which helped build family fortunes.

Piracy was not the only crime on the high seas; the American colonies also prospered through smuggling. John Han cock was a wealthy Mason whose ship Liberty would put Boston o n the path to the Tea Party and Revolution. With one foot in the elit e Masonic lodges where shipowners and captains were welcome and anot her in the lodges where the workingman was accepted, Hancock p rovided work for one third of Boston. It was Britain's insistenc e on enforcing its laws against smuggling that precipitated the Revolution. The colonies relied on their smugglers to provide food, arms, and suppl ies to fight Britain. The role of America's smuggling partners in the Car ibbean and Bermuda has hardly been examined by historians, but it was vital. At the same time, smuggling and privateering provided a fo undation for many of America's political dynasties that remain in pow er today. The Revolution put an end to the large profits of t he smuggling business. Piracy and privateering also ceased to be an easy road to profits. The slave trade would provide the next avenue to we alth on the seas, thriving in ports that were strongholds of Masonry. From Newport to Charleston, belonging to a lodge meant access to fu nding, insurance, and finding a crew for slave trading. It also meant acc ess to the marketplace. But Masonic membership did not merely present oppor tunity in the underworld. Benjamin Franklin acknowledged that success in the printing business hinged on just which Masonic lodg e one belonged to in the city of Philadelphia. John Jacob Astor, who once held one fifteenth of all American personal wealth, joined t he prestigious Holland No. 8 Lodge in New York to advance his busi nesses. Success in the legal profession, almost a prerequisite for gov ernment office, was ensured to the sons of the wealthy who could study at the Temple in London.

The secret and elite structures that have built Ame rica's business empires and family fortunes have concealed their hi story well. In an age when the slightest indiscretions sometimes have the potential to dis- qualify a candidate from public office, the tainted backgrounds and family histories of the Founding Fathers of the cou ntry and its institu- tions are remarkable. We have inherited colleges an d universities named for slave traders and opium dealers. We honor presi dents and other politicians whose families built their fortunes thr ough crime. We patronize businesses founded by men whose fortunes are rooted in ille- gal activity. Many of the families regarded as America's blue blo ods, our equiv- alent of aristocracy, have hidden in their ancestra l closets men who would make today's organized criminals look cherubi c. They were not mere horse thieves and snake-oil salesmen, nor were they con men who were ridden out of town on the rail. These Founding Fathers rose to great wealth. Their legacy was passed on to heirs w ho still enjoy that wealth—and their power too, which is protected by t he institutions they put in place and ensures their participation i n the future. The sys- tem, thanks to ill-gotten gains and power, perpetua tes itself. In a country where everyone was given a new start, a fresh chance, and an equal opportunity, it is curious that the ga p between rich and poor widened so dramatically after the American Rev olution. But it was not by chance or hard work; institutions from E urope, often under- ground, established a network that would ensure the success and power of their own. The same secret societies that had be en established in Europe for hundreds of years were imported into Eur ope's colonies from the earliest days. To understand how pervasive secret and elite societ ies are today and how they played such a significant role in recent c enturies, we must begin at one critical day in 1307, when the greates t organization the world had ever known saw its downfall."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"PART ONE Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life MEDIEVAL EUROPE HAD a class structure that divided the rich from the poor in more intrusive wa ys than does the gap that divides the classes today.

Society and the Church also played a great role in determining just what a n indi- vidual could or could not do. Strict conventions pe rme- ated society to the point that even the clothes an individual wore were subject to law. In colonial Ne w York, when pirates paraded from one tavern to anoth er in silk shirts and pistol-concealing waistcoats, th ey defied not only a societal convention, but also the law.

In medieval times the choices for most young men (and women) were few and unappealing. Inheritance law once gave the fami ly estate to the eld- est son and allowed the younger brothers and sister s to stay only if they remained unmarried. Daughters were married off and sons apprenticed out or sent to study for the priesthood, as their f athers saw fit. War brought opportunity. Enlisting for the Crusades gave men the chance to leave behind a predestined life. The Crus ades meant adven- tures and the possibility of bettering one's circum stances. Going to sea offered the same escape. Life at sea was adventurou s, and enabled some to return home with enough money to live out their lives. However, most men who joined the Crusades to escape the mund ane fate of becoming priests or apprentices could not even step back into those vocations. When Jerusalem was lost and the Knights Templar disbanded, many had little chance of returning to society. Fea ring prosecution or simply poverty, many decided to keep on enjoying th e daredevil life. For the fighting soldier, one choice was to become a mercenary in the newly emerging fighting orders from Scotland to the Mediterranean Sea. For the sailor, the life of a pr ivateer, a smuggler, or a pirate held even more promise of reward. Both mer cenary and pirate became members of a society within the society. Pirates have been portrayed as bands of swashbuckli ng, peg-legged lunatics with homicidal tendencies since the days o f the eighteenth-cen- tury writer Daniel Defoe. The real story is less co lorful—and more inter- esting. Although many would live \"the merry life an d the short life,\" as Defoe's fact-bending tales called it, others enjoye d a life expectancy longer than that of sailors on British navy ships. They ate better, were treated less harshly, and shared in a greater porti on of their gains. Pirates were banded together by covenants that prov ided more pro- tection than English naval law, and were regularly voted on by every sailor aboard. The pirate ship and pirate ports lik e Saint Mary's in Madagascar were the first instances of democratic r ule. The one-man, one-vote system aboard the pirate ship was not dupl icated until the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life 11 American Constitution. Even then, voting was not as democratic as was pirate rule. Care for the injured and for the widowed, too, was usually more reliable for the pirate than for the sailor in the English navy. The navy embodied the most rigid of class structures and off ered little in the way of security. Pirates bought supplies and arms, sold ill-gotten g ains from wool to jewels, and often retired to estates, or at least f arms, bought with the proceeds of their life's work. To deal with convent ional society, they had to have connections. To create such connections mea nt that they had to belong to a brotherhood. The brotherhood went much deeper than a small group banding together. As remnant Templars b ecame organized in lodges, old ties were restored. Masonry, more or less underground until the early eighteenth century, provided lodgin g, employment, food, and even clothes to brothers. Masonry also provided connections to a network, underground and often above the law. When Freemasonry was finally acknowledged, a secret oath for a Master Ma son acknowledged that masons were \"brothers to pirates and corsairs. \" Those who sailed under the skull and crossbones cou ld rely on pro- tection in the ports and in the courts, where a sec ret handshake or coded phrase required fellow Masons to come to the aid of a their brethren.

On that day the Knights Temp lar, who had fought so valiantly for the cause of Christiani ty during the Crusades, were ordered arrested by the French king. Operating on orders that were sealed until the night before the arrest, the representa- tives of the French crown launched an early-dawn ra id on all the Templar properties in the realm of the king. Specia l focus was given to the center of the Templar organization, the Paris t reasury. Within hours both knights and servants of the order were under a rrest and in custody. Within days, interrogation under extreme torture be gan, and it soon elicited confessions of many of the depraved acts a nd practices of the order of warrior-monks. The greatest order Europe h ad ever seen soon ceased to exist. When it was formed almost two hundred years before, the Templars were a military force organized like a religious or der. The creation of the Templars coincided with Saint Bernard taking co ntrol of the Cistercian order of monks in France. Bernard was in strumental in molding both organizations to carry out the mission he envisioned. The rules for his order of monks were adopted by the fi ghting monks that would be called the Order of the Poor Knights of Ch rist and the Temple of Solomon.

The count don ated the land on which Bernard built the abbey of Clairvaux, which w ould be the cen- ter of Bernard's power. Fixing on the need to take back the Holy Lands from Islam, Bernard preached a military crusade. It was said th at when he reached a village, women would attempt to hide their husban ds, as few could resist his call to arms. The act of seeing the worl d may have appealed to a peasant class that was often regarded as the prop erty of the feudal estates that dominated the countryside. The Crusade s offered adven- ture—and salvation. After thousands marched against Islam and recap- tured the holy city of Jerusalem, thousands more de sired to travel to the sacred city. The nine original Templar knights went to the Holy Lands to protect the roads for those making the pilgrimag e. After several years, they returned to a hero's welcome. With Bernard's seal of approval, the Knights Templa r grew and flourished, becoming the vanguard of Europe's milit ary.

BANKING Although the full name of the organization was the Order of the Poor Knights of the Temple of Solomon, the order was any thing but poor. It was, in fact, the richest organization that Europe had even seen and the first ever multinational corporation. The business of the Knights Templar was business, and it was conducted in a way that Europe had never seen before. The loyalty of the order was dir ected to itself.

The Templars' true allegiance was to themse lves, as together they could become masters of any industry they desired. Banking as we know it today was an institution foun ded by the Knights Templar. Before the Templars there were cer tain individuals who would attend trade fairs for facilitating curre ncy exchange, buying and selling shares in commercial enterprises, and l ending money. Many of the early banking groups were Italian families f rom Florence, Venice, and Lombardy. The activities of these bankers were restricted by numer- ous laws. In a world where the pope and the Catholic Church m ade the rules, usury, the charging of interest, was banned. For the Templars there were several ways to skirt the laws forbidding the charging of interest. One way was simply to charge a commission to procur e the loan, but such a thinly disguised fee would still attract the condemnation of reli- gious members. Another way was to call usury by a d ifferent name. The order was allowed to charge a \"crusading interest\" for loans. Its clients were often the same nobility that donated lands to the Temple, for which they received an income from the properties. Nobles, often the kings of England and France, needed to borrow money to fight wars and the Temple was willing to lend—for a fee. Where usury was a prac- tice not allowed even for the Temple, the Temple wo uld earn a profit by currency changing. For instance, wool from France t hat was carried on Temple ships and sold to a buyer in England was sub ject to a currency change that often placed less value on the payment currency. Deposit banking was not banned by the Church, nor w as the func- tion of acting as a safe deposit. Who was better pr epared than the Templars, with their numerous fortresses and strong holds stretched over Europe, to protect the wealth of the Continent's el ite?

The re was always a profit to be earned. The few records found in the Paris Temple show the various trans- actions that took place on a typical day. Entries s igned by the Templar cashier of the day listed the amount of a deposit, the name of the depos- itor, the origin of the deposit, and occasionally t o whose account it would be credited if not the depositor's. A network of fortified houses throughout Europe and the Holy Lands served as the predecessor of the modern branch system of any large financial institu tion. Five categories of clients were served: Knights Templar (they often received payment in cities outside of their homeland and were not willi ng to carry money), ecclesiastical dignitaries, the king, other nobles, and the bourgeois. The records were kept in the Journal of Treasure. 1 This \"treasure\" would ulti- mately attract the interest of the French king, who was on the accounts receivable list. TEMPLAR, INC. PROPERTY MANAGEMENT Property and estate management played a large role in Templar affairs. Before the fall of Jerusalem, the Templars controll ed nine thousand manors that had been donated to the order by Europe 's landowners. An English property census noted, \"The number of manor s, farms, churches, advowsons, demesne lands, villages, hamle ts, windmills and watermills, rents of assize, rights of common and f ree warren, and the amounts of all types of property, possessed by the Templars in England ... are astonishing.\" In Yorkshire the Templars own ed several large manors and sixty smaller parcels of property. 2 In Sicily they possessed valuable estates, large tracts of land, and rights of fishery, pasturage, and cutting wood. In Spain the Templars were \"endowed w ith cities, vil- lages, lordships and splendid domains.\" 3 In Aragon they had castles in several cities, were the lords of Borgia and Tortos a, and received the rev- enue of one tenth of the kingdom. 4 The list of Templar property filled an entire censu s book; they had"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"16 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life lands in Germany, Hungary, and France and in the te rritories border- ing France and Germany. In 1180 hundreds of acres w ere required to support one knight in battle; a century later thous ands of acres were necessary. Templar property was exempt from local t ithes yet could receive them. While the common man would understand that the fruits of his labors provided support to those fighting th e Crusades, a neigh- boring noble was not as gracious. A common man was generally required to contribute time, and for most this was easy. A noble (landowner) paid a higher price. He experienced hig her costs and more challenge in finding workers, as he competed with t he Templars for available able-bodied men. And a landowner, unlike his Templar neigh- bor, paid taxes. Because the Temple employees were liable only to the order that employed them, fugitives and felons coul d find refuge from the law by working for a Templar estate. The amalgamation of an international military force and a religious order in the form of a business never again appears in the history of the world. In addition to reaping profits, the Templar order was the benefi- ciary of gifts that were meant as penance for sins. The greatest gift to the Templar order was required of King Henry II of England as a result of the murder of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thom as a Becket. Henry donated funds to equip two hundred knights a year, as well as more money in his will. The Templars had every adva ntage and no one to report to. TEMPLAR, INC. SHIPPING The Templar fleet was another source of profits tha t aroused the envy of the shipowners and merchants of France's port ci ties. In the early years of the Crusades, the Templars required massiv e movement of men, arms, and horses. They would contract with merchant s of Italian city- states like Venice and Genoa.

Because minor kingdoms wo uld coin their"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The New World Order 17 own money, the Italian traders were also money chan gers and lenders. The bankers from Venice, Genoa, Lucca, and Florence were called Lombards, and they replaced the Jews as Europe's me rchant bankers. Loan rates could range from 15 percent for a busine ss loan to 100 per- cent for a personal loan. Templar, Inc. would move to take business from the Italian merchants. 5 In 1207 the Templars became shipowners. When they w eren't using ships for the transport of men, they would use the vessels for trade. The profits and the fleet itself began to grow in size. By 1233 the city of Marseilles was complaining that Templar ships were taking business away from their own. 6 The Templars soon had many preceptories in port cities including Brindisi, Bari, Barletta, and Trani and on Sicily at Messina. The trans-Mediterranean trade often involv ed transporting goods and animals to the eastern Mediterranean Sea and returning with slaves, who would work for the Templars in the West . The Turkish port of Ayas in Cilicia was a center fo r the slave trade, and the Templars established a wharf there. The Kni ghts Templar and the rival Christian order the Knights of Malta beca me the largest European slave traders in the Mediterranean, and th ey established themselves in Venice. Perhaps the most important sl ave port of the Templars was the city of Acre in the Holy Lands. Th ere all the slaves were called Muslims, regardless of their religion; this was the result of the pope in Rome declaring a ban on Christian slave s in the kingdom of Jerusalem. Muslims who sought to convert were de nied. Pope Gregory was told of this and complained to the gran d masters of both orders, but the trade in all its avarice continued. The Templar fleet served both to generate profits f or the order and as part of the Templar war machine. Flying the skul l and crossbones as its battle flag, the Templar fleet was used in mili tary operations against Egypt, the coast of Asia Minor, and throughout the Mediterranean Sea. In addition to transporting troops and carrying wea pons and sup- plies for their military operations, as well as sla ves and goods for trade, the Templars engaged in piracy.

There were few ships designed strictly for battle, as all ship ping boats needed to be armed. Thus the act of capturing an Islamic merchan t ship would be considered privateering. There was a fine line betw een piracy and, later, privateering, which meant that a ship's captain had the permission of a ruler, and later a letter of marque, to engage in p iracy. An English ship engaged in plundering English ships would be defined as a pirate ship, even if it shared the spo ils with the English king. If an English ship took a French ship without the E nglish king's per- mission, it was still a pirate ship. If, however, a n English ship sailed with the permission of the English king to plunder the s hips of other nations, it was a privateer ship. The Templars answered to no one except the pope, wh o did not, according to record, issue letters of marque. When the Templars cap- tured enemy ships, they claimed they were acting on behalf of their nominal ruler, the pope. But the ships of the Templ ar order did not stop there, and often the ships of other Christian kings were fair game. Most of the Templar fleet was originally the low-ly ing galleys, which were similar to those used by the Muslim pira tes of the Barbary Coast. They were ideally suited for the coastal tra de and equally suited for piracy, as they could maneuver into shallow wat ers and were not forced to depend on the winds. The Atlantic fleet o f the Templars used the sail, which allowed it to navigate the oceans a s well. Christian Europe and Muslim Africa and Asia were at war for hun- dreds of years, but on a cultural basis many connec tions were made. Simon Dansker, a Flemish adventurer, showed the Nor th African pirates the use of the long-range sailing ship in piracy Da nsker started his career in the French port of Marseilles but soon changed s ides and names. As Dali Rais, which means Captain Devil, Dansker switc hed to the side of the Barbary pirates and captured Christian ships. U nder his tutelage the Muslim pirates extended their range into the Adanti c. A Muslim fleet even sailed to Iceland, where the pirates took slav es and plundered. But Dansker changed sides one too many times and was ha nged in Tunis. The Templar fleet was made up of whatever ships cou ld be built or"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The New World Order 19 bought or captured from its enemies. The range of t he Templars' sailing ships extended from the North Atlantic to the easte rn Mediterranean. The ships carried goods and pilgrims from Italy to the Holy Lands. With no fear of reprisals, the Templars engaged in piracy when profit could not be made in legitimate ways. For those who manned the Templar fleet, the career jump from privateer for t he order to pirate for one's own gain was small. One early Templar-turned-pirate was Roger de Flor.T he son of the falconer of Emperor Frederick II, the eight-year-ol d Roger was taken on as a cabin boy in the Templar port of Brindisi. Working his way up through the ranks of the Templar navy, he soon assu med command of a ship bought from the Genoese. He named his ship the Falcon. When the final stronghold of Acre was being besieged, de Flo r learned a new skill: extortion. He used his ship to raise money for his future career as a pirate by charging to rescue \"ladies and damsels and great treasure.\" 7 De Flor eventually fell out of favor with the order and his ship remained in Temple hands, but he had earned enough money to buy a new ship. Through piracy and later mercenary work, he built a fortune and an army. The renegade Templar even earned the hand of the niece of the Byzantine emperor. It was not only renegade knights who would resort t o piracy; both orders, the Templars and the Order of Saint John, p rofited from their ability to loot Mediterranean ports and merchant sh ips, just as the Muslim fleets profited from their capture of Christ ian ships. For hundreds of years different ports around the wo rld played host to pirates and resisted or ignored the authority of any governments. Ports such as the pirate kingdom of Saint Mary's in Madagascar, where the only government was that of pirates in exile or hiding, served the European pirates who preyed on the silver ships of the Moghuls of India. In the Americas, Tortuga and the Bahamas wou ld enjoy shorter periods as pirate refuges. Even where ports had an official government, they were often ruled by those who supported piracy , such as those in Port Royal, Jamaica. One of the greatest pirate ports of the medieval pe riod was Mahdia,"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"20 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life on the North African coast. In the three hundred ye ars that the Knights Templar fought the Islamic conquerors of the Medite rranean Sea, there were numerous periods of truce during which Arabs a nd Christians exchanged ideas. The Europeans learned about histor y, religion (includ- ing their own), science, mathematics, and medicine from their enemies. The greatness of such interchange of culture cannot be measured, but the Crusades had an enormous effect on Europe. Acad emic knowledge was not all the Templars learned; they also picked up new military and naval skills and a tolerance for their Islamic coun terparts. The result was that many ex-Templars simply switched sides and joi ned the Barbary pirates. Author John J. Robinson suspects the Scott ish \"Mason's word\" mahabone is a corruption of Mahdia the good, just a s the French Marie le Bon (Marie the Good) survives in English as maryleb one. 8 Templar sea power is often downplayed in comparison to their mil- itary land maneuvers. The Templar navy and merchant fleets were well acquainted with the Baltic Sea, the British Isles, large portions of the African coast, the Mediterranean Sea, and even the Black Sea. They sailed as far as their Norman predecessors, and the ir purpose was not only trade and plunder; supplying food and munition s, carrying troops and pilgrims, and playing host to kings and their g oods were important in the long conflict against the Islamic nations. When the war with these countries abated, the war b etween the Christians filled the gap. In 1256 two Christian fa ctions formed over who should possess Acre. The Hospitallers came to t he aid of the Genoese and Catalan merchants to fight the navy of Venice, which was joined by the Templar fleet. 9 Despite the fact that one of the Templar rules forbade killing a Christian, turf wars existe d and the act of killing fellow Christians was \"absolved\" by the necessity o f preserving the wealth and power.

The kn ights had already lost"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The New World Order 21 Jerusalem, and now their last fortress was captured by their rivals. Public opinion quickly turned against the order. In the ey es of the world the Templars had lost their mission and were now simply a fat organization of creditors, landlords, and competitors with an at titude to boot. \"Haughty as a Templar\" was a phrase coined by Sir W alter Scott. His novels describe an order that turned its back on it s founders. Once ded- icated to poverty and obedience, the Templars becam e guilty of pride, arrogance, and, by the beginning of the fourteenth century, possessing more wealth than European kings. Pope Nicholas IV, the theoretical commander in chief of the order, publicly directed his anger against the Templars, blaming their squabbling with the rival H ospitaller order as the reason that the last Christian bastion in the H oly Lands was now in Islamic hands. The Templars allowed themselves to b e viewed as unin- terested in protecting the most sacred possessions of the Christian world. A Church council had decided that the only way to f ight an effec- tive war against Islam was to have a unified force of its own. The coun- cil proposed merging the fighting orders, but the o rders refused. The Teutonic Knights of Germany and Prussia returned to Marienburg.The Knights of Saint John moved to Malta. The Templars moved to Cyprus. 10 Although the Templar order had abandoned Acre, it w ould not abandon its own possessions. To an outsider, the Te mplars seemed to be on a crusade only to protect their enormous wealth. In a watershed event that would become known as the Eperstoun Affair, a knight who pledged half his wife's estate to enter the order died. When the order came to claim the murdered mem ber's property, his widow refused to leave. Templars were sent to e vict the widow, and they had to literally drag the woman from her home. As she clung to the doorpost of her house, the knights chopped off her fingers. Even before public media, this was a \"media\" event so co mpelling that it reached the ears of King Edward I. When he heard ab out the treatment of the widow, he interceded to restore her property .

Set against a backdrop of military losses, the tran sgressions of the order were becoming too much to defend. In 1306 a n ew pope, Clement V, was elected. Before becoming the pope he was Bertrand de Got, the Archbishop of Bordeaux. His elevation t o the highest rank in the Church was engineered by his brother Beraud, who was the Archbishop of Lyon. In June 1305, when the kings of France, England, and Naples had representatives bickering over who s hould be the next pope, the choice came down to the least objectionab le person 12 ; Bertrand de Got had achieved that distinction. The French king cer- tainly did not object to de Got, and to the dismay of the Italians, he never left France. He was considered weak and ineff ective, and the Italians believed that in establishing his papacy a t Avignon he gave proof that he was simply a puppet of the king of France. The new pope was in an awkward position. On the one hand, he was related on his mother's side to Bertrand de Bla nchefort, a Templar grand master. On the other hand, the power of the F rench king appeared more threatening. He would stall as long a s he could in mak- ing decisions. It is possible that Clement V alread y saw the writing on the wall that told him that unless he took action h e would lose both of his orders. His first act was to ask the new grand master of the Templars and the grand master of the Knights of Saint John f or a written sum- mary enumerating the reasons for and against a merg er of the orders. Jacques de Molay, the leader of the Templars, answe red the pope, and may have been aware that the ultimate goal of the F rench king was to head a united order as the rex ballator, the warrio r king. At the very least, Molay knew he would be out of the number one positi on. Despite the less-than-satisfactory answer, the pope hesitated to take action. He was not unaware that agents of the king of France had been responsible for the death of Boniface VIII and poss ibly the death by poi- son of Benedict XI, according to rumor. King Philip of France decided the time was ripe to remedy the impasse. Because France was the home base of the Cr usades and had"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The New World Order 23 borne the heavy cost of war, Philip was impatient t o repair his finances. Earlier preachers such as Saint Bernard had often c leaned out a town of its men, inspiring them to take up the crusade. The orders had been the beneficiaries of thousands of donated estates. The Church had declared that the state should not tax the fighting men or t he estates of the order. The net result to the French king was a depleted tr easury. He took back from the Templars the management of his own finance s in 1295, creat- ing the Royal Treasury at the Louvre. He then debas ed the currency and turned on the Italian banking families. How close the Italian banking families were connect ed to the Knights Templar may never be known. They initially played a role in financing the Crusades and in transporting the crus aders. In Florence, where the city minted its own coins, they would pay respect to the patron saint of the order, Saint John the Baptist, on one side of the coins. The other side depicted the lily, hinting at a royal bloodline. Florence is one of the very few places where an oct agonal baptistery stands. This unusual style of baptistery was borrow ed from Jerusalem and taken to many Templar strongholds. From Tomar i n Portugal to Drogheda in Ireland, these structures represented t he original baptism of Jesus Christ by Saint John. The baptistery in Fl orence was dedicated to Saint John the Baptist. After maneuvers against the Lombards, Philip the Fa ir would prove himself to be anything but fair when it came to rep lenishing his treas- ury. He forced the Jews out of France in an attempt to seize their prop- erty and restore his wealth. But the Jews hadn't be en as prosperous as he thought, and the move accomplished little. Phili p was deeply in debt—and mostly to the Templar bank. What better way to fix the situation than to seize that bank? On October 13, 1307, Philip's forces descended on a ll the Templar preceptories in France. The pope was dismayed; tech nically, only he had jurisdiction over the Templars. But Philip's forces threatened the pope, so he quickly went along with the king. Philip woul d soon be dismayed as well. Templar spies had gotten wind of the impen ding arrests. Having commanded a large fighting force, a large navy, and a large merchant"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"24 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life fleet, and having possessed the world's largest ban k, through which they were close to aristocrats and clerics around Europe , the Templars had intelligence operations that were certainly superio r to those of the French king. Jacques de Molay called in the order's books and had them burned. Many knights went underground. And perhaps most signifi- cantly, the treasure held in Paris, the second most desired possession of King Philip, vanished. The combination of the missing treasure, the burned books, and the meek surrender of the Templars is intriguing. If th e Templars under- stood that arrest was imminent, why didn't they all flee or prepare to fight back? The only explanation is that the order believed that Philip's target was strictly monetary, and that once deprive d of the Templar bank, his suppression of the order would be short-l ived. If this conclusion is correct, then the members of the order who stayed behind were simply unprepared for the incred ible horrors to which the arrested knights would be subjected. Unde r torture that included the rack, the strappado, and the burning o f fat-smeared feet, the Templars confessed to anything. Because the cha rge was heresy, the arrested had no right to counsel. Normally torture would be allowed to the extent that it would accomplish its goal but no t cause mutilation or permanent injury. For the Templars, however, an exc eption was made. The torture was \"carried out with a barbarity which even medieval men found shocking.\" 13 Confined to dungeons, sustained with bread and water, accused of the most heinous perversions, and tortured beyond endurance, many knights lost their ability t o reason, several committed suicide, and most confessed to anything. Those who survived the two years of imprisonment ha d little to look forward to other than their death. In May 1310 the soldiers of Philip bound fifty-four Knights Templar to carts an d brought them to fields near the convent of Saint-Antoine outside Pa ris, where they were stripped, tied to stakes, and burned to death. The king of France broke the order but failed to co nfiscate their treasure. He was further disappointed by the reacti on of his fellow kings; instead of the other nations suppressing the Templars within their"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The New World Order 25 borders, they had to be goaded into taking any step s against the knights. In England, Edward II was very slow in reacting to the demands of the Roman pope. The new king was simply unintereste d, as his focus was on the continuing war with Scodand and on his lover . After persistent pressure from the pope, Edward made a handful of ar rests and later suc- cumbed to the Church's demand for torture, which wa s forbidden by English law. Edward did not shield the Templar orga nization and allowed its property to be seized. To the disappointment of the Church, however, the property seized did not revert to the Church bu t instead was distrib- uted by Edward in his own fashion, most likely to h is creditors and allies. Scotland finally agreed in principle to an inquisit ion of the Templars. The country had continually fought the pope, who wo uld eventually excommunicate both the king and the nation. The deg ree of compliance in Scotland was minimal, with a total of two knight s questioned. In Spain and Portugal the Templar fighting force wa s important to the kings. After a few arrests and seizures, the Po rtuguese quickly rein- corporated the order into the Knights of Christ, wh ich now reported only to the Portuguese king. In the parts of Spain controlled by the Inquisition there were arrests and torture, but the order and its men were soon incorporated into several other orders of the Spanish military. In Germany the Teutonic Knights, which had been for med sepa- rately, marched into the court at Metz armed to the teeth and chal- lenged the court to bring charges. They were not Te mplars but presented their case to head off similar charges. T he court assured the order its existence was not in danger. Although all this frustrated Philip, his greatest f rustration was the dis- appearance of the treasure from the Paris Temple Ba nk. It had reportedly been loaded on a wagon train that raced for the por t of La Rochelle. There the treasure was placed aboard the Templar fl eet, again flying the skull and crossbones, from which it disappeared onc e more. While many of the French Templars who were captured suffered l ong imprison- ments and gruesome tortures, many others, who were now regarded as outlaws, used the Templar fleet as their home base. It was difficult for a large, armed group of men to escape detection on la nd, but the ships"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"26 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life provided a mobile hideout as well as a place to liv e. With their immense treasure supplemented with piracy, the Templars who had escaped France survived. The final act against the order was committed on Ma rch 18, 1314. The four surviving officials of the order—the grand master, the visitor, and the preceptors of Aquitaine and Normandy—were b urned on an island in the Seine River in view of the Royal Gard ens. THE RESURRECTION OF THE TEMPLARS While the arrested French Templars suffered impriso nment, torture, and often execution, the remnant Templar organization b ecame like the mythical Hydra; one head was cut off at the neck an d others sprouted. The new organizations in Germany, Portugal, and Spa in were all vari- ous Templar reincarnations. In Germany the Teutonic Knights needed their own ra ison d'etre, and they quickly found one. They turned their atten tion from the armies of Islam, which were apparendy too strong for Europ e, to the more eas- ily conquered pagan Lithuanians. A new northern \"cr usade\" found the well-equipped Teutonic Knights doing battle with th e Lithuanian peas- ant farmers and converting or killing them in short order. This new cru- sade was less an instrument of the Catholic Church for converting the world than a weapon in the German war of expansion. In the Iberian Peninsula the war against Islam was still an active conflict. The kings of Portugal and Spain needed al l the help they could muster. Spain's most sacred pilgrimage spot was Sai nt James of Compostela. The order of the Knights of Santiago (w hose name was derived from the Spanish Santo Iago, or Saint James ) performed activi- ties that were similar to the original efforts of t he Templars: It protected pilgrims along the world's second most important ro ute. In neighbor- ing Portugal the \"new\" Knights of Christ were allow ed to keep the properties and preceptories of the former Templar o rder and even the Templar banner, a red cross on a white background. The order has sur- vived in that form to the present."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The New World Order 27 In England the Templars' survival would not be as s imple. The English version of suppression united the Templars with their rival order, the Knights Hospitaller of Saint John. This order pleased the demands of the Church, but according to some source s it was a cha- rade. Templar property was administered separately for years. East of France, the Alpine regions that would later become Switzerland provided refuge to the Templar knights. When their trad- ing routes were not by sea, the Templars used the s ame Alpine passes to reach Italy and Germany that other merchants had us ed for more than a thousand years. The order had fortified preceptor ies in various can- tons, and the power of the order soon grew. Three m onths after the fall of Acre, three of the cantons formed a military all iance. They were quickly joined by others, and the unified state of Switzerland would take on many of the characteristics of the order. T hey were respected for having a fierce army that defended itself again st the expansionist German states to the north and the avaricious Franc e to the west. The knights' reputation grew rapidly, and soon the Swis s Guard, as it became known, was contracted to defend the Vatican, just a s the Templars had defended the Catholic religion. The Swiss, of course, soon earned another reputatio n: that of banker to the world. In The Warriors and the Banker s authors Alan Butler and Stephen Dafoe point out that, although the trea sury in Paris might have been the Templars' greatest central bank, the order would certainly not have kept all its valuables in one location. Sw itzerland grew in importance because of its political neutrality and its position as the cen- tral bank of the world. While the bank would no lon ger have the advan- tage of state and religious backing, it possessed a very advantageous geographical location. Few would underestimate the ability of a coun- try with a well-trained military and the access of the Alpine passes. Anyone who has had to deal with an Alpine banker mi ght be reminded of the \"haughty\" description of the Templars given by Sir Walter Scott, as more than one trait was passed from the Templars to the Swiss. The discipline and secrecy maintained by Swiss bankers, however, allowed them to achieve dominance both for their bank and f or their currency."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"28 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life The Swiss franc took on a mantle of stability that was possibly second only to gold. Butler and Dafoe refer to the survival of the Templ ars as well as Switzerland's inheritance of the world banking indu stry. The authors observe the stunning resemblance of the Templar red -cross motif to the emblems of Switzerland—the country as well as its c antons. The Templar cross has been simply reversed in color to become t he flag of a united Switzerland, and other variations would become the canton flags. THE TEMPLAR UNDERGROUND Most dramatically, the post-1307 Templar order took the form of a huge underground organization. This form developed in the north where the resurrected French Templars who sailed wi th the Templar treasure fleet to Scotland reunited under the Anglo -Norman cousins of the French Normans. In France, the St. Clair family had been one of the handful of elite families that were instrumental in founding the new Templar order. The Scottish branch of the St. Clair family, which had Anglicized the spelling of its surname to Sinclair, would preserve the order. They allied themselves with Robert the Bruce, of the French Nor man de Brus family, whose name had also been Anglicized. At Ban nockburn, Robert defeated the English in the most decisive battle th e Scots had ever expe- rienced against their oppressors. The victory came shortly after a fresh force of Templar cavalry charged onto the battlefie ld. But the Templars remained underground in Scotland, even after the end of the War of Scottish Independence. Some of th e more noble knights continued their careers as mercenaries. Evi dence shows that twelve years after the Battle of Bannockburn the Sc ottish mercenaries returned to France under the employ of the D'Anjous , another Norman family that helped found the Templars. There they fought under Joan of Arc in a war that history has done li ttle to explain. Others, more often the rank and file, put their ski lls of construction and engineering to work in the trades. As a militar y force, the Templars"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The New World Order 29 spent more time building than fighting. Thus the kn ights learned the building trades by constructing houses, bridges, an d castles. After 1307 they put these skills to work in building many of E urope's finest mon- uments, including cathedrals. French Templars had little trouble fitting in, as t he French language was spoken in the British Isles and was for years t o come the language of the court. French Templar words were corrupted i nto their British counterparts. Remnant Templars, while fighting as p aid mercenaries, building bridges, or working in the trades, remaine d organized in underground lodges. They often employed secret word s and handshakes to recognize each other and came to one another's a id. Their sons, too, would keep up the tradition. The term Freemason entered the English language in the same cen- tury that the Knights Templar, as an order, was off icially dissolved. The term was another corruption of the French language; the Templar knights originally referred to each other as brother, or fr ere in French. What was frere macon in France became Freemason in English. When the Templars traveled they erected quarters, and these became lo dges, so named after the French loges. The guard posted at the door of t he lodge during meet- ings was the tyler, in English, derived from taille ur, meaning \"one who cuts.\" But the term Freemason soon took on a new me aning. Unlike most of the populace, which was shackled to the land by the feudal system that prevailed in England and France, the former Templar s became working craftsmen who were free to travel to find employmen t. At a construction site, which could be a cathedral, a castle, or a pub- lic building, the masons would band together and er ect a lodge. Most lodges were not permanent, but would be built to pr otect the property of the traveling men. Masons promised that if a bro ther mason came to them, they would find him work, give him money, and , when he was ready to leave, direct him to another lodge. Why wo uld this be such an important charge for Freemasonry? Because in a feud al system, finding a home was nearly impossible for the remnant member s of an outlaw order. All their old ties were broken and there was no home to return to—certainly not back in France. Freemasonry was cr eated to protect"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"30 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life those whose lives were threatened because of their association with the Knights Templar. A Masonic initiation specifically states that the b rothers are there to feed you, to clothe you, and to protect you from yo ur enemies. The ini- tiation also enigmatically states, \"We will keep yo ur secrets.\"' 4 Why a simple stonemason would attract enemies and have se crets that needed protecting is questionable. But it is not so hard t o understand the need for secrets and protection from enemies for an outl aw Templar. The building trades and crafts were an opportunity for ex-Templars and later for their sons. The name Lewis came from a term meaning \"son of a mason,\" a status that was usually the onl y requirement needed for entrance into a lodge. It was also helpful in g aining employment. In The Hiram Key, Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas write, \"Now we are certain, without any shadow of a doubt, that the starting place of Freemasonry was the construction of Rosslyn Chap el.\" 15 This chapel was built on Sinclair property under the direction of the Sinclair fam- ily, members of whom would become the hereditary gr and masters of the crafts and guilds and orders of Scotland. For m any former knights, Scotland was now home and building was their trade. Some ex-Templars did not fit into the new way of li fe. Not all the former Templars were masons and craftsmen; some too k to the high- ways as brigands and some to the seas as pirates. T he skull and cross- bones, the same battle flag that had been used for piracy by the Templars, remained the flag of choice for pirates a fter the Crusades. The skull and bones announced the ship was a pirate shi p. While it had a religious significance, to the elite order it also had a more practical use: to instill fear in the hearts of those under attack . It warned that there was not to be any other action except surrender. If that was not heeded, an all-red flag declared no quarter to be given. Li ke many of the Scot Templar words that have been derived from French, t he battle flag was called the Jolly Roger, from the French joli rouge (pretty red). Later, the name Jolly Roger was given to both flags. The black skull and crossbones flag would come to b e recognized as an indicator of a pirate ship. The skull and two bones, however, had"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The New World Order 31 a much deeper meaning to the original Templars who sailed under the flag. Their insignia represented resurrection. The Catholic Church taught that the resurrection of man was a bodily re surrection. But the Templars believed, contrary to the Church, that onl y a skull and two bones needed to be buried in order for a person to be admitted into heaven. The skull and crossed bones became a popula r motif on Templar graves. To those who had dedicated their wealth and committed their lives to the Templar order, the skull and bones sug gested that the Templar organization itself had been resurrected. T he Templar fleet, in particular, was alive and well. It had survived the army of the French king and the Roman pope and would conquer again. Just as the Templars had used military organization during the long war against Islam, they now used military organizat ion against their new enemies. Upon coming into contact with a ship, the skull and cross- bones would be raised. If this was not enough to ma ke the pursued ship surrender, the Templars raised the red flag, the Jo lly Roger, meaning that \"no quarter,\" or no mercy, would be granted. The me ssage was quickly learned by the captains who plied the seas with the wares of merchants. Few would wait for the red flag. The skull and crossbones continued to rule Europe's seas long after the Templar order was officially in the grave. The New World too would be threatened by the skull and crossbones, and well after America's independence the remnant Templars would still exert their influence and power."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 BROTHERS TO PIRATES AND CORSAIRS nder the skull and crossbones, the fleet of the ex- Templars roamed the seas. The menacing flag that to the Cath olics had rep- resented resurrection now represented the resurrect ion of the outlawed order. Lacking the same allegiance to the pope in R ome, the order now served mostly to preserve and enrich itself. The sh ips that were once manned by knights and sworn to protect religious pi lgrims now threat- ened anyone who traveled, transported goods, or tra ded on the high seas. Rarely was retaliation considered. Even more rare was the capture of a pirate ship; it was said that in that event, a flash of a secret signal might allow a pirate ship a pass from its captors. Templar power was not to be underestimated. The fragmented Templars had succeeded in the goal o f resurrecting the order. At the same time, the pirates who ravage d the seas would keep alive the Templar ideals of liberty, equality, and the protection of their own. Ironically, the ideals of a corrupt orga nization would become the basis of American democracy.

W ithin the confines of the monastery, the preceptory, and the pirate sh ip, leaders were elected by their peers and could be removed by them . It was a concept foreign to a feudal system, where birth and propert y determined title and position. No one person was absolute; leaders w ere expected to act in the interest of the group. The Cistercian monks, ex-Templar pirates, and Templ ar knights had other interesting similarities. In a world dominate d by a feudal order that used taxes and duties to force all wealth to t he top, the Templars, the Cistercian monks, and the pirates held wealth i n common for hun- dreds of years. This is not to be confused with a v ow of poverty or even with socialism. Rewards such as greater amenities w ere given to those who exercised more responsibility. A pirate captain was often entitled to a double share of booty, and the quartermaster migh t get a share and a half for his role. It was strictly a result of meri t. The failure to lead or a propensity for greed could bring down a knight, an abbot, or a pirate captain. The ultimate irony is that democracy arose within o rders created by feudal powers. In this new social experiment, title , family name, and appointed power were all secondary to the ability t o lead and bring benefit to all. The ideals of liberty and fraternit y surfaced despite the intentions of the feudal rulers. Of course, not all pirates were Templars, and the o rder did not invent the art of robbery on the high seas. The ex- Templar pirates, how- ever, were very distinct from other organized pirat es. The pirates who served aboard the ships of Islam, or even on the sh ips of the rival order of Saint John, had more in common with the later En glish navy. The captain of the ship, who was most often appointed a s a result of high birth or favor, would get the majority of the spoil s; the common sea- men were often treated only a little better than th e galley slaves who served the fleets of Rome. Life aboard the pirate ship was democratic, but it was still a feudal world on the shores of the civilized world. Pirates were still forced to deal with this reality. For example, ships were eno rmously expensive,"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"34 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life and therefore piracy was an institution that was ge nerally not open to the average man. In a world that knew no form of ca pitalism, there were few ways to accumulate the funds to buy a ship . If a ship was cap- tured, it still had to be allowed to land in a safe port and to sell its captured wares. This meant having the right connections. In the world of the for- mer Templars, connections often came in the form of elite families that served to assist the remnant Templars and benefited from the role played behind the scenes. Both the Templar version of pira cy and the non- Templar version of piracy depended on hidden guardi ans. The institu- tion of piracy was allowed to exist by the various states and kingdoms as long as it could be officially denied and it pro vided a benefit to the monarch who had domain over the pirate's home port. MEDIEVAL PIRACY Pirates often enjoyed the lackadaisical approach of the various mon- archs. Well before becoming the ruler of the high s eas, England had one of the poorest defense forces. Dutch, Flemish, and Breton pirates raided the English Channel from the twelfth through the si xteenth centuries, simply because it was frequently easy to do. The ki ng would benefit lit- tle by wasting resources to protect the goods of me rchants. Prior to the arrest and prosecution of the Templar order, Henry III ignored the piracy the various French states inflic ted upon English merchants. 1 English pirates were given carte blanche to plunde r if they would offer a share in the spoils to their corrupt monarch. This pattern repeated itself in the American colonies centuries later when governors turned not a blind eye but a greedy eye on the prof its made by pirates. A share in the spoils was usually enough to buy cle mency. Edward I, the successor to Henry III, attempted to attack pirate bases by land, as England had no real navy at the t ime. He was alter- nately at war against the Welsh and the Scots, who considered English merchants easy targets. Failing in his attempt to f ight a war against the pirates by land, Edward I instituted the practice o f issuing marques, or letters of reprisal. Such letters granted a mercha nt or shipmaster the"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Brothers to Pirates and Corsairs 35 right to attack the pirates or their home port if t he merchant or ship- per could claim to have suffered a loss at the pira tes' hands. 2 Other ports would then have their monarchs issue the same type of documents, which allowed them to plunder an English port shoul d they be the vic- tims of an English pirate. Edward's lack of ability to rule the seas was match ed by his inepti- tude at ruling on land. His interference in the mor ass of bloody politics that was Scotland led to many wars. The wars agains t Scotland and the lack of centralized order in England would allow Sc otland to flourish as a pirate haven. THE TEMPLARS AND SCOTLAND A simple act would serve as the catalyst for new ho stility between England and Scotland. Alexander III, the Scottish k ing, had preserved neutrality, but in 1284 he was killed—not in battle , but from falling off his horse after a night of partying. Six guardians were appointed to ease the successorship, and for a brief time these guard ians ruled Scotland. But Edward I of England exercised his right to choo se who would suc- ceed Alexander. Of the handful of claimants to the Scottish throne, the leading candidate was John Baliol, who was supporte d by the powerful Comyn family. The other main candidate was Robert t he Bruce, who had the support of his country. 3 Edward's court picked Baliol. When Baliol and the Comyns would not back Edward in internal conflicts, Robert would support Edward, which gave Robert the opportunity to reclaim his lands from Baliol and th e Comyns. After the Wallace Revolt, Scotland was controlled by the triu mvirate of Bishop William Lamberton of St. Andrew's, Robert the Bruce , and John Comyn. On February 10, 1306, Robert somehow managed to get Comyn to meet him at the Church of the Greyfriars i n Dumfries. While neither side trusted the other, the hallowed sanctuary made Comyn assume he was safe from violence. He was wron g. Robert the Bruce eliminated Comyn in the church by stabbing him and leaving him to die on the stone floor. There ar e several versions of"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"36 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life what transpired, but it is very likely that the att ack was spontaneous. When Robert ran from the church and told his confed erate what he had done, the man ran into the church. Seeing Comyn already in the care of the friars, the confederate rushed to the w ounded man and stabbed him again until he was sure Comyn was dead. Robert then had himself sworn in as king by Bishop Lamberton in the Abbey Church at Scone. Despite the official coronation, both England and t he Catholic Church made sure that Robert the Bruce would not ta ke a throne. For several years he was an outlaw king, pursued first by Edward, who died in the campaign against Robert, and then by Edward' s son, Edward II. Robert spent the early years of his reign living in caves and traveling in disguise. He was not only outlawed by the king of E ngland, he was also excommunicated by the pope. Robert's exile did not last forever. His salvation was realized at the Battle of Bannockburn, but events that took place h undreds of miles away from the battlefield helped tip the scales in his favor. The same papacy that made Robert an outlaw of the only offic ial religion in Europe had also declared the Knights Templar to be outlaws. The Templar fleet and the remnant organization that man aged to escape from La Rochelle in the nick of time found refuge i n Scotland. The St. Clair family of France, a powerful force behind the Templars, had most likely negotiated an alliance with Robert thro ugh its Scottish side of the family, the Sinclairs. The French had probably been arming Robert since 13 10 by smuggling arms into Ireland and then into Scotland. At this point they smuggled an entire army to aid Robert. While the hi story of Scotland both before and after Robert the Bruce is riddled w ith one defeat after another at the hands of much more organized and bet ter-equipped armies, the Battle of Bannockburn was the exception . In this historic battle, which was contested on June 24, 1314, a sac red day to the Templar knights, the battle at first seemed to go w ell for Edward's army. He had at his disposal twenty thousand soldiers and three thousand knights on horseback, who fought against a force le ss than half their"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Brothers to Pirates and Corsairs 37 size. But just when victory seemed at hand, a fresh contingent of knights came charging from the rear of the Scottish force to soundly and spectacularly beat Edward's troops. The remnant Knights Templar led Scotland to victory over the English army, whic h made Scotland independent of its overlord. An elite group that was at the core of the Knights Templar existed in France and Scotland prior to the arrests, and th ey remained united afterward. At the heart of this group was the famil y of St. Clair. In Europe they started as part of the Norse wave of co nquerors that changed the face of the continent. The St. Clairs a nd their Norse coun- trymen were called Normans, and they settled in nor thern France, where the king handed over great amounts of land in exchange for being allowed to keep the rest. Under William the C onqueror, the Normans successfully invaded England.This resulted in members of the St. Clair family being granted tracts of land in En gland and Scotland. The St. Clair branch eventually changed its name to the more Anglicized Sinclair, but the family connections in France, Scotland, and even to a degree in their Norse homeland remained i ntact. The St. Clair/Sinclair family became a very strong presence in the politics of both France and Scotland. Although they preferred a sec- ondary role in the public eye, they often controlle d the politics from behind the scenes. The loyalty of a strong military was one component of their power. After Bannockburn, Henry Sinclair, a descendant of the French noble St. Clair family, organized the remnant Templars in to military units and guilds. They would become the integral force of his power base, and he in turn would become their guardian. In 1320 Sir He nry signed a letter to Pope John XXII asserting the independence of Sco tland. This was a unique document in the history of the world, predat ing the American Declaration of Independence by more than four centu ries. While Sinclair never played the leading role, he ruled quietly fro m behind the scenes, and the remnant Templars were his \"big stick.\" They would remain united, and cemented their loyalty to their benefac tor."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"38 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life THE GUILD AND THE LODGE In times of peace the ex-Templars used their skills as masons, carpenters, bridge builders, and merchants. The guild brought t ogether members of a single trade. As the guilds became specialized, t he Templars who had been seamen under the Templar flag now organized in to a group that manned the Sinclair fleet, which was among the larg est in Europe. The sea remained a gateway to riches, often more so in turbulent times. A fleet needed merchants, and the merchants themselves were also organized in guilds, which were the models for later companies. The concept of guilds was originated by merchants a nd craftsmen. Their work often included secretive operations, as they had to deal with the prying eyes of the tax man, the competition of other guilds in the same craft, and even the Catholic Church. The Churc h had declared that a person who bought something with the intenti on of selling it at a higher price was cast out of \"God's Temple.\" 4 Towns were actually cre- ated by the guilds to employ workers in the manufac turing process and for the purpose of meeting to buy and sell their wa res. In modern Italy, the guild system and its secrecy prevail. Some town s are still dominated by one industry, and workers in that industry will reveal absolutely no information to an outsider. Guilds grew into larger merchant \"companies\" licens ed to sell goods abroad. Because Scotland and Europe exported wool, shipown- ers would transport the merchants who wanted to car ry the products to continental Europe. In this less-than-golden age of freebooting, pirates attacked ships even for such mundane cargoe s. Therefore, mer- chants needed a strong ship or fleet of ships to na vigate the pirate- infested waters. The Templars, inheritors of a mili tary organization, provided the strength. Post-Bannockburn, the seas of commerce were anythin g but con- ducive to trade. The Dutch pirates would attack the English wool fleet—and often under letters of marque issued in t heir own country. The English king Edward II had temporarily stopped issuing such pri- vateering papers, instead opting not to patrol the Scottish shores."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Brothers to Pirates and Corsairs 39 Unrestricted piracy against Scotland grew, but it h ad the effect of mak- ing the illegal business more lucrative. Privateers and pirates from the Low Countries, from the Hanseatic League, from Fran ce, and from the Channel Islands now regularly attacked English ship s. Because the rela- tions between Scotland and England were at best ten se, the Low Countries could also be counted on to provide milit ary equipment and food to Scotland, an act that the Scots regarded as necessary trade and the English considered smuggling. The history of Scotland is murky at this time, and naval history even more so, as it was in no one's interest to rec ord piracy. The fleet of Sinclair in the post-Bannockburn years is known to have been one of Europe's greatest; Sinclair had at his command m ore ships than Edward II of England. The same irregular coast and innumerable island hideouts had protected and hidden ships for hundred s of years before the reign of Edward II, and it continued to do so f or hundreds of years after. In 1919 the German fleet was scuttled at Sca pa Flow in the north- ern islands rather than surrender from its hiding p lace. The Sinclair fleet underwent a major change in the years after Bannockburn. Sinclair ships had been built like tho se of their Norse relations, in the thin, overlapping oak-planked sty le that made them light and flexible. But Sinclair now had to react t o the heavier style of ship being built in England. He built a castle in K irkwall, in the north- ern islands, imported the necessary lumber, and bui lt thicker-planked warships to accompany his Orkney galley ships. 5 The fleet of the Sinclairs was now so strong that i t was used to defend possessions of the king of Norway, who had a much smaller fleet that was \"too weak to defend her own coasts against pirates.\" 6 At this time Stockholm had been seized by a pirate navy cal led the Victual Brothers, or the Victualleurs. They soon raided the Norwegian coast and sacked the city of Bergen. The Templars who had come to Scotland to the protec tion of Robert the Bruce and Henry Sinclair found employmen t aboard Sinclair's neo-Templar fleet. They also served in t heir military tradition in newly formed land fighting units—and for the sam e elite masters."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"40 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life THE RELIGIOUS WARS The backlash against the wealth and power of the Ca tholic Church had started long before Martin Luther. In France the Ca thar movement was a desire to return to a \"pure\" Christianity not obs tructed by indolent priests and avaricious bishops. The Church quickly moved to stamp out the heresy and sent Saint Bernard, the Templar prop onent, to investigate the Cathar sect. He discovered the movement to be l arger than the Church thought, and he also believed it to be a mos t Christian example of living. The Church disregarded his report and se nt Simon de Montfort of Leicester, England, to lead an army against them . The viciousness of the war may be evidence of just how severe Rome regarded the threat. At Beziers the papal lega te was asked how to recognize the Cathari. He responded, \"Kill them all, God will know his own.\" 7 Simon de Montfort was brutality personified, burni ng many at the stake and blinding or cutting off the noses of those he allowed to live. The order of the Knights Templar, sworn to obey onl y the pope, was not only visibly absent in the war against the Cathari; in some cases members fought on the side of the heretics against Rome. At Montsegur sixty knights served against the papal ar my. The Cathari, like the ex-Templars in the next century and the Freemas ons thereafter, had secret signs and words to recognize their members. When the knights arrived in Cathar territory the password was \"Have you brought the hatchets?\"The answer was \"We have eleven, freshly h oned.\" Montsegur would end in defeat for the Cathari, but the anti-R ome sentiment sim- ply went underground. The Templar organization had less than a century to survive until Rome would turn against it. The Templars may have h ad more than ample reason to harbor anti-Church sentiments, but these would remain underground from the time of the battle at M ontsegur until the Templar persecutions.

The Reformation also divided the former Templ ar knights on both political and religious grounds. As the Reformation took hold in Scotland, the origi nal core Templar group remained Catholic, including the Sinc lair family, which was described as ardently Catholic and suffered as a result. In France, where the church and state had persecuted the Templ ars the most, for- mer seaport stronghold La Rochelle would become, li ke many French ports, Huguenot—that is, Protestant. The religious wars pitted brother against brother, as did any civil war. The Freemasons, the surviving ex-Templars, would re main under- ground, the lodge system not yet in its official (p ost-1717) period. The symbols of the anti-Rome movement among the Cathari and the sym- bol of the French Protestants in the north of Franc e were often shared. The dove (the symbol of personal enlightenment), th e eight-pointed cross, and the hatchet would grace the apparel and equipment of Huguenots and Freemasons. The wars also divided the ex-Templars and Masons along political lines, placing members of th e descendant orders on both sides. The English king Edward III managed to pit his country against Catholic France in what would become known as the Hundred Years War. Some of the original founding Templar fa milies acted for the Catholic side. The Scottish-French alliance created by the family con- nections behind the Templars set the ex-Templars an d their heirs along- side the French in fighting England. But not all ex -Templars were seagoing warriors. On land the Scots Guard became t he inheritors of the Templar tradition. In 1445, one hundred years after the Templars were abolished and the French Templars fled to Scotland, the neo-Templ ar Scots Guard, or the Compagnie des Gendarmes Ecossis, returned to Fr ance to intervene in French military adventures.

In France they were organized under Frenc h names. They were paid in livres toumois. And their officers and commanders were often invited into a new knighthood, the Order of S aint Michael. When the French dauphin was ready to flee Catholic France and allow the victory of newly Protestant England, it w as Joan of Arc who intervened. A vanguard of Scottish soldiers helped Joan's armies reverse the tide in one spectacular victory after another. The Scots Guard, a neo-Templar organization, would become the King's G uard and the King's Bodyguard, and play important roles in both military and state affairs for almost another two hundred years. The Hundred Years War was a particularly difficult time in Europe, and England may have never seen a century of such l awlessness. On land petty thefts were innumerable; on the seas pir acy reigned. Bribery secured judges and juries alike, and the ever-prese nt tax collectors' palms could be greased. Greed was the most signific ant force, and even poets like Chaucer, who once denounced greed, now p racticed it. 8 The effect of the avarice was widespread poverty an d economic disruption. In England the fourteenth century ended with a massive rebellion that would go down in history as Wat Tyle r's Revolt. Wat Tyler was actually Walter the Tyler, a Masonic name derived from the French word tailleur, meaning \"one who cut s.\" Each lodge of Freemasons had an appointed tyler, and unlike the t ailor who cuts clothes, the tyler was designated to guard the door with a sword.

And the Templars were not the only order to engage in piracy, although they were the only order to use the skull and crossbones as their battle flag. RIVAL ORDERS AS PIRATES The main rivals of the former Templars, the Knights of Malta and the Teutonic Knights, also turned to piracy to finance their orders. In the period just after the Battle of Bannockburn, when S cottish and English pirates ravaged the wool trade, the Hanseatic Leagu e turned to the Teutonic Knights to protect its shipping. The envoy s of Henry VI of England who were sent to meet with the order's gran d master to dis- cuss a truce were actually captured by Hanseatic pi rates. England then turned to the Knights of Rhodes, later the Knights of Malta, as they were known to provide assistance with negotiations. Oddly, two orders that had faced a common enemy during the Crusades w ere now ene- mies with each other. The Knights of Rhodes had been organized by merchan ts from Amalfi.The order was created before the Knights Tem plar with the goal of providing medical assistance to the crusading kn ights and the pil- grims in the Holy Lands. The Knights of Rhodes firs t dedicated its order to Saint John and was called the Order of the Hospital of Saint John, or the Hospitallers. After the fall of Jerusa lem, they went to Cyprus. In 1306 the master of the order, Foulques d eVillaret, who had been the knights' first admiral, joined forces with a Genoese adventurer. With their combined fleet they captured the island of Rhodes. The tiny island that had served as a nest for Greek, Italian , and Saracen pirates became the order's privateer base. But the order ha d little to do now that Jerusalem was lost. It protected Christian shi pping and attacked Muslim shipping. 10 The Knights of Rhodes developed a distinctive style of warfare at sea, using grappling hooks and powerful soldiers to lock together ships"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"44 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life and immediately board them, pirate-style. Little be tter than pirates, they launched an attack on Cairo. The first stop was in Alexandria, where twenty thousand men, women, and children were kille d before the con- quest erupted into an orgy of pillage and rape. 11 Many of the military contingents refused to go any farther because they enjoyed the spoils of war and \"some Brethren turned pirate.\" 12 From Rhodes the Hospitallers continued to harass Mu slim shippers until three successive sieges by the Turks dislodge d the knights. They then moved from port to port operating as pirates—e ven to the point of allowing the \"brethren\" to share in the booty. I n the sixteenth cen- tury the Hospitallers resumed their naval operation s from Malta. They harassed Islamic shippers. They were at war, so in their eyes the piracy was just privateering. The Knights of Malta was very close to the various nation-states of Italy, and was often allied with other states to ca rry out raids. Members became known as corso, a word that later was Anglic ized to corsair, or pirate. Their sea caravans enriched the order throu gh spoglio (prize money) obtained in the sale of the goods they captu red, including slaves, and through ransoming captives. Both the underground Knights Templar and the legiti mate Knights of Malta continued their piracy on the high seas an d even in the Americas. It is surprising that the role of these r eligious military orders in the French settlements of the Americas largely r emains secret. THE KNIGHTS IN AMERICA The Knights of Malta, which is active today, was in fluential in the set- tlement of Canada, in early colonization of the New World, and even in the American Revolution. In 1632 a knight of Mal ta, Commander Isaac de Razilly, organized the expedition to Acadi a and Quebec.

Other French-Canadian knights wo uld also play significant roles in the early history of Canada. The counterpart of the Knights of Malta in France w as the Order of Saint-Sulpice. Founded by the Abbe Jacques Olier , the order invited wealthy patrons to form another group, the Society of Notre Dame, which would in turn become the founding Seigneurs o f Montreal in Canada. Serving the same role as the Cistercians in relation to the Knights Templar, the Order of Saint-Sulpice at time s played a very powerful behind-the-scenes role in international af fairs. Unhampered by the vow of poverty, the order grew in wealth and power. Many of Montreal's streets, named for luminaries of the Sul picians, remind citi- zens of the order's key position. In the 1660s, whe n the overlords of Montreal, the so-called One Hundred Associates, pro ved themselves to be absentee landlords inclined to tax the city, the Sulpicians had them expelled and took over the governance of Montreal. To their credit, their wealth has been committed to good works, and the order remains as wealthy today as it was three centuries ago. In France the order also remains wealthy, powerful, and able to play a polit ical role from back- stage. The Knights of Malta also colonized the Caribbean, including Tortuga, Saint Croix, and Saint Barthelemy—islands that later passed into the ownership of the French West India Company . Another knight, Admiral Francois-Joseph-Paul de Gra sse, delivered the coup de grace to the British at Yorktown. His f leet arrived from the Caribbean just in time to trap Cornwallis and the B ritish army, who were in full retreat. The British, waiting for rein forcements and supplies that would never arrive, surrendered to George Wash ington and ended the war. The admiral was a Knight of Malta, and he learned his sea- manship skills under the tutelage of the order. Of the French ships that battled the British, several were commanded by memb ers of the Knights of Malta, including Admiral de Grasse's che f d'escadron at Chesapeake Bay, Jean-Louis-Charles de Coriolis d'Es pinousse. After the war fourteen of the twenty elite Knights of Malta who fought for the American cause became members of the Society of the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"46 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life Cincinnati, a closed group formed by George Washing ton for his offi- cers. 13 Despite criticism that the order was a version of European aris- tocracy, membership was limited to a handful and fu ture membership required that an individual be a descendant of a me mber of the found- ing group. The French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic Wars saw the Knights of Malta defeated in battle. Napoleon s eized the home base of Malta in 1789 because the French knights had pro vided Louis XVI, his rival, with funding. The Russian czar Paul I of fered the knights refuge and asked them to create a new order that wo uld answer to him. Napoleon immediately ended the order's income from its French prop- erty and evicted the knights, forcing them into a b rief sojourn in Russia. In 1834 the order moved again to Rome and c ame under papal protection. The pope restored the office of grand m aster in 1879. The order slowly rebuilt itself in the twentieth ce ntury. The Knights of Malta order survived and grew to the point that it became a very powerful, albeit secretive, force in modern world p olitics. In 1921 it had two hundred knights and 1,800 members of all grades . 14 Today the group is headquartered at Palazzo Malta on the via Condotti in Rome, and it has a worldwide network of nine thousand kni ghts and thousands more lower-grade members. 15 It is the most elite of the Catholic orders, and although it remains behind the scenes, it has great power. While the Knights of Malta does not own any propert y outside Rome, the order is recognized as a sovereign state, compl ete with its own pass- ports and stamps. The European press often regards the order as an ol d boys' club for aristocrats, but it is actually active on several c ontinents in both chari- table works and political action. In the United Sta tes, a branch of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM) was starte d in 1927, under the leadership of New York's Cardinal Spellman. Sin ce its founding, the group has included the likes of Joseph Kennedy, Jos eph Grace of W R. Grace, and presidents of companies such as General Motors and U.S. Steel. The SMOM has an influence in politics and ha s taken activist roles from its earliest days, starting with opposit ion to the New Deal of"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Brothers to Pirates and Corsairs 47 Roosevelt. In post-World War II politics the group has always leaned to the right, sometimes to the extreme. In supporting the right wing the SMOM has not shied away even from assisting Nazi wa r criminals. After World War II the order granted its highest ho nor to German army general Reinhard Gehlen, which might sound shocking but is nonethe- less in line with supporting a monarchist agenda. A lthough the Sovereign Military Order of Malta does nothing to h ide its existence or membership and does little to disguise its right-wi ng political agenda, it receives almost no recognition in post-Crusades history texts. The rival order of the Knights Templar, however, is a much more secretive entity. Because it is forced to stay unde rground, the order goes to great lengths to conceal its existence and membe rship and to disguise its activities. Nevertheless, it has survived. The Americas presented great opportunity to the rem nant Templar factions. For many of the rank and file, the new la nds represented a place to survive the religious wars and start a new life. Jacobin Catholics from Scotland, Huguenots and Catholics from France, and various dis- senters from England found peace and brotherhood in the Americas. And the wealthy who had found power in the changing feudal hierar- chy of the old order also found new types of power in the Americas.

The wealthy would pay as much as ten pounds sterling to sit ringside and eat and drink d uring the execution. This event, which might be the ancestor of the mode rn tailgate party, was so popular it became known as the Tyburn Fair, and the rulers made a very unpopular decision in finally ending such sp ectacles in the mid- nineteenth century.

But the political tide had turned. Piracy against the Musli m trading partners of the East India Company caused trouble for many who had been share- holders. While Kidd plied the seas for booty, a pow er play in London put the interests of the East India Company above those of other would-be adventurers. Pressure was applied to those who inte rfered. Kidd was the scapegoat. The ties he relied on to protect him ins tead cut him loose. To his surprise, Kidd was separated from those who com missioned him. Now a convicted pirate, Kidd was at the dock in Wap ping. Those who came for a show were not disappointed. Ki dd arrived drunk and unrepentant. His last words were a speech against the liars who testified against him. He was carried to the ha ngman's noose and dropped. The rope broke. Dazed by the fall but stil l alive, Kidd was quickly carried up the ladder again by his executio ner. This time the fall killed him. The legend of Captain Kidd has grown out of proport ion with its real- ity. Kidd was no swashbuckler; he was a businessman pursuing wealth in the fashion of the day. New York City in the 1690s could be equated with th e Wild West. The governor, Benjamin Fletcher, was appointed to o ffice by the mili- tary. He arrived in New York in August 1692. As bef itting a fat, greedy, minor tyrant, Fletcher attained his wealth by being corrupt. He con- trolled the exchange of real estate, and real estat e was the first source of wealth in the colony. In a short period of time cit izens understood that to favor the governor with a bribe earned them his favor. Fletcher allied himself with Stephen van Cortlandt, William Nicoll, and Frederick Philipse by giving them large pieces of land. Fletcher soon turned his attention to another oppor tunity. In 1696 England passed the first of a series of ill-conceiv ed laws limiting the colonies' ability to engage in commerce. Defying su ch laws built some of America's greatest fortunes and started a tradit ion of giving the wealthy the right to be above the law. Smuggling qu ickly became an"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Under a Black Flag 51 accepted way to earning a living. With the European countries at war and all shipping in danger of encountering an enemy , smuggling was scarcely more dangerous than honest shipping. Pirates and smugglers were always at risk when land ing in a foreign port. Their cargoes were subject to seizure and the pirates and smug- glers were subject to arrest. Governor Fletcher pro vided a safe haven for all who were willing to pay his personal tax. This bribery greased the wheel of commerce, and New Yorkers were able to get imported goods from anywhere in the world. Local shops in the smal l port city offered goods from exotic places around the world. Items su ch as teak furni- ture, Oriental carpets, and Madeira wine could be f ound beside the simple homespun goods of colonial New York. Currenc ies of European and Asian countries were exchanged by the English, Dutch, French, Jewish, Irish, and Scottish settlers in the city, w hich was already a melt- ing pot. Elsewhere the British, French, and Dutch m en-of-war preyed on the smuggler and legitimate shipper alike; in Ne w York City, all who paid Fletcher's fees were safe. Fletcher, who \"undertook to mine all the known vein s of guberna- torial graft, and to stake claims on some new ones, \" 3 backed all forms of crime at sea. Fletcher found a way to profit from a ll aspects of pirate com- merce. The pirate captains dined at his table while their crews swaggered around town spending their ill-gotten money. The pi rate Edward Taylor is on record as having paid Fletcher £1,700 to be a llowed to land in New York City and sell his wares. (In modern purchasing power, £1,700 would be about $250,000.) The privateer who applied to Fletcher for a commission to attack enemy shipping would then atta ck anything he could defeat. Such a commission could be procured f or five hundred pounds; the pirate John Hoar is on record as having bought one of these commissions. The merchants who supplied New York's shops with exotic goods bought from pirates and often had a stake in their voyages as well. An example of Fletcher's liberal interpretation of his powers is in his relationship with Thomas Tew. The legendary pir ate was from an English Quaker family that had settled in Rhode Isl and. His history has not been recorded before his arrival in Bermuda, a smuggling capital,"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"52 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life in 1692. According to sources, Tew was already enri ched by piracy. There he bought a share of a ship called the Amity with gold he car- ried in his pockets. Other shareholders were Thomas Hall, Richard Gilbert, John Dickinson, and William Outerbridge, w ho was a member of the governor's council. Tew received a privateer ing commission from Governor Ritchier and headed for French West Africa to attack slave ships. On the way, Tew \"turned pirate,\" with the ba cking of his crew. They headed for the Red Sea and attacked Arab shipp ers before settling in the kingdom of pirates, Madagascar. After severa l adventures, Tew returned home. He sold his Indian textiles in New Y ork City and then headed to Newport, sent for his partners, and divid ed the spoils—some of which was buried near Newport and the rest in Bo ston. Tew's Bermuda backers reportedly received fourteen times their investment. 4 Tew's share amounted to eight thousand pounds, eno ugh to provide a high-style retirement. For a while Tew took part in the good life in Rhode Island, untainted by the same cr imes that would see Kidd hanged. But the governor of Massachusetts deni ed Tew another privateering commission, so he applied to the gover nor of Rhode Island and for five hundred pounds received his pap ers. The first order of business was sailing to New York to meet with the Philipse family. Frederick Philipse was the sev enteenth-century equivalent of a venture capitalist. He provided the equipment needed for a pirate voyage, and in turn was entitled to a share of the gains. His only risk was monetary and he hedged his bets by ma king numerous investments. Those who came to him risked life and liberty. With Frederick Philipse's backing, Tew outfitted his sec ond pirate expedition, one that would immensely benefit his patron. Tew's second adventure found him capturing ships of the Great Moghul and keeping one hundred unmarried girls as w ell as treasure. After a sojourn in Madagascar, Tew and his crew hea ded home again for the quiet life. This time his treasure was said to be more than a hundred thousand pounds. Philipse, who risked only money, i n comparison to the pirates who risked their lives, would earn more than a hundred thousand pounds backing numerous voyages."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Under a Black Flag 53 Tew's weakness was that he could not retire. He sou ght another pri- vateering commission, this time from the new govern or of Rhode Island, John Easton, who refused. Tew then applied to Governor Fletcher of New York. Fletcher knew that Tew was a well-known sea rover, but felt justified in commissioning him to s ail against the French. When later defending his actions, Fletcher claimed he did not know of Tew's reputation, but that the \"stranger\" had plann ed to attack the French at the mouth of the Canada River. Such commi ssions against the French were nothing unusual. But Tew saw the si tuation differently. Tew outfitted his ship and then sailed between New York and Boston recruiting fellow pirates and adventurers fo r his fleet. Fletcher claimed the commission was for attacking the French in Canada, but Tew openly acknowledged there was more money to be gained in the Indian Ocean and that this area was his destination . Thomas Tew made his final voyage to the Indian Ocea n, where he reportedly had some early success against Indian tr ading ships. But he may have pushed his luck. He was never again seen i n New England. On occasion, Fletcher had to make a token charge ag ainst a pirate or smuggler to confuse his enemies. In 1694 he seiz ed a ship that had returned from a Caribbean voyage. The ship was owne d in part by one of New York's wealthiest men, Robert Livingston. Li vingston not only beat the charges, but also sought a way to get rid of Fletcher at the same time. It would take four years and the efforts of t wo partners. It was into this early version of the \"world trade center\" that Captain Kidd sailed. THE WORLD OF CAPTAIN KIDD Born in Greenock, Scotland, in 1645, William Kidd c limbed up the career ranks as a seaman and finally a captain. Sco tland was pirate cen- tral after the Templar fleet had sought shelter the re centuries before, and the country, along with Ireland, would be regarded as a pirate haven for another two centuries. Before the so-called Golden Age of Piracy, pirates were more likely to be found capturing ship s loaded with wool or fish—but certainly not capturing the S panish treasure fleet,"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"54 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life plundering the ports of the Golden Main, or chasing the fleet of the Moghul of India. But piracy, like smuggling, was a living. As Templar soldiers and their descendants remained in the military service as mercenaries, Templar sailors and their d escendants spawned a culture of both legal privateering and illegal pira cy. In the seventeenth century, many Scottish seamen were commissioned to battle Dutch attackers who preyed on English and Scottish shippi ng and fishing. Later, after one more attempt to attain independenc e, Scottish Jacobites swelled the ranks of the pirates in Europe and the Caribbean. It is little wonder that the best pirate literature was also spa wned in Scotland; Robert Louis Stevenson wrote the classic Treasure I sland and fellow Scot J. M. Barrie wrote Peter Pan. Participation in piracy and smuggling was a frequen t occurrence in Scotland, despite laws that called for the highest penalties against these offenses. The laws were only sporadically enforced and convictions were nearly impossible to achieve. An underground societ y prevailed; it was not necessarily hereditary, but it was so prevalent that it was not threat- ened by a justice system. From the days of the Temp lar demise until the eighteenth century, the lodges of men dedicated to a specific craft or occupation enforced their own codes and often exerc ised power that reached to the highest levels of government. These guilds of lawyers, sea captains, craftsmen, and soldiers were individual c ells, or lodges in Masonic parlance, that operated independently yet a ssisted one another in ways that those outside the brotherhood would ne ver suspect. Freemasonry was not yet public. Before 1717 it was truly a secret society in which it was a violation of oath to admi t membership or dis- cuss anything that went on in a Masonic meeting. A major event took place less than twenty years later, when four of En gland's lodges met at the Apple Tree Tavern in Covent Garden in London to form the Grand Lodge. Shortly afterward the Irish, French, and Sco ttish lodges emerged as public societies. There is no satisfactory reaso n why Masonry came out of the closet, but the most plausible explanati on is that the distrust those in power had for the secret organizations enc ouraged the orders to reveal themselves. Scotland's Masons hid a vast underground of"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Under a Black Flag 55 smugglers, pirates, and revolutionaries. Rather tha n risk being accused of plotting against the king of England, the Englis h lodges welcomed royalty and toasted the health of their kings and q ueens. Scottish Masonry was the preserve of such people as Andrew R amsay, the tutor of Bonnie Prince Charlie. Ramsay publicly spoke of the former Crusaders setting up Masonic lodges upon returning from the wars. The lodges survived the persecution of the Templars by remaining underground. And the Bonnie Prince led a revolt by the Scottish against their English overlords. The Scottish version of the Masons had strong polit ical overtones, while the English version, which had distanced itse lf from politics, did not present such a threat. Because of this threat, the Scottish secret organization needed to remain underground. Kidd was a Scotsman and was partnered with fellow S cotsman Livingston, and both men became Masons as well. Aft er a few short years, Livingston was very public with his membersh ip in the guild. His family is still known as active proponents of the M asons. Kidd, of course, did not have even a few short years. The massive immigration of Scots to America and Can ada was resented by the earlier colonists. This Scottish \"i nvasion\" of America was a direct result of constant war with England, and i t increased dramati- cally after the failure of the Jacobite Rebellion. A prejudice against Scots existed from Massachusetts to Virginia, although th ese immigrants still had a significant role in the formation of the new country. In 1776 a play produced in Philadelphia was dedicated to \"Lor d Kidnaper . . . Pirates and Buccaneers, and the innumerable clans o f Macs and Donalds upon Donalds in America.\" 5 The dedication was in jest but the senti- ment was real, and the Scots-as-pirates stereotype was not helped by the prominence of Captain Kidd in pirate lore. In August 1689 Kidd had been on the island of Nevis in command of a sixteen-gun privateer he had taken from the Fr ench. Two years later, in another English expedition, his men—mostl y former pirates—"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"56 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life had left him ashore, and he lost command of a ship. Later that year he received another command to take on the French. By the time Kidd arrived in New York, his reputatio n had preceded him. He helped build the first Trinity Church and b ought a lot on Wall Street. William Kidd, man-about-town, then married a well-to-do Dutch widow, Sarah Bradley Cox Oort. 6 It was his wife's third mar- riage; in fact, the marriage license was received j ust days after John Oort, her second husband, died. Sarah Oort brought a nice dowry to the new marriage, including a house on Wall Street and another on Pearl Street. Kidd must have felt that he was a wor thy catch, and titled himself \"Gentleman\" on their application. Oort and Kidd lived in the fashionable part of town, their home complete with furniture and car- pets that were imported from Asia. Kidd could have remained simply a gentleman, but he didn't. As luck would have it, the acts of piracy committed around the emerging British empire were bringing complaints to the ears of King William III. Especially irritating to the court was the role that Governor Fletcher was playing in North America. King William met with his Privy Council and Richard Coote, the Earl of Bellom ont.They decided that Lord Bellomont would be sent to New York to re place Fletcher as governor and stamp out the pirate haven he had crea ted. Piracy was a worldwide problem for empire-building Britain. In Asia the same countries that England was trying to trade with were com- plaining about American pirates attacking their shi pping, and they held the British responsible. All the legitimate trade w as carried on through a royal-sponsored monopoly called the British East In dia Company. At the end of the seventeenth century, the British East India Company was trying to further establish itself in A sia. The company had been doing well and had the favor of James II until his death. With a royal monopoly, the average dividend was 25 percent in the last ten years of the century. But this monopoly inspired je alousy. Other European traders, American merchants, and even pira tes were hin- drances to business. In the new market the British East India Company was trying to develop, it also did not help that th e company had little"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Under a Black Flag 57 the customer wanted. It introduced cheap opium, and tried to hold its own against invaders and pirates. Ironically, in this newly declared war against pira cy Kidd was enlisted to fight for the cause of the British. Whi le visiting England with New York's most respected merchant, Robert Livingst on, Kidd was introduced to Lord Bellomont, who desired the job o f New York's gov- ernor. Livingston, Kidd, and Bellomont plotted to g et rid of Fletcher. For his part in the deal, Kidd was commissioned to fight against the pirates. Pirates sailing out of New York, commissioned by Fl etcher, fre- quently attacked the Moghuls' ships. John Hoar actu ally attacked the British East India fleet and captured and burned tw o company ships. Tew's attacks on the Indian fleet caused rioting in the streets. The account of Henry Every's pirate crew kidnapping and raping Indian women, some of whom committed suicide rather than s ubmit, caused the offices of the East India Company in Surat to b e attacked by mobs. Several key employees were imprisoned, where they r eceived harsh treatment during the six months of negotiation betw een the Moghuls and the British East India Company. Several did not survive. Whatever the real intentions of Kidd, Livingston, a nd Bellomont, the plan was first to capture the pirate Tew. Kidd, Bellomont, and Livingston would be entitled to whatever goods were taken in the process. THE BIRTH OF AN AMERICAN DYNASTY Robert Livingston built a dynasty as fast as he cou ld and in any way he could. He was a Scot who had lived in Rotterdam for a time and learned the Dutch language. He sailed to America in 1674. At that time the Dutch still controlled New York, and the larges t patroonship was owned by Nicholas Van Rensselaer, who had joined an other very wealthy Dutch family through an arranged marriage t o Alida Schuyler. Van Rensselaer was the son and namesake of the man who had actually received the grants of land and built the family we alth. Like many sons"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"58 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life of ambitious men, Van Rensselaer had no interest in the business or his upstate lands; instead he fancied himself a mystic. He hired Livingston, an obvious go-getter, to run his empire. A trader by profession, Livingston caught on quickl y and acquired the ability to speak the Iroquois language—an abili ty many traders didn't have. He also helped build the Van Rensselaer fortu ne. In 1678 Nicholas was only in his early forties, but he began aging rapidly. He took to his sickbed with an illness tha t could not be diag- nosed. One day he decided the end was near and call ed for a servant to bring a pen and paper for his will. Instead Livings ton appeared. \"No, no, send him away; he's going to marry my widow,\" cried Van Rensselaer, just before he died. 7 If ever a will was composed, it was never found. But some have suggested that \"if you believe a Van Rensselaer rumor, still circulated to this day, Nicholas was poisoned .\" 8 Nicholas the mystic had been right: Within eight mo nths Alida and Robert Livingston were married. Livingston acquired his boss's widow and became the wealthy man he had designed to becom e. When he met Kidd, Livingston was the wealthiest man in New York . As a Scot, Livingston was embroiled in the religious wars that raged back home and that spilled over into the colonies. His relati ves in Scotland, the Earls of Callendar and Linlithgow, had fought on th e wrong side of what became the Glorious Revolution. It was a preca rious time because of the religious upheaval, and many Scots a nd French Huguenots were forced to leave the country. The hos tilities did not end once the immigrants reached America. In New York the war was between Jacob Leisler and t he Catholics. 9 In his frantic effort to keep the pope from control ling New York, Leisler seized the city. When Britain later sent a new gove rnor, Leisler attempted to defend New York against him. His rabid anti-Catholic sentiment ended with his trial and that of five con federates. The same evidence admitted in trial freed four and sentenced two to hanging. Jacob Leisler was hanged on the land where the Manh attan side of the Brooklyn Bridge would be built. A bit of jury tampering may have helped the four wh o were acquit-"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Under a Black Flag 59 ted. One of these possible beneficiaries was Peters e Delanoy. His family subsequently dropped the last letter of their name and become the Delanos.A later alliance through marriage would res ult in the Delano- Roosevelt family. With Leisler out of the way, the power vacuum allow ed Huguenot families such as the Delanoys and their allies amon g the Dutch power base, including Livingston, to prosper. Livingston was now in prime position to expand his empire. He traded with whome ver he could and owned outright or owned shares in several merchant ships. One of these returned 500 percent in one 1694 voyage alone. But success had its downside: Through a customs agent of the mayor of N ew York City, Livingston was charged with the crime of trading wi th the French. It is possible that the charge was correct, as not all le gitimate voyages yielded such high returns. But the mayor simply wanted a sh are in the profits. The case was brought before the grand jury, whose c hairman was William Kidd. It is not known if this case also inv olved jury tampering, but Livingston was spared. Jury chairman Kidd refus ed to indict. Kidd and his new friend Livingston went to England to increase their fortunes. The deal that was struck with Richa rd Coote, Lord Bellomont, involved several other figures who moved in commercial and government circles. The list included John Some rs, the Lord Chancellor; Edward Russell, the Earl of Orford, who was the First Lord of the Admiralty; Henry Sidney, the Earl of Romney; Charles Talbot, the Duke of Shrewsbury; Edward Harrison, a director of the East India Company; and Richard Blackham, who would later be i mprisoned for bribery and currency manipulation. King William III was destined to claim 10 percent of the return in exchange for his blessing of Kidd's pirate-hunting enterprise. 10 Livingston and Kidd were the core partners of the a greement, and together they were required to put up six thousand pounds to purchase and refit a ship named Adventure Galley. This was a pproximately one fifth of the funds needed for the voyage, and in tu rn the partners would receive one fifth of the prizes captured and get to keep the ship. The men who signed on as crew members were on a no-purc hase, no-pay"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"60 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life contract. This type of contract was used by whalers and pirate ships, and it stated that if no prizes were obtained, no pay w ould be given. Therefore, the inducement to capture something was great. Kidd and crew were commissioned to capture pirate s hips. Their papers specifically targeted Thomas Tew of Rhode Is land and two New York-based pirates, Thomas Wake and William Maze. F or good measure the commission added any and all pirates, freeboote rs, and sea rovers. Commission in hand, Kidd sailed out of London to Ne w York. Along the way he captured a French fishing ship—not much of a catch, but perhaps practice for his new crew. In New York, Kidd recruited more men for his advent ure and finally started his planned voyage on September 5, 1696. The destina- tion was the Indian Ocean, where the large island o f Madagascar was actually a pirate nation. 11 The onetime French station Fort Dauphin had become the home base of the pirate Abraham Samuel, who was called King Samuel. The pirate king welcomed other pirates who presented him with gifts. His kingdom and other pirate strong holds, as well as slave ports run by merchants with no national affil iation, made Madagascar a truly wild locale. LIBERTALIA Saint Mary's was a small island off the coast of Ma dagascar where the pirates formed a democratic nation called Libertali a. It may have been the world's first true democracy, in which each man had an equal vote. It just happened to be a pirate nation. Upon reaching the mature age of about thirty, many of the pirates retired to Libertalia. Land was free, exotic Polyne sian-African women were plentiful, and the locals were not hostile. Pl antations were started and trading posts were established. Even though eac h man might be able to return to his home port with a small fortun e, many chose to live on the island. It is a mystery just why Kidd sailed into Saint Mar y's if by this time he did not intend to \"go pirate.\" As a pirate hunte r, he apparently had"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Under a Black Flag 61 no intention to attack the pirate port; instead he landed, to repair his ship and recruit new men. But once he landed, his s ituation grew worse. A greater enemy than the English would attac k Kidd's crew: dis- ease. On the small island in the Indian Ocean, one fifth of the crew suc- cumbed. Kidd needed to replace even more men than h e originally intended. He took on new members, all of whom were most likely experienced pirates. The major distinction separating the privateer from the pirate was a piece of paper. The commission that gave the priv ateer captain the right to take certain prizes made his actions legal , whereas seizing bounty without such a commission was an offense pun ishable by hang- ing. Commissions would occasionally be honored, and sometimes would expire because of the end of a war. Unfortuna tely, the privateer at sea had little way of knowing that hostilities h ad ended and that a truce voided his commission. Another difference bet ween privateers and pirates was the conditions in which they lived and worked. On a privateer ship the captain was chosen by the owner. He had to be tough and able to make difficult decisions, but he also h ad to be intelligent. The men on both merchant ships and privateer ships received very lit- tle pay, were treated as inferior by the owners and officers, and were subject to physical abuse at the whim of their mast ers. Such abuse was legal, and more men died of being flogged than died in battle. Alexander Falconbridge, a surgeon who served aboard the ships of the Royal African Company, reported that one captain fl ogged a man to death for losing an oar. Another captain forced men to eat live cock- roaches for his entertainment. Falconbridge is quot ed extensively for such cruelties to both seamen and slaves in Hugh Th omas's The Slave Trade and Patrick Pringle's Jolly Roger, the Golden Age of Piracy. The slaves aboard such ships often were of more value to the c aptain than his own crew. The average mortality rate for slaves in the seventeenth century was 25 percent; it was often as high as 40 percent for the crew. The officers of the British navy treated their own crews just as harshly. It was no wonder that when a pirate ship attacked a merchant ship,"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"62 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life the crew was eager to surrender. The pirates treate d them better. Those who came aboard were treated as equals. Many were i nvited to join, some were simply impressed by their lifestyle, but all were treated bet- ter. Four hundred years after the Templar fleet lef t France, the lodge sys- tem spawned in Templar preceptories and Cistercian monasteries was alive aboard the pirate ships. The ship's rules wer e determined by arti- cles that each man signed. The men voted on such ru les in a democratic fashion: one man, one vote. Rules included not taki ng women aboard, as they could cause friction; not discussing religi on, as it too could cause conflict; and spelling out tasks and duties. On a pirate ship the captain was elected by the ent ire crew. Like a privateer captain, he had to be tough and intellige nt. He had to be well liked, too, as his crew could simply unelect him. S hares were deter- mined, and the job of the captain and the quarterma ster was to ensure equal shares to all members of the crew. The crew on both pirate and privateer ships would s ail for a share in the voyage. On the privateer ship the captain's share and that of the high-ranking officers were greater than the crew's. On many pirate ships all bounty was shared in a fairer way. The ca ptain and the quar- termaster might get a double share; a highly profic ient crew member could get a share and a half. An injured pirate who was unable to return to sea might be given a greater share to aid his re tirement. The average sailor on a pirate ship had a better chance of maki ng a windfall profit for the risks and hardships he endured. Some took t heir shares and went back to the farm. Sometimes an agreement was struck so that all sailors remained together until every man had a certain amo unt of money. Life was potentially dangerous for the pirate, but the dangers were not in attacking enemy shipping. Very rarely was a merchant ship will- ing to mount a defense, and few pirate ships were e ver captured outside of ports. One pirate historian reports that brothel casualties were higher than battle casualties. The greatest risk a pirate might endure was expul- sion by his fellow sailors. Marooning, or expelling a pirate from a crew, took place on a desert island or sometimes on a san dbar that would dis- appear at high tide. Pirates were usually marooned only for the worst of"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Under a Black Flag 63 offenses, which included abandoning their posts dur ing battle. The term maroon was coined from what the Spanish called Cima rrons, the group of people created from the marriage of escaped blac k slaves to native Amerindian women. Life at sea was equally dangerous for the criminal pirate and the legitimate privateer, as the common threats—injury, imprisonment, and death—did not favor one type of sailor. For example , a privateer sailing against Spain was a criminal in the eyes of the Spa nish crown, as was a pirate operating anywhere. Both could suffer equall y for their offenses, and death was the most common punishment. The diffe rence was that the pirate stood a better chance of making a profit . As a result, pirate ships often had little problem defeating better-arm ed naval ships, mer- chant ships, and privateer ships. Many times the cr ew of the captured ship was happy to join the pirates—and they were of ten delighted to see a cruel captain subject to his own medicine. CAPTAIN KIDD AND THE PIRATES Kidd knew the risks and the rewards of piracy. What happened aboard the Adventure Galley to induce the captain and crew to \"go pirate\" will probably never be known. But Kidd was low on suppli es, had little to trade, and had a crew that was most likely unhappy with the long months at sea and his harsh leadership and lack of profit. With his lead- ership and judgment in question and his reward syst em poor, it is sur- prising that he was able to recruit veteran pirates . However he did it, he set out from Saint Mary's as a pirate. Twice Kidd brought his ship to within threatening d istance of British-protected shipping, and twice he was turned away. Finally he captured a lone trading ship from Bombay flying the English colors. Upon meeting the ship's captain, Kidd found out tha t he was already considered a pirate. Word traveled quickly. Kidd soon took three more ships, including the valu able Quedah Merchant in January 1698. With his new fleet, he no w broke all the rules and attacked an East India Company ship. He left th e coast of India"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"64 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life with his prizes and headed for Madagascar, where he spent six months before heading back to North America. It is hard to believe that an experienced captain s uch as Kidd would think that he could return to New York and escape p unishment because of his connections, but that appears to have been t he case. The Earl of Bellomont, now the governor of New York, actually c ame to Kidd's defense. The governor said he received reports that Kidd was forced by his men to act as a pirate. But Bellomont was in an awkward position. Having replaced Fletcher, who had given a commissio n to the pirate Thomas Tew, Bellomont had to be careful not to cast himself in the same light. He also was entitled to a large commiss ion should he issue a pardon. Kidd, however, had gone too far. The capture of the Quedah Merchant had caused rioti ng in the streets of Surat, where the British East India Comp any maintained its offices. The company was already blamed for any act s of European piracy, but this time the ship belonged to a member of the Indian emperor's court. This news eventually reached New Y ork—well before Kidd. Bellomont had to distance himself from the situatio n and cut his losses. The governor of what is now New York and Ma ssachusetts had never seen Boston, and he traveled there on May 26, 1699, for the first time. It appeared to his critics that he was on his way to meet his pirate- partner Kidd, who had just reached Delaware Bay and was heading north. Bellomont later explained that he wrote Kidd a letter that pur- posely did not threaten his arrest, as he didn't wa nt to scare Kidd away. Joseph Emmot, a New York lawyer whose specialty was admiralty cases, advised Bellomont that Kidd had treasure abo ard and had left treasure behind in the Caribbean. Emmot also delive red two passes granted by the French that Kidd had taken from the Moorish ships he captured. These documents were evidence that the ac t of capturing those ships, at least, was not piracy. Had these pa sses made it to Kidd's trial, he might have been acquitted. But somehow Be llomont or another backer of the voyage allowed the passes to disappear. 12 While he was conspiring to have Kidd convicted, Bel lomont sent"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Under a Black Flag 65 two men to get a statement from the pirate. They me t with Kidd off Block Island. Afterward Kidd seemed confident he co uld still trust Bellomont. He set sail for a tiny island off the co ast of eastern Long Island called Gardiner's Island. He unloaded three or four small boats of booty and then sent for John Gardiner, in whose car e Kidd placed a chest for Bellomont. Gardiner's area of eastern Long Island was one of t he two favorite pirate places to anchor in summer; the other was ac ross the mouth of Long Island Sound, on the islands between Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard. Both were locales where ships, both pirat e and merchant, could rendezvous to trade and exchange cargo and su pplies. It was an illegal floating market at times. The mouth of Buzz ards Bay was also passed by ships cruising between New York and Bosto n, but docking a ship there would mean drawing the attention of the navy. As Kidd sailed around the eastern end of Long Islan d, he dropped treasure in various places. One stash was delivered to an old pirate by the name of Thomas Paine, who lived on Canonicut Is land off Rhode Island. When the governor of Rhode Island got wind of the story, he searched Paine's house, but the gold was not there. It may have already been moved back to Gardiner's Island, but proof aga inst the Gardiner family was not to be found. Kidd's plan was to hedge his bets. If he hid enough treasure before meeting the authorities, it would be something to u se in striking a bar- gain. As Kidd's real history grew into legend, peop le would tell tales of him dropping his treasure as far north as Nova Scot ia and as far east as the South China Sea. But it's more likely that what he did not leave in the Caribbean he hid around Long Island Sound. Kidd was also attempting to deftly play the cards h e was dealt. He knew after meeting with Emmot that the situation wa s vastly different since he had left New York. The British were cracki ng down on piracy, the ships returning to New York were being seized, and the ships' cap- tains and crews were being hunted and arrested. Kid d had put his part- ners Bellomont and Livingston in a very complicated position. Bellomont, in fact, had much to gain either as Kidd 's friend or as the"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"66 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life arresting officer of the court. Both scenarios allo wed him to be rewarded either financially or in reputation. Not having all the treasure available for confiscat ion was one of the strategies Kidd employed; the temptation to have mo re would serve as an inducement for Kidd's apprehensive partner. Kidd 's second play was delivering to Lord Bellomont's wife an enameled box with four jewels; he hoped it might tip the scale and make Bellomont back his partner. But Bellomont did the math. Allowing that Kidd's ch arges might be false and pardoning him—and thereby keeping his leg itimate share— could equal a thousand pounds. But seizing Kidd and claiming his legit- imate share as arresting governor gave him thirteen thousand pounds. Bellomont's advisers warned him not to go against t he British East India company and the powers the company represente d. Thus Bellomont decided against his onetime partner; Kidd was to be arrested. The other partner, Robert Livingston, was dismayed by Bellomont's decision. He stood to gain all if Kidd was pardoned and nothing if Kidd was arrested. In fact, Livingston h ad posted a bond guaranteeing Kidd's behavior. Bellomont alleged tha t Livingston threat- ened him, saying that Livingston would take reimbur sement from Kidd's treasure if Bellomont didn't return the bond . Did Bellomont make up this accusation to distance himself from th e crime? Or as Bellomont might have feared, were Kidd and Livingst on, brother Scots, involved in a conspiracy against him? Both Bellomont and Livingston had to bear the weigh t of public opinion. In America the arrest was an exciting even t; in England it was a political event as well. The Tory party, closely tied to the British East India Company, wanted Kidd convicted. The Whigs, se veral of whom were backers of Kidd's voyage, were in a corner. In the end, all but Kidd got their way. At the trial the book listing the ow ners of Kidd's ship, his partners, and his instructions was missing. So were the vital passes obtained from the Moorish ships, which might have a cquitted him. (The passes were discovered two hundred years later in a London records office.) The letter from Bellomont to Kidd was also missing. There were only two eyewitnesses against Kidd: Robe rt Bradinham"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Under a Black Flag 67 and Joseph Palmer. Both were military deserters who turned pirate. Today an American lawyer might point out that such criminals may not be credible witnesses, as they are not men of reput ation, and they were very obviously testifying against Kidd for their ow n reprieve. Their par- dons came days after Kidd's conviction. It appears that a deal had been struck, one that co nvenienced all except William Kidd. Kidd was the scapegoat and, as such, was hanged. Livingston was cleared of all charges. Bellomont wa s enriched for his role in arresting Kidd. The other Whig partners wer e unsullied by what might have been a scandal, although they lost their stake in the ship and any proceeds they might have expected. For England and the ruling class, the bottom line was that Tory shipping was s afe from Whig upstarts. Livingston made out better than he thought. He rece ived his bond back, although remarkably he was forced to pay off fellow partner Robert Blackham for his stake in the venture. The m embers of Captain Kidd's crew were mostly pardoned, and some died in jail. Kidd's wife, Sarah Bradley Cox Oort Kidd, was jailed and her hou se seized on Bellomont's order. Oort was known to have some of K idd's loot, but it was never found. She was eventually released and ma rried a fourth time. Those who had received the treasure were targeted b y Bellomont, who stood to gain a share of the recovered valuable s. The greatest amount of treasure was on Gardiner's part of Long I sland. Threatened with an enemy landing on his tiny kingdom, John Gar diner presented Bellomont with bags of gold and silver. Thus, Kidd was killed, and all those associated with him prospered."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 SKELETONS IN THE CLOSET he lifeless body of Captain William Kidd would join the bodies of other captured and convicted pirates left to greet those who sailed into London's port. The hanging criminals served as a warning for prospective sea rovers that crime did not pay. The real message, however, was that crime did pay, and it rewarded those who c ould pay others to do their bidding. The feudal system that gave birth to the Knights Te mplar gave rise to noble ideals such as liberty, equality, and frat ernity. Among those in power, however, corruption ruled. Freemasonry devel oped from the noble ideals of the Knights Templar, and the lodge system was created— underground—to protect its members. Some lodges bec ame more cel- ebrated than others, and membership in the more pre stigious lodges offered greater rewards. While Livingston would sur vive into days of public Freemasonry, Bellomont would not. Almost twe nty years passed after Kidd's body hung over the Thames before Freem asonry went pub- lic. From London to Boston, New York, and Philadelp hia, the lodge sys- tem separated those who pulled the strings from tho se who were left hanging.

It is hard no t to suspect the Gardiners of running a sort of pirate bank on their tiny kingdom. They owned Gardiner's Island itself and larger tracts of land stretching from East Hampton to Smithtown on Long Island. The progenitor of the family was an Englishman, Lio n Gardiner, who was born in 1599. He came to America in 1635 as a soldier, a builder of fortifications, a trader, and a fighter against the Indians. Gardiner's son David was the first white child born in what would become the state of Connecticut. In what is now kno wn as the Pequot War, Gardiner was instrumental in enlisting opposin g tribes to join a small English force that sought to exterminate the Pequots. Gardiner's principal ally was Wyandanch, a sachem from Long Is land. Gardiner agreed to trade with Wyandanch's group if he would \"kill all the Pequots\" that came to him and \"send . . . their hea ds.\" 1 From his new friends the Montaukett tribe, Gardiner bought the s elf-named Gardiner's Island, a 3,500-acre island kingdom (par t of modern-day East Hampton), for cloth, a gun, some gunpowder, an d a dog. He added to his Long Island holdings by rescuing Wyandanch's daughter from an enemy tribe; for this feat he was given the land th at would become Smithtown, bringing his holdings to a hundred thous and acres. Rights to Gardiner's kingdom were confirmed by King Charles I. In the seventeenth century and later, Gardiner's ea stern holdings pro- vided a great haven for pirates and smugglers, and evidence appears to indicate that the early Gardiner heirs were more th an simply willing accomplices. In 1672 a report indicated that a Massachusetts pir ate named Joseph Bradish set sail for Gardiner's Island with his loo t. In 1692 the governor of Connecticut reported that pirates were anchored off East Hampton and engaging in trade. In another report, a promine nt Connecticut cit- izen was accused of receiving stolen property and s elling it in Boston, and it was noted that the shore of eastern Long Isl and was the haunt of"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"70 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life pirates and smugglers. Still another report stated that a pirate ship called the Sparrow had taken on eighteen passengers under an agreement made in the Caribbean. The master, Richard Narramor e, then carried the passengers to Gardiner's Island, where they dis embarked, chests and all. As the story spread, the unnamed men, who were suspected to be pirates, were brought before a magistrate. Christop her Goffe was one of the few accused men who appeared. He confessed that , as suspected, he was a pirate, but he was able to obtain a pardon. 2 The Gardiner family has maintained its wealth throu ghout the cen- turies by the right connections to England prior to the War of Independence and by more secret connections that la sted to the mid- dle of the nineteenth century. While many Whig fami lies were able to avoid losing their lands after the American Revolut ion, the Gardiners, like their neighbors and often partners who had bee n Tories, walked a thin line and were not subject to the postwar land grab. Many of these families showed their reluctance to break from moth er England, and some of their actions bordered on treason. The War of 1812 became a second war of independence , as Britain had never ceased treating America as a colony. Her navy regularly impressed American seamen. Her army armed and incit ed native bor- der tribes against her lost colony. Many families h ad prospered through their relationships with British firms, and such pr o-British Whig fami- lies found themselves at odds with President Jeffer son. A handful of New England merchant families, who had survived the Revolution and even prospered, proposed that New England leave the Union. Their loyalty was not to their country but to their merca ntile interests, which were often shared with British counterparts. In the decades before the Civil War, America was ag ain threatened with secession, this time from several southern sta tes. One great secret of American history is that the same New England merch ant families who had tried to leave the Union earlier were joined by New York merchant families in aiding the breakup of the Union. Despit e this treasonous activ- ity, few of the powerful families were held account able. The Gardiner family was one such family that straddled the two s ides of the Civil War."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Skeletons in the Closet 71 The Gardiner family, while always flying under the radar of public comment, was a power base in New York and part of t he Cotton Whigs. The Whig party was divided on many issues, and the so-called Cotton Whigs allied themselves with the powerful families of Virginia and the Carolinas who by the nature of their business, cott on, remained close to English banks and merchants. When Gardiner interest s merged with the interests of the planting families of Virginia and South Carolina, the Gardiner family itself merged with the Tyler family of Virginia. While American politics has evolved over the centur ies, in the nineteenth century it was not unusual for a preside nt to be at odds with his vice president. As the result of compromise wit hin the Whig party, William Henry Harrison and John Tyler ended up on t he same ticket. Harrison was regarded as a politician in the mold o f loyal Virginia lead- ers such as Washington, Jefferson, and Madison, and so was against the divisive politics of South Carolina, which was firs t to threaten leaving the Union. Tyler was part of the secessionist movem ent in Virginia that was based at the College ofWilliam and Mary. Althou gh he was a mem- ber of the Whig party, he had no inclination to sup port Whig policy. He agreed with admitting Texas as a slave state, and h e was against aboli- tion. Harrison and Tyler still managed to take the White House, using the slogan \"Tippecanoe and Tyler too\"; this motto r eferred to one of Harrison's triumphs over the Indians. Harrison assumed the presidency on March 4, 1841, a nd one month later he died. His death was attributed first to intestinal illness and later to pneumonia, though no autopsy was perfo rmed. Described as robust, the war hero and sturdy farmer was someh ow brought down by a head cold. After his long inaugural speech, wh ich was given in the rain, the apparently healthy president became ill; many believe that his cold turned into pneumonia. InVictorian times it was not uncommon for doctors t o misdiagnose arsenic poisoning as \"gastric poisoning,\" as the sy mptoms of arsenic poisoning usually started with gastrointestinal dis orders including abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. But both of the president's physicians were suspected of pro-British sentiment. Dr. Frederick May"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"72 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life was trained by the Freemason Dr. John Warren. May's son was an out- spoken Tory and close friends with Benedict Arnold. The other physi- cian, Dr. William Eustis, was also trained by Warre n. He had been fired by President Madison because of his actions in the War of 1812. Dr. Eustis helped plan the defense of Detroit with Gene ral William Hull. On the way to Detroit, Hull was ambushed. His suppl ies gone and morale low, he surrendered Detroit as soon as he re ached it. Madison believed the British had been tipped off. When the War Department conceived a plan to attack England's supply base in Nova Scotia, Eustis would not allow it to happen. With Harrison dead, t he pro-secessionist Tyler was elevated to the presidency in 1841; John Tyler was the first president of the United States to get to his post w ithout election. 3 Harrison was the first president to die in office. His suspicious death started what was later called the \"Twenty-year Curs e\" or the \"Zero Curse,\" which postulated that every president elect ed in a year ending with a zero would die in office. The \"curse\" lasted 160 years before it was broken by Ronald Reagan. Reagan, however, barel y missed being assassinated by the mentally disturbed son of a fri end of the vice presi- dent. Some said the curse was put on Harrison by Te cumseh, the Indian warrior whom the president had defeated. But it is more likely that the death was engineered. Caleb Cushing, whose political leanings were influe nced by profit potential, was no stranger to political manipulatio n and subtle bribery. He was a thirty-third-degree Mason, the highest lev el to which a Mason could rise, and an opium smuggler. His fortun es were tied to the pro-British mercantile smugglers, slave traders, an d drug traffickers. Cushing wanted to hold a government office. Tyler claimed he was not a party man and had accept ed his nomi- nation reluctantly. But after Harrison's death, Tyl er immediately repudi- ated most of the Whig platform that had brought Har rison to the White House. As a result, the new president was not popul ar; in fact, he was derided as \"his accidency.\" Tyler's first order of business was pushing for Cal eb Cushing to become Secretary of the Treasury. The Senate reject ed his nomination"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Skeletons in the Closet 73 three times, with the third ballot securing only th ree votes for Cushing. Tyler then proposed sending Cushing to China. This move was greeted heartily, possibly because it was the farthest plac e from the seat of gov- ernment that the devious politico could be sent. Harrison's death was the first of three during Tyle r's stay in Washington. The second death was that of Tyler's wi fe, Laetitia. Tyler did not spend too much time grieving; instead he op ted to unite his Virginia plantation family with a northern merchant family. Julia Gardiner, the spoiled daughter of the wealthy and p rominent David Gardiner, was Tyler's target. After returning from a grand tour of Europe, Julia Gardiner became part of the Washington social whirl, dating several congressmen, includ- ing the future president James Buchanan, two Suprem e Court Justices, and a naval officer. She met President Tyler at a W hite House party, and he invited her to return. Although she was thirty y ears younger than the president, their first date ended with him chasing her around the White House. He wasted no time in proposing to Gardiner, but her mother stood in the way of the marriage. She was concerned that the president was not a good enough catch for a Gardiner. The Vir ginia farmer and plantation owner simply had no money when compared with the Gardiner fortune. 4 Tyler was not one to give up. The deaths of \"Old Ti ppecanoe\" and Tyler's wife had paved the way down his new path, a nd a third death would allow Tyler to get what he wanted. The stage was set aboard the USS Princeton, where the navy wanted to display a new cannon, which was dubbed th e Peacemaker because of its size.

Gilmer, and Julia's father, Senator David Gardiner. 5 The fifty-four-year-old president and the twenty-fo ur-year-old Julia Gardiner became secretly engaged shortly afte r her father's death. They later married privately. The huge difference i n age presented more fodder for public opinion and the media, but Julia Gardiner Tyler won the hearts of the public even as her husband was th e butt of their jokes. 6 During Gardiner's \"reign\" as First Lady, as she cal led it, she revived the formality of White House receptions, which had gone out of style. She welcomed guests with plumes in her hair and sur rounded by twelve maids of honor dressed in white. She also in stituted the playing of \"Hail to the Chief.\" Gardiner bore several child ren with the presi- dent: David Gardiner Tyler, John Alexander Tyler, J ulia Gardiner Tyler, Lachlan Tyler, Lyon Gardiner Tyler, Robert Tyler, a nd Pearl Tyler. As president, Tyler's major accomplishment was repa ying the favors of his chief promoter, Caleb Cushing, among the Cot ton Whigs. He managed to make Cushing an ambassador of sorts, sen ding him to China to reap the rewards of the British Opium War. The signing of a treaty with China kept the American opium traders i n business—a trade that benefited a handful of New England and N ew York families. Tyler was booted out of his own Whig party and had all but one member of his cabinet resign. The remaining cabinet member was Daniel Webster, who was deeply in debt to Caleb Cus hing and at his beck and call. Tyler was even impeached for not sig ning a tariff bill, although the impeachment was eventually defeated. H is lack of favor in Washington went so deep that he didn't attend the s ucceeding presi- dent's inauguration. Tyler left American politics t o join the Confederate government, making Tyler the first American preside nt to bear arms against the federal government. After his death in 1862, Julia returned to New York and worked to promote the Confederate c ause. The Gardiners survived prosecution for assisting pi rates, had sur- vived pro-British sympathies after the Revolution, and survived pro- rebel sentiment during the Civil War.

The Gardiner estate is now in the hands of eighty-eight-year-old Robert David Lion Gardiner, w ho divides his time between estates in Palm Beach and East Hampton . With the exception of having to comply with taxation, he is the lord of his manor, just as a lord from another century. He regu larly invites guests to take part in a hunt to reduce the island's deer population. For the first time in the Gardiner family history t here is no direct heir. Robert Gardiner's niece, Alexandra Creel, mar ried into another of America's first families, the Goelets, and will inh erit the island. The Goelets have been in America since 1676, and they b uilt their fortune in real estate, along with the Philipse and Rooseve lt families. One of the Goelets founded Chemical Bank with a grandfather of Theodore Roosevelt. The Goelets and the Gardiners have been rivals for years, and the last lord of the Gardiner manor has recently be en quoted as saying he is not happy to see his ancestral lands end up i n Goelets province. The bitter Gardiner-Goelet feud was covered extensi vely in Steven Gains's Philistines at the Hedgerow, and some very colorful anti-Goelet quotes are on peconic.net, the local newspaper cove ring the long- standing feud. While both families maintain a high degree of secre cy, Robert Gardiner recently opened up his life and his strugg le to the prying eyes of the media.

THE LIVINGSTON DYNASTY Robert Livingston, another of Captain Kidd's partne rs, was for the most part unscathed by Kidd's arrest. The Livingston fam ily would go on to play a major role in the politics of New York and t he nation, and its sup- port base was Freemasonry, which allowed members to also operate from behind the scenes. Several early scandals conn ected them to piracy, theft, and smuggling, but their power, whic h was always just below the surface, allowed them to grow and prosper to modern times."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"76 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life Just as Robert Livingston was breathing a sigh of r elief that Kidd was in the noose, Livingston's daughter Margaret ma rried a Scotsman, her cousin Samuel Vetch. The new son-in-law brought more notoriety to the family, which apparently was not a concern f or the Livingston clan as long as the notoriety was matched by enterp rise. The Vetch fam- ily and the Livingston family had already been conn ected by marriage in Scotland. Reverend John Livingston brought Samue l Vetch's father into the Presbyterian Church. William Livingston, t he older brother of Robert, had also married a Vetch. Samuel Vetch was despised by many in Scotland, and it is unlikely that the Livingston s and anyone else in Scotland were unaware of his criminal activities. 7 In Scotland a project had been created to found a n ew colony in America. The Scotland Company Trading to Africa and the Indies was formed in June 1695 with the goal of bringing to Sc otland what the British East India Company brought to England. The subscription books, which allowed anyone with money to buy stock in the com- pany, were rapidly filled with the names of merchan ts, shipowners, and wealthy individuals from physicians to widows. The plan was to buy ships and bring Scottish settlers to their own colo ny, which would be in Darien, on the coast of Panama. Little attention was given to the fact that the land was claimed by Spain, and the company was not really in the favor of England. The project was plagued with disaster after disaste r. Ships packed with soldiers and colonists were provisioned poorly and would see forty dead before reaching the New World. When the coloni sts reached Panama they were nearly starving, as their worm-rid den food could barely be tolerated. More were sick than healthy, a nd few had the abil- ity, the desire, or the knowledge to build a settle ment. One ship hit a rock in harbor, sank, and took with it half its cre w. Crew members on other ships attempted mutiny and many simply desert ed. By the end of the first rainy season, there were no plantations p lanted, no fortifications erected, no trade established, and a government of five quarreling men. 8 There were, however, two hundred graves in New Edin burgh. After ten months the colonists were ready to give u p their settle-"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Skeletons in the Closet 77 ment. Over one third had died. Two ships left the c olony to sail to New York City in order to sell goods and buy provisions . Samuel Vetch was on one of the ships. In the East River he tried to seize another ship, an act of piracy that he would explain was his right b y charter. Two friends of Robert Livingston came to Vetch's aid. Stephen D elancey and Thomas Wenham were Livingston associates who had bu ilt fortunes financing the pirates of Madagascar. Livingston had to maintain a low profile, however, as he was already under suspicion from his partnership with Kidd. Vetch, like his cousin Robert Livingston, was not l ikely to pass up a lucrative opportunity. He decided to keep the shi pload of goods that was meant to buy provisions for the starving coloni sts in Darien. Livingston helped him sell the stolen goods. Of course, Vetch could not return to Darien or to S cotland; the news of the fiasco would cause riots in Edinburgh. Hardly a family below the Highland line would not have the loss of a family member or friend to haunt them as a result of the ill-conc eived expedition. A second voyage saw three hundred of 1,300 dead bef ore reaching the devastated colony. Few made it back to Scotland . Because Vetch would likely be hanged on the sands of Leith along with several other criminals related to Darien, he decided to stay in New York. He mar- ried Livingston's daughter, and the magnanimous Liv ingston gave the young couple as a wedding present a house that was once the property of Captain Kidd. Samuel Vetch and John Livingston went into the smug gling business together. They bought a ship and named it Mary, the n sailed to Canada to import French brandies and wines. On their secon d trip they were smuggling cargo onto eastern Long Island, not far f rom Gardiner's island kingdom, when they encountered problems. This early version of the gang that couldn't shoot straight\" left their ship beached without anchoring it and then took off, presumably to find assistance. The ship was swept away by the tide to Montauk, where it was sei zed—complete with cargo, logs, and all the evidence required to bring charges against the pair. No one was hanged; all were let off simply with the loss of a ship"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"78 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life and its cargo. The incident did, however, bring unw anted attention to Robert Livingston, who was still hoping the Kidd af fair would blow over. Livingston called in his markers, and Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury, who took over for Governor Bellomont, had the charges against the younger Livingston and Vetch dropped. H e also repealed the Bill of Confiscation, enabling Livingston and Vetch to keep their cargo. Not coincidentally, Cornbury's six-year rule was hi ghlighted by accu- sations of bribery, mismanagement, and even attendi ng parties dressed in women's clothing. 9 Samuel Vetch learned from his cousin and soon becom e a wealthy merchant. Unlike his new in-laws, however, his luck did not last. Fortune caught up with him and he died in debtor's prison in London. Robert Livingston would do much better. Livingston's life took an odd turn when he traveled to London to plead the case of the Iroquois tribes in New York. On the way his ship was accosted by French privateers, who had no idea they held at their mercy the backer of the world's most infamous pirat e. Their advantage was short-lived, as the sudden appearance of a Brit ish man-of-war turned the tables. The immense amount of land held by the Livingston f amily was of little value if it could not provide an income. In 1710 the opportunity to change the idle lands to profitable lands came w ith a new governor. While Robert Hunter was reputed to be honest, he ma y not have been too smart. He had been warned on both sides of the Atlantic about dealing with Robert Livingston. It mattered little to Hunter, whose task was to provide a place to settle German refugees. A fter the first winter, the starving palatines were in open rebellion again st their landlord. The English government refused them permission to leave , and Robert Livingston admonished his wife, Alida, for wishing to give them bread. A second freezing winter found the settlers fleeing across the Hudson in the hope of escaping their feudal lord. The eighteenth century was marked by wars between t he British and the French and ultimately between the colonists and the British. For the Livingstons the century was marked by upris ings by their ten-"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Skeletons in the Closet 79 ant families. They used the French and Indian Wars to increase their wealth after being appointed to the lucrative posit ion of provisioning the British troops. When the American Revolution ca me, the family straddled the fence for as long as possible. Then s ome members went home to Scotland and others fortuitously gambled on the side of the Revolutionaries. One of the great-grandsons of Robert Livingston was Robert R. Livingston. He played a pivotal role in politics an d in the Freemasons, of which he was the grand master for the New York b ranch. On April 30, 1789, he swore in the country's first president , George Washington. Livingston had hoped for an appointment to Washingt on's new gov- ernment but none was forthcoming; it was possible W ashington recog- nized the Livingston clan as playing both sides. Se veral Livingstons had left New York for the West Indies. Alida Livingston Gardiner, who was married to Valentine Gardiner, had left for England . 10 Robert R. Livingston kept his own power base behind the scene s. The Livingstons' power grew by dynastic marriages, as one Livingston married John Jay, another married an Astor, and another wed a Rooseve lt. But Masonic ties were at least as important. New York State's most influential and powerful lodg e was the Holland No. 8. Jacob Astor was aware of the power w ielded by the Masonic lodges in both his home in Germany and in L ondon. When he reached New York City, he used his marriage to a member of the Brevoort family to gain entrance to the Holland No. 8 Lodge. There he made connections with New York's governor, George C linton, his nephew and later mayor of New York City, De Witt Cl inton, land baron Stephen Van Rensselaer, and the Livingston family. 11 De Witt Clinton, in particular, was an ardent Mason, and among the o ffices he held were lodge grand master, high priest of the Grand Chapte r, a grand master of the Great Encampment of New York, and grand master of the Knights Templar of the United States. Clinton's power base, however, would remain the Holland No. 8 Lodge."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"80 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life When Robert Livingston was grand master of the Holl and No. 8 Lodge he founded ten other lodges; still the Hollan d lodge remained the most powerful. The old guard of New York was fi rmly in control as the Masonic order and the Holland lodge grew in pow er. Many would advance their careers through Masonic connections, including Charles King, former president of Columbia University; Cadw allader Colden, grandson of the provincial governor; and John Pinta rd, the secretary of the Mutual Insurance Company. Masonry rewarded the Livingston family well, and the family did not turn away from the craft even dur- ing its unpopular years. Today the Livingston Mason ic Library is main- tained on West Twenty-third Street in New York City . New York was a power center for the Livingston clan , but its influ- ence was not limited to that state. Robert R. Livin gston was disap- pointed because he did not receive an appointment i n Washington's administration, but during Thomas Jefferson's admin istration he did join James Monroe on a mission to France. They went to n egotiate the pur- chase of New Orleans, and they were reportedly surp rised when Talleyrand, Napoleon's minister, asked, \"What will you give for the whole?\"—meaning the 825,000 square miles offered fo r sale. 12 Without permission and without the time to contact Washingt on, the two men offered fifteen million dollars. Livingston later a ssumed full credit for the purchase, altering his journal entries to say h e was given the offer three days earlier, before Monroe reached France. T he government issued a vigorous denial and published Livingston's real itinerary, and the disgrace cost him whatever credit might have be en due. The area that was open thanks to the Louisiana Purc hase was an early equivalent of the Wild West. New Orleans was the gateway. Very close to the city was a pirate kingdom second only to the one in Madagascar a hundred years before. The new Libertal ia was called Barataria, and Jean Lafitte controlled the territor y like a king. From India to the Caribbean, Lafitte's career stood out among pirates. Since his navy was so large it could not sail into any po rt, his kingdom, with protective estuaries, became his home base. At Bara taria the pirate cre- ated a marketplace where pirates, smugglers, and le gitimate traders"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Skeletons in the Closet 81 could buy and sell silks, wines, spices, furniture, and slaves, all of which had been taken at sea.

He rode in wi th a military escort to assume his office. The city turned out fo r the occasion: two thousand Americans, French, Spaniards, Italians, bl acks from Haiti and Jamaica, Orientals in silks, Hindus in saris—and th e brothers Lafitte. 13 In a short time the newly appointed governor of the area was goaded into offering a bounty for Lafitte and his b rother, Pierre. Lafitte posted his own bounty for Governor Claiborne. When Pierre Lafitte was captured, District Attorney John R. Grymes quit his job. Instead of prosecuting Lafitte he would became the pirate's de fense co-counsel. Robert Livingston's brother Edward, an active Mason and the mayor of New York City, left New York to join the defense te am. The two defenders were allegedly offered twenty thousand do llars. Edward Livingston had several reasons for leaving N ew York, all of which had something to do with money, specifically his lack of it. Livingston's land speculations and other ventures h ad left him in debt. His position as mayor was not as lucrative for him as it was for past mayors. New Orleans would be the start of a new lif e. He quickly mar- ried a nineteen-year-old French widow, Louise D'Ave zac de Castera Moreau de Lassy, whose family was the owner of plan tations in Haiti and had been driven out by the slave insurrection. As grand master of New York's grand lodge, Robert Livingston had influ ence that spread far beyond the state borders. Edward Livingston bec ame grand master of the Louisiana lodge upon arrival. Jean Lafitte was no ordinary pirate. Said to be a F rench nobleman whose parents lost their lives under the blade of t he guillotine during the Reign of Terror, 14 the swashbuckler was also an educated man who could speak four languages. Called \"the gentleman p irate,\" Lafitte was described as tall, black-haired, and sporting a bla ck mustache. He left France aboard a privateer ship that he would later take from its captain, and he began indiscriminately to raid ships of all nations. Lafitte started"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"82 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life in the Seychelles, where he bought a boatload of sl aves for trade. On the way to sell them in India he was chased by a Br itish frigate. In des- perate need of supplies, he captured other British ships, including one of the East India Company's. The privateer soon had a fleet. Lafitte's reputation grew to gigantic proportions a fter he used one of his ships and forty of his men to battle a very large, forty-gun British ship manned by four hundred sailors. Lafitte's fort y men, with daggers in mouths and bandanna-clad heads, boarded the ship in a frenzy. Lafitte commandeered a cannon and aimed at the men who rema ined on deck, threatening them with certain death. They all surrendered. From the Indian Ocean, Lafitte and his navy sailed to the Spanish port of Cartegena, where he was given a commission. The city had just rebelled and authorized him to attack Spanish shipp ing. At one point Lafitte's navy had fifty ships and one thousand pir ate sailors. From there he built his kingdom in Barataria. Derived from the Spanish word barato, the name refers to the part of the winnings a gambler gives to the poor for luck. Lafitte's pirate city had a cafe , a bordello, a gambling house, and warehouses. He would widen waterways to facilitate ships, dig canals, and even build barges that would sail t o the port of New Orleans to sell their merchandise. Lafitte survived the prosecutions of the governor a nd went on to join the Americans in the Battle of New Orleans in 1812. Besides hav- ing the legal protection of lawyer and Mason Edward Livingston, another noted Mason would come to the pirate's aid. Andrew Jackson rewarded Lafitte's crew with citizenship, and Lafit te tried to settle down. When his crew could not give up their old way s, Lafitte sailed to Mexico and was not heard from again. The Livingstons, of course, would be heard from aga in. Today the Livingston dynasty is remembered in the names of lo cations in New York, New Jersey, and Louisiana. And the family is still active in poli- tics. During the Clinton administration, for instan ce, Robert L.

Other members of the Livingston clan stil l own vast tracts of land in New York. Modern-day relations of the Li vingstons include the Bush family and Thomas Kean, the former governo r of New Jersey, who makes his home in Livingston township, New Jers ey. THE MORRIS FAMILY The Livingstons were not the only landed family to have made their start in piracy. The progenitor of the Morris famil y also made his for- tune capturing ships and used the proceeds to obtai n vast tracts of land. Locale names still exist on the maps of New York an d New Jersey that recall the extent of the Morrises' property. Lewis Morris was a pirate who had a king's commissi on that allowed him to prey on shipping in the colonies and split his prizes with the crown. His nephew, also named Lewis Morris, was involved in the triangle trade. Between running sugar plantations i n Barbados and using the labor of imported slaves to create end products like rum, Morris's lucrative trade gave him an estate back in the colo nies. The younger Morris would later be a signer of the Constitution. 15 The younger Lewis Morris was also part of an unusua l rivalry that developed into an important American historical lan dmark. In the early 1730s Morris served as the chief justice of the thr ee-man Supreme Court in New York. A fellow wealthy merchant named Rip van Dam had become governor and then retired his post. The new governor, Colonel William Cosby, was as corrupt as they come. He demanded that van Dam return his salary as governor and give it to Cosby. The case made it to Morris's court, where he cast the o ne vote in three denying Cosby his claim. Cosby, in control of the state publication, the New York Gazette, relentlessly went after both van Dam and Morris. Fr iends of the pair backed a rival newspaper and hired John Peter Zenge r as editor to retal- iate in print. Cosby didn't like playing the role o f editorial victim and threw Zenger in jail. After a lengthy and much publ icized trial, Zenger's acquittal started the process that later developed into the freedom of the"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"84 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life press. Coincidentally, one of the other two men on the Morris court was merchant and financier Frederick Philipse. THE PHILIPSE DYNASTY The Philipse family was one of New York's landed ar istocracy. Frederick Philipse was also a pioneer in another way; he buil t the family fortune supplying pirates with goods and money. He had alre ady been in the business before Fletcher assumed the governor's pos ition, but under Fletcher's rule New York grew as a pirate haven and Philipse profited. And many knew about Philipse's business. A Salem mi nister named Reverend John Higginson once wrote in a letter to h is son, \"Frederick Philipse of New York, it is reported, has a pirate trade to Madagascar for near twenty years.\" 16 Philipse was well acquainted with Kidd and hired Sa muel Burgess, who had sailed with Kidd as a privateer. Burgess wa s recruited out of retirement to sail to Madagascar with goods for the pirates. Clothing, liquor, naval supplies, and ammunition were the imp orts of choice on Saint Mary's. These goods were in turn exchanged fo r slaves, one of Madagascar's only exports. Another employee of Philipse was the pirate Adam Ba ldridge, who was for a while one of the pirate kings of Saint Ma ry's. While his title did not entitle Baldridge to rule in a monarchal wa y, it did make him the number one fence for items stolen by pirates—a very lucrative posi- tion. Baldridge bought goods at attractive prices a nd put them aboard ships to Frederick Philipse. He would also serve as a travel agent, assist- ing retiring pirates in making their return passage to England or the North American colonies. With the pirate king Baldridge on Saint Mary's and Burgess sailing back and forth to New York, the aristocratic Philip se had his own trad- ing empire. The pirate Thomas Tew was also in his e mploy, and Philipse did little to hide his role in piracy. One of his s hips that sailed the Indian Ocean for slaves and contraband and to engage in pi racy was named the Frederick. 17 "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Skeletons in the Closet 85 But life would not always stay simple for Philipse. After Kidd's arrest, Bellomont was on the prowl for pirates, and he was not above turning on acquaintances like Philipse. When Bellom ont became aware that two hundred pirates were being given passage t o New York from Madagascar on a Frederick Philipse—owned ship, 18 he decided money was thicker than friendship. The fee charged to eac h ex-pirate was an expensive fifty pounds, but presumably that was the tip of the iceberg of their personal wealth; the men were most likely loaded with booty intended to provide for them in their retirement ye ars. Luckily for both Philipse and his cargo, Bellomont would not survive long enough to intercept it. Next Philipse's number one captain, Burgess, was ca ptured at sea. It was the second time for Burgess, who had previously survived arrest being pardoned by Bellomont. But that was before th e backlash against piracy started by the British East India Company an d the arrest of Kidd. This time Burgess was brought to London, where he w as condemned to death. To his credit, Philipse sent to London hi s son Adolph, who worked for three years to save Burgess from sufferi ng the same fate as Kidd. Burgess returned to sea, and later lived out his retirement years in London as a consultant for the British East India C ompany. Unlike the Livingstons and the Gardiners, the Phili pse family's power and wealth was divided after the Revolution. They had started in the colonies as part of the landed aristocracy of t he Hudson Valley, which entitled them to the patroon system that gran ted lands to favorites of the royalty back in England: Pelham Ma nor for Thomas Pell, Philipsborough to the Philipses, Morrisania t o Lewis Morris, Cortlandt Manor to the Van Cortlandts.The families in control of these extremely large tracts leased farmland to tenant fa rmers, who were often kept in poverty and indebted to their land. In 1766 the Philipse tenant William Prendergast sta rted mob actions along the Hudson that would affect both the Livingston clan and the other patroon families' holdings. At his tr ial Prendergast said that he was charged more for his small farm than we re all the other Philipse tenants. It didn't matter. He was found gu ilty of treason and"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"86 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life ordered hanged, drawn, and quartered in the feudal fashion of the lords of the Hudson manors. When no one would come forwar d to perform the execution, Prendergast received a stay and fina lly a pardon from King George III. King George disappointed the Philipse family a seco nd time by los- ing the War of Independence. The Philipses were par t of a New York contingent that declared their loyalty to the king and signed the Declaration of Dependence. Frederick Philipse III w as arrested by Washington's troops and so he fled his home. Washin gton confiscated the lands. The Morris family somehow ended up with one third of the original grant. Tenant farmers were allowed to buy the farms on the other two thirds after the Revolution. Some of the Philipse heirs fared better than Freder ick. Like the Livingstons, some fled to England after the war, wh ile others managed to avoid being branded as Tories and stayed in the colonies. Also like the Livingstons, at least one Philipse heir would marry into the Roosevelt family. Another Philipse heir, Jacobus Goelet, star ted his own landed dynasty that eventually united with the Gardiner fa mily's. Jacobus Goelet had been raised by Frederick Philips e, the lord of the manor. Peter Goelet, the grandson of Jacobus, e stablished himself in business and in politics during the Revolution. Ins tead of being arrested or deported, Peter Goelet used his close relationsh ip with those in power to remain in New York and prosper. Goelet's r elationship with the city controller, Benjamin Romaine, allowed the Goelet clan to acquire real estate as favorably as had the Astors and other large-scale investors like the Rhinelanders, Schermerhorns, and Lorillards. Romaine was a failed schoolteacher who found his tr ue calling as an early member of the Tammany Society, which was f ounded as a fra- ternal charity for Revolutionary War veterans in 17 89 shortly after Washington was inaugurated. Washington's Society of the Cincinnati was for officers only and later for those with aris tocratic family lines. The Tammany Society was meant to be for men of all classes, although it quickly emerged as a corrupt organization that h elped only a hand- ful to loot government coffers. While the history o f New York points"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Skeletons in the Closet 87 the finger at Boss Tweed and others who were the mo st corrupt, the major beneficiaries, such as New York's first famil ies, emerged with larger fortunes, little criticism, and no criminal or civil penalty for their roles. Goelet's two sons married daughters of the Scottish merchant Thomas Buchanan and furthered the family's rise. Th e younger Goelets founded the Chemical Bank of New York at a time whe n there was an antibanking sentiment in New York. It was nearly im possible to get a charter for a bank, so several companies got a char ter for a certain type of business and then later amended the original cha rter. New York Chemical Manufacturing Company was a small company formed to produce dyes, paints, and drugs. One year after get ting a charter for this business it became a bank. Chemical Bank counted se veral generations of Goelets on the board of directors. The next Goelet generation would collect fortunes t opping the $100 million mark when their lands, including Union Square and Fifth Avenue, appreciated. Families like the Goelets, Ast ors, and Rhinelanders became \"Old New York,\" as they owned so much proper ty. And their fortune grew with the population of the city. When Newport, Rhode Island, began to attract the li kes of the Astors and the Vanderbilts, the Goelets too built t heir own mansion. Goelet daughters married well, including the marria ge of Hannah Goelet to Thomas Russell Gerry. Goelet-Gerry descen dants made ties to the Livingstons, Harrimans, and Gallatins, as we ll as to British roy- alty. Robert Goelet's yacht rivaled the yachts of t he Astors, the Vanderbilts, and the J. P. Morgans. In 1870 J. Pierpont Morgan founded his own elite so ciety, which he called the Zodiac Club. Membership, like that in the private clubs to which Morgan's father belonged, was limited to twel ve Anglo-Christian white men. Pierpont, J. P. Morgan's father, had cla imed the family tree included the pirate Morgan, and to drive home the p oint he called his yacht the Corsair and flew the Jolly Roger. One hun dred years after the Zodiac Club was founded, Robert Goelet shared one o f the coveted chairs with eleven of the mid-Atlantic's most power ful businessmen. 19 "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"88 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life Despite the dilution caused by marriages, the wealt h of the secre- tive Goelet clan is far-reaching. They have been in volved with Guaranty Trust, Equitable Trust, the Illinois Central Railro ad, and the Union Pacific Railroad and institutions like the Metropol itan Opera and the Museum of Natural History in New York. Through the Goelet Corporation the family has interests in mining, oil , and gas. The Knickerbocker Club once represented the highest level of wealth in the city of New York. Because New York is a financial capi- tal of the world, entrance to this club is no longe r simply for pillars of New York society such as the Goelets and the Astors . In 1965 the ranks of the Knickerbocker included the Aga Khan, Giovann i Agnelli, C. Douglas Dillon, the du Ponts, the Goulds, the Hutto ns, the Ingersolls, the Rockefellers, Alfred Sloan, and William Vanderb ilt. 20 PIRATES TO PATRICIANS When the Knights Templar were disbanded in the four teenth century, they had at their core a handful of wealthy and nob le families that had always acted from behind the scenes. Although the i lliterate Jacques de Molay was burned at the stake, the elite core remai ned alive and well. The majority of the rank-and-file Templars also sur vived—not in their estates in France but in hiding. They were protecte d by the heirs of the Norman families in France that held power in Scotla nd. And they were protected by their sworn loyalty to one another. On land some ex- Templars found work as mercenaries and others in th e building trades. They established a system of secret passwords and h andshakes and a lodge network that protected them from disclosure a nd from being unemployed in a feudal world. They were sworn to fe ed and shelter each other until work could be found. As there had been a handful of core families behind the Templars, there would be a handful of core families behind th e ex-Templars. The best known is the Sinclair family of Scotland. The network of lodges created in the aftermath of the Templar downfall em erged as Freemasonry and the Sinclair family was named its hereditary"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Skeletons in the Closet 89 guardians. Former Templars were employed on land by the Sinclair family as construction workers and on the sea as sa ilors on the massive Sinclair fleet. The same men who sailed under the s kull-and-crossbones flag as Templars continued to ply the seas. The Reformation played a harmful role in dividing t he Catholic Stuarts of Scotland, England, and other elite famil ies who had backed the Templars in France. After a century of displace ment and massive warfare, Europe experienced a breakdown in morality . America was populated alternately by whatever religious group w as out of favor in Europe. The French Protestants known as Huguenots, the Catholic and Protestant Scots, and Englishmen would meet in Amer ica and in some cases continue the wars started at home. Masonry, h owever, would serve to breach the religious divide. Masonic lodges provided a refuge for many and were places where the ideas of tolerance and brotherhood prevailed am id an intolerant world. For many the lodge system offered the possib ility of breaking out of the caste system. The pirate community went a step further: Democracy in its pure form, brotherhood, mutual pro tection, and equality existed among the pirates in a way that wa s rarely seen else- where. The Kingdom of Libertalia might have served as a model soci- ety if it had not been colored by pirate fiction an d tainted by its prosperity being linked to stolen goods. In Liberta lia all men had a vote, wealth was held individually, and all provided for the community. The old and infirm were provided for by all. Crime agai nst fellow pirates was rare; not only was each man armed and dangerous , but also each had signed articles that did not allow for such act ivity. The presence of any man who caused disruption in the community was not tolerated in law or in practice. At the same time both the Masonic lodge and the pir ate life were gripped by the same evils that pervade the human co ndition. Pride and greed guaranteed that some were at a higher level t han others. While equality might exist within an individual lodge, th e lodges soon sepa- rated, with the sea captains and shipowners belongi ng to one and the dockworkers and ship's crews belonging to another."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"90 Piracy: A Merry and a Short Life As in the earliest days of the Knights Templar, som e core families were able to use and discard the rank and file at w ill. The pirates who sailed under the same flag as the Templars needed t o rely on the elite few who could walk in both worlds. Like the Sinclai rs in the Old World, the Livingstons, Gardiners, and Philipses in the New World could operate and profit through their connection t o the underworld. At the same time they could retreat to their manor houses while the Kidds and the de Molays bore the blame. Although the seed of a democratic society had forme d aboard the pirate ships and among the Templar fighting units, the remnants of a feudal society remained. Ex-Templars and elite fami lies continued their symbiotic relationship in America in the years to c ome. Family wealth would be built through secret societies. Profits wo uld be made from smuggling, the slave trade, and even the opium-traf ficking business, where the fleets of the China traders would still s ail under the skull and crossbones. As in the fourteenth century, the risks were often borne by the many, while the gains were enjoyed only by the few who could exist in both worlds."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"PART TWO The Lodge and the Revolution FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AFTER the Templar order was outlawed by the papal authority, it was s till alive in the form of numerous entities. Despite bei ng fractured by the religious squabbles of Europe, the order still retained many of its goals, which included su rvival, resistance to the overbearing religious powers of t he day, and a conspiratorial brotherhood of self-protection . By the early eighteenth century there were several ins titu- tions that could claim direct descent from the orig inal Knights Templar. Among these groups were military orders that could exist in the open and secret soci eties that survived underground. The secret society of un der- ground Masonry in Scotland was the most authentic remnant Templar group, and it would later call itse lf the Ancient Lodge."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"92 The Lodge and the Revolution The underground lodge system had been the refuge of the ex- Templars; for decades it helped many survive and ev ade arrest. Through the centuries, however, the lodge system became mor e open, and it gave birth to the more public Freemasonry. The world and the Masonic lodges would then become divided as a result of religion, politics, and econom- ics. No longer would every Mason be welcomed in eve ry lodge. Europe and Masonry would be torn apart by the revol t against the papacy. The conflicts that had started in Europe fo und their way over the Atlantic, as did the solutions. The revolt agai nst the Church led to a revolt against the aristocratic system that kept th e majority in a peasant caste. This economic revolt gave rise to a middle c lass in which anyone could participate provided he could find a means. S ecret societies and law breaking provided the fastest route to economic prosperity. Europe was rife with conspiracies great and small. Men conspired to protect themselves from the horrors of the const ant wars over reli- gion. They conspired to protect their own industry by keeping compe- tition out. They conspired to break a multitude of trade laws that did little to foster trade and much to enrich the kings . And everywhere there was conspiracy, there were places for conspir ators to meet. The lodge system provided that refuge. Not all conspiracy could be considered bad. Joining a secret society in America provided the means to raise one's statio n in life, to find work, to belong to a community, and to transcend th e religious squab- bles of the Europeans. At the same time, it also pr ovided avenues to wealth through breaking the law, and it bred dissen t and stirred the mobs against the weak government. Once the hostilit ies against the crown started, secret societies allowed the colonis ts to create a spy net- work and to strike the enemy in the most unsuspecti ng way. The American Revolution began as a reaction to Brit ain cracking down on smuggling. Those whom the British declared smugglers were considered by the Americans simply to be merchants, although these merchants had something in common. Like pirates, th e smugglers needed connections to survive. This meant belonging to the right lodges. While smuggling was done by individual merc hants, it required"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Lodge and the Revolution 93 a support system that was anything but small. Merch ants buying even basic commodities from any of the numerous European possessions in the New World were almost always breaking the law. A system of trust evolved through a secret society: Masonry. The American Revolution was fought by a network of spies, diplo- mats, smugglers, Freemasons, and slave traders. Alt hough they were rarely united politically, they did share an interest—and the means to accom- plish their interest. Masonic ties allowed conspira tors from England, New England, New York, and the Carolinas to find a comm on ground and make critical moves behind the scenes. One prominen t example is Benjamin Franklin, who moved freely through Masonic circles that stretched from London to Paris and Nantes. Franklin was able to stir dis- sent among the British, bring in supplies from the Netherlands, and ulti- mately bring the French into the war. From Britain, Franklin enlisted members of a hedonistic entity known as the Hellfir e Club, whose orgiastic activities would shock even modern Britai n to muster public support against the war and for the Sons of Liberty . Through a smuggling network that operated in the Caribbean from Bermuda and from Europe, American sea captains supplied the Revoluti onaries with muni- tions. Franklin's Masonic connections in France wer e wealthy slave traders, often Huguenots, who operated through lodg e systems that reached everywhere their ships sailed. Friends were also found among the aristocratic class in France, with Masonry again pa ving the way—even as the royals were ardent Catholics. In a most audacious move, a wealthy French family b ribed the British admiral heading the war effort to deny supp ort to Cornwallis at Yorktown. At the same time the French contingent le d by the Knights of the Sovereign Order of Malta supplied the Americ an side. The American Revolution was won not on the battlefield as much as in the secret meetings of numerous conspirators like Benja min Franklin and his lodge brothers.

Strange? Yes, but less so as one understands the maelstrom of the eighteenth-century world, in which the old ways of religious and aristocratic authorit y were being chal- lenged on a regular basis. The dramatic changes that affected everyone's daily life created a nation while also fostering a new elite. The new el ite, unfortunately, promoted an elitist attitude long after the indepen dence that allowed criminal activity, as long as they were the ultimat e beneficiaries. John Hancock might serve as the best example of a w ell-connected Mason who became a great patriot for the sake of hi s own fortune. With one foot in an elite lodge and the other in a workingman s lodge, he somehow was able to present himself as a champio n of liberty and a prince of industry. Hancock rode in a well-appointe d carriage around Boston clad in the aristocratic purple that was his trademark, yet he would be a hero to the thousands of hardworking doc kworkers who depended on him for employment. One could argue tha t the American Revolution started when a ship belonging to Hancock , the Liberty, was seized. The event and the actions that followed con nected the wealthy Hancock and his lodge to the working class, who bel onged to numer- ous other lodges, and to Sam Adams. John Hancock was born into a wealthy and connected mercantile family. He became one of the wealthiest merchants t hrough inheritance from an uncle. He understood from early on that a m erchant needed connections, and one very important way to develop those connections was through Masonry. Hancock's uncle became a Mason in an aristo- cratic lodge in Canada. By being admitted to a lodg e in one city he could then attend lodge gatherings in other cities. In Boston, Hancock would attend the meetings of a working-class lodge known as Saint Andrew's. Masonry was undergoing a great change. The craft in America and England had seen a dilution of its original values, which had included lib- erty and equality. While liberty was prized by all, equality was not pres- ent in the new class system. What would be called \" modern\" Masonry shared much with the rising mercantile and professi onal classes that"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The Lodge and the Revolution 95 formed the English Whig party in the political aren a and a bourgeois class in the economy. With new Masons accepted by invitat ion and common agreement, individuals in the lower echelons of the changing society—a stonemason, for example—were not always welcome. Th is was a repudi- ation of the Masonic ideals, and the effect was tha t an elite class was allowed to develop and service the careers of its m embers. Politics and religion were still inseparable, and t he Modern Lodge Masons were pro-Parliament and very much Protestant at a time when the world was still fighting a constant series of w ars over the religious leanings and marriages of its kings and queens. On June 24, 1717, representatives from four English lodges met at the Goose and Gridiron alehouse in London and creat ed the Grand Lodge. By going public the Grand Lodge, also known as the Mother Lodge, ended centuries of underground operations. I nstead of being a craft guild where members of the same trades could meet and act to serve one another's interests, no longer was a part icular trade required for membership. Masonry in the Grand Lodge style be came \"specula- tive\" masonry; this modern interpretation eliminate d the titles and tools of a working craft and made them into mystical symb ols. There were four major lodges in England that went public to cr eate the Grand Lodge. They had been meeting for years, so it was n ot much of an event at the time. Within two years the number of lodges increased tenfold, but as many as twenty-six had been already in opera tion. 1 When these lodges met, they toasted the Hanoverian king and sang patriotic songs. Because this was just a short time after the most recent Scottish rebellion, the Modern Masons hoped that go ing public would distance them from the Scottish Masons and help the m avoid suspicion. The establishment of the English Modern Grand Lodge as a public institution served more than one purpose: It allowe d English masons to publicly distance themselves from Jacobite Masons, and it also may have forced the Scottish and Irish lodges to go public. In a very complicated world where the change of the monarchy would often lead to war, these lodges were ostensibly pro-Catholic and pro-m onarchy; in England they were the basis for the Tory party. But at the same time as"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"96 The Lodge and the Revolution these lodges were accused of being reactionary, the y actually held the finer Masonic ideals to be true. Although they often fell on the Catholic side of th e never-ending religious wars, the Grand Lodge had more to do with Templar tradition than adherence to the papal authority. The Grand Lo dge had three degrees: Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Mast er Mason. The Scottish Rite Masonry claimed higher degrees and di rect descent from the Templar organization. In 1603 James VI of Scotland became James I of Engl and. James was a Stuart, and his family was connected to the Guise-L orraine families of France, who had been instrumental in the creation o f the Knights Templar. The old Templar sword and the trowel of th e master builder, which were so important to the roles born hundreds of years before, were now part of the Stuart heraldry. The Stuart ascensi on to the throne attempted to undo the losses of both Scotland and C atholicism. Noble Scottish families played a strong role in England's affairs, and two fami- lies, the Hamiltons and the Montgomeries, moved to Ireland to start the Ulster Plantation. 2 James I was Catholic and a Freemason, and in the e arly seventeenth century his status would politicize Mas onry. James constantly fought with Parliament, which tried to increase its influence in matters such as taxation, foreign policy, and religion. The Stuart rule would not last the century; it ended with the Glorious Revolu tion of 1688. Charles I, the son of James I, ascended the throne in 1625. The Parlia- ment of 1640 to 1641, however, declared that it and not the king had the power to tax. This threat to the king's power might have led to the 1641 rebellion in Ireland against the Protestant rule. W hile Charles I was actu- ally Anglican, his wife and his Stuart family were Catholic. Parliament saw the Irish rebellion as a conspiracy; they felt the king was using the rebel- lion to raise troops to form a counterrevolution ag ainst Protestantism. Parliament attempted to end the king's power to rai se troops, but the king ordered soldiers to arrest certain members of Parli ament.

His Commonwealth did not last the decade, and, remarkably, the son of the beheaded king, Charles II, was put on th e throne. Charles II abolished many of the privileges of the monarchy, b ut when his Catholic brother, James II, took the throne the old religiou s bugaboo reared its head again. James was dumped in the Glorious Revolu tion. Charles and James had a sister, Mary, who had marri ed the Dutch prince of Orange. James also had a daughter named M ary, who was a Protestant and who also strengthened the family bon d with the Dutch by marrying the son of the Prince of Orange, William I II. The Dutch House of Orange was united from earlier times with the Ge rman House of Nassau, a region bordering on the state of Hesse. I t would shed the des- ignation Nassau-Orange and come to be called simply the House of Orange. German families were especially adept at th e art of strategic marriages, and after the hard-won struggle to get t he English throne, the Stuarts would lose it to the House of Orange. A new Bill of Rights was established under William of Orange and Mary, but it did not resemble the later American Bi ll of Rights, as it banned Catholics from the throne. The rule of Willi am and Mary also gave rise to the Tory and Whig factions.

A brotherhood modeled on Masonry was established an d called itself the Order of Orange. It was anti-Catholic, and its legacy lives on today in Belfast, where the no-longer-secret order has on e hundred thousand members. 3 When William died (years after Mary passed away), t he daughter of James II, Anne, took the throne. When Anne died, th e House of Orange relinquished the throne to the rulers of the German state of Hanover. From that point on the Hanoverians provided England with all her monarchs, though they did change the family name mu ch later to the House of Windsor to appear less German. Anne was su cceeded by the grandson of Elizabeth Stuart and Friedrich, Count P alatine."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"98 The Lodge and the Revolution The Stuarts clung to the belief that they could reg ain the throne. For the purpose of putting a Stuart heir back on th e throne, a new branch of Freemasonry was created by Michael Ramsay , a Scottish mys- tic and the tutor of the children of James III. His plan was to resurrect the old ideals. He modeled the new branch after the Knights Templar, and for the first time in three hundred years he wo uld publicly claim what many in Scotland and Ireland had kept secret: that the Masonic organization was the direct heir of the original un derground organiza- tion. One of Ramsay's co-organizers, the Earl of De rwent Water, claimed that the authority to create the Knights Te mplar lodge came from the Kilwinning Lodge, Scotland's oldest lodge. The Kilwinning Lodge was actually formed before the arrest of the Templars. It dates to 1120, and by the seventeenth century it was prac- ticing speculative Masonry, meaning it wasn't simpl y a craft guild. The history of the Kilwinning Lodge is complicated, as it was first inde- pendent, then joined, then separated from, and then joined again the Grand Lodge of Scotland. Following the creation of the new lodge, a series o f pro-Stuart Jacobite uprisings of the early eighteenth century began, which culmi- nated in the horrible defeat at Culloden in 1746. T o the English, Culloden was meant to be the last attempt by Scotla nd. After the bat- tle the survivors were hunted down and killed. Thei r families, too, were prosecuted, and a massive Scottish emigration ensue d—much of it to the Americas. Events in the not-so-United Kingdom affected the Am erican con- tinent in many ways: European wars became American wars, Protestants increased their suspicions of Catholics, and the di splacement of popu- lations and religious intolerance caused waves of m igrations by Puritans, Huguenots, and Scotch and Irish Catholics . These events also forever changed Masonry. Masonry was linked to the Stuarts in Scotland, as the craft had developed and lodges had met since the ancient days of Henry Sinclair's guardian status. I t was not, however, a Jacobite conspiracy, as lodges met in England as we ll among the anti- Jacobite, pro-Whig, pro-Parliament system that was in power."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The Lodge and the Revolution 99 In America the Grand (Modern) Lodge was established early. Though accurate records remain undiscovered, one of the earliest appointments was by the Duke of Norfolk, who in 173 0 granted to Daniel Coxe of New Jersey the grand master title fo r New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. In 1733 Henry Price founded a Grand Lodge in Boston . 4 James Oglethorpe, known in American history as the founde r of the colony of Georgia, established and became master of his co lony's lodge in Savannah. His family included active Jacobites, and his less than enthu- siastic command of English forces led to his court- martial. By 1738 there were established lodges meeting in Bo ston, New York, Philadelphia, Charleston, and Cape Fear, Nort h Carolina. 5 They attracted and admitted the merchants and shipowners while excluding the average worker. This was not the intent of Scot tish Masonry, which stuck to the principles of an egalitarian society. In Boston and Philadelphia new lodges sprang up, se emingly with- out any authority. The most celebrated is the Saint Andrew's Lodge in Boston, which met at the Green Dragon Tavern. It re ceived its warrant from the Scottish Rite Lodge rather than the Grand Lodge, and a fis- sure was created in American Masonry. The ancient l odges attracted a handful of the merchant class but were made up most ly of craftsmen, artisans, carpenters, and shipwrights. The notable exceptions in the Saint Andrew's Lodge were Dr. Joseph Warren, who be came grand mas- ter, and John Hancock. Both men served important ro les in the early conflicts that ignited the war. Masons played roles on both the English and the Ame rican sides of the conflict. In the confusion, a revolution starte d by the Boston Whigs operating out of a lodge chartered by a Scottish lo dge system found as opposition the Catholic Scots that had remained Tor y. As brother fought brother and neighbor fought neighbor, Masons too wo uld fight on either side of the American Revolution.

It might have been f ired by Spain, which was next in line and being wooed by American agents . Or it might have been fired by any number of European countries that wished to see Britain suffer a setback in its conquest of the wor ld. But it wasn't. The shot was fired by the tiny Dutch possession of Saint Eustatius, an island in the Caribbean that was unknown at that time except to sea captains and traders, and is hardly known today des pite the Caribbean's appeal to travelers. The shot was fired in reply to a national gun salute by the American brig Andrew Doria. While few have e ven heard of the tiny island commonly called Statia, it was pivotal in deciding the American Revolutionary War and, as a result, Americ an independence. The Golden Rock, as the island was also called, was the central head- quarters of a massive smuggling operation that had gone on through- out the century and that provided guns and ammuniti ons to the struggling Continental army.

Had Rodney reached Virginia, the combined ragtag war-weary Ame ricans and their new allies may not have succeeded. Rodney decided instead to punish the tiny island of Saint Eustatius. He later justified his action by claiming, \"This ro ck of only six miles in length and three in breadth has done England more h arm than all the arms of her most potent enemies, and alone supporte d the infamous American rebellion.\" Instead of speeding toward Vir ginia, Admiral Rodney took his time in attacking and then looting the island's hun- dreds of merchant ships and stores. The tiny \"free\" port, the home of smugglers of several nationalities, paid the price for aiding the American cause. It wasn't until 163 years later when the pre sident of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, a Dutchman by descent w ho was born into a family that was no stranger to the smuggling busi ness, would honor the Dutch island for firing this first salute. A pl aque honoring Saint Eustatius and its governor, Johannes de Graaff, who had ordered the salute, was presented. It is very possible that Saint Eustatius managed to play two roles: being one of the key supply depots of the war and p roviding Admiral Rodney with a diversion. The actions of the island may have caused Rodney to miss the most important role he might hav e played in the Revolution—as well as the ability to emerge from th e battle with his wealth and prestige intact.

LIBERTY SEIZED In May 1768 the Liberty, a sloop carrying a cargo o f wine imported from Madeira, entered Boston Harbor. The captain to ld the customs agent, Thomas Kirk, that it contained twenty-five c asks of wine, but the agent knew that the ship could carry much more carg o than declared. It was, after all, a ship belonging to John Hancock . The customs agent decided to look for himself. Once aboard the Liberty, Kirk was shoved into a cab in by a gang of men who then nailed the door shut. While the agent was locked on board, the ship was unloaded. When Kirk was release d he was warned by another captain that his life and property were in danger should he ever open his mouth about what happened. He might h ave complied, except that the British warship Romney had also pul led into Boston Harbor. Kirk filed his report, accusing one of the city's most prosperous merchants of smuggling. The captain of the Romney landed troops, seized the Liberty, and towed her out to his own ship. He underestimated th e anger of the Boston mob, however. One thousand men made their li ving because of the ambitious firm run by the Hancock family. They took to the streets armed with clubs. Their first targets were the cust oms agents. Several were beaten by the mob. One, Joseph Harrison, had h is own boat at the wharf, which the mob burned. While the crowd stoned the customs house, the Madeira wine of John Hancock was safely removed from the docks. 1 It is no coincidence that Boston would become the h eadquarters of the American Revolution.

What would be regarded as free trade for t he New England merchants was actually smuggling under the laws of Great Britain. The economic life of the colonies depended on breaking the laws. America became so adept at smuggling that it was the primar y means of supply- ing itself for the long war. Britain had passed a series of laws over the course of the previous hundred years, starting in 1660 when the king put r estrictions on cer- tain commodities. Tobacco was the first smuggled it em, and later molasses continued a lively business. In 1707 Parli ament forbade any commerce that did not sail through Britain and sail out on a British ship. In 1733 the Molasses Act closed the loopholes that allowed the Caribbean trade, as well as trading with the French .Virtually all trade in molasses was illegal under British maritime trade r ules, although they were rarely enforced. A commodity such as sugar cost 30 percent more from a British island in the Caribbean than in a French-controlled island. In fact, the available sugar produced for export in the British West Indies was not enough to keep the Rhode Island distillery business supplied. On the other hand, a ship loaded with lumber from New Engl and would not find enough of a market among the British islands. Trading with the Dutch and French was a necessity made illegal by re gulation. The Molasses Act, which specifically targeted the r um and sugar trade, appeared to New England merchants as intenti onally designed to aid the British West Indies plantations at the expe nse of the New England merchants. But from the English king's view point, he was merely treating American merchants equally. He rega rded merchants as ripe for the plucking. In fact, American merchants were possibly better protected at sea than were English merchants at hom e."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"104 The Lodge and the Revolution The merchants of the newly formed colonies would st eadily accept their positions as smugglers as the law became enti rely counterproduc- tive to business. Those who complied were soon out of business; those who defied the law succeeded. For the people seekin g freedom from religious persecution, necessity brought such chang es. The colonists were already persecuted by the very nature of their religion, so being on the wrong side of the trade laws mattered little . The Huguenots in Europe had already made a very str ong presence in the ranks of the merchant traders. They were oft en French, but under constant threat of the Catholic monarchy, they were a mobile popula- tion. Exiled for years in the Netherlands, they bec ame allied with Walloon-speaking peoples, and together they migrate d across the Atlantic. The anti-Rome reaction that later became known as t he Reformation began long before Martin Luther. The Ca thar movement in the south of France had been more of a threat to Rome than Islam represented. The Cathari believed in a purity in wh ich man and woman shared in directly relating to God. This purity was made possible with- out a patriarchal hierarchy of priests, bishops, ca rdinals, and popes. To the papacy the threat of losing power and the impli ed threat of loss of revenue produced by Church taxes were more importan t than the armies of Islam. The purists Cathari took as their symbol the dove, which even in Catholic art represents knowledge. Th e same Gnostic sentiment was shared by the Knights Templar. Their worship of an alleged severed head called Baphomet was actually a n appreciation of wisdom, or sophia in the Greek translation. Althoug h under torture some Templars confessed to worshiping a severed hea d, there is no proof of its existence. When the pope decided the Cathari would be the vict ims of a cru- sade, he had to get support from England; the Templ ars of France had refused. Ironically, the Templars, who were suppose d to take direction only from the pope, fought against their master. Th e end for the Cathari came at the siege of Montsegur, where Templar knigh ts defended the Cathari until their surrender."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Smugglers, Patriots, and Masons 105 While both the Templars and the Cathari were victim s of the Church, the tradition of a more humanistic Cathar r eligion continued. The blood of the Cathar defenders watered the soil of southern and western France, and when the seed of the reformers was planted three centuries later, it bore the most abundant fruit in those lands. Both the Templars and the Cathari carried their ideas into e xile into nearby Switzerland, and this group of cantons became a cou ntry that protected the reform movement. Although Martin Luther of Germany and John Calvin o f France, who were both exiled to Switzerland, were better kn own for the Reformation, it had begun earlier among the populac e of France. Hughes Besancon, a preacher, may have gave his name to the people of the Reformation, the Huguenots. They were often mor e than just spir- itual descendants of the earlier attempts at reform ing Christianity. The Templar eight-sided cross became the cross of Langu edoc and subse- quently the Huguenot cross. Combined with the desce nding dove, the symbolism of the cross and dove is hard to miss. THE TEMPLE AND THE CROSS As a large contingent of French Templars had surviv ed in what would become Switzerland, it is not surprising that the P rotestant Reformation, under leaders like John Calvin, would find refuge i n Switzerland at the same time that the religious revolution was spreadi ng rapidly through France and into England. Within twenty years of Cal vin's proselytizing, Huguenots were established in France; in Kent, Engl and; in the Channel Islands; and in the New World. The reaction to the conversion was equally swift. In 1545 Protestants were massacred—o ften burned at the stake—in twenty-two towns. It seemed like the anti- Cathar crusade was starting all over again. The powers behind the orig inal Knights Templar were often found on both sides of the reform moveme nt. The Guise fam- ily, which owned the border state of Lorraine, were militant Catholics. The duc de Guise instigated anti-Huguenot massacres and toppled any peaceful initiatives that the French king attempted ."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"106 The Lodge and the Revolution When Charles IX became king of France, the Queen Mo ther, Catherine de Medici, controlled France. While she w as allied with the Guise family, there was no peace. Through the centu ry the Christian- versus-Christian wars worsened, highlighted by high -level assassinations and ultimately the St. Bartholemew's Day Massacre, where tens of thou- sands of Huguenots were slaughtered. Finally Henry of Navarre became king. He owed his political survival to the Hugueno ts but needed to remain Catholic to be king. He could appease both g roups by bringing peace and religious tolerance to France with the Ed ict of Nantes in 1598. Religious freedom was granted in degrees to C hristians in seventy- five towns. By this time the port of La Rochelle, o nce a Templar strong- hold, was now a Huguenot stronghold. Reportedly the Catholic mass was not said for forty years in La Rochelle. The cross of Lorraine and the eight-pointed Maltese cross came to represent both sides of the religious conflict. To the Huguenots the cross with a descending dove represented the freedom to s eek God through individual knowledge. To the Catholic orders, such as the Knights of Saint John, the same cross represented the feudal o rder in which the Church and the king were the masters. The protection granted under the Edict of Nantes wa s suddenly revoked a century later, and fifty thousand familie s fled France for their safety. The Huguenots were a mobile population, but they were also highly organized in lodges or guilds. They would do minate many industries, such as thread and lace making, glassma king, and cloth man- ufacturing. With no homeland, many took to the sea as merchants and traders.

The series of laws designed to raise the king's taxes or protect his friends, such as the British East India Company, affected the colonies—s ome more than others. MERCHANTS AND SMUGGLERS For Virginia the laws weren't much of a detriment, as the state's prod- ucts were shipped directly to markets in England. N ew England in gen- eral, including Boston, was self-sufficient in comp arison, a mercantilist entity that had the materials and manpower to build ships and trade with the world. The currency of the time reflects j ust how important trade was. The most common currency in New England was the Spanish dollar, the famous piece of eight. While ma ny currencies traded hands, including money from France, the Netherlands , and Portugal, they were all valued against the Spanish dollar. Merchants who understood their business profited fr om the unworkable policies and unenforceable rules. A typi cal starting point was the British-owned island of Saint Kitts, which specialized in false British documents. On Saint Kitts a captain could p ay a cash-only fee to secure the necessary documents showing that his cargo was sold in a British port. From Saint Kitts he would then take t he cargo to whichever foreign island paid the best for his comm odity. Trade with foreign nations was so ingrained in New England that smuggling was just a natural consequence. The restr ictive laws, enacted one after another, were hardly enforced, as Britain did not have the means. Customs agents in general were receptive to bribes, as were many officials. The numerous ships of the Boston me rchants carried restricted items such as gunpowder, paper, and luxu ry goods along with bulk commodities like sugar, molasses, and spirits aboard the same ships as those carrying legal commodities. The damage done was twofold. The British presented arbitrary rules that were apparently designed to sacrifice th e interests of some to the interests of others. The Americans, an apparent ly principled people,"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"108 The Lodge and the Revolution were developing a deeper disrespect for the law. By the time of the Revolution, smuggling had been a way of life for tw o generations. John Faneuil, whose name is immortalized in Boston' s Faneuil Hall, was a French Huguenot whose fortune was built on di sobeying the laws of the absentee government. He was a Freemason at a time when most Masons belonged to lodges that were composed o f people in sim- ilar trades. Faneuil's lodge consisted of sea capta ins and merchants. John Hancock was another merchant, shipowner, Mason, and smuggler. John Hancock was born in Braintree, Massachusetts, in 1737. He was seven when his father died, so he was sent to l ive with his uncle Thomas. Thomas, an apprenticed bookbinder, had marr ied into one of New England's wealthiest merchant families, and as a result became rich himself. While he claimed he was in the whale-oil b usiness, he did much better than other legal commodity merchants. T he whale-oil business was one of the few legal trading businesse s in which a person could sell to Britain and get cash, in the form of sterling, rather than trade credits, which depended on the solvency of ot her houses. Thomas Hancock's ships carried foodstuffs to Newfou ndland, then took on whale oil in exchange and sailed for Englan d. Others, however, engaged in the same trade, and because of the volat ility in the prices of these commodities, the merchants would not always d o well. Hancock had a larger house, dressed in a more dignified sty le than his fellow mer- chants, and was rapidly building a small navy of tr ading ships. Hancock's secret was that he was importing tea from Saint Eustatius. He had his agents in England, in the Net herlands, and on the island that came to be called the Golden Rock. A Ha ncock ship would sail south to the Dutch port on Saint Eustatius wit h legally exported items and return with contraband. Hancock maintaine d a high degree of secrecy aboard his ships to avoid attracting att ention. His men were cautioned never to speak of their business, and wer e not allowed to write home to their wives. As a smuggler, Hancock was also a visionary. Most l ikely he received news of Europe through his agents in vario us ports. When he came to the conclusion that war in Europe would sp read to the"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Smugglers, Patriots, and Masons 109 colonies, he anticipated the profits it could bring from importing arms. 3 During the French and Indian Wars, the poorly suppl ied British troops came to Hancock's firm to buy munitions. Hancock's sudden rise in wealth thanks to sound bus iness practices— and illegal trading practices—eventually brought hi m attention. While his contemporaries were mystified by Hancock's wealth, the governor, Thomas Hutchinson, was not. But finding proof was a nother issue. Thanks to the wealth of Thomas Hancock and his firm , his nephew John, whom he adopted, was sent to Harvard and grad uated to a part- nership in the company. Thomas died in 1764, and Jo hn inherited the business. Today the value of his inheritance is est imated at more than $100 million. 4 While not yet thirty, John Hancock was at the helm of a thriving business. 5 He emulated his uncle in every way; he valued his ostentatious home, he rode in a fine carriage, and he made his money in the smuggling business. One of the goods Hancock smuggled was tea. With the opening of trade in China, Americans, like their British cousi ns, became addicted to the exotic beverage. The colonists drank an estimat ed six million pounds of tea per year. In 1773 Hancock supplied one milli on pounds. It was, of course, good business, but although it was very pro fitable, it was also ille- gal. The British East India Company was given a mon opoly over the tea business, and as coincidence would have it, Thomas Hutchinson, the act- ing governor of Massachusetts, was an investor in t he company. In fact, he committed all his capital to company shares. 6 In addition, his pay was linked to how much tax he collected on the tea. The British East India Company was the second large st British financial institution, second only to the Bank of E ngland. It was also near bankruptcy, as it had not managed to addict Ch ina to opium yet. The company set the price of tea at three shillings a pound, compared with the two shillings a pound set by the Dutch. Th e company so important to the British aristocracy then had the B ritish government ban all other tea. It was a move that served only t o make smuggling profitable and to pit the governor of Massachusetts against her wealthy citizens, who rose to the occasion."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"110 The Lodge and the Revolution Hancock remained a member of the Grand Lodge for a year, and when he received his inheritance he returned to a G rand Lodge, min- gling with people of similar newfound merchant stat us. His business, however, depended on the labor of the dockworkers a nd shipbuilders, warehousemen and carpenters, so he could not separa te himself com- pletely from the common men of Boston. Hancock rema ined close to Sam Adams, who had the ear of the worker populace o n which Hancock prospered. Carefully treading his way in bo th circles was a necessity, and when it came time to putting his wor kers between him- self and the British law, Hancock didn't hesitate. If Hancock's motivation for rebelling against the c rown seemed only monetary, he was fortunate to meet men whose m otivations were political. SAMUEL ADAMS Sam Adams was born in Boston. His father, Samuel Sr ., was a pillar of the community and was called the Deacon. He was a m erchant who owned a wharf, he was a brewer, and he was an inves tor in land and property. His high status did not keep him above re nting houses that were used as brothels. However, young Sam had grown up with an aversion to sin; he didn't smoke or drink. Born int o a family of twelve children, he enrolled in Harvard at age fourteen an d placed fifth in his graduating class of twenty-two scholars. High standards did not mean great fortune for the s on of the Deacon. Samuel Sr. had lost one third of his money in the e arly 1740s as a result of a currency crisis. Sam Jr., who was studying law at the time, had to leave school. He waited tables. He went to work in a countinghouse but left the position by mutual consent with the owner. He borrowed £1,000 to start a business, but it failed and the d ebt remained. Adams then went to work in his father's brewery. But it a ppeared that Sam Jr. was not career bound; he dressed badly, often wearing t he same clothes for days. He had no money, and whatever money he occasi onally had he for- got to carry with him. He had few prospects."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Smugglers, Patriots, and Masons 111 Adams did have a strong sense of values, in both pe rsonal life and political affairs. When he was not allowed entry in the Caucus Club, which dominated political affairs, he started his o wn. While the Caucus Club appealed to the wealthy shipowners and merchan ts like Thomas Hancock, Sam Adams's club allowed in the dockworker and the mill worker. Within his circle were the Loyall Nine, who would manipulate mobs, sometimes by simply putting up signs all over Boston to bring out the mobs the next day. Sam Adams was not a Free mason, but his circles overlapped with Masonic groups and his own secretive cells. He manipulated Masons, dockworkers, shipwrights, and s hipowners for his cause. When Sam Jr. was twenty-six, his father died. Sam i nherited the brewery, as well as enough money to pay off his deb ts. He also had enough money to get married; the next year he wed E lizabeth Checkley. But the idyllic life didn't last long. Ad ams's poor management of the brewery caused the firm to fail. Adams was elected tax collector of Boston a short t ime later, a job that would last until he was forty-seven. It was, h owever, not a pleasant career. He was accused of malfeasance, sued several times, and almost lost his own property at auction. His failing was h is inability to collect from many people, as Boston had suffered severe rec essions that kept many unemployed, yet Adams would still count them a s having paid. His crime, according to one biographer, was being k indhearted, although at the same time he was considered a poor handler of money. When Elizabeth died, Adams was at least solvent eno ugh to marry a second time. In 1764 he owned a home, received in come from the wharf, and had a new wife, two children, and a Newf oundland dog that had acquired a hatred for anyone in a British unifo rm. If his personal financial status was rocky at best, Adams's politic al thesis always remained solid. He believed the loss of a single li berty was the first step to enslavement.

While most of Boston's merchants were going around the laws of England, Adams believed in confronting the laws. Three years before the Liberty was seized in Boston's port, Adams and John Hancock had started a letter-writing campaign to fight the Stam p Act. The meeting of Adams and Hancock may be one of the most crit- ical events of the war for independence. Hancock pr ovided the money to keep Adams's political clubs afloat while Adams validated the ideals and enlisted the mobs that would make sure everyone heard about them. Following the Stamp Act, an Adams-incited mob from the water- front attacked the Admiralty Court and attempted to destroy all its records. Then it turned on the home of Justice Hutc hinson, who years earlier had outlawed paper money, bringing ruin to many including Adams's father. A Sam Adams editorial the next day condemned mob violence and pointed out the unfairness of the Stam p Act. In the edi- torial he called the mobs the Sons of Liberty, nami ng them after a speech in the English Parliament by Isaac Barre sym pathizing with the American cause. Chapters of the Sons of Liberty wer e then started in every city in the North. When the Liberty was seized, Sam Adams again arouse d the mobs, telling them, \"If you are men, behave like men.\" 7 He also started a cel- ebration to commemorate three years of resistance t o the Stamp Act. Free beer flowed thanks to his brewery. But even as Adams was respon- sible for inciting the mobs, he and a handful of pa triot leaders later negotiated peace. Hancock was acquitted of smugglin g charges and the mobs went unpunished. This rebellion, along with a general boycott of British goods in Boston and Philadelphia, led to th e repeal of the Townshend Acts, but Britain would still quarter tro ops in Boston. Although the situation quieted, the mobs were given plenty of fod- der for future riots. While the officers of the Bri tish were welcomed in Tory homes, the common man had no room for the comm on soldier. Bar brawls and street fights were started among com moners, and many British soldiers deserted as a result of the harsh treatment and the hos- tile daily life.

The fight res ulted in gunfire from the redcoats, and four Bostonians were killed. As w as Adams's style, the confrontation was orchestrated; three days before t he incident, posters appeared informing that the British would be attack ing townspeople. Adams's newspaper had been publishing incidents of boys being roughed up by soldiers and of rape committed by the occupying army. The day of the massacre church bells all over Bosto n rang to alert peo- ple that something was happening. Adams would dub t he incident the Boston Massacre, a name that has survived in the hi story books. Remarkably, the patriots again brokered the peace. John Adams, who had defended John Hancock in the Liberty incide nt, defended the captain of the British soldiers in the Boston Massa cre. The confrontations worked, but even after repealing the Townshend Acts, the king of England decided not to lose face and keep the exclu- sive right of the British East India Company to sel l tea to America. He would also appoint just which agents could import t he tea in America. The colonies responded by boycotting tea. Consumpti on of tea dropped dramatically. In 1769 the colonies had impo rted tea costing 900,000 pounds sterling, a figure that dropped to 2 37,000 pounds ster- ling three years later. This drop of almost 75 perc ent did not help the British East India Company, which was nearly bankru pt. The king decided that the tea would be forced on the colonie s. In October 1773 Philadelphia was first to hold meet ings and appoint a committee to challenge the authority of t he king and the British East India Company. They forced the British tea agents to resign. In November meetings in Boston attempted to force a similar action, but the colonial governor was opposed to th eir resignation. Three ships sailed into Boston Harbor, and despite the colonists' refusal to unload them, Governor Hutchinson demanded that t he city pay the tax on the tea aboard the ships, even if they saile d away unloaded. Sam Adams addressed a crowd of eight thousand to ra lly the oppo- sition to the tea tax, but that was just part of th e plan. At the Green Dragon Tavern, later called Freemasons Hall, Saint Andrew's Lodge and other groups, some clandestine, would meet. While t he Masonic groups"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"114 The Lodge and the Revolution were aboveboard and signed in at every meeting, oth er groups such as the Committee of Correspondence, the North End Cauc us, and the Sons of Liberty (with their core group, the Loyall Nine) could not always afford to be so open. The Freemasons, which was an ancient order-chartered lodge, had the largest and most ope n membership, and often membership overlapped between it and other or ganizations. The North End Caucus consisted of the wealthier shipown ers; the Masons were more a working-class group. Adams and his Sons of Liberty decided to dress up a s Mohawks and board the British tea ships. They cracked open ten thousand pounds' worth of Darjeeling tea and dumped it into the water. The night of the event, which became known as the Bosto n Tea Party, was a regular lodge-meeting night. Only five members sh owed up for the meeting, however, signing their names and leaving a notation in the book that the meeting would not be held on account of the lack of attendance. These members were most likely Tories o r were at least opposed to the planned activity, and their signatur es would possibly serve as alibis. At least twelve of the thirty know n \"Mohawks\" were Saint Andrew's Lodge members, although Sam Adams wa s not, and twelve more would join the lodge after the Tea Part y. At a time when the Modern Lodges were often Whig and Protestant an d the ancient lodges were more Tory, Stuart-leaning, and often ev en Catholic, the ancient lodge of Saint Andrew's defied the classifi cation of American Masonry. Sam Adams was the one to be contended with, and the king knew it. In a late attempt to stop the resistance, Adams was visited by General Gage, who, on behalf of King George, offered Adams a deal he wasn't supposed to be able to refuse. The choice was to ma ke peace with the king and be paid for backing down or to risk the wr ath of the king. Adams's reply was, \"Sir, I trust I have long since made my peace with the King of kings.\"The Sons of Liberty sent New Eng land horsemen south to the other colonies, posting handbills with a skull and cross- bones warning them of the British reaction. 8 Adams, while not a Mason, displayed the traditional ideals of the"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Smugglers, Patriots, and Masons 115 craft: liberty, fraternity, and equality. Meanwhile Hancock, a Mason, an elitist who favored a class structure even within t he craft, was an active attendee of both a modern and an ancient lodge. A t hird brand of Masonry was also developing in the Americas: the Mi litary Lodge. THE MILITARY LODGE Shortly after the Grand Lodge went public in the ea rly eighteenth cen- tury, Freemasonry began to grow in both the colonie s and the English army. Within the army the \"lodge\" was now mobile an d the parapher- nalia of Masonry carried by the regiment. The comma nder of a unit was typically the master of the lodge, and both off icers and common soldiers were brought together by the brotherhood o f the lodge. It often allowed the common-born to advance in rank to offic ers, an option not available before becoming a lodge brother. Commissi ons of officers were still purchased, but the commander would frequ ently lend the candidate the funds for his commission. The Irish Grand Lodge, not the English Grand Lodge, authorized the military field lodges. In 1754 the French and I ndian Wars began as a result of French and English hostilities in Europ e. The population of the colonies had been growing by leaps and bounds, due to immigra- tion from Scotland and Ireland. The new lands offer ed an escape from the religious war and from post-Culloden persecutio n, and provided a way to increase one's standing in the world. Many s erved in the mili- tary specifically for the social advancement, and i t was no secret that being admitted into a lodge was the ticket—and not just for the com- mon soldier. Jeffrey Amherst began his career in the military du ring the War of Austrian Succession. His military prowess earned hi m recognition, but by the end of that war he was a middling officer wi thout the prospect of advancement. Although he had been aide-de-camp t o General John Ligonier, Amherst was serving as a procurement offi cer. The outbreak of war gave Ligonier the chance to recommend his pr otege for a posi- tion, yet Amherst did not have the funds to buy a c ommission. The"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"116 The Lodge and the Revolution funds were loaned by Lionel Sackville, the First Du ke of Dorset. Sackville's two sons were very active in Masonry; C harles Sackville founded a lodge in Italy and was a close friend of Sir Francis Dashwood, and George Sackville was a regimental lod ge master who would later become the grand master of the Irish Gr and Lodge. With the help of friends in high places, Amherst was put in charge of the siege of Louisbourg in Nova Scotia. Amherst's victo ry at Louisbourg and Ticonderoga and his efforts in attacking Montre al led him to the position of commander of all the British forces in the colonies. Wherever Amherst served he established a field lodg e, and his influ- ence grew because of his military exploits. Amherst was one of the ear- liest commanders to establish the different fightin g methods that would work well in the Americas. Instead of two opposing regiments simply picking away at each other, the new tactics of shar pshooting, camou- flage, skirmishing, and scouting were employed in t he heavily wooded hills of Pennsylvania and New York. Under Amherst's command many of America's prominent Revolutionary War heroes rec eived their train- ing. These included Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold , who fought at Ticonderoga; Israel Putnam, who later would be the hero of Bunker Hill; Charles Lee, who participated in the attack o n Montreal; and the New York patrician Philip Schuyler. 9 Amherst captured Louisbourg, Ticonderoga, and finally Montreal in 1760 in the co up that would cause France to admit defeat and sue for peace. Amherst was not the only high-ranking military offi cer to spread Freemasonry throughout the English forces in Americ a. Under his command was Lieutenant Colonel John Young, who foug ht at Louisbourg and Quebec. Young had been appointed dep uty grand master of the Scottish Lodge by William St. Clair o f Rosslyn. In 1757 Young was the provincial grand master for all the S cottish lodges in America and the West Indies. He was succeeded by Au gustine Prevost, who became grand master of all the warranted lodges in the British army that were Scottish Rite. 10 From Amherst to Young, Prevost, and further down the command, the Temple and the Lodge systems show how junior officers have been promoted and subseque ntly put in"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Smugglers, Patriots, and Masons 117 charge of lodges that would later dominate Canadian provinces. When the American Revolution broke out, many high-r anking British Masons refused to play a role in defeating the American colonists. Sir Jeffrey Amherst turned down a comman d. Because the Freemasons fought on both sides of the war and Tory -leaning Masons even attended the Green Dragon Tavern in Boston, it is not possible to reach the conclusion that a massive Masonic conspir acy was responsi- ble for the defeat of the British. However, numerou s minor conspira- cies swirled that certainly thwarted the British mi litary effort. Between the Boston Tea Party and the outbreak of wa r, the groups that Samuel Adams created built up a guerrilla move ment that operated from the inner core, the Loyall Nine, and spread to other cells. From there a militia was created and munitions were obta ined in secrecy and kept hidden. English intelligence was active too, a nd soon the English decided to seize the munitions and the patriot lead ers. They sent troops into the countryside. The famous \"one if by land, t wo if by sea\" warn- ing was given by Paul Revere, a descendant of a Fre nch Huguenot fam- ily and a master craftsman and a Mason. War broke out on April 19, 1775, when the Massachus etts militia, alerted by Revere, attempted to head off an advance guard of British troops. This first battle of Lexington and Concord would go down in history as \"the shot heard round the world.\" Three weeks later Ethan Allen and Mason Benedict Arnold captured Fort Ticon deroga in New York to obtain badly needed supplies and ammunition . In June the Battle of Bunker Hill exposed the weaknesses of bot h sides. The British \"won\" the battle at a tremendous cost, leading many to question the motives of General Gage, who could have cut off the Americans from reinforcements and didn't, and General Howe, who ha d let the American forces withdraw intact. The American forces had their own doubts as well.

Among some of the militia, officers were"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"118 The Lodge and the Revolution elected, and at critical moments the soldiers huddl ed together to decide their plan. Two days before Bunker Hill, John Adams decided tha t the colonists needed a \"Continental Army\" and a command er. His choice for the latter was George Washington. Within days t he Continental Congress appointed Washington general and commander in chief of the American army. George Washington was initiated into Masonry on Nov ember 4, 1752, at the age of twenty, in the lodge at Frederi cksburg, Virginia. His entrance fee was a steep twenty-three pounds sterli ng, an amount the aver- age man would be unable to afford. But Washington w as not an average man, and although his lodge was an ancient lodge, i t still attracted men of greater means. George Washington's life seemed s et for that of a modest landowner until 1752, when his brother died. George had looked up to his brother, Lawrence, who had sailed to the West Indies under the command of Admiral Edward Vernon (the nam esake of Mount Vernon) to fight the Spanish. When Lawrence s uggested George take a seaman's job, their mother prevented him. Hi s brother's family, however, was soon hit with tragedy: Lawrence's thre e children suc- cumbed to tuberculosis. George went to Barbados wit h Lawrence in the hopes of alleviating his brother's condition, b ut the climate change did not help and Lawrence soon died too. Through inheritance George's landholdings grew to 2 ,500 acres. 11 Through marriage he would add another 17,500 acres, increasing both his wealth and his social standing. He rose quickly in his lodge as well, attaining the rank of Master Mason within a year. B ut it was an ancient lodge and not particularly influential. From his brother George had stood to inherit a mili tary rank, that of the colony's adjutant general. The position was divided into three, and George was forced to lobby for a lower rank. He intended to use the position as a starting point and quickly volunt eered for action against the French. On his first expedition against the French he was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and he was made sec ond in command for another expedition. The driven young commander, who constantly"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Smugglers, Patriots, and Masons 119 set plans and rules for himself in writing, had bro ken from the rules of his family. He was a natural leader because of his impressive bearing and his understanding that keeping a certain distance e ncouraged respect from his men. From his earliest time in the militar y George looked to his Masonic brothers to fill positions of importanc e. He brought a Dutch interpreter from his Fredericksburg lodge on his next expedition against the French. This Masonic brother, however, would let Washington down after the loss of Fort Necessity. 12 Negotiating the terms of surrender of the fort was difficult because of the language barrier between the French and Amer ican command- ers. The interpreter rushed through a document in t he rain, and since it was poorly translated, it appeared to frame the Eng lish not only as the provocateurs but also as assassins. The French had already claimed the English were the aggressors, and Washington's initi al foray was unpro- voked. Washington was then put under review and dem oted. When he went to war he would go back to the Fredericksburg lodge only once, instead becoming active in the military lodges. Before long, another engagement in the French and I ndian Wars allowed Washington's bravery to shine through and r estored his briefly tarnished reputation. The war had spread to Europe and claimed nearly one million military casualties. The loss of pounds sterling was equally distressing to England, which raised taxes. Unable to collect the neces- sary taxes at home, Parliament turned to the coloni es. The series of repressive measures that would lead to the seizure of the Liberty, John Hancock's ship, and to the beginning of revolution in Boston had their roots in the actions of the French and English wars from years earlier. Washington returned home from war to live the life of a country gentleman. He was elected to the House of Burgesses on his third try— possibly because of his engagement to the wealthy w idow Martha Dandridge Custis. Her 17,500 acres did much to incr ease his social standing, and there is evidence that this is what t he young military offi- cer sought in a marriage. Just before settling down , he visited another young heiress, Eliza Philipse, for the last time. S he was one of the inher- itors of a real-estate empire built by the profits earned from supporting"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"120 The Lodge and the Revolution piracy. Washington had been courting Philipse for a while before her family's Tory stance distanced them from the Washin gton family, which was decidedly Whig. While Boston's ancient lodges often represented the more common working man, Virginia's lodges usually leaned towar d the aristocratic elite. Washington himself was no exception. When Wa shington's stepson John Parke Custis attended Kings College in New Yor k, the boy ate with the faculty—a privilege not granted to any oth er student. 13 After Washington was appointed military commander, he immedi- ately set out to create a real army. He asked the m en of the various mili- tia groups to commit to an enlistment of one year, only to discover that few were willing. In fact, the entire Connecticut m ilitia decided to head home. Washington wrote, \"Such a dirty, mercenary sp irit pervades.\" 14 He then turned to his Masonic brethren for officers . He hoped that the unity found in the lodge system could be brought to the ragtag conti- nentals. According to Lafayette, Washington \"never willingly gave inde- pendent command to officers who were not Freemasons .\" At least twelve of the generals in Washington's army were Ma sons. 15 Washington first looked for candidates from his own Fredericksburg Lodge, later called the No. 4 Lodge, from which he appointed several of his commanders. General Hugh M ercer of Virginia, who would die of wounds at Princeton, was a Mason in the Fredericksburg Lodge. Brigadier General William Woo dford was a member of the same lodge, while Brigadier General G eorge Weedon was made a Mason at the Port Royal Kilwinning Cross Lodge, which was affiliated with Fredericksburg. Brigadier Gener al Paul Muhlenberg, who was a member of the Royal Arch Lodge No. 3 of P hiladelphia, was also from Virginia. The British gave Washington a year to put together a fighting force. Why they had not pursued the weak and nonunified co lonials in New England is one of the major questions of the Americ an Revolution. Instead they abandoned New England and made brief i nconsequential forays elsewhere in the colonies. Washington antici pated that New York City was where the British would attempt to get ser ious, and he was"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Smugglers, Patriots, and Masons 121 right. A massive fighting force of thirty-two thous and troops, the largest the colonies had ever seen, was on its way to New Y ork. Washington had fortified Brooklyn Heights, only to be faced with a force that threatened to end the war in one fell swoop. While Washington made a mistake by positioning his troops with their backs to the water, fishermen and sailors from Massachuse tts rescued 9,500 men by ferrying them to Manhattan. At the same time , General Howe stopped his advance and sipped tea for two hours in Murray Hill at the residence of Mrs. Robert Murray. Washington continu ed his retreat to White Plains, then across the Hudson to Fort Lee an d west across New Jersey. The British followed slowly. The British clearly had the advantage: a superior l and army com- plete with nine thousand foreign mercenaries, a lar ge navy, ample sup- plies, a large treasury to buy more supplies, and e ven a large loyalist population, the Tories, who aided their efforts. Th e Americans had an inferior force, no navy, inadequate supplies, and n o means to buy more. Their own population had divided loyalties, as did their leaders. So how did the Continental army defeat the British? The wa r was won by the efforts of a handful of men, often bound by Masonic ties and sometimes united by religious events, often operating illegal ly and almost always acting in a self-serving way. In the end the crowni ng achievement, vic- tory at Yorktown, was accomplished by an audacious act of bribery that was not atypical of the times."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 FRANKLIN AND THE MASONIC UNDERGROUND ne of the greatest untold stories of the American R evolution involves the behind-the-scenes intrigues of Benjami n Franklin and his European cohorts. Had it not been for Frank lin's efforts to keep the colonials supplied and funded and to bring Fren ch and Spanish allies aboard, the war might not have turned out th e same. Franklin operated through Masonic groups in England and Fran ce, and his part- ners in the pro-American war effort were more often than not hedo- nists, occultists, Rosicrucians, slave traders, and spies. Franklin had made his fortune by a young age, mostl y through his ownership of newspapers and Poor Richard's Almanack . He was a Quaker but also had occult tendencies. Franklin could be c alled a pioneer of the New Age, as he meditated every morning and evening, occasionally practiced vegetarianism, and was concerned with lif e after death and the possibility of reincarnation. He was a self-ass ured, happy extrovert who popularized hard work and frugality while enjoy ing the high life and a liberal sexual code. He enjoyed the company o f women and wrote about the joy of sex with older women. 1 Franklin was a joiner and a founder who would start his own polit- ical club, the Junto, as well as the Philosophical Society. He planned to create the United Party for Virtue when he was intr oduced to Masonry. The craft employed the ideals that Franklin valued, and it also attracted him because of its esoteric roots.

While it had no social barriers, the craft did place an emph asis on assisting the already elite gentlemen of the city. How else could a printer's appren- tice meet the Penns and Shippens of Philadelphia? Franklin became a Freemason in the Lodge of Saint J ohn in Philadelphia in 1731. The lodge was made up of the leading merchants of the city; in fact, 75 percent of its members wer e merchants or sea captains. 2 Franklin jumped in with two feet, using his intell ect and his printing presses to promote Masonry, writing pro-Ma sonry articles, drafting the lodge's bylaws, and printing the first Masonic book in America. Masonry brought him contacts and contracts , and he attrib- uted his being awarded the contract as assembly pri nter to his \"friends in the House.\" 3 His fortunes soared in the ten years after his ini tiation. As an independently wealthy publisher, Franklin was ever the stu- dent, \"majoring\" in philosophy and \"minoring\" in po litics. He rose to master of his lodge and shortly afterward to grand master of the province. He was among the first to speak out again st taxation without representation and went to England in 1754 for that purpose. It was Franklin who drew up a plan of union that included a large house of representatives. 4 Franklin established firehouses, hospitals, librari es, and street light- ing. He was occasionally self-serving, and his post office was started in part so his newspapers could be delivered for free. He owned eight newspapers in places from New York to Antigua, incl uding a German- language newspaper in Pennsylvania. In 1748, at age forty-two, he retired from the newspaper business to devote his l ife to his science and politics, although he never stopped writing. 5 While Franklin is remembered for his public works a nd practical proverbs, another side of him is generally ignored. His world straddled both the practical day-to-day existence among the n ew colonies and the esoteric secrets of science. His connections to philosophers, Rosicrucians, occultists, and especially Masons all owed Franklin to move freely around all sides of the conflict."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"124 The Lodge and the Revolution THE HELLFIRE CLUB Among the men Franklin met on his pre-Revolution tr avels to England was Sir Francis Dashwood. Dashwood was the chancell or of the exchequer and also the founder of his own society, the Dilettanti, and later another semisecret group called the Friars of Saint Francis or the Monks of Medmenham. Neither group bore any resembla nce to a reli- gious order. Dashwood s parties were infamous and w ere said to have included prostitutes dressed as nuns, satanic rites , goddess worship, and orgies. Dashwood was the son of a wealthy businessman, a Ma son who was initiated in Italy at a very early age and who marr ied into aristocracy. Dashwood sat in the House of Commons for more than twenty years and held numerous posts, including chancellor of th e exchequer, treas- urer to King George III, and postmaster general. Th is Mason's money allowed him to rebuild his family's ancestral home in West Wycombe in a way that would make Caligula proud—complete with statues of Greek and Roman deities, ceiling murals inspired by ancient Rome, and even a lake created to stage mock naval battles . The west wing of the building was a re-creation of a classical templ e to Bacchus, with Dionysus and Ariadne in leopard-drawn chariots. Ano ther room in Dashwood's mansion was designed like a Masonic temp le. His pagan theme extended to the garden, with erotic depiction s of classical gods and goddesses in stone. Nearby was the Abbey of Medmenham, which Dashwood a lso modified into a pagan monument, with a carving over the front entrance advising, \"Do as thou will.\" The dining ro om, however, with its statues of the Egyptian and Roman gods of silen ce, advised visitors not to speak about their adventures.

Once a membe r of a druidic order founded in 1717 to revive the Celtic religion (members also included the poet William Blake, a druid and the gr and master of a Rosicrucian order), Dashwood was expelled as the st ories of the West Wycombe activities spread. In 1758 Franklin was in England and West Wycombe, a nd he and Dashwood met to discuss their vision for the coloni es. Franklin was admitted into the Hellfire Club, where he mingled w ith luminaries such as John Stuart, the Earl of Bute; John Wilkes, a radical politician, member of Parliament, and later Lord Mayor of Londo n; John Montagu, the Earl of Sandwich; the son of the Archb ishop of Canterbury; and the Prince of Wales. John Stuart, the third Earl of Bute, was born in Ed inburgh and was the first Scottish-born British prime minister. Edu cated at Eton and the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, Stuart mar ried Mary Wortley Montagu. His status was elevated further when he me t the Prince of Wales at the races and became a member of his card- playing clique. Frederick Louis, the Prince of Wales, was the son o f King George II, who was then the ruler of England. George II de tested his son, as did the queen, and neither wanted anything to do with h im, despite the fact that he was heir to the throne.Young Frederick was small, frail, and ugly, with a low receding forehead, bulging eyes, baggy e yelids, and a flabby double chin. In effect, he was a Hanoverian. 7 Frederick and his wife, Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, were evicted from K ensington. Frederick found refuge in the weeklong orgies at We st Wycombe, and Princess Augusta would give birth to George III, th e boy who would be king during the revolution in the colonies. John Wilkes, the young Parliament member, was, like Sam Adams, the son of a malt distiller. He married a much olde r woman, the heiress Mary Meade, for the convenience her money offered. She owned a large estate at Aylesbury, although Wilkes spent li ttle time there. Instead he lived the lifestyle of many English aristocrats: as a rake and a gambler."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"126 The Lodge and the Revolution Wilkes soon lost his wife's fortune and then separa ted from her and turned to politics. Despite his active participatio n in the Hellfire orgies, he came to hate the English king and the Earl of Bu te. When the earl was made prime minister, a large number of members of Parliament were unhappy, as Bute was considered incompetent. W ilkes in particu- lar turned on his old friends at the Hellfire Club and went public, speaking out in Parliament against the monarchy and for a constitu- tional government. In his most famous speech, published in issue 45 of the North Briton, a journal he distributed, Wilkes declared: \"The pre rogative of the crown is to exert the constitutional powers entrusted to it in a way, not of blind favor and partiality, but of wisdom and judgment. . . . The people too have their prerogative.\" Interpreting the last line as an invitation to rev- olution, the king had Wilkes imprisoned in the Towe r, although his Parliamentary immunity soon earned his freedom. Aft er returning to Parliament, Wilkes continued to write, and his late r writings, which mixed obscenity and power, earned him expulsion. In England and America, however, Wilkes was viewed as a hero. 8 In 1774 he was elected Lord Mayor of London. The active Freemason served a s a secret British representative of the American Sons of Liberty and raised money for the Continental Army, which would be passed through Franklin. Another member of the Hellfire Club was the Earl of Sandwich, John Montagu. Educated at Eton and Cambridge, well traveled, and an active member of the Royal Society, Montagu was als o a rake and a gambler. He is rumored to have refused to leave the gaming tables even to eat, instead placing meat between slices of brea d and thus inventing the sandwich. His personal life was as tragic as hi s public life was full of accomplishments. His wife, Dorothy, left him while she was suffering from progressive mental illness. His mistress, Mart ha Ray, was a popular seventeen-year-old singer when they met. Montagu sh ared his home with Ray for seventeen years, until the singer was murdered by a deranged clergyman who wanted to marry her. Montagu had several military appointments including Lord Admiralty of the English navy. He was responsible f or modernizing the"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Franklin and the Masonic Underground 127 navy, but his navy still lost the Revolution to ups tart American fighters and their French allies. Montagu was almost immorta lized when he sponsored the expedition of Captain Cook, who disco vered the \"Sandwich Islands\" in the middle of the Pacific. Th e islands would later undergo a name change, however, to Hawaii. Sandwich met Dashwood in 1740 and became a member o f the Dilettanti and the Order of Saint Francis. Sandwich met Benjamin Franklin when he headed the navy, and they became f ast friends, as both enjoyed the parties at their mutual friend s West W ycombe home. With Montagu in charge of the navy, Dashwood in charge o f the English mail system, and Franklin heading the Committee of Secre t Correspondence, the men were an odd threesome. At such an early period of the mail system, postmas ter would also mean \"spymaster,\" as the chief postman had access t o all the mail. Franklin had been in England for years as an agent of Pennsylvania and later as spokesman for America, and he was brought up on charges and ordered before the Privy Council at the time Englan d was receiving news of the Boston Tea Party. Franklin was charged with attempting to create an American republic, but he suffered only t he loss of his office as postmaster for the colonies. The spy was also be ing spied on, his own mail being opened and read. FRANKLIN IN FRANCE The contributions of Franklin and the anti-Tory sup port in England cannot be overestimated. From behind the scenes a p ropaganda war was launched to keep English public opinion divided. Wh en American intelligence got wind of the hiring of Hessian merc enaries, Franklin went into action. He worked with Jefferson to fight the Hessians on two fronts. In Europe Franklin penned a letter alle gedly written by a German prince to his American commander, arguing th at the British figures for the Hessian dead were too low, and that he was being cheated out of his payment for each of the dead sol diers.

In America Je fferson distrib- uted notices offering Hessian deserters land grants in the colonies. In the end, more than five thousand Hessians deserted. It is possible that friends in high places—and in l ow ones—helped Franklin avoid being hanged as a traitor. He soon e stablished his Revolutionary War headquarters in Paris. Franklin a nd family did not traffic with the common French people; instead they were wined and dined, entertained, and boarded by the aristocracy. The high-born of France and England were well acquainted with each o ther and the backstage intrigues would frequently cause embarras sment to those involved. One of Franklin's acquaintances, Caroline Howe, was the sis- ter of General Sir William Howe, who had fought at Quebec and was rumored to be getting a command in America. 9 Another brother, Admiral Lord Richard Howe, was already the commande r of the British navy's efforts in the colonies. General How e's sister brought Howe and Franklin together, a move that led later t o accusations against General Howe. Franklin understood the value of the people who pli ed the seas in trade. They were an all-important means of supply a nd communica- tion, they were generally supportive of the cause o f liberty, and because almost all of them routinely broke the ever -changing series of trade laws, they operated in secretive brotherho ods. Masonry ruled the seas, and even Franklin needed an entry to gain the trust of the merchants. In France such connections were made through Sieur Montaudoin of Nantes and Dr. Jacques Barbeu-Dubourg of Paris. When Franklin reached France, he headed straight for the Masonic stronghold of Nantes. The busy port was controlled by merchants, and few had any intention of following the rules that hindered trad e. They communi- cated through a series of codes that kept outsiders from penetrating their cabal. Nantes was also a slave-trading port—F rance's largest—and the triangular trade that brought slaves and muniti ons to America depended on the Caribbean merchants, who were often Americans."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Franklin and the Masonic Underground 129 The relations between French and American smugglers would be very important in the fight for independence. The French slave traders were heavily armed and often carried letters of marque t hat allowed them to take a British ship. Franklin's new friends were va luable assets to the American cause; Dubourg bought the badly needed sup plies, which were carried on Montaudoin's ships. In Paris, Franklin's wartime acquaintances were all Masons, and they helped gain him membership in three Masonic lodges. The most presti- gious was the Lodge of the Nine Sisters. Franklin w as rapidly admitted into the lodge, which was a nest of political activ ity. The lodge had com- mitted itself to the politics of the reform of Fren ch society. One of its goals was to provide an alternative education syste m, which would take control from the Catholic Church. Public lectures w ere given on history, religion, and science at the lodge-sponsored Colleg e of Apollo. One Masonic writer even credits Franklin with creating the Apollonian Society to further his goal of uniting science and religion. Later revolu- tionary zeal caused the college to rename itself th e Lycee Republicain. Members included the duc de La Rochefoucauld, who t ranslated the American Constitution into French, 10 Captain John Reinhold Forster, who would sail with Cook, and the philosopher Volta ire. Franklin, in fact, would be present at the initiation ofVoltaire into the lodge in April 1778. Dr. Edward Bancroft, a friend of Franklin's as well as an agent for Lord Auckland, the head of the British spy network, was another member. After the war, John Paul Jones was admitted into th e order. The intrigue that assisted Franklin in building his support network in France defies full understanding. At once the high- ranking Masons of the Lodge of the Nine Sisters appeared to be both pro-C hurch and anti- Church. Many of the members met at the salon of the wealthy and eccentric Anne-Catherine de Ligniville d'Autricourt Helvetius, who was despised by John Adams and was also the target of F ranklin's amorous interests. Her salon was regularly attended by memb ers of Catholic reli- gious orders and by men of business and science.

The most suitable form of government, they believed, was a constitutional monarchy that maintained a kin g, as well as a strong relationship with the Catholic Church. The headquarters for this intrigue was at Saint-Sul pice in Paris. Here met the priests who would later be ostracized because they refused allegiance to the Revolutionary (anti-Catho lic) state. Instead, they allied themselves with the Knights of Malta, w ho also found them- selves threatened by the mob state and later by Nap oleon. A cure of Saint-Sulpice would one day be the confessor to the wife of the Marquis de Lafayette, Marie Adrienne d'Ayen de Noai lles. Lafayette had fought for freedom from the tyrannical monarchy in England but found new problems at home after the war. His refus al to take the oath of the new government became a dividing line that f orced the Lafayette family to take a stance. They sided with the Cathol ic Church and paid the price. Many aristocrats and Church leaders literally lost their heads as a result of the Revolution, which was as much against the Church as the monarchy. But Saint-Sulpice and its secret Company of the Sacred Sacrament survived. After the French Revolution, an order of the com- pany called the Ladies of the Sacred Heart enjoyed the support of the d'Ayen family. Their duty was a constant devotion t o the sacred sacra- ment, an unveiled host. Every hour a sister would r eplace the last sister in the perpetual vigil. Even this order of sisters was forced to operate in secrecy. Such steadfast devotion to the mysteries of faith c ontrasted with the practical realism of men of science, but this was n ot an issue to Masonic cabals like the Nine Sisters and religious centers of influence such as Saint-Sulpice. Whatever Franklin's opinions might h ave been, he kept them to himself. He had a role to play, namely the securing of supplies for the struggling colonies.

Such connections were i nvaluable, and helped procure badly needed supplies that were then shipped on Mason-owned ships such as the Jean Baptiste, which was named for Masonry's greatest saint. Ninety percent of the gun powder used by Washington's army originated in France. Through the efforts of Franklin and his Masonic col laborators in Europe, other traders and even pirates joined the A merican war effort. When the participation of the French merchants beca me known among the merchant underground, the Dutch were quic k to follow. As a nation they had lost their command of the seas an d their colonies to the English. The Crommelin House of Amsterdam was m ore than happy to tweak the nose of the English king and mak e a profit secur- ing gunpowder for the Americans. 12 To maintain the appearance of neutrality, Dutch ships sailed directly to the tiny island of Saint Eustatius, where they would unload their cargoes of ammunition and tea for the American ships. When British ships post ed themselves in the Netherlands' waters and British spies uncovered the ir mercantile plots, the Dutch used Portugal as a go-between. Goods were shipped to Portugal and then reshipped to the Caribbean. The B ritish soon under- stood the problem, but they had no solution. Rather than risk a further breach in relations and face a war at home, they sa t back and watched as Dutch ships were repainted, changed flags, and t ransported their car- goes to the Americans. The British had larger problems than stopping the t rade; the coun- try was concerned about the revolution and the war spreading to other colonies. It may have been only the relative distan ce from the original American colonies to some of England's other coloni es that kept the revolution from spreading.

Masonry provided the protecti on of a wide-ranging brotherhood. To be able to make connections in the far-flung islands from Bermuda to Barbados, a ship's captain or merch ant needed to connect to those he could trust.

THE TUCKER CLAN The history of Bermuda is very much linked with Ame rican history. Discovered first by the Spanish in 1503, the Isles of the Devil, as they were called by Juan de Bermudez, remained unsettled for a hundred years. King James I awarded a land grant to the isl ands to the Virginia Company. In 1612 a group of sixty Englishmen became the first set- tlers. From the earliest days of settlement the eco nomy was based on smuggling and piracy, tobacco trading and whaling. Freemason lodges on Bermuda recently celebrated their two-hundred-ye ar anniversary, but the craft was established on the island for at least fifty years before the Lodge Saint George officially received its warr ant in August 1797. The Earl of Strathmore, the grand master of the Eng lish lodges, had appointed a provincial grand master for the islands around 1544. Lodge Saint George is, however, the oldest continually wo rking Scottish lodge operating outside of Scotland. The prevalence of Ma sonry is visible even today where the Customs House at Saint George resembles a Masonic temple more than an official government bui lding. With an estimated one third of all trade in colonia l Bermuda con- sidered smuggling, it was no small wonder that very strong connections existed between the American colonies and Bermuda. In 1775 a small delegation from Bermuda attended the Continental Co ngress in Philadelphia. Bermuda remained loyal to the crown, but that did not stop the residents from providing assistance.

The Tucker dynasty traces its history from the Norman invasion of William the Conqueror. Seven hundred years later, as Britain expanded its role in the Ne w World, the clan again played a role in the invasion. The Tuckers landed i n Charleston, South Carolina,Virginia, and Bermuda, where they rose to power and privilege. Colonel Henry Tucker was the agent for Bermuda duri ng the American Revolution. In July 1775 the Continental C ongress gave permission to trade foodstuffs for gunpowder. Washi ngton told the con- gress that his army would desperately need the gunp owder, while resi- dents of Bermuda desperately needed food. In August of the same year two patriot ships rendezvoused with Colonel Tucker' s men. The Bermudians helped the Americans break into their ow n Fort William to steal one hundred barrels of gunpowder, which we re quickly loaded on Bermuda whale ships and then transferred to Amer ican ships. The gunpowder thieves were never apprehended, as Englan d was afraid the populace was looking for an excuse to join the Amer ican cause. It also helped that Colonel Tucker's son was the governor o f Bermuda, and despite his potentially treasonous actions, he rema ined governor well after Britain lost her colonies. In addition, the g randson of Colonel Tucker, Henry St. George, became the chairman of th e British East India Company. During the Revolution, American diplomat Silas Dean e had rec- ommended that the island of Bermuda be used as a su pply port and a harbor that could keep America's very small navy pr ovisioned and pro- tected. In exchange, the Bermudians would receive f ood. The island provided the Americans with fast ships made of Berm uda cedar. St. George Tucker was a Virginia relative of the Tu cker clan with strong business ties to the island, and he suggested a tak eover of Bermuda to George Washington in 1780. 13 St. George would serve at Yorktown as interpreter for Rochambeau; his help was apparently more valuable off the battlefield, however, where the French commande r needed help in meeting women.

The Tucker House in Saint George, which was named for Henry Tucker, the colonial trea surer and Governor's Council president who purchased it in 17 75, is a part of the Bermuda National Trust and a current tourist attrac tion. The Tuckers' prestige and connections helped them to survive alm ost any scandal. \"India Henry,\" as Henry St. George Tucker was known , spent six months in jail for an \"attempted rape\" committed wh ile he was chair- man of the British East India Company. 14 John Randolph, the son of the prominent Virginia st atesman (also named John), and his wife, Nancy, were charged with the murder of their infant child. Related to the Tucker clan, the y too had the charm of surviving any scandal. The Randolph \"dream team\" of lawyers included Patrick Henry, Alexander Campbell, and Joh n Marshall. 15 The Randolphs were acquitted of the murder. In America the Tuckers married well. In 1778 St. Ge orge Tucker married the widow of John Randolph (of the Jefferso n-Randolph clan). He received 1,300 acres on the Appomattox Ri ver. Ann Tucker married Lyon Gardiner Tyler, son of the president a nd heir to the own- ers of the pirate refuge at Gardiner's Island.

For example, Nathaniel Beverly Tucker, serving as t he U.S. consul in Liverpool, used his office to start constructing Co nfederate ships for use against the government that paid him.

Of questio nable morals and unquestionably law breakers, many of these men were at least as cor- rupt as those they fought against.

Men like Sam Adams, George Washington, and Patrick Henr y would risk life, liberty, and property for the cause, but the motiva tions of others were not as pure. When war with England became a reality , many American merchants lined up to make their fortunes. People w ho built fortunes from the importation of arms and supplies included New York's Livingston clan, Marblehead's Elbridge Gerry, Phila delphia's Stephen Girard, Boston's Thomas Cushing, and Virginia's Ben jamin Harrison. 1 Benjamin Franklin put together what became known as the Secret Committee. Gaining an appointment to it was getting a license to steal, or at least to overcharge. The Secret Committee was supplied with an immense amount of funds from the newly formed Congr ess, and it was made up of merchants who knew the ropes and were no t above break- ing the laws for their own gain. These men were res ponsible for keep- ing the colonies supplied. The first chairman of th e Secret Committee was the business partner of Robert Morris, Thomas W illing. The first contract went to his own firm, which raised an outc ry from the other merchants and members of the new Congress. Despite the criticism Morris, at age forty-one, bec ame the greatest supplier of military goods in the war. He was born in Liverpool, the son of a Chesapeake merchant.

The partners both had reputations for being clever and honest, as smuggling was not considered a dishonest act. While Franklin realized that the combination of the firm's experience in the Caribbe an trade and their network of agents around the world made Willing and Morris capable of transacting the business, Congress estimated tha t the firm would be making an exorbitant gain at the same time. Morris, in fact, wrote to an associate remarking that he stored powder until pri ces improved before delivering it to Congress. 2 Merchants did not see any moral dilemma in making a profit while defending the country. It did not help that the very first assignment went badly. The com- missioned ship, the Lion, reportedly could not find any goods to be bought in Europe and returned empty It was highly s uspicious that a seasoned captain would return with an empty hold fr om such a long voyage. Morris offered to return the thirty thousan d pounds sterling (eighty thousand American dollars) advanced by the Congress, but instead a new assignment was given. 3 The second assignment went better. Ammunition and p owder were bought in England, shipped to Saint Eustatius, and then sent to the colonies. The firms taking the contracts were entit led to 2 1/2 percent on both the exported goods and the imported supplies. It was actually a very small commission considering the risk that the ship's owners were taking. This did not stop the committee from handin g the contracts to their own firms, to friends, and to family. Robert Morris was quick to learn which angles could maximize profits and minim ize losses—such as shipping the firm's goods alongside goods that C ongress was paying for aboard American warships. Morris and Willing ar e not on record as ever having paid the freight for their company's ex ports of indigo and rice to France.

Congress would soon come around to accept Morris as the best man it had. It comes as no surprise that other members of the c ommittee, which included Silas Deane of Connecticut and Rober t R. Livingston, John Alsop, John Dickinson, and Francis Lewis of Ne w York, gave the assignments to themselves or to friends. The Browns of Providence increased their slave-trading fortune by war profit eering. Samuel Otis, Thomas Cushing, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts also partici- pated in profiteering. Arthur Lee, a Virginia plant er, was the biggest critic of the commercial side of arms procurement, in part because he mistrusted merchants. His brother William, however, took part in the double-dealing with speculations of his own. But th e greatest amount of mud being slung at the profiteers was directed a t Silas Deane. DEANE AND LAFAYETTE Silas Deane was born in 1737 in Groton, an early se aport town on Long Island Sound. His father was a blacksmith. Deane, h owever, managed to put himself through Yale and was admitted to the ba r. Teaching school in Hartford while also practicing law, Deane's care er path took a dra- matic turn when he settled the estate of Joseph Web b. Whether it was opportunity or love, the young lawyer met and marri ed Webb's wealthy widow, Mehitabel. Her family was active in the West Indies trade, and Deane gave up teaching and the law. Instead he bega n making voyages to the West Indies and learning the trade. After hi s first wife died, he married Elizabeth Saltonstall, the granddaughter of a governor and daughter of a general. While her family had also be en active merchants, their political influence was greater and the oppor tunist Deane went into politics. A member of the new Congress and a m erchant, Deane was in the right place at the right time to get ass ignments as a muni- tions supplier. When Deane lost his congressional seat because of a dispute with fellow Connecticut delegate Roger Sherman, Deane's close friend Morris found a better assignment for him: He went t o Europe as an"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The Merchants of War 139 envoy to the French and a merchant, and his mission was to enlist the French in the American cause, or at least to procur e supplies for the war. By some accounts Deane exaggerated his accompl ishments with the French, but he did well in the war supplies dep artment, where he was entitled to a 5 percent commission. At home his enemies grew and Congress not only failed to pay his commissions but also charged him with misappropriating funds. His letters to a Briti sh correspondent sug- gesting a negotiated settlement of the war earned h im the accusation of treason. When Deane finally left Europe to return h ome, he was gripped with a violent abdominal attack that led to his death within hours. It was believed that he was poisoned by the British double agent Dr. Edward Bancroft. Whatever truth is in the accusations of Deane's det ractors, he deserves credit as well. Early in the war Deane con tracted for thirty thousand rifles, four thousand tents, thirty mortar s, and clothing for the troops. He was responsible for the introduction of more than one young French aristocrat to the American cause. One of Con gress's problems with Deane was his giving of contracts to French of ficers who desired high ranks and believed they were getting them by e nlisting in the American cause. One such officer was Marie-Joseph-P aul-Yves-Roch- Gilbert du Motier, the Marquis de Lafayette. Born i n 1757, Lafayette's father was killed in the battle of Minden at the ag e of twenty-seven by a battery commanded by the English general Phillips . Lafayette was only two at the time, but he was destined to get re venge. Twenty-two years later he commanded a battery in Richmond, Vir ginia, and bombed a house where General Phillips reposed. 4 The future major general was raised by his mother a nd grandfather, but they too met an early demise when Lafayette was thirteen. He was, however, one of the wealthiest men in France and ha d advisers who looked after his numerous holdings. At fourteen he was committed to an arranged marriage with his 12 1/2-year-old cousi n, Marie Adrienne d'Ayen de Noailles, and they soon set up home in Pa ris.

Lafayette and his brother-in-law, the Viscount of Noailles, met for d inner in August 1775 with the Duke of Gloucester, who was the brother of King George III. In a candid moment the duke announced that the insu rgency in America could actually escalate and provoke France to start new hos- tilities against England. The marquis and the visco unt called on a third relative, the comte of Segur, who married into the d'Ayen family, with their plan to join in the fray. The trio, dubbed th e Three Musketeers by their family, quickly rushed to the home of Silas D eane to enlist. The young marquis had the rank of captain of the re serves when he sailed to America. Described as an overgrown boy stuffed into a handsome uniform, he was pudgy, red-haired, and alr eady balding and had a long nose. He supposedly proclaimed, \"The mom ent I heard of America, I loved her; the moment I heard she was fi ghting for freedom, I burned with desire of bleeding for her.\" Such sen timent, as well as a shipload of munitions and supplies, endeared him to Congress and especially to General Washington. Washington and Co ngress may have also been endeared to the family that Lafayette bro ught with him: His brother-in-law, Viscount Louis-Marie de Noailles, a lso came to the colonies and was second in command to one of France 's legendary fighting units, the Soissonnais. Lafayette was comm issioned a major general, one of the highest ranks in the Continenta l army. When he was wounded at Brandywine, Washington instructed the su rgeon, \"Treat him as if he was my son.\" 5 The meeting of Washington and Lafayette began a lon g friendship, and Washington lived to repay the favors. When the marquis's ideas on liberty and equality backfired in a faction-driven madness that is called the French Revolution, only funds from America boug ht Lafayette's release from prison. Although Lafayette served with distinction and earn ed the respect of the regiment he was given to command, not all su ch foreign volun- teers were welcomed.

Even biographer Samuel Eliot Morison points out that Craik's activi ties \"suggested\" Jean's relationship with him was as more than house keeper. 6 From birth a cloud hung over John Paul because of his un clear parentage. At age fourteen he started his career aboard a ship en gaged in the Barbados trade of rum, sugar, and humans. By age seventeen h e was a third mate on a blackbirder, the term for a slave ship, having proved himself able at sea. He would sail aboard slavers for another two y ears before quitting the \"abominable\" trade. It was not as much the mora lity that assaulted his sensibilities as it was the smell. A slave-trad ing ship that confined sometimes hundreds of men and women in its hold wit hout sanitary facilities could be smelled for miles away. Upon sailing home from Kingston, Jamaica, the maste r and mate of Paul's ship died, so he brought back the ship on hi s own. In doing so he earned the appointment of master, a great achiev ement at the early age of twenty-one. Paul did all he could to live th e part. He tried to drop his rural Scottish accent and he learned to re ad and write well— in fact, better than his peers. He dressed the part of an officer and sought out the company of other officers. He also e nforced discipline. At five foot five inches tall, command did not alwa ys come easy for Paul.

Again Paul was cleared, but he came t o understand the value of connections. Within days of his release from the Tolbooth jail, Paul applied and was accepted to the Saint Bernard Lodge of Freemaso ns in Kirkcudbright. As a member of that lodge, he was we lcome to visit and sometimes find accommodations in other lodges aroun d the world. He also made connections in the lodges that would adva nce his career and even save his life. Three years later, Paul was again charged with murd er. His version was that the leader of a mutinous crew was about to hit him with a club when he ran the man through with his sword. The inc ident occurred on Tobago, where the small population of whites was mostly Scottish and the lieutenant governor was a friend. However, the young captain chose to flee. He disappeared for two years and the n turned up in Virginia with the new surname Jones. Most likely he hid in Edenton, North Carolina, where he had a hometown friend, Rob ert Smith. He then moved to Virginia, where Robert's brother Jame s, also from Kirkcudbright, was a shipowner and an officer in th e local Masonic lodge.

BENJAMIN HARRISON Benjamin Harrison was a Virginia aristocrat whose f amily had pros- pered most likely from both being politically conne cted and being one of the first families in Virginia. From 1632, when the first Harrison landed, the family was represented in Virginia's go vernmental body, the House of Burgesses, By the time of the Revolution t he Harrisons' property, called the Berkeley Hundred, was a kingdo m within the state.

In 1776, with the war just starting, Harrison the p lanter and Willing and Morris the merchant traders bought most of the American tobacco crops. The prices were low because everyone believe d shipping the product to Britain for sale would be impossible at a time when a war was happening. But Morris and Harrison understood t hat at the same time that prices were falling in Virginia they were rising in England.

Morris hired ships from New England, Dea ne insured them, remarkably, in London, and they set sail. They did not have to go far; the free-trade market in Saint Eustatius was the ma rket. This helped make Morris extremely rich during a time when he wa s competing against the Secret Committee, on which he served. 8 Harrison fathered seven children, including William Henry Harrison, who became the ninth president. William's record in the War of 1812 and the family's patrician status helped hi m gain notice. The publicity surrounding his involvement in the small skirmish called Tippecanoe might have gotten him elected, but Harri son wasn't really a war hero. He had marched his thousand-man force a gainst a Shawnee village half the size in a punitive measure. Despit e his force being twice the size and his army losing more men in battle tha n did the Shawnee, Harrison claimed victory. The media took his word f or it, and he was considered a hero. His campaign for the presidency was not going so well until he came to Richmond on a stop. There a p ickpocket being hauled off to jail yelled \"Tippecanoe and Tyler too ,\" which became Harrison's campaign slogan. Harrison was soon elect ed America's shortest- term president. 9 Harrison's administration lasted only one month, as he became the first of two presidents to cross the Cotton Whigs.

In a time when and a place where merchant shipping paved the way t o wealth, Gerry's father was a wealthy and politically active merchan t shipper. His mother was the daughter of a British merchant. Marblehead was known more as a fishing port, and a great deal of the Gerry bu siness was shipping codfish to Barbados to be used as food for the newl y imported slaves. Before the war Marblehead rivaled Salem in importan ce, and Gerry was one of its richest citizens. As a man of wealth who was dependent on trade, lega l or other- wise, Gerry did not agree with the growing anti-Bri tish feeling build- ing in Boston. He was outraged by the Boston Tea Pa rty and left his low-level political job as a result. Under the infl uence of Sam Adams, however, Gerry returned to politics. But like Hanco ck, his motives were often designed to increase his pocketbook. He serve d as the chairman of the Committee of Supply, a post that suited him perfectly. In addi- tion, he sat on a congressional board that regulate d finances. When Congress was stingy in doling out money to supplier s like Gerry, he walked out. He became considered the \"soldier's fri end\" for his demands for better equipment and supplies, although he did nothing in the debate for soldiers' pensions. During the war G erry could not have been luckier. The British closed the harbor of Bost on, yet somehow they left Marblehead alone. Marblehead's importance soared as patriots around the colonies donated goods for Boston and Ge rry shipped them. Haughty and aristocratic, Gerry was never popular a mong the"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The Merchants of War 147 Massachusetts voters. His interest had always been in his own wealth and property. The night of the British march agains t Lexington and Concord, Gerry hid in a cornfield in his nightcloth es. Before the Battle of Bunker Hill he tried to persuade Dr. Joseph Warr en, the president of the Provincial Congress, from joining the battle. 10 Warren said to Gerry, \"Dulce et decorum est, pro patria mori,\" meaning \"i t is a sweet and glori- ous day to die for one's country.\" Warren then went to his death. Gerry didn't. Although he was publicly for independence, Gerry ha d his doubts about signing the Declaration. Benjamin Harrison jo ked with Gerry about the danger of signing, saying his own weight would ensure a quicker death at the gallows than the slender Gerry 's. 11 Gerry may have taken this to heart, as he was absent when the Decl aration was signed; he put his signature on the document months later. Gerry's strongest effort in the Provincial Congress was getting the C ongress to issue let- ters of marque. This allowed shipowners like him to legally capture British ships and profit from the goods seized. To keep himself and his favorite politicians in off ice, Gerry redrew the lines of various districts to manipulate the ef fect of the vote. One district was drawn to resemble a salamander, and th e term gerrymander entered the vocabulary. THE CUSHING FAMILY The Cushings represented the American aristocracy. Thomas Cushing was an active merchant and a political ally of Sam Adams's father. Cushing, whose nickname was Death's Head, 12 saw no need to separate politics from profit. As a businessman he attempted to serve both \"gods.\" He gathered intelligence information on the Tories but was sometimes reluctant to share it. He was equally rel uctant to elevate the conflict, and checking the \"violent designs of othe rs\" was his goal before the war. The men in charge of supplying the military might t oday be accused of allowing themselves excessive commissions and profits. In the"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"148 The Lodge and the Revolution eighteenth century it was almost expected that thes e men and their friends would use their posts for personal gain. Wh ile Cushing and Gerry made fortunes in the war effort, those who supplied them thought noth- ing of marking up goods 500 percent. The smaller me rchants saw little wrong in selling to the British as well, and in ove rcharging the French, who had entered the war to save the colonists' effo rts. 13 The Cushing clan raised self-interest to the most t reasonous levels. After making profits during the war, the Cushings, led by Caleb Cushing, acted in a step-by-step method to defeat the intere st of the United States and to enrich themselves. Caleb Cushings mentor was John Lowell, who served as an agent for many of the wealthy British forced out of Boston. He would go on to play a leading role in New Englan d's Essex Junto, which attempted to incite the region to secede from the newly formed United States because the merchants did not like th e policies of Jefferson. Shortly after going to work for Lowell, Cushing mar ried the daughter of a leading member of the secessionist movement. Cushing became a power broker and apparently would stop at nothing to turn a profit. He was a one-man Masonic conspiracy. As a thirty-third-degree Mason of the Scottish Rite, he used his influence to enrich himself, bring his country to war against Ch ina and Mexico, and finally lead the United States to the breakup of th e Union. Publicly Cushing was an abolitionist, yet at the same time h e fought for the annexation of Texas, which most of the northern sta tes feared would tip the balance in the conflict. Cushing, as a Cott on Whig, saw no prob- lem in a divided Union if trade with England was se cure. That trade depended on cheap cotton as a key export; cheap cot ton depended on cheap labor. Soon after it became obvious that Pres ident Harrison had no intention of furthering the cause of annexation, he was dead. Not everyone believed it was from natural causes. A book titled The Adder's Den was published in 1864 . The author, John Smith Dye, claimed that the agents of the pro- slavery South had poisoned Harrison to put Tyler in the White House. Harrison had been a farmer, had served in the army, had marched throu gh wilderness for months at a time, and had fought as a soldier. It w ould seem unlikely"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The Merchants of War 149 that spending two hours in the rain could lead to h is death. After the suspicious death of President Harrison, the acciden tal president John Tyler appointed Caleb Cushing to be Secretary of th e Treasury. Cushing, however, was not liked or trusted, and the Senate rejected his nomination. Tyler then appointed him as a commissio ner to China. Cushing's family was made wealthy by the opium trad e in China. Shortly after the British began a war against China to impose its right to sell the country opium, Caleb Cushing ordered Am erican ships to enter Canton with guns blazing to further humble Ch ina. His next act was to push for war against Mexico. Admitting Texas and other states to the Union as \"slave states\" helped slavery to conti nue. New England and the Brahmin families depended on the South s ab ility to provide cheap cotton. The cotton could then be spun into te xtiles in New England's mills, of which Lowell was the preeminent force. When support was needed to rally certain Southern s tates against the abolitionist movement, Cushing dispatched other New Englanders to the South. Albert Pike, from Cushing's home base in Newburyport, Massachusetts, was sent to Arkansas. He too would b e raised to the thirty-third degree in the Scottish Rite, and he pl ayed a key role in for- mation of the Ku Klux Klan. Another friend, John Qu itman of New York, was sent to Mississippi, where he started Sco ttish Rite Freemasonry and a secessionist movement. After the war against Mexico, Cushing invited his M exican war generals, including Jefferson Davis, to Massachuset ts, where he informed them that he wanted Franklin Pierce to be president. Zachary Taylor had been the hero of the Mexican War but had alienated the Cotton Whigs by opposing the extension of slavery i nto California. Nevertheless, he was elected. After sixteen months in office, Taylor par- ticipated in the decidedly Masonic dedication of th e obelisk known as the Washington Monument. He allegedly became sick a fter eating cher- ries and drinking milk and died shortly afterward.

Despite the fact that he had planted men i n the South to lead the way to secession, Cushing's duplicity was never enough to keep him out of government. STEPHEN GIRARD Stephen Girard started his career as a pilot of a F rench ship in the Caribbean trade. His first voyage was aboard the Pe lerin to Port-au- Prince in Saint Domingue.This slave port was one of the capitals of the triangle trade. Slaves were brought from Africa to work on the sugar plantations. Sugar was the return cargo, having bee n produced there for almost two hundred years, when the Portuguese built many of the mills. The pilot was the man in charge of the trading, and he was often given carte blanche by the ship's owner to make a profit in any way he could. Selling the sugar to the American colonies brought higher prices because the trade had been outlawed by the British. Girard made six such voyages before being promoted to captain. On his last trading voyage from France he decided h e had done poorly, as commodity prices had dropped. Instead of returni ng to France with a less-than-profitable stake for his backers, he si mply sold the goods and kept the money. With the ill-gotten proceeds he too k on a cargo of sugar and brought it to New York. There he joined T homas Randall in the New Orleans trade, but it was the British block ade that would finally plant Girard in Philadelphia. The City of B rotherly Love was especially warm toward its Masonic brothers, and Gi rard, who had become a Mason in Charleston, quickly joined his ci ty's lodge. The lodge would serve as an old boys' club for merchant s like John Wanamaker and ship captains like Girard. An ugly man with one bad eye, Girard married a penn iless Irish maiden, Mary, at age twenty-seven. Five months into the marriage he caught her cheating with a British colonel. His bro ther visited and left him with a black concubine called Hannah, whom he w ould name in his will. His wife was committed."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The Merchants of War 151 During the Revolution the wealthy merchant and ship owner added to his fortune by acting as a privateer for the Ame rican side while also trading with the British. Girard had taken an oath of allegiance to the colonies, but his allegiance had been first and for emost to himself. His treasonous trade with the British, his participatio n in the slave trade, and his later role in the opium trade made him the four th richest American ever. 14 After the war Girard hired a new eighteen-year-old mistress. His wife, who was still in the asylum, gave birth to a daughter he never would meet. Girard's fortune grew, as he was a pioneer in the C hina trade. Biographer George Wilson says, \"He eventually deriv ed more profits from the China trade than any of those who were in on the ground floor.\" 15 When the British were banned by the Chinese govern ment from smuggling opium into the country, American shi ps such as Girard's took up the trade. Girard raised capital t hrough a British bank- ing house, Baring Brothers, to finance his entry. F rom both legitimate trade and smuggling Girard became one of America's richest men. During the War of 1812 he put up half of the sixtee n million dollars the country needed to get through the conflict, cha rging his country a 10 percent commission. At age seventy-seven Girard hired his fourth and la st live-in maid and mistress. He lived four more years. His will pr ovided generously for those who worked for him; housekeepers, servants, a nd sea captains all received lifetime incomes. Girard's Masonic lodge r eceived twenty thousand dollars.

The American Revolutionary War is an illustrious ta le of victorious moments. The first was the remarkable turning point at Saratoga, which served as the catalyst for bringing in America's po tential allies. The sec- ond was the surprise crossing of the Delaware at Ch ristmas, where the ragtag starving American army defeated the well-tra ined, well- equipped Hessians.

Tories dominated the population of eastern Long Island, where the Br itish army was able to buy cattle.

Despite the state of the economy, the constant defe ats in skirmish after skirmish, and the loss of most of the America n army to disease, cap- ture, and desertion, the outcome of the war was an outstanding victory. The serious student might be led to wonder just how this was possible. There is a third side of the story that might seem even stranger. Sir William Fraser once said, \"The Battle of Waterloo w as won on the playing fields of Eton.\" His statement refers to th e school where England's future leaders were trained. It may be va lid to paraphrase Fraser when discussing how the Revolutionary War wa s won: The bat- tle of Yorktown was lost on the playing tables of a London gambling house known as White's. HIGH SOCIETY IN LONDON At a time where the sun never set on Britain's empi re, London society may have been at its most decadent. It was the larg est city in the world and England, of course, was the master of the ocean . While the poor starved in the streets, the upper crust of society delighted in heavy drinking, wild gambling, practical jokes, and bawdy behavior. As the world's largest port city, there could be as many a s eight thousand ships in the Thames at any one time. The number of drinki ng houses and brothels to serve the thousands of sailors and offi cers was staggering. The upper classes distanced themselves from the low er classes even in partaking of London's vices. From an establishment called Shakespeare's Head, a Covent Garden tavern popular with sea captains and directors of t he British East India Company, John Harris published a list of the better prostitutes and where their services could be found. 1 But for those at the pinnacle of London society, there were gentlemen's clubs. The fashion of eighteenth-century London gentle men was to"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The Bribe That Won the War 155 belong to one or more of the gentlemen's clubs. Man y of them moved from place to place; others were anchored in a spec ific tavern or hall. A handful of the clubs were as spectacular as modern- day casinos, and becoming a member was everything to the aristocrati c class. Almack's, Brooke's, and White's were among the top clubs. Alm ack's had a large ballroom that could accommodate seventeen hundred o f London's fashionable dandies. Gaining admittance was importa nt to London's young social scene, and the Duke of Wellington was once turned away because he arrived in trousers rather than the requ ired knee breeches. Women were admitted at Almack's, and it became a ma rriage mart for London's most eligible. The main attraction of the gentlemen's clubs was ga mbling. At a time when the average wage earner was paid a pound a week, it was not uncommon to see ten thousand pounds sterling on the table. Brooke's and White's were strictly men's clubs, and the chief amusement was gambling. They kept an open betting book where one could wager on anything, and seats at the card tables were occu pied all night. Whist, loo, faro, and hazard were the favorite games, and the size of the wagers ruined many of England's young elite. White's and Brooke's would occasionally attract mem bers divided by politics, and in the years before the American R evolution Brooke's was regarded as a Whig club and White's a Tory club . White's members included the Duke of Devonshire and the Earl of Roc kingham. Brooke's members included Charles James Fox, Lord R obert Spencer, and Sir Joshua Reynolds. Charles Fox may epitomize London's macaronis. Born with the proverbial silver spoon, Fox's wealth brought him e lection to the House of Commons at the age of nineteen. At the time of h is election he was traveling throughout the Continent, so he did not s uffer the boredom of a campaign. In fact, according to his own letter s, he was laid up with a bout of the clap in Nice. Back in London, Fox wou ld spend days hop- ping from Brooke's to White's to Almack's to other clubs, where a bad night might cause a loss of ten to fifteen thousand pounds and a good night might see its return."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"156 The Lodge and the Revolution While the Fox family fortune supported such excess, the same could not be said of all of the young dandies who m ade up the Saint James Club scene of London. A massive gambling debt incurred at the gaming tables of White's in London led to the bribe ry of the one man whose role would be so pivotal in the final outcome of the Revolutionary War: Sir George Brydges Rodney. Born into a Somerset family that traced its lineage for twenty gen- erations, Rodney studied at Harrow. Like many other naval command- ers of his day, he left school at an early age, twe lve, to train in the navy. But prestige and profit did not always go hand in h and. An elegant, handsome figure, Rodney was a rake and a gambler wi thout any of the inherited wealth to pay off his losses. The young d andy lost his family's fortune on the playing tables of White's. Even worse than his losses were the debts he incurr ed. Rodney planned to go to sea in order to share in the booty that was promised to the commanders. In one early action in the West Indies he was able to partially repair his finances. While the income bought him time, the sea would disappoint him as much as the gaming tabl es of White's. Rodney spent his remaining funds to get into Parlia ment, but even this campaign failed. His debts were all too often to me n in office, and his connections soon became a detriment to his career. Unable to stay away from White's or regain his fina nces, Rodney was forced to flee London and his creditors. While in exile in France he heard that he had been picked to head the British n avy. But he owed French creditors as well, and was told he would hav e to pay off his debts before he left. The prospects were gloomy indeed. E ven if he found enough money to get out of France, he could still b e thrown in a debtors prison in England before he even saw a wars hip. Taking command of the navy was the light at the end of Rodney's tunnel. In his darkest hour Rodney was approached b y a representative of one of the wealthiest families in France. Rodney would be provided with enough money to satisfy his monumental debts, but what was required for such a favor was equally monumental."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The Bribe That Won the War 157 MASONIC BROTHERS FROM ABROAD The winter of 1777 to 1778 was particularly hard fo r the American army under Washington's command. Many soldiers had little more than blankets to keep out the cold, as their shirts and pants were in tatters. Shoes were a luxury, and many soldiers lost their f eet and legs to the cold. Often those on sentry duty stood in their hat s to keep their bare feet warmer. The food was so scant that the Thanksg iving treat was four ounces of rice cake. 2 At the same time, German farmers in nearby Valley Forge were driving cattle to Philadelphia for the B ritish. Washington himself had to contend with the constant excuses of Congress when he pleaded for food, clothing, funds, and medicine. And a handful called the Conway Cabal plotted against W ashington. The army was undernourished and poorly clad and had bee n forced to retreat from one defeat to another for years. It ap peared that if victory were to be had, it would be a miracle. That miracle finally became a reality with the arrival of assistance from Europe. The efforts of American agents in Europe brought th e French on board as allies. Early in 1778, while Rodney was hi ding in Paris, the French had signed an alliance to join the Americans . They would not actually declare war against England until July, ho wever. One of the first conflicts featured the French navy and the English fleet near the island of Ushant. The two forces were equal, but the Engli sh were used to winning. When the French fleet was forced to retrea t, the two English commanders somehow confused their signals and also retreated. In a move that was very reminiscent of the numerous land battles fought in America, it appeared that the English refused to pr ess the advantage. Because the battle was so close to home for the Eng lish and the fail- ure was so public, the citizens rioted in the stree ts of London and both commanders were court-martialed. Each blamed the ot her for the fail- ure to exact a victory. The English army appeared unable to press its advan tage on land, as well, although the public was less aware of what occurred across the Atlantic. There had been worse blunders. After the war Sir William"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"158 The Lodge and the Revolution Howe, Sir Henry Clinton, and Lord Charles Cornwalli s were blamed for incompetence. The famous story of Howe sipping tea while letting the defeated Continental army escape Long Island is one that most likely plagued him. But Howe was competent. He had served with Amherst, who had taught the American commanders and Howe alike the values of guerrilla fighting. He was a knowledg eable battle-hardened commander who had fought at Montreal, Louisbourg, a nd Quebec before the American Revolution. Howe did make serio us mistakes. He had allowed Washington, whose army spent the night in the rain with- out tents and low on ammunition, to escape Long Isl and. And this was not the last time Howe allowed the American army to escape. He fol- lowed Washington across New Jersey, where desertion s reduced the small force to less than ten thousand. With victory again simply a day away, Howe allowed Washington to cross into Pennsyl vania. When winter came, Howe's army was camped within twe nty-five miles of the Americans, but Howe had no desire to s hiver through win- ter in a camp. Instead he headed back to New York C ity, where his mis- tress, Elizabeth Loring, kept the general warm. Her husband had been sent by Howe to Boston to watch over the prisons. A London newspa- per accusing the general of ineptitude was brought to Howe. He decided to turn in his resignation, and while he wa ited for it to be accepted, he and Loring enjoyed dinners, concerts, and ballroom danc- ing in Philadelphia. When Franklin was asked by the French if Howe had taken Philadelphia, Franklin replied that Phila delphia had taken General Howe. 3 Sir Henry Clinton was a military man as well. He st arted his career at the age of thirteen in the Coldstream Guards, wh ere he was com- missioned as a lieutenant. He also distinguished hi mself in battle and rapidly rose through the ranks to become a major ge neral in 1772. When he took over for Howe, he was more interested in being in New York than in commanding his troops in the field. Af ter the war Clinton was called on to explain his failure as a commander .

With twelve thousand pounds to cover his salary and expenses, Clinton's provision orders included brand y in ten-gallon lots, beef, veal, mutton, fish, sweetbreads, and eggs. 4 He held four houses in New York City, which, he claimed, were used for hid ing because his life was in danger, and he also had a mistress in the ci ty. Cornwallis was a very well-trained military command er born into a wealthy and prestigious family. His grandfather h ad been awarded a baronetcy by Charles II, his father was the first L ord Cornwallis, his mother was the daughter of Lord Townsend and was re lated to Prime Minister Robert Walpole. Charles Cornwallis likely chose the military at an early age. He enrolled at Eton, where the you nger classmen were the object of harsh treatment by older classmates. Cornwallis, a tall man, thrived at Eton and went on to be tutored by a Prus sian officer. He bought an officer's commission in the Grenadiers Gu ards. At age eight- een he took a tour of Europe with his Prussian tuto r and then enrolled in the Military Academy of Turin. It was one of Eur ope's finest, and the young officers combined military strategy with ball room dancing in their curriculum. Over the course of Cornwallis's c areer, his training helped him serve with distinction in the Seven Year s War, in Ireland, and in India. After he married he took a brief respite from the military and enjoyed the estate lifestyle with his bride. He was favored by King George III but at the same time counseled against t he harsh measures exacted by the king against his colonial subjects. Cornwallis's loyalty was never in question, however, and when war broke out he volun- teered for his command against the American rebels. Cornwallis lost heart soon enough. His wife at home in England had taken ill, and his commanders, Clinton and Howe , disappointed him. Cornwallis had outflanked Washington on Long I sland only to watch Howe allow his escape. Cornwallis beat the Am ericans at Brandywine in 1777 and Monmouth in 1778, and was th en sent south. Clinton, with Cornwallis as the field commander, ef fectively stopped the resistance in the South, so Clinton headed for New York, leaving Cornwallis in charge.

Cornwallis's actions in the Revolution did not hurt his career for long, howeve r, and he went on to serve with distinction in India and to quell reb ellion in Ireland. Baigent and Leigh's The Temple and the Lodge examin es how the effect of Mason fighting Mason may have hindered de termination. Howe had served with Amherst, where most of the off icers were broth- ers in the craft. Twenty-nine of the thirty-one reg iments under Amherst's command had field lodges. Cornwallis serv ed in two regi- ments that had military lodges. His brother Edward had served as well, and was the founder of a lodge in Nova Scotia. Clin ton served as aide- de-camp to Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick, one of the most influential Masons of his day. 5 Three seemingly capable British commanders chose to avoid making the coup de grace at every turn, in stead simply con- tinuing the war until, like America's Vietnam War, the soldiers in the field and the citizens back home despaired of ever seeing victory. If conspiracy is the secret behind defeat, then the fi nal battle ofYorktown was the stage. Nevertheless, there is no evidence t hat Cornwallis had planned for anything less than victory.

When the American effort was exhausted, France stepped in to provide most of the troops, the arms, the food, and the money to fi ght the final offen- sive of the war.

All had been enlisted throu gh the diplomatic efforts of Franklin and Deane and had supplied clan destine aid before France officially committed to war with England. Rochambeau and his troops were ferried by seven tra nsport ships to Rhode Island in July 1780. They stayed for a brief time, with the well- funded army enjoying the good life, but they were s hocked with the allies they came to save. The Americans overcharged them for supplies, openly traded with the British who blockaded their coast, and on occa- sion shot at them. The first French troops did not see any action until Yorktown; however, when it came time for action, th e French impressed both the Americans and the English with their order and discipline. 6 General Jean-Baptiste-Donatien deVimeur, the comte de Rocham- beau, was a career military man with a mission. He, like Lafayette and others, wanted to see the rebels break their ties w ith the monarch of England. When the French king Louis XVI signed a tr eaty with the Continental Congress, his first act of assistance w as to supply America. His second was to send over a six-thousand-man army called the Expedition Particuliere under Rochambeau s command. Rochambeau had entered the military at age seventee n and fought at the siege of Maastricht in Holland during the Wa r of Austrian Succession, in a French expedition against Minorca, and during the Seven Years War. Rochambeau was fifty-five when he brought over three regiments to fight the decisive battle at Yor ktown. One unit was the Deux-Ponts. Under the command of Rochambeau, th is thousand- man unit was recruited from Germany. It was a typic al unit in that the officers were often adventurers. Many sailed aboard the French fleet accompanied by their wives and children, and at lea st one officer, Baron Ludwig von Closen, brought his servants. 7 Other military leaders who commanded troops in Amer ica were interested in the social experiment that became a n ew country.

His desire was to be present at the birth of a new age, to fight for the cause of liberty. Like many French nobles, the contradiction of the noble class fighting for democracy did nothing to dim his enthusi- asm. Lauzun was from an ancient family that had tit les from the time of the Crusades. As was tradition in such a titled mil itary family, adventure called first. At age thirteen Lauzun became an ensi gn in the elite French Guard. At eighteen he married into another French r oyal family. Lauzun went to Corsica and proved himself in battle. He wa s rewarded with the title of colonel of the Legion Royale. But peace bo red him, and he was among the first to volunteer to aid the American ca use. Lauzun sailed from France as part of the fighting f orce that joined Rochambeau. Lauzun's cavalry and infantry joined th e ancient regi- ments of the French military, the Bourbonnais, the Deux-Ponts, the Saintonge, and the Soissonnais, and they marched to Yorktown. Lauzun's Legion, as it was called, was made up of m en from vari- ous European countries. Most had come from the Alsa ce-Lorraine cor- ridor between France and Germany; others came from Sweden, Italy, Poland, and Russia. They spoke eight different lang uages, and by tradi- tion they would curse in Hungarian. They were volun teers, and often adventurers; many were from noble families, others were rakes and thieves. They were the predecessors to another Fren ch fighting force, the French Foreign Legion. For the duc de Lauzun, the American Revolution was just one more adventure. His exploits in both the battlefiel d and the boudoirs of Europe were legendary. He was said to have made love to every woman he met in France and Newport, Rhode Island, w here he was first headquartered.

Washi ngton thought that a move to recapture New York would advance the war effort. Rochambeau argued that a decisive victory against t he English in the Chesapeake Bay would end the war. Rochambeau's logi c won, and the focus was turned on beating the one commander who w as a serious contender: Cornwallis. Rochambeau and Washington ma rched to Virginia to catch Cornwallis while both the America ns and the English were depending on the navy to arrive on time. After the Battle of Guilford Courthouse, the forces under Cornwallis's command were low on supplies. At Yorkt own, Cornwallis spent three months digging in while waiting for his rendezvous with Admiral Rodney. The British fleet commanded by Rodn ey was sup- posed to be the most important factor in the outcom e of the show- down between the British army and the combined forc es of the Americans and the French. Supplies and reinforcemen ts were to be brought by Rodney; this was the reason Cornwallis h adn't marched far- ther north. Rodney had other plans.

Lafayette used a small force to block an English retreat, Washington and Rochambeau rushed to cover five hund red miles, and Admiral de Grasse sailed up from the Caribbean with twenty ships and three thousand fresh troops. Francois-Joseph-Paul, the Marquis de Grasse-Tilly a nd Comte de Grasse, had joined the fleet of the Knights of S aint John of Jerusalem, also known as the Knights of Malta, at age twelve. This was the origi- nal order known as the Hospitallers of Saint John o f Jerusalem, and was established even before the Knights Templar. While both orders were ostensibly Catholic, the exposure to different fait hs may have had a last- ing effect on the Templars, who supported the Catha ri during the papal crusade and were accused of heresy. The Hospitaller s had no such cri- sis of faith, but they needed a reason to exist aft er the Crusades. They took refuge in the Mediterranean, where they waged endless wars against the Barbary pirates to protect Christian sh ipping. After six years of training, de Grasse was attached to the French navy. Like his fellow Knights of Malta, de Grasse h ad an interest in the American cause of liberty. He was joined by ninetee n other knights in the effort. After the war, fourteen joined Washingt on's Society of Cincinnati. 8 Admiral de Grasse became part of the French Revolu tion, retiring when the excessive bloodshed stained the c ause of liberty. Admiral de Grasse had overnight become a key figure in the Revolutionary War. 9 With a fleet of twenty ships, he sailed from Franc e in March. His fleet, including the Ville de Paris, the largest warship in the world, guided a convoy of 150 merchant ships ca rrying supplies for the war. De Grasse reached Martinique in late April and sent thirty ships with troops and supplies to Rochambeau. The r esupply included the infantry of Marquis Claude-Henri de Saint-Simon , and the ancient regiments of Agenais, Gatinais, and Touraine. De Gr asse's fleet found action almost immediately after landing the merchan t ships. In late April, de Grasse encountered the British na vy. This first brief action was later described as indecisive, but the B ritish lost six warships, which had a lasting effect.

Five weeks later Rodney again ran into the French f leet. On June 5 Rodney's navy reached the French fleet, counted twe nty-four ships and five frigates, and chose to do nothing. Rodney had the advantage of size, yet he failed to pursue de Grasse, allowin g the French admiral to head north to Virginia. But Rodney was aware of the crucial impor- tance of French naval and military support in deter mining the outcome at Yorktown. Still, he failed to give priority to s topping or even slowing the French assistance. The most critical engagement of the war was decided on which side was more prepared for the bat tle. The American and French side needed Admiral de Grasse; the Briti sh side needed Admiral Rodney. There is ample evidence that both n aval commanders were aware of their importance. Admiral de Grasse was scheduled to rendezvous with thirty American pilots who were necessary for navigating C hesapeake Bay. De Grasse supplied his food stores in a hurry and c hartered fifteen new merchant ships to carry food. Not wishing to wait f or letters of credit, he paid for the supplies with his own money. While it seems that Rodney had failed to understand the implica- tions of his delay, his actions prove otherwise. He dispatched a warning to Admiral Graves in New York, stating that the Fre nch navy was on the way. He told Graves that both fleets needed to link up to prevent the French navy from supplying Rochambeau and Washingto n.

Historians have pointed out that Rodney's errors ma y have been attributable to problems with his health. But the t rue cause of the vic- tory at Yorktown is that Admiral Rodney allowed him self to be defeated on purpose. In doing so, he ensured the French-Amer ican victory, which was allowed to repay a monumental debt. THE MOTIVE As mentioned earlier, in 1774 Rodney fled to Paris to escape debtors prison. 10 The gambler was still in Paris in 1778 and still a n admiral, though he did not have a post. Rodney had been put on a half salary by his superior, the Earl of Sandwich. The Earl of Sandwich, when not at the gambling tables himself, served as Lord of t he Admiralty. The earl was also a friend of Benjamin Franklin's through th eir shared adventures at Wycombe. After nearly four years in exile, Rodney was inform ed that he was being recalled to active duty. It was an opportunit y to rebuild his for- tune and his career, but because of new debts incur red in France, the down-and-out admiral could not return to England to accept his com- mand. Even worse, he could not rebuild his fortune without the com- mand. Then, seemingly out of the blue, a French noble and commander of the French Guard offered to help Rodney. The Marech al duc de Biron offered Admiral Rodney the money needed to pay off his debts and assume his command. Some historians call it a loan; others call it a gift. In either case, the implications are staggering. It seems that at least one of the two parties was c ommitting an act that could be deemed treason. While Rodney's reason s were evident, one must wonder, What was the French commander's mo tivation? When the offer was made, the duc de Biron's nephew was Armond Louis de Gontaut, the duc de Lauzun. It is unreason able to think that the duc de Biron actually wished to help Rodney tak e his post; in doing so the duke would be aware that he might be contrib uting to his"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"The Bribe That Won the War 167 nephew's defeat or even death. Apparently the well- timed loan or gift to Rodney was the one way the duc de Biron could en sure his nephew's success. The loan was a bribe. And that br ibe won the war. Rodney upheld his part of the bargain. When he coul d have pur- sued the advantage, he chose to wait. When he could have stopped the French fleet, he chose to defend Tobago. When he co uld have raced to Yorktown, he decided it was time to punish Saint Eu statius. Finally, he simply headed home. THE WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN Rochambeau and Washington continued to tighten the siege around Yorktown. Lafayette had been reinforced with the fr esh troops of Saint- Simon. Meanwhile, four thousand British troops sat in New York Harbor and Rodney's partner Graves waited. When Rod ney's message arrived, the Brits set sail. It was then two days a fter the surrender at Yorktown; when the British fleet was informed of Co rnwallis's defeat, they simply turned around. After losing the war, Britain would go through a lo ng series of blaming people. While others pointed their fingers at their fellow com- manders, Rodney seemed above the fray. The reason w as that before any charges of incompetence, cowardice, or treason coul d be leveled against him, he returned to the West Indies to become a her o. Despite the surprising victory at Yorktown, it woul d still be more than a year before Britain ended the hostilities. C linton in New York still had a standing army during this lull, and Rod ney returned to pur- sue the French fleet. He sighted the French fleet u nder de Grasse sail- ing for Jamaica; the same French commander that he avoided meeting prior to Yorktown he now chased. For three days Rod ney followed the French fleet until he was in position in the passag e between Dominica and Guadeloupe known as the Saints.

But this was against the Fighting Instructions, the British navy's rules of engagemen t, and it was a gamble that could result in a court-martial or even a firi ng squad if it failed. Rodney was not even sure his captains would follow such an order. Years of gambling, however, inspired Rodney to take such a great bet, and he won. Five ships followed him and he cir cled several French ships to fire upon them from both sides. His other captains also exploited gaps in the French line. Even the Ville d e Paris, the world's largest fighting ship, was overtaken, abandoned by its crew, and set on fire by the British. Of course, this had no effect on the outcome of the war in the colonies. It did serve to make Rodney a hero, however, and so his motives would not be challenged after the wa r. The deal made between the duc de Biron and the inde bted Admiral Rodney worked out very well for both men. Admiral R odney had his fortune back, and despite abandoning Cornwallis at Yorktown, Rodney was still regarded as a war hero for the naval batt le he chose to win. The duc de Biron's nephew was safe, for the time being, and was now re- garded as a hero in a war against England. However, the duc de Lauzun's status would not save him from the terrors of the F rench Revolution. He would go to the guillotine, but not before offer ing his executioner a glass of wine.

The new nation then turned to winning the pe ace. From the very beginning of American history it was evident that a handful of Masons would exert a powerful influence both in the open and in secret. The Declaration of Independence was drawn up by the non-Mason Thomas Jefferson. It was first signed by a Mason, John Hancock, and on its first vote on July 1, 1776, the document was approved by nine of the states—a clear majority. Th e next day the vote reached twelve, with the New York delegation not vo ting. (John Adams had predicted that July second would forever be cel ebrated as the day of independence for the American colonies.) On the fou rth New York voted and the Declaration was signed by the preside nt and the secretary of Congress, not by Hancock or any of the other fif ty-six signers, which would come later. When the Declaration was signed, up to forty-one of the signers were Masons, even though not all of the se Masons were pub- licly acknowledged as such. Among Masons July 4 was held as a sacred day. It marked the rising of Sirius, which in ancie nt religions was related to the god Thoth, who brought knowledge to man.

The Founding Fathers, however, had ambiguous feelings toward the secret societies that spread these philosophies. Washington was know n never to will- ingly promote a non-Mason in the military, but John Adams, on the other hand, wrote several anti-Masonic tracts. Adam s believed Masonry was one of the greatest moral and political evils, and regarded it as a conspiracy of the few against the many. 2 Jefferson was not a Mason, although his attendance at Masonic meetings has been documented. There is some evidenc e of his flirtation with Rosicrucianism, including some Rosicrucian cod es that were found among his writings. 3 There is stronger evidence that Franklin was connected to the Rosicrucian group that was centere d in Germantown, Pennsylvania. And certainly there is no shortage of evi- dence of Franklin's numerous Masonic affiliations. Of the forty men who signed the Constitution, many were already Masonic brothers and others would become Masons aft erward. Masonic lodges claim that nearly all the signers at least participated in lodge activities, but most historians agree that se veral were not Masons, including Madison and Jefferson. The Illuminati group was the most secretive and pos sibly the most conspiratorial entity in Europe, but members did no t make headway in the colonies the way the Masons did. Washington spo ke out against that group, condemning them as \"self-created\" and unrela ted to Freemasonry. 4 But Washington could trace his own family's aristo cratic roots, and despite his efforts on behalf of a democ racy, he was an elitist who would create the Society of the Cincinnati, whi ch admitted only those with aristocratic backgrounds.

Ye t another Freemason, General Morgan Lewis, was Washington's e scort. Washington, the master of the Alexandria lodge, too k his oath of office on the Bible from Saint John's Lodge of New York. 5 THE NEW ORDER OF THE AGES Soon the nation's new capital was laid out. The loc ation was in a wilderness more suited for hunting grouse than for administering the new country, but it had its advantages. Washington feared that New York would serve as a bad example and allow the money me n like Hamilton to control the country, and he did not want to plac e the capital there. 6 Jefferson enjoyed the proximity of the new capital to Virginia. The city was blueprinted in a Masonic plan, designed by the French Mason Pierre-Charles L'Enfant, who had volunteered to fig ht for liberty. He was close to Washington and a member of the Society of the Cincinnati. The ceremony commemorating the laying o f the Capitol's cornerstone was strictly a Masonic event. Washingto n served as master, wearing the apron and sash of his lodge. Members fr om lodges all over Maryland and Virginia were in attendance and accord ingly dressed in Masonic regalia. The ceremony itself was a Masonic ritual performed with baptism by corn, wine, and oil to signify nour ishment and refresh- ment. Masons were also called on to design, plan, a nd build university buildings, state houses, bridges, and war memorials , which they then consecrated with their corn, oil, and wine blessing . 7 The Capitol building and the east-west axis of the new city were oriented in a complicated way to correspond with th e arc of the sun.

Two new design committees would be employed before the designs wer e acceptable to all. The final Great Seal is also full of arcane sy mbolism. The bald eagle is said to represent Scorpio, who is associated with death and rebirth. The eagle holds a scroll that de picts the thirteen- letter motto E pluribus unum, meaning \"one out of m any.\" Some believe this motto represents one nation arising from the t hirteen colonies, but others believe that it refers to the concept of one God over all gods— a Masonic tenet.

Its face has seventy-two bricks, representa tive of another num- ber that is sacred in religious writings from the R ig Veda to works of the Babylonian Berosus to the Finnish Kalevala. The pyr amid without its cap is said to be the loss of wisdom by humanity becaus e of the long reign of the Church over knowledge. This symbol first app eared on colonial money.

A MASONIC FAITH There are numerous claims regarding just how many o f America's Founding Fathers were actually Masons. Washington a nd Franklin were documented and active members of Masonic organizati ons, while Jefferson and Adams were not. They all shared a com mon belief, how- ever—a variation of faith known as deism. Adherents of deism believed that a superior power c reated the world and established nature as his law. Masons bel ieved the supreme power was the great architect of the world, and his law was reflected in and revealed by science. The G symbol, which is so often debated, may simply be representative of the science of geometry . Deists, especially the eighteenth-century followers, held in contempt the wars between Christians in which people were killed over minor p oints of doctrine. Men of science, treated with suspicion by the Churc h, also held dear the respect Masonry held for science. This new reli gion, the deist reli- gion of the Masons, found a conciliation between Go d and science, and the G symbol was revered as a sign of this progress . The ranks of American Revolutionaries that held dei st beliefs included George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thom as Jefferson, Thomas Paine, Ethan Allen, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Quincy Adams. 12 Paine was one of the most outspoken, and his Age of Reason is an anti-Church treatise. Washingto n attended the Episcopal Church but usually left before the commun ion. Jefferson regarded Christianity as a tyranny over the mind of man.

Although Franklin still called fo r prayer at the Constitutional Convention and Hamilton opposed it, both were Masons. Masonry allowed its members to transcend th e divisions of religious pettiness and unite with each other. At t he same time, there was a dark side to Masonry. Like organized religion, Masonry preached equality and practiced elitism. The American government itself was formed not so much as a democracy as a hierarchal organization that could b ar representation. For example, the right to vote was typically limite d to men of property. Those \"inalienable rights\" declared in 1776 were no t a desire of all people. When Thomas Jefferson and George Mason push ed for a Bill of Rights for individuals, they had to overcome the st aunch opposition of men such as the elitist Alexander Hamilton. George Mason believed slavery to be a crime and an abomination, but there were many opposed to any attempt at ending that institution. But Maso n was joined by Virginians Richard Henry Lee and James Madison in o verriding Hamilton, and the Bill of Rights was accepted. Masonry had been born in the feudal Dark Ages when a small por- tion of the population had life-and-death control o ver the people in their realm. Liberty and equality were ideals that were not always shared by those higher up the food chain. The great Americ an gamble achieved a result that somehow eluded countries tha t chose to follow its example. Writers like Franklin and Jefferson had seemingly d eclared that challenging government by violent means was accepta ble. Revolts ignited throughout Europe and South America and wer e mostly led by Masons. In some countries, new republics were forme d quickly and without violence, such as in the Netherlands, in Sw itzerland, and among the various states of Italy. In Italy, the grand ma ster and thirty-third- degree Mason Giuseppe Garibaldi fought to unify Ita ly and place another Mason, Victor Emmanuel II, on the throne. 13 In Russia Freemasons were the primary leaders of the Decembri st Revolt, which was planned in Masonic lodges.

The company played a role in establishing the Providenc e Bank, which allowed it to finance its own ships, and out of thi s institution the mod- ern Fleet Bank, one of the country's largest banks, developed. The Brown family began its ascent to fame and fortu ne in the New England whaling business, in which ships sometimes had to be out at sea for years with the goal of transforming whales into spermaceti can- dles. Needing funds for his business, Nicholas Brow n fitted out the first Guineaman—a name given to mean a slave ship trading with Africa— the Mary, for the slave trade. In 1736 his son Obad iah Brown signed on as the supercargo, or head trader, on what would be come Providence's first venture into the slave-trading business. Obad iah soon came into his own and fitted out another ship, the Wheel of Fortu ne, to join in the trade. The young man then brought the entire family into the business and developed a colony-wide reputation. Virginia pl anters like Revolutionary War statesman Carter Braxton wrote to the company requesting to participate in a joint venture with t he Browns. 3 For the Browns, wealth led to greater power, and Jo hn Brown became a congressman representing Rhode Island; fel low slave trader James De Wolf represented the state as a senator.

NEW ENGLAND AND THE SLAVE TRADE There are many secrets surrounding the slave trade. The profits from dealing in human cargo built a great deal of Americ an, and particularly New England, industry. The trade brought together a handful of tightly knit families bound by Masonic ties and intermarria ge. The same fam- ilies still have inherited fortunes and inherited p ower that dominate the economic landscape. While being a Mason was often a necessity to get hired by a shipowner or a shipbuilder, the lodges t hat the workers were welcomed into were not the same as the lodges that the owners joined. An elite layer had once again risen to the top of s ociety, just as it had in the feudal period. The French Normans did not invent the feudal system . The elite"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"The Slave Traders 183 Normans, however, did thrive by controlling every a spect of the econ- omy. They exported this type of economy to England, Scotland, and Ireland, where Norman overlords impoverished and ev icted entire pop- ulations in order to establish their estates. They brought the feudal economy to Italy as well, where Norman armies had w reaked more havoc than the Celts had a thousand years before. T he same Norman families that had amassed huge estates had created the Knights Templar, which became Freemasonry. Yet liberty and fraternit y within the organ- ization had its bounds; membership in the powerful lodges was centered first on the aristocracy, and only when industrial society replaced the feudal economy would a professional class come to p ower within the organization. The rank-and-file trade lodges, in tu rn, remained at lower levels in both public society and Masonic society. Entry into the upper crust of society could be acco mplished by mar- riage, but more often members of one shipowning fam ily married mem- bers of other shipowning families. Only the captain s of the ships had a chance of being upwardly mobile, as they shared in the profits of their voyages. The captains started as members of the lod ges that included dockworkers, carpenters, wrights, and sailors. Unio ns, which came much later, did not invent the closed shop. The unions, however, built on the concept of the union hall and joined together in qu asi-Masonic groups like the Knights of Labor. Being admitted was the a ll-important first step. Being accepted by the captains who did the hi ring was the next step. For this a laborer had to be considered trust worthy and focused on the goals of the captain and his masters, the shipo wners. The geometric terminology employed by Masons was ju st as important as a secret handshake. Being regarded as \"on-the-level\" or \"on-the-square\" meant that a prospective hire was a lodge member. This showed the owners that they had the employee i n their control as surely as if they were feudal lords in fourteenth-c entury France or Scotland.

Americans today have a particular view of history t hat grants New England the moral high road. The Pilgrim myth tells how the Pilgrims landed, made friends with the Native population, an d soon invited them to celebrate Thanksgiving after a particularly harsh year. The Pilgrim reality was that the Pilgrims landed in the wrong place, fought among themselves, nearly starved to death, and were rescued by a Native population. The Natives—not the savages late r portrayed in books and films—instructed the Pilgrims in the scie nce of agriculture. The survivors then repaid their hosts by subjecting them to a land grab that would not stop until the \"savages\" were confin ed to reservations. The Puritan culture is thought to have steered Amer ica into creat- ing a democracy, but religious freedom and toleranc e were not hall- marks of the early Massachusetts colony. Citizens w ere placed in stocks for dancing, sent fleeing to other areas because of minor religious dif- ferences, and frequently burnt as witches not for a ny religious reason but instead to settle feuds with neighbors. While i t cannot be denied that New England, and, one could argue, Boston, was the cradle of American democracy, the region soon became the high command of the Federalists, who replaced the values of the Rev olution with those of a merchant-class elite that introduced slavery, furthered smuggling, invented child factory labor, and nearly overturned the Bill of Rights in a short-lived attempt to end dissension. The American dream was tarnished by the unbridled p ower and unquenched thirst for money that led those we now c all the Boston Brahmins into slave trading, opium trading, and lab or abuse.

T he same elite class exists today. The basis for many of the fortunes of today's polit ical leaders can be traced to a handful of Founding Fathers. They bu ilt fortunes in crim- inal conspiracies that were as illegal and immoral then as they are now. They plowed the profits into factories and railroad s. When their empires were threatened, they became politicians and lawmak ers. And along the way they decided that there was value in public rel ations, and so they endowed schools from Brown to Harvard, Princeton, a nd Yale. THE SUGAR PLANTATION The world of the Cabots, Lodges, and the rest of th e Boston Brahmins would never have existed if not for the slave-tradi ng Brown family and a more powerful but lesser known family, the Perkin ses. The Browns developed their empire on the slave trade, on banki ng, and through the most remarkable act of industrial piracy, the texti le industry. The Perkinses went even further. By starting as slave t raders, they took New England to its highest level of wealth by introduci ng the region to the opium trade. The Perkins family united the Whitneys , the Tafts, the Roosevelts, the Cushings, the Appletons, the Bacons , and others in the criminal enterprise that would form the bedrock of New England and American wealth. It is little wonder that the Perkins family roots w ere in the slave trade, specifically in Saint Domingue, an island wh ere in the late eigh- teenth century thirty thousand white planters and t heir soldiers con- trolled a half million black workers. Control was m aintained by harsh treatment, and this control made Saint Domingue wea lthy. While it was ostensibly governed by the French, the island was m ade up of eight hundred sugar plantations that were often owned by Americans.

Cotton from Saint Domingue kept the cloth mills of France in operation. Historians estimate that in France, one person in five depended on the overseas trade for employment. This staggering wealth was the envy of all the European countries. 5 The Haitian plantations maintained a higher degree of profit than any other island in the Caribbean. One third of the plantations returned to their owners 12 percent each year, compared to an average of 4 perc ent in the British- owned islands. The media of the day often supported business again st its detrac- tors, as happens today. While Adam Smith wrote of t he superior treat- ment of plantation workers by the French, it was a fantasy, and the mortality rate of slaves proves it. 6 One survey shows a plantation going through four times its original slave population; t his means that the act of killing 80 percent of one's workforce through ha rsh treatment was somehow acceptable in sugar plantation economics. Workers were poorly housed and underfed. The food f or slaves was often the stock fish brought in on the four thousan d or more American ships that registered in Saint Domingue. The Americ an ships were mostly from New England and returned with sugar and molasses. The American ships also traded slaves. Industry in New England and France prospered as those who engaged in slave trading plo wed their profits into the factories, the railroads, and the mines. In order for a small population to control such a l arge population, violence was commonplace. For a minor infraction, w hipping and the application of salt and pepper on the wounds was ty pical. Branding, mutilation, and death were typical as well. A runaw ay slave could expect to be hamstrung. The act of eating sugarcane was pu nished by being forced to wear a metal muzzle. Women could be raped without recourse. Documented cases exist in which disobedie nce was curtailed by nailing a man by the ear to an object. And in on e case a slave's ears were cut off, cooked, and forced upon him as food.

THE MILITARY ORDERS AND THE SLAVE TRADE Slave trading prospered all the way through the spr ead of Islam. While Europe participated in the age-old institution, it used mostly white slaves from European lands that had been conquered rather than African slaves. The Arabs simply made the slave trade more international. When the tide turned against Islam, the Italian merchant s and then the fight- ing crusader orders stepped into the trade. In fact , Italian shipowners had a reputation for simply selling a boatload of p assengers to an Arab trader. Such acts led to Templar ships being consid ered safer from the passengers' viewpoint, as the Templars were more li kely to protect their pilgrim passengers. Later the Templar orders and th e Knights of Saint John joined the slave trade to fund their operation s. In Iberia, the Arabs used black slaves to cultivate the land and to fight against the Christians. During the reconquist a, much land was given to the military orders, including those of Calatrav a, Alcantara, and Aviz of Spain and the Knights of Christ in Portugal.

The Knights were one of four military orders in Portuga l, all of which were the remnants of the Knights Templar, which had been disbanded by the efforts of the king of France and the Catholic pope . While the French knights were arrested, tortured, and burned at the stake, the Portuguese knights simply changed their name and were born aga in with the bless- ing of Pope John XXII. The knights kept their wealt h, their status, and even their regalia: a red cross on a white field. Although he was called the Navigator, Prince Henry did very little navigating. He did, however, pilot his order from a castle in Sagres, Portugal, where he gathered all the nautical wisdom of his day. He improved on the nautical instruments, gathered maps and perfected the art of cartography, developed new vessels such as t he caravel (a small, graceful, two-masted ship built to navigate shallow seas and make long- distance crossings), and trained would-be mariners to sail. Henry's navigators, possibly with the aid of ancien t maps, soon rediscovered Atlantic islands such as the Azores an d Madeira and then set their sails toward Africa. In 1441 Henry's firs t caravel reached Africa—and returned with black slaves. The trade wa s not new to Africa. Black tribes had enslaved each other for th ousands of years. The Islamic Berbers and Arab Moors then took over the t rade. The costs of outfitting a fleet and a world-class u niversity at Sagres were great, and the sugar trade with Madeira and th e slave trade would defray some of the high costs of maintaining both.

In the conquest of Granada, which unified a great deal of what is now modern Spain, the government was quick to employ wh at we would today call ethnic cleansing. The Islamic conquerors were first to go. Next were the Jews; they had thrived under a more t olerant Islamic rule and were allowed to be educators, merchants, and ba nkers. The third target was the heretics. Even before the 1492 captu re of Granada, the Inquisition was in place, its goal to drive out pag ans and Christian heretics alike. By 1492 Dominican tribunals were op erating in eight major cities. Christians and conversos, the convert ed Jews, were regularly consumed by flames in city squares. August 2, 1492, the day before Columbus left Spain, was the final deadline for all Jews to convert or leave. When Spain ran out of people to expel, it sent an e xpedition to the Canary Islands.

His first biography, written by his son F erdinand, questions even their surname. Columbo, meaning \"the dove,\" wa s a chosen name, says Ferdinand, as it was the symbol of wisdom and of Saint John the Baptist. Saint John was sacred to the Templars. 7 Columbus's first service outside commercial expedit ions was for the Good King Rene. Little was written regarding the Co lumbus-Rene d'Anjou connection. The book Holy Blood, Holy Grail claims that Rene was a grand master of the Priory of Sion, the secre t organization that was behind the formation of the Knights Templar. Ce rtainly Rene was involved in some very select chivalric orders, incl uding the Order of the Crescent, the Order of the White Greyhound, and l'O rdre de la Fidelite. It is not known whether Rene played a role in intro ducing Columbus to the secret orders. More likely the circuitous ro ute that led Columbus to a connection with the resurrected Templar order was through marriage. In 1477 Columbus sailed north to Iceland, where the Vikings had settled hundreds of years before, and used the area as a way station between Greenland and the Americas. He sailed to Ir eland, where in Galway Bay \"flat-faced\" natives, leading Columbus t o believe they were Asians, had washed up dead. These were possibly Inu it from Greenland or North America. Columbus also sailed to the port city of Bristol, England, which was once a stronghold of the Knights Templar and later a stronghold of the English slave trade. Columbus was more than well read; for his time he w as a scholar extraordinaire. At his bedside was a book titled Im ago Mundi, by Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly, which Columbus had read an d reread and whose margins he had filled with notes. 8 He also read Marinus of Tyre, who had divided time into twenty-four hours. Columb us found sup- port from Strabo and Pliny, who estimated the world at one-third less than its true size. And the adventurer read Aristot le and Seneca, who believed the Indies were just a few days' sail from Cadiz. 9 In Medea Seneca wrote, \"An age will come when Ocean will bre ak his chains, a"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Red Cross and Black Cargo 193 huge land will be revealed.\" 10 Columbus also owned a copy of the Book of Ser Marco Polo and an Italian translation o f Pliny's Natural History. 11 Like the other famous Genoese explorer John Cabot ( born Giovanni Caboto), Columbus married well. After being shipwre cked in Portugal, he settled in Lisbon and attended mass at the Churc h of All Saints. The Moniz-Perestrello family had come from Genoa a hund red years before and settled in Portugal to work as merchants, trade rs, and adventurers. By the time Columbus reached Portugal, the family had achieved wealth and status. It had also endowed the Conventos dos Santo s, where Columbus met the widowed Felipa Moniz. Dona Felipa was twent y-five; Columbus was twenty-seven. Within a year they married. How the son of a weaver married into a family of th e Knights of Christ is a mystery that has never been solved. Mon iz's father, Bartholomeu Perestrello, was trained by Henry the N avigator at Sagres Castle and had taken part in the exploration of the Atlantic islands. He was given the title of governor, or capitano, of Po rto Santo, where he received the revenue from all trade and commerce. H is son later inher- ited the title, the position, and the revenue. Columbus and his new bride honeymooned on Madeira, accom- panied by his new mother-in-law, Isabel Moniz. Her family also had a long distinguished history with roots in the Algarv e. Although marriage into the Moniz-Perestrello family brought Columbus status, Isabel Moniz gave Columbus something even more appreciated by the explorer: the books and charts of her husband. The successive discovery and rediscovery of the Canaries, the Azores, Madeir a, and the Cape Verde archipelago revealed an ocean full of islands just as Plato had written. 12 Armed with the knowledge of geography that was ava ilable to the few who could read, as well as the maps and charts of the Atlantic known to a few and protected by the secrecy of the Knights of Christ, Columbus sailed west.

The Spanish called these dugouts \"canoes,\" but they were actually as l ong as a European galley and eight feet wide. 13 In comparison, the three ships on Columbus's expedition held ninety people total. An Arawak group known as the Lucayans were active t raders who sailed to Guatemala for beads, jade, and quartz, wh ich they used to make pottery. The natives were also capable of smel ting gold, silver, and copper. The natives discovered the \"thunder reeds\" of the n ewcomers, from the wrong end of the rifle barrels. In March 1495 i n Hispaniola, the island later split between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the first battle was pitched between the Spanish people and t he native popula- tion.

At first it was a handful of Taino natives, who were brought to Spain almost as a curi osity. By the time of Columbus's fourth voyage, the Spanish might have brought as many white or Moorish slaves as blacks. In 1505 fifteen black slaves were brought to Hispaniola, 15 but shortly afterward the native population was reduced by smallpox at such an alarming rate th at replacement workers were needed.

Bla ck Africans would accompany the Spanish explorers both as slaves and as free men. In fact, on the Cortes exploration of Mexico, Juan Garrido, a free black born in Spain, was given the distinction of being the fi rst European to plant wheat in Mexico. 16 The Native American population collapse soon opened the flood- gates, and licenses were granted even to the Cathol ic holy orders to import slaves—sometimes by the hundreds. Bartolome de Las Casas, scion of an old French family in Spain, saw firstha nd the destruction of life that Spain was causing among the natives and r ecommended that blacks be put to work in America instead. 17 Soon both white Europeans and black Africans were making the dangerous crossi ng to work as slaves for the new ruling class of the Americas. Tw o hundred and fifty thousand white Englishmen were transported against their will to work on the plantations of the Caribbean. 18 Their treatment was as harsh; their survival was short. When slavery is discussed today, race is usually em phasized. But slavery, as horrible an institution as it was, woul d not become a racial issue until after the American Revolution. Prior to this time slavery more often involved peoples who were captured or su bjugated in war- fare; as such it may have taken on a cultural focus , but it was not along the lines of color. Whites enslaved whites, blacks enslaved blacks, and the conquering armies and navies of Islam enslaved Euro peans and Africans as opportunity allowed. The blame for slavery canno t be placed on any one particular group, as the practice was nearly un iversal. The early slave trade was an effort of the Old Worl d as a commu- nity. The Portuguese and then the Spanish licensed the trade. The sea captains of Genoa bought the licenses. The banking and merchant fam- ilies from France to Flanders lent the money that p aid for the licenses and mounted the expeditions. Slavery was an equal-o pportunity exploiter; everywhere, the powerful could enslave t he less powerful. The early trade was a matter not of capturing slaves, b ut rather of buying them.

The Wolof, who were rich in slaves, soon became rich in horses, and they wer e no less complicit than the Europeans who came to buy. The Songhai emp ire in Senegambia was at least as sophisticated in trade, currency, and social status as the Portuguese. Their markets were as dev eloped and often older than those of the traders who came to buy. The 1520 through the 1540s saw the trade grow to he ightened pro- portions. Conversos, or Jewish families who claimed conversion to escape death, found their way to the Netherlands, a nd then to the New World, where some would play a large role. Jesuits too owned slaves, traded slaves, and ran plantations. From the northe rn European Danes and Dutch to the Iberians and Arabs in the south, t he business was con- ducted for the profit of those who could build and buy the ships and capture, sell, or employ the slaves. When the Americas were invaded by the Spanish conqu istadors, an early use for forced labor was in the silver mines of Peru and Cuba. The Indians had worked these mines before but not under the harsh condi- tions imposed by the Spanish. The cruelty of the co nquerors led to a much greater mortality rate among the natives.

Selling the licenses was as lucrat ive as actually buying slaves in Africa and crossing the ocean to sell the m in the New World.

T he Spanish crown, acting through a host of military orders, licensed the rights to explore, conquer, and subjugate foreign peoples and lands. O nce an empire was in place in a new region, the government took upon itself the right to sell licenses granting others the right to buy and sell slaves. These licenses first went to the elite families who finan ced and led for-profit expeditions to the Americas. THE FRENCH ENTER THE SLAVE TRADE France was separated by the destructive wars betwee n the Catholics and the Protestants, but both sides would soon follow i n the Caribbean sugar and molasses trade. Both Catholic and Protest ant participated in the slave trade as well, though usually from differ ent ports. While the French Protestants, or Huguenots, conducted busines s through a more modern system that gave great power to individual m ercantile leaders, the Catholic military orders that survived acted as one great company, like the Knights Templar had before 1307. Saint Christopher, the first Caribbean island to be colonized by France, was bought by the order of Saint John of Je rusalem in 1653. 20 The order soon added the islands of Tortuga and Sai nt Barthelemy to its holdings.

The order soon tran sferred ownership of its Caribbean islands to the French West India Comp any. 21 After the order paved the way for French participation in the Atlantic trade, indi- vidual companies run by Catholics or Huguenots fill ed the vacuum.

Secret and e lite societies may have even run the other side of the business, procuring slaves to sell to the Europeans. In The Serpent and the Rainbow, Wade Dav is describes cap- tured victims of the western Yoruba being brought d own the Niger and delivered into the hands of the Efik. The Efik were ideally suited at the mouth of the river to meet the Europeans. The slave ships that anchored at the river's mouth were required to pay a duty to the Efik chiefs in exchange for slaves. Order was maintained by a secr et society, the Egbo, or leopard society. The Efik chief, called an obong, often was the head of an Egbo group that maintained discipline through fear. The weapons of the Europeans were guns first and or ganized reli- gion second. The weapons of African societies were similar; first the vic- tim population was conquered and enslaved by force, and later it was subjected to religion. Religion in early Africa was most likely grounded in superstition, as it was in the rest of the world , but it was different in that it utilized more drugs. One of the weapons of subjugation was the Calabar bean, a source of datura, a psychoactively violent herb. 22 The use of such psychoactive drugs was carried to Ameri ca to maintain order. On the surface it appeared that the elite of the New World required only their weapons and the martial powers of the military and"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Red Cross and Black Cargo 199 the military orders to maintain order. But religion did serve a purpose; in addition to keeping order, it provided justifica tion for the act of con- quering the American Natives. And it provided an ex cuse for the cru- elty of enslavement. The slaves—blacks and Indians alike—did not, of cou rse, simply forget their own religious beliefs. Their religions , which were often the products of numerous nations, regions, and language s, blended with the Catholic iconography. The result was a multitude of new hybrid reli- gions built on a base of pagan beliefs. The religio n of the saints became Santeria in Cuba and Puerto Rico, obeah in Jamaica, vodun (voodoo) in Haiti (Saint Domingue) and later in New Orleans, Curanderismo in Mexico, and Candomble in Brazil. 23 The glue that Catholicism was supposed to have prov ided for soci- ety was actually supplied in a way for which the Ch urch and the slave owners were not prepared. The same shamans and memb ers of secret African societies who survived the passage brought their own cohesive structure to the New World. On the islands of Hispa niola, Jamaica, and Cuba these groups escaped into the mountains, led b y religious leaders and their core elite. They inspired others to escap e and join, and they roused enough fear in others that secrets were kept . Assassinations were even conducted by group members who could move arou nd invisibly. The voodoo-inspired revolution that chased the like s of the Perkins family back to Boston was as deadly as the terror o f the French Revolution. The white traders and planters brought Freemasonry across the Atlantic. Just a few years after lodges were establ ished in the northern colonies, they spread south. The first Caribbean lo dge was established in Jamaica in 1739. The prosperous island of Barbados had a lodge of its own the next year, and by 1749 Saint Domingue too h ad its own lodge. The French in Saint Domingue allowed blacks into th eir lodges at a time when the growth of vodun was at its greatest. The rebellion that brought whites and blacks to New Orleans from the C aribbean intro- duced both the European lodge system and the vodun secret societies into the United States. The American vodun religion , with its symbolism,"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"200 From the Sacred to the Profane ritual clothing, and mysterious doctrines, appears to be an amalgama- tion of African, Freemason, and Catholic influences . The black slave insurrection was led by Jean-Jacque s Dessalines and Toussaint-Louverture, both active Masons. Toussaint -Louverture had declared independence for Saint Domingue in 1791, a nd although France's emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte, attempted to suppress it, there were thirty thousand whites among 465,000 black sla ves. The popula- tion had seen an increase of forty thousand blacks in the three years preceding the revolution. The independence movement eventually suc- ceeded under the leadership of Dessalines, who then renamed the French part of the island Haiti, an Arawak name. Be tween 1791 and 1794 there was a reign of terror as revolutionary b lacks had their own version of Robespierre, Boukman. Boukman used a net work of voodoo priests and the mystery of voodoo ritual to incite the revolution. Under Boukman's rule, whites were raped, tortured, and ki lled; plantations were pillaged; and property was burned. In three ye ars ten thousand whites and an unknown number of blacks fled, mostly to Louisiana. Ten thousand whites were killed, which was one third of the population. HUGUENOTS IN THE TRADE As Catholic France paved the way, the Huguenot slav ers and smugglers played an even bigger role in the commercial activi ty of the new American colonies. From the same ports that the Tem plars once held in the fourteenth century, like La Rochelle, the sixte enth-century Huguenots organized into secret groups from which t hey supported each other against often larger enemies. These grou ps were organized through a series of Masonic lodges. Much of the English and Scottish participation in t he slave trade, in smuggling, and even in piracy was organized in lodg es and cells whose members protected one another. Masons enjoyed prote ction that extended to the highest levels in power. Although s lave trading today is statutory piracy, it used to be the prerogative of the English crown. The Duke of York organized the English monopoly of the trade, and the"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Red Cross and Black Cargo 201 largest shareholders were the members of the royal families—who were often at the pinnacle of the secret societies. The Protestant French did not always have the same blessing from the royals as did their English competitors or the Catholic slavers. The Huguenots were among the last to enter the slave tr ade, but they caught up quickly. In 1691 a Huguenot in the service of th e French Senegal Company became the governor of Saint Domingue. 24 At home in France three ports—Nantes, Bordeaux, and La Rochell e—ended up in control of 70 percent of the slave-trading business . Nantes, which is up the Loire River from the Atlant ic coast, soon controlled 50 percent of the trade by itself, thank s to the tightly knit, intermarried Protestant families of Michel, Luynes, Boutelhiers, Drouins, Bertrands, Grou, and Montaudoin. 25 Islands in the Loire pro- vided suitable harbor for importing cotton and othe r goods, the final product of the trade that started with African slav es. The house of Rene Montaudoin emerged as the single largest company, c ontrolling the majority of the trade in Nantes, the largest slave- trading city. The fam- ily business outfitted 357 ships in the eighteenth century, almost dou- ble the amount of the Luynes family, the next close st competitor. Rene Montaudoin was a member of the Royal Academy o f Science and also a Mason. His home base, Nantes, was a Maso nic stronghold imbued with the ideas ofVoltaire and Rousseau. Mont audoin became close friends with Benjamin Franklin and helped sup ply the American cause against the British. But the rights of man ha d little application in the principal business of Nantes—the buying and sel ling of humans. The role of the French Masons in the slave trade is a prime example of the divisive goals of Masonic groups and of the elite themselves. In 1789 there were more than six hundred Masonic lodge s in Paris. They ranged from the craft worker and social groups to t he more restrictive lodges with nobles, priests, and even brothers of t he king. Prominent lodges included the leaders of the Enlightenment. T he Lodge of the Nine Sisters was one such lodge; founded by the astronom er Lalande, the lodge was joined by Condorcet, Chamfort, Houdon, Danton, and Benjamin Franklin. They adhered to no religious doctrine out side of the deist belief"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"202 From the Sacred to the Profane that there is a supreme architect of the universe. 26 They acted against the Catholic religion, however, and were instrumental i n expelling the Jesuits from France. They were pledged to mutual assistance and religious toler- ation, which conversely allowed them to control the slave trade and force the Catholic religion on slaves. There were also liberal Masonic groups whose member ship included Lafayette, his in-laws the Noailles, Mirab eau, the duc de La Rochefoucauld, and the duc d'Orleans. Lafayette wor ked to end slav- ery and experimented by buying two Suriname plantat ions from the Jesuits and educating his own slaves in preparation for their freedom. Perhaps the greatest irony is that the Masonic-insp ired revolution backfired against the membership's nobles and elite . A decade before the Reign of Terror would count thousands of heads lost to the guillotine, Masonic-linked families like the Montaudoins came t o the aid of the new experiment in democracy. Rene Montaudoins family enterprise might have provi ded an example to the American captains of the slave and t extile industries. Montaudoin donated money to build the Nantes hospit al and plowed much of his wealth into factories where cotton was processed. Members of the De Wolf family of Bristol, Rhode Isl and, were classic imitators, financing the textile industry of New En gland with the money earned in the slave trade. Although the motive of the French in the slave trad e was primarily profit, their actions took on political and religio us overtones. The French Huguenots had numerous enemies, and the Cath olic Church presented the greatest threat. French Freemasons br ought blacks into the lodges as a way of keeping the groups from beco ming Catholic. When Britain went to war with American colonies, Fr ance saw an opportunity to hurt its long-term enemy. 27 THE ENGLISH SLAVE TRADERS The English were latecomers in the exploration of t he New World. After a very brief effort employing John Cabot to s ail the coast in 1497,"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Red Cross and Black Cargo 203 the English waited more than a hundred years, until the time of Queen Elizabeth I, before conducting further exploration. Elizabeth was sur- rounded by a court of adventurers and alchemists, w ho advised the queen to participate in the conquest. Elizabeth's reign began shortly after the death of the Catholic queen Mary I. Mary's death had ended a tense strugg le between Catholic and Protestant factions over the throne. E lizabeth's father, Henry VIII, had an unusual propensity for marrying and then dispens- ing with his wives. One of them, Anne Boleyn, was E lizabeth's mother. Boleyn was accused of the crime of fornication and was beheaded, making Elizabeth illegitimate. That status was not important to the fam- ily of the Duke of Northumberland, who wanted a Pro testant ruler. The duke and his group attempted a coup to put Elizabet h on the throne instead of Henry's other daughter, Mary. The so-cal led Dudley Conspiracy ended badly for the twenty conspirators; they were sent to the Tower, some to be executed and others to be imp risoned. Elizabeth, however, remained physically unharmed, but the affa ir made her almost paranoid. A few weeks after Mary's death, on a precise day (J anuary 15, 1559) picked by Elizabeth's astrologer, Dr. John Dee, Eli zabeth was made queen of England. She had been drawn to the occult since childhood, and it was one commonality she shared with her fath er. Her long-term friend and rumored lover Robert Dudley introduced E lizabeth to Dee. Dee had been hired by the Duke of Northumberland to teach science to his two sons. Dee's reputation as a sorcerer grew from his school days, when in the middle of a Greek play at Cambridge he displaye d an ability to lev- itate a large scarab. The year he graduated, he was imprisoned as a sor- cerer. The short imprisonment did not hurt his chan ces at gainful employment; he soon found himself a favorite of Eli zabeth's court and was given a home called Mortlake. At Mortlake the cabalist, alchemist, and mathematic ian amassed a library of four thousand volumes, the largest in En gland. Dee's library would be used by two of England's greatest chronicl ers, Hakluyt and"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"204 From the Sacred to the Profane Holinshed. To Dee there was no divide between scien ce and magic. He displayed a magic mirror that mystified all but wou ld not allow anyone to reveal what he or she had seen. A maid reported that she had seen a cloud of bees swarm downstairs from his chambers, p lainly familiars of the doctor. Dee introduced Elizabeth to Francis Kelly, who clai med to be able to transmute metals into gold. Elizabeth hired him to avoid taxing her subjects. Dee persuaded Elizabeth that she was entitled to en ormous areas in the New World based on claims that the Saxon versio n of the Greek conqueror Alexander, King Edgar, had made. Her Maje sty was also a direct heir of King Arthur, according to Dee. Dee c onvinced Elizabeth that Britain had a destiny to rule as Britannia and that as an island the country needed a great navy. He told her that the A mericas were to be the new, Greater Britannia, the virgin continent fo r the Virgin Queen. Now the quest was on for the new Avalon. Having bee n confined to her palace, Elizabeth lived her life vicariously—in tellectually through Dr. Dee, emotionally through the men Dee brought to her. In 1577 Dee wrote The Perfect Art of Navigation and dedicated it to Christopher Hatton, who financed the maritime adven tures of Elizabeth's court. Elizabeth gathered together Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh. Drake changed the name of his ship to the Golden Hind, which was the heraldic device on Hatton's fam ily crest. Drake was then set loose to plunder the Spanish Main and claim lands for Elizabeth. He brought her an emerald-studded crown, a diamond cross, and a share in the 235,000 pounds' worth of plunder from Spain. Her share alone exceeded her annual royalties. Drake is regarded as one of the greatest English se a captains of all time. His exploits as a navigator brought Britain i nto the world-encircling role of Britannia, the empire. Drake declared north ern California to be Nova Albion, and claimed it for Elizabeth. His expl oits as a privateer— a pirate with permission—helped finance further voy ages and added to the coffers of the English kingdom. The Virgin Quee n was quick to catch on to the ways of the world. She licensed tra de, conquest, and"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Red Cross and Black Cargo 205 piracy. The risks were small, unless one includes w ar with Spain. The Spanish were indignant over the raids on their ship ping and encroach- ment on their new lands, and so they threatened to invade England. Elizabeth's chief conjurer, John Dee, put a hex on the Spanish Armada, which is believed to have brought bad weather and t he English victory. Elizabeth gave licenses to Dr. Dee, who at one time had the patent to all American lands north of 50 degrees latitude. Th e queen also licensed explorers John Davis and Walter Raleigh to find a northwest passage to China and India. Sir Walter Raleigh was a maverick. Alternately in a nd out of favor with the queen, Raleigh was renowned for his bravad o, energy, and intelligence. For Elizabeth and the glory of Britan nia, Raleigh searched South America for the legendary treasure of El Dora do. He believed that a source of gold was not far from the Orinoco River, which he called the River of the Red Cross, a reference to t he Templars. Raleigh believed he was meant to play the role of the Red C ross Knight, a fig- ure in the Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser. 28 Raleigh did go down in history as the first to brie fly attempt colo- nization in the New World, which failed. He at leas t managed to imprint the queen's name on the New World, on the s tate of Virginia. John Hawkins, a cousin of Sir Francis Drake, introd uced the English to the African slave trade. Other English captains before him had been to Africa, violating the exclusive trade claimed by Spain and Portugal. But Hawkins was given express permission by Queen E lizabeth to trade for slaves. Hawkins's backers included his father-i n-law, Benjamin Gonson, the treasurer of the navy, and Sir Thomas L odge, the Lord Mayor of London. 29 Hawkins had no qualms about capturing the slaves hi mself or buy- ing or stealing them from the Portuguese. His first voyage was a mild success, but his subsequent voyages made great prof its, and for this he was knighted.

Men like Abraham Lincoln would carry the banner for equality and individual rights while others would perpetuate the status quo . There is no dividing line to say where English slav e trading ended and the American trade began. Tracing the start of slavery in what would become the United States, Hugh Thomas, author of The Slave Trade, found a letter from the Reverend George Down ing of Harvard that was written to his cousin John Winthrop, gover nor of Connecticut. The letter suggested importing slaves into New Engl and and held British-owned Barbados as an example of the profits of slavery. George Downing's father, Emmanuel Downing, of Salem, also wrote to Winthrop suggesting the same. New England merchants had discovered that the trade was a lucrative business, even thoug h the area itself had little need for imported labor. Massachusetts had o nly about a hundred slaves in the seventeenth century. But ships owned by Massachusetts firms would move tens of thousands of slaves for pr ofit. The most successful American slave traders had rela tionships in Europe. As the slave trade grew in Europe, the Engl ish port of Liverpool went from a fishing village to a first-rate seaport . Four families domi- nated the trade; the wealthiest was Foster Cunliffe , who had four ships that sailed for Africa each year. His wealth grew f rom the trade and he was elected mayor. The American headquarters of the Cunliffe trading business was at Oxford, Maryland, where Cunliffe's American agent was the father of Robert Morris, the chief financier of the American Revolution. Just as many American fortunes are founded on the s lave trade, opium running, and smuggling, so are many of England's. T he slave trade grew in leaps and bounds in Britain and two cities, Bris tol and Liverpool, became hot spots for the trade. Bristol had become an important seaport during the Crusades, and Templar ships controlled t he industry there. When the slave trade exploded as an economic opport unity, Bristol's business increased, with her merchants responsible for the yearly transport of seventy thousand slaves. Liverpool's history was shorter; it evolved into"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"208 From the Sacred to the Profane a seaport as a result of the slave trade. Prior to Liverpool's entry into the trading business, its population numbered five thou sand. After entering the cotton, sugar, and slave-trade triangle, busine sses such as ship- builders, textile mills, and supporting industries enlarged the tiny port and its surrounding towns to nearly one million peo ple. Prominent English families who controlled the trade included the Leylands, Ingrams, Cunliffes, Tarletons, Claytons, Bolds, Kennions, and Banastres. These families started the city's banks and industries, many of which survive today. 2 Not much was done to conceal the ugly business; even the Liverpool city exchange building depicted African heads and elephants. New England's first slave-trading ship came from th e seaport city of Marblehead, but it was built in Salem and was regis tered there. The Desire did not pioneer the trade to Africa but simp ly sailed to the West Indies and returned with slaves for sale in Connect icut. 3 Marblehead and Salem were capitals of a sea-trading empire tha t spanned the seven seas. Those who took part in the trade were firmly connected by the Masonic lodge system. In fact, a Marblehead lodge c arried American Masonry to China, where in the heyday of opium trad ing Massachusetts had a beachhead. The lodges of the Massachusetts seamen were often f raternal and would admit shipowners and common laborers, but as the owners became wealthy, they often gravitated to more prest igious lodges. Within a generation or two they frequently moved to Boston. Colonial Masonry rose above the divisive factors such as rel igion and color, but it reinforced the barrier between the rich and the poor. 4 Boston's first families soon entered the trade. Pet er Faneuil, a Mason and a Huguenot, was an active trader. He was joined by the Belchers, the Cabots, and the Waldos. While the customers of the slave trade were the southern plantations, the shippers were New Eng landers. Modern Boston tries to downplay its role in the slave trad e, with Massachusetts historians pointing the finger at its neighbor Rhod e Island. Historian Samuel Morison claims, \"The 'Guinea trade' had neve r been an impor- tant line of commerce in Massachusetts,\" 5 yet at the same time he"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Master Masons and Their Slaves 209 admits that Salem had a regular trade with Africa, selling rum and fish for gold dust, palm oil, and ivory. \"It would be su rprising if the occa- sional shipmaster did not yield to the temptation,\" notes the author. 6 Morison, who was from a prominent Brahmin family, e qually warned readers against exaggerating the opium trafficking. 7 But there is no denying that the bedrock of New England's wealth, i ncluding that of many of today's most successful corporations, was f unded with the pro- ceeds of both the slave trade and the opium trade. Despite Massachusetts's claims to the contrary, it was involved in the trade almost as far back as Virginia was. Samuel Va ssall, one of the colony's first promoters, is on record complaining about the monopoly of the Guinea Company, an English institution, in t he lucrative trade in 1649. 8 A 1724 letter from Irish merchant Thomas Amory sug gests that the shippers of the slave trade were predominantly from New England. Other historians also conclude that the slave trade 's contribution to the industry of New England is much greater than most w ill concede. The authors of New England and the Sea claim that 30 pe rcent of the traffic in blacks was done on New England ships. Furthermor e, the tobacco and rice plantations, fueled by slave labor, were t he biggest customers for New England's exports: timber, rum, and fish. A s the authors put it, \"The coffers of some of New England's proudest fami lies were filled with profits from this trade.\" 9 Massachusetts might have been the first New England state to get involved in the trade, but as it devoted its attent ion to China, the state's slavery business was soon eclipsed by that of its n eighbor Rhode Island. RHODE ISLAND AND THE TRADE New Englanders like to claim the slave trade was ce ntered in Rhode Island, and they are not completely incorrect in as signing the blame. 10 Rhode Islanders, in turn, like to point the finger at the Jews, which is also in part correct. In 1654 a handful of Portugue se Sephardic families fearing a new Inquisition left their country for th e Netherlands. After a brief time they came to America. Rhode Island, foun ded by Roger"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"210 From the Sacred to the Profane Williams, offered religious freedom. It also offere d something even more revolutionary to a small group of families: ec onomic freedom. This handful of closely related families learned qu ickly, and soon came to represent most of the slave-trading busines s of the tiny colony. Sephardic families including those of Aaron Lopez, Abraham Redwood, Abraham Pereira Mendes, Jacob Riveras, Jacob Polock , and the De Wolfs joined English colonists like William Ellery, Henry Collins, Samuel Vernon, John Canning, and Joseph Wanton, who also m ade money from the trade. The slave trade was not the province of Jews, Episcopalians, or Huguenots. It did, however, pay to band together and operate in secrecy. Christian or Jewish, the slave traders had to be connected, at least to each other. Religious affiliation was ofte n the tie that bound. But not every slave trader was from a persecuted se ct. For this reason it was very important to be accepte d into a lodge. The lodge system, which was composed of the elite s hipowners, made navigating the treacherous waters of both the Atlan tic Ocean and New England political life easier. The Newport Lodge wa s founded by a merchant from Boston, and once it was established i t was populated mostly by Jews from Portugal and the Caribbean. Mos es Seixas served as grand master for Rhode Island from 1791 to 1800\" ; he went on to become one of the founders of the Bank of Rhode Isl and. Intermarriage among Newport's first families tighte ned the bonds, as it did among the Boston merchant elite. But inte rmarriage did not mean marrying within one's race or religion; it mea nt marrying within one's caste. A Protestant could marry a Jew as long as they were both from the same station in life. Shipowner, sea capta in, and merchant were three titles within the higher caste of Rhode Islan d life. In America, Jews in general did not suffer the degr ee of hostility that they encountered in Europe. While in many coun tries Masonry rejected Jews, and at least one still does, in Amer ica Masonry welcomed them. Moses Michael Hay, a Portuguese Sephardic Jew , was instrumen- tal in bringing Scottish Rite Masonry to America, a nd Paul Revere, a Huguenot, was his deputy grand master. Hay was also instrumental in founding the Bank of Boston."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Master Masons and Their Slaves 211 Not all of the men who were instrumental in fomenti ng rebellion were Masons. Sam Adams, for example, used the taver ns where lodges met as a means of getting mob support. He was very much against the slave trade and refused the gift of a slave. John A dams, too, declared that any slave who entered his house was a free man. He was against the trade and was an outspoken critic of Masonry; the c ronyism it bred allowed many to be above the law. Among Rhode Island's Jewish merchants, Aaron Lopez was possi- bly the most famous, with thirty ships to his credi t. After fleeing a new wave of inquisitorial zeal in Portugal, Lopez arriv ed in Newport in the 1750s with a second group of Sephardic Jews. He mad e contacts rap- idly in Boston, Charleston, New York, and Jamaica, and began trading rum, furniture, candles, and slaves. In 1775 he was the single biggest tax- payer in the state and had an estate in British Ant igua as well. This was Newport's golden age of trade, and Lopez was Newpor t's most suc- cessful merchant. His family takes credit for build ing Newport's famed Touro Synagogue and for introducing the sperm-oil i ndustry to America. Before his ships went to Africa in search of black slaves, his fleet plied the oceans hunting for whales.

Author Jay Cou ghtry in his book The Notorious Triangle estimates that a hundred tho usand Africans were taken aboard more than nine hundred ships registere d to Rhode Island owners.

One family that was extremely wealthy and prominent because of the trade and thus could not erase the past was the De Wolfs. They came to Rhode Island through the Caribbean. Marc Antoine De Wolf, whose migration started in Portugal and proceeded to Holl and, Guadeloupe, and finally Bristol, Rhode Island, married the Engl ish immigrant Abigail Potter. Bristol was the namesake of England 's largest slave port, and there De Wolf was introduced to the trade as a captain on the ship of his brother-in-law, Simeon Potter. Potter traded slaves and rum in the Caribbean, and De Wolf learned quickly. With his eight sons following De Wolf into the slav e business, his extended family may have been responsible for a qua rter of Rhode Island's slaving expeditions. Not everyone in his f amily was happy with the business, however; his youngest son, Levi, was so disgusted after one slaving voyage that he resigned from the family fir m. But others showed no signs of dissension. One of Levi's brothers was famous for throwing a slave who had smallpox into the ocean. Rhode Island had attempted to stop the trade and to ok several actions against the De Wolf and Brown clans. When a slave ship was confiscated, the slavers united to help the owner t o buy it at a rigged auction. When the government sent agents to correct the abuses, they were hauled away or beaten. When the federal govern ment sent a spe- cial prosecutor, John Leonard, to try a slave trade case against James De Wolf, a Rhode Island jury failed to convict the trader. Winning the case was not enough, though, and De Wolf sent his o wn agents to Washington, D.C., to deliver a message. They beat L eonard on the courthouse steps.

James ma rried the daughter of William Bradford, who owned a rum distillery and se rved in the U.S. Senate.

The De Wolf family would also be remembered for fou nding one of the first New England insurance firms. The firm insured both the slave ships and the \"cargo.\" Today the De Wolfs' im posing mansion, Linden Place in Bristol, is a tourist attraction.

In 1825, when the sugar crop failed in Cuba, George abandoned his mansion and skipped out of Rhode Isla nd ahead of his creditors. The family home changed hands several times, but ea ch time to a different De Wolf. Theodora De Wolf married Christo pher Colt, the brother of the famous handgun manufacturer, and had six children with him. After Theodora's death, Samuel Colt bought out his brother's interest and remained in the house. Samuel Colt is also credited with founding the Industrial Trust Company, which merged with Fleet National Bank, now called Fleet Boston Financial, o ne of the largest banks in New England. Samuel P.

In 1764, whe n Britain tried to raise the price of sugar and molasses, the merchant s and shipowners of Massachusetts banded together to oppose the action. Such commodi- ties were essential to the slave trade, which was v ital to New England commerce. Colonial shipping employed four thousand seamen in New England and was responsible for thousands of periph eral occupations. The Cabot and Russell families of Boston were two o f the largest ship- pers. George Cabot was an Anglophile and a staunch Federalist whose family wealth was built on merchant shipping. He se rved as a senator from Massachusetts and was appointed the first secr etary of the navy but declined the post. Although many of those who sough t independence for the colonies were made wealthy through the slav e trade, others were opposed to it. The success of the Revolution may have depended on the money and connections of the merchants, but its ideals we re not dependent on the merchants whose politics would carefully stradd le the proverbial fence until a decision was forced. NEW YORK IN THE TRADE The numbers of slave ships sailing from New York we re small compared to those of the New England states. But the wealth of the New Yorkers who prospered through the trade is at least as grea t. The trade was restricted to the elite families that had often bee n among the feudal overlords from the colony's earliest days. The inte rmarried elite core that brought the Scottish Livingston family togethe r with their Dutch neighbors the Schuylers was joined by the Philipses , Thomas Francis Lewis, the Beeckmans, the Marstons, the Van Homes, the van Cortlandts, and the Walters. Until the American Revolution, the wealth of the"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Master Masons and Their Slaves 215 philipse family might have put them among the top t en in the colonies. Frederick Philipse had arrived with Peter Stuyvesan t as a master builder for the West India Company. Philipse exploi ted the valuations of native wampum, bought land, and invested in trad e from the begin- ning. His backing of pirate voyages may have been a mong his greatest ventures, and he would even marry the widow of anot her transatlantic trader. Philipse's slave trade was just one part of his vast operation. By 1693 the Philipse lands stretched twenty-one miles along the Hudson, for a total of ninety-two thousand acres. Philip Philipse, an heir to Frederick's fortune, ma rried Margaret Marston, thus linking another powerful family to hi s own. The Marstons owned land on Wall Street as well as the h uge Prospect Farm, a country estate near what is now Eighty-fifth Stre et. The Marstons too were a mercantile family, and as slave traders they would keep slaves on their Manhattan estate. Margaret's father, Nathanie l, was active in the Anglican Church and is buried in the family vault i n Trinity Church, a Manhattan landmark. His portrait in the Museum of t he City of New York depicts him with his ledger book, a reference to his participation in the China trade. Although the volume of ships owned by New Yorkers w as less than that of New Englanders, their role might have been just as great. Even after slavery was made illegal, ships owned by New Yorkers were found conducting an Africa-to-Cuba business. In 1859 eigh ty-five ships from New York City were supposedly working in the Cuban slave trade. The proceeds were used to add \"to the treasuries of pol itical organizations\" and \"carry elections\" in nearby states. 12 Only a few of those in the trade owned slaves thems elves. Robert Livingston was one of these people. As the elected speaker of the New York provincial assembly in 1718, business kept Liv ingston in Albany while his wife, Alida, managed their plantation. On e letter Robert received from Alida requested that he find old shoe s for the Palatines and slaves, who were barefoot. Robert Livingston is one of the few New Yorkers who actually tried farming with black s laves, and when the experiment did not work the Livingstons kept th e slaves as servants."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"216 From the Sacred to the Profane Another letter shows Robert buying a Negro girl for his son Philip. 13 As early as 1690 Robert Livingston had an interest in a Dutch ship that sailed to Madagascar, then Barbados, and final ly Virginia. In the sev- enteenth and eighteenth centuries, there was still prejudice against the Scots, even in the melting pot of New York. In orde r to rise above one's station, the ticket was to marry into a Dutch famil y, comprising the aristocracy of New York. At the peak of the slave-t rading business owned by Philip Livingston, Robert's son, the merch ant endowed Yale's first professor's chair. Alexander Hamilton, the illegitimate son of a Scott ish plantation owner in the Caribbean, followed Livingston's road to fame and fortune by marrying a Dutch woman, Elizabeth Schuyler. He b ecame a Freemason for the connections it offered. After the war the fact of his low birth was completely forgotten, as he became a member of the elite Society of Cincinnati. Hamilton became the antithesis of what Thomas Jeffe rson held as a role model for the country-in-formation. Like Jeffe rson, Hamilton owned slaves and called for their freedom; unlike J efferson, who tar- geted New York as a city of money-grubbers, Hamilto n's lifetime ambi- tion was to found a bank. Hamilton understood that he who controls the money has the most power. George Washington app ointed Hamilton the first secretary of the treasury. His f irst act was to announce that the debts of the new country were to be paid. It was ostensibly a noble idea, but one that was built on an early version of insider trading. Hamilton and his cohorts bought up as much of the war debt as possible at a rate of pennies on the dollar . They were made wealthy when these were paid. Many cried foul at th is action, yet Hamilton was a proponent of power without limitatio n and despised the checks-and-balances system. Hamilton then founded New York's first bank, the Ba nk of New York, in 1784 and brought in three other Scots to f ill the board. Another early New York bank, the Manhattan Company, was founded by Aaron Burr, who promptly loaned himself a fortun e. The Manhattan Company was seized in a hostile takeover by Hamilto n's allies—the"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Master Masons and Their Slaves 217 Livingstons—who ousted Burr. A war between Hamilton and Burr ended in the infamous duel that left Hamilton dead, Burr a fugitive, and the Stock Exchange (the Tontine Coffee House, at th at time) closed for a day. The bank survived the scandal and is still a live and well today under the new name Chase Manhattan. America's Scottish immigrants were tightly knit thr ough Masonry and other connections and were particularly adept a t using these con- nections to organize syndicates, companies, and ins titutions. Another Scotsman and merchant, Archibald Gracie, started th e first savings bank in New York. He had emigrated from Dumfries in 1784 , and within two decades the sea trade made him one of New York' s wealthiest cit- izens. Gracie is described as fabulously wealthy, a nd there were proba- bly fewer than five men in New York whose fortunes could rival his. Today the Gracie mansion serves as the home of New York City's may- ors. Neighbor of the Astors, Rhinelanders, Crugers, and Schermerhorns, Gracie's parties were legend, and th e New York glit- terati, including Alexander Hamilton, James Fenimor e Cooper, and Washington Irving, were frequent guests. In additio n, Gracie is often given credit for developing New York as a seaport. Scotsmen played a key role in establishing banks in Europe as well. The Bank of England was founded in 1694 by William Paterson, a farm-born Scotsman who had a vision of a world bank ing system con- trolled by central banks. That system is in place t oday. Paterson is also remembered as the promoter of the ill-fated Darien scheme, in which many Scotsmen died (see chapter 4), which Livingsto n would find him- self connected to by marriage. Another son of Scotl and, John Law, was born around the same time as Paterson and left his homeland for France, where he started the Banque Generale. The b ank brought pros- perity to France as it made trade more viable. Law, however, lost his proverbial shirt in his own American adventure. He combined the bank with the Mississippi Company, which he established to develop the Louisiana territories in America. The venture ended in bankruptcy and with Law fleeing for his life.

PENNSYLVANIA The first Continental Congress was held in Philadel phia, one of the colonies' most important port cities. The meeting w as attended by many in the slave trade. While Pennsylvania was not a plantation state and Philadelphia was not as active in the trade as some colonies, its mer- chants did participate. Thomas Willing, of the Will ing and Morris firm, was one of the merchants in attendance. His partner , Morris, repre- sented one of Europe's largest slave merchants, Fos ter Cunliffe. Philip Livingston, whose slave ship the Wolf plied the Atl antic, also attended. Present from the South were plantation owners inclu ding future presi- dent Madison, George Mason of Virginia, and Henry L aurens of South Carolina. Philadelphia's Society of Friends, also called the Quakers, did not approve of the trafficking of human lives. However, some individual Quakers did make profits from the trade. Friends in volved in slave trad- ing included William Frampton, who carried the firs t slaves to Philadelphia, as well as James Claypole, Jonathan D ickinson, and Isaac Norris. Even the always-industrious Benjamin Frankl in, who was a friend to the Montaudoin family, considered enterin g the slave trade. He also entertained the idea to breed slaves, rathe r than import them, in Florida. The City of Brotherly Love was founded by William P enn, whose Quaker beliefs earned him the enmity of his own fat her. In England Penn fought for religious toleration and was impris oned in the Tower of London.

He finally petitioned the king for a charter to start a colony in the New World. The king, no doubt relieved to be get- ting rid of the trouble-stirring Penn, granted the man's wish. Penn was a paragon of religious toleration and envi sioned a land where all were free to practice their faith. Voltai re, Ben Franklin's brother in the Masonic Nine Sisters Lodge, called P enn the one who could boast of bringing a new Golden Age to earth. From his Pennsylvania paradise Penn wrote that men were \"bor n with a title to perfect freedom.\" Sadly, followers of this paragon of toleration and free- dom were silent on the issue of slavery, although t he Quakers would later be counted among the first abolitionists. VIRGINIA Virginia was a planter state, and as such the state 's aristocracy was made up of people who had great expanses of land and sla ves to maintain the plantations. Its history starts with the chartering of the Virginia Company in 1606 to London's leading merchants, including Ri chard Hakluyt and Sir Thomas Smith, the son of one of Raleigh's finan cial backers. From the earliest days, life in Virginia was tough and the actions of the powerful handful that constituted the authority might shock those who accept religious freedom as the reason for the colonization of the Americas. Blasphemy and sacrilege were crimes that were subject to the death penalty, as was the crime of killing a chicke n. 14 For stealing oat- meal, one man had a needle driven through his tongu e and was then chained to a tree and left to die of starvation. 15 But the white colonists' inhuman treatment of each other for the pettiest of crimes did not extend to the elite members of the colony. The Virginia Company charter included the island of Bermuda, which allowed Virginia's founders, like Lord Robert Rich, to make a fortune in piracy as they sailed from safe harbor i n Virginia to safe har- bor in Bermuda. Slave labor would simply replace on e cruel system, servitude, with another. Men earned transatlantic p assage by agreeing to work for the planter families, often for an indefin ite period of time.The"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"220 From the Sacred to the Profane planters took advantage of the system and extended the length of serv- ice. London's poor and troublesome were disposed of by workhouses prisons, the gallows, the military, and this new op tion, Virginia. Black slave labor came to replace the indefinite se rvitude of the whites. A head of cattle worth five pounds in Virgi nia was worth twenty-five pounds in Barbados, and that island wou ld be a great source of slaves for the Virginia plantations. Unlike the sugar industry, in which the way to profits was working one's slaves to deat h, the tobacco busi- ness featured easier work, and slave families were imported to maintain the plantations for a longer term. Despite the nature of tobacco planting, which was e asier than that of the sugar industry, life was still dangerous for people who had no legal recourse. In 1669 the Virginia assembly passe d a law allowing the murder of a slave as discipline for bad behavior. W hen Robert Carter applied to the court in order to be allowed to dism ember two disobe- dient slaves, his application was granted. 16 Virginia s first families, like the Ludwells, the B yrds, the Carters, and the Spencers, shared the spoils of office and a ser ies of well-placed mar- riages to become a new aristocracy. They built huge mansions on their landed estates: The Harrisons built Berkeley; the L ees built Stratford; the Carters built Sabine Hall, Nomini Hall, and Carter' s Grove; the Byrds built Westover; the Randolphs built Tuckahoe; and t he Washingtons built Mount Vernon. Masonry united the Virginia aristocrats, and import ant members of high society were lodge members as well. Although l odge records often did not survive the centuries, the membership of Ge orge Washington, George Whyte, and George Mason is without doubt. Th ere is evidence that future presidents Monroe and Madison were also Masons, and the Masons do not claim only one of Virginia's aristocr acy, Benjamin Harrison, as a lodge brother. James Madison, a scion of the planter aristocracy, played an active role in the Constitutional Convention.

He was entrusted with trading on behalf of the colony. In doing so he con- cluded a treaty with the Pamunkey Indians by killin g two hundred of their tribe with poisoned wine. 18 The Tuckers also had one foot in Bermuda, with plantations there and in Virginia dat ing to the early days of the Virginia Company. THE DEEP SOUTH North Carolina had a plantation-driven economy, alt hough only one Constitutional Convention member from that state, W illiam Blount, was a plantation owner. Like several other signers, he was a lawyer and a Freemason. Blount was also a Revolutionary War he ro who earned the respect of many in battle. Blount started anew after the Revolution as a land speculator. His threatened finances, however, induced him to take a subversive role designed to lead the country back into war. He want ed to see the new country defeat the Spanish and open the West. For t his reason Blount became part of a conspiracy that attempted to turn over Florida to the British. He was booted from the Senate as a result. Blount had many friends, including fellow Mason Andrew Jackson, who m he had named attorney general of the Tennessee Territory. These friends in high places and important lodges prevented Blount's impeachment from hinder- ing his family's political dynasty, which would pro sper into the next century. In South Carolina the elite caste, which built its fortunes in the slave trade and plantation industry, was all-powerf ul and ran the colony in much the same way as the Caribbean states were r un. The first gov- ernor of South Carolina was Sir John Yeamans, a Bar bados planter who founded Charleston and introduced slaves to clear h is own plantation."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"222 From the Sacred to the Profane A hundred years later the planter aristocracy was i n full control of the state, even though the country was at the doorstep of democracy. Henry Laurens, who was at the Philadelphia Conventi on, was a partner in the firm of Austin and Laurens. The comp any was the largest of twelve firms in Charleston, capturing 25 percent of the slave trade. 19 Laurens held some of the largest plantations in the colony and was one of the biggest merchants, handling rice, indigo, ru m, beer, and wine. Slave traders usually earned a commission of 10 per cent of the sale price of their trades, and the slave trade was big enough that the greatest man- sions of Charleston were owned by the merchants and slave traders. Henry's father, John Laurens, was a Huguenot from L a Rochelle in France. He was part of the Huguenot wave of immigra tion that fled Catholic France because of religious war and persec ution. John would send his son Henry to England in 1744 to be trained as a merchant. Henry's education was furthered in South Carolina b y making the right friends. He became a member of the Solomon's Lodge and was trained in the craft by another wealthy Charleston merchant, James Crokatt. 20 Membership in the lodge was very important in bein g accepted by other merchants and businessmen. Stephe n Girard of Philadelphia had also joined Masonry through this i nfluential lodge. Henry Laurens started the family trade, importing r um and other tropical goods from the West Indies, bringing manuf actured goods from England, exporting rice and indigo, and buying slav es from British traders and then selling them to South Carolina pla nters. He was soon sending his own ships to Africa to eliminate the Br itish middlemen. The profits from his trade were invested in land, and b y the Revolution he owned eight plantations. He also entered politics, first at the local level and later in increasingly important positions. In 1 770, with his fortune made, Henry brought his son to England to arrange f or his son's edu- cation. There Henry became involved with the Americ an contingent protesting grievances to Parliament.

He returned to South Carolina to find his business ravaged by the Revolution, so he resigned from public life. When asked to join the Constitutional Convention as a rep- resentative of South Carolina, he declined, instead sending his new son- in-law. After the battle of Yorktown, when England's willin gness to support the protracted war was over, Laurens's English conn ection, Richard Oswald, was sent to negotiate the peace. Oswald, a Scottish slave trader who had appointed Laurens as his American agent, wa s sent by Lord Shelburne to Paris to meet with Benjamin Franklin. As the merchant caste was an elite minority, it was in its best int erest to keep the group exclusive. From New England to the Carolinas interm arriage was the norm of the times. Charles Pinckney was the son of Colonel Charles Pinckney, a wealthy plantation owner, a lawyer, and a prominent Mason. Young Charles followed in his father's foots teps but did himself one better: He married Mary Eleanor Laurens. Shortl y after Pinckney's marriage, his career and his wealth soared. He beca me the governor of South Carolina, and along with his cousin Charles C otesworth Pinckney he represented the state at the Constituti onal Convention. Cousin Charles was also the son of a plantation own er and was trained as a merchant and a lawyer. He too was in Washingto n's elite Society of Cincinnati. South Carolina's third and fourth deleg ates were also planters and lawyers. Pierce Butler was the son of a member of Parliament . He came to America because of the institution of primogeniture , which did not allow him to inherit the family estates as he wasn' t the eldest son. In 1771 he married Mary Middleton, the daughter of a w ealthy plantation owner. They moved south, with Butler resigning his military commis- sion in the British army.

He returned to amas s a fortune in plantations and slaves. He served as governor of hi s state, and after the war he was nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Senate rejected his appointment because of what was perceived as de clining mental health and an anti-Federalist position. James Oglethorpe, the man who founded Georgia, star ted his career with the Royal African Company. He became a directo r of the com- pany, whose charter gave it the right to import gol d into England and black slaves into the Americas—for a thousand years . Oglethorpe's company included some powerful gentlemen, such as J ames, the Duke of York, who was the largest shareholder, Lord Shaf tesbury, Lord Craven, Sir George Carteret, and Sir John Colleton. All were involved in the plantation business in one way or another; C olleton was a landowner in Barbados before he bought land in the Carolinas. Smaller shareholders included John Locke, the philosopher w hose call for lib- erty obviously did not include all. Oglethorpe was a Mason in England, and he organized the first lodge in Georgia in 1733 without the benefit of a c harter for the first two years. The Grand Lodge soon came around and war ranted his lodge, even assisting it financially. Most of Oglet horpe's family were Jacobins and supporters of the Stuart cause. Ogleth orpe was placed in an awkward position in 1745; as a military commande r for the English he was supposed to help put down the rebellion led by Bonnie Prince Charlie. His lack of concern earned him a court-mar tial, although he was eventually acquitted. 21 FLORIDA Florida still belonged to Spain during the American Revolution. When the state was admitted to the Union, it had a uniqu e status among the slave states in that it allowed blacks many of the same rights as whites. The polarization of early-nineteenth-century politi cs would eliminate those rights. The first black slaves were brought from Spain, not Africa, where"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Master Masons and Their Slaves 225 they were employed in mines and in agriculture. Spa nish slaves had unique rights; they were able to hold property, buy and sell goods, and initiate legal suits. These rights added up to the ability to gain their free- dom. Free blacks sailed with the Spanish to America and were part of slaving expeditions against the Taino Indians. Afte r 150 years of being part of Spanish Florida, black militias and black f ortresses made up of free blacks developed. Members gained status by ser ving in the militia, and this gave them the ability to acquire titles an d privileges. Many blacks, including Prince Witten, used such act ivities to achieve a high degree of status in Florida. He and his wife, Judy, fielded a large amount of requests to act as godparents to children in the com- munity, and they evolved into a sort of royalty, wi th Judy having a slave of her own. The slave revolt in Saint Domingue was led by Jorge Biassou, who commanded an army of forty thousand. B iassou's brother- in-law, Jorge Jacobo, married Prince Witten's daugh ter Polly, Unking a leading Florida family with a leading Haitian famil y. Juan Bautista Collins was another northern Florida black whose achievements stand out among both the free black co mmunity and the white Florida colony. He became a merchant and buil t a mercantile firm in Saint Augustine that developed trading link s in South Carolina, Saint Domingue, Havana, New Orleans, and central an d western Florida. Collins's agents were able to trade among the Seminole nation, which became an amalgamation of the Creek Indians a nd the runaway blacks. Collins raised cattle, bought and sold live stock, owned property, and, like the upper-caste Spanish, kept the Catholi c faith and served in the militia. In 1763 the British took Florida from the Spanish. British colonies, especially the neighboring Carolinas, felt threaten ed by armed blacks so close to home, and the rights and status enjoyed by free blacks became threatened. King George III gave his favorite prime minister, the Scottish Earl of Bute, the charge of picking Florid a's first British gov- ernors; both were aristocratic Scots. The first, Ja mes Grant, conceived of a colony where massive plantations, owned by absent ee Scottish aristo- crats like him, would employ black slave labor to r aise cash crops such"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"226 From the Sacred to the Profane as indigo. Grant's own plantation was created in 17 74, three years after his retirement from the governorship, and produced one quarter of the entire state's indigo production. In 1763 American and British investors united to fo rm a slave- breeding experiment. Richard Oswald, a Caithness-bo rn trader who started his career in Glasgow and later became a me mber of London's slave-trading community, teamed up with Henry Laure ns and Benjamin Franklin to import and breed Africans. Osw ald owned an island in the Gambia Paver, married into the Scotti sh Ramsay family (who brought estates in Jamaica into his portfolio) , started his own holdings in Virginia near the James River, and by 1 764 had a huge home built for himself in Ayr, Scotland. Britain's designs on Florida did not last long, as the 1783 Treaty of Paris returned Florida to Spain. Freed blacks who h ad emigrated to the Caribbean islands returned to Florida and went into Spanish courts to confirm their status. Such status was attainable un til the U.S. flag flew over Florida in 1821. The years between Florida's b ecoming a state in the Union and the Civil War witnessed racism become a reality. Independent Spanish Florida did not require that ec onomic status be accorded by color; American Florida saw blacks as a threat, and free blacks soon watched their status disappear. All bla cks were soon accorded the status of slaves. The institution of slavery was not inflicted on the world because of white Europeans, black Africans, or Islamic traders . It was not the exclu- sive province of Freemasons, Huguenots, Jews, or Mu slims. The blame for any institution that allows the rights of one c lass to be taken away by another class can rarely be assigned to any grou p or religion, but as an organization religion can lead the way to elitis m. The handful who believed they had the right to profit from slavery caused many others to feel that handful was an abomination in a land b uilt on individual freedom.

One such alliance was that of Northerner Caleb Cushing and two Southe rners, John Anthony Quitman (the governor of Mississippi) and J efferson Davis.

Investigative tec hniques may not have been as developed back then as they are today, but arsenic was a well- known poison in the nineteenth century. The symptom s of arsenic poisoning include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Taylor exhibited these symptoms, yet somehow the di agnosis was an overdose of cherries and cold milk. Arsenic can be easily discovered in the body, as it is deposited in the fingernails and hair. When the body of the president was exhumed in 1991 to test for ar senic, the poison was detected, although not in a large enough quanti ty to kill him. The test was done 140 years after Taylor's death, howev er, rendering the results inconclusive. John Quitman and his cohorts were not hanged as Zac hary Taylor had threatened.

Governor Quitman was exonerated of criminal charges . COTTON WHIGS In those critical years, the Whig party of the Nort h relied on the lead- ership of the aristocrat Robert C. Winthrop, who wa s not concerned with the slavery issue. Although the antislavery mo vement was strong among the common voters, the people in Winthrop's c lass—the ship- pers, merchants, insurers, and railroad builders—re lied on cheap labor. But instead of relying on blacks for labor, Norther ners exploited the immigrants and the average citizens. The Whig ties with the plantations of the Deep South and the English banking establish ment, which financed the cotton trade, were strong. Georgia planter and Mason Howell Cobb led the South ern Democrats. Cobb was an aristocrat who owned more th an a thousand slaves. Between Cobb and Winthrop there was an atte mpt to maintain the status quo. The spoiler was a party called the Free-Soilers, an anti- slavery group that had a poor showing in the presid ential election but was riding a groundswell of abolitionist opinion. The fateful ten years between Pierce and Lincoln wi tnessed the destruction of the Whig party, as it became obvious that the group was playing to the Southern elite. As the antislavery m ovement grew, the Republican party replaced the Whig party, and the a ntislavery move- ment finally had a candidate: Abraham Lincoln. As the movement against slavery grew, the oppositio n to it became more violent and secretive. The Knights of the Gold en Circle, which was founded by Dr. George W L. Bickley in Ohio, had secret passwords, handshakes, temples, sworn oaths, and supreme counc ils. It drew its membership from Masonic lodges. The Knights of the Golden Circle attempted to create one huge slave state, and its l argest membership came from Texas, where Governor Sam Houston was a m ember. With its funding from England and its push toward s ecession, the group would be, in the eyes of Abraham Lincoln, the greatest threat to"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"232 From the Sacred to the Profane the United States. Lincoln had thirteen thousand me mbers arrested for disloyalty, with Bickley himself being charged with spying. 1 The Knights of the Golden Circle were then led by Gener al Albert Pike, a thirty-third-degree Mason. He too recruited among M asonic lodges often in the border states and Ohio. Pike also recr uited among the Native American tribes. In the spring of 1860 Pike raised to thirty-sec- ond degree Peter Pitchlyn, the chief of the Choctaw Nation; Holmes Colbert, national secretary of the Chickasaw; and E lias Boudinot of the Cherokees. Before the war, Pike was a member of the Democratic American party, which is commonly known as the Know-Nothings . He joined the Confederacy and was among the numerous Masons p icked by fel- low Mason Jefferson Davis to run the Confederate st ates. After the Civil War, Pike was the driving force of the Knights of t he Ku Klux Klan, in which he was the chief justice. This organization a lso recruited among Masonic lodges, and in some areas the local Klan me mbership was lim- ited to Masons. Though the Klan was started in 1866 , it was officially disbanded after three years as the wave of violence and riots incited by the organization created a backlash. In 1905 Walter L. Fleming wrote a pro-Klan book fea turing the late Pike on the cover. The organization started up once more, again draw- ing its membership from Masonic lodges. Somehow Pik e, who had been charged with treason for his role in the Civil War, has been hon- ored with a statue in Judiciary Square in Washingto n. While there have been modern protests against the statue's presence, there is an equally strong movement to keep it there. THE REVENGE OF THE SLAVE TRADERS The Civil War did not just end with the surrender a t Appomattox. The final act of the war took place at Ford's Theater, where the president was killed by an assassin who was part of a very large conspiracy. John Wilkes Booth, the shooter, was a Mason and a member of the Knights of the Golden Circle. The conspiracy, of course, was much larger than Booth."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"The Masonic Betrayal 233 Four members of the organization were hanged for th eir roles and sev- eral others went to prison, but still a wider circl e provided financial sup- port. The conspiracy in the Lincoln assassination h ad as many mysteries as the Kennedy assassination would a hundred years later. After Lincoln's death, Congress formed an Assassina tion Committee to determine if Andrew Johnson had played a role in the murder. Booth had visited Johnson's residence hours before the shoot- ing. The assassin reportedly met with the future pr esident in 1864 and even earlier, when he was the military governor of Tennessee. Johnson was one of three presidents to come from Tennessee; all three were Masons. He was the first president to receive the S cottish Rite degrees. Johnson was also the target of anti-Masons, and bec ause the clergy had spoken out against him, he later requested that no clergy be present at his funeral. Lincoln had basically ignored Johnson since the pre sident's Inauguration Day, and his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, wrote a letter to a friend claiming that Johnson had a hand in her husb and's murder. Congress, however, was no more able to find evidenc e of a conspiracy than it was a hundred years later when President Ke nnedy was removed from office by a bullet. Years after the Warren Commission determined that a lone assassin managed to kill President Kennedy with an antique r ifle, a new theory emerged: Kennedy had attempted to have Fidel Castro eliminated, and Kennedy's assassination was the retaliation. Coinci dentally, Lincoln actually did instigate a plot to attack the Confede rate capitol at Richmond and kill the Confederate president, Jeffer son Davis, and his cabinet. Colonel Ulrich Dahlgren was handpicked by Lincoln t o lead the attack. Dahlgren was killed in the attempt, and pap ers found on his body pointed to the plot's origin in Washington. In retaliation, the plot to kill Lincoln was hatched by none other than Davi s and his secretary of state, Judah Benjamin. Benjamin was a unique individual who started in the Confederate government as attorney general and later became the secretary of state."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"234 From the Sacred to the Profane Born in the British West Indies of Sephardic Jewish parents, he was part of a large and active Jewish community that thrived in the Southern pre—Civil War states. Benjamin's mentor in the pre- Civil War period was John Slidell, an influential New Yorker who bec ame a transplanted Southerner. Because it was in the interest of slave traders to expand the slave states, both Democrat Slidell and Whig leader Caleb Cushing pushed first to declare war on and then to attempt to annex Mexico. Slidell's connections were very much tied to Europe , where his daugh- ter married into the prestigious French-Jewish bank ing house Erlanger et Cie. Slidell's niece married August Belmont, who represented the even more prestigious Rothschild Bank. The friendsh ips of Slidell helped Benjamin develop connections in Europe that benefited the South during the war. One of these benefits was the floating of a war bond by Erlanger in Europe to raise funds for the C onfederate states. Benjamin also became the head of the Confederate in telligence. He established operations in Canada, where the South h ad hoped to bring in an ally against the Union. This failed, but the Canada connection was useful in getting money and in running operations. More than one mil- lion dollars was held in Canada for the attempt to attack the White House and kill or kidnap the president. Two weeks b efore the Lincoln assassination, Benjamin dispatched John Surratt to Canada. While there is little indication that Benjamin knew Surratt wou ld play a role in the conspiracy, the Confederate secretary of state help ed destroy any evi- dence by burning all his papers and fleeing to Engl and, where he prac- ticed law. Benjamin was the only member of the Conf ederate government never to return to the United States. The murder of Lincoln was most likely planned from at least the time of his second inauguration, when five of the c oconspirators— Lewis Paine, George Atzerodt, David Herold, John Su rratt, and Ned Spangler—were photographed together. Booth was a gu est of the inau- guration courtesy of Lucy Hale, the daughter of a s enator from New Hampshire and Booth's fiancee. Just what precautions, if any, were taken to protec t the president prior to the assassination is unknown. There was no Secret Service"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"The Masonic Betrayal 235 detail, although Lincoln had a bodyguard, John Park er, a member of the Washington Metropolitan Police. Apparently not very diligent, Parker showed up late and took his seat outside the presid ent's box at the the- ater. Since Parker could not see the play, he decid ed to find a better van- tage point and simply left his post. Parker then in vited two other Lincoln employees, his footman and coachman, to joi n the bodyguard for a drink in a nearby tavern. Investigators have never discovered where Parker actually was when the president was ki lled. There was no question where John Kennedy's security detail was many years later in the hours leading up to his ass assination. Nine of them spent the previous night in a nightclub run by a friend of Jack Ruby, Pat Kirkwood. Ruby sent over strippers from h is Carousel Club to entertain the Secret Service men, who were still drinking at 3:30 A.M. 2 A telexed warning that the president would be assa ssinated in Dallas was ignored, and the parade route was change d at the last minute and not secured. The driver of the president's car hit the brakes after the first shot and moved again only after the third. 3 Like Lincoln's security detail, Kennedy's much larger Secret Service was no t held accountable for his death. Mortally wounded, President Lincoln was brought to the home of William Peterson, where several doctors, including Charles C.Taft, were present. Dr. Taft wasn't able to save the president , but he reportedly saved some of his hair, which ended up in a locket worn by Teddy Roosevelt at his inauguration.

Other guests of the Lincolns at Ford's Theat er also met with gruesome deaths. For example, Henry Rathbone's wife , Clara, was reportedly stabbed to death by her husband before h e tried to end his own life. He would be placed in an insane asylum. Ten years later Mary Todd Lincoln would also find h erself commit- ted to an asylum. Her son Robert was in the White H ouse when his father was shot, with President Garfield in 1881 wh en he was shot, and in Buffalo when President McKinley was shot in in 1 901. For a while Robert Lincoln had been business partners with some of the people connected to his father's death. Later Robert was s hocked to discover documents implicating others who survived the plot. He is said to have destroyed the papers. The conspirators of Lincoln's assassination fled th e scene, first to find help for Booth, who was wounded. The group, wh ich included the soldier Boston Corbett, was caught. Corbett shot Bo oth, and was later declared insane and sent to an asylum. Mary Surratt, another arrested conspirator, was the first American woman condemned to death by hanging. Just before Ma ry's death her daughter, Anna Surratt, attempted to see President Andrew Johnson to get clemency for her mother. Two men, both onetime senators, stopped Anna Surratt.

The Warren Commission basically rubber-sta mped the findings of the FBI, whose investigation concluded faster th an one could fill out a job application. The FBI, of course, was headed b y another Mason, J. Edgar Hoover. With the detractors quickly becoming victims and a favorable media system in place, the conclusion of the Warren Commission was allowed to stand—despite its glaring inaccuracy and the sentiment of the public. The role of secret societies such as the Knights of the Golden Circle did not end with the defeat of the secessionist South. The damage to the United States was already staggering: More than six hundred thousand men had been killed in a population of only thirty million. The national debt rose 2,500 percent. And the divisive politics that existed before the war did not cease. The North generated further hatr ed through the harsh punitive politics of Reconstruction. In the S outh and in states like Ohio that sympathized with the South, a new group o f secret societies thrived. The Ku Klux Klan became a resurrected vers ion of the Knights of the Golden Circle. 7 Members fostered racial hatred even in areas of the country that were not previously divided by rac e.

Opium had been cultivated from 6000 B.C.E. i n Europe and was found in neolithic burials in southern Spain dating to 4200 B.C.E. The culture we recognize as the world's first higher ci vilization, Sumeria, had a name for opium, hul-gil, or \"joy plant,\" a na me that was in use up to 5,400 years ago. An Egyptian medical text dating to 1550 B.C.E. listed a long list of ailments opium would relieve. The Gr eeks, whose mystic cults used opium in religious rituals, prescribed i t for problems such as headaches, epilepsy, coughs, and kidney stones. At the same time, they understood it was addictive. Homer refers to opium as the drug of for- getfulness. The Romans used it as a painkiller and as a poison, putting large amounts of the drug in the wine of the intend ed victim. From the Mediterranean cultures of Galen and Pliny, the drug spread east to Arabic physicians. Muslim peoples no t only inherited the medicinal uses of the drug from these ancient socie ties but also held the drug in high recreational esteem; in a land that pr ohibited alcohol, opium was a good substitute. Opium traveled east wi th the Muslim traders who preceded Marco Polo on land and crossed the Indian Ocean by ship.

The kni ghts returned with tales of the usefulness of these new drugs, to give courage, as opium did, and to motivate men in battle, as did hashish. Opium use in Europe had declined after the fall of the Roman Empire, only to increase again after Crusaders rein troduced the drug. After the demise of the Templars in 1307, there is little written on the subject, but opium remained in demand and explorers from Vasco da Gama, a member of the Knights of Christ, to Colu mbus and Cabot were instructed to obtain the magic elixir. 1 The medieval alchemist Paracelsus called it \"the stone of immortality.\" During his travels on the Indian Ocean, Afonso de A lbuquerque was acquainted with the usefulness of opium and adv ised the Portuguese king about the potential profit that exi sted in buying and reselling the drug. In a letter to his king, who wa s the grand master of the Knights of Christ, Albuquerque wrote, \"I would order poppies . . . to be sown in all the fields of Portugal.\" 2 It was a lesson that the Europeans failed to take to heart. It was easier to buy Turkish or Indian opium. OPIUM COMES TO THE AMERICAS The Pilgrims understood the benefit of the drug and took it with them on their travels to America in 1620. Laudanum was t he name given to the Pilgrims' mixture of opium, wine, saffron, cinn amon, and cloves. The Pilgrims brought a second opium-based concoctio n, paregoric, in which the drug was mixed with licorice, honey, benz oic acid, camphor, and anise oil. Dr. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of I ndependence and a member of the Continental Congress, was the s urgeon general of the Continental army. He did much to advance the us e of medicines and his \"heroic therapy,\" which incorporated opium. In fact, this ther- apy later provided a name for opium's favored deriv ative, heroin. Rush prescribed opium for cholera, for relief of intesti nal spasms, and as part of a mixture for enemas."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"240 From the Sacred to the Profane Like all drugs, opium had its downside. Physicians who prescribed it for a period of four days or less best understoo d the power of the poppy. An opium dependence goes beyond a habit; the opium becomes as fundamental as food and water, as the user's bod y is actually altered chemically and cannot function without the drug. 3 If one maintains a healthy lifestyle and uses opium properly, the drug can be part of daily existence; many prominent and not-so-prominent peop le have survived decades-long drug habits. But the nature of opium i s not conducive to a healthy lifestyle. Addicts experience physical de terioration, such as gastric and circulatory disorders. The mental effec ts exhibit themselves in a loss of interest in both personal hygiene and anyone except one's source of the drug. The body appears to feed on its elf, becoming ema- ciated from lack of food. From hepatitis and liver damage to skin dis- ease and respiratory disease, the body begins a des cent matched only by the mind's descent. Forgetfulness, lethargy, and ir ritability are the daily range of emotions suffered by the opium addict. Today's modern \"improvement\" of the opium-based gro up, which includes morphine and heroin, renders the deadly ef fects of addiction within days. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centu ries the opium smoker started on a slower road that led to the fin al impact: death. Although these effects were fully known, as they ar e today, knowledge of them did not stop the trade; it continues to thi s day. THE OPIUM TRADE The cornerstone of colonial trade was the supercomm odity. The com- modity for Portugal had been the black slave; the c ommodity that grew Spain's empire was silver. The Dutch would lead the way into the spice trade, creating huge demand for pepper and other he rbs back home in Europe. Britain and France discovered the commoditi es that were referred to as food-drugs: sugar, tea, coffee, and alcoholic beverages such as rum. Colonizing America was not just about findi ng places to dump the undesirable populations of Europe; it was also about making a profit."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"The Opium Brotherhood 241 Getting England addicted to Chinese tea was easy; k eeping a trade balance became more difficult. In 1700 the British East India Company imported twenty thousand pounds of tea. Six years l ater that figure grew 400 percent to a hundred thousand pounds. By 1 766 the cost of tea imports was becoming impossible to meet with si lver. When the fig- ure hit six million pounds, it became clear that te a would drain England of silver unless something was done. Up until the eighteenth century, drug use in the wo rld was never described as an epidemic or plague, but the British would change that. The Chinese had discovered the pleasure of smoking opium, first mixed with tobacco, which was brought by the Dutch, then in a pure form. The British East India Company cornered the opium-p roducing mar- ket and sold its drugs to willing Asians. In every southeast Asian coun- try where Britain's empire was active, the governme nt was forced to admit Indian opium. The Chinese had the most money to spend, and their extravagance easily spread opium use. Opium w as expensive to bring to market, but China had such a large wealthy ruling class that there were enough customers who could afford to buy and use the drug on a regular basis. The British East India Company had found a way to correct the tea trade imbalance. Today we often dismiss the crimes of the past as si mply being \"the way things were.\" The British and American traders, however, should not be dismissed so lightly. \"They were not ignoran t of what sort of substance they were selling. They knew it was a poi son. They knew it was addictive.\" 4 By 1836 China imported enough opium to make the dru g the largest revenue-producing commodity in the world. I t enriched a hand- ful while destroying the social and political struc ture of China. By this time the drug merchants included Americans. The gre at motivator, greed, was as powerful to Boston's blue bloods as it was t o the English. This greed is the reason the drug trade continues today, and why the Western world, specifically America and Europe, is experien cing a drug epidemic. Ironically, it is the former victims of American an d European colonial- ism that are now exporting the drugs to their ex-co lonial overlords."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"242 From the Sacred to the Profane The British and American traders who took part in w hat was called the China trade often had little the Chinese were w illing to buy. The Chinese wanted silver and raw Indian cotton, and Am erica and Europe wanted tea. An exception to the rule was ginseng; A merica's ginseng, produced in New England and the Appalachian region, was regarded as an aphrodisiac in China. But the market for ginseng was too small to balance America's demand for tea. There were two al ternatives. The first was opium. The Chinese were already consumers of op ium for almost a thousand years, but they had brewed it into tea. Like many other nat- ural drugs, the opium tea did not cause the debilit ating effects that opium smoking and opium derivatives caused. Similar ly, the effect of chewing coca leaves on the Andean population of Sou th America had some negative side effects, but nothing like the da mage caused by addiction to the refined version of the plant, coca ine. In both cases the refinement of a natural plant created a substance t hat caused addiction. The Europeans created the opium addiction. Shortly after discov- ering the pleasures of tobacco in the American colo nies, the Dutch brought the new commodity to China; the Dutch most likely intro- duced both tobacco and opium smoking. The horrors o f addiction quickly became known to the Chinese. In 1729 Chines e Emperor Yung Cheng prohibited the sale and use of opium in his c ountry as anything but medicine. When the British East India Company a ssumed control over Bengal and Bihar, the opium-producing district s of India, it greatly expanded the trade. By 1767 the company was importi ng two thousand chests, each filled with 170 pounds of pure opium, each year. As in America, the British established trade monopo lies. The Indian growers, by law, had to sell to the British East In dia Company. But the British love of profit was no match for the Chinese edict, and the com- pany could no longer sell to China. Instead, the Br itish East India Company became the middleman that bought the opium from the Indian producers and sold to English and American m erchants who were willing to run the risk of shipping the produc t. In 1799 the Chinese emperor Kia King made all opium trade ille- gal. This very act most likely served to increase t he profits that were"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"The Opium Brotherhood 243 made in the trade, as both the price of opium and t he amount con- sumed increased. The British Levant Company, anothe r nationally char- tered business syndicate, purchased half the Turkis h opium crop and brought it to Europe, where it was sold as medicine . British and American ships participated in the trad e by carrying goods that were attractive to Turkey and India, lik e tin, lead, and wool. They carried the opium to China, where thousands of pounds of the drug filled chests that were exchanged for tea, spi ces, and exotic goods. Another product the Chinese wanted was fur. This pr ovided a lever for the Americans to lift the British monopoly on t he China trade. John Jacob Astor's ships were among the first to sail to the Pacific Northwest, where they harvested the coats of seals and otters. Although the Native tribes had hunted the wildlife for centuries, it to ok only a few years for the hunting to drive the populations to the point o f near extinction. This, in turn, made the hunt more expensive. America as a nation did not sanction the buying and selling of opium, but it did not forbid it either. The America n participants in this trade did nothing illegal as far as their own count ry was concerned. They were, however, breaking Chinese law, as it was ille gal to distribute opium there. Like the British, the Americans could rely o n their country to invoke protective policy when China attempted to en force its law. Both Britain and the United States maintained a naval pr esence to protect their commerce. China, which had no navy, was unable to e nforce its laws on its coastline. British and American traders took ad vantage by occupying Asian islands, where they kept warehouses. Without ships or a coast guard, China could not approach the islands. Just in case of the unlikely inspec- tion by a Chinese mandarin assigned to customs duty , the opium was usually kept aboard floating warehouses—ships that would not make voy- ages but simply float off the coasts of the occupie d islands. From these warehouse ships Chinese merchants bought opium and smuggled it into Canton or the interior of China. Remarkably, the opium trade was officially prohibit ed by the British government, but the prohibition was ignored as the government- chartered British East India Company profited from the trade. The"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"244 From the Sacred to the Profane partners of the company were the elite of a nation that could simply outlaw competition and disregard the country's own laws. Henry Dundas, the Viscount Melville, was a political boss in Scotland, and his number one goal was to enrich the aristocrats. In S cotland he restored the lands of the nobles. In the United Kingdom he s tarted the Scottish control over the British East India Company, which had no Scottish directors prior to the eighteenth century. Dundas s erved as president of the company's board from 1793 to 1801. Outside the British Isles he interfered with business from America to Asia. He w rote the blueprint for opium trade with China, and in 1809 was the hea d of the Board of Control of India. He stocked the Indian subcontinen t with friends, all Scots who governed Britain's crown jewel. The Chine se laws could not be changed but they could be rendered insignificant by circumventing the restrictions. Dundas's cronies used \"country sh ips\" carrying opium bought from British India, which were accompanied a nd protected by British East India Company ships. The company would buy tea with the proceeds from the opium sales. The company allo wed Americans into the marketplace, and English bankers often ass isted them in financ- ing the voyages. The Dundas family was steeped in Masonry, and the t radition car- ries into later times. Thomas Dundas, the second Ea rl of Zetland, became grand master in 1844 and remained in that po st until 1870. The Dundas clan brought Masonry to Hong Kong, and the f irst lodge in that city, chartered in 1846, was named for their l odge in England: the Zetland Lodge No. 525. LORDS AND DRUG LORDS At the same time that England defended its right to distribute opium in China, it took to restricting the drug business at home. The govern- ment began monitoring the pharmaceutical houses tha t were expand- ing the use of opium in Europe.

These families built dynasties th at are still in power today, while millions of Chinese became addicted to opium. 5 The first families of the opium trade joined togeth er in small part- nerships. William Jardine and James Matheson formed the opium-trading firm of Jardine and Matheson while still in their t wenties. Opium was their prime business, and they published regular ne wsletters called the Opium Circulars, which gave information about the d rug's markets and prices. A Brit posted in East Asia could pick up a newspaper anywhere from Patna to Singapore to get the current opium pr ices for Bengal and Patna opium. In this way Britain could claim to be adhering to Chinese policy, and Jardine and Matheson replaced the Briti sh East India Company as the largest trading firm in the empire. But they were fully aware of the horrors addiction brought to China. Da vid Matheson, a young partner, assured of nearly unlimited wealth a t an early age, chose to resign rather than to profit from the drug trade . Jardine and Matheson's early success was the result of working in close cooperation with the British East India Compa ny. The British East India Company had a monopoly on tea, which was legal until 1833. When Britain officially agreed not to ship op ium, Jardine and Matheson—headquartered in Hong Kong—provide the loo phole by bringing in the drug. The British East India Compan y was provided with tea, but its ships did not actually carry the opium. The drug was still packaged with company seals to ensure its qua lity, however.

The Barings fi nanced many American firms in various businesses, including the Binghams and Stephen Girard. Girard, like Astor, was an early pi oneer of the China trade, but he was quickly eclipsed by New England m erchants. The British had the early lead in the importation o f opium and were often the target of Chinese legislation and ac tivity. This is why the British allowed American ships to enter the trade a nd often financed them. In this way the British were not directly bre aking China's prohi- bition, but the British lenders and shippers would make money from their investments in the American ships. THE PROFITS OF THE CHINA TRADE The British families had been benefiting from the t rade for a century, but the Americans caught up quickly. To the chagrin of the British, the Americans went to Turkey to buy lower-grade opium t hat competed with the better British-grown Indian grades. Americ ans proved them- selves adept at smuggling and grew wealthy from the trade. A recent book called The Wealthy 100 created a uniq ue ranking of Americans by wealth and the proportion of that weal th in relation to the gross national product. John Jacob Astor, born in 1763, ranked third; Stephen Girard, born in 1750, was fourth; Elias Has ket Derby, born in 1739, was number 38; smuggler John Hancock, born in 1737, was num- ber 54; and the not as well known Thomas Handasyd P erkins, born in 1764, was ranked number 78. 6 While opium traders Astor and Girard ranked much higher, Thomas Perkins was even more in fluential, as he brought scores of American blue bloods into the tra de."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"The Opium Brotherhood 247 THE HOUSE THAT PERKINS BUILT Thomas Perkins deserves credit for being one of Ame rica's first and foremost opium dealers, as well as one of the great est drug smugglers in history. His amazing fortune places him ahead, in c omparable dollars, of even the computer billionaires of the 1990s. Perkin s's wealth made him a very influential man in American politics and the power behind the Boston Brahmin class. Old reports state that the fi rst families of Boston were from Salem, which implies they made their fort unes in shipping. What is not often understood is that these first fa milies all made their start in the opium trade. The Appletons, Cabots, En dicotts, Hoopers, Higginsons, Jacksons, Lowells, Lawrences, Phillipse s, and Saltonstalls made their money by being related to Thomas Perkins or by riding on the coattails of the mercantile prince. Not only did these families create wealth, but also they then cre- ated industries that survived and prospered for dec ades to come. One industry was insurance. The Perkinses understood th e value of spread- ing risk; they would often be financed in part by t he first families of New England, who wanted their share of the area's m ost lucrative trade, and in part by insurance. Marine insurance is regarded as the grandfather of all modern forms of insurance in America, and it got its start in New England insuring cargo from basic commodities to slaves and opium. Connecticut was home to some of America's first ins urance companies. Many have survived intact or as parts of larger com panies, though few realize their foundation was insuring the drug and slave traders in the early nineteenth century. Born in 1764, Thomas Perkins decided early that Har vard was not where he would seek his fortune. Instead he apprent iced with shipping merchants and his older brother, James, who was in the Santo Domingo—New England part of the triangle trade. Tho mas married Sarah Elliot, whose father was a British tobacco trader, and through his new fam- ily connections made his start in business aboard o ne of Elias Derby's ships.

Today he is regarded a s America's first mil- lionaire and a trailblazer of global commerce. Derb y's father started their business importing sugar from the West Indies . Because this was made illegal by Britain's restrictive trade acts, i t was a fine sort of revenge that led Derby into privateering against Br itish cargo ships dur- ing the Revolution. While many succumbed to the ris ks, Derby pros- pered. In the postwar period his ships sailed aroun d the world, and his Grand Turk was the first New England ship to reach the Chinese port of Canton, in 1785. Thomas Perkins sailed as the su percargo, the person responsible for transacting the ship's business, wi th the ship commanded by Captain James Magee, who was related to Derby's wife. Perkins was responsible for obtaining a good price for the cargo on board the ship. He would then take the proceeds, in whatever form, and invest them in a suitable cargo to bring home. The trade was not always direct, which made the job of the supercargo even m ore important. Often the supercargo would receive instructions to buy and sell in any way deemed necessary to ensure the owner's profit. On slave ships the captain and supercargo often conspired to abandon s ome of the crew in order to increase the share of the profits for thos e who remained. The Perkins family had little problem with the mora lity—or lack of morality—of the trade, as its previous business was the slave and sugar trade in Santo Domingo. In 1792 a slave insurrectio n in that country ruined the Perkinses' business, so James and Thomas formed a new part- nership as J. and T. H. Perkins. It did not take mo re than one successful voyage to become wealthy, and the many successful P erkins voyages made Thomas both wealthy and powerful. For the crew who traveled on a Perkins ship, life w as not as com- fortable or as lucrative. In 1814 Charles Tyng was a thirteen-year-old who had run away from school. Colonel Thomas Perkin s, who received his title by serving in the Massachusetts militia, took the boy aboard a China-bound ship; Thomas's brother had married the boy's aunt. If the four-foot eight-inch teenager had expected any bene fits from being related to the wealthy shipowner, he soon found out the opposite was true. His uncle John Higginson was supercargo aboar d the ship, and the"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"The Opium Brotherhood 249 first words young Charles heard from him were instr uctions to the car- penter to beat the boy. Tyng was beaten daily for m inor infractions, for not knowing his way about the ship, and for the amu sement of those in charge. He was thrown in the hog pen as punishment. Tyng was even denied adequate clothing for the passage around Cap e Horn, and he was handed over to three unusually obese women, wiv es of a Hawaiian king, for their sexual amusement. Charles Tyng surv ived his brief stint working for his uncles, and after being twice cheat ed by them later, he left their employ. Tyng left his memoirs preserving the tales of the opium trade and of the Perkinses' role. 7 The other men aboard the Perkinses' ship fared bett er, but the ship was underprovisioned and ran out of food on the way to Canton. This also happened on the return trip. The ship's owners netted four hun- dred thousand dollars for their efforts, or lack th ereof, as they sat home in New England. While today the memoirs of New England's first fami lies and the museums dedicated to those clans downplay the role of opium and black slaves in building New England's fortunes, th eir involvement in those trades is undeniable. Shippers could fare wel l carrying tobacco and cotton to Rotterdam and London, but fortunes we re built on trad- ing opium for tea in China. Salem's wives had grown fond of Chinese lacquer furniture and Eastern silk gowns, 8 and when the East India Marine Hall opened, Asian dress was the order of th e evening. Smuggling opium had its rewards, and both T H. Perk ins and opium kingpin Joseph Russell became extremely prominent m erchants as a result of their shipping businesses. Their wealth g ave them power and access to government. Perkins and Russell traveled to France to carry out their ventures and to act on behalf of their co untry during the Monroe administration. During the War of 1812, Russ ell was made charge d'affaires of the United States at the Court of Saint James's. Perkins was a principal member of the Federalist pa rty and was elected to the Senate eight times. He was also the president of the Boston branch of the United States Bank (in which p ost he was suc- ceeded by a Cabot). Perkins made his money from the opium trade"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"250 From the Sacred to the Profane before the drug business led to open war in China, and invested the profits into sawmills, gristmills, textiles, and th e railroad business— including the Boston and Lowell, the Boston and Pro vidence, and other railroads farther west. With his combined interests , Perkins was soon considered the wealthiest man in New England. Many New England family fortunes began with investments in the Perki ns China ventures. As a community leader, Perkins did what many slave traders, drug smugglers, and robber barons would do: He became a philanthropist. His charities included the Perkins Institute for th e Blind and Massachusetts General Hospital. 9 As Thomas Perkins devoted himself to European affai rs and his business interests in New England, he turned over t he day-to-day responsibilities of opium trafficking to his relati ves. His children also made connections through marriage, wedding Cabots, Gardiners, Higginsons, Forbeses, and Cushings. THE CUSHING INHERITANCE While relationships to the Perkins business and fam ily were the start of many fortunes, they were also the start of several political careers. One of the most powerful political families that had ti es to the Perkinses were the Cushings. In China the Boston-based Cushing family soon becam e responsi- ble for operating the Perkins family business. Thom as Cushing was already an active merchant during the eighteenth ce ntury. As a busi- nessman, Cushing would sometimes collect intelligen ce on the Tories, but he was reluctant to share it. He was against th e Revolution, as he feared it would interfere with his shipping busines s. But Cushing over- came his fears when he found that he could make a f ortune overcharg- ing both the Americans and the French for supplies. Such excessive profiteering was shared by Otis and Gerry, and even smaller merchants did not consider it wrong to gouge the military. Chief among a cadre of Thomas Cushings nephews was John Perkins Cushing, who started out as the head of the American hong, or"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"The Opium Brotherhood 251 house of foreign trade, in Canton. John Cushing's m other was Ann Perkins, and her connections would allow him access to wealth known to very few. After the early death of his mother, y oung Cushing was raised by T. H. Perkins. John Cushing started his career in the countinghous e of the Perkins home office, but was sent to Canton at age seventee n to further his edu- cation. A year later he was in charge of the Canton branch, the epicen- ter of Perkins's profit machine. Cushing developed an early friendship with one of China's most powerful merchants, Houqua , who was head of the Cohong, the community of Chinese merchants. The friendship of Houqua meant everything for a foreign merchant. Soon Cushing was regarded as the most influential American in Canton . Cushing stayed in Canton for twenty-five years and increased his personal wealth by buying ships and shares in ships . In 1830 he retired from the China trade and sold his own interests. He returned to New England, where he married Louisa Gardiner and built city mansions and country estates for himself. But he never fully retired, as he made investments in the Chinese voyages of others. Cushi ng's family wealth was earned entirely in drug trafficking with China, and his descendants ensured that the trade did not end. Caleb Cushing was the heir apparent. A graduate of Harvard at the age of seventeen, Caleb Cushing became a lawyer and represented the family's interests. He also became a thirty-third-d egree Mason. Caleb Cushing's political career started in the Hou se of Representatives, and after the suspicious death of William Henry Harrison in 1843, Cushing was sent by the new presi dent Tyler to China as U.S. Commissioner. In China, Cushing did m ore to represent the Perkins-Cushing interests in the opium-smugglin g business than the interests of his country. China, beaten by the British navy in the war, lacked the ability to stand up to the threats of Cushing. The coun- try granted American ships the use of five ports. Cushing went on to promote war against Mexico, plot with seces- sionists, and conspire against Zachary Taylor. The death of Taylor elevated Cushing to attorney general of the United States."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"252 From the Sacred to the Profane THE STURGIS FAMILY At the same time that John Perkins Cushing was begi nning his career in the opium trade, another Perkins relative was al so achieving success. The Sturgises were one of the first families of Mas sachusetts, claiming descent from Edward Sturgis, who arrived in 1630. T he family started in farming, but the marriage of Russell Sturgis to Elizabeth Perkins, Thomas's sister, ensured the Sturgis family's fortu ne in the shipping business. Thomas Perkins would invest with Russell Sturgis in the Hope, and Sturgis set sail for China. Meanwhile, one of Russell's sons, James Perkins Stu rgis, was sent to the island of Lintin, just outside of Hong Kong, to manage the storage facilities for all the opium traders. Because opium importing was ille- gal, Lintin served as what might be called a drop h ouse—a large termi- nal for all the ships carrying opium. As the Sturgis family wealth grew, Nathaniel Russel l Sturgis teamed up with George Robert Russell, who started Russell and Company, the most important opium-trafficking firm of the 1830s. A Russell Sturgis headed Barings Bank, which financed the opium trade . The women in the Sturgis clan did their part as well. Elizabeth Perkins Sturgis married Henry Grew, and their daughter, Jane, married J. P. Morgan's only son, John Pierpont Morgan. RUSSELL AND COMPANY As the China trade expanded in the 1830s, the most important shipping family was Samuel Russell's. A latecomer to the bus iness, Samuel Russell founded Russell and Company in 1823. He dir ected the com- pany's ships to Smyrna in Turkey to buy opium; the ships then brought the opium to China. The company grew by hiring the right people and by buying out their competitors. Russell's chief of operations in Canton was Warren Delano Jr., the grandfather of future president Franklin Roosevelt. Russell partners who contributed funds to mount his overseas venture s included John"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"The Opium Brotherhood 253 Cleve Green, who financed Princeton, and Abiel Abbo t Low, who financed construction at Columbia University in New York. 10 The Russell family had a tremendous influence at Ya le, and their relationship continues to the present day. Yale was originally called the Collegiate School. In early colonial times Elihu Ya le served with the British East India Company. He made a fortune with the company and became governor of Madras in India in 1687. Later i n life Yale gave away much of his wealth, and Cotton Mather renamed the Collegiate School in Yale's honor in 1718. Joseph Coolidge was another Russell investor, as we re members of the Perkins, Sturgis, and Forbes families. The Perk inses and Russells were soon united in a merger. Coolidge's son organi zed United Fruit, which kept the colonial interests of many of New En gland's influential families tied together. His grandson, Archibald C. Coolidge, was a founder of the Council on Foreign Relations. 11 Samuel Russell's cousin William Huntington Russell set up a trust a Yale that created a unique organization of elite families under the name of the Skull and Bones. Russell's cofounder wa s Alfonso Taft. The Skull and Bones is a very secretive order that admi ts only fifteen new members each year. Prominent families that have bee n part of this organization include the Harrimans, Bushes, Kerrys, Tafts, Whitneys, Bundys, Weyerhaeusers, Pinchots, Goodyears, Sloanes , Stimsons, Phelpses, Pillsburys, Kelloggs,Vanderbilts, and Lov etts. While the Russell shipping empire became one of the greatest and most far-reaching, there is still one more New Engl and family that played a significant role in the trade. THE FORBES CLAN When the Cushings left China, the Forbes family too k over operations. The Forbeses were not the first in the opium trade with China, but they brought drug smuggling to its highest level of prof itability and left a legacy that extends into modern times. The Forbes family roots reach well back into Scotla nd, where they"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"254 From the Sacred to the Profane can be traced to at least the thirteenth century. S ir Alexander Forbes, the first Lord Forbes, was granted lands in 1423 and wa s made a lord of Parliament in 1445. Incessant warfare in both Scoda nd and England made loyalty to the king precarious. Well before the mas sive Scottish immigra- tion after Culloden in 1745, the Forbeses, who were Protestants (and therefore not Jacobites), were already situated in Massachusetts and con- nected with the families that would become American \"aristocracy.\" As with the Gardiners and others illicit traders, the fortune accumulated by the Forbeses in opium trading was invested in land and industry. John and Robert Forbes would lead the way to the family fort une. John Murray Forbes (1813-1898), the son of Ralph Be nnet Forbes and Margaret Perkins Forbes, started his business c areer at age fifteen in the Boston countinghouse of bis uncles James and Th omas Perkins. John Forbes was soon allowed to travel to Canton to repr esent the Perkins syn- dicate, and he stayed for seven years. In 1837, at the age of twenty-four, Forbes returned from Canton so wealthy that he coul d finance the con- struction of several railroads, including the Michi gan Central Railroad, which he bought unfinished and extended to Lake Mic higan and Chicago. Forbes became a prime mover, leading a group of cap italists who could raise millions to complete acquisitions of co mpanies. Many had previously invested with Forbes in the China trade, and they remained grateful for and loyal because of the fortunes they had reaped. Forbes continued to extend the Michigan Central's service, to Detroit and into Canada, and he built other railways including the H annibal and Saint Joseph Railroad in Missouri and the Chicago, Burlin gton, and Quincy Railroad, of which he served as president. NAUSHON ISLAND Following the lesson of Gardiner, John Forbes bough t an island where he could conduct business isolated from the prying eyes of neighbors. Like Gardiner's Island, the island of Naushon, just south of the Woods Hole area of Cape Cod, served as a protectorate for smugglers for as long as Massachusetts was a colony. The shifting sa ndbars and the isola-"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"The Opium Brotherhood 255 tion from the active ports of the New England coast protected many lawbreaking merchants. The island first belonged to one of Massachusetts's most elite fam- ilies, the Winthrops. There is little evidence that they were involved in the merchant trade. John Winthrop, the leader of se ven hundred Puritans, was the first of the family who came to A merica. John Winthrops idea of religion was that it was somethin g to be imposed on others. The Taliban form of Islam is an apt compari son to the religious vision of John Winthrop. Puritans made it a crime t o miss church, to dance, to sing, and to celebrate Christmas; likewis e, the Taliban made it a crime to miss prayers, to dance, to sing, and to celebrate (as opposed to observe) Islamic festival days. Both fundamental ist groups punished their people with torture and humiliation. As governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Winthr op opposed democracy as well, believing his colony should be g overned by a hand- ful of pious leaders. Fleeing religious persecution apparently did not mean that Winthrop would hesitate to persecute othe rs, and in America's first incidence of religious persecution, he banished Anne Hutchinson from the colony. Such elitism pervaded t he thinking of the rulers of Massachusetts up to—and even after—the Am erican Revolution. The second family to own the island was the Bowditc hes. They would never enjoy the power of the Winthrops or the wealth of the Forbeses, but the Bowditches were industrious seafa rers and the family was very well connected with Massachusetts blue blo ods. William Bowditch sailed to America in the seventeenth centu ry, when the fam- ily began making its living from the sea. Habakkuk Bowditch, a son who began a career at sea in the mid-eighteenth cen tury, lost two ships and two sons to the sea and had taken up the cooper trade when his fourth son, Nathaniel, achieved long-lasting fame. Born in 1773 in Salem, Nathaniel enjoyed mathematics more than anyt hing else, and this skill would revive the family's status. Even w hile in his teens, Nathaniel was renowned for his knowledge of mathema tics and lan- guages, to the point that others brought him books to further his"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"256 From the Sacred to the Profane education. He spoke French, Spanish, and German and understood Latin, and he even studied two dozen other language s. Remarkably, he found an error in Newton's Principia. During the Revolution a privateer from Beverly capt ured a ship carrying the library of a noted Irish scholar. A gr oup of merchants bought the books and housed them in the Philosophic al Library, where Nathaniel Bowditch could continue his mostly self-t aught education. Despite his widespread reputation, he still had to go to sea to make his fortune. Bowditch worked as a supercargo and made f ive voyages and a huge fortune, while at the same time making lunar c alculations to nav- igate without the use of a chronometer. Legendary s tatus came when Bowditch navigated into Salem Harbor during a blind ing snowstorm. 12 He combined his book knowledge and practical experi ence to enhance the ability of American merchants to navigate their own country. Bowditch rewrote the American Coastal Pilot and the n later produced his own book, The New American Practical Navigator, whi ch served as a tool for navigating treacherous American waters until th e government took over the responsibility fifty years later. 13 Bowditch's premier work is simply referred to as \"Bowditch\" by sailors; it rem ains a classic in the field. Since 1802 it has been reprinted in seventy editions. Bowditch, who married his cousin Mary Ingersoll, re fused mathe- matics chairs at several universities, including Ha rvard, the University of Virginia, and West Point, instead preferring his po sition as president of the Essex Fire and Marine Insurance Company. 14 At the entrance to Buzzards Bay, Naushon, the Bowdi tches' private island, was more of an island kingdom than a summer home. When Kidd rushed around planting his treasure, Naushon's Tarpaulin Cove and Gardiner's Island were his last stops. In the y ears preceding the Revolution, the cove served as a hiding place where smugglers could wait to unload their merchandise. A lighthouse was built on Naushon just before the R evolutionary War to protect the ships navigating the shoals. Dur ing the Revolution it served as a meeting place for privateers. James Bowditch, Nathaniel's brother, fought the government's efforts to improve the lighthouse, as"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"The Opium Brotherhood 257 guests were unwanted. When James died in 1817, an i mproved light- house was erected. At this point the Bowditch famil y, which had owned Naushon for more than a century, sold the island to the Forbeses. Since then the \"kingdom\" has been in the hands of various Forbes family members and trusts. THE FORBES FAMILY AND NAUSHON ISLAND John Murray Forbes married into another first famil y of New England when he wed Sarah Hathaway of New Bedford. Their fi ve children included William Hathaway Forbes, who married Edith Emerson (a rel- ative of Ralph Waldo Emerson's) and became presiden t of the newly formed Bell Telephone, John Malcolm Forbes, and Mar y Hathaway Forbes, who married a Russell. The Hathaway, Forbes, and Perkins families were uni ted in a merger with Russell and Company even before John and Sarah Forbes were united in marriage. Money from the opium trade and later investments ensured the prominence of the family for generation s to come. The grandson of John Murray Forbes, William Cameron For bes, was appointed by Teddy Roosevelt as governor general of the Philippines, and was later appointed to a post in Asia by Presid ent Harding. John Forbes's brother was Robert Bennet Forbes (180 4-1889), who was known as \"Black Ben\" Forbes. His historical bio graphy notes his exploits as a sea captain in the China trade but ig nores his involvement in the opium business. At age thirteen Robert Forbe s sailed for his uncles to China, and at age twenty-four, when Perkins and Russell merged their companies to form the most powerful American house in China, young Robert secured the lucrative post of running the Li ntin operation. Forbes left China in 1834 to marry Rose Green Smith , and he almost lost his fortune in the Panic of 1837. Seeki ng to rebuild his wealth, Forbes went back to China and played a prom inent role in the outbreak of the Opium War, during which Russell and Company pros- pered. Forbes was made the head of the company, rep lacing John C. Green. By 1850 Forbes owned interests in more than sixty ships and"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"258 From the Sacred to the Profane was the American vice-consul to China and France. I n his later life Forbes was noted for his contribution to the U.S. N avy during the Civil War, and he became the first commodore of the Bosto n Yacht Club. THE SYNDICATE The early shipping business was unusually risky and the loss of a single ship was a disaster to some companies. Often the wa y to spread the risk was to \"syndicate\" the business so that merchants t ook shares in one another's companies. In addition to the Perkins and Russell syndicates, a third syndicate drew in some important personages . Augustine Heard was an Ipswich merchant whose fathe r partici- pated in the often illegal molasses and sugar trade . He too relished the thought of getting revenge on the harsh and restric tive trade laws that favored the home country at the expense of the colo nies, so he became a privateer. Heard started his career in the counti nghouse and then became a supercargo. In 1807 he sailed to Smyrna ab oard the Betsy. 15 The Heard Company started by selling ginseng and ot ter skins but soon joined the opium trade. Heard's partners included J ohn Forbes, John Green, and Joseph Coolidge. The American base of the opium trade moved south fr om the ports of New England to New York.

Ships an d ware- houses lined South Street's three-mile-long stretch of piers a few short blocks from Wall Street's Tontine Coffee House, whi ch served as the center of the growing financial industry. The water front was so busy that spectators came to watch the hustle of dockwor kers, shipbuilders, and auctioneers. Hammers clanged, barrels rolled, a uctioneers shouted, and thousands worked hard building and loading ship s. Skilled labor was so in demand that a sail maker was paid a previ ously unheard of four dollars a day. Ships sailed from New York to all ports. Similar to New England's Brahmin families, many New York families achieved g reat wealth in the drug trade. American shippers had as many excuses f or involvement in the trade as their British counterparts. And like t he British, the Americans had less to offer as exports, and the new country became the dumping ground for British wares. The American fami lies brought to China ginseng, furs, and opium, their only valued g oods. It should be noted that the trade was not illegal i n the United States. What has become labeled the \"China trade,\" which included tea and opium, furs, and furniture, reduces the stigma that might be per- ceived in modern times. Not all of the China trader s carried opium, and their activity was not considered criminal. The laws that were 259 D"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"260 From the Sacred to the Profane broken were only those of another nation's, a commo n enough attitude in colonial expansionist times. Although the morali ty of the opium trade was questioned by a handful, both the British and American gov- ernments had no quarrel with any aspects of the Chi na trade. NEW YORK'S WEALTHIEST CITIZEN America's richest opium smuggler was possibly John Jacob Astor. In 1800 Astor was worth $250,000 when the average Amer ican family had an income of $750. When he died in 1848 his wealth was equal to almost 1 percent of the entire country's gross nati onal product. 1 Astor's wealth was made in numerous ways, but his o pium fortune was a direct result of the British East India Compa ny's granting him a license to sell furs to China and to engage in the opium trade. The fur business was soon abandoned in all but name. In 181 6 Astor's American Fur Company actually sailed directly to Turkey to b uy ten tons of opium, which was then sold illegally in Canton. Astor's rapid rise to great wealth is an unlikely s tory. The son of a German butcher, Astor came to America in 1784 at ag e twenty-one. He reportedly spoke very little English, although he h ad lived for a short time in London. He is described as having no grace, charm, or wit; he is even said to have once wiped his hands on the ta ble linens at a din- ner party. Yet Astor's gruff manners and poor Engli sh did not stop him from rapidly entering society. He quickly married i nto wealth and breeding in the form of Sarah Todd of New York's Br eevort family. 2 This connection most likely prompted his invitation to join New York's most prestigious Masonic lodge, the Holland No. 8. Here he mingled with Archibald Russell, the Livingstons, De Witt Cl inton and George Clinton, and members of New York's other first fami lies. The Holland No. 8 Lodge was founded in 1787 after n egotiating with the Masons to be allowed to hold meetings in t he Low Dutch lan- guage. At first the new lodge admitted only eight m embers. The num-"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Opium: From the Lodge to the Den 261 ber 8 is significant to elite Masonry: There were e ight original Templar knights, there are eight points on the Masonic cros s, and there were eight prominent and wealthy New Yorkers in the new lodge. From his new connections Astor discovered the lucra tive fur pelt business. Pelts that could be bought for a dollar f rom a New York Indian could fetch six times the price in London. 3 Astor typically cheated the Indians by getting them drunk and then overcharging for the liquor. 4 He cheated his own workers with low-paying contract s, although his own records show he was more generous in bribes: He once made a thirty-five-thousand-dollar payment to Michigan Gov ernor Lewis Cass. 5 In short, Astor prospered in the fur business. Astor's proceeds from the fur trade were invested i nto New York City real estate during the year Washington was ele cted president and New York was in recession. And Astor instinctively knew how to take advantage of people. For example, when Aaron Burr s hot Alexander Hamilton in a duel, Burr had to flee the country an d so Astor bought Burr's Greenwich Village home for cash. In 1825 Ast or bought land from the U.S. government and immediately evicted se ven hundred farmers. Astor's China connections were made through his fur business, as the Chinese bought beaver pelts that Astor's trappe rs and traders took from New York and the Oregon territory. He was the first New York merchant to join the China trade, and soon he repla ced the furs with opium. In 1807 New York City entered another recession as the Embargo Act stopped shipping. A letter from Punqua Wingchon g, a visiting Chinese merchant and a mandarin connected to the ru ling family in China, claimed the embargo had stranded him in New York City and requested permission from President Jefferson to be allowed to sail home. Jefferson made an exception and asked on what ship he intended to sail. Punqua Wingchong requested the Beaver, an Astor ship. The ship left New York with Punqua Wingchong and a hull full of furs. When it returned Jefferson discovered that Punqua Wingchong was not a mer- chant but a dockhand, and the voyage was a ruse cre ated by Astor. The"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"262 From the Sacred to the Profane Beaver made a two-hundred-thousand-dollar profit fr om the trip. The profit was put into still another farm, which e xtended from Broadway to the Hudson in midtown New York. 6 But the American government got even when it went to war with Britai n. Astor lost his fur capital in Astoria, Oregon, which was worth eig ht hundred thou- sand dollars. Nevetheless, Astor's drug business grew unhindered. In writing he requested that a Constantinople merchant \"please se nd returns in opium\" for a consignment of 1,500 red fox furs. 7 With three separate fleets sailing the world, Astor made enough drug an d pelt money to dip into an immense amount of real estate. By 1826 the German immigrant who made his fortune in America was buying the mort gages of Irish immigrants and foreclosing on them to add to his ho ldings at lower prices. 8 In 1847 Moses Yale Beach compiled a list of the wea lthiest New Yorkers. Some had a million or two; Astor towered a bove them. 9 Astor stopped at nothing to increase his fortune. In 1848 he was eighty-four years old and extremely wealthy, yet he still deman ded rent even from widows. He died in March of that year, and his seco nd son, William Backhouse Astor, inherited most of his father's twe nty-million-dollar fortune. John Jacob Astor's son learned well. In the 1860s, when working- class New Yorkers were going through a severe econo mic depression, officers of a Russian fleet docked in New York rais ed $4,760 to buy fuel for the poor. William Astor, however, raised rents 30 percent. 10 When he died in 1875, he owned seven hundred buildings and houses—most of them crammed with poor tenants. His legacy is the m ultitude of slums where the poor starved. Yet the Astor name still gr aces communities from Queens in New York to Oregon.

Originally based in East Lyme, a small port on the Long Island Sound coast of Connecticut, the Gri swold brothers ran an empire. Their black-and-white-checkered flag was seen in China, the West Indies, and South America. Although the Griswo lds have not become a household name in subsequent centuries, ma ny family mem- bers achieved prominence as a result of trading in the eighteenth cen- tury. The Griswolds' agent in Canton was Russell an d Company, in which a Griswold relative was a partner. Nathaniel Griswold was content to be a merchant, bu t his brother George had greater ambitions. George was a director of Columbia Insurance, was involved in the Bank of America, and dabbled in other ventures including gold mining. Other family member s also made the merchant connection. For example, Nathaniel's daugh ter Catherine married Peter Lorillard, New York's first tobacco m erchant. The Griswolds played a role in early American polit ics, as Matthew Griswold was brought to the position of Federalist governor of Connecticut through family money. Future Griswolds served in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate as pol iticians for Connecticut and Pennsylvania. John D. Lodge, the gr eat-great-grandson of sea trader George Griswold III, was Connecticut' s governor from 1951 to 1955. Still other Griswolds became captains of industry, bish- ops, and college professors.

The Low Family The Low family was a group of Massachusetts merchan ts that moved to New York. Seth Low was born on Cape Ann in 1782. He moved at an early age to Salem, where he earned his living as a trader and a mer- chant. In Tall Ships to Cathay Helen Augur mentions that Seth Low married Mary Porter, which connected the Lows with the prominent Lord family. Seth had twelve children, and as the S alem area was losing its importance, he moved his family to New York. Th ere Seth and his brother William Henry Low, a senior partner in Russ ell and Company, helped expand the American role in the trade that R ussell inherited from the Perkins syndicate.

Seth Low the yo unger is famous for donating a million dollars, supposedly one third of his fortune, to build the Low Library at Columbia. Abiel Low, who married Ellen Almira Dow, had a daug hter also named Ellen, who in 1869 married into the Pierrepon t family—which would later be known as the Pierpont family. The Pi erpont and Morgan families were eventually united and played a signif icant role in the development of American finance. The House of Morgan was actually started by China t rader George Peabody. Described as a solitary miser, Peabody nev ertheless joined forces with Barings Bank to get American states to pay on their bond debts, much of which was in British hands. Barings went as far as to bribe famed statesman Daniel Webster to make speeches on the is sue. Peabody bought the bonds for pennies on the dollar and reaped a fo rtune when they were finally repaid. Like other Salem merchants, he amas sed great wealth in the China trade and invested in railroads. Because he w as heirless, Peabody gave his money to philanthropic causes, including a library in Salem, and he turned over his company to young Junius Spencer Morgan. Junius Morgan's heir was son J. Pierpont Morgan, whose sta mp on Barings Bank would last for more than a century. 12 The Grinnell Family The Grinnells are another China-trading family whos e origins are sketchy, but they most likely possess a Huguenot ba ckground. Cornelius Grinnell was an American sea captain who became a p rivateer during the American Revolution. He married Sylvia Howland, which estab- lished the Grinnells among New England's first fami lies. Other Grinnells married into Rhode Island's Brown dynasty and into the Russell family.

The Grinnell family roots were in New Bedford, wher e the first of the Greek Revival mansions was built for Joseph. Hi s profits, like those of many other merchants, were put into the textile trade, and he founded the still-in-operation Wamsutta Mills. Vari ous Grinnells later financed polar explorations and rescue missions, pi oneered real-estate development in Key West, and even found a town—Grin nell, Iowa— and its local college (Grinnell College). Howland and Aspinwall Another company that moved from New England to New York during the golden years of the opium trade was Howland and Aspinwall. This merger of two founding families spawned great wealt h for generations to come. John Howland was the first of the clan to travel to America, where he married a fellow Mayflower passenger. John's son , Joseph Howland, started in the whaling business in Connecticut. Jos eph's sons also con- sidered the sea to be a road to wealth and went int o shipping. Howland shipping would take part in the sugar and slave tra de in the Caribbean and in ventures in Cuba, Mexico, and the Mediterran ean before dis- covering the China trade. The Howland children made good matches, with one daughter marrying James Roosevelt and anot her marrying James Brown of Brown Brothers Harriman. The most significant Howland marriage was a busines s merger with the Aspinwall family. Like the Howlands, the Aspinw alls were in the shipping business prior to the American Revolution. Around the turn of the nineteenth century, John Aspinwall married S usan Howland.

Aspinwall was considered both an honest and a pious man, and has been referred to as a visionary. He was a cofounder of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and led America in new ad ventures around the world while he lived quietly in New York . Aspinwall claimed that his Panama Railroad, which w as erected before the famous canal, could be built in six mont hs. Not having trav- eled there himself, he didn't realize that the firs t thirteen miles went through dense jungles and impenetrable swamps fille d with poisonous insects and snakes. From mosquitoes and sand flies to alligators and other hazards, the area was know as a pesthole from the days of Spanish exploration. General Grant, who visited the constru ction site, described the conditions of the rainy season as \"beyond belie f.\" 13 The conditions took their toll on the workers, who often toiled in mud up to their necks, fighting off the swarming in sects from sunrise to sunset. Sickness and disease—including cholera, yellow fever, small- pox, and dysentery—claimed many lives, as did harsh treatment similar to what was enacted on slaves. A commonly told stor y holds that there was a dead Irishman for every railroad tie. Howland and Aspinwall declared the death toll at one thousand, but estima tes actually run up to six thousand. Chinese workers, called coolies, who did hard labor for low wages, were imported. Eight hundred arrived; tw o hundred sur- vived. Many committed suicide by hanging themselves , paying com- panions to stab or shoot them, or simply drowning t hemselves in the ocean. Aspinwall was in New York at the time, where , ironically to modern sensibilities, he helped created the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Like their Boston counterparts, New York's first fa milies used mar- riage to ensure that their wealth and prominence wo uld remain intact.

Claes Martenszen van Roosevelt arrived in America before 1649 and died in 1660. Like John Jacob Astor, Roose velt's only son, Nicholas, got his start in the fur business. He in turn had two sons who split the family into two lines: the Oyster Bay, Ne w York line, from which President Teddy Roosevelt was born, and the H yde Park New York line of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The Oyster Bay branch got most of its wealth from the merchant business; the Hyde Park branch invested primarily in real estate. Membership in the elite societies of their day, inc luding Masonry, and intermarriage increased the Roosevelt family fo rtune. Isaac Roosevelt married into a sugar-trading family, whic h often implied the triangular trade of sugar, molasses, and slaves. Af ter the Molasses Act of 1733, anyone who wouldn't smuggle couldn't survive. The Roosevelts survived and prospered, 14 and Isaac's brother James joined the business. Isaac became close with William Walton, and both we re involved in founding the Bank of New York. James would also mak e a connection to the Waltons when he married Maria Walton. Other Roosevelts married Howlands and Aspinwalls, w hich is how they were introduced to the China trade. The Howlan d and Aspinwall families were also active in building clipper ships and later in the steamship and railroad businesses. By the 1820s the Roosevelt clan were more than just wealthy; they were also very well connected. James Roosevelt, son of Rebecca Aspinwall Roosevelt, sat on boards with the Vanderb ilts and J. Pierpont Morgan. James Roosevelt's son James \"Rosy\" Roosevel t became engaged to Helen Schermerhorn Astor. At their engag ement party, one of the guests in attendance was Sara Delano. The Delanos were another of America's first familie s. Descendants of a Huguenot family by the name of de la Noye, who fled Holland for America, they arrived on the Fortune in 1621.

Philip's son, T homas Delano, mar- ried the Alden's daughter, also named Priscilla, al though the couple was fined ten pounds for engaging in intercourse before the wedding. Farther down the family tree, Warren Delano, Frankl in's grandfa- ther, made his fortune in the opium business, start ing through the Grinnell firm. Warren's daughter Sara Delano became the mother of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Sara's sister Dora married a Forbes, and their sister Annie married Fred Hitch, a Russell and Company associate in Shanghai. The Delano family seemed to gravitate toward the se a and the trad- ing business. Warren Delano was an associate of Jam es Roosevelt's father and was a partner in Russell, Sturgis, and Company (also known as Russell and Company at various stages). Warren was the China repre- sentative and owned a mansion in Macao. For a while he retired from opium trading and sank his fortune into New York re al estate and coal and copper mines in Pennsylvania and Tennessee. In August 1857 the failure of the Ohio Life Insuran ce and Trust started a domino effect that wiped out many banks. All but one bank in New York suspended specie payment. By the end of th e year, five thou- sand businesses had failed, tens of thousands of wo rkers had lost their homes and jobs, and people starved and froze to dea th both in the cities and in the coal towns. While his workers died, Warr en lived in Algonac, his estate, complete with high-ceilinged rooms with rosewood furni- ture, teakwood screens, potted plants, and Buddhist bells. Although Warren Delano suffered no loss of creature comforts, his net worth suffered dearly. He was desperate to keep his status and decided to go back to China and the drug-smuggling business; it was the simplest way to rebuild his fortune. \"It would be denied in these later years that the opium he bought and shipped wa s intended for the tremendously profitable market provided by addicts, \" writes Kenneth Davis, who mentions specifically that it was opium, and not tea, that brought wealth along with a touch of notoriety. 15 By this time the New England drug smugglers were bringing the drug to Am erican addicts."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"270 From the Sacred to the Profane The family later claimed that the opium Warren brou ght to America was for the relief of the Civil War wounded, but he returned to China in 1859, which predated the Civil War by two years.

More prominent than his cousin Teddy was, Franklin took his role in Masonry seriously, becoming active in t he Holland No. 8 Lodge in New York City and a Scottish Rite Temple i n Albany. Theodore Roosevelt is famous, of course, as a U.S. president and for leading the charge on San Juan Hill. Roosevelt's pu blic persona depicts him as a \"trustbuster,\" fighting the giant Standard Oil and mediating mining strikes. Despite his Masonic membership, how ever, he was far from egalitarian. He was also closely tied to big b usiness, and was able to raise the necessary corporate donations for his candidacy; his trust- busting activities, though, would leave him at odds with the Rockefeller and Carnegie interests. The twenty-sixth president of the United States is on record as being a racial elitist with an attitude that border ed on favoring ethnic cleansing. He has been quoted as saying, \"Some day we will realize that the prime duty, the inescapable duty of the good ci tizen of the right type is to leave his or her blood behind him in the world; and that we have no business to permit the perpetuation of citi zens of the wrong type.\" He also said, \"I wish very much that the wro ng people could be prevented entirely from breeding...

They had a son Noa h, also a sea cap- tain, who married Rachel Kelly. They also had a son Jesse, who married Hannah Simpson. Jesse and Hannah Grant's son was Ul ysses Simpson Grant, the renowned Civil War general and U.S. pres ident, who married Julia Dent. The Dent family of England ranked alongside the Jar dines and Mathesons in the opium trade, 17 but the prosperity of the trade may not have extended to the American Dents. The Memoirs of Julia Dent Grant mentions her father as a prosperous landowner desce nded from a Maryland plantation owner and her mother's father a s a China trader in the firm of Wrenshall, Peacock, and Pillon. The Ame rican Dents were a New England family who took part in th e early China trade first by exporting ginseng to that country. J ulia Dent's mother and father came to the Midwest to trade along the Missi ssippi River with Edward Tracy. Ulysses Grant was a late bloomer who had drifted do wn to failure and disgrace during his early army career. He drank to the point that he was broke and finally resigned from the army. He failed at farming, failed at selling real estate, and made only a mode st income as a clerk until someone convinced him to return to the milita ry. The Civil War saved his reputation and gained him the presidency of the United States.

The Chinese rapidly became addicted in increasing n umbers.

This figure repres ents 6,630,000 pounds of opium. Soon the addiction reached the roy al palace. Emperor Tao Kwong lost three sons to drug addiction, and it was estimated that China had four to twelve million addicts. 18 The emperor conducted a study of the effects of opium on his country. He wa s told that for the first time his treasury was being drained of silver rather than being resupplied by the tea trade. Brigandage plagued the highways. Soldiers refused to fight, and when coerced to fight against other warlords the soldiers were defeated. It was obvious that corrupt ion was spreading in the army and the civil service. Mandarins were regu larly bribed to allow the importation of illegal products. And at Canton the marketplace was stocked with the apparatus of the opium trade. The emperor ordered a crackdown and numerous drug u sers were arrested. To drive home the emperor's point, an opi um merchant was publicly crucified in Canton. A Chinese boat was ca ught unloading opium believed to have been bought from Thomas Perk ins. At first nothing was done, but then all trade came to a halt . On the day Bennett Forbes became a partner at Russell and Company, he complained that they could not unload a chest of opium. 19 Russell and Company made an announcement that it would cease trading opium. Its agent, John Green, sent instructions to India to stop all opium trading. But it was too late for them and for others. The agent of the emperor, Lin Tse-hsu, surrounded all the British and American ships and s ubjected them to house arrest. He then confiscated twenty thousand c hests of opium and staged the Chinese version of the Boston Tea Party, mixing the opium with lime and throwing it into the water. Russell a nd Company lost 1,400 chests, Jardine and Matheson lost 7,000 chest s, and the British Dent and Company lost 1,700 chests. Even after the destruction of millions of dollars' worth of drugs, the house arrest continued. Wealthy Americans in Ch ina, including Warren Delano, A. A.

Finally the opium debate reached Parliament. States men like William Gladstone decried the trade in opium and it s effect on the Chinese, but in the end the money was the key. The only way to com- pensate the British businessmen for their loss was to declare war on China. The brief war compelled China to sign a trea ty giving the British Hong Kong and access to its markets. THE LEGACY OF THE CHINA TRADE The area that would become Hong Kong replaced the t iny islands and floating warehouses that served as the storage faci lities for opium. From Hong Kong, ships could sail up along the coast and spread opium to even greater numbers of the Chinese population. But along with legal- ity came a decrease in profits. The shipping firm c alled the Peninsula and Oriental Steamship line allowed Chinese buyers to place orders for opium directly with India, eliminating the British middleman. But some companies thrived in the new situation. Fo r the firm of Jardine and Matheson, the Opium War represented a n ew beginning. Made famous by the James Clavell novel Noble House, Jardine and Matheson, the house that opium built, grew and pros pered as a result of having the power of England behind it. Today Simon and Henry Keswick, direct descendants of William Jardine, run the company, which is not known to have broken English or Chinese rule s since the Opium War days. It has its many tentacles in shipping, th e Cunard Line, trad- ing, auto sales, brokerage, engineering, restaurant s and hotels, property investment and management, insurance, and banking. The power Jardine and Matheson once wielded in Lond on is no longer as strong, as the company was unable to pers uade Margaret Thatcher to hang on to Hong Kong. In 1984 Hong Kong was thirteen years away from reverting back to Chinese rule. Jar dine and Matheson moved its exchange listing to Singapore, which infu riated China.

Patten's democratic refor ms, and Henry Keswick's criticism of China after Tiananmen Square in 1989, have kept the relationship tenuous. 20 In 1995 more than half of Jardine's profits were still earned in China and Hong Kong. A competing company from the Persian-English family of Sassoon also had a major part in the China trade. Like thei r Scottish counter- parts the Sassoons brought opium to China, but thei rs was homegrown. Saleh Sassoon was the treasurer to the Ahmet Pasha, or governor of Baghdad. When the pasha was overthrown, the family moved to Bombay. Sassoon's son David became a merchant and w as granted a license to trade in Indian opium and cotton. The Op ium Wars were a brief setback, but David's son Edward Albert brough t opium profits home to England, where he increased the family fort une in the textile trade. Being knighted by the queen was Edward's rew ard for his con- tribution to the economy. And marrying a Rothschild was a means of ensuring his power. THE OPIUM LEGACY IN AMERICA For their part in the drug business the Americans t ook home a lot of money. In 1844 Caleb Cushing created the American t reaty with China, which officially allowed American ships in t he China trade. After the wars in China the drug-smuggling business became more dangerous, as there was Asian competition and there were much faster steamships. British and American firms started brin ging drugs to safer shores—their own. In Britain, the cities of Liverpo ol, Dover, Bristol, and even London were the import drug centers. This was around the time that the attempts to regulate opium use became serious. 21 Between pre- and post-Opium Wars the opium imports in Engla nd tripled to 280,000 pounds. 22 The drug was even prescribed to children in such concoctions as Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup, and u nwed mothers dis- covered it was an easy way to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.

Opium's derivative morphine was soon the c ause of massive addiction of returning Crimean War veterans, who le arned to inject the drug. The drug trade in Europe became widespread, and it was the prod- uct of an alliance between criminal families from v arious nations and Swiss and German pharmaceutical companies. A large number of these firms were happy to deal with the smugglers, simply shipping drugs under deliberately misleading labels. 23 For instance, German firms shipped heroin, the latest derivative of opium, as aspirin. Turkey was the one nation that resisted the demands of the League of Nations and profited from its own production of opium. Turkey h eld out until 1931, when it officially closed its factories. Bulgaria t ook up the slack. The drug trade, of course, never stopped. More and more customers bought the products, and as regulation grew, so did the profits from the trade. The only part that has changed is the level of violence. When cor- porations controlled the industry, they had no need to compete differ- ently from how they had in selling other products. When the corporations were replaced by criminals, those who felt the need to get rid of the competition often killed it. In 1840 New Englanders imported twenty-four thousan d pounds of opium into the United States. This garnered much attention, but the U.S. reaction was to slap a duty on the product. Dr ug importers, once dependent on a small group of addicts in their home land, soon had thousands as the Civil War saw an increase in presc ribed opium and opium abuse.

Some of the e arly families were wealthy or at least titled in England, while o thers were prominent in their respective churches. For nearly four hundred years status was accorded by just how far back the family name could be traced. There were two classes of people who came t o early Massachusetts: the original blue bloods, the religi ous dissenters from the East Anglia district north of London, and a more ge ographically varied group of \"others.\" The blue bloods became Massachusetts's first and or iginal upper class. They were Puritans led by John Winthrop of t he East Anglia town of Groton. Winthrop was likened to the biblical Neh emiah, who led his people out of Babylonian captivity.

This p rompted many fam- ilies, including the Faneuils, Bowdoins, Reveres, a nd Olivers, to relocate to New England. It brought the Jays and Bayards to New York. 1 The Huguenots were merchants first, and because of the precarious nature of their existence and survival in Europe, they wer e possibly a much more adaptable people. Prestige was brought from Europe, achieved with the money accu- mulated in the New World, or acquired by marriage. By the late seven- teenth century distinctions among European brands o f Protestantism were blurred and the struggles pitted the English P rotestants against the Scottish and Irish Catholics. The English favored P arliamentary rule while the Catholic Irish and Scots often favored th e king, especially if it was a Stuart king. Boston was a microcosm of this old society, where t he top tier of a class system was built on status in Europe and in t he church and was later joined by those who made their fortunes in th e New World. Members of this class were bent on self-preservatio n and accomplished this in many ways: intermarriage, dominance in busi ness and politics, and endowment of public institutions. Cabots marrie d Lowells, Roosevelts married Astors, and Paines married Whitn eys. Such names were like tribal tattoos; they indicated royal line age and thus prestige. Names also served to exclude certain groups, and pr essure was put on individual family members to marry within their sta tion.

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was lucky enough to be b orn into one of New Hampshire's first families, the Wadswort hs, which afforded him the ability to travel throughout Europe and wri te poetry. He mar- ried Frances Appleton, the daughter of Nathan Apple ton, which sub- stantially increased Longfellow's wealth. The Longf ellow House in Cambridge was a gift from his father-in-law. Longfe llow owned shares in at least five textile companies that his father- in-law invested in, and when his friend and contemporary Charles Dickens vi sited the mills of Lowell, it is no small wonder he compared them favo rably to England's. Jesse Appleton was a man of principle. He served as the president of Bowdoin College, where Longfellow had been a stu dent and a pro- fessor. Jesse's daughters benefited from both his s tation and his lessons and developed a knack for marrying well. Daughter F rances married a Bowdoin professor. Daughter Mary married John Aiken , a prominent attorney and significant investor in the textile in dustry. Despite the family's involvement in the China trade , Jane Appleton had a sense of morality that seems at odds with her fortune. When she met Franklin Pierce, who attended Bowdoin, he was s tudying to become an attorney. The Appleton family discouraged the match, as Pierce was not as prominent as the Appletons, despi te the fact that his father was the governor of New Hampshire."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"280 From the Sacred to the Profane Pierce entered politics early, a career that went h and in hand with being an attorney. He was a Jacksonian, which pitte d him against the Whig class of Massachusetts's monied elite, but at the same time he was pro-slavery. Pierce soon retired from politics to e nlist as a private in the war against Mexico. He emerged a general and a war hero. When his war hero status raised his value as a candidate, Pi erce was swept into national politics by the same faction that had remo ved Taylor. Jane Appleton Pierce did all she could to keep her husba nd from becoming a presidential candidate. His getting the party nom ination caused her to faint, and for a while she fought his going to Wash ington, as it had a reputation for hard drinking that to her was immora l. Incredible tragedy struck Jane and Franklin Pierce, as their third and only surviving son was killed on the way to the ina uguration in Washington. Jane avoided public life, and a childho od friend took her place at White House functions. Pierce was a one-term president who had a flair for creating divi- siveness. He was the first president to appoint a n on-Protestant cabinet member. The postmaster general was James Campbell, a Pennsylvania Catholic whose appointment and reception of a papal delegate helped create the backlash that would become the Know-Noth ing (American nativist) party. Pierce endorsed the Kansas-Nebrask a Bill, which was the eye of the slavery hurricane and led to the splitti ng of the Democratic party and the ending of the Whig party—and the crea tion of the Republican party. He brought England and America to the verge of war for a third time over policy and further strained r elations with Europe when plans to annex Cuba were leaked to the Europea n press. Pierce's attorney general, Caleb Cushing, was the r eal power behind the \"throne.\" The thirty-third-degree Mason and opi um trader was the grand master to the divisive politics that threaten ed the nation. Pierce's secretary of war, Jefferson Davis, completed the co nspiracy, leading the Southern states into war against the Union.

Coolidge money too had been increa sed in the China trade, and Thomas Coolidge had no qualms abou t admitting his devotion to the acquisition of wealth, as \"money wa s becoming the only real avenue to power and success both socially and in the regard of your fellow-men.\" 3 Coolidge money was spread at Harvard and at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, among other inst itutions. Coolidge money would also start the United Fruit Company, wh ich linked other prominent New England families for a hundred years. THE CABOTS Samuel Eliot Morison, one of America's highest auth orities on the his- tory of the sea trade, writes, \"Seaboard Massachuse tts has never known such a thing as social democracy. . . . Inequalitie s of wealth have made political democracy a sham.\" 4 Writing on the mansions of pre- Revolutionary New England, which include George Cab ot's at Beverly, Jonathan Jackson's at Newburyport, and Joh n Heard's at Ipswich, Morison points to the sea as the source of wealth. Bluntly referring to the Revolution as an effect of George Ill's harsh maritime policy, Morison calls Boston the headquarters of th e Revolution. What England called smuggling, he emphasizes, Americans called free trade. 5 The Cabot family began the family fortune upon arri val in America, when John Cabot emigrated from the Channel Islands to Salem in 1700. His son Joseph became a successful merchant and mar ried into the Higginson family, one of the most prominent in the colony. George Cabot was the seventh of Joseph's eleven chi ldren, and despite his Harvard education he was shipped off as a cabin boy under the command of two older brothers. Their father's s hips were active with the Spanish colonies in the trade of rum and f ish, two staples of the slave plantations. At age eighteen George was m ade captain. After four years at sea, George married and took over a s hare in the distillery business from his wife's side of the family, as wel l as control of his broth- ers' shipping interests. George made his last voyag e at age twenty-seven, at which time he was already a captain of industry."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"282 From the Sacred to the Profane The Revolutionary War was great business for George as he fitted out forty ships as privateers and shared richly in many prizes. What Cabot and his fellow merchants had fought for, in a ddition to prizes, was to make a union of the colonies in the belief t hat it would expand their mercantile business. And for a while it did. In 1784 George Cabot was already trading through the Baltic Sea, pioneer ing the Russian trade with his ships Bucanier and Commerce. 6 In 1787, with the war at an end, the Cabot family established the Beverly Cotto n Manufactory. Cabots also owned fishing fleets in Beverly, which led Senator George Cabot to draft and push through an act giving fishe rmen a bounty to expand the codfishing business. From 1789 to 1799 Alexander Hamilton had dictated t he financial and foreign policy for the nation's first two admin istrations. His privy council was called the Essex Junto. 7 Made up of George Cabot, Stephen Higginson, Jonathan Jackson, John Lowell, and Thoma s Pickering, the Junto almost created a second revolution when the p olicies of Jefferson were not in accord with the council's own financial interests. The fortunes of the Essex Junto were made mostly fr om the sea and from unrestricted trade. Its credit needs were met not by the infant gov- ernment in Washington but by the same facilities me mbers had relied on before the Revolution: the London banking houses . The Essex Junto was actually a traitorous conspiracy, as it broke a way from the United States because of Jefferson's embargo. When home am ong his fellow aristocrats, George Cabot was a pillar of the compa ct society; outside New England he was an anarchist, a charge he had ma de against Jefferson. The conspiracy blew over as the embargo was lifted. Senator George Cabot, whose mother was Elizabeth Hi gginson, married his first cousin, also named Elizabeth Higg inson. The union was one of many dynastic marriages among the opium families who became the Brahmin class of Boston. George further cemented his role in the establishment by serving as president of the Boston branch of the United States Bank, as director of Suffolk Insuranc e, and as president of Boston Marine Insurance. The next famous Cabot was Edward (1818-1901), the t hird of"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Wealth: The Legacy of the Opium Trade 283 eleven children of Samuel Cabot and Eliza Perkins ( daughter of Thomas Handasyd Perkins). The offspring of two of t he most powerful China trading families, Edward Cabot decided to be a sheep farmer. After losing a fortune in that business in Illinois , he returned home and became an architect. Edward would get commissions t o design Johns Hopkins University and the Boston Athenaeum, both o f which were financed by family. The best-known Cabot might be Henry Cabot Lodge, a Harvard Ph.D. historian-turned-politician. A true elitist, he fought against women's suffrage and even against the direct electi on of U.S. senators. To foster these elitist politics the Cabot family e ndowed organizations such as the Brookings Institute, where world leader s like James Wolfensohn of the World Bank; Henry Schacht of Warb urg, Pincus; David Rockefeller; and Barton Biggs of Morgan Stanl ey bridge the corporate-political divide and influence government policy. THE LOWELLS A Boston elitist saying holds that the Lowells spea k only to the Cabots, and the Cabots speak only to God. The Lowell family achieved its status in Brahmin so ciety by its early arrival in the colonies and its development of Newb uryport as an early center of shipbuilding and a merchant community. Th e early families did everything they could to preserve their status and wealth, including marrying into other wealthy and prestigious familie s. John Lowell was part of the class of 1721 at Harvar d and shared classrooms with Hancocks, Winslows, Hutchinsons, an d Woolcotts. A great example of what the dynastic marriage can pro duce is the rela- tionship of John Lowell and Jonathan Jackson. John \"Old Judge\" Lowell, a Harvard graduate in 1761, married the dau ghter of Stephen Higginson, a leading merchant, and Elizabeth Cabot Higginson. As Lowell was a lawyer, this connection maintained his status in the mer- chant community, which had already been established by his family. John's close friend Jonathan Jackson had inherited twenty thousand"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"284 From the Sacred to the Profane pounds and married the daughter of Patrick Tracy, o ne of Bostons rich- est merchants. The marriage increased Jackson's wea lth and his status as a merchant, and extended his connections into England —a necessary con- nection for financing. For Jackson, John Lowell rep resented connections; for John Lowell, Jackson meant more clients. Their partnership was cemented by marriage between the families. John Low ell's son, Francis Cabot Lowell, was born to his second wife, Susan Ca bot. Francis Cabot Lowell married Hannah, the daughter of Jackson and his first wife. John and Elizabeth Lowell were New England's finest couple, and their Boston home on High Street was next door to t hat of their best friends, the Jacksons. From this power base the two men were able to increase their fortunes, thanks to the Revolution. John represented the business affairs of British families, handled the w ills of leading patricians in Boston, collected seven hundred separate fees re lated to privateer actions, and was in charge of liquidating many Tory -owned properties after the war. His legal machine benefited from his action in the early politics of the new country. John Lowell served as a member of the State Constit utional Convention, which advocated that \"all men are born free and equal,\" but it is doubtful that he personally advocated suc h sentiments. Both Lowell and best friend, Jackson, were slave owners. John Lowell has the distinction of being the last man in Boston to own a black slave. After the war the classes were further divided in A merica as eco- nomic depression and higher taxation struck home. A huge chasm existed between the haves and the have-nots, and th e Lowells were among those who had it all. In order to have a plac e to keep it all, Lowell, along with members of the Russell and Higgi nson families, started the Massachusetts Bank, which became the Fi rst National Bank of Boston. While the Lowell family wealth was already one of t he greatest and they were one of the most powerful clans in the new country, Francis Cabot Lowell further increased the family wealth an d made an imprint on the American textile industry In England, Richard Arkwright launched the industri al revolution"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Wealth: The Legacy of the Opium Trade 285 by bringing machinery to the textile industry, whic h was formerly dependent on people in their homes. Spinning, cardi ng, and weaving yarn on hand looms was the original cottage industr y. A woman often went to a storekeeper, bought the yarn on consignme nt, and returned woven cloth to earn a profit. Women could weave at home while earn- ing a wage at the same time. The industrial revolut ion would change the home-based industry to a factory-based one, sta rting with the spin- ning frame, the first fully powered machine for spi nning yarn. An assistant to Richard Arkwright, Samuel Slater, m emorized the design of the spinning frame and brought it to Amer ica, where slave trader Moses Brown financed the first cotton-spinni ng wheel in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. For Brown it was a natural progression from one type of cruel labor to another; instead of expl oiting captive labor, there was an entire new class of labor ready to be used—children. The company Brown built was named in honor of the machi ne's inventor, Arkwright. Francis Cabot Lowell followed Brown's example and w ent to England in 1810 to get plans for his own factory. H is first factory would be a partnership with brother-in-law Tracy Jackson, as well as with Paul Moody and Nathan Appleton. Lowell's mill combined a ll the operations of making raw cotton into finished clothes. As soon as he realized it could be done, he used his political influence to p ush for high duties on imported cloth, in order to lessen his competiti on. Lowell's inner circle of Boston Associates then sco uted for a loca- tion to build even larger mills. They found that th e confluence of the Concord and Merrimack Rivers was perfect for provid ing the water- power needed to power their looms. Thus the sleepy farming village of East Chelmsford was turned into a factory village c alled Lowell. Lowell was much more than a single factory; it was the first corpo- rate town. Several corporations were formed and sco uts were sent throughout the state to find the necessary machine operators. Children were the best source of labor. Times were tough and children as young as ten were in great supply. The youngest of the fa ctory girls were \"dof- fers,\" doffing, or taking off, the full bobbins fro m the spinning frames"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"286 From the Sacred to the Profane and replacing them. These girls worked fourteen-hou r days, starting at five in the morning, for the munificent sum of two dollars a week. 8 As in mining towns, unscrupulous textile operators would often allow workers to run up charges at factory stores. The combination of inflated prices and accumulated debt ensured that w orkers would stay. The women and children brought to the factory town often could not afford to leave, their condition reduced to somethi ng not much differ- ent from slavery. The elite factory owners were able to color things differently. John Greenleaf Whittier, poet and newspaper editor, live d near Lowell and wrote of the mill town, describing it as a \"city sp ringing up like the enchanted palaces of Arabian Tales.\" These brick \"p alaces\" ran six days a week, fourteen hours a day, and when it was dark wh ale-oil lamps extended the day. The living conditions were worse. Accommodations were in blocks of sixteen \"houses,\" with five hundr ed people forced to use one privy. In another tenement in Lowell the te nants had to carry their waste, human and otherwise, to Austin Avenue. In another Lowell block the commissioners counted 396 people living i n conditions Whittier described as filthy, unsanitary, foul, and wretched. But the women had to live there as a condition of their emp loyment. What Mr. Whittier and other writers who were tainted by thos e who paid their salaries seemed to miss, a Massachusetts labor comm issioner pointed out: The state's laws protected horses better than people. 9 Despite the conditions, the wage was higher than a teenage girl could make outside the factory system, and children could send home money to their families. Despite the abuses, the mi llworkers did not fight for raises. Eventually they were forced to fi ght to keep the same wage, as factory owners started cutting wages after competition from other mills grew. The plight of the mill women achi eved national atten- tion many decades later when seventy-three-year-old Mary Jones marched with several hundred textile workers, half of them under the age of sixteen, from Philadelphia to New York to vi sit President Teddy Roosevelt. By this time American mills and mines em ployed two mil- lion children.

Both men avoided the demonstration, but the public outcry cr eated by the march finally led to child protection laws. Although many of New England's elite kept their fam ily money and power intact, it was the Cabot name that remain ed a political force. Henry Cabot Lodge served in Congress and the Senate from 1893 to 1924 and was even nominated for president by Teddy Roosevelt at the 1916 Republican Convention. Lodge's grandson Henry Cabot Lodge was John F. Kennedy's ambassador to South Vietnam, and was involved heavily in the secret negotiations that led to the assassination of South Vietnam's president, Ngo Dinh Diem. CHASING THE DRAGON After the first Opium War, the California gold rush diverted attention from the opium trade in China. The great rush to re ach the West meant there was more money to be made shipping goods to C alifornia than to China. The eastern magnates, made wealthy by the opium trade, were the driving force behind the rush to build a transc ontinental railroad. With slavery banned, the next best labor was import ed and cheap. The railroad owners turned to China, where coolies, or unskilled laborers, could be carried over on ships along with opium. Many Chinese desired to leave their country as fami ne and taxes hurt farming. Many of the immigrants came from the same coastal provinces where the opium business had thrived. The means of getting out of China was as harsh as the immigration on the death ships from Ireland—sometimes worse. Dubbed the pig trade, the immigrants were treated like slaves as they got on the transport sh ips, which were often managed by Americans. The Chinese were marked with the letter C for their destination, California. They commited themse lves to an inden- ture period that many did not understand. Thousands would be \"relieved\" of their obligation, as the death rate w as a startling 40 per- cent, higher than that of the African slave trade."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"288 From the Sacred to the Profane Most of the immigrants whose passage was paid—at th e price of indenture—were men who were destined to work on the railroads. To service the men, Chinese overseers bring them drugs and occasionally prostitutes. Many of the women brought to serve as prostitutes were sold by their families or kidnapped; some were as y oung as eight years old. 10 Emigration from China spread the use of opium to Au stralia and Peru, two other common destinations, as well as to California. In America the nation was discovering the negatives of drug addiction, but there was no public outcry until opium became assoc iated with the immigrants. While in the grips of a new hysteria against immigr ation and the poor, the attitudes of Americans changed. One could buy heroin in the Sears catalog or at the grocery store and cannabis at the drugstore, but now the American government and the Hearst media so ught to con- vince Americans that such evils were being foisted upon the country by foreigners. The Chinese brought the opium, the Mexi cans brought the marijuana, and the blacks brought the cocaine. The head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, Harry J. Anslinger, and the He arst newspapers spoke out against anything that was associated with people of these her- itages, including their music. Even the labor union s, threatened by the large numbers of hardworking Asians, called the Chi nese drug smug- glers. 11 The editorial opinion of the Hearst organization mi rrored the posi- tion of the Ku Klux Klan in seeking 100 percent \"Am ericanism.\" Thomas Edison's first films were on the Chinese and their alleged pro- clivity for opium. Americans soon got the message. It was one thing when old women drifted off to sleep after sniffing an opium pipe; it was another when strangers were using the drug. At the turn of the century, Roosevelt relied on the word to sup- press Asian opium. Although it was ironic that the nineteenth-century Roosevelts and Delanos had built a family fortune o n addicting Chinese to opium, the tide had turned. America was smoking more opium each year than the six largest nations of Eur ope put together."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Wealth: The Legacy of the Opium Trade 289 The man who might be dubbed America's first drug cz ar, Hamilton Wright, claimed that the Chinese brought the proble m to American shores and that opium's use had grown beyond the Ch inese workers. He pointed out that five hundred thousand pounds of opium were used each year, and less than 10 percent was for legitim ate medicinal pur- poses. Wright placed the blame on \"ignorant physici ans\" and \"law-defying retail druggists,\" and called on the country to est ablish laws that would curb opium use. But cocaine was also becoming popul ar, and Wright claimed, \"It is current knowledge . . . where large numbers of Negroes congregate, cocaine is peddled pretty openly.\" 12 The result of the racist hysteria was the Harrison Act, which started the ban on drugs such as heroin. The ban had two im mediate results: It drove the price of heroin up 1,500 percent 13 and it induced the use of the syringe to help addicts get more bang for their bucks. Another long- term effect was violence. As it was no longer a dru g that was used pri- marily by middle-aged women, opium and heroin found the young and the poor to be receptive and repetitive clients. Th e illegal trade was the source of wealth for those who braved the risks. A new generation of smugglers became America's legacy.

If a Bonesman is in a room and the subject of the organization comes up, he not only will not reply but also he will leave the room. The oath s taken among the bones and skulls of celebrity skeletons have never been broken. Nor has the power. In recent years Ron Rosenbaum and Antony Sutton, au thors of America's Secret Establishment, have shed light on the secret organization. The Skull and Bones is the beneficiary of a trust s et up by the Russell and Company heirs. How much money from the vast Chi na trading fortune went into the Russell Trust Association is unknown, but each tapped member starts with fifteen thousand dollars and countless valu- able connections. Old-money names include Adams, Bu ndy, Cheney, Lord, Stimson, and Wadsworth. New-money names inclu de Harriman, Rockefeller, Payne, and Bush. 6 Averill Harriman, of the Wall Street firm Brown Brothers Harriman, is another member and the patron of the Bush fortune. And Brown Brothers Harriman is the re pository of the Skull and Bones's funds. From this remarkable base of power the heirs to the Russell Trust maintain control as the inner circle of power. The outer circle, which consists of organizations that exist in at least se mi-daylight, include the Trilateral Commission, the Brookings Institute, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Round Tables of Commerce in nume rous cities.

Using high-tech ni ght-vision video equipment, the organization—whose members gave birt h to the OSS and the CIA, filled numerous secretary of state pos ts, and served as national security advisers—were spied on themselves . While the vulgar scene need not be retold in these pages, it would h ave been a much greater embarrassment if other media had carried th e story further. Is there a Skull and Bones agenda? Bonesmen \"believ e in the notion of 'constructive chaos,' which justifies cov ert action,\" writes Joel Bainerman in Inside the Covert Operations of the CI A and Israel's Mossad. The foreign policy of the Bonesmen is almost always carried out through a secret agenda. 7 Alphonso Taft was secretary of war when he pressured McKinley to declare war on Spain. After M cKinley was assas- sinated, Teddy Roosevelt took over and brought in B onesman William Howard Taft. Others of the order who have held warr ior posts include Henry Stimson, secretary of state under Hoover; Rob ert Lovett, secre- tary of defense at the height of the Cold War; Gene ral George Marshall, who became Truman's secretary of state; McGeorge Bu ndy, Kennedy's national security adviser; and Averell Harriman, am bassador-at-large for southeast Asia during Vietnam. Following the Stimso n doctrine that there should be regular periodic wars to divert dis content and rally the nation to a single purpose, Bonesmen George Bush an d George W. Bush would uphold the tradition with brief military excursions in Asia and Latin America. Just how much clout has the order of the Skull and Bones exerted on twentieth-century history?

After rea ping their fortunes in Asia, the families turned their attention homewa rd to railroads, mills, and mines. An American presence remained in China a s missionaries then tried to \"reform\" the Chinese to further accep t Western ways. Henry Luce was the son of a missionary to China. He was sent to Yale for an education and was tapped for the Skull and B ones.

Luce married Clare Boothe Brokaw, who took as much of an inter- est in China as he did. Together they acted on beha lf of the China Institute of America to bring Chinese students to t he United States. Luce and his wife were very close to the ruling Chi nese Soong family, whose corrupt activities helped the rise of Communi sm. When Chiang Kai-shek's army was defeated, Luce's China Lobby un ited John Foster and Allen Dulles, the Rockefeller family, Thomas La mont, and Cardinal Spellman to push for American assistance. Chiang lo st credibility as his army was defeated in one battle after another and h e and his family looted three hundred million dollars of American fu nds. But Chiang would not lose the support of Luce, who was still r abid that Mao Tse- tung had beaten Chiang. Time magazine would constan tly play up the Nationalist cause. Mao Tse-tung was a Yale student, perhaps as a resul t of Luce's China efforts. The Yale Divinity School had established a number of \"branch\" schools in China, and Mao was their most famous stu dent. Although he was not tapped for the Skull and Bones, just about every recent ambas- sador to China was a Bonesman: George Bush, Winston Lord, and James Lilley, all alumni of the Skull and Bones, all serv ed as ambassador to China. With the outspoken Luce leading the way, America wa s rallied to take up the French battle in Vietnam as a means of curtailing further Communist expansion. The result was a long, drawn-o ut, and expensive war that took tens of thousands of lives and wreake d havoc on America by bringing heroin addiction to eighty thousand ret urning war veterans. 9 The China Lobby and the Skull and Bones were firmly behind the Vietnam War, and they were unfortunately in positio n to ensure that the war continued.

The issue, ho wever, was greater than the war itself. The Yale-driven CIA had never stopped fighting and then supporting the KMT army of Chiang Kai-shek, an d soon the war became a turf battle for blue-chip corporations and drug traffickers alike. 10 The conflict in Vietnam was a source of profits fo r the corpora- tions that received the greatest amount of business from the war: Textron's Bell Helicopter Company, chemical firms i ncluding Dow Chemical and Monsanto, which produced Agent Orange and other defoliants, and construction company Brown and Root , a key backer of President Johnson.

The company started as a banana importer but soon becam e master of the so-called banana republics it controlled, owning th eir railroads and communications systems. The Yale blue bloods and their CIA were firmly in c ontrol of the company, which was also doing business with New Orl eans mobsters. Joe Macheca, the reputed boss of organized crime in New Orleans, merged his shipping line into United Fruit in 1900. His underworld successor, Charles Matranga, stayed close to United Fruit throughout his life, and at his funeral United Fruit executive s paid their respects. 11 The New Orleans mob was then controlled by Carlos M arcello, during which time it imported morphine and cocaine from Ho nduras. In the same year that Marcello took control, the board of directors bought out its greatest rival, Samuel Zemurray, with stock in its company. A few years later, when Zemurray became a nuisance as a b oard of directors member, Thomas Cabot sacked him. Later a new challenge emerged.

The United Fruit story was fed to the media and tru mped in Congress, and finally a top executive made the case to the Council on Foreign Relations. The council hired a lobbyist, Th omas Corcoran, to act as liaison to the CIA. Tommy the Cork, as he wa s called, was friends with Walter Bedell \"Beetle\" Smith, the CIA director . Corcoran had served as the legal representative to the CIA's \"ai rline\" in Laos and Vietnam. 16 The American intelligence agency actually had a pr oprietary airline first called CAT, Civil Air Transport and l ater dubbed Air America, that would be the subject of a 1990 movie by the same title. In 1954 the CIA used Honduras to topple the governm ent of Guatemala. A series of graft and drug scandals in H onduras brought down the leadership in the 1970s, but the CIA ensur ed that Honduras would be a main staging point for actions in nearby Guatemala and Nicaragua. When the showdown came with the DEA, whi ch was mak- ing the CIA uncomfortable, it was the DEA office th at closed. 17 Despite the so-called War on Drugs, the drug-free plan was much less impor- tant than the agenda of United Fruit, its sharehold ers, and the CIA.

GEORGE BUSH, GEORGE W. BUSH, AND DICK CHENEY The Bush tradition in the Skull and Bones began wit h George's father, Prescott, who was a Bonesman and served in Army int elligence. At the wedding of Prescott Bush and Dorothy Walker, five B onesmen served as ushers. Bush family members were close to the Ro ckefellers and Harrimans and served on numerous corporation boards . George Herbert Walker Bush was born and raised in Greenwic h, Connecticut, and schooled at Andover and Yale. With money from t he owner of the Washington Post and connections from family and his Bones cabal, George headed to Texas to make his fortune. Bonesman Henry Neil Mallon, one of four Mallons in the group, gave George the chance to learn the oil business th rough his company, Dresser Industries, which had been bought from its founding family by Mallon with Harriman money. After George's apprenti ceship at Dresser he started his own company, Zapata Oil, with two pa rtners. Zapata Oil drilled in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The company' s island base in the Cay Sal Bank would be used for CIA operations again st Castro. The Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 was actually known as Oper ation Zapata.

He later became director of the CIA. George W. Bush's career went according to the same game plan as his father's with the exception of CIA involvement. George W. went to Yale, was a member of the Skull and Bones, worked i n the oil business, and then moved into politics. In the 2000 president ial race he picked Richard Bruce Cheney as his running mate. Although the soon-to-be vice president was not a Bonesman, there are nine C heneys in the membership list of the Skull and Bones. The Cheney ancestor who came to America in 1667 landed in Massachusetts, en titling the family to be counted among the blue bloods. Like George H. W. Bush, Cheney was connected to military intelligence, and he was a strong supporter of Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North. Cheney was even Ge orge's secretary of defense during Operation Desert Storm. Cheney to o went to Texas, where he became the head of Halliburton, an oil-dri lling company that bought Dresser Industries in 1998 under his tenure as boss.

THE BONES AND THE OCTOBER SURPRISE In November 1980 President Jimmy Carter, who had so far survived two assassination attempts and the intrigues of a p owerful machine he could not fully comprehend, lost the presidential e lection. The powers that were had thrown their weight behind the charis matic Ronald Reagan and Bonesman George Bush. But what the Repub licans feared the most was that the hostage situation in Iran wou ld end just before the election. Despite the constant mismanagement by the Carter White House, a last-minute release of the American hostag es, the \"October Surprise,\" could spike Carter's popularity enough t o carry the election.

The deal was that Iran would hol d the hostages until after the election in exchange for arms. This deal would also start the strange Oliver North-Iran-Contra Affair that was un earthed years later. After the election, a series of murders and strange deaths began that included Reagan's campaign manager and spymaster Wi lliam Casey; Amaram Nir, an Israeli officer; arms dealer Cyrus H ashemi 20 ; and broadcast journalist Jessica Savitch. In a remarkab le coincidence, Senators John Heinz and John Tower were killed in s eparate plane crashes within hours of each other, in April 1991. Both were allegedly connected to the October Surprise. And both were po werful men in the Senate. The father of Senator Heinz was John Heinz II, who was a Skull and Bones member in 1931. John I I I , prince of the H einz ketchup company fortune, married Teresa Simoes Ferreira, wh o was born of a Portuguese family in Mozambique, which at the time was still a colony. Ferreira, a board member of the Carnegie Institute, a member of the Brookings Institute, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, suddenly inherited a fortune worth $860 million. She then would marry another senator, Bonesman John Forbes K erry. John Kerry, whose ancestors were among the opium pioneer s in China, investigated the Iran-Contra Affair, unearthed Oliv er North's private aid network to the Contras, and exposed the Bank of Commerce and Credit International (BCCI).

COINCIDENCE AND THE JFK ASSASSINATION The murder of President John Kennedy is a half cent ury old, but many believe it will never be solved.

Luce had said an anti-Castro a gent had called her"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"300 From the Sacred to the Profane the day JFK was killed and said Oswald was a Commun ist. 21 The next victim of suspicion was the American right wing, as allegedly someone named George Bush tipped off the authorities of the assassination plot. The next suspects were organized criminals, such as the Mafia, and even Texas oil producers. Finally, the American CIA took over as the most likely culprit. Surveys of skeptics of the Warren C ommission Report, which Allen Dulles predicted no one would ever read , indicate that the CIA was the power behind the conspiracy. One skepti c was Robert Kennedy, who asked CIA Director John McCone point-b lank, \"Did the CIA kill my brother?\" 22 McCone said no. A motive for the murder of President Kennedy could be that he had failed to take back Cuba, and this threatened o ther Caribbean islands where United Fruit and a handful of sugar c ompanies reaped the rewards of exploitative capitalism. Another motive might be that Kennedy had threatened to end the Vietnam profit ce nter, which brought fortunes to the numerous blue-blood investm ents in aviation, particularly Textron, which owned Bell Helicopter, and the Brown and Root construction company, which had provided Lyndo n B. Johnson with his campaign war chest. This chapter will not attempt to solve the mystery of the Kennedy assassination, but it will t ry to shed light on some of the awkward coincidences that authors of th e Warren Commission Report, such as Kennedy haters Earl Warr en and Allen Dulles, believed no one would ever read. The conspiracy as traced by the Warren Commission m ay have started when a young marine named Lee Harvey Oswald , who had contact with the Office of Naval Intelligence, star ted studying Russian while stationed in a high-security base in Japan, a nd then left the marines and defected to Russia. 23 In Russia the soldier was treated well, was given an apartment and a job, and was able to g et married. He also had his picture taken with an American \"tourist,\" M arie Hyde, who said she became lost while on her tour, a near impossibi lity in the 1960s Cold War Russia. The defector, who had been suspected of passing inf ormation on the U-2 flights to his Russian hosts, returned home without even a slap"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"The Power of the New Skull and Bones 301 on the wrist from his government. Instead he was gi ven a loan by the government to buy a home with his Russian bride. He then got a series of jobs, with at least one requiring a security cle arance. He also met George DeMohrenschildt, who was connected in the oi l business and knew both George Bush and Jacqueline Bouvier Kenned y. DeMohrenschildt introduced Oswald to Michael Ralph Paine and Ruth Hyde Paine, both of whom belonged to the Unite d World Federalists, which was started by Cord Meyer of the CIA. Another member of Meyer's United World Federalists was Priscilla Johnson. Supposedly turned down for a CIA job becau se of her mem- bership in United World Federalists, Johnson nevert heless turned up in Russia and met Oswald. 24 Michael Paine's mother was Ruth Forbes Paine, of the same family whose ships carried opium to China in the nineteenth century. Ruth Paine's brother, William F orbes, was on the board of United Fruit. On his father's side, Michae l's ancestors include Cabots, one of whom is a cousin who sat on the boar d of directors of United Fruit. Michael's wife, also named Ruth, was the daughter of William Avery Hyde. She was close to her husband's family, and in July 1963 went to Naushon Island, the Forbes kingdom off Woods Hole, to visit her mother-in-law, Ruth. Mother Ruth's best friend, Mary Bancroft, was not o nly in the CIA but was also involved in a long-term relationship w ith Allen Dulles. Bancroft wrote all about her twenty-year affair in her autobiography, My Life as a Spy. Bancroft's father was elected may or of Cambridge four times and was president of the Boston Elevated Rail way. Her step- mother's stepfather was Clarence Walker Barron, who published Barron's and the Wall Street Journal. Bancroft's first husba nd worked as chief of United Fruit in Cuba, and her daughter married the son of Bonesman and Senator Robert Taft. 25 When Ruth Paine, wife of Michael, returned from Nau shon, the Paines took in young Lee Harvey Oswald and his Russ ian wife, Marina. Ruth found her adopted defector a job in the Texas School Book Depository. Ruth and Michael also provided a key pi ece of evidence that would help convict their new friend, should th e police department"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"302 From the Sacred to the Profane protect Oswald long enough to get him to trial. In a declassified docu- ment, an informant describes a phone call Michael m ade to Ruth right after the shooting, with Michael saying he didn't b elieve Oswald was involved and that \"we both know who is responsible. \" 26 Why would Robert Kennedy ask if the CIA killed his brother? The CIA had caused the biggest blunder of John Kennedy' s short presi- dency, the Bay of Pigs invasion. It caused Kennedy to dump Allen Dulles, who advised for the operation, and threaten to smash the CIA into a million pieces. And it was also surprising w hen the committee set up to investigate the murder of the president was m ade up of Earl Warren, who was beholden to the Teamsters, whom Rob ert Kennedy had investigated; Gerald Ford, who was also beholde n to the Teamsters; and Allen Dulles. The CIA was a natural suspect in the assassination. The greatest piece of evidence in the Warren Commis sion investi- gation was what became known as the Zapruder film, which was quickly bought by Luce's Time/Life Corporation. The film showed President Kennedy's head snap in a way that could b e caused only by a bullet from the right front. It was made to appear that the President's head was falling forward indicating a shot from the rear, which meant that the frames in the film were reversed. 27 Later this reversal of frames was said to be an accident. After the Warren Commission fell out of favor with the thinking public, other commissions were set up to investigat e the CIA and the growing amount of political assassinations in Ameri ca. The newer evi- dence pointed to the involvement of intelligence in the Kennedy assas- sination, and forensic evidence showed the improbab ility of there being a single shooter. It is more likely that a two- or three-man hit team had been in place. Marita Lorenz testified that she was part of the operation and named two of the CIA operatives and a number of Cubans who were also involved. In her short and remarkable lif e, Lorenz had been a lover of Fidel Castro and then part of the CIA Oper ation 40 plot to kill him. At that time she was \"dating\" Venezuelan dicta tor Marcos Perez"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"The Power of the New Skull and Bones 303 Jimenez, whose government was so corrupt that even the Roman Catholic Church took issue with it. 28 How did Lorenz survive to tes- tify? Her mother was Alice June Lofland, a cousin o f Henry Cabot Lodge, 29 and she worked for the NSC. 30 Lorenz testified to the Select Committee on Assassinations about the Operation 40 plot against the president: \"From the time I rejoined Operation 40 . .. all I heard was 'We're going to get Kennedy.' \" 31 She said no one would murder her because of her mother's \"power in the National Secu rity Agency.\" 32 Among the series of strange deaths that took place shortly after JFK was murdered was that of Mary Pinchot Meyer, the ex -wife of Cord Meyer. Pinchot Meyer was murdered while walking alo ng the Chesapeake and Ohio towpath. Georgetown murders are rare, but this one included some very strange circumstances and wa s never solved. Cord Meyer was the Yale-educated CIA agent who was linked to Ruth and Michael Paine through the United World Fed eralists, which he had founded before Dulles brought him into the C IA. Pinchot Meyer had been having an affair with JFK. Meyer was one of the most influential people in the CIA. Just after Pinchot M eyer's death, the CIA counterintelligence chief James Jesus Angleton ente red her house \"with a key he kept to the place\" and took her diary. 33,34 Angleton was joined by Ben Bradlee of the Washington Post, who was Pinc hot Meyer's brother-in-law. Although a series of unlikely coincidences, no matt er how suspi- cious, cannot be conclusive evidence of a conspirac y, it does suggest something that exists far from the eyes of the publ ic. The coincidences point to an elite handful of interlocking relations hips that have a hold over national affairs—a grip that most citizens cou ld not imagine pos- sible. The coincidences further suggest that the me dia, in the hands of such an elite, may stop far short of serious invest igative reporting. That there is a conspiracy is not in doubt; there a re numerous conspir- acies. An elite class has always been in power and always will be. When the chauffeur of a Rockefeller pays more in taxes t han the man he"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"304 From the Sacred to the Profane drives, the will of the elite is in evidence. When the House Select Committee on Assassinations concludes that the assa ssinations of Kennedy and Martin Luther King were conspiracies bu t nothing fur- ther is done, this is more evidence. When officers of the DEA complain of being told to back off because they are causing a problem for the CIA, this gives evidence that a higher power that g oes unchecked is in control. The fact that a nation allows itself to be ruled by an elite class has become old news to those being ruled, and has becom e a given to those who do not need to aspire to power because it is al ready theirs. The story of the night that George W Bush was tappe d for entry in the Skull and Bones is told in Bill Minutaglio's Fi rst Son. George was not sure he wanted the rigor of meeting with fellow Bonesmen two nights a week. He was already born into wealth and, thanks to his father, into power. George told a fellow classmate that he would rather join \"Gin and Tonic.\" His father, probably anticipa ting his son's doubt, knocked on his door at 8 P.M. and told young George that it was time to do the right thing, to become a \"good man.\" Geor ge accepted. 35 "},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"NOTES Chapter 1 1.
