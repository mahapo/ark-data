Two major themes run through this book: that altered states of consciousness are the key to unlocking one's magical abilities; and that these abilities can be developed without any symbolic system except reality itself. The magical style of thinking is explored with chapters on alternative belief and the alphabet of desire. A natural inclination toward the darker side of magic is as good a point as any from which to begi n the ultimate quest, and half this book is devoted to the black arts. Independently of ancient dusty books and mystification the vital elements of many traditions conspire here to create a living art. The Illuminates of Thanateros are the magical heirs to the Zos Kia Cultus and the A .'. A .'. This book, written originally as a sourcebook for the IOT, is now being released for those who wish to work alone and for those seeking admission to the Order. Although the initiate is referred to as \"he\" throughout, the reader should understand that this is merely in keeping with the traditional style of magical texts of this type, and that this course of study by no means excludes women."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 Diagram 1. The survival of the magical tradition.

Those beings who realize and practice such secrets are said to have achieved mastership. Masters will, at various points in history, inspire adepts t o create magic, mystic, religious, or even secular orders to bring others to master ship. Such orders have at certain times openly called themselves the Illuminati; at other times secrecy has seemed more prudent. The mysteries can only be preserved by const ant revelation. In this, the IOT continues a tradition perhaps seven thousand years old, yet the Order in the outer has no history, although it is constituted as a satrap of the Illuminati. In the Order with no past there is nowhere to conceal the future f rom the present. It takes its name from the gods of sex, Eros, and death, Thanatos. Apart from being humanity's two greatest obsessions and motivating forces, sex and death represent the positive and negative methods of attaining magical conscious ness. Ill umination refers to the inspiration, enlightenment, and liberation resulting from success with these methods. The specific purpose for which the IOT is constituted is to help determining in what form the as yet embryonic fifth aeon will manifest. Its task, although historic, consists in disseminating magical knowledge to individuals. For at no time since the first aeon has humanity stood in such need of these abilities to see its way forward. There is no formal hierarchy in the IOT. There is a division of a ctivity depending on ability as it develops. Students strengthen their magical will against the strongest possible adversary — their own minds. They explore the possibil ities of changing themselves at will and explore their own occult abilities in dream an d magical activity. Initiates familiarize themselves with all forms of occult attainment and seek to perfect themselves in some particular form of magic. They should also find others capable of aspiring to the Order and offer them help.

Thi s is accomplished in a number of stages: absolute motionless ness of the body, regulation of the breathing, stopping of thoughts, concentration on sound, concentration on objects, and concentration on mental images. Motionlessness Arrange the body in any co mfortable position and try to remain in that position for as long as possible. Try not to blink or move the tongue or fingers or any part of the body at all. Do not let the mind run away on long trains of thought but rather observe oneself passively. What appeared to be a comfortable position may become agonizing with time, but persist! Set aside some time each day for this practice and take advantage of any opportunity of inactivity which may arise. Record the results in the magical diary. One should not b e satisfied with less than five minutes. When fifteen have been achieved, proceed to regulation of the breathing. Breathing Stay as motionless as possible and begin to deliberately make the breathing slower and deeper. The aim is to use the entire capacity of the lungs but without any undue muscular effort or strain. The lungs may be held empty or full between exhalation and inhala tion to lengthen the cycle. The important thing is that the mind should direct its complete attention to the breath cycle. When this can be done for thirty minutes, proceed to not - thinking. Not - Thinking The exercises of motionlessness and breathing may improve health, but they have no other intrinsic value aside from being a preparation for not - thinking, the beginnings of the magic al trance condition. While motionless and breathing"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 deeply, begin to withdraw the mind from any thoughts which arise. The attempt to do this inevitably reveals the mind to be a raging tempest of activity. Only the greatest determination can win even a few seconds of mental silence, but even this is quite a triumph. Aim for complete vigilance over the arising of thoughts and try to lengthen the periods of total quiescence. Like the physical motionlessness, this mental motionlessness should be practiced at se t times and also whenever a period of inactivity presents itself. The results should be recorded in your diary. The Magical Trances Magic is the science and art of causing change to occur in con formity with will. The will can only become magically effectiv e when the mind is focused and not interfering with the will. The mind must first discipline itself to focus its entire attention on some meaningless phenomenon. If an attempt is made to focus on some form of desire, the effect is short circuited by lust o f result. Egotistical identification, fear of failure, and the reciprocal desire not to achieve desire, arising from our dual nature, destroy the result. Therefore, when selecting topics for concentration, choose subjects of no spiritual, egotistical, inte llectual, emotional, or useful significance — meaningless things. Object Concentration The legend of the evil - eye derives from the ability of wizards and sorcerers to give a fixed dead stare. This ability can be practiced against any object — a mark on a w all, something in the distance, a star in the night sky — anything. To hold an object with an absolutely fixed, unwavering gaze for more than a few moments proves extraordinarily difficult, yet it must be persisted in for hours at a time. Every attempt by the eye to distort the object, every attempt by the mind to find something else to think of, must be resisted. Eventually it is possible to extract occult secrets from things by this technique, but the ability must be developed by working with meaningless objects.

Any simple sound of one or more syllables is selected, for example, Aum or Om, Abrahadabra, Yod He Vau He, Aum Mani Padme Hum, Zazas Zazas, Nasatanada Zazas. The chosen sound is repeated over and over in the mind to block all other thoughts. No matter how inappropriate the choice of sound may seem to have been, you must persist with it. Eventually t he sound may seem to repeat itself automatically and may even occur in sleep. These are encouraging signs. Sound concentration is the key to words of power and certain forms of spell casting. Image Concentration The part of the mind in which pictorial tho ughts arise is brought under magical control by image concentration. A simple shape, such as a triangle, circle, square, cross, or crescent, is chosen and held in the mind's eye, without distortion, for as long as possible. Only the most determined efforts are likely to make the imagined form persist for any time. At first the image should be sought with the eyes closed. With practice it can be projected onto any blank surface. This technique is the basis of casting sigils and creating independent thought f orms. The three methods of attaining magical trance will only yield results if pursued with the most fanatical and morbid determination. These abilities are highly abnormal and usually inaccessible to human consciousness, as they demand such inhuman concen tration, but the rewards are great. In the magical diary, record each day's formal work and whatever extra opportunities have been utilized. No page should be left blank. Metamorphosis The transmutation of the mind to magical consciousness has often been c alled the Great Work. It has a far - reaching purpose leading eventually to the discovery of the True Will. Even a slight ability to change oneself is more valuable than any"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 power over the external universe. Metamorphosis is an exercise in willed restructuri ng of the mind. All attempts to reorganize the mind involve a duality be tween conditions as they are and the preferred condition. Thus it is impossible to cultivate any virtue like spontaneity, joy, pious, pride, grace, or omnipotence without involving one self in more conventionality, sorrow, guilt, sin, and impotence in the process. Religions are founded on the fallacy that one can or ought to have one without the other. High magic recognizes the dualistic condi tion but does not care whether life is bitter sweet or sweet and sour; rather it seeks to achieve any arbitrary perceptual perspective at will. Any state of mind might arbitrarily be chosen as an objective for transmutation, but there is a specific virtue to the ones given. The first is an antidote to the imbalance and possible madness of the magical trance. The second is a specific against obsession with the magical practices in the third section. They are: 1) Laughter/Laughter 2) Non - attachment/Non - disinterest Attaining these states of mind is accomplished by a process of ongoing meditation. One tries to enter into the spirit of the condition whenever possible and to think about the desired result at other times. By this method, a strong new mental habit can be established. Consider laughter: it is the high est emotion, for it can con tain any of the others from ecstacy to grief. It has no opposite. Crying is merely an underdeveloped form of it which cleanses the eyes and summons assistance to infants. Laughter is the only tenable attitude in a universe which is a joke played upon itself. The trick is to see that joke played out even in the neutral and ghastly events which surround one. It is not for us to question the universe's apparent lack of taste. Seek the emotion of laughter at wnat delights and amuses, seek it in whatever is neutral or meaningless, seek it even in what is horrific and revolting. Though it may be forced at first, one can learn to smile inwardly at all things. A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 Non - attachment/Non - disinterest best describes the magical condition of acting wi thout lust of result. It is very difficult for humans to decide on something and then to do it purely for its own sake. Yet it is precisely this ability which is required to execute magical acts. Only single - pointed awareness will do. Attachment is to be u nderstood both in the positive and negative sense, for aversion is its other face. Attachment to any attribute of oneself, one's personality, one's ambitions, one's relationships or sensory experiences — or equally, aversion to any of these — will prove li miting. On the other hand, it is fatal to lose interest in these things for they are one's symbolic system or magical reality. Rather, one is attempting to touch the sensitive parts of one's reality more lightly in order to deny the spoiling hand of graspi ng desire and boredom. Thereby one may gain enough freedom to act magically. In addition to these two meditations there is a third, more active, form of metamorphosis, and this involves one's everyday habits. However innocuous they might seem, habits in th ought word, and deed are the anchor of the personality. The magician aims to pull up that anchor and cast himself free on the seas of chaos. To proceed, select any minor habit at random and delete it from your behavior: at the same adopt any new habit at r andom. The choices should not involve anything of spiritual, egocentric, or emotional significance, nor should you select anything with any possibility of failure. By persisting with such simple beginnings you become capable of virtually anything. All work s of metamorphosis should be committed to the magical diary."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 MAGIC Success in this part of the syllabus is dependent on some degree of mastery of the magical trances and metamorphosis. This magical instruction involves three techniques: ritual, sigils, an d dreaming. In addition, the magician should make himself familiar with at least one system of divination: cards, crystal gazing, runesticks, pendulum, or divining rod. The methods are endless. With all techniques, aim to silence the mind and let inspirati on provide some sort of answer. Whatever symbolic system or instruments are used, they act only to provide a receptacle or amplifier for inner abilities. No divinatory system should involve too much random ness. Astrology is not recommended. Ritual is a com bination of the use of talismanic weapons, gesture, visualized sigils, word spells, and magical trance. Before proceeding with sigils or dreaming, it is essential to develop an effective Banishing Ritual. A well - constructed banishing ritual has the followi ng effects. It prepares the magician more rapidly for magical concentration than any of the trance exercises alone. It enables the magician to resist obsession if problems are encoun tered with dream experiences or with sigils becoming conscious. It also pr otects the magician from any hostile occult influences which may assail him. To develop a banishing ritual, first acquire a magical weapon — a sword, a dagger, a wand, or perhaps a large ring. The instrument should be something which is impressive to the m ind and should also represent the aspirations of the magician. The advantages of hand forging one's own instruments, or discovering them in some strange way, cannot be over - emphasized. The banishing ritual should contain the following elements as a minimum . First, the magician describes a barrier about himself with the magical weapon. The barrier is also strongly visualized. Three dimensional figures are preferable. See figure 1 on page 20. Second, the magician focuses his will on a visualized image: for ex ample, the image of the magical weapon, or his own imagi nary third eye, or perhaps a ball of light inside his own A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 Figure 1.

Third, the barrier is reinforced with power symbols drawn with the magical weapon. The traditional five - pointed star or pentagram can be used, or the eight - pointed star of Chaos, or any other form. Words of pow er may also be used. Fourth, the magician aspires to the infinite void by a brief but determined effort to stop thinking. Sigils The magician may require something which he is unable to obtain through the normal channels. It is sometimes possible to bring about the required coincidence by the direct intervention of the will provided that this does not put too great a strain on the universe. The mere act of wanting is rarely effective, as the will becomes involved in a dialogue with the mind. This dilutes ma gical ability in many ways. The desire becomes part of the ego complex; the mind becomes anxious of failure. The will not to fulfill desire arises to reduce fear of failure. Soon the original desire is a mass of conflicting ideas. Often the wished for resu lt arises only when it has been forgotten. This last fact is the key to sigils and most forms of magic spell. Sigils work because they stimulate the will to work subconsciously, bypassing the mind. There are three parts to the operation of a sigil. The sig il is constructed, the sigil is lost to the mind, the sigil is charged. In constructing a sigil, the aim is to produce a glyph of desire, "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 a) Word method.

It is not necessary to use complex symbol systems. Figure 2 shows how sigils may be constructed from words, from images, and from sounds. The subject matter of these spells is arbitrary and not recommended. To succes sfully lose the sigil, both the sigil form and the associated desire must be banished from normal waking consciousness. The magician strives against any manifestation of either by a forceful turning of his attention to other matters. Sometimes the sigil ma y be burnt, buried, or cast into an ocean. It is possible to lose a word spell by constant repetition as this eventually empties the mind of associated desire. The sigil is charged at moments when the mind has achieved quiescence through magical trance, or when high emotionality paralyzes its normal functioning. At these times the sigil is concentrated upon, either as a mental image, or mantra, or as a drawn form. Some of the times when sigils may be charged are as follows: during magical trance; at the mom ent of orgasm or great elation; at times of great fear, anger, or embarrassment; or at times when intense frustration or disappointment arises. Alternatively, when another strong desire arises, this desire is sacrificed (forgot ten) and the sigil is concent rated on instead. After holding the sigil in the mind for as long as possible, it is wise to banish it by evoking laughter. A record should be kept of all work with sigils but not in such a way as to cause conscious deliberation over the sigilized desire."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 DREAMING The dream state provides a convenient egress into the fields of divination, entities, and exteriorization or \"out of the body\" experience. All humans dream each night of their lives, but few can regularly recount their experiences even a few min utes after waking. Dream experiences are so incongruous that the brain learns to prevent them interfering with waking consciousness. The magician aims to gain full access to the dream plane and to assume control of it. The attempt to do this invariably inv olves the magician in a deadly and bizzare battle with his own psychic censor, which will use almost any tactics to deny him these experiences. The only method of gaining full access to the dream plane is to keep a book and writing instrument next to the p lace of sleeping at all times. In this, record the details of all dreams as soon as possible after waking. To assume conscious control over the dream state, it is necessary to select a topic for dreaming. The magician should start with simple experiences, such as the desire to see a particular object (real or imaginary) and master this before attempting divination or exteriorization. The dream is set up by strongly visualizing the desired topic in an otherwise silenced mind, im mediately before sleep. For mo re complex experiences the method of sigils may be employed. A record of dreams is best kept separate from the magical record as it tends to become voluminous. However any significant success should be transferred into the magical diary. Though one may get to fear the sight of it, a properly kept magical record is the surest guarantor of success in the work of Liber MMM : it is both a work of reference with which to evaluate progress and most significantly, a goad to further effort.

The thinking mind has the property of splitting every thing it encounters into two, as it is a dualistic thing itself. Figure 3. The schema of Liber Lux. B A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 Yet there is a part of man which is of a singular nature, although the mind is unable to perceive it as such. Man considers himself a center of will and a center of perception. Will and perception are not separate but only appear so to the mind. The unity which appears to the m ind to exert the twin functions of will and perception is called Kia by magicians. Sometimes it is called the spirit, or soul, or life force, instead. Kia cannot be experienced directly because it is the basis of consciousness (or experience), and it has n o fixed qualities which the mind can latch on to. Kia is the consciousness, it is the elusive \"I\" which confers self - awareness but does not seem to consist of anything itself. Kia can sometimes be felt as ecstacy or inspiration, but it is deeply buried in the dualistic mind. It is mostly trapped in the aimless wanderings of thought and in identification with experience and in that cluster of opinions about ourselves called ego. Magic is concerned with giving the Kia more freedom and flexibility and with pro viding means by which it can manifest its occult power. Kia is capable of occult power because it is a fragment of the great life force of the universe. Consider the world of apparent dualisms we inhabit. The mind views a picture of this world in which eve rything is double. A thing is said to exist and exert certain properties. Being and Doing. This calls for the concepts of cause and effect or causality. Every phenomenon is seen to be caused by some previous thing. However this description cannot explain h ow everything exists in the first place or even how one thing finally causes another. Obviously things have originated and do continue to make each other happen. The \"thing\" responsible for the origin and contin ued action of events is called Chaos by magic ians. It could as well be called God or Tao, but the name Chaos is virtually meaningless, and free from the childish, anthropomorphic ideas of religion. Chaos is also the force which adds increasing complexity to the universe by spawning structures which w ere not inherent in its component parts. It is the force which has caused life to evolve itself out of dust, and is currently most concentratedly manifest"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 in the human life force, or Kia, where it is the source of conscious ness. Kia is but a small fragment of the great life force of the universe, which contains the twin impulses to immerse itself in duality and to escape from duality. It will continuously reincarnate until the first impulse is exhausted. The second impulse is the root of the mystic quest, t he union of the liberated spirit with the great spirit. To the extent that the Kia can become one with Chaos it can extend its will and perception into the universe to accomplish magic. Between Chaos and ordinary matter, and between Kia and the mind, there exists a realm of half formed substance called Aether. It is dualistic matter but of a very tenuous, probabilistic nature. It consists of all the possibilities which Chaos throws out which have not yet become solid realities. It is the \"medium\" by which t he \"non - existent\" chaos translates itself into \"real\" effects. It forms a sort of backdrop out of which real events and real thoughts materialize. Because aetheric events are only partially evolved into dualistic existence, they may not have a precise loca tion in space or time. They may not have a precise mass or energy either, and so do not necessarily affect the physical plane. It is from the bizarre and indeterminate nature of the aetheric plane that Chaos gets its name, for Chaos cannot be known directl y. From the aetheric realm of nascent possibility only what we call sensible, causal, probable, or normal events usually come into existence. Yet as centers of Kia or Chaos ourselves, we can sometimes call very unlikely coincidences or unexpected events in to existence by manipulating the aether. Such is magic. Even the physical sciences have begun to blunder into the aetheric with their discoveries of quantum indeterminacy and virtual processes in subatomic matter. It is the aether, which surrounds the cent ral core of the life force, with which the magician is concerned. Its normal function is as a Kia - thought intermediary, yet its properties are so infinitely mutable that almost anything can be accomplished with it. Thought gives it shape and Kia gives it p ower. Thus are will and perception extended into areas of time and space beyond the physical limitations of the material body.

The differences, however, are only superficial. When stripped of local symbolism and terminolo gy, all systems show a remarkable uniformity of method. This is because all systems ultimately derive from the tradition of Shamanism. It is toward an elucidation of this tradition that the following chapters are devoted."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 GNOSIS Altered states of consciousness are the key to magical powers. The particular state of mind required has a name in every tradition: No - mind. Stopping the internal dialogue, passing through the eye of the needle, ain or nothing, samadhi, or one - pointedness. In this book it will be known as Gnosis. It is an extension of the magical trance by other means. Methods of achieving gnosis can be divided into tw o types. In the inhibitory mode, the mind is progressively silenced until only a single object of concentration remains. In the excitatory mode, the mind is raised to a very high pitch of excitement while concentration on the objective is maintained. Stron g stimulation eventually elicits a reflex inhibition and paralyzes all but the most central function — the object of concentration. Thus strong in hibition and strong excitation end up creating the same effect — the one - pointed consciousness, or gnosis. Neu rophysiology has finally stumbled on what magicians have known by experience for millenia. As a great master once observed: \"There are two methods of becoming god, the upright or the averse.\" Let the mind become as a flame or a pool of still water. It is d uring these moments of single - pointed concentration, or gnosis, that beliefs can be implanted for magic, and the life force induced to manifest. Table 1 on page 33 shows a number of methods that can be used to attain it. The Death Posture is a feint at dea th to achieve an utter negation of thought. It can take many forms, ranging from the simple not - thinking exercise up to complex rituals. A very fast and simple method consists of blocking the ears, nose and mouth, and covering the eyes with the hands. The breath and thoughts are forcefully jammed back until near unconsciousness involuntarily breaks the posture. Alternatively, one may arrange oneself before a mirror at a distance of about two feet and stare fixedly at the image of one's eyes in the mirror wi th an unblinking, corpselike gaze. The effort required to keep an absolutely unwavering image will of itself silence the mind after a while.

This is achieved by judicious use of abstention and by arousing lust without any form of mental prop or fantasy. This exercise is also thera peutic. Be ye ever virgin unto Kia. The concentrations leading to magical trance are discussed in Liber MMM . Emotional arousal is me obverse form of this method. Emotive arousal of any sort can theoretically be used, even love or grief in extreme circumsta nces, but in practice only anger, fear, and horror can easily be generated in sufficient strengths to achieve the requisite effect. The well - known ability of fear and anger to paralyze the mind indicates their effectiveness, yet the magician must never los e sight of the objectives of his working. Nothing is to be gained and much may be lost by reducing oneself to jibbering idiocy or catatonia. Sleeplessness, fasting, and exhaustion are old monastic fa vorites. There should be a constant turning of the mind t oward the object of the exercise during these practices. Pain, torture, and flagellation have been used by witches, monks, and fakirs to achieve results. Surrender to pain brings eventual ecstasy and the necessary one - pointedness. However, if the organism' s resistance to pain is high, needless damage to the body may result before the threshold is crossed. Dancing, drumming, and chanting require careful arranging and preparation to bring the participants to a climax. Lyrical exaltation through emotive poetry , incantation, song, prayer, or supplication can also be added. The whole is best controlled by some form of ritual. Over - breathing is sometimes used to supple ment the effects of dancing or leaping. The right way of walking is not a technique for achieving immediate results but a meditation which helps the mind to stop thinking. One walks for long stretches without looking at any thing directly but by slightly crossing and unfocusing the eyes, maintaining a peripheral view of everything.

These beings have a legion of names drawn from the demonology of many cultures: elementals, familiars, incub i, succubi, bud - wills, demons, automata, atavisms, wraiths, spirits, and so on. Entities may be bound to talismans, places, animals, objects, persons, incense smoke, or be mobile in the aether. It is not the case that such entities are limited to obsession s and complexes in the human mind. Although such beings customarily have their origin in the mind, they may be budded off and attached to objects and places in the form of ghosts, spirits, or \"vibrations,\" or may exert action at a distance in the form of f etishes, familiars, or pol tergeists. These beings consist of a portion of Kia or the life force attached to some aetheric matter, the whole of which may or may not be attached to ordinary matter. Evocation may be further defined as the summoning or crea ti on of such partial beings to accomplish some purpose. They may be used to cause change in oneself, change in others, or change in the universe. The advantages of using a semi - independent being rather than trying to effect a transformation directly by will are several: the entity will continue to fulfill its function in dependently of the magician until its life force dissipates.

During moments of the possession by certain entities the magician may be the recipient of in spirations, abilities, and knowledge not normally accessible to him. Entities may be drawn from three sources — those which are discovered clairvoyantly, those whose characteristics are given in grimoires of spirits and demons, and those which the magician may wish to create himself. In all cases establishing a relationship with the spirit follows a simila r process of evocation. Firstly the attributes of the entity, its type, scope, name, appearance and characteristics must be placed in the mind or made known to the mind. Automatic drawing or writing, where a stylus is allowed to move under inspiration acro ss a surface, may help to uncover the nature of a clairvoyantly discovered being. In the case of a created being the following procedure is used: the magician assembles the ingredients of a composite sigil of the being's desired attributes. For example, to create an elemental to assist him with divination, the appropriate symbols might be chosen and made into a sigil such as the one shown in figure 4. A name and an image, and if desired, a characteristic number can also be selected for the elemental. Second ly, the will and perception are focused as intently as possible (by some gnostic method) on the elemental's sigils or characteristics so that these take on a portion of the magician's life force and begin autonomous existence. In the case of pre - existing b eings, this operation serves to bind the entity to the magician's will. This is customarily followed by some form of self - banishing, or even exorcism, to restore the magician's consciousness to normal before he goes forth. An entity of a low order with lit tle more than a singular task to perform can be left to fulfill its destiny with no further inter ference from its master. If at any time it is necessary to terminate it, its sigil or material basis should be destroyed and its mental image destroyed or reab sorbed by visualization.

To control such beings, the magicians may have to re - enter the gnostic state to t he same depth as before in order to draw their power. Any of the techniques of the gnosis can in theory be used in evocation. An analysis of some of the more common methods follows. Theurgic Ritual depends solely on visualization and concen tration on compl ex ceremonial to achieve focus. However the effect of increasing the complexity is often to create more distrac tion rather than draw attention to the matter at hand. Will becomes multiple and the result is often disappointing. Conjura - tion by prayer, suppl ication or command is rarely effective unless the appeal be desperate or prolonged till exhaustion ensues. This type of ritual can be improved by the use of poetic exaltation, chanting, ecstatic dancing, and drumming. The Goetic tradition of the grimoires uses an additional technique. Terror. The grimoires were compiled by Catholic priests, and much of what they wrote was deliberate abomination in their own terms. Transport the whole rite to a graveyard or crypt at midnight and one has compounded a powerful mechanism for concentrating the Kia by paralyzing the peripheral functions of the mind by fear. If the magician can maintain control under these conditions his will is singular and mighty. The Ophidian tradition uses sexual orgasm to focus the will and pe rception. It is interesting to note that poltergeist activity invariably centers around the sexually disturbed, usually children at puberty or, more rarely, women at menopause. During these periods of acute tension, intense excitation can channel the mind and allow the life force to manifest frustration outside of the body by hurling objects around. To perform evocation by the Ophidian method, the attri butes of an entity in sigilized form are concentrated on at orgasm and may be afterward anointed with the sex fluids. The process is rather like the deliberate creation of an obsession. If enough power can be put into it, it will be capable of independent existence."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37 Incubi and succubi are pre - existing entities created by other peoples' pathological sexuality. Incubi traditionally seek sexual intercourse with living females and succubi with males, often in sleep.

Unfortunately they are bot h predatory and stupid, with little power or motivation for anything but sex. Sacrifice has been used in the past to create fear or terror, or to invoke the gnosis of pain in support of Goetic type evoca tions. However, this method easily exhausts itself an d the sor cerer may end up wading in oceans of blood, much as the Aztecs did, for very little result. Blood sacrifice is most effective and most easily controlled by the use of one's own blood, which is customarily allowed to fall upon the sigil or talisman of the de mon. However, the power to control blood sacrifice usually brings with it the wisdom to avoid it in favor of other methods.

Metamorphosis may be pursued by seeking that which one is not, and transcending both in mutual annihilation. Alternatively, the process of invocation may be seen as adding to the magician's psyche any elements which are missing. It is true that the mind must be finally surrendered as one enters fully into Chaos, but a complete and balanced psychocos m is more easily surrendered. The magical process of shuffling beliefs and desires attendant upon the process of invocation also demonstrates that one's domi nant obsessions or personality are quite arbitrary, and hence more easily banished.

The actual method of invocation may be described as a total immersion in the qualities pertaining to the desired form. One invokes in every conceivable way. The magician first programs himself into identity with the god by arranging all his experiences to coincide with its nature. In the most elaborate form of ritual he may surround himself with the sounds, smells, colors, in struments, memories, numbers, symbols, music, and poetry sug gestive of the god or quality. Secondly he unites his life force to the god image with which he has united his mind. This is accom plished with techniques from the gnosis. Figure 5 shows some ex amples of maps of the mind.

He is robed in crimson and the skin of a great bear or wolf. He is girded about with weapons of steel, and an iron crown (or helmet) adorns his head. He has prepared his body by fasting, by rigors, by scourging, and by stimulants. He has constantly turned his mind to things of Mars during the preparations. He casts su lphur, oak, and acris resins into the thurible and anoints his body with tiger balm. He beats a martial air upon a drum to open the temple, or else fires a loud weapon into the air. He has banished all foreign influences from the mind by what means he may (a pentagram ritual being preferred). Drawing blood from his right shoulder with a dagger, he traces the sigil of Mars on his breast and the Eye of Horus on his brow. With a sharp sword, he draws the symbols of Mars about him in his mind's eye in lines of crimson fire and visualizes himself in the form of the god Horus. Then he begins his war dance while an assistant, if he has one, continues to beat the rhythm, apply the scourge, or discharge firearms.

The Great Mad Goddess Chaos, a lower aspect of the ultimate ground of existence in anthropomorphic form, can be invoked for Her ecstasy and inspiration.

It is a mistake to consider any belief more liberated than another. It is the possibility of change which is important. Every new form of liberation is destined to ev entually become another form of enslavement for most of its adherents. There is no freedom from duality on this plane of existence, but one may at least aspire to choice of duality. Liberating behavior is that which increases one's possibilities for future action. Limiting behavior is that which tends to narrow one's options. The secret of freedom is not to be drawn into situations where one's number of alternatives becomes limited or even unitary. This is an abominably difficult path to tread. It means ste p ping outside of one's own culture, society, relationships, family personality, beliefs, prejudices, opinions and ideas. It is just these comforting chains which seem to give definition, meaning, char acter, and a sense of belonging to most people. Yet, in casting off one set of chains, one cannot avoid adopting another set unless one wishes to live in a very reduced and impoverished style — itself a limitation. The solution is to become omnivorous. Someone who can think, believe, or do any of a half dozen d ifferent things is more free and liberated than someone confined to only one activity.

This energy strengthens the spirit and gives courage for further acts of insurrection. Put a brick through your television; explore sexualities whic h are unusual to you.

Whatever is suppressed, restricted, ridiculed, or despised, almost always contains a telling counterpoint to mainstream ideas. In argument always disagree, especially if your opponent begins to voice your own opinions. Iconoclasm: Breaking Images Immense gulfs exist in human aff airs between theory and practice, means and ends. Contrast pornography and romance, cordon bleu gluttony and skeletal famine, dignity and masturbation. Consider violence as entertainment. Mass slaughter for idealism's sake. Look at what goes on in the name of religion and the consumer society. Relish the cacophony of neurosis, fantasy, and psychosis which guides material sensationalist culture to an uncertain end.

This operation is traditionally known as attaining the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. It is sometimes known as the Magnum Opus or Great Work. The Augoeides may be defined as the most perfect vehicle of Kia on the plane of duality. As the avatar of Kia on earth, the Augoeides represents the true will, the raison d'etre of the magician, his purpose in existing. The discovery of one's true will or real nature may be difficult and fraught with danger, since a false identificat ion leads to obsession and madness. The operation of obtaining the knowledge and conversation is usually a lengthy one. The magician is attempting a progressive metamorphosis, a complete overhaul of his entire existence. Yet he has to seek the blueprint fo r his reborn self as he goes along. Life is less the meaningless accident it seems. Kia has incarnated in these particular conditions of duality for some purpose. The in ertia of previous existences propels Kia into new forms of man ifestation. Each incarnat ion represents a task, or a puzzle to be solved, on the way to some greater form of completion. The key to this puzzle is in the phenomena of the plane of duality in which we find ourselves. We are, as it were, trapped in a labyrinth or maze. The only thin g to do is move about and keep a close watch on the way the walls turn. In a completely chaotic universe such as this one, there are no accidents. Everything is signifcant.

Keeping a close eye on the walls of the labyrinth, the con ditions of his existence, the magician may then begin his invoca tion. The genius is not something added to oneself. Rather it is a stripping away of excess to reveal the god within. Directly on awakening, preferably at dawn, the initiate goes to the place of invocation. Figuring to himself as he goes that being born anew each day brings with it the chance of greater rebirth, first he banishes the temple of his mind by ritual or by some magica l trance. Then he unveils some token or symbol or sigil which represents to him the Holy Guardian Angel. This symbol he will likely have to change during the great work as the inspiration begins to move him. Next he invokes an image of the Angel into his m ind's eye. It may be considered as a luminous duplicate of one's own form standing in front of or behind one, or simply as a ball of brilliant light above one's head. Then he formulates his aspirations in what manner he will, humbling himself in prayer or exalting himself in loud proclamation as his need be. The best form of this invocation is spoken spontaneously from the heart, and if halting at first, will prove itself in time. He is aiming to establish a set of ideas and images which correspond to the n ature of his genius, and at the same time receive inspiration from that source.

Some of the variou s densities of the aether have only a partial or probablistic differentiation into existence, and are somewhat indeterminate in space and time. In the same way that mass exists as a curvature in space - time, extending with a gradually diminishing force to i nfinity that we recognize as gravity, so do all events, particularly events involving the human mind, send ripples through all creation. Various methods of intercepting and interpreting these rip ples constitute the mantic art or divination. These ripples t hrough space and time can only be received if they strike a note of resonance in the receiver and are not drowned out by noise or suppressed by the psychic sensor. Some forms of resonance exist naturally, as between a mother and child, or between lovers. O therwise, they have to be established by concentrating on the object of divination. The general level of mental noise can be suppressed by silencing the mind by some gnostic method. This also assists with the concentration. The inhibitory mode of the gnosi s is most frequently used. Sleeplessness, fasting, and exhaustion may cause prescience through visions, but as with drugs, there is always the difficulty of maintaining concentration. Any form of magical trance can be adapted for divination by first direct ing an intense concentration toward the desired matter of divination (or some sigilized form of it) and then allowing impression to arise into the Vacuous state of consciousness. Many of the excitatory techniques can be used, but some with difficulty. Augu ry may be made by sacrifice, and men have tortured themselves for knowledge, but sex is the easiest.

This is not always possible, and recourse must often be had to the use of symbolic intermediari es. These can augment the practice of divination greatly or ruin it utterly. Assuming that the magical perception can forge some sort of tenuous connection with the answer to a question, symbols are shuffled, drawn, or selected in some manner to carry the answer into the conscious mind. Then a further effort must be made in the interpretation to get that magical perception to come into com plete manifestation. Symbols are easy to come by; any system can be used — the difficulty lies in forging the magic link . In obtaining the symbolic result, the magician tries to let the magic slip through below the level of conscious control, but must not let the process become merely random. For example, in cartomancy or Tarot divination, one should look through the pack f irst and then shuffle but lightly, or the result will be completely random, and the chances of the spread being able to stimulate the magical perception will be reduced. Once the symbol has been obtained, it should be used to help the magical perception cr ystallize more fully. It should become a basis for lateral thinking (or intuitive guesswork) rather than as a final answer to be mechanically interpreted. Astrology is not a valid form of magical divination because it assumes a causal relationship between events which are linked only very weakly if at all. If the relationship were strong, then astrology would be an ordinary secular science. As the relationship is very weak, astrology owes whatever success it has to the natural prescience of its practitioner s and obscures its failures with im precision, evasiveness and ambiguity. The best methods of obtaining symbolic intermediate results are those which are just below the threshold of deliberateness, but above the threshold of pure randomness.

The creation of direct effects, like prescience in divination, represents a high point in the art and is just as elusive. Making things happen by either method is referred to as the art of enchanting or the casting of enchantments. From a magical point of view, it is axiomatic that we have created the world in which we exist. Looking about himself, the magician can say \"thus have I willed,\" or \"thus do I perceive,\" or more accura tely, \"thus does my Kia manifest.\" It may seen strange to have willed such limiting circum stances, but any form of dualistic manifestation or existence implies limits. If the Kia had willed a different set of limitations, it would have incarnated elsewhere . The tendency of things to continue to exist, even when unobserved, is due to their having their being in Chaos. The magician can only change something if he can \"match\" the Chaos which is upholding the normal event. This is the same as becoming one with the source of the event. His will becomes the will of the universe in some particular aspect. It is for this reason that people who witness real magical happenings at close range are sometimes overcome with nausea and may even die. The part of their Kia or life force which was upholding the normal reality is forcibly altered when the abnormal occurs. If this type of magic is attempted with a number of people working in perfect synchronization, it works much better. Conversely, it is even more difficult to p erform in front of many persons, all of whom are upholding the ordinary course of events. In trying to develop the will, the most fatal pitfall is to confuse will with the chauvinism of the ego. Will is not will power, virility, obstinancy, or hardness. Wil l is unity of desire.

Desires are re - arranged before an act, not during it. In all things he must live like this. As reorganization of belief is the key to liberation, so is reorganization of desire the key to will. In practice, many difficulties can be gotten around by using v arious types of sigil.

All these serve as a focus for the will. Concentration on these spells should be augmented by some form of gnostic exaltation to cast the enchantment. When considering any form of enchantment, remember this: it is infinitely easier to manipulate events while they are still embryonic or at their inception. Thus d oes the magician turn that aspect of Chaos which manifests as causality to his advantage, rather than oppose it. The desire then manifests as a convenient, but strange, coincidence, rather than as a startling discontinuity. The will may be strengthened by one other technique aside from the concentrations of magical trance, and that is by luck. The magician should observe the current of his luck in small, inconsequential matters, find the conditions for its success, and try to extend his luck in various smal l ways.

Existence is the great indulgence. Anythi ng less than this, any attempt to avoid part of oneself is to invite loss of form, a self - negation leading to a shrinkage of spirit. The Self alone is God and should recognize itself in all things. For those who uphold limited values bind themselves to med ioc rity and failure.

The advantage of using such material bases is that the power residing in them can be built up over a period. Four main types of material base are used. Those which contain reserves of a partic ular type of power such as fetishes, talismans, spirit traps and amulets; those which act to carry some effect to its target like powders, philtres, wax images, and knotted cords; those which act as a basis to receive divinatory impressions; and those whic h act as an anchor for some aetheric form which can be sent like a magical weapon. In addition, blood and semen may be used as sources of the life force. Various other bodily secreta and excreta: hair, fingernails, spittle, etc., can be used to provide mag ical links with target persons. Talismans, amulets and fetishes are charged by a process analogous to evocation. Talismans are usually the recipient of some simple charge that evokes strength, courage, health, virility, no - mind, sleep, or some other emotio n, or state of power in its possessor when he concentrates on it. If the talisman is well enough made, it should continue to evoke its effect even when it is not being used for concentration. The form and composition of the material base should be suggesti ve of the desired effect. Amulets are objects containing a portion of the aetheric and life force with a particular task to perform and are semi - sentient. They can only be created by the strongest forms of evocation. They are fashioned in the form of a sma ll man or creature, and during the evocation an aetheric duplicate is placed inside the material form. They are most commonly made to protect places or persons within a short radius of action. When such things are created by a group or tribe of persons ove r a long period, they are known as fetishes. Any sort of material base is a spirit trap in some way, but some substances, notably crystals, absorb aetheric imprints very readily. Quartz crystals, which are large and readily available, can be used to pick u p impressions by leaving them near charged places, persons, or objects. If a spirit or elemental is A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 62 discovered to be inhabiting some place it can be trapped by plunging a crystal into its form. Enchantment by sorcery is carried out with the aid of various powders, philtres, concoctions, wax images, and knotted cords. The material base can be composed of anything suggestive of the desired result and may include possessions or parts of the body of the intended victim. As the material base is being compounded, the magician does everything possible with concentration, visualization, and gnostic exaltation to imprint his desire into it. The charged matter is then taken and placed where the victim will come in contact with it. Instruments of sorcery also find thei r uses in the mantic art. Most divinatory tools serve only to receive impressions from the operator's magical perception. Charged instruments contain a residium of formless aetheric energy which actually amplify the impressions. Most devices in this class are magical mirrors, crystal spheres, highly polished surfaces, and pools of dark liquid or blood. The Mirror of Darkness is an instrument fashioned from black glass or natural obsidian. It should be carried concealed close to the body. It may be charged b y using it as a focus for concentration in the magical trance of no - mindedness. One gazes into it unwaveringly for long periods until it opens like a pit or tunnel beneath one. Only after this aetheric tunnel has developed is the mirror of darkness ready f or use. The perception reaches through the tunnel as the will directs it to other regions of time and space. Magical weapons are created by building an aetheric dupli cate of some existing device such as a wand, sword, dagger, pointed bone, or dart. The aet heric form is kept inside the materi al base until projected forth by a strong focusing of the will. Skilled sorcerers are able to reach through the mirror of darkness to the target or victim and hurl the magical weapon down after it. Close proximity or eve n contact with the target is otherwise required. Personal blood sacrifice may be made to a magical weapon, or it may be made the focus of an orgiastic rite and anointed with sexual fluids.

It is most commonl y seen or ex perienced when the physical body passes close to death. It does not have a definite fixed shape, although there is a natural tendency for the life force to hold it in the same image as the physical body. Even when it is exteriorized in the body 's image it is not necessarily visible to ordinary perception. Like all aetheric matter, its effects on ordinary reality are variable and depend on the ability of the life force to make a real effect coalesce at some point. Thus, the double is able to pene trate solid matter, but at other times it may have a degree of tangibility and be able to effect material happenings. In the occult martial arts, it is projected just beyond the striking surfaces of the body by visualization and a sharp yell which accompan y the physical blow. A portion of the aetheric force may even be left inside the opponent to cause what is called the delayed death touch. The force may also be projected beyond the body to inform one of the movement of enemies behind and projected to the body's surfaces toward off blows. In most forms of psychic heal ing, this same force is projected, commonly through the hands. The double may also be made to take on various alternative forms, most commonly animal form. Theriomorphic (beast - like) manifestat ions of the double are often atavistic. They cause a form of possession by the behavior patterns of the animal concerned. These patterns may lie dormant in our memory, or it may be that we have access to aetheric memories. Whatever their source, these atav isms create terrifying effects. Even if the aetheric beast form is kept within the physical body, it may manifest as strange physical prowess, the ability to cower wild animals and confuse and frighten we humans. Projected beyond the body it can serve as a vehicle for the consciousness to experience the mode of travel and abilities of the animal."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 65 Skilled magicians may attempt bizarre composite forms like gryphons and basilisks as magical vehicles. In the normal cycle of birth and death, the life force carri es little or nothing from one incarnation to the next. The projection of the double is the basis of deliberately carrying things over into a new incarnation at death. Of all the techniques of gaining access to the double, narcosis is the least controllable and most dangerous. Nevertheless, since time immemorial magicians have been smearing themselves with pastes compounded from the solanaceae alkaloids, thornapple, nightshade and henbane, and consuming various other halluci nogens and trance inducing drugs a s well, just for this purpose. Visualization is the weakest technique used on its own, but it can act as a model on which to build that peculiar bodily sensation which comes from movements in the aether. Sometimes it is felt as heat, as a sort of itching, or as an ache. One can only persist with imagining something until a sensation develops. Sharp, high pitched yells and exhalations of breath are used to help project the force in martial arts and occult yogas. Dreaming is the most challenging and complete method of freeing the double. Ordinary dreams are an ingenius jumble of half - forgotten events, hopes and worries. They are a more graphic form of the mental chattering, fantasizing, and daydreaming that the waking mind does. In the same way that the day mi nd learns to differentiate between real things and fantasy, so can the dream consciousness learn the difference between real and fantasy dreams. Real dreams are the key to the double. The first step in creating the double is to establish it in a real dream . The hands are the most easily visible part of the body. Dream consciousness is particularity linked to the sense of sight. The magician strives to see the hands of his double in dream. The desire to do this is concentrated on intently before sleep every night for as long as it takes success to crown one's work. During this time the hands may feature in many ordinary, idle dreams which may become very complex and bizarre. This is not the desired result. Success is an abrupt and discontinuous experience.

Chaos, the life force of the universe, is not human - hearted. Therefore the wizard cannot be human - hearted when he seeks to tap the force of the universe. He performs monstrous and arbitrary acts to loosen th e hold of human limitations upon himself. The magical life demands the abandonment of comfort, conventionality, security and safety — for competition, combat, extremes, and adversity are needed to produce higher resolutions and personal evolution. An air o f desperation is required in a life lived close to the edge. One must be living by one's wits. In a stagnant environment the body - mind creates its own adversity — disease and fantasy. Only in extremes can the spirit discover itself. A fluid en vironment is required as a vessel for magical consciousness. Only a fluid environment can conform to beliefs about it and be subject to the subtle magic forces. Only in mutable circumstances can divination come into its own. Therefore abandon all fixed patterns of resi dence, employ ment, relationship and taste. Among the titles of Kia is Anon. Anon freely transmogrifies its arbitrary personality, refusing any identity defined by its en vironment. Residing in the ultimate freedom possible on the plane of illusion, it has c hoice of duality. Everything which exists for it is a form of desire, for this is the universe in which it willed to incarnate. If this were believed to be either heaven or hell one would feel free to do anything. It is only the fear that it is neither whi ch imprisons us. The idea of mind or ego as a fixed attribute or possession of Self is illusory.

Gazing at his own eyes the initiate stops thinking. No amount of \"effort\" in the usual sense will avail. In finite patience will barely suffice. The attention must be con tinually turned to the eye image until the thinking eventually gives up. Any sort of distortion of the image is symptomatic of thinking and to be avoided. Success is characterized by certain phe nomena for which it is useless to strive. There may be a loss of physical perspective or body image. The body may begin to feel vast or microscopic.

He may be granted the grace of being swept up onto the divine madness of ecstatic laughter. The death posture is chief among the rites of Thanateros for it can be applied to inspire, rei fy, and exhaust, as well as transcend, desire. Normal congress, the genital embrace of persons of opposed sexes, should in any manifestation, magical or not, inspire the participants with something, if only mutual attachment. Em ployed magically it can prov ide amplified inspiration for almost anything. The lunar current of the priestess is observed for a day in which the libido is strong. In the priest, the libido is strengthened by conservation. Retiring to the place of working, each attains the silence of the mind by any favored method. For example, they may kneel before each other in the dragon position and perform the preliminaries of the death posture. Then they become conjoined in a stimulatory embrace. As congress occurs the subject for inspiration or its sigil is meditated on as the mountain of excitation is gradually climbed. As the final step is taken the desire is abandoned to the subconscious. After the cataclysm the cele brants aim to remain vacuous but alert, to allow the inspiration to manifest. The reification, or making real, of a desire is possible through the autoerotic mode of the quadriga sexualis. In this the mind is kept blank while the sexuality is ignited and brought to a pitch by touch alone. The body is in a supine position, eyes close d with all other senses annulled as far as possible.

Most of all they show themselves in the mind of man impelling him to love, to war, to fortune, or to disaster. The gods watch over everything in the world; there is no thing not under the auspices of some god or other. For in all things there is both substance and essence. The gods came out of Chaos, and from the gods came the essences of all things — some gods giving essences to some things and others to different things. Man contains the essences of all the gods. What is good or what is ill i s what is pleasing or displeasing to the gods. But what is pleasing to Mars may not please Venus. Hence there is war in heaven even as there is war in man.

God also created angels and demons. These are spirits with free will, Some rema ined good, some became evil. These spirits help man to become good Or tempt him to do evil.

You may worship him with prayer also. By this he will be pleased.

Let's stick to what's real, shall we? There is always some sort of a reason or explanation for everything even if we haven't managed to work it all out yet. But we're doing pretty well. I mean, you've only to look around yourself, the whole universe works on a sensible cause and effect basis; it's only hocus pocus if you're too pr imitive to work out how it works.

Science can probably explain away everything. There is nothing which is not caused by some thing else. But this is no - explanation. The world now seems accidental, arbitrary, and without meaning. We can know How e verything happens but there is no reason Why. The universe has become predictable but meaning less. That is the burden of intelligence, of being able to see through it all. There is obviously no spirit or personal survival after death. Hence there is no rea son to do anything, or for that matter, to restrain from doing anything. Even this is to deceive ourselves for there is no such thing as free will. One cannot help but get involved in doing because one happens to be. All motivation is just an attempt to pu t the body - brain in a lower energy, less tense state, even if by a roundabout route. There are no absolutes in terms of importance, goodness, meaning or truth that do not arise from the accidental structure of the body brain and its surroundings. We are ju st living out the chaotically complex forces which spawned us and which will one day reduce us to nothingness again.

The following Alphabet of Desire includes all the basic root emotions arranged as complementary dualisms in a form suggestive of the classical gods, or Ruach of Kabbala. Pagan philosophers saw human qualities mirrored in nature and cast these giant reflections of themselves as gods. It is there fore unsurprising that most pagan cosmologies contain a complete spectrum of our psychology in god form. The mai n divisions of emotion have been equated with planetary god forms. Each of these principles manifests in three important forms represented here by the alchemical principles of The Mercurial (exalting, spiritual) form indicates the cathartic, ecstatic, gn ostic mode. Over - stimulation of any emotive function creates a mental paroxysm in which the whole consciousness may be caught up. This is experienced as a great release or catharsis, and at higher levels, ecstasy. Finally, the one - pointed conscious ness ess ential to mysticism and magic may supervene in which the life force can act directly. The gnostic condition is also the key to radical changes of belief or conversion. Any belief presented in this condition is likely to be retained due to the hypersuggesti bility of the vacuous state of the mind. The Sulphurous (quickening, active) form indicates the ordinary basic drives to copulate, to destroy, to be attracted by favorable stimuli and repelled by harmful ones.

It turns in on itself rather than seek fulfillment in action or esctacy. The greater duality which rules all emotions is shown in Table 2.

The first aeon comes out of the mists of time. It was an age of Shamanism and Magic when the rulers of men had a firm grasp of the psychic forces. Such forces conferred a high survival value on puny naked man living in intimate communion with the dangers of a hostile environment. This form of consciousness has left its mark in the various underground traditions of witchc raft and sorcery. It has also survived in the hands of several aboriginal cultures in which the powers were used to enforce social conformity. The second Pagan aeon arose with a more settled way of life as agriculture and city dwelling began. As more compl ex forms of thought arose and men moved further away from nature, the knowledge of psychic forces became confused. Gods, spirits, and superstition uneasily filled the gaps created by loss of natural knowledge and man's expanding awareness of his own mind. The third, or Monotheistic, aeon arose inside of the pagan civilizations and swept their old form of consciousness away. The experiment was begun once in Egypt but failed. It really came into its own with Judaism and later with Christianity and Islam, whic h were offshoots of this. In the East, Buddhism was the form it took. In the monotheistic aeon men worshipped a singular, idealized form of themselves. The Atheistic aeon arose within Western monotheistic cultures and began to spread throughout the world, although the process is far from complete. It is far from being a mere negation of monotheistic ideas. It contains the radical and positive notions that the universe can be understood and manipulated by careful observation of the behavior of material thing s. The existence of spiritual beings is considered to be a question without any real meaning. Men look toward their emotional experience as the only ground of meaning.

Thus sorcery tainted pagan civilizations and even our own. Paganism taints Catholicism, and Protestantism. The time required for a leading culture to break through into a new aeon shortens as history progresses. The Atheistic aeon began several hundred years ago. The Monotheis tic aeon began two and a half to three thousand years ago. The Pagan aeon began about six thousand years ago with the begin nings of civilization, while the first Shama nistic aeon goes back to the dawn of humanity. There are signs that the fifth aeon is developing exactly where it might be expected — within leading sections of the foremost atheistic cultures. The evolution of consciousness is cyclic in the form of an upw ard spiral. The fifth aeon represents a return to the conscious ness of the first aeon but in a higher form. Chaoist philosophy will again become a dominant in tellectual and moral force. Psychic powers will increasingly be looked to for solutions to man's p roblems. A series of general and specific prophecies may be extrapolated from current trends to show how this will come about, and what role the Illuminati will play in it. Decades, possibly centuries, of warfare lie ahead. The rem nants of monotheism are c ollapsing fast, despite the odd revival, before secular humanism and consumerism. The technological, atheist super - states are trying for a stranglehold on human con sciousness. We are entering a phase which may become as op pressive to the spirit as medieval monotheism. The production/ consumption equation is becoming increasingly difficult to grasp or balance as the consumer religion of the masses begins to dictate politics. More and more mechanisms for the forceful regulation of behavior have to be introduc ed as population density pushes individuals to seek ever more bizarre forms of satisfaction in material sensationalism. The problem with any belief system is its tenacity and inertia once it is established and dominant. The medieval religions murdered mill ions to protect their own hege mony.

Prejudice against the possibility of the occult or supernatural will give away in the face of a developing Magical Technology. Telepathy, telekinesis, mind influence, hypnosis, fascination, and charisma will be systematically ex amined, refined, and exploited as meth ods of control.

He might simply withdraw his manifestation from the plane of duality entirely and cease to exist. For out of Chaos ari se the two prime forces of existence, the solve et coagula of existence. The Light power and the Dark. The light power is the expanding, outgoing, dualizing, increasing expression of Chaos, responsible for the new birth, creation, incarnation, and variety. The dark power is the contracting, returning, transcending, withdrawing expression of Chaos, responsible for death, dissolution, reabsorption simplicity and re turn to the source. These twin forces lie at the root of all mystic quests and all forms of magi cal and mundane action. They are the basic spiritual principles of the universe. Adherents of one will always call the other black. Thus the expansion into existence can as easily be called the dark ascent into matter, and the withdrawal from existence can be called the return to the light. But this is mere moral philosophy and ultimately devoid of meaning. The positive and negative paths of magic converge and form a unity which itself diverges from the mystic paths. While mysticism is at the root concerned with following either the light power or the dark, magic aims to play the one off against the other. The magician aims to become a center of creation and destruction himself, a living manifestation of the Chaos force within the realm of duality, a complet e microcosm, a god.

The adept may require these abilities to accomp lish his will on earth, or he may simply wish to develop them as a test of the mystic abilities. Operations of this kind may be classified according to the density and origin of the aetheric forces employed. Operation of the dense aether is used to accompl ish gross feats such as levitation and the short range occult martial arts. The force responsible for this resides in the belly just above the navel and may be extruded in lines of force to any part of the body and to locations outside the body's surface t o a distance of several meters. Levitation (which includes the ability to walk on water and fire, as well as in the air, or at fantastic rates across the earth) is accomplished by supporting the body's weight with these aetheric force lines. In the case of firewalking, the force is used to repel the heat and flames. To get these force lines to come from the body, the adept sits cross - legged on the ground and attempts to jump like a frog from this awkward position. The exercise is usually conducted in darkne ss and the jumps attempted with the lungs fully inflated. Within as little as three years' practice, one may begin to learn how to exert the aetheric force against the ground. A cushion may be used to protect the tissues of the posterior in the meantime. M ovement of the force within the body is easier to achieve and most commonly is approached by trying to develop a warmth or itching sensation at various points. The adept should be able to free himself from the attack of virtually any form of disease and en sure longevity by directing the psychic force to any site of weakness. If the force can be drawn to the hands, then it may be projected just beyond for healing purposes or to deal fatal blows to an enemy.

The adept ma y begin to strengthen his abilities by selecting a small specimen of plant life and trying to make it wilt and wither by the force of his unaided will. As it begins to succumb he may reverse the current of his will and resuscitate it again. He may practice telepathic contact with various beasts, dogs being particularly suitable for this purpose. At odd moments he may pick various persons around him and make them stand up, sit down, or move around and do particular things. One of the classical tests of psych ic ability is the power of casting an aura of subjective invisibility about oneself. This does not involve any alteration in one's optical properties, but sur rounding persons are somehow prevented from noticing one's presence. The complementary ability to this is the projection of an aura of charisma or fascination which may have application in the formation of sundry cults and messianic sects.

The Chaosphere may be given a material form which acts as an anchor to locate its chaotic and aetheric manifestations. The shape shown in figure 13 is only one of a number of possibilities. It consists of a sphere with eight arrows radiant directed toward the vertices of a cube.
