The first was entitled ìBook Of Daniel: Fact or Fiction?î, My second book is named ìHistorical Calendar Of Jesusî since the former work establishes the genuine historicity of the prophet Daniel, and his autograph manuscript as pre- sented in the ìBiblia Hebraicaî, Leningrad MS.B19A Kittel/stuttgartensia consonantal texts, which are available as freeware in the normal (BHS) and morphological (BHM) format from the ìonline-bibleî website, which text comprises the predominantly Hebrew part of the Old Testament and its few Aramaic portions (Gen.31:47a; Ezra 4:8-6:18; 7:12- 26; Jer.10:11; and Daniel 2:4-7:28). Subsequent to my research of this codex to the sacred scriptures, Iíve since discovered that the editio Vulgata is the principal translation of the Judeo-Xian Bible, because Sophronius Eusebius Hieronymus, bka St. Jerome, was sufficiently adept in the classic astro- logical and mythological basis of the scriptures as to bring both old and new testaments to life ó to the degree that western thought can more easily relate herein the 21st century of the Roman calendar. Also, because my first two books are so closely related, Iíve integrated parts of my 1st book into this new and expanded Historical Calendar Of Jesus, brought up to date using ìAstrolog w/Swiss Ephemerisî plus the knowledge that judicial astrology has awarded the practitioner having mastered both kabalah & tarot, and having demonstrated note-for-note what the ìmusic of the spheresî actually is, and how it is calculated, and what its articulated names are as they are transposed through the 84 Key Signatures of the Gods, the ìkeysî of life. When I first wrote this book, I wasnít using my trademark PGP-signature and full, hy- phenated justification as I have done faithfully since the summer of 2000 AD. I have however employed hard line-breaks and Iíve PGP-clearsigned every chapter in my new, expanded edi- tion of The Historical Calendar of Jesus as posted online and thereby permanently archived on the ìGoogleî newsgroup server, which guarantees the autograph authenticity of every line of every chapter of this original book except where otherwise explicitly noted by citations and/or quoted text. It should also be noted that, although Iíve updated this book using the latest JPL DE-406/Sweph ephemeris software, all of the original editionís calendar dates and correspond- ing events remain intact. Only astronomical calculations are slightly more accurate, and these chapters have been expanded and redacted as my ability permits. Enjoy!

This provides the reader with a quick and easy way to ìskim thruî each chapter from the beginning, enticing the more astute and critical scientist to carefully study the balance of each chapter as the facts warrant. The ancient Hebrew calendar is refer- enced to our western calendars, and is charted at the end of chapters where a visual reference to the dates analyzed is useful. Know that the ìSeventy Weeksî prophecy found at Daniel 9:24-27 is demonstrated histori- cally accurate-to-the-day, i.e. 483 actual, real-time, Hebrew lunisolar calendar years after the date that the priestly scribe Ezra had gone forward with Artaxerxesí imperial edict to restore and build Jerusalem. Lord Jesus quoted Daniel as being ìthe prophetî [ref. Mat 24:15; Mark 13:14], a fact which is cited as the *supreme* authority endorsing Danielís autograph as genu- ine. Thus the balance of this work is presented as a matter of record, in the spirit of God. While the secular crowd will oft-digress to frivolous innuendo (i.e. cavilism) in futile at- tempts to discredit the Holy Bible and its message which is the gospel of Christ-crucified, such inevitably has the antithetical effect of attracting much-appreciated scrutiny over the Hebrew & Greek Canon, since the evidence weighs heavily in the gravity of its merit, and the wisdom of the ages remains intact, fully intact. The first edition of this book relied on planetary positions as calculated using the older high-precision (untruncated) VSOP87 [Variations Seculaires des Orbites Planetaires] theory of Bretagnon and Francou, with all lunar positions calculated using the revised (untruncated) ELP-2000/82 lunar theory of Chapront-Touze and J. Chapront [Bureau des Longitudes]. This new and expanded edition uses Astrolog 5.41G with Swiss Ephemeris (JPL-DE200/ 405/406) for all astronomical calculations. At this writing, September 2003, this is the most reliable and accurate astronomical and astrological computer software available for any PC running Windows, and accounts for dynamical time, ecliptic obliquity, nutation, precession, aberration, and more complex calculations made using high-precision algorithms and coeffi- cient tables rendering the significant figures indicated, yielding accuracy for geocentric posi- tions comfortably within ± several arcseconds for all dates calculated, albeit the Moonís position is especially difficult to compute, and is probably accurate to no better than just a few arcminutes, which is still way more than adequate for the purposes of this historically un- precedented work."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Historical Calendar Of Jesus iv Geographical location datum preset to Jerusalem, Israel 31N46:48 x 35E13:12 for all as- tronomical calculations presented, with local times given in both UT and Jerusalem Standard Time [JST/EET @ UT +2:00] for convenience and continuity, noting that local mean time is approximately 20 minutes ahead of EET, or UT +2:20, which is used only rarely in this book, and only where ìLMTî is clearly indicated, as with both Jesusí and Johnís natal charts which are presented in chapters 2 and 3, respectively. ìLATî or Local Angle Time is sundial-time, and is used only where so-noted. In every instance, times & dates given are explicitly referenced. Remember that each day in the lunisolar calendar begins at sundown the day before, and ends at sundown that same day; e.g., the Julian calendar date Thursday, September 19, 457 BC is counted as the Hebrew/Jewish calendar date of 1 Ethanim/Tishri 3305, but the ancient Hebrew calendar reckons that old Julian [Roman] calendar Thursday as beginning at sundown on the previous day, which is Wednesday evening in the proleptic Julian calendar. This ìsun- down-to-sundownî convention of the scriptures is found beginning in the Torah [Law of Moses], in the Book of Genesis chapter 1 verse 5: ìAnd God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.î With the eve- ning counted from sundown to sunrise and the morning counted from sunrise to sunset, so the Hebrew calendar is always about six hours ahead of the Roman calendar in terms of what day of the week it is, a fact which proves invaluable for positively identifying historical calen- dar dates only alluded to or implied in the Bible, notably which lunisolar calendar dates were established by strictly-observed Torah calendar rules, which the reader will find is absolutely, meticulously, observed throughout this book. Notably the Mayan calendar, which is the most accurate long-term astronomical calendar in existence, predicted the conjunction of our winter solstice Sun with the Mayan Sacred Tree, or the apparent intercept of the galactic and ecliptic planes at 5 degrees Sagittarius, which great tropical-sidereal conjunction ends the fifth and last age of the Sun for this seventh grand precessional year of the Mayan calendar, and furthermore completes a sabbath of great preces- sional years or ì7. millenary profoundly deducedî as Nostradamus so exactly describes it in his prophetic epistle toward the ill-fated king Henry II of France.

This is the lunisolar cycle, and is used for the everyday Jewish calendar, and for observing tra- ditional ìholy daysî (holidays) as the God of Moses commanded: ìAnd God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years.îó Gen 1:14 AV While the lunisolar calendar methodology predates Moses by many many thousands & likely millions of years, we can be certain that it is far older than just 3800 some-odd years ago when Moses had introduced it circa 1800 BC. At least, the Torah calendar of Moses has been continuously in use by the Hebrew/Jewish people since that time, and with the holy con- vocations of the Torah even today being observed right in season, which sacred observances even Lord Jesus faithfully practiced from His youth up until the Passover of 31 AD, at which time He became Godís Passover Lamb, and He was slaughtered. Weíll cover much, much more on this astronomical chronology in the proceeding chapters. The Julian or old civil calendar was invented by the Greek scholar and Alexandrian astronomer Sosigenes in 44 BC at the be- hest of Gaius Julius CÊsar (CÊsar died later that same year), although this revised and refined version of the old Roman calendar allegedly established circa 753 BC [AUC 1/752] by Romu- lus was not made fully operational until 2 AD under emperor Augustus. Many subsequent re- visions to the Julian calendar evolved into its familiar, modern-day version, the International Gregorian Calendar. The Roman calendar with all its refinements has always been a ìtropical- year to solar-day calendarî only, ignoring lunar months altogether. Sosigenes had estimated the length of the solar year to be 365 days and 6 hours. Those extra 6 hours per year were to be collectively added as one extra 24-hour day every 4th year, making a 366-day leap year [cog- nate to Old Norse hlaupa, ìto leapî]. Sosigenesí calendar was started on a leap year retroactive to 45 BC, but those early leap years were inserted more often than they shouldíve been, once every three years through 9 BC. This was corrected by ignoring leap yearís in 5 BC, 1 BC and 4 AD [ref. Macrobius, Saturnalia I,14,14]. So from 5 AD onward, the Julian calendar proceeded according to specificationó until it was discovered that the true solar year is about 11 minutes 14 seconds shorter than"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Introduction vii Sosigenes had estimated, with a tropical year today calculated at ~365.242199 days in length. This modest error compounded over time, adding about 7 extra days per millennium, but the vernal equinox proved useful as the benchmark for crudely recalibrating and adjusting the calendar every several hundred years or so, thus assuring its continued relative accuracy over time. However, by 1545, the spring equinoxówhich the Roman Catholic Church used for de- termining Easter [Ishtar, Iístar, Isis, Astarte, Aphrodite, Venus]óhad moved entirely ten days ahead of its proper date, rather, the date had ìskippedî ten days beyond the actual equinox. So in December of that year, the Council of Trent authorized Pope Paul III to take action, but it wasnít until the election of Pope Gregory XIII (Ugo Buoncompagni, 1502-1585) in 1572 that a formal proposal was solicited from famed Jesuit astronomer Christopher Clavius (1537-1612), which heíd compiled based on suggestions of astronomer and physician Luigi Lilio (?- 1576), and most especially, Clavius based his findings on the meticulous research of the 7th century Anglo-Saxon monk, scholar, historian and theologian, the venerable St. Bede (673- 735 AD). This proposal/papal bull officially appeared in February 1582, but the Britís didnít adopt the Gregorian version until March 25, 1752. This calendar is today known as the International Standard Gregorian Calendar, and is becoming the de facto calendar throughout the world. But thereís one more calendar youíd do well to familiarize yourself with before proceeding with this book, and that is the Julian (Fr. ìJulienî) dating system commonly used by astrono- mers. Julian dates mustnít be confused with the old Julian calendar of Sosigenes, but was named for the classical scholar Julius CÊsar Scaliger (1484-1558) by his son Joseph Justis Sca- liger(1540-1609), a prolific writer whose works were published posthumously in 1610. Among Josephís crowning achievements was a scientific study of previous calendars enti- tled ëOpus de emendatione temporeí dated 1583, notably one year after the Gregorian calen- dar was introduced. Briefly, the first Julian Day of the Julian Period ó or Scaliger Cycle of 7980 years ó was assigned by Scaliger as day ZERO (0), starting precisely at 12:00:00 AM GMT January 1, 4713 BC by the proleptic [i.e. subsequently leap-year corrected] Julian calen- dar. All astronomical calculations presented herein include reference to Scaligerís Julian dating system, but the calendar is 12 hours later plus one calendar year later than this for all ìBCî calendar dates, since astronomers include the year ìzeroî which is 1 BC; e.g. - -4712-01-01 is equivalent to 12 PM UT January 1, 4713 BC. Thereby Julian dating system numbers are computed by adding the number of days from - 4712-01-01 plus any mathematical fraction of that day counting from noon, plus or minus. This is because Scaliger had originally designated 12 AM GMT as xx.00, but it is convention for all astronomical calculations to recognize xx.00 as 12 PM (noon) UT as beginning any Julian day, with xx.25 as 6 PM UT, xx.50 as 12 AM UT, etc, since astronomers most often work at night, and the old midnight-to-midnight reckoning was confusing to astronomers"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Historical Calendar Of Jesus viii who did calculations by hand. It is worthy of mention also that the chronological dating sys- tem used by historians is rendered as simple integers; e.g., anytime between 12:00 AM UT Thursday September 19, 457 BC through 11:59 PM UT corresponds to Julian Day 1554766, but in astronomerís terminology, that same Julian date, as reckoned in Jerusalem (since thatís where weíll stay focused throughout this entire book), would be Julian Day [hereinafter abbre- viated to ëJDí] 1554766.00000 only at 2:00:00 PM Jerusalem Standard Time, since Jerusalem time is always UT +2:00. In other words, 12:00 PM (noon) in Jerusalem is only 10:00 AM in Greenwich, England, so 12:00 PM in Jerusalem on September 19, 457 BC corresponds to JD 1554765.91667, since 22/24ís of 1 = 0.9166666666667, truncated to five decimal places for within one second per day accuracy, yields 0.91667, which fraction is then added to the pre- vious Julian Day.

Clearly, unlike the Persians whoíd counted the 7th year of their king from 1 Nisanu that previous year [458 BC], Ezra was not counting this gen- tile kingís seventh year from 1 Abib[Nisan] 3303[458 BC], but was counting from the Hebrew civil calendar new year of 1 Tishri 3304 [in the fall of 458 BC]. Ezraís ìfirst monthî Abib was also the 7th civil calendar month Nisan of 3304, with the fifth month of Ab placed as the 11th civil calendar month of Av-also in 3304, thusly both months were properly reckoned by Ezra as squarely within Artaxerxesí seventh civil calendar year of 3304. Ezraís ìfirstî and ìfifthî month references were to the ìspring- to-spring,î 1 Abib to 1 Abib[hodesh ha-aviv] religious calendar of the Torah, but not to the ìfall-to-fall,î 1 Tishri to 1 Tishri agricultural-liturgical shana observance of the Hebrew civil calendar. This dual-aspect, or bisection of Hebrew timekeeping methods is covered more thoroughly later. Just remember, that morning follows evening, and so the days with longer nights than days is in front of the days with longer nights, and thatís exactly why the vernal equinox has always followed the au- tumnal equinox by calendar years. Artaxerxes became king by Persian eponym upon his father Xerxesí(Ahasuerus) death in mid-August of 465 BC, but the Persians regarded this time as Artaxerxesí ìaccession yearî, ob- serving the custom in which the new king was to ìcompleteî the last regnal year of his prede- cessor before being declared sovereign on the next Persian calendar new year of 1 Nisanu. Note the similarity between the names of the Babylonian civil calendar and the Hebrew civil calendar months given on the following page. It is clamed that during the 70-years captivity in Babylon [606-537 BC], the Hebrews adapted the Babylonian calendar month names for use in the Hebrew ìfall-to-fallî civil calendar. My subsequent research has shown that distinguishing between fall-to-fall and spring-to-spring calendar reckoning is vastly more ancient than ortho- dox secular-religious science have previously asserted, and so the dual naming convention is probably just as ancient, antediluvian, and prehistoric, and these month names share common Egypto-Babylonian roots.

For example, Artaxerxesí 1st Persian regnal year began 2 days past the calculated molad for that Persian calendar month of Nisanu 464 BC [the molad was Tue, April 11, 464 BC @ 06:52:20 PM JST; JD 1552048.20301].

But Passover[14 Abib] could only fall on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Saturday, so to have allowed 1 Abib to fall 14 days prior on a Wednesday wouldíve forced the Passover to fall on a Tuesdayóa scenario strictly forbidden by calendar rules! Hence, this 1 Abib was properly delayed until Thursday, which was the very same date the Persians selected. This is why the ancient calendar were always calculated years in advance, so that calendars could be mapped-out ahead of time, based on the calendar rules devised to accommodate the holidays for each and every calendar year. Weíll cover much more on the ancient calendar rules later, but weíll begin with leap-year intercalation. The regular 19-year interval in which the molad is coincident with the near-equal length of day and night, which is one to two days before the vernal equinox in the northern hemisphere due to atmospheric aberration, this be- gins each 19- year cycle of the lunisolar calendar, and is fixed regardless of whatever leap-year sequence is selected. The X-Graph on the following page illustrates how this sequence would theoretically be shifted with respect to the 19-year cycle were the calendar to remain in effect until ~25465 AD, were it not for the quasi- periodic shifting of the polar axis and dynamic changes in equinoctial precession.

Thereís a simple rule for calculating whether any given Hebrew calendar year was a leap year from c. 1591 BC to the present: Any year after 3921 [160-161 AD] is counted as a leap year when its value divided by 19 leaves a remainder of 0, 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, or 17; but any year before 3921 is a leap year only if its value divided by 19 leaves a remainder of 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16 or 18. For example, the year 5760 (1999-2000 AD) is a leap year because 5760 divided by 19 leaves a remainder of 3, which also makes this the 3rd year of that 19-year lunisolar cycle, counted as the 304th so-called ìmetonicî cycle of the proleptic Hebrew calendar, although the astronomer Meton was no- where near the first to discover the lunisolar cycle, as evi- dence has shown that this calculation dates at least back to the days of Adam ~200,000 BC. To determine if the Hebrew civil calendar year 3791 [30-31 AD] was a leap year, 3791 is before 3921, so 3791 divided by 19 leaves a remainder of 10, and so was a leap year, and was the 10th year of that lunisolar cycle, ì#200î in the proleptic Hebrew calendar, called ìprolepticî since the Hebrew year ì1î was reckoned as Tishri 1, 0001, or Monday, September 7, 3761 BC, with its molad 9:50 AM JST[JD 347967.826] by the Gre- gorian calendar. Simply adding this arbitrary ìyear 1 constantî of 3761 to any Gregorian cal- endar year (up to circa 25,000 AD) gives us the proleptic Hebrew calendar equivalent; e.g., adding 3761 to 1999 AD gives us the Hebrew civil calendar year 5760. Rosh ha-Shannah or New Yearís Day in the Hebrew civil calendar was Saturday, September 11, 1999 [molad on Thursday, September 9, 1999 AD @11:44:58 PM JST {JD 2451431.40623}]. Again, donít forget that the day began at sunset on the previous day in ancient Hebrew cal- endar, typically counted as 6 PM local timezone for the modern Jewish calendar. The tradi- tional Jewish ìfirst year of creationî 3761 BC is an entirely arbitrary date, since the Earth is certainly many millions - probably billions - of solar years young, although radiocarbon dating and other quasi-scientific methods are not exactly foolproof, either. It is of critical importance to understand that when the Bible states that ìso&soî was begat by[ben] ìsuch&suchî, more often than not this meant that ìso&soî was the grandson, or was the great grandson, or was the great- great-to-the-nth grandson of ìsuch&suchî! While in a trance state, the world-renowned ìseerî Edgar Cayce stated that Noahís Flood occurred around 28,000 BC. Thatís practically yesterday in the long-forgotten annals of antediluvian prehistory, thus is a perfectly logical, reasonable and recent dating for Noah and the greatest flood in since men walked the Earth. While God promised not to flood the entire planet again, widespread, catastrophic flooding still occurs, and a global-wide cataclysm ói.e. the Tribula- tionó is presently occurring [cf. Mat 24:14-22,32-39; UPDATE: since 9/11/2001, WWIII has officially been underway]. But letís get back to Ezraís ì7th yearî for king Artaxerxes.

This is why the leap-year intercalation sequence was forced to be postponed during the patriarchate of the grandson of Simeon ben Gamaliel I, Simon III (a.k.a. Simeon ben Gamaliel II r. 135- 175 AD) in 161 AD [see chapter 5]. Note that the grandson of rabban Gamaliel ìthe Elderî was Gama- liel II(Sanhedrin president c. 80-115 AD); this title was also ascribed to Gamaliel I, Simeon b. G.I., G.II., (Simeon b. G.II.), GIII [Aboth 2.2], and finally to Johanan ben Zaccai, although he was not a descendent of Gamaliel, but was a student of Hillel nonetheless. But these six lead- ers of the school of Hillel were not successive, since rabban Johanan ben Zaccai overlapped G.I. and Simeon b. G.I., who together cosigned an encyclical on tithes, for example, as de- scribed in Midrash Tannaim. While Talmudic references such as those cited herein are helpful and supportive, they are not canonical. But the oldest parts of the Talmud are most reliable. ContinuingÖ since the reign of the gentile kings was always reckoned from the first ì1 Tishriî in the Hebrew civil calendar which fell within the first regnal year of that gentile king, Ezra properly counted Artaxerxesí seventh regnal year as from 1 Tishri 3304 through 29 Elul 3304 by the Hebrew civil calendar, which corresponds to October 2, 458 BC through Sep- tember 20, 457 BC. In diametric opposition, the reign of Hebrew kings was counted from 1 Abib, not from 1 Tishri, as even the semi- authoritative Talmud agrees [Mas Avodah Zarah 10], but the Hebrew Canon is the final written authority before our Lord Jesus and our Heavenly Father, thus any Talmudic references are properly deemed helpful at best. But neither should we throw the baby out with the bathwater, as thereís much history, wisdom and insight to be gleaned from the Talmud. The Talmud is a diverse compendium of verbose commentary made by various teachers [Heb. rabbis] rooted in written traditions and encyclicals, infused with smatterings of frequently bizarre oral traditions covering a very wide variety of topics, none of which commentary should ever be confused with the sound doctrine of the Hebrew Canon. Caution is indeed the watchword when scrutinizing the validity and historicity of any non- canonical sources. With that saidÖ Note where Nehemiah makes reference to ìthe month Nisan, in the twentieth year [445- 444 BC] of Artaxerxes the kingî [Neh 13:6], where the month is named instead of numbered. This was the seventh month of the kingís 20th year according to the Hebrew civil calendar, thus Nehemiahís reference to Nisan is in 444 ó not 445 ó BC. Nehemiah was an important government official and cupbearer to Artaxerxes, who came to Jerusalem in the capacity of civil governor to Judea. The historian Josephus noted that ìNehemiahÖlived to great age, and governed Judah the rest of his lifeî[beyond his 12-year appointment]. Nehemiah records that ìEzra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh monthî[Neh 8:2]. Here, Ne- hemiah makes reference to the seventh month, which he conspicuously numbers instead of"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Historical Calendar Of Jesus 9 naming it, clearly in reference to the seventh lunisolar Torah calendar month of Ethanim [Tishri]. Just as the Hebrew day is counted by ìevening and morningî, divided by the Earthís rota- tion and orbit with respect to the Sun, the Hebrew year is similarly divided by the spring and fall equinoxes, with a ì1:1î correspondence of Holy Days: 1 Abib [New Moon]/ 1 Tishri [Rosh Hashanah]; 10 Abib [lamb selected]/ 10 Tishri [Atonement]; Feast of Unleavened Bread [15- 21 Abib]/ Tabernacles [15-21 Tishri], and so on. Also, Passover [14 Abib] is the first day of that eight-day feast, with the Last Great Day [22 Tishri] marking the eighth day; it is not diffi- cult to see the ìequinoctial balanceî here. Further proof of this Hebrew ìfall-to-fallî reckoning for the gentile kings is demonstrated by the Elephantine KR6 papyrus. Elephantine was founded as a military colony in the 6th cen- tury BC in southern Egypt, on an island in the Nile near Aswan. Aramaic-speaking Jews con- structed a temple there in 525 BC. About a century ago, numerous papyri were unearthed, many of which are dated(some double-dated) from 471 to 402 BC, dates which are useful for comparing these ancient Egyptian, Persian and Hebrew civil calendars, and also for establish- ing certain facts about them, including how that the Hebrew calendar observed the ìfall-to- fallî civil-regnal years for gentile kings, and not the ìspring-to-springî civil-regnal calendar of the Persians. Notably, the Elephantine Jews also used Babylonian month names as did Ezra, Nehemiah, et al, but in their Aramaic form. Similar to Hebrew and Arabic, Semitic Aramaic derived its ancient alphabet from the North Semitic(Phoenician) script of pre- 10th-9th centu- ries BC which is proto-Semitic in origin. By the Neo-Babylonian period of the prophet Danielís writings, Aramaic was already in use throughout Mesopotamia, and was the lingua franca of the Near East. In 539 BC, the Imperial (i.e. improved) Aramaic was adopted as the official lan- guage of the Persian Empire, which by then was in common use from Egypt to India. Con- tinuing, the Elephantine Kraeling 6 papyrus had but one year listed, the 3rd year of Darius II(Nothius). The Hebrew civil date was rendered as Tammuz 8, but the Egyptian was Pharmu- thi 8. Because these dates fell on July 11th or 12th of that year, the year was 420 BC, in the Egyptian year 4. The Aramaic AP25/AP28 papyri agree, as does the Canon of Ptolemy, thus it was also the Persian year 4. But, since the Hebrew civil calendar month of Tammuz is several months after Nisan (which youíll recall is the seventh month in the Hebrew civil calendar), then only the fall-to-fall shana reckoning reconciles the civil calendar date with the year 420 BC as the 3rd ó not 4th ó year of Darius II, since Darius IIís first regnal year was counted from 1 Nisanu of 423 BC. Every historical evidence examined shows that Ezra counted Artaxerxesí first gentile-regnal year from 1 Tishri 3298, which date fell on Saturday, October 7, 464 BC [molad Fri, Oct 6, 464 BC @ 04:44:39 AM JST; JD 1552225.61434]."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Hand Of God 10 As an added reference, the following chart lists rulers from Danielís time to the end of the Persian empire, emphasizing each rulerís time of greatest or empirical rule, citing historically- identified aliases and ignoring eponymic ìaccession periodsî where applicable for clarity and brevity.

Note that Johnís father, the priest Zecha- riah, served in the eighth [8-day] course of Abijah, which started on the weekly sabbath of 7 Sivan 3757; this date was June 2, 4 BC. The archangel Gabriel appeared to Zechariah after 9 AM that same morning [Luke 1:5-25]. Pentecost was ìfully comeî on 9 Sivan [Acts 2:1] but various sects of the priesthood observed this earlier. Jesus was conceived on the first day of the 6th month of Elisabethís pregnancy with John [Luke 1:36]. Normal gestation to full term is 266 to 270 days, so if Jesus and John were both carried an average term of 267 days, then John was conceived on 28 Sivan 3757, which was Saturday, June 23, 4 BC, placing Jesusí con- ception in Mary by the Great Spirit exactly five Hebrew calendar months plus one day [148 days] later, on 28 Cheshvan 3758, which date was Sunday, November 18, 4 BCÖ and Yes, in case youíre wondering, procreation was permitted on the weekly Sabbath according to the Law of Moses [ref. Gen 1:27-28 ibid]. Also note that the traditional date of the Annunciation [Luke 1:26-38] seems to be a little off. Not surprising, as weíll see happen again in the next chapter.

At the time of incense [ref. Ex 30:1-8, Luke 1:10], a splendidly aromatic incense made from a mixture of sweet spices [i.e. equal parts of finely ground stacte, onycha, galbanum and frank- incense; ref. Ex 30:34-38] was offered at the third hour [9 AM], and again at the ninth hour [3 PM; cf. Acts 3:1]. It is abundantly clear from the gospel According to Luke that Zechariahís angelic visitation by Gabriel occurred in the morning hours on the first day of the course of Abijah, which in that year began at sundown June 1, 4 BC, and in every year lasted fully eight days until the afternoon of the following weekly Sabbath, thereby always overlapping the next course assuring perpetual temple service. But in this year, Zechariahís service was delayed one week by his mandatory participation in the Feast of Weeks [Shavuot], placing his last or 8th day on 21 Sivan, or June 16. Note that the law which retired Levites from service at the age of fifty years [ref. Num 8:25,26 ibid] did not apply to priests, rather many had served to extreme old age, as did Zechariah. Not one of the prophets of old, not Moses, or Isaiah, nor any other prophet mentioned in the Old Testament is so frequently referenced in the New Testament as is Elijah, remembering also that it was Elisha who ìtook the mantle of Elijahî. John denied being Elijah the prophet [John 1:21], yet Johnís beloved first cousin Jesus [Heb \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0002\u0004\u0005 , YaoHuíSHua {pronounced yaoh-ooíshua} from \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0002\u0004\u0005 , Jehoshua or Joshua; Gk. \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006 , ee-ay-sooceí, meaning ìGod [Heb. \u0004\u0002\u0004\u0005 , YaoHuWaH, yaoh-ooí vawí, Lat. Jehovah is Salvationî] confirmed that indeed he was and is Elijah [Mat 17:10-13]. But neither did John himself at first recognize the prophesied Messiah the Prince until the moment of Jesusí bap- tism by John and by His Father at the river Jordan. Whether the spirit-entity whoíd been"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Historical Calendar Of Jesus 17 *generated* as the prophet named Elijah was aware that heíd been generated [incarnated] as John the Baptist is not really an issue, since Lord Jesus confirmed that John was and is in fact the Elijah of prophecy foretold by the ancients as recorded in the Hebrew TaNaKh. (ëTaNaKhí is an acronym naming the twenty-four ancient scrolls comprising the old testament portion of the Hebrew Canon, divided into three major portions: these are known as Torah [Law], Neviíim [Prophets] & Ketuvim [Writings]. Subsequent translations and subdivisions of se- lected works within TaNaKh have yielded the thirty-nine divinely-inspired books of the Old Testament, preserved even for our generation, and best translated, in my opinion, by Jerome, to wit the Latin Vulgate). As anyone can see, the profound similarities between John and one of his karmic- predecessors, Elijah, coupled with Jesus and a karmic-predecessor of His, Elisha, are immedi- ately apparent; e.g, the prophet Malachi, writing approximately four centuries after the days of Elijah and Elisha, wrote: ìBehold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORDîó Mal 4:5 AV Thusly Jesus answered His disciples after John the Baptist had been beheaded that ìElijah indeed is coming and will restore all thingsî[ref. Mat 17:10-13], clearly referring to His Pre- sent 2nd Advent, not the 1st whereby He was speaking: ìI am saying but to YOU that Elijah already came, and not they recognized himîÖîthen perceived the disciples that about John the Baptist he said to themî(see also Mat 11:13,14;16:14; Mark 9:11;15:35; Luke 9:7,8; John 1:21). Now look at Luke 4:25: ìÖ many widows were in the days of Elijah in the Israel, when was shut up the heaven years three and months six, as occurred famine great upon all the earth..î Notably, Elijah [Heb. \u0004\u0005\u0006 \u0007 , Eliíyah {ay-lee-yawí/ var. ay-lee- yawíhoo}, Lat. Elias, meaning ìYaoHuWaH is my Godî] is named 30 times in the New Testament, but he is first introduced in the Old Testament at 1 Kings 17:1, then continuing through 2 Kings 2:1-12, when his min- istry was finished and the time drew near for Elijah to ascend into heaven. Elijahís successor was Elisha [Heb. \u0001\u0003\u0005\u0006 \u0007 , Eliyshaí {el-ee-shawí, Gk. \u0007\b\t\u0003\u0003\t\u0004\u0006 , el- ee-sahíyos ìGod is salva- tionî] who heíd anointed years before. Elijah had worked many miracles, and caused Israel to suffer a drought for exactly 3 Ω Hebrew calendar years; likewise, Jesusí ministry ìconfirming the covenant with manyî[Dan"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Course Of Abijah 18 9:24- 27] working many miracles, had lasted 3 Ω Hebrew calendar years before Messiah was ìcut offî- the first half of His 7- year Ministry completed. Elisha had become a miracle worker much like his mentor Elijah, and after Jesus ascended to the right hand of God [Mark 16:19], His apostles worked miracles also. And look at 1 Ki 19:19, strikingly reminiscent of the first twelve disciples of Christ, and the twelve ensigns of the planetary zodiac: ìSo he [Elijah] departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.î Notably, the bright star Arcturus marks the beginning of the first caelestial constellation of evening, caelestial Libra. Many Christians donít know that Elijah had also raised the dead [1Ki 17:2-24], or that his successor Elisha raised the dead, such as the Shunammiteís son [ref. 2 Kings 4:1ff], and even in death, Elisha raised a dead Israelite by his corpseís mere touch [2 Kings 13:20,21]! And we already know that Jesus raised Lazarus up from the dead and was Himself raised up after fully 3 days & 3 nights in the tomb. There are so many obvious simi- larities worth noting here that itís no wonder those questioning John were perplexed at Johnís repeated denials of being Elijah [ref. John 1:20-28]. Now compare these verses between Elijah and John the Baptist: ìO LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fa- thersî[I Kings 19:4] / ìthere hath not risen a greater than John the BaptistÖ he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.î[Mat 11:11]. ìhe was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins[II Kings 1:8] / ìraiment of camelís hair, and a leathern girdle about his loinsî[Mat 3:4]. Similarities between John and Samson are also worth noting: ìFor he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink.îó ref. Luke 1:15 ìAnd the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.

The Lordís Prayer was being taught by John be- fore Lord Jesus was even baptised: ìAnd it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples. And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth. Give us day by day our daily bread. And forgive us our sins; [as]for we also forgive every one that is in- debted to us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evilÖ îó ref. Luke 11:1-4 AV Consider a passage in light of Ps 22:1, Mat 27:46 & Mar 15:34: ìÖ Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father[Heb. ba, Ab; Arabic ìAbaî] Ö and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces Ö when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over Ö And when the sons of the prophets[children of the Law of One] which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.îó ref. 2 Ki 2:12-15ff AV The next verse of Mark 15:35 reads: ìAnd some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold he calleth Elias [Eliíyah, ay-lee-yawí]î. The Hebrew name yle, Eli, ay-lee; [ref. 1 Sam and 1 Ki 2:27] derives from the primitive root hle, Alah, aw-lawí[Arabic name for God, Aramaic ìEloiî{ref. Mark 15:34}], which means ìto ascend to Godî or ìto be exalted before Godî, or any such similar phraseologies.

A complete reading of these verses in context reveals that John and Elijah are indeed of One Spirit, One Voice, just as Jesus and Elisha are of One Spirit: born corporeal[mortal], but with immortal Souls. Whereas, unlike John, Jesus the Christ is the first soul to overcome death [wages of sin] of His free will, perfected in His Body Temple in the Spirit of Truthó incorruptible by Godís Spirit, wholly devoid of sin [karma] and thereby now and forever inert to the isotropy of the available energy time-space continuum. Every Christian Buddhist knows that YHSH is Maitrya: the Buddha of Compassion. In Sanskrit, YHSH is called Avataíra: the Avatar, and it is YHSH who confirmed for us that John / Elijah are indeed of One Voice: ìBut what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.îó Luke 7:26-27 AV "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" Chapter 3 Morning Star J ESUS WAS BORN BEFORE sunrise 1 Elul 3758, which was Monday, August 12, 3 BC.

Coordinates are 35E13 31N42. The actual time of birth is around 3:50 AM LMT, although Mercury transits the cusp around 3:41 to reign in the third house, & Saturn transits the cusp about 3:49. So the ques- tion arises if whether Saturn is debilitate first house, else is innate twelfth house? Notably, Ve- nus, which is Jesusí souljourning planet, his ìbright and morning starî Venus crests the local ascendant just as Mercury transits the cusp, and Jupiter reaches the ascendant within a minute of Venus. The first time I calculated Jesusí natal chart several years ago, 3:50 AM seemed most pru- dent, on account of Saturnís transit on the cusp. As Iíve looked again at the horoscope, how- ever, I must acquiesce under Marsí reign in the eighth house, and the Moon fourth house, with Mercury third house. This finds Jupiter fallen thereon the Gemini ascendant with Venus so- journ innate. Before, Iíd discounted this scenario believing Jupiter couldnít possibly have fallen in Jesusí horoscopeÖcould it?

Thatís clear, but again, I wonder if Saturn hasnít transited the cusp to the twelfth house? Of this I canít be certain. 3:50 AM LMT (1:30 UT) has survived meticulous scrutiny. The Sun is ~ 2Can54í39.6î. The Local Angle Time is approximately ~3:54 AM. I also calculated Jesusí natal chart for only 8 minutes earlier, not that it changes this horo- scope much at all, but I include it as a celestial reference for this date, emphasizing Mercuryís transit, with Venus in Ascendancy. When Jesus was born, Venus was in inferior aspect right on the Ascendant above the predawn Sun at approximately 3:42 LMT (+2:20) with Jupiter practi- cally kissing Venus, both Venus and Jupiter third house aloft ruling Mercury which just tran- sited the cusp seconds before the Advent: Mon 12-Aug--2 35E13 31N42 Aldebaran: 15Tau00 -5:36í /Venus : 28Can24 +0:42í /Ascendant: 28Can33 ______ \\Jupiter : 28Can35 +0:38í \\Psi Leo : 28Can43 +0:12í Subra : 29Can34 -3:52í Fortune : 11Leo54 ______ /Mercury : 14Leo01 -3:16í \\2nd Cusp : 14Leo08 +0:00í Sun : 19Leo10 +0:00í Moon : 2Vir30 -1:19í"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Morning Star 24 Thus Jupiter was in superior aspect but is fallen under the weight Mercury, with Moon fourth house, Mars eighth house, Uranus eleventh house, Saturn first of horoscope. Looking at Jupiter & Venus from a topocentric viewpoint at the time must have been breathtaking, since parallax shows the King and Queen of heaven are nearly conjoined. This astronomical union is called the Star of Bethlehem, and he who was born of Jupiter & Venus is called Prince for ex- actly this reason: the union of Venus and Jupiter. Quoting Isaiah: ìÖthe Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy risingÖthe dromedaries [young camels] of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the LORDî [ref. Isa 60:3,6]. Isaiah is rightly known as the Messianic Prophet, since he knew that out of Israel would come the one true Messiah for all the worldís salvation [cf. Isa 40:3/ John 1:23; John 12:41-43ff]. The fact that Isaiah 60:3,6 seems to include the Magiís responding to this bright rising ìstarî is best discerned by the true believer, since the prophet Isaiah clearly prophesied about Jesus throughout his writings. Thus Jesus Christ was born in the City of David: ìOf the but Jesus having been generated in Bethlehem of the Judea in days of Herod the king, look! Magi from eastern parts came to be alongside into Jerusalem saying Where is the(one) born king of the Jews? We saw for of him the star in the east and we came to do obeisance to him. Having heard but the King Herod was agitated and all Jerusalem with him, and having led together all the chief priests and scribes of the people he was in- quiring beside them where the Christ is generated.î ó Mat 2:1-4 WH-ITGS The magoi observed this first of two consecutive conjunctions of Jupiter & Venus in Leo [309 days apart] in the east [at its rising] over Leoís ìleft pawî in the modern constellation, in the early morning hours of August 12, 3 BC, breaking the desert horizon at about 3:16 AM JST, fully one hour and forty-two minutes ahead of the Sun, with the ìkingî star Regulus thirty- seven minutes behind it, rising at 3:53 AM JST. The Magoi in Babylon witnessed these majestic caelestial events about 40 to 45 minutes sooner than did those in the region of west- ern Palestine, thus their own witness from Babylon ó with the ìkingî star in view ó was a half hour or so prior to the actual time of Messiahís birth, near 3:30 AM UT in ancient Jerusa- lem. Note Matthewís reference to ìall Jerusalem with himî [Mat 2:3]. Clearly the magi werenít the only ones whoíd noticed Messiahís birth signs, but the Messi- anic portent thereof was apparently troublesome for MANY, including king Herod. Everybody"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Historical Calendar Of Jesus 25 saw it! To astrologers [lit. star-logicians] everywhere, Jupiter [Gk. \u000b \u0007\u0005\u0006 ] was recognized as the Tarot Emperor associated with the birth of kings; Venus [Gk. Aphrodite] was identified with the Tarot Empress, sphere of balance & beauty. Leo & his courageous heart in the ìkingî star Regulus, had long-since been associated with Judah, and with royalty everywhere, some dat- ing back to circa 10,500 BC and before [e.g. Sphinx]. Note that Jesus is referred to as The Lion of the Tribe of Judah [Rev. 5:5 ibid] and ìBright and Morning Starî which is explicitly Venus. Who were the Magoi? The magi first appear in recent history around the 7th century BC, in the Median empire [ref. Herodotus I;ci], and by the late 1st century BC they formed the upper house of the council of the Megistanes, whose duties included the election of the king of the Parthian empire [ref. Strabo,XI,ix,3]. These Magi[Gk. \f\r\u0004\t ] were adept judicial astrologers [Gk. \u0003\u000e\u000f\u0004\b\u0004\r\t\u0010 \t\u0004\u0005\u0011\t\u0003\t\u000f\t\u0006 ] from the Parthian empire, whose lands included those of Persia, Bactria, and other areas east of the Euphrates. Many an ancient magi boasted of Abra(ha)mic descent [ref. Mclintock & Strongís Cyclopaedia], thus their recognition of Messiahís ìroyal starî is not at all surprising, but rather, HE WAS EXPECTED!! The historianís Josephus, Tacitus and Suetonius all noted the wide- spread expectation that the time for Messiah was at hand. These discerning Magi had for centuries understood Danielís ì70 Weeksî prophecy, thus theyíd acted accord- ingly upon their own witness from Babylon to this expected ìroyal starî signifying His birth. Remember also that Gabriel had revealed the 70 Weeks prophecy to Daniel in Babylon, and the day that Ezra left Babylon started the prophetic clock ticking down Gabrielís 7 + 62 con- tiguous sabbatic years to John Baptizing and 7 Hebrew calendar months afterwards, from Ezraís first Rosh ha-Shannah & Jubilee in Jerusalem to the baptism of Messiah the Prince; see the pattern? The empire-wide registration [Luke 2:1] which was occurring at the time of Jesusí birth is directly linked to the activities and eventual death of king Herod I called ìthe Greatî. These documented events are very thoroughly examined in Chapter 4. Thereís a passage in Luke which refers to the shepherds guarding their flocks by night. Theyíd work in shifts, keeping their watches around the clock, night and day, thus it is specific that this was the nightwatch on duty when the angel appeared: ìAnd shepherds were in the country the very living in the fields and guarding watches of the night upon the flock of them. And angel of Lord stood upon them and glory of Lord gleamed around them, and they feared fear great; and said to them the angel Not YOU be fearing, look! for I am declaring good news to"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Morning Star 26 YOU joy great which will be to all the people, because was born to YOU today Savior who is Christ Lord in the city of David; and this to YOU sign, YOU will find infant having been swaddled and lying in manger.îó Luke 2:8-12 WH-ITGS The fields in the region of Bethlehem have for more than four millennia been the domain of humble shepherds. It is customary to withdraw the flocks from the open districts and house them over the winter months, sending them out again around Passover, at which time the shepherds guarded their flocks constantly to protect them from theft and predators, and also to keep them from straying. The first rain usually comes by Cheshvan [Oct- Nov], and is the signal for the flocks to be herded to shelter. Snow is not at all unusual during the winter months in these regions, with cold winter nights and no suitable pasturage from November through February forcing the animals indoors.

Re- nowned astronomers like Sinnott and Federer[editor ëSky and Telescopeí magazine], using planetary tables of Tuckerman [1962], had resolutely concluded that this ìÖten-month inter- val from Aug 12, 3 BC to Jun 17, 2 BC as the magiís long [600 mile] journey to Jerusalem and Bethlehem, since the second conjunction was by far the brightestî [ref. S&T, Dec ë68]; and more recently, Mosley [1987], whoíd calculated the first conjunction closer at 4.3 arcminutes, with the second at 30 arcseconds, this, shortly before the VSOP87 then SWEPH/JPL theory of ~10 arcminutes and ~6 arcseconds respectively was demonstrated as an accurate calculation: the consensus being that this second conjunction was the ìstarî which led the Magi to Jesus, a conclusion made obvious and readily discerned by anyone whoís examined the astronomical data in light of the Scriptures, and also to anyone who understands astrology and planetary souljourns.

But the facts of the matter prove that Herod I died in 1 BC. Quoting from Luke: ìIt happened but in the days those went out decree beside CÊsar Au- gustus to be getting registered all the inhabited [earth]; this registra- tion [Gk. \u0012\u0004\r\u000f\u0013\u0007 ] first occurred being governor of the Syria Quirinius; and they were going their way all to be getting registered, each (one) into the of himself cityÖ îó Luke 2:1 WH-ITGS This census and oath of allegiance was required of the whole of the Roman empire and its provinces, which included the inhabited regions of southern and western Europe, western Asia and north Africa, i.e., literally, the inhabited [Roman] earth. On February 5, 2 BC, Augus- tus was awarded the highest of all Roman titles: Pater Patriae, which meant ìFather of the Countryî. This award ceremony happened amidst celebrations commemorating the 25th year of Augustus CÊsarís rule and the 750th anniversary of the (legendary) founding of Rome in 753 BC[AUC 1/752] which celebrations extended into August of 2 BC in Augustusí honor. In the autograph account of his own life, ëRes Gestaeí Augustus wrote: ìWhile I was administer- ing my 13th consulship the senate and the equestrrian order and the entire Roman people gave me the title Father of My Country[the only Roman title above CÊsar Imperator and Pon- tifex Maximus]î. This empire-wide registration began in the late summer of 3 BC [compare Jesusí birth date(!)]. The koi-neí Greek word for tax is \u0012\u0004\u000e\t\f\u0007\u0003\t\u0006 , but \u0012\u0004\r\u000f\u0013\u0007 is properly translated as registration or enrollment, but not as ìtaxî, such as was mistranslated in the King James, Websterís, and other popular English Bibles.

This was the same registration referenced in Luke 2:1, which was an empire-wide Roman census. There was an actual Roman tax in 8 BC which was re- corded on the walls of the Monumentum Ancryanum at the Temple Augusteum in Ankara, Turkey. Notably, Roman taxes were levied only on citizens residing within the Empire proper and its provinces. These taxes were collected by the publicans at or near a citizenís place of residence. But king Herodís semi- autonomous kingdom was outside the Empire proper until 6 AD, when Judea and Samaria were annexed to the province of Syria overseen by Roman ap- pointment of imperial prefects, i.e. the procurators. Any taxes levied before that time were or- dered and collected by Herod under his own rules and auspices, but *not* those of the Roman Empire, since Herod had paid CÊsar through his own kingdom-wide taxation. Joseph and Mary abided in Nazareth thus were not Roman citizens and as a result were wholly ex- empt from (Roman)taxation. And even if they had been Roman citizens, they wouldnít have been required to travel to the place of their royal familyís lineage in order to pay the Roman taxes. Neither would Mary, who being ìgreat with childî [ref. Luke 2:5], have had to accom- pany Joseph wither he went to pay said taxes. Yet Mary had journeyed a distance of about sev- enty-two miles! south from Nazareth to Bethlehem in order to get registered with Joseph and her first son Jesus, with CÊsarís ìgrandestî of award ceremonies not six months away. The 5th century historian Orosius wrote: ì[Augustus] ordered that a census be taken of each province everywhere and that all men be enrolled. So at that time, Christ was born and was entered on the Roman census list as soon as he was born. This is the earliest and most fa- mous public acknowledgment which marked CÊsar as the first of all men and the Romans as lords of the worldÖthat first and greatest census was taken, since in this one name of CÊsar all the peoples of the great nations took oath, and at the same time, through the participation in the census, were made part of one society.î [ref. Orosius, Adv. Pag. VI22.7, VII2.16]. Ososius carefully noted the year that this census was completed, which was 2 BC [Adv. Pag. VI22.1, VI22.5, VII2.14]. And Flavius Josephus related ìtherefore the whole Jewish nation took an oath to be faithful to CÊsar and the interests of the king[Herod]Öî ìAccordingly, when all the people of the Jews gave assurance of their good-will to CÊsar, and to the kingís [i.e. Herodís] government, these very men [Pharisees] did not swear, being above six thou- sandî [Antiq. XVIIii4]. And so Josephus did acknowledge that king Herod I the Great was ALIVE when this empire-wide census of 3-2 BC was being conducted. Add to this, Josephus had correctly reckoned Augustusí defeat of Antony in 31 BC as Herodís seventh year, and Gal- lusí expedition in 24 BC heíd correctly determined was Herodís fourteenth year [Antiq. XVv2; XVix1-3]. Thus in every case but one, Josephus counted Herodís first year as 37 BC, and so was correct in counting king Herodís complete reign totalling 37 years upon his death. However, instead of counting Herodís 37th year from the death of the former king as he had had done in every other instance cited(!), Josephus referenced two separate years for"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Historical Calendar Of Jesus 39 counting Herodís reign. First is 37 BC, in which year Herod had seized Jerusalem and had the former king murdered, so commencing his reign; and secondly, counting *back* to 40 BC, when Herod was merely named ìkingî by Rome [Antiq. XIVxiv5; XIVxvi4]. In this instance, Josephus improperly counted Herodís 37th year from 40 BC instead of 37 BC, concluding in- correctly as a result of his miscalculation that Herod had reigned but ì34î years from 37 BC [Antiq. XIVxvi4; XVIIvi4,viii1,xiii2; XVIIIii1,iv6; Wars IIvii3]. And yet all other evidences cited ó and the bulk of Josephusí own meticulous research ó confirm that king Herod did in fact reign for 37 years, but counting from 37 BC which was Herodís first regnal year. Making 1 BC his 37th and final year of reign, in which Herod died after the ìblood redî full lunar eclipse of January 10th. So poor king Herodís final year wasnít much of a year at all, but was cut short by the end of January 1 BC. Note that Herodís sons Archelaus, Antipas and Philip reckoned their reigns from Antipaterís co-regency with Herod, beginning 4-3 BC, or after the death of the two royal sons[Antiq XVIIi1; XVIIii4, Wars Ixxiii5]. So you see, Herodís successors had ANTEDATED their reigns unbeknownst to Josephus, which solves the mystery of why he was unable to reconcile the correct length of Herodís reign with the year of his death, even though the bulk of his own detailed research about the late great Herod agree with the evidence that this is 1 BC. Luke informs us that the empire-wide registration of 3-2 BC occurred while Quirinius was the governor of Syria. Sentius Saturninus governed Syria from 9 BC to 7 BC, and Quinctilius Varus governed from 6 BC to 4 BC. Next, Publius Sulpicius Quirinus [Gk. Kureniov, var. Quir- inius, meaning ìwarriorî] governed Syria from 4 BC until 1 BC, and again, after the banish- ment of Archelaus, from 6 AD until 9 AD [ref. Lapis Venetus CIL3.6687]. Thus Quirinius was in fact governor [imperial legate/commissioner] of Syria twice, and at the times that Luke so stated [ref. Acts 5:37, & Jos. Antiq. XVIIIi, in regard to Lukeís ìsecondî census and taxation]. Archelaus, a son of Herod by Malthace, was made governor of Syria in 1 BC, but was de- posed by Augustus in 6 AD. Renowned historian W. M. Ramsay discovered an inscription at Antioch of Pisidia establishing Quirinius in Syria 10-7 BC, while leading a campaign against the Homanadenses (in the Taurus Mountains), a fact confirmed by Tacitus. Another inscrip- tion, the Lapis Tiburtinus which dates to 14 AD, was discovered in 1764 near Tivoli (Tibur), which refers to an officer described as ìvictorious in warî and ìtwice imperial legate of Syriaî [ref. CIL 14.3613]. Clearly, this reference was to Quirinus, but the officerís name on the papy- rus fragment was mutilated beyond recognition, thus is subject to the usual ìPorphyrianî cavil [ref. Porphyry, 234-305 AD]. A papyrus from Egypt said this concerning the empire-wide 3-2 BC enrollment referred by Luke as the ìfirstî registration: ìBecause of the approaching census it is necessary that all those residing for any cause away from their home should at once pre- pare to return to their own governments in order that they may complete the family registra- tion of the enrollmentî."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Evening Star 40 Also, dated 150 AD, Justin Martyr wrote: ìJesus was born at Bethlehem, thirty stadia dis- tant from Jerusalem; as you may learn from the enrolments that were held under Quirinus ( \u0014 \u0005\u000f\u0007\u0015\t\u0004\u0006 ) your first governor, in JudeaîÖîChrist was born one hundred and fifty years ago, under Quirinus ( \u0014 \u0005\u000f\u0007\u0015\t\u0004\u0006 )î [ref. Apol. i.34,46]. Martyrís testimony was addressed to the Roman Emperor himself, the Senate and the people of Rome. Here, Martyr placed Christís birth c. 1 BC, a year and a half late, but Martyr confirmed that Quirinus was governor in 1 BC, and confirmed Herod I the Great was ALIVE in the year 1 BC, a fact further confirmed by the astronomical evidences. Since Herod wasnít alive for very long in 1 BC, and since we know that Jesus was born in 3 BC, and also that Quirinusí first term as governor was from 4 BC to 1 BC, then Martyr mustíve known that 1 BC was Herodís last year, so he surmised that Herod had died sometime shortly, or within that year, after Joseph had fled to Egypt with Mary and Jesus, which is in near-agreement with the approximately 32 weeks after Jun 17, 2 BC to late January of 1 BC when Herod actually died. At least Martyr knew Quirinus was governor in 1 BC and Jesus was born during ìenrolmentsÖunder Quirinusî. A full lunar eclipse [Gk. \u0007\u0016\b\u0007\t\u0012\u0003\t\u0006 , abandonment] occurs when the Moon orbits through the center of Earthís shadow, or umbra, which shadow extends 900,000 miles outward away from the Sun. Sunlight, particularly the redder bandwidths, is refracted into the umbraís cone by the Earthís atmosphere, briefly illuminating a fully-eclipsed Moon with a reddish- brown, coppery glow which brightness and hues vary depending primarily on terrestrial meteorologi- cal conditions and other factors. A total, or full lunar eclipse lasts about an hour and three- quarters, and only occurs while the Earth is in the umbra i.e. the darkest portion of the Earthís shadow. Partial lunar eclipses do not produce this deep reddish tint since the penumbra passes the full spectrum of diffused sunlight onto the Moon. The traditional total lunar eclipse that Josephusí recorded as portending Herodís death, to wit, an eclipse that ìturned red with the blood of the murdered rabbisî[ref. Antiq. XVIIvi4; most translators ignore this passage claim- ing ìdubious authenticityî] is claimed to have occurred 13 March 4 BC. This was only a partial eclipse at 37% ó not even close to the total eclipse requisite for turning the Moon ìblood redî! And ì4 BCî does not reconcile with the evidence, irregardless.

The molad commencing the 19-year metonic cycle in which that Passover of 1 BC fell was Monday March 21, 17 BC @10:23:02 AM EET. The mean vernal equinox was the following day March 22, 17 BC @9:15:59 PM EET. So 1 Nisan 3744 of the liturgical ìfall-to-fallî calendar reckoning began at sunset March 21st. The year in which the Passover 1 BC occurred was year 17 of that cycle and so was not intercalary since that cal- endar year (in which the Passover following the blood-red eclipse occurred) was calculated as year 17 of that 19-year cycle. Recall from chapter 1 that any year after 3921 was/is calculated as a leap year if its value divided by 19 leaves a remainder of 0, 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, or 17; while any year before 3921 to circa 1471 was calculated as intercalary ONLY if its value divided by 19 leaves a remainder of 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16 or 18. And so the Passovers of 16 BC(2), 13 BC(5), 11 BC(7), 8 BC(10), 5(13) BC 2 BC(16) & 1 AD(18) of that 19-year cycle were calcu- lated in intercalary years thus delayed one month as a function of intercalation to keep feast/ holy days in season. See chapters 1 & 5 ìÖbecause of the precessing equinox Abib was/is never in any case calculated to begin more than 16 days before the spring equinox of any year be it a leap-year or not; neither was Pentecost allowed to ingress summer, which is why our calendar has always been calculated years in advanceî as weíve already learned. The Molad for Nisan 3760 was March 24, 1 BC @3:46:58 PM [JD 1721141.07428], placing 1 Nisan the next day (or Wednesday evening to be more precise). Note also that the Vernal Equinox was Mon- day, March 22, 1 BC 6:15:26 PM EET, thus the Passover of 14 Nisan 3760 fell on Wednesday April 7 of 1 BCówhich naturally commenced at sundown that preceeding day, i.e. Tuesday evening April 6th proleptic Julian calendar. In terribly-ill health, Herod was away at his winter palace in Jericho when the rabbis were executed on the day preceding the lunar eclipse. It is also established that Herod died five days after Antipater was slain [Antiq. XVIIviii1], which was within two to three weeks after the total lunar eclipse. So, starting at February 1st (which is the latest date that reconciles with Josephusí own testimony), then counting up to April 6th, i.e. the evening of the Passover, that left 29 days for February (recall that this Julian leap year was ignored to compensate for previ- ous leap-year errors but is counted in the proleptic Julian calendar), plus the 31 days of March, plus 6 days for April, which totals 29 + 31 + 6 = 66 days, or 9 Ω weeks i.e. sufficient time for Herodís 23-mile funeral procession, the 30-day ìmourningî period, the funeral feast and 7(30?)-day mourning period in honor of the patriots before Passover.

Twelve lunar[synodic] months is about eleven days shorter than a solar year, hence the ìlunar-solarî calendar has for thousands of years required a leap year to"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Voice Of One 52 be added every two to three years in order to make up for this annual eleven-day deficit. But these systematically observed leap years end up with about two hours [2:06:28.022] left over every 19 solar years, not a very significant error, but by the mid-second century AD this had accumulated over more than fifteen hundred years since the days of Moses, thus presented a serious dilemma for the lunisolar calendar. This is why in 161 AD the Jewish Patriarch Simon III had imposed the postponement of the intercalated year from the seventh to the eighth year to prevent Pentecost from falling on Monday, June 23, 161 AD which was the summer solstice in that year. This postponement was accomplished using an interim transition cycle of leap years 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17 and 19. As a result, all leap years after this adjustment were counted in the years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17 and 19, but all leap years prior to Simonís calendar adjustment of 161 AD were counted in the years 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16 and 18, thusly these leap-months were appended to those designated years after the twelfth month of Adar, according to the lunisolar Torah calendar of Moses. While the religious months of the calendar were counted as in Torah, beginning in the spring on 1 Abib [Heb. \b\u0005\b\u0007 , abiyb], the civil calendar months of the very same calendar were always counted fall-to-fall, so the first month in the civil new year was (and still is) the seventh month of the ecclesiastical calendar. The rules for observing the holy days in their proper seasons have always enjoyed top priority for calculating the Hebrew calendar, which was calculated years in advance according to the calendar rules in anticipation of these sacred ritual observances. Based on the repeating 19-year lunisolar cycle and in near-synchronicity with each monthís molad, these months were numbered 1-12, or 1-13 in leap years. As men- tioned in chapter 1, the first day of Abib [chodesh ha-aviv] only roughly coincided (i.e. ±50 days) with the barley being ìin the earî of old tradition [see Karaites ref. below]. The molad was more often than not a day or two earlier than a monthís first allowable day as a function of the calendar rules, but the molad was never allowed to occur too late, i.e. past the ìoverpost windowî by exceeding 05:23:27 PM that day for any given monthís calculations. The general idea was to prevent the molad from encroaching on the next dayís sunset before qualifying it as a 1st day of any future calendar month being calculated in lieu of any other postponement rules. There is a great deal of disinformation regarding the ancient Hebrews, treating them as if they were Neolithic hunter-gatherers incapable of adding two rocks plus two rocks, but nothing could be further from the truth! Quoting here from rabbi Maimonides: ìIt is thus a Mosaic tradition from Sinai that in times when there was a Palestinian Synedrium [Sanhedrin], declaration of New Moon Days was based on visual observation [confirming calculations made by the court years in advance], while in times"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Historical Calendar Of Jesus 53 when no Synedrium existed, this declaration was based[solely] on calculations such as we are using today and no attention was paid to observation of the new crescent. Rather, the day estab- lished [years before] by calculation might well coincide with the day in which the new moon became visible, but it might some- times be the day before it or the day after it.î ìThe court fol- lowed a tradition transmitted by the Sages from one generation to another on the authority of MosesÖ on the basis of calcula- tionÖ îó Code of Maimon., Bk3 Tr8, `Sanctification of the New Mooní 5x2;18x7 Considering that the ancient calendar month was reckoned at 29 days, 12 hours and 793 parts, i.e. 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes and 3 1/3 seconds, and also that month-to-month observations served to confirm and calibrate these commendably precise calculations, Mai- monidesí assumptive conclusion that the ancients couldnít calculate their own calendars accu- rately based on any molad is not being realistic, irrespective of that moladís actual ìvisibilityî. Rather, any months which were observed an entire day before the calculated molad would have to have been started deliberately, but certainly not for the lack of simple addition skills, and whether or not such was ever allowed to happen is extremely doubtful at best. The evi- dence indicates this was never allowed to happen: in all of my studies of all these ancient He- brew calendar dates, I have never once encountered any occasion where the molad was calculated to occur so much as 5 hours 422 parts past the sixth hour [18h, i.e. 12 OíClock Post Meridian; noting that 1 hour = 1080 parts, 1 part = 31/3 seconds, one minute = 18 parts]. This was and remains the absolute ìcut offî point which causes any calculated month to be delayed by at least one day ó often two days ó after the molad for that calculated syn- odic month, PERIOD. Although Iíve discovered one very peculiar instance where a 3-day de- lay was unavoidably forced in Cheshvan 3789 according to these strictly- observed overpost and holy day observance rules (see calendar at the end of Chapter 8 for details). Note here that the correction made by the molad zakein postponement rule pertains only to rosh cho- desh of Kislev or Shebat in any prior year, but is never applied to rosh ha-shannah, for which its molad must occur before the strictly-observed overpost limit of 0 hours 656 parts before it can even be considered as a potential first day for the civil new year, otherwise the Feast of Trumpets absolutely MUST be delayed. But this is getting too far afield of our focus, but I in- clude this discussion for experts in the Hebrew calendar. What this all means is that the ancients knew perfectly-well how to count, thus these cal- endars were calculated methodically, and years in advance well-before the days of Noah, circa"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Voice Of One 54 28,000 BC. Think about it: add 29 days, 12 hours and 793 parts to the last new moon; are YOU still within a few secondsí accuracy? Easily, especially since this calculated synodic num- ber can be added to multiple months over many (calculated) lunations preceding that month, just to make sure that the last molad wasnít ìoff the mark,î i.e., too far outside the overpost window for that calculated first day of the month. Realize that the molad is an arithmetical re- sult of ancient astronomical computations which continually and dynamically tracked the time of every molad [mean lunar-solar conjunction] to within 1 day in 14,000 years, with occa- sional visual confirmations serving to rectify and calibrate potentially cumulative errors in fu- ture predictions. The ìmetonic cycleî is attributed to the Athenian astronomer Meton [c. 432 BC], based on observations made by Euctemon. Metonís calculations were refined by the astronomer Cal- lipus, then by Hipparchus, et al, as the centuries passed. As myth would have it, Meton and Euctemon were the first observers since Godís ìfounding of the sunsî [ref. M.T. Cicero {106- 43 BC}] to recognize that 235 contiguous lunations brought the tropical- solar year into near- perfect commensurability with the mean lunar conjunction [molad]. But on the antediluvian time scale, Meton & Co. were Johnny-come-latelies to astronomy & astrology, and the ìmetonic cycleî has been observed for many, many, many long ages. Common-sense reasoning helps us to understand why the scholarly rabbanite Tobias ben Eliezer refuted the Karaitesí unreasonable demand for a predominantly lunar observation by the visible new crescent, the erudite rabbi surmising that ìintercalation [was used] from Adam to Noah, Öto Shem, Öto Jacob, Öto Kehath, ..to Amram, the father of Mosesî Ö ì[and] was calculated similarly among the scattered Jews and [that] this same method of calculation had been transmitted to the sages of his own time, that they should also sanctify the months ac- cordinglyî [paraphrased]. So, these calculations were sometimes confirmed and calibrated by observation, but seldom if ever vice-versa. This verse from Moses speaks volumes on the wis- dom of Torah calendar rules: ìYe shall have One Law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.î — Num 15:29 AV Finally, this quote from Maimonides speaks pristinely about the true astronomically- calculated lunisolar calendar: ìÖ the method of the fixed calendar is one which an average school child can master in 3 or 4 daysî [Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh 11:4]."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Historical Calendar Of Jesus 55 Now that youíve had a basic introduction to the true lunisolar calendar and its basic principles of calculation , here are its months summarized for convenient reference: Month#** Hebrew Name Days per Month 1(7) Abib/Nisan* 30 2(8) Zif/Iyyar 29 3(9) Sivan* 30 4(10) Tammuz 29 5(11) Ab/Av 30 6(12) Elul 29 7(1) Ethanim/Tishri* 30 8(2) Bul/Cheshvan 29/30(optional) 9(3) Kislev 30/29(optional) 10(4) Tebet 29 11(5) Shebat 30 12(6) Adar/AdarI 29/30(leap yr.) 13(ì) VíAdar/AdarII 29(intercalary) *months with holy days; **civil month #ís in parentheses "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" Chapter 6 Coming Of Age J ESUS í 30 TH BIRTHDAY WAS 1 Elul 3787, which was Friday, August 22, 27 AD.

Notably the new year 1 Tishri 3305 [Sept 21, 457 BC] started Danielís 49-year count- down to the next sabbath of sabbaths and Jubilee, be- ginning the year 3355, clearly emphasizing the Atonement & Life Everlasting in the acceptable year of the Lord. Thatís why Daniel explicitly wrote ìsheba shabua shishshiym shaonayim shabuaî [ref. Dan 9:25 BHS], literally 7 + 62 weeks, in this context counting in years. Hence 7 x 7 = 49 years. + 62 x 7 = 434, so 49 + 434 = 483 years. The final week of years, i.e., years 484 through 490, is Jesusí ministry, half of which Heís already used up, leaving just 3 Ω years remaining. Thus 434 + 7 = 441, which divided by 49 equals 9 consecutive Jubilee years. Add the previous Jubilee at the end of the first 49 years of this 490 year prophetic timeline, then clearly, we find ten Jubilees in a row are counted in real-time. Weíve already seen nine of these ten Jubilee years come to pass, with the first beginning in the year 3355 [407-406 BC], through the ninth which began on the day that Jesus-Christ was baptised. This still leaves 3 Ω years until the remaining tenth Jubilee, but determining when that 3 Ω year period begins or ends is not so easily deduced, but does tie in directly with the approximately 3 Ω year tribula- tion period as found in Daniel and Revelation.

John the Baptist did not yet recognize Jesus as Messiah, though he knew that his miracle-working cousin ó that amazing ìcarpenterís sonî Jesus ó John knew that Je- sus was one month into His 30th year of life on the day of His baptism. It was on that day that Jesus became Rabbi of rabbis: The Master of masters [Mat 23:8, John 1:38,49]. That John the Baptist did not yet recognize his amazing cousin as Messiah the Prince means that John was as yet unawares that Jesus was conceived of Godís Spirit in Mary. You see, had John previously known about this **immaculate conception**, then he wouldíve clearly understood that Jesus was the Messiah as prophesied in the TaNaKh and in all other divinely- inspired works from around the world, with Jesusí divine conception in that marriageable young woman named Mary [Heb. \t \u0005 \u000b , Miryam, Gk. \u0017 \u000f\t\f or \u0017 \u000f\t ] scripturally pre- requisite to his divinely- foreordained messiahship. Recall that at the time of Jesusí conception, Mary was betrothed but not yet married to Joseph [Heb. \f\r\u0002\u0005 , Yowceph, Gk. \u0001\u0018 \u0003\u0002\u0013 ]: ìTherefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a vir- gin* shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuelî ó Isa 7:14 AV *Heb. \u0004\u000b \u0006\u0001 , Almah, meaning exclusively ìa marriageable young womanî; in no instance has it ever been proven to refer to any woman who was not a virgin, not only in the Bible, but not in any context of the Hebrew writings. Although virgin birth mythologies had long-since flourished in virtually every race-culture throughout the world, every Jew knew that ìsalvation out of the Jews isî [John 4:22]. Thereby we know that John, understandably, had supposed Jesusí father to be Joseph, as did almost everyone else. Only a select few knew at the time [e.g. Elisabeth & Zacharias plainly knew] that Joseph was but lawfully Jesusí father according to the custom, though under the Jewish law, Jesus was heir to the throne by His legal father and also by His own mother, since accord- ing to the ancient Jewish custom the right to kingship could also pass to Maryís descendants. This made Jesus heir to the throne by bloodline to king David, by Jewish custom, by Jewish law, and by the supreme will of God. Jesus was destined for the throne of Israel, so when you hear His title King of the Jews, now you understand that this title is more than mere religious hyperbolae: Jesus is in the most literal sense KING OF THE JEWS, and more than this, He is Ruler over the kings of the Earth. The Bible makes this clear.

At One with God [John 10:30], Jesus commenced His Divine Ministry ìconfirming the covenant with manyî [Dan 9:27]. The 70th and final week of Danielís prophecy commenced with the preaching of John the Baptist and with the Ministry of Jesus. As noted in chapter 1, one Hebrew day is composed of ìevening and morningî, divided by the Earthís rotation and orbit with respect to the Sun. Each Hebrew year is similarly di- vided by the fall and vernal equinoxes. Gabrielís conspicuous tandem emphasis on both John and Jesus was best answered by John himself, at the moment Jesus was baptised: ìthis is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me. And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with waterî [John 1:30-31]. And Jesusí own words: ìbefore Abraham was, I AM [was]î [John 8:58], and by His [own] Angel [Atma] ìÖI AM the root and the offspring of DavidÖthe bright and morning starî [Rev 22:16].

A year is equal to ~365.2422 days, so this baptism date of Jesus is precisely seven actual Hebrew calendar months from Johnís 30th birthday plus 483 tropical-solar years-to-the-day counting from Ezraís going for- ward with Artaxerxesí decree, a difference of only 2.23 from 2.02 = {-0.21} days, or just five hours shy of 483 actual Hebrew calendar years."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Historical Calendar Of Jesus 59 Really, who could ask for more accuracy than this? And whoís to say these mere five hours arenít accounted for by differences in the time of day Ezra left Babylon, and the time of day ìthe word of God came unto Johnî? But, had weíd adopted Sept 2, 458 BC as Artaxerxesí sev- enth year(as referenced in chapter 1), then that date was exactly 7 Hebrew calendar months plus 483 tropical- solar years + 4 hours to what was a very popular, but hopelessly invalidated ìalternateî for Jesusí Baptism of ì1 Tishri 3787î, or Monday, Sep 2, 26 AD; Julian Day 1730799, with its molad occurring Sat, August 31, 26 AD @ 1:27 AM JST; JD 1730796.4772. But that date is entirely one calendar year *prior* to the earliest date historically-reconcilable with Tiberiusí 15th year, and is one year too soon for Gabrielís 483 actual years to have elapsed, thus is eliminated from further consideration. This means that 1 Tishri 3788 is the only actual, historical dating reconcilable with both Ezraís account and that related by Luke; to wit, Luke 3:1 reads ìÖin year but five and tenth of the governorship of Tiberius CÊsarî [em- phasis added]. In the year 12 AD, Tiberius was made military governor(commander) over CÊsarís vast armies and provinces by the ailing Augustus, at which time Augustus had com- pelled his estranged- widow Julia to marry Tiberius, thus historically qualifies as his 1st year of governorship. Ancient coins from Antioch dated AUC 765 [12 AD] display the head of Ti- berius with the inscription: ëKaisar Sebastosí [CÊsar Augustus]. An ancient document written by the Roman senator Dion Cassius recounts major events of 12 AD in which he noted: ìAu- gustus, because he was growing old, wrote a letter commending Germanicus to the senate and the latter[the senate] to Tiberiusî[ref. LVI.26]. No later than 13 AD, Tiberius Claudius Nero was already known to the whole of the Roman empire and its provinces as supreme military governor and co-regent with Augustus, since Tiberius was by that time Proconsular Imperium, wielding full tribunician power wholly co-extensive with that of Augustus, making Tiberius co-princeps with Augustus from 12-13 AD until Augustusí death. Thus we see, fully two years before Augustus had died, Tiberiusí sole Consulship was already fully intact, and was wholly unassailable, with his *continuation* as Principate merely a foregone conclusion. Tiberiusí inauguration as Imperator was little more than a formality, and Lukeís reckoning for his 15th year is further confirmed by the fact that by 27 AD, a much-wearied Tiberius had retired permanently to seclusion on the island of Capri, leaving his notorious and traitorous captain of the PrÊtorian Guard, the prefect Sejanus, to rule in his place (but not in his stead, as the annals of history attest). So, with 27 AD established as Tiberiusí ìfive and tenth year of governorshipî, it is demon- strated that Luke correctly reckoned Tiberiusí 15th regnal year as 27 AD, by counting from his military governorship and co-regency in 12-13 AD. Also, Lukeís references to Pilate, Herod [Antipas], Philip, Lysanias, Annas and Caiaphas are fully supportive of 3773 [12-13 AD] as the first Hebrew civil-regnal year which the gentile physician Luke mightíve considered in his clearly Roman calendar reference to CÊsar, since in every case they are historically accurate"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"At One With God 60 and thus are entirely consistent with 3787 [26-27 AD] as Tiberiusí 15th [gentile] regnal year.

It is notable that Ezraís Jubilee Year in Jerusalem was 3305 (Hebrew) or 457-456 BC (Ro- man), thus counting by contiguous 50 calendar- year increments, it is then a simple matter to establish which years were Jubilee Years ever since. But ever since Jesus was crucified, old covenant laws were completely fulfilled, such that observing ritual holidays and customs, while all fine and good, are entirely superseded by the new covenant.

There were two separate hagigah sacrifices. First was the pesah proper, which was the paschal meal prepared and served hastily on the eve of 14 Abib [Nisan]. The second pascha was the after- noon hagigah sacrifice, also on 14 Abib, which was the festive offering completed before the festivities of the First Day of Unleavened Bread began on the evening of 15 Abib. About two weeks before this whole eight-day feast began, tithes were separated for the priesthood from the flocks of sheep. Quoting from the King James: ìYe know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. Then assembled to- gether the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, and consulted that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him.

Now look at John 18:28: ìThen led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judg- ment hall, lest they should be defiled [i.e., avoiding ceremonial uncleanness]; but that they might eat the passover.î Such ceremonial uncleanness lasted only until sunset, but would have prevented Jews from participating in the festivities of the ìfirst day of unleavened cakesî on 15 Abib. This ìpaschaî is in reference to the second [14 Abib] afternoon hagigah, not the previous eveningís pesah proper which was the Lordís Supper. Observance of Passover/Unleavened Bread was universal among all Jews, and the gospels reflect their traditional seder [order]: arranging a place for celebration, gathering at least ten but no more than twenty persons to share in evening meal. The woman of the households started at even, 13 Abib using candles to search for and remove any leaven or yeast, and also chemicals used for dyeing, womenís make-up, and even glues were removed from the prem- ises. All participants fasted before the evening meal of 14 Abib. Note that John and Peter re- served the room and made ready the ìlamb without blemishî which had been separated on 10 Abib (notably the day Jesus rode into Jerusalem) for the evening meal of 14 Abib. The chosen lamb was taken to the Temple and slaughtered, then skewered through the mouth on a pome- granate spit, adjoined by a smaller crossmember passing just under the shoulders. It was then roasted over an open flame and devoured quickly as commanded in the Torah [Exo 12]. The carcass and any uneaten portions were burnt to ashes. As briefly mentioned in chapter 1, Torah calendar rules assured that Passover (14 Abib/Nisan) must occur no earlier than two days before the spring equinox, but also, these same rules stipulated that Pentecost must occur before summer, and always completed by Monday, on the 7th, 9th, 11th or 13th of the 3rd month(Sivan), leaving but one possible cru- cifixion date for 31 AD. The gospel ëAccording to Johní reveals that Jesus observed four Pass- overs after His baptism of Sept. 20, 27 AD. Counting from the spring of 28 AD [John 2:13], 29 AD [John 4:35,5:1], 30 AD [John 6:4], and the Last Supper Passover of 31 AD [John 12:1], whereupon that day our Lord was crucified.

In light of all other evidences examined, this fact proves beyond any reasonable doubt that the Institution of the Eucharist [Gk. Eucaristia, ìThanksgivingî] most definitely took place on Tuesday evening, April 24th, 31 AD, between 6 PM and 12 AM Wednesday morning, and very much according to traditional seder regulations [Heb. haggada]; but this Passover was very special indeed [Mat 26:1-30; Mark 14:1-26; Luke 22:1-39; John 11:55-57]! Iíve charted the proleptic calendar year 3791 at the end of this chapter, dating the historical ìthree days and three nightsî[i.e. 72-contiguous hours; ref. Jonah 1:17, Mat 12:40] that Jesusí brutally-maimed body laid wrapped in a linen shroud, sealed in the nearby, newly-hewn stone sepulchre of the wealthy intellectual and named disciple of Christ, Joseph of Arimathaea [Mat 27:57-60]. In the literal translation, verse 57 says ìOf evening but having come to beî, mean- ing that the High Sabbath of 15 Abib was in effect. Remember, this was the body of the LORD of the Sabbath, thus giving Jesus a proper burial even on the High Sabbath was perfectly Law- ful and appropriate, but Joseph et alia performed this work in considerable haste for fear of the Jews [i.e., those whoíd admonished Pilate to condemn Jesus to death], ref. John 19:38], that they wouldíve found them working on the sabbath ìcriminalî, and wouldíve prohibited them from continuing, and arrested them, too. Had this occurred, they mightíve been cruci- fied as well for working on the High SabbathÖ under such bloody circumstances. This is critical to the readerís understanding of these events, thus I quote from the most literal transla- tion available of the ancient Alexandrian texts [Westcott-Hort; see chapter 11]. Compare these literal verses with your favorite Bible(s) for assured clarity and comprehension: ìPilate but having called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people said toward them YOU bore toward to me the man this as turning from he people, and look!

LAT on the Passover, 14 Abib [Nisan] 3791 [Mark 15:25], which date was Wednesday, April 25, 31 AD. Suffering pain-unimaginable, although Mel Gib- sonís new movie ìThe Passionî gives us some idea, Jesus died shortly after 3 PM that dark af- ternoon [ref. Mat 27:45-50; Mar 15:33-37; Luk 23:44- 46]. Thus ìMessiah the Princeî had been ìcut offî literally in the ìmidst of the weekî [Wednesday], and in the midst of the seven- tieth sabbatic year[ref. Dan 9:24-27], just as the prophecy had foretold 568 years before in an- cient Babylon [Dan 9:1ff]. Jesusí body was taken down from the cross near sunset and was entombed after sunset on the eve of the High Sabbath of the Feast of Unleavened Bread [Mat 27:57; Mark 15:42; Luke 23:54; John 19:42]. The paschal lamb, the one ìwithout blemishî was selected 10 Nisan [Exo 12]. This was the Passover meal [pesah proper] that Jesus shared with His disciples on the eve of His crucifixion. The second pascha, the afternoon hagigah sac- rifice was from 3 to 5 that afternoon, starting at the time Jesus died. Jesus was Godís Lamb for both Passover offerings, and His sacrifice left all others of none effect: Jesus had literally be- come the Passover, the mutually chosen (elect) Lamb of God [John 1:29,36]. Also, the de- struction of the 2nd temple was on 15 Av 3830 [Aug 10, 70 AD, not the faulty ì9 Avî of common tradition], which fulfilled Gabrielís ìhe shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to ceaseÖî [Dan 9:27]; this divine cause was clearly Jesusí crucifixion nearly 40 years prior to that date.

The molad for Nisan 3790 was Wednesday, Mar 22, 30 AD @ 8:57:59 PM JST [JD 1732096.29027], placing 1 Nisan the next day, Thursday, March 23, 30 AD, thus 14 Nisan fell on Wednesday, April 5, 30 AD; therefore the traditional ìGood Friday/30 ADî chronology has been squarely refuted by the evidence, which selfsame evidence has proven Wednesday, April 25, 31 AD is the historical date of our Lordís crucifix- ion, thus is presented and accepted as fact. Oh yes, and for all you ì33 AD crucifixionî devo- tees out there, here, Iíll save you the trouble: The molad for Nisan 3793 was Thursday, March 19, 33 AD @ 2:46:38 PM JST[JD 1733189.03238], placing 1 Nisan on a Saturday, March 21, 33 AD, with 14 Nisan falling on Friday, April 3, 33 AD. So thereís your Nicaean ìGood Fridayî for the crucifixion, but 33 AD doesnít hold up very well to being in the ìmidstî of Gabrielís 70th sabbatic year[5.5 out of 7 calendar years], nor is Friday near the ìmidst of the weekî as Wednesday certainly is, but the final nail in the coffin for the saecularis defunctus ìGood Fri- dayî mythos is provided by the Scriptures alone, since from after sunset Friday evening [ref. Mat 27:57-60, John 19:38-42] to after sunset Saturday evening[Mark 16:9] totals but ONE DAY only, or perhaps a day and seven-twelfths if one presumes to stretch it out from after 3 PM Friday; i.e., from the moment Jesus died, or three hours before His body was taken down from the pale [Lat. crux] and entombed after even as the scriptures do clearly and indisputably testify, to 5 AM Sunday morning (sunrise, again, as the scriptures clearly testify, squeezing out every last drop for the benefit of diehard ìGood Fridayî mythologists), which is still well-shy of even two days and two nights, much less the REQUISITE ìthree days and three nights in the heart of the earthî [Mat 12:40] which our Lord prophesied! The ìGood Fridayî myth is hopelessly irreconcilable with all evidence examined. And there are many additional verses to cite demonstrating Wednesday April 25, 31 AD to be the actual crucifixion date of Jesus the Christ, but why bother? The true historicity of GOOD WEDNESDAY is hereby established, and all detractors are silenced forever.

Covered by a swath cloth [`Su- darium of Oviedoí] and wrapped in linen [`Shroud of Turiní], His body was sealed in the nearby, newly-hewn stone sepulchre of the disciple Joseph of Arimathaea [Mat 27:57-60].

Mary and Marthaís brother Lazarus might have left some similar image in the swathing bands and face cloth he was wrapped in [John 11:1-44, 12:17]? Notably, the clothes of persons whoíve died wearing them for any length of time after their deathís have never once been shown to have any such image impressed into their clothingís fibers, thus proving the shroudís image is not a function of any process known to science, since the man in the shroud was very clearly a man whoíd been dead i.e. clinically and biologically dead not living. Hence, by all scientific accounts, the image should not be there, but there it is nonetheless, providing com- pelling evidence for the shroudís authenticity; but thereís a lot more evidence to thisÖ The Turin shroud and Sudarium cloth are pages of Scripture penned in the precious blood of our Lord & Savior Jesus-Christ ìsignedî by the hand of God. Just as Scripture endures all scrutiny in the Spirit of Prophecy which is testimony Jesus- Christ, the shroud and face cover- ing invite all manner of secular-religious critiques, yet the artifacts do prevail under the bright- est lights that the scientific inquiry has to offer. We know that the shroud & face covering are the genuine burial linen of Jesus since the evidence clearly proves itónot that any such evi- dence is ìrequisiteî to the Christian faith, but neither does this imply that one should simply turn a blind eye to all this evidence, especially since the evidence is 100% conclusive. If evi- dence sways a few doubting Thomasís out there, then we as Christians have fared well. The following items are my own redactions of key evidences posted on Internet websites: ï Doctors of medicine, those who are experts in the human anatomy, particularly forensic pa- thologists, medical examiners, coroners and the like, have examined the image in the shroud, concluding that this adult male in his 30s had suffered severe beatings and crucifix- ion precisely as is described in the New Testament gospel accounts. Some of these medical professionals have admitted openly that ìthis image could be of none other than the One, crucified Jesusî [ref. Bucklin, M.D., J.D.; et al]. But one need not be an human anatomist to be horrified at the obvious match between a Roman flagellum and the double-beaded wounds on the victimís back, or the distinctive profile of the lance where he was stabbed in the region of his 5th rib; ï The shroud measures 4.6 x 1.1 meters, which are the standard measurements of 8 x 2 Phila- telic cubits used in Palestine in the first century AD. It bears the front and back images of our Lord crucified in a manner identical to that which was testified to in the Scriptures. The shroud is the most intensively scrutinized artifact in recorded history, with scientific testing proving time and again that the image was produced NOT by artistic methods, but by pro- found physical changes in the linen fibers themselves by process(es) unknown and to date unidentified. Physicist Osward Schewermann, whoíd conducted experiments on the phe-"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Night And Day 86 nomenon of coronal discharge, i.e., emission of radiation from a surface charged with static electricity, Schewermann observed that flat objects such as leaves will discharge electrons from their edges when they touch cloth, forming well-defined lines which follow contours where the leaves and cloth make actual contact, but are more diffused where the materials are close, but donít actually touch. This is partially characteristic of most of the shroudís smaller images, describing most images but the inexplicable image formed by the crucified body: THIS image no scientist in the world can explain; ï The herringbone twill @ 3:1 weave is distinctively of first-century Syrian manufacture. The flax fibrils contain entwisted cotton fibrils from the very same loom, the cotton Gossypium herbaceum , a Middle East species not found in Europe; ï The shroud contains myriad pollen grains from at least 58 species of plants, 17 of which are indigenous to Europe(where itís been kept for the last seven centuries), but most are indige- nous to the region of the Dead Sea and Turkey, including Artemisia herba-alba, Nyoscyamus aureus, and Onosma syriacum. Even the pollen the Guindellia naforte, the spiny plant which formed the wreath of thorns, this was found to be of local origin. But the Zygophyl- lum dumosum is identified as being the most significant plant imaged in the shroud, as it grows only in Israel, Jordan, and Sinai. The winter leaves all reveal their previous yearís petioles, proving the plants were picked in the springtime, as does the state of growth for every plant thus far identified. Some rather surprising images have also been identified, in- cluding a hammer and a nail, a broom, an ancient- style rope, even the sponge and reed [Mark 15:36]! These items all by themselves are evidence enough, but the list continues. ï Blood was typed AB in all scientific testing performed. This ancient blood was found to con- tain very high levels of bilirubin consistent with the severe concussive injuries suffered by our Lord on that prophesied Passover of 31 AD; ï C14 measurements of bacteria, fungi and bioplastic/biogenic varnish deposited as a result of the symbiosis between the two organisms had compromised the results of every C14 test done. These 1988 radiocarbon dating tests averaged remnant C14 of the original linen with the microorganisms Lichenothelia and Rhodococcus AND the resultant calcium carbonate varnish. This bioplastic varnish was NOT removed by the cleaning procedures used in ra- diocarbon labs, and these microorganisms are still present, living and multiplying on the linen shroud of Turin. [ref. Mattingly/ Garza-Vermes]; this was admitted to by the testís in- ventor, yet the ìdebunkersî ignore these and all other evidences proving the shroud is not a ìpaintingî;"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Historical Calendar Of Jesus 87 ï The swath cloth [Sudarium of Oviedo; John 20:6-7] shows an obvious match with the image and stains on the shroud in at least 120 points of coincidence, and the Sudarium is known to date at its very least back to 613 AD from Palestine, and 1075 AD in Spain, further prov- ing that the radiocarbon tests were compromised. This by itself is evidence that the shroud is the genuine burial linen of Jesus; ï Particulate iron-oxide permeating the shroud was proven NOT to be some ìartistís pigmentî, and likewise, was proven NOT to be the cause of the image in the linen fibrils of the shroud, irrespective of its origin(s). X-ray fluorescent analysis confirmed that there was ìno discern- able relevanceî between concentrations of iron oxide particles and the varying densities of the image. Microspectrophotometric analysis of blood from the shroud found hemoglobin, but in its acid-methemoglobin form due to its great antiquity and denaturation. Additional tests identified the presence of porphyrin, albumin, bilirubin and protein. Also, ìwhen pro- teases were applied to a fibril containing the denaturated blood, the blood dissolved, but left an imageless fibrilî[ref. Heller/Adler]. This proves the image contemporaneous with the an- cient blood by demonstrating that those fresh bloodstains were absorbed by the cloth before formation of the image contained in the linen fibrils, thus the bodyís image is inextricably linked to the presence of that same dead bodyís blood! Drís Adler and Heller went further by applying pleochroism, birefringence and chemical analysis, thereby determining that, unlike artistís pigment which contains iron oxide contaminated by manganese, cobalt, and nickel, the iron oxide on the shroud is relatively pure. Subsequent research into the proce- dures of flax preparation and linen manufacture showed that pure iron oxide is perfectly normal to the process of fermenting(retting) flax in large outdoor vats of water. This is con- clusive evidence that the iron oxide on the shroud of Turin is NOT the remnant of ìartistís pigmentî [ref. STURP; Morris, Schwalbe, London; X-Ray Spectrometry, Vol 9, no. 2, 1980, pp 40-47; Schwalbe, L.A. & Rogers, R.N., Analytica Chimica Acta 135, 1982, pp 3-19]; ï In 1532 the chapel at Chambery caught fire, and the heat was so intense that part of the sil- ver reliquary where the shroud was stored melted, dripping onto the folded shroud. The shroud was saved from the fire but the burns were significant, since the shroud had been exposed to intense heat at low oxygen levels. This may have contributed to the grossly inac- curate radiocarbon dating of the shroud, as mightíve the centuries of tallow candle smoke and incense residue, too; ï When iconography dating to the sixth century was rescaled then superimposed on the shroudís face, at least 170 unique points of congruity were clearly identified with the com- posite image.

Because we know that prophecies of the prophets are genuine, then the tim- ing of prophecies are seldom so easy to discern, due to that unpredictable wrench in the works, our own free will. Mans perception of time is fleeting. A healthy person who enjoys the advantage of youth thinks he or she is going to live forever. If that person is fortunate enough to stay healthy and live a long and fruitful life, then the average human lifespan seems too short, and old age catches up with even the best of us. So the ìdeath wishî is our best coping skill, as we learn to look death right in the eye, and even laugh in face of death, not because itís funny, but because proximity or exposure to death can cause a person to laugh hysterically. Most of us would like to see the second advent, the victory of good over evil in our own lifetimes. But when it doesnít happen weíre bound to become impatient, as if the advent of Christ were subordinate to our own selfish desires. But this is just another step along the path, and as we grow older & wiser, we nurture patience through acceptance and surrender. Itís the interpretation of death that is made clear, as the sleeping prophet Edgar Cayce so aptly stated in reading 5748-006:"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The Chronology 96 ì(Q) What definite details are indicated as to what will happen after we enter the period of the Kingís Chamber? (A) When the bridegroom is at hand, all do rejoice. When we enter that understanding of being in the Kingís presence, with that of the mental seeking, the joy, the buoyancy, the new un- derstanding, the new life, through the period. (Q) What is the significance of the empty sarcophagus? (A) That there will be no more death. Donít mis- understand or misinterpret! but the INTERPRETATION of death will be made plain. (Q) If the Armageddon is foretold in the Great Pyramid, please give a description of it and the date of its beginning and ending. (A) Not in what is left there. It will be as a thousand years, with the fighting in the air, and - as has been - between those returning to and those leaving the earth.î Jesusí presence or ì \u0012\u000f\u0004\u0005\u0003\t î in the koi-neí (common Greek), is likely as near to inde- scribable as anyone can ever see, or hear, or touch, or understand in any way, shape, or form. The universal archetype of the I AM or to make possible the impossible might be as close as any other feeble attempt at describing His presence, since words have power, especially when spoken in earnest prayer as in sackcloth and ashes ìas to hear the lament of those in shackles, as to set free the sons appointed to dieî to quote Nostradamusí epistle to the ill-fated king Henry II of France. The more humility we can feel deep down in our heart of hearts, then the more we are apt to experience this ì \u0012\u000f\u0004\u0005\u0003\t î. But God knows how proud we are, or as ìFa- ther Damien Karrasî whispered in The Exorcist III, ìdeath be not proud though some have called thee mighty and dreadful, thou art not so. Though, soonest our best men with thee go, rest of their bones and souls delivereth. But those thou dost thinkest thou dost overthrow, die not. Poor death. Nor canst thou kill me.îóRef.
