Jerome began work on the Vulgate in 382 AD. And by 386, heíd moved to Bethlehem. While there he worked on the Old Testament, beginning with the Greek LXX Septuagint, but Jerome chose to work di- rectly from the Hebrew & Aramaic. By 405 AD, the Old Testament, and the rest of the New Testament was finished.

Its promise ìto revealî the second advent, our resurrection in Christ, is why this manuscript has attracted so much interest beyond the fold of orthodox believersóespecially since the ìnew ageî enthu- siasts took it to their own level of interpretation, misinterpretation, and whatever they could do to adapt it to their own dogmas. As the Christian reader peruses my interlinear translation from the Latin Vulgate, emphasis on the present-tense will not go unnoticed. Familiar phrases like ìChrist is risen!î are exem- plary of how the past participle ìhasî is conveyed in the perfect mood or tense of the verb to the benefit of the readerís comprehension of the activity being described. Redundant expres- sions like ìthis was to beî, ìit is to beî, ìhe is coming to beî, while archaic, emphasize con- tinuance of events in their dynamic setting, and their far-reaching consequences & contextual pertinence to the subject matter. The astrological precepts set forth in my first four books are essential to the study of the Apocalypse. The analysis presented hereinbelow of the translation given hereinabove uses as- trological terminology as defined and charted in my preceding work. That way, I can keep my commentary concise, and I can only advise the reader to become better informed.

The named ìseven churchesî in the Roman province of pro- consular Asia in western Asia Minor were located in its seven districts (as renowned historian W. M. Ramsay pointed out). Patmos wasnít so far away from the capital city of Ephesus, lo- cated near the modern village of Selcuk 27E22 37N56, and where once stood the magnificent temple of Artemisóone of the seven wonders of the ancient world at 180í wide by 360í length and built exclusively of marble. Ephesus was the ancient seat of Greek power before the sixth century BC when Athens attained governmental dominance. By Johnís time, it was a thriving metropolis with 1/4 million inhabitants and preserved the rich culture of classic western civili- zation. Upon his release in 96 AD, John returned to Ephesus, where he compiled his apoca- lyptic memoirs. The Revelation showed scholars that the Bible was complete. It was soon codi- fied. Notably, ancient Egypto-Babylonian cultures had maintained and developed accurate methods of astronomical observation and computation for predicting sidereal and synodic orbits of the planets ten thousand years before the first century. They used this data to com- pute calendars, observe holidays, and most especially for the purpose of astrological charts, and even for monumental architecture, such as the Pyramids. These principles of observation, computation and deduction spread for thousands of years, and over thousands of miles. Commonality of astronomical-astrological practices is exemplified in biblical astrology, the ancient judicial method used by the most devout religious astronomers in the world. There are three Greek words in the New Testament which are used with respect to the ex- pected second advent. These are \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0001\u0005\u0006\u0002\u0007\b\t , \u0002\u0001\r\u0003\u0006\u0007\b\u0001 and \u000e\u0002\b\u000f\u0001\f\u000e\b\u0001 , meaning ìrevela- tionî, ìpresenceî, and ìappearanceî, respectively. The third word, epiphany, has been applied to the twelfth day of Christmas January 6 in the orthodox tradition, or a moment of sudden and oft-fleeting intuitive enlightenment per consciousness of something divinely-inspired. In the ancient world, such experiences were expressed in religious-astronomical terms, since the T T T "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Minís Concise Commentary 114 heavens and the earth were an integral and vital part of religion around the world, in every culture and in every epoch of ancient and antediluvian civilization going back to the stone age. In truth, the heavens and the earth have always been and will always be essential to exis- tence, inseparable from reality, tantamount to lifeís experiences in both soul and body. Every inhabited solar system in the universe has its time and place of creation, of sustaining and of destroying. Every vast galaxy has a lifespan: birth, life and death over long aeons. Ancient gal- axies are shown by the Hubble space telescope to be in every stage of development in deep field images. Some just being born, others well on their way to dying some fifteen billion lightyears away from the Earth. And this appears the same universally in all directions. Forget your ìbig bangî. The universe is infinite, of infinite size and infinite age. Donít ask how many galaxies are in the universe. Ask how infinite is God the Creator of the universe. Now, letís look at RevelationÖ Of course, the chapter divisions of every biblical book is somewhat arbitrary, not added by its original authors, but by the Archbishop of Canterbury Stephen Langton circa 1227 AD. Usage of Langtonís chapter convention was made popular by the Wycliffe English Bible of 1382. The Authorised King James Version of 1611 took the Holy Bible into every house- hold of English-speaking Xians in the worldóor just about. Even non-Xians are impressed by its beautiful language and magnificently-told stories. The King James ìAVî has become the most read & quoted book in the history of civilization. It is therefore that weíll follow the same chapter numbers in my book of commentary on the Revelation. Ergo Chapter 1. The first chapter of the Apocalypse introduces each reader to the authorís dear friend, lord and saviour Jesus Christ, who even by this early date of 96 AD needs no introduction. The seeds of the Gospel took root in Ephesus. The audience of first-century proconsular Asia wouldíve been absolutely infuriate at any religious teacher who didnít sing praises to the Muses, to God ìZeusî and to the other Olympian Gods of heaven. Try explaining this to your modern-day orthodox Xians and Judaists (i.e. religious Jews) and youíre liable to be misunder- stood, and get accused of being a ìsorcererî. I invite the reader to travel back in time to the world of first century proconsular Asia. Suddenly, names like ìZeusî and speaking of ìthe Godsî makes a whole lot of sense. You know full-well who Zeus is, and you know full-well who the Gods areÖas did the Hebrew-Egyptian priest Ra-Moses 1900 years before them. As did Romans, Greeks, Hindus, kabalist Hebrews, and basically the whole populace of every country, whether they believed in the God of Abra- ham or not. Theyíd at least know that Zeus is the God of the planet which the Romans called ìJupiterî seeing that the God and the planet are oneórather the planet is the vast region or vessel of God, which vessels Moses and all of Egypt with him knew as ìelohiymî. Noted or- thodox historian Robert Hand has posted charts comparing ancient Greek and Sanskrit names for some of the most common terms used by ancient astrologers. This shows astronomic cor-"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 115 relation between the two vast cultures of ancient Greeks and Hindus. It is important to note that Abraham is universally credited with bringing the alphabet of astrology which has 22 characters (10 planets and their 12 signs) to other regions beyond his homeland. Eventually these were called the Chaldean alphabet, which by the time of the prophets Daniel and Ezekiel in the sixth century BC shared roughly common characters in Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, Phoe- nician, Roman, Samaritan etc. most of which survive to this day in the modern English lan- guage albeit their exact pronunciation and grammatical usage would vary widely from lan- guage to language and from millennium to millennium. It was still the alphabet of the ten planets which embody the Gods in their orbits plus the twelve signs which celebrate their reign in the Earth from their positions to the Earth. Any added or missing characters simply ignore that sign or planet, or else they are intended as combinations, such as the Greek letter ìPsiî, which seems to combine the P and S sounds by softening them. The result being, that scripture itselfóall writing in factóis written frae end-to-end in astrological letters. Even the numbers, 1 through 10, have a corresponding God-AND-Planet: 1 Moon, 2 Mercury, 3 Venus, 4 Sun, 5 Mars, 6 Jupiter, 7 Saturn, 8 Uranus, 9 Neptune, & 10 Pluto. Once you begin to rec- ognize that astrology is so intrinsically integrated with every aspect of our lifeóas to be syn- onymous with lifeóthen youíll understand why the Apocalypse requires the astrological mind to understand it, and leaves those who fear such ancient knowledge perplexed and frustrated. From this point forward Iíll speak in pure astrological language to comment on the Apoca- lypse. If you donít understand any of it, learn about judicial astrology first. Then read it again. Youíll be amazed I guarantee it. The angel of Jesus is his own light-body. Zeus, charitible sphere, ìGod givesî. Faith (Sun). Hope (Venus) and Charity (Jupiter) ìthe greatest of these is Jupiterî (1 Cor 13:13). The Word, is the togetherness of the voices of the Gods of the heavens which begins as one and ends as one, and which splays out into the rainbow of the planets of creation and sustain- ing and destroying. Seven sidereal (diatonic) modes through Twelve synodic (chromatic) signs which form the 84 key signatures of the Gods. Donít forget the ancient world was in its worldly way similarly ìtogetherî by sharing one common language, one common alphabet, one common religious belief system after the worldwide inundation [Gen 11:1] of circa 28,000 BC. Even then, however, dialects soon emerged by tribal and regional congregation, segregation, and integration of their expanding population centers. Babel means ìconfusion by mixingî, hence Babylonian means ìchildren of confusion by mixingî. In their vain imagina- tions they were trying to mix worldly things with heavenly things. This is the post-deluvian resurrection of arrogance and infidelity, which as youíll recall wrought the eventual destruction of antediluvian civilizations all around the preflooded world. Return now to the fall of Adam & Eve in the Garden of Eden, and the consequential sea- sonal fall of luni-solar tropical Autumn & Evening. The Earth-Moon system destabilized, with the Earthís rotational axis tilting some 23.5 degrees. The once 360 solar day per sidereal year"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Minís Concise Commentary 116 orbit of Earth became 365.25 some-odd days per sidereal year against 365.24 days per tropi- cal year, due to the tilt of the Earthís daily rotation. The Moonís once stable and concentric 30 solar day per month orbit began to undulate in compensation with the head and tail of the Dragon, which are North Node & Lilith, respectivelyÖserpentine orbital intercepts of the Moonís continued reaction to the now partially destabilized Earth, with Moonís orbit becom- ing somewhat eccentric and inclined to the Earth-Sun ecliptic, such that the maxima and min- ima of declination sees the Moon oscillate above and below the ecliptic by up to 5.15 degrees. Thus, wherever the Moon is, the great circle of its light-apparent geocentric orbit intersects the ecliptic at its lunar nodes, ergo north-south. The computation of this north node or ìheadî of the dragon differs by up to ± 20 arcmin- utes between mean, true-mean, and true-true intersections of the mean-vs-momentary orbit of the Moon and the Sunóapparent to the Earthís geocenter. The south node is merely opposite northÖthatís all it is. Fortunately, Lilith, even though somewhat more complicated to explain, is always within 5 degrees of its mean average, since its mean value uses the Earth-Moon bary- center, while its ìtrueî value would technically refer Earthís geocenter as the first focus of the ìellipseî of the lunar orbitóas the Sunís tremendous gravity tugs on the Earth-Moon system at all times. Thus Lilith, the ìtailî of the dragon, is no more difficult to ascertain than is the ìheadî of the same. Never confuse the south node with the ìtailî of the Dragon, as only Lilith shows lunar apogee or its empty focal point. As man has dominion over the Earth, the Adamic fall caused the instability of Earth and the Moonís orbital undulation in response. Since then, the Moon has varied in geocentric dis- tance by down to about 221,000 miles at perigee, and up to about 253,000 miles at apogee for a difference of up to 50,000 miles while Earth is in proximity to perihelion, or aphelion, and either are most nearly coincident with a new or full Moon. So not only did Earthís once per- petual, year-round season break from her sidereal year when her axis of rotation tipped some 23 degrees, but the Moonís orbit also inclined by more than 5 degrees, slowly gyrating along her geocentrically-observed orbit with Earth, causing the Moon itself to appear to Earth- bound astronomers on the surface, ergo topocentric observers, to notice slight librations in the light-apparent lunar disc, such that almost 60% of the Moonís surface can be observed over time between maximum & minimum distances, as the Moon ìnodsî slightly up-left and down-right respectively. Even this ìup-downî motion wasnít observable before the fall of man, and ìleft-rightî motion was less appreciable since the Moonís orbit was less eccen- tric, but was still tidally-locked to Earth, so the Moonís monthly rotation toward Earth would appear to ìjump aheadî or ìlag behindî its then more nearly elliptical orbit with Earth, revealing a tiny sliver of the lunar surface on the left, then right, around apogee, and perigee, respectively. By comparing Earthís constant stability before the fall to Earthís subsequent instability thereafter highlights where man has fallen from. Man fell, and the Earth fell with him. Through Christ, man is redeemed to God from the deadóthus the Earth must again become"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 117 stable and firm. This is basic to understanding the Revelation, to remember from where we are fallen, when man ruled over the whole Earth in concert with the Gods who made it all. We were sons of the Gods at that time, before the fall, and for many millions of years. By knowing where we are fallen from, we can then know what to expect in the restabilized ìnewî heaven and ìnewî earth. Cayce gave many 100s of readings related to the Xian bible, particularly about creation and the creative forces or God, and always in reference to the King James AVóa book Cayce had read many times over. Hence the readings are rife with ye olí kingís English ìthine ownî, ìthou shaltî, ìthou artî etc. and interspersed with oft-redundant homilies. However, as one searches through the vast psychic readings database, instructional question-and-answer excerpts emerge as cream rises to the top of a container of fresh milk. And because of Cayceís consis- tent usage of a variety of biblical terms in combination with his helpful metaphysical disserta- tions, it doesnít take long for the astute reader to ìconnect the dotsî so to speak, to recognize the patterns and common de- nominators present through- out the readings. Those who have devoted many years to studying the Cayce readings data- base have also found sometimes subtle but more rarely overt conflicts between various read- ings. When asked about such conflicting or most often misconstrued statements in readings, Cayce said it depended on the source(s) and was influenced by those who were posing the question, and the unconscious-superconscious connection made with his patients. He might reiterate his answers and re-explain them from a different vantage point either in the same reading, through a series of readings, or across completely separate readings spread out over decades. The more common the theme, then the more common and consistent his answers became. Under the Report section following reading 0278-001, item 2 quotes a letter of reply that Cayce himself wrote regarding the veracity & reliability of the readings in general, from which I quote: ìOf course, there is no charge whatever for my part in this*Ö We have had information concerning the source. Under separate cover I am sending to you a little pamphlet that has been compiled by the office, on how a reading is obtained. This may help you to understand our experiences in this field. Per- sonally, I believe this: Life itself is an essence or manifestation of the divine Intelligence, or Force, that we call God. When there is incoordination between the mental, the physical and the spiri- tual body (which are One, represented by the Trinity - the Fa- ther, the Son and the Holy Spirit, in the spiritual world), we have what we call dis-ease. This may grow into real disease. Our medical science has classified these into different names, because they affect different portions of the body. Now, any"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Minís Concise Commentary 118 healing that may possibly come must be a re-coordinating of that physical being to that triune of force manifesting in our bodies. So, all healing must come from God. Whether the intel- ligence that brings that consciousness is from a drug, a me- chanical appliance, the foods we eat, or what not, it is in its es- sence one and the same source. For the readings to be a channel through which such information may come as to assist an indi- vidual in understanding what would produce coordination in the individual body, is saying that it must come from a UNIVER- SAL source - then, if it is not from such a source, it is just as apt to be detrimental as it is good. So, letís hope this is from the uni- versal or One source. I believe it to be.î [end quote; *Minís note: Cayce was not a selfish man] The keyword here is ìuniversalî. The many psychic readings that Cayce gave on judicial as- trology for example, seem to share this same universal source, which we know to be true. Any intermediary source channeling the universal source is probably reliable. The better that the question was worded, the better was the answer given. Consider the four Gospels from differ- ent sources and various witnesses, yet they are for the best part remarkably consistent in their testimony. And in those few places where odd discrepancies appear, it is almost always attrib- utable to the disbelief of skeptics. When asked about who wrote the four Gospels, Cayce re- plied: ì. . . .MARK was first dictated, greatly by Peter; and this in those periods just before Peter was carried to Rome. The next was MATTHEW, written by the one whose name it bears - AS for the SPECIFIC reasons - to those who were scattered into the upper portions of Palestine and through Laodicea. This was written something like thirty-three to four years later than MARK; and while this body - that wrote same - was in exile. LUKE was written by Lucius, rather than Luke; though a com- panion with Luke during those activities of Paul; and written, of course, unto those of the faith under the Roman INFLUENCE - not to the Roman peoples but to the provinces ruled BY the Ro- mans! and it was from those sources that the very changes were made, as to the differences in that given by MARK and MAT- THEW. JOHN was written by several; not by the John who was the beloved, but the John who REPRESENTED or who was the scribe FOR John the beloved; and - as much of same - was writ-"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 119 ten much later. Portions of it were written at different times and combined some fifty years after the Crucifixion.î [end quote from reading 1598-002#19] We know that Christ was crucified Wednesday 25 April 31 AD from about 9 AM to 3 PM LAT just outside the Damascus gate on the north-west perimeter of old Jerusalem. Notably John ìbelovedÖwas sent to Patmos as an old manî [1523-016#28], so the compilation of his gospel mustíve occurred circa 81 AD, or about 15 years before he returned from exile to his home in Ephesus. With so many great Cayce readings to cite regarding the Revelation and its zealous author whoíd been the most beloved disciple of Jesus, and was primary author of the gospel According to John (as recorded by his scribe) and was the sole author of his Epistles and his Revelation, selecting only brief excerpts from a few dozen readings is necessary to keep this commentary ìconciseî like the title reads. Before continuing Iíll quote just two more excerpts in this chapter, although Iíd like to quote two dozen more: ì(Q) Were the thought forms that were able to push themselves out of themselves inhabited by souls, or were they of the animal kingdom? (A) That as created by that CREATED, of the animal kingdom. That created as by the Creator, with the soul.î [end quote from reading 0364-007#5] ì(Q) At the change called death is the entity free of a physical or material body?

As may be seen by a study of the information which has been given through these sources as to the various appearances of an indi- vidual soul-entity in the earth, sometimes the body is six foot two, again four foot five; sometimes fair of hair, sometimes of very dark complexion.

Such universal wisdom is pervasive throughout the readings. By recognizing the universal framework within which bodies, souls & minds operate both in harmony and disharmony, each to its own benefit and detriment, this framework forms the ìteethî of biblical astrology, actualization of thought by the elements, the ìdust of the earthî in this solar system from which man is made in this spiral arm of the Milky Way. Now while in Patmos, John writes that he came to be in the spirit (Gk. \u0002\f\u000e\u0006\u0010\u0001 , to breathe) in the Lordís, or dominant, day (Gk. \u0004\u0006\r\b\u0001\u0004\u0003\t , related or belonging to the Lord). This is by Xian tradition believed to be the day of the Sun, or first day of the week, i.e. the day of Jesusí resurrection commencing after sunset that prior evening.

While oth- ers have opted for either Saturnís day (Saturday, sanctified day of rest) or Sunís day (Sunday, the day of light & first cause), the day of Zeus is also in keeping with the Revelation context which is given to Jesus Christ by Zeus, ìthe Dominant oneî wholly in the spirit of giving and sharing. But whether or not his revelation to John occurred over the course of one day or one week is not known. And if it was all in one day, which day of the week isnít known either, but probably the Sunís day (Apollo) is the best candidate. And donít forget, each successive day of the seven-day week is plainly named for its planet or vessel of God by sidereal orbital fifths, Sun-D, Moon-A, Mars-E, Mercury-B, Jupiter-F, Venus-C, & Saturn-G; Dorian, Aeolian, Phry- gian, Locrian, Lydian, Ionian, Mixolydian respectively, as described in my previous books. The importance of the number seven is clearly inclusive of all seven sidereal modalities of creating, sustaining, and destroying through the twelve synodic colors, tones, directions, the actualizations of body, thought and will in the elemental courtyards of corporeal experience. Cayce called this a ìpattern - of the whole universeî [5755-001#7]. The whole science of cos- mology is predicated on universal laws of physics to the limit that such laws are realized by man. No more readily is the fundamental law of seven and twelve demonstrated than on the pi- ano keyboard. As seven diatonic modalities ascend (rushing forth) then descend (returning), they are each transposed through the twelve chromatic keys within the octave. Each of the seven diatonic modes is com- posed of the same seven white keys, but only the center or order begins or ends that ascending or descending mode respectively. The balance and completion of the twelve phases, or signs, or gateways of a soulís physical incarnations on Earth, thatís like the completion of the seven modes transposing through the twelve tones within the octave of sound, which tones and octaves repeat beyond the audible spectrum for humans from the deepest earthquakes to above whatís audible to any lifeform known to man. The seven centers tend to form nodes across the whole spectrum of life, vibrating in all directions, dimensions, and frequencies. The colors of the narrow octave of visible light behave much the same, hav- ing seven primaries (ROYGBIV), & twelve chromatic tones (with five secondaries by mixing R/O, O/Y, G/B, B/I & I/V). Infrared is just one octave below violet while ultraviolet is just one octave above red. But every octave has its own special properties across the electromagnetic spectrum, as each octave on the keyboard imparts its own unique quality, its own affinity to the tones, octaves, and modes of music. That which sympathizes with this music is thereby affected. There is natural resonance and dissonance between signs or tones in the spectrum of sound, and color for example, particularly for tones within the same or adjacent octave de- pending on the distance between them. The further away that two or more tones are from each other, and the further the octaves are apart along the electromagnetic spectrum, then the"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Minís Concise Commentary 122 fainter, the less sympathetic said resonance and dissonance becomes. How each tone plus how each interval, triad, chord, octave etc. interacts with humans and their environment deter- mines its effect. Consider the experience of sun- bathing on a clear summer day. The full spec- tra of visible light is clear to see. Infrared light, though we canít see it, we can feel its warmth. Ultraviolet lightóalso invisible to humansóturns overexposed skin red (and even purple on very dark-skinned humans) and is felt burning the areas thus afflicted, particularly by those with very light skin. Similarly, each octave of vibration affects any parts of a mans body and his environment which are sensitive or sympathetic to those vibrational frequenciesóxrays, gamma rays, cos- mic rays, ad infinitum. The body, the mind and the will, each is either directly else indirectly affected by forces sympathetic to a human being and that personís environment. E.g. when youíre being closely watched by someone at close range, somehow we get the feeling like weíre being watched. We turn instinctually, to see whomever it is staring at us. We get an inkling, a feeling, a subtle yet motive force in our body, mind, and soul, and we react to it. We are sensi- tive to those vibrations which affect those parts of human experience tasting sweetness and bitterness. Between sweet and bitter, what else lies between them? Itís combinations of tones, colors, tastes, odours, feelings, signals of all human sensation which combine together into physical human experience. The octaves are exponentially augmented across the eighty-four key signatures of mind, and will, and what occurs among and between this trinity is our actu- alization. The virtuoso concert pianist must practice the scales just like any other consummate musi- cian, to maintain his or her command over their instrument & give a command performance when the time comes. Anyone who is really good at anything must develop and practice their craft for many years to become proficient at it. Mastery is attained when will, mind and body can perform in concert well enough to be heard or seen as a ìmasterî by the discriminating audience. Similarly, every individual person is essentially practicing life around the clock, from birth to death. Mans performing art of living tends to improve and evolve with practice, while the body grows from infancy into adulthood, and soul grows ever-older and wiser through its sojourns and incarnations. To paraphrase a Cayce reading [1770-002#78], the ìold soulî or ìyoung soulî isnít about chronological age but is about how soul applies itself toward or away from divine purpose over the ages. 5748-006#3 says that a ìchange in the racesî begins with a ìgreater influx of soulsî from civilizations of forgotten antiquity. Cayce says ìthe second star in the great dip- per..indicates the system toward which soul takes flightî, once its duty in our solar system is accomplished. Cayce says the change corresponds with a noticeable change in the great pyra- midís descending passageís orientation to the stars by a major shift in the Earthís axis, since this passage points toward the terrestrial-celestial north pole, and will continue to do so after the change. Therefore any crustal displacement wouldnít deviate this 12,500 year-old proph-"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 123 ecy set in stone from its geo-polar orientation. This means the al-Gizeh plateau must maintain the same latitude near 30 degrees north (Great Pyramid is presently 29N58:51) in order for the new ìnorth polar starî to be visible from the subterranean floor of the pyramidís descend- ing passage:  However, what Cayce meant by ìthe great dipperî is unclear. Thuban (alDra) is the caeles- tial ìtail of the dragonî, and its ìsecond starî by magnitude is the ìhead of the dragonî, Rasta- ban (beDra). Our present-day ìpole starî is the brightest star (alUMi) in the ìlittle bearîÖîgreatî it is not, neither is it the little bearís second brightest star.

The brightest star in the ìbelly of the dragonî is Altais (deDra) about 83 degrees north of the ecliptic (+82:53í31î) but is Dracoís fourth star.

At present the t-c pole is near 3∞ 01í 26î above the upper limit of the passage window (accounting for parallax) so that any caeles- tial light below 86∞ 58í 34î declination down to 85∞ 40í 04î will be visible from the passage"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 125 floor. If this prophesied ìearth-changeî should shift the pyramid northward by several degrees, then the pole (CNP) would be visible through the shaft of the descending passage albeit any nearby star may or may not be, depending on the starís declination thereto. Cayce indicates that itíll be visible. There are other significant shafts in the pyramid, such as the two leading from the Kingís chamber, more particularly the shaft pointing northward and inclined at about 32∞ 28í. Since the descending passage is inclined 26∞ 18í, then the north shaft from the Kingís chamber is some 6∞ 10í steeper, and our calculations are adjusted accordingly, meaning the pyramid must shift by over 9 degrees northward in order to align the north shaft toward the ìCNPî as we know it today. The southern shaft of this Kingís chamber rises at 45∞ 00í. The Queenís cham- ber also has two shaftsÖneither of which are open all the way to the outside. Its northern shaft is inclined at 39∞ 00í, and Cayceís ìimaginary linesî give us pause to consider this. The southern shaft is the steepest of all at 39∞ 30í. Of these, the north shaft of the Kingís chamber is probably the best candidate considering Cayceís statement in 5748-006#3 (see above) that ìthese conditions are indicated in this turn in the journey through the pyramidî. Whatís really important is the pyramidís position relative to the Earth axis of rotation, so the north & south shafts remain geographically oriented toward the poles. As a function of polar orientation, it is also important that Earthís axis shift more perpendicular to her ecliptic with the Sun since this will restabilize the Earth to the stars, and thus determine which star(s) will align with the shaft. Because of the real potential for crustal displacement, it is impractical to compute which star(s) will be so aligned. The closer they are to the Catís Eye Nebula (89:51í north), then the more apt those stars are to align with this shaft over the long term, obliquity and precession having abated. The Bible is replete with references to angels and spirits. Ancient catacombs ìad catacum- basî outside Rome for example, are painted with symbols of the astrological Gods together with Judeo-Xian symbols and themes. Many composite frescos still adorn underground walls and ceilingsósome down four storeys deepóalong the Appian Way. Depictions of menorahs, good shepards, angels etc., are perfectly at home with the classical Greco-Roman symbols of the zodiac of the planets. Anthropomorphic renderings of Jupiter and other major Gods of our solar system appear side-by-side with Greek inscriptions ì \u0011\u0012 \u0013\u0014 \u0015 î, which is the acronym for IESOVS CHRISTOS THEOV YIOS SOTER, Jesus Christ of God the Son our Savior, with the ìtwo fishesî of Pisces always nearby. Egypto-Babylonian influences are everywhere (Horus, Mithras, et al) albeit the secular/religious orthodoxy took a dim view of combining astro & xian symbologies once the dark ages came alongóa dim view which lingers to this day. But we are not concerned here with the dim views of dim wits. The reality is, Xianity and Astrol- ogy are one. Carefully consider what is an ìangelî.

The seven stars are the radiant consciousnesses of the planets singing together in harmony, each centered on its own diatonic sidereal modality according to its sidereal order, and each of the seven stars are inclusive of the other six in order.

It termi- nated in seven heads, in one row, all standing parallel to one another; and these branches carried seven lampsÖ .î [Antiq. IIIvi6-7] In the tabernacle, these seven lamps were lit each evening and extinguished each morning by temple priests serving in their week-long 8-day overlapping course of temple service. All seven remained lit all night longóevery single day of the year. New oil and wicks were replen- ished each day. The ìpatternî of heavenly things [Exo 25:9; Heb 8:5] was known as just that, symbolic of the heavens, but not the heavens themselves. The togetherness of the seven lights was known to symbolize the choir of the Gods, like the Muses singing, seven lights, one tem- ple. Even the temple was known to symbolize the temple of the body [John 2:19ff], thus the body or \u000e\u0004\u0004\u0005\u000e\u0007\b\u0001 of Christ is symbolized by this temple menorah, with seven centers of the body ergo seven churches in Asia, each with the seven stars (of divine consciousness) within every member or true believer in the resurrection of Jesus.

So we have Jesusí own angel or light-body ad- dressing each believerís own angel (within) who are living in the seven population centers of proconsular Asia. Tiny enclaves of Xians would gather together for study and worship wher- ever they could. As with most all residents in the region, these early Xians were exceedingly well-versed in Greco-Roman astrology & mythology, and their meaning in life, death and the afterlife. This made Jesusí Revelation as witnessed by his apostle John, & given entirely by Zeus, much easier to read than it was for modern-day generations. The Tarot helps tremendously to reacquaint latterday Xians with angels and archangels, and their astro- mytho-logical essence and attributes, their spiritual ìmeets and boundsî. Thus Iíll quote Cayce from a reading dated January 3, 1925: ì(Q) Ö gods have granted him, or brought him to that point where he may attain knowledge. What is meant by gods? (A) In this manner and form are gods meant here: In the at- taining of development, through the mental, the soul forces, in the earthís plane, there has been set bounds about every force as manifested in the material, the mental, the soul, the spiritual planes. These bounds are the gods, or guards, of such attain- ment, and conditionsÖ î ì(Q) It has been given that the soul is the spiritual force that animates or gives life to the body. What is spirit? What is spiri- tual force? Is it corporeal or in- corporeal? Where may we find the soul force in the body - in the brain, nerve centers or where? (A) There is a vast deal of difference between spiritual and soul forces, for, as given, each force there has been set guards or bounds. Spirit forces are the animation of ALL LIFE giving life- producing forces in animate or inanimate forces. Spiritual ele- ments become corporeal when we speak of the spiritual body in a spiritual entity; then composed of spirit, soul and the super- consciousness. In the soul forces, and its dwelling in man, we find the anima- tion, the spiritual element, the soul that developing element, and contained in the brain, in the nerve, in the centers of the whole system. As to the specific centers, nearer those centers of the sensory system, physically speaking. In the conditions, then, we"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Minís Concise Commentary 130 find when soul and spirit take flight from the animate forces of an human, we find the deadening of all the centers of the sen- sory system, with the vitality of the solar plexus system, with the gland of the medulla oblongata, these then controlling the forces, and the life becomes extinct, with soul and spirit, with the super-conscious forces, gone. Then, we have as this: Spiritual element, the vitality, produces the motive forces of the entity, whether physical or spiritual. Spiritual forces being the life, the reproductive principle; the soul the development princi- ple. As we have manifested, or illustrated, in the physical body in nerve tissue: There becomes that principle of the nerve action and the nerve in action. That is, with the expression of some condition bringing distress in the body, the active principle is the spirit. The nerve is the soul, for development. (Q) What happens to the conscious mind forces and physical forces at death? (A) The conscious mind forces either are in the soulís develop- ment, and in the superconsciousness, or left with that portion of material forces which goes to the reclaiming, or remoulding, of physical bodies, for indwelling of spiritual entities. (Q) Explain universal forces. Are they forces - (A) (Mr. Cayce, breaking in:) In this, we find that great in- dwelling of that force as is given in the bounds about all devel- opment, whether mental, soul, or spiritual conditions; the uni- versal being that element through which all becomes manifest in a material world, or a spiritual world. As would be illustrated in the prism separating the elements of light, and showing the active principle of given light or heat in its action, by deflection from the given law, the universal forces are as such. These, we see, become manifest in the material world as the mentality of man develops and gains the knowledge of the laws of the uni- verse, and as man in his mentality gains the knowledge of that law, the de- flections become the manifestations of universal laws, and force, manifested through the material world. All such laws, as man develops, will come to the use and benefit of man, there being many illustrations in the present age."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 131 The greater we find in the life of Jesus, who only used the uni- versal law, and in the deflection of same, through the life lived, made same manifest in the world, in the last overcoming even the disintegration of the spirit and soul from the physical or corporeal body, and able to force all law to become subjugated to the body, or, as we see, manifest in the electrical forces as used by man. This becoming only an atom in motion, and as the atomic force gathers this, producing such vibration as to create heat, light, and of the various natures, by the kind, class or na- ture of resistance met in its passage in the cycle given, reducing, or raising the velocity, or better by the class of atomic force it vibrates, either with or against. These are ensamples of portions of universal forces. [end quote from Cayce reading 0900-017.html#3,5-7] Thus within our solar system, the universal archetypes, as delineated, illustrated and sym- bolized in the major arcana, are confirmed by the planets in their sidereal and synodic orbits through the active agency of spirit, soul, and embodiment of humankindís individual and col- lective experience. The ìdeflectionsî of various wavelengths and amplitudes of energy testify to the framework of boundaries within which said energies function. Man gains knowledge of the law via ex- perienceópracticeóin his habitat. Man learns to expect certain behavior of these manifesting forces in certain environments. E.g. we expect water to freeze in temperatures below 32 de- grees fahrenheit, and to boil above 212 degrees at sealevel. We expect fire to burn flammable objects. The certainty of gravity, ìwhat goes up must come downî. Every natural & supernatu- ral law earns its merit through repeatability and verification, through controlled experiment and practical experience. We say ìlaw of karmaî, or ìwhat goes around comes aroundî. This is because we know in our heart of hearts that the universal law will hold man accountable for his every thought, word and deed. We say ìlaw of graceî because we know that Godís love is the most powerful force in the universe. We say ìin the spirit of the lawî because we have gained such wisdom through long-ages of experience. We have learned that humility is better that egocentricity, charityís better than greed and honesty is the best policy. But weíve also learned ìdo as I say not as I doî, ìactions speak louder than wordsî & ìthe road to hell is paved with good intentionsîówe all know that Jesus loathes hypocrisy! The best part is that knowledge knows no bounds, no limits beyond that which it presently knows. The great surrealist painter Salvador Dali used to say ìyou donít know what you donít knowî.

The confidence we place in the universal law has increased with mans evolution, particu- larly on the unconscious level. Things that are most familiar to us, the things we tend to take for granted. Basically, everything that a human being stands to lose at the moment of his or her demise. What we generally grow accustomed to in life awaits us in our next incarnation. Simi- larlyóyet by stark contrastódisembodied souls are superconsciously familiar with their so- journs in the heavenly realms. The imperative result, the war of ten sidereal years (i.e. ìa thou- sand yearsî due to Venusí 1871 sidereal orbits /per 720 synodic orbits /per 1151 tropical years for Venusí grand sidereal-synodic-tropical multiple), describes our long-standing conflict be- tween soul and body. This profound conflagration is fought between Zeus and his angels against Kronos and his angels. More on this laterÖ The direct association of the seven ecclesiae in Asia with the seven double-lettered (i.e. su- perior and inferior) planets is obvious by the symbology of the seven-branched candelabraó one for each ecclesiae. The seven angels or planetary Gods are symbolized by the seven flames common to all seven candlesticks. Ephesus is commonly associated in with the Moon i.e. all seven planets in the first Aeolian order. The first of the seven branches on the Ephesian cande- labra is symbolic of the Moon, and its flame symbolic of that divine consciousness, heavenly dimension or ìplaneî as it is called in eastern mysticism. Call it whatever you like, as the Moon is still the same Moon and its plane of consciousness is still the same plane of con- sciousness by any other name. The anthropomorphous ìangelsî of the seven planetary Gods look upon us humans in much the same way, since humankind was created by the Gods in our own image, and our own likeness. So angels and humans are anthropomorphizing each other, so to speak. That angels would appear as ìa manî to humans is acknowledged in the first chapter of Genesis and throughout the Bible, seeing that ìAngelsî and ìGodsî mean the same thing. Itís no wonder then that ancients depicted the Gods & Angels as having human or even super-human form. The angel of Jesus walksólivesóin the midst of the seven double-lettered ecclesiae. This is our first love or place in the midst of paradise from where we are fallen. Phrases like ìJesus is risen!î suddenly gain a greater meaning. He is risen not only from the dead, but also he is risen from the Adamic fall. As descendants of the Adamic fall, we are to rise from the dead and the Adamic fall in Christ. These are the most fundamental tenets of Xianity that we do this by election, practice and participationóergo we must ìact in penitence and the first works doî, so says Jesusí angel. The spirit, the ìbreath of the divineî (cf. spiritu sancto also translated ìholy ghostî), tells us ìto the conquering I will give to him to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of the Gods of meî.

These four are directly associated with their planetary ensigns, lion (Sun), eagle (Jupiter), ox (Saturn), and man (Mars). In chapter 4 weíll examine the mythos of these ìfour animalsî more thoroughly. The seven seven-branched candlesticks listed symbolize all seven double-lettered planets each. Same seven planets and same seven-branched 100-pound golden candlestick per angel of each ecclesia, identified according to the order of its sidereal-diatonic modality, emphasizing their togetherness. Their ordering is important since this symbolizes the same seven planets through each of the seven sidereal modes, or muses. Meaning one mode per angel, with each mode composed of all seven angels according to their sidereal order. The choir of seven angels singing in the Ephesian modality are singing in the Aeolian mode beginning at the Moon. Each of the next six angels are all part of same Aeolian choir but only their order is shifted from angel to angel.

Cayce reading 2533-007#32 reads: ìÖ Behold the face of the angels ever stands before the throne of God; the awareness in self that thou may be one with, equal with, the Father-God, as His child, as the brother of the Christ, thy Savior, thy Brother. And as the awareness comes, it is as the angel of hope, the angel of announcing, the angel of declaiming, the angel that would warn, the angel that would protect. For, these are ever as awarenesses, as consciousnesses of the abiding presence of that ìHe hath given his angels charge concerning thee.î"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Minís Concise Commentary 136 So you see, itís really one great angel, one great body of Christ, who has seven sidereal boundaries of consciousness. Each boundary, each God, each angel, each plane, dimension, attunement, attainment etc, each of the seven vast regions of consciousness in the diatonic scales of life is a place for our awareness to develop, via its mode among the seven. The classical Greek mythology of the planets, particularly as recounted in Hesiodís Theog- ony, springs to life in soul-consciousness, the psyche of man. Hence psychology becomes a close parallel with astrology. The distinct powers & per- sonalities of the Gods are well-known to man, if only on a subconscious level for the gentile masses. Dreams bring us closer to this occult awareness of superconscious entities, as Cayce calls the ìcreative forcesî in whose image we are and were created. Each of the Gods commands fabulous power and principality, such that awakening any one of them from slumber i.e. within ourselves is to rouse a sleeping giant! And like the Earthís vast oceans, the other Gods will seek the same ìsealevelî of supercon- scious arousal. Hindus have known this for many thousands of years, and have developed whole religions devoted to arousing the centers or chakras in the body, particularly those of the cerebrospinal nerve centers. Cayce gave plenty of readings on this subject and this excerpt from reading 1861-004#25 is exemplary of this: ì(Q) How may I bring into activity my pineal and pituitary glands, as well as the Kundalini and other chakras, that I may attain to higher mental and spiritual powers? Are there exer- cises for this purpose, and if there are, please give them. (A) As indicated, first so FILL the mind with the ideal that it may vibrate throughout the whole of the MENTAL being! Then, close the desires of the fleshly self to conditions about same. MEDITATE upon ëTHY WILL WITH ME.í Feel same. Fill ALL the centers of the body, from the lowest to the highest, with that ideal; opening the centers by surrounding self first with that consciousness, ìNOT MY WILL BUT THINE, O LORD, BE DONE IN AND THROUGH ME.î And then, have that desire, that purpose, not of attaining without HIS direction, but WITH His direction, - who is the Maker, the Giver of life and light; as it is indeed in Him that we live and move and have our being.î This is the heart of astrological-psychological meditation or Xian prayer in its pristine glory. The will seeks to be always giving to and helping others in need. This help can be in physical necessities like food, shelter and clothing, or helpful instructions, advice, admonishments, rebuke and chastisement ONLY where it is warranted and appropriate to the degree befitting the offense.

We cannot be giving to others what we are loathe to take upon ourselves. We canít warn others to repent from things we do ourselves. Jesus warned repeatedly against hypocrisy. Self-discipline is conducive to well-being and helps us to serve others in need. Thus ones intent to help others is only deception if it isnít put into actual practice. Thatís the great danger of meditation or prayer, that being complacency or dereliction of duty. Better not to meditate at all, than it is to neglect our daily obligation to put ones illumination into practice. Mere purpose isnít enough. Action speaks volumes in the book of life. We are judged by our works, even more than by our intent. Where research and implementation come together in actualization, then we are truly doing our job. The Nicolaitans were a sect of libertines feigning Xianity. In the original sense of idolatry, the idolater is one who adores the archetypal or mundane image and likeness of the Gods more than the One above all. The ten commandments are wholly unambiguous about this. Iíve translated these from the Latin Vulgate in my 4th book ìMinís Planetary Awareness Tech- niqueî on this URL: http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=OYJC9TOU37947.1559259259@Gilgamesh-frog.org The first three commandments appear translated verbatim hereinbelow: 1) ìWe speak likewise is God altogether the Gods this. Myself to be the God Zeus of you who brought up yourself from the land Egyptian, away from the house of servitude. Not you shall have gods alien in the presence of me. 2) ìNot shall you make of you sculpture nor any kind of simili- tude to what is in heaven above or which is in the earth below neither anything which exists in the water under the earth. Not you shall worship them nor tend to them. Myself to be the God Zeus of you. With my power I do jealously visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth genera- tion of them who hate me.

Hermes, Mercury is the archetypal angel or anthropomorphic God of the Smyrnan ecclesia. The Judaists are those who devoutly observe ancient orthodox Hebraism or Mosaic Judaism. Many early Xians were also descendants of Abraham, such as the Parthian Magoi who visited baby Jesusócertainly among the first Xians. Recognizing Jesus Christís fulfillment of the Law, Prophets, & Writings (acronym TaNaKh, a.k.a. ìold testamentî) is to recognize the completion of the Bible in the new testament. I.e., that both old & new testament are all part of the one good book, the literal word of God. In those days there were many Judaists, Greeks & Romans alike who embraced and studied the scriptures and believed Godís word, and demonstrated their belief by the words & actions. But among those Judaists there were also many sedition- ists, those who sought to divide the one word of God into TaNaKh vs. Xians, accusing the lat- ter of undermining common faith in the God of Abraham. This religious schism between Xians, which includes both Jew & Gentile alike, vs. old testament anti-Xian Judaists has been perpetuated two thousand years and counting. Many modern-day Xians are likewise guilty of sedition, since theyíve rejected the law of Moses in favor of their doctrine of ìfaith-without- worksî salvation. This only goes to show you that ìtwo wrongs donít make a rightî, as is a common theme throughout the new testament, talking about how both Jews and non-Jews are guilty of many wrongs. Thus the Judaists of first-century proconsular Asia should have been living exemplary lives towards the pattern lived by the one great king of the Jews. Many did not, and it is to them which the angelóGodóof Jesus was alluding. Great respect for Jesusí devout Judaism was paramount in the early church. Thatís why Xianity is more properly referred to as ìJudeo- Xianityî since Jesus is not only the great Rabbi but he is king of the rabbis, king of priests, king of all. Those who reject his reign are called ìsynagogue of Satanî. One neednít be a Jew to fit into that category! Rather anyone who is not willing that Jesus Christ should reign over them is a willing congregant therein [Luke 19:27]. So when we read the passage of Revelation 2:9 & 3:9, be aware that any person no matter what his or her race, creed and color, theyíre always welcome to join with Satanís grand assembly. Remember, the ìten days tribulationî refers to us ìGods in Timeî. Seven days for the seven double-ensign planets plus three days for the octaves of the Moon, Mercury, and Venus, which are Uranus, Neptune, & Pluto respectively. The ìdaysî are the ephemeris or ìday-bookî of the Gods. Remember also that the Sun, Mars, Jupiter & Saturn have their respective places in the four cardinal elements, exalting in the four cardinal directions. Iíve thoroughly covered this and related topics in previous work. The emphasis here is that the exaltation of planets is a function of their rulerships in the terrestrial horoscope which is adjudicated by the same, i.e., by the predominant rulerships exerted by the planets from their positions to the Earth. Their"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 139 exaltations arise when a planet isnít ruling but is exalted by the planet(s) who rules over that terrestrial courtyard. I.e. exaltation is more an effect, and less a cause of horoscopic adjudica- tion. These ten days are as ten thousand years in prophecy, many trials and tribulations, many adventures to come. The patience of God is a divine virtue, the courtyard of Virgo, the High Priestess ruled by Mercury-superior in the zodiac. The faithful who are crowned with life donít suffer the second death, i.e., being cut off and cast down to perdition from heaven. These are not vulnerable to sickness or death amply, nei- ther hunger nor thirst amply. How this can be is beyond mortal understanding. We do know that with God, all things are possible and thereíre a plethora of things that exist in reality that we donít fully understandóand there are many very real things that we do not understand at all yet we experience them first-hand. What Jesus says will be, you can take it to the bankÖitíll assuredly come to pass. It may not happen in your mundane lifetime, but itíll even- tually occur. The certainty of Jesusí word is as Godís own word, being one in the same. Just the act of him saying it is enough to make it so [Ge 1:3,6,9,11,14; Lu 7:6-9; ibid]. Next, the God of the Pergamum ecclesia is Zeus, or Jupiter, whose Lydian muse begins the sixth sidereal order. Realize all seven modes are common to all seven ecclesia, only the sidereal order of the seven angels is increased by one for each consecutive church. Why theyíre listed in a different order is unclear. In strictly sidereal order theyíd be listed 1 Ephesus, 2 Smyrna, 3 Philadelphia, 4 Sardis 5 Thyatira, 6 Pergamum, & 7 Laodicea. Jupiterís attribution of the long double-edged spear (eg. archaeologists have unearthed many coins depicting Zeus holding a spear, & double-headed axe, in Milas, ancient Mylasa and former capital of Caria) is for the Sagittarian, the hunter of fortune, hence Wheel of Fortune archetype in tarot. Here we are dwelling in the seat of Satan among his angels and we are fighting against Zeus and his angelic army in the war of ten sidereal years, the great battle of Armageddon. The indignities & dis- honor we bring to the temple of Zeus defiles his good name. Thus weíre told to *act* in peni- tence else weíll be defeated by Zeus & his angels in the grand conflagration of the heaven, and consigned to the pit of perdition for a thousand years, where we are dwelling. The ìhidden mannaî is of course the bread of life in the Eucharist, the sacred rite, bread and wine which are taken symbolic of the body & blood of Jesus. The manna is not the bread or wine, but what it symbolizes. It is Zeus, meaning God gives, the gift which God gives to us from the ex- panse of heaven which Zeus rulesóthe giving nature of God. The ìwhite pebbleî is of course symbolic of Pluto, the developing center of the Earth, the ìeye of the skyî. Weíll talk plenty more about Pluto in later chapters. Next is to the God of the Thyatiran ecclesia, Mars. Beyond the good things that are ac- knowledged, his altruistic love, loyalty, ministering, patience and progress, Mars is being ve- hemently warned against activities involving promiscuous, adulterous, and otherwise unprin- cipled womenóparticularly against having sex or having children out of wedlock. This warn- ing is probably not so severe concerning a man & woman who have fallen in love and are nur-"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Minís Concise Commentary 140 turing a meaningful and monogamous relationship. Those who have such relationships often redeem themselves by getting married and having a family. Like Marsí famous symbol of an erect, blood-engorged penis topped by an arrow pointing outward, the natural and divine purpose of the male sex organ is procreation with a woman. When the man & woman are truly in love, they surely are blessed by God, and hopefully their love will find its way to mar- riage and a loving family. The power of love can overcome all obstacles, even in death. Perhaps the greater sin of the unfaithful and lecherous man and woman is their reckless abandon of love and loyalty for gluttonous carnal pleasures. Such people are in serious danger of Godís judgment, which Jerome forebodingly translates as ìtribulation maximumî, where the Greek word \u0010\u000e\u0016\u0001\t usually means ìgreatî, ìhugeî, ìmassiveî, ìvery loudî, ìvery longî etc. But words like ìmaximumî used to describe tribulation (Gk. \u0013\u0005\b\u0002\u0007\b\t ) remind us of imprudent griev- ances like ìthings canít possibly get any worseÖcan they?î The book of Job, by far the oldest book of the bible, reminds us of how things can get a hell of a lot worse if the powers of provi- dence sanction its manifestation. The scary part is Jobís piousness, that a man of irreproach- able integrity could incur sweeping and wholesale affliction. That such an upright, prosperous man could be ruined so utterly, hitting rock-bottom, yet given the opportunity to rebuild his life from scratchówhich he eventually did, imagine what ìtribulation maximumî entails for egregiously impious sex maniacs? While Job mayíve been the most righteous of men, what karmic debt he incurred in his previous lifetime, or the one before that etc., thatís not known. The angel, the God of Jesus makes it clear that weíll each and every one of us be judged by our works, and in Godís own good time. Cayce said he was a rather bad guy in his soulís previous incarnation, as one John Bainbridge: ìFrom an astrological aspect, then, the greater influence at the entrance of this entity that ye call Cayce was from Uranus. Here we find the extremes. The sojourn in Uranus was arrived at from what type of experience or activity of the entity? As Bainbridge, the entity in the material sojourn was a wastrel, one who considered only self; having to know the extremes in the own ex- perience as well as others.

Perhaps by having a past-life hypnotic regression, we can come to terms with our own trials and tribula- tions. Mars is improving with every incarnation, but is forever in danger of backslidingólike a dog to its vomit. The further up the ladder weíve climbed the further down we can fall. Mars rules Self and Death, and he exalts in the World. Itís reassuring to know that we improve with every incarnation, that man evolves in time with his world. That the further we fall, the fur- ther up the ladder we can still climb. Hard as it is, man strives to improve himself.

Hereís the collective association of angels with regard to whom the angels or Gods of the planets are identified. Jung referred to this as our collective unconscious, the sum and gestalt of the superconscious archetypes manifesting or evolving with our solar system. These angelic superconsciousnesses filter up to consciousness by way of mans sub- or un-conscious mind. The essence of Gods is superconsciousness in its multiple dimensions, each God or archetypal angel ruling its particular realm, his plane or dimension of super- ergo God-consciousness. Notably the ìseven spirits of the Godsî are that universal life-giving Êther by which the angels of our solar system are enabled. Godís univer- sal law, universal bounds, is wholly universal. How it manifests in ouróas ourósolar system is our local focus of universal law in action, as holds true everywhere in the universe that there is a focus of activity. Cayceís readings answered many questions about this, e.g. 5749-003: ìGC: You will give at this time a discourse on the subject ëAngels and Archangels, and How They Help Humanity.í You will also answer the questions which will be asked. EC: Yes. With the bringing into creation the manifested forms, there came that which has been, is, and ever will be, the spirit realm and its attributes - designated as angels and archangels. They are the spiritual manifestations in the spirit world of those attributes that the developing forces accredit to the One Source, that may be seen in material planes through the influences that may aid in development of the mental and spiritual forces through an experience - or in the acquiring of knowledge that may aid in the intercourse one with another.. Ö (Q) Explain the law of the line of demarcation between soul and spirit. (A) This is one, yet distinct - even as the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit is one, yet is the manifestation of a force that is ca- pable of manifestation in the varied planes of development. The soul is an individual, individuality, that may grow to be one with, or separate from, the whole. The spirit is the impelling in- fluence of infinity, or the one creative source, force, that is mani- festÖ .

When there was in the beginning a manís advent into the plane known as earth, and it became a living soul, amenable to the laws that govern the plane itself as presented, the Son of man entered earth as the first man. Hence the Son of man, the Son of God, the Son of the first Cause, mak- ing mani- fest in a material body. This was not the first spiritual influence, spiritual body, spiritual manifestation in the earth, but the first man - flesh and blood; the first carnal house, the first amenable body to the laws of the plane in its position in the universe. FOR, THE EARTH IS ONLY AN ATOM IN THE UNIVERSE OF WORLDS! And manís development began through the laws of the generations in the earth; thus the devel- opment, retardment, or the alterations in those positions in a material plane. And with error entered that as called DEATH, which is only a transition - or through Godís other door - into that realm where the entity has builded, in its manifestations as related to the knowledge and activity respecting the law of the universal influence. Hence the development is through the planes of experience that an entity may become one WITH the first cause; even as the angels that wait before the Throne bring the access of the influence in the experience through the desires and activities of an entity, or being, in whatever state, place or plane of development the entity is passing. For, in the compre- hension of no time, no space, no be- ginning, no end, there may be the glimpse of what simple transition or birth into the mate- rial is; as passing through the other door into another con- sciousness. Death in the material plane is passing through the outer door into a consciousness in the material activities that partakes of what the entity, or soul, has done with its spiritual truth in its manifestations in the other sphere. Hence, as there came the development of that first entity of flesh and blood through the earth plane, he became INDEED the Son - through the things which He experienced in the varied planes, as the de- velopment came to the oneness with the position in that which man terms the Triune.

(A) Passing from the material consciousness to a spiritual or cosmic, or outer consciousness, oft does an entity or being not become conscious of that about it; much in the same manner as an entity born into the material plane only becomes conscious gradually of that designated as time and space for the material or third dimensional plane. In the passage the entity becomes conscious, or the recognition of being in a fourth or higher di- mensional plane takes place, much in the same way as the con- sciousness is gained in the material. For, as we have given, that we see manifested in the material plane is but a shadow of that in the spiritual plane. In materiality we find some advance faster, some grow stronger, some become weaklings. Until there is redemption through the acceptance of the law (or love of God, as manifested through the Channel or the Way), there can be little or no development in a material or spiritual plane.

Whereas, his adversity against usóagainst our angelís ìdark sideîóis because of the unrighteous activity of both our individual and collec- tive angels in thisóof thisósolar system. Whatever we do unrighteously is antithetical to Je- susí righteousness. And thereby we become his enemy, each of us to the degree that we are working against him & against his angelic archetype. To that degree thus we agree to pay for our transgressions. Jesus warns our solar angel that heíll approach in stealth ìas a thiefî, and weíll not know ìthe hourî unless we keep vigil.

For every holy angel there seems to be a ìfallen angelî as if to balance their power by free will, our power of free will. The an- gels are in a profound sense confined to being either a power for good, or else a power for evil. Neither can die like humans. Holy angels live in heaven. Demons in hell. We never hear of angels doing evil, do we? How about Satan and his angels. Have you ever heard of Satan get- ting along ìpeachy keenî with Godís archangels? Is Satan ever accused of doing evil, unless WE are tempted? It just doesnít happen. Thatís because we humans are essentially the vehicle, the temple in which both good and evil do battle. Weíve heard the metaphor of an angel whispering in our right ear while the devil tempts us in our left ear. The reality is, we ourselves are doing the talking on both sides. We ourselves are both individually and collectively angels of good and evil. We can summon angels for purposes of good will, or purposes of ill-will. Thatís not to imply that angels arenít real entitiesófar from it! Rather, the superconscious connectivity that man has with angels gives us authority to summon themónot to command them, but only to summon them. There are divine rules, laws, by which man must live lest he fall into the pro- found pit of his own arrogance. The best advise is ask to help others. Thatís the only sure and safe way to summon Godís holy angels. Not by your own desperate needs or hopes but in pristine humility. Donít ask for an angel to appear to you, for that would be selfishóand ill- advisedly foolish. Only pure love for the subject of your prayers will invite the audience of angels to guide and protect those you love. Anything else is evil. In fact, even praying for those you love without allowance for those who God loves beyond your own loved ones is evil. Even our enemies are loved by God. A soldier on the battlefield loves and respects his enemyóand we still kill them. Thatís because there are rules, laws, an- gels over everyone. Only through the purest of motivations can we command good, and through the evilest of motivations can we command evil. Itís okay to love & respect the enemy of God and kill them. Anyone who murders inno- cents needs to die for his own good. If you donít think so, then youíd let America be de- stroyed. By loving your enemy, then you agree to sacrifice yourself for their well-being. If not then why did Jesus die for us? Best to say Godís will be done. Because God knows what you need better than you do. Weíre ìfoolsî in the sight of God. Think of it. Both pacifist and warrior are each one a fool.

Since the color green is from about 5700 A, down to 5100 A, and blue is 5100 down to 4750, unfiltered sunlight is most intense near the center of human vi- sion. Of course the Sun emits electromagnetic radiation across the entire spectrum, radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, xrays, gamma rays ad infinitum. But the narrow tri- une(RGB), diatonic (ROYGBIV), & chromatic (R,R-O,O,O-Y,Y,G,G-B,B,B-I,I,I-V,V) octave of visible light is centered as the Sun is centered on the cusp of Green-Blue, Cyan, the color of Libra, Venus- superior, the Evening Star and Archetypal Angel of Justice. The seven diatonic colors appear over in these wavelengths, although experts disagree slightly where color ìcuspsî are:  Color Angstroms ------------------ Violet 4000-4450 Indigo 4450-4750 Blue 4750-5100  Green 5100-5700 Yellow 5700-5900 Orange 5900-6500  Red 6500-6700 Though primary colors are generally agreed upon, secondary and tertiary colors are some- what less so because standards vary among color theory and its practical application. The theoretical addition or subtraction for either transmitted or reflected colors are exact comple- mentsótill you try to actually mix the same apparent color pigments on an artist palette, and you discover that Red plus Green makes Brown paint, not Yellow. Thatís because simple transmitted light is not partially absorbed, or darkened when mixed together, but a color de- parts FROM light as wavelengths are filtered out of the pure light beam. Mixed pigments be- come darkened, as is apparent by the light we see reflecting off of paint. Generally the rainbow of color we see from direct sunlight after a rainstorm or else refracted through a common prism is best representative of the seven primary and five secondary colors of the zodiac. The purity and intensity of the rainbow is the sunlight refracted into its component color, and glo- rifies how the light itself obeys the universal law. Notably, Magenta is made by subtracting Green from the RGB color trinity. Green is at chromatic opposition to Magenta in the zodiacal color wheel, Virgo and Pisces respectively. Similarly, Yellow is made by subtracting Blue from the RGB color trinity, e.g. surfaces that ab- sorb mostly Blue light will appear mostly Yellow.

Interestingly, the ìNew Chromaticity Diagram for Researchî shows Magenta at the intersection of 4000 and 6450 A. This is exactly equal to the cusps of Aries: Violet-Red and Red- Red-Orange on the zodiac color wheel. Magenta is the color of Pisces, not Aries which is absolutely Red in the zodiac. Pure Violet is but a primary color in the diatonic rainbow. Working only with the ìRGBî trin- ity, Magenta is the result. This shows that the additive and subtractive principles of color as we see it are uniform, since the color Red by the subtractive color theory is equivalent to Magenta in the additive color theory. To wit, the additive-trinity of RGB, Red, Green & Blue, are each exactly one sign away from MYC, Magenta, Yellow & Cyan per the additive-color wheel of the zodiac. Natu- rally, color pigments can only approximate the pure transmitted colors of a rainbow, but the basic layout of colors in the zodiac remains perfectly intact, since we know that pure printed colors appear less intense than RGB colors, which in turn appear less brilliant than a rainbow produced by direct sunlight. And yet the principle, or universal law under which even light itself must abide, is intact. Whether our human eyes see, and our brains interpret, light by subtractive and/or additive color theory ìappearsî to make no difference in the zodiac, i.e. the law of light. To be clothed in ìwhiteî, is really to be clothed in light. That is why the law of light is so fundamentally important. By recognizing the triune, diatonic and chromatic behavior of light we can better appreciate what it is to be clothed in it. ìWhiteî is either the absence of any sub- tractive color or the presence of all additive color. A light beam is ìpureî when all visible wavelengths are present and proportionally intense by its appearance to the human eye. White light is simply pure light, and we must learn and remember the triune, diatonic & chromatic components of light, that these same laws manifest through the spectrum of existence.

Perhaps our collective aversion to Satan encourages us to deny Satanís benefic force to Earth, which is the World Capricorn, Time in the World, Time that we use to do good and evil, and thereby accumulate ìkarmaî. When we think of atoms, we think of ìimpellingî influences, spirit, which is effectively ìfixedîóadhering to the laws of the universe so perfectly that an atom of carbon for example is identical as a basic unit throughout the universe. How can we know this when weíre con- fined to this planet in this solar system? Our confidence in the law is infallible. Itís the repro- ducibility of experimentation that makes men confident in the laws of the universe, ergo thatís science. Thus the participation of men in science gives it veracity. By observing and analyzing the electromagnetic spectrum of starlight reaching Earth from millions of distant suns, we find that various spectral classifications of common stars share most characteristics which make them distinguishable from other stars thus the repeatability of nuclear physics is witnessed by stellar radiation across billions of lightyears to Earthís firmament. Thus the Psalmist David writes:"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Minís Concise Commentary 150 ìcaeli enarrant gloriam Dei the heavens they are relating the glory of the Gods, et opera manuum eius adnuntiat and the works by the hands of him they are announced firmamentumî --Psa 19:1 (Vulg. 18-2) on the firmament. Remember that Earthís firmament is where men walk on terra firma, or sail on her waters, or fly in Earthís skies. Man sends unmanned instruments into outer space, but man NEVER leaves Earthís inner space, being confined to about 250 to 300 miles above sea level to wit, as in the space shuttles. Bottom line is Earthís heavenly firmament is right here on Earth, not somewhere deep in outer space. The announcement of Godís universal works is radiated spherically in all directions from each sun thereof, which radiation is carried all the way to usóand to every other solar systemóacross lightyears unobstructed thru the near-vacuum of deep space. Hence we know that natural law is universal and repeatable, reliable and inexorable. Godís law defines the boundary of each of his holy angels, each in their sidereal orbits and synodic positions to Earthís iris, commencing on our local meridian. How Godís angels ìget alongî forms the mythology of astrology, their innate universal archetypes, and their powers and principalities as Gods interact on the Earth in human form, we collectively being them & them collectively being us, the solar system altogether creating, sustaining and destroying through the grand skein of life & afterlife. The Gods project our anthropomorphic Archangels toward man. Hence, Archangel Michael is Jupiter, ìEmperorî of the Gods. Satan is Saturn, ìJudgmentî ranking second only to his son Jupiter. Gabriel is Apollo, ìStrengthî of the Sun. The Sun exalts in Aries hence Mars is ìRegent of the Sunî, King of Wands whose principality or terrestrial courtyard is Aries, so Uriel is Mars the ìTowerî, the ìFireî of the Gods whose scavenging vultures ìfeast on the fallenî. These four Gods, Jupiter (Michael), Saturn (Satan), Sun (Gabriel), Mars (Uriel), exalt in the cardinal or ìkingî elements: Water, Air, Fire, & Earth, respectively. Not surprisingly these are the same four planets which the prophet Nostradamus had in his seal, with his natal Sun transiting midheaven to rule in the 5th house of his horoscope, and Jupiter ruling 12th house over Mars & Saturn therein. Add to this, he had Venus ruling in the 7th house, Mercury ruling 6th af- flicting his Neptunian souljourn therein. His natal Moon was ruling the 4th house. Nostyís chart had all seven of his archangels in rulership. Of course he knew this, being a master judi- cial astrologer and devout Catholic. No wonder so few could understand him.

Of the hundreds of famous commentators on angels, St. Jerome, Dante Alighieri, and the Vulgate itselfóapocryphal books notwithstandingó, in general terms the angelic hierarchy outlines as follows:  (Jerome)  1 Seraphim  2 Cherubim  3 Powers  4 Dominions  5 Thrones  6 Archangels  7 Angels  (Dante)  1 Seraphim  2 Cherubim  3 Thrones  4 Dominations  5 Virtues  6 Powers  7 Archangels  8 Principalities  9 Angels Again, the classic Greco-Roman myth provides the benchmark against which previous and subsequent angelic myths can be best recognized and understood in basic astrological terms. Consider, the Gods of the Pantheion are well-known by both astronomical & astrological characteristics and behaviors. Man, who is created in the image & likeness of the Gods is in communication with the Almighty through his holy angels. How the Archangels communicate with humans is archetypally familiar and common to all of us, yet is singularly unique to each of us on an individual basis, according to how far we have evolved as souls, and our self-imposed limitations. We tend to congregate into and away from groups of similar unfoldment, as our physical, mental and spiritual capacity takes us. Those with extraordinary limits or extraordinary gifts tend to specialize, and often excel more than others. But how much they influence the world, depends on how much they demon- strate, communicate, and propagate their talents. Even the most unknown hermit can refine his or her ability, but to share it with others requires a little extra effort."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Minís Concise Commentary 152 The question arises, how much of the Archangels as we know them is projected from our- selves up toward the illimitable, I mean, collectively, archetypally? In essence, Archangels are our focii of that lagrange point between God & Man, or, to reminisce, Michelangeloís unri- valed rendition of \u0001\u0003\u0001\u0006 & Adam not quite ever touchingóforever leaving room to grow, but also highlighting that point of no return, the abyssal of chaos! It seems that our Creator placed a great deal of confidence in us as human beings, in our body, mind & soul. Gabrielís trumpet invites Johnís awareness by his solar angel, i.e. Johnís own lagrange be- tween himself and Almighty God along the sphere, plane or dimension of the 4th heaven be- yond this the third. The level or extent of surrender on Johnís part has opened the door that much to the Archangel. The less of ìJohnî in the equation the more that his angel channels Gabrielís collective archetype, his consciousness, as if Johnís Archangel opens the door by Johnís invitation. This is Johnís oversoul opening the door to his soul, freewill being the key- word. Not by Johnís will, but God within opens his soulís outer door in heaven. Think of this as it was before you were born in this mortal life. Your soul is arguing with your oversoul (i.e., your fallen angels doing battle with Godís holy angels) concerning your coming fate in your next incarnationówhich you know will be difficult. You know this, because you know that Godís will supersedes your own every time. You donít like it. You protest, since that part of your will thatís asynchronous with Godís will canít understand why. After all, you were doing so well in heavenówhy must you return to the Earth in a new body who is vulnerable to the perils and pitfalls of the fallen man? So Johnís consciousness ascends in vibration to the fourth heaven where is seatedó meaning rulingóthe king of heaven. Remember, the whole solar system localized in its posi- tion in the Milky Way from the Sunís genesis, during which this local solar kernel of creation formed orbits in accordance with the universal law, the law of the iris, also known as the ìeye of the skyî. From its inception, our solar system is a vast ìatomî in the natural evolution of the Milky Way galaxy, which itself evolves within a vastly greater macrocosmic evolution of galac- tic clusters, then super-clusters, then super-super-clusters. . .to googolplexes ad infinitum. Because the universe is infinite, we can never see the end of it, not even in the mind of God, because God himself is Illimitable. The infinite hyperdimensional cosmic fractals of Godís creating appear to know no bounds save those that are imposed by his universal law, being one & three, seven & twelve, which are: Unity & Trinity, Diatonic & Chromatic at its foundation. Iíll quote a few Cayce reading excerpts: ìEach planetary influence vibrates at a different rate of vibra- tion. An entity entering that influence enters that vibration; not necessary that he change, but it is the grace of God that he may!

Arcturus is a bright orange star marking the end of caelestial Virgo (alBoo 29Vir26í +30:44í mag. -0.04) which marks nearly the same longitude as the bright binary star, Spica (alVir 29Vir03í -2:03í mag. 0.97).

Because evening precedes morning in every ancient myth, Libra, the first sign of eve- ning, is liturgically-speaking the first sign of the zodiac. At zodiacal opposition is Aries, the first sign of morning, ecclesiastically-speaking. Similarly each sign has a yin and yang, a femi- nine and masculine principle. So there is the entering and leaving of each zodiacal sign in the circle of animals. The chart below illustrates this: Ari Gem Leo Lib Sag Aqu | 1/2 5/6 9/10 13/14 17/18 21/22 | /---\\---/---\\---/---\\---/---\\---/---\\---/---\\---/ | 3/4 7/8 11/12 15/16 19/20 23/24 | Tau Can Vir Sco Cap Pis "},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Minís Concise Commentary 154 Thus the odd-numbered signs of the zodiac peak at opposite polarity to even-numbered signs in a way comparable to a wave, with odd-numbered crests and even-numbered troughs. Remember, the numbering of the signs of the zodiac are two-fold. The common, ecclesiastical zodiac commences on Aries, which is the exaltation of Apollo in the first sign of morning. While the liturgical zodiac begins at Libra, evening, with the exaltation of Saturn the ìsun of darknessî, hence Satan. I suspect this is why orthodox xians reject ìoccultî teachings, studies and practices for fear of their ìshadow-selfî, that vital and integral component of soul, mind and body, which together with the ìlight-selfî form a complete, individuating human being. Hence, the yin or anima of self (shadow, feminine) & the yang or animus (light, masculine) of the self-same animate entity are complements one of the other. Is this why fearful orthodox xians have loathed and subjugated this feminine part of man for so many centuries, thus pro- jecting their delusionsófear of Satanóonto women? Of course, every human being, every man and woman has both yin and yang in their psy- che and persona, a right and left side to every aspect of one complete being. A complete man & a complete woman married together form one complete body as God the Creator in- tended, ìto be fruitful and multiplyî [Genesis 1:27-28; 2:18,21-25]. When you look at the circle of animals (zodiac), this unified duality becomes apparent. Since each of the planets has yin & yang aspects e.g. Zeus & Hera, Kronos & Rhea, Adonai & Adonis, etc., thus each of the twelve signs made by the planets resonate their nature, with the Moon (yin) & her twin brother Sun (yang) complete and together in Cancer & Leo. By the same principle Taurus (Adonis) complements Libra (Adonai), inferior and superior aspects of Venus. Note how their polarities complement one to the other. The same is true of Mercury, Mars, Jupiter & Saturn, with each planetís inferior and superior aspect in complementary op- positionóreflecting their innate feminine and masculine principles in accordance with their sidereal orbit to the Sun (10), and synodic orbit (12) to the Earth.

This in turn orbits the Milky Wayís barycenter (/sgra-b) about which everything in it is mutually in orbit. Then comes galactic clusters, and super to the Nth power galactic clusters ad infinitumóall things being relative. Hereon the Earth, the center is the center of each per- son, relative to the center of the Earth (my Planetary Awareness Technique explains this in detail). The ìsea of glass like rock crystalî is the Earthís memory Mnemosyne embodied in her crystalline structure of Earthís thin crust, which is essentially a hollow sphere filled by the great mass of Earthís molten elements, all of which is attracted by its own elemental forces to- ward her geocenter about which it mutually rotates. That the Earth is ìclearî refers to the as- trological forces which we ìviewî from the center of the Earth, the center of Mnemosyneís crystalline memory. In the middle of the throne, and all around it are four animals each of which has omnidirectional vision. The first has the face of a lion, the second a calf, the third like a man, and fourth like an eagle. These are messengers, heralds of the Gods. Each is triune, having six wings each, meaning two wings for each angel & three angels per animal. The elder Gods are the Titans, thus their elder messengers yield to the younger Olympian Gods & their youthful angels. When the elders give glory to Jupiter, who is the reigning king of heaven, the Emperor of volition, or will-in-action, then the elders are submitting to the kingís will and they remove their golden crowns and cast them before his throne. Volition is the most vital substance of judicial astrology, since freewill is only free when we observe his divine law. The face of each of the four animals refers to the God who exalts in that animalís cardinal or creative courtyard, as the lion is the archetype of strength, the Sun exalting in Aries. The calf typifies sacrifice, Saturn exalts in Libra. The man is Mars who exalts in Capricorn. The eagle Jupiter is exalted in Cancer. This cardinal quadruplicity is ruled by God the Creator or creative trinity of the four animals. The fixed quadruplicity is ruled by God the Sustainer, sus- tenant trinity of the four animals. While the mutable quadruplicity ruled by God the De- stroyer, destructive trinity of the four animals. Hence the trinity of the four animals refers to the three signs in each animalís respective quadrant of the zodiac. The lion is for Aries, Taurus & Gemini. The calf is for Libra, Scorpio & Sagittarius. The man-like face is for Capricorn, Aquarius & Pisces. With Cancer, Leo & Virgo for the eagle of Jupiter. So the four animals have three qualities each, Cardinal, Fixed & Mutable, or triune nature. As Crowned Emperor of heaven, Jupiter is dignified above his fellow planetary Gods, who as youíll recall, number ten in all, and MUST be considered altogether Oneónot ten separate Gods only.

There would be a con- stant struggle between the two sides, and by our actions we would have to decide which was stronger, the evil or the goodî [end quote, Hopi Prophecy by Dan Katchongva] In fact, the heart is far and away the strongest muscle in the human body. If the right side be stronger it certainly isnít for want of the heart, but perhaps for something else. The human brain embodies a whole universe of complexity at every level of operation. There is tremendous connectivity among and between its two hemispheres, with plenty of data crossover or bioelectric ìcrosstalkî. For example, signals from the left side of both eyes is sent to the right brain, while signals from the right side of both eyes tends to go to the left brain. The human face is normally asymmetrical, one ear lower than the other. The left side of the face is more expressive of right-brain qualities, in wisdom, mercy and victory, for which Neptune, Jupiter and Mars are known. The right side of the face exhibits more left-brain char- acteristics, by intellect, judgment & strength for which the planets Mercury, Saturn and Sun are known. Between the two hemispheres are the Êther & infinity (Uranus), beauty and bal- ance (Venus), dreams & imaginings (Moon), until the center of activity, manís ever-evolving sphere of practicality and experience (Pluto). These ten planets compose the tree of life with the central four planets sharing aeolian & ionian, minor & major, modalities, Uranus and Moon the minor, Venus and Pluto the major.

Considering the Revelation of John was penned circa 95 AD, fully thirty years had passed since the daily sacrifice had ended and the destruction of the templeó and all Jerusalem with itóhad occurred by the time the Revelation was published and was circulated among the early Judeo-Xian ecclesia c. 100 AD. Even then, no one doubted that it was the crucifixion of Jesus back in 31 AD which had directly caused the daily sacrifice to cease and the temple-made-with-hands to be obliterated, and the city to be utterly razed flat to the ground. And beyond this it is likewise certain that the crucifixion of Jesus portends the wholesale desolation of the world as we know it before 2331 AD. Because the early Xians un- derstood the dire consequences of Godís lamb having been slaughtered, so too were these early Xians leaping with joy over the good news that Jesus had been crucified for the sins of ìmyriads myriadsî (Gk. \u0010\u0013\r\b\u0001\u001a\u000e\t\u0010\u0013\r\b\u0001\u001a\u0003\f ), meaning many hundreds of millions & ìthou- sands thousandsî (Gk. \u001b\u001c\b\u0005\b\u0001\u001a\u000e\t\u001b\u001c\b\u0005\b\u0001\u001a\u0003\f ), meaning many millions more, perhaps num- bering in the *billions* of people finding salvation in the gospel of Christ-crucified.

The elder Gods are the planets, beginning with Tellus, the Earth (Gk. \u001d\u0001\u000e\u0001 ) and her starry canopy Uranus (Gk. \u001e \u0006\r\u0001\f\u0003\t ) who gave birth to the elder giants rather our AWARENESS of the planets on her caelestial sphere.

The fourth horse is called pale-green, or ìgreenish-yellowî (Gk. \u001b\u0005\u0003\r\u0003\t ), or more nearly colorless, the absence of color, the willful rejection of the rule of the Gods in life. There can be no doubt that Death is Scorpio, the rulership of Mars-superior, Vitality, & Pluto-inferior, Diis Manibus, particularly Pluton-Hades, the great God of the underworld. The fifth seal is that of the Moon whose Aeolian muse Klio writes history at the foundation of the world. Millions of martyred souls pleading with Jupiter to exact vengeance on the living on account of the karmic debt theyíve inherited from their lives as ancestors. Zeus shines the white light of the togetherness of the Gods on Mt. Olympus down on the souls, telling them to be patient, that the living must be killed as they were, each according to their works.

The foreboding portent of eclipses goes back to prehistoric antiquity, frightening mankind for two hundred thousand years even though weíve always understood the cause of solar and lunar eclipses, by the fall of Adam. The stars falling from heaven are souls of evildoers incarnating into our fallen Adamic na- ture. No soul in heaven is looking forward to being cast down into our vulnerable condition as mortals. Mans mother of the music of the spheres Mnemosyne remembers by the crystalline elements of Earthís thin crust, her ìskinî as the mystics have called it. This reference to ìthe third part of the stars of heavenî means the augmented fifth, the mutable court of the triplic- ities of Earth, Fire, Air, Water. The third decanate, changeable, the third part of the trinity, the ìDestroyerî who follows the ìCreatorî and ìSustainerî, in which the Creator is the Cardinal, tonic or root of its triplicity, while Sustainer is the Fixed, major third harmony, relative to the Creator. For example the Creator of Fire is Aries, Sustainer is Leo, and Destroyer is Sagittarius, and the three decans of each of these three signs retain these qualities, such that the first decan of Aries is Creator, first decan of Leo is Sustainer, and first decan of Sagittarius is Destroyer. These astrological principles are the basis for the ìthird partî of everything always being asso- ciated with change, or evil-doers, destruction, transformation, transmutation. And the first part of everything is always associated with God the Creator, just as the second part always goes with angels & saints, God the Sustainer. Such astrological relationships are covered in meticulous detail in my previous four books."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 163 The conspicuous parable of the fig tree [Isaiah 34:4; Mark 13:28; Matthew 24:32; ibid] is a recurrent theme regarding prophecy and the wrath of God towards the end of the world.

In addition, the fig tree parable, as it is used here in Revelation 6:13-14, may also point to a significant and catastrophic shifting of Earthís rotational axis and maybe accompanied by yet another catastrophic crust- displacement, in which the Earth becomes more stable and firm, under the heavens, with Earthís daily rotation returning more perpendicular in her orbit with the Sun. Since chapter 8 clearly refers to an asteroid or comet striking the Earthís oceans (I believe in the South Pacific based on other prophecies), then a catastrophic pole-shift and crustal-displacement is not out of the question. Another cause could be our global warming since the industrial revolution, by which the deep ice shelfs are melting at an unprecedented rate. This will have the reverse ef- fect as what Einstein said in Hapgoodís foreword about asymmetrical ice deposition causing crustal displacement, just as Jupiterís moon Europa is observed to do. Whatever the catalyst for catastrophic ìearth-changesî, we know the fundamental cause is the crucifixion of Christ on the morning of the Passover on Wednesday 25 April 31 AD, and more specifically about 3 PM LAT when he actually died. So each soul who is presently incarnate upon the Earth has good reason to fear the undi- luted wrath of God and His Son. That the rocks and mountains should fall toward the center of Earthís gravity, which is Plu- ton-Hades, is the covering of karma against Godís wrath. These misguided souls are asking mother Earth to hide their sins from Jesus instead of confessing them in his presence. Rather than admitting the self-deprecating shame of our sins before Jesus Christ who suffered horri- bly and died the worst possible death for us at Golgotha, just outside the ancient gates of Da- mascus at the north-western edge of the city that was entirely razed flat to the ground 39 years 146 days after the crucifixion, the Earth remembers. Can the erosion of time hide our sins from Almighty God? Can we as souls escape Godís wrath over our transgressions against Him? Only to the degree we feel ashamed and ask Jesus for his forgiveness can a man be forgiven of his or her sins against the son of man.

When we consider the archetypal creation myth of man, that the Gods created woman from one of Adamís ribs whilst Adam deeply slept in his subconscious and superconscious planes of experience, one might wonder if Adam had had a 25th rib, leaving him 24, and from which Evening was made and graced with nearly the same twelve pairs of ribs as Adam re- tained, Adamís more masculine than feminine, & Eveís more feminine than masculine, both male & female sharing both traits but Adam predominantly masculine & Even predominantly feminine. Consider the basic structure of the human ribcage. We have twelve pairs of ribs, seven true ribs, and five false ribs. The seven pairs of true ribs are connected to the spine in back, and by costal cartilage to the sternum in front. The five pairs of false ribs are composed of three pairs"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 165 which are a bit shorter than true ribs, and are connected to the spine in back, but are con- nected by costal cartilage under the seventh true rib in front. The remaining two pairs are floating ribs, which are the smallest of all, and although connected to the spine in back, they have no connection on their anterior endsóhence floating. These twelve pairs of ribs are con- nected to the twelve thoracic vertebrae in the spine, above which are seven cervical vertebrae, and below are five large lumbar vertebrae, making 24 spinal vertebra in all. The common theme of seven and five makes twelve is conspicuous in light of the sidereal and synodic influ- ence of the planets in the zodiac of life. Even the three added false ribs connected to the sev- enth true rib reflect seven and three make ten vessels of God, seven planet modalities and three repeat modes which add the bass up to the center. When considered in this manner the first ten pairs of ribs are sidereal. Also when you add the last two floating ribs, now you have the seven white keys plus the five black keys makes the chromatic scale or planetary signs of the zodiac. Itís a very archetypal design, as is the whole human being. Our two open-ended pairs of ribs are incomplete, and still developing, emblematic of manís ever-evolving condition of life, the developing center of experience, Earth and Pluto, the tenth heaven, the Empirevm. Manís first seven pairs of ribs are complete and closed full circle at the breastbone, as if to describe the sidereal orbits of the seven planets, fixed, closed, complete, and altogether fixed in one group. Manís next three pairs are the fixed, false ribs, complete only below the seventh rib, below the whole true-rib group. These three pairs are described by Uranus, Neptune & Pluto. The remaining two pairs of floating ribs can only refer to the quadrangle of the terrestrial zodiac, the four animals or living quadrants of life, two quadrants of evening, and two quad- rants of morning. As detailed in my previous books, the six evening signs are superior, return- ing, ìblue-shiftî benefic, blessed, purified signs of the zodiacócommencing on Arcturus in the universal sense, and entering the court of the King of Swords in the temporal ìminor arcanaî sense. In the balance, the six ìsinfulî signs of morning begin on archetypal Aries, or universal ìDevilî of the major arcana, and the court of the King of Wandsóof temporal experience. These six signs of morning are in ìred-shiftî, receding by radial velocity ìrushing forthî, a planetís malefic aspect. In keeping with the universal creation myth, the left side of man is weak but benefic, the right side which is strong but malefic. The left side is wise, but the right is intelligent. The left side is giving & the right side is taking. So even though both male & female share left & right qualities, the average male of the species tends to be slightly more ìtakerî than ìgiverî. thus the female tends to give a bit more than she takes. Itís only natural. After all, God gave the beautiful daughter of evening unto the son of morning. In compensation, the female will as- sert herself more than the male, while the male will acquiesce & accommodate lest he face worse-than-hellish fury of this womanís scorn."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Minís Concise Commentary 166 Conversely the male spermatozoa is the transmitter of life. The so-fertilized female ovum is the receptor of life. The male externalizes his sperm and the female internalizes it. The female externalizes life in the form of the human baby. Hence the female also gives life and shows it by pregnancy. Historically, itís been mostly the male who takes life, by war and bloodshed. Sure, plenty of females have been great warriors alongside males on the battlefield of bygone eras. Even today, many a brave and noble woman dons the uniforms of military combat beside male counterparts, in harmís way. Yet the female remains very much female and the male, male (normal, natural heterosexu- als, not unnatural homosexuals). Truly, the left & right sides or ìyin & yangî sides of the male are about perfectly complementary to the left & right sides of the female. Think about it. The mutual attraction is so thorough, so complete between male & female. What is lacking in one is brimming over in the other! A maleís masculine & feminine nature complements the fe- maleís and vice versa. In the archetypal sense is this ìmystical marriageî of body, mind & soul. The whole essence of the human being is complete in the unity of male & female, touching heaven. Among other things, Cayce interprets the ì24 eldersî of Revelation as ìthe 24 cranial nerves of the headî [281-29#6], albeit most of the 281-series of readings are sort of ìyes-manî Q&A, meaning, Cayce says ìyes, thatís correctî almost every question he is asked! Reminding readers that most of such ìglad helpersî prayer & healing group interpretations are just that, interpre- tations. This is because sidereal & synodic principles of the planets are fixed separately but are free and transposable together. We can transpose every diatonic modality into every chromatic key signature. That is seven times twelve equals eighty-four key signatures of the Gods, again, as Iíve meticulously detailed in my books. It all comes down to judicial astrology, and the positions of the planets to the Earth at the moment of a manís death, his last breath or ìdeath rattleî, till that departed soul incarnates anew into the horoscope of his new body, at the moment he or she draws the first breath of life. Thus, his natal horoscope follows that person until the day they die, forever relative to the real-time positions of the planets in the daily horoscope, by the rule of the Gods exerted on the Earth from their positions TO the Earth, and the cycle repeats: death and planetary so- journ, birth and life until death, and on it goes ad infinitumóuntil we conquer death even as Jesus did already conquer deathÖthatís how it is. So it seems that our twelve pairs of cranial nerves are designed under the same divine hier- archical rulebook that is architect of our ribcage and spine. The cranial nerves are:"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 167 No. Nerve Pair I - Olfactory II - Optic III - Oculomotor IV - Trochlear V - Trigeminal  i) ophthalmic  ii) maxillary  iii) mandibular VI - Abducens VII - Facial VIII - Vestibulocochlear IX - Glossopharyngeal X - Vagus XI - Accessory XII - Hypoglossal So, on any given day ones natal horoscope is influenced by the positions of the planets to the Earth on that day. The willful transposition of the planetary influence occurs on authority of the Godsófrom their present positions to the Earth! If you must repeat this to yourself a hundred times to get, then by all means do so. Judicial astrology is the cornerstone for grasp- ing every biblical principle bar none, by understanding how freewill operates under universal law. Mans scientific endeavors to understand such esoteric principles are broad and all- encompassing. Jesusí advice is to ìseek ye first the reign of the heavensî [Mat 6:33], which, in the first century Greco-Roman empire, was clearly understood to mean the ìrulership of the planetary Gods here on the Earthî (Lat. regnum caelorum )óthe overriding theme of the gospel according to Matthew! Even the magi who visited baby Jesus in 2 BC were very much aware that ìthe reign of the heavensî has always been crucial to understanding what the vastly more ancient Egypto-Babylonian religions of the stars were all about. In this light, ancient religions the world over have always shared this much in common as Mayan, Vedic and other mystical teachings of antiquity attest. It is the sidereal and synodic reign of the Gods hereon Earth which forms the foundation of this solar system experience. By seeking the Rulership of the Heavens within, then everything in life, death, and the af- terlife will reveal itself accordingly, all in good timeóover geological aeons if it takes that long to complete each soulís solar system cycle. It seems the more you focus your efforts on helping others, then the more complete your soulís planetary cycle becomes. But the more selfish ones efforts become, then the more we are backsliding into the ego-self. You can see this happen frequently with pop music or hollywood celebrities, anyone who has been adored by millions of fans for too long. Many have become quite rich, and very shamelessly self-centered! Most superstars get over it, as fame is oft-fleeting.

The whole premise of sal- vation is that we are saved not by saving ourselves, but by works, by actively helping others. Doing so seems to have the effect of awakening the rule of the heavens within. That doesnít mean we shouldnít pray or meditate in solitude, but our light must shine in the open. Thatís what being judged by your works is all about. Weíre judged more by what we do in life than any other criterion. Sharing the joy that scientific and mystical enlightenment brings is the purview of both sci- entists and mystics. Such distinctions get blurred where science and the occult join forces, the synthesis of disciplined religion and free art. For example, thereís an interesting scientific study which is put to music, literally. http://www.dnamusiccentral.com : ì..music is a natural medium for expressing the complex pat- terns of proteins and their encoding DNA. Both consist of a lin- ear sequence of elements whose real meaning lies in their com- binations, proving that the whole is equal to or greater than the sum of its partsî ì..The 3 billion base pairs in the human genome are organized into 24 distinct, physically separate microscopic units called chromosomes. All genes are arranged linearly along the chro- mosomes. The nucleus of most human cells contains two sets of chromosomes, one set given by each parent. Each set has 23 single chromosomes ó 22 autosomes and an X or Y sex chro- mosome. A normal female will have an X X pair of these gender chromosomes; a male will have an X Y gender pair. Chromo- somes contain roughly equal parts of protein and DNA; chro- mosomal DNA contains an average of 150 million bases. DNA molecules are among the largest molecules now known.î [end quote; refer to http://www.dnamusiccentral.com ] Similarly, the ancient, prototypical 22-character alphabet corresponds to the ten planets & twelve signs of the major arcana, all of which corresponds to the sidereal & synodic qualities of music! This fundamental relationship works in every branch of science and occult disci- plines. Developing such universal principles in any specific field of science requires only two things. Knowledge of music and knowledge of science. The fundamental importance of music is ancient and modern, local and universal.

So itís no surprise that the ìstar-logicianî, the judicial astrologer, the skilled astronomer and mathematician, ours is the music of the spheres, as applied to everyday living. Itís the applica- tion of these fundamental precepts to complex observations and deductions which empowers metaphysics, since the very power thereof is the kingdom of the heavens. By this heavenly power, the continual process of salvation is imbued. This process is en- abled by Christís crucifixion. This process requires ones invitation and participation in order to affect its long evolutionary process of spiritual, mental and bodily transformation on Godís own schedule not yours. The book of Daniel gives us until about 2331 AD, by which time weíre entering the city by election, else weíre without its pearly gates. Again, this is the war of a 1000 years, of ten sidereal years in perfect and imperfect mood.

Gen 1:1-31 (the first chapter) refer to the elohiym (Heb. \u0007\u0006\u0001\b\t , Gods of Heaven) 26 times, but Jehovah (Heb. \u0001\u0003\u0001\u0006 , I AM, the One, Almighty) doesnít appear until Gen 2:4 in front of elohiym, rendered ì \u0007\u0006\u0001\b \t\u0001\u0003\u0001\u0006 î, literally ìThe Master of the Gods of Heavenî, or as St. Jerome commonly translates it ìDominus Deusî, or the Dominant one Zeus, Jupiter, the ìjovialî God of giving. That the Sun-Jupiter barycenter has the most gravitational influence on the entire solar systemís planetary orbits is no mere coincidence. But because the God of the 6th heaven is the greatest of the ten Gods of Heaven thus Jupiter has the second greatest mass in the solar system exceeded only by the Sun who holds it all together. The Sunís the God of Day, while the ten Gods in sidereal order of Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune & Pluto (Earth), the Gods of these ten vast regions, or di- mensions, of heaven are verily the Rulers of Night. But consider the actual words used by the Hebrew-Egyptian priest in Genesis. Only the first six days of creation are referenced to both evening [Heb. \u000b\u0002\f , ereb, Gk. \u000e\r\u000e \u0003\t ) and morning [Heb. \u0002\r\u000b , boqer], the superior & inferior synodic aspects of the plan- ets, but the seventh day includes no such reference. Also, the luminaries of both Day and Night are called ìgreatî by Moses, the great or ìelderî light to dominate the day, and the lesser ìyoungerî light to dominate the night, with ìdayî [Heb. \u0007\u0003\u0006 , yowm, time, day, year, Gk. \u000e\u000f\u000e\u000b \u0010\u000e\r\b\t , day- book of the Gods] and ìnightî [Heb. \b\u0006\b , layil, night]. As the Sunís daily transit on the local meridian (southing on a sundial, twelve oíclock post meridiem LAT) bears witness to the solar day, so too do the distant suns on our caelestial firmament bear witness to the si- dereal transits & the sidereal & synodic orbits of the planets. Of course, daily observations serve to reveal, confirm & calibrate previous astronomical predictions, and also to refine the ephemeris for future generations observing long-term predictions (as Iíve covered extensively in last book, ëMinís Planetary Awareness Techniqueí). As we know, ancient stargazers were me- ticulous astronomers. Genesis neatly summarizes these beginnings of astronomy & astrology in the simplest possible terms. That does not mean that Moses wasnít educated in these sub- jects and very much so. Rather Mosesí genius at quickly reducing complex subject matter to its essential beginnings reveals his tremendous aptitude for communication with people less educated than himself. Moses would become the most revered teacher in all history Before Christ. Thereíve been plenty of rivals for that accolade! That speaks VOLUMES for Moses. The seventh seal opens with ìsilence in heavenî for a half hour. This is essentially the ìcalm before the stormî, the peacefulness before war, a moment of pause before judgment, to recol- lect our thoughts, to replenish our strength.

Notably, the quasi-Ω hour of silence (Gk. \u001c\u0003\t\u001c\u000e\u0010\b\u0003\r\b\u0003\f ) is ìabout half an hourî, since where the meridians of time intersect the ecliptic or caelestial equator defines house- cusps in the courts of the Godsí rulership. Because of the 23.x obliquity of Earthís sidereal-daily rota- tion to the ecliptic, the ± 30∞ angles of the courtyards oscillate between minima & maxima twice sidereal-daily, centered along the local geographical meridian of longitude (of activity) in reference to the fixed east point and Earthís geocenter. Hence Ω hour of sundial time (LAT) is about 7 Ω degrees caelestial (ecliptic) longitude, slightly more or less. It is notable that such precision astronomical considerations are accounted for only by judicial astrologers, and no one else. This was common knowledge to the ancient astrologers, and pertains to planets ac- quiring or separating per aspect- orb as measured in caelestial longitude without respect to a planetís caelestial latitude (except for that of the Sun, whose geocentric position is always 0 caelestial latitude). If you ever wondered WHY no more than 7.5 degrees is considered a horoscopically sig- nificant aspect, now you know it is because the predominant daily horoscope depends on what planets are within significant orb relative to the average 30* courtyards of the Earthís meridian houses. Since about half of these planetary aspects are either acquiring or separating over long-term averages, reducing the orb down to approximately ±7 degrees assures signifi- cance in approximated calculations where event times were merely estimated in ancient times. Ones local angle time (LAT) was measured on a sundial during daylight hours, or to transiting stars at night, weather permitting. A common ancient sundial set level and properly positioned to rotational-axis south was usually accurate to within fifteen or twenty minutes, with more ingenious designs accurate down to one or two minutes. Even so, it was rare that such reliable data was available to the judicial astrologer, who relied on the event itself, a birth, a death, an earthquake, etc., to rectify the hour under the dominant ruling planets and significant transits. Even the unrectified daily horoscope is always better than 75% correct, as planets within the ~7.5 degrees aspect orb will dominate the horoscope an average of 18 hours per day, rarely below 14 hours per day, or exceeding 22 hours a day. Even if we only know it was ìdayî or ìnightî, then the certainty of the horoscope increases from above 75% up to 88% certain. A diligent astrologer can achieve better than 90%. World-class adepts, e.g. Parthian Magoi, were probably 98% correct (only Jesus Christ is 100% right 100% of the time).

The voice or trumpet of the first angel issues forth, with hail, fire, blood thrown to the Earth. The first four trumpets are reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt circa 1800 BC, e.g., sev- enth plague of hail, fire & thunder (Exo 9:13-33). The trumpet tones of the seven angels ex- cite the astrological elements, the forces of nature which do indeed combine to bring about real hail, fire, meteor storms in which the incoming projectiles donít fully burn up in the at- mosphere, but hit the ground red-hot and could easily weigh a talent or 100-200 lbs.(Rev. 16:21).

Whether the Nile was turned to actual blood, or more likely was turned reddish color by some kind of algae or other organism, perhaps doesnít matter. The I AM of God can do anything, that much is certain. I do, however, tend to believe that nature is perfectly capable of doing Godís bidding. After all, most biblical plagues are described as natural phenomena accomplished by Godís will and occurring in nature, plague of frogs, lice, flies, pestilence, boils, large meteor showers, locusts, darkness, and first-born of all male Egyptian children keeling over deadóalbeit these last two plagues seem more supernatural, than just natural.

Nostradamus seemed to think this incoming massive mountain of Revelation 8:8 (Gk. \u0010\u000e\u0016\u0001\t\u0003\r\u0003\t ) is not quite one mile across, and the resulting tidal wave will kill millions and millions along the coastal region of inhabited land masses:  C1Q69 La *grand montaigne ronde de sept stades, The great mountain round of seven stadia, Apres paix, guerre, faim, innondation: After peace, war, famine, inundation: Roulera loin abismant grands contrades, Will roll far sinking great countries, Mesmes antiques, & grand fondation.

JPII was quoted back in November 1980 while visiting Fulda, Germany, when asked about this controversial third secret of Fatima: ìWhen you read that oceans will inundate entire continents, and millions of men will suddenly have life snatched from them in a second - if you know this, there is no need to publish the se- cret.î ó Pope John Paul II (1920- ) One thing we know for sure, that when this occurs it shall strike without warning, and land elevations lower than 850í a.s.l. will be vulnerable to the wave. While the worldwide flood of Noahís time circa 28,000 BC was vastly more powerful, caused by crustal displace- ment, and purging of subterranean waters, with runup reaching 10,000í and permanently rais- ing the worldís sealevel by more than half a mile, and leaving nothing but silted mud in its wake, water channels cutting through the mud as the cataclysmic inundation receded down the continental land masses toward the deep ocean. The first two angelic trumpets of Rev 8 herald devastating meteor storms striking the Earth with one massive asteroid sending hun- dreds of millions worldwide to an early, watery grave. The first trumpet heralds death by fire, the second by water. Thatís just the first two. Weíve five more to go. The third angelís trumpet seems to be the aftermath of the first two, upsetting the Earthís ecosystem. Radiation must be the cause, perhaps by compromised nuclear submarines or other military vessels overcome in the tidal wave with the countless megatons of debris washed out to sea by the wave. Or, is it possible that top secret biological weapons make the waters bitter? Notably, wormwood is in genus Artemisia, named for the Moon. This also ech- oes the first trumpet and first & seventh plagues of Egypt. The waters are unpotable. Given the Chernobyl nuclear disaster back in 1986, I think the nuclear theme makes more sense. Radioactive rain, acid rain, or whatever it turns out to be, potable water is the most important substance known to man. Man can survive for weeks or even months without food, but pota- ble water gives us life for just a few days at a time. That this unpotable rain water is deadly, thatís GOT to be radiation poisoning. While this third trumpet portends the catastrophic fallout resulting from the previous two trumpets, the next trumpet, the fourth seems to be the lull before the stormóas if we hadnít been through an unimaginably powerful storm already!

This foreboding eclipse portending the elemental forces of change, by the angelís voice, draws attention to Jupiterís airborne eagle transiting the meridian, heralding yet more exceed- ingly grievous plagues to come. So the plague of the fourth trumpet is the intensified sadness and hopelessness of the situation. The ninth Egyptian plague (Exo 10:21-23) brought three days of this gloomy eclipse on the Egyptians, which brings us to a very important point about ìdarknessî. As with much of the bible, thereíre moods of understanding, not just grammatically but also by way of human experience. When Godís Son was crucified, from about 12 noon until the moment he died about 3 PM, for those three hours the worst possible sadness fell upon the land (Mat 27:45). Jesus was dying, Godís first born Son was suffering the worst horror, the most excruciating torture any man could ever be subjected to, and by 12 oíclock it was clear that Jesus was past the point of being revived. At noon, the Sun began sinking lower in the sky, taking with it any hope that Jesus would be rescued from certain death. God was dying! The death of the Gods-in-the-flesh was the darkest day in human history. Adam died because he sinned. Jesus died not because he had sinned but because of the sins of the Adamic- natured world. As the darkness of the ninth plague in Egypt was harbinger to the tenth and last plague, death of every first-born in Egypt not spared by the passover, so too is the trumpet of the fourth angel harbinger of dreadful plagues yet to come. So you see, thereíre layers of under- standing what is light and what is darkness. A really depressed person can be out in the noon- day Sun and yet not see the sunlight, but only the anguish and despair of their emotional suf- fering which indeed hurts physically, mentally and spiritually. Such is the nature of deep dark- ness, the inescapable result of sin. But a person illuminated in the divine light can stand out under the midnight sky and see perfectly, hence the answer: ìAnd as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? Jesus an- swered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.

The constant theme of sin and fallen human nature runs through the scriptures like an unbroken thread cover to cover, as does repentance from sin, and the consequences thereof. Just as a powerful volcanic erup- tion blackens sunlight over many miles on end, consuming everything in its path, and bring- ing total devastation upon the land, so too does an incredibly vast swarm of locusts consume everything in its path not made of iron or stone. Even in recent times, locust swarms have been reported measuring thousands of square miles, so innumerable that when deep trenches were dug and fires set, these were filled and extinguished by the locust bodies dropping from the blackened sky. A locust can jump two hundred times its body length, and cover wide spaces, but it canít guide its own flight, so swarms are carried by the wind like a black cloud of desolation, released to the ground wherever providence deems fit. This combined Niagara falls-like noise of the locusts in the air, and those devouring the vegetation on the ground, is said by witnesses to be almost deafening. As the Egyptian plagues came not without cause, the plague of locusts in Revelation 9 is at- tached to those not having the seal of the Gods in their foreheads. The locustís lifespan is typi- cally about five months (mar/apr thru jul/aug), while summer crops are growing for the har- vest to store up for winter. Notably John the Baptist was conceived exactly five months before his first cousin Jesus (Luke 1:24,36ff), and both were born exactly five months apart, 1 Nisan 3758 (Sun 17 Mar 3 BC; JD 1720403), and 1 Elul 3758 (Mon 12 Aug 3 BC; JD 1720551), respectively. That John ate locusts and wild honey (Mat 3:4;Mar 1:6) is an interesting coinci- dence. The scorpion is the archetype of Mars superior & courtyard of Death, the process, sting, pain, and suffering of death, the wages of sin (Rom 6:23). The ìtail-starî on the caelestial ser- pent Draco, Thuban (13Leo +66), is commonly called the ìcoiled oneî, ìwhipî, or ìbruiseî on the heel of Orion, Osiris the universal archetype of Plutoís reign (Gen 3:15), just as Dracoís head-star, Rastaban (17Sco +75), rules over or guides its tail.

Note, Alnitak marks the caelestial end of life, Taurus, at opposition to the caelestial end of death, Scorpio, marked by Shaula (laSco 29Sco47í -13:47í; mag. 1.63), and Grumium (xiDra 29Sco56í +80:17í; mag. 3.75), approaching the beginning of the tree of life, the galactic center (SgrA* 2Sag03í -5:36í), and galactic-ecliptic intercept (5Sag00í +0:00í), also known as Mayan Sacred Tree. At the center of the iris, the eye of the sky, is Pluto, God of the underworld. Hence Orion, a.k.a.

The famous Herculean myth is among the most powerful known to man. By completing the twelve labors successfully, his great strength and courage would become synonymous with his name. With twelve synodic years of obedient service and twelve labors under his belt, Hercules became an Olympian god and placed among the stars. Only his immortality had saved him from the serpentís bite. Unlike Hercules, the myth holds that Orion died on account of the Scorpionís deadly sting. While the scorpionís sting in Palestine is seldom deadly, though is extremely painful, the scor- pions of North Africa often exceed six inches long, and their sting is usually a death sen- tenceóa painful one.

Re- member, the universal archetypes develop in the heavens, and manifest in the world through physical living. At opposition, at the end of life, soul is entering Gemini the archetypal Magician, chief communicator among the Gods. And, out of the white oblivion, soul regathers its needful journey, its heavenly lesson therein. Meanwhile its former physical body is reclaimed by the Earth at the end of life upon entering the court of the Knight of Swords. And Earth remembers for that soulís future incarnations, to continue its Earthly sojourn and development, and the cycle goes on. The scorpions of Palestine whose sting causes unimaginably excruciating pain is seldom deadly, but its hapless victim surely wishes for death. The innumerable locusts devouring all in sight, to inflict terrible pain on men whose chakra in the brow is insecureóvulnerable to the torment imposed by the serpentís deceptive biteómeaning to put self above others, to put self-will above Godís will, the fall of man. So the pain of being born into mortal life, the pain of living, the pain of dying until the moment of clinical death brings deliverance from physical pain and sufferingópains of every kind that a mortal man can suffer, emotional, and physical, mental, spiritual, every curse on the fallen man, - - -these are the plagues and agonies, the wages of human sin. Thatís what the fifth trumpet is heralding, the ire of God. Johnís description of these locusts also reminds us of the Apache, Comanche, and other military helicopters, which do indeed sound like ìchariots of horses charging into battleî etc., and their fierce looks arouse the ancient archetypes of locust swarms with the wholesale de- struction they bring. Maybe man developed the helicopter in honor of the locusts, since the locust is a formidable, and indomitable creature. Since manís the only species on Earth capable of rebellion against Godís will, the charging horses as used in warfare since time immemorial evokes our unique ability to destroy the world against Godís willói.e. if God didnít intervene.

Being created in the image & likeness of the Godsóthe rulers of their respective planes or spheres of superconscious energyóthe ideal human soulmate, mind-mate and body-mate is collectively archetypal through every octave of energy from zero to infinity, limited only by ones spiritual, mental and physical development. Karmic bonds among and between incarnating souls perpetuate these quintessential archetypes, the develop- ing elemental ideals of the human race, naturally universal, locally manifested. All our hopes, all our dreams, all we aspire to, manifests by the laws enabling each octave, each iris of development compassing its triune, diatonic, and chromatic wavelengths in due time. Each heavenís rules or boundaries necessarily limit such manifestations accordingly as our divine ideals filter down into corporeal experience. Because human awareness spans every octave by varying degrees from the pit of Hell to the apex of Mt.

Externally, there are others with whom we are connected through col- lective karma (and that is the joy of life, to be connected with others). Thatís why mortal life is hell in one sense, and afterlife is hell in quite another. Such separations were never made be- fore the fall, but the ERROR of our ways was our undoing, such that the hell of each life and afterlife is tabulated. Conversely, the pleasures and ecstasies of bodily life are the hells of the discarnated soul. One longs for the other, yet neither soul or body longs for the karma awaiting both. Likewise, heavenly consciousnesses are available in life & afterlife. The measure of ones in- ner courtyard is what survives death of the body, our treasures, or ìgolden applesî stored up in heavenówhat soul draws upon in both life and the afterlife. The outer court is for mortal ex- perience in the body, the ìvulnerableî nature of the gentiles. This is not anything to do with being a ìjewî or ìgentileî in what is become a bigoted misconstruance among wholly the latter. Rather, there is ones merciful spirit and ones of judgment, our spirit of giving and spirit of taking. There is a time for both, in due season. Every situation has a give & take, & this polar- ity-reversal of consciousness is two witnesses. One is the self; & the other is the other self. Understand? The temple of the Godsóthe heavensówithin are where freewill is asserted via worship therein. Ab-Ram means ìfather-exaltedî, where Ab [Heb. \u000b\t , ìabî] means father, ruler, or chief, the first.

Just as Apollo is the ìsonî of day, Saturn is called the ìsonî of night, the son of darkness whom we call Satan, the Grim Reaper, the Scythe of the harvest, which cuts-off and dispatches. Hence for every sabbath of days, these are composed of six days for creative activity followed by the seventh day of rest, to reflect upon that which is created.

Thatís a long way from ìsleepingî in the psychic sense, but is rest from the living physical body. Yet, this whole time weíre active to the nth in the psy- che, i.e. our discarnate soul sojourning among the planetary heavens innately in their univer- sal archetype. The dead sleep in the crystalline memory of Earth. Thatís the resurrection, the first body by the elements of the Earth. The first death is the fall of man, to eat disobediently of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. These deaths are whatís resurrected, from the be- ginning. Thus in Christ are multitudes resurrected from the dead. Not as we think of death in our present mortal body, but the eternal body which was from the beginning, remembered in the akasa. Now the measure of the temple and the altar is to cardinal directions first. Facing east, the right hand points south for the exaltation of Mars. The left hand points north for the exalta- tion of Jupiter, and Saturn is behind us exalted in the west. When we take all six directions along the ìxî, ìyî & ìzî axis, which are Height, Depth, East, West, South, & North, then the seven planets (out to Saturn) and twelve labors of the planetary zodiac combine to form eighty-four key signatures of the Gods, which is thoroughly charted in my previous books, particularly in chapter 9 of ìMinís Compleat Tarot Manualî, and chapter 3 of ìMinís Light & Soundî where these 84 key signatures are expanded into decans and pentads.

Just as Nebuchadnezzar had conquered Jerusalem & destroyed the temple, and took many of her inhabitants captive to Babylonia, Nebuchadnezzar was afflicted for seven seasons in a state of animal-like rabidity, in retribution for his unwarranted pride and futile vanity [Dan 4:16]. 42 months or 42 Moons is commensurate with 3 Ω years in the lunisolar- tropical-day calendar common to the ancient world. This calendar added an intercalary month every two to three years, as Iíve meticulously charted in ìMinís Historical Calendar Of Jesusî chapter 1, which describes exactly how & why this was done: http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=16I98O2S37876.5620949074@anonymous.poster The New Moon of every twelfth month (Addaru) or thirteenth month (AddaruII) was gen- erally near the vernal equinox and was the usual time for consulting the oracle. More or less equivalent to the Roman month of February, or month of the ìinfernal godsî being always shy of 29.53 daysóor the average period for one synodic lunation of the Moon, i.e., unlike the other eleven tropical-solar day months which have either 30 or 31 days apiece. Since thereíre almost exactly 235 mean-lunations each 19 mean-tropical years (i.e. 2 hrs. 5 min. & 4 sec. longer than 19 mean-tropical years), every 3 Ω lunisolar calendar years averages out to about 43.29 mean-lunations (ancient astronomers used 29 days, 12 hours and 793 parts average per lunation; i.e. 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes 3 1/3 seconds) or about 29.5306 mean solar days per average lunation. Thatís approximately 1278 days every 3 Ω lunisolar calendar years over the long-term averages, since the tropical year averages 365.2422 days per year by the Mayan long count. While itís good to be precise in our terms, the point of these 3 Ω years in pro- phetic context, or 3 Ω days for that matter, emphasizes the midst of the week in both days and yearsóin which Christ was crucified, the actual day numbered fourth of seven i.e. Mercuryís Day, and the actual liturgical year being 3791óin the midst of that year, and in the midst of that month Nisan 14, in the midst of Jesusí seven-year ministry, which commenced three & one half years before, about the third hour (9 AM) Jesus was baptised (1 Tishri 3788, Sat 20 Sep 27 AD). So in realtime calendar days, thatís 1,313 days into Jesusí ministry that he was crucified, even at the same hour. Because 3788 and 3791 were both intercalary leap-years, 385 + 353 + 354 + 221 = 1313 real-time calendar days from baptism to crucifixion.

Prophecy is centered on the ministry, crucifixion, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Thatís why timeóchronologyóis im- portant, so very important to the measure of the temple of the Gods. As with Gemini, our witness is mortal our brother immortal. In measuring the temple, we see the heavens by angular perspective, i.e. from our own relative position in space and time. While perspective changes noticeably when viewing objects nearby from changing vantage points, more distant objects donít change in their appearance so readily. The closest stars be- yond our own solar system appear fixed to the naked eye from any location on Earth. Even rapid Barnardís Star (V799-Oph just six lightyears away at magnitude 9.54), which red dwarf (var. m4-m5) has the largest proper motion of any distant sun visible through a telescope, V799-Ophiuchus, even if it could be seen by the unaided eye, appears to move about 4 eclip- tic degrees longitude per century, or about 2.5 minutes per yearóergo barely noticeable over an entire year (cf. V799-Oph 4Sag35í +28:06í J2000 to 8Sag33í 28:23í circa 12 UT 1-Jan- 2100; amateurs note RA/Dec motion is only about 10 sec per year). However, all stars visible to the naked eye appear fixed, no parallax or motion to us mere mortals. For example, view the Orion demo on this URL: http://www.astro.ubc.ca/~scharein/a311/a311.html Scroll down to the ìProper Motionî icon, click on it, then select ìOrionî.

Let it go ten seconds, or about 100,000 years into the future. Note how ìAlnitakî, the Great Pyramid star, is the only star of Orionís ìbeltî which appears visibly to move, into caelestial Gemini from its J2000 position of 29Tau54í -25:18í. I.e., the greatest man-made monument ever built upon the Earth signifies that there will be no more death. In this sense, while I should express my disillusionment with the human race, as we have collectively digressed from wisdom & intelligence since we built the pyramids circa 10,500 BC, nevertheless weíve all gained much experience since then even to the advent, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ; the universal archetype of there will be no more death is made self-evident. Consider how visible the stars are. They could be obscured by clouds in outer space just beyond our solar system, but they arenít. Just the opposite deep space is a near-vacuum, hence the crystal clarity of the Hubble Space Telescope is world-renowned, seeing some 15-billion lightyears into the deep field, limited not by ìcloud-coverî but rather by the reality of deep space which is misconstrued by implausible theories indefinitely supported by pseudorational academia.

Biblically, pairs of prophets are given prominence, foremost being John the Baptist & his first cousin Jesus Christ, Elijah & Elisha, Joshua & Zerubbabel, & so on down the line. Quoting Zechariah: ìAnd said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof: And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereofÖ Then said he, These are the two anoin ted ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.î ó Zechariah 4:2- 3,14 AV Here the word ìLordî was translated from the Hebrew ì \u0006\u0004\u000e \t î, Adonai, the superior aspect of Aphrodite who waits for her beloved Adonis to rise from the dead, i.e. the hope of the world: the physical, mental, and spiritual advent of Jesus Christ in time, in fact, in reality. Adonai holds hope for the resurrection of the dead on the word of Godís faithful witness (cf. John 5:24ff), the pattern of life, i.e. Jesus. This is truly the mystical marriage in spirit, mind & body, as Adonis & Adonai arenít two separately but are ONE flesh. This ties directly to Danielís prophecy of 2300 evenings & mornings, that the average grand synodic multiple of Venus is 1151 tropical Earth-years per 1871 avg. sidereal orbits of Venus, and is 720 mean-synodic orbital periods of Venus, as the Babylonian astrologersó including Danielówere very well aware. Iíve reported this in detail many times before. Reiterating, for each 1871 times that Venus orbits the Sun, then around 1151 years have passed, and Venus has appeared in about the same place relative to the Earth & Sun around 720 times over this same 1151-year periodÖlike clockwork. Whatís even more important is the reference to evening and morning. Superior is first, death of the body, soul living in heaven. Inferior is second, the second death, the death of soulís angelic planetary sojourn being cast down to the Earth incarnate in the mortal body precisely to experience evil temporized, i.e. soul-incarnate in time which Shaitan rules, the Scythe. Hence, the all-too familiar Grim Reaper referring to man, whose evening-morning of creation is for Venus, the sixth day of creation or six points of creation.

Up until this point, just entering chapter 11 of Revelation, familiar tenets of Judeo-Xianity in light of judicial astrology, classic mythology & archetypal psychology have brought us to a comfortable plateau upon which to reflect on what is known thus far. From hereon, more will be expected of the reader, and of this author. We, the Olympians & Titans, are at WAR! The templeís outer court is for the vulnerable, and is not to be measured by the invulnerable in Christ. Every mortal man is vulnerableóergo gentileóby the wages of sin. Jews in the spiritual sense are invulnerable, meaning all souls faithful unto death are in spirit Hebrewsó out of whom salvation is, keepers of the oracles. The outer court is like the inferior conjoins of Quetzalcoatl rushing forth in sin, the superior conjoins of the inner temple returning by the grace of God. There is a balance, as Jupiter exalts in the courtyard of our lives as ancestors who is ruled by Hekate, most noticeable in the AM daylight hours, so Saturn exalts in the house of othersóruled by Adonai, mainly noticeable after sunset. The One sees into the past from our future & the Other sees into the future from our pastói.e., comprehending wholly of the present. The ìforty-two monthsî that the vulnerable (sinners) trample on the sanctified city is counted from the day Jesus was crucified. This city is the withering habitation of the vulnerable, like the withering altar in the midst of Egypt, the Great Alnitak Pyramid and its neighboring monumental antiquities. Speaking of whichÖ Remember the seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine shown Pharaoh in a clairvoyant dream interpreted by Joseph in Genesis chapter 41? Edgar Cayce said this was circa 5500 BC since thatís about when Joseph died [Ex 1:6], and is but one of hundreds of biblical examples of how the number seven is so very important to the imperfect and perfect issue of time and events, meaning the full completion of short-term temporal events, and long-term manifestation of prophecy in the chain of events.

If not, weíre liable to find ourselves in a world of anguish and torment, of regret and despair. By preparing for the consummation of prophecy, we are more likely to survive it. By storing our treasures in heaven ìwhere neither moth nor rust doth corruptî[Mt 6:20], they are always there for us in our times of greatest need. So, how do we prepare for the days between the present and around 2331 AD, before which year all things are fulfilled? These days are shortened, but by how much no one knows [Mt 24:21-22; Mr 13:19-20]. So itís a good idea to be prepared for this, the greatest tribulation in the history of humankind.

This synodic multiple repeated every 251 years following 281 AD to 1787 AD, and will repeat again October 18, 2038 AD, and again October 18, 2289, by which time Venus will have gone full circle relative to Earth from the far side of the Sun fully 1413 times. Therefore, because Daniel the prophet reported 2300 years from the crucifixion [Dan 8:11-14], then 31 AD + 2300 years = 2331 AD, exactly twice Venusí synodic-sidereal multiple for superior & inferior conjoins, as previously noted. Since Venusí nearest superior conjoin prior to the crucifixion was in Oct 30 AD, then we should expect 1151 + 1151 = 2302 tropical years after 30 AD to see Venus completing its 1440th (twice 720) synodic multiple, around the same place on Earthís caelestial sphere (near the same stars) as she was Sunday October 20, 30 AD Gregorian.

Furthermore, we know that Venus will have made nearly 1440 orbits over this 2302-year period since 30 AD. Subtracting 2289 AD from 2332 AD leaves but 43 years for Venus to make 27 synodic orbits to the Earth. This comes out to a little over two days shy of Venusí average synodic orbit of 583.9 days, or 2.218 multiplied by 27 equals very nearly 60 days, which directly accounts for the two-month difference after counting 2302 tropical Earth-years & 1440 synodic orbits & 3742 sidereal orbits of Venus, this calculation as follows:"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Minís Concise Commentary 196 Julian Day 2573158.41361 - Julian Day 1732309.91767 --------------------------- = 840848.49594 days A difference of merely 2 months out of about 28,000 is not bad at all simply working with ancient long-term multiples which are certain to vary somewhat from short-term observa- tionsÖleast of all for Venus, more for the other planets. But most if not all students of prophecy are not concerned with such fine points of astro- nomical accuracy, but merely with how and when it is going to change his or her life in the short-term, & affect future lifetimes in the long-term. The recurring theme of prophecy emphasizes our deliverance from evil, and ones personal and collective responsibility to actively participate in it life after life, death after death. To see the big picture, as Jupiter sees expansively, augmentative, at great distances with the eyes of an eagle. The better we can see at a distance, then the further down the road weíre able to look, whether traveling into the future or into the past. For example, when time traveling to ones own past, we canít experience it from our present consciousness, but only from that particular state we were in at the time being remembered. We can always reflect on our past experience and interaction with others from a present perspective but we can never go back without let- ting go of all that has transpired since. The same principle goes for seeing into ones future ex- perience and interaction with others. The chain of events is only clearly visible from our con- sciousness in that experience. Anyone with clairvoyance, clairaudience or clairsentience knows from experience that the future most often reveals itself in dreams and visions. All too often, the elements of such dreams and visions are unrecognizable until during or well-after the fact. Memory doesnít always spring to the surface, or even when it does it usu- ally takes some time for our subconscious to process the information and consciously recog- nize its associations with such foreordained experiences and personalities weíve teracted with since the time of our original dreams and/or visions. Conversely, when weíve had a clairvoyant dream or vision it is usually immediately recognized for what it is, just not what it means. That comes later, when events transpireóthat is unless the vision is received in the spirit of prophecy.

As Venus is crowned with the twelve universal signs of the zodiac in the major arcana, so too is Mother Earth crowned with the twelve terrestrial ensigns of an adjudicated horoscope, the minor arcana, the temporal, and resurrection to life everlasting, the covenant, bow, or iris in the eye of the Sky. When we think of treasures in heaven, we think of the 22 sacred letters, i.e. major arcanaóletters Chaldaic.

This war began in the Garden of Eden, and is fought in the Airóby the ele- ments or electromagnetic force of Consciousness in the Heavens and is, thereby, fighting in the Earth. This nearly 200,000 years-old conflagration is between our ìfleshly lusts which war against the soulî [1Pet 2:11], or: ìFrom whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts which war in your members? ..know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?Ö Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.î ó James 4:1ff AV The devil is self. Resist self, and self shall become your servant. Resist not the self, and self becomes your master. The World signifies the benefic forces of Saturn returning in superior aspect. Temperance, Aquarius is Saturn rushing forth malefic by inferior aspectówhich is benefic for his heavenly father Ouranos (Uranus), Star in the major arcana. Capricorn is Disci- pline, hence the exaltation of Mars. And Aquarius is Inspiration, poured out from the vessel of new beginnings, the universe, hence the exaltation of the mind.

This shimmeringly-beautiful evening light is female to man in the masculine genderóthe eternal beauty of Venus & the temporal beauty on Earth as we experience mortal life here- IN the mortal body of our existence. The amazement we feel when observing the natural landscape of any wilderness setting is therefore no less beautiful and astonishing. These appreciations for beauty which we experience are always in concert with our love of Venus i.e. our passion for beauty. Subsequently whatís manmade celebrates that natural beauty in the best of times, the golden bull, and the opposite of which is the scorpion, death. Every heaven, even Earth, is envious of our soul-incarnate the body. Death be not proud. Recall from chapter 9 that Dracoís ìhead-starî Rastaban in 17Sco rules over or guides its tail-star, Thuban, and that the Scorpionís ìsting-starî Shaula in 29Sco almost exactly conjuncts the dragonís beguiling ìmouth-starî Grumium with over 94 caelestial degrees latitude between them (conjunct means longitude only, while conjoined means both longitude and latitude must be in close angular proximity). Note how the dragonís seven authoritative heads & ten horns compare to the next chapterís opening verse[Rev 13:1], where these ten horns now have the diadems of authority with its seven heads whose names are now called blasphemous(cf. Rev 17:3). It is written ìNot you shall take the name of the Dominant one of the Gods yours in vainî [Exodus 20:1-23]. So we see blasphemy originates not with the Gods but within the soul of man. Remember from where you fell? Hereís a Cayce quote: ì(Q) In Rev. 12 we find the symbols of the Woman, Dragon and Child. Do these represent the part played by souls in the crea- tion and fall of man?

(A) As has just been given, as is understood by those here, there is first - as is the spiritual concept - the spiritual rebellion, be- fore it takes mental or physical form.

This is a beautiful statement that ìthe dragon is standing in front of the womanÖthat as soon as to be born the son of hers him to devourî. Alas, the horoscope!

Who Jesus is, heís inside everyone of us, yet itís not enough to know this (see James 2:17-24). The lowly prophet Edgar Cayce frequently harped on the subject of Will over ones astro- logically-inherent subjugation to the planetary cards that weíre dealtóin accordance with our karma & destiny. No, not blatantly opposed, but rather subtly differentiated. Very near to- gether. Nearly together in both purpose and substance. But WILL alone dictates the variance. Ones willingness to put faith in Jesus Christ is not so much to ask, but is the quality, the pu- rity of will as a matter of ones conscientiousness that makes the grade. Meaning, our personal actions testify to our faith in \u0001\u0003\u0001\u0006 . Numerologically, the number 42 is 6 x 7, Jupiter by Saturn, and is also 4 + 2 = 6, the num- ber of Jupiter. In the Greek lots or Arabic parts, the angular relationship between the two larg- est of the jovian giants refers to Siblings by the astrological equation Asc - Sat + Jup(N), Death of Parents Asc - Sat + Jup(Y), and Children & Life Asc - Jup + Sat(Y). The youngest progeny of the elder Titan Saturn, is Jupiter. Keep in mind who Saturn is, Kronos, Father Time. While his son Jupiter is Zeus, Emperor & Father of the Olympian Gods. Remember also that the Titans & the Olympians are like two sharply contrasting, vehemently opposing viewpoints by the very same ten planets! Iíve covered this in detail already. Suffice to say that the LORD giveth & the LORD taketh away. While 42 months is the midst of the week, 84 months is the consummation of the sabbatic year, which is 7 x 12 meaning 2 x 7 x 6 = 84. Also, 8 + 4 = 12, thus 1 + 2 = 3, which is the number of Venus, the triune number of man, the trinity- incarnate, as soul, mind & body, which together is the temple of the living God: The Father, Son & Holy Ghost, which is Crea- tor, Sustainer & Destroyer respectively. Jesus said: ìHe that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad. Wherefore I say unto you, All man- ner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.î ó Matthew 12:30-32 AV The holy destroyer, the avenging angel as the apostle Paul quotes from Deuteronomy 32:35 in his epistle toward Romans 12:19, one of the most famous quotes from the bible to wit ìVengeance is mine; I shall repay, saith the Lordî.

Because Judeo-Xianity is so strongly rooted in the ancient Hebrew-Egyptian mindset of the scholarly priest, Ra-Moses, then the central theme of the Adamic fall from the bite of the ser- pent, meaning humans are led into temptation by the beguiling which proceeds from the ser- pentís mouth, a river of temptation to the soulís worldly experience in the body. Hence the Earthís mouth, meaning the voice of Mnemosyne or the akasic Memory of the Earth-Mother, mother of the voice of heaven, of the Nine Muses or sidereal diatonic modality of the seven planets out to Saturn, then the three mothers adding the eighth Alpha, then the ninth Beta in the octave below middle C, then finally the tenth who is Mnemosyne at the center of our hu- man hearing and Pluto at the center of the Earth, at the center of heaven ergo the throne of Zeus.

The kings of the East, South, North, West. Over many millennia, these kings have come and gone. Since the final destruction of Atlantis circa 10,700-10,100 BC so says Cayce, Egypt took the reigns, and civi- lizations flourished radially therefrom. By the late 1st century AD some 28,000 years into this post-diluvian world, the Egypto-Babylonian kings had long-since emerged and declined, yielding to the Medo-Persians, then the Greeks, then finally to the Romans. As strength and weakness, severity and wisdom donít mix together, so too is the Roman Empire divided not only by her eastern & western ìlegsî [Dan 2:31ff], but by her ìfeetî of iron & clay. The title ìking of kingsî was awarded Artaxerxes [Ezra 7:12] and Nebuchadnezzar [Ezekiel 26:7, Daniel 2: 37], which is most conspicuous considering that prophecies of Daniel refer to the priestly scribe Ezra in Dan 9:24-27 going forth with Artaxerxesí edict and Nebu- chadnezzar, the defender of the crown, was the greatest king of Babylon in her heyday.

It is clear the division between the old Roman empire and the present which has clearly conquered the whole Earthóall 7 continents! The Greco- Roman influence is everywhere in the world. The Latin language completely dominates law & order, science & religion in the western leg of this Roman Empire. The USA is indisputably the global leader in money and war.

Meaning, we must respect every human beingís faith in \u0001\u0003\u0001\u0006 , irrespective of race, creed & color. Faith in God is faith in God in any language. All humans are created in His likeness and image. That is why the USA is destined to succeed, ergo we know all men are created equal in the sight of God. And yes, Moscow became safe haven for Romeís eastern ìlegî; until recently the bastion of Atheism, and much oppressionÖ As old Rome declined and divided from the new Rome of Constantinople in 395 AD, the latter prospered exceedingly and continued as capital of the Roman Empireís eastern leg for more than a thousand years, until she fell to the Turks in 1453 AD. At that point a new capital city for the Roman Empireís eastern leg was needed. Since the Tartars under Genghis Khan had sacked Kiev in 1240, with its collapse under Mongol rule, the metropolitan head of the Russian Orthodox Church had moved northeast to Moscow, called the ì3rd Romeî by the late fifteenth century AD when Ivan III put the two-headed Byzantine Imperial Eagle on the offi- cial, Muscovite coat of arms, and assumed title of Tsar, CÊsar. A council of Russian bishops in 1551 AD under Tsar Ivan the Terrible took the role as capital of the Roman Empireís eastern leg. After 476 AD, when the old capital of the Roman Empire had fallen to the Goth invaders under the barbarian ruler Odoacer, the western leg of the Roman Empire went through many schisms, wars, famines, pestilences, expansions, and power struggles. The Empireís ancient schism between east & west legs was made official by 1054 AD. Yet through it all, the word of God, the gospel and testimony of Jesus was carried to every corner of the Earth, and in every language hereof. After the Bolshevik revolution in 1917 and formation of an atheistic Union of Soviet Social- ist Republics in 1922, and renaming St. Petersburg to Leningrad two years later, this failed experiment in heretical communism crumbled like the iron curtain it had built. Thus the east- ern & western legs of the Roman Empire never really did fall per se, but both experienced tremendous sociopolitical upheavals over these last, nearly two millennia since the crucifixion of Christ.

This fourth empire is only similar to the first three, since it built on top of these bygone empiresónot wholly separated from them in time. For example, the new testament appeared originally codified in Greek. Greek words or etymons still frequently appear through our English dictionary. Thereíre three major influences on the western world, Greek, Hebrew and Roman. Much moreso than language, but in law, politics and social order. Every ancient culture shared some common ancestry and influence from those who went be- fore them. It is above all, the Greco-Roman influence on western history which shaped the world we know today. Even eastern nations are gradually being absorbed into this modern Roman Empire by the politics of an oil-based global economy. The US and our allies are now fighting a GLOBAL war on terror, really the final crusade of this new world order against infi- dels. The strength of the Sun to Earth is Leo, sustainer of Fire, which is the strong nuclear force. Hence the lion with the wings of an eagle symbolizes the post-diluvian founding of Babel by Nimrod, Orion, and the long-lasting Babylonian Empire which lasted better than 20,000 years before the book of Daniel was written. The head of gold tried in the fires of time is much re- fined, and its eagleís wings carries the sustained influence of this empire into the Neo- Babylonian world and beyond. The head is ego-self, or creator of Fire, the malefic aspect of Mars rushing forth conquering in sin. Traditional associations of human body parts with signs of the zodiac are extant from clas- sic Greek literature. These are likewise associated with every aspect of numbering and order apparent in the body, mind and soul. I.e. 12 cranial nerve pairs, 12 rib pairs, 12 chromosome"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Chapter 13 207 pairs, etc. There are other readily apparent associations, 7 major & 5 minor rib pairs, 7 major & 5 minor cranial pairs, 7 major & 5 minor chromosome pairs, etc. Similarly the number 22 pops up in the human body such as 22 autosomes in the human genome. Consider also the two pairs of phalanges, five digits each on the hands and feet, making ten and ten like the planets rushing forth and returning. Or the seven primary openings on the human head, 2 eyes, 2 ears, 2 nostrils, and 1 mouth. And 2 more openings common to male & female, the anus, and urethra. Only the female has the twelfth opening, or vulva, leading to the uterus through the vagina, the receptor for male semens, which the male discharges through his ure- thra. Thus, considering the male & female joined together as one flesh, then thereís a total of 23 openings in one COMPLETE human body. Recall from chap. 7 ìthe nucleus of most hu- man cells contains two sets of chromosomes, one by each parent. Each set has 23 single chro- mosomesî. So thereís the number 23. Many other coincidences & synchronicities can be found.

Jesus Christ was crucified to be then healed of his deadly wounds he is. Not to find in that yet, withering sepulcher, but Jesus is alive. Not there, not here but wheresoever he will to be, there he will be. Mans own vision of Jesus may or may not be synchronous with the aforesaid. Zeus gives & gives & gives! Do that, & be in sync. Anything, everything else is asynchronous with the same. You see, this beast is of mans own device. No agency of heaven ever contrived the beast in timeóif not by rebellion to wit.

These nuclear strikesíll be in revenge against terrorist strikes here in the USÖChina may play a pivotal role in all this. But before attempting to paint an unduly bleak picture of the Roman Empireís & her USAís role in bringing about such changes as are necessary to fulfill these myriad prophecies, re- member that the basis of mother Church and her empire is the gospel of Christ crucified. Even with all the evils of evildoers around the world,óof every nation, religion and people,óthere can be no doubt that the power of Christ is more than sufficient to overcome even death itself. On the down side, however, the exacting efficiency of retribution will leave no stone un- turned, and no thought, word or deed however good or evil un-Judged. And thatís why the destruction of the fourth empire & every worldly thing upon which it is built must occur. As in Jerusalem 70 AD, the city is razed flat to the ground, the worldly temple built with human hands is burnt and toppled to the groundówith not one stone left upon another. Picture this almost worldwide and you get the idea. The world is headed for trouble, big BIG TROUBLE!

Zion, the Hebraic equivalent of Mt. Olympus. The twelve tribes of Israel number realtime solar Earth-days, nearly 400 years in round numbers. The closest, synodic- sidereal multiples are solar eclipse totality at 410 years, and Jupiterís synodic multiple, at 36 sidereal ~ 391 mean-synodic ~ 427 tropical years. Remember, each day is the day-book of the Gods, the ephemeris. This journal is the journey, and vice versa. It is time-in-space, and space- in-time, respectively. Notably, the Mayan baktun of 144,000 days (see ch 7; see also Minís Planetary Awareness Technique ch 10) is comprised of 20 katun of 7,200 days each. Each katun in turn is comprised of 20 tun, with each tun equal to exactly 360 solar days each. Re- call that in astronomical theory, before the fall of man circa 200,000 BC there were exactly 360 solar days per year, and there were exactly 30 solar days per lunar month. With the fall of man the Earthís axis tilted obliquely to the ecliptic, and the Moonís orbit became exceedingly per- turbed. The Mayans called the remaining 5.2422 days per mean tropical the ìfive bad daysî. Since the Mayans had mastered the long-term astronomical prediction of Earthís precession to her caelestial firmament, it follows that the Mayanís idea of preserving the long-count in ex- pectancy of Jesus Christ was very much divinely-inspired and furthermore shows that they had superior knowledge of astronomy & sacred geometry. Having the name of Zeus, ìGod givesî, written in mans forehead means to be jovially- attuned with Godís giving spirit. In good times itís easy. In difficult times itís difficult at best. Even so, it is still doable. Just ask the unlucky Xians who were burnt alive to light the Roman Colosseum at nightómany of whom openly gave thanks to God as they were burning at the pleasure of heartless Roman spectators. The intensely excruciating pain of death by fire is swift, yet these hapless casualties of persecution found time to give thanks to God with their dying breath. Same went for those who were fed to the lions else were forced to fight in the games. Not a pretty picture to be sure, but you know where these Xian martyrs ended up upon the death of their bodies? In the bosom of Abraham. As for the Roman crowds, where do you think they ended up? Afar off, i.e. on the far side of Chaos. But such lines of demarcation are hardly clear. The ideal that all Xians go to heaven and all anti-Xians go to hell is flawed, distorted by the fact of each individualís God-given freewill. For example I suspect that many of the Roman spectators held their tongues in fear of meeting the same lamentable fate as did whole families of Xians. These souls were severely aghast at the hideous specter of Xians of all ages being brutally tortured, and murdered en masse. No wonder they had vomitoriums. Iím surprised they did not have ìsuiciditoriumsî to handle the masses of the suicidal.

Thus the great voice from heaven is harmonious, like the sound of well-tuned strings in harmony with this tremendous and pow- erful hymnodyóverily the muse of Saturn. These myriads who stand with Jesus have undying faith in his testimony much as ìthe word of the LORD came unto Ab-Ramî[Gen 15:1], and the veracity of his faith was put to the ultimate test [Gen 22:1ff]. These souls who stand with the lamb have demonstrated their faith by works. This ìevangelî who is transiting the local meridian on the ecliptic is preaching the gospel to every living person on the inhabited Earth, to each according to his or her local meridian of geographical longitude in realtime. The crisis (Gk. \u0004\r\b\u0007\b\t ) is the time of separation, the time of Saturn, the Scythe of Judgment. This evangel ìis saying in a great voice Be you fearing Zeus and be you giving unto him honor, because it is coming the hour of the judgment of his, and be you adoring him who is making the heaven and the earth, and the sea and the fonts of wa- tersî [Rev 14:7]. To ìhonorî Zeus means to be a giving person in every way that you can. To ìfearî God means to know that his word is true, that he ìshall bring every work into judgmentÖwhether it be good, or whether it be evilî [Ecclesiastes 12:13-14]. More important still is the spirit of Godís law, that we donít avoid doing bad things for fear of divine retribu- tion but rather we focus on the good things of God, and know that all good comes from Him. This is a happy thing, jovial like Jupiter.

Whether itís lust for flesh, lust for gold, lust for power, lust for blood, or lust for anything, it means los- ing self- control and self-respect, and incur the wrath of the Gods! The symbolic imagery of ìfumes of the torment of them into the ages of the ages it is as- cending, and notÖhaving rest day and nightî refers to the unrepentant soulís affliction in the afterlife, where DantÈesque visions of Hades and the immense Abyss of no return evoke either acceptance or fear in each soul looking thereon. The term ìArmageddonî[Ch 16], comes from the Hebrew ìHar-Megiddonî which literally means ìmountain of the place of crowdsî, more popularly known as a place of great slaughter, since many ancient battles had been fought on its great plain of Esdraelon. So Armageddon refers more to wars and slaughter than to eternal hellfire, ergo the war of ten sidereal years between Michael & Satan, between Jupiter & Sat- urn, between giving & taking. Thereís a valley where rubbish was burned continually, & hu- man sacrifices were made as idolatrous Jews burned their children alive in fire stoves called ìtophetî to Moloch and Baal in the valley of Hinnom [ref. 2Ch 28:3;33:6. Jer 7:31;19:2-6]. Hence this part of the valley of Hinnom (Hebrew Ge-Hinnom) became popularly known as the place of everlasting destruction by eternal fire, symbolic of the punishments in Hades, rendered ìSheolî in the old testament sixty-five instances. Since Sheol or Hades is universally known as the afterlife in which souls are entreated in the same way that they had treated others while living, then it follows that the punishments and rewards of the afterlife are just and deserved. Those who treated others unjustly, they will be so treated unjustly. Those who lived justly theyíll be treated justly. Itís like a perfect ìlet the punishment fit the crimeî system of justice. Those who practice the Golden Rule will do just fine. For those who do not, itís not a pretty picture. Those who die in the jovial spirit of Jupiter are happy to be dead, happy to rest from their labors, and knowing that their works in life do follow them into the afterlife, i.e. Mnemosyne remembers, and their next incarnation will ìpick upî in the spiritual sense where their last life ìleft offî at the time and place of their death.

This chap- ter is a compendium of old testament verses, like ìRobertsonís Word Pictures in the New Tes- tament, Volume 6î (freeware on http://www.onlinebible.net/downloads.html ) is so meticulous in pointing out citing chapter & verse where applicable. I like the reference at Rev 15:3, which states: ìJohn thus combines in Hebraic tone the expressions of the old and new in the song to the Glorified Messiahî The victory over death pales in comparison to the glory we sing to our heavenly Father the Emperor and King of heaven. His sea is crystalline, Mnemosyne. We stand upon His Earth, singing in His sidereal modes by transposing in His twelve horoscopic keys of life {kudos to Stevie Wonder, (c) 1976}. The ìcitharasî weíre playing signify our attunement to the music of the spheres, helping us to sing on key and in concert with the divine orchestra of the solar system, of the whole Universe. Above all, weíre giving glory to Zeus, the king & emperor of heaven. See how Jupiter is universal, as all ten sidereal planets are likewise universal? We should, itís the togetherness of the Gods which Jupiter is king OF. The manifestation of Godís Judgment is a matter of fact in the grand scheme of things, just as He is in the elemental kingdom of Godís atomic and molecular design & actualizing. What part of reality is deficient of Godís presence? Weíre unable to answer if not in rebellion against His Dominance. No man can stand in the presence of the majesty and virtue of the Gods until the seven plagues of the seven planetary angels is finished. Not the soul of a man which verily can of itself stand in Godís presence, but the trinity of mans human existence. That consummation isnít until the angelic ìnumbererî of Daniel 8:13-14 is utterly actualized in full. This is because Jesus Christ personifies the UNION of Zeus & Aphrodite, the King & Queen of heaven. All glory we sing to Zeus we sing to his son Jesus, and vice versa. Jesus is not a ìreflectionî of Zeus, but is inherently endowed with the same potential of his heavenly fatherÖthatís a scary thought, when you consider this from a human vantage point. But in the spirit of Jupiter, this all makes perfect sense. Jupiter gives & gives & gives & gives. Thatís what he does. Consider, two-thirds of God gives & forgives that which he is giving. But the third part of God namely the Holy Ghost, that part of God is un-forgiving [Mat 12:30ff; Mark 3:28ff; Luke 12:8ff]. This is not so hard to understand. The third part of God is the third decan of the la- bors of life, that augmented fifth above the root tone, while the major third above the same root tone is sustaining what is created. It is the third part, the augmented fifth, which de- mands resolution. Up to the octave of the root tone is perfect.

So thereíre three ways to rectify the 3rd part of God in the zodiac of life. To the ì9sî, in a sense. The lucid candescence of the seven angels of the seven planets is likened to flawless gem- stones, refracting & reflecting that color, that tone, that sidereal modality. Any of the most precious gemstones in the world, such as diamonds, emeralds, rubies, sapphires, et al, these embody the purity of Earthís crystalline memory, e.g. ìdiamonds are foreverî. Note, how one of the four animals gives these seven angels of pure gem-like quality the seven vials filled with Godís wrath, such that these seven angels are doing the animalís bid- ding, enforcing the wrath incurred by OUR fallen nature.

At the moment that Jesus died on the cross not quite two thousand years ago, then our fallen nature died with him. Fully three days later, Jesus was resurrected immortally to live and reign forever at the right hand of Zevs. Hence, Jesus is called the first begotten of the dead, meaning that he is the first human be- ing since the Adamic fall to rise in the first body by electionói.e. by mutual agreement with Godóby rising above his old fallen nature. Thus the Dominion of Christ over the whole Earth commenced upon his death at Calvary. From that moment, the countdown of less than two- thousand years (only God knows exactly how much less) began as Jesus Christís Dominion has been gradually manifesting and unfolding throughout the whole Earth ever since. But as we draw nearer to the end of these second thousand years [Rev. 20:7], the inevitable and unstoppable earth-changes, even the change in the races as Edgar Cayce properly called it, under Christís Dominion these earth-changes are accelerating exponentially. Thatís because of the law of grace under which mankind is subordinate. You see, because Christ truly reigns over the whole Earth, mankind has been permitted grace by powers and principalities, which themselves operate within their meets and bounds of heavenly and earthly forces, interacting among the whole, man has been allowed space to repent in time and space, in space and time. As we approach the culmination of these second thousand years, the change is being felt tangibly, and the grace-period for man to live in rebellion against the Illimitable God of heaven is destined for an abrupt halt, an extremely rude awakening. This is the direct result of Jesus dying on the cross, and is not due to the good and evil thoughts, words and deeds of mortal men since the fall of the first men Autumn and the first women Evening circa 200,000 tropical years ago. It is precisely because of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ on Wednesday April 25, 31 AD at the moment that he died at about 3 PM LAT, that the whole world, literally, the entire mass of the Earth and all animate and inanimate things hereon, even the six billion-plus souls- incarnate, the totality of the Earth is conforming to the perfected-matrix of the Dominant one who reigns over the Earth, the one who is rightly called King of kings and Lord of lords. So when you read about Judgment, which is Kronos, Father Time, the Scythe, called Shai- tan in the Arabic, Satan in the gentile English translation, know that you are reading about the inherent completion of the pattern of Christ in the whole Earth.

Those who fail to comprehend the tremendous mag- nitude of Christís reign over the Earth are in grave danger of Saturnís Judgment, the King of Gravity who at Judgment Day is unchained from the very depths of the Earth Tartaros (where to find Phokos, the Focus of Iris which is the eye of the Sky, the memory and mother of the muses Mnemosyne, the developing white pebble at the center of the Earth Pluto). When Saturn, Satan, the King of Gravity, is unchained from the focus of the Earth, the even the gravity of the Earth will be greatly imbalanced, and the world in tremendous upheaval thus Nostradamus wrote in his epistle (which was solely dedicated to Jesus Christ, merely written to poor hapless king Henry II of France to ensure its universal propagation, as this letter plainly states): ìÖ Jesus-Christ, & against his Ekklesia, & his reign for a time, and in occasion temporize, & will precede in front of one eclipse solar the most obscure, & the most tenebrific, which will have been since creation of the world until to the death & passion of Jesus-Christ, & from there until here, & will be in the month of October that some grand translation will be made, & such that we will believe the gravity of the earth having lost her natural movement, & been abyssal in perpetual darknessÖ î Because the destiny of the Earth is focused on the global reign of Jesus Christ, then all men, all animals, all plants, all rocks, all lakes and oceans, and everything in them, all mountains and valleys, all islands, all tectonic plates, all sulphurous magma, all of the molten bulk mass of the entire Earth below, and Earthís atmosphere, her weather, her seasons, climates and cy- cles within cycles, the WHOLE of the Earth is destined to conform to the indomitable will of Jesus Christ, whose will is one with the will of our heavenly father Zevs who reigns Emperor of heaven on Mt. Olympus.

The presently unfolding and rapidly accelerating tribulation pertains to the destruction of the fourth empire of Iron mixed with miry clay on a global scale, as wrote the prophet Daniel, in order to pave the way for the fifth empire which is universal, the reign of Christ in his Do- minion over the whole Earth; again, Jesus is our loving brother under the mighty reign of the Emperor of heaven Jupiter, who is verily the God of giving, expansion and augmentation, the Dominant one Zeus as called in the Apocalypse, the O NE who we are adoring into the ages.
