Light & Sound bear witness to the diatonic and chromatic qualities of astrological forces from which the four elements of cre a- tion derive and manifest throughout the universe. As we humans see and hear, these forces are perceived in pr imary colors: Red, Ye l low and Blue; secondary colors Orange, Green, Violet; and tertiary colors russet, citron and olive (composite Indigo), hence the diatonic “ ROYGBIV ” primary co l ors of light, i.e., Red - Orange - Yellow - Green - Blue - Indigo - Violet refraction d ispersal of visible wavelengths — as through a prism, from about 700 nm just above infrared, down to about 400 nm which is just below ultraviolet. Color i n tensity or chroma is its degree of satur a- tion - AND - departure from pure light, whose “ color ” is white ; although white, and black, are not really colors by strict definition, since pure white is generally the appearance of all visible wav e lengths, whereas pure black is the absence of the appearance of any visible wavelength. As with light , the primary “ col ors ” of audible sound are Red, Yellow and Blue, the three diatonic tones numbered 1 - 3 - 5, which are the root tone, major third and perfect fifth, which together form the C - major triad. The s econdary colors Orange, Green, and Violet correspond to the root to ne, minor third and natural sixth (note perfect sixth implies a major third but the minor third is dissonant), which form the D - minor sixth triad. The tertiary colors are formed by the interval of two chromatic tones, such as olive which is yellow - green of diminished sat u- ration, which falls between the E and F, thus is E and F played together, E as the root tone, and F as the minor second, the epitome of dissonance like the theme from the movie “ Jaws ” which is exemplary of how this interval is used in music to build tension or conflict by the complex ratio of 11:12 (cf . Judas Iscariot and the ensign of Jup i ter - inferior , the twelfth sign Pisces, archetypal “ Hanged Man ” of Tarot, his mystical musical niche succeeded by Ma t thias). Thus there are seven diatonic colors in the iris: 1 Red, 2 Orange, 3 Yellow, 4 Green, 5 Blue, 6 Indigo, 7 Violet; therefore there are twelve chromatic colors in the iris, 1 Red, 2 Red - Orange, 3 Orange, 4 OrangeYellow, 5 Yellow, 6 Green, 7 Green - Blue, 8 Blue, 8 Blue - Indigo, 10 Indigo, 1 1 Indigo - Violet, 12 Violet. These are the 7 x 12 colors in the planetary zodiac having 7 x 12 co r responding tones. The chart below illustrates the color/tone relationship in the zodiac with the planets and their signs. See how the C - major scale corresponds with the “ ROYGBIV ” colors, the C - major triad is consonant with Red, Yellow, & Blue, the D - minor sixth triad matches Orange , Green, & Violet: T"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Dark Side of the Moon 2 |< ------- perfect 5th ------- >| |  | |< ---- perfect 4th -- >| | | | | |< -- major 3rd -- >| | | | | | | Ari Gem Leo Vir Sco Cap Pis Mar Mer Sun Mer Mar Sat Jup Red Ora Yel Gre Blu Ind Vio C D E F G A B | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | Tau | Can | Lib Sag Aqu | Ven | Moo | Ven Jup Sat | ROr | OYe | GBl BIn IVi | C# | D# | F# G# A# | | |  | |<minor 3rd>|  | |  | |< ---------- natural sixth ---------- >| For example, the C - m ajor triad is dominated by the ‘ C ’ with the major third ‘ E ’ and pe r fect fifth ‘ G ’ mixing their respective colors on full intensity. This color is dominated by ‘ C ’ or Red, but the Yellow of ‘ E ’ and Blue of ‘ G ’ are charted as if mixed on full intensity. As s uch color/sound analyses are refined and expanded, dynamic colors and tones may be further a c- counted for such as tertiary colors which are of a lower intensity, on down to the intuitive level — which is just as well, since intuition is truly the lifeblood of imagination, while e m- pirical observation and theoretical knowledge alone are only the beginning of such applied learning. Sooner or later this knowledge and experience must be integrated into ones cogn i- zance and feeling of living, which clearly transcen ds mundane secular academia. In all fairness to “ RGB ” advocates , the primary color of Green corresponds to the perfect fourth above Red, thus is Red - Green - Blue equal to 1 - 4 - 5 , the very fundamentals of music, a co n vincing argument except that Green is made by Blue plus Yellow. Conversely, however, Cyan is made by Green plus Blue. When you look at the zodiac of these primary and seco n- dary co l ors, you immediately see that Cyan and Yellow, with Green between them, oppose Magenta, and this is precisely the CYM c olor model of subtractive color. And furthermore, Green and Blue, with Cyan b e tween them, is at opposition to Red, i.e. the additive RGB color model. The following color zodiacal diagram demonstrates this principle:"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Light & Sound 3 For the purpose of zodiacal delineati on , th e diatonic ROYGBIV primary - color model is the most natural color model of all, and is the one most familiar to all — just as it has been for many hundreds of mi l lions of years and counting. It ’ s the iris, rainbow, the zodiac of color, with seven prim aries and five secondaries comparable to the classification & numbe r ing of human ribs, human chakras, etc. (I’ve examined this human correspondence in modest detail in my ‘I n terlinear Apocalypse & Concise Commentary’, published on the Google - archives & in print where available). The ROYGBIV color - model is perfectly natural, and corresponds to the C - Major (Ionian - ascending) scale, as the physical refra c tion of light forever bears witness. The chart on the following page summarizes the relationship of the pla nets, and the z o diac, with tones and colors, and the 12 signs, & 10 planets of the major a r cana. Any single tone or combination of tones, signs, or colors, or major arcana trumps etc. r e- sults in the denoted mixture of the aforesaid; e.g., Gemini and Libra/ D + F#/Orange + Green - Blue, is a major third with D as the root, or a diminished sixth below Gb, emphasi z ing the root tone, color, sign, trump, etc, as comparing the aspect of tension Libra to Gemini verses Gemini to Libra. Musical intervals help you to re cognize respective astrological rel a tionships, as with colors in contrast, or when mixed together.

This is why it is so i m- portant to see the actual results of plausible theories — and put their veracity to the test. Many theories show merit or repeatable d e monstrability, promoting acceptance among the experts of world renown. The problem is that most of these experts share common agendas in that their motives are venal, or reinforced by repeated oversights compounding into daft sop h istry as perpetuated in even the finest of university libraries. “ A lie is not a lie when you are o r dered (paid) to lie ” , to quote “Chemical Ali” who worked under the tyrrany of Saddam Hussein . Conversely, an ancient maxim survives the test of time, as with proverb s, parables, and all prov i dential admonishments. That which holds true for thousands of years is likely to be true. But that which is promoted as some “ new truth ” or “ fact ” for mere decades is more likely to be faulty; such theories must endure for millenn ia at least to be judged over the course of time to be good and reliable. More often than not we find that worldly academia have promoted mistaken conclusions by their fellow gentiles, taking for granted the auspice of those who are misled in their colle c- t ive arrogance and disdain for the Gods. These aren ’ t accusatory assertions, but is observation of their own word & deed. *They* do not believe in God. And they are the first to admit it — even brag about it! For example, consider the misguided notion that modern science is somehow “ wiser ” than the wisdom of the ages. Unscrupulous scientists and whole institutions disavow facts & truths universally held for thousands of years around the ancient and antediluvian world. Nothing new under the sun — the decline of civilization is reaching its zenith after the first holocaust and the elemental energies join in bringing devastation to a stiffnecked and adulte r ous people (to paraphrase Edgar Cayce reading 5750 - 001#5). Only the teacher within can instruct you in the way of the light and sound. Mere men can only hope to inspire, lest they seek to mislead you even as they were misled. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Chapter 2 Primaries and Secondaries C ONTINUING WITH our analysis of the demonstrably zodiacal qualities of light & sound, Ne w- ton ’ s expe riments in light and color show — i.e., vs. “ tell ” — that light refracts primarily into Red or “ least refrangible ” , Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo & Violet, with gradients b e- tween them. Nature has demonstrated this for God knows how long, with rai n bow s of color appearing everywhere you look in nature. To wit, “ nor are there only rays proper and particular to the more eminent colors/all their intermediate gradations ” To paraphrase “ two sorts of colors ... original ... the other co m- pounded of these ... original or p rimary colors [ROYGBIV] and two, an indefinite variety of i n termediate gradations ” — ibidem from Isaac Newton ’ s first paper on Light & Color Newton shows that “ one sort of rays hath been well parted from those of other kinds, it hath afterwards obstinately r etained its color notwithstanding my utmost endeavors to change it ” ; ergo any infinitesimal slice of the color pie retains its quote “ species of color ” . Furthe r- more, Newton shows that any two or more colors in composite reveal the compounding of those colo rs, yet their composited mixture can again be separated into its integral color co m- ponents; to paraphrase “ rays severed exhibit the same colors which they did before they e n- tered the composition ” (of colors), as in modern color televisions or computer moni tors where the “ red ” is in fact a slightly orangish - red, and “ green ” is slightly yellowish - green, with slightly indigoish - blue, no doubt in compensation. Practice oft - exceeds chalkboard theories, e.g., “ a d- ditive ” and “ subtractive ” color, since the human ey e makes no distinction whatsoever as to where light & color originates before entering through its lens and pupil, but only sees a light that has reached the eye and is processed, and is finally interpreted by the brain as visible light/color from moment t o moment, in realtime. Whether light is refracted or reflected the eye cares not. The brain cares very much as the brain interprets signals. Judicial astrology holds that there are seven primary and five secondary colors visible to the naked eye, with very smooth — apparently infinite — gradations between them. The h u- man iris is named for the goddess of the rainbow or the visible spectrum of light, as called the covenant, or bow. The persistence and attenuation of signals after entering the human eye and b rain pro c- esses ultimately decides what colors are seen by each human observer. It ’ s the majority co n- sensus among humans which confirms for us that “ red is red ” and “ yellow is yellow ” . Some people experience forms of color blindness, and a host other vision abnormalities. And some persons might report seeing a shade that you see as gray as something that has distinctive color, or might report reading “ black ” printed text on a neutral paper as having distinctive colors or audible tones, or vice versa. This de monstrates that human brain functions are int e-"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Light & Sound 7 gral to how human eyes see and human ears hear light and sound. Theoreticians would like to keep these components totally separate, but in practice the human brain is more complex than their simpleton theories can account for or agree on. Ultimately the human soul experiences the light and sound. Psyche is the scourge on the back of secular science! The soul of man is always an integral component of experience in the living human body. Ignore soul and you ignore life; ignore life, and you are no longer a scie n- tist but you ’ ve abandoned logic and reason for superstition and ignorance. While his observations on biblical prophecies are inexact, Newton ’ s empirical observ a tions and scientific deductions are impeccable, as I ’ ve abundantly quoted from this paper that was first published 1672, Philosophical Transactions, hereinbelow redacted for emphasis, brevity, justification . Newton’s original color - wheel is copied hereinbelow : “ 6. The same colors in specie with thes e primary ones may be also produced by co m position: for a mixture of yellow and blue makes green; of red and yellow makes orange; of orange and yellowish green makes yellow ... colors not too far distant one from another, they by their mutual alloy compound th at color ... midway between them ... .

But the most surprising and wonderful composition was that of whiteness ... .no one sort of rays which alone can exhibit this ... .to its composition are requisite all the aforesaid pr i- mary colors mixed in due proportion ... ” “ 8 ... .whiteness is the usual color of light; for light is an aggregate of rays i n dued with all sorts of colors ... . but if any one predominate must incline to that color as in the blue flame of brimstone ... .yellow flame of candle and the var i ous colors of the fixed stars. ”"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Primaries and Secondaries 8 “ 9 ... rays constituting incident light, those which differ in color proportionally differ in re - frangibility ... ” “ 10 ... colors of the rainbow..drops which refract t he rays ” “ 11 ... .disposed more or less to reflect or transmit color. “ 12 ... transparent vessels, tilled the one with a red, the other with blue li q uor ... if one transmitted only red and the other only blue, no rays could pass through both. ” “ 13 ... natural bodies refle ct one sort of light in greater plenty than a n other ... any body may be made to appear any color ... ” — ibid ref. http://iweb.tntech.edu/chem281 - tf/newton_colors.htm The correlation of the visible light spectrum and audible sound with the planetary zodiac is funda mentally diatonic and chromatic, i.e. seven by twelve, sidereal and synodic. Within these broad and fundamental relationships are more complex dynamics of light and sound, just as planets move sidereally and synodically, with reference to the Sun and the E arth r e spectively. The zodiac begins its subdivision with the bisection of the 360 - degree caelestial firmament, with Libra beginning the caelestial hemisphere of evening, and Aries commencing the caele s- tial hemisphere of morning. The two celestial hemisphe res are bisected into quadrants, with Capricorn beginning the center of caelestial evening, and Cancer commencing at the center of caelestial morning. The caelestial quadrants are each trisected forming three signs per quadrant. Each sign is trisected into decanates of ten sidereal degrees ecliptic longitude by one hundred and eighty degrees in sidereal latitude (ecliptic pole to pole). Each of these thirty - six decanates are bisected in - to pentades of five sidereal degrees longitude each. This means that t here are three decanates and six pentades per zodiacal constellation on the Earth ’ s celestial firmament. The rudiments of this astrological delineation of the sky are unambiguously mathemat i cal — the universal language of the cosmos. While the corporeal ma nifestations of numbers run the gamut from kindergarten maths to hyperdimensional physics, from counting sheep to e c- static luminations, the astrological division of the zodiac is far from arbitrary, but resounds in n a ture, and resonates with human instinct . The ancients recognized the inherent mathematical quality of light & sound as the planetary zodiac clearly reflects. In the chapter three, I ’ ve charted the relationships with visible colors & audible tones and the decanates/pentades within each sign of the zodiac. These principles, applied to planets on Earth ’ s caelestial sphere are archetypal or universal in nature; whereas, the same principles applied to planets in Earth ’ s terrestrial sphere — meridian houses of the horoscope — are temporal, and corres pond to life in the body. Soul is universal while the body is terrestrial, and where the Gods congregate there is judicial astrology."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Chapter 3 S igns, Decans & Pentads W ITH THE ONE - to - one correspondence of colors and tones with the twelve signs of the p lan e- tary zodiac established (refer to Compleat Tarot Manual for detailed exposition w/ charts), the detailed charts at the end of this chapter match the colors and tones of the signs and their d e- canates according to the fixed sid e real modalities of each pl anet transposing therein thus physically correlating these subd i visions with the planets which empower their astrological cha r acteristics. More than a mnemonic, these show the actual associations of chromatic colors and tones under their planetary modaliti es. E.g., the inferior aspect of Mars empowers the qual i ties of Aries, which is a definitively synodic relatio n ship of Mars to the Earth — all relative to Earth ’ s sidereal relationship with the Sun. Signs or synodic aspects are chromatic, while the siderea l orbits of the planets are diatonic. Again this is covered in meticulous detail in my Compleat Tarot Ma n ual. The first or cardinal decan of each of the twelve celestial signs denotes the “ creative ” a s pect of the planet who rules it relative to that planet ’ s synodic aspect to the Sun. See? Sim i larly the second decanate denotes the “ fixed ” qualities of that aspect while the third or mutable d e can denotes the changeable qualities of the same aspect. These are directly related to the un i versal or archetypal qu alities of planets, much as the “ constellation ” (asterism) Orion inspires us to recount the classical myth associated with Orion the Hunter, or the deadly sting of Sco r pio, whose heart “ Ante - Aries ” or Antares, is similar in apparent size and color to Mars, who rules Scorpio from his superior a s pect to Earth via the Sun. These are universal archetypes of the planets, inspiring us to recount the classical Greek mythos of the planets in our solar system. When we consider the variants of mythology in a n- cient hi story, as Babylonian, Egyptian, Mayan, et al more ancient and ant e diluvian cultures who are lost to antiquity, we find common denominators echoing across the ages and the co n- tinents. For example, Mars is a l ways associated with war and combativeness, victor y and self - preservation. Venus, by contrast, is forever associated with beauty and ba l ance, as Jupiter is universally the “ king ” planet and God of fo r tune. Saturn is universally father time, the Scythe who reaps the harvest in due time. The prevailing thre ads of ancient myth underscore the common or universal qualities of the pla n ets. As a planet transits through one of the signs that it rules on the caelestial firmament, these are universal rulerships of that sphere. Contrarily, any planet in a sign it opp oses is in its un i- versal or archetypal detriment — hence the myth of the planet in contention with the other Gods & Go d desses. The decans within each sign reveal which quality of aspects that its ruling planet is coloring any planet found therein under that dispositing planet. In other words, a"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Signs, Decans & Pentads 10 planet who rules the sign of the zodiac disposes, or inclines visiting planets therein to its pr e- vailing synodic aspect to the Sun. E.g., a planet in Scorpio is under the i n fluence of Mars in superior aspect to the Sun , which is necessarily “ sustenant ” in its first decan, “ chang e able ” second decan and “ creative ” third decan, meaning that the first decan of Scorpio is the card i- nal decan of Mars in superior aspect to the Sun. These relationships within elemental tripli c- it ies and qualitative quadruplicities to the decans are covered in later chapters. Just r e member, synodic aspects define influences for decans through the great circle of the zodiac under ruling pla n ets. Astronomy & Astrology inspires all of our mythic arche types. Recognizing how the di a- tonic and chromatic colors and tones correlate with the caelestial zodiac is tantamount to u n- der - standing the archetypical myths associated with the planets and whether they are receding or closing by radial velocity. These a ssoci a tions are innate and inextricable, just as the relatio n ship between the sidereal and synodic orbits of the planets reveal their astrological interaction in the z o diac. How planets interact with the universal sphere of the Earth is hereinabove summari zed. How these same planets interact in the houses of Earth ’ s terrestrial sphere are similar, in that the sidereal/diatonic qualities with sy n odic/chromatic aspects to the Earth are clearly defined: as planetary Gods with sidereal modalities & synodic ensi gns. These modes and signs are un i- versal on Earth ’ s caelestial firm a ment just as spirit is universal. The same modes and signs are elemental in Earth ’ s te r restrial sphere of experience. The human body is temporal and soul is eternal in the fallen n a ture of man; as the bible calls “ son of man ” . The “ Son of God ” refers to the eternal body and soul of God reunited, perfected in the tri n ity. In this sense, the God - Man is universal, and lives in the incorruptible body of Christ called the Resurre c tion. This is v ery important, since we must differentiate between mans rebellious corruption, and mans harmony with S. Spirit in order to discern the qualities and portents of the stars. The incorruptible man lives in harmony over creation, while the corruptible man dies by his extent of discord her e under. The incorruptible man rules slightly above the stars, while the corruptible man is overruled under the stars. With this in mind, the following charts include colors and tones with corresponding decanates and pentades of the planetary signs according to the sidereal modalities of the planets therein. Blending lesser colors & tones of decans with dominant colors of their sign (e.g. Aries is RED) is simple; as the first pentad of the first decan of Aries gradually adds its reddish hig h- lights, thereafter the second pen - tad gradually subtracts it. Thus the beginning of each decan is simply the color of the sign, as in this case, Aries. The second decan gradually su b tracts its lesser yellow from the dom i nant Red until reachin g the second pentad therein, at which point the same tint of yellow is gradually added back in — which again leaves us with Red at the end of the second decan. At this point, the third decan begins adding a tint of blue - indigo to"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Light & Sound 11 the default Red color of A ries. This does not effect Aries ’ color at all but only pertains to its decans & pentads. Finally, the second pentad of the third decan of Aries gradually subtracts the (pr e viously added) blue - indigo. The same holds true for colors, tones and modes of the planets as they are transposed across the twelve signs, and within each sign ’ s decans and pentads. Pentads add or subtract each decan ’ s softer tones and modes within the sign to its fundamental or tonic tonality, as with Aries which is always C. Hence the first pentad of the first decan of Aries highlights the Arian C with a ‘ c ’ on the octave, emphasizing the fundamental Arian tonic by a gradual i n- crease in volume of the high ‘ c ’ octave, until reaching the second pe n tad. From there, the high ‘ c ’ is gradual ly softened, until barely a u dible before reaching the start of the second decan, at which point only the tonic C is played. Entering this second decan gradually adds a negative ‘ e ’ or inversion below the C, until the second pentad therein after which the ‘ e ’ is gradually softened until the third decan — which brings us again back to the C. Now b e gin to add ‘ a flat ’ soft - ly above the tonic C until the last or sixth pentad of Aries, at which point this au g- mented fifth above the C reaches its grea t est promine nce, and the volume of the ‘ a flat ’ is on par with the C albeit the tonic for any sign must always be kept in the forefront of its theme. That ’ s easy to do with a major third, like ‘ e ’ above C, which is happy right where it is. Whereas an au g mented fifth s ound in conflict with its tonic, and is unhappy where it is — as if begging for res o lution to the fifth just below it or else to the octave above of the tonic. These principles are readily demonstrated in all seven tones and colors of each mode as they tr anspose across the twelve signs of the zodiac.

The stat e ments, which cover a wall inside the small gift shop, were collected by a later owner of the property. Ed managed to carve out giant blocks of coral weighing up to 56,000 pounds and position them into what he named Rock Gate. ” — S.

(A) Was one hundred years in construction. Begun and completed in the p e- riod of Araaraart ’ s time, with Hermes and Ra."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Signs, Decans & Pentads 14 (Q) What was the da te B.C. of that period? (A) 10,490 to 10,390 before the Prince entered into Egypt ... ” \\ EdgarCayce \\ readings \\ 5748 - 006#1 : “ Much has been written respecting that represented in the Great Pyramid, and the record that may be read by those who would seek to kn ow more co n- cerning the relationships that have existed, that may exist, that do exist, b e- tween those of the Creative Forces that are manifest in the material world. As indicated, there were periods when a much closer relationship existed, or rather should it be said, there was a much better understanding OF the rel a- tionship that EXISTS between the creature and the Creator. ” Continuing ... “ (Q) How was this pa r ticular Great Pyramid of Gizeh built? (A) By the use of those forces in nature as make for iron to swim. Stone floats in the air in the same manner. This will be discovered in ‘ 58 ... ” [Min ’ s note: Iron oxide naturally “ swims ” in w a ter] “ (Q) What is the significance of the empty sa r cophagus? (A) That there will be no more death. Don ’ t misunder stand or misinte r pret! but the INTERPRETATION of death will be made plain. (Q) If the Armageddon is foretold in the Great Pyramid, please give a d e- scription of it and the date of its beginning and ending. (A) Not in what is left there. It will be as a thousand y ears, with the fighting in the air, and — as has been — between those returning to and those lea v- ing the earth. ” There are surely 100s of other equally pertinent quotes which could be cited from Lee d- skalnin and Cayce regards the forces of nature, and the b uilding of the Pyramids, Coral Ca s tle, and the principles which permitted their co n struction using methods lost to the Neo - Babylonians; but the above quotes serve to i n spire those interested in facts — not fiction — to study the words of Cayce and Leedska l nin very carefully, and recognize that the methods for building these very ancient and latter - day marvels of architecture and purpose are proven fact by their very existence ... “ show me, don ’ t tell me ” .

Sir Isaac Newton was born prematurely to Isaac (died Oct 1642 OS) & Hannah Ayscough - Newton at Woolsthorpe Manor house, l o cated at 23 Newton Way, Woolsthorpe - by - Colsterworth, Grantham, NG33 5NR, Lincolnshire, geographical coordinates 00W37:51 52N48:33, at about one o ’ clock in the morning 25 December 1642 (Julian), which was 4 Ja nuary 1643 (Gregorian), with Arcturus rising on the Ascendant. A simple chart is made u s- ing Astrolog v. 5.41G, with positions strictly in reference to the caelestial zodiac using class i cal vedic “ houses ” , which simply number the signs on the caelestial sph ere with Ascendant nu m- bering first house, which in Newton ’ s natal chart is near the cusp of Virgo - Libra (29Vir26) and so the Ascendant numbers caelestial Libra first.

This is done because decans themselves refer to the eleme n tal triplicities of the whole zodiac which enable their exi s tence and astrological influence as decans within each of the signs, thus drawing attention to the thirty - degree signs and pla n ets whose very existence and influence is enabled by the el e ments. Also, because the ele mental tr iplicities and qualitative quad ruplicities are enabled by the planets, then fiducial marking stars used to refer the planetary positions to the caele s tial sphere do not empower the decans and so are not accorded them. Influences of the planets are empowered by the elements which comprise them in their respective sidereal and synodic o r- bits. And so decans are tied directly to the thirty - degree signs of like - elements which comprise their elemental triplicity. This means that planets in signs of like - elements are in eleme n tal synergy, according to the decan that corresponds to that sign. As in our example, Isaac Newton ’ s natal Mars is about 17Ari42, which transliterates to “ 23Leo06 ” in Aries ’ second decan. See? Newton ’ s natal Sun is 23Sag51, which is “ 11Leo32 ” Sagitt a rius third decan.

To the right of the element table, we have a column of seven numbers labeled as follows: “ + ” is the n umber of “ yang ” objects (i.e. in Fire or Air signs); “ - ” is the number of “ yin ” objects (i.e. in Water or Earth signs); “ M ” is the number of objects above the horizon (i.e. in the “ Southern ” hemisphere of the Midheaven); “ N ” is the number of objects below the horizon (in the “ Northern ” hemisphere of the Nadir); “ A ” is the number of objects in the Eastern half of the sky (in the hemisphere of the Ascendant); and “ D ” is the number of objects in the Wes t- ern half of the sky (in the hemi - sphere of the Descendan t). Note that cusp"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Chart of a Genius 30 o b jects are left out of hemisphere counts (but still included in the other o b ject summaries) as they would skew things since they are always in a particular hemisphere. Finally we have a field indicating the division of objects into the first six and second six signs of the zodiac. The number of objects in the first six signs of the zodiac will be printed, labeled by the character “ < “ . (The number in the second half isn ’ t printed; just sub tract from the total if you want to know.) Accord ing to a book on the Kaballah, the emph a sis of the first six signs on the zodiac is on “ what ’ s to learn ” , and the emphasis on the second six signs is on “ what ’ s to share ” . Use or interpret this as you wish. ” [end quote] Astrolog ’ s helpfile goes on only to mention this about d e cans: “ Decan displays are supported in Astrolog, and one can display a decan i n- fluenced chart with the - 3 switch. The decan theory is that each sign in the zodiac can be divided into three parts: The first 10 degrees (i.e. the first d e- can) is mainly influenced by the sign in question, the second 10 degrees (se c- ond decan) although still influenced by the sign in ques - tion is also somewhat influenced by the next sign of the same element, while the last decan is infl u- enced by the third si gn of the same element. The - 3 switch applied to a chart will move each object into the sign of its decan. For example, if the Sun is at 29 degrees Aquarius and the Moon at 5 degrees Virgo, in the resulting chart, the Sun will go to Libra (26 degrees) and the Moon will remain in Virgo (a l- though be at 15 degrees now since it was previously in the middle of the first decan of Virgo.) ” [end quote] As you can see, there ’ s more to understanding the meaning and influence of decans & pe n- tads than the quoted author realized. So much more, that it takes light & sound to fully e x- plain it. Music is the perfect expression of how astrology really works. The ancients knew this. That ’ s why they understood it so well. That ’ s why modern astrologers really don ’ t unde r stand a thing about astrology but merely pretend to. Look at Newton ’ s chart again, this time using the terrestrial meridian houses of the horoscope — numbered by the ruling planets who in turn give us the key that unlocks the mystery of signs, decans and pe n tads."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Light & Sound 31 Body Houses RUL.

Chart Interpretation By Light & Sound The musical theme of Beethoven ’ s natal chart is in the key of F - Locrian for ruling Me r cury and Gb - Ionian for Venus & Pluton, in effect transposing the relative diatonic positions b e- tween the half - step interval ‘ B ’ to ‘ C ’ , for the Locrian and Ionian respectively, likewise to the ‘ F ’ and ‘ Gb ’ of Virgo and Libra on the chromatic scale, in this case of the horoscopic z o diac."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Light & Sound 39 Like Isaac Newton, Beethoven ’ s na tal Mercury was acquiring in conspicuously close co n- junction to the galactic center Sgr A*, though Beethoven enjoyed a distinct advantage with the nearby Sun & Moon joining side by side together with Mercury therein the house of Servants, Jupiter also.

Of course the Sun and Moon are unique in that they both orbit Earth, rel a- tively speaking. They are r e ferred to as “ twins ” , since the Sun is around 400 times further away from the Earth than the Moon is and the Sun is also ab out 400 times greater in diameter than the Moon is, hence they a p pear to be approximately the same size, as becomes apparent du r ing a total solar eclipse. The principle of the sidereal modes of planets is that each planet is part of one whole solar system, just as each synodic phase or aspect of the very same pla n ets to the Earth renders one whole zodiac. We cannot consider the sidereal modality of any pa r- ticular planet, without refe r ence to the other planets who compose the particular planet ’ s mode. Simila rly, we cannot consider a particular sign of the zodiac without regard to the e n- tire zodiac and planets who define it. In other words the synodic aspect of a particular planet made to the Earth is geocentr i cally either superior or inferior at the time for which the chart is calculated — this irrespe c tive of the horoscope, but strictly with respect to the Sun to the Earth, since the planets orbit the Sun"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Chromatic Transposition 40 and the Sun orbits the Earth, so the planets in effect orbit the Earth epicycl i cally, just as Earth ’ s Moo n effectively orbits the Sun epicycl i cally. While the apparent relationships of the planets and planetary orbits are easy enough to visualize, describing this in terms of simple English isn ’ t so easily accomplished as you can see. But I ’ ve had plenty of pr actice translating analytic geom e try into plain text, so I won ’ t hesitate to do so in this cha p ter. Imagine yourself at the center of a planet, then “ seeing ” the other planets in motion rel a tive to you. That ’ s simple enough for our home planet Earth, but t akes some creative disc i pline to visualize seeing from the other planets, including the Sun and Moon, from whose respective vantage points we can see the Earth in orbit relative to other planets in this solar system (some refer to this as “ soul travel ” , wh ich between lif e times is literally the case). Here, we are merely using imagin a tion. As in Beethoven ’ s natal horoscope we must consider the Ionian mode as being transfixed under the key of Gb, i.e. Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Moon and Mercury in the signs of Libra, Sagittarius, Aquarius, Pisces, Taurus, Cancer, and Virgo, res pectively. We acknow l edge the behavior of each planet in each respective sign, as with Venus in Libra by virtue of her rule thereover and therefore therein: Libra is the superior aspect of Venus within the zodiac; not a- bly, Venus is approaching her maximum elongation from the Sun (Thu 20 - Dec - 1770 12:28:58 UT), reinforcing her Libran reign by horoscope and radial velo c ity. These are two distinctive issues: one, the synodic phase of a planet to the Earth; and two, the sidereal orbital pathway of the planets in the context of the whole solar system t o gether. Beethoven ’ s horoscope finds Venus ruling in two distinct ways: 1) The apparent synodic motion of Venus with respect to the Sun i .e. Venus synodic and the Sun sidereal to the Earth, and this without specific reference to the other pla n ets. This reign of Venus is for the soul, the ensign of Libra, ergo the third heaven closing benefic by r a- dial velo c ity. 2) The sidereal orbital path of Venus around the Sun wholly with respect to the other planetary orbits which compose Venus ’ sidereal Ionian modality, and all of which r e fers to the sidereal order of the planets based on the orbits, and therefore, results in the nu m bering of the horos cope; Venus ’ mode is transposed to the key of Gb in the z o diac. Again, this requires all of the planets and zodiac signs to be considered as one, all as part of the whole system, which altogether pertains to soul ’ s terrene incarn a tions. The planetary modal ities are sidereal while transposition is synodic; the former eternal, the latter temporal. Unde r stand? So you see Beethoven ’ s natal Venus is acquiring near maximum superior elongation from the Sun, verily the ensign of Libra. Also, Beethoven ’ s natal horos cope finds Venus in the se v- enth house, thus her sidereal orbital modality transposes all the other planets ’ orbits accor d-"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Light & Sound 41 ingly, with our souljourns among the ten heavens empowering its mode since each mode r e- quires all seven of the planetary orbital paths for its compos i tion, as the three outer planets add their repeat mode in the bass, as Earth ’ s caelestial firmament, atmosphere, and terra firma, as carefully explained & charted in my Compleat Tarot Ma n ual. In other words, it is our individual and collect ive sojourns in each heavenly sphere which enables the planetary modality and characteristics for that order of the planets or hea v ens, in which we as souls are moving along the path of the planet, which in turn influence us as souls - incarnate upon the Ear th according to each planet ’ s muse, it relative ethos in heaven. This sojourning influence includes our incarnations on Earth to the aggregate sum - totality of experience in soul - and - body. The pronounced distinction between the planetary spheres and their s idereal orbital di s- tances vs. apparent synodic motion to the Earth is best illustrated by the relationship b e tween a violin bow and the violin string. The “ bow ” is the planets, the “ strings ” their respective o r- bits. Strings on our vi o lin represent the side real orbits & macrocosmic valence bands of the planets in our solar system. We can visualize this solar system connecting with other solar sy s- tems, much as elements combine into molecules, as tiny magnets following attra c tion one to the other. In this sens e, the entire universe is some - how and in someway interconnected by the astrological forces, just as huge molecules of galaxies are connected in clu s ters and so on ad infinitum. In every solar system, orbital paths of the planets form or splay out in diat onic intervals, from the primordial soup of their conception, inception, creation, until fruition, e x- tinction, decomposition and disintegration. Hence, the planets and their orbits are inextric a bly r e lated, each planet to its orbit, each planet and orbit t o the whole. This is our development, the exegesis of universal astrology. The cosmic bow of the pla n ets is bowing the strings of their orbits always in real - time or the ever - presence of exi s tence. The strands of the bow always work together, resonating ea ch string according to its open tu n ing and position. Every fret, or chromatic fingering positions along the fretless neck, is represent a- tive of the houses of the horoscope, each a unique composition comprised of soul - in - body, as houses and planets in our a djudicated horoscope, the undulating snake of rhythm as the m e- ter of the planets transposing across the zodiac of the horoscope as they transit house - cusps in sidereal hourly intervals, roughly speaking, rectified by the synodic m o tion of planets within th e Earth ’ s houses as numbered by the same. These are called “ progressions ” and pe r tain to the hor o scope. Beethoven ’ s natal Mercury rules in the sixth house, although Mercury is barely inferior to the Sun acquiring in close orb of about 2 minutes 6 seconds o f arc. Here we find Mercury is having the same effect on the planets in the Locrian mode, a half - step below the Ionian mode of Venus in horoscopic Libra. Thus you see, a planet need not be in corresponding inf e rior or superior aspect in order to be ruling via its superior or inferior house in the horoscope. As in"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Chromatic Transposition 42 this case, Mercury is inferior (to the Sun), but rules in Mercury ’ s superior house, because Me r- cury ’ s phase depends only on the Sun to the Earth, while the horoscope is composed of the Pantheion of the Gods. There ’ s certainly much more which could be said of Beethoven through reading his natal horoscope but I leave such rea d ing to others. Chapter six will focus on the circle of fifths in the zodiac and how each mode is transposed through its signs. "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" Chapter 6 Going In Circles S O FAR we ’ ve learned about diatonic & chromatic colors and tones of the zodiac, diatonic modes of the planets, the decanates & pentades in the horoscope and how they are co m- puted — using the natal chart of Isaac Newton as an exam ple; the natal chart of Ludwig van Beethoven as the preeminent example of horoscope interpretation via modes of ruling planets by transposition in the zodiac, and the general distinction between sidereal & synodic orbits of the planets and their astrologic al influence on the eternal soul and temporal body of life on Earth. Music is the divine expression of the Gods & Goddesses, as the most esteemed ancient ph i- losophers and prophets have concertedly reiterated, with latter - day musicians demonstra t ing time an d time again that music is sacred, even magical, since music itself exists because of the very Gods who created it — and the Muses who promote it! The Muses, the beautiful daug h ters of Zeus & Mnemosyne, the nine who are in fact the seven diatonic modalities of the heavens with two repeat modes in the bass, then middle C, the tone of Pluton at the center of activity. Astrology is built on the mathematics of music and its rudimentary tones, its harmonies, melodies and rhythms, its crescendos and overtones, cons onances, dissonances, and res o- nances, its colors, its hues, its unparalleled capacity to express that which is otherwise inta n- gible; Bach, Beethoven, Beatles, Hendrix, Zeppelin, Floyd, or any other composer or performer of music who you enjoy, be it classi cal, rock or jazz, country, hip hop or any other style of music that you savor — that ’ s good music. Even the music that you don ’ t care for, or even detest, if anyone out there likes it, it ’ s good music for them, hence the maxim “ beauty is in the eye of the beholder ” . Mother nature is alive with her own genres of music in concert twenty - four hours a day. Everywhere you listen in nature her songs can be heard. One need only listen. Now we come to the traditional circle of fifths, which is the order of major k ey signatures linked by perfect fifths, beginning with the key of C, the center of our human hearing, and diatonic tone of Pluton & Mnemosyne (recall that Pluton and Poseidon are brothers of Zeus). This circle of fifths adds one sharp per perfect fifth abo ve C in a contiguous series; the key of C is simply the diatonic Ionian modality beginning on C, whose key has no sharps or flats. Next the perfect fifth above C begins the key of G, which adds its one sharp tone, F#. Climb up another perfect fifth from th e G and you land on D, which key signature adds a C# in add i- tion to the F#, so the key of D has two sharps, F# and C#. Next we climb to the key of A with three sharps F#, C#, and G#. The fifth up to E needs four sharps F#, C#, G#, and D#. Then the fifth up to B has five sharps, F#, C#, G#, D#, and A#. From here the key signature jumps up a perfect fifth to F#, with six sharps F#, C#, G#, D#, A# and E#, where the E# is the same"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Going In Circles 44 as the F, but is notated as a E# in the key signature of F# major. Lastly, the se ven sharps are F#, C#, G#, D#, A#, E# and B# in the key of C#, where the B# is really the C, but is n o tated as B#. Notably, the seven days of the week are actually named for the sidereal orbits of the seven naked - eye visible planets in diatonic fifths — no sharps or flats allowed, from the Sun ’ s Dorian mode to Saturn ’ s Mixolydian mode. The difference from our circle of fifths is that these are strictly diatonic fifths, but not chromatic fifths as we see above using the traditional circle of fifths; meaning that the perfect - diatonic fifth above B is not F#, but is necessarily the dimi n- ished fifth to Jupiter, the Lydian mode which is naturally in the diatonic key of F, not F# as in our chromatic circle of fifths. See? Thus the first day of the week is Sun ’ s d ay and Dorian mode, which begins on D. Up a fifth for the second day of the week, Moon ’ s day, Aeolian mode and the key of A. Up a fifth to Mars ’ day, whose Phrygian mode is in the diatonic pitch key of E. Up a fifth to B, is Mercury ’ s day in the theoretica l Locrian mode. Next is the fifth day of the week, Jupiter ’ s day, the Lydian mode in the diatonic key of F natural. Up a fifth to the sixth day, Venus ’ day, her beautiful Ionian mode, in the key of C. Lastly, with the days of creation complete is Saturn ’ s day in the Mixolydian modality, and the pitch key of G.

All others require at least one sharp or flat tone for its modal tran s- position. The circle of fifths ascending & descending begins on the diatonic scale of the planets but expands by scalar transposition to the chromatic zodiac along the twelve - tone scale. There ’ re two particularly notable features regarding this modal behavior. One, that the seven naturally - diatonic tones of the seven planetary modalities are centered just as the nat u- rally - chromatic tones for the twelve planetary signs of the zodiac are likewise centered: on middle - C. And two, that this correspondence between the diatonic modes and chromatic scales is fixed by sidereal orbits of the planets in their synodic positions superior and inferior to the Sun. It ’ s the Earth ’ s orbital distance from the Sun i.e. between the orb its of Venus and Mars, which numbers the Sun as the fourth heaven, with Venus third and Mars fifth, our Moon first, & Mercury second. Thus the natural key characteristics of the planets in their respective modalities is esta b- lished strictly by their sidere al order of orbit. Since the natural pitch key for each planet is i n- extricably fixed to the first tone commencing its diatonic modality, it is necessary that the Moon be associated first with the A above the middle - C, ergo the Aeolian modality for which he r muse Klio is named. By impressing this upon your memory you will begin to automat i- cally recognize the diatonic key of A as the Moon ’ s by her Aeolian order in the heavens; which order emerges from the sidereal order of planets, just as the planets themsel ves emerged in their orbits according to the very same order thereby empowering it. It seems the creation and the idea of the creation are one in the same where the Gods & Goddesses are present. By associating the sidereal order of the other planets with their respective modes and fu n- damental pitch keys, you will begin to hear the relative key characteristic for each planet"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Going In Circles 48 among the solar system thus altogether as a team, since each planet ’ s modality shares exactly the same seven tones as the other planet s do, only the order is unique to each planet. That ’ s what determines each planet ’ s natural key characteristics — in contrast to those key characte r- istics for the other six planets out to Saturn, and repeat modalities for outer planets. You ’ ve seen by tran sposition how these unique keys and modes of planets interact & ove r- lap in the spectrum of the zodiac, including how they share common sharps and flats when transposed through the circle of fifths, up and down the chromatic scale.

Therefore, the next chapter will focus on the profound associations of Light & Sound with the planets & signs, the esse ntials for understanding who the Gods are, and how they behave in our zodiac — the real source of myth, and the true composition of our psyche for we are Gods.

Remember, this is the foundation of all classical myth. For convenient reference, here is the same chart again, but this time labeling only the pla n- ets and ensigns to the corresponding tones relative to middle C — which is the center of h u- man hearing. This natural relationship between the sidereal planets and their chromatic signs reveals the tonal resonance of the planetary orbits to their planetary ensigns, which they m u- tually co - create; to w it, see how Pluto sidereally correlates with Aries at the center of our chromatic scale; Venus with Aries on the octave above middle - C; Saturn goes with Scorpio; Moon with Capricorn above middle C, and Uranus is also with Capricorn one octave below the Moo n; Neptune with Pisces is the only planet/sign correspondence which is congruent with its sidereal orbit - and - synodic ensign.

Astrology is a bonafide science. As we shift the un i- versal law to each planet, then the astrology of that planet reflects the rules we applied. Of course, such principles extend to all other planets, each according to its solar orbit and sy n- odic position. IOW, the Sun describes every planet ’ s ecliptic. Get it? The implications of thi s are staggering ... and pristine. E.g. using the Astrolog (5.41G) program you can change the central planet under se t- tings>calculation settings, albeit the ecliptic is fixed to the Earth irregardless. Forgive such limitations — humans are confined to Earth! It ’ s a cinch to adjust for any other planet ’ s ecliptic, by adding or subtracting its relative degrees to Earth. Of course these are approximate, d e- pending on latitude. For exact equations, you need to use analytic geometry. Whether or not Mars is disclosing a rtificially - erected structures is irrelevant to this tit - for - tat rendition of classical astrology onto the Red Planet. Let us put ourselves standing thereon: Look! The Earth & Moon are now a distant inner - planet with its satellite thus are seen in league w ith Mercury & Venus, in that all three are revolving synodically faster about the Sun. Notice two rather small and ill - proportioned moons encircling us. The great asteroid belt bears mute testimony to an ancient planet destroyed by nature, or perhaps by so me man - made cataclysm? No matter, since we ’ re but looking at the sidereal - to - synodic protocol as a p- plied to Mars, using the very same diagram as we use for planet Earth; moons phobos & de i- mos count as one as with all planets, as Gods testify that even doze ns of moons count as one. Please don ’ t misinterpret, these moons are still moons; IOW, such influence of moons are massively distributed. Take the mass equations of the composite force. Get it? The proximate sphere of each moon defines its “ sphere ” . The ne ed of souls to interact with each sphere is real. Their composite orbit retails by the center of Jupiter. These asteroids are all that remains of the old planet. I do not believe that souls inhabit this extinct realm. Asteroids have slightly more effect to Mars than Earth. The “ king planet ” Jupiter seems to dominate the effect, since Jupiter is no doubt a centered mass; whereas the asteroid belt embodies the epitome of centerless orbit. While not one other planet besides Earth is inhabited at the present ti me, our soul dwells in one or more spheres before incarnating again at some point in Earth ’ s future; eventually experiencing the heavens many times over till we ’ ve learned to sow righteousness and reap thanksgiving. IOW, until we ’ ve experienced enough less ons to be humble under God the Creator and participate in Gods ’ handiwork, which are the heavens and the earth, and all life herein. As Cayce said in reading 3744 - 4 (dated Nov. 1923), these heavenly interludes are just ou t- side relativity of force. These in terconnective conditions for each heavenly realm, as they relate to one another, exist “ just outside ” this mundane realm of our earthly, soul - with - body exper i-"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Light & Sound 53 ences. So it isn ’ t until that discarnate soul, who returns from its place in heaven, its plane of consciousness, its own view of Earth from that sphere of souljourning, it isn ’ t until that soul intercepts the newborn infant body, that the aforesaid vantage point from heaven exerts an actual force or astrological influence upon our temporal living, infl uencing our will, and every choice that we will ever make. It ’ s the choices we ’ ve made that define conditions in the afte r- life for each departed soul ... choose wisely! Probably the best single revelation Cayce ever stated on astrology is made in reading 0398 - 002; here ’ s an excerpt: “ EC: Yes, we have the body, [398], and those conditions in the astrological aspects; especially in reference to those adverse influences that appear em i- nent in the experience of the entity in the near future; as well as that which has been builded by the entity in its sojourns through the spheres of activity where there is such a gathering of influences as to become active in a body - entity. In giving that which may be understandable, and that which may be helpful from the material angle at this time, as we find, it would be well that all consider the varying aspects from that considered an astrological infl u- ence. As we have given through these channels, astrological influences are e f- fective in the experience of each and every entity . However, when the activities of a soul - entity have been such as to cause or to form the appea r- ance of the entity in a particular sphere of activity, the position of the s o journ of the entity to the earth has the greater influence than just the adverse or benevolent positions of the planet or of a whole solar system upon the entity ’ s activity! Is this understood? (Pause) You should answer! ” “ GC: I don ’ t quite understand. (Continuing) Then, it is as this: When the activities of an entity, a soul in the ea rth, have been such that its passage **from** the earth would become a birth into the realm of matter known as Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Uranus, Ne p- tune, Moon, Mercury, Polaris, or any of these that are effective in the unive r- sal influence, you see, the sojour n there and the position of the planets are more effective than the influence brought to bear because of a position in a certain place or portion of the universal forces, see? Hence, as we find, these conditions are only as urges; or, as may be termed from some reasons or se a- sons of thought, the planetary influences from their positions are either b e- nevolent, adverse or inter - between these activities - one drawing upon another; but the entity ’ s sojourn in those environs makes the impulse for the mental acti vity, rather than the position of these! Do we gather the vari a- tion? ... ” [**emphasis added]"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Center Of Creation 54 Note where Cayce explicitly states that “ a position in a certain place or portion of the un i- versal forces ” is not the effective force in astrology, but is our experien ces in heaven and the relative positions of the same heavens to Earth at the time of birth ... the first breath of life. I.e. heavenly experience of soul and earthly incarnation of body; heavenly psyche with el e mental body. Understand? That ’ s why sidereal astr ology is used only to locate the planets relative to fixed stars, but not to misinterpret that caelestial chart as having substantial astrological influence by virtue of some planet in some constellation. Caelestial archetypes are universal forces so a pla net ’ s pos i- tion against the stellar constellations is arbitrary. Rather it ’ s the planets ’ relative positions to the Earth, each planet “ drawing one upon another ” together exerting their combined rule r- ships in the houses of the horoscope, and in particularly by those planets nearer to the Earth, to wit, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. Cayce knew this. Nostradamus knew this. I know this, and now you know this, too. That ’ s why judicial astrology is the only realistic method for casting horosco pes. Others who depend solely on sidereal or tropical a s- trology have lost their sensibilities, thus misleading themselves and their students. Don ’ t fall into their abyss of ignorance. We can say that the major arcana planets and signs shall “ trump ” minor a rcana planets and signs in the tarot. Why? Because the divine willpower is slightly above influence, just ou t side, slightly beyond the temporal forces. While the forces rule the body (hence “ the flesh is weak ” ), it is said that our eternal soul and the hol y spirit are in concert with freewill else our will be not entirely free, but each to its own degree and its own extent rebellious against the Gods. Since the inception of Autumn & Even ’ s banishment from the Garden of Eden, death with soul ’ s de - parture to those conditions of each heaven of oversoul ’ s own devising — where the experience for soul is requisite. It ’ s being there, being in heaven between incarnating on the Earth, that is soul ’ s “ actu a tor ” of consciousness as amassed over long epochs of experience in and out of the body. Wherever soul goes, there soul is! Our most recent souljourn is, not surprisingly, the most effective on us. We bring our heavenly diploma back with us to Earth, and apply that exper i ence in our earthly existence. The more degrees we get, the better able we are to live our lives. The proverbial old soul is far more experienced than the neophytes. The old soul knows that the beginner is wiser than the proud journeyman. An old soul is truly The Fool of tarot, which is the planet Pluto , the center of Earth, which as Cayce repeatedly says, is constantly developing. It manifests in ones awareness of others, of other souls. It ’ s the transcendence of oneself, the temperance of ego, to rule The Devil of the major arcana — archetype of self; le st that old beguiler rule you, and you don ’ t want that? Now each of these ten heavenly spheres exists in its own plane of consciousness, or as called a thought - dimension. Each sphere performs its vital role in this solar system, with each"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Light & Sound 55 compounding orbit carving out its innate niche, impervious to temporizing forces of the el e- ments: strong and weak nuclear, electromagnetic and gravitation forces. That is the planets were created and evolve in the realm of matter while the divine universal consciousnesses who create, sustain, and destroy within this realm of matter, God ’ s divine consciousness are ete r- nal, verily universal. The destiny of the solar system is driven like a massive clock by the tremendous power of the Sun, whose majestic splendor holds the pl anets in orbit, much as the massive power - center of the Milky Way galaxy, SgrA* (cf. \\ sgrab), holds our Sun in orbit along with the rest of our galaxy. By substituting the Sun for each central planet in their respective sidereal order, remai n ing planets a re charted. Remember, the ecliptic is unique for each central planet, thus you must add or subtract orbital inclination to the default short - term mean Earth - Sun plane used in A s- trolog. This is not intended for doing charts for an uninhabited planet but is to demo n strate the continuity of astrology across our solar system as any other distant star - system, since un i- versal law was “ established before the founding of the suns ” to quote the great Roman or a tor M.T.

It is especially the sound and range of human hearing that provides us with multiple octaves of astrologic i n sight, thereby focusing our consciousness and vastly improving our understanding of the stars and their active portent, which w e know extends across the spectrum of all energy in the un i verse. And we also know is centered on middle C where our human ears are concerned. Human ey e- sight is confined to a very narrow slice of this energy spectrum, beginning on the color Red and falling off after Violet, i.e. just above Infra - Red up to just below Ultra - Violet. Sound covers about ten times the octave as light covers, making sound perhaps ten times more conducive to gnosis. Considering the unique and distinctive qualities of the variation s of visible light and aud i- ble sound as we see and hear, we can be sure that each octave of electromag netic energy r e- veals similarly distinct characteristics, yet all manifesting by the law of octaves as applies to light and sound, that law being the seven by twelve, or the music of the spheres. Nostradamus referred to these as La loy du Sol & Venus, or The law of the Sun & Venus, in quatrain C5Q53. This law is manifested by the orbits of the planets around the Sun, ergo “ Solaires ” , and the relative orbits of the planets to the central planet of activity, which in our case is the phases or aspects of the planets to the Earth, hence “ Lunaries ” . We ’ ll refer to these as the Law of Sidereal Orbits & Synodic Phases. Essentially, the heliocentric orbits and the ge ocentric phases of the planets in our solar sy s- tem are fixed and unchangeable. In this sense we can think of the planets as “ Titans ” , the great spheres held in orbit by the Sun. The “ Olympians ” , in contrast, draw one upon another, as their combined forces usurp the rule of the Titans, and expropriate by right of eminent d o- main — for our benefit! The Olympians reign supreme over the Titans via the war of ten sidereal years reig n ing “ as a thousand years ” in the language of the bible. And no wonder, since what we call the “ Devil ” is self, whereas the planets ’ combined rule serves the greater good, “ thy neighbor as thyself ” . The self is ruled by Mars, whereas, others are ruled by Venus with Pluto at the center of hea r- ing. It ’ s notable that the ancients knew t hat Venus has the longest predi ctable periodic mult i- ple, i.e. 1151 mean tropical years , and this is precisely why the old testament book of Daniel explicitly states “ twam slsw Mypla rqb bre ” in Daniel 8:14, which translates “till ev e ning - morning two thousand three hundred”, in reference to Venus’ grand century of 1151 years two times, once for evening (superior) & once for morning (inferior) ergo 2300 tropical years:"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"By Jove! 60 ANCIENT BABYLONIAN SIDER EAL - SYNODIC - TROPICAL MULTIPLES (the five planets with evening & m orning zodiac signs) *MAGICIAN/Mercury: 85 mean - synodic periods =~ 27 tropical years; 191 sidereal ~ 145 mean - synodic ~ 46 tropical *EMPRESS/Venus: 157 mean - synodic periods =~ 251 tropical years; 1871 sidereal ~ 720 mean - synodic ~ 1151 tropical <=Dan 8:14 *TOWER/Mars: 22 mean - synodic periods =~ 47 tropical years 151 sidereal ~ 133 mean - synodic ~ 284 tropical *EMPEROR/Jupiter: 76 mean - synodic periods =~ 83 tropical years 36 sidereal ~ 3 91 mean - synodic ~ 427 tropical *JUDGMENT/Saturn: 57 mean - synodic periods =~ 59 tropical years 9 sidereal ~ 256 mean - synodic ~ 265 tropical Saturn ’ s rings edge - on =~ avg. 14.75 years It ’ s notable that the above chart dates circa 1 800 BC, and yet modern orthodox academia flat refuses even to acknowledge that the ancients were expert astronomers.

It is Mercury who augments Jupiter ’ s diatonic fourth on the B, denoting Jupiter ’ s expansive/augmented nature. By modal contrast, it is Jupiter who li mits Saturn ’ s diatonic se v- enth on the F, denoting Saturn ’ s limited nature, as Saturn is at the upper or outer limits of naked - eye visible planets (albeit Uranus can be seen on rare occasions by those who know exactly when and where to look, but only as a t iny pinpoint of light). Hence Jupiter limits Saturn, and the myth associated with Kronos being tied “ as a tho u sand years ” by Zeus is readily understood — thanks to the light and sound of astrology! Recall that Jupiter is father of muses by Mnemosyne. Jupiter rules the music of the spheres, which limits the rule of father time. Thus, Olympian Gods denote the seven pitch keys by transpos i tion in the twelve - tone scale of the zodiac. This is exactly the basis for judicial astrology, where Gods combine in the pred ominant hierarchy of their rulership from their respective positions to the Earth. Again I say, this is why the Titan Atlas “ holds up the Earth ” for the Olympian Gods as Atlas holds the meridian houses of Earth where the reign of the planets numbers them a ccor d- ingly under transposition of the Titan ’ s modes across the mundane z o diac, in effect overruling time itself by taking full advantage of the divine powers exerted upon the Earth by the Gods in Heaven thereby recognizing that we are Gods - incarnate assert ing our authority on the Earth by our divine birthright. See? Now you know from where the classical myth of Saturn being conquered by Jupiter in the ten years war came from. If you ’ re not familiar with this and the other related myths, be sure to read Hesi od ’ s Theogony, on this URL. Note the elevated status awarded the muses, who sing great delight to the Spirit of the Almighty. E.g., and I quote Hugh G. Evelyn - White ’ s translation:"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"By Jove! 62 “ Come thou , let us begin with the Muses who gladden the great spirit of th eir father Zeus in Olympus with their songs, telling of things that are and that shall be and that were aforetime with consenting voice. ” http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=3GMYMZH037542.8757986111@Gilgamesh - frog.org So you see, the modalities of the p lanets rank first in the Pantheion, singing the very m u sic of the Gods. Once you recognize the astrological - musical basis of classical myth, then your understanding thereof will abound an hundred - fold, a thousand - fold, & then some. There ’ s much to be lear ned by the study of myth, and to learn it in the spirit by which it was originally intended. You may be surprised how many new insights you ’ ll gain into sacred texts like the Bible, or the Pyramid Texts. The divine music illuminates the soul, and el e vates the consciousness in spirit and in fact, in truth and in practice — judicial astrology at work! Many a great composer, music theorist, mathematician and philosopher have presented their observations on the affective key characteristics of the seven modes and three repeat modes as they are transposed across the twelve signs of the natural zodiac. Subsequently, there have been many books published that attempt to synthesize the opinions of the most renowned experts on the subject, concluding that a majority con sensus emerges as if on some grande bell curve. I ’ m pleased to report that the consensus is somewhat intact upon subjec t ing them to astrological scrutiny, the voices of the muses transposed along the chromatic spe c- trum of the zodiac. Perhaps the agreement would be better if all seven modalities had r e ceived equal treatment over the millennia, but the Ionian and Aeolian modes have certainly enjoyed more attention than, say, the Phrygian or Locrian for example. Major keys or minor keys clearly dominate musica l composition, and these two modes correspond to the Moon & Caelestial Sphere for the minor, and Venus & Pluto for the major. It ’ s no wonder then, that these two modalities get played more than any other. Picture the crescent Moon, with beaut i- ful Venus cen tered beside her near the maximum superior elongation against the starry bac k- ground on a clear night sky. Th e uniqueness of each key charac teristic comes by transposition in the horoscope, as the dominant hierarchy of planets exert their reigns. Where Venu s reigns in the seventh house and the Moon is therein with ruling Venus, then the major & minor modes are performed in the key of F# or Gb, which is a wonderful comb i- nation for musical composition. But as the minutes and hours go by, then certain pla n ets a re bound to transit the meridian cusps of the Earth into that rulership for that interval of time, until Venus regains her rule in the seventh house, and the cycle repeats about every two sid e- real hours per day and night, twenty - four hours a day seven days a week.

These repeating patterns of rulerships themse lves do not continue repeating but change over the course of days, weeks, months, years, decades and centuries as the synodic positions of planets are dynamic, and so they gradually progress over the long course of time. Remember our study of decans that b egan back in chap - ter three? Ruling planets ingres s- ing the third decan of its house invite the imminent change of rulership, awaiting only the impending planetary transit(s), as the rotation of Earth ’ s meridian house - cusps dictate. This is sufficiently im portant to understand, that I ’ ll devote the next chapter to just such an exa m ple. Pattern - recognition is the key resource of astrology. This is of fundamental, even par a- mount importance to the judicial astrologer, or as Nostradamus called us sovereign A s- tr ologue, in honor of Ab - Ram, or Abraham, father to the letters Chaldiac — whose sacred symbols correspond to certain sounds and colors, or to signs and planets as the “ harsh by le t- ters ” corresponds to the Scythe, i.e. God of father time, which is Saturn, as in the case of Nostradamus ’ quatrin C10Q65 to wit: O vaste Rome ta ruyne s ’ approche, O vast Rome your ruin is approaching, Non de tes murs, de ton sang & substance, Not of your walls, of your blood & substance, L ’ aspre par lett res fera si horrible coche, The harsh by letters will make so horrible notch, Fer pointu mis a tous iusques au manche. Iron pointed put to all until the grip. The notch is the skor or indelible mark of reckoning indebtedness. Saturn is Judgment in the major arcana. In this context, the last Judgment is the Apocalypse, which will “ settle the score ” in the universal sense. Remember the war of ten sidereal years? Yes, as if a thousand years for the battle of Armageddon to occur, given V enus ’ 1871 sidereal/720 synodic/1151 tropical. Verbatim as Edgar Cayce reiterated in reading 5748 - 6: “ (Q) If the Armageddon is foretold in the Great Pyramid, please give a d e- scription of it and the date of its beginning and ending. (A) Not in what is left there. It will be as a thousand years, with the fighting in the air, and - as has been - between those returning to and those lea v ing the earth. ”"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"By Jove! 64 The war of ten sidereal years and battle forevermore. Read what the great historian Flavius Josephus wrote i n his discourse to the Greeks concerning Hades bk 1 ch 1 and note where he warns of this future judgment: “ the just are guided to the right hand, and are led with hymns, sung by the angels appointed over that place, unto a region of light, in which the jus t have dwelt from the beginning of the world; not constrained by necessity, but ever enjoying the prospect of the good things they see, and rejoice in the expect a- tion of those new enjoyments which will be peculiar to every one of them, and estee - ming thos e things beyond what we have here; with whom there is no place of toil, no burning heat, no piercing cold, nor are any briers there; but the countenance of the and of the just, which they see, always smiles them, while they wait for that rest and eternal n ew life in heaven, which is to su c- ceed this region. This place we call The Bosom of Abraham. “ But as to the unjust, they are dragged by force to the left hand by the angels allotted for punishment, no longer going with a good - will, but as prisoners driven by violence; to whom are sent the angels appointed over them to r e- proach them and threaten them with their terrible looks, and to thrust them still downwards. Now those angels that are set over these souls drag them into the neighborhood of hell itself; wh o, when they are hard by it, contin u ally hear the noise of it, and do not stand clear of the hot vapor itself; but when they have a near view of this spectacle, as of a terrible and exceeding great prospect of fire, they are struck with a fearful expectati on of a **future judgment**, and in effect punished thereby: and not only so, but where they see the place [or choir] of the fathers and of the just, even hereby are they punished; for a chaos deep and large is fixed between them; insomuch that a just man that hath compassion upon them cannot be admitted, nor can one that is unjust, if he were bold enough to attempt it, pass over it. ” [**emphasis added] You can read this in the broader context on this URL: http://bible.crosswalk.com/History/BC/FlaviusJosep hus/?book=Hades_1&chapter=1 One lesson which we can draw from this, is that each planetary God exerts tremendous powers to the Earth! Learning to respect the powers of the Gods is a part of our re - education process. Let ’ s face it. You were not taught to r espect the powers of the Gods by your school or university were you?

See? It ’ s not for the irreve r ent but is for the religious. Do not confuse the astro - illogy of gentiles with the vigilant astrology of the elect. For example, we can not compare today ’ s pagan astrologers with the Magoi who vi s- ited then 10 ½ month - old Jesus in Bethlehem. The Parthian kings were expert astronomers, and were likely the most able astrologers of recorded history. Don ’ t be deceived by halfwits who misquote scripture in order to “ justify ” their criticism of the subject. You ’ ll find that none who read ancient Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic will ever speak out against the Magoi or anyone else in their league. Reverence begets gnosis. Irreve r- ence begets confusion and unwarranted evasion of the facts of the matter. Not only does God permit ju dicial astrology, his creation bears Witness to it. Even the covenant, the bow or the iris set in heaven. Judicial astrology isn ’ t for anyone but the faithful.

You could probably skip it and go on to the final chapter, number ten, if you ’ re not comfor t able with mathematical subject matter. For those who got A ’ s in highschool algebra, trigonometry, phy s- ics, etc, that should suffice to understand these principles of charting daily horoscopes, tra n- sits and identifying their prevailing themes for any given day. It also helps if you ’ ve had years of musical training, music theory, and a working background in compos i tion. Depending on the software you are using, examples can be reliably charted from circa 2000 BC, up to 2331 AD. For this exercise, we ’ ll use an upcoming date that is relatively near t o the present, December 21st 2012 AD, bka the “ final day ” of the Mayan cale n dar. First, it should be noted that the Mayans were expert astronomers, rivaling even surpas s ing the Babylonians, who were top - notch astronomers and astrologers albeit these siste r disc i- plines used to be considered merely a subset of mathematics, as was music, as was perhaps everything ... mathematics being the universal language. Expert astrologers were referred to as mathematicians. And because math is the common language of the cosm os, it is imperative that the sovereign astrologue learns to read, write and speak this language from his youth. And while we ’ re on that subject, ancient languages of the world commonly used the neuter gender to describe what we call his/hers, him/her, sim ply as his, or him. Got it? It ’ s well - understood that the Gods created us male and female, to wit the first scroll of the Torah. It ’ s like the fifth house, that of “ sons ” which means the house of sons & daughters for all you la y- men. See? We ’ ll di s pense wit h these minutiae for brevity ’ s sake. As with all of my astronomical calculations I ’ ve been using Astrolog version 5.41g with swiss ephemeris, as this combination of freeware is easy to use and gives astronomically acc u- rate & reliable results every time. Th e long - awaited Mayan calendar date of 13 Baktun has been the subject of books and much speculation. There is little consensus with regards to what might happen on this date which by the Gregorian correction to the old Roman (Julian) calendar turns out to b e precisely on the winter solstice of 2012 AD, Friday December 21. In a sense this date is somewhat arbitrary since I ’ ve selected it by virtue of its ever - widening popularity, a date in our not too distant future which most of us will live to see — if not i n the flesh, then in spirit. The significance of Dec 21, 2012 is at the very least astronom i- cal, i.e. literally astronomical. The winter solstice of 2012 coincides with our own Sun ’ s transit on the Mayan “ Sacred Tree ” at five degrees caelestial Sagittarius .

Again, this location is somewhat arbitrary since this horoscopic progression holds true for any location on Earth, given that only the local ascendant and desce n - dant varies with latitude, and any change in location longitude is dependent on sidereal time - or - distance, where meridians of longitude plus or minus this local meridian at the Great Pyramid in sidereal angle - hours describes a ge o- graphical longitude p er relative angle as measured along the reference plane of the ecliptic.

Our modern measurement from Greenwich can be converted by adding the modern value west of Greenwich, or subtracting it east of Greenwich, with the Pyramid at 31E09:00 there - from.

The only time we include part of Fortune, etc. to adjudge any horoscope, is for event charts, natal, death, etc. All latitudes north of the arctic circle and south of the antarctic circle simply turn to retrograde motion. Same transits , same horoscope. It makes no difference. Remember that the daily horoscope is effective on the whole world, since we ’ re dealing with the predominant rulerships of the planetary Gods by hierarchical rule over the period of one sidereal day. We needn ’ t char t the entire day to analyze this since any two sidereal hour interval is generally reiterative for all twelve such intervals on any given day. The exception is the Moon since she traverses Earth ’ s caelestial firmament much faster than any other planet. On occasion, we ’ ll find that Mercury has entered the fray, by transit on any one of the meri d- ian house - cusps, as with the Moon. By contrast, more distant planets like Mars & Jupiter move more slowly over the course of a day, thus their daily meridian transits are more consistent, and less likely to affect changes in the predominant horoscope. Where the Moon & any other planet is likely to change the hor o- scope per acquiring proximity to a house - cusp is most readily found by comparing sy n odic velocities of the p lanets as shown near the right - hand column of Astrolog ’ s “ standard list ” charts.

Understand? Rather than spend several arduous hours charting each planetary transit over a two hour period, it ’ s vastly preferable to use the convenient animation feature of Astrolog. It ’ s very easy to do. Hold <Alt+r> to bring up the “ restrictions ” dialogue box & click on “ toggle cusps ” to un - restri ct any previously restricted cusps. Uncheck any cusps which got toggled to the r e- stricted status.

Set animation jump rate to minutes and jump factor to one, enable “ show graphics ” and you ’ re ready to study the horoscopic transits of the planets for that daily horoscope. Simply look for the most ruling planets at any time of day. The planets that you must include in your examination are, and in no particular order, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter & Saturn. We must also include the head & tail of the dragon since these rate on par with other planets in the horoscope. Take the true node, and mean lilith, for these values. The exception to this is when mean lilith is near the cusp - AND - oscillating lilith is more than about five d e- grees into the adjacent house; in those cases it is prudent to use oscililith <Enter - YL> for ca l- culation (true lilith is never more than ~5* from mean lilith). Notably, the Moon and head of the dragon decided what rulerships apply to our southing chart as shown above. Outer planets are not considered until after you have determined the predominant hor o- scope (Moon to Satur n). That means you can ignore Uranus, Neptune & Pluto for the time being, but be sure to include them for final analysis. For this example, set your date to D e- cember 21, 2012, and set your time to 11:11:23 UT. Longitude is set at 11E43:46, in order to matc h the solstice to the Sun at southing on the local meridian.

Until your familiarity with the signs and the planets becomes second nature to you, and you can readily see which planets are dominating the horoscope, and doing so for the greater part of any two hour interv al over any given day, you ’ ll discover that by animating your chart in two hour intervals, with “ show graphics ” off, that helps immensely to narrow down by process of eli - mination the most prominent horoscopes in that day as they will have the most ruling planets — this irrespec - tive of how many planets are fallen, debilitate or ex - alted.

This theme holds until the Moon ’ s transit 12:05:23 UT, giving us a one hour window from the time Mars reigns in the first house till the Moon abdicates by tran sit on the cusp. The Moon ’ s momentary sy n- odic velocity at the time of transit is 12.26 arcdegrees per solar day, just a little faster than the Moon ’ s average velocity; which reminds us that the Moon progresses by a little more than one arcdegree every two hours, delaying the lunar transit times, on the daily average three and a half minutes in horoscopic succession. In effect this proves that Mars is hierarchically acqui r- ing his rule in the first house, Moon fourth, Saturn eleventh then tenth house (Saturn ’ s inf e- rior & superior rulerships), and head of the dragon eleventh house. Therefore, the horoscope of Mars first house will be dominating come Friday, December 21st, 2012, beginning after 11:05 UT. Thus with Mars cornering the horoscope for the second part of the day on December 21st, 2012, then which of the planets abdicate to make room for this Red Planet? Actually, the a n- swer is Mars, who yields his reign in the eighth house to seize his rule in the first house. Remember that the five planets of evening and morning make two courts of rulership apiece. In this instance, Mercury ’ s transit at 10:04:52 UT, which was about one hour before Mars ’ transit at 11:05:10 UT, put Mercury ruling in the sixth house, Mars in the eighth house & Jupiter in the twelfth hous e. This theme is decidedly more malefic than Mars first house, on account of the Moon fallen tenth house and Saturn fallen fifth house, albeit the head & tail of the dragon enjoy exaltation for this interval before Mars transits the cusp about 11:05 UT as noted above. The key to this “ changing of the guard ” is the Moon ’ s comparatively rapid velo c- ity which is widening the window for Mars first house and closing the window on Mars ruling in the eighth house. Because Mercury ’ s synodic velocity is many times le ss than the Moon ’ s e.g. at Mercury ’ s transit 10:04:52 UT, Mercury ’ s momentary synodic velocity is +1.48 degrees per day while the Moon is charioting along over eight times that. Thus the Moon ’ s transit window is opening as Mercury ’ s window is closing relat ive thereto. See? But wait! Remember that we are only d o ing a horoscope for one day. The Moon ’ s acquiring reign in the fourth house is only temp o rary since she ’ s moving so rapidly. The Moon ’ s window will soon be closing and separating from the dominant the me. This Lagrange point is found when the Moon ’ s transit delta passes square with Mars, the following day December 22, 2012 about 12:56:46 UT. But we must understand that this is the daily average. Transits on a local meridian cusp will naturally vary, as much as by nearly five degrees of arc on MC and IC. Now the cusps of Earth ’ s houses are where her equally - divided meridians intersect the ecliptic. Because the obliquity of Earth ’ s rotational axis is nearly 23.44*, then her meridian cusps, which average t hirty degrees of arc around the Earth along the ecliptic plane, are pe r-"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Light & Sound 71 petually oscillating relative to the east point or first house - cusp and seventh house - cusp, which remain stationary at opposition east to west on the ecliptic. That means that planets t ransit the first and seventh cusps at 360*/day minus a planet ’ s momentary velocity; to wit planets in retrograde transit that much faster. Also the maximum oscillation is on the local meridian from midheaven to antemi d heaven. The rotational cycle of these cusp - oscillations repeats once each sidereal day. Notably the local Ascendant and Descendant cycle above and below the east point and seventh house cusp, a l- ternately over the course of each sidereal day, and is how “ fliptypes ” for Arabic parts or Greek lot s are determined — which also indicates magnitude, since the Ascendant ’ s oscillation i n- creases with latitude above or below the equator but that ’ s not important for now. We are d o- ing daily horoscopes, not event charts. This makes it much faster to look for c hanges in horoscope scenarios for any given day by looking at the planets ’ synodic motions, since the meridian houses average 30 degrees of ecliptic arc per sidereal day. This is the daily average of rulerships or global daily horoscope. This helps us to q uickly identify dominant rulerships, but is only a quick approximation. There ’ s more to it. The synodic motions and velocities of the planets are compared to their transits over the course of one day. As one horoscopic window closes another is invariably o pening. The Sun at southing on the local meridian is the de facto measure of a day, but the progression of the horoscope is essentially independent of the solar day, and is instead totally dependent on the sidereal day, and the aforesaid synodic aspects of the planets. For daily horoscopes, it ’ s much easier simply to look at planetary synodic aspects, and adjudicate based on these alone. But in order to reference planetary tran - sits to a specific location, this requires exactitude. And in any case we must always refer to a calendar of one kind or another, whether it ’ s gregorian or julian date, jewish, or islamic, mayan or aztec, or whatever other calendars you might prefer. Using the gregorian improvement to the old Roman calendar is the one most people are familiar with, hence the date Dec 21, 2012. But even the best calendars need a re f- erence meridian! In this day and age it ’ s the greenwich prime meridian that is our universal time - standard. In ancient times it was the giza pyramid, yet in more remote anti quity who knows where the prime meridian might have resided? Catastrophic crustal displacements can only leave one to wonder. It ’ s really just an arbitrary meridian but is our contemporaneous majority consensus which makes it become recognized as a prime o r universal meridian, our reference standard by which the Earth is measured, hence the Earth ’ s rotation and orbital motion is like - wise referenced. The point being, that it ’ s customary to reference the Sun at southing as the center of day, no doubt since the style or gnomon that casts shadows on the sundial is oriented t o- ward the nearest pole of Earth ’ s rotational axis — parallel to the Earth ’ s axis. Weather permi t- ting, at twelve o ’ clock noon the shadow extends momentarily straight off the end of the style"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"13 Baktun 72 in opposition to the Sun. That ’ s 12 PM LAT and is the gospel of ephemeris time. It ’ s the caelestial witness to the fact that it ’ s twelve noon on that day, and at that geographical long i- tude. With the DE406 ephemeris so refined and exacting, you can calcul ate the Sun at sout h- ing for your local meridian, then test it to see if the southing Sun doesn ’ t cast a perfectly straight shadow due north off the gnomon of your sundial, that is assuming you have one.

Or you could just set a plumbbob above a straightedge pointing due north, but that takes all the fun out of it. You wi ll find the JPL - DE406 ephemeris is accurate. In conclusion, there are two basic methods for making the daily horoscope. Using plan e- tary aspects alone is convenient but less accurate. The local method is far more accurate, but is more tedious and time - consu ming. For quarterly or yearly almanachs with meteorological and astrological prognostications, you ’ d probably use the greenwich meridian and coordinated universal time for all calculations. You needn ’ t fully chart the Sun at southing but at least ide n- tify what time it occurs for each day in question.
