Maier holds a prominent place among the apologists of the Rosicrucians and is be - lieved to have been in England in contact with Dr. Robert Fludd, also in the forefront of the early circle of those deeply involved in Rosicrucian lore. This volume is a photographic facsimile of the rare edition published in London in 1656 and may be the only work of Count Maier’s that exists in English. The rules of the Rosi - crucian Fraternity in the Fama issued by the order in 1615 are amplified here and the deportment advocated by those unknown philosophers is set forth. Special attention is given to the obligations of physicians and the higher ethics of medicine. This PRS Edition features an introductory Preface by Manly P. Hall.

Among the celebrities who assembled at his court was Michael Maier (1568· 1622), one of the outstanding scholars of his time. The Emperor ennobled Maier with the title of Pfalzgraf-- Count Palatine, and appointed him Private Secretary to His Royal Person. Maier was a practical chemist and asso- ciated with many researches in this field. Whether he was successful in accomplishing the transmutation of metals is uncertain, but his enthusiasm never waned. Maier visited England in 1615, and circumstantial evi- dence sustains the belief that he met Dr. Robert Fludd, a learned physician who divided his attention between the practice of medicine and dictating his voluminous writ- ings to an amanuensis when no patients were waiting in the office. Count Maier and Dr. Fludd were the most important Rosicrucian apologists of their time, but neither seems to have laid claim to actual membership in the Fraternity of the Rosie Cross. Maier published his Tbemis Aurea in 1618. The text was in Latin, and the work was printed in Frankfort by L. ]ennis. There were other early editions, including a translation into German. Gardner, in his catalog of Rosicrucian books, describes the volume as an important work containing the laws of the Rosicrucian Order. The first edition in English appeared in 1656, and includes a special dedication to the \"Honoured, Noble, Learned, Elias Ashmole, Esq.\" The introduction is still in Latin."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Count Michael Maier included references to the Rosicrucians in many of his later writings, and the infor- mation contained in the Verum Inventum is probably the most important. In the last section of this book the Rosicrucians are introduced as meriting universal esteem. The author makes the firm statement that the Brothers of R.C. actually exist to advance inspired arts and sciences and provide an asylum of piety in the mun- dane world. All the writings of Maier are rare, and only the Tbemis Aurea seems to exist in English. The book includes a curious anagram which Maier presents as the hand seal of the Brothers of R.C., and he recommends that ingenious persons should examine and interpret this device. It is obvious that the arrangement of letters can spell our ROSIE CROSS by the repetition of the same \"S.\" In the midst of them is a large capital \"M,\" which reminds the thoughtful reader that when the tomb of Christian Rosenkreuz was opened the mysterious book \"M\" was found therein. This large initial suggests one of the plates designed by Johannes Gichtel as a frontispiece for Jacob Boehme's Mysterium Magnum. According to his text the three \"M's\" stand for Moses, Messiah and Mysteriurn Magnum. John Hayden claims to have pub- lished the Rosicrucian book \"M\" under the title, The Wise Man's Crown: or the Glory of the Rosie Cross, (Lon- don, 1664). The text of this little volume hardly sustains Hayden's pretension, bur there is no other work with which it can be compared. It has long been suspected that the early publications supposed to have been issued by the Rosicrucian Society or its initiated members, including contemporary translations, contain ciphers. It is certainly significant that several works on cryptography appeared at about the same time. It is essential to possess an original edition or photographic copy to decode any message that could have"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"been concealed in the text. The present reprint meets this need. It is identical with the 1656 edition with one exception: the text has been slightly enlarged by photo- graphy so that it is easier to read, and possible peculiarities of type will be more evident. Those work- ing with Lord Bacon's biliteral cipher will find the enlargement of the letters especially helpful. If the biliteral cipher was used, it could be inserted into text in any language, even without the knowledge of the author, or after his death as no change of wording is involved. (See Bacon's Of the Advancement and Proficience of Learn- ing) We have added the engraved portrait of Michael Maier from the 1617 edition of his book, Symbola Aureae. He is presented in court costume, accompanied by his coat-of- arms. Manly P. Hall The Philosophical Research Society, Inc.
