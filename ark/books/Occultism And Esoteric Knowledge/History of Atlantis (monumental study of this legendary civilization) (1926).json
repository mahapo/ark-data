But it is my earnest wish t o place the study upon a scientific basis, and in so doing I attach the description of \"history\" to this work in the ho pe that the mere invocation of such a name will endow it with the spirit which should inspire all histories— a desire to arrive at fundamental truth by every available m eans. The volumes which I have already published on the subject have met with such widespread acceptance, a nd for the most part with such kindly and catholic cri ticism, that I am emboldened to proceed a step farther, and to attempt to cast the evidences of Atlantean civilisa tion, which I have already gathered into something resemb ling a historical narrative. Such an account, I am the f irst to admit, must have as many lacunae as it has facts , and must rely in large measure upon analogy and often u pon pure surmise. But in the first chapter of this volu me I have explained my reasons for employing certain met hods of approach which may seem too unfamiliar to the hi s- torian to meet with his ready acceptance. In the present volume I have arrived at many conclu - sions, and have brought forward much evidence which did not appear in my former works on the subject of Atlantis. For example, I have shown that the story of Atlantis, as painted upon the peplum of Pallas at the vii"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"viii Preface Athenian festival, has a very definite bearing upon the credibility of Plato's narrative, pre-dating it as it did by more than a century. I have also demonstrated that, so far from being mythical, the Egyptian sources fr om which Plato drew his material were very real indeed , and that he himself visited Egypt. Again, I have, I think, thrown much new light on th e character of the Atlantean invasion of Europe, on t he exact site of Atlantis, and especially on the great amoun t of evidence for the former existence of the island-con tinent which survives in British and Irish folklore and tr adition. British tradition, indeed, is the touchstone of Atl antean history, and the identification of Lyonesse with At lantis, and the grouping of Atlas with the British gods, Al bion and Iberius, should go far to prove the ancient ass ociation of our islands with the sunken continent. But it is from the acceptance of my theory of the e xist- ence of a definite Atlantean culture-complex, embod ying certain peculiar and associated customs, that I hop e to gain converts to the belief in a former widespread Atlan- tean civilisation having cultural outposts in Weste rn Europe and Eastern America, and connected with the motherland by way of the intervening islands. It is in this theory, I feel, that the strongest case for th e pre- existence of Atlantis resides, and I confidently pr esent it to my readers in the certainty that they will fa vourably consider a hypothesis which I devoutly believe appr oaches within measurable distance of the truth.

Before a task so stupendous the student of history might well sta nd dismayed. A sunken Rome, an earthquake-shattered Athens, would have bequeathed a thousand corroborat ive documents. Had Babylon or the entire Egyptian valle y sunk out of sight a thousand years before the birth of Christ they would still have left behind them the w itness of their trade with the Mediterranean, their potter y and other artifacts would have been found in Crete and Cyprus. Even so, let it be remembered, that the ver y site of Nineveh was forgotten, that until a century ago only the barest outlines of Babylonian and Egyptian history were known to us, that their written hierog lyphs were undecipherable. Is it too much to expect, then , that an archaeology which has been equal to the tas k of reconstructing the details of civilisations over wh ich time had cast a depth of shadows profound as that of oce an, should not be competent to approach the discussion of the more tangled problems connected with the recon- struction of the history of a continent which has b een submerged for twice as long as ancient Egypt endure d? It is here that it becomes necessary to say somethi ng regarding the writer's own views on the subject of his- torical science. It must be manifest how great a pa rt inspiration has played in the disentangling of arch aeo- logical problems during the past century. By the ai d of inspiration, as much as by that of mere scholarship , the hieroglyphs of Egypt and the cuneiform script of Ba by- lon were unriddled. Was it not inspiration which un veiled to Schliemann the exact site of Troy before he exca vated it? Inspirational methods, indeed, will be found to be those of the Archeology of the Future. The Tape- Measure School, dull and full of the credulity of i ncredu- lity, is doomed."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Introductory 3 Analogy is the instrument of inspiration, and, if w ielded truly, is capable of extraordinary results. Even no w Archaeology and Folklore are almost entirely depend ent for their results upon analogy. Only by comparison can we cast light upon the nature of unexplained custom s and objects, and in this volume the analogical method w ill be largely employed because it provides us with a fitt ing probe by whose aid we may pierce the hard crusts of oblivion which have gathered around the facts of At lan- tean history. Facts! Are we in possession of any facts relating t o Atlantis ? Is the very title, A History of Atlantis , not an insult to the intelligence of most readers ? If, on coming to the end of this book—should he reach the end—the reader cannot agree that a very fair case has been made out for the former existence of Plato's island-continen t, he will at least admit that the mere interest of the s ubject is sufficiently intriguing to permit of hypotheses bei ng erected in its favour. But that a basis of indisputable fac t lies at the roots of the Atlantean theory the writer stoutl y main- tains, and he pleads that in face of such an array of testi- mony as he has brought together it is merely childi sh to refuse belief to the main details of Plato's story. For that it is founded on material, historical or t radi- tional evidence, of still more ancient provenance i s mani- fest from the possibility of equating the statement s made in it concerning the geography, customs and religio n of Atlantis with those of neighbouring regions. It is possible to take Plato's account of Atlantis, piece by piece, and compare the statements made therein with simila r historical and archaeological data, to the complete vindica- tion of his narrative. And let it be said at once that Plato did not inten d his account of Atlantean affairs as allegorical or myth ical. That ancient plea is completely disposed of elsewhe re in"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"4 The History of Atlantis this book. There is reason to regard his narrative as more definitely related to fact than, say, Geoffrey of M onmouth's Historia Britanum, in which the pure ore of history is mingled with tradition. That he received it from an Egyptian source is undoubted, and there is no more reason to suspect the bona fides of his narrative than the re is to doubt those of any other account of antiquity in wh ich history shades off into tradition. Tradition, it is now being recognised, is, if used with sufficient safeguards, quite as capable of furnishi ng the historian with trustworthy data as the best atteste d docu- mentary evidence. Within recent years we have seen the figure of our British Arthur, once dim and mysterio us, slowly emerge from the mists of legend and take on the qualities and appearance of humanity. The writer ca n remember when Menes, the first King of the First Dy - nasty of Egypt, was regarded as purely mythical, wh ereas he is now known to have existed and to have had fai rly numerous forerunners. Even in the month in which th ese lines are written comes extraordinary evidence from Syria of the discovery of a sculptured head of Chri st dat- ing from the second century, and of the finding in the Russian Cyrillic versions of Josephus of a pen-pict ure of the great Founder of Christianity, which together c om- pletely destroy the arguments of those who have sou ght to prove the mythical character of our Redeemer. Du ring this month, too, it has been conclusively proved th at the bodies of Peter and Paul actually rest beneath the pave- ment of St. Peter's at Rome. We all recall the mann er in which we laughed at Sir Harry Johnstone's \"mythi cal\" okapi, before it was found, killed and stuffed for exhibi- tion, and how we sneered at Mr. Hesketh Pritchard's giant sloth until that notable traveller discovered its s table and a large piece of its skin in Patagonia. All these w ere \"traditions\" to some, truths to others."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Introductory 5 The bare idea of an Atlantis as described by Plato has been met with derision by generations of archaeolog ists, simply because no direct documentary evidence relat ing to its existence survived. But can one reasonably e xpect direct documentary evidence of a civilisation which totally disappeared more than eleven thousand years ago ? I t is manifest that another kind of proof than the docume ntary must be drawn upon to justify the existence of such a culture. Do we find in the countries which must hav e been contiguous to Atlantis the vestiges of such ci vilisa- tion as Plato only too briefly outlines ? It is the purpose of this book to try to prove that we do. In the final chapter it will be shown that what the writer has called \"t he Atlantean complex\" displays an association of custo m, rite and tradition which, as regards its amalgam of peculiar conditions, is displayed in no other part of the gl obe save that which stretches between the shores of Western Europe and Eastern America. On the coastal tracts o f these countries and in their insular outposts can b e traced a cultural complex, the separate existence of which clearly demonstrates that it must have emanated from some r egion in the Atlantic which now no longer exists. It is, the writer is convinced, by such a treatment of the Atlantis tradition that its verity will ultimately be justified. The Atlantean theory has received considerable dama ge from the wild assertions of enthusiasts, and perhap s from the frequently over-enthusiastic efforts of the wri ter him- self. But to approach it as certain archaeologists approach, say, the problems of pre-history, is to adopt a met hod extraordinarily vain and futile, for, as has alread y been said, it is only by the aid of imagination and inspiratio nal pro- cesses that a problem of such peculiarity and extra ordinary complexity can ever be unravelled.

But to wait upon the ocean to disgorge her secrets is to wait upon eternity. Let not the archa eologist then, professional or otherwise, look with too unfr iendly an eye upon a quest which has yet to grope among me thods, and hazard many a folly and many a piece of empiric ism ere it discover the instruments peculiarly applicab le to its needs. No scientist now sneers at what may seem the crazy methods by which generations of alchemists bu ilt up chemical science and steered it to a safe haven amo ng the exact sciences, and it is freely admitted that we a re still in the \"alchemical\" stage of Atlantean archaeology. The professional archaeologist may encounter a hundred things he dislikes and contemns in this history. He may, a nd probably will, deny it the very name of history. If he does so, I will not feel at all discountenanced, because I am per- suaded that the wildest guess often comes as near t he target as the most cautious statement when one is d ealing with profundities. Not that I desire to multiply or en- courage the haphazard method in the particular sphe re of Atlantean archaeology, but that I greatly sympathis e with that friend of Edison's who, on being told by the i nventor that there was no solvent for uric acid, returned t o his laboratory, mixed all the drugs it contained with t he ob- noxious poison—and found that eleven of them did di ssolve it!

As th e available translations of those passages in Plato's works which have reference to Atlantis seem to leave a go od deal to be desired, I have carefully compiled a new vers ion of them, basing my account of the Timaeus on the trans lations of Jowett (The Dialogues of Plato), and of R. D. Ar cher- Hind, and founding my version of the Critias on tha t of the Abbe Jolibois (Dissertation sur l'Atlantide, Lyons, 1846) and the excellent French translation of P. Negris ( La ques- tion de l'Atlantis de Platon, Congres internat. d'a rcheol. Athens, 1905). By a careful collation of these tran slations I believe I have produced an account which will pro ve of greater general use to students of the Atlantean pr oblem than any at present existing in English. This accou nt must not be regarded as a translation, but rather a s a com- pilation of translations of the Platonic account of Atlantis. At the same time I have taken all due care to avoid doing violence in any way to the original, which, in the following pages, is not rendered in its entirety, though very nearly so, no fact of importance having been omitted.

Yesterday, indeed, on leaving this place, when we reached the guest-chamber at the house of Critia s, where we are staying, we were discussing this very matter. Critias then told us a story from old tradition, wh ich you had better repeat now, Critias, to Socrates, that h e may help us to judge whether it will answer our purpose . Critias : Agreed, if Timaeus is pleased. Timaeus : I quite agree. Critias: Listen then, Socrates, to a tale which, st range though it be, is yet perfectly true, as Solon, the wisest of the seven, once said. He was a relation and friend of Dropidas, my great-grandfather, as he tells us hims elf in his poems, and Dropidas assured my grandfather, Cri tias, who, when an old man, repeated it to us, that there were great and marvellous exploits achieved by Athens in the days of old, which, through lapse of time and in th e course of generations, have vanished from memory. The most remarkable is one which it would be fitting for us to narrate, and so at once discharge our debt of grati tude to you and also praise the goddess at the time of her festival by a paean in her honour. Socrates: A capital proposal. But what was this fea t which Critias described on the authority of Solon a s actually performed of old by this city, though unre corded in history? Critias: I will tell you an old story which I heard from an aged man, for Critias was then nearly ninety yea rs of age, while I was about ten. It happened to be the \"children's day\" of the Apaturia, 1 and, as was customary, 1 A festival in honour of Dionysius, held in October , at which the young were enrolled in their clan."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Sources of Atlantean History 9 the boys enjoyed their pastime, our fathers giving us rewards for declaiming poetry. Much poetry by sever al authors was recited and, since that of Solon had th e virtue of novelty, many of the children sang his poems. Th en one of the kinsmen remarked (whether he believed so or merely wished to please Critias) that he considered that Solon was not only the wisest of mankind, but also the greatest of all poets. The old man was gratified, a nd said smiling: \"Yes, Amynandros, if he had not regarded p oetry merely as a side-issue, but had addressed himself s eriously to it, and if he had completed the account which he carried from Egypt, instead of being compelled to leave it un- written by reason of the troubles which he found he re on his return, I am of opinion that neither Hesiod nor Homer nor any other poet would have enjoyed so much fame as he.\" \"What account was that, Critias?\" asked Amynandros. \"It referred to a mighty achievement,\" he replied, \"and one which deserved to be exalted throughout the wor ld, a great deed which our city actually performed, but, owing to time and the destruction of the doers thereof, t he story has not come down to our days.\" \" Tell us from the beginning,\" said the other,'' th e tale that Solon told, and how and from whom he received it as true.\" \"There is in Egypt,\" said Critias, \"in the Delta, a t the head of which the river Nile divides, a province ca lled Sais, and the chief city of this province is also S ais, the birthplace of Amasis, the king. The founder of this city is a goddess whose name in the Egyptian tongue is Neit h, and in Greek, as the Egyptians say, Athena. The people of Sais are great lovers of the Athenians and claim a certain kinship with us. Now when Solon sojourned in this c ity he was most honourably entreated by its people, and when he inquired concerning ancient things of the priest s who were most learned therein, he found that neither he nor any other Greek knew anything about such matters. And"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"10 The History of Atlantis when he wished to lead them on to talk of ancient t imes, he told them of the oldest legends of Greece, of Ph oroneus, who was called the first man, and of Niobe, of the tale of Deucalion and Pyrrha, how they survived after the d eluge, and he reckoned up their descendants, and tried, by calcu- lating the periods, to count up the number of years that passed during the events he related. Then said o ne of the priests, a man well stricken in years: \"O Solon, So lon, ye Greeks are but children, and there is no Grecian wh o is an old man.\" And when Solon heard this, he said: \"W hat mean you by this?\" And the priest said: \"Ye are all young in your souls; for ye have not any old tradit ion, any ancient belief nor knowledge that is hoary with age . And the reason of it is this: many have been the destru ctions of mankind, and many shall be. The greatest are by fire and by water, but besides these there are lesser ones. For, indeed, the tale that is also told among you, how t hat Phaethon yoked his father's chariot, and, for that he could not drive in his father's path, he burnt up all thi ngs upon earth and was himself smitten by a thunderbolt and slain; this story has the air of a fable; but the truth co ncerning it is related to a deviation of the bodies that mov e round the earth in the heavens, whereby at long intervals of time a destruction through fire of the things that are upo n earth occurs.

But with you and other nations the commonwealth has only just been discove red, the use of letters and the other commodities that c ities require, and after the wonted term of years, like a recurring sickness, comes rushing on them the torrent from he aven, and it leaves only the unlettered and untaught amon g you, so that, as it were, ye become young again with a n ew birth, knowing nought of what happened in ancient times ei ther in our country or in yours. 1 \"For example, these genealogies, Solon, which you j ust now recounted of the people of your country, are li ttle better than children's tales.

This, of course, could not refer to Greece."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"12 The History of Atlantis And Solon said that on hearing this he was astonish ed, and used all urgency in entreating the priest to re late to him from beginning to end all about these ancient c itizens.

Accordingly I was quick to a ccept the task you imposed on us yesterday, thinking that for the most arduous part of all such undertakings, I mean supply- ing a story fitly corresponding to our intentions, we should be fairly well provided.

The next passage in Plato's works which has referen ce to Atlantis is his Critias, which purports to be an account by a person of that name of the circumstances of li fe in Atlantis, as recounted by Solon to Dropidas, the sp eaker's great-grandfather. 2 Nine thousand years before Solon's day, or about 9600 B.C., war broke out between the nations within the Pillars of Hercules and those beyond the m. Athens placed herself at the head of the Eastern pe oples, and the Kings of the isle of Atlantis led the Weste rn races. Atlantis was an isle greater than Asia (Asia Minor) and Lybia (North Africa) together, but it was swallowed up by a convulsion of the earth, and its site is now mark ed by dangerous quicksands which render the sea-routes in that region unnavigable. At this early period Athens was possessed of extens ive territories, her lands were fertile, and her inhabi tants numerous. As regards the Atlanteans, Critias explai ns to his hearers that he must render the names of their heroes into Greek. Solon, who had written an account of th eir history in verse, found that the priests of Sais ha d already given these names an Egyptian aspect. He would thus take a similar liberty, but would retain their sign ificance. His ancestor had possessed an account of these thin gs in writing, but he, Critias, was compelled to rely on his mem- ory for the facts, which he had heard in childhood, and which had deeply impressed themselves on his mind. 1 Critias means to say that he was struck by the sim ilarity of the ideal State as described by Socrates, to Athens, as shown in Solon's story. He, therefore, made an effort to recall every circu mstance of that story in the hope that it would serve Socrates' purpose to i llustrate his imaginary commonwealth. After this, Critias proceeds to expou nd the order of the universe before the creation of mankind. 2 It is, indeed, an amplification of Critias's accou nt of Atlantis in the Timaeus."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Sources of Atlantean History 17 The gods divided the earth into portions, both grea t and small, and to Poseidon or Neptune, god of the sea, had been awarded the isle of Atlantis, where he begat c hildren by a mortal woman. The island, which was not moun- tainous near the sea-coast, had in its midst a plai n, which is said to have had no equal for beauty and fertility. About six miles from this plain stood a low mountain, whe re dwelt an aboriginal inhabitant or autochthone, call ed Evenor, who, by his wife, Leucippe, had a daughter called Cleito. This girl, after the death of her parents, was espoused by Poseidon, who environed the mountain wi th mounds and ditches. The mounds were two in number, and the three ditches, which were filled with water from the sea, were placed at an equal distance one from the other, and rendered access to the mount impossible. The art of navigation was at this time unknown. Poseido n also set in the island two currents of water, one h ot, the other cold, which assisted its fertilisation exceed ingly. The god reared in this enchanted place five pairs o f male children, twins, of whom he was the father. He divi ded Atlantis into ten parts. He bestowed on his eldest born the maternal domain, which was the largest and best situated, and established the remaining princes in the other regions of Atlantis as chiefs of different nations.

By their wise industry they fill ed the capital city and the country with everything th at was useful and agreeable to existence. Their power proc ured them all the productions of foreign lands. Their is land furnished them with all kinds of stones and mineral s, and, above all, with that mineral known as orichalcum (m oun- tain copper) the most precious, next to gold, of al l the metals. The island also produced in abundance all k inds of timber suitable for building construction. It nourished numerous herds of animals, both domestic and wild, and large numbers of elephants. These found p lenty of food in the marshes, lakes and rivers, in the pl ains and the mountains. The soil also produced a wealth of r oots, wood, gums, flowers and fruits, the sweet juice of the grape, and corn, all desirable viands, and vegetables in t heir season. Shady trees sheltered its happy people, and divers fruits appeased their hunger and thirst, especially one wi th a hard rind, affording both meat, drink and ointment. In a word, there was to be found in this island, which h as so unhappily disappeared, everything which could satis fy the body, the spirit, and engender piety towards th e gods. By means of these natural riches the Atlanteans bui lt temples, palaces, bridges, directing the waters, wh ich flowed in a triple circle around their ancient metr opolis, in a useful manner.

At the landward end of this waterway, which was cap able of navigation by the largest vessels, they construc ted a harbour. The two zones of land were cut by large ca nals, by which means a trireme, or three-decked galley, w as able to pass from one sea-zone to another. The bridges b y means of which communication was had between the la nd- zones were sufficiently high to permit of the passa ge of vessels, and these were roofed over. The first sea- zone was about 1,800 feet wide, the second about 1,200 f eet, and the third, which immediately encircled the island, was about 600 feet in width. The diameter of the island on which the palace stoo d was five stadia, or about 1,000 yards. The isle and each zone were enclosed by stone walls. At the entrance to the bridges were gates, surmounted by defending tow ers. The bridge at the principal entrance was about 100 feet wide. The stone of which these immense piles were constructed was quarried from the island, and was b lack and black and red in colour.

Great baths were constructed, some open others walled and roofed in, as hot baths for use i n winter are. These were baths for the royal family, others were reserved for women, and even horses and other domes tic animals had bathing-pools of their own. Each bath was constructed with due regard to decency and the convenience of the several classes which it served.

Landward, the island presented a mountainous aspect , especially on that side of it which looked seaward. Around the royal city stretched a level plain, likewise ci rcled by mountains, except on the coast. The island looked southward. 1 The most elevated sites were the only parts of it exposed to the ravages of the wind. Our mountains give only a feeble idea of the mountains of that island. Their majestic height, their continuou s chain, the thick and tangled forests which covered them excited the liveliest admiration. Their slopes were covered with small towns, wealthy and populous, and diversified by rivers, lakes and prairies, furnishe d with abundant nourishment for an infinite number of wild beasts. In these forests all kinds of useful woods were to be found. The island had, coastwise, a lengthy aspect, but th e canal and the ditches caused it to lose somewhat of this appearance. The canal had an incredible depth, leng th and width. When one compares this work with other evidences of human industry the mind refuses to bel ieve that it was the handiwork of man. It flowed through the country for a distance of more than 1,000 miles , and received all the streams which descended from the mountains, traversing the city by way of several le sser canals, where it reached the sea.

The mountain country supplied an innumerable host of warriors.

FROM THE FOURTH CENTURY B . C . D IODORUS S ICULUS , a historian, of Agyrium, in Sicily, who flourished contemporaneously with Julius Caesar and Augustus, has vouchsafed us nearly as much info rma- tion regarding Atlantis and its history as did Plat o himself. His Historical Library is a general history of the world as known in his time, from the earliest ages to Cae sar's conquest of Gaul. If Diodorus was essentially a com piler, he was also a great traveller, and traversed a larg e part of Europe and Asia for the purpose of collecting ma terials for his work. Dealing with the geography of the eas tern Atlantic region in the fourth chapter of his third book, Diodorus asserts that the Amazons of Africa were mu ch more ancient and famous than those of Pontus in Asi a Minor. But they were not the only race of warlike women inhabiting African soil, the Gorgons being ne arly as celebrated for courage and valour. The Amazons inhabited an island called Hesperia (the Hesperides , or island of Hesperus, the evening star, son of Atlas, where grew the famous golden apples or oranges, guarded b y a dragon) lying to the west, near to the morass named Tritonides, a fen so called from the fact that it w as tra- versed by the River Triton. This morass borders upo n Ethiopia, under Mount Atlas, which itself extends t o the ocean. (I follow Diodorus in his use of the present tense). The island Hesperia, he says, is very large, abound ing in all sorts of fruit trees, herds of cattle and fl ocks of sheep 24"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Sources of Atlantean History 25 and goats. But corn is unknown to its inhabitants. The Amazons, inspired by war-like ambition, subdued all the cities of this island, with the exception o f one called Mena, accounted sacred, and now inhabited by the Ethiopians called Ichthophages, or fish-eaters. It is frequently scorched by eruptions of fire, which bre ak out of the earth, and is rich in precious stones. Having subdued many of the neighbouring African and Numidian tribes, the Amazons founded a great ci ty in the morass of Triton, which, from its shape, the y called Chersonesus, or the City of the Peninsula. B ut, not content with their numerous conquests, they inv aded Mount Atlas, a rich country, full of great cities, where the gods had their origin in those parts bordering upon the ocean. Led by Merina, their queen, an army of 30,00 0 foot and 2,000 horse, clad in serpent skins, and ar med with swords, javelins and bows, with which they were mos t expert, hurled itself upon the country of the Atlan tides, and routed those which dwelt in the city of Cercene s. They pursued them so closely that they entered the town at their heels, and took it by storm, putting the m en to the sword and carrying off the women and children as ca p- tives. The remaining Atlantean communities, stricke n with panic fear, submitted incontinently, whereupon Merina made a league with them, built another city in place of Cercenes, calling it by her own name, and peopled it with the captives and other Atlanteans. The Atlanteans, who appear to have entertained a wholesome dread of the warrior-queen, showered rich gifts and honours upon her, and this treatment seem s quite to have won her heart. Shortly afterwards, th e Atlanteans, being attacked by the Gorgons, Merina, at their request, invaded the country of the Gorgons, slaying large numbers of them and taking 3,000 prisoners.

Diodorus then proceeds to give a more particular ac count of the Atlanteans, and the fabulous statements they made of the genealogy of the gods, which, he says, do no t differ much from the fables of the Greeks. The Atlanteans, he tells us, inhabited a rich count ry bordering upon the ocean, and were notable for thei r hospitality to strangers. They boast that the gods were born among them, and say that the most famous poet among the Greeks confirms this assertion when he makes Hera s ay: \"The utmost bounds of earth far off I see Where Thetys and old Ocean boast to be The parents of the gods.\" They assert 1 that Uranus was their first King, and that he civilised the people, causing them to dwell in c ities and till the soil. He had under his dominion the gr eater part of the world, especially toward the west and n orth. Addicted to the study of Astrology, he prophesied m any future events, and instituted the solar year and th e lunar month as measures of time. The people, struck with admiration for his skill, paid him divine honours a fter he was dead, and called the starry heavens after his n ame. 1 Diodorus in this passage seems to speak of the Atl antean State as if it existed in his time. He may, of course, refer to the people of Atlas in Africa, as some parts of his narrative would see m to indicate; but that his account has, as regards its more ancient a pplication, a reference to Atlantis, the southern continent, and not to the remains of its population in Africa, cannot be doubted."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Sources of Atlantean History 27 Uranus had forty-five children by various wives, an d eighteen by Titea or Terra, who thus came to be kno wn as Titans, or the Terrene people. His most celebrat ed daughters were Basilea, and Rhea or Pandora. Basile a, the elder, was so solicitous in her care for her br others that she came to be known as the Great Mother, and on the demise of Uranus was elected queen by the gener al suffrages of the people. She espoused her brother Hyperion, and bore him Helio and Selene, later the gods of sun and moon respectively. But her remaining bro thers, dreading that Hyperion might usurp the throne, slew him and drowned the infant Helio in the River Eridanus or Po, in Italy. Selene, his sister, who passionately loved her brother, cast herself from the housetop and per ished. Basilea, on learning of the death of her children, became demented, and wandered up and down, with hair dis- hevelled and bedizened with ornaments, playing wild ly on the timbrel and cymbal.

The Atlantides became the constel lation of the pleiades, and were adored as goddesses. Nymp hs, too, were commonly called Atlantides, \"because nymp hs is a general term in this country applied to all wo men.\" Saturnus, the brother of Atlas, was profane and cov e- tous.

In the country called Hesperis, he says , dwelt two famous brothers, Hesperus and Atlas.

In gratitude Atlas taught him the art of Astrology, instructing him in the use of the sphere , from which circumstance the Greeks invented the fable th at Hercules had for a season relieved Atlas of his bur den in bearing the world upon his own shoulders. Elsewhere, in the fourth chapter of his Fifth Book, Dio- dorus confirms in a measure the statement of Plato con- cerning the submergence of a portion of the Greek p enin- sula. He states that the Hellenic coast opposite th e island of Rhodes and Cos was so damaged by the flood of De u- calion, which occurred in the Seventh Generation, t hat it lay \"under pressing and grievous calamities, for th e fruits of the earth were rotted and spoiled for a long tim e together, famine prevailed, and through corruption of the air, plague and pestilence depopulated and laid the towns and cities waste.\" Diodorus, in his Fifth Book, also states that a cer tain Atlantic island was discovered by some Phoenician n aviga- tors, who, while sailing along the west coast of Af rica, were driven by violent winds across the Ocean. They brou ght back such an account of the beauty and resources of the island, that the Tyrrhenians, having obtained the m astery of the sea, planned an expedition to colonise the n ew land, but were hindered by the opposition of the Carthagi nians. Diodorus does not mention the name of the island; a nd he differs from Plato by referring to it as still exis ting.

The passage is as follows: \"Poseidonius correctly s ets down in his work the fact that the earth sometimes rises and undergoes settling processes, and changes that result from earthquakes and other similar agencies, all of which I, too, have enumerated above. And on this point he does well to cite the statement of Plato t hat it is possible that the story about the island of Atlanti s is not a fiction. Concerning Atlantis, Plato relates that So lon, after having made inquiry of the Egyptian priests, report ed that Atlantis did once exist, but disappeared—an island no smaller in size than a continent; and Poseidonius t hinks that it is better to put the matter in that way tha n to say of Atlantis: ' Its inventor caused it to disappear, just as did the Poet the, wall of the Achseans.'\" Pomponius Mela (b.

A bay of this continent in the latitude of the Caspian Sea, was inhabited by Greeks, who on ce in thirty years sent certain of their number to minist er to the imprisoned Saturn. One of these paid a visit to the great island, as they called Europe, and from him the nar rator learned many strange things, especially regarding t he state of the soul after death.

Longinus believed that the Atlantean episod e in the Timceus was simply a literary ornament without either historic truth or philosophic significance. Syrianu s, Pro- clus's master, regarded the tale as historically ac curate, and as a symbol of the dogmatic philosophers. Ameli us saw in it the opposition of the fixed stars and the planets, Numenius that of good to evil. Origen, the Christia n father, considered the account as an allegory of th e con- stant war between the good and evil genii, and Porp hyry saw in it the strife between the flesh and the spir it. Iamblichus was of the opinion that its circumstance s bore a striking resemblance to the war between the Greek s and Persians, the strife of the Gods and Titans, and th e com- bat between Osiris and Typhon or Set, or the contin ual strife between chaos and order, duality against uni ty, The notions of the Alexandrian School with referenc e to Plato's account are to be found in the Eighteenth B ook of Ammianus Marcellinus, who mentions the destruction of Atlantis as an historic fact. The Byzantine geograp her, Cosmos Indicopleustes, in his Christian Topography, in- cluded Atlantis in his cosmographical system, hut a ltered its circumstances so as to agree with scriptural au thority. He believed that the earth was flat, and that a vas t conti- nent environed the ocean. On this continent man had his origin, and for its existence he invokes the author ity of the Timaeus. Plato's account, he thought, was a legacy of the original Mosaic tradition, but Atlantis was to be l ooked for in the east, and was the land of the ten generation s of Noah. Coming to later times, Serranus, in 1578, declared that he had discovered in the Mosaic writings the sesame to the stone which blocked the entrance to the Atlantean labyrin th. The hint was avidly seized upon by Huet, Bochart and Vo ssius, an eager trio, who by ingenious misreadings of the Pen tateuch, bemused their credulous contemporaries into an acce ptance of Plato's island as the theatre of patriarchal his tory."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"34 The History of Atlantis But widespread as was agreement with their conclu- sions, they seemed to Mathew Olivier, a grave advoc ate of Marseilles, to miss the point and pith of Serran us's main argument. Enlarging upon his master's theory, Olivier placed Atlantis in Palestine itself, assumi ng, logic- ally enough, that if the Biblical patriarchs were i n reality the denizens of Atlantis, and were known historical ly to have inhabited the Holy Land, that region must indu bit- ably have been Atlantis! About a quarter of a centu ry later, in 1754, Eumenius, a learned Swede, developi ng the views of Olivier, pushed the theory to its natu ral con- clusion, and explained the entire Atlantean mytholo gy by means of Jewish history. He had, however, been prec eded by another Scandinavian of even more portentous eru di- tion, for in 1692 Olaus Rudbeck had published his a maz- ing Atlantica, which, in a weird spirit of patrioti sm, main- tained that the Norse Edda rather than the Mosaic w ritings held the true interpretation of the Atlantean secre t. For him Sweden was Atlantis, and Upsala the capital of Plato's island-continent. In four folio volumes he undertoo k to prove that the Scandinavian peninsula was not only the centre from which all European civilisation had rad iated, but the source of an original world-mythology of wh ich the Edda was a surviving fragment. The theory of a northern site for Atlantis dies har d. Indeed it still survives, for M. Gattefosse of Lyon s has triumphantly asserted it in his La Verite sur l'Atl antide, published so lately as 1923. But he had a worthy fo re- runner in Bailly, a contemporary of Voltaire, who, like Rudbeck, sought to discover the Atlantean region in the frozen north. Not long before Buffon had made popul ar the idea that the \"central fire\" which maintained t he temperature of the earth had cooled in the course o f ages, and Bailly, seizing upon the notion, boldly asserte d that the now frozen north had formerly enjoyed almost tr opical"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Sources of Atlantean History 35 climatic conditions. Its inhabitants during the tor rid period, he maintained, were the Atlanteans of Plato , who upon the gradual cooling of the region, betook them selves to Asia, carrying with them their scientific knowle dge and religious beliefs, which they scattered broadca st among the nations. In his History of Ancient Astron omy and Letters on Atlantis he brought to bear the whol e battery of his learning to prove that Spitzbergen was once a fertile and populous country, and was, indeed, the veri- table Platonic Atlantis. Strangely enough, his thes is has assumed the quality of legend, and in some parts of Northern Europe the tradition still flourishes that some- where in the neighbourhood of the North Pole fertil e valleys actually exist. In fact the belief has late ly received a new lease of life from the statements of recent e xplorers of the Far North from the American side, who have provided glowing accounts of low-lying valleys in t he polar area, fragrant with flowers and swarming with butterflies. Bailly was a thorough-going disciple of Euhemerus o f Thessaly, and believed that all myth had a historic al basis. For him Atlas was a king of the once tropica l Spitzbergen-Atlantis, an actual human ruler and a d istin- guished astronomer, the inventor of the sphere. His Hyperborean Atlanteans finally came to rest, after a prolonged migration, on the plains of Tartary. But Bailly's farrago of erudite nonsense was much too g ross even for that somewhat credulous Paris which was th en on the brink of a human catastrophe even more stupe n- dous then the wreck of Atlantis. In his Lettre Amer icain the Comte de Corli, while neatly disposing of Baill y's absurdities, sprung on a readily accepting public t he theory that Atlantis was none other than the Americ an continent itself.

But an even more erudite and determined effort to locate Atlantis elsewhere, in Asia, to wit, was tha t made anonymously in 1779, and by Delisle de Sales, a mem ber of the Institute, in his History of the Atlanteans. De Sales attempted to prove, by the aid of geology, th at the actual Atlantis had been situated in a vast ancient sea which formerly occupied the site of Greece and a la rge part of the Italian peninsula. The globe, he arg ued, had in primitive times been almost completely covered b y water, but in the course of ages this had evaporate d, leaving, however, an immense sea, which united the Caspian to the Persian Gulf, and the Indian Ocean t o the Mediterranean. From the midst of this ancient oc eanic waste ran the Caucasus range, and this De Sales ide ntified with the early Atlantis. Thence migrated its cul tured inhabitants, one stream betaking itself to the Atla s range, then also an insular sub-continent, and another to Central Asia. The Atlantis of Plato De Sales disposed of by identifying it with the Ogygia of Homer, the magica l island of the enchantress Calypso, situat ed \"between Italy and Carthage,\" and this, he averred, had been destroyed by an earthquake, the island of Sardinia remain- ing as a fragment of the wreckage. The Atlantean s he called \"the benefiters of humanity,\" and described his system as \"the key to ancient history.\" A little later Bartoli, in his Essai sur l'explicat ion, tendered a hypothesis seemingly more modest, but in reality equally bizarre. Solon, he said, had invent ed the fable of Atlantis, and had made it the subject of an allegorical and political poem, in which the Atlant eans represented the Athenian faction of the Paraliens. Plato, seizing upon this fiction, had adopted it to later events,"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Sources of Atlantean History 37 among them the Peloponnesian war. Plato's Atlantean s who besieged Athens, were, according to Bartoli, th e Persians, and the whole story a mythic representati on of their struggle with Hellas and their final overthro w. Equally curious are the attempts made to identify t he lost Atlantis with America. Treatises on the subjec t began to appear shortly after the discovery of Amer ica, and extraordinary efforts seem to have been made to attach the name of Plato's island to the new contin ent. In 1553 Gomara in his Historia de las Indias unhesi tatingly identified America with Atlantis, and eight years l ater Guillaume de Postel drew attention to the similarit y of the native name for Mexico, Aztlan, with that of At lantis, which he proposed to confer on the New World. Bacon in his Nova Atlantis identified America with Plato' s isle, although certainly in such a spirit of fantasy as m ight be employed by Sir J. M. Barrie. In any case he places it in the Pacific. But that Shakespeare had at least s ome memory of the Atlantis story at the back of his min d when he set the scene of his Tempest in a fantastic Atlantic isle, seems not improbable. But the French geographers, Nicholas and Guillaume Sauson, were by no means designedly fantastic in th eir methods. In 1689 they published an atlas representi ng the primitive geographical divisions of America, it s parti- tion between the ten royal families who had issued from Poseidon, the father of Atlas, and displaying those portions of the Old World which, according to Plato's story, they had succeeded in colonising. So late as 1762 Robert de Vaugoudy produced a similar atlas in verification o f the theories of the Sausons, to the accompaniment of Vo ltaire's ribald and inextinguishable laughter.

The ten Kings of Atlantis were for some of them representative of th e ten great antediluvian epochs, and they argued that the history of Atlantis was in reality an allegorical a ccount of the early history of mankind.

As regards Plato's account, many of his commentator s, from Proclus to Jowett, have given it as their cons idered opinion that it was merely a fable, \"a noble lie,\" invented by Plato. \"It appears to me,\" says Archer-Hind, \"im pos- sible to determine whether Plato has invented the s tory from beginning to end, or whether it really more or less represents some Egyptian legend brought home by Solon.\" 1 Elsewhere he remarks upon the improbability of the story.

Plato, then, took more than usual care to stress the historicity of his account. The fact of Solon's visit to Egypt also appears as indubitable. Plutarch in his Life of Solon (ch. 26) and his De Iside et Osiride (ch. 10) states that Solon visited Egypt and spoke with the priest Sonchis at Sais. Th is, according to Clement of Alexandria, was also the na me of the priest who instructed Pythagoras in the scie nce of the Egyptians. Proclus in his dissertation on th e Timaeus says that Plato also visited Egypt and conv ersed at Sais with the priest Pateneit, at Heliopolis wit h the priest Ochlapi, and at Sebennytus with the priest E thimon. He mentions that Pateneit is undoubtedly the priest alluded to in the Timaeus. It is stated in the Critias that Solon had written a great epic poem on Atlantis, and that his notes on the su bject had come down to the younger Critias. These he had received from his grandfather, Critias, the son of Dropidas. Now the second Critias, according to a genealogy pr eserved by Proclus, was a cousin-german of Plato's mother. Ast and Kleine, in their critiques on Plato's works , give it as their belief that it was he who first brought th e Atlantean tradition from Egypt. Plutarch expressly upholds Pl ato's statement that Solon intended to write a poem on At lantis, but was compelled to renounce his intention on acco unt of his great age. In the Timaeus Plato eloquently e xpresses his regret that he had not carried out his plan. Ma rtin in his Dissertation sur l'Atlantide (p. 323) gives it as his considered judgment that Plato, knowing himself to be related to Solon, had piously attempted to carry ou t the intention of his blood-relation, and for this purpo se had employed the traditional material which had come do wn to him as the basis of his narrative.

It is, of course, w ell known that Sais, where Solon heard the story of Atlantis, was a city closely associated with Greece. It was, indeed , a centre of Greek culture. The period of its greatest pros- perity was between 697-524 B.C., and one of its mon archs, Psammetichus, maintained himself on the throne by a id of Greek mercenaries. He educated his sons in Greek learning, and encouraged the resort of Greeks to hi s capital. This intercourse between Sais and Athens was especi ally promoted by their worshipping the same deity, Neith - Athene, and hence there arose the notion that Cecro ps the Saite had led a colony to Athens. The priests of Sa is seem, indeed, to have been anxious to curry favour with t he Athenians by discovering resemblances between Attic and Egyptian institutions. A separate quarter in Sa is was assigned to the Greeks. So strong, indeed, was the Hel- lenic element in Sais that it was a matter of debat e whether the Saites colonized Attica or the Athenians Sais. This being so, if the priests of Sais related the s tory of Atlantis to Solon, they must almost certainly have retailed it to the many other Greeks with whom they constant ly associated. That no other definite account of their doing so is in existence is not surprising when we take i nto con- sideration the commercial character of the Hellenes with whom they must have come into contact. But, if Plat o's account had not been inherited from Solon, and had its Egyptian form not been current in Sais, there were thous- ands of Greeks there who could have contradicted it , and that some negative of the kind would have reached A thens sooner or later seems very clear, when we recall th e extra- ordinary interest which Plato's tale certainly arou sed in the ancient world."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"42 The History of Atlantis With regard to a totally different aspect of Plato' s account, it is extraordinary how well the circumsta nces of his story fit in with those which the science of ar cheology assures us must have obtained in early Europe. This point will be treated in detail later on. It is sufficien t to say here that the approximate date of Plato's account of the Atlantean invasion agrees with that at which the Azilian-Tard enoisian peoples, the ancestors of the Iberian race, undoubt edly swarmed into Europe, and those European and African regions which he regarded as tributary to Atlantis. \"Libya as far as Egypt, and Europe to the borders o f Etruria,\" are precisely those regions in which the proto- Iberians found their firmest footing. The Timaeus states that Athens set Europe free from the Atlantean tyranny. That there was no Athens existin g at that date (9600 B.C.) of which Plato speaks, is certain. The date in question is thousands of years prior to the First Egyptian Dynasty, and all that has been found on the site of Athens of an older date is a small quan tity of Neolithic or New Stone Age pottery. At the same tim e, as we shall see, Europe and Africa were not then in a state of abject barbarism, and it may be that the memory of the resistance offered by the natives to the increasing hordes of proto-Iberians was dimly remembered by their people s across the intervening centuries. \"In later times,\" said Solon's Egyptian informant, \"after there had been exceeding great earthquakes a nd floods, there fell one day and night of destruction ; and the warriors in your land all in one body were swal lowed up by the earth, and in like manner did Atlantis si nk beneath the sea and vanish away.\" Here it is notice able that the Greeks are destroyed by a terrestrial, and the Atlanteans by a marine agency, and I believe that w e have in this passage a clue to the true historical chara cter of Plato's account. Pallas Athene, the patron goddess of "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Historical Sources Examined 43 Athens, was the sworn enemy of Poseidon, the god as soci- ated with Atlantis as its eponymous deity and found er, and the strife she waged with him for possession of Ath ens is celebrated in Greek mythology. Now one of the schol iasts of Plato states that the victory of the Athenians o ver the Atlanteans was actually represented in a symbolical pep- lum or woman's garment, dedicated at the Lesser Pan - athenaea, or festival of Athena. The inference, the n, is that the strife between the Athenians, the people of Ath ene, and the Atlanteans, the folk of Poseidon or Neptune, go d of the sea, came to have for the former a definitely h istorical character, enshrining a veritable folk-memory. The Panathenaea, it may be mentioned in passing, was fo unded at least 125 years before Plato's time, so that, if we can rely on the scholiast's statement, the tradition of the Athenian war with the Atlanteans, whether mythological or hi storical, must have been well known to the Athenians more tha n a century before Plato's day, and this would at once dispose of the oft-repeated assumption that he deliberately manu- factured the story. \"That it was entirely an invent ion of Plato's,\" remarks the shrewd Philip Smith, in his a rticle on \"Atlantis\" in William Smith's Dictionary of Gree k and Roman Geography, is hardly credible. . . . The lege nd is found in other forms which do not seem to be entire ly copied from Plato.\" This reminds us of Strabo's quo ta- tion from Poseidonius, that it is more reasonable t o believe that Atlantis once existed and then sank, than to s ay that \"its inventor caused it to disappear.\" It may be said that if the statement regarding the pep- lum is true, Plato merely took a local myth for the basis of his tale. Wherefore, then, did he lay stress upon t he truth of his account, and derive it from an Egyptia n source ? It is manifest that Plato must have known of the Athenian version depicted on the peplum.

The reaso n that he laid stress upon its Egyptian version was, perhaps, merely because that gave it a more ancient sanction , and corroborated and strengthened what might seem to th e ignorant a mere local tradition, which had no docum entary evidence behind it, and which might have been mista ken for a local invention but for its collation with an d amplifica- tion by the Egyptian account. Indeed, it seems poss ible that Plato had this intention quite as much in view as the illustration of his political thesis. When we recall the strife between Pallas Athenae an d Poseidon, which appears, as we have already said, t o have a distinct bearing upon the Atlantean legend in Gre ece, it is scarcely strange to find a writer in The Occult Review for September, 1923, discovering in the \"Odyssey\" of Ho mer further evidences of the Atlantean implications of this mythological feud. Odysseus, on his return from Tro y, lands on the island of the Cyclops, and succeeds in escaping from that dangerous proximity only after many despe rate adventures. Indeed, as the writer states: \"We have in the Odyssey, as narrated by Homer, an account of the Ho meric hero, Odysseus, whose wanderings and adventures wer e in reality one prolonged struggle with Poseidon, that is with the Atlantean deity.\" In the isle of Ogygia, where he is made prisoner by the enchantress Calypso, the daugh ter of the \"magician\" Atlas, he is aided by Athene, who ha s taken him under her protection.

Thus we find Pallas Athena;, the godde ss of Athens, doubly connected with the personalities of Atlan- tis. The circumstances that she takes Odysseus' par t against Poseidon the Atlantean god and his granddau ghter, Calypso, the daughter of Atlas, goes to strengthen the assumption of her connection with the Atlantean myt h as already outlined above. The truth of the statement that \"to this day the oc ean is impassable and unsearchable, being blocked by ve ry shallow shoals, which the island caused as she sett led down,\" is abundantly testified to by several writer s of antiquity. Scylax of Caryanda, who wrote prior to t he time of Alexander the Great, and was approximately a con- temporary of Plato, states in his Periplus that Cer ne, an island on the African Atlantic Coast, \"is twelve da ys coast- ing beyond the Pillars of Hercules, where the parts are no longer navigable because of shoals, of mud and of s ea- weed. . . . The seaweed has the width of a palm, an d is sharp towards the points so as to prick.\" When Himilco parted from Hanno in the course of the ir voyage from Carthage in quest of lands unknown, abo ut 500 B.C., he encountered, according to the poet Fes tus Avienus, \"weeds, shallows, calms and dangers,\" in t he Atlantic. Avienus wrote about the fourth century A . D ., but professes to repeat Himilco's account. He says: \"No breeze drives the ship forward, so dead is the sluggish wind of this idle sea. He (Himilco) also adds that there is much seaweed among the waves, and that it often hol ds the ship back like bushes. Nevertheless he says tha t the sea has no great depth, and that the surface of the earth is barely covered by a little water. The monsters of t he sea move continually hither and thither, and the wild b easts swim among the sluggish and slowly creeping ships.\" Avienus also says elsewhere:\" Farther to the west f rom these"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"46 The History of Atlantis Pillars there is boundless sea.\" Himilco relates th at ...\" none has sailed ships over these waters, becau se propelling winds are lacking. . . . likewise becaus e dark- ness screens the light of day with a sort of clothi ng, and because a fog always conceals the sea.\" Aristotle, too, says in his \" Meteorologica \" that the sea beyond the Pillars of Hercules was muddy, shallow a nd al- most unstirred by the winds. Aristotle was at one t ime a pupil of Plato, and this would seem to afford good proof that the latter's statement was founded on the best available information, and was probably acquired from Phoenic ian or Greek seamen. But we have other than classical evidence for the u n- navigable character of the Atlantic, evidence datin g from a considerably later period. Edrisi, the Arabic write r, says that the Magrurin, certain Moorish sailors of Lisbo n who set sail thence in quest of an Atlantic island at s ome un- defined period between the eighth and twelfth centu ries, encountered an impassable tract of ocean, and were forced to alter their course, apparently reaching one of t he Canaries. The Pizigani map of 1367, too, has a rubr ic containing a solemn protest against attempting to s ail the unnavigable ocean tract beyond the Azores, in the n eigh- bourhood of which the Sargasso Sea begins. The details of the Critias now command our attentio n. The first point that strikes us here is the stateme nt of Critias that the priests of Sais had already given the names of the Atlanteans in the account an Egyptian aspect , and that he (Critias) had been forced to render them \"i nto Greek.\" Had the story been fabulous he would scarce ly have taken the trouble to make this clear. But it i s diffi- cult to see how, precisely, the names of Poseidon o r Atlas could have been translated into Egyptian. The Egypt ians had no deity corresponding to Poseidon, and none wh o could very readily be equated with Atlas, the earth -bearer."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Historical Sources Examined 47 However, the deities mentioned in the account of Di odorus can readily be associated with Egyptian forms, and it may have been that Critias or Plato merely fell back on the names current in the local Athenian version of the Atlant ean legend connected with the Panathenaea. This would certainly account for the appearance of Poseidon, w ho was closely associated in myth with Pallas Athenae, the patroness of the city, and who was the sole begette r of the Atlantidae. The only name of the sons of Poseidon which has bee n vouchsafed us in its Atlantean form is that of Gadi r, \"who had for his portion the extremity of this island ne ar the Pil- lars of Hercules, and that part of it has since bor ne the name Gadiric.\" This equates with the classical name for the vicinity of Cadiz in Spain, and assumes a close pro ximity between the Spanish and Atlantean coasts. The details concerning the topography and site of A t- lantis I propose to discuss in the chapter which de als with its geography. Here it may serve to consider some m inor but nevertheless striking points. The climate of At lantis appears, according to Plato's account, to have corr esponded closely to that of the Canary Islands, but two circ umstances combine to give it a distinctly African aspect: the state- ment that large herds of elephants roamed the marsh land, and that \"a fruit with a hard rind\" affording both meat, drink and ointment, flourished there. This can refe r only to the coconut. Much has been made of these stateme nts, pro and con. The presence of the elephant as a cont em- porary of man in southern Europe is usually regarde d as \"not proven\" by archaeologists, but there seems no good reason for doubting its relatively late existence i n an environment better fitted to it climatically, and p robably African in character.

But it may be remarked in passing that Pla to's observations upon them are in consonance with what we know of the early \"Azilian\" civilisation of Spain a nd Southern France. In these areas the bull was worshi pped, and the ceremony attending its sacrifice, which Pla to des- cribes, might well have been illustrative of some d im folk- memory of a barbaric rite of the Azilian era, which in some of its aspects continued to survive to \"classical\" times, and the last vestiges of which still linger in the sport of bull-fighting. Bull-baiting, even in England, conti nued to have a semi-religious significance until the beg inning of the eighteenth century, and was associated with a cere- monial undoubtedly of pagan descent. That it surviv ed elsewhere in Europe until a relatively late period can also abundantly be demonstrated. Plato's account of Atlantean history breaks off sho rt, and was probably left unfinished because of his dea th. He undoubtedly employed it to illustrate his ideas regard- ing the perfect human political state, but that is not at all to say that he invented it for this reason. Tha t its architectural details have a Greek as well as a Per sian colouring is only natural, but it is not necessary to infer from the latter circumstance that he intended it as an allegory of the Persian War, as has so often been s tated. Indeed, many of its details, for example, the insul ar and maritime character of Atlantis, render such a theor y quite untenable. But Plato's account, considered as a who le, is in itself the best refutation of such an assumpt ion. The account of Diodorus raises a very different set of problems. It at once involves us in a consideration of the question as to how far the Greek myth of the Hesper idcs has a bearing on the question of Atlantis. In one p assage Diodorus seems to place Atlantis on the West Coast of Africa, in any case it \"borders upon the ocean,\" an d does"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Historical Sources Examined 49 not definitely appear as an insular region. Indeed, the island Hesperia, inhabited by the Amazons, agrees m uch more closely with the details of Plato's account, a s regards its site, except that it is described as destitute of corn. It is volcanic and prone to earthquakes, and is ful l of fruit trees and herds of sheep and goats, as the Ca naries still are. But I think I can discern in the descrip tion of the Amazons a close resemblance to the Azilian peop le who invaded Europe some 10,000 years ago, as observ ed in their cave-paintings still extant. This race, th e pro- genitors of the Iberians, were the first inventors of the bow, and their effeminate appearance, and their man ner of wearing their hair dressed on the crown of the head , may have struck their enemies as womanish. The history of Atlantis, as alluded to by Diodorus, can only be understood by comparison with the details of Greek mythology. But the statement of Diodorus that \"it i s reported \" that an Atlantic tract was swallowed up by the sea, is valuable as illustrating the fact that near ly four hundred years after Plato's time the belief in the founder- ing of an Atlantic region was widely current. We sh ould also not ignore the statement of a writer so compar atively early as Poseidonius that the account of Plato ough t not to be regarded as fiction, as the earth was known t o have undergone changes, a statement in which he is backe d by Strabo, and which shows that in the late pre-Christ ian era geological opinion in support of the Atlantean theory was beginning to take shape. Indeed, as Philip Smit h observes in the account already alluded to: \"Those who regard it (the story of Atlantis) as pure fiction, but of an early origin, view it as arising out of the very an cient notion, found in Homer and Hesiod, that the abodes of departed heroes were in the extreme west beyond the river Oceanus, a locality naturally assigned as beyond th e boundaries of the inhabited earth.

He says in effect that, if the belief in Atlantis was a mythological one, o r in some way connected with the religious or fictional histo ry of the Greeks, the protagonists of that theory cannot leave it at that, but must adduce proof to account for it s mytho- logical origin. It cannot be too strongly stressed that all tradition has a basis of fact. Races, when semi-civ ilised or barbarous, do not deliberately manufacture such notions as that which averred that the Fortunate Is les in the west were the places of reward of departed h eroes. A hundred myths could be adduced to show that such ideas actually arise out of a memory of a western r egion from which early migration proceeded. And it is of special interest in connection with the problem bef ore us that some of the skull-burials of the Azilian pe ople already mentioned are so disposed that the faces lo ok towards the west—a certain sign that that region wa s regarded as of especial sanctity. The myth of the w ar between the Gods and Titans seems to the writer to supply that proof to account for the mythological o rigin of the story of Atlantis which Smith demanded.

Mathematical, and above all chronological matter, a s touched upon by the writers of antiquity, frequentl y present errors, and these we are able to rectify in dealing with two well known erroneous computations.

An octonal system may wel l have been employed in early Europe, just as a syste m equally dissimilar to the decimal was employed in a ncient America, but that it has any possible bearing on Pl ato's chronology, I fail to see. More seemingly reasonabl e is M. Butavand's statement that Eudoxus of Cnidus, who had studied astronomy in Egypt, and was well qualif ied to check the account of the priest of Sais, declare d that the duration of time indicated by Critias was not n ine thousand years, but as many months. This would brin g the date of the founding of Atlantis to about 1,400 years before our era, or about the date of the XIX Dynast y in Egypt.

In any part of this area unrecorded submarine catac lysms may be taking place at any time. M. Termier believes that a North Atlantic continent formerly existed, comprising Russia, Scandinavia, G reat Britain, Greenland and Canada, to which was added l ater a southern band made up of a large part of Central and Western Europe and an immense portion of the United States. \"There was also,\" he says, \"a South Atlanti c or African-Brazilian continent, extending northward to the southern border of the Atlas, eastward to the P ersian Gulf and Mozambique Channel, westward to the easter n border of the Andes and to the sierras of Colombia and Venezuela. Between the two continents passed the Mediterranean depression, that ancient maritime fur row which has formed an escarp about the earth since th e beginning of geologic time, and which we see so dee ply marked in the present Mediterranean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Sunda or Flores Sea.

These move- ments of depression probably occurred at several mo re or less distantly removed periods. In the Europe of th e Tertiary era the movement was developing which gave rise to the Alpine mountain chain. How far did this chain extend into the Atlantic region? Did some fra g- ments of it rise high enough to lift themselves for some centuries above the waters? This question M. Termie r answers in the affirmative. He believes that the geology of the whole Atlantic region has singularly altered in the course of the later periods of the earth's history. During the Secondar y period there were numerous depressions, the Tertiar y Period saw the annihilation of the continental area s, and subsequently there appeared a new design, the gener al direction of which was not east and west as formerl y, but north and south.

If there is any truth in Plato's thrilling account, we must look for Atlantis off the western coast of Africa, and here we find that five of the Cape Verde Islands and thr ee of the Canaries have rocks that are unmistakably li ke those common to the continents.

This great continent, he believes, began to subside before the Miocene. But he holds that its northern portion s per- sisted until the Azores and Madeira became isolated from Europe. \"I believe,\" he says, \"that they were still con- nected in early Pleistocene (Ice Age) times with th e conti- nents of Europe and Africa, at a time when man had already 1 In The Geographical Review, Vol. 3, 1917, p. 65."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Geography of Atlantis 5 7 made his appearance in Western Europe, and was able to reach the islands by land.\" 1 Among those modern geologists who uphold the Atlantean theory is Professor Edward Hull, whose in vesti- gations have led him to conclude that the Azores ar e the peaks of a submerged continent which flourished in the Pleistocene period. \"The flora and fauna of the two hemispheres,\" says Professor Hull, \"support the geo - logical theory that there was a common centre in th e Atlantic, where life began, and that during and pri or to the glacial epoch great land-bridges north and sout h spanned the Atlantic Ocean.\" He adds: \"I have made this deduction by a careful study of the soundings as recorded on the Admiralty charts.\" Dr. Hull also ho lds the view that at the time this Atlantic continent e xisted there was also a great Antillean continent or ridge shutting off the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico from w hat is called the Gulf Stream. 2 These considerations would appear to sustain the contention of modern geologists that the bed of the Atlantic has undergone constant change, and that, i ndeed, it may have risen and sunk many times since the per iod of the last Ice Age, as Sir William Dawson once sta ted.

It is of no avail to demonstrate i ts presence in the Miocene, Pliocene, or Pleistocene e poch, or, indeed, at any time prior to the development of a well organised civilisation among men, or, as Plato appar- ently reasons, between 11,000 and 12,000 years ago. Also what is wanted is evidence of the great island Atla ntis, not of the former seaward extension of some existin g continent, nor of any land-bridge spanning the ocea n. It is true that such conditions might serve as dist ant pre- liminaries for the production of Atlantis Island by the breaking down and submergence of the intervening la nd, but this only multiplies the cataclysms to be demon - strated and can have no real relevance in the absen ce of proof of the island itself.

As regards the portion o f Mr. Babcock's statement which relates to the condition of \"human society on a large scale\" to be found in Atl antis, I have never subscribed to this notion, but have, i n my former works, indicated that I believed such human society as Atlantis boasted to be of a comparativel y primi- tive character. 1 The protagonist of the Atlantis theory need not rely solely upon the evidence of Plato, as Mr. Babcock appears to think. To do so would unduly and unnecessarily limit the sphere of both proof and in quiry. The soundings taken in the Atlantic by various Admiralty authorities have revealed the existence o f a great bank or elevation commencing near the coast o f Ireland, traversed by the fifty-third parallel, and extending in a southerly direction embracing the Azores, to t he neighbourhood of French Guiana and the mouths of th e Amazon and Para Rivers.

Thes e birds usually live on mice, rats, and young rabbits , and this implies the existence of such mammals on the island s. It appears to be substantiated that the existence of t he Azores had already been known to earlier navigators, for i n a book published in 1345 by a Spanish friar the Azore s are referred to, and the names of the several islands g iven. On an atlas published at Venice in 1385 some of the islands are mentioned by name, as Capraria, or Isle of Goat s, now San Miguel; Columbia, or Isle of Doves, now Pic o; Li Congi, Rabbit Island, now Flores; and Corvi Mari ni, or Isle of Sea Crows, now Corvo. This nomenclature given prior to the discovery—the \"official\" discove ry of the islands, that is—seems to justify the assumptio n that mammals such as the wild goat and the rabbit flouri shed there at that period, and had reached the islands f rom Europe by a land-connection at a remoter era.

These are, of course, gross e xag- gerations arising out of the persistent traditions of cen- turies. The Sargasso is, indeed, shunned by vessels for more reasons than one. But it is safe to say that n o modern ocean-going liner could possibly become entr apped in its luxuriant masses of vegetation, did it seek to traverse them. But, as we have seen, good evidence exists th at in more remote days vessels found much difficulty i n navigating the Sargasso, if they were not caught wi thin its toils. The Sargasso Sea occupies an area of at least 3,000 ,000 square miles, embracing a tract extending from the 30th parallel of longitude to the Antilles, and from the 40th to the 20th parallel of latitude.

The Arcturus expedition, under the direction of Dr. Beebe, of the New York Zoological Society, which is presently investigating these mysterious stretches of weed- encumbered ocean, some time ago dispatched a wirele ss message to the New York newspapers respecting the discovery of glass, volcanic rock and sponge deposi ts from the bed of the Sargasso. The chief purpose of the expedition is to determine whether the weed of whic h the Sargasso is composed is blown out from the land , on propagates itself, and to examine and photograph the strange forms of life which inhabit it. What is certain is that the Sargasso Sea is the abo de of myriads of marine creatures—fishes, crustaceans, mo lluscs, from the probably gigantic to the infinitely small. It is the feeding-place of many species of birds.

In this central part the flow of th e surface waters is not steady in any direction, and hence the floating seaweed tends to accumulate there. Thi s accumulation is perhaps most observable in the tria ngular region marked out by the Azores, the Canaries and t he Cape Verde Islands, but much seaweed is also found to the westward of the middle part of this region in a n elongated area extending to the 70th meridian. The abundance of seaweed in the Sargasso Sea fluctuates much with the variation of the agencies which accou nt for its presence, but this office does not possess any authentic records to show that it has ever material ly impeded vessels.\" It is obvious that this statement is influenced by present- day conditions. If the gigantic rope-like masses of the Sargasso weed could scarcely impede the progress of modern steamers equipped with powerful screws, they may well have hampered the galley oars on which anc ient and mediaeval navigators had perforce to rely in ti me of calm.

In these days, when ocean lanes and sea-ways are so narrowly laid down for steamships, and when the captains of sailing ve ssels have learned what areas of sea it is best to avoid, formal reports of impediment are scarcely to be expected. But there is assuredly some basis for the age-long evil repute of the Sargasso Sea.

Vessels cannot pass there because of th e sands which extend over the buried isle.\" \"It must be evident,\" says Mr. W. H.

To the eye, at a little distance, it seems substantial enough to walk upon. Patches of the weed are always to be see n floating along the edge of the Gulf Stream.

Weed of the same species as is found in the Sargasso occurs in the Pacific Ocean w est of California, where it is known land formerly existed .

Not only does the coincidence of areas between the Sargasso and the traditional site of Atlantis assist such a hypothesis, the antiquity of the classi- cal allusions to the Sargasso accumulation and the obviously wider area it occupied in ancient times appear to s trengthen it. We have here, of course, to consider the site of At lantis only during that phase of its existence when it was occu- pied by human life. Practically all geologists are agreed, as we know, that in Miocene or late Tertiary times it still retained its continental character, occupying the w hole or major part of the North Atlantic region, but many b elieve that it disappeared during that era.

The island, says Plato, (1) was situated in front o f the Pillars of Hercules, otherwise the Straits of Gibra ltar; (2) It was greater than Libya (the Greek name for M edit- erranean Africa) and Asia (Asia Minor only in Plato 's time) combined.

Supposing it to have lain, as Plato says, directly in front of, and at no great distance from , the Hispano-African coasts (as the fact that part of it was called \"Gadiric,\" implies) then we must think of a land- mass which extended westward at least to the 45th parallel of longitude, and from north to south, nea rly from the 45th parallel of latitude to about the 22nd par allel of latitude, as shown on the accompanying map. This ar ea embraces not only the Azores and the Canary Islands , but much of the Sargasso Sea as well, though not its th ickest part, and lies directly above the great banks surro unding the Azores and the Canaries. If we regard the Canar ies as its south-eastern extremity (and it could not ha ve come much farther in this direction without touching the African coast), and the Azores as the northern limi t of the Atlantean land-mass proper at the period in que stion, and prolong it westward towards the 45th parallel o f longi- tude, we have not only an area commensurate with th at mentioned by Plato, but with those natural features which strikingly demonstrate its former presence. It seem s probable, too, that the original area of Atlantis m ay have coincided with that of the whole area of the Sargas so Sea. This, of course, refers, as I have said, to the \"la st phase \" of Atlantis, from 23,000 B.C. to about 9600 B.C., w hen it became finally submerged, according to Plato.

Gattefosse's conjectural map of Atlantis in Tertiar y times. If the island-continent lay \"before the mouth of th e strait,\" as Plato says, and the quicksands left by its subme rgence hindered navigation at the very mouth of the strait , as Aristotle and Scylax of Caryanda assert, the island which caused the debris must logically have been in close proximity to the Straits of Gibraltar. The conjectural map of Bory de St. Vincent, which w as compiled not only from Plato's account, but from th at of Diodorus Siculus, appears more in consonance with t he facts as given by these authors, but I think it sho uld cer- tainly have shown Atlantis as extending farther nor thward, so as to face the straits of Gibraltar, and come mo re \"under Mount Atlas,\" as Diodorus states it did.

Did it not do so becaus e the traditions of Atlantis, the island-continent which had once occupied a considerable portion of it, survived int o historic times? Atlantis is the genitive or possessive form of Atlas, meaning \"of Atlas,\" and \"Atlantic\" is merely the adjective thereof. The handiest dictionary renders it as \"pertaining to Atlas.\" Skeat derives it as \"named a fter Mount Atlas . . . from crude form Atlanti.\" The nam e Atlas means \"the sustainer, or bearer,\" from the Sa nskrit root Tal, \"to bear.\" But—there is always a \"but\" in these matters—it seems extraordinary that the islan d of Atalanta, near Euboea, the largest island of the AE gean Sea, had a history somewhat resembling that of Atlantis. Strabo in his First Book (3. 20.) says: \"And they s ay, also, of the Atalanta near Eubcea, that its middle portions, because they had been rent asunder, got a ship-cana l through the rent, and that some of the plains were over- flowed even as far as twenty stadia, and that a tri reme was lifted out of the docks and cast over the wall.\" Di odorus Siculus says that Atalanta was once a peninsula, an d that it was broken away from the mainland by an earthqua ke.

But at what date was it first so called ? Homer alludes to it as \"Oceanus.\" Plato himself calls it \"Atlantic,\" as if it were a name w ith which he was well acquainted. We may then conclude that the island-continent of Atlantis at the time of its submergence extended fr om a point close to the entrance to the Mediterranean to the 45th parallel of longitude, and from north to south , nearly from the 45th parallel of latitude to about the 22n d parallel of latitude."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" B ORY DE S T .

The Azilian race derives its name from a cave or tu nnel, known as Le Mas d'Azil, in the Pyrenean department of Ariege, where its deposits were discovered by Edoua rd Piette. 1 He found its remains deposited in nine strata on both banks of the river Arise, which flows through the Mas d'Azil tunnel, and its characteristics, as illu strated by the debris collected, are as follows: The people whose remains he discovered on this site must have been m arkedly vegetarian and fruitarian, for Piette discovered th e stones or husks of oak-acorns, haws, sloes, hazel-nuts, ch estnuts, cherries, prunes and walnuts. He also found a handf ul of barley-seeds, suggesting that they cultivated th at cereal. Harpoons were a feature of the Azilian culture, and this seems to indicate that their users were a peop le of maritime habits. These weapons were made of stag's horn, and were flat in shape. Over a thousand of th ese harpoons were found at Mas d'Azil. Along with them were found many necklaces of sea-shells, such as we re then to be gathered on the French shores of the Med iter- ranean and Atlantic, and this would also seem to po int to a maritime association in the case of this people. 1 See his paper Hiatus et lacune; Bulletin de la Soc iete d' Anthro- pologie de Paris, Series IV, Vol. VI, p. 235."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The Races of Atlantis 77 But the most amazing detail which the Azilian art displayed was a large collection of pebbles having certain marks in red painted upon them with peroxide of iro n, mingled with some resinous substance.

The first assumption of their finder was that these characters were alphabetic, and the suggestion was made that they were the debris of a Palaeolithic school. Other authorities believed them to be pieces used in a ga me of skill. They seemed, too, to bear a close resemblanc e to the churingas of the Australian aborigines, magical or sacred slabs engraved with fetishtic or totemic sym bols. But whereas the Australian churingas were invariabl y preserved in sacred caverns, the Azilian pebbles ap pear to have been objects of general use. The Abbe Breui l and Senor Obermeier, the well-known Spanish archaeo lo- gist, have, however, made it clear by a comparative study that the characters represented on the pebbles bear a close resemblance to those painted on the walls of certain caves in Spain.

Another feature of the Azilian culture are the obje cts usually described as pygmy or \"Tardenoisian\" flints , which take their name from Fere-en-Tardenois in the department of the Aisne, in France. These are small splinters of flint, usually less than an inch in le ngth, resembling arrowheads.

The Azilian people w ere undoubtedly the forerunners of the Neolithic race, the people of the New Stone Age, and brought with them to Europe an entirely new mode of living, a new art , new religious beliefs. They invaded Europe at a period which, broadly speaking, can be successfully collated with the date given by Plato. They must have poured into Eur ope in their thousands, dispossessing the older Aurigna cian or Cro-Magnon inhabitants and destroying their rela tively high culture.

Their art presupposes the associati on of the people not so much in small tribal groups of fa milies subsisting on the chase, as in fairly large communi ties of village life. They had their cave-temples and th eir trades, their rulers and social grades. Says Osborn: \"There can be little doubt that such diversities of temperament, of talent, and of predi sposition as obtain to-day also obtained then, and that they tended to differentiate society into chieftains, priests, and medicine- men, hunters of large game and fishermen, fashioner s of flints and dressers of hides, makers of clothing an d foot- wear, makers of ornaments, engravers, sculptors in wood, bone, ivory, and stone, and artists with colour and brush. In their artistic work at least these people were a nimated with a compelling sense of truth, and we cannot den y them a strong appreciation of beauty.\" 1 Such a people could not have dwelt in small and negligible forest or mountain tribes, but must have grouped themselves i nto communities of considerable size.

Perhaps the most salient among t hese is a species of flint knife, of which one edge is t rimmed away by chipping, the opposite edge being left untr immed, to allow it to remain straight and sharp. A scraper for the purpose of preparing skins, and an engraver, wi th an edge at right angles to the plane of the blade, for working bone, horn and ivory into implements, and sometimes furnished with a beak or cutting-point at the end o f the blade, must also have been the primitive chisel wit h which the Aurignacian sculptor put the finer touches to h is images. It is a significant fact that while the rac es which preceded him used stone or wood, Aurignacian man us ed bone. He was, indeed, a worker in bone par excellen ce, and this prepares us for the belief that on Atlanti s there probably existed large deposits of mammoth ivory.

Flints were now manufactured en masse, so that it would seem that the Atlanteans had arriv ed at the stage of mass production of artifacts, a con dition which implies not only a great social advance, but shows that labour on Atlantis was in process of becoming departmentalized. The enormous strata of horse-bone s found in some Solutrean deposits shows clearly that this people were eaters of horse-flesh, and as a race do es not as a rule suddenly take to a diet to which it has prim arily been unaccustomed, we may well believe that wild ho rses inhabited Atlantis in large numbers, galloping abou t its prairies or tundras in great herds. We also encounter numerous hearth-burials in this stage, from which we are justified in assuming that the dead were interred in the huts they had occupied du ring life. This implies that the people had begun to liv e in small stone houses, and that the caves were now uti lised chiefly for religious purposes, or as temples. But the most striking innovation is the appearance of a much hig her type of flint tool than had before been in use. The implements of this period, indeed, display a beauty of line and flaking unsurpassed. They are commonly described as \"willow-leaf\" and \"laurel-leaf\" patter ns, and consist of javelin or spear-heads, scrapers and borers. Thus a new art in stone had arisen in the course of centuries in Atlantis. Bone-working had to a great extent been abandoned. This may mean that the deposits of mammoth ivory had begun to give out, and that the r ace, forced back on the use of flint, had addressed itse lf to the perfection of a flint technique. We are compell ed to some such conclusion, because in Europe there wa s no lack of bone, had the Solutrean workers cared to em ploy it. \"The Solutreans,\" says Macalister, who believes in an"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"92 The History of Atlantis African origin for the Cro-Magnon race, \" moved wes tward, and submerged the Aurignacians temporarily, driving them, perhaps, into Italy; where they were preserve d, to reappear, after the Solutrean tyranny was overpast, as the Magdalenians. The Magdalenians seem essentially to have been similar in race to the Aurignacians, but to ha ve lost the tall stature and the excessive cranial capacity—per haps as a result of the deterioration of climate, and it se ems possible to affiliate the Magdalenian culture to the Aurigna cian.\" With the return of glacial conditions in the Magdal enian stage, we must suppose similar conditions in Atlant is. It is not necessary to assume with Macalister that the Magdalenians were Aurignacians who had long been segregated in Italy. Indeed he remarks elsewhere th at no Magdalenian remains are to be encountered there, an d it seems much more probable that they represent sti ll another wave of Atlantean immigrants, whose customs had been changed by climatic conditions which were then growing more rigorous on the island-continent as in Europe. One of the outstanding weapons of this peri od is the harpoon, made from reindeer-horn or bone and used for spearing seals or fish. Another is the bat on de commandement, a section of reindeer-horn pierced by a hole, or holes. These were certainly not sceptres, as the ir rashly assumed name might seem to imply, but have b een likened to the rods used by Laplanders which they t ie to the reins of the reindeer, to horse-bits, to shaft-stra ighteners, and to instruments of sorcery.

But above and beyond all, we must regard Atlantis a s the home of sculpture and painting. The art of Aurignacian man in Europe, suddenly appearing as if full- blown, leaves no doubt that it must have been perfe cted in another sphere and after centuries of effort. We must, indeed, assume the rise in Atlantis of a school of art immeasurably superior in its technique to that of E gypt, freer, if not nobler, more realistic, more inspired , more human in every way.

Twenty thousand or more years ago Atlant is must have been the scene of mighty artistic impulse s of a kind equal to any which have been manifested in the history of mankind, and this presupposes the existence of a former great civilisation on the island, of which, perhaps , the art of the Aurignacians was merely the last degenerate phase.

The civilisation of the \" Aurignacians \" perished a t last, and was totally forgotten and buried in the soil for te n thousand years. Its rediscovery was merely a happy accide nt. Such considerations reawaken the old controversy regarding the existence of a civilisation prior to those of Egypt and Babylonia, not a merely barbaric precurso r of them, but an ancient culture of superior status, fr om which they derived. The elder world was full of myt hs and memories of such a civilisation. The tales of t he Antediluvians, of Cyclopean builders, of giant fore runners, the thousand hints and intimations of an older race , embedded not only in Hebrew Biblical literature, bu t in the chronicles of practically all civilised peoples in Europe, Asia and America, universally point to a fixed beli ef in the prior existence of a culture of undoubted antiquity and excellence.

The relationship between the African and Iberian Azilians is evidently linked up by the Capsian, an African civilisation, which seems to ha ve inherited or absorbed Azilian traits, and there is, indeed, no pure Azilian culture of that period visible in A frica.

We recall that Plato alludes to the admixture of the divine Atlantean race, the origina l lineage of the gods, with the sons of earth, with ordinary mortals. Who were those \"mortals,\" who impoverished the divi ne strain?

We say \"the final catas trophe,\" but we have absolutely no evidence to permit us to state with any exactitude precisely when Atlantis was fin ally submerged. Indeed she was never totally submerged, for the Canary Islands and the Azores, her highest peaks, still remain above water as witnesses of her former existence.

The idea probably arose from the belief that Mount Atlas, in Africa, like other lofty mount ains, actually upheld the skies.

So far Plato. Diodorus tells us that Uranus was the first King of the Atlanteans. Uranus was the Greek god of the Sky, and father of Iapetus the Titan, the Bibli cal Japhet, of Oceanus, the Cyclopes, and many other my thical figures, including the Giants.

The story of the Ti tano- machia, or divine war with the Titans, relates that Uranus, the first ruler of the world, cast his sons, Briare us, Cottys and Gyes, the Hecatoncheires, or Hundred-handed, in to Tartarus, along with the Cyclopes, \"the creatures w ith round or circular eyes,\" gigantic shepherds of Sici ly. Gaea, his wife, indignant at this, urged the Titans to rise against their father. They deposed him, and raised Cronus to the throne. But Cronus, in turn, hurled t he Cyclopes back into Tartarus, and married his sister Rhea. Uranus and Gasa had foretold that he would himself be deposed by his own children, and as these were born he swallowed them, all but Zeus, whom his mother conce aled in a cave in Crete. When Zeus came to manhood he ga ve his father a potion which caused him to disgorge th e chil- dren he had swallowed, and these turned against Cro nus and the ruling Titans.

The histories of all peoples commence with a dynast y of god-kings, only shading later into \"real\" histor y as time proceeds.

That they ruled over Atlantis in its Stone Age peri od is as unlikely as that Lear or Arthur represent the Neoli thic Age in Britian. They are called \"the first Kings\" o f Atlantis, and no very extraordinary antiquity is cl aimed for them prior to the cataclysm. Everything points to the probability that, just as Atlan- tis experienced several cataclysmic visitations, so did she experience more than one revolution of cultural and politi- cal change.

We must, in the first place, imagine Atlantis, an i sland nearly the size of Australia, as the seat of a grea t pre- historic civilisation of very considerable pretensi ons. A race of fine physique—such physique, indeed, as the world has not since beheld—inhabits it. By the aid of flint tools, as well as native genius, it has succe eded under the happy conditions of an environment unhampered b y the Pleistocene ice, in developing an admittedly hi gher type of artistic effort at a period about 23,000 ye ars or more before the Christian era.

He rears a progeny of twins, who subsequently rule the island and the surrounding isles, found a special caste and also a religious system of their own, based on ancestor-wo rship.

How long Atlas reign ed we have no means of knowing, but it was probably du ring his tenure of the throne that the city of Atlantis was founded. It could scarcely have been a place of much conside ration in the reign of Poseidon the first king, and it see ms much more probable that the temple which contained his i mage and that of Cleito, his wife, was erected subsequen t to his death.

The fact remains that extensi ve works of the Azilian period have been discovered at Huelva in south-western Spain by Mrs. Elena Whishaw , of the Anglo-Spanish School of Archaeology there. M rs. Whishaw has succeeded in bringing to light numerous evidences of that Tartessian civilization which nou rished in the South of Spain in pre-Roman and even in pre- Carthaginian times. After many discouragements she succeeded in founding the Anglo-Spanish School of Archaeology in 1914, first at Seville and later at Niebla, under the patronage of King Alfonso. The museum which she has erected outside the little walled tow n is a model of its kind, and is filled with the result of her excavations in all their stages from Palaeolithic t o Arabic times. The great majority of the Stone Age objects housed in the Museum have been classed in accordance with the views of modern authorities as belonging to the Pal aeo- lithic or Old Stone Age.

The exhibits also include many Neolithic objects and numerous fragments of pottery, exquisitely polished, some bearing designs in relief. Funeral tiles of pottery have also been enc ountered near Seville in connection with remains which have been classified as Cro-Magnon, so that the manufacture o f earthenware objects by Palaeolithic man in this reg ion may at least be suspected.

At Niebla soundings have been taken to the depths of t hirty feet of soil rich in Palaeolithic remains without a ny sign of coming to the end of the deposit. These remains vary from miniature darts of quartz, some less than half an inch long, beautifully chipped porphyry fish-hooks and small arrow-heads, and many other minute objects of the type usually classified as Azilian, the precise use of which remains to be decided. Enormous grain-crushers, too , have been excavated, made from what is known locall y as black quartz. None of these objects could have been carried down to Niebla by the river.

Later foundations have also been unearthed which ha ve been referred to the Bronze Age. These are situated out- side the walls of Niebla, facing the river on the s outh side, and occupying a space of about 100 feet in length. They are composed of what is locally known as hormazo, a primitive and coarser variety of the later concrete , known as hormigon, peculiar to Andalusia. The employment of one or other of these materials affords a criterion by which the approximate period of building-constructi on in this region can be arrived at, and this determines the early character of a Cyclopean wall of rough-hewn stones of enormous size built along the banks of the Rio Tint o to the east of the town, and held together by hormazo mortar. This structure was revealed in 1923 by the agency o f a series of floods. The river has been artificially d eepened all along the wall to form a harbour, and if proof were required that such was the design of the primitive builders, it is found in a stairway over thirty feet wide cut in the rock which leads down to the river from one of the five great gate-towers of the town.

Indeed, Mrs. Whish aw, an archaeologist of ripe experience, herself attrib utes the works in question to Atlantean immigrants, and is p res- ently preparing an extended essay on the subject, w hich she is to entitle Atlantis in Andalusia. There is thus no reason why we should not speak of \"palaces\" and \"observatories\" in the Atlantis of th e time of Atlas. Probably the latter resembled the inti-hu atana of Peru, Incan and pre-Incan, and there seems to be nothing wildly improbable in envisaging the sage At las seated in such a building, occupied with the study of the heavenly bodies. We may infer, from the circumstance that Atlas was engaged in the researches of astronomy, that his re ign was a peaceful one. In all probability it was of consid erable duration, and witnessed the growth and consolidatio n of the Atlantean power. Didorus tells us that Jupiter was a king of the Atl an- teans, and as he is careful to assure us that this personage was not the same as the god of that name, we must i nfer that he was a man named after that god. But there s eems to be some dubiety concerning whether Saturnus, the brother of Atlas, or Jupiter, his son, came first t o the throne. \"This Jupiter,\" says Diodorus, \"either suc- ceeded to his father Saturnus, as King of the Atlan tides, or displaced him.\" It would thus seem either that Saturn reigned first and left the succession to his son in the usual manner, or that Jupiter hurled him from t he throne. The latter appears to be the more probable sur- mise, as Diodorus tells us that: \"Saturn, it is sai d, made war upon his son, with the aid of the Titans, but J upiter overcame him in a battle, and conquered the whole w orld.\" \"Saturn,\" he also remarks, \"was profane and covetou s.\" We may thus assume that an irreligious and grasping old"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"118 The History of Atlantis king or chieftain, whose avarice and profanity had be- come a menace to the body politic, was displaced by a more pious and considerate son.

We may, then, regard Jupiter as the third King of Atlantis, or at least the third of whom we have any definite knowledge. It was in his reign that those elements of un- rest which were to play so disastrous a part in Atl antean history began to manifest themselves. But it may be , and indeed it seems much more likely, that the four out standing figures in Atlantean history, Poseidon, Atlas, Satu rn and Jupiter, represent the founders of four separate dy nasties as well as individual reigns. Indeed this may be gl eaned from Plato's account, which tells us that, \"for man y centu- ries they did not lose sight of their august origin , they obeyed all the laws, and were religious adorers of the gods their ancestors.\" Four reigns could not cover such a length of time, and we are driven to the conclusion that the personages named were the first monarchs of new dynastic lines. This is all the more probable becau se they have the names of \"Classical\" gods, bestowed u pon them by Plato's informant in default of being able to supply their Atlantean or Egyptian names in a form underst and- able to Greek hearers. The founders of new dynastie s nearly always go down in history as beings of divin e or semi-divine birth.

It would also seem to have been customary in Atlantis to deify kings after their de aths, precisely as it was in Egypt and Rome, and not infr equently among the tribes of ancient Britain and the North-A meri- can Indians. This, of course, at once accounts for their being regarded as gods by subsequent generations. T hey were, in fact, \"gods,\" precisely in the sense that Numa Pompilius or Marcus Aurelius were considered as \"go ds\" after their death. With what we may then believe to be the dynasty of Jupiter, a revolutionary spirit seems to have manif ested itself in the body politic of Atlantis. \"In the cou rse of time,\" says Plato, \"the vicissitudes of human affai rs cor- rupted little by little their divine institutions, and they began to comport themselves like the rest of the ch ildren of men. They hearkened to the promptings of ambitio n, and sought to rule by violence.

I also believe that he could have told us mu ch more about Atlantis had he survived to elaborate hi s account of it. The passage in question applies, in my view, not to the events which prefaced the final ca tas- trophe, but to that part of Atlantean history in wh ich the spirit of revolution first reared its head.

But the Atlanteans, formerly pacific and law-abidin g, had now become inoculated with the fever of party s trife. Bad feeling must have been maintained between the opposing factions, even after peace had been nomina lly secured, and its results were probably to be witnes sed in a general state of political unrest and popular dis organisa- tion. It was evidently at this stage that Zeus—thro ugh the mouthpiece of his priesthood, of course—issued a ge neral warning to the contending parties. They were probab ly told by the hierophants that a council of the gods had been convoked by the Allfather, at which their conduct h ad been condemned. After that all is darkness, so far as Plato is concerned. But there is little doubt that his account would have narrated the terms of the god's strictures and warnings, and have proceeded to acqu aint us with its results, which, I believe, would have i nformed us of the manner in which revolution at home was pu t an end to by the politic resolve of the governing bodi es, royal and spiritual, to divert the public attention to co nquest abroad—a policy which ended in the great invasion o f Europe recorded by Plato in his Timaeus, and by arc haeology as the invasion of the Azilians.

The tradition al material in the ancient books of Wales which deals with the subject of lands submerged by cataclysm is of s uch extent that to contain it in its entirety an entire volume would be necessary. Before attempting a justificati on of the theory that the flood-legends of Wales relat e to the Atlantean catastrophe, we may, perhaps, examine a f ew of the better known of these. In the book of Caradoc, of Nantgarvan, which dates from the twelfth century, and the book of Jevan Bre chva, Thomas Jones of Tregarn, in 1601, found certain of the verses known as the Triads of the Isle of Britain. These were printed by the Rev. Edward Davies in his Celti c Researches (London 1804). Under the caption of \"The Three Awful Events of the Isle of Britain,\" we read that these consisted of: \"First, the bursting of the lake of waters, and the overwhelming of the face of all lands, so that all mankind were drowned, excepting Dwyvan and Dwyvach, who escaped in a naked vessel (without sails) and from them the Island of Britain was re-peopled. \"The second was the consternation of the tempestuou s fire, when the Earth split asunder, to Annwn (the l ower region) and the greatest part of all living was con sumed. 122"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Atlantis in Britain 123 \"The third was the scorching summer, when the woods and plants were set on fire by the intense heat of the Sun, and multitudes of men and beasts and kinds of birds, and reptiles, and trees, and plants were irrecovera bly lost.\" The deluge alluded to in the first triad was the bu rsting of the Lake of Llyn Llion. Practically the same sto ry is recounted of Llyn Tegid, near Bala, in Merioneth shire, and, as the late Sir John Rhys remarked, \"probably all the other lakes of Wales were supposed to have had inhabitants wealthy in herds of cattle, and in our time each mere is supposed to have been formed by the su b- sidence of a city, whose bells may even now be at t imes heard merrily pealing.\" That the memory of a submerged land should be so universal in Wales surely indicates a tradition mos t ancient and deep-seated. \"The Druids,\" says Davies 1 \" represent the deluge under the figure of a lake, called Llyn Llion, the waters of which burst forth and overwhelmed the face of the whole earth. Hence they regarded a lake as the just symbol of the deluge. But the deluge it self was viewed, not merely as an instrument of punishme nt to destroy the wicked inhabitants of the globe, but also as a divine lustration, which washed away the bane of corruption and purified the earth for the reception of the just ones, or of the deified patriarch and his fami ly. Con- sequently, it was deemed peculiarly sacred, and com - municated its distinguishing character to those lak es and bays by which it was locally represented.\" The Lake of Llion, then, in the minds of the Welsh of the twelfth century, stood for a mythic symbol o f deluge and catastrophe by water. Of a somewhat diff erent class is the tradition of the Cantref of Gwaelod, o r the \"Submerged Hundred,\" which recounts how the Plain 1 Mythology of the British Druids, p. 142."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"124 The History of Atlantis of Gwyddneu was drowned. \"This,\" says Professor Lloyd, 1 \"first makes its appearance in a poem in the Black Book of Carmarthen (53b, 54a), written in the last part of the book, and, therefore, about 1200. This poem has often been translated; there is, for instance, an English version in Meyrick's 'History of Cardiganshire' (2) , 153, and a modern Welsh one in Cymru Eu (p. 6). The best is, however, the most recent, that of Sir J. Rhys i n the 'Cymmrodorion Transactions' for 1892-3 (pp. 14-16), from which it appears that the Plain of Gwyddneu wa s overwhelmed by the sea by reason of the wickedness of its inhabitants, who had given themselves up to eat ing and drinking and insolent pride of heart. The perso n who let loose this judgment upon the land was a mai den, perhaps called Margaret ('Mererid'), who at a time of feasting suffered the waters of a magical well whic h was under her charge to escape and overflow the country round. . . . Such was the primitive story; it is su pple- mented in one point by the compiler of the earliest form of the Pedigrees of the Saints (also dating from ab out 1200), who speaks of five 'Saints' as sons of King Seithen nin of the Plain of Gwyddno, whose realm was swallowed up by the sea. For the germ of the modern legend, whic h is in many ways a very different one, we have to lo ok to the third series of Triads, belonging to the sixtee nth century; the third of the Three Arrant Drunkards of Britain (a festive group unknown to the older triad ic literature) is there said to be Seithennin, the Dru nken, King of Dyfed, who, in his cups, let the sea loose over the Lowland Hundred, a region of fair cities and th e patrimony of Gwyddno Garanhir, King of Ceredigion.

But the famous embankment has still to be introduced into the story. It was to the antiquary Robert Vaughan of Hengwrt (1592-1667) that the idea first occurred of connecting the story of the Lowland Hun dred with the natural causeway near Harlecb called by th e peasantry, in that age as in this, 'Sarn Badrig' or St. Patrick's Causeway. The popular explanation, no dou bt, was that this was the saint's private road home to his beloved Ireland, but for Vaughan it is 'a great sto ne wall made as a fence against the sea,' which he has no d ifficulty in supposing to have once been a rampart of the bur ied realm. Lewis Morris, in the next century, took the same view, and, remembering the poem in the Black Book, added a suggestion of his own, 'that by drunkenness the flood-gates were left open' (Celtic Remains, p. 73; cf. p. 390). But one more touch was needed to give the narrative its modern form; the business of the floo d gates must be specially laid at the door of Seithen nin, who must play the part of the drunken lockman. This is done in Owen's Cambrian Biography (1803); under the patronage of so influential a student of Welsh anti quities, the story as thus rounded off won great popularity and furnished an attractive theme for literary treatmen t. Englishmen were made familiar with it by the fascin ating pages of The Misfortunes of Elphin ; for Welshmen i t was vigorously told in the verse of Hiraethog and Ieuan Glan Geirionydd.\" Davies quotes the record of the catastrophe as give n in the Triads: \"'Seithinin, the Drunkard, the son of S eithin Saidi, King of Dyved, in his liquor let in the sea, over Cantre'r Gwaelod, so as to destroy all the houses a nd lands of the place, where prior to that event, ther e had been sixteen cities, the best of all the towns and citie s of Wales, excepting Caerleon upon Usk.

A similar story is told of Lake Savadda in Brecknoc k- shire, which is retailed by Davies as follows: \"The site of the present lake was formerly occupied by a large city; but the inhabitants were reported to be very wicked. The king of the country sent his servant to examine into the truth of this rumour, adding a thr eat, that, in case it should prove to be well founded, h e would destroy the place as an example to his other subjec ts.

In this situation the stranger passed t he night; and whilst he was diverting the child he acc identally dropped his glove into the cradle. The next morning he departed before it was light, to carry his melancho ly tidings to the king. \"He had but just left the town when he heard a nois e behind him, like a tremendous crack of thunder mixe d with dismal shrieks and lamentations.

The whole plain was covered with a lake. Whilst he was gazing at this novel and terrific sce ne, he remarked a little spot in the middle of the water; the wind gently wafted it towards the bank where he sto od; as it drew near, he recognized the identical cradle in which he had left his glove.

The reader will recollect that, in Plato's account, the city of Atlantis was said to be divided into zones or ci rcles of land and water, and in a previously published work, The Problem of Atlantis, I brought a great deal of proo f to bear that the circular plan of Atlantis was copied in many subsequent city-sites. The passage which summed up these resemblances is as follows:— \"Starting then from a knowledge of the Atlantean de sign as described in Plato, we find that is reflected no t only in that of Carthage, but in numerous other ancient sites scattered over the length and breadth of those area s where we might expect to find architectural remains approximating to the Atlantean model—on the one han d along the entire stretch of the Mediterranean, and on the other along the sea-coasts of the Western Atlan tic to Britain and Ireland. It will not serve to regard them"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"130 The History of Atlantis as arising in historical succession from east to we st. The Iberians, the builders of these venerable monuments , did not originate in the eastern region of the Medi terranean, so that it is impossible to regard that sphere as t he starting-point of their architectural history.\" The fifth stanza of this weird lay also casts furth er light upon its Atlantean significance:— \"I will not redeem the multitudes with trailing shi elds. They knew not on what day the stroke would be given , nor what hour in the serene day Cwy (the agitated p erson) would be born, or who prevented his going into the dales of Devwy (the possession of the water). They know not the brindled ox with the thick head-band, havin g seven score knobs in his collar.\" This obviously refers to the populace of a country unconsciously awaiting the shock of catastrophe by deluge. As regards the allusion to the ox, \"in almo st every British memorial of the deluge\" writes Davies , \"the ox is introduced.\" The ox or bull was, it will be recalled, the sacred animal worshipped in Atlantis. The song quoted above evidently refers to the escap e from deluge of a company of persons under the leadership of the mythological Arthur. These were, it would seem, the leaders or aristocracy of the island alluded to, who had li ttle or no anxiety for the populace, and saved themselves by f light. The circular or quadrangular nature of the city they ab andoned is mentioned, and it is hinted that from it they ca rried with them the memory and apparatus of their sacred myste ries. But do we find in the ancient Welsh traditions any reminiscences more definite of the lost Atlantis, r eminis- cences which would justify us in saying that our Br itish forefathers associated the tradition of a submerged country with a region in the Atlantic ? These appear to be indicated in the legends relating to Arthur and Lyones or Lyo nesse, and the Isle of Avallon."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Atlantis in Britain 131 In the first place it is clear that the Lake Llion, whose legend we have already discussed, is nothing more o r less than a legend of oceanic submergence adapted to a W elsh locality—that indeed the traditions relating to Lak e Llion and Lyonesse have a common origin. Nor will it be difficult to prove that Lake Llion, Lyonesse, Avall on and Atlantis are merely names for one and the same ocea nic locality. Let us examine first the traditions associated with the Isle of Avallon. The site of Avallon was regarded b y the Celts of Britain as lying in the western ocean. The name has been explained as implying Insula Pomorum, or the Isle of Apples, although the spelling of the word with two \"lls\" rather seems to signify \"Isle of App le Trees.\" By Geoffrey of Monmouth it was equated with the dragon-guarded Isle of the Hesperides. 1 A similar account of it is given by an anonymous poet cited in Ian Morti's edition of Geoffrey (pp. 425-6) the verses being ascribed by Usher to the British bard Gildas. From internal evidence in these poems and from William o f Malmcsbury, it appears that the Insula Avallonia or Ynys Avallach signified the island belonging to a K ing Avallach, who resided there with his daughter. Tin' s Avallach is identified by the Harleian MS as the so n of Beli and Annu, and by Rhys with Evalach, the wounde d Fisher King of the Grail Legend. Atlantis, it is needless to say, has been again and again identified with the Island of the Hesperides which contained the sacred apples, so that the associatio n of Avallon with that insular paradise equates the Brit ish with the Platonic locality, and Avallon stands revealed as the Atlantis of Plato. If the equation be justified, we must then be prepared to find in Avallach, the King of t he island, 1 Vita Merlini.

Seeking for the moment for further associations bet ween the localities of Avallon and Atlantis, before we d eal with their respective rulers and inhabitants, we fi nd in the legend of the \"Revolving Castle\" entered by Per edur, an incident peculiarly Atlantcan. This is to be fou nd in the Welsh Seint Greal. 1 The passage runs thus:— \"And they rode through the wild forests, and from o ne forest to another until they arrived on clear groun d outside the forest. And then they beheld a castle coming wi thin their view on level ground in the middle of a meado w; and around the castle flowed a large river, and ins ide the castle they beheld large spacious halls with window s large and fair. They drew nearer towards the castle, and they perceived the castle turning with greater speed tha n the fastest wind they had ever known. And above on the castle they saw archers shooting so vigorously that no armour would protect against one of the discharges they made. Besides this, there were men there blowing in horns so vigorously, that one might think one felt the ground tremble. At the gates were lions, in iron ch ains, roaring and howling so violently that one might fan cy the forest and the castle uprooted by them.\" This Revolving Castle Rhys unhesitatingly equates w ith the Castle of the Grail, the abode of the Fisher Ki ng. We find this mysterious stronghold mentioned also in o ne of the poems of Taliesin, in which he says: \"Perfect is my chair in Caer Sidi: Plague and age hurt him not who's in it They know, Manawydan and Pryderi. Three organs round a fire sing before it, And about its points are ocean's streams, And the abundant well above it, Sweeter than white wine the drink in it.\" 1 Ed Williams, p. 325-6 (translation p. 649)."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Atlantis in Britain 133 The name \"Caer Sidi\" signifies \"revolving place,\" a nd is identified by Rhys with the \"Revolving Castle.\" We will recall that this Caer Sidi was alluded to as t he insular locality abandoned by Arthur and his companions on the occurrence of a deluge. This, therefore, identifies the Revolving Castle with an oceanic locality once over - whelmed by deluge. The circumstance of the legend seem to associate it with a locality prone to catac lysm, and on the whole we appear to have an indubitable memor y of the Atlantean site. It is situated \"on level ground in the middle of a plain or meadow,\" as was Atlantis, and, like it, is surrounded by a \"mighty ditch or fosse.\" The gro und trembles and the castle whirls as if in the throes of an earthquake. The lions which surround it typify the natural forces of destruction. It is, according to the poem, of an insular character. \"About it are ocean' s streams.\" \"The word used,\" says Rhys, \"is banneu or ban\" (meaning points) and this connects the place w ith the Benwyk of Arthurian romance, the island kingdom of King Ban. It also implies that it had four corners or angles, which seems to associate it with the \"Isle of the Four Precious Walls\" in the Irish saga of \"The Voya ge of Maeldune.\" These walls met in the centre, and co n- sisted respectively of gold, silver, copper and cry stal. This is Atlantis over again, the walls of which wer e con- structed of gold, silver and orichalcum or copper. Let us compare Plato's account with that in the Welsh Sein t Greal. (1) In the Welsh account Peredur rode through wild forests, \"from one forest to another.\" Plato says t hat the country surrounding Atlantis was deeply afforested. (2) The Revolving Castle is situated on level ground in the middle of a meadow. Atlantis was built \"on a le vel plain.\""},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"134 The History of Atlantis (3) Around the Revolving Castle \"flowed a large river.\" \"The plain,\" says Plato, \"was encompassed by a migh ty ditch or fosse, which received the mountain streams and the outflow of the canals.\" (4) Caer Sidi is \"The Revolving or Circular Place.\" Atlantis was also built in circular form. (5) \"I will not redeem the multitudes with trailing shields,\" says the singer in \"The Spoils of the Dee p\" of the people of Caer Sidi. The landowner in Atlantis, says Plato, \"was bound to furnish the sixth part of a wa r- chariot, so as to make up ten thousand chariots, tw o horses and riders upon them, a light chariot withou t a seat, and an attendant and charioteer, two heavily- armed infantrymen, two archers, two slingers, three stone - shooters, three javelin-men, and four sailors, to m ake up the complement of twelve hundred ships.\" (6) \"They\" (the multitudes, the plebeians) \"know not the brindled ox with the thick head-band.\" \"Near th e temple of Poseidon in Atlantis,\" says Plato, \"graze d the sacred bulls, and these the ten kings of the island periodic- ally offered up in sacrifice. . . . They put on azu re robes and judged offenders.\" They were, in short, an aris - tocracy of the cult of the bull or ox, unknown to t he multitude. Perhaps these comparisons render more clear the Atlantean origins of the Welsh legends of Caer Sidi and Avallon, and we may now proceed to examine still ot her British myths which deal with insular or submerged localities in the hope of finding further evidence. In Celtic folklore there stands out, almost pre-emi - nently, the figure of Morgan le Fay, the fata, fate or fairy associated with the sea. She is, says Rhys, the sam e as that Morgan who, in the Isle of Avallon, had the ch arge"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Atlantis in Britain 135 of healing Arthur of his wounds, and is the Lady of the Lake, the foster-mother of Launcelot, the imprisone r of Merlin. Morgan means \"the offspring of the sea,\" an d we may take it that she represents the ocean in its phase of the great abysm of forgetfulness or oblivion. Mo r is Welsh for \"the sea,\" and perhaps Morgan represents that sea which Pliny in his Natural History tells u s the dead had to pass to reach the realm of King Cronus, or T ime. The sea to the Celts was indeed the pathway to the Other- world, a notion which is to be encountered in many mythologies, and the Celtic Place of the Dead is in variably located in the Western Ocean. Thus it appears proba ble that the place to which all souls were supposed to depart after death was associated with a locality formerly inhabi- ted by the living, the Place of the Ancestors, the original home. Early man invariably believed that after deat h he would join his ancestors in an environment of un - terrestrial bliss, and elsewhere I have collected s o many myths and legends to show that this idea was connec ted in some cases with submerged localities that it sca rcely appears needful to traverse the ground once more. In the first place, let us enumerate these localiti es, other than those already mentioned, which the Celts of Britain believed to have been submerged. Some of th em were actually to be found in Wales itself. Thus Lly n Tegid, near Bala, in Merioneth, is of this class. I ndeed, Rhys has placed it on record that, \"in our time eac h mere is supposed to have been formed by the subsidence o f a city whose bells may even now be at times heard mer rily pealing.\" This proves at least that the idea of sub merged lands had taken a strong hold upon the imagination of the Celts of Britain. Wherefore? Myths of this class do not spring up \"naturally,\" but can be shown to have had a long traditional genealogy behind them, and in th e event to have originated in some historical fact."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"136 The History of Atlantis The overflowing of coastal tracts by the sea is als o an extension of this tradition of submergence. In some cases, of course, this may actually have occurred, but in others it appears to be nothing but a localisation of a mu ch more ancient tradition of submerged oceanic localities. The legend of the \"Bottom Hundred\" has already been cited. Akin to it is that of the sunken city of Abe rdovey, the bells of which can be heard ringing in Gwydno's realm. Says Rhys: \"The Euhemeristic account of the submersion of Gwydno's plain is that it occurred in conse- quence of the neglect of a certain Seithennyn, whos e business it was to take care of the embankments and their flood-gates; he, one day heavy with drink, forgot a ll about his charge, and the catastrophe took place. The old est account, however, is contained in a short poem in t he Black Book of Carmarthen; and it is by no means suc h a commonplace story: for the author of the poem knows nothing of Seithennyn's drunkenness, as he merely c har- acterises him as a person of weak intellect, while he lays the entire blame on a damsel whom he terms the Well Minister or Fountain Servant. What her duties exact ly were we are not told ; but she had probably the cha rge of a magic well, as in the corresponding Irish story of Lough Neagh ... in which the neglect to keep the lid on t he magic spring resulted in an inundation, a catastrop he foretold by the idiot of the family, who occupies t here the place of Seithennyn in the Welsh version. Now, the name of the woman who had charge of the well in the Iris h story was Liban, which is in Welsh Llion, and occurs in t he Welsh account of the deluge resulting from the burs ting of Llyn Llion, or Llion's Lake. Further, it is this lady's name probably in some one of its forms, or a deriva tive from it, that meets us in Malory's Liones,\" The gen ius of this country is a Dame Liones, the owner of a Ca stle Perilous hard by the Isle of Avallon. Rhys attaches her"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Atlantis in Britain 137 country to the West Coast of Cornwall, \"lying somew here under the sea between Lundy and the Isles of Scilly . . . . Without dwelling,\" he says, \"on the probable extrem e antiquity of the myths underlying these romances, o ne may venture to point out that we seem to have evide nce, dating from the early portion of the Roman occupati on of this country, to the equation of some such a her o as Tristram or Lancelot with the Heracles of classical mythology; witness the fact that Ptolemy calls Hart land Point, Herakleous Akron, or the Promontory of Herac les.\" The name Liones or Lyonesse, of course, equates wit h that of the mythical lake, Llyn Llion, which was su pposed to have overwhelmed the world in its bursting, and, as has already been mentioned, it can also be associat ed with the sunken Land of Ys, of Breton legend. But it als o seems to me to have an etymological as well as a tr aditional connection with Atlantis. Indeed, I believe the nam e Atlantis to be merely a Hellcnized version of the C eltic Llyn Llion or Lyonesse, just such, indeed, as the G reeks would give to a Celtic name. Take Llyn Llion, pro- nounced as most non-Celtic people would pronounce i t (Lin Lion) and join to it the Greek ending \"is,\" wi th the letter \"t\" added for the sake of euphony. One gets Lin- Lion-tis, Linliontis. It would seem then, that thro ugh some such association of the god Atlas with this We stern locality, and through the confusion and Hellenisati on of the name Llyn Llion, the name Atlantis may have ari sen. Or may not the names Llyn Llion and Atlantis procee d from a common root ? Atlas can readily enough be associated with the god s of Britain. He was of the Titan breed, and the brot her of Albion, who, like him, was a son of Poseidon. Al bion was the original tutelary god of Britain. Both Atla s and Albion contested the western passage of Heracles. According to Pomponius Mela, Albion with his brothe r"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"138 The History of Atlantis Iberius (the god of Ireland) the sons of Poseidon, challenged and fought the Greek demi-god near Aries. Albion is also that Alba, from which Scotland takes her name of Albany. There was thus a family or gens of Titans connected with the Western Ocean, and if Albion and Iberius can be associated with the British Isles, t o which, indeed, their names still powerfully adhere, it is only reasonable to assume that Atlas was also once the t utelary divinity of a Western land in the ocean with which myth persistently connects his name. Albion (Britain), I berius (Ireland), Atlas (Atlantis). The sequence is precis e, and it is hard to believe that if the two former na mes were attached to islands still extant that the third can be regarded as the deity of a locality which existed only in th e mythical imagination, especially as the personages alluded t o had the same progenitor, and all belonged to one and th e same gens. There is no example in mythical history of a clan of ancestral figures issuing from one epo nymous ancestor, some members of which were attached to ac tual, and the rest to mythical localities. Search the pag es of the Old Testament, the Rig-Veda, the Eddas—any body of traditional writings which supply ancestral genealogies—and nowhere in their pages can such an anomaly be encountered. Let us examine the Greek myth of Geryon, lord of an Atlantic isle, which has Celtic equivalents. Geryon was the ruler of the island of Erytheia, and was furnis hed with three heads, and a corresponding number of hands an d feet. He was the owner of numerous herds of magnifi cent cattle of a purple-red colour which grazed near the Lands of the Sun, that is in the West, for his isle of Er ytheia was situated in the Western Ocean, beyond the Pilla rs of Heracles, and enjoyed a salubrious climate. Heracle s, in the course of his labours, sailed to the island in the golden bowl of the Sun, or the vessel in which the Sun"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Atlantis in Britain 139 was imagined to float back to the east during the n ight hours. On landing in the island Heracles was attacked by Geryon's dog, Orthus, and his herdsman Eurytion, an d slew both. Geryon, hearing of this, hastened after Heracles and attacked him, but was likewise slain b y the hero, who then drove the cattle to the shore, and, with his horned spoil and Geryon's daughter, safely embarked in the golden bowl. In almost precisely the same manner, Cuchulainn, th e Irish Heracles, carries off the cows and daughter o f King Mider of the Inis Fer Falga or Island of the Men of Falga. But more to the point is the circumstance that both Geryon and Mider, who resided in Atlantic islands, were, l ike the Atlanteans, possessed of a herd of sacred cattle. We see, then, that the Atlantic island of British C eltic myth is in many of its circumstances the parallel o f Atlantis. Not only is it an insular locality, but it boasted a city, Caer Sidi, which was built, like Atlantis, in circular f orm, surrounded by a great fosse, or canal, garrisoned b y heavily- armed infantrymen, and its worship was connected in some manner with sacred cattle. We know, too, that it was thought of as having been overwhelmed by a f lood or other cataclysm of nature. The native myths of Britain contain further referen ces to cataclysmic insular disturbances than those already referred to and associated more with volcanic or seismic uph eaval than with flood. Plutarch in his De Defectu Oraculo rum alludes to one of them as follows: \"Demetrius furth er said, that of the islands around Britain many lie s cattered about uninhabited, of which some are named after de ities and heroes.

Soon after his arrival a great disturbance of the atmosphere took place, accompanied by many portents , by the winds bursting forth into hurricanes, and by fiery bolts falling. When it was over, the islanders said that some one of the mighty had passed away. For as a la mp on being lit, they said, brings with it no danger, while on being extinguished it is grievous to many, just so with regard to great souls, their beginning to shine for th is pleasant and the reverse of grievous, whereas the e xtinction and destruction of them frequently disturbs the win ds and the surge as at present; oftentimes also do they in fect the atmosphere with pestilential diseases. Moreover there is there, they said, an island in which Cronu s is imprisoned with Briaerus keeping guard over him as he sleeps, for, as they put it, sleep is the bond forg ed for Cronus. They add that around him are many deities, his henchmen and attendants.\" Now this myth is of great importance from more than one point of view. In the first place it refers to \"isl ands around Britain,\" many of which are called after gods and h eroes. Man and Skye, for example are so named. But some were uninhabited. Why? In all probability because at that period such volcanic or seismic disturbance s as that described in the above passage were of constan t occurrence. The islanders believed these storms and eruptions to be connected in some manner with the d ead, that is, with those who dwelt in the West. Further, the allusion to Cronus as being imprisoned in a still m ore distant island \"with Briaerus keeping guard over hi m as he sleeps,\" is, as Rhys justly remarks, a parallel with the sleep of Arthur in Avallon, the island which I have already shown to be in all likelihood one and the same with Atlantis. Nennius, too, describes how Benlli, a gia nt, having resisted St. Germanus, was, together with hi s entire"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Atlantis in Britain 141 court, burnt to ashes by fire from heaven. Now Benl li is also associated with the island of Ynys Benlli, or Bardsey, the locality in which Merlin disappeared in his hou se or ship of glass, and it too has been equated with Ava llon. Thus we find practically all the broader and more general circumstances of Plato's account of Atlanti s duplicated in British tradition—the belief in the s ub- mergence of a former insular marine locality situat ed in the West, its destruction by flood, volcanic or sei smic agency, its possession of a city built in a certain peculiar manner, and having a religious cult connected with cattle. The inevitable conclusion is that Atlantean refugee s or emigrants who had come closely in touch with them, must at some period have settled on British soil, a nd that the impression of the great catastrophe which had b efallen their ancestors in the Atlantean continent remained undisturbed for centuries, acquiring a literary and religious significance which mere legend could never have ach ieved. A study of Irish traditional lore also makes it cle ar that numerous Atlantean memories arc enshrined therein. The Formorians of Irish legend were the Domnu, peop le of the deep sea, or Fomors, People of the Under Sea , of the country which had sunk beneath the waves. Like the Titans, they were a people of gigantic stature, and, like them, they waged war upon the gods, the Tuatha De Danann. The Fenians, another early Irish race, were associa ted by tradition with the region about the Pillars of H ercules. Fenius Forsa, their eponymous ancestor, was the fat her of Nial, who married Scota, daughter of the Pharaoh of Egypt. Fenius and his clan were banished from Egypt for refusing to join in the persecution of the Chil dren of Israel and sojourned in Africa for forty-two years.

After other adventures, they landed in the realm of Asol, King of the Golden Pillars, from whom they received seven magical swine. The pillars in question appear to be the Pillars of Hercules. The legend of the overflowing of Lough Neagh has already been alluded to as almost precisely the sam e as the Welsh tale of Seithennyn, but the saga of \" The Voyage of Maildun\" refers to a number of magical islands i n the Atlantic and can scarcely be regarded as anything e lse than a direct folk-memory of the Atlantean group.

This basin had a secret outlet, of which Gradlon al one possessed the key, but his malevolent daughter, the Princess Dahut, feasting with her lover, and procee ding from one frivolity to another, stole the key and op ened the sluice gate, and the tide rushing in, submerged the city.

His palace closely resembled that of Atlantis. \"A stron g dike protected it from the ocean.\" There were gates which opened and closed on the sea-way, as in Atlan tis, and his palace was similarly decorated. The people of his city were similarly punished for their wickedne ss by the submergence of their land. It seems to me that there is little or no difference between the legend of Ys and that of Atlantis. Indeed the very name Ys or Is , as it is frequently spelled, seems merely an abbreviat ion of that of Atlant-is. Did land ever exist off the coast of France to such an extent as to give rise to such legends as that of t he city of Ys? In the summer of 1925 the world was astonished to learn of the probable existence of land directly of f this coast. I give here the best account I can find of t his discovery, which appeared in The New York Times: \"France may in a few years find her territory exten ded considerably, if a report of a tremendous rise in t he ocean's bottom made by a French officer commanding the army transport Loiret is confirmed by official investiga tion. \"In his report Lieutenant Cornet says that when the Loiret was travelling from Cape Ortegal to Rochefor t he noted peculiar waves, such as those washing over sandbars, when a hundred miles off shore in the cen tre of the Gulf of Gascony. \"Consulting his charts and checking his position by the sextant, the Lieutenant found the depths of thi s area recorded as between 4,000 and 5,000 metres.

M. Fichot, Director of th e Hydrographic Service of the French Naval Ministry, is more conservative in his statements, and says th e lieutenant's observations are worthy of careful stu dy, even though navigation in the Gulf may not be affec ted by a depth shallower than had been previously thoug ht. He says a naval commission will be sent to the Gulf of Gascony as soon as possible to check up the data an d ascertain the size and location of the submarine pl ateau. \"He does not believe there will be new land, but a submerged bar, of which the wave effect noted is a custom- ary indication.

Centuries later, fishermen drew up in their nets the stone capitals of pillars, the eloquent witnesses of cities deep drowned in the surrounding sea. The myth of Deucalion and the Flood is interesting to students of Atlantean lore, not only because it is a myth of inundation, but also because it has duplicates in A merican tradition. According to Lucian, Deucalion was the N oah of the Greek world. \"I have heard in Greece,\" says Lucian, \"what the Greeks say of Deucalion. The pres ent race of men, they allege, is not the first, for the y totally perished, but a second generation, who, being desce nded from Deucalion, increased to a great multitude. Of those former men they thus speak—they were insolent and addicted to unjust actions; they neither regarded o aths, nor were they hospitable to strangers, nor listened to suppliants; and this complicated wickedness was the cause of th eir destruction. On a sudden the earth poured forth a v ast quantity of water, great rains fell, the rivers ove rflowed, and the sea rose to a prodigious height. All things became water, and all men were destroyed. Only Deucalion was left, for a second race of men, on account of h is prudence and piety. He was saved in this manner. He went into a large ark or chest, and when he was wit hin, there entered swine, horses, lions, serpents, and a ll other creatures which live on earth, by pairs. He receive d them all, and they did him no hurt, for the gods created a friend- ship among them, so that they all sailed in one che st while the waters prevailed.\" Deucalion was saved in a small boat along with his wife Pyrrha.

Obeying the behest, they foun d the stones turned into men and women. We come now to the evidence from American tradition . This is indeed so rich as to be almost embarassing, and is probably so full because of its considerably lat er origin. The Muskhogee Indians preserved a myth to the effect that out of the primeval waste of waters aro se a great hill, Nunne Chaha, on which was the dwelling of Esaugetuh Emissee, \"Master of Breath,\" who made men from clay, and built a great wall, on which he set them to dry. He then directed the waters into the proper ch annels. The hill mentioned in this myth appears to be the s ame as that on which Poseidon raised his dwelling in At lantis, and the disposal of the waters bears a suspicious r esemb- lance to the sea-god's disposition of sea and land into zones. Of Manibozho or Michabo, the great god of the Algon - quins, it is related that he \"carved the land and s ea to his liking,\" and of Tawiscara, a god of the Hurons, tha t he \"guided the torrents into smooth seas and lakes.\" But even more striking are the analogous legends of certain Indian tribes of South America. The Antis I ndians of Bolivia and North-west Brazil say that the world was visited by a great flood, in which men were forced to take refuge in caves. Volcanic upheavals followed, and humanity was ultimately destroyed. The Macusi tribe of Arawaks tell how the only people who survived th e deluge repeopled the earth by changing stones into human beings, as did Deucalion and Pyrrha in the Greek my th. The Tamanacs have a similar myth, in which the surv ivors were said to have thrown over their heads the fruit s of the Mauritius palm, from the kernels of which sprang me n and women.

The Caribs believe that their supernatural ancestor sowed the soil with stones, which grew up into men and women, another variant of the Deucalion myt h. A legend of the Okanguas states that a great medici ne woman ruled over a \"lost island,\" and the Delaware Indians have legends telling of a mighty inundation and a hasty folk-migration in consequence. The Aztecs of Mexico possessed many traditions whic h seem to preserve the memory of early cataclysmic ev ents. According to different authorities these had been e ither four or five in number. The Codex Vaticanus states that \"in the first age or sun, water reigned until it de stroyed the world.\" This age lasted 4,008 years, and men we re changed into fishes. The second age lasted 4,010 ye ars, and terminated with the destruction of the world by violent winds, and the transformation of men into a pes. The third ended with fire and the fourth with famin e. The Peruvian god, Pariacaca arrived, as Poseidon ha d done, in a hilly country. But the people reviled hi m, and he sent a great flood upon them, so that their vill age was destroyed. Meeting a beautiful maiden, Choque Suso, who was weeping bitterly, he inquired the cause of her grief, and she informed him that the maize crop was dying for lack of water. He assured her that he would rev ive the maize if she would bestow her affections on him , and when she consented to his suit he irrigated the lan d by canals.

These Peruvian myths bear a close resemblance in de tail to that part of Plato's account which deals with th e wooing of Cleito, the enclosure of the hill, and the makin g of an irrigation zone. The statue of the wife of the god is also alluded to, and the god himself is described as dis appearing into the sea, as Poseidon might well have done. The flood, too, we see, was brought about by the wicked ness or love of pleasure of the human race. The legends of the Tupi-Guarani of Brazil preserve a similar tradition to that of Plato, so far as its c atastrophic part is concerned: \"Monan, the Maker, the Begetter, without beginning or end, author of all that is, seeing the ingratitu de of men, and their contempt for him that had made them thus joyous, withdrew from them, and sent upon them tata , the divine fire, which burned all that was on the surfa ce of the earth. He swept about the fire in such a way that i n places he raised mountains and in others deep valle ys. Of all men, one alone, Irin Mage (the One who Sees) , was saved, whom Monan carried into heaven. He, seei ng all things destroyed, spoke thus to Monan: 'Wilt th ou also destroy all the heavens and their garniture? A las! henceforth where will be our home?

These buildings stood in Upper Mix- teca, close to the place Apoala (Accumulation of Wa ter) and the mountain which was called \"Place Where the Heavens Stood.\" These deities had twin sons, and all four were skilled in magic. \"The deer gods had more sons and daughters, but there came a flood in which many of these perished. After the catastrophe was o ver, the god who is called the creator of all things for med the heavens and earth and restored the human race.\" Here once again we encounter the mountain, the twin s, the \"accumulation of water\" or canals, and the male and female deity dwelling in an enclosed place in undis turbed peace, as did Poseidon and Cleito.

To his paradise after death the drowned and dropsical folk repaired, all, in fact, who perished by the agency of water. The Mexican myths relating to the god Quetzalcoatl and his people the Toltecs are eloquent of Atlantea n reminiscence. Torquemada, in his Monarquia Indiana describes the Toltecs as a race clad in robes of bl ack linen, who entered Mexico by way of Panuco, and who settle d at Tollan and Cholula. Their chief was one Quetzalc oatl, a man with a long beard and ruddy complexion. They were able handicraftsmen, architects and agricultur ists. A native Mexican historian, Ixtlilxochitl, gives an account of the Toltecs which bears a surprising res emblance to the Platonic story of Atlantis. He tells us that the city of Tollan was a place of magnificent palaces a nd temples, the kings of which were at first wise and politic, but later gave way to licentious and profligate hab its. The provinces rose in revolt, and the gods grew wro th with both King and people because of their selfishn ess and love of pleasure. Alternate frosts and heats of gre at severity visited the city, so that the crops perish ed and the rocks melted, and plagues completed the ruin. I t is obvious that no such visitations could have occu rred on Mexican soil, where frost is seldom experienced, and it seems probable that the story is a reminiscence of cataclysm in another and more distant sphere, and t hat the melting rocks are significant of seismic or vol canic outbreaks.

This personage was regarded both as chief of the immigrant Toltecs of Mexico and the Ma ya of Central America. The most complete account of Quetzalcoatl is that of Sahagun, who describes the prosper- ity of Tollan in his day. He was a great culture-br inger, his palaces were magnificent, and in his time the m aize-crop was immense. But native sorcerers gave him a draugh t which awoke in him a strong desire to return to the home in the Atlantic whence he had come. The magicians informed him that he must return to Tollan-Tlapalla n across the sea, and this he did in a raft of serpen ts. The Codex Telleriano-Remensis says of Quetzalcoatl: \"Quetzalcoatl, they say, was he who created the wor ld. And they bestowed upon him the appelation of Lord o f the Wind, because they say that Tonacatecutli, when it appeared good to him, breathed and begat Quetzalcoa tl, . . . They celebrated a festival on the sign of the four earthquakes to the destroyer with reference to the fate which again waited the world: for they said that it had undergone four destructions and would again be dest royed.

He is co nnected with an oceanic region east of Mexico, with catacly sm or earthquake, with the story of the Flood, and with t he archaic legend that the world had been destroyed be cause of the wickedness of mankind. The Maya legends pres ent even more striking associations with the Atlantean tradi- tion. An ancient book in the Maya tongue, destroyed by Nunez de la Vega, but quoted by him, tells how Vota n (the Quiche name of Quetzalcoatl) was commanded to proceed to Mexico to civilise the country. With thi s intention he left the land of Valum Chivim, and, co ming to Central America, founded the city of Palenque. H e made several visits to his ancestral home, and left a record of his travels in a temple near the Huehuetan River , known as \"The House of Darkness,\" which Nunez de la Vega"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"158 The History of Atlantis professed to have discovered when he visited Huehue tan in 1691. 1 That such a civilised race as these legends speak o f actually did arrive in Central America is certain.

There are no signs of its grow th on American soil, so we must assume that it came to fr uition elsewhere. This alone gives probability to the trad ition of Quetzalcoatl's settlement in Central America. Mo re- over, the Atlantean significance of Quetzalcoatl's myth is clear, as has been indicated. The architecture of T ollan, as described by Ixtlilxochitl and others, bears a s triking resemblance to that of Atlantis as described by Pla to, the seismic or cataclysmic circumstances are present in both accounts, and the sinfulness of the denizens of bot h regions is a significant circumstance. Quetzalcoatl's father was Citallatonali, to whom hi s son dedicated a special cult. He is represented by the sign cipactli, the dragon or whale from which the earth was made, and which rose out of the sea. In Maya myth h e is alluded to as \"the Old Serpent covered with gree n feathers, who lies in the ocean.\" Quetzalcoatl's mo ther was Citlallinicue or Coatlicue, a name which seems to bear a suspicious resemblance to that of Cleito, th e maiden whom Poseidon espoused, and who bore him Atlas and other sons. Quetzalcoatl can readily be compared with Atlas. In several places in Mexican art he is represented as the earth-bearer, especially in a statuette found in Mexico City, at Chichen-Itza and elsewhere. In these he is depicted as bearing the world or the sky upon his h ead, and Dr. J. H.

A simi- lar condition of things has been recorded by Profes sor J. Macmillan Brown in his Riddle of the Pacific, in wh ich he alludes to the settlement of Hotu Matua, a culture- hero from a sunken region in the Pacific, upon Easter Is land. It seems probable, then, that Quetzalcoatl and his people were immigrants from Antillia, the westward portion of the Atlantean continent, which, I believe, long sur vived the eastern or Atlantean portion proper. I have, as already mentioned, dealt fully with this aspect of Quetzal- coatl's myth elsewhere.

It is poss ible to gather a general idea of the style of architectu re in vogue, both from the account of Plato, and the researches of the Anglo-Spanish School of Archaeology at Huelva in Sp ain, already alluded to. Plato states that the style of architecture affected by the Atlanteans was \"barbar ic,\" and this to a Greek certainly meant \"Oriental.\" He tell s us that the exterior of the great temple of Cleito and Poseidon was garnished with silver, that its pinnac les glittered with gold, and that the interior was roof ed with ivory, gold, silver and orichalcum, or copper. But in view of a complete ignorance of all metals on the p art of the Azilians, such a description is certainly misle ading. It is much safer to rely upon the results of the re cent Spanish excavations at Huelva, and regard Atlantean architecture as of the \"Cyclopean\" type, such as is encountered at Mycenae and elsewhere. Such buildings are constructed of large blocks of s tone accurately squared, with well-fitting beds and join ts, but unequal in size. Enormous monoliths were usually employed for gateways. But the term \"Cyclopean\" is also given to walls constructed of polygonal blocks , which in many cases are fitted together with great skill and care. Examples of this species of masonry exist not only in Greece, but also in many sites in Etrur ia and America, and there can be no doubt of the extreme antiquity of the method employed.

Of these the most outstanding is Carthage, the plan of which is almost identical with that of Atlantis. In deed, both Atlantis and Carthage had a citadel hill encir cled by zones of land and water, a canal to the sea, and bridges over the zones, fortified by towers. In both cases the docks were roofed in, the cities were encircled by three walls, both had great cisterns for the supply of dr inking water and baths, and both were guarded by a great s ea- wall, masking the entrance to the harbour.

The question of the presence of pyramids in Atlanti s also arises. It seems unlikely that they were actua lly to be found there, but it is probable that the pyra mid in Egypt and America is merely a later reminiscence of the sacred hill of Atlantis. In early Egypt, Mexico and Peru certain hills were regarded as especially sacred, a s the homes of powerful supernatural beings. In Mexico th e mountain was regarded as the home of the Goddess of Fertility, and in some parts of that country it was faced with stone, like the Egyptian pyramid, although in the region inhabited by the Mound Builders of the Missi s- sippi, it was constructed from earth alone. The lin k between the Mexican pyramid constructed from masonr y and the simple earthen) lull is provided by the ear thern mound sacred to the goddess Coatlicue close to the teocalli or pyramid of her son, Uitzilopochtli, at Mexico. Personages of importance were buried in these Ameri can pyramids just as they were in those of Egypt, which were also obviously developed from the idea of the sacre d mountain. Indeed several of the Egyptian pyramids were called by such names as \"Mountain of Ra,\" and similar titles. Egyptian and American pyramids have thus a common evolutionary history. The idea must have sprung fro m a common centre. Both would appear to trace their descent from the sacred hill of Atlantis.

The fruit with the hard rin d grown in Atlantis which afforded both meat, drink a nd ointment has already been alluded to, and was obvio usly the coconut, or some species thereof. Animal food was supplied by cattle, large flocks of sheep and goats, and fish. The great plains would supply plenty of pasture to the ruminant animals, b ut it is unlikely that the horse was regarded as a food a nimal, as in the early ages, once it had become a beast of burden. The same applies to the elephant. That this animal was used in war is most probable. It will be recall ed that the Carthaginians, who had many Atlantean memo ries, employed it for this purpose against the Romans and the Iberian tribes of Spain. A notion of the costume and dress of the Atlanteans can only be gathered from the drawings which the Az ilians have left us of themselves.

But it would not be reasonable to infer from these pictures that almost complete male nudity was universal, or even customary. Ceremonial costumes were certainly worn by the priests, as seen in the dancing figures from l' abri Mege, who wear skins and animal masks, and the circumstan ce that many of the dead were wrapped in skins and lea ther jerkins on which shells had been sewn, justifies th e assump- tion that in life they wore similar garments. The h ead- dresses of the statuettes found at Willendorf and B rassem- pouy closely resemble Egyptian head-coverings, and a number of the men in the Alpine paintings are repre sented as wearing plumed headdresses very like those still in use among Red Indian tribes. Others wear hats of hi gh triangular shape, not unlike a Scots bonnet, and so me of the women conical caps, made, perhaps, of bark o r fur. Some of the men wear plumed bands beneath the knee and round the ankles like the Masai of south-easter n Africa; and probably both sexes wore ornaments of s hells and teeth, painted or plain.

Plato, in stating that the laws of Atlantis were engraved on a column of orichalcum implies that they possessed so me system of writing. On this subject we may, perhaps, quote the opinion of Dr. T. Rice Holmes 1 : \"Many people have heard vaguely of the painted pebbles and the frescoes of Mas d'Azil and the other caverns in the Western Pyrenee s which the veteran archaeologist, Edouard Piette, ha s for many years diligently searched. On one of the objec ts found in the cavern of Lorthet—a spirited engraving on reindeer-horn representing reindeer and salmon— are to be seen two small lozenges, each enclosing a central line: 'Justly proud of his work,' says Monsieur Pie tte, 'the artist has appended his signature.' Be this as it may, other explorers have exhumed from the Placard cave at Rochebertier and the caves of La Madelaine and Mas d'Azil antlers incised with signs which exactly resemble various Greek and Phoenician letters, and may be compared with signs that have been found in an i sland of the Pacific. These signs are not letters but sym bols; they are not combined in such a way as to form word s or inscriptions.

It is not claimed for a moment that the European alphabetic system which we presen tly employ is other than Phoenician in origin, with a p ossible Egyptian background. But the known origin of all systems of writing in symbolism, the identity of ma ny European, Egyptian and American symbols which were used for the purposes of communication, and the obv ious necessity for presupposing for these a link situate d in an Atlantean locality, are circumstances which plea d for careful consideration.

No other conclus ion can be reached, then, save that the early pictorial symbols of the Old World and the New must have originated f rom one common source probably in the Atlantic area.

Doubtless they had their civil and religiou s books, carved on stone or painted on cavern walls. As we have seen, the Canary Islands abound in caverns, \"Where,\" says Osborn, 1 \"the ceilings were covered with a uniform coat of red ochre, while the walls were dec orated with various geometric designs in red, black, grey and white.\" Rene Verneau, a French anthropologist of ex - perience, writes of them: \"All these walls (in the Grotto of Goldar) are decorated with paintings.\" 2 Thus, in the last remaining portion of Atlantis, proof is forthc oming that its ancient inhabitants possessed a symbolism of their own.

As I have said before, it seems perfectly possible that Atlantis may have survived until a considerably later date t han Plato fixed for its submergence, and if this be so, we have a period of time in which its people may have advan ced from the comparative state of barbarism which undou bt- edly distinguished them in Azilian times to a condi tion of much greater mental complexity than was possible in that era. If this be so, their invasion of the soil of their neighbours speaks badly for their general state of mind. Nor d oes the cruel sport of bull-baiting, which they appear to h ave indulged in, afford other than a picture of brutali ty which chimes ill with their alleged culture. May it not be that the vices usually attributed to the \"Antediluvians\" in the sacred writings of many peop les are nothing but a memory of the flagrant behaviour of t he Atlanteans, who similarly perished by flood?

There were also, we are told, \"giants (Titans) in the ear th in those days.\" So evil did men become that the Creato r resolved to destroy them.

Noah a lso exclaimed: \"Lord, forgive me and my parents, and ev ery one who shall enter my house, and add unto the unju st doers nothing but destruction.\" On this subject the Oriental commentators on the Koran are divided, som e maintaining that Noah here referred to his own dwel ling- house, and others to the temple he had built for th e wor- ship of God, or to the Ark then in progress. The Koran affirmed that Noah, while he was building the Ark, often replied to the scoffings of the unbe lievers in this manner: \"Though you scoff at us now, we wil l scoff at you hereafter, as ye scoff at us; and ye shall s urely know on whom a punishment shall be inflicted, which will cover you with shame, and on whom a lasting punishment sh all fall.\" In the Babylonian epic of Gilgamesh the god Ea grow s angry at the sinfulness of the people of Suruppak, and precipitates such a disastrous flood that \"no conti nent appeared on the waste of waters.\" The Greek myth of Deucalion states that the Antediluvians \"were insol ent, and addicted to unjust actions; they neither regard ed oaths nor were they hospitable to strangers nor listened to sup- pliants; and this complicated wickedness was the ca use of their destruction. Of a sudden the earth poured for th a vast quantity of water . . . and all men were destr oyed.\" Ovid, in his Latin account of the Deluge makes Jupi ter say: \"It were endless to repeat the aggravated guil t which everywhere appeared.\" Egyptian legend relates that the god Tern let loose the waters of the primeval abyss over the earth to destroy mankind because of its wickedn ess."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Life in Atlantis 173 Vishnu, in Hindu myth, sends a flood upon the earth because \"all creatures had offended him.\" In Breton legend the city of Ys is overwhelmed by the waters because of the profligacy of its princess, \"who had made a crown of her vices, and taken for her pages the seven cap ital sins.\" In a myth of the Arawak Indians the god Aimo n Kondi scourges the world with fire, followed by a f lood, because of the shortcomings of man, and countless o ther myths speak of the drowning of the human race for i ts wickedness.

Not the least valuable evidence from America is the myth of the destruction of the wicked as given by M r.

For example, we are informed that a particular rite attended the deliberations of the kings which took place once in every six years. Before the assize of justi ce which was held on that occasion ten bulls were brou ght into the sacred zone, and each one of the Atlantean kings made a vow to offer up one of these bulls to Poseid on without employing the agency of iron. The animals were then led to the graven copper column and immol ated, after which the kings passed the members of each bu ll through the fire, making a libation of the blood an d drenching the column with it, after which the sacri fices were totally consumed by fire. The remainder of the blood was placed in small vases of gold and splashe d on to the fire, a little of it being drunk. Now this ceremony very closely resembles several of those practised by the Aztec peoples. The Mexican priests were in the habit of leading their human vi ctims to a similar graven column, of making libations of their blood from vases of gold, and even of drinking some of it. That they employed human rather than animal sacrifice is simply to be accounted for by the fact that no large animals were known in Mexico, but further nor th the Indian tribes, from whom the Aztecs were derive d, sacrificed the buffalo almost in the self-same mann er in which the Atlanteans immolated the bull. 180"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"The Religion of Atlantis 181 We know also that the bull was the sacred animal of the Aurignacians, as its presence in many of their cave- temples proves, and that they actually sacrificed i t there can be little doubt. The cult of the bull was perha ps the first and certainly one of the most widespread reli gions in Western Europe, and that it penetrated to Egypt is of course well known. Let us examine the bull-worship of Egypt briefly and see if it is capable of throwing any light upon the circumstances of the Atlantean cult. That bull-worship in Egypt was certainly of very ea rly origin is proved by the statement of Manetho, an Eg yptian priest, who traces the cult of Apis to a King of th e Second Dynasty, about 3000 B.C. AElian, indeed, goes furth er back and assigns the origin of the practice to Mena , the first king of the First Egyptian Dynasty. This, of course, implies that the cult was probably very much more ancient, as practically everything pristine in Egyp t was regarded as having been introduced by Mena, the gre at culture-hero, or introducer of civilisation into th e Nile region. Herodotus describes the Apis bull as black in colour, but having a square spot of white on the fo rehead, and on the back the figure of an eagle, with double hairs in the tail and the mark of a beetle on the tongue. The Egyptians believed that the soul of Osiris had pass ed after death into a bull, and that when this bull di ed it was necessary to find a bull calf which had the sel f-same markings, in order that the soul of the god might l ive on. Now it has been already observed that the cult of O siris with its concomitant practice of mummification, was of western origin, that indeed it was nothing more nor less than an Egyptian adoption and amplification of the ancient Aurignacian belief that the soul resided in the bon es, and that, if the spirit were to survive, the bones must be carefully preserved.

We also find that oxen w ere sacrificed to it, which clearly indicates that it w as regarded as being among that class of animal which is though t of by barbarous people as being the chief or \"king\" of his \"people.\" The Indian tribes of America, for example , were wont to pray to the Great Deer to send his \"pe ople\" as prey to them, and he was placated whenever a dee r was killed. In like manner certain barbarous fishing po pu- lations entreated the Great Fish to send shoals of his subjects into their nets. In ancient Peru a Great P otato Mother was worshipped as the prototype of all potat oes, a Maize Mother as the progenitor of the maize plant , and so forth. It seems probable then that the Aurignaci ans had been in the habit of worshipping a Great Bull w ho kept them supplied with meat, and that this notion gradu- ally passed into Egypt, whose people probably did n ot understand or had forgotten its original significan ce. We find the Osirian worship linked up with that of the bull by the practice of embalming and mummifying th e dead Apis bull, the remains of numerous Apis animal s having been discovered in the famous Serapeum. This worship of Serapis or Osiris-Apis spread from Egypt throughout Europe, was adopted by Rome, and finally reached Britain, where a great temple to th e dual god was built at York.

Students of comparative religion are now beginning to see that any theory which does not allow for the origin of any c ustom, religious or otherwise, in one especial sphere is s carcely worth credit, and if this be admitted, it is obviou s that the origin of bull-worship must be looked for in on e especial area. This would imply that bull-worship f rom Britain to India had an Atlantean genesis. But when it is found that in Spain it was associated with the begi nnings of the embalmer's craft, and that in Egypt it was i dentified with mummification, it will scarcely be doubted tha t the Egyptian and Aurignacian cults must have had a comm on beginning. If we believe that the Aurignacians came from Atlantis, we can scarcely doubt that they brought t he cult of the bull along with them, and surely we find cor robor- ation of the fact in the Platonic account of Atlant is. In- deed the whole circumstances of the bull-cult, as d rawn from the comparative study of its phenomena in Spai n France, Britain, Crete and Egypt, are eloquent of i ts origin in sunken Atlantis, where, according to Plat o's details, themselves drawn from an Egyptian source, we also find the worship of the bull in full celebrati on."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"184 The History of Atlantis How far Plato's account of bull-sacrifice in Atlant is was sophisticated by a similar sacrifice in the Helleni c worship of Bacchus may be gauged from a brief study of the Bacchic ceremony. In one of his phases—an early pha se —Bacchus appears as a bull. Even in the time of Eur i- pides Bacchus was adored in his bull-form in Macedo nia, if not in more cultured Athens, and in the Orphic m yster- ies the worshipper, before he was made one with Bac chus, devoured the raw flesh of a bull. \"That a feast of raw flesh of some sort was traditionally held to be a p art of Bacchic ceremonial,\" says Miss Jane Harrison in her Prolegomena to the study of Greek Religion \" is cle ar.\" Fir- minius Maternus, the Christian father, says of the Cretans: \"They tear in pieces a live bull with their teeth, and by howling with discordant shouts through the secret p laces of the woods, they simulate the madness of an enrag ed animal.\" If the bull-eater did not inhabit Athens i n the days of Plato, he must have been known there at lea st, and it seems not improbable that Plato coloured his account of the bull-sacrifices of the Atlanteans by the light of what actually happened in the Orphic myste ries. The connection of the bull with Poseidon brings us to the question of the personnel of the gods of Atlant is. The bull was the especial symbol of this deity, bul ls were sacrificed to him, and when we recall that he was t he god of the earthquake as well as of the raging sea, the al legorical connection of the bull with this god seems clear en ough. It was undoubtedly regarded from very early times a s the embodiment of wrath, the bellowing beast which stam ped the earth—the earth-shaker, so to speak, affording an excellent animal picture of earthquake and tempest.

The gods of Atlantis, though dim enough in all con- science, may yet be gathered into a species of prov isional pantheon. Poseidon himself was believed by the Gree ks to be a Pelasgian or Asiatic deity somewhat resembl ing the Assyrian Ea or Dagon, whose fish's tail is so p rominent in Assyrian and Babylonian sculpture. This god was also worshipped by the Phoenician people of Carthag e, but it seems quite probable that, just as Osiris was of western origin, so was Poseidon. In the first place, he, li ke all the other Titans, hailed originally from the west, and the greater number of the legends connected with him as sociate him with western localities. Moreover, we find him in Plato's account most definitely associated with Atl antis, where we are told his temple was the chief seat of worship in the island. The association of Atlas in a definite group with o ther gods whose names still cling to existing countries makes it very plain that his own name was not associated with Atlantis by a mere figment of the Platonic imaginat ion. We find him in Greek mythology grouped along with his brother Titans, Albion and Iberius, the giant g ods of Britain and Ireland, in a most definite manner. The se, it may be assumed, formed a species of archipelagic pantheon. All three were Titans, and, as we know, t he Titans were merely western gods. The myth of the Titans in itself is significant for our study. Inde ed, it seems to me that this ancient story of giant god s coming from the west and invading Olympus is almost certai nly an allegory of the invasion of Europe, or rather of the Mediterranean area, by the gods of an alien religio n, and that some such idea not only originated the myt h, but that it lingered long in popular consciousness, is plain from the fact that it was one of the most pop ular"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"186 The History of Atlantis subjects in classical art. We find these gods indis solubly connected with the Atlantic area, and the names of at least two of them still connected with the British islands. It is absurd to suppose that the Greeks invented th e names of certain gods or Titans and imposed them as prote ctive deities upon Britain and Ireland. In fact it is kno wn that the names Albion and Iberius are of Celtic ori gin and have reference to tutelary gods. This being so, how are we to account for Atlas? His island has disappe ared, yet his name and that of Atlantis remain. Were Brit ain, which we are told \"arose above the azure main,\" to sink back to its original place in the bed of the Atlant ic, men ten thousand years hence might well doubt her forme r existence, and the name of her god Albion might be regarded as merely an effort of classical ingenuity to render more probable what all \"sensible\" people wou ld look upon as a mere myth. Surely it seems most likely, then, that these very definite notices of a Titanic pantheon which had it s origin in the Atlantic area, and the names of which are st ill attached to certain of the islands over which they presided, arose out of the memory of an ancient and powerful religion which had a widespread influence not only in the then existing Atlantic archipelago, but which overf lowed into the Mediterranean area. Nor is this theory at all weakened when we come to observe the very great sanctity in which the people s of the Mediterranean held the western oceanic area, for there they placed the locality of the Fortunate Islands and the Gardens of the Hesperides. The earliest Gre ek poetry situates the abode of the happy departed spi rits far beyond the entrance to the Mediterranean, on is lands in the midst of the River Oceanus.

In Greek myth the Fortunate Islands are frequently confounded with the Hesperides, or Islands of the G olden Apples, situated on the River Oceanus, or, accordin g to later notions, off the North and West coasts of Afr ica. Many details added by popular superstition to the s tate of happiness which the poets taught as existing in the Fortunate Isles, may be found in the second Book of Lucian, and in his Necyomantia. The notion that the dead betook themselves to the west, may indeed be added to the number of ideas wh ich in another chapter will be found as composing what the writer calls the Atlantean complex, but it is inclu ded in this place not only because we are now dealing with the religious part of our subject, but because it i s perhaps rather more dubious than the remainder of the proof which seems to justify the former existence of such a complex.

Indeed, we find it believed in by all those races w ho must have in some degree acquired the Atlantean civilisa tion. The Celts, whose long association with the Iberians in Spain must have imbued them with the idea, devoutly believed that the abode of the dead was situated in the Atlantic, and we find the Greeks, Romans and Cretan s holding the same belief.

We find the Peruvians passionately attached t o their Paccarisca or mythical place of origin—often a cave or mountain-side—and desiring burial within its pre cincts. The western half of Crete, in Minoan times, was lef t almost unoccupied because it was regarded as the ho me of the departed, just as the western islands of Bri tain were thought of as being haunted by disembodied spi rits, just as Britain itself was regarded by a primeval E urope as an island of ghosts. The Egyptians also looked t owards the west as the place of the dead. It will not do t o attempt to explain this idea by saying that it is n atural for Man to regard the west as the place of sleep after life simply because the sun sets there, for we find many races looking towards other parts of the compass as the r egion of mortality. The Aztecs, for example, regarded the north as the place of souls. The Chinese looked to the east, and we have seen that Hotu Matua, the culture -hero of Easter Island, although he looked to the west wh en he called to the spirits who hovered over his subme rged home, is still associated with the myth which tells how a large archipelago existed three hundred miles east of the island. Quetzalcoatl, too, the culture-hero of Central America, looked eastwards, and many other myths of an Oriental paradise could be supplied. We find then that not only was there a well-founded memory of the former existence of a great religion in the Atlantic region, but that the locality in which it had flourished had been erected into a paradise by the peoples who had accepted that religion in part.

This leads to the assumption that the religion of A tlantis was closely associated with astrology. It has becom e a truism almost that the ancient science of astrology had its beginnings in the plains of Babylonia, and inde ed it is almost a popular belief nowadays that the ziggur ats or temple-towers of Chaldea were the world's first observa- tories.

It was indeed a book of augury and over its days certain gods pre sided. These days thus became significant for good or evil , according to the nature of the gods who presided ov er them or over the precise hour in which a person was born , or any act performed. As in Eastern astrology, a kind of balance was held between good and evil, so that if the god presiding over the day was inauspicious, his influe nce might in some measure be counteracted by that of the deit y who presided over the hour in which a child first saw t he light, or an event occurred. Now the twenty gods who presided over its twenty day-signs are all capable of being identified with certain stars or planets. Quetzalcoatl, for example, can be identified as the planet Venus, and it is notable t hat several of the gods in this calendar can be equated with ce rtain members of the Atlantean pantheon, Quetzalcoatl, fo r instance, with Atlas, as has already been demonstra ted, and Coatlicue with Cleito, whilst Tlaloc, Tezcatlipoca and Xochiquetzal have all an Atlantean significance, so far as their myths and symbols are concerned, as has been proved in other parts of this work. 1 See the writer's Gods of Mexico passion.

He was also rega rded as the inventor of the tonalamatl, which was thus l ooked upon as the sacred divinitory book or table of a cu lture- hero who had come from some region in the Atlantic Ocean. This in itself is surely sufficient proof th at the astrological system of Mexico either emanated from Atlantis or had Atlantean associations. Its methods are wholly unlike those of the East, and that it had be en in- troduced into America seems plain enough. Greek myt h assures us that the Atlantean deities were closely associated with the stars and that Atlas was a great astrologe r. When we find him in another form in America, but with th e self- same attributes as those of Atlas, and regarded as the creator of the astrological system of Central Ameri ca (which he carried to its shores) in an Atlantic locality, a good deal of adverse proof will be required to discredit the theory that Central American astrology did not draw its or igins from Atlantean sources. We can imagine the Atlantean religion, then, as ass ocia- ted with a pantheon of Titanic beings and as having a powerful astrological connection. These are no mere sur- mises, but basic facts. That the early Hellenic, Me diter- ranean and British religions were also founded on a simi- lar basis is obvious, and it was only in later hist orical times that notions similar to those which must have obtai ned in Atlantis began to be overlaid by departmental deiti es, gods of the virtues and vices, gods of trades and a griculture.

A careful examination of the giant-lore of Europe undoubtedly brings to light the existence of a form er great Titanic pantheon, and it is remarkable that the maj ority of the legends connected with these gigantic beings speak of them as having come out of the western seas.

A more exhaustive study of the giant-lore of Europe , and especially of its western portions, would in al l probab- ility throw a great flood of light upon the whole c ircum- stances of the Atlantean legend, especially if the central story of the battle between the Titans and the gods and the Atlantean origin thereof were carefully kept in view.

The appe- tite of Gargantua, the Breton giant, who is one of the Gorics of the French peninsula, has become classica l through the lively pen of Rabelais, and the giants of Britain and the Jotunn of Scandinavia alike were famous for devouring sheep and oxen whole. It is remarkable, t oo, that Moloch, a god especially favoured by the Carth a- ginians—a people with many Atlantean memories—was a great devourer of children.

The reference is t o Druidism. Now it is well known that Druidism was not a religion of Celtic provenance, but of Iberian origin. Caesar, in a well-known passage, remarks that it wa s thought to have arisen in Britain, and to have been brought thence into Gaul. The Iberians, who seem to have in - stituted it, were, as has been said before, the dir ect descendants of the Azilians, one of the waves of At lantean immigrants, so that it seems more than probable tha t Druidism was the last phase of an imported Atlantea n religion. We know that it was also practised in Spa in and in the Canary Islands, the last terrestrial vestige s of Atlantis.

But may not the ra bbit and other leptorrhine species have originated upon Atlantis itself and have spread eastwards and westw ards to America and Africa? If, as Professor Scharff sta tes, the land-bridge connecting these two continents lay considerably south of the Atlantic islands, it seem s a little difficult to account for the fact that the r abbit prevails in much greater numbers in the more temperate north ern latitudes. We find the rodent species invading and re-invading European soil in the more severe phases of the recurring Ice Ages, in fact Macalister has laid it down that as the glaciations drew near, and the for ests began to give place to steppe conditions, the small rodents invariably returned to European soil, and it is the ir presence, indeed, which delimits the later intergla ciations. At the same time it is notorious that the rabbit fl ourishes exceedingly in such a mild climate as that of Austr alia, to which the climate of Atlantis must have borne a certain general resemblance, so that it seems a little diff icult to account for the species pressing from a genial clim ate into an area where tundra conditions prevailed. It seems probable, however, that the rabbit may actual ly have originated upon Atlantean soil—a habitat most suitable for its development and speedy propagation , and that later the struggle for existence through overc rowding forced it into less congenial regions."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Animal Life in Atlantis 203 It has frequently been pointed out, too, that the c arni- vorous animals of Tertiary times in Europe are clos ely connected with those of America.

It has occasionally been stated with some authority that Atlantis may have been the cradle of all anima l life. Such a statement, in view of our lack of knowledge on the subject, should be regarded cautiously. Certain cir cum- stances exist, however, which seem to render it not improbable that some species may have had their beg in- nings on the island-continent. The data connected w ith the migrations of the eel, for example, lend colour to this assumption. Dr. Johannes Schmidt, the Danish biolog ist, who has paid great attention to the migrations of t he eel, is inclined to think that it may have originated in the ocean fastnesses surrounding the site of Atlantis. The parent eels annually leave our shores and deposit t heir eggs deep down in the Atlantic Ocean between the Ba hama Isles and Europe, after which all trace of them dis appears, but their young make their way back more than four thousand miles to our rivers. For nearly three year s they swim on, steering a steadfast course for the s hores of Britain, while the American eels, which are dist inguished by a shorter back-bone, unerringly make their way b ack to their own country. This would seem to indicate that their instinct carries them to the primeval br eeding- place from which both the eels of Europe and Americ a originally migrated.

Larg e flocks of birds, too, follow their example and tumb le exhausted into the sea, and the beautiful saffron-w inged catopsilia of British Guiana, which has been descri bed by Dr. William Beebe, the American naturalist, obey s a similar oceanic call. Annually the males of this sp ecies take part in the fatal flight. In great coloured cl ouds they fly into the sea. If these migrations are not eloquent of an animal impulse to return to the lost Atlantis , it would indeed be difficult to say what was. Two well-known biologists, the Messrs.

The Marques de Cerralbo discovered the bones of Elephas antiquu s along with human artifacts at Torralba in the provi nce of Soria, Spain. If then, this animal existed in Sp ain in the period in question, a period which witnessed human immigration from Atlantis, it is not improbable tha t it was still wandering to and fro between the European mainland and the island-continent over a still-exis ting land-bridge, and that, after this land-bridge disap peared, it became extinct in Europe, but continued to flour ish in Atlantis, where it was marooned. I cannot, however, find any trace of its former existence in the Canar ies or Azores, but excavation in these groups had been of so perfunctory a character that when it is undertaken on a larger scale surprising developments may be expec ted. In any case, there is nothing extravagant in the su pposition that elephants actually existed in Atlantis. If the y did not, it is most unlikely that the Egyptian traditio n, as handed down by Plato, would have alluded to them at all. The elephant was an animal by no means familiar in Egypt, although known to the Egyptians to exist in Central Africa. It is, therefore, unlikely that it would have been dragged in by the priest of Sais merely to ren der his tale still more highly coloured.

Fifteen species of marine mollu sca lived at the same time, both in the West Indies and on the coast of Senegal, and nowhere else, unless this co- existence can be explained by the transportation of the embryos. On the other hand, the Madreporaria fauna of the island of St. Thomas, studied by M. Gravier, includes six species—one does not live outside of S t. Thomas, except in the Florida reefs, and four other s are known only from the Bermudas. As the duration o f the pelagic life of the Madreporaria is only a few days, it is impossible to attribute this surprising reapp earance to the action of marine currents. In taking all thi s into account, M.

During the Miocene period, again, this continent ex tends as far as the West Indies.

The colonial expansion of Atlantis has especially been stressed in more recent times by Do nelly, Brasseur de Bourbourg and Augustus Le Plongeon, all of whom seek to establish an Egyptian connection. The general attitude of the majority of those writers w ho believe in the Atlantean penetration of America or European countries may, perhaps, be summed up in a passage f rom an article \"Some Notes on the Lost Atlantis,\" which appeared in Papyrus, the official organ of the Theo sophical Society in Egypt, for March, 1921. \"Atlantis sent h er children over the entire world,\" says the writer of this article. \"Many of them are to this day living as Re d Indians in Canada and the United States of America.

It i s, however, possible to say almost definitely that the archi- tectural remains of the Maya of Central America are of less remote Atlantean origin, coming as they did fr om Antillia, the western and more lately submerged por tion of the Atlantean continent. But the question of Atlantean colonisations cannot so easily be settled as its protagonists and antagonis ts seem to think. Sufficient evidence, traditional and ethn ological, has been adduced to show that it is one which deman ds reasonable consideration. Surely such a mass of cor - roborative tradition could not exist without some b asis of actual fact, nor can it be disproved that the ra ces which entered Spain and France at the conclusion of the g reat Ice Age came from an Atlantic area. Plato's account seems to enshrine a very clear memory of the Azilia n or proto-Iberian invasion of Europe from an Atlantic c ountry. He writes about it, taking his facts from Egyptian sources, in much the same manner as a mediaeval historiograp her might have written—basing what he says entirely upo n a still older authority. He tells us that the Atlante ans already had possessions in Europe before the invasi on and the catastrophe, and the facts of archaeology s eem to bear out his testimony.

In other words, the Atlanteans were the first known navigators.\" 1 It must be clear that if Atlantis actually sunk abo ut 9600 B.C., as Plato's account would give us to unde rstand, all Atlantean colonial settlement on European soil must have ceased with that period, and if that be conced ed, we must regard all Atlantean expansion in the Medit er- ranean and other European areas as identified with Azilian or Iberian expansion. No anthropologist of experien ce will for a moment seek to gainsay the Iberian penet ration of the entire Mediterranean area from Spain to Egyp t, even though he may not support the nation of its At lantean provenance. But Sergi, the great originator of the theory that the Iberian race had made widespread settlemen ts in all parts of Europe, laid stress on the circumst ance that it emanated from Western Africa—that is, from the v ery region which is still known as the Atlas region, an d from that part of the dark continent whose people in Rom an times were still known as \"Atlanteans,\" and were so called by Diodorus. \"The idea,\" he says, \"has arisen that Western rather than Eastern Africa was the original home of these people, \"the ancient and modern Egyptians, Nubians, Abyssinians, Gallas, Somalis, Berbers, and Fulahs.\" He \"will not deny to the Sahara the possib ility of being the cradle\" of his Mediterranean race. His con- clusions regarding the North African genesis of the Iberians nowadays find tacit agreement among anthropologists . 1 I recently received a letter from a lady who knows North-West Africa well, in which she states that many traditio ns of Atlantis are still to be found among the native population.

It is much more reas on- able to infer such a process of steady racial progr ession than to assume the arrival in, say, Egypt, of a gre at Atlantean fleet in pre-dynastic times as Le Plongco n does. But did Atlantis finally sink in 9600 B.C. or there abouts?

Have we any record of cultural influences entering Europe durin g the period in question? We seem to have one at least in the tradition of the origin of the Cabiri, the deities of a strange mystery cult of western origin. From the great mass of antique writings concerning the Cabiri the following material may be extracted. The Cabiri were twin deified brothers, later identified with the Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux. They are described by Dionysius of Halicarnassus as \"two youths armed with spears.\" Sanchoniathon, the Carthaginian write r, states that they were of Carthaginian or African or igin. The cult of the Cabiri, indeed, seems to have been brought from North-west Africa to Egypt and Greece, and it is definitely stated that it was \"delivered to the Egy ptian Osiris.\" The Cabiri are said by Sanchoniathon to ha ve been the inventors of boats, of the arts of hunting and fishing, of building and agriculture. They also inv ented the arts of writing and of medicine. In fact it see ms that the ancient myth of the Cabiri enshrines a tra dition of the invasion of the Mediterranean area by a civi lised race at a period when that region was as yet in a c ondition of barbarism. It certainly originated in North-west Africa.

There seems to be no other way of accounting for the appearance of a cult which could not have originated on African soil. It would seem, too, that Crete was penetrated by Atlantean civilization, that, indeed, the Atlantean culture was responsible for the beginnings of Minoan progre ss. The theory has been put forward that Plato's accoun t of Atlantis was, indeed, a mere reminiscence of the fa ll of the Minoan civilization of Crete. A writer in The T imes of February 14, 1909, stated that: \"The disappearan ce of the island corresponds to what archaeology tells us of the utter collapse of the empire of Knossos, follow ed by the replacement even of Cretan sailors by Phoenicia ns at Egyptian ports.\" It is, however, unlikely that a cultural collapse, which took place about 1,200 B.C., should have been magni fied only 600 years later by Egyptian priests into a cat aclysm which had occurred 9,000 years before! It is as if we were to place the fall of Constantinople away back in the Neolithic Age!

Civilization in Crete w as undoubtedly of very ancient introduction. Early Min oan civilisation dates, roughly, from about 3,400 B.C., and certain of its phases bear a strong resemblance to Plato's picture of life in Atlantis. The bull was its sacre d animal, as in Atlantis, and the great arena at Knossos was certainly used for bull-fights or sacrifices. The Cretans wer e largely of Iberian race, and had labyrinthine cave- temples like those of the Aurignacians of Spain and France.

The Minoan civilisation of Crete had almost certain ly a cultural descent from the Aurignacian, as illustrat ed in its wall-paintings, its Tanagran statuettes, which link up with those of Spain by way of the Balearic Islands, and its cult of the bull, the representation of which in it s palaces strikingly resembles the art of the early Aurignaci an painters. It was, then, probably, some venerable my th of a tauric deity dwelling in a labyrinthine cave, and anciently derived from Spain or from the common sou rce of Atlantis, which gave rise to the Cretan traditio n of the Labyrinth. This presupposes that the cave of Gortyn a was the true Cretan labyrinth connected with the my th of Theseus and the Minotaur. The idea that Egypt was a colony of Atlantis has no t met with great acceptance from many writers on the subject. It is a little difficult at first sight to recognise the justice of the claim. A work which insists upon the theory is the late Dr. Augustus Le Plongeon's Queen Moo an d the Egyptian Sphinx, which tells us how Moo, a princess of the Maya of Central America, fled to Egypt after the ca tas- trophe which ended in the submergence of Atlantis, and founded the Egyptian civilisation.

The evidence which appears most strongly in favour of the introduction of Atlantean influence into Egypt is connected with the cult of Osiris. That this worshi p was not indigenous to Egypt is obvious, but it is diffi cult to say at what era it was introduced into the Nile country . It is certainly found at Abydos during the First Dynasty, but certain Pyramid Texts prove that it had an even mor e archaic history in the land.

Four thousand y ears at least before the Christian era certain parts of it were in use in Egypt, and that these were even then associa ted with the cult and art of mummification is clear. As the ritual of mummification grew more intricate, the Book of t he Dead grew in importance, and it was believed that w ithout a knowledge of its texts no deceased person would b e pre- served to enter the abodes of bliss. There is little doubt, however, that many of the te xts in the Book of the Dead are of a more archaic chara cter than the First Dynasty.

The Book of the Dead was almost certainly a surviva l of a Neolithic ritual for the preservation of the body i n order that it might live again. We know that the Aurignac ian people had such a conception of immortality residin g in the bones of the body. As Professor Macalister rema rks regarding their practices of painting the bones of the dead with red oxide: \" The remarkable rite of painting t he bones red should be especially noticed. . . . The purpose of the rite is perfectly clear. Red is the colour of livin g health. The dead man was to live again in his own body, of which the bones were the framework. To paint it with the colour of life was the nearest thing to mummificati on that the Palaeolithic people knew; it was an attempt to make the body again serviceable for its owner's use. In this connection it is instructive to recall a familiar i ncident in folk tales, in which the hero, having come to grief , the flesh of his body is restored from the bones, or even fro m a small splinter of bone, and then resuscitated.\" Mummification, indeed, is merely an elaboration of this practice, and it is plain that the Egyptian rite of mummi- fication with all its intricate ritual was develope d from the Aurignacian practice, which was its germ and seed. The Egyptians, like the Aurignacians, believed red to b e the colour of life. They painted the faces of their god s red, and daubed red paint on the cheeks of their mummies . In all probability the Aurignacian, that is the Atl antean, custom of painting the bones of the dead spread alo ng the coast of North Africa until it reached Egypt, w here in course of time it took on an appearance of great er refinement, so that no longer the bones but the bod y was painted in the hues of life.

The beginnings of mummification arc thus found amon g the Aurignacians of Spain and France, and its later stage among the people of the Canary Islands. If we cross the ocean to the Antilles, we find that the art of mumm ification had at one time flourished there. In Porto Rico the skull and bones of the dead were wrapped in cotton cloth or in baskets and preserved for worship. Again the skulls were frequently attached to false bodies made of cotton and were kept in a separate temple. The Caribs likewise made cotton images which contained human bones. Peter Martyr alludes to certain seams or idols made of co tton, and one of these, discovered in Santo Domingo, cons isted of a skull enclosed in a cotton covering and mounte d on a body stuffed with the same material. Artificial eye s had been inserted in the eye-sockets and cotton bandage s tied round the legs and arms. In Haiti it was the practi ce, before interring the body, to bind it with bandages of woven cloth and to place it in a grave with symbols and amulets. Las Casas and Columbus both mention that t he Indians of Haiti made statues of wood in which they placed the bones of relatives, giving the statues t he names of the people to whom the bones belonged. One myth of the Haitian Indians told how a certain idol, Faragu vaol, was, like the mummified Osiris, discovered in the t runk of a tree. When wrapped in cotton he was able to es cape from it as the Egyptian ba or soul could escape fro m its mummy-swathings. Mr. J. H. Fewkes, who has investigated the native c us- toms of the Antilles, remarks that: \"The dead were some-"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Atlantean Culture Complex 221 times wrapped in cotton cloth, and cotton puppets o r effigies of stuffed cotton cloth in which the bones of the dead were wrapped are mentioned in early writings. One of the best of these is figured in an article by th e author in his pamphlet on zemis from Santo Domingo. . . . The figure, which was found, according to Dr. Cronau, i n a cave in the neighbourhood of Maniel, west of the ca pital, measures 75 centimetres in height. According to the same author the head of this specimen was a skull with a rtificial eyes and covered with woven cotton. About the upper arms and thighs are found woven fabrics, probably o f cotton, following a custom to which attention has b een already called. There is a representation of bands over the forehead.\" Here we see a distinct reminiscence of mummy bandaging, and a great gap in the abdomen of the figure conclusively shows that the intention of the maker was to represent an eviscerated corpse. If now we proceed further westward to the mainland of America we find abundant evidence of the practic e of embalming the dead. This is, of course, more appare nt in the highly civilised centres such as Mexico, Cen tral America and Peru. The method of embalming the body differed in these several regions. In Mexico it was placed in a sedentary position inside a mummy-bundl e, which was covered with embroidery, feathers and sym bols. Over this was placed a network of rope, and on the top was placed a false head or mask, which provides a link with the practice of the Antilles. In Central America the bo dy after embalment was disposed in a recumbent attitud e and swathed round with bandages, almost as in Egypt. Th e pictures in the Mexican and Maya native manuscripts provide many representations of mummies. The Maya of Central America buried the bodies of kings and p riests in elaborate sarcophagi of stone, accompanying them with canopic vessels similar to those employed in Egypti an funer-"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"222 The History of Atlantis ary practice, and covered by lids representing the genii of the four parts of the compass, as was also the case in Egypt. Like the Egyptians, too, the Maya associated certai n colours with the principal bodily organs and with t he cardinal points. In some cases colours and organs affected agree both as regards their Maya and Egypt ian examples. We also find the dog regarded as the guid e of the dead both in Egypt and Mexico. When a Mexica n chieftain died a dog was slain, which was supposed to pre- cede him to the other world, precisely as the dog A nubis did in the case of the dead Egyptian. A further str iking similarity between Mexican and Egyptian funerary pr ac- tice is the presence in Mexican manuscripts of the tat symbol in association with the mummy, the emblem which was believed to provide the dead with a new b ack- bone on resurrection. This tat symbol, it may be sa id in passing, bears a strong resemblance to certain o f the Azilian symbols found on painted pebbles and in cav es in France and Spain. Certain Mexican gods were actually developed from t he idea of the mummy. One of them, Tlauizcalpan-tecutl i, the god of the planet Venus, is shown both in the C odex Borgia and the Codex Borbonicus as a mummy accom- panied by the small blue dog, the companion of the dead. On the recurrence of his festival a mock mummy-bund le was raised upon a mast, round which the celebrant p riests danced. Perhaps the most instructive picture among the Mexican manuscripts in relation to this subject is that in the Sahagun MS., in which Mexican priests are de - picted in the act of manufacturing the sham mummy, the mask, the paper ornaments and flags which accompani ed it. Almost equally interesting is the Relation de l as cere- monios y Ritos de Michoacan, quoted by Seler, which contain a number of striking pictures illustrating the proc ess of mummification in that region."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Atlantean Culture Complex 223 In Peru the art of mummification was widespread and the tombs of that country have furnished large numb ers of mummied bodies. The dead were wrapped in llama skins, on which the outline of the eyes and mouth w ere carefully marked. In many other parts of America mummification was practised, but as I have already dealt with the whole evidence for this at very great leng th elsewhere, it would be a work of supererogation to detail it in this place. 1 The second distinguishing element of the Atlantean culture-complex is the presence of witchcraft. It i s not intended to convey the impression that witchcraft i s not found in countries to which this culture-complex do es not penetrate, the intention being to show that whe re it is discovered in connection with the other elements of the complex Atlantean culture had penetrated. In fact i t seems probable that witchcraft, as a cult, original ed in Atlantis. It is indeed a fertility cult, origina ting in a very early worship of the bull as a symbol of anima l fertility, but what makes it of the greatest signif icance for the student of Atlantean Archaeology is the fact th at in its most striking aspects it is associated with tho se regions which were undoubtedly most affected by immigration from Atlantis—France, Spain and Mexico, and in the Aurignacian area of the two former countries. Its d istri- bution in fact is much the same as that of the earl y customs which later developed into mummification. That the Aurignacians practised it, we have the bes t evidence from their wall-paintings. In a rock-shelt er at Cogul, near Lerida, in Spain, a painting has been d is- covered which represents a number of women dressed in the traditional costume of witches, with peaked hats and skirts descending from the waist, dancing round a male idol or priest, who is painted black—the \"bla ck 1 See Atlantis in America, pp. 99-121.

That the witch-cul t also flourished in Mexico before and after its inva sion by Cortes, is well-known. The Mexican witches, the ciuateteo, were supposed to wander through the air, to haunt cross-roads, to afflict children with paralys is, and to use as their weapons the elf-arrows, precisely a s did the witches of Europe. The witches' sabbath was ind eed quite as notorious an institution in ancient Mexico as in mediaeval Europe. The Mexican witch, like her Europ ean sister, carried a broom on which she rode through t he air, and was associated with the screech-owl. Indeed the queen of the witches, Tlazolteotl, is depicted as r iding on a broom and as wearing the witch's peaked hat. E lse- where she is seen standing beside a house accompani ed by an owl, the whole representing the witch's dwell ing, with medicinal herbs hanging from the eaves. The Mexican witches, too, like their European counterpa rts, smeared themselves with ointment which enabled them to fly through the air, and engaged in wild and las civious dances, precisely as did the adherents of the cult in Europe. Indeed the old Spanish friars who describe them call them witches. The connection between mummification and witch- craft is sufficiently clear, for the witches of Eur ope prized above all things a piece of Egyptian mummy-flesh as a vehicle for their magical operations, and the same practice was in vogue in America, where the hands and finger s of dead women were employed by the sorcerer for magical purposes. Moreover the Kwakiutl wizards of North-West America employed as a magical vehicle th e skin and flesh of a dead man dried and roasted befo re the fire, and rubbed and pounded together. This was then tied up in a piece of skin or cloth and squeez ed into a hollow human bone, which was buried in the ground"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":" P ERUVIAN M UMMY"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Atlantean Culture Complex 225 in a miniature coffin. The relationship between Eur opean and American witchcraft is thus sufficiently clear, nor does either system show any great degree of resembl ance to the sorcery cults of Asia, most of which arc ess entially male organisations. These similarities, when consid ered along with the geographical occurrence of the cult, appear much too significant to be ignored, especially when it is borne in mind that the ancient Aurignacian area was in later times one of the strongholds of witchcraft in Europe. It would seem, too, that we have the very best poss ible reasons for regarding witchcraft in Europe and Amer ica as an emanation from Atlantis. In the Greek mytholo gical tales of the Gardens of the Hcsperides and of the A mazons of Hesperia, we find memories of a well-marked fema le cult, just as we do in the traditions of the Guanch es of the Canary Islands, the last remnants of Atlantis. I have already summarized the traditional material co n- nected with the Amazons and their invasion of Atlan tis, from which it seems clear that they had a distinct associ- ation with witchcraft. They were, in short, a femal e cult of warlike tendencies and perhaps of cannibali stic leanings, like the more modern Amazons of Dahomey. It is significant, too, that we find the witches of Mexico behaving in precisely the same manner as the Amazon s of classical tradition. In fact at one period in Me xican history a large force of Amazons or women warriors dwelling in the Huaxtec region on the Eastern coast of Mexico invaded the Mexican valley. They sacrificed their prisoners of war, and it is noteworthy that t heir leader on that occasion was Tlazolteotl, the chief goddess of the witches. Their principal weapon, like that o f the Amazons, was the bow, and it is clear from Camargo' s account of their patron goddess that she came from the classical Gardens of the Hesperides. He says that s he \"dwelt in a very pleasant and delectable place, whe re are"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"226 The History of Atlantis many delightful fountains, brooks, and flower-garde ns, which are called Tamoanchan, or the Place where are the Flowers, the nine-fold enchained, the place of the fresh, cool winds.\" This passage obviously connects the Amazons of Hesperia with those of Mexico, and the c ir- cumstance that both were armed with the bow, and th e serpent-skin shield seems to clinch the matter. Witch cults were also to be found on the European a nd American islands which formed links in the chain be tween Atlantis and the respective mainlands. Among the Guanches of the Canary Islands was found a sect kno wn as the Effenecs, whose virgin priestesses, the Maga des, worshipped in stone circles. On the Barranco of Val eron the circle in which they celebrated their rites sti ll stands. Like the Mexicans, Aurignacians and Cretans, they engaged in symbolic dances and cast themselves into the ocean as a sacrifice to the waters which they belie ved would one day submerge their islands. Like the prie st- esses of the Mexican Tlazolteotl, too, it was their duty to baptise infants. Polyandry was in vogue among them, and it would seem that feminine rule obtained in th e island. In the Antilles it is a little difficult to disenta ngle the native elements of witchcraft from those of the cult of Ob eah, which is of African origin, but the distinct presen ce in these islands of priestesses of that cult shows tha t it must also have had a strong hold in that area. The presence of the pyramid is a further evidence o f the presence of the Atlantean complex. The evidence for this has already been referred to, and it is on ly necessary to say here that pyramids, either of a fully develo ped character or in an evolutionary form, are found clo sely associated with the other elements of the Atlantean cul- ture-complex in Europe, as in the Canary Islands (i n dolmen form), in the Antilles and in Mexico and Per u, as well as in the region of the Mound-builders in the Mississ-"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Atlantean Culture Complex 227 ippi country. But we arrive now at evidence of a still more remarkable character. The custom of flattening the head artificially is o ne so very peculiar that it cannot be regarded as having origi- nated in more than one distinct area, yet we find i t indubitably associated with the other elements of t he Atlantean complex, whilst we do not discover it in other parts of the world to which that complex did not pe ne- trate. Thus we discern it very clearly in the Aurig nacian figures depicted in the marvellous wall-painting at Alpera, among the natives of Biscay at the present day, in the Antilles, and among the Maya and Aztecs of Central America. This type of cranial distortion seems inde ed to have been a part of the specific culture which s pread along the Atlantic route from Biscay to Central Ame rica. Sir Daniel Wilson remarks that Dr. Foville, \"a dist ing- uished French physician at the head of the Asylum f or the Insane in the department of Seine-Inferieure and Ch aren- ton, has brought to light the remarkable fact that the practice of distorting the skull in infancy still p revails in France, by means of a peculiar head-dress and banda ges; and in his large work on the Anatomy of the nervous system he has engraved examples of such compressed heads, one of which might be mistaken for a Peruvia n sepulchral relic. The practice is probably one inhe rited from times of remote antiquity, and is found chiefl y to characterise certain districts. Normandy, Gascony, Limousin and Brittany arc specially noted for its p reval- ence, with some local variations as to its method a nd results.\" It is also well known that deformation of the cranium is to-day widely practised by the Basques, who occupy almost the same territory as did the Cro-Mag nons in Aurignacian times. This custom of head-distortion is also practised am ong the Indians of the Antilles, of whom Charlevoix s ays;"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"228 The History of Atlantis \"They flattened their heads by art, thus reducing t he size of their forehead, which pleased them greatly. To do this their mothers took care to hold them tightl y pressed between their hands or between two little b oards, which by degrees flattened the head, whereby the sk ull hardened in a moulded shape.\" Now it is a well-known fact that: head-flattening b y means of what is known as the cradle-board was, and is, still practised among several of the tribes of the American mainland. The Maya in especial applied pressure dur ing infancy to the forehead, as can be seen by the slop ing crania of the figures depicted in their statues and bas- reliefs, and the same holds good of several of the Indian peoples of the western coast of America. I cannot f ind traces of any practice of the kind in the Canary Is lands, and it is possible that it may have died out there, but it is not a little strange to discover a custom so pro nounced precisely in the line assumed for the dissemination of Atlantean culture both eastward and westward, a pra ctice which is by no means common in other parts of the w orld. It would seem, too, that the practice of tattooing the body must be associated with the Atlantean complex. The persistent custom of tattooing, still so preval ent among our seafaring and labouring classes, has been regarded by more than one antiquary as a relic of t hat remote past when, in all probability, the entire po pula- tion of the British islands was so decorated. That tattooing was considered by the Romans as a practic e peculiarly British is manifest from many classical passages, but especially in one from Claudian, who personifie s Brittania as a female whose head is crowned with th e skin of a \"Caledonian monster,\" and whose checks are hea vily marked With the imprints of the tattooing iron. Her odian, a Greek contemporary of Severus, is our authority f or the statement that the northern Britons, whom that gene ral"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Atlantean Culture Complex 229 encountered in his campaign, did not wear garments because they did not wish to conceal the tattoo des igns with which their bodies were covered. Ample proof is, indeed, forthcoming that the tribal name \"Britons\" signified the \"tattooed people.\" The Goidelic or Gaelic-speaking inhabitants of the Brit ish Isles called themselves \"Cruithne\" or \"Qrtanoi,\" \"t hose who tattoo themselves.\" This word, in the mouths of the Kymric-speaking sailors of Marseilles, who carr ied merchandise to and from Briton, became \"Brtanoi,\" a nd in those of the Greek merchants of that town, Breta noi, thus for ever associating our national designation with a foreign mispronunciation. To the Welsh, another Kym - ric-speaking people, Pictland was known as \"Priten, \" and at an early era there is proof that they gave t his name to the whole island, \"Ynys Prydain,\" or \"The Picts Island,\" that is \"The Island of the Tattooed People .\" That \"Cruithne\" or \"Qrtanoi\" signified \"Tattooed\" i s clear enough from another passage in Herodian, who says that the Northern Britons tattooed upon their skins the figures of animals. This notice of the practice is doubly valuable, as it was written at least a centu ry before the name of the Picts or tattooed people is mention ed in classical literature. It is upheld by a rendering o f the early Gaelic writer Duald MacFirbis, who says that \"Cruithneach (Pictus) is one who takes the cruths o r forms of beasts, birds and fishes on his visage, an d on his whole body.\" This evidence, it will be seen, is entirely apart f rom those older derivations which drew the name \"Pict\" from the Latin pictus, \"painted.\" But that the name Pict, in its native, and not in its Latin form, mea nt \"tattooed\" is certain.

Claudius's oft-quoted statement that the Picts were \"nee falso nomine Pictos,\" \"not wrongly called the Painted People,\" simply implies that he knew that they decorated their bodies with symbo ls, and was rather surprised to find their tribal name resemble the Latin word for a painted thing or person. \"Pict os\" says Rhys, \"was a Celtican word of the same etymolo gy and approximately of the same meaning as the Latin pictus. The Celticans applied it at an early date t o the Picts on account of their tattooing themselves, and the Picts accepted it.\" But that the word \"Scot\" also means \"tattooed\" is less generally known. Rhys believed it to come from a stem meaning 'cut,\" or \"tattooed,\" in which derivat ion he is upheld by Macbain. A passage in Isidore of Se ville explains \"Scot\" as \"a word implying one having a painted body, on which various figures have been dr awn by sharp iron and coloured stains.\" According to Mr . E. W. Nicholson, of the Bodleian, there seems to ha ve been little or no real difference between \"Scot\" an d \"Pict.\" \"There was probably no greater distinction between a 'Scot' and a \"Pict',\" he remarks, \"than b e- tween a Saxon and an Angle: both names mean the sam e thing, 'Tattooed.'\" Speaking of the Picts and Scots of Ireland, Professor Rhys remarked that \"all Irish hi story goes to show that they were closely kindred communi ties of Cruithne, and I take it that the names Cruithne and Scots may have been originally applicable to both a like.\" But evidence of the most interesting kind has prese rved traces of the manner in which our ancestors actuall y did tattoo themselves. There were Picts in France as we ll as in Britain and Ireland, the Pictavi of Poitiers and Poitou, whose custom of incising figures on their s kins is illustrated in their coinage. In a coin of the Unal li, who"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Atlantean Culture Complex 231 inhabited the Cotentin, a head is depicted as tatto oed with the design of a short sword, the hilt on the n eck and the point level with the nostrils. Mr. Nicholson dr ew attention to this as probably associated with the n ame Calgacns, that of the Caledonian chief who gave bat tle to the Romans at Mons Graupius, and which in its na tive form Calg, means \"sword.\" Calgacus, he thinks, may have been tattooed with the figure of a sword like the warrior represented on the coin in question. A coin of the Aulerci of Maine shows a face the che ek of which is tattooed with a circle of dots, within which is the figure of a cock—perhaps the earliest represent ation of that bird as the national emblem of Gaul. On a c oin of the Bodiocasses of Bayeux appears a face circled with tattoo dots, enclosing the latter A. Coins found in Jersey abound in similar figures representing tatto oed faces. Frequently the designs are astronomical, dep icting comets and other heavenly bodies. On one of the coi ns of the Continental Picts is a head, on the jaw of w hich a cross is incised, having a knob at each of its four ends. All these examples hail from the West of Gaul, and the tattoo designs they display are regarded by Nichols on as probably the distinguishing marks of a Goidelic or Gaelic-speaking population, and as distinguishing i t from the Kymric Celts, who do not appear to have ta ttooed themselves. It is known that these Pictish tribes, who were sca ttered over the area from North-West France to the Orkneys , were a sea-faring people of piratical tendencies. I t was such a tribe, the Veneti, whom Julius Cassar encoun tered in naval warfare off the Breton shores, and who wer e, he tells us, assisted by their kindred in Britain. The ir ships were so much larger and better found than the Roman galleys that it was only after the most desperate r esistance that he succeeded in overcoming them. The coasts of"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"232 The History of Atlantis North-Western France and Britain, from Cornwall to Caithness, swarmed with Cruithne or Britanni of sim ilar type, who existed on maritime trade with each other , on fishing, and, when these failed, on plunder. These tribes, in short, were the true begetters of Britis h maritime power, who, while Norman and Saxon were still unkno wn upon the sea, made voyages of hundreds of miles in vessels of considerable tonnage with sails of skin, and iron cables. May it not be that from these hardy seafarers of th e far past the maritime custom of tattooing has desce nded to the modern British seamen? It is noteworthy that the dress of the British sailor of Nelson's time, w ith its bonnet, deep collar and striped vest, is identical with the popular costume of the maritime districts of Britta ny, whose sailors and fishermen are notorious tattooers . We have, of course, no evidence for the continuance of the practice during the middle ages. But it should be b orne in mind that it was not then usual to record pictor ially the humbler orders of society, and it is manifest t hat, if the custom still lingers among certain classes, it must have behind it a venerable antiquity. So far as the origins of tattooing in Britain are c oncerned, it can almost certainly be traced to the ethnologic al associa- tion of its Celtic tribes with the Iberian race. Wi th the Iberians the Celts mingled freely in Spain, France and Britain. It is known that the Iberians were immedia tely of African origin, and the ancient Egyptians put it on record that the Iberian tribes of North Africa were addicted to tattooing their bodies. Whether tattooing origin ated in North Africa or not, it seems probable that the custom spread thence to Asia Minor, and later to India, fr om where it seems to have found its way to Polynesia. How- ever that may be, it certainly became established i n Britain at an early era, so strongly, indeed, as to become the dis-"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Atlantean Culture Complex 233 tinguishing mark of its native races, and to give i ts name even to the island itself. For us, of course, \"Iberian\" means \"Atlantean,\" and as tattooing in Europe certainly originated with th e Iber- ians of Africa, it seems obvious that it must have been of Atlantean provenance. This is borne out by the fact that the Indians of the Antilles tattooed themselve s in precisely the same manner as did the people of Brit ain and Gaul. The Guetares of Costa Rica also tattooed themselves with the figures of animals, and the May a of Central America employed tattooing as an honorific sign, as well as head-flattening. As we have seen, the ancient inhabitants of Spain a nd Gaul were tattooed. I can discover no record of the practice in the Canary Islands, but when we find th e cus- tom in vogue in three of the \"links\" of which Atlan tis is the missing one, it would seem as though the custom of tattooing must also have emanated from the sunken c onti- nent, and have been introduced east and west along with the other features of the complex. In Britain, in p articu- lar, did it seem to linger, as doubtless it would i n such an isolated area, and from that we may imply that othe r Atlantean imports flourished in our island until a relatively late era. Still another custom which is of more universal ado p- tion is to be found in connection with the Atlantea n complex. This is the couvade, that strange notion, which ordains that when a child is born the father should take to his bed and there remain for days or weeks after the mother has resumed her ordinary mode of life. Diodo rus Siculus assures us that it prevailed among the anci ent Corsicans, and Appolonius Rhodius says that it was practised by the Iberians of northern Spain. But we find it also among the Basques of Spain and France, that is almost in the old Aurignacian region, and among t he"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"234 The History of Atlantis Caribs of the West Indies as well as on the South American coast. It seems to have originated in the notion that there was a spiritual union between the father and the child, and that the latter would suffer wer e the sin- not nursed as well as the mother. It has been trace d in Europe to peoples of the Mediterranean race, that i s to those races who are most closely connected with the immigrant peoples of Atlantis. A symbolical usage, which in some manner binds to- gether the various parts of the Atlantean complex, was the belief in the thunder-stone and its strange propert ies. This symbol, as the elf-arrow, or in other forms, i s almost universal, and is regarded not only by primitive, b ut by many modern peoples as the source of tempests and s eismic and volcanic phenomena, whether as the bolt of Vulc an, the lance of the Carib, or the arrow of the Mexican and Egyptian deities. But in the Atlantean region it af fords yet another link between the witch and mummy cults of its peculiar culture-complex. In Mexico the planet Venus, the star of Quetzalcoatl, was regarded as th e thunder-stone, and this symbol in many American and West European localities was carefully wrapped in s wath- ings of cloth or hide precisely as the mummy is wra pped. It would seem, indeed, as if the original ideas ass ociated with it had been fostered in some seismic region, a nd in any case, as has been said, it links up the witch and m ummy cults with the notion of seismic instability. In so me of the western Irish isles tempests were precipitated by un- winding the flannel bandages in which such sacred stones were wrapped, and in Mexico the god Hura- kan, the hurricane, was t h e southern equivalent of the god Itzilacoliuhqui, who was merely the stone-k nife of sacrifice, Quetzalcoatl, in his form of the plan et Venus, wrapped up in mummy bandages.

It is difficult to believe that underlying these co nnections there is not some original symbolism having an appl ica- tion to seismic activity. Probably the thunder-ston e was regarded as the very germ and essence of the tempes t, the magical thing which caused ebullitions of natur e, winds, earthquakes or eruptions. In another of its forms it was undoubtedly regarded as an earth-shaking imp le- ment, by means of which the gods fashioned the cont ours of the earth. To wrap it in bandages, however, seem s to have been to render it temporarily quiescent, to ha ve made a \"mummy\" of it. So long as it was confined within its swathings it was symbolically \"dead\" and unable to function, but once these were unwound its spirit of des- truction was let loose. Archaeologists have discovered, in some parts of th e Antilles, a number of strange three-cornered stones , which appear to have a close relationship with the symbol. Their geographical distribution is confined to Port o Rico, and the eastern extremity of Santo Domingo, that is to that part of the archipelago which probably formed a par t of the almost vanished Antillia. These stones are usua lly carved in the shape of a mountain, beneath which th e head and legs of a buried Titan can be observed. Says Pr o- fessor Mason: \"The Antilles are all of volcanic ori gin, as the material of our stone implements plainly shows. \" He proceeds to say that their shape is highly sugge stive of the islands in question, and that they seem to r epresent mythological figures bearing the island on their ba cks. He points to the legend of Typheus, who was slain b y Jupiter and buried under Mount Etna, and concludes: \"A similar myth may have been devised in various pl aces to account for volcanic or mountainous phenomena.\""},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"236 The History of Atlantis They certainly agree with the Maya conception of th e Cosmos, which alludes to the earth as supported on the back of a great dragon or four-footed whale, and th ey appear to be associated with the myth of Atlas hims elf, the world-bearer connected with the story of Atlant is, and they are further reflected in the myth of Quetz al- coatl, who, in his central American form, is assure dly the dragon or serpent who dwelt in the sea. They certai nly seem to me to symbolise a deity, whose duty it was to uphold the earth, but who, like Atlas, occasionally felt the immensity of his burden and cast it from him, causi ng universal destruction and catastrophe. It would seem, too, that in these three-pointed sto nes we find a combination of the idea of Atlas and that of the world-shaping pick or hammer. Thus, in the thunder- stone symbol, it seems, the whole significance of t he Atlantean culture-complex finds a nucleus. To it mu st be referred, as to the hub of a wheel, the practice of mummi- fication, witchcraft, and the mysteries and art of build- ing in stone. The hammer of the thunder-god or crea - tive deity with which he carved and shaped the eart h was indeed identical with the implement by which the ea rly sculptor fashioned his work. Manibozho, the god of the Algonquin Indians, shaped the hills and valleys wit h his hammer, constructing great beaver dams and moles ac ross the lakes. His myth says that \"he carved the land a nd sea to his liking,\" precisely as Poseidon carved th e island of Atlantis into alternate zones of land and water. Posei- don was notoriously a god of earthquake as well as a marine deity, and it is a fair inference that he un dertook the task in question with the great primeval pick, a sharp flint beak set in a wooden haft, the mjolnir of Tho r, the hammer of Ptah, by which the operation of land-moul ding was undertaken in most mythologies. It would seem that this sacred pick or hammer must"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Atlantean Culture Complex 237 have become symbolic of Poseidon in the continent o f Atlantis. In all likelihood it would be kept wrappe d up in linen in his temple, just as the black stone of Jupiter was preserved at Pergamos, or the arrows of Uitzilopoch tli in the great temple-pyramid at Mexico. At the Kaaba at Mecca, the centre of the Mahommcdan world, a simila r stone is preserved wrapped up in silks, and we have seen that in the Irish islands its counterpart was swath ed in flannel and preserved in a separate house. The mythology of Mexico holds many allusions to a certain Huemac or \"Great Hand,\" who seems to be ide n- tical with Quetzalcoatl. This figure is also found in Maya mythology as Kab-ul, the \"Working Hand,\" a deification of the hand which wields the great pick or hammer, as is obvious in its representations in the native manuscripts. Quetzalcoatl was the skilled cr afts- man, the mason, who came from an Atlantic region. I n his Quiche form of Tohil he is represented by a fli nt stone. It seems then that we have here the culture hero fr om a marine locality symbolised by what appears to be th e central emblem of the Atlantean culture-complex. Qu et- zalcoatl is also the planet Venus, and this identif ication gives a double significance to the complex. This is by no means weakened, when we discover that this Great Hand is actually identified with Atlantis in mediae val legends, for the map of Bianco, which dates from 14 36, contains an island, the Italian name of which may b e translated \"the Hand of Satan.\" Formaleoni, an Ital ian writer, had observed the name, but did not apprecia te its significance until he chanced to stumble on a r eference to a similar name in an old Italian romance, which told how a great hand rose every day from the sea and ca rried off a number of the inhabitants into the ocean. The legend is undoubtedly associated with the idea of e arth- quake or cataclysm in a marine locality, and it seems"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"238 The History of Atlantis obvious that the Great Hand was the god of this Atl antic island, who took tribute of human lives by earthqua ke. The story appears to link up with that of the Minot aur, the bull-deity of Poseidon, who also took toll of h uman lives in Crete, and with the practice of the Canary Islands, whose priestesses, as we have seen, cast themselves into the sea to placate the god of Ocean, as well as wit h the myth of the Titans. In Plato's account of Atlantis practically all the details of the Atlantean complex may be discovered, and the same holds good of the myth of Quetzalcoatl. Not only do the mainlands of the two continents display the cleares t traces of the presence of this culture-complex, but their advanced island-groups are eloquent of its influence. I have attempted to show that nowhere else in the world ha s a culture-complex embracing these particular manifest a- tions been shown to exist. Doubtless in time it wil l be possible to trace many greater or less additions to this complex, but those already proven to have been asso ciated with it should suffice to make it plain that it did actually exist and that the great likelihood is that it eman ated from a now sunken region in the Atlantic.
