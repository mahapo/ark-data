[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" 1 From Mu To Thule And the Inner Earth A Journey Into the Theoretical Past Gerry Forster In this article, I ask the reader to accompany me upon an intriguing journey through the dimly-remembered, faintly-recorded archaic world of our ancient ancestors. We shall be guided by some of those great imaginative visionaries who tirelessly endeavoured to fill in some of the blanks pages of the legendary past history of this mysterious world of ours. Much of what had virtually faded away into pure myth has been steadily fleshed-out again down the centuries by Greek and Roman scholars like Plato, Herodatus and Tacitus; intrepid explorer-archaeologists like James Churchward, Percy H. Fawcett, and Heinrich Schliemann, and mystic-explorers like Nicholas Roerich and Theodore Illion. Theosophists and philosophers like Helena Blavatsky, W. Scott- Elliot and Rudolph Steiner, and even gifted seers like Edgar Cayce, have also played their part. Nor should we overlook the input of such authorities on Thule and the Aryan race as Julius Evola and Joscelyn Godwin, or researchers into hidden underground and inner earth empires such as Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Saint-Yves and even the Nazi historian, Miguel Serrano. Polar explorers like Sir George Wilkins, Fridjof Nansen and Richard E. Byrd also have their input to make on matters Borealic. Nor is the inspired fiction of famed writers Verne, Poe and Rice Burroughs overlooked for its useful contribution in fanning the flames of imagination that have revitalized this almost fogotten part of the world’s history. A great deal has been recorded and written about such great empires and nations as ancient Egypt, Greece, Troy, Rome, Assyria, Persia and even India, Tibet and China, but here I seek to remind the reader of the more esoteric and archaic empires of Mu, Atlantis, Osiria, Hyperborea, and Agharta. The ancient empires from which these later and better- known ones were originally born! Thus our partly-proven – partly-theoretical journey begins with the tropical paradise of ancient Mu and takes us via a tortuous route to the polar paradise of Hyperborean Thule, and thence to the Interior World which lies hidden just beyond! Let us then set forth on our travels through the mists of time with open minds and the readiness to acquire whatever wisdom and knowledge our individual minds are willing to accept as we go! "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 2 The Lost Continent Of Mu In 1868, Colonel James Churchward , who was then a serving officer in the British Army in India, befriended the high priest of an Indian temple, who showed him several sets of ancient, inscribed clay tablets which had lain concealed in the temple vaults for many centuries, unread and neglected by most of the temple priests down the ages. With the aid of his new-found friend, Churchward learned how to decipher the ancient Naacal tablet inscriptions. As Churchward translated them, and grasped vast fund of information they contained, he realized that he had stumbled upon the amazing history of a long-lost continent which had been the first great civilization on the Earth. They told of a huge civilization that had arisen, flourished and decayed long before any of those known to modern scholars! It was the great continent of Mu, the Motherland of all the races of the Earth! For long years, Churchward followed the trail of this mysterious new civilization to the far ends of the earth, piecing together the many parts of a vast jigsaw. Then, as he steadily acquired more and more pieces of information and carefully fitted them into place,.a marvellous picture began to form. A stunning picture of a vast, lost Pacific continent and its original inhabitants gradually came together. The final result of Churward’s immense labour was his amazing book: “The Lost Continent of Mu”. Sadly, after its first publication in 1926, Churchward’s book attracted a lot of ridicule and criticism from the archaeological scholars of his day, and very few of them took his findings and theories seriously. It was regarded more as wild fiction than a serious scientific study. But today fortunately, we live in a less narrow-minded society, and many such monumental works as Churchward’s are being taken considerably more seriously, as outmoded old dogmas are being overturned by the new findings of more enlightened scientific researchers. Of course, that isn’t to say that we need necessarily subscribe entirely to his idea of Mu being one huge mid-Pacific continent, since, like the idea of Atlantis being a huge mid-Atlantic continent, it can’t be supported by the findings of modern submarine exploration and geological investigation. However, from my own study of bathymetric maps and charts of the Pacific ocean floor, there does seem to be reasonable geological support for there having once been a number of large and long islands forming a series of ridges across the Pacific, which could have become submerged through tectonic activity into the ocean floor of the Pacific. It is known to be a highly unstable region, surrounded by the so-called “Ring of Fire” of volcanoes, and earthquake-prone regions where tectonic plates rub against each other, and the Pacific ocean-bed is dotted with chains of sea-mounts, many of which are volcanic, as well as deep cracks and rifts known as “trenches”. Also, churchward’s concept of underground “Gas-Chambers” collapsing or imploding in upon themselves after losing their supporting internal gas pressure sounds entirely feasible to me. It’s not unreasonable, therefore, to place a certain degree of credence in Churchward’s assertion that there has been a great amount of rising and sinking in such an unstable sea-bed, and that, in the fairly recent geological past, many of the current island-"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 chains could have stood much higher above sea-level, to form continuous mountainous ridges stretching across a good deal of the western half, if not two-thirds, of the Pacific. As mentioned, I’ve taken the trouble (as any reader should) to closely study the latest depictions of the Pacific Ocean bed as it would appear without water, and I find that there is certainly an entirely plausible case to made for the various island-chains having once actually been continuous, above-water ridges of dry land stretching for anything between a thousand miles to two thousand miles in length! The Midway and Hawaiian Island group in the North Pacific, that form the undersea Hawaiian Ridge, is a typical example of what I mean. They would have formed a connection to the Line Island Ridge via the Mid-Pacific Ridge , and thus down to other ridges of contiguous island-chains in the South Pacific. Following this line of thought, one can easily see how there could very well have been an interconnected or easily-reached group of land-ridges extending all the way from Japan and the East Indies , right across to Pitcairn Island , or even Easter Island , in the south, the Marquesas nearer the equator, and Hawaii itself in the north. Nor should we ignore the submerged South Eastern Pacific Plateau in this consideration, which runs almost north-north-east, toward the west coast of Central America, in the midst of which we find Easter Island. From there, it’s only a distance of under two thousand miles or so to the Peruvian coastline. This would have been a comfortable sail for such an empire of seafarers as the people of Mu must surely have been, according to Churchward’s theory! However, apart from this leaning of Churchward toward the need for a huge super-continent to occupy a good half the Pacific Ocean area, I personally find his general basic theory quite intriguing, especially since it fits in well with so many other strange anomalies regarding the origins and movements of various ancient peoples - including both the Atlanteans and the Naacal Ramans , besides the three principal races of humanity. Perhaps if Churchward had only had access to the knowledge we now possess of the geology and topography of the ocean floors, his “continent”-proposition would have been appropriately modified, and might have met with a far better reception than it did from the scholars of his day. However, having hopefully helped his premise become a little more realistic and feasible, I should now define some of the points of interest in his “Mu” concept. Why Did Churchward Search for Mu? As we saw previously, the whole thing was triggered off by the old high priest of the Indian college temple, which was obviously a remnant off-shoot of the Holy Brotherhood of the ancient Naacals. Had he not spoken about this amazing 50,000 years old civilization with its 64 million inhabitants to Churchward, Mu might well have completely disappeared from human memory long ago. Instead, having befriended Churchward, and found him to be a seeker after esoteric knowledge, the old high priest eventually allowed Churchward access to the precious tablets which had been loving preserved mostly intact for nearly fifty millennia. If it hadn’t been a time of great famine in India in 1868, and had Churchward not been assisting in famine relief (courtesy of the British Army), the two would never have met, and the story would never have come to light. Such are the curious twists of fortune"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 and circumstance which direct our destinies! As I said at the outset, once Churchward saw the ancient tablets, he was well and truly hooked, and “Mu” became the driving obsession of his life thereafter. He felt totally compelled to unearth the proof of this amazing story, or die in the attempt! For two full years, he studied with the old priest, learning how to decipher the bass-relief characters upon the clay tablets, that had been written either in Burma or actually in Mu itself by ancient Naacal priestly scholars. The tablets he studied were, in fact, only a few fragments of what had once been a vast collection , and these had been rescued from one of the old seven Rishi cities which were the centres of learning in the old Rama Empire in ancient India! After many months of intense study of the tablets (including having to repair many that had been broken in packing or transit) Churchward eventually began to crack the code. His efforts were justified when he discovered that they described in detail the creation of the Earth and of the appearance of Man - in the land of Mu ! When he realized the enormous significance of his discovery “In the elucidation of that eternal problem” (the origin of mankind and his races), Churchward set off to Burma, armed with introductory letters from the Indian priests, in the fond hope of finding more of the tablets. Sadly, he was rebuffed by the Buddhist priests there, who told him to go back to India and “Ask those thieves who stole them to show them to you!” Undaunted however, he decided to make a study of the writings of all the ancient civilizations of the old world, to compare them with the legends he had discovered about Mu from the clay tablets. And this he did, only to discover that they were all preceded by the Civilization of Mu. During his studies, he learned that the “Lost Continent” had extended from north of Hawaii southward as far as Fiji and Easter Island , “and was undoubtedly the original (earthly) habitat of man”. He learned that “this beautiful land of smiling plenty” had produced “ the people that colonized the Earth”, and that it had been “obliterated by terrific earthquakes and submersion 12,000 years ago, and had vanished in a vortex of fire and water”! Subsequently, he traced the same story to India, where colonists from Mu had settled: “ from India into Egypt; from Egypt to the temple of Sanai (Sinai?) , where Moses copied it; and from Moses to the faulty translations of Ezra, 800 years later. The plausibility of this will be apparent even to those who have not studied the subject carefully, when they see the close resemblance between the story of the creation as we know it and the tradition that originated in Mu”. Sadly, space will not permit me to recount here all that Churchward, aided by his priestly mentor, deciphered from the tablets. I can only suggest that the interested reader get the book for himself from the local public library, if he desires to see all Churchward’s rather bewilderingly detailed accounts and his profuse accompanying illustrations. I must confine myself to his general theory and the story he culled from the tablets. Sufficient be it to say that the first two tablets proved to be the key that unlocked the secrets of all the rest. Certainly, according to Churchward, the first tablets gave a creative story that is very similar indeed to that set forth in the Hebrew Book of Genesis , up to the making of man “after our own fashion , and let us endow him with powers to rule this earth” ."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 This rather jars against the Hebrew version with regard to the creation of Adam, as does the final creative verse, ”Then Narayana , the Seven Headed Intellect , the Creator of all things throughout the universe , created man, and placed within his body a living imperishable spirit, and man became like Narayana in intellectual power. Then was creation complete”. Since Churchward was allegedly a devout Christian, I can hardly conceive of him attempting to forge a fraudulent version and sell his own soul for the sake of notoriety! Unfortunately, this rather sinister-looking “Seven-Headed Intellect” (which is depicted in his book as a giant cobra with seven rather nasty-looking heads) sounds uncomfortably similar to the Seven-Headed “Beast” that comes out of the sea, in the Biblical Book of Revelation, even though that entity from Hell is depicted as a seven- headed leopard-like creature). There were seven creative commands , which indicated seven periods of time, but were not measured by any specific number of years, or “days” as in the Bible story of Creation. According to Churchward, the account simply stated that the creation took seven periods of time - not six days as in the Biblical legend. He goes on to add that legends of the Creation are prevalent among many peoples throughout the world, and in all instances he found much of the material identical. The only conclusion Churchward could draw was that they were all of a common origin , and had their genesis in Mu! Churchward then sets about proving the actual existence of Mu. Firstly via the Naacal tablets, then he mentions records written in Maya, Egypt and India, which recount the destruction of Mu: “when the earth’s crust was broken up by earthquakes and then sank into a fiery abyss. Then the waters of the Pacific rolled in over her, leaving only water where a mighty civilization had existed”. Secondly, he points out that there is ample confirmation of Mu in other ancient manuscripts, like the Hindu Ramanyana epic mentioned earlier, as told by Narraté, the high priest of the Rishi Temple at Ayhodya. At one point, mention is made of the Naacals ”coming to Burma from the land of their birth in the East ” - which is the direction of the Pacific. Mention is also made of Mu in the Troano Manuscript , an ancient Mayan book, written in Yucatan, and now in the British Museum. It refers to The Land of Mu using the same symbols as were found in Egypt, India and Burma. Yet another Mayan book as old as the Troano Manuscript - The Codex Cortesianus also mentions Mu as does a Tibetan book in Lhasa, and as also do scores of other ancient records from Egypt, Greece, Central America, Mexico and even the Anasazi cliff-inscriptions in the southern USA! Thirdly, there are many existing ruins on the South Sea islands, such as Easter Island, Mangiaia , Tonga , Ponape and the Marianas Islands , which seem to hark back to the time of Mu. Whilst at Uxmal, in Yucatan, there is an inscription upon an ancient ruined temple which commemorates “The Lands of The West, whence we came ” - and a pyramid south west of Mexico city was built, according to its inscriptions, in memory of the destruction of these “Lands of The West”. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 Fourthly, Churchward found that there was a universality of certain ancient symbols and customs which were to be found in various ancient lands such as Egypt, Burma, India, Japan, China, the South Sea Islands, Central and South America, as well as among the aboriginal tribes of North America. They were so identical that it seemed certain that they all came from only one source - Mu! Churchward’s Description of Mu. From all the diverse sources at his disposal, Chuchward was able to form a picture of his great Muvian “continent”. He described it as “a vast stretch of rolling country, extending from north of Hawaii, down towards the south. A line between Easter Island and the Fijis formed its southern boundary. It was over 5,000 miles from east to west, and over 3,000 miles from north to south. The continent consisted of three* areas of land, divided from each other by narrow channels or seas.” (*Which seems to fit in with my own suggestion of the land of Mu actually being a series of ridges, separated by stretches of ocean, rather than one complete and solid continental mass.) He then goes on to describe Mu as it was , according to the various records he had studied. It was beautiful tropical land with huge plains. Its plains and valleys were covered in rich grazing grass and cultivated fields, whilst the low rolling hill-lands were verdant with luxuriant growths of verdant tropical vegetation. “No mountains or mountain ranges stretched themselves through this earthly paradise to give an irregular, jagged, yet soft and graceful skyline. Mountains had not yet been forced up from the bowels of the earth.” Here I find myself more than a little perplexed, since Churchward has already spoken of the Pacific Islands as being part of this continent, and the South Sea Islands as already being extant! But let us continue to follow his idyllic description a little further: “The great rich land was intersected and watered by many broad, slow-running streams and rivers, which wound their sinuous ways in fantastic curves and bends around the wooded hills and through fertile plains. Luxuriant vegetation covered the whole land with a soft, pleasing, restful mantle of green. bright and fragrant flowers on tree and shrub added colour and finish to the landscape. Tall fronded palms fringed the ocean’s shores and lined the banks of the rivers for many miles inland...” He goes on in his prosy style to remark upon “feathery ferns” and “shallow lakes bejewelled with sacred lotus flowers in emerald green settings” and of “gaudy-winged butterflies” and “tiny humming-birds....glistening like living jewels in the rays of the sun”. However, he eventually waxes less poetic, and gets down to cases regarding the lifeforms of Mu He goes on to tell us that mighty mastodons and elephants roamed the primeval forests of Mu, and that the human population of the continent was 64,000,000 people. (or roughly the current population of the Philippines). There was a great network of broad, smooth roads running in all directions, laid with smooth stones, so perfectly matched that no grass could grow between them! (Shades of the masonry of the Mayans!) The population was made up of ten tribes or peoples , each distinct from the others, but all under one, single government. Could these have been different racial groups? If so how can we split the basic three into ten ? Five races are about as many as one can reasonably go, without getting into purely national groupings! However, these were apparently all of one nation. The only other meaning could be similar to that which"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 applied to the twelve tribes of Israel, but in what way were these Muians distinct from each other? Surely this must imply colour or racially physical differences? The Empire of The Sun. However, to move on. They evidently had an emperor who bore the title of “Ra Mu” and the term “Ra” also represented their common Deity , an unseen God, whose name. (like the Hebrews) they were not allowed to speak, except through a symbol. This symbol was “Ra The Sun” which represented the Deity’s attributes. As their High Priest as well as their Emperor , Ra Mu was the human representative of their Deity in all religious matters. However, everyone understood that Ra Mu was not to be worshipped , as he was only a figurehead - perhaps as Christ is a “figurehead” for Jahweh? The people of Mu were highly civilized and intellectual. “There was no savagery on the face of the earth, nor had there ever been”. They were completely united under the sole sovereignty of their motherland - Mu, “The Empire of The Sun” and its laws and regulations. Churchward goes on to mention that the white people were the dominant group on Mu, and in all probability, represented the priestly and patrician class of its population. “Besides these”, he goes on to say, rather enigmatically, that “there were people of other races - people with yellow , brown or black skins. They, however, did not dominate.” This he culled from the Lhasa Record, among many others. According to these ancient manuscripts, the Muvians were great navigators and sailed all over the world - much as the Atlanteans are purported to have done, being also a great maritime nation. They were also reputed to have been great builders , too; another thing they had in common with the Atlanteans ! (One is compelled to wonder whether these two groups, the Muvians and the Atlanteans were very closely related, or even simply “two sides of the same coin”, as it were!) The Lhasa Record also mentions that there were seven principal cities , which were the seats of religion, science and learning in Mu, scattered across the three lands (or ridges?), This relates very closely to the seven Rishi cities of the subsequent Rama Empire which ruled India , and must obviously have been the original paradigm for that powerful nation, who were said to have come from Mu. It’s interesting to contemplate the close similarity between “Ra Mu’ and “Rama”, and, of course, the connection of the Sun -god name, Ra, both in Mu and later in Egypt, needs little or no explanation! So it is evident that Mu must have had great colonial as well as commercial interests around much of the ancient world. In fact, the Lhasa and other records are reported to state, categorically, that Muvian colonies had been set up in all parts of the world. (I believe, as I’ve mentioned previously, that the Atlanteans themselves came from Mu to begin with, and were probably originally a colony of that nation until they seceded from this “Empire of The Sun”! Surely, there are just too many similarities and parallels between the two nations for it to have possibly been otherwise!) From what can be gleaned from these records and Churchward’s interpretation of events, it would seem that there were various exoduses of large groups of people of different races from Mu, during its long duration, and before its final destruction. As I have mentioned in another article, a large contingent of the black population are said to have left Mu to seek a new homeland for themselves in Africa , and it appears that they"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 travelled there by way of the then Amazonian Sea , which once filled the huge basin that is today the area occupied by the Amazon jungle. Apparently this must have been prior to the upthrusting of the Andes - an event that took place in the time of the forebears of the Mayans and Incas - as a canal led from the western coast of Peru into this inland sea, which was partly open to the Atlantic on its eastern side. This isn’t so unreasonable to accept, when one considers that Lake Titicaca , which is now 13,000 feet above sea-level has the remnants of a man-made canal-sea- way running out of its western side, which once connected directly into the Pacific - at sea-level ! The uplifting of the mountain chains was by no means confined to pre- human geological eras! No doubt there were many other exoduses of groups of people, who for one reason or another, elected to set up their own separate nations elsewhere on the earth, outside of the jurisdiction of the Empire of The Sun . There are always dissidents and malcontents in even the best-run countries, as well as people of a pioneering and independent spirit. It was probably such a group who settled in the northern part of America and became the forerunners of the Red Men . (I personally agree with Churchward, when he comments that too many scientists have vastly overrated the Bering Land Bridge and an alleged mass-migration of Mongoloids into America, via the Aleutians and Alaska! With him, I also believe that the indigenous natives of America were never Mongols!) The Destruction of Mu. The final destruction of Mu came with disastrous suddenness. Although there had been a danger-signal of sorts a couple of centuries earlier, in the southern region, when a great earthquake struck without warning, accompanied by volcanic outbursts (explosions of subterranean gas-chambers?) and huge tidal waves. The people eventually recovered from the shock and had rebuilt the ruined cities and resumed their trade. This time, however, it was the real thing . According to the ancient Troano Manuscript , the entire continent (or all three sectors of it) was suddenly shaken by mighty earthquakes, and “rolled and heaved like the ocean’s waves. The land trembled and shook like the leaves of a tree in a storm. Temples and palaces came crashing to the ground and monuments and statues were overturned. The cities became heaps of ruins....” It then goes on to recount how the land rose and fell, quivered and shook, and that “the fires of the underneath” * burst forth, piercing the clouds in roaring flames, three miles in diameter! (* No doubt Churchward’s much scorned “gas-chambers”. GF) Then follows a general description of the sheer living hell that Mu became, under a thick pall of black smoke, with enormous tidal waves rolling in across the plains, destroying everything before them. The agonized cries of the people filled the air as the red sun sank angrily below the dark horizon. “Mu, save us! ” During that hideous night, which was rent by huge lightning flashes and thunderous roarings, the doomed land sank into a great abyss of fire . “Flames shot up around and enveloped her”...... “Mu and sixty-four million people were sacrificed”!"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 “As Mu sank into the gulf of fire” , says Churchward, “another force claimed her - fifty millions of square miles of water . From all sides huge waves or walls of water came rolling in over her. They met where once was the centre of the land (or lands ?). Here they seethed and boiled. In this manner was the continent of Mu destroyed. For nearly 13,000 years, the destruction of this great civilization cast a heavy pall of darkness over the greater part of the earth....” Churchward then goes on to explain how, after the cataclysm, ridges and points of land here and there, remained protruding out of the water, and these were thus made into islands, which were very jagged and broken by the volcanic activity beneath them. All of them were covered by such people as had escaped the sinking of Mu, which was now a seething and steaming bed of muddy water all around them. The waters gradually settled and became calm and “rested as if satisfied by their grim work of destruction, and this is the Pacific Ocean. Was ever a name more ironically applied to anything on earth?” Descent Into Savagery. Then follows a woeful description of the pitiful plight of these survivors, who had been left destitute of all their shelter, clothing, tools -and, above all else – of food. It was amid this dreadful scene of steaming waters and clouds of drifting ash and smoke, that most of them perished, and those few who remained took their first step backward into the dark depths of savagery as they finally found themselves having to resort to cannibalism in order to survive! This was but the beginning of a deep descent into the lowest state of humanity, which was to remain a traditional way of life in the Pacific region for thousands of years to come. Cannibalism was still rife in many of the Pacific islands, even during my own lifetime in the early to mid-1900’s! The Legacy of Mu. However, although Mu herself was no more, her splendid civilization continued on for several generations in her colonies, before eventually fading away due to lack of cohesive central support from the vanished motherland. No doubt, we owe much of our modern civilization today, to that ancient Motherland in the Pacific Ocean, by way of the various great civilizations which she spawned first in Atlantis, then India, the Americas , China , Egypt , and finally, in Greece and Rome. It would seem that many of the inventions and skills that were common to the Muvians and Atlanteans, are now simply being re-discovered by modern man, who probably still has a great deal yet to re-learn - if indeed he is willing to also learn from the mistakes of the past, and thus avoid having to repeat them! Of course, Churchward had much more to say about Mu, but I think this potted version of his findings should be sufficient for the purposes of this particular thesis. However, one can’t help but pause and wonder what Churchward would have made of those gigantic, stepped underwater monuments of Yonaguni ! Now let us move on to consider other interesting speculations on the origins and history of our human species!"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 Lemuria. Lemuria was an alleged “lost continent” that supposedly lay between the east coast of Africa and the south west of India. It was so named by the English zoologist, Philip L. Sclater , as a possible home of the alleged “Missing Link” between humans and the anthropoid apes. It was believed that Africa and India had, at one time in the distant past, been linked to each other and to Madagascar and South East Asia. This was by some sort of “land-bridge”, a now-sunken isthmus which permitted the pro-simians (lemurs, bush- babies, pottos and lorises) to migrate freely between the two lands. ( Lemurs , it should be added, are a species of small, agile, arboreal mammals, somewhere between monkeys and squirrels, although they are actually closely related to the former and are officially classified as primates .) The Continent That Never Was? During the 1860’s, pro-Darwinian zoologists believed that such an isthmus or land-bridge could account for the strange isolation of the pro-simians in these widely- separated locations. Further scientific interest was aroused in the 1870’s when a German scientist, Ernst Haekel proposed that this same missing continent might also have been the true origin of humanity. Sadly, before the real truth of the situation had been discovered - that Africa and India had once been joined together, before splitting apart, and thus allowing India to move northward by continental drift - various leading occultists had seized upon this idea of Lemuria being the origin of the first men, and had developed some weird and wonderful ideas of how humans had developed. Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky , the famous psychic and occultist, who founded the Theosophical Society, claimed to have had contact through psychic means with the Brotherhood of Mahatmas (a group of ethereal beings who purported to run the world from their Tibetan headquarters), and that, among other amazing things, they had revealed the true emergence of life on the earth. Without going into the subject too deeply, she was told that there are seven “Root Races” of beings destined to occupy the earth, and that we present-day humans are the Fifth such Race. After us, there are still two more yet to come. Apparently, the Sixth will evolve out of us and go back to occupy Lemuria , then the Seventh and final Root Race will leave this planet altogether and start over again upon the planet Mercury ! (All I’ll say about that is “Good luck to them, and I hope they remember to take their fireproof underwear !”) To complicate matters even further, each Root Race is said to be composed of seven Sub-Races - the descendants of a Sub-Race of the Fourth Race (who were fully- human Atlanteans ) are alleged to be the Australian Aborigines, the Papuans and the Hottentots! According to the fanciful Madame Blavatsky, some Lemurians had four arms, whilst others had “eyes” in the backs of their heads which gave them “psychic vision”. These curious creatures also communicated by telepathy and could move mountains by sheer will-power alone - despite the fact that they possessed no regular brains, as we understand them! The whole thing sounds like such a farrago of utter nonsense that it’s hard to believe anyone could possibly subscribe to such a wild concept. And yet, strange as it may seem, she seems to have attracted quite a large following around the world!"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 Whilst I would dearly love to expand further upon this weird cult, I must keep this account on a fairly basic level, and say that Lemuria is supposed to have occupied nearly the entire Southern Hemisphere, extending from the foothills of the Himalayas almost to the shores of Antarctica, as well as up most of the central Atlantic! Madame Blavatsky died in 1891, and her successor, Annie Besant , continued her work and wrote extensively about Lemuria and its curious inhabitants, as also did another leading British theosophist, W. Scott-Elliot. He managed to fill out the Lemurian concept considerably with the help of the ethereal ‘Theosophic Masters’ in Tibet, and wrote a definitive book, “The Story of Atlantis and The Lost Lemuria” which was published in 1896, and illustrated with six world-maps which showed its stages of development, supplied by the Tibetan Mahatma Masters. I won’t even attempt to describe his work here, or that of Madame Blatavsky : “The Secret Doctrine” , which was published in 1888, and is still to be found by diligent seekers! Scott-Elliot’s fantastic book reads like super-science-fiction - which it probably is - but it certainly makes for entertaining reading! I can only recommend that readers find it for themselves, and make up their own minds! (The first few chapters should suffice to convince most readers!) On a slightly more modern note, still other new and fantastic details have been revealed. On May 22nd, 1932, a reporter named Edward Lanser , of the “Los Angeles Times”, claimed to have spied upon a settlement of Lemurians whom he discovered living on the slopes of Mount Shasta, in northern California! His attention had first been drawn to them whilst on board the night train from California to Oregon, when he noticed some strange coloured lights up on Mount Shasta as they passed by it. The conductor told Lanser that it was “Just them Lemurians holding some ceremony”. This intrigued him sufficiently to compel him to explore the mountain to find these strange beings, whom he’d been told were the last descendants of the first inhabitants of the earth! In the small town of Weed , close to the mountain, Lanser learned that the Lemurians held their ceremonies both in day-time and night-time, but no one had ever been able to penetrate the colony’s sacred precincts. However, there was one local “scientist” who had found out more about the Lemurians than anyone else, and constantly watched them from his private mountain-top observatory by means of a high-powered astronomical telescope. This was Professor Edgar Larkin, a local celebrity. He said he had observed a splendid temple in the midst of their secret hideout, carved out of marble and onyx, which rivalled even the great Mayan temples of Yucatan. The locals, athough scared of trespassing on the Lemurians’ obviously sacred territory, claimed that they seemed a friendly and peaceable community, who were simply endeavouring to live the same lifestyle as their forebears had, before their homeland sank under the ocean. In his newspaper articles, Lanser reported that the local villagers had often met the these Lemurians, and had described them as being “tall, barefoot, noble-looking men, with close - cropped hair and dressed in spotless white robes”. They were well liked in the village as they purchased large amounts of sulphur, salt and lard, paying handsomely for these goods with large nuggets of gold which they mined within Mount Shasta."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 Was it all a Hoax? The biggest mystery concerning this curious “Lemurian” community was how they had gone undetected for so long. Lanser explained this in his amazing account. He stated that they possessed the secret powers of the Tibetan Masters , which allowed them to surround their hamlet with an invisible protective boundary to keep out intruders. (Possibly some form of deflector beam) . He also stated that their knowledge of science was far greater than that of ordinary humans, and although they (or perhaps their ancestors?) had lived in America - which they called “Gustama” - for several hundreds of thousands of years , they still remembered their original homeland in the strange ceremonies which they held on the mountain’s slopes. However, those people who had hitherto set some credence in Lanser’s reports were sadly disappointed. Other investigators were totally unable to find any trace of the strange enclave and its equally strange occupants, who either existed only in Lanser’s mind, or were rendered invisible by their mentors in Tibet! As for the eminent Professor Larkin . He turned out to be a local dabbler in the occult, whose duties were simply to let visitors to his “observatory” study the stars through a comparatively small telescope. Perhaps luckily for him, he died years before Lanser’s article was published, so was spared the indignity of becoming a public laughing-stock! However, Mount Shasta had already figured large in occult debate well prior to Lanser’s entering the scene. One Frederick S. Oliver published an occult story in 1894, entitled “A Dweller On Two Planets”, using the pen-name of “Phylos The Tibetan” in which he, as the narrator, encounters one of the Masters ( a Chinese sage named Quong) on the same mountain, where a community of spiritual sages preserved all the ancient wisdom of their forefathers. He was accepted into their group, and they then took him, in his spirit-body, on a visit to the planet Venus . (Knowing the infernal conditions prevalent on Venus as we now do, he probably thought he was in Hell !) His mentors also taught him to recall all his previous incarnations - which included a life upon Atlantis. But Then Again... Despite these apparently “linked works of fiction” - one presumes that Lanser had read Oliver’s old book - perhaps one shouldn’t be overly hasty to dismiss the entire Lemurian concept as pure fantasy, either. Harking back to our previous mention of Scott- Elliot and his fanciful book, I find that there seems to be a fine golden thread of possible truth running through the generally weird material it contains. For example, he makes mention of beings from the early planet Venus (presumably prior to it being knocked out of its old orbit between Mars and Jupiter - as I have discussed elsewhere), who strangely enough, were called ”Lords of The Flame”, (and this , remember, was written long before Venus’ present semi-molten state was ever known to astronomers and cosmologists!). These Venusians had long ago already developed a highly-advanced civilization upon their planet, and they were able to teach the Lemurians how to attain immortality through repeated incarnations."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 (I should perhaps also mention that these same so-called Venusians could well have been the “Astridians” whom I have postulated as the small humanoid inhabitants of the “fifth planet”, which orbited where the asteroid-belt now lies (and which I now believe really was Venus ), in my first scenario for an alternative birth-planet to Mars of our human species.) Back to Atlantis! Later on in his book, Scott-Elliot mentions how the continent of Lemuria began to break up and sink into the ocean bed - apart, that is, from that single portion which extended into the North Atlantic. Two large adjacent pieces of this peninsula still remained after the rest of Lemuria had vanished, and these became the so-called “continent” of Atlantis. (However, we are not told how they reached into the central Atlantic from the Indian Ocean!) These became the home of the first sub-Race of the Fourth Root Race, known as the Atlanteans, who, according to the book, later became the forerunners of the Cro-Magnon white race that occupied Europe and Northern Asia! Next came the Tlavatlis , who occupied an Atlantean colony that is now called Mexico . The third sub-Race were the Toltecs, who brought Atlantis into its “Golden Age”, which lasted for 100,000 years! A Curious Twist Of Irony. Thus Scott-Elliot’s story takes a very interesting turn, and develops in a now- familiar fashion, relating the demise of the two joint islands which formed Atlantis, ending in the final sinking of the last remaining, smaller island, Poseidonis, in the year 9564 BC , and which is told of in Plato’s story! One ironic twist in this story concerns the larger portion of Atlantis, Daitya, which prior to its submergence, was occupied by another sub-race of Altanteans, who were sorcerers , and were called the Semites. Just before Daitya sank under the waves, a large group of these Semites moved into central Asia, where they then evolved into the Aryans , the Fifth “Root Race”, to which we now reportedly belong! One cannot help but wonder what Adolf Hitler’s reaction would have been, had he read this of this amazing “evolution” of his proposed “Aryan Master- Race” out of the Nazis’ so-called sub-human “ Untermenschen ” - the Hebrews! We can only assume that neither Hitler nor Himmler read Scott-Elliot’s intriguing book! More Support for Atlantis! Scott-Elliot also mentioned many of the achievements of the Atlanteans in his book, which tend to reinforce what I have already discovered about these amazing people. Apart from domesticating “leopard-like animals” (possibly South American jaguars, or perhaps African cheetahs ?) and developing the banana plant, they were also great alchemists and manufactured rare and precious metals in vast amounts. Their scientists invented gas -bombs (as well as atomic devices, as we saw earlier), and they also created aircraft which were propelled by the so-called “Vril” force ( much sought after by Hitler’s weapon-scientists during world War II, in their quest for new secret weapons). This “vril” force was mentally-directed energy that was first assumed to have originated in the fevered-mind of some Victorian Novelist, but now appears to have been an actual, mentally-produced power, akin to that same psychokinesis believed to have been used to raise huge blocks of masonry in ancient building works!"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 At any rate, as we have seen elsewhere, their aircraft were capable of vertical take- off and hovering, rather like jump-jets of today, and, if Scott-Elliot is to be believed, they could fly at a speed of around 100 mph, up to a thousand feet in altitude! (Although, given all their other remarkably advanced technological powers, I am somewhat surprised that the Atlanteans should have been so greatly inhibited in both speed and height with their aircraft!) Steiner’s Atlanteans. There was one other controversial writer on Lemuria and Atlantis, who also gives highly-detailed accounts of both continents. This was an Austrian ex-theosophist, named Rudolph Steiner . He broke away from the Theosophists in 1907, and formed his own separate cult, the Anthroposophical Society . His book, “Cosmic Memory: Atlantis and Lemuria”, was published in 1923, and is apparently still in print and available through Rudolph Steiner Publications, which also publishes other classics on Atlantis, such as those of Ignatius Donelly and Le Plongeon . Steiner’s view of Lemuria And Atlantis is alleged to stem from the “Akasha Chronicle” which is a spiritual record of the past, apparently available only to true psychic initiates. However, from all accounts, much of his concept has seemingly been culled from Madame Blavatsky’s original Theosophic writings. He describes the Lemurians as simple-minded, but possessed of enormous will-power which enabled them to raise and manipulate great weights, a faculty which they seemingly passed on to the Atlanteans. They also had souls, which their predecessors apparently didn’t have, and they had begun to develop some form of rudimentary speech. I’ll skip over their other biological and rather fantastic sexual and reproductive development, as this isn’t of any particular relevance to this study, and, to my mind, ruins an otherwise entertaining yarn! Steiner goes on to claim that both the Lemurians and Atlanteans did not possess the ability to reason, but that they had excellent memories, and were educated in such a fashion as to be able to hold (like a computer) a vast store of mental images and data in their minds, and thus (again in the manner of the modern computer) , they were able to solve problems by recalled precedents. However, new and unprecedented situations left them greatly bemused, since they simply “ did not compute ” ! They apparently also possessed certain “magical word” powers of command, which they could employ to heal the sick or tame wild animals. This, of course, smacks very much of Jesus Christ , and I think Steiner might have been attempting to endow these people with Godlike powers beyond their station! He, too, like Scott-Elliot (from whom he clearly also borrowed as freely as from Madame Blavatsky), spoke of the Atlantean Semites evolving into the Aryan race, and acquiring, along the way, the ability to reason and develop consciences, and to refine these qualities up to our modern, human standard. A Load of Nonsense, or a Grain of Truth? It would be very easy to toss out all of these concepts as the ramblings of tortured minds, and dismiss their authors as demented cranks and lunatics, but I suppose the same could be (and has been ) said of the world’s religions - especially of Christianity , since many of the world’s most sceptical people are of the white race, which largely chose"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 Christianity above the other major religions. However, when one thinks of the vast multitude of people in the world who are entirely convinced of the existence of supernatural beings, with powers and forces that supervene those of nature, one has to ponder whether we really know enough about such unseen spiritual and psychic powers to be able to rule it all out as impossible! I feel one must keep an open mind on this. Every day, we hear of amazing events and occurrences which seem to fly in the face of logic and common-sense. Things that simply cannot be explained by any rational means. Thus I believe that one needs to maintain an open mind about such things, and hope that one day, the real truth of such phenomena might be made clear to us. I certainly tend to believe personally that there is more to our universe and ourselves than we are currently aware of. Perhaps there is another dimension of mind and self which we have largely lost the ability to tap into - rather like that elusive “fifth dimension” of physics which plagued Albert Einstein ? Maybe this is what we call “ spirituality”? At the risk of sounding repetitive, I can only quote again those famous words of Shakespeare’s “Hamlet”: “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy!” What then, are we to believe regarding the lost continent of Lemuria , and all its totally outlandish Root-Races and so forth? Is it all just a lot of balderdash produced by warped minds and fobbed on to a gullible public for the notoriety and aggrandizement of people like Blavatsky and her followers and imitators, such as Scott-Elliot, Steiner, etc? Or might there be a grain of truth in it all? Conclusions on Lemuria. Certainly, the famous occultists seem to comfortably accept that there was a large continent where Lemuria is purported to have been, and many ancient maps of the world showed a large continent in the Southern Hemisphere, long before the Theosophists got hold of the notion. This was the famous “Terra Australis Incognita” (Unknown Southern Land) which the geographers of bygone times believed to exist in order to “balance up” the globe. Many students think this was Australia, but alas, according to Captain James Cook , Australia, although as large as the USA, just wasn’t big enough to fill the bill, and he could find no other continent that did. Ironically, Cook sailed right around the Antarctic ice-shelf without realizing it concealed a gigantic land-mass! (Although, in my humble opinion, had he actually discovered it, the Antarctic continent might well have proved to be precisely the Terra Australis Incognita he was looking for!) It’s also interesting to note that Lemuria was (and still is) frequently regarded as interchangeable with Mu , and we have read how Atlantis appears to have been considered to be an offshoot of Lemuria, so it does seem to have its place in the general scheme of things pertaining to “Lost Continents”. Even the famous clairvoyant-seer, Edgar Cayce, appears to have acknowledged Lemuria, but as “The Land of Mu” , rather than as any Indian Oceanic continent. He seems to have disagreed greatly with the Theosophic standpoint regarding Lemuria in all aspects, including their descriptions of the evolution of humans from jelly-like creatures! Though I must say that, in my opinion,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 there is really little to choose between either party, since they all drew their knowledge and information from occult, spiritual sources! Casting The Final Vote. I suppose that, if I had to make a casting-vote for or against the existence of such a vanished continent as Lemuria, I think I would have to vote against it ever having existed - at least in the form described by the Theosophists - and with the weird inhabitants it’s alleged to have had. Perhaps there was an isthmus or continent there once, which might conceivably linger in racial-memory, but if so, it was probably India itself, in its original situation as a separating portion of ancient Pangaea or Gondwanaland , when ocean-floor rifting and crustal-expansion of the planet began to separate the continents from each other. We really have no true idea if mankind had, or had not yet appeared upon this planet at that far-off epoch, whether by Divine Fiat or by colonization from Mars. Every new hypothesis that comes along seems to push back the antiquity of our species by more millions of years. So only a brash fool with the arrogant self-assuredness of a Darwin or a Wallace would be so presumptuous as to state categorically that we couldn’t have been around in those early days! Thus, sadly, however much I would have wished to have believed it otherwise, I have to confess that I believe that “ Lemuria” was simply another name for Mu! Hyperborea And Ultima Thule. Most of our quest for ancient civilizations has thus far been focused largely upon the Pacific region and the Southern Hemisphere. Now I think we should perhaps consider a couple of legendary lands which have been perpetuated in the folk-history of the Scandinavian and Germanic peoples, even though these legends owe some of their origins to the ancient Greeks and the Aryans of Central Asia. Two major mystic and magical lands spring to mind here; Hyperborea and Ultima Thule - which both feature greatly in Nordic mythology, besides having, from all accounts, actually existed somewhere within the Arctic regions of the world in ancient times! However, before we go in search of concrete evidence, let’s consider some of the legendary background for both of these places - which might well have been one and the same ! Hyperborea. the first mention we find of the Hyperboreans , is in the mythology of ancient Greece, before the time of Homer. However, Herodotus mentions them as being part of the legendary Theban epic, and being in some way connected with the cult of Apollo, the sun-god, and that their homeland was in a paradise-like country “beyond the North Wind”, which indicates a region that may now lie within the Arctic Circle, or certainly in the far North Atlantic! The Hyperborians according to this same source, were alleged to live for a thousand years, but they had a tradition that any who tired of such a long life could end it in a ritual suicide ceremony, whereby the person involved was decked with floral garlands and allowed to jump off a high pinnacle into the sea!"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 Other legends seem to indicate that it was “that happy land lying to the west, towards the setting sun”, The Garden of the Hesperides , where trees bore golden fruit; the Elysian Fields or even the Happy Isles ! Generally, it is believed to have been a veritable paradise on earth, and may have been an island lying somewhere between the Azores and Iceland , which, like Atlantis , sank beneath the waves after some great catastrophe. There are some scholars who directly connect the two, and claim that Hyperborea was , in fact, the lost continent of Atlantis ! My own view, after scanning some of the mythology surrounding Hyperborea and Thule, is that it’s possible that they could have been the same place. It really all depends upon how far back the original legends go. If they are traceable to the time of the establishment of the Egyptian nation, since they figure in the Theban epic, then it is possible that they go far back in time to the period prior to the last polar shift. In which case, much of the land that now lies within the Arctic Circle was then warm to temperate country, richly carpeted with grasslands and forests, and all of Nature’s bounty, both vegetable and animal. It’s even possible that we need look no farther than the British Isles , since these would have been well to the “far north-west” of both Egypt and Greece! (We have to avoid the pitfall of allowing our northern European or American concept of the “north- west” to cloud our geographic thinking!) However, at that distant point in time, both Britain and Ireland would have been the most north-westerly part of the European land- mass , since, because much of the world’s ocean water was locked up in ice, the English Channel and the North Sea were both dry land then. However, there seems to be a distinct hint in the legends that both Hyperborea and Ultima Thule were always islands , so perhaps this would tend to rule out Britain and Ireland. My first conclusion is that both were actually the same place , with Greenland as Ultima Thule and Iceland as Thule . Although they are connected geologically, under the ocean, Ultima Thule and Thule seem to be separated in mythology into two distinct islands, and, since the name “ Ultima” Thule implies “ furthest away” , then Thule must have been closer to Europe than it. The obvious candidate for Thule then, must be Iceland . According to Pytheas , a famous Greek navigator of the 4th century BC, Thule was a six-day sea-voyage north of Britain, though whether by sail or by oar-power isn’t stated, but it seems to set the location of Thule as modern Iceland . Common sense would then suggest that Ultima Thule had to be Greenland. However, what if both were once united in one unsubmerged land-mass - the continent of Hyperborea? The Arctic Homeland: Hyperborea. To discover more about the mythos surrounding Hyperborea , we must look to the works of various older authorities on such somewhat esoteric mysteries. Jean-Sylvain Bailly , 1736-1793), who was an astronomer and a mystic, comments that: ”It is a very remarkable thing that enlightenment appears to have come from the North, against the common prejudice that the earth was enlightened, as it was populated, from the South...” He then goes on to point out that, according to all the legends and ancient wisdom, “as humanity began to reconstitute itself after the Noahic Deluge, the purest stream of"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 civilization descended from Northern Asia into India, which to this day carries evidence of having the most ancient astronomical system on earth”. He continues on to point out that, in most of the ancient mythologies of the world, there appears to be a race-memory of a racial origin in the far North and a subsequent gradual migration southward. Another great scientific mind of the same era, the Comte de Buffon , placed the first civilizations in northern and central Asia , east of the Caspian Sea, but he seemed to be in general agreement with Bailly about a northern origin for mankind, rather than a Middle Eastern or Southern one. Rev. Dr. W.F. Warren, who was president of Boston University and belonged to several learned societies, revived the polar origin theory for mankind in a book published in 1885: “Paradise Found” , of which the thesis was “That the cradle of the human race...was situated at the North Pole, in a country submerged at the time of the Deluge.” His theory compared very well with all the relevant sciences and comparative mythology - especially that of Germany. Warren was a Christian and an avowed anti- Darwinist, and he utterly rejected the concept of man having evolved from the ape, through a period of primitive savagery. He believed that the earliest men were the noblest and the longest-lived , ”and it was only after the Deluge, that humanity began to take on the feeble lineaments of ourselves.” At least, in his work he reveals some amazing insight into what could have caused the Deluge, through God’s Hand, by pointing out that, after the survivors of the polar flood settled in their north Asian exile, “they found the skies (or heavens) tilted in respect to the way they had known them: the North Star was no longer overhead” , and he mentions that “they perfectly understood why this was so” .... ”but their rude descendants, unfavoured with the treasures of antediluvian science, and born only to a savage, nomadic life.... might easily have forgotten the explanation” - which was that, “instead of the human horizon, it was the earth that had shifted”! Here, at long last, we get the first oblique mention of a polar shift! Support from India. Bal Gangadhar Tilak (1856-1920), a renowned pioneer protagonist of Indian Independence at the turn of the century, was also a scholar in astronomy and Vedic antiquities, who among other feats, was able to place the oldest Indian Vedic civilization at around 4500 BC. Tilak was jailed by the British for his anti-British writings for several years, and this time he put to good use in studying the Veda scripts, in relation to known astronomical and geological events. He published his findings in a work: “The Arctic Home of The Vedas”, in 1903. In this he stated that, according to his readings of the Vedas, the original Arctic home of humanity was destroyed around 10,000 - 8,000 BC by the last Ice Age, and that from 8,000 - 3000 BC , was the Age of Wandering , before they Vedic people finally settled in India between 5,000 - 3000 BC. By then, he went on to add, they had already begun to forget their Arctic origins , and their traditions had begun to go rapidly downhill. As we have seen in earlier accounts, his timing of this cataclysm fits in very closely with what we know of the destruction of Atlantis and Mu , so we can attribute it"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 to the same cause - a sudden polar shift, resulting in both tidal waves and tectonic upheavals followed by a very rapid relocation of the polar ice-caps: the so-called “Ice Age”. So, we have the destruction of Mu , dated very approximately at 12,000 years ago, that of Atlantis around 10-12,000 years ago, and, according to best estimates, the destruction of Hyperborea also at around the same time-frame of 10-12,000 years ago. Could this then, be also the time of the Biblical ”Flood” one wonders? As far as I’m able to determine by reading sundry authorities, this would seem to be the case. So it’s up to my readers to resolve for themselves whether this is a pure coincidental matter, or whether God chose to bring about the cleansing of an evil and disobedient world by means of a purely natural catastrophic event - which would seem to be a perfectly logical thing to do if One were the Supreme Intellect, who created the entire Universe along purely logical lines! Land of The Midnight Sun. Ancient Indian texts seem to point most clearly to the fact that the Arctic region was the “realm of the ancient gods” since they specifically mention that it is where the sun rises and sets only once a year - which demonstrates that the writers had a clear knowledge of the astronomical situation at the North Pole. Of course, they were quite right, since the sun only appears above the horizon for six months of the year, and is below it for the remaining six months! The question here is “ How did those ancient Indians know this?” The obvious answer is because it was recorded in the Vedic Hymns , which speak of “The Dawn of Many Days” and “The Thirty Dawn Sisters Circling Like A Wheel” . When applied to the Pole, these terms make good sense, since the sun takes exactly a month to actually appear above the horizon after the four -month night. I say four -month rather than six here, because the sun also takes a further month each year, to set . So, adopting for a moment the ancient world calendar of ten months, there’s a polar twilight of one month, followed by a night of four months. Then a dawn of one month, followed by a day of four months! The Vedas are thus correct in every detail regarding the polar night and day, even though written thousands of years ago! Obviously, these ancient forebears of the Indian people, the Aryans, knew this from first-hand experience! The oldest Vedic year had only two principal divisions, which were called devas and pitras ; names which correlated with the “Day of The Gods” and the “ Night of The Gods” . This, curiously enough, is very reminiscent of another dramatic piece of Germanic Aryan mythology - “Gottdammerung” - “ The Twilight of The Gods”- which is a strangely-apt connection with the Vedic-Aryan Polar Year! The Advent of The Big Freeze. We learn from the Zoroastrian scholar, H. S. Spencer’s “ Aryan Ecliptic Cycle” (1965) that the “Aryan ecliptic cycle” ran from approximately 25,500 BC to 300 BC, from their residence in the polar homeland during the “ Interglacial Age ” (or “ Inter Pole-Shifts Age ”, depending on one’s persuasion!), to their being compelled to leave it because of the presence firstly, of giant reptiles (dinosaurs!) , and then the advent of"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 intense cold and snow . (It’s important to bear in mind that the same effect would be taking place at the South Pole , also.) The Big Freeze occurred about 10-12,000 BC - and was just one of several natural cataclysms of that period which destroyed Atlantis , Lemuria (Mu) , and the Gobi Sea (now the Gobi Desert) – and also resulted in the flooding of the Mediterranean Basin, as well as creating the Triton Sea in North Africa ! From the now untenable Pole, the migrating Aryans had to fight their way south against not only the forces of nature, but also against the indigenous Asian tribes, including suffering a term of enslavement by the Turanians (the Turks). Religious Influences of the Aryans . However, by 8,500 BC they ruled their own empire in Bactria , where they continued to worship their god, Mazda, whom they had apparently held as their chief deity among several, for at least 19,000 years BC! It was Zoroaster (or Zarathustra ) who introduced Mazdan monotheism around 7100 BC. The Persian Aryans stayed true to their faith, but the Indian branch of the Aryans joined in the local polytheism, only changing over to Hinduism when they believed Zarathustra had been reincarnated as Krishna around 4000 BC. It is also interesting to note that (according to Spencer) the European Aryans accepted this same reincarnated spirit of Krishna (or Chrishna ) as Jesus Christ ! The religious influence of these Aryans was to have a great impact upon all the surrounding religions in promoting the supremacy of a Male concept of God over the Female , which had hitherto dominated Egypt , Babylon , Sumeria , and the Semites , who had all previously worshipped predominantly female maternal goddesses. Atlantis and Thule. As we have gleaned thus far from Plato’s Discourses, Atlantis was thought to have arisen in the middle of the Atlantic, opposite the Pillars of Hercules - The Straits of Gibraltar. And so it was always believed for centuries, until this was challenged in the 18th century by Olaf Rudbeck, who claimed the lost kingdom as having been his native land of Sweden! This started a new trend of thought among the scholars, and Bailly , (whom we met earlier) became convinced that Atlantis had been much further north than had hitherto been supposed, and suggested either Spitzbergen , Greenland or Nova Zemlya as possible sites. Rudbeck rationalized that, because the rotary movement of the planet close to the poles was so much less, the atmosphere might well have been less agitated, thus making it in reality a place of eternal spring . Through this idea, he identified his Altlanteans as actually being the legendary Hyperboreans , living in their golden “Garden of the Hesperides” close to the North Pole! A Place of Perpetual Spring near The Pole? Despite the original report by the Greek, Pytheas , around 300 BC, that he had reached a sea of ice just one day north of Thule - which he evidently thought was in fact, Iceland , he was disbelieved, and the myth still persisted that a warm polar sea existed around the Pole, with a very clement land environment surrounding it. Even Columbus"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 believed it and sailed 300 miles north beyond Iceland before reaching ice-bound waters. Most of his critics discredited this feat, as they believed the northern Atlantic to be impassable. (However, it was Columbus’ feat which caused later explorers to search those same northerly Arctic oceans for the legendary North West Passage into the Pacific!) However, I fear that I’m digressing! Atlantean Nazis? It was the Roman historian, Tacitus, who started the Germanic people believing that they were the descendants of these Atlantean-Hyperborean Aryans from the North Pole. He had already remarked that he could hardly believe people would choose to live in such a rigorous climate as that of Germany, let alone anywhere further north, but it was he who later agreed with those who believed the Germans to be a pure race , who had never intermarried with any other, and that this was shown by their distinct familial likeness, both physically and in character, even though they were a numerous race. They all had stern blue eyes, fair to ruddy hair and large, strong physiques. It was this Nordic Aryan , tall, blond image, projected by Tacitus, that was later to become the racial ideal of the Hitlerian Nazis - despite Hitler himself and many of his Nazi colleagues, being short and dark-haired , and typically Southern European in general appearance! This led to the concept of a Nazi Thule , the three god-fathers of which were Von List, Von Liebenfels , and Von Sebottendorff . All three were mere pretenders to grandeur and had added the nobly-suggestive “Von” to their plain family names. This in itself was a classical symptom of the “Master-Race” delusion, as they all firmly believed themselves to be of this chosen aristocratic Aryan race. I could pursue this Nazi-Aryan association and their Thule Society at great length, but, although it may of great significance in terms of racial distinction and discrimination - as witnessed by their subsequent anti-Semitism - it has relatively little to do with the actual racial origins of mankind as a whole. The Nazi attempt at world domination is now relegated to the political history of the world, which is not the province of this work. Readers wishing to learn more about the Nazi-Thule mythos should read Joscelyn Godwin’s absorbing book: “Arktos - The Polar Myth”. However, in that same book, Godwin does unearth many interesting points regarding the Boreal Race , whether they were Altlanteans or whatever. He says that two major and distinct streams issued forth from these people during their migrations, one from north to south, and the other, at a later time, from west to east. These Hyperboreans took with them the same spirit, bloodline and system of communication, symbolic, written or spoken, first to North America, and then to the Northern Eurasia. Tens of thousands of years later, a second wave of Hyperborean migrants appear “to have thrust as far south as Central America, and to have settled principally in a vanished land situated in the Atlantic region , founding there a centre in the image of the polar one”. (The emphasis is mine). “In this regard,” he continues, quoting Evola, ”one should properly speak of a “Nordic-Atlantic” race and civilization”."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 Decline and Fall. “In Evola’s view”, says Godwin, “the latter, Atlantean stream, became polluted with telluric (earthy) and demonic elements from the even more ancient Lemurians, (the Muvians) whose distant descendants survive in the dark races. From this blending came the cults of the Mother and of the Earth, which would forever remain in opposition to the original cult of the Sun, preserving the purer Nordic stream.” We have already seen how the Atlanteans were far more concerned with aggression and sorcery than those nations they tried to dominate, so they do not really deserve to be compared with the still-pure Nordic Aryans. However, as history shows, even the most pure and racially-clean nations eventually succumb to their own glory and go into moral decline. As, much later on, would also the Egyptians, the Greeks and the Romans. What Became of Hyperborea? One would imagine that after the Hyperborean region became a frozen waste of ice and snow that it would cease to feature in world mythology, except perhaps as a fondly-remembered homeland in the race-memory of the Aryans and perhaps the Atlanteans. However, this would be far from the case! As mentioned earlier, that first group of Hyperboreans who migrated to Atlantis were very much given to sorcery and conquest, whilst those who went to Asia, retained much of their pure character. Could this signify a division of the Hyperboreans into two moral factions ? Those who chose the Left-Hand Path and those who preferred to follow the Right? Perhaps this might account for the first contingent (the Atlanteans) leaving Thule so much earlier than those who became the Aryans. Obviously, if there was a gap of thousands of years between the two groups leaving the Pole, it seems to infer that perhaps the first group were expelled from their homeland by the rest of the inhabitants. Clearly, the second, Aryan group only left because of the ice cataclysm which overtook their homeland and did not initially seek anything other than a place to live in peace. This would seem to indicate that they were of quite a different and more peaceable nature to their Atlantean cousins. Maybe, in this expulsion of the first group from this “Garden of The Hesperides” we are seeing some sort of parallel to the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the “ Garden of Eden” ? Shambhala, Agartha, and “The Hole at The Pole”. That there was some further mystery related to the Boreal region, is indicated in the myth of Shambhala , which is supposed to have emanated from the early lamas of Tibet. It is thought to have been an ancient realm once located somewhere in Asia - possibly in the Gobi - when what is now an arid desert was still the Gobi Sea. It was thought to have been an island realm, called the “Sacred Island” which, in many respects, seems to have been strangely similar to Thule or Hyperborea. "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 The mystery deepens when we learn that its inhabitants were the last survivors of the “White Island” which had perished long ages earlier! According to Madame Blavatsky , the inhabitants were descended from her Lemurians , but, since this information was alleged to be from a Theosophist, spiritual origin, we might be wiser in concluding that they were more likely to have been from Hyperboria-Thule! Shambhala. From some of the accounts available, Shambhala appears to have been a centre of spiritual enlightenment, very reminiscent of James Hilton’s “Shangri-La” , but others say that it was a centre of occult power and arcane teaching. Its leader was thought variously to be either an evil, tyrannical Sorcerer-King or a God-like “Lord of The World”. We seem to be left with a choice as to which story we prefer to follow, and evidently which Path one desires to follow, too. The evil Left , or the good Right ! Apparently there were two factions (as in Hyperborea) , one of which followed the Golden Sun , and the other the Black Sun . (The “Black Sun”, incidentally, was as prominent an emblem of the Nazi mythos as was the Swastika !) According to Jean- Claude Frére , author of “Nazisme et Sociétiés Secretès”, the people of Hyperborea, after migrating to the Gobi Desert over 6000 years ago, founded a new centre, which they named Agartha. It became a great centre of world learning, and people flocked there from all over the world to enjoy its culture and civilization. However, a huge catastrophe supervened, and the earth’s surface was devastated, but the realm of Agartha somehow survived, under the earth. The legend continues to relate that, as with the original Hyperboreans, the Aryans now split into two factions: one group heading north-west, hoping to return to their lost Hyperborea, and the second going south, where they founded a new secret centre under the Himalayas. Jean-Claude Frére concludes: The sons of the Outer Intellegences split into two groups, one following the “Right Hand Path” under the “Wheel of The Golden Sun”, the other the “Left Hand Path” under the “Wheel of the Black Sun”. The first preserved the centre of Agartha, that undefined place of contemplation, of the Good, and of the Vril force. The second supposedly created a new place of initiation at Shambhala, the city of violence in command of the elements and human masses, hastening the arrival of the “charnel-house of time.” The Aryan Swastika. In this connection of Right and Left Hand Paths, it’s interesting to note that the swastika , which is a true Aryan symbol and represents a “square wheel”, has a duality in its symbolism. The right-handed swastika represents the “Wheel of the Golden Sun” and the Right Hand path of Good, whereas the opposite applies to the left-handed swastika. Hitler chose the right-handed swastika as the emblem of his Nazi Party because it was the Aryan symbol of power and good fortune . The left-handed and far more appropriate one, he rejected fearing it might bring him evil and misfortune! That he was in error on both counts, is a matter of history!"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 Asgaard- Agartha. “Asgaard” in Norse mythology, is the Home of the Gods - rather like Olympus is to the Greeks, and strangely, a French student of Indian mythology, named Louis Jacolliot , tells us in one of his books on the subject, “Le Fils de Dieu” (“The Sons of God”), how local Brahmin priests in Villenoor told him the story of a place called “Asgartha”. It was known as the “City of The Sun”, and was the ancient seat of Brahmatma. It appeared to date back to 13,000 BC, and Jacolliot claimed it was there long before the advent of the Aryans. He completely discredited the Aryans, saying that they were merely a break-away caste of Brahmins . In 10,000 BC, these “Aryan Brahmins” rebelled against their priestly masters and took over Asgartha, forging an alliance with the other priests, who under their leadership became a warrior caste , instead. Later, in 5,000 BC, two Norse brothers, Ioda and Skandah, who invaded Hindustan from the Himalaya region, finally destroyed Asgartha, before being driven away by the Brahmin warrior-priests. These two, continued northward, back to their homeland, the land of the Norsemen. Here they became immortalised as “Odin” and “Scandinavia”. The Norse remembered the story so well, that when they set off to pillage Rome, they cried: “We go to sack Asgaard , the City of The Sun!” Thus the legend of Agartha was born, and it continued to crop up in legends always connected with the Aryans, the Brahmahatma , and various mysterious Mahatmas - including those who communicated with Madame Blavatsky and her Theosophists! Beneath the Earth’s Surface! Eventually, another French mystic investigator, Saint-Yves d’Alveydre , in 1886 revealed in his book, “Mission of India”, that Agartha is a hidden land beneath the surface of the earth, ruled over by a black sovereign Pontiff, called the Brahmatma. He goes on to say that the realm was shifted underground around 3,200 BC, at the beginning of the Kali Yuga (or Golden Age) and that Agartha has known technology such as artificial lighting, mechanised transport, and even air-travel, far in advance of our own modern technology, for millennia! Periodically, Agartha sends emissaries to the upper world, about which it keeps astonishingly well informed. Agartha also has huge libraries which enshrine the whole wisdom of the ages, engraved in stone. Many great secrets lie there, regarding many esoteric and spiritual subjects, including amazing skills and abilities long-forgotten by those who dwell on the surface. Fiction, Fantasy or Fact? His book, which reads like pure science-fantasy, bears a great resemblance to Bulwer-Lytton’s book “The Coming Race”, which also tells of an underground world of high-tech beings possessed of that mysterious “Vril” force , so keenly sought by the Nazis in World War II, and who will one day emerge from their subterranean realm to take over the surface! Saint-Yves insists that such a day really is coming, and that we will be totally defenceless against these super-beings, who will become the true world- rulers. Nor is he the only one to insist that this is true! Many other authors, mystics and investigators have attempted to solve this whole mystery, with varying degrees of success or failure. However, most generally agree that Agharta and Shambhala seem"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 to be closely connected, either as being one and the same place, or as two totally opposed realms, one of light and goodness the other of darkness and evil. The Holes at the Poles. However, it is only comparatively recently that they have again captured public attention through the alleged NASA photographs of the so-called “Hole at the Pole”, which seem to lend some positive evidence to what had been suspected for centuries. Namely, that there has always been a hole or “portal” at either pole giving access to an inner Earth , somewhat akin to Rice-Burroughs famous “Pellucidar ”, but with a highly advanced people and technology, instead of the wild, prehistoric surroundings, savages and animals with which Burroughs furnished his subterranean world! Scholars have written about these polar holes for centuries, and it would take several pages to go through their theories and notions, so I will avoid retelling the many legends of these “ entrances to the underworld ”. Some suggested giant maelstroms, down which careless sailors could be swept,. Others spoke of them as the portals of Hell itself. Yet others went so far as to describe fantastic voyages, whereby sailors entered at one pole and emerged safely at the other, after sailing an internal ocean and seeing a whole new world within, lit by a central sun! Science-fiction is no new thing! However, to return to our subject. Let us consider some of the more modern views on this fascinating concept. Inversed Earth Cosmonogy In 1926, a young New England student, named Amadeo Giannini, had an “ epiphanous experience” during which he was taken upon an angelically-conducted tour of a land beyond the polar regions, and shown the great, magical secret of the earth. That instead of us being dwellers upon the outside shell of the globe, we are in fact, living inside it ! The stars of the interior sky are actually simply distorted visions of the underside of the heavenly sky, although the sun actually exists in the centre of the earth - though he does not present a coherent account of why (or how ) it sets at night, or rises in the morning. Giannini’s cosmology is, to say the least, unique , in that he is able to shift the inner earth’s shape to suit every difficulty he encounters. Sometimes it seems flat , and at others it is tire-shaped , like a doughnut ! Often his picture is of an infinite flattened disc with the earth surrounded by a polar-style ice barrier. Above, below and beyond all this disc-world the heavens extend into infinity. He even supported his wild fantasies with the discovery of land beyond the South Pole by Sir George Wilkin’s 1928 expedition, and also with Rear-Admiral Richard Byrd’s polar fights in 1947 . Then, later still, he alleged that the U.S. expedition of 1956 had flown over 2000 miles beyond the South Pole! Naturally, Giannini’s ideas were ridiculed, although he did attract a lot of keen attention from the “flying-saucer” fraternity. There have been several other claimants to “indisputable knowledge” of the existence of these polar holes, and some have even heard first-hand accounts of trips in flying-saucers into their depths! However, here we are entering into another realm"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 altogether, as there are those“UFOlogists” who believe that “flying-saucers” are not from outer space at all, but are actually “Vimana” craft sent from the Inner Earth, to keep watch upon our outer surface activities! But who can really say if this is true or not? The King of The World. Whilst this entire business of Shambala and/or Agharta might appear to be merely a fantasy, there are many who believe that they really exist, either as an underground realm, or as a lost city, hidden away somewhere in the Himalayas. It is also called “ Paradesa ”, the University of Esoteric Knowledge, and a large number of travellers and mystics claim to have visited the city over the past century, in search of spiritual and occult enlightenment. The leader of the Aghartans is claimed to be “The King Of The World”, the Metraton and the “High Lord of Agharta”, and, according to Ray Palmer and Richard Shaver (who wrote the “Shaver Mysteries” , published in “Amazing Stories” in the 1940s) , this “King Metraton” is said to be a Venusian , who came here thousands of years ago from the planet Venus (which was then orbiting between Mars and Jupiter) to instruct and guide our then dawn-age humanity. Despite his enormous age, he still appears as a youthful and very well-developed athletic man! However, despite this seemingly altruistic desire to help humanity, there are other accounts which say that Agartha is really a centre for evil occult forces bent upon our destruction, and Metraton is identified with Set , the Egyptian god of the Underworld and Evil, who is, in fact, none other than Satan . (The name “Satan” was originally derived from “Set.” ) It would seem curiously appropriate then that, if this were so, that this Satanic entity should hail from a planet which now so closely resembles the real Hell that Venus has now become! Also if this person were Satan, his incalculable age yet continuing youth would also be accounted for - just as would his title of “Prince of This World”, since Satan is thus styled by no less an authority than Jesus Christ , in the New Testament of the Christian Bible ! There is some additional support for this concept in the earlier comment that Venus was also referred to as Lucifer , The Morning Star. “Lucifer” is, of course, the original Archangelic name for Satan! The Switched Swastika? Thus we are faced with the possibility that the alleged Right-Hand Path / Left Hand Path positions as they relate to Agharta and Shambala , respectively, might well have been deliberately switched , and that the opposite may be the truth. This could also apply to the direction of “rotation” of the swastika, to right or left, since, when we compare a swastika with a spiral galaxy - with regard to its “arms” and direction of rotation - the swastika-emblem of the Nazis then becomes a left-handed one! The Aryan symbol of Evil and Misfortune! Oddly enough, and whilst we are discussing all these curious coincidences, it is worth remembering that Hell was always believed, even when I was a youngster, to be a huge underworld region deep inside our own earth! Modern Christian thinking has"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 since come up with the concept of a Planet Heaven and a Planet Hell , but perhaps the old beliefs might very well have had some reasonable foundation in fact, if such an evil inner realm of Agartha does actually exist? Nicholas Roerich. Before I close this section, I should perhaps make mention of Nicholas Roerich , who was a famous Russian explorer, artist and mystic, who traversed these mysterious regions during the 1920s and 30s in search of adventure and enlightenment. Roerich was particularly interested in the lost realm of Shambala, about which he later wrote a book, entitled simply enough “Shambhala” , published in 1930, along with “Himalayas: Abode of Light” and “Heart of Asia”, among others. At one time, Roerich had possession of a “magical stone from another world” which was known as the Chintamani Stone . According to David Hatcher Childress , it was purported in ancient Asian chronicles to have come from the Sirius star system, and is said it been given to Tazlavoo , the one-time Emperor of Atlantis , by an angelic messenger from the skies. Legend has it that this same stone was sent to King Solomon in Israel, from Tibet via a Vimana airship (one of which he was also believed to have personally owned!) The stone, which is said to have had magical properties, is believed to have been Moldavite, a magnetic meteoric stone which is sold in many crystal shops, and is thought to have fallen in a shower of meteors some 15 million years ago. (The great sacred black stone inside the Kabah at Mecca, which all Muslims venerate, is also a large fragment of meteorite, and could well be of the same Moldavite stone). Roerich wrote of Shambala in his book that: “Shambhala itself is the Holy Place, where the earthly world links with the higher states of consciousness...many speculations have been made about the location of the earthly Shambhala. Certain indications put this place in the extreme North, explaining that the rays of the Aurora Borealis are the rays of Shambhala... but this is incorrect. Shambhala is only north in relation to India , being perhaps on the Pamir , in Turkestan, or in the Central Gobi ...” He associates it with the underground city of “Agharti” and with the “White Island”, and that its “Splendid Valley” is reached via subterranean tunnels and passages from the Himalayas. He further adds that “the underground caverns of Central Asia are inhabited to this day by the people called the Agharti , or Chud, and that when the time of purification comes, say the legends, they will emerge in their glory”. The Religion of Shambala. If one can properly describe it as a religion, according to Roerich, that of Shambala is of Fire. He relates it to the old cults of Fire and Sun , and the Swastika is its emblem, found carved or painted everywhere. He definitively associates it with the Aryan Race . However, it was not only confined to Buddhist temples. He found it also connected to Bön-Po - a pre-Buddhist Black Faith “which reveres some mysterious gods of the Swastika.” He said that they drew the symbol counter-clockwise or left-handed - which, as we’ve seen, was the version chosen by the Nazis ! (There seems to be some confirmation here that “Bön-Po” was adopted by the Aghartis.)"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 Flying Saucers and Atomic Power. It was on August 5th, 1927, that Roerich and his party had a typical UFO sighting, 20 years before Kenneth Arnold saw his in 1947. “We saw, in a direction from north to south, something big and shiny reflecting the sun, like a huge oval moving at great speed. Crossing our camp, this thing changed in its direction from south to south west. And we saw how it dis-appeared in the intense blue sky. We even had time to take our field glasses and saw quite distinctly an oval form with a shiny surface, one side of which was brilliant from the sun.” “The King of the World” According to a lama who was travelling with Roerich’s group, this was a good omen “A very good sign.” he said . “We are protected. Rigden-Jyepo himself is looking after us!” He was referring to the prophesied “Lord of Shambala’s New Era” . The “Ruler of The World”, “Maitreya” , the “Last Avatar of the Kali Yuga”, who was to herald in a New Age - somewhat similar to the manner in which Christ is to bring in the new Millennium of Peace upon the earth. However, there is reference to an esoteric college of astrology, which was to be established in Urga (Ulan Bator, Mongolia) “as a centre from which comes the impulse for the imminent renewal of humanity, and to a Lord, King or Ruler of the World who is neither Christ nor Lucifer ”. Could this perhaps imply the “Beast 666” of St. John’s Revelation in the Christian Bible? It’s perhaps of some passing interest to note that, in the early-1980s, a full-page advertisement appeared in all of the world’s leading daily newspapers announcing the imminent revelation of the “Maitreya”, who, it promised, would appear to everyone in the world simultaneously, whether by direct sight or by television. I personally still have a copy of this advertisement somewhere in my files! (But, as I write this, almost twenty years later, he still hasn’t put in an appearance!) Vril Power Roerich’s wife, Helena, herself a mystic, wrote in her own book, ”Agni Yoga” about the Agni or Fire of Shambhala , and how it will be used in the New Age, describing it as “ the great eternal energy, this fine imponderable matter which is scattered everywhere and which is within our use at any moment”. Roerich himself said of this same power in the 1940s: “energies of cosmic fire will approach the earth and create many new conditions of life”. Joscelyn Godwin comments in his intriguing book , “Arktos, The Polar Myth” , “This could be a definition of Bulwer-Lytton’s Vril force .....if Nicholas Roerich, the indefatigable worker for world peace, had known the form in which Agni would be compelled to manifest in 1945, he might have been more cautious in recommending it...” It seems patently clear that this Agni fire , or “ Vril force” , (which appear to be the same thing) could only have been what we nowadays describe as atomic energy. So is it any great wonder then that the Nazis sought after it so eagerly during the Second World War? The repercussions of such a discovery upon Britain and America don’t require much imagination, especially with Nazi V2 rockets being already developed and available to deliver “Agni -Vril” atomic bombs upon London and New York!"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 Whence the “Hollow Earth” Theory, Anyhow? It was Sir Edmund Halley , the 17th century astronomer who discovered Halley’s Comet, who first suggested a hollow earth. His idea was that it comprised three concentric spheres, each of which supported life and that had at their centre a white-hot shining core. He ascribed the shifting of the earth’s magnetic poles to their movements one within another. This might sound rather a crackpot notion, until one considers that other reputable scientists have deduced that “polar wander” could be caused by slippage of the mesosphere within the lithosphere, or the slippage of the latter over the former, as hypothesized by eminent people like Wegener and Hapgood. A theological dabbler in science, Thomas Burnet , in his book “Sacred Theory of the Earth”, proposed that all the waters of the oceans came out of a hole at the North Pole, but only in accordance with Divine Will, as and when required for Deluges and suchlike Heaven-sent catastrophes, but not as a continuous, self-sustained process of replenishment of the seas. Alexander Colcott of Bristol subscribed somewhat to Burnet’s idea, in 1768, but he chose to posit a hollow sphere , with an inner surface covered by a vast ocean. In his view, the biblical Flood was caused when this ocean welled up to the outer surface through a polar gap or portal. However, none of these scientific thinkers envisaged a hollow earth that had fertile landmasses and a central sun , which could be the habitation of human and animal life. Nor did they conceive of any connection between holes at both ends of the earth. (Perhaps this was because the South Polar landmass still remained to be discovered.) The exposition of such possibilities was left, as I have mentioned earlier, to the writers of popular fantasy-fiction, from the 17th century to the present-day. Particularly writers of the so-called Romantic Era , like Edgar Allen Poe , with his great story, “The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym”, and Bulwer-Lytton’s “The Coming Race”, not to mention Jules Verne’s immortal classics: ”Voyage To The Centre Of The Earth” and “The Sphinx of the Ice”, John Uri Lloyd’s “Etidorhpa” and Willis Emerson’s “The Smoky God”. Plus, of course, the unrivalled Edgar Rice Burroughs series of adventure tales of “Pellucidar - The Earth’s Core”, mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. Conclusions. It’s tempting to continue delving into this fascinating concept of a hollow earth , but there are other intriguing areas yet to be covered, so I must reluctantly leave the subject at this point, and let my readers decide for themselves as to the likelihood or otherwise of such a possibility. However, let us keep reasonably open minds as to the existence of underground realms and cities such as Agharta and Shambala. Let us not forget that there are modern “underground realms” and “cities” today, in both the United States and Russia. Huge hollowed-out mountains, (such as the NORAD Defense Command headquarters in Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado Springs) which quite literally"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30 contain great technological cities inside them - and provide an ideal, natural protection against nuclear attack – especially for Top-Brass Military and Government VIPs! Future Explorations and Discoveries According to all the legends, myths and reports which abound today, and are constantly being substantiated by evidences of their actual existence, there are still a great many as-yet unexplored mysteries hidden beneath the Himalayas and the Andes, and other places - especially those beneath the Giza plateau which may, hopefully - if commonsense prevails - be unearthed and revealed within our present generation! We can only hope that the spirit of adventure and the quest for relics and evidences of such ancient fabled civilizations continues to be fostered among modern archaeological explorers as well as it was during the last two centuries. We can but hope that governments and business corporations continue to work together in a spirit of cooperation in sponsoring such investigations, as they have in the past. Alas, at the time I write, this spirit is sadly lacking in some areas. This is notably so with the Egyptian Department of Antiquities. They are currently rejecting proper scientific investigation of possible world-shaking secrets hidden under the Sphinx and inside the Great Pyramid. Whilst this obdurate refusal is their sovereign national right, we can but hope for a speedy resolution of this ridiculously petty, bureaucratic impasse! Surely such world-encompassing mysteries, possible clues to ancient technologies, and other great secrets that may lie awaiting discovery are of great interest to the whole world and might well benefit all mankind, rather than satisfy the bureaucratic veto-power of a minor Government department! Particularly that of a government whose national income depends so very heavily upon international interest in its antiquities from both scientific and tourist standpoints! However, I feel sure that there will be many more fantastic finds in the future that will tell us a great deal more about Humanity’s past than we know even today. All that is required is the willingness and dedication of those intrepid and daring scholars who are prepared to commit their lives - and even to risk them if need be - to searching out the secrets that still lie concealed upon - and within - the crust of our planet, as well as upon those other enigmatic and mysterious planets which are our close neighbours in space! Long live the spirit of “Indiana Jones” - and may there be many more great explorers and seekers after truth of such adventurous and learned ilk yet to follow! The End © Gerry Forster 2001"}]
