He acted as scientist, as occultist, as political dissi- dent and often as a simple damned eejit (just lik e you and me). Scientists, aware of his tr emendous contributions to space science , generally call him John Parsons, and they’ve even named a crater on the moon after him. Those occultists who know of his work in their very spe- cialized arts call him Jack P arsons, the name he himself pr eferred; in some magick lodges they consider him second only to Aleister Cr owley as a progenitor of the Ne w Aeon. His best-known book, Freedom Is A Two-Edged Swor d, which incr easingly influences the libertarian and anarchist movements, gives his name as John Whiteside P arsons on the cover and title page. And, as the present biography documents, this odd bird actually had the legal name Marv el Whiteside Parsons imposed on him at birth. Oh, well, if m y parents had named me “Marv el,” I w ould have changed my name, too, perhaps as often as Parsons did. For utmost scientific clarity about matter s usually left in m ystic murk or psychobabble, I shall use all four of Our Hero’s names: John Par sons for the scientist, John Whiteside P arsons for the libertarian philosopher, Jack Parsons for the occultist, and Marv el Parsons for the original template: an alienated and sometimes naive boy, a child of divorce, who tried to find and liberate what occultists call his True Self by creating the other three Parsonspersons and permitting them vii introduction 1.

Marvel Parsons, born in 1914 in Los Angeles but raised mostly in the nearb y to wn of P asadena, began life lik e all of us in what Tibetans call the V oid and the Chinese call wu-hsin (no mind). Gradually, out of the V oid, form emer ged. He made the distinction between Marvel and Ev erything Else; a glass w all then separ ated Marvel from Everything Else. He gradually identified various parts of Everything Else, as soon as he learned their names. Fatherless, Marvel had a conserv ative middle class mother who loved him a bit too ar dently (she committed suicide within a fe w hours after his death, 17 June 1952). She also taught him to hate his absent father, a pr oven “adulterer.” (Horrors!) Developing an early interest in psychology, Marvel diagnosed himself as having a classic Oedipus complex, a compulsiv e antipathy to “Patriarchy” (he used the word before the Feminists made it trendy) and an equally intense loathing for an y and all A uthority s ymbols, especially “God the Father.” But let us look at 19 14, the year of Parsons’ birth, more closely. Whatever you think of astrology, with its extraterrestrial bias, a “sec- ular horoscope” limited to Earthly portents always provides amusing insights. The terrestrial world that shaped Marvel Parsons looked like this: The First World War had started on July 28 that year; before 1914 ended the fir st aerial bombing of civilian populations occurr ed (Germany did it to F rance), and the bloody battles of the Marne , Tannerberg, Ghent and especially Ypres demonstrated that “civilized” modern humans could act even more inhumanely and insanely than any barbarians of the past. Police arr ested the legendary labor her o Joe Hill in Utah on January 13 for a murder he almost certainly did not commit, and the State executed him the follo wing year. His last w ords, “Don’t weep for me, boys—organize!” became a mantr a to union member s for decades after. viii sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"In Colorado, John D.

Novelist Upton Sinclair appear ed the ne xt day with a blank sign, telling reporters that free speech had died. Suffr agettes marched on Washington June 28, demanding equal rights for women. In England, Dubliners , the fir st book b y an Irish author named James Jo yce, appear ed; and in America Edgar Rice Burr oughs brought forth Tarzan of The Apes . Musically, we all acquir ed three major treasures, “The Colonel Boge y March,” “Saint Louis Blues” and “12th Str eet Rag.” In film, D.W .

Charles T aze R ussell, founder of the Jeho vah’s Witnesses , announced that the apocalypse w ould begin on October 2—coinci- dentally or synchronistically, the very day Marvel Whiteside Parsons [who w ould later , as Jack P arsons, call himself the AntiChrist] emerged from his mother’s womb, or from even darker places, and began to investigate and meddle with this planet. Going back to England again: also in 19 14, Aleister Cr owley (rhymes with “holy”) and his curr ent mistr ess, violinist Leila Waddell, staged something called “The Rites of Eleusis” in London—several nights of quasi-masonic ritual, music, poetry, bal- let and drama. On the first night, the actors informed the audience, Nietzsche-fashion, that “God is dead” and mourned and grie ved over the departed deity: things became even stranger after that, like the bardos in the Tibetan Book of the Dead , and on the last night the audience received “The Elixir of the Gods,” a wine containing a high dosage of the ps ychedelic drug mescaline .

Standing there as big as life And smiling with those eyes: “What they forgot to kill,” said Joe “Went on to organize.” Margaret Sanger and the suffr agettes also left a mark: no male writer since John Stuart Mill in the 19th Century has sho wn more empathy for Feminism than John Whiteside Parsons. “Saint Louis Blues” helped cr eate the Jazz A ge in which Marv el began to evolve from boy to man. And, like Russell and the Jehovah’s Witnesses, he grew up convinced that the w orld had entered a life- and-death battle between Cosmic (or at least Archetypal) Forces—but he enlisted on the side of the rebels, since he hated what we now call the logophallocentrism of “God the Father” even more than our cur- rent crop of Feminist theologians do. Although (as noted) he could see the Oedipal roots of this bias, he also perceived/conceived it as a decision for Light and Liberty against Tyranny and Superstition. Aleister Crowley and his New Aeon would later transform Marvel into Jack Parsons. I don’t know how Wrigley’s Doublemint gum fits into this list of terrestrial Signs and Omens surr ounding the genesis of Marv el Par sons. But I feel sure some student of Crowleyana will write to me and explain it after this book appears. Then another major influence mutated Marv el Parsons into John Par sons and John Whiteside P arsons and Jack Parsons: in his teens he discovered a despised and disr eputable genre of pulp liter ature confusingly known (at the time) as either science-fiction or science- fantasy. Seen from the present, the sci-fi crowd of that age look lik e closet surrealists who had re-invented the Novel Of Ideas and tailored it for magazines with names like Thrilling Wonder Tales . The uncer- tainty about what to call their product typified the age of accelerated change in which Parsons and this literature both matured: after Jules Verne’s “fantas y” submarine appear ed in the w orld’s r eal seas , x sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"nobody with more brain cells than a chimpanzee or a Fundamentalist felt totally secur e about the differ ences between the pr obable, the improbable and the totally impossible. If Verne’s submarine could become materialized, wh y not his rocket to the moon? The question excited a lot of other boys besides Marvel Parsons: but, unlike most of them, he did something about it. He became John Parsons, almost certainly (as this book documents) the one single individual who contributed the most to rocket science. Two of the institutions he helped or ganize, the Jet Pr opulsion Laboratory at Pasadena and the A erojet Corporation, still play large roles in space exploration. You will learn more about John Parsons’ acknowledged scientific achievements in the text to follow: I will concentrate on his other, still controversial labors. Just r emember that when he started building rockets they seemed as “wacko” to most people as an ything else he did. Yet his car eful scientific e xperiments and theories liber ated humanity from Terracentrism and showed us the path to a starry des- tiny. Rocket engineer John Parsons also became friendly with the lead- ing “fantasy” and “sci-fi” writer s in the Los Angeles/P asadena area and entered a subculture in which no idea seemed too cr azy to dis- cuss: a world where established science, fringe science, pseudo-sci- ence, philosophic speculation and visionary imagination all r an wild—in short, a world which anticipated and helped generate most of the “w eird and k ooky” ideas which ha ve now infiltrated every aspect of our cultur e, e xcept for the most r eactionary Stone A ge enclaves of Mississippi and the U.S. Congress.

Look at it this w ay: in John P arsons’ 193 0s–1940s sci-fantas y world, everybody he knew had already started discussing the possi- ble “humanity” and “human rights” of e xtraterrestrials and r obots; xi introduction"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"they created alternate societies much more rational and adventurous than most “normal” people of that time could possibly imagine; the y assumed (partly due to the influence of Alfred Korzybski and General Semantics) that information and technology would further accelerate their synergetic accelerations even faster than they had in the previ- ous century (Parsons’ friend, sci-fi-psi author A.E. van Vogt had stud- ied with K orzybski per sonally); the y cr eated Alternativ e W orlds where anything currently considered goofy—from new economic sys- tems to long-suppr essed Gnostic doctrines—might function as effi- ciently as the pencil sharpener. Robert Anson Heinlein, another friend of P arsons, wrote a novel, Waldo , in which all the arts of magick ha ve not only won scientific acceptance but have become technologies used daily b y everybody. Heinlein also wrote, a bit later, Stranger In A Strange Land , the first sci-fi novel to reach the New York Times bestseller list, and some still say Jack P arsons’ magick/libertarian ideas permeate e very page of it— pax , Mr. Carter! To leave the heady and trippy environment of chaps like van Vogt and Heinlein, and to encounter and endure the Official Reality of the U.S. of those days probably seemed to Parsons like time travel back to the Dark Ages. In that Official Reality, Christian piety and Capitalist predation co- existed as equally sacr ed Idols, even though the y totally contr adict each other. Stupidity, superstition and intoler ance imprisoned most Americans in medie val squalor, both mental and economic: man y humans did not ha ve the “humanity” or “human rights” that Par sons’ friends would grant to technically sophisticated robots (e.g. all those humans who had dark er complexions than Sno w White ranked as non or-sub-human in popular opinion and in law.

Almost all r ational or adv enturous ideas encounter ed blind bigotry and often violent per secution; contraception, divorce and abortion still remained illegal either locally or feder ally; homosexuality and bisexuality did not exist, or at least nobody in the major media could admit that they did exist; sex in general seemed so “dirty” that in the films of that time e ven married couples slept in separ ate beds, lest anyone suspect that the y might occasionally fuck each other; all of the other delights of lo ve enjoyed by most spouses r emained illegal with penalties r anging as high as 2 0 years imprisonment; r eligious nutcases similar to F alwell and R obertson not only peddled hatr ed and intolerance to a gullible public , but nobody dared to fight back xii sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"or even make cynical jokes about them; when the fir st scientific report on human sexuality appeared, its author, Dr. Alfred Kinsey, got hit with everything but flying monkey-shit—according to his research associate, Dr. Pomeroy, Kinsey literally died pr ematurely from the abuse he suffered. Of course, irrational fear and superstition still stalk this nation; but in those days, they totally dominated it. Par sons could only conclude that Americans, who claimed to love freedom, actually feared it, hated it and w anted to smother it with more and more tyrannical laws. They had willingly surrendered their liberty to “lying priests , conniving judges, blackmailing police” and other servitors of tyranny, as he wrote in 1946. But John Parsons, jet propulsion pioneer, had by then become Jack Par sons, se x-magician—after he disco vered and joined the Or do Templi Orientis. The Ordo Templi Orientis alleges that it descends directly from the 18th Century Illuminati of Ba varia. Let us look into that for a moment. WHO PUT THE LIGHT IN EN-LIGHT-ENMENT? “I need not add that fr eedom is a dangerous thing. But it is har dly pos- sible that we are all cowards.” —John Whiteside Parsons 2 Amid endless controversy about them, all agree that the Bavarian Illuminati began on May 1, 1776, in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, created by a Freemason (and former Jesuit) named A dam Weishaupt. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica , the Illuminati managed to influence many masonic lodges and gained “ a commanding position” in the movement of anti-r oyalist, anti-Papist and pr o-democratic “secular humanism.” They attracted such literary men as Goethe and Her der but the whole movement came to an end when the Bavarian govern- ment banned the Illuminati in 1785. So says the standard reference. Many conspiracy hunters have more faith in the decidedly par a- noid Memoirs Of Jacobinism of Abbe Augustin Barruel, who believed that the Illuminati mer ely regrouped under other fr ont names after xiii introduction 2.

Most F undamtalists think the y do, but other s with liv elier fantasies suspect them of unleashing Jazz, R ock ‘n’ R oll, communism, fascism, anar chism, Satanism, international banking, ritual child abuse , or some combi- nation thereof. According to masonic historian Albert G. Mack ey, the Illuminati at its peak had only 2000 members in masonic lodges in France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, S weden, P oland, Hungary , and Italy . Mack ey emphasizes that Bar on Knigge, one of the most po werful and activ e members of the Illuminati, remained a devout Christian all his life and would not have worked so hard for the or der if it r eally intended, as Abbe Barruel and others claim, the abolition of Christianity. A ne w Or der of the Illuminati appear ed in 1880, founded b y Freemasonic druggist Theodor Reuss in Munich. In 1896 R euss, and fellow occultists Leopold Engel and Franz Hartmann co-founded the Theosophical Society of Germany, and in 1901 Engel and Reuss pro- duced or for ged a charter giving them authority o ver the r e-estab- lished Illuminati of W eishaupt. In 190 1, R euss, Hartmann and metallurgist Karl Kellner founded the Ordo Templi Orientis and about 1912 Reuss conferred the 9th degree of the Ordo Templi Orientis upon Aleister Cr owley, claiming that Cr owley alr eady kne w the occult secret of that degr ee. (Cr owley—rhymes with holy , r emember?— already possessed the 33r d degree of the Scottish Rite and the 97th degree of the Order of Memphis and Mizraim.) Reuss later appointed Crowley his successor as Outer Head of the Ordo Templi Orientis. The Inner Head presumably remains invisible and unavailable to the un- Illuminated. (Hint: meditate on the Zen k oan, “What w onderful magician makes the grass green?”) Crowley includes A dam W eishaupt, the founder of the 18th Century Illuminati, among the Holy Saints in his Gnostic Catholic Mass, performed regularly in all Ordo Templi Orientis lodges. But that list of Holy Saints also includes also such odd blokes as King Arthur, Mohammed, P arsifal, Buddha, R abelais, P ope Ale xander Bor gia, Swinburne, Paracelsus, Sir Francis Bacon, John Dee, Goethe, Wagner, Nietzche, Simon Magus, King Ludwig II (“the mad king of Bavaria”) and painter Paul Gauguin . . .

I counted 1005 competing Outer Heads at one time in the mid-1980s , myself among them. (I had r eceived that honor from a group of rebels against Kenneth Grant, an embat- tled Outer Head in London, who still calls himself the only real Outer Head. I always carry the card Grant’s disloyal opposition sent me; it says “The Bear er of This Car d is a Genuine and A uthorized Outer Head of the Or do Templi Orientis, so PLEASE treat him right” and magically/anachronistically has the signature of Aleister Crowley—or of a skillful forger.) Over on this side of the pond, the feder al courts have ruled that the title of Ordo Templi Orientis belongs only and always to the guys and gals r epresented on the W orld Wide W eb and ha ve further granted it tax-exempt status as a charitable corporation and religious entity. This gr oup descends dir ectly from the 193 0s–1940s Agape Lodge of the OTO , the one that Jack Parsons once led. As we mentioned, Aleister Crowley became an initiate of the OTO in 1912. This happened because he had published a m ystic treatise and/or book of dirty jok es perversely or par adoxically entitled The Book Of Lies (F alsely So Called). The Outer Head at that time , Theodore Reuss came to Cr owley and said that, since he , Crowley, knew the secret of the 9th degree, he had to accept that r ank in the OTO and its attendant obligations. Crowley protested that he knew no such secret but Reuss showed him a cop y of The Book Of Lies and pointed to a chapter which r evealed the gr eat secret quite openly . Crowley looked at his own words and “It instantly flashed upon me. The entire symbolism not only of F ree Masonry but of man y other traditions blazed upon m y spiritual vision . . . I under stood that I held in m y hands the k ey to the futur e pr ogress of humanity .” 3 Crowley, of course, does not tell us which chapter contains the secret. You can spend man y happy hours, days, maybe even months or years, pouring over that cryptic volume seeking the right chapter and the final secret. We should remember at this point that e ven before his inv olve- ment with the OTO Aleister Crowley also received training, sometimes briefly and sometimes lasting much longer , in such tr aditions as Taoism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Sufism; and w e should note that he majored in organic chemistry at Cambridge Univ ersity.

Now it gets really scary for the Fundamentalists. SEX AND DRUGS AND ROCK AND ROLL “In these experiences the ego will be totally alter ed or completely destroyed in the death that must pr ecede a rebirth into life. The ter ror, agony and despair that accompany this process cannot be minimized.” —John Whiteside Parsons 4 Two recent books that shed some light on all these murky matters deserve some attention at this point— The Hiram Key and The Second Messiah. 5 The author s of both books , Knight and Lomas , both Freemasons themselves, claim that they have received “support and congratulations” from “hundreds” of other masons—athough the y admit that their research has been greeted with hostile silence by the United Gr and Lodge of England, one of the mor e conserv ative masonic bodies. Basically, Knight and Lomas try to pr ove that masonry not only dates back to ancient Egypt—as only the most R omantic masons have hitherto claimed—but that it also served as a major influence on “Jerusalem Christianity,” the earliest form of the Christian faith, which St. Paul and other se x-maniacs persecuted and drove under- ground. When the official Romish Christianity became dominant, pri- mordial or “Jerusalem” Christianity surviv ed b y hiding within various Gnostic “her esies,” Knight and Lomas sa y, and became a major force again only when rediscovered and accepted as their own secret inner doctrine b y the Knights T emplar. When the T emplars were condemned by the Inquisition (1308) the surivivors used vari- ous other names until emerging again as “Freemasons” in the 17th or 18th Centuries. Parts of this thesis ha ve appear ed in other books—the under- ground survival of primordial Christianity, for instance, underlies the entire argument of the famous Holy Blood, Holy Gr ail by Baigent, xvi sex and r ockets 4.

But what about the original Egyptian “mystery” out of which this underground tradition emerged? Do Knight and Lomas attempt to delve that far back and claim to find a convincing answ er? Indeed they do. The centr al masonic “m yth” of the wido w’s son, Hir am—the builder of Solomon’ s temple, murdered for r efusing to r eveal “the mason word” to three ruffians—derives from actual events in Egypt, they aver. The “mason word” does not mean a “w ord” in the usual sense but acts as coded euphemism indicating a secr et. (“Another damned secret?” I can hear you howl. Patience!) Every ne w phar aoh, befor e ascending the thr one, had to visit heaven and become accepted among the gods. Only after this other- worldly journey could the pharoah be accepted by the priests, and by himself , as one fit to fulfill the divine , as well as political, functions of kingship, as conceiv ed in those da ys. This voyage to the highest stars, where the gods live, involved a magick ritual employing what Knight and Lomas call a “nar cotic.” When the last phar aoh of the native dynasty refused to reveal the secrets of this ritual to the ne w Hyskos dynasty, they killed him in the manner of the wido w’s son. The lost “word” = the details of the Ritual of Illumination and the name of the “narcotic” used. It seems to me that Knight and Lomas have this last detail wrong, due to their ignor ance of ps ycho-pharmacology. Narcotics do not allow you to walk among the stars and communicate with superhu- man intelligences. They kill pain, they numb anxiety, they knock you unconscious; and the y usually get y ou addicted: that’ s all the y do. Almost certainly, the magick potion used in the ritual did not belong to the narcotic family but to the entheogens—the type of drugs also called psychedelics. Entheogens produce “mystic” and godly experi- ences, and at least one of them, and perhaps tw o, had widespread religious usage among the Indo-Eur opean peoples fr om ancient times, Amanita muscaria definitely and psilocybin possibly, both of them members of the “magic mushroom” group. You can easily find learned works supporting this interpretation of how humanity fir st became a ware of Higher Intelligences . See esp- cially Pujarich’ s The Sacr ed Mushr oom, Allegro’s The Sacr ed Mushroom and the Cr oss, Wasson’s Soma: Divine Mushr oom of Immortality, Wasson et al., Per sephone’s Quest: Entheogens and the Origins of Religion, LeBarre’s Ghost Dance: Origins of R eligion, Peter xvii introduction"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Lamborn Wilson’s Ploughing the Clouds: The Sear ch for Irish Soma, my own Sex, Drugs and Magick —and especially see T erence McKenna’s Food of the Gods , which argues that all e xisting religions evolved from paleolithic rituals using entheogens and gr oup sex to achieve ego-transcendence and cosmic consciousness . You can still see the ancient se xual symbolism even in such r omish ikons as the Sacred Heart and the Cr oss: the former does not look lik e a heart at all but like a tumescent vagina and the latter has the shape of a penis and testicles.

By the w ay, all o ver northern Eur ope traditional art sho ws the fairy-people and sor cerers surrounded by mushrooms, usually the “liberty cap” mushroom, now identified as psilocybin, the same used by Native American shamans for around 4000 years.

(“Little fairy” in modern Gaelic , but pook derives ultimately fr om bog , the Indo-European root for “god.”) Crowley spoke for this tradition when he said true religion always invokes Dionysus, Aphrodite and the Muses , which he also called “wine, women and song.” Nowadays we call this magick trinity Sex and Drugs and Rock ‘n’ Roll, and celebrate them at Raves that hauntingly resemble the earli- est stirrings of cosmic questing b y ancestors who dressed in animal skins and looked even more like gorillas than we do.

No Master.” —Margaret Sanger 13 As you have gathered by now, I do not regard Parsons and Crowley as Black Magicians or Satanists or an ything of that sort. Magick has many aspects, but primarily it acts as a dr amatized system of “psy- chology” (or neuro-linguistic meta-programming) to train us to break out of the cage of the socially conditioned ego and, b y plunging directly into the Chaos and Void from which we emerged, experience a rebirth into a new sense of self, of w orld, and of chaos and v oid, knowing directly, by experience, that all these names hide the same hidden unity—the wonderful magician who mak es the grass green, makes the sad man sad, mak es the angry woman angry, and makes the loving heart overflow with further love endlessly. Dr. John Lilly called this pr ocess “metaprogramming the human bio-computer”; Dr. Timothy Leary, conscious of his debts to both Crowley and Parsons, called it “serial r e-imprinting” of our “reality- tunnel.” As Terence McKenna often says in his lectures, you can do all this by yoga—but only if you can spare seven years of your life, or longer, sitting around an ashram meditating. Magick works faster, especially when united with the ancient shamanic ecstasies of full se xual release and the proper en-theo-gens. Crowley said, and Parsons liked to quote him on this, “ THERE IS NO GOD BUT MAN .” (That sounds “se xist” these days, but you all know what he meant. He also said “ EVERY MAN AND EVER Y WOMAN IS A STAR. ”) To confuse this with atheism seems to me as wildly off the mark as confusing it with “Satanism.” It quite simply means that all ideas/perceptions/experiences of the divine or the immortal r efer directly back to the latent powers of the mind that contains them. (In this context, see John 10:34.)

Parsons was from the Boston area, born cir ca 1894, the son of an egg mer chant. Marvel does not appear in the Boston city dir ectories for the y ears 1910 through 1913, so he was either living at home with his parents or he was from a small town just outside of Boston. When Marvel reached the age when men have to make a living for themselves, he realized there was no w ay he could do it selling eggs with his father . So Marvel decided to head west—to California, the land of sunshine and opportunity. Marvel arrived in Los Angeles in 19 13, a fact known because his name shows up in the 1914 city directory as residing at 2375 Scarrf, where he was a tenant. He w as employed by the English Motor Car Company of 1 132 S. Gr and Ave., which w as not an imported car dealer but named for its president, P.A. English. On a 1914 document, Marvel listed his occupation as “auto accessories,” so he was proba- bly employed in sales. Par sons met Ruth Virginia Whiteside when he arrived in California and married her soon after . Ruth was from Ohio, but w as born in Chicago, Illinois, in late 1893 or early 1894. Ruth had lived in several cities around the country and had also tr aveled to Europe with her parents on different occasions. I was unable to find her in any of the Los Angeles or Pasadena city directories prior to her marriage. Marvel and Ruth Parsons gave birth to a son on October 2, 1914 and named him Marvel Whiteside Parsons. He was their second child, the fir st having died at birth or in infanc y. The younger Marvel was born at Good Samaritan Hospital, 1225 Wilshir e Blv d., Los Angeles , California, at 8:45 p.m. The attending physician was Julian Coffey. About this time the senior Marv el did something that w as less common in 1914 than it is toda y. It was certainly less talk ed about then, and not condoned at all. Marv el had an affair with another woman. Ruth responded to his affair b y doing something equally shocking: she divorced her new husband. Marvel can be found in the 1915 Los Angeles city dir ectory, living alone at 2401 Romeo St., listed 1 The Early Years: 1914–1936"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"as owner of this home, where Ruth, listed as a house wife, and their son also lived for a while. Embittered by her ex-husband’s adulterous affair, Ruth began call- ing the bo y “John” r ather than “Marv el,” but she ne ver legally changed his name. As the boy grew, close friends and family w ould come to call him “Jack,” which is how he is often remembered today. Because of these name changes , it is possible to tell at a glance whether a biographical account of Parsons originates from the scien- tific community or the occult community, as the latter uniformly calls him “Jack.” Members of the scientific community call him “John,” which is how he will be referred to throughout this book. Curiously, Ruth Parsons kept her ex-husband’s surname for herself and the boy, for she is consistently r eferred to as Mrs. Ruth Parsons for the rest of her life. It may be that there was no legal divorce at all, as one of her son’ s later documents mak es reference to a “separ a- tion,” which ma y mean that his mother ma y have merely kicked Marvel out. In an ominous coincidence , Charles T aze R ussell, whose “Russellites” now call themselves the Jehovah’s Witnesses, predicted the end of the world would happen on October 2, 1914, the day of John Parsons’ birth, and just a couple months after the start of World War I. When Russell announced to his congr egation in Brooklyn, New York, that the end had begun, he meant the finale was not an instantaneous end to all things, but rather the beginning of the end as outlined in the Book of Revelation—the appearance of the Antichrist and the harlot, Babylon the Great, being two of the k ey events. It is ir onic that John Par sons, who would later attempt to incarnate Babylon and who would also sign an oath stating that he was the Antichrist, was born the very day of Russell’s eschatological event. Of his o wn birth, the m ystical Parsons wrote in Analysis By A Master of the Temple 34 years later, “I chose this constellation [Libra] in order that you might have an innate sense of balance and ultimate justice, responsive and attractive nature, a bountiful envir onment & sense of royalty and largesse, strength, courage & power combined with cunning and intelligence . Saturn [time] w as bound [i.e ., the planet was at aphelion] in order that you might not easily formulate a lower will which would have satisfied and overwhelmed you with its spectacular success.” Par sons’ mother, Ruth, first appears in the Pasadena city directory in 1916, shown as living with her par ents, Walter H. and Carrie Whiteside at 537 S.

After Marvel and Ruth separated, Ruth’s parents appar- ently made the big sacrifice and mo ved west to help car e for their daughter and grandson. Whatever occurrence or sentiment that had brought Ruth to California to begin with was evidently strong enough to make her want to stay. Rather than packing up and moving home after separating from Marvel, her home moved to her. South Orange Grove Avenue was known locally as “Millionair e’s Mile,” and the family’s presence here indicates Walter Whiteside was a successful man. Ruth’s obituary lists Walter’s occupation as presi- dent of both Ste vens Duryea and the Allis Chalmer s Manufacturing Company. Ruth and her par ents, along with y oung John, sta yed at 537 S. Orange Grove for a number of years. Ironically, John Parsons’ life would end 37 y ears later just blocks fr om the very place where he grew up, at 1071 S. Orange Grove. The path he took to get ther e was a very interesting one, as we shall see. John’s father, Marvel H. Parsons, drops out of sight after 1915 and does not appear in an y of the Los Angeles or P asadena city directo- ries again. We do kno w that he joined the arm y, and though it is thought that he did so after W orld War I ended in No vember 1918, the Department of V eterans Affair s has a r ecord of a Marv el H. Par sons who enlisted in August 1917, one year before the war ended. This is the only Marv el Parsons in the VA’s files. The army seems a natural refuge for a former salesman who had lost his wife , his son, and possibly his home. John P arsons’ FBI files r efer to his father as a captain (i.e ., “Captain Marvel”), and one of the ne wspaper articles written at the time of John’s death refer to his father as a major . It has been said that Marvel worked for Woodrow Wilson (President, 1913–1921) or Warren G. Har ding (President, 1921–1923), but this information is unconfirmed. Marvel may have passed away in 1922, because the 1923 Pasadena city dir ectory lists R uth P arsons as a wido w for the fir st time . However, the Marvel H. Parsons in the VA records was retired from active duty in October 1939 and didn’t die until Ma y 12, 1947, although he is evidently not buried in any of the VA’s national ceme- teries. Rather than his ha ving passed a way in 1923, it seems mor e likely that a man who r ose from enlistee to captain or e ven major would require an entire career to do so, and four or fiv e years just isn’t enough. It may be that Ruth Parsons fibbed a little to co ver up the stigma attached to her divorce. According to John, R uth (and perhaps her par ents) cultivated a 3 The Early Years: 1914–1936"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"hatred in her son for the father he never knew. In his essay Analysis By A Master of the Temple he wrote (in the third person), “Your father separated from your mother in order that you might grow up with a hatred of authority and a spirit of r evolution necessary to my work. The Oedipus complex was needed to formulate the love of witchcraft which would lead you into magick, with the influence of your grand- father activ e to pr event too complete an identification with y our mother.” Of his childhood he wrote, “Your isolation as a child developed the necessary background of literature and scholarship; and the unfortu- nate experiences with other childr en [developed] the requisite con- tempt for the crowd and for the group mores. You will note that these factors developed the needful hatr ed for christianity [sic] (without implanting a christian [sic] guilt sense) at an e xtremely early age.” In The Book of AntiChrist (written by him just prior to Analysis By A Master of the Temple ) John Parsons alleges to have invoked Satan at age 13, cowering in fear when he appeared. This event would have occurred in late 1927 or sometime in 1928. The r eason for the invo- cation is not given, but it may have had to do with his problems with other children. It seems that in moments of distr ess not a fe w chil- dren have turned to magic, witchcraft or called upon “the devil.” In the dir ectory listing of 1928 the P arsons and the Whitesides show up at 1105 Glen Oaks Blvd., Pasadena, where Walter Whiteside was listed as homeo wner. Glen Oaks w as a br and new street that year, not listed in any of the previous city directories. There was only one other house on the str eet, which must ha ve been the start of a new housing development. Evidently Walter was doing very well at work, selling the old place and ha ving a brand new home built for himself. Around this time, when he was in the eighth gr ade, John made a lifelong friend when he found himself at the wr ong end of a bully’ s attention. One y oung fello w, Edw ard S. F orman, interv ened on Par sons’ behalf, and the two were inseparable after that. Parsons and Forman soon learned the y shared other interests: For example, both read the works of Jules Verne, especially From the Earth to the Moon , and Hugo Gernsback’ s ne w magazine of “scientifiction” called Amazing Stories . The boys shared an interest in rockets that was more than theo- retical. They loved to blow off fi reworks in Parsons’ backyard, and in 1928 they began to experiment with small, solid-fuel rockets. People who knew Parsons at the time said his y ard was full of holes and 4 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"burn spots fr om the constant activity . Inter estingly, Forman later stated that he and P arsons often used glue as a binder to hold together the various gunpowder mixtures they prepared for their lit- tle rockets, a fact that will be important later on. The adult male r ole model in P arsons’ life w as his gr andfather Walter, though Parsons’ own writings show that Ruth was clearly the major influence in his life . It seems P arsons never knew his birth father, growing up from infancy with Walter and Carrie Whiteside in their house . John Bluth, ar chivist of NASA ’s Jet Pr opulsion Laboratory, has speculated that some adult must ha ve encouraged Par sons’ early inter est in r ockets and fir eworks. P erhaps it w as merely a neighbor or a teacher, but it may have been his grandfather Walter. For some reason the family moved very quickly, appearing in the Pasadena city dir ectory of 1929 at 285 N. San R afael Ave. This address was a new number on this street in this year, which leads one to assume that Walter Whiteside was taking advantage of the expan- sion taking place in Pasadena. For the first time the city directory lists Walter’s occupation. Her e he’ s sho wn to be the manager of Annandale Corporation, indicating a probable promotion. Years later, John Parsons would tell the FBI that he toured Europe in 1929 with his “par ents,” a reference that must ha ve been to his mother and grandparents, who were the only parents he had. Such a trip would be affordable for a well-to-do man like Walter. Ruth’s obit- uary said she traveled to Europe on several occasions with her par- ents. At least one of these trips must have included her son. Of his teenage years, Parsons wrote in Analysis By A Master of the Temple , “Early adolescence continued the development of the neces- sary combinations. The awakening interest in chemistry and science prepared the counterbalance for the coming magical a wakening, the means of obtaining pr estige and livelihood in the formativ e period, and the scientific method necessary for m y manifestation. The mag- ical fiasco at the age of 16 [193 0 or ’3 1, reference uncertain] w as needful to k eep you away from magick until y ou were sufficiently matured.” Around the time of this m ysterious “magical fiasco” in 193 1, John’s gr andfather, Walter, passed a way. Carrie Whiteside subse- quently listed her self as a wido wer in the 1932 dir ectory. John Par sons, just turning 17, had no w lost his father figur e and r ole model. Most of his adult life John sought out others to fulfill this role. In the year after his grandfather’s death, Parsons and his boyhood 5 The Early Years: 1914–1936"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"friend Ed Forman devised a successful e xperiment that shows their interest in rockets was more than an amateur concern: the y heated black powder—which involved no little danger—and cast it into a wax matrix. Aluminum (pr esumably aluminum oxide powder) was also added as an o xidizer. During the heat of combustion, the mix- ture would release oxygen, which further fueled the burn. P arsons and Forman remembered these early e xperiments later, when the y began to work on rockets as a profession. That same y ear, 1932, P arsons took a job with the Her cules Pow der Company of Pasadena, where Ed Forman may have worked as well, as certainly he did later on. In 1933 P arsons graduated from the University School, which some ha ve confused with Univ ersity High School in West Los Angeles. The University School John Parsons attended w as a small, priv ate establishment located at 985 E. California St. in P asadena. Attendance at such a priv ate school is another indication of the Whiteside-Parsons family’s wealth. Par sons and F orman attended P asadena Junior College together , and though it r emains is unclear what subjects the y studied, both spent two years at the expensive private college, USC (University of Southern California) but neither man graduated. As they continued to indulge their passion for rockets, Parsons and Forman corresponded with Robert Goddard and some of the Germans and Russians working in the field. One of the Germans w as science writer Willy Le y, who later fled the Nazis to America. Le y was a member of the German Rocket Society in Berlin, as was Wernher von Braun. 1 Par sons and F orman probably also corr esponded with Hermann Oberth, the father of German r ocketry. Oberth had been born in Transylvania and then immigr ated to Germany. Ley and von Braun owed much to him. They no doubt contacted Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Oberth’s peer in R ussia. The y ma y ha ve also contacted the Frenchman Esnault-Pelterie, though no mention is made of him in the records. Esnault-P elterie w as contempor ary with Oberth and Tsiolkovsky, and was just as well known in the field. Forman later reminisced that they actually learned very little from the correspondence within this field, beyond the fact that nobody else had yet achieved much. Parsons and Forman eventually discontinued 6 sex and r ockets 1. Ley helped popularize a number of scientific miscellany such as dinosaur survivals, space travel, and Atlantis.

John left his high school years employer Hercules Powder in 1934 to work for Halifax Explosiv es in the Moja ve Desert. Ed F orman was also employed by Halifax, though possibly at a later date. At this time Parsons bought a used car from a local dealership. The salesman w as R obert B . R ypinski, who later w orked for Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ). Rypinski liked Parsons immediately, and the two shared many interests, becoming good friends and remaining so for a number of y ears. A chance discovery at Rypinski’s house a few years later would have great consequences for Parsons, but in the meantime the two enjoyed frequent weekends together, and Rypinksi later r emembered that P arsons “burned with a w arm, gem-lik e flame.” In the spring of 1935, John married Helen Northrup in the Church of the Little Flowers. The couple met at a chur ch dance. Helen was the daughter of Burton A. and Olga Northrup, and w orked as a sec- retary at her father’s business, Northrup Business Adjustments. John and Helen bought themselv es a home at 168 S. T errace Driv e, Pasadena, while Carrie Whiteside bought a new house for herself and Ruth Parsons at 723 Lincoln, possibly a smaller house just big enough for two widows. In his memoirs Parsons cryptically referred to a “loss of family fortune” around this time, perhaps in connection with his grandfa- ther’s death. He wr ote, “The early marriage to Helen serv ed to break your family ties and effect a transference to her, away from a dangerous attachment to y our mother. The e xperience at Halifax and Cal T ech serv ed to str engthen y our self r eliance, scientific method and material powers. The influence of Tom Rose [reference uncertain] at this period, as that of Ed Forman in adolescence, was essential in de veloping the male center .” Parsons also r efers to “. . .

After seeing an article in the Pasadena Evening Post about a lecture given at the California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech or Caltech), Par sons and pal Ed F orman went to campus to talk to the speak er. The topic was the rocket experiments of the Austrian Eugen Sänger, and the lecture had been given by a graduate student named William Bollay, which is still on file in the JPL archives. Though the speech was written in 1935, it appear s to ha ve been pr esented se veral times—perhaps as late as 1939. It concludes with speculation on the possibility of “stratospheric passenger carriers,” i.e., “spaceships.” NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory began in the 192 0s and w as known as the Guggenheim A eronautical Labor atory, California Institute of Technology ( GALCIT ). GALCIT started as an aerodynamics research laboratory funded by a member of the famous Guggenheim family and administered by Caltech. In 1926, GALCIT came under the direction of the w ell-known Hungarian pr ofessor Theodor e v on Kármán (1881–1963). Born in Budapest on Ma y 11, 1881, von Kármán was descended from Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel of Prague, and he often boasted of his ancestor’s reputation for having created a golem, “an artificial human being in Hebrew folklore endowed with life.” 2 Unmentioned in his autobiography, The Wind and Beyond , the golem appear s in several secondary sources. Though not relevant to our discussion of GALCIT , the cr eation of the golem is a topic w e will r eturn to later when we discuss “magical children.” After graduating Göttingen Univ ersity in German y, von Kármán was awarded a fellowship there, and began to conduct r esearch on aerodynamic drag in one of Eur ope’s first wind tunnels , which he built for this purpose . He later mo ved to the position of Chair of Aer onautics at the T echnische Hochschule in Aachen, German y, where GALCIT ’s Clark Millikan found him in 1926. Clark Millikan was the son of Caltech president Robert Millikan and the head of the GAL- CIT lab when he recruited von Kármán away from Aachen. Von Kármán’s specialty was the new, wide-open field of aeronau- tics, and he eventually influenced a number of students who went on to great things in their o wn right.

For Malina, von Kármán became a father figur e, much like the one Parsons was still seeking. Although the older man did not actualize his father fixation, when Par sons was with v on Kármán, he kne w was in the pr esence of a great man. In turn, v on Kármán called P arsons “a delightful screw- ball” who “loved to recite pagan poetry to the sky while stamping his feet”—a r eference to Aleister Cr owley’s “Hymn to P an,” which Par sons loved to recite. At a party at the big house at 1003 S. Orange Grove Ave. where he would eventually live, Parsons stood in a bal- cony above the gathering and r ecited the Hymn fr om memory after being prompted by Andrew Haley, von Kármán’s attorney. Aerojet employee Fritz Zwicky r elated that P arsons invoked Pan, the wild, horned god of fertility, before each rocket test. Parsons was probably not the only one present at such dangerous tests who said a pr ayer. His heter odoxy notwithstanding, v on Kármán wr ote in 1958 that Par sons was the third most important person in the development of rocketry in the United States—behind only himself and Frank Malina. Von Kármán praised Parsons’ “rich talent for chemistry,” and perhaps induced by Parsons’ beliefs, von Kármán found it necessary to say he read John Symonds’ The Great Beast , an early, somewhat sensation- alistic biography of Aleister Crowley, the infamous “black magician” who exerted so much influence over Parsons. After appearing at Bollay’s lecture on Sänger, Parsons and Forman used the opportunity to ask Bolla y about working at Caltech, where they could get the necessary funds for their e xperiments with rock- ets. Though unable to dir ectly help P arsons and F orman, Bolla y directed them to F rank Malina. Although P arsons and Forman held no degrees, Malina was able to spot their useful qualities right away. Forman was the expert mechanic while Parsons knew powder explo- sives backward and forward, even developing the practice of visiting industrial accidents to determine cause of e xplosions. The two men revealed their love of rocketry and developing ways of making them work. People remember Parsons as the theor etician and Forman as the mechanic, perfectly complementing one another . The pair w ere an inseparable team and an inv aluable component for Malina, who later wrote that P arsons “lacked the discipline of formal tr aining, [but] had an uninhibited fruitful imagination.” The lack of discipline 9 The Early Years: 1914–1936"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"and uninhibited fruitful imagination w ould naturally spill over into other areas of Parsons’ life.

Targeting Clark Millik an to sponsor his doctorate, Millikan refused, an act that Malina resented from then on. Malina took his pr oject down the Caltech hall to v on Kármán, who immediately appr oved of it and pr ovided his support. V on Kármán was well known for considering what other s thought to be too kooky; after all, rockets were still viewed as science fiction by the public. The mer e mention of r ockets had people thinking of such impossible things as trips to the moon and r arely anything else. Von Kármán’s allo wed Parsons and F orman to use the lab at GALCIT despite their lack of affiliation with the school. Malina later wr ote of being influenced b y reading Jules V erne’s From the Earth to the Moon at the age of 12, as had P arsons and Forman. (Malina actually read it in Czech, when he lived in that coun- try with his parents for a few years.) All three enjoyed the excitement of trial-and-error experimentation, though Malina also understood the importance of theor etical w ork, upon which v on Kármán alw ays insisted. Since P arsons and F orman were anxious to test r ockets to prove brash theories, Malina best served his role by inducing them to work out their theoretical work. When experiments seemed to reach a dead end, Parsons would go to von Kármán, who’d perform a fe w quick calculations and say something like, “Yes, John, it is possible to achieve success in the dir ection you are heading, but fir st you must work out se veral dependant v ariables in the field.” Fieldw ork was Par sons’ specialty; and for this v ery reason one is tempted to think von Kármán should ha ve found him mor e important than Malina in his 1958 list of the most important people in aer ospace. Malina corresponded heavily with his par ents in Texas when he was de veloping r ocketry with P arsons, Forman and v on Kármán. Significant portions of these letters are preserved in the JPL archives under the file, “Excerpts from Letters Written Home.” Taken together with the memoirs Malina later wrote, these missives provide valuable insight and a complete picture into the early development of rockets in the United States. The first mention of Parsons and Forman in Malina’s documents comes on February 14, 1936. By March 30, Malina referred to the pair and himself as the “gr oup.” After r eviewing the scant liter ature on the subject of rockets, the group decided that their first goal would be to develop a working motor. Stationary tests of motor s, rather than 10 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"launching test r ockets, was the fir st priority. Other e xperimenters bypassed this important step, failing as a r esult. Von Kármán per- suaded GALCIT to lease three acres of land from the city of Pasadena in the area known as the Arroyo Seco, which exists in the shadow of the San Gabriel Mountains , just above the dam called De vil’s Gate. The acreage was the site of the ne w group’s experiments. Today, NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is situated there. The great experiment started slowly. Malina writes on April 5 that Par sons and F orman take jobs at a po wder company. Presumably they returned to Halifax. Ev en though r ockets were their passion, there was no mone y in it—y et. On April 13, Malina wr ote that he hadn’t seen either of them for at least se veral days; Parsons finally phoned Malina on Ma y 24, telling him that he almost had a r ocket motor completed. A month later, on June 18, Malina writes of P arsons testing with powder, a reference to a solid fuel called “ballistite ,” which is made by inserting a compressed black powder into the r ocket motor so it will burn more slowly and evenly. The compression is accomplished by heating smokeless powder at first, then extruding it under pr es- sure into long thin rods. Smokeless powder is a “double-base propel- lant” consisting of nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose, a formula known since the time of Alfr ed Nobel, the inv entor of dynamite. This pro- pellant was the fuel that e ventually powered bazooka rockets and was not much different from the wax and aluminum used by Parsons and Forman in 1932. Ballistite w as used in some of their tests prior to their work with GALCIT . The work took off r apidly once the testing started. On June 29, Malina wrote, “Parsons and I drove all over Los Angeles—looking for high pressure tanks and meter s. Didn’t ha ve any luck. Two instru- ments we need costs $60 a piece and we are trying to find them sec- ond hand. I am convinced it is a hopeless task. Will have to approach Kármán.” The group’s lack of funds reflects that GALCIT wasn’t anx- ious to bankr oll a pr oject the y felt w as far-fetched. Malina approached Professor Irving P. Krick, who made a lot of money fore- casting weather for movie studios. Though intrigued by the possibil- ities, Krick did not contribute . Parsons, Forman, and Malina w ere required to fund the project on their own. On July 18, Malina wr ote, “The early part of this w eek Jack Par sons and I covered much of Los Angeles looking for equipment. Our next lead points to Long Beach. P arsons is planning to start manufacturing explosives with another fello w [Forman].

I have found in Parsons and his wife [Helen] a pair of good intelligent friends.” “Hope they make a go of it” almost sounds defeatist, but Malina persisted. In the summer of 1936, Malina took the tr ouble to visit R obert Goddard (1882–1945) in R oswell, Ne w Me xico. Goddar d left Connecticut for Roswell years earlier to work on his own rocket pro- ject, about which he was very secretive. Goddard actually worked in Pasadena for a while during W orld War I, in the v ery Arroyo Seco where Parsons, Malina, and F orman were laboring. Malina visited Goddard to get ideas for his own research and to perhaps find a new position working for Goddard—who had funding—rather than at the cheap domain of Caltech. At the invitation of Harry Guggenheim and v on Kármán, who were interested in recruiting him, Goddard visited Caltech. Unwilling to leave Roswell, Goddard requested that Caltech send Malina to Roswell to visit his facility, which Malina did in September. During Malina’s visit, Goddard was polite on the surface, but dis- played obvious tension. As Goddar d showed him ar ound, Malina realized his host didn’t sho w anything of value. Malina knew right away that Goddard wanted another hand to do the hard work rather than a co-r esearcher. Malina r eturned to California disappointed. Goddard later refused a position at Caltech offered by Clark Millikan, probably understanding he would just be another scientist on a large campus, rather than the head of his o wn program. In his memoir s, von Kármán made some rather negative comments about Goddard’s research suffering from self-imposed isolation. Back at Caltech, “the gr oup” was joined by three others: Apollo M.O. Smith (called “ Amo” b y his friends), Carlos C. W ood, and Rudolph Schott, bringing the total to six. Smith was a Caltech student like Malina, and r egarded an eccentric since he constantly w ore a pith helmet he modified by placing a small cooling fan on top. Wood and Schott were just a couple of guys from town who walked out to the test site and offer ed their assistance . Schott’s red pickup truck became the gr oup’s standard means of tr ansporting test appar atus. There was also associated with the gr oup for a while an individual named Rockefeller (“Rocky”), but little mention of him e xists in the records. Someone operated a motion picture camera during some of the tests; Rocky may well have been the camera operator. In September , 1936, Malina got a ne w r oommate: Martin Summerfield (1916–1996), a gr aduate student inter ested in r ockets 12 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"who arriv ed at Caltech fr om Br ooklyn College in Ne w Y ork. Summerfield went on and made great advances in the field of liquid propellants; the Summerfield Burning R ate Law is named after him.

Both Summerfield and Malina were graduate students, well-versed in the- ory, while P arsons held no degr ee and w as entirely self-trained. A week after Summerfield mo ved in, Malina learned that he shar ed birthdays with Parsons, one of the last discoveries they would enjoy together as friends. 13 The Early Years: 1914–1936"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"14 sex and r ockets Parsons at left, and Ed Forman."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"two Parsons at Caltech: 1936–1939 H alloween of 1936 pr oduced the event which JPL still refers to as its birth. F rom Malina’s letters, one gets the impr ession that this important date meant little e xcept another series of tests ending in failure. Even if the day signified fail- ure to F rank Malina, a photogr apher was present to get shots of Rudolph Schott, Amo Smith, Malina, Ed F orman, and John Parsons posing with testing apparatus. Though the photo is referred to by JPL staff as “the Nativity Scene ,” Carlos Wood, one of the r esearchers, failed to attend the apparently momentous gathering. Once a y ear, on JPL ’s Open House for the public , the Nativity Scene is r ecreated with mannequins just behind the JPL Visitors’ Center. For the 5 0th anniversary in 1986, JPL contemplated hiring live actors to portray the five founders. This event never material- ized, but the P arsons mannequin and four other s are stored at JPL today, stored for the ne xt Open House when the y’ll be put on dis- play. It seems ir onic that this Nativity Scene took place on Halloween in 1936, containing the likeness of a man who signed an oath stating he w as “the Antichrist.” Photogr aphs of the original scene and the JPL recreation are reproduced in the photo section of this volume. (It should be pointed out that the Nativity Scene cele- brates the test of liquid fuel, though the gr oup worked with both solid and liquid fuel at this time.) The day after the Nativity Scene, an incident occurred that Malina thought significant to r eport: One of the fuel hoses pulled fr ee, and the fuel spilling out the end ignited. The hose started twisting and turning, a flaming serpent fr om which the y all r an for their liv es. After they composed themselv es, the gr oup regretted not capturing the moment on film. Later tests fared somewhat better, but the group still measured success in ho w many seconds the rocket fired. By January 16, 1937, they were up to 44 seconds. The test apparatus at Arroyo Seco was built with borrowed tanks and hoses, Forman later r ecalled. He machined the casing for the chamber himself and stated, “It w as a hand-to-mouth oper ation where you rented machine time for $2 an hour and did the w ork 15 Parso ns at Caltech: 1936–1939"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"yourself, in a day when wages were 25 cents an hour.” That’s half a day’s wages for one hour of shop time. Forman’s skill in this precise field is what gave him his excellent reputation as a mechanic. He con- tinued to head the GALCIT / JPL mechanics department for as long as he stayed with the group. The original schematic for the Nativity Scene test, is dr awn on tracing paper by Malina, who signed both his and Parsons’ names at the bottom. The schematics show oxygen flowing from one side, with methyl alcohol (the fuel) and nitr ogen flowing from the other side . Water cooled the r ocket during the burn. Thrust pushed do wn a spring that measured force. The deflection of the spring measured the force applied to it. A small diamond tip on the apparatus scratched a glass plate to mark the furthest point of deflection. The r ocket and mount were protected by sandbags, with the tanks (and the e xperi- menters) well away from it. Five pages of Parsons’ handwritten notes, which cover the period November 15, 1936 to January 17, 1937, begin: The research is conducted with the view of acertaing [sic] the apli- cation [sic] of the rocket to altitude exploration and other fields, the properties of various fuels and of metals at high temperatur es.

The second test on November 15 employed methyl alcohol at various pressures as a fuel, ignited by a remote battery. All three trials on that second test day ended in failure. In his notes, Parsons remarked that he should switch from rubber tubing to copper tubing to prevent the tubing from burning up during future tests. A third test, on November 28, yielded four burns of various dura- tion, the best of which w as 20 seconds. Parsons’ notes outline the various materials used in these tests , as w ell as their pr ocurement sources, as w ell as a r ecord of the test tak en January 16, 1937. Obviously these field notes are incomplete. The long periods of time between each test are due to von Kármán’s insistence that the group analyze each burn before they start another. While waiting, Parsons and Forman launched their o wn powder rockets. Malina wrote, “[T]heir attitude is symptomatic of the anxiety of pioneers of ne w technological de velopments. In or der to obtain support for their dr eams, they are under pr essure to demonstr ate them before they can be technically accomplished.” Par sons is mentioned in Malina’ s letters a couple of times during this period and the months follo wing. For the record, Malina wrote on November 21, 1936 that P arsons had the flu the pr evious week. Though the first successful test of a solid-fuel rocket motor took place in January 1937, Malina didn’t think much of it at the time , as it is not even mentioned. The gr oup left the arroyo next April and mo ved on-campus at Caltech, located right in P asadena, where they worked out of one of the GALCIT lab buildings. Only von Kármán would have been daring enough to let these unsophisticated r esearchers work on-campus. In May, Hsue-shen Tsien, who had come fr om China on a scholar ship funded by Boxer Rebellion reparations, began working with the group, sharing an office with Amo Smith. W eld Arnold, a meteor ology stu- dent, contributed b y presenting the gr oup with $1000 in small bills wrapped in a ne wspaper. No one dar ed ask wher e he got them. A small fund w as opened at Caltech, and the mone y deposited. Curiously, at the end of the war there was still $300 left in the account. Arnold became the group’s unofficial photographer for a while, riding his bicycle at least 20 miles from Los Angeles every day. Campus residents soon resented the group’s presence. Testing was loud and violent. Immediately after their arriv al on campus , the group met with their fir st disaster. In the lab the y had mounted a rocket motor to a 50-foot pendulum. They measured the swing of the 17 Parso ns at Caltech: 1936–1939"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"pendulum to calculate the thrust pr oduced. The fir st motor tested exploded, filling the building with a cloud of meth yl alcohol and nitrogen dioxide. A thin layer of rust formed on many pieces of valu- able equipment thr oughout the lab . The other campus r esidents started referring to the group as “the Suicide Squad.” Parsons would remember this event four years later, when he finally figur ed out a way to put the volatility of red fuming nitric acid ( RFNA ) to good use. Von Kármán moved the group outside, adjacent to the lab, and had them rebuild the pendulum, this time making it fiv e times stronger than thought necessary. Two years later the pendulum was destroyed again during an explosion, when a piece of steel was hurled into the wall wher e Malina had been standing just minutes earlier . Fortunately, he had been called a way by von Kármán’s secretary on some mundane matter concerning a typewriter. After this dangerous incident, back to the arroyo the group went. On March 22 there is another brief mention of Parsons in Malina’s letters, and on April 24 Malina r elated that Parsons was writing a paper “on the chemistry end of it.” This paper w as entitled “ A Consideration of the Practicality of Various Substances as Fuels for Jet Propulsion.” The finished paper is dated June 19, 1937, and is signed “J. Parsons, Halifax Explosives Company.” Despite its origin, it was later classified by the government but has long been declassi- fied and is on file at the JPL archives, the only paper in the archives bearing Parsons’ name as the sole author. He was co-author on sev- eral other papers, but this one was his alone. The paper begins: In considering the practicality of various fuels and oxidizers for rockets, cer tain criteria apply which ar e not met with in or dinary internal combustion motor problems. Since rocket per formance is influenced by the ratio of fuel weight to total weight, and since the r ocket must car ry all the oxidizer necessar y for combustion, the ratio of total weight of fuel and oxidizer to the available ener gy is of utmost impor- tance. Since mass per unit flow is also impor tant, a high spe- cific gravity is preferred. In addition, or dinary considerations of safety , availability, cost and convenient physical state should not be neglected. Par sons was saying that the fuel must be dense to pack a r eal punch, and be powerful enough to lift its own weight as well as that 18 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"of the rocket and the cargo it may be carrying. This seemingly obvi- ous statement is one that ne vertheless must be made at the start of analysis. In the paper , Parsons presents five tables of v arious fuels with some algebraic calculations and chemical equations determining various pr operties of each. These calculations mak e it clear that Par sons was no amateur r ocket hobbyist. He was, as everyone said, the theoretician of the group, even if he was an impatient theoretician. Par sons had obvious mathematical and scientific kno wledge to back up his assertions . Malina specialized in differ ential calculus, which does not appear in the work of Parsons. Par sons’ first table looks at the explosive gases acetylene, butane, butyne, hydrogen, and methane. He dismisses acetylene as inherently dangerous, without carrying out the calculations of combustive prop- erties. He further mentions potential pr oblems with h ydrogen and methane. Liquid o xygen is not e ven in the table , as Parsons elimi- nates it from calculations altogether as being too dangerous. He was right about this for decades . Only when the safe handling of liquid oxygen was finally perfected did it r eplace the liquid fuel combina- tions that Parsons himself would help perfect. Table II contains the liquid h ydrocarbons methyl alcohol, eth yl alcohol, propargyl, benzol, eth yl ether, and heptane . All had gr eat availability, were cheap and easy to handle, but all had a low energy content. Table III contains self-combustibles (explosives) such as gunpow- der, etc., the energy content of which was low compared to gases and liquids, and which were difficult to handle. With a few precautions, Par sons added, the y might be r endered useful. P arsons even men- tioned that the y might be “moulded or pr essed into sticks ,” which was the seed of an idea that would later lead to success. Table IV addresses metal organics and hybrids. Little was known about them, Parsons said, and the y were costly to handle and diffi- cult to prepare. One of them, trimeth yl aluminum, is spontaneously inflammable in air . Parsons believed they were worthy of further investigation, though nothing seems to have come of it. Table V is labeled “Various Elements” and contains figures for alu- minum, boron, carbon, lithium, and magnesium. P arsons thought they may have some value when blended with other substances, for which aluminum was already being used in the field of e xplosives. Par sons further thought the energy obtained from such blends could be used indirectly to heat another substance, such as water. There is also a sixth table, which lists not fuels but oxidizers, sub- 19 Parso ns at Caltech: 1936–1939"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The cover of Astronautics uses a schematic diagram of Parsons’, Forman’s and Malina’s GALCIT liquid fuel research set-up."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"stances introduced into a chemical pr ocess to speed combustion. Much experimentation remained to be done with o xidizers, Parsons concluded. The 13-page paper contains six appendices sho wing val- ues for different materials obtained thr ough actual experimentation by Par sons and others. These appendices represent the real-world fol- low-up to the theoretical calculations showed in the first part of the report. The appendices reflects not only the up-front calculations but also actual tests of fuel mixtur es at Halifax. Documenting each step represents a lengthy but necessary pr ocess. No definite conclusions were reached, but Parsons always saw in each experiment the begin- ning of another. Each test led to ne w ideas for him, and he ne ver stopped thinking. Malina credits Parsons’ paper with the development of red fuming nitric acid as a storable oxidizer. He also pointed out that Parsons first anticipated the use of bor on hydride as a fuel in this paper , putting him ahead of his time. The key, as von Kármán said, was to make the fuel burn slowly. In armaments applications the fuel w as burned as quickly as possible . Parsons and F orman had to unlearn this tech- nique and find a new one. When the term ended the next month, Malina paid Parsons a visit. On May 22—before the paper w as actually finished, Malina wr ote, “Antelope Valley, near New Hall—This weekend I accepted an invi- tation of Jack Parsons to spend at the house he has r ented near the powder company for which he w orks. Jack’s wife [Helen] is her e which ensures good meals. We are about 40 miles from Pasadena in the foothills.” Antelope Valley is the curr ent site of Edw ards Air Force Base—a large valley—and it is uncertain if the po wder company Halifax, for which Parsons labored, was anywhere near the base. Several explo- sives companies came from Antelope Valley, all conveniently remote from the city. John and Helen Parsons must not have lived there very long, for the P asadena city dir ectories show them living at 168 S. Terrace Drive from 1937 to 1940. Perhaps they retained the house at S. Terrace, which they owned, and rented the house intermittently in Antelope Valley until Parsons finished his paper in June. While writing the paper, Parsons commuted back to P asadena to do additional testing with GALCIT . That group achieved its best results yet in May, running a motor for longer than a minute . However, the graduate students finished their term and summer arrived and drifted away. Malina and Tsien focused on doctorate programs. Weld went to New York. Those who stayed behind collected their papers on rocketry 21 Parso ns at Caltech: 1936–1939"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"into what the y called “the Bible ,” copies of which e xist in the JPL archives. Parsons’ paper was among the half-dozen or so in the volume. Around this time , Parsons and Malina started to write “ a novel with an anti-war plot” that w as also supposed to serv e as a mo vie treatment. The manuscript is fr amed in anti-capitalist beliefs , with Malina documenting his own struggles with corporate culture and the coming war in Eur ope. Some writer s have claimed the manuscript was some sort of sci-fi story about a flight to the moon, or about evil rocket scientists. This is not the case. The original script is in the possession of Marjorie Malina, Frank’s widow. It is untitled and bear s no author’s name, and is entir ely in Malina’s handwriting. Malina’s memoirs make it clear that P arsons was a collabor ator and that Malina w orked on the manuscript at Par sons’ house. Indeed, Malina expressed being nervous about being around the tetr anitromethane in P arsons’ kitchen—a chemical that Par sons was collecting though the army decided it was too dangerous to use due to its connection to se veral deaths. Because of its r arity, Par sons was stockpiling the stuff rather than disposing of it, and also had enough gunpo wder hoarded “to blo w up a city block”—this according to Ed Forman’s first wife, who probably was not exagger- ating. The gunpowder was in an open barrel on the back porch. After Par sons’ death, Malina wr ote that “Parsons’ familiarity with e xplo- sives led to contempt.” The 38-page handwritten synopsis of the script is full of cr ossed- out passages and other editing marks , indicating that the tw o men brainstormed together as Malina set it all to paper. The story is about a group of rocket scientists—obviously based on themselves and their associates at Caltech—who are struggling to carry out pur e research while other factions have more selfish aims for their work—anti-cap- italist at almost every turn. The character based on Forman is a union organizer. The intellectual characters (and even their mechanics) are all philosophical heavies. The “bad guys” are all big industrial types and those who cater to them. The story is full of side stories inv olv- ing love interests and the like. It is also eerily prophetic. The character based on Parsons is named “Theophile Belvedere,” whose description sho ws insight (and possibly a little humor) on Par sons’ part. Belvedere is “a mystic who speaks for religion and the organized church.” He is “extremely fanatical and is to used to add a sinister effect to the plot.” His description is worth quoting verbatim, but it should be k ept in mind that the manuscript w as an obvious first draft never taken beyond this stage. 22 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Theophile Belvedere is a tall slightly stooped, r osy cheeked man with a face whose lines continuously change fr om those of joy to those of miser y.

A small telescope had been built at the cor ner of the monaster y enclosur e wher e Belveder e spent many nights gazing at the stars. The monastery is located on a hill overlooking a small town of Spanish atmospher e. Once each year a fiesta is held in the town and for many years the monks have watched thr ough niches in the enclosur e the parade that took place on the closing night.

Belvedere, having an M.S. degr ee in science, applies for a public school teaching position in the Rock High School. He is accepted and becomes a teacher of general science. Near the end of the story, Belvedere accidentally blows himself up trying to stop one of his e xperiments—it should be noted that this story was written 15 years before Parsons died the same way, an eerie prophecy. Further, the char acter based on T sien gets sent back to China under suspicion of communism and dr ops out of touch with the others, an incident that also later occurr ed. Many of those who remain are investigated for their anti-capitalistic political beliefs, and Malina’s greatest fear—that their w ork would be used for w artime applications—also came true. In the story it is a rich inv estor who actually sells their secrets to the Nazis and Fascists. Included with the manuscript is another movie treatment, some of which is typed on MGM letterhead. Further handwritten technical descriptions (and illustrations) were composed in Malina’s hand. The typed portion is dated June 17, 1937 and entitled “Shado w of the Wing,” bearing Malina’s name as author. The treatment appears to be a different movie project entirely, one that an “M.

On July 4, 1937, Malina wrote, “For our ‘fourth,’ Parsons and I are going to make some tests with a powder rocket motor,” which sounds like a suitable way to celebrate both the Fourth of July and the com- pletion of Parsons’ paper just a few days earlier. On the 26th Malina wrote, “Parsons and I y esterday discussed the possibility of seeing Goddard again. Perhaps he and wife and I would drive to Roswell in his car, he to return while I go on to Texas . . .” They did not make the trip. The wording suggests that Parsons had visited Goddard pre- viously, but such a trip is not recorded elsewhere. As the months proceeded, Malina focused on his doctor al thesis, which he had been postponing for some time . Work on the thesis moved him closer to Summerfield and further fr om Parsons. Malina next refers to the rocket project a full five months later, on December 18. “Parsons wants to mak e some tests this w eekend” was all that Malina wrote, causing one to w onder why he e ven mentioned it. Later that December Malina lectur ed the local Sigma Xi chapter on “Facts and Fancies of Rockets.” And the group made the newspapers on January 26, 1938, when Malina and Smith tr aveled to New York to present a paper to the Institute of A eronautical Sciences. Clark Millikan had convinced the school to put up $2 00 for the trip— Caltech’s first direct financial support of the pr oject. That da y in January, articles appear ed in the New York Times and the Houston Chronicle , as w ell as in the Los Angeles Times , New York Herald- Tribune , and Time magazine. The story begins, “A scheme for shooting an exploratory rocket to a height of 967 miles abo ve the earth w as unfolded today before a convention of aer onautical engineers.” Malina and Smith told the convention “the idea works in theory . . . whether it will work in fact depends on the efficiency of the rocket.” They proposed a three-stage rocket with a maximum velocity of 11,000 miles per hour. As a result of the publicity , a Ne w York stuntman w anted to ride a r ocket up 1000 feet and par achute down at county fair s, and one Hollyw ood radio station wanted to broadcast the sound of a rocket motor firing. On February 2, 1938, the Caltech student paper California Tech printed an article on rockets written by Malina with the help of Smith and Tsien.

This motor, set up at the Guggenheim School of Aer onautics, California Institute of Technology, is a combustion chamber which mixes and bur ns gaseous oxygen and ethelene [sic] at 5000 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature about half that of the sun [!]. The flaming gas comes out of the “exhaust” at a speed of around 9000 feet a second. With a “step r ocket,” one with thr ee motors, two of which would be r eleased in flight, a speed of 11,000 feet a second might be reached, Molina said. “After experiments with gases, we will next tr y liquids,” said Molina, “for that is what the r ocket will have to use. We can allow only seven-tenths of the total weight of the r ocket for propellants. “The design of the r ocket will be highly impor tant because of the difficulty in keeping one in a straight course. Experiments have shown rockets may be deflected in a change in air currents. A gyro- scope may help meet this dif ficulty. “Our aim is to devise a r ocket which will carry scientific instru- ments to heights of about 500,000 feet, far above those r eached by sounding balloons. The record for a sounding balloon, I believe, is 110,000 feet. We are working everything out by theory, so far as is possible.” Molina said the decr ease with altitude in the ear th’s gravita- tional pull will be a favorable factor in building r ockets to r each even greater heights. His r eckoning is that this pull is one-tenth less 200 miles up than at the ear th’s sur face, and that it decreases proportionately with altitude. Soon after, Malina and the gr oup abandoned step r ockets alto- gether. The AP item spawned several more newspaper articles about the group’s work, but Malina lamented all the fuss, as is evidenced by the conspicuous absence of rocket travel from the above quote.

They clearly saw this exposure as a way to gain attention—and perhaps some funding. Par sons also seemed to enjo y the status his w ork brought and sometimes exaggerated his title when pr esenting himself to other s. He w ould call himself “Engineer ,” a false title since he held no degree, though he actually had a more practical knowledge of explo- sives than many engineers who did ha ve degrees. The occupations listed for Parsons in the Pasadena city directories simply came from whatever the homeowner told the compiler of the directories. Parsons started out calling himself a “chemist,” and later on calling himself a “research assistant” at Caltech. A letter of recommendation he wrote for R obert Dr oz bear s the signatur e block, “Pr oject Engineer , Aer onautics Department.” T wo GALCIT organizational charts in the JPL archives do make one thing clear: P arsons was the sole individ- ual in charge of the solid fuel program. May 1938 found Parsons in the courtr oom, named by Caltech as their best e xplosives expert when the pr osecutor of a mur der trial contacted the institute . The case for which he serv ed as an e xpert witness was a murder by car bomb. The trial lasted months and is well-documented in the Los Angeles Evening Her ald and Express . Par sons is mentioned in articles on Ma y 6 and May 10, the latter of which has a photo of him. The defendants in the case were Captain Earle E. Kynette and his two aides, Lieutenants Roy Allen and Fred Browne of the Los Angeles city police’s “spy squad” who were accused of planting a pipe bomb in the car of another officer , Harry Raymond. Raymond was a vice investigator; and apparently the three crooked cops thought he w as getting too close for comfort. When Raymond stepped on the starter switch, the bomb e xploded, killing him. The mur der took place on January 14 of that year. After surv eying the a vailable e vidence, P arsons pr epared a mockup of the bomb for the jury to see . In the Los Angeles Herald and Express May 10 photo, Parsons is seen displaying his mockup to prosecutor Gene Williams. It is a six-inch piece of pipe , three inches in diameter, capped at both ends , with a pair of wir es leading to it. Par sons stated that the original contained a pound of pressed powder and “jagged bits of metal.” The bomb destroyed both the victim’s car and the garage it was parked in.

Despite intense cr oss-examination, Par sons remained firm in his testimon y that the bomb contained smokeless powder and not some other e xplosive. The Los Angeles Times speaks highly of him in this r egard. He could not be shak en, remarkable for a 23-year-old. Several police officers refused to testify against their former col- leagues during the course of the lengthy trial, but the three were con- victed nonetheless . A bomb thr eat w as called in on the da y of Par sons’ testimony, the caller stating, “I am a friend of Kynette and a member of the police for ce, and y ou tell [special pr osecutor] Joe Fainer if he doesn’t la y off K ynette I’ll bomb him the w ay Harry Raymond was bombed.” Fainer was not bombed, but this incident may have had something to do with Parsons’ death 14 years later. The same month of the trial, Ma y 1938, a technical article aimed at r ocketeers appear ed in Astronautics: Journal of the American Rocket Society , issue 41. Parsons was not mentioned. On July 15, the morning edition of the Pasadena Star-News printed a mor e sensa- tional article, in which Parsons and Forman appear in a large photo- graph, Parsons in a dark suit, Forman in a cream-colored jacket with matching driver’s cap. Forman smokes thoughtfully as both men lean on their elbows in front of their launch appar atus. A small, single- stage model rocket hovers just overhead—obviously inserted into the photo by means of double-e xposure. The article giv es some high- lights of the pair’ s work in the Arr oyo Seco. By this time T sien had taken leave from the group, later returning to work on Rocket Project No. 1 at Caltech, while P arsons and the others worked at GALCIT in the arroyo . The Los Angeles Examiner ran its o wn account of w ork in the arroyo . The article doesn’t vary from the Pasadena Star-News article, except for having a different photo. This L.A. Examiner photo is one of the best early photos of P arsons and Forman around. Unlike the Pasadena photo, it w as actually tak en indoors. The caption could have read “Gentlemen Rocketeers.” Both men wore dark jackets and ties, with hair slick ed back and mustaches w ell-trimmed. Parsons stands on the left, holding a multi-stage rocket, while Forman kneels on the right, inspecting the spring-operated testing device. Unlike Parsons, Malina did not appr eciate publicity, feeling that the group hadn’t accomplished anything worth publicizing.

On October 24, 1938, Malina wrote, “A ‘big shot’ from the Army Ordnance division was here today. He told of the arm y’s experience with r ockets and thought ther e was little possibility of using them for military purposes . I silently r ejoiced, ho wever Par sons, who is about broke, was not so happy about it, as he hoped to get some funds for research from the army.” This sour ce of funding became another contentious point, as Malina was against all military applications of his w ork. He w as interested in civilian inno vations only—namely, scientific applica- tions that would benefit mankind, as well as possibly (eventually) an improved means of travel. Parsons was interested in the end result— working rockets—and wasn’t concerned about how he got there. As it turned out, both Malina and the “big shot” were wrong—there were military applications for rockets just around the corner. At one point Malina was invited to visit Ruben Fleet, President of the Consolidated Aircraft Company in San Diego, who gave Malina a tour and asked him about the possibility of rocket-assisted takeoffs of “big, heavy planes.” Malina left, intrigued, but nothing came of the meeting until thr ee years later, after Parsons had spent some mor e time experimenting. In fact, seaplanes were not fitted with JATO s until 1943 and they were liquid-fueled. Malina also prepared a scientific paper for a contest in France that was sponsored by André Louis Hirsch, a banker with an above-aver- age interest in rocketry. The contest was to award a cash prize to the best paper on current issues in the field. Malina won, but because of the war he did not learn of his prize until 1946—far too late for the winnings to help the pr oject. Tsien appears to ha ve helped Malina with the award-winning paper, though it bor e Malina’s name solely as author. At this time, an interesting reversal of responsibility is recorded in Malina’s letters home, in which he had written that P arsons and Forman “disappear for weeks or months sometimes with me trying to keep the project alive. They were working for the powder compa- nies and testing their own rockets during these times.” Malina took other time-consuming jobs, including wind-tunnel studies and a soil conservation project. Such outside endea vors increased tension in the group. Four months later, in a letter dated F ebruary 19, 1939, Malina wrote, “Parsons is doing some experiments with powder and is disgusted with me for not putting mor e time in to the r esearch.” The results of the powder experiments were written up by Parsons, 29 Parso ns at Caltech: 1936–1939"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"who shar ed a b yline with F orman in issue 43 of Astronautics . Certainly this b yline was merely a courtes y, as the article is obvi- ously Parsons’ work. The title of the article is “Experiments with P owder Motors for Rocket Propulsion by Successive Impulses.” Like Parsons’ previous paper, it w as classified during the w ar, though the article w as pre- sumably still in circulation. The article begins with an editorial com- ment from the publisher to the effect that “the American R ocket Society belie ves the liquid fuel r ocket motor has v ery definitely proven its superiority over powder motors . . .” This assertion would be proven wrong in two years’ time. The article, the technical analysis of which leaves little doubt that Par sons was the author, starts with a discussion of Goddar d’s work from 1919 forward and includes Goddard’s early results with rockets using black po wder as a fuel, a method b y which he w as able to achieve altitudes of 8000 feet, i.e., a mile-and-a-half up. Parsons then goes into a detailed explanation of his own test apparatus, including very e xact specifications used to construct his r ocket motor s. Hercules black powder alone was used in the first series of tests, and different results were obtained for differ ent degrees of compression (i.e., how densely the po wder was packed into the r ocket). Other powders were used in the r emaining experiments, including smoke- less varieties, and different types of wads were used at the bottom to hold the fuel in. Most char ges were ignited by an electric wir e run through this wadding and into the fuel source. Par sons concludes the article with the assertion that po wder was indeed efficient enough to pursue further. Indeed, he and Forman got rockets to r each velocities of 7150 feet per second (4875 miles per hour) in this series of tests , which appr oached what Goddar d had achieved 20 years earlier. Parsons said they were working on an ero- sion-resistant insert of special steel as w ell as a satisfactory method of measuring chamber pressures. Erosion was often a problem with the throat nozzle—the part of the rocket from which the burning fuel leaves the r ocket and pushes it up. In the article , Parsons thanked Malina, Tsien, a Mr. Spade of the Ludlum Steel Compan y, and a Mr. Henry N. Mar sh of the Her cules P owder Compan y, which w as Par sons’ original emplo yer from 1932. A t the time the article w as written, Parsons was employed by Halifax Explosives. Around this time some mone y finally came thr ough, and the school received a $10,000 grant to work on solid-fuel rockets, based on the gr oup’s progress. About this time , Fritz Zwicky, who had 30 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"taken graduate courses under Einstein, scolded Malina for thinking that a rocket could ever fly in space, asking how the exhaust could push against a v acuum. What Zwicky didn’t r ealize was that dis- placement of mass w as all that w as needed. On Mar ch 13 Malina wrote, “Parsons and Forman are to work full time and earn enough money to affor d smoking r eady-rolled cigar ettes. P arsons’ wife [Helen] will be happ y that she is not the only br eadwinner in the family.” Parsons’ good friend Rypinski related much the same thing, that Helen would “cry on his shoulder” that Parsons would only save his money for rockets, and not spend it on her. This stroke of financial luck was the result of a visit by H.H. “Hap” Arnold, commanding general of the Arm y Air Corps. Arnold was a sharp individual who would work with von Kármán for many years after the w ar, and alw ays on the look out for some ne w scientific development to be used for military applications . Unlik e the previous military “big shot” who visited, Arnold w as intrigued b y the possible uses for r ockets. Ed F orman, for instance , r ecalled Arnold’s suggestion that rockets might help airplanes tak e off while being as much as 50% over payload. Arnold had w orked with v on Kármán befor e. Though Arm y Ordnance was against exploring the possibilities of rockets, Hap was less conv entional, and had tak en Malina and v on Kármán to Washington the year previously on an unrelated matter. He knew tal- ent when he saw it and convinced the National Academy of Sciences’ Committee on Air Corps Research to fund the grant. Von Kármán and Robert Millikan were both members of the committee , which made Arnold’s job much easier . There were actually se veral aeronautics projects being funded at this time, but the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) avoided the rocket project, opting to w orking on the problem of deicing air craft windshields. “Kármán can tak e the Buck Rogers job” said the head of their aer onautics department. Kármán was glad he did and later called the project “one of the most fascinating periods of my career.” On April 18, 1939, a pr oposal w as submitted to the Boar d of Directors at Caltech entitled, “Pr oposal for a Jet Pr opulsion Experimental Station at the Guggenheim A eronautical Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology.” The draft I have seen has the title “Chairman, Subcommittee for Jet Pr opulsion Research” below the signature block. Presumably this “Chairman” w as von Kármán, though the work is probably Malina’s.

As to the construction, F orman later told a Lockheed compan y newsletter that he made an arrangement with a local bulldozer oper- ator who worked for the city to grade the experimental station arena in the Arroyo Seco. The group itself fabricated the buildings from tim- bers and other items found in the arroyo , a “complex” that was a far cry from the 6000-employee facility JPL of today. In his memoir, von Kármán says he originally obtained the land, countering F orman’s similar, and perhaps exaggerated, claim. In the follo wing months, Parsons and F orman are mentioned in passing in several Malina letters, and both earn a longer mention in his letter of A ugust 21 when a lar ge explosion hit the building the y were working in on campus . The explosion occurred at 8:20 in the morning, “too early for Parsons and Forman to be at work,” causing $10,000 in damage to the building—the entire value of the grant. The explosion caused an unr ecognizable film to deposit itself on e very- thing in the building, and when Parsons and Forman finally arrived, the Caltech staff were waiting for them with cleaning rags, expecting the two to clean it up. As had happened after the e xplosion of 1937, the group was soon working back in the arroyo . On October 21, Parsons and Forman received invitations to a staff dinner at the Athenaeum, but old, social prejudices arose when they presented themselv es at the door . “You tw o ar en’t Caltech staff. You’re from town,” they were told by the overzealous doorman, who wouldn’t let them in despite their invitations. About this time Malina arrived and convinced the man the pair should be let in just this once, to save face for Caltech, claiming he would ensure that the mis- take of inviting them w ould not be made again. The doorman w as swayed, and the two were finally allowed to enter. On No vember 26, 1939, the magazine supplement to the Los Angeles Sunday Times ran an article on Parsons, Forman and Malina featuring a photogr aph of the fir st two, stating that the thr ee “are tired of explaining they are not trying to build a rocket ship for initi- ation of the fir st airline tour s to the moon.” Their goal, the article said, was the exploration of the properties of near space. No mention of Hap Arnold’ s project was made, but other scientists’ ideas on accomplishing this exploratory feat were also discussed.

Later he had the idea of photogr aphing the gauges rather than trying to write everything down during the short- duration burns, a policy that made it much easier to document the actual readings. Around this time Parsons made an interesting discovery in Robert Rypinski’s library, a disco very that w ould change the dir ection of Par sons’ personal life as much as Bollay’s lecture changed the direc- tion of his pr ofessional life . When P arsons rummaged thr ough Rypinski’s library he found a cop y of Aleister Cr owley’s Konx Om Pax , published in 1907, which Rypinski had bought years earlier. The discovery, Rypinski said, was to Parsons “like real water to a thirsty man.” Rypinksi himself never had figured out the rather dense book, so he gave it to Parsons, who soon told him he had entered into cor- respondence with its author. Although recorded in se veral places, including Nat F reedland’s The Occult Explosion and Sybil Leek’s Diary of a Witch , the story is untrue that Crowley had once been in Pasadena long enough to start a lodge for his mystical order, the Ordo Templi Orientis ( OTO ). In real- ity, Crowley did make a brief stopover in Los Angeles in 19 15—and couldn’t wait to leave. Not until 20 years later would there be an offi- cial representative of the OTO in the ar ea, namely Wilfr ed Talbot Smith, at whose home P arsons was to present himself shortly after his discovery of Cr owley. It seems mor e than coincidental that the only lodge of the OTO was located within a fe w miles of P arsons’ home. Some familiarity with the magus Cr owley (1875–1947) will be assumed throughout the remainder of this book, though I will elabo- rate on the elements of his work that have a direct bearing upon the work of John P arsons. Readers wishing to learn about Cr owley are referred to the works listed in the bibliogr aphy; however, a satisfac- tory biography of the powerful and enigmatic Crowley remains to be published. Crowley’s Los Angeles representative, Smith, was from Tonbridge, Kent, about 2 0 miles southeast of London. He started his magical career as a member of the original Agape Lodge in Vancouver, British Columbia—the fir st North American lodge of the OTO —of which “Frater A chad” (Charles Stansfeld Jones , 1885–195 0) w as the founder. Smith had met Crowley at the Agape Lodge in 1915, during the latter’s second American tour, and had soon risen to a position of greater authority in the Lodge , as A chad (Hebrew for “Unity”) fell into disfavor with Crowley and was eventually expelled for a variety 33 Parso ns at Caltech: 1936–1939"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"of heresies. Smith mo ved to Los Angeles in 193 0, and, upon his arrival, began w orking on r eopening the A gape Lodge, sometimes referred to as Agape Lodge #2. Smith’s colleague was Regina Kahl, who served as his High Priestess of the Gnostic Mass. The two are said to have run the Agape Lodge very strictly, almost tyr annically. Separ ate photos of K ahl and Smith ar e reproduced in Crowley’s OTO publication, The Equinox , vol. III, no. 10. The Gnostic Mass was Crowley’s replacement for the “corrupted” mass celebr ated b y the R oman Catholic and Eastern Orthodo x churches. The text of the Mass, referred to as Liber XV , was written in Moscow in 1913. Partly inspired by the Russian Orthodox Mass, it is surprisingly Christian in its s ymbology, and ther e is nothing obscene about it despite what certain detractors may say. In fact, it is reminiscent of W agner’s Par sifal with its r epeated r eferences to “lance” and “Grail,” which are its most suggestiv e elements. As in the Christian Mass, the Holy Spirit is invoked often. The most openly erotic element in the mass occurs when the priestess disrobes for part of the ceremony. The Gnostic Mass is too long to reproduce here but may be found in its entirety in Crowley’s book, Magick . It is also r eprinted in sec- tion IV of Gems from the Equinox , edited by Israel Regardie, and The Equinox vol. III , no. 10, as well as various locations on the internet. It would have been inter esting to see what Cr owley and the OTO would ha ve done with the Gnostic Libr ary disco vered at Nag Hammadi by Egyptian Bedouins in 1945, two years before Crowley’s death. However, the library was not published until 1978; thus , the Mass was not influenced by any of its previously unknown texts. Originally intended by Crowley as the central ceremony of the OTO , both public and priv ate, the Gnostic Mass is a rite conducted toda y by the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica (“ ECG ”—the Gnostic Catholic Church) and celebr ated regularly in major cities ar ound the w orld. Evidently, visitors are usually welcome, provided they are willing to partake of the gnostic eucharist. The EGC is a religious body whose history and structure overlap that of the OTO . Par sons became involved with the OTO when an unknown scien- tific colleague took the r ocketeer to a meeting at Smith’ s house in Hollywood, after which Parsons and his wife, Helen, began attending the various meetings of the lodge, as well as the weekly performance of the Gnostic Mass . The “Chur ch of Thelema,” which Smith had incorporated for this purpose, used the Gnostic Mass as a r ecruiting ground for the OTO . 34 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"In the OTO Par sons had found a ne w outlet for his r omantic notions.

Its German name is Orientalischer Templer-Orden (Oriental Order of Templars), and there is purportedly a secr et meaning to the letter s “ OTO ” as w ell. The occultic or der’s highest gr ades ar e said to inv olve w orking with “tantric” exercises, usually referred to as sex magic. Publicly the Ordo Templi Orientis claims descent from some of the great her etical mo vements such as the Ba varian Illuminati, the Rosicrucians, the Albigensians and Cathars, the Knights Templar, and various early gnostic sects. These claims are very helpful, for they aid in placing the OTO within a proper historical context, as we can guess much about it fr om its spiritual for ebears. However, it is also desir- able to learn about the secular origins of the OTO as well. The Order traces its modern origins to tw o men: Carl K ellner and Theodor Reuss (pronounced “Royce”). Kellner, born September 1, 1851, was a wealthy Austrian industrialist who had made a good bit of mone y as a paper chemist. Reuss was born June 28, 1855 in Augsburg, Germany, about 15 miles northwest of Munich. Both men were born not long after the German Revolution of 1848, and thus lived in a world of Prussian mil- itary expansion. Borders changed often during their lifetimes. At various points throughout the men’s lives, Austria and Germany were intermit- tently a part of Prussia, then a major w estern power. Reuss became a Mason in 1876, and w as also a singer, journalist and possible sp y for the Prussian police . It is alleged that he infil- trated the Socialist League founded by Karl Marx’s daughter and her husband. It is inter esting to note ho w many famous occultists ar e said to have had connections with intelligence organizations, the mil- itary, and the police , such as R euss, Crowley, Parsons, John Dee , Grady McMurtry, Anton LaVey, Michael Aquino, to name a few. Reuss was also w orking on a r evival of the Ba varian Illuminati, dispersed nearly 1 00 years earlier, and w as at the same time the Grand Master of the S wedenborgian Rite in German y, as w ell as a Magus of the Societas Rosicruciana (“Rosicrucian Society”). 37 A Short History of the OTO"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Kellner was an initiate of the influential Hermetic Br otherhood of Light ( HBL ), founded by P.B. Randolph around 1870. The history of the HBL is not germane to our story , but its rites included sacr ed applications of sexual energy, and Crowley names the HBL in writing as the sour ce of the OTO ’s “secret,” which is se xual in natur e. The reader desiring mor e information on the Hermetic Br otherhood of Light is directed to Allen Greenfield’s published history of the order, listed in the bibliography herein. Kellner was also a high-r anking Freemason and a student of the Eastern mysteries. In the 1890s , Kellner claimed to ha ve met thr ee adepts from the East. One was a Sufi, Soliman ben Aifa, and the other two were Hindu tantrik as, Bhima Sena Pr atapa of Lahor e, and Sri Mahatma Agamya Paramahamsa. After their meeting, Kellner alleged he had found a “K ey” (German: Schlüssel ) to “the My steries,” the heart of esoteric rites. The word KEY turns up so many times in the telling of this tale that it reminds one of the pulp publisher Ray Palmer, who always said he had a FACT which proved the validity of Richard Shaver’s wild Dero tales. It’s as if the word itself has a hidden meaning. Kellner’s Key, of course, was sex magic; perhaps the implication was key-in-lock sex- ual symbolism. In 1895, Kellner proposed to Reuss that they disseminate this new- found Key thr ough an or ganized masonic rite . Kellner planned a reformation of the Hermetic Br otherhood of Light in German y, a series of three degrees that would be open only to the highest-r ank- ing masons. Reuss used his masonic connections to acquire the 90th and 96th degrees of the Ancient and Primitiv e Rite of Memphis and Mizraim, and the 33r d degree of the Ancient and A ccepted Scottish Rite, from John Yarker, a masonic historian in England. Despite its initial association, the OTO eventually retreated from Masonry, begin- ning with Crowley, who abandoned any claim to “make” Masons.

Things seem to have been finalized somewhat within the Order in 190 2, at which time the Memphis-Mizr aim degrees were acquired. Initiations began, but students who adv anced were often shocked at the r evelation of the K ey; other s r eportedly found it absurd, and man y left the as-y et unnamed or der.

Reuss, who had already taken the lead role, was fully in charge now, and it was apparently he who chose the name Ordo Templi Orientis, since the appellation e vidently did not e xist before 1905. As to the significance of the name, the east (Orientis), of cour se, is where the sun rises, and is also where Kellner found his Key. Within this body of adepts , R euss w as kno wn v ariously as “Merlin” and “Peregrinus,” and it w as he who set up the 1 0-degree structure of the OTO that remains in place today. He also wrote vari- ous rituals for each degr ee, but most of these ar e no longer in use , having been replaced by those of Crowley. Several famous occultists were chartered by Reuss to operate OTO lodges, including R udolf Steiner (186 1–1925), founder of Anthroposophy, who w as charter ed for a German lodge in 1906, although some of his spiritual descendants pr efer to ignore this fact today. Dr. Gerard Encausse (1865–1916), better known as Papus, was chartered in France in 1908. The absorption of the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica formed another link betw een the P apus lineage and the modern OTO . A Dr. Arnold Krumm-Heller (1879–1949), also known by the Aztec name Huiracocha, was chartered for all of Latin America, but he never took the Order any further there and it seems to have died out. The use of Aztec names is still a practice among well-to-do Mexicans today. Aleister Crowley joined the OTO in 1910, thinking it w as just one of many other Eastern masonic lodges . He seems to ha ve collected degrees fr om initiating bodies lik e some people collect postage stamps, and had been initiated all the w ay to the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite in Mexico some 10 years earlier. He had also been initi- ated into the 90th and 95th degrees of the Memphis-Mizraim Rite by the same John Yarker who had giv en the 90th and 96th degr ees of that rite to Reuss. The OTO was just another order like any other—or so Crowley thought. The famous story concerning Cr owley’s initiation into the higher mysteries of the order goes like this: Crowley’s Book of Lies was pub- lished in 1912, at which time he was an honorary VII ° member of the OTO (and rather disappointed about it at that). After reading the book, Reuss appr oached Cr owley angrily, accusing the latter of ha ving revealed the secret of the highest degr ee of the Or der, i.e., the IX °. 39 A Short History of the OTO"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Reuss stated that Cr owley would be compelled to be initiated into that degree immediately, and thus sworn to secrecy. 3 Crowley denied the allegation, so Reuss pointed out the offending passage to him. Crowley would say that he instantaneously knew the answer to all the m ysteries, the m ysteries of the OTO and of man y other spiritual traditions as well: He had the Key. It is unclear what chapter of Crowley’s book contained the passage that had riled Reuss. Robert Anton Wilson, popular author and writer of our introduction, says in Cosmic Trigger that it was chapter 69, but the most likely candidate appears to be chapter 36, the Star Sapphire, which is named in Crowley’s De Arte Magica as containing the secret of the OTO . In reading some of the other chapter s (15, e.g.) in The Book of Lies , it is difficult to believe that Crowley did not at least sus- pect the Key before his meeting with Reuss. Regardless, Crowley was given the IX ° in 1912, and the entire writ- ten corpus of the Or der was at his disposal. He w ould soon r ewrite almost everything within it to bring it into line with his o wn magical discoveries. On April 21, 1912, Crowley was given the X ° and authority over the entire British Isles. His own magical record says he learned the Key in June of that year, in actuality a reference to when he translated the documents from German into English. In 19 16, Crowley appointed Charles Stansfeld Jones, whom we have already met as Frater Achad, to be his Viceroy to North America. Jones’ X ° name was Parzival. On May 10, 1921, Reuss chartered Jones as Head of the OTO for North America, but Crowley overturned this action after succeeding Reuss. Too many other charters and degrees were granted by the OTO to relate here. One of interest, although not part of our story, was to H. Spencer Lewis, founder of the Ancient and Mystical Order of the Rosy Cross ( A.M.O.R.C. ), i.e., “the Rosicrucians.” Lewis was given a docu- ment referred to as a “Gage of Amity” in 192 1, and his mail-or der mystery school San Jose , California, still thriv es toda y, e vidently without possessing the Key. In 1917, Crowley rewrote the OTO degrees again, especially the lower ones, removing most of the masonic material and r eplacing it with thelema (explained below). Reuss was in agreement, but other lodges would not be . In 192 0, Reuss translated Crowley’s Gnostic Mass into German and began to tr anslate Liber AL as well, until he had a stroke in the spring of that year. Crowley then assumed an act- ing role as head of the OTO until November 27, 1921, at which time 40 sex and r ockets 3.

Reuss died on October 28, 1923. There were other orders that, although not a part of the OTO , were officially associated with it, man y of which w ere not pr epared to accept thelema when it was finally revealed to them by Crowley at a German conference in 1925. Readers interested in the histories of the various orders and br eakaway groups are referred to The Equinox , vol. III, no. 10, and the various online histories of the Order. As noted, in 19 14 the A gape Lodge had been founded in Vancouver by Jones, AKA Achad/Parzival, under Crowley’s authority. Crowley visited the lodge in 19 15, at which time he met Wilfr ed Smith, who had been a charter member of the Agape Lodge. The two got along well at that point. Fifteen years later, in 1930, Crowley sent Smith to Los Angeles with the express intent of opening another lodge , also to be called A gape Lodge. The lodge was incorporated April 4, 1934, and its first meeting was held on September 21, 1935 in Hollywood. Smith was appointed as “Head” for the United States, for which office he bore the X ° name “Ramaka.” In 1941, Grady McMurtry (October 18, 1918–July 12, 1985) was first initiated into the OTO by Wilfred Smith at Agape Lodge No. 2. In 1943, Crowley gr anted McMurtry the IX ° and the magical motto of “Hymenaeus Alpha,” in England, wher e the latter was stationed dur- ing the war. McMurtry worked with Army Ordnance during World War II, served in Korea and retired a major. Today he is better remembered as the second Caliph of the OTO , while Karl Germer was the first Caliph, though he never used that term. The thir d Caliph, Hymenaeus Beta, has been Outer Head of the Order since McMurtry’s death in 1985.

The fiv e lower grades correspond to the “ chakras,” i.e., yogic/tantric energy centers, as well as to the “naked-eye” planets. Higher degrees are by invitation only. Most people are surprised to learn the VII °requires a vow of chastity. There is also an XI ° that is not part of the formal structure but was developed by Crowley. As noted, Crowley rewrote the OTO degrees, replacing the masonic material with what he called “thelema.” Thelema is the Gr eek for “will,” a word important in the work of Aleister Crowley for several reasons. In 1904, Cr owley “received” The Book of the La w, techni- cally called Liber AL vel Legis , through the mediumship of his fir st wife, Rose Kelly, while the couple was in Cairo celebrating their hon- eymoon. The book was allegedly dictated by a discarnate entity call- ing himself Aiwass, also spelled Aiwaz before Crowley changed it for numerological reasons. One of the precepts contained in The Book of the Law (abbreviated “ AL ”) is, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the la w” (see AL III :13). Its oft-cited complement is, “Love is the law, love under will.” These two precepts are standard salutations for members of the OTO even toda y. The w ords for “will” and “lo ve” in Gr eek— thelema ( θελημα ) and agape ( αγαπη ), respectively—each have numerical val- ues of 93, a number important in Crowley’s system of magick. These phrases carry with them a great duty to live deliberately, to find one’s True Will and then do it and nothing else. Outsiders often interpret them as invitations to “free love,” but that definition is not necessarily so. Ho wever, the w ord agape is a r eference not only to “charitable love” but also to the “lo ve feasts” of the second-century Christians, especially as interpreted by the Christian Gnostics, which did include a se xual meaning. The A gape Lodge w as not called “Agape” for nothing. A Rosicrucian or der, the Golden Da wn—used as the basis for Crowley’s “Astrum × Argenteum” magick al gr ading s ystem—was modeled more after the mystery schools of the ancients, with the pur- pose of taking the candidate for initiation thr ough a series of m ysti- cal exercises and ritual ceremonies. 42 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Around 1887, a manuscript in cipher was found in a bookstore by a Dr. Woodman and/or Woodford.

The manuscript consisted of rituals and analy ses of the T arot cards, as w ell as the addr ess of a F räulein Sprengel in Nur emberg, Germany. Upon being contacted by them, Anna Sprengel, as “Sapiens Dominabitur Astris” [Wise Mistress of the Stars?], sent the three men a charter for a ne w lodge in England: the Isis-Ur ania Lodge of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Da wn, which opened on Mar ch 20, 1888.

The English were on their own for now, but they felt assured that they had already received sufficient information to place them in contact with the mysterious “Secret Chiefs” of the Order. Subsequently W oodman died, and in 1897 W estcott stepped down. Mathers began claiming to ha ve made contact with thr ee of the Secret Chiefs, a doubtful assertion. Mather s also soon started to work on his greatest achievement, the translation of The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage , which he had found in manu- script in a P aris library, the Bibliotheque l’Arsenal . This document explains how one may attain to the “Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.” Crowley w as initiated into the Or der of the Golden Da wn on November 18, 1898, at the age of 23. This was his first initiation, and he took it with all seriousness. Many famous writers were also mem- bers of the Golden Dawn: Arthur Edward Waite, William Butler Yeats, and Arthur Machen, to name a fe w. Oscar Wilde’ s wife Constance was a member, as was Yeats’ mistress Florence Farr, an actress who was also the mistress of George Bernard Shaw.

The idea of the pr ogression through grades in the Golden Da wn was seen mor e as a teaching tool, some what like the Scottish Rite degrees of the Freemasons. A broad, religious order modeled after the Rosicrucians, the Golden Dawn, and subsequently Crowley’s A ∴ A ∴ , are designed to bring the student to full spiritual potential in all areas. The OTO , on the other hand, was conceived as a specialized rite to convey the Key that Kellner had discovered in the East. It then gr ew into a quasi-masonic initiating body , though the lo wer grades were initially granted honorarily to Masons in good standing with other lodges, and w ould subsequently be “de-masonized” b y Cr owley. Unlike the OTO , the focus of the Golden Da wn was not se xual in nature, although Crowley later used sex magic for the purposes of his own continued self-initiation.

Another member broke away later to form the Stella Matutina (“Morning Star”). In addition, Mathers had been caught in his lie with Westcott regarding the e xistence of the Germans , and all the inner turmoil broke up the remaining order quite quickly, a development Crowley attributed to occult forces coming down on Mathers in retribution for his having publishing the Abramelin book.

For example, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Dr. C.G. Abbot, stated: A few hundr ed thousand dollars invested today in the scientific development of rockets would pay the nation dividends amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars in the next two decades. World-renowned pilot Charles Lindbergh opined: The rocket offers the only known possibility of sending instruments to altitudes above those r eached by sounding balloons. Observations taken outside of the ear th’s atmosphere or even in the higher levels of the atmosphere, would be of immense value in the study of such subjects as astr onomy, meteorology and terres- trial magnetism. And Dr. John O . Ste wart, Associate Pr ofessor of Astr onomical Physics, Princeton University, declared: With rockets speeds of 1000 miles per hour are possible by 1950. By 2050 a rocket trip to the moon at 25,000 miles per hour is not impossible. Despite such open-mindedness in the w orld at lar ge, within the GALCIT group, all was not well, and Malina found reason to complain about Parsons and Forman again in a letter of April 7, 1940. The com- plaint had nothing to do with P arsons’ ne wfound inter est in the occult, which Forman seems to have shared to a lesser degree. Malina had his o wn unorthodoxies, including communism. Malina’ s mind was on more mundane matters. He wrote, “Need a good ph ysicist. 47 Parso ns’ Double Life: 1940–1942"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Forman and Parsons are all right for some types of work, sometimes they are like inventors, in the worst sense of the word.” This instance is the very last time Parsons is mentioned in an y of Malina’s letters home, except when his name appear s with the other s on a list of Aer ojet founders. The break between the two was complete, although Par sons may not have realized it. Parsons remained with Forman, but Malina was with Summerfield, who joined the group that July. Later, Forman’s widow would relate that her husband and Parsons thought Malina was unnecessarily “cold and arrogant” toward them. In August 1940, Popular Mechanics devoted six pages to the work of Parsons and F orman in an article entitled, “Seeking P ower for Space Rockets,” which is informativ e and well-illustrated. Malina is also mentioned but not pictured. A shorter article, “New Experiments with Rockets,” appeared the following month in Popular Science and is also w ell-illustrated but ends with a discussion of the w ork of Robert Goddard and the potential military applications for r ockets. They ar e r eproduced in the pages that follo w. Only P arsons and Forman are featured, which speaks well to their level of involvement at this time. While Malina was head of the project in name by virtue of his status at Caltech, Parsons and Forman were the ones doing the dirty work. Also in 1940, the United States started sending ammunition and supplies to England, embar going Japan. Pr esident Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his Congress increased defense spending 800%, fr om $1.9 billion to $17 billion. Von Kármán began making frequent trips to Washington, D.C, trips that w ould continue throughout the war. The city of Pasadena had 13,300 people working in the aircraft indus- try that year, a figure that may sound like a lot, but by the next year— after the United States entered the war—it had increased to 113,000. In order to recruit so many workers, Boy Scouts were hired to dis- tribute job applications door-to-door. In that year, von Kármán and Malina demonstrated on paper the feasibility of long-dur ation burns in a confined space such as a rocket motor casing, a procedure that von Kármán later listed as the first critical step in the development of rockets in the United States. As a result, the National Academy of Sciences immediately doubled the GALCIT group’s budget for 194 1, to $22,000. This action infuri- ated Goddard, working alone in Roswell, as he didn’t appreciate the young upstarts getting all the funding and attention.

At this time, Parsons received recognition and accolades not only in the aerospace industry but also in his personal life. One of the peo- ple in P arsons’ new esoteric cir cle of friends w as the actr ess Jane Wolfe, who had appeared in the silent films, The Woman Next Door (1919), Men, Women and Money (1919), and Behold My Wife (1920). Wolfe, who had chosen the magical name Soror Estai, had been with Crowley at Cefalu (his “ Abbey of Thelema” in Italy) befor e coming back to California and the A gape Lodge, when Mussolini closed the Abbey. After her return she does not appear in any of the film guides. Adding to the Parsons’ legend, Wolfe recorded her first impression of him in her “magical record” for December 1940: Unknown to me, John Whiteside Parsons, a newcomer , began astral travels. This knowledge decided Regina [Kahl] to under take similar work. All of which I lear ned after making my own decision. So the time must be propitious. Incidentally, I take Jack Parsons to be the child who “shall behold them all” [i.e., the Mysteries of The Book of the Law . See AL I:54-56, below]. 26 years of age, 6 ′ 2 ′′ , vital, potentially bisexual at the very least, University of the State of Califor nia and Cal Tech., now engaged in Cal Tech chemical laboratories developing “bigger and better” explo- sives for Uncle Sam. Travels under sealed orders from the govern- ment. Writes poetr y—”sensuous only,” he says. Lover of music, which he seems to know thor oughly. I see him as the r eal succes- sor of Therion [Crowley]. Passionate; and has made the vilest analy- ses r esult in a species of exaltation after the event. Has had mystical experiences which gave him a sense of equality all r ound, although he is hierarchical in feeling and in the established or der. The passage in Cr owley’s The Book of the Law to which W olfe refers (AL I:54-56) reads, “Change not as much as the style of a let- ter; for behold! Thou, o prophet, shalt not behold all these mysteries hidden therein. The child of thy bowels, he shall behold them. Expect him not from the East, nor from the West; for from no expected house cometh that child.” At 26, Parsons was still a “child” in the eyes of the older members, at least in the spiritual sense, regarded by Wolfe as this “chosen one,” so to speak. 55 Parso ns’ Double Life: 1940–1942"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Par sons’ “mystical experiences,” if they were recorded then, have since been lost and are unknown. For sake of comparison to Wolfe’s portrayal, Parsons’ FBI file describes him as 6 ′ 1 ′′ , 185 pounds , with brown hair and brown eyes, medium build, and fair complexion. The remark “potentially bisexual at the very least” may refer to his admit- ted attraction to Smith, as well as to another unique characteristic: at least two former work associates have said that Parsons sweated pro- fusely, which caused str ong body odor that he tried to mask with heavy cologne. A man who wore a lot of cologne at the same time that he displayed an above-average interest in another man may have inad- vertently given the impr ession of bise xuality. Parsons himself once expressed a latent homosexuality, and Aleister Crowley, Parsons’ new idol, was well known for his bisexuality. Like many other A gape Lodge member s, Wolfe was also in the A ∴ A ∴ . Crowley had initiated her at Cefalu as a Probationer 0°=0 on June 11, 1921, and had further recognized her as a Neophyte 1°=10 in May 1940, after she had written him to lament her long term as a Probationer. Wolfe was not the last to identify P arsons’ potential. After mor e than a y ear of attending meetings and the Gnostic Mass , John and Helen Parsons joined the A gape Lodge on F ebruary 15, 1941, when they simultaneously joined the A ∴ A ∴ . Just a fe w weeks after the y joined, in March 1941, Smith wrote to Crowley, “I think I have at long last a really excellent man, John Parsons. And starting ne xt Tuesday he begins a course of talks with a view to enlarging our scope. He has an excellent mind and much better intellect than m yself . . . John Par sons is going to be valuable.” Par sons became “F rater T.O.P.A.N.” and w as known as “F rater 210” for short. His wife became “Sor or Grimaud.” The initials in Par sons’ magical motto stood for Thelemum Obtentum Pr ocedero Amoris Nuptiae , Latin for “the obtainment of thelema —Will— through the nuptials of love.” The initials T.O.P.A.N. were also a dec- laration of Parsons’ dedication: To Pan. In Hebrew the enumeration for T.O.P.A.N. is 400+7 0+80+1+50=601. Parsons counted it as I.O.P.A.N., giving the mor e desirable sum 210, with “Io P an” being Greek for “Hail P an.” Indeed, Cr owley’s “Hymn to P an,” which Par sons had memorized and often recited, begins, “Io Pan! Io Pan Pan!” The numbers 1 through 20 add to 210. In the book 777 Cr owley also speaks of certain number s important to each of the sephiroth (spheres) of the k abbalistic Tree of Life. The first has the v alue 1, the second 1+2 =3, the third 1+2+3=6, and so on; there are 10 56 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"altogether. Although Cr owley does not sa y so, a little quick math will show these 10 values add to 210. In 777 Crowley calls the mean- ing of 210 “too holy” to divulge, an allusion to the “ N.O.X. formula.” N.O.X. , Latin for “night,” is akin to “ L.V.X. ” or “Lux”—light. Both are portrayed during simple rituals of Cr owley’s that came fr om the Golden Dawn. Coincidentally, the interstate highway running through Pasadena which makes a 90-degree turn due north of the beginning of South Orange Grove Ave., heading str aight to JPL, is numbered 210, as if some cosmic force numbered the highway in Parsons’ honor. Helen’s chosen name, Grimaud, is a F rench name that may refer to a character in one of Lord Bulwer-Lytton’s novels who acted as a “magical servitor.” Bulwer-Lytton is probably most famous for ha v- ing started a novel with the phrase, “It was a dark and stormy night.” Eventually, Parsons came to vie w Smith as the father he alw ays wanted, and the two stayed in touch throughout their lives, despite the many problems between them and with other member s of the lodge. While man y member s of the A gape Lodge drifted apart, Par sons and Smith continually came back to each other , and, although Parsons called Crowley “Father” in his many letters to him, the immediate presence of Smith was much more powerful. In addition, P arsons’ inter est in science fiction continued into adulthood, and he attended many of the weekly meetings of the Los Angeles Science F antasy Society ( LASFS ), which met Thur sday evenings. LASFS started as chapter 4 of the Science Fiction League , one of many fan clubs begun in 1934 when Hugo Gernsback’ s mag- azine Wonder Stories announced the ne w program. All closed but chapter 4, which r emained a vital concern due to the w ork of one man—Forrest J. A ckerman. Ackerman has said that he r emembers meeting Parsons once, though others insist he must have met him on many occasions. Helen Parsons Smith remembers at least one meeting. In 1940, Ackerman’s group became the independent LASFS , which, as home base for Los Angeles-area fans and writers, was quite active. JPL archivist John Bluth hear d that many science fiction people fr e- quented Parsons’ house, but it was less common for Parsons to go to the LASFS . He was thus probably not a member, just an attendee. At one of the Thursday meetings in 1941, Parsons met one of his favorite author s, Jack Williamson, who r ecords this meeting in Wonder’s Child , his autobiogr aphy. Williamson had written Darker Than You Think , which first appeared in the magazine Unknown in 1940, and was expanded considerably in 1948 for the book edition. 57 Parso ns’ Double Life: 1940–1942"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"In Wonder’s Child , Williamson wr ote, “He [P arsons] had r ead my novel Darker Than You Think , which deals with the supernatur al.

Williamson subsequently w ent to P arsons’ house for one of the Sunday afternoon meetings of fans and writer s that P arsons spon- sored every week. He recorded the event in Wonder’s Child : I met John Parsons. An odd enigma to me, he was a r ocket engi- neer with unexpected leanings towar d the occult. He wanted to meet me because I’d written Darker Than You Think —a good many people have taken it mor e seriously than I ever did; witches now and then have taken me for a fellow Wiccan. Parsons belonged to the OTO , an underground order founded, I think, by the satanist Aleister Crowley. One night Cleve Cartmill and I were allowed to climb after him into an attic to attend a secr et meeting. The ritual was disappointingly tame. Ther e was no nude virgin on the altar. Satan was not invoked. Yet the priest impressed me. He was a lean, dynamic little man with bright, light blue eyes, driven by a vir ulent hatr ed of God. Talking to him after the ceremony, I found that he was the son of a British clergyman who must have been the r eal target of that sav- age animosity. From the above description it sounds as if Williamson got to meet Wilfred Smith. Darker Than You Think is the story of her editary werewolves who have discovered their true bestial nature and seek to revive the old ways and the old gods. They accomplish this revival under the leadership of the “Child of Night,” who is the r esult of a magical pr odigious birth, finding him in the char acter of Will Barbee. Williamson’s first science fiction treatment of werewolves (a novel approach at the time) had been in 1932, when he wrote the short story, “Wolves of Darkness.” The connection to Wicca and neo-paganism is obvious , as is the parallel to Parsons’ magical “Babalon Working,” which will be the subject of chapters 7 and 8.

Several other authors visited Parsons, including A.E. Van Vogt, as well as regulars like writer Alva Rogers and science fiction illus- trator Lou Goldstone . Another possible visitor w as E. Hoffman Price, a would-be writer who knew most of the people in the circle of H.P. Lovecraft, the famous fantasy and horror writer, as well as in much of science fiction fandom. Price later br agged of having introduced occult ideas to Lo vecraft, whose tr eatments of Theosophical elements are well documented in his letters to Price, thus revealing that some of the material did indeed originate with the latter.

In this essay, Adam Rostoker wrote, “Parsons and Heinlein were quite close friends . They may have met at the Los Angeles Science Fiction Fan Club [Science Fantasy Society], which maintained a reading room . . . [They] were certainly seen there together.” In a footnote he related that Marjorie Cameron, Parsons’ second wife, was the source of this information: “Heinlein was the first person Parsons ever introduced her to. She didn’t care for Heinlein too much; he was ‘too slick, too Hollywood. But Jack and he were good friends.’” Adam Rostoker is the same “Adam Walks-Between-Worlds” of the Church of All Worlds which w as inspired by Heinlein’s Stranger in a Str ange Land . He may have published a similar article in that or ganization’s Green Egg magazine. Williamson documents science writer and member of the German Rocket Society Willy Le y’s occasional pr esence at meetings of the Mañana Literary Society, an informal science fiction discussion group which met at Heinlein’s house, so Parsons may have met his old cor- respondent there—assuming he was in fact a part of Heinlein’s circle. Meanwhile, in P arsons’ other life , the GALCIT group realized its first big success in August 1941. Parsons had come to realize that the rocket motors, now called jet-assisted tak e-offs ( JATO s) to avoid the charged term “rocket,” had to be used almost immediately , as they could not be stor ed for long periods of time or in e xtremes of tem- perature. He and F orman would get up v ery early and pr epare the JATO s, nap a little, then meet the others at March Field. Von Kármán wrote, “He [P arsons] used a paper-lined c ylinder into which he pressed a black-po wder propellant of his o wn composition in one- inch layers.” In August, the group was ready to test Parsons’ JATO s on actual aircraft, the first time this type of rocket had ever been used. The fuel used was called GALCIT -27, implying 26 failures before it. The airplane chosen was a hobby plane called the “Ercoupe,” chosen because it was small, light and har d to stall. The pilot w as Captain Homer A. Boushey, Jr. of the Army Air Corps, a graduate student of von Kármán’s. Also pr esent was another gr aduate student, Homer Joe Stewart, to whom was addressed a signed copy of Frank Malina’s memoirs in the possession of the JPL archives. The GALCIT -27 event was recorded on color film, a copy of which resides in the Libr ary of Congr ess. The silent original, along with some outtakes, is in the JPL archives.

The tw o corre- sponded until Weld’s death in 1961. Par sons was right about using the JATO s immediately, and, on August 6, 1941, one week after some nerv e-wracking static tests in which the JATO s “exploded like the Fourth” 12 of the r ockets were mounted under the wings of the Er coupe. The JATO s each delivered 28 pounds of thrust for 12 seconds—336 pounds thrust total. The group had never seen a plane climb so steeply. The film clearly shows the plane leveling off immediately when the JATO s’ fuel supply w as exhausted. The JATO s were a success, and Parsons was to credit. Some of the footage w as shot fr om the air , in Clark Millik an’s small plane. The gr ound footage sho wing the Er coupe taking off alongside Millikan’s plane r eveals quite dr amatically the differ ence the JATO s made: Takeoff distance was reduced over 30%. During one of the tests a nozzle shot off the end of a JATO , bounced off the run- way, and tore a hole in the plane’s fuselage near the tail. “At least it wasn’t a big hole ,” one of the gr oup joked. Undaunted, the pilot Boushey continued flying. The tests also continued, running until August 12. The JATO s were envisioned for use wher ever short runways were constructed. If the Army Air Corps were in some remote locale with rough terrain or lots of tr ees, a short run way would save the labor and expense of a lot of men. The second use was for quick getaways in the air. If an enemy plane came up behind a pilot who had JATO s, the latter could ignite the r ockets and get out of the enem y’s line of fire. Footage of this sort of maneuv er is also included in the A ugust 1941 film. Hap Arnold’s original idea to utilize the JATO s to help over- loaded aircraft take off was not a part of the tests, though it was put to use during the war.

This photo is usually referred to as the “technical group.” Why was Summerfield there? His specialty was liquid-fuel rockets, and this was a solid fuel test. And where was Parsons? He was always referred to as the “theoretician,” with Forman being the mechanic. Parsons is in a separate photo, with the “flight test cr ew”: Fred Miller (an “ explosives technician”), Ed Forman, Malina, Boushey, and a couple of Air Force mechanics.

Well, he was very vague and I couldn’t get anything out of Parsons or Forman as to why this had happened . . .

Forman never did join the A gape Lodge, but Par sons and he w ere very close and ma y easily ha ve been sharing Par sons’ occult endeavors. The individual was released into Malina’s custody, and the whole incident w as kept quiet, simply because of the work going on at the school. W ar was imminent (the attack on Pearl Harbor was only a month away); there was no need to disrupt Caltech’s work with an embarrassing detail like this. Meanwhile, at the lodge Parsons was becoming increasingly influ- ential. In March of 1942, Jane Wolfe wrote to Crowley: I believe Jack Parsons—who is devoted to Wilfr ed [Smith]—to be the coming leader, with Wilfred in advisory capacity. I hope you two get together some day, although your present activities in England seem to have postponed the date of your coming to us [which never happened].

There are apocryphal stories concerning the inspir ation for his idea, but P arsons seems to ha ve taken the truth with him to the grave. 40 years later Homer Boushey told an International Association of A eronautics and Astr onautics (IAAA) group in Oslo that the idea had come to Parsons while watch- ing some roofers apply hot asphalt. F rank Malina said that P arsons knew of “Greek Fire,” a mixture of pitch and other elements which the ancient Greeks used as flaming projectiles, hurling them at enemy ships during w ars. However, Helen Parsons told an intervie wer the idea had originated with her. As early as 1928, Parsons and Forman had used glue as a binder to hold their black powder and aluminum oxide in their little rocket motors. In 1942 Parsons had the idea to use liquid asphalt for this purpose. The asphalt w as heated, then the fuel and the o xidizer were mixed in, and the mixture was poured directly into the casing rather than an intermediate molding and allo wed to cool. Dubbed GALCIT -53, the mixture did not shrink and crack as had earlier mix- tures. 4 The new JATO s could be stored indefinitely, at either extreme of temperature, without the threat of explosion during use—and they could now be mass-produced. After Parsons left Aerojet, it was dis- covered that a hollow could be created in the center of the hardened fuel to provide increased surface area and thus an increased burning rate. At first they used a simple c ylindrical shape, then later a star shape to further increase the surface area. This method was used in the Minuteman and Polaris missiles. Mark M. Mills and F red S. Miller assisted P arsons with his w ork on the GALCIT -53 JATO s, which delivered 200 pounds of thrust for eight seconds—a 476% impr ovement o ver GALCIT -27. P arsons invented the method of pouring the heated, liquefied pr opellant, which involved priming the empty casing first with a little bit of the liquefied solution, letting it cool just enough to start to har den, and then pouring the r emainder of the fuel inside . This method is still used today on the solid fuel boosters used on the Space Shuttle. Par sons also had the equally monumental idea to start using potassium perchlorate as an oxidizer, instead of aluminum and oth- ers. Successful v ariations on this idea included use of ammonium perchlorate for the same purpose. Potassium perchlorate was actually listed in the paper P arsons wrote at Antelope V alley for Halifax in 72 sex and r ockets 4.

What brought him back to it in 1942 is unkno wn. These br eakthroughs led to the formation of the A erojet Corporation on March 19, 1942, now one of the world’s largest man- ufacturers of r ockets. The founder s w ere v on Kármán, Malina, Summerfield, Parsons, Forman, and von Kármán’s attorney Andrew Haley. Parsons and Forman had the idea to get a sponsor or form a corporation; Malina w as the one who pr oposed the idea to v on Kármán. Each put in $200, though Haley actually loaned all but von Kármán their share. Haley ended up putting in $2500, with the under- standing that the others would pay him back later. The five assigned all future patents to the compan y, and Malina and Hale y came up with the name Aerojet. Parsons and Forman immediately left GALCIT for Aerojet. The group still worked on projects together, with Aerojet employees selling their services as consultants to GALCIT . The com- pany grew quickly. Haley seems to have been a hands-on kind of guy, as his interest- ing book, Rocketry and Space Exploration , contains several photos of him working directly with various manufacturing efforts at A erojet. Often he worked in the office by day and in the plant by night. The group’s next big success was with liquid JATO s. Par sons was still trying to find a w ay to use r ed fuming nitric acid ( RFNA ) as an oxidizer with fuels such as gasoline and benzene . RFNA was the chemical that had caused the lar ge explosion—and the big mess— when the Suicide Squad w as just getting started at Caltech. Curr ent tests resulted in motor s that burned but pr oduced uneven burning which led to thr obbing, caused b y late ignition: The fuel did not begin burning immediately on contact with RFNA . Martin Summerfield’s “instability of burning” la w is still used to describe this phenomenon. On a trip east, an acquaintance of Malina’ s suggested using ani- line to help control the burn rate of the mixture and reduce the throb- bing. On the tr ain ride home, Malina suddenly r ealized that RFNA and aniline ought to be self-igniting without the gasoline or benzene . He wired Summerfield back in P asadena, who arranged a test with engineer Walter Powell and others. The event was recorded on film: a small crucible sits on the ground, while a hand reaches in, holding a long pole at the end of which is another small crucible . When the contents of one w ere poured into the other, the mixture did indeed ignite into a huge flame, and the group was on their way to the per- fection of liquid-fuel rockets. 73 Parso ns’ Double Life: 1940–1942"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"With the help of attorne y D. Gordon Angus, Parsons and Malina filed thr ee patents on Ma y 8, 1943 for v arious elements of this process.

Ironically, two of the thr ee patents w ere not gr anted until after P arsons’ death in 1952. The patent numbers are 2,573,471 (“Reaction Motor Operable by Liquid Propellants and Method of Operating It,” patented October 30, 195 1); 2,693,0 77 (a division of patent 2,573,47 1, patented November 2, 1954, but with seemingly little if any difference from the first patent); and 2,774,2 14 (“Rocket Propulsion Method,” patented December 18, 1956, which is basically the same pr oposal submitted under a different category). The group’s acid-aniline mix was used as late as the Titan missile, at which time it was abandoned in favor of liquid oxygen, which had had finally been made manageable . [In an odd “ coincidence,” the Great Beast Aleister Crowley referred to himself as “Teitan,” which is the original Greek spelling of “Titan,” because it adds to 666 in Greek gematria , a form of numerology.] The flight test of the new liquid fuel occurred on April 15, 1942 at Muroc Field in Antelope Valley, site of today’s Edwards Air Force Base. Liquid JATO s were the first Aerojet project. A Douglas A-20A was flown first to the Burbank airport for pr eparations, then to the test field for the liquid JATO tests. The plane weighed 20,000 pounds, as much as sev- eral Ercoupes combined. Major Paul H. Dane of the Arm y Air Corps was the test pilot. Be verly Forman, Ed’s cousin, sat in back of the plane. His job was to release the fuel mixture at the appropriate time. Two 1000-pound thrust JATO s were mounted under the A-20A ’s wings, each with a 25-second burn time. They were designed by Summerfield with the assistance of Walter B. Powell and Edward G. Croft, and had five times the power of GALCIT -53, although solid fuel maintained its value.

At the end of the tests, Malina said, “We now have something that really works and we should be able to help giv e the Fascists hell!” Von Kármán called the de velopment “the beginning of pr actical rocketry in the United States .” The success of the A20 - A test earned the gr oup another budget increase—from $125,000 in 1942 to several times that amount for the coming year, an incredible amount for the work of a few men. However, it was only one area into which the military was channeling lar ge amounts of mone y in pr eparation for the w ar. Designated XLR-1-AJ-1 , over 100 slightly modified liquid JATO units were sold by Aerojet for use on Boeing B36 bombers during the war. Smaller units were also used to help launch Corsairs from aircraft car- riers; it is unclear whether they used liquid or solid fuel. Observing the tests w as Alfred Loedding, sent b y the Arm y Air Corps from Wright Field. Loedding’s later claim to fame w as as the military’s first UFO investigator in 1947: he started Project Sign, which sought to explain away all UFO reports and was the precursor to the Air Force’s better-known Project Blue Book. At Aer ojet Parsons mostly w orked in solid fuels and w as the Project Engineer in charge of the Solid Fuels Department, although he wasn’t actually a degreed engineer. Forman supervised the mechanics’ shop and often went to the arroyo at GALCIT to perform static tests of his improved motors. Malina was working mostly with liquids at this time, which was his friend Summerfield’s specialty. When he would visit the arroyo for tests, he would work out of his car. Aer ojet’s first contract was for a solid JATO for the Navy Bureau of Aer onautics, and their second w as a liquid JATO for the Air craft Laboratory at Wright Field that was used on the Douglas Havoc Attack Bomber. The original Aerojet offices were located on E. Colorado Ave. in Pasadena, but they soon moved to 285 W. Colorado Ave., the site of a former juice v endor.

One time a mechanic cut off Malina’s tie during a visit from Caltech by the latter, because he thought the tie was too formal. One of the pr oject’s engineers from Aerojet, Walt Powell, had a glider he liked to fly, as it helped him r elieve some of the stress. He did this so often that it became a distr action to the group, so Malina took it away and had it locked up. Powell chased Malina with an ax when he discovered what had happened. GALCIT lost many young men to the draft. Project No. 1, however, the official rocket project at Caltech, had a top priority; thus, its men were exempt. The project in the arroyo rated further down the scale. Aer ojet had the same pr oblem, at the same time it w as trying to expand to meet the new demand for its product. Hap Arnold himself had to intervene when Andrew Haley was drafted. Haley was back to Aer ojet within a w eek, where he replaced von Kármán as the com- pany’s president, and w orked hard, demanding that his emplo yees work even harder. They often took pa y cuts when he felt the com- pany couldn’t afford the payroll. Haley went on to become president of the International Aeronautical Federation. He traveled widely, and his book is full of pictures of himself with dignitaries like the Pope. Newcomers to Aerojet were often shocked by the uneducated and inexperienced staff the company had to hire just to have some bod- ies around to do the work. A company photo taken when Aerojet was only one year old shows well over 100 people. Experienced engineers were not interested in rockets, so they had to rely on young inexpe- rienced engineers fresh out of college . Von Kármán later said this arrangement worked out to their adv antage, as the y didn’t ha ve to untrain anybody. Amo Smith came back fr om Douglas Air craft to work at Aerojet with his old classmates, and Fritz Zwicky also joined the company. Zwicky later designed the e xperimental “terrapulse” vehicle, which was intended for drilling deep into the earth to ward its center. To my knowledge, it was never built. Zwicky claimed that when Aerojet first was able to purchase some nitromethane, Parsons stole it and r an some of his o wn tests on it right there on A erojet grounds. Zwicky also claimed that P arsons used to talk all sorts of occult doctrine with the Aerojet secretaries in order to get them into bed. Appar ently, it worked, although Parsons was considered a handsome enough guy that he didn’t need much “smooth talk.” Unwilling to pass up an y lead, Parsons was sent to Ne w York in May of 1942 to observe the work of a man named Maynor, who had written Caltech to tell them about his own rocket project.

On October 16, 1942, Parsons and Mills submitted “The Development of an Asphalt-Base Solid Pr opellant, Report No. 1-15.” The photo of Par sons in a trench coat was taken around this time, on the occasion of a return to the arroyo from Aerojet for some tests. The photo may have been for the 2 00-pound units in the A ugust report, or it ma y have been at the new Aerojet site in Azusa. (See photo section.) After Parsons and Forman went to Aerojet, GALCIT ’s next project was a r ocket car. Malina and Summerfield had r eceived a military contract to test the “Hy drobomb,” which w as a euphemistically- named torpedo. In or der to test the h ydrodynamic properties of the Hydrobomb, the gr oup constructed a 5 00-foot long “to wing chan- nel”—basically a long, shallow pit of water. The rocket car was built on a track above the pit, and the Hy drobomb was mounted on the underside of the rocket car, with liquid JATO s used to propel it 500 feet at 40 mph, a speed compar able to what it w ould experience under- water. Pressure gauges were mounted to the Hydrobomb to measure the effects of its motion thr ough the w ater. Humorously, the tr ack ended right at the project director’s home. The project had problems, however, caused by acoustic instabili- ties in the design of the JATO s. A coustics was a yet-to-be-discovered field and thus w as not r ecognized as the pr oblem. The r ocket car finally self-destructed in a huge blaze during one of the tests, and the project was abandoned. The dr amatic demise of the r ocket car was captured on color film.

In Rocket to the Morgue , Parsons is the character Hugo Chantrelle, to whom White often simply refers as “the goatee.” Ed Forman is his assistant “Gribble,” and Robert Heinlein is “ Austin Carter.” Science fiction writer and future founder of the Church of Scientology L.

While it is obviously a liter ary portrayal rather than a biographical sketch, Rocket to the Morgue cer- tainly depicts the author’s impression of Parsons. White’s statement about Parsons being a member of the F ortean Society, for instance, may not be factual, but certainly P arsons w as inter ested in “Forteana,” the bizarre scientific anomalies found ar ound the globe for millennia and chronicled by the indefatigable Fort. White’s reference to “the time-dreams of Dunne” was repeated else- where in the book and concerns J.W . Dunne’s An Experiment With Time , an odd little v olume first published in 1927. Dunne’ s hypothe- sis, which he supports with lengthy descriptions of his own dreams, is that dreams may often foretell future events. He goes to gr eat lengths to support this with a philosophical discussion of the natur e of time. Austin Carter (Heinlein) w as also quite inter ested in Dunne’ s book, according to White’s dramatization, in which Chantrelle spends much of the time describing his pr emonitions of the murder and other omi- nous events, brought on by his “Extra Sensory Perception,” which he repeats often, or his equally mystical “awareness of past phases of seri- otemporal existence.” Chantrelle mentions Starmaker author Olaf Stapleton as w ell as Fowler Foulkes as tw o science fiction writer s who had impr essed him, possibly favorites of Parsons’ as well. 5 Chantrelle also says that “one of the greatest services science fiction can render to science” is to lead the public gr adually into accepting implausible concepts as fantastic, evidently referring to Parsons’ public acceptance of his own rockets, if this was indeed a comment of his. White’s account of the rocket car is a bit garbled, but the inciden- tal material he documents surrounding the science fiction writers in Southern California at the time is inv aluable to any historian. Based on his description, it is clear he never visited GALCIT to witness a test of the rocket car, nor did he seem to under stand exactly how it was configured. He does make it an interesting plot device, however: it is the mur der w eapon.

Science fiction and fantas y also bridge the tw o seemingly disparate worlds that P arsons occupied, i.e ., the aer ospace industry and the occult. The combination is not so strange, however, as numerous sci- entists, engineers, researchers and other professionals also have had spiritual and religious lives. What is surprising to the average person, however, is that P arsons was apparently so unorthodo x and r ebel- lious, but this “delightful screwball,” as von Kármán called Parsons, was never content with the conventional, ordinary and mundane.

Fleming Mansion was an expensive and exclusive part of Pasadena, called, as noted, “Millionaire’s Mile,” with palm tr ees lining the str eets and flowering magnolias adorning the y ards. There was also a smaller coach house on the grounds, at 1003 1 ⁄ 2 S. Orange Grove Ave., where Wilfred Smith lived. Life in Pasadena in the early ’40s is accur ately portrayed in James Cain’s novel Mildred Pierce , which was made into the film starring Joan Crawford. According to writer Iris Chang, Parsons had a mannequin dressed in a tuxedo on his front porch, upon which he placed a sign sa ying, “The Resident.” Next to the mannequin w as a bucket for the mail- man to place all mail so addressed. Built by its namesake out of redwood around the turn of the cen- tury, the house was modeled after the Norwegian homes of the time. 6 There were 10 bedrooms on three floors in the main house, with sev- eral more bedrooms in the coach house behind it. A small domed portico supported b y six concr ete columns stood in the backy ard. Par sons converted the estate buildings into appr oximately 19 apart- ments. The house was razed in the late 1940s to mak e room for an apartment complex. Fleming, the original owner of the mansion, was a noted philan- thropist and Nobel Prize winner who had made a good deal of money in the Canadian logging industry . He had donated o ver $5 million to Caltech alone and w as the Chairman of its Boar d of Directors. He also owned what would become Yosemite after he sold the acreage to the government at half-price for the purpose of estab- lishing a park, r ather than selling out to commer cial interests who were vying for the land. 83 The Return to South Orange Grove Ave.: 1942–1945 6.

Fleming himself died on A ugust 11, 1940, and the big old house stood v acant until an attorne y named John M. Dean and his wife Dorothy bought the place in 1942. Parsons leased the house fr om Dean, and the A gape Lodge r elocated to “the Par sonage,” as it came to be called. Dean does not sho w up on the membership rosters from that period, but he must ha ve been privy and sympathetic to the lodge’s activities, as he and his wife resided in the house along with P arsons and the other s, according to the 1947 city directory. Par sons’ bedroom upstairs, which was the largest room, doubled as a temple. There was the obligatory copy (handcrafted) of the Stele of Revealing, an Egyptian tablet that had inspired Crowley during his trip in 1904 to Cairo, where it was object number 666 in the Museum of Antiquities. 7 Crowley’s translation of the stele appears in Liber AL , a section of which, AL III :10, requires a copy for ritual purposes. The Par sonage also contained a beautiful libr ary with wood paneling, a large signed portrait of Crowley, hundreds of books on occult matters, and the numerous letters exchanged between Crowley and Parsons. The living r oom contained an e xpensive, modern hi-fi system— Par sons loved to play classical music at very high volume. Par sons lived next to the estate of the late Lilly Anheuser Busch, widow of brewer Adolphus Busch, and the house backed up onto the famous Busch Sunk en Gardens, which w ere beautiful and huge , at least 34 acres in size, by early accounts. By Parsons’ time there were 11 acres left, which is still quite sizable for a well-maintained park in a residential area.

The city briefly considered making the gardens into a park after her death, but the land was sold and subdivided in the late 1950s. Par sons shocked his conservative neighbors when he started rent- ing out r ooms to less-than-desir able tenants. The fr equent visitors, noisy parties, and questionable goings-on raised many eyebrows. One visitor wrote that “tw o women in diaphanous go wns would dance around a pot of fire, surrounded by coffins topped with candles . . . all I could think at the time was that if those robes caught on fire the whole house w ould go up lik e a tinderbo x.” He also said that an opera singer and several astrologers lived in the house.

One of the longtime r esidents of the Parsonage was Alva Rogers, who became associated with the house after attending se veral sci- ence fiction meetings there. During these meetings Rogers soon fell in love with a young artist who roomed there, and visited whenever he could, prior to mo ving in. In a 1962 fanzine article entitled “Darkhouse,” Rogers wrote: In the ads placed in the local paper Jack specified that only bohemians, ar tists, musicians, atheists, anar chists, or other exotic types need apply for r ooms—any mundane soul would be unceremoniously rejected. This ad, needless to say , caused quite a flap in Pasadena when it appeared . . . There was a fine selection of hand-picked tenants, characters all. A few examples: The pr ofessional fortune teller and seer who always wor e appr opriate dr esses and decorated her apar tment with symbols and artifacts of arcane lore; a lady, well past middle- age but still strikingly beautiful, who claimed to have been at vari- ous times the mistr ess of half the famous men in France; a man who had been a r enowned organist for most of the gr eat movie palaces of the silent era. 8 Jack’s library (a lar ge wood paneled r oom graced with a com- fortable leather couch and a couple of leather chairs) was lined with books devoted almost exclusively to the occult, and to the published works of Aleister Cr owley. Dominating the r oom was a large photo-portrait of Crowley affectionately inscribed to Jack. He also had a voluminous correspondence with Crowley in the library, some of which he showed me. I r emember in particular one letter from Crowley which praised and encouraged him for the fine work he was doing in America, and also casually thanked him for his lat- est donation and intimated that mor e would be shor tly needed. Jack admitted that he was one of Crowley’s main sources of money in America. The financial arr angements Rogers mentioned w ere as follo ws: Par sons would forward the money to Karl Germer in New York, who would send it on to Cr owley in England. Germer (January 22, 1885–October 25, 1962) was known in the OTO as “Frater Saturnus.” 86 sex and r ockets 8.

Again, to quote Rogers: Jack was the antithesis of the common image of the Black Magician; in fact he bore little resemblance to his revered Master, Aleister Crowley, either in looks or in his personal conduct. He was a good looking man in his early or mid thirties, urbane and sophis- ticated, and possessed a fine sense of humor . . . I always found Jack’s insistence that he believed in and practiced magic har d to reconcile with his educational and cultural backgr ound. At first I thought it was all fun and games, a kick he was on for its shock value to his r espectable friends; but after seeing his cor respon- dence with Crowley, and the evidence of the fr equent remittances to Crowley, I had to give him the benefit of the doubt. The association becomes easier to r econcile when one consider s Crowley’s own view of magic , presented in Liber O vel Manus et Sagittae : “In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth, and the Paths, of Spirits and Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many other things which may or may not exist. “It is immaterial whether the y exist or not. By doing certain things certain r esults follow; students ar e most earnestly w arned against attributing objective reality or philosophic validity to any of them.” Despite Parsons’ outward appearance, he was the subject of regu- lar public attention and rumor s that he w as the leader of a “black magic cult,” rumor s denied b y his scientific associates , man y of whom were regulars at the house, if not members of one or the other orders. As early as 194 1, Parsons was investigated (at his pr evious residence), but no arrests were made. Rather than any occult activi- ties, this investigation concerned some explosives he was storing at the house, either the tetr anitromethane Malina mentioned, or the gunpowder Forman’s first wife talked about, or both. In 1942, local police came to 1 003 S. Orange Grove to investigate an alleged backy ard cer emony wher ein a pr egnant w oman had reportedly jumped nude through a fire nine times. The police made it clear that the y thought the claim absur d and that the y were only investigating because it was their duty. Parsons easily assured them of his community standing: he was an important rocket scientist with a professional reputation to uphold. Ironically, the ceremony proba- bly took place as described. 87 The Return to South Orange Grove Ave.: 1942–1945"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"A 16-year-old boy reported Parsons to the police , claiming that three of P arsons’ follo wers had for cibly sodomized him during a “Black Mass” at the house . Again the police inv estigated but found Par sons’ “cult” to be little mor e than “an organization dedicated to religious and philosophical speculation, with r espectable members such as a Pasadena bank president, doctors, lawyers, and Hollywood actors.” The actor John Carradine, for example, read one of Crowley’s poems at the inauguration of Agape Lodge No. 2 in 1935. In September 1942, the P asadena police received an anonymous tip via a letter sent by an ex-member of the Agape Lodge bearing the signature “A Real Soldier” and postmark ed San Antonio, Texas that accused P arsons of “black magic and se x or gies.” Once again, Par sons was cleared of all char ges.

Although r ape w as not going on, plenty of other unusual (but legal) things w ere, and the neighbor s just had to learn to live with it. The Pasadena branch of the OTO had its other tr oubles, some of which were caused by Parsons’ and Crowley’s financial go-between, Karl Germer. Germer had arrived in the United States from a German concentration camp and settled in Ne w York. His stated goal was to work on building up the OTO in his new country; in actuality he did the opposite. Germer took a par anoid dislike to Wilfred Smith, per- haps because he saw him as a competitor for the lead position, and began a smear campaign, constantly writing Cr owley about Smith’s activities in the worst possible light. Wilfred Smith had a r eputation as a w omanizer which equaled that of Crowley, who viewed his own succession of “Scarlet Women” as a necessary magical aid. Smith’s affairs, however, seemed to be an opportunity for Germer to deride him. Ov er 200 letters exchanged between Crowley and Smith during this period have been preserved, letters that evidently document the slo w but steady deterior ation of the relationship between Crowley and Smith.

Ironically, considering the “Gr eat Beast’s” own salacious reputa- tion, Crowley wrote Smith that he was giving the OTO “the reputation of being that slim y abomination ‘a lo ve cult.’ Already in 19 15 in Vancouver, all I knew of you was that you were running a mother and her daughter in double harness—since then one scandal has followed another.” Crowley himself w as no str anger to scandal. In fact, he himself had had a number of children by different women. This “black magi- cian,” as he came to be considered in his native England, eventually committed many blasphemies against Christianity , which, after his wretched childhood, he set out to destr oy and r eplace with “Crowleyanity” and his “La w of Thelema,” which he truly hoped would sweep the world. Married to Rose Kelley, whose brother Gerald would become the Knighted Pr esident of London’ s R oyal A cademy, Cr owley liv ed a leisurely life because of a large sum of money his father left him. He was an imposing figur e and the beneficiary of numer ous unusual adventures. One night of his and R ose’s honeymoon, for e xample, was spent in the so-called King’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid, dur- ing which Crowley worked ceremonial magic. Crowley was not content to be monogamous, however, and he had a voracious sexual appetite for both w omen and men. In fact, the “Key” to the OTO was sex magick. Crowley’s sex rites, however, were not to be tak en lightly or casually, as he himself thought them to be very serious and powerful magic. Crowley’s ritual sex partners were often prostitutes and men he’d picked up in Turkish bath houses. Even with the women the Great Beast often insisted on ha ving anal intercourse, so convinced w as he of its magical qualities. One of his sexual partners and first dis- ciples w as Victor Neubur g, an orthodo x Je w who had become agnostic and with whom Cr owley pla yed the passiv e r ecipient. Neuburg, who was in love with the Great Beast, was also the vic- tim of Cr owley’s sadism, enduring beatings , including one acr oss the butt with nettles. In his pr actices he also used his “Scarlet W omen,” including a young girl named Leah Hir sig, to whom Crowley had taken a fancy in the spring of 1918. Leah did not serve as the Scarlet Woman, how- ever, until 192 0, at Cr owley’s Abbey of Thelema at Cefalu, Sicily , which he and Leah called the “College of the Holy Ghost” and which 89 The Return to South Orange Grove Ave.: 1942–1945"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"was “sexually free.” At one point at the Abbey, a male goat was sup- posed to copulate with Leah, but he “failed to perform” and was sac- rificed, splattering Leah with his blood. One scandal that nearly torpedoed Cr owley was the death of a young acolyte who had engaged in a ritual of drug-taking and drink- ing the blood of a sacrificed cat. The incident was the source of sen- sational headlines in London: “Ne w Sinister Revelations of Aleister Crowley. Varsity Lad’s Death. Enticed to ‘Abbey’. Dreadful Ordeal of A Young Wife. Crowley’s Plans,” as well as “Young Wife’s Story of Crowley’s Abbey. Scenes of Horror. Drugs Magic and Vile Practices.” Crowley was accused not only of sexual deviation but also of canni- balism. Because of such bad publicity, Crowley ironically riled Italy’s fascist dictator, Mussolini, no angel himself, and w as subsequently tossed out of that country and his abbey. The German br anches of the OTO were closed because of the Nazis, who also arrested and tortured Crowley’s main advocate and money-supplier, Karl Germer, one of whose friends, Martha Küntzel, became an ar dent admir er of Hitler and “r egularly bombar ded Crowley with letters loaded with praises of Hitler.” Adding to his scandals, at one point Crowley tried to make money selling “Elixir of Life Pills” that w ere supposed to enhance virility . Those who took them pr obably never realized they were composed of a “neutral base combined with Crowley’s own semen.” They were probably energized by some sort of sex magick. Thus, it is clear that Crowley’s excoriation of Smith was based not on any so-called morals but was merely an excuse for him to blast Smith. In reality, when Crowley heard that Smith had legally incor- porated the Church of Thelema, he mistak enly took it to mean that Smith intended to r aise his ne w son to r eplace Cr owley. Germer played no little part in this deception. Crowley removed Smith thr ough an ingenious means . First, he drew up a horoscope for Smith based on the unusual cir cumstance of his birth. Smith’ s hor oscope had a comple x of eight planets , which one could easily interpret as if Smith were an avatar of some god. This complex was something Crowley had found in only one other instance, that of Shak espeare. He called it “one of the most astonishingly fortunate figures that Frater 666 [Crowley] has ever set up in his whole life!” and printed the hor oscope, intended only for Smith, under the title, “Is Smith A God?” The 12-page document was also titled Liber Apotheosis or Liber 132 . Crowley wrote: 90 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The simple, the astounding tr uth, flooded the mind of Frater 666 with light.

He hoped Smith’ s ego w as big enough to fall for it y et he also secretly wondered if it weren’t somehow true, as his belief in astrol- ogy required it to be true no matter ho w paradoxical he personally found it to be. The members of the lodge started referring to Smith as “the Unknown God,” a reference to the New Testament verse of Acts 17:23, which reads: For as I [Paul] passed along, and observed the objects of your wor- ship, I found also an altar with this inscription, ‘T o an unknown god.’ What ther efore you worship as unknown, this I pr oclaim to you. It has not been documented whether Smith e ver claimed “Knowledge & Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel,” which was a part of the A ∴ A ∴ ’s 5°=6 rite. “Is Smith A God?” continues: The word “god” implies a fact; it is no question of convenience as when the Ephesians called Barnabas “Jupiter” and Paul “Mercury.” [Acts 14] The incarnation of a god is an exceedingly rare event to become known, although fr equent enough when he makes it secr etly “to take his pleasure on the ear th among the legions of the living.” It being known, it is important to ascertain his purpose, especially as (in the present case) the material envelope has been so per fectly constructed that he is himself not fully awar e of it. One must distinguish such cases very sharply indeed from that phenomenon—in these days so common as to constitute an appre- ciable percentage of the population as to exercise noticeable influ- ence upon society—of the incarnation of elementals.

A quite possibly significant moment might have been the Summer Solstice of 1916, or during the Winter of 1906 when ter rific forces were set in motion by the Chiefs of the Order. The “child” (i.e. the “god”) might well have been begotten by the Paris Working (Januar y, 1914) or as the r esult of some of the immense Enochian invocations: in the latter case the name of the god required might be found on the W atch Towers of the Universe [the Enochian Tablets], his natur e determined by analysis of the squares concerned.

Her last attendance of a lodge meeting occurred in No vember 1942. After his “r etirement,” Smith often tried to go back to the house, according to Grady McMurtry (later Hymenaeus Alpha X °), but he was not welcome there. At this time, Parsons was corresponding with McMurtry, who was stationed in Eur ope on military duty . McMurtry often sent P arsons poems he had written, usually of a m ystical nature. Parsons encour- aged McMurtry to contact Cr owley while he was in England, an act that led to Crowley initiating McMurtry all the w ay to the X ° of the OTO . To Parsons’ surprise, McMurtry returned to the United States a few short years later as his superior in the Order. With Smith having left, Parsons was Acting Head of the Lodge at this time. Smith’s retirement took place at a turkey farm outside of Pasadena belonging to a member of the lodge named R oy Leffingwell. In his quest to find the god within himself, Smith had to build a small altar from rocks he found the site. He also had to tattoo the “Mark of the Beast” on his forehead or right palm and (if desir ed) over his heart and his mons veneris (sic). Everything that happened to him during the retreat was to be carefully recorded and forwarded to Germer, the “Outer Head” of the OTO . Eventually, Smith was told by Leffingwell to leave the farm. While Smith thus floundered, Parsons had plenty of money for his occult activities , as , b y the summer of 1943, A erojet w as doing $650,000 in business. In June of that y ear, Parsons and von Kármán were invited to Norfolk, Virginia, where they turned their attention to aircraft carriers because JATO s were unable to keep up with the big- ger bombers and the ease with which runways were now being con- structed. Two of von Kármán’s former students were now a captain and an admir al in the Na vy, and the Hungarian and P arsons were invited to demonstrate their JATO s for the Secretary of the Navy and his admirals. This test took place on the USS Charger , which w as docked at Norfolk. Parsons outfitted a Grumman airplane with solid- fuel JATO s, but when the plane took off it co vered the Secretary and his admirals with a cloud of yellow smoke that left a nasty residue. A few of the officers got mad, but the Secretary merely told them to find a way to get rid of the smok e and they would have a contract. This incident led to the development of Aeroplex, Aerojet’s brand name for smokeless powder. Also in 1943 P arsons divorced Helen, ha ving struck up a r ela- tionship with her y ounger sister (they may have been half-sisters), 93 The Return to South Orange Grove Ave.: 1942–1945"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Sara Elizabeth Northrup, AKA “Betty.” Another version of events says that Parsons took up with Betty before this, when Helen was out of town. Parsons told his old friend R ypinski, “I got rid of m y wife [Helen] by witchcraft.” Born April 8, 1925, Betty w as tall (5 ′ 9 ′′ ), slender, with blondish brown hair. Like Helen before her, Betty acted as Parsons’ priestess at the Gnostic Mass, the pair fulfilling the roles left vacant by Smith and Kahl. Parsons’ devotion was such that the Mass was held every single day. Betty was also Parsons’ partner in the performance of se x magick—the “magic” of inducing alter ed states through prolonged sexual ecstasy. Kahl, on the other hand, was a lesbian. At Par sons’ ur ging the 18-y ear-old Betty left the Univ ersity of Southern California ( USC ). Parsons was 11 years her senior, and her parents were not at all happ y about the arr angement. Parsons later noted the implied element of adultery and incest in this r elationship with his wife’s sister was most appealing. (The breaking of taboos is a typical “tantric” practice, but it may also be that Parsons felt stung by his wife’s “betrayal” with Smith.) P arsons and Betty liv ed as a couple, although they never did marry. Interestingly, Parsons encouraged Betty to take other lovers, as he did, because he per ceived himself above the petty jealousies felt b y normal men. For a time , this sentiment w as true, and their v arious affairs seem to ha ve strengthened their feelings for each other , para- doxical as that may sound. At the end of the day, they always had one another to turn to. Of their relationship, Alva Rogers wrote: Betty, who had been living with Jack for a number of years, com- plemented him admirably. She was young, blonde, ver y attractive, full of joie de vivr e, thoughtful, humorous, generous, and all that. She assisted Jack in the OTO and seemed to possess the same devotion to it and to Crowley as did Jack . . .

Crowley did not accept the offer and, in July 1943, wr ote a letter to lodge member Max Schneider: “ As to Jack: I think he is perfectly alright at the bottom of e verything; but he is very young, and he has at pr esent nothing like the strength to deal with matters within his jurisdiction objectively.” (Schneider and his wife had a small cabin on Mount P alomar that the member s of the lodge often used for short retreats.) Although quite reckless in his personal life, Crowley was a decent judge of character, and his opinion of Jack w as good, if some what guarded, consistently documented in his letters to other members. In December of 1943, Crowley wrote to the actress Jane Wolfe, who had earlier alerted him to Parsons’ potential as “the child”: Jack is the Objective (Smith is out, an affaire classée: anybody who communicates with him in any way is out also; and that is that, and the best plan is to sponge the whole slate clean, and get to work to build up Thelema on sound principles. And no mor e of this brothel-building: let’s use marble, not r otten old boar ds!) Jack’s trouble is his weakness, and his r omantic side—the poet—is at present a hindrance. He gets a kick from some magazine trash, or an ‘occult’ novel (if only he knew how they wer e concocted!) and dashes off in wild pursuit. He must learn that the sparkle of cham- pagne is based on sound wine; pumping carbonic acid into urine is not the same thing. I wish to God I had him for six months—even three, with a hus- tle—to train in Will, in discipline. He must understand that fine and fiery flashes of Spirit come fr om the or ganization of Matter, from the drilling of ever y function of ever y bodily or gan until it has become so r egular as to be automatic, and car ried on by itself deep down in the Unconscious. It is the steadiness of one’s Hear t that enables one to endur e the raptur e of gr eat passion; one doesn’t want the vital functions to be excitable. In F ebruary 1944, he wr ote to the Burlingames (also lodge members): . . . I am ver y glad indeed of your of fer to co-operate practically in any way possible. I have left Jack Parsons in charge; he is quite all right in essence, but ver y young and easily swayed by passing influences. I shall look to you to help in keeping him up to the mark. 95 The Return to South Orange Grove Ave.: 1942–1945"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"In contrast, three Aerojet memos written by Parsons in August of 1944 clearly show him in char ge of his pr ogram there, working on smokeless powder with aluminum perchlorate as an oxidizer. Despite others’ failures with these materials , Parsons practically insisted on moving ahead with his o wn experiments. He also attended a solid fuel conference during the summer and fall of 1944, of which his typed notes are now in the JPL archives. Obviously, Parsons liked to be in charge and not under authority, in both his pr ofessional and per sonal liv es. Sometime that y ear Par sons made an interesting statement in a letter sent to McMurtry: “I am a little sour on the OTO inasmuch as by experience I doubt the value of membership coming in e xcept via previous experience and individual training of the A ∴ A ∴ sort. It seems to me the early grades (which are all we have here) are too free in admitting non-descripts and too lax in that they do not provide a definite program of training and qualifications. The better people I have met always seem to come via an interest in A ∴ A ∴ aspects.” This instance is not the fir st time Par sons questioned his association with the OTO , nor would it be his last. He had a long history of bucking authority; the OTO soon became one more “authority” trying to tell him what to do. While he concerned with formal training and qualifications in his “spiritual” life, Parsons had no need for it in his aer ospace occupa- tion. Indeed, he thrived without such academic accomplishment and credentials, as did the business and science he helped found. In 1944, GALCIT changed its name to the Jet Pr opulsion Laboratory ( JPL ), a term coined in a memorandum written by von Kármán, Malina, and Tsien on No vember 2 0, 1943. A t that time their budget w as an astounding $650,000, and appr oximately 80 people w orked there, though Summerfield w as still oper ating out of his car . Malina w as soon named Director of JPL , a position he held until 1946, although he is usually r eferred to as the second Dir ector, v on Kármán b y default being the fir st. It seems that Malina w as retreating from his anti-capitalist stance, also expressing to his parents just a little over a year earlier that “we are getting to be more and more like capitalists.” However, Malina and his fir st wife w ere long-standing member s of the local communist “cell,” which certainly had much to do with his getting out of the rocket business after the end of the war. Despite the impr essive budget, the JPL facilities were still r ather primitive. Eugene Pierce, a local architect, took a job as an adminis- trative assistant ar ound this time . Of his fir st trip to the arroyo he said, “I took one look at those half-a-dozen nondescript, corrugated- 96 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"metal and redwood-tie and stone buildings and thought, m y God!— what have I gotten m yself into? Ther e’s no futur e for an ar chitect here.” Inside, the buildings things were no better. The corridors were extremely narrow, and Pier ce shared an 8-b y-10 office with Malina and secretary Dorothy Lewis, with whom JPL historians were able to conduct an oral history interview in 1972. In the interview, Lewis told them that P arsons “was the clo wn of the gr oup. He lo ved to pla y jokes. That was all right.” Dorothy’s office overlooked the liquid fuel test pit. Conversation halted whenever a test was run. Malina and Summerfield launched a small series of rockets called the “Private” in 1944, when Malina paused long enough to r ealize that they now had the means to carry out the original goal of the early GALCIT group. Constructed of little mor e than JATO s to which fins and a nose cone were attached, the Privates successfully carried meteorological equipment high into the atmospher e—for the pur- poses of pur e research rather than military applications . This com- pleted goal made Malina happ y. The Priv ate A w as launched fr om Leach Spring, at Camp Irwin near Barstow, California, an army base in the Mojave Desert. The following year, however, found Malina working with missiles meant to be fir ed into enem y territory . The pr oject ORDCIT — “America’s first long range missile and space exploration program”— was formed for this purpose , in the same arroyo where GALCIT was located. Two of the missiles de veloped, the solid-fuel Ser geant and the liquid-fuel Corporal, were never deployed, but the later R egulus missile was. The Regulus was developed by others for deployment in western Europe during the Cold W ar. These small, mobile missiles were launched from the backs of trucks and, as with the other early missiles, were simply made fr om large solid-fuel JATO s with a fe w minor modifications to make them fly. It is another odd “coincidence” that the term “Regulus,” a star in the constellation Leo, appear s in the w ork of Aleister Cr owley, appearing in the title of Crowley’s Liber V vel Reguli in its plural form. Reproduced in R egardie’s Gems from the Equinox, Liber V is “the Ritual of the Mark of the Beast: an incantation pr oper to invoke the Energies of the A eon of Horus , adapted for the daily use of the Magician of whatever grade.” The “Mark of the Beast,” of cour se, is what Smith was supposed to tattoo on himself during his r etreat. On March 11, 1945, Parsons wrote to McMurtry that he w as “try- ing to get out from under [the OTO ] and more into A ∴ A ∴ work which suits me far better and in which I think I can do more.” However, he 97 The Return to South Orange Grove Ave.: 1942–1945"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"was not quite r eady to leave the OTO at this time, and its appar ent influence on his life would continue. Despite his occult leanings , Parsons enjoyed respectability in his professional work. On Mar ch 15 the Saturday Evening P ost ran an article called “ JATO s Get ’Em Up,” highlighting the v ery successful use of solid-fuel JATO s, with mention of Parsons, Forman, Malina and Summerfield as the de velopers, under the dir ection of von Kármán. The article discusses the differ ent wartime applications for which JATO s were currently being used, including on the Navy’s PB-2Y sea- planes and the small Corsairs that were launched from aircraft carri- ers. Because of the JATO s, which helped them launch without the advantage of a long, smooth str etch of w ater, Catalan Flying Boats were able to land in the chopp y waters of the South P acific, unde- terred by 18-foot swells, to carry out a r escue mission. Another dra- matic rescue was made in Southern California when a Martin Mariner was forced down in a small lak e: the Mariner needed a full mile to take off, but the lake was only 3000 feet at its greatest width, so JATO s were mounted under the plane’s wings, allowing it to get back into the air safely. Another one of the JPL group, Charles Bartley 9 , made an improve- ment to P arsons’ original asphalt binder in 1945. T o r eplace the asphalt, Bartley created a polysulfide compound, for which the word “thiokol” w as coined, fr om the Gr eek w ords for “sulphur” and “glue.” Called “Thiok ol LP-2,” the compound is a polymer , which means an artificial compound with a very repetitive molecular struc- ture consisting of long molecules joined together endlessly . The reg- ular molecular structur e is what giv es polymer s their desir able qualities. The compound name can also be found in “Morton-Thiok ol,” a well-recognized aerospace manufacturing firm today. As late as the Kor ean War, solid-fuel JATO s were used on Sabre Jet fighters, which would jettison the canisters after use, such that the Korean jungles must be full of them. Solid-fuel r ockets launched the P olaris mis- siles, a name corr elating to “Pole Star,” the moniker Parsons used in writing to r efer to Smith. Solid fuel, of cour se, is also what launches the Space Shuttle, of which Morton-Thiokol was the man- ufacturer until the Challenger disaster , after which A erojet got the contract. In 1945, Betty’s sentiment was recorded by Jane Wolfe who shared 98 sex and r ockets 9.

Ther e is always Betty [Nor thrup], r emember, who hates Smith. But our own Jack is enamored with Witchcraft, the hounfort, voodoo. From the start he always wanted to evoke something—no matter what, I am inclined to think, as long as he got a r esult. According to Meeka [Aldrich] yester day, he has had a r esult— an elemental he doesn’t know what to do with. Fr om that state- ment of hers, it must bother him—somewhat at least. Par sons’ ardent thrill-seeking was, of course, not just professional but personal, and he once wrote that one of the rituals he used w as “liable to pr oduce dangerous side phenomena and sometimes per- manent haunting in an ar ea where it is r epeated.” Wolfe’s “witch- craft” r eference is to one of P arsons’ pr ojects, called “The Witchcraft,” which, along with “The Gnosis ,” was his attempt to devise a r eligious system of his o wn that addr essed fields Cr owley seems to ha ve stayed out of. The surviving paper s concerning The Gnosis and the Witchcraft are reproduced in the book Freedom Is A Two-Edged Sword . The elementals or spirits Parsons was invoking evidently disturbed the other Parsonage residents. One still-living and activ e member of the OTO and the A ∴ A ∴ today, Phyllis Seckler (“Soror Meral,” initiated by W olfe into the A ∴ A ∴ ), recorded: Meeka also reported to Jane that another two persons always had to do a lot of banishing in the house.

The “Meeka” referred to w as Meeka Aldrich, who pledged the grade of Minerval in August 1945 and was granted the I° of the OTO on August 25. Like Helen Parsons had for a while, she served as the treasurer of Agape Lodge in September, though she shared that office with another during the follo wing month. Meeka kept active in the 99 The Return to South Orange Grove Ave.: 1942–1945"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"lodge after that, and was the one who found places for the lodge to meet from late 1946 into 1948. As the w ar ended, the founder s of A erojet started looking for a way to make the firm viable , because its futur e was suddenly very uncertain. It is ir onic that P arsons’ work, despite its anti-military beginnings and goal, had become the backbone of military oper a- tions, so much so that his company was virtually dependent on war. How he was able to r econcile his profession with his per sonal life, which, while hedonistic, he ostensibly viewed as spiritual, is a quirk of the human mind in gener al, as millions of other s have been able to do the same. Fortunately, the firm was able to convince Gener al Tire to invest in it. If it succeeded, fine; if not, Gener al Tire was big enough to absorb the loss as a tax write-off. With the purchase, Aerojet became Aer ojet General, today known as GenCorp Aerojet. Once General Tire bought in, it decided it w anted the whole pie but none of the old- timers hanging ar ound, so it sent its people out to str ong-arm Aer ojet’s founders into r elinquishing their stock. All sold out but Malina, who happened to be in London at the time and who later wrote that sunspot activity disrupted the telegr aph tr ansmission, such that he never got the offer. The solar storm proved a boon, how- ever, as he became a millionaire as a result. In the ’60s, von Kármán calculated that if he himself had held onto his stock he w ould have been worth $12 million. But it was hard to resist the offer Aerojet General was making. The war was ending, the futur e was uncertain, the gr oup had achieved what they intended to achie ve with r ockets, and no w Aerojet was offering them $50,000 apiece for their stock. Charles Bartley remem- bers Parsons and Forman coming into his office at JPL quite excited, bragging how they had managed to get out of the compan y while they were still ahead. The w ar was over, they told him, and r ockets were finished. The field had no futur e. They were going to start a chain of laundromats with their mone y and become rich men. It is difficult to understand how the two obviously passionate men could have given up their y outhful goals about r ockets so easily, particu- larly since they still hadn’t launched anything into space. In fact, Parsons had actually sold out befor e the war ended and intended to continue his hazar dous passions . In a letter dated December 14, 1944 to Gr ady McMurtry, Parsons wrote that he had “sold out at Aerojet, purchased 1003 [S. Orange Grove Ave.], and am starting a ne w company engaged in chemical r esearch.” Evidently 100 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"interested in other danger ous pursuits, he added that he w as trying to get the e x-High Priestess R egina Kahl to r eturn to the lodge . In apparent response to a question fr om McMurtry as to whether he could send Parsons anything from Europe, Parsons replied “a witch, young, red headed . . .” His letters to McMurtry are full of references to Europe being “witch country.” The “lady-killer” Parsons did not confine his sexual largesse to his private w orld, ho wever. Indeed, both he and F orman w ere w ell- known around the A erojet office as w ell, and the office manager s cringed when the y saw the r andy pair come in because both men seemed to be w orking their way through the secretarial pool. Each had had affair s with se veral women there, according to those who knew them then, and their relationships with these women interfered with the secretaries’ work to the point of disruption. But the y were the founders, and their pr esence had to be toler ated until they sold out and left. Zwicky claimed that Hale y had actually convinced Par sons to sell out prior to the Gener al Tire buyout, simply because of his pr oblems at the office , but v on Kármán and other s disagree with Zwicky on this count. Parsons told Rypinski that he left because Aer ojet was less inter ested in r esearch and mor e interested in pr o- duction and sales. However, Parsons did not get back into r esearch after he left. Par sons and Forman formed Adastra Research, a small explosives company that was investigated for “espionage” when the tw o were caught with a lar ge quantity of “x-nitr ate,” a powerful explosive. It was determined that the compound had been pr ocured for e xperi- mental reasons, and the charges were dropped. Parsons then went to work for the Vulcan Powder Company in Pasadena, where he would remain for the next two years. Back in New Mexico, Robert Goddard had his o wn problems. At the end of the w ar, he fell into a depr ession, became ill, and died before the y ear w as out. Certainly his failur e with r ockets—and Caltech’s success—was a contributing factor. In late A ugust of 1945, Lou Goldstone br ought L. R on Hubbard over to meet P arsons, who lik ed Hubbard immediately. As noted, Hubbard had been the model for D. Vance Wimple in White’s Rocket to the Mor gue . He told a lot of w ar stories which, though har d to believe, were well-liked by most, and he fit right in with the unusual assortment of people who lived there. Hubbard had just come from the Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in San Francisco and complained of v arious ailments including rheuma- 101 The Return to South Orange Grove Ave.: 1942–1945"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"tism, arthritis, hemorrhoids, conjunctivitis, and aches in his side , shoulder, stomach, and knee. After several hospital visits, Hubbard was given a medical dischar ge from the Navy and began r eceiving financial benefits when he told them he could no longer practice his livelihood of being a writer. The Parsons circle included not only a circuit connecting Hubbard and Cr owley but also one linking Cr owley to Lo vecraft, whom Hubbard had met through Lovecraft biographer Frank Belknap Long. (Writers have tried for years to link Lovecraft and Crowley in one way or another, but this is a dir ect connection that has not y et been explored.) In addition, Hubbard and Parsons associated with people in Pasadena who had met Clark Ashton Smith, one of Lo vecraft’s regular corr espondents, as w ell as of Cr owley’s “inner cir cle.” Lovecraft’s “The Colour Out of Space” had appear ed in the September 1927 issue of Amazing Stories , the publication Ed Forman had written about, so Parsons had probably read it. He may also have read Weird Tales , which regularly featured the work of Lovecraft in the teens and tw enties. Judging b y Crowley’s remark in December 1943 in his letter to Jane W olfe, this was simply the sort of “maga- zine trash” Parsons was reading. Par sons had begun his magical w ork with Betty, Helen’s younger sister, after Helen had left with Smith. His encouragement of an open relationship, which demonstrated his evolution beyond petty human jealousy, was to backfire on him, however, as Betty readily agreed to take up other lo vers and ended up with Hubbar d. The relationship was to be a source of extreme aggravation for Parsons, who suddenly had more than he could bear. Hubbard charmed P arsonage r esident Alv a R ogers, who, lik e Hubbard, was a redhead. Indeed, Hubbard confided his belief that all r edheads descended fr om the Neanderthal r ather than pur e Homo sapiens . “Needless to say,” Rogers wrote, “I was fascinated.” The redhead-Neanderthal connection is interesting to keep in mind when reading Williamson’s Darker Than You Think , the story of werewolves who return to their atavistic state. Rogers further wrote: It all began on an other wise undistinguished day in the late fall of 1945 when we got word that L. Ron Hubbard was planning to wait out his terminal leave from the Navy at “The Parsonage” . . . Short visits by such pr o authors as Jack Williamson, Edmond Hamilton, Tony Boucher, and other were fairly frequent; but Ron was planning on an extended stay. 102 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Ron arrived on a Sunday, driving an oldish Packard and hauling a house trailer which he parked on the grounds behind the house. He originally intended staying in the trailer , but within a few days someone moved out of the house and he moved in. I liked Ron from the first. He was of medium build, red headed, wore horned rim glasses, and had a tr emendously engaging per- sonality. For several weeks he dominated the scene with his wit and inexhaustible fund of anecdotes. About the only thing he seemed to take seriously and be prideful of was his membership in the Explorers Club (of which he was the youngest member) which he had received after leading an expedition into the wilds of South America, or some such godforsaken place. Ron showed us scars on his body which he claimed wer e made by aboriginal ar rows on this expedition . . . Unfortunately, Ron’s reputation for spinning tall tales (both off and on the printed page) made for a cer tain degree of skepticism in the minds of his audience. At any rate, he told one hell of a good stor y . . . Ron was a persuasive and unscrupulous charmer, not only in a social group, but with the ladies. He was so persuasive and charm- ingly unscrupulous that within a matter of a few weeks he br ought the entire House of Parsons down around poor Jack’s ears. He did this by the simple expedient of taking over Jack’s girl for extended periods of time . . . Ron was supposedly his best friend, and this was more than Jack was willing to tolerate . . . A reporter named Nieson Himmel also lived in the house, sharing a room with Hubbard, after the latter moved out of his trailer and into the house. Himmel wrote: Parsons was a superb chemist. He had this big old house up in Pasadena, among some huge old mansions. It was built by some rich people at the turn of the century. The coach houses were still back there . . .

Even at 30, Parsons was still young enough and immature enough to be quite impr essionable and vulner able, despite the fact that he had gone through repeated upheavals during his short life. He was a romantic, a poet—not a businessman. Hubbar d made a big impr es- sion on him, so much so that P arsons forgot his obligation and vio- lated his oath to the Or der, revealing to Hubbard the secrets of the highest grades of the OTO —grades which P arsons himself ma y not have actually held but merely had access to some of the documents associated with them. However, two of his letters refer to himself as holding this grade, so the matter is unclear. He may have been exag- gerating again. With the w ar ended and the business buy out, it seems P arsons had a lot of time on his hands and thr ew himself into the magical work, possibly also as a distr action from and remedy for his painful experience with Betty and Hubbar d. The “magical partner” P arsons envisioned was to be his partner in a “w orking” of sexual magic— probably not a IX °, but one of his own devising that fell well outside the system of the OTO . Parsons was known to invoke spirits called ele- mentals, so-called because of their association with the four elements of the ancients: Earth, Air, Water, Fire. The classical symbols associ- ated with each are usually gnomes, sylphs, mermaids, and salaman- ders, r espectively. These ar e, of cour se, just s ymbols, such that modern replacements for each could be found: F or example, UFO s, perhaps, would be a good replacement for sylphs. According to Cr owley, to summon an elemental r equires a lar ge 107 The Return to South Orange Grove Ave.: 1942–1945"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"amount of magical energy, the kind said to be gener ated by an VIII ° working, the VIII ° being a solo se xual rite, i.e., masturbation. As Par sons once wr ote, “The inv ocation of lesser for ces (spirit, angel, demon, elemental) is e xact, since lo ve doesn’t usually enter in so much, in one sense [it is] far mor e dangerous than inv ocation of Gods. In the higher w ork you are actually wooing the god—it is an act of art. In the lo wer you are compelling—it is an act of science .” (Whether Parsons actually followed the rites of the VIII ° of the OTO is known only to initiates.) There ar e se veral w ays to go about doing what P arsons w as attempting, and he wrote: The primar y methods ar e: 1. Goetia Daemonic , 2. Planetar y Clavicle of Solomon , 3. Enochian Elemental and Air es , 4. Solar Guardian Angel . I have found the Enochian the best (although com- plicated). The Tarot corresponds to the Enochian system obtained by Dr. Dee—the Trumps to the Aires, the Court Cards to the Gods, Seniors and Angels, and the numbers to the lesser angels. What it all boils down to is that Parsons experimented on his own with upper-degr ee OTO techniques usually char acterized as “se x magic,” i.e., to affect or bring about e vents. In addition, he r emains the best example in support of the OTO ’s policy of keeping these tech- niques secret. 108 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"six An Introduction to Enochian Magic F rom Parsons’ ritual references and other aspects of the occult world in which he so ardently participated, we can piece together the atmosphere surrounding his workings. For example, the Enochian s ystem referred to b y Parsons is a form of magic founded not b y the prophet Enoch but b y Dr. John Dee and Sir Edward Kelley in 16th-century England. Enochian magic is not necessarily sexual in nature; in fact, its Elizabethan originators delib- erately refused injunctions towards sexual immorality. John Dee was born July 13, 1527 in Mortlak e, England, a small village on the Thames just outside of London. Dee was a bright boy, enrolling at the university at the age of 15. He began a large private library at his home and eventually became proficient in various sci- ences including mathematics, navigation (much of which he learned firsthand during his world travels), astronomy, optics, and cartogra- phy. He also studied the hermetic sciences and was appointed to be the Royal Astrologer to Elizabeth I. Dee had been imprisoned b y Queen Mary after dr awing up an unfavorable horoscope for her (at her r equest). Elizabeth pardoned him, and in addition to his otherw orldly duties he also acted as an agent of espionage, signing his secret communiqués to her “007.” He seems to have developed some sense of esoteric duty to Elizabeth’ s person or position, as ther e is e vidence he idolized her as the Egyptian goddess Isis . Indeed, his “ esoteric duty” ma y even have included an application of the famous INRI formula, the “key word” used in Crowley’s magic, in one of its many variations. Dee married relatively late, in 1574, at the age of 47. History does not record the name of the wife , who died the follo wing year. He remarried, this time to a Jane Fromond, one of the Queen’s ladies-in- waiting. Dee’s studies continued independently, and by 1581 he felt he had exhausted all known sources of worldly knowledge and that the only way to continue his quest for knowledge was to turn to the otherworldly. A godly man, Dee w as a good Christian and a member of the Church of England. He admir ed Enoch, the fir st man after the F all 109 An Introduction to Enochian Magic"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"said to have walked with God. According to tradition, Enoch was the author of se veral apocryphal books , in which he w as said to ha ve recorded what he learned during these walks. These lost books were in fact pseudepigraphical, i.e., not written by Enoch, but Dee longed to find them and proposed to do it with the help of angels . Addressing God, he pr ayed, “I have read often in Th y books & records, how Enoch often injoyed Thy favour & conversation; with Moses thou was familiar; And also that to Abraham, Issack & Jocob, Joshua, Gideon, Esdras, Daniel, Tobias & sundry other s Thy good angels w ere sent b y Th y disposition, to Instruct them, informe them, helpe them, y ea in worldly and domestick affair es, yea and sometymes to satisfie their desir es, doubtes & questions of Th y Secrete.” In his quest, Dee acquir ed from various sources several magical “shewstones,” with the intent of taking up cry stal-gazing. Try as he might, ho wever, he couldn’t do it, as he was just too logical a thinker and his rational brain resisted all attempts to impose a tr ance state upon it. He decided he needed a helper and enlisted the services of Edward Kelley, who had changed his name fr om Talbott. Kelley had a reputation as an alchemist; it was said he had produced gold once. It also seems he was something of a rogue. John Weever recorded the following adventure of Kelley’s in the 16th-century Ancient Funerall Monuments , the spelling of which appear s to have been somewhat modernized: This diabolical questioning of the dead for the knowledge of futur e accidents was put into practice by the said Kelley, who, upon a cer- tain night in the park of W alton-le-Dale in the County of Lancaster with one Paul Waring (his fellow companion in such deeds of dark- ness) invocated some of the Infer nal Regiment, to know cer tain passages in the life, as also what might be known by the Devil’s foresight of the manner and time of the death of a noble young gen- tleman, as then in war dship. The black cer emonies of the night being ended, Kelley demanded of one of the gentleman’s servants what corse was the last buried in Law chur chyard, a church there- unto adjoining, who told him of a poor man that was buried ther e but the same day. He and the said Waring entreated this foresaid servant to go with them to the grave of the man so lately inter red, which he did; and withal did help them to dig up the carcase of the poor caitiff, whom by their incantations they made him (or rather some evil spirit thr ough his or gans) to speak, who deliver ed 110 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"strange predictions concerning the said gentleman. I was told this by the said serving-man, a secondary actor in that dismal abhorred business, and divers gentlemen and others ar e now living in Lancashire to whom he hath related this story. And the gentleman himself (whose memory I am bound to honor) told me a little before his death of this conjuration of Kelley, as he had it by relation from his said ser vant and tenant, only some cir cumstances except, which he thought not fit to come to his master’s notice. Kelley, called “the crop-eared wizard” because he had had his ears cropped as a punishment for earlier sorceries, moved with his family into a room in Dee’s house, where they subsisted on a £50 per year salary paid by Dee. On a cold evening in 1582, March 8, Dee and Kelley sat down and gazed into one of the she wstones. Impatient, Dee soon got up and moved to ward the fir e, but within 15 minutes K elley w as seeing angels. Dee came quickly but sa w nothing and became content to assume the role of scribe, recording what Kelley relayed he was seeing. According to Kelley, the angels sho wed him large tablets bearing unusual letter s, which supposedly formed the oldest language of them all: the language of the angels . Kelley described the tablets to Dee, who wrote down what was said. The angel then pr oceeded to dictate the lost books of Enoch to Kelley, by spelling them out letter- by-letter. The angel would point to a letter, and Kelley would tell Dee which letter it was. During these tr ansmissions, Kelley was so afr aid that the mer e mention of these letter s would be sufficient to inv oke demons, that he only would call out the row and column of each letter as the angel pointed to it. Dee w ould then look up the corr esponding letter and write it down. There were many more tablets, Kelley told Dee, which were not dictated. The books completed, the angel next dictated the 30 “Aethyrs” (or “Aires”) and their 19 Calls , which are for summoning angels to the caller, for the purpose of “scrying” or vie wing what w as in the Aethyr. The first five Calls were considered so powerful that the angel dictated them backwards to avoid conjuring up the guardians of the corresponding Aethyrs; the remainder were dictated in the usual way. The Aethyrs are likened to the spheres of the ancients, the plane- tary orbits thought to surr ound the earth. A ccording to ancient mythology and r eligion, souls ascending to hea ven had to pass through each sphere in succession, aided b y a series of holy names 111 An Introduction to Enochian Magic"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"and passwords. Unsuccessful attempts led to reincarnation at best, or to hell. Tradition holds that many of the Aethyrs are guarded by harsh angels, even demons, who have no patience with men or magicians. After the hazardous dictation process was completed, the angel provided Kelley with the English tr anslations, which r equired that Dee had to go back over the entire collection of transcripts and sub- stitute the English. Although each Enochian letter has its English counterpart, it is not a letter-for-letter substitution or a code . The let- ter correspondences were only pr ovided as a pr onunciation guide. An actual dictionary was dictated, and Dee had to tr anslate accord- ingly. Enochian is thus a language unto itself, with its own grammar and syntax. It is very succinct and has an odd relationship to English that it does not have with other languages. One example of Enochian is the w ord “Babalon,” meaning “harlot” in Enochian, as in the “Whore of Babylon.” The Enochian s ystem being complicated, the entire process of dictation and tr anslation took se ven years, from 1582 to 1589. Amazingly enough, considering the language’ s comple xity, the Enochian Calls translate into English remarkably well. Regardless of the fact that they were dictated backwards and forwards, and that the translations were only pr ovided later, Enochian turned out to be a coherent language previously unknown to man. The Calls, when translated, are quite evocative, and contain some very beautiful passages. Although it could easily be claimed K elley was making the whole thing up, the Calls were nothing at all like his usual writing style, which was quite crude even when he wrote verse. It seems improbable for Kelley to have defrauded Dee in this regard, as the system is just too immense and well structured. Along with the Calls w ere dictated instructions , such as when scrying or cry stal-gazing the tw o were to arr ange a special cedar table, around the perimeter of which w as inscribed in Enochian, “This is the place of the outpouring of forgotten treasure in the form of ecstasy. Only fire is substantial her e. This is the w ay of Babalon and of the Beast who is the first form. The eyes only need rest upon the name of an y guardian and its r epresentative will speedily be encountered.” The whole thing is scrambled in the original, and the name “Babalon” is e xtremely so, in or der to avoid summoning the Harlot. In addition, a special ring and r obes had to be w orn. Some of these artifacts are preserved in the British Museum. The angels pro- vided additional messages as w ell, some of which w ere cause for 112 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"great concern on the part of Dee and K elly. These communications parallel unorthodox messages received from 19th-century fairies and 20th-century occupants of UFOs. For example, at one point Dee and Kelley were told: 1. That Jesus was not God. 2. That no prayer ought to be made to Jesus. 3. That there is no sin. 4. That man’s soul doth go fr om one body to another childes quick- ening [i.e., reincarnation]. 5. That as many men and women as ar e now, have always been. 6. That the generation of mankind fr om Adam and Eve, is not historical but allegorical. Such seemingly blasphemous messages made Kelley balk, and he grew more and more reticent to continue with their work. Dee had a devil of a time keeping him on, despite the £5 0 salary. The stress of the constant scrying once sent K elley running into the str eet like a madman, at which point Dee had to catch him and calm him do wn. However, being a pious man, Dee had occasional misgivings him- self. At one point he burned his entire collection of “angelick” works, allegedly to find thr ee of his books intact a fe w days later. Another time Kelley knocked over a lamp and accidentally burned se veral valuable manuscripts of Dee’s. Other messages w ere less oner ous, such as one instance in which the angel supposedly began dictating in Greek. Kelley, how- ever, did not know Greek and soon threatened to stop dictating if the angel per sisted with this “Gh ybbrish.” Nevertheless, enough came through for Dee to r ecognize the message as a w arning not to trust Kelley. According to the story, the angel later told Dee and Kelley to swap wives, but the tw o were so shock ed at this message that the y and their wives all signed a pact (at Dee’s prompting) never to reveal this message to an yone. As noted, the br eaking of r eligious and se xual taboos, from the eating of meat and wine to incest and homose xual- ity, is considered a part of tantra . The shock is intended to decondi- tion the initiate from his usual lifestyle. In the case of Dee and Kelley, living in prudish Elizabethan England, it w as asking too much—at least for now. They did finally persuade their wives to agree to this seeming commandment from God: Dee recorded in his diary on May 3, 1587, “I, John Dee, Edward Kelley and our two wives, covenanted 113 An Introduction to Enochian Magic"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"with God and subscribed the same , for indissoluble and inviolable unities, charity and friendship k eeping betw een us four , and all things between us to be common, as God by sundry means willed us to do.” Dee and Kelley left Mortlake for a tour of Europe in 1583, contin- uing their work with the angels as they traveled. When they returned in 1587, the y were horrified to see that a super stitious mob had sacked Dee’s house and burned the contents, destroying most of his valuable library. Undeterred by such a faith-destr oying event, the tw o continued, their work with the Calls ending one da y when Kelley was scrying alone in the 7th Air e, during which time he r eceived the following proto-thelemic message: I am the daughter of For titude and ravished ever y hour fr om my youth. For behold, I am Understanding, and science dwelleth in me; and the heavens oppr ess me. They cover and desir e me with infi- nite appetite; for none that are earthly have embraced me, for I am shadowed with the Circle of the Stars, and covered with the morn- ing clouds. My feet ar e swifter than the winds, and my hands ar e sweeter than the mor ning dew. My gar ments are from the begin- ning, and my dwelling place is in myself. The Lion knoweth not where I walk, neither do the beasts of the field understand me. I am deflowered, yet a virgin; I sanctify and am not sanctified. Happy is he that embraceth me: for in the night season I am sweet, and in the day full of pleasure. My company is a harmony of many sym- bols, and my lips sweeter than health itself. I am a harlot [ BABALON ] for such as ravish me, and a vir gin with such as know me not. Pur ge your str eets, O ye sons of men, and wash your houses clean; make yourselves holy , and put on righteousness. Cast out your old strumpets, and burn their clothes and then I will bring forth children unto you and they shall be the Sons of Comfort in the Age that is to come. The entire passage is r eminiscent of the gnostic te xt, “Thunder Perfect Mind,” unearthed at Nag Hammadi in 1945 but written at least 1700 years earlier. This message w as the last str aw for K elley, and he finally snapped, robbing Dee of a lar ge sum and lea ving town with Dee’s wife. The two did not return but ended up in Germany, where Kelley endeared himself to the Emperor. Focusing his attention increasingly 114 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"on practical alchemy, Kelley was soon knighted but was later impris- oned (either for killing a man or simply to k eep him close to the Emperor), and died during an attempt to escape . Dee w as also imprisoned when James I, patron of the King James Bible, ascended to the English throne in 1603. Despite his own personal, extrabibli- cal peccadilloes, the pious King James was scared of magic and put a quick end to Dee’s career as royal astrologer. Dee was subsequently put on trial for witchcr aft but was acquit- ted and spent his remaining years penniless. In 1608, he died, finan- cially ruined but spiritually whole , appar ently ha ving used the Enochian s ystem for little mor e than the satisfaction of his o wn curiosity. The paper s he had hidden a way near the end of his life were not found for 1 00 years, and his diary w as not found for 2 00 years, but for at least one later student Dee’s personal tragedy would eerily appear to repeat itself. As is well known in the world of the esoteric and occult, cry stal- gazing is not the only w ay one may scry in the A ethyrs, as tantric energy, or sex magick, may also be used to induce the same sort of ecstatic states that Kelley used so long ago. The provocative Parsons used this method, as did his libidinous mentor Crowley, who claimed to be the reincarnation of Kelley, although that role would in reality be played to Parsons’ Dee by another man in his personal drama. In addition, Crowley further heightened his awareness through the use of psychoactive drugs (see his Liber LXXXIV vel Chanokh ). Crowley’s The Diary of a Drug Fiend , both w ell-received and vilified, w as accused of encour aging drug abuse . During the cour se of his life , Crowley consumed massiv e amounts of alcohol, opium, cocaine , hashish, peyote and heroin, to which he was addicted at his death. Like Dee and K elley, Parsons eventually found himself in tr ouble, seemingly at the hands of the infamous Babalon, the Enochian Whor e of Babylon, the traditional spirit of Rome who subjugated the children of Israel. Babalon, as the Harlot, is also a symbol of the material world in general, the root “mater” also meaning “mother,” as in “Mother of Abominations.” Adherents to the Jamaican r eligion of R astafari use her this sensual way, as any listener of reggae music might know. A similar symbol for certain gnostic sects in the Middle East w as the “Land of the Dead,” i.e., Egypt. Like Egypt, Babylon was the land of corruption to the composers of the Bible, as in Revelation 17:3-6: He [the angel] car ried my spirit away to the deser t. I saw the Scarlet Woman sitting on the Beast with seven heads and ten 115 An Introduction to Enochian Magic"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"horns, covered with blasphemous names. The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stones and pearls, with a golden cup in her hand filled with abominations and the unclean things of her fornication. On her forehead a name had been written, a myster y: Babylon the Great, the mother of harlots and of the abominations of the Earth . I saw the woman was drunk from the blood of the Saints, and from the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. Seeing her, I wondered greatly. According to Parsons, Babalon is the gnostic Sophia, slighted b y John the Revelator, but justifiably so, as she is still in her fallen state. John fails to offer her r edemption. She is also the Helen of Simon Magus mentioned b y Parsons in his Analysis By A Master of the Temple . She is the Chokmah of the Kabbalah, the Holy Wisdom who cries out in the first and eighth Psalms, folded into the Shekhinah of the Hebrews. The Greek name Babylon is derived from the Semitic Bab-Il, mean- ing “the gate of God.” At one time or another every holy city believed it was at the center of the w orld, the mystical center where the gate between the upper and lo wer w orlds is located. So it is with Jerusalem today for three of the world’s major religions, with Benares for the Hindus, and with Mecca and R ome. Like so many other reli- gious symbols, ho wever, gates have a sexual symbolism as well. The Hebrew for “gate of God” is Bab-Al , usually written Bab-El or simply Babel . The name (actually a title) of God usually translated El (if tr anslated at all) is actually spelled with an “ A” (or aleph in Hebrew). Although he no doubt follo wed the Enochian spelling, Cr owley claimed to ha ve “corrected” “Babylon” to “Babalon” to giv e what was to him a meaningful gematria , a term used by medieval Jewish scholars to describe the ancient pr actice of substituting numbers for the letters in a word or name and adding them up to get a significant result. Gematria comes from a Gr eek word meaning “to measur e (land),” and this practice dates at least to Bab ylon, when single let- ters were used to stand for numbers rather than spelling them out. In an age that has used Ar abic numerals for centuries, the significance of this achievement may be hard to appreciate. In this system of numeration, A = 1, B = 2, and so on. After the 10th letter (“ I ” in the Hebrew and Greek alphabets, sometimes writ- ten as “ Y ”) there was no need for an 11 since “ IA ” stood for a 10 fol- lowed by a 1, which is the w ay we form numer als in our base 1 0 116 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"system. Eleven, in fact, is Cr owley’s “number of magick.” The 1 1th letter is “ K ,” which, accor ding to gematria, equals 2 0, and so on. Thus BABYLON = 2 + 1 + 2 + 400 + 80 + 800 + 50 = 1335, which is not a meaningful result. In the Book of R evelation the original Gr eek is BABYLON with an upsilon ( Y ), rather than an alpha, while the final vowel is not omicron but is the long “o,” omega. Crowley’s “corrected” spelling BABALON = 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 30 + 70 + 50 = 156, a number significant to John Dee as the pr oduct of 12 and 13, the dimensions of the table upon which he received the Enochian alphabet from the angel. Crowley referred to the number 156 as that of the “City of the Pyramids,” where initiates would spend the “Night of Pan.” Babylon was known for its ziggur ats, stepped pyramids built for the gods to descend and humans to ascend, serving as a model for the biblical Tow er of Babel, also immortalized in the 16th car d of the Tarot. In the Enochian s ystem, the City of the Pyr amids lies in the 14th Aire, above which (i.e ., 13th) is the Gar den of Nemo, Nemo being Enochian for “Master of the T emple.” The 12th Air e belongs to Babalon, and the 11th is called the Holy City. The 10th Aire will be dis- cussed in a later chapter. While Dee and Kelley may have discovered the Enochian system and Babalon the Harlot, Parsons was to make the latter more infamous. 10 117 An Introduction to Enochian Magic 10.

In early 1946, using the Angelic language of John Dee and Edw ard Kelley, P arsons planned his magick al oper ation, k eeping diligent records per Cr owley’s constant advice . The surviving fr agments of Par sons’ Babalon W orking have been cir culated since the da ys of mimeograph machines, and ar e widely posted on the W orld Wide Web. They are not a part of Freedom Is A Two-Edged Sword , though the near futur e may see collected writings of John P arsons printed under one cover. The working began January 4, 1946. At 9 p.m. Parsons wrote, “I fol- lowed this procedure for eleven days, from January 4 to 15,” which is actually 12 days. Presumably, Parsons miscounted and carried on the working for one e xtra day, a simple mistak e difficult to belie ve of a rocket scientist. To begin the working, Parsons chose one of the squar es from the Enochian “Air Tablet” (there are four 12-by-13 tablets, one for each element), also known as the “Great Watch-Tower of the East.” He did not record which of the 156 possible squares he chose. After prepar- ing the other magical w eapons, at 9 p.m. he pr epared and conse- crated his “Air Dagger.” An actual dagger purchased for this purpose, the weapon, he said, was the “special talisman of the operation.” Par sons then copied the s ymbols contained within the chosen square onto virgin parchment. These symbols consist of one of the seven planetary signs, one of the 12 zodiacal signs, a unique permu- tation of the four signs of the elements, and an Enochian letter in the center. Present as “Scribe” for the entir e operation was none other than Hubbard, in what w ould eventually resemble the Dee-K elley operation. The ritual was ready to begin. Par sons first invoked the “P entagram of Air ,” a fiv e-pointed star traced in the air with the dagger. It starts at the upper right-hand point of the star, representing water, goes left to wards air, then tr aces the remainder of the star thr ough fire (lower right), spirit (top), earth 119 The Babalon Working: January–February 1946"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"(lower left), then back to water. As he proceeds in the ritual, the magi- cian must visualize the outline of the pentagram in brilliant purple (dif- ferent for each element inv oked) as w ell as the s ymbol of air in the center. This ritual includes the oft-hear d recitation invoking the four archangels as representatives of the four cardinal directions, and hence the four elements. “Before me, Raphael; Behind me, Gabriel,” etc. Par sons probably should ha ve invoked with the he xagram next, which is the w ay the rite usually goes , but he does not r ecord this being done. It may be that he assumed this step w as understood, or that he deliberately left it out of his writing to deter prying eyes from repeating his oper ation. There are hexagrams invoked later in the operation, during the inv ocation of the “Six Senior s,” and he ma y have felt these were sufficient. Next Parsons recited from memory the “Invocation of the Bornless One,” a short invocation translated by Crowley and appearing at the beginning of his and Mathers’ translation of the Goetia, or Lesser Key of Solomon . It starts: Thee I invoke, the Bornless One. Thee, that didst create the Earth and the Heavens. Thee, that didst create the Night and the Day. Thee, that didst create the Darkness and the Light. Thou art Osorronophris, whom no man hath seen at any time. Thou art Jabas. Thou art Japos. Thou hast distinguished between the Just and the Unjust. Thou didst make the Female and the Male. Thou didst produce the Seed and the Fruit. Thou didst form Men to love one another, and to hate one another. I am Mosheh [Moses] Thy Prophet, unto whom Thou didst commit Thy Mysteries, the Ceremonies of Ishrael [sic]. Thou didst pr oduce the moist and the dr y, and that which nour- isheth all created Life. Dear Thou Me, for I am the Angel of Paphr o Osorronophris; this is Thy True Name, handed down to the Prophets of Ishrael . . .” The original inv ocation is tr aditionally ascribed to Moses , but it bears an Egyptian flavor reflecting the mysteries of Egypt, into which the Bible says Moses was initiated. Later v ersions “corrected” some of the spellings to bring them in line with Cr owley’s w ork: “Osorronophris” became ASAR UN-NEFER (a form of Osiris), for example. 120 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"It would have been this corr ected version that P arsons used. The complete text can be found in “Liber Samekh” in Cr owley’s Magick , and represents the lengthy rite Crowley used at Boleskine to attain to the Knowledge and Conv ersation of his Holy Guar dian Angel and thus to the 6°= 5 of the A ∴ A ∴ , in the v ersion quoted abo ve. Although evidently undocumented, it is possible that success during this ritual would have allowed Parsons to claim the 6°=5 . Par sons next recorded a “Conjuration of Air,” a “Consecration of the Air Dagger” (apparently a redundancy), and the Key Call of the Third Aire, the latter of which is not to be confused with the element Air. The dagger is one of the four standard magical weapons used by the magician. The other three are the pentacle (or disk), the cup, and the wand. 11 It seems that P arsons actually r ecited the “Thir d Key” (or Thir d Call), which is different from the Key Call of the Third Aire, as there is only one Key Call for all 30 Aires. However, the Third Call is appro- priate to summon EXARP , the Angel of the Air T ablet, so it seems to have been a mistake in nomenclature only. In other words, Parsons used the correct call but called it by the wrong name in his notes. The Third Key, in English, is: Behold! Saith your God! I am a circle on whose hands stand twelve Kingdoms. Six ar e the seats of living br eath: the r est are sharp Sickles, or the Horns of Death. Wherein the creatures of earth are and are not, except in mine own hands; which sleep and shall rise! In the first I made ye stewards, and placed ye in twelve seats of government: giving unto ever y one of you power successively over the 456 true ages of time: to the intent that fr om the highest ves- sels and the cor ners of your gover nments you might work my Power, pouring down the fires of life and increase continually on the earth. Thus you are become the skirts of Justice and Truth. In the name of the same your God, lift up, I say , yourselves! Behold! His Mercies flourish, and His Name is become mighty among us. In whom we say: Move! Descend! And apply yourselves unto us as unto the par takers of His Secr et Wisdom in your Creation. All this invocation should have been done from memory. Next was an Invocation of God and of the King associated with the Air Tablet. 121 The Babalon Working: January–February 1946 11.

Par sons next invoked the Six Senior s of the Air T ablet, whose names are HABIORO, AAOZXAIF, HTNMORDA, AHAOZAPI, AVTOTAR, and HIPOTGA . They are equivalent to the “airy” parts of Mars, Jupiter, the Moon, Venus, Mercury, and Saturn, r espectively—six of the se ven “planets” visible to the nak ed eye, the seventh (the King) being the Sun, the same as the se ven days of the w eek, albeit in a differ ent order. The Kings and Seniors are each invoked with their own special hexagram, in this case a He xagram of Air. Thus Parsons drew seven consecutive hexagrams in the air, visualizing the appropriate names and colors and pronouncing the names, then addressing each in turn, individually, with certain Enochian greetings. Again, from memory. The next step is rather hazy in the record. Parsons says he invoked “blank by blank and blank to visible appearance.” OTO scholars have filled in the first and last blanks, but the middle one remains a mys- tery. This first is written as RDZA , by which is sur ely meant ARDZA , Enochian for “He who protects,” one of the “Calvary Cross” names, another long series that forms a certain pattern of letter s traced out on the four elemental tablets. ARDZA is the name that controls the force of the “Air of Air” (upper left) quadrant of the Air Tablet. This force, not recorded by Parsons, is named IDOIGO , “He who sits on the Holy Throne.” Since the upper left is where the letters ARDZA (in Enochian) appear on the Air Tablet, the proximate name IDOIGO is probably what Parsons left unrecorded in the middle blank, as that is the only possible complement to ARDZA in this rite. The last blank is filled in with the name EXARP , again the Angel of the Air Tablet, who controls all forces associated with the element of Air, the Kings and Senior s being invoked merely to preside over the rite. Parsons would have been facing the dir ection of the pr evailing winds in Pasadena while invoking EXARP and, indeed, throughout the entire ceremony. 12 The next statement is the simplest in Parsons’ magical record, yet it is also the most important. P arsons merely writes, “Invocation of 122 sex and r ockets 12. Some versions read XARP —the final E is added to denote the element of Air."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"wand with material basis on talisman,” the “material basis” of which is the “Marrow of the Wand,” the Wand, of course, representing the penis or phallus of the magician, while the Marr ow is the semen. During the rite, the magician is to inv oke the spirit and, while con- centrating upon it, masturbate o ver the talisman. P arsons here was “energizing,” even “fertilizing” the little par chment square bearing the chosen square from the Air Tablet, the form s ympathetic magic takes: a symbolic fertilizing of Parsons’ desire through a very literal application of the usual means of fertilization. Crude , perhaps, but traditional. Par sons then wrote “Invocation with [Air] Dagger,” presumably an invocation of the elemental he wished to attr act, although he does not say. Lastly ar e the “License to Depart,” a purification, and the banishings, which ar e a sign that the rite is o ver. The License to Depart is in the Goetia, or Lesser Key of Solomon, which Mathers and Crowley had translated years earlier. The first English-language edi- tion appeared in 1903. The License to Depart runs, “O thou Spirit N . [name of spirit, in this case EXARP ], because thou has diligently answered unto my demands, and hast been v ery ready and willing to come at m y call, I do her e license thee to depart unto thy proper place; without causing harm or danger unto man or beast. Depart, then, I say, and be thou very ready to come at my call, being duly e xorcised and conjured by the sacred rites of magic. I charge thee to withdraw peaceably and quietly, and the peace of God be e ver continued between thee and me! Amen!” The invocation also occur s in Cr owley’s later Magick , as w ell as in other texts by various authors. Banishings are as equally inv olved as the inv ocations, as the y involve recreating (or, rather, “erasing”) the various hexagrams and finally the pentagram in reverse of the original way they were traced. Needless to say, this is a very long ceremony, lasting at least an hour, and again, all fr om memory. All the Kings and Senior s have to be banished, one at a time . Interestingly, the pr ocedure outlined her e from the initial pentagram to the final banishing is slightly differ ent from the textbook Enochian invocations. Parsons must have impro- vised somewhat. In 1943, Parsons had published a brief poem in the Oriflamme , an OTO publication: I hight Don Quixote, I live on peyote, marijuana, morphine and cocaine, 123 The Babalon Working: January–February 1946"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"I never know sadness, but only a madness that burns at the heart and the brain. I see each charwoman, ecstatic, inhuman, angelic, demonic, divine. Each wagon a dragon, each beer mug a flagon that brims with ambrosial wine. As documented by John Symonds and Robert Anton Wilson, nar- cotics and hallucinogens were a basic staple of Crowley’s magical diet, as the y e xist in esoteric cer emonies of se veral r eligions. Cr owley recorded using these drugs in his Confessions , as well as in the pub- lished portions of his Magical Record. Within the world of magick, it is well known that it is easier to induce astr al vision when one alter- nately dulls and e xcites the senses b y chemical means . Indeed, the role of drugs in magick is common, and it is fairly certain they were a part of the Babalon Working. In The Book of Law , ( AL II:22 ), for exam- ple, Crowley wrote, “To worship me [Nuit] tak e wine and str ange drugs whereof I will tell my prophet, & be drunk thereof!” In addition, Helen Parsons Smith told an intervie wer that Parsons got into drugs after their split in 1943, the same year he wrote his Don Quixote poem and three years before the Babalon Working. Apparently she had been his anchor to r eality, and, once she w as gone, he was wide open to just about anything. She continued to follo w the path of white mag- ick, she said, while he turned down another, darker path. Par sons’ drug use also manifests itself in “Nar cissus,” one of his poems from his later collection Songs for the Witch Woman , which is dedicated to Cameron, the woman Parsons would claim to be the ele- mental he had purportedly inv oked during the Babalon W orking. “Narcissus” reads: Drug me with drugs Slow acting, sensuous, sweet, Co-mingle gin and musk, Hashish and amber, Let me drink and breathe And hear slow, devious music Until aroused To subtle, languorous moods, Until I see Ochre and mazarine and purple 124 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Emit lascivious sounds.

And I shall perform stately Phallic arabesques In the moonlight, Pale and white. The possibly drug-enhanced w orking continued the e vening of January 5, when Parsons noted “a strong windstorm beginning sud- denly about the middle of the fir st invocation,” which was no sur- prise, as EXARP is the Angel of the Air Tablet. In writing, the “ first invocation,” Parsons was referring to the fact that he r epeated the entire rite after finishing it the fir st time. The entire process took a full two hours, such that Parsons must have been reciting at break- neck speed to finish so soon. On January 6, Parsons continued the invocation, which means he ran through the entire rite twice. The windstorm also continued. On January 7, he inv oked twice mor e, and the wind subsided. A t this point he began pla ying Sergei Prokofiev’s Violin Concerto No. 2 as background music; the actual recording of which is still a vailable to the diligent searcher. 13 The w orking continued, and on January 8 P arsons wr ote, “Invoked twice, using blood” (pr esumably as a substitute for the 125 The Babalon Working: January–February 1946 13. The concerto used by Parsons was Prokofiev’s Violin Concerto No. 2 in G Minor (Op. 63) , which was the only r ecording available at the time.

Prokofiev (1891–1953) was still alive at the time. Lasting just over 34 minutes, it is a haunting r ecording, though sentimental in places. It is unclear whether the Scribe restarted the record when it finished, or if the par- ticipants just allowed it to r un until it stopped. The original was a 78-rpm phonograph record, and its CD is available on Biddulph from England. It is also available as item num- ber 9167 in the Pearl-Koch catalog, entitled Jacha (sic) Heifetz Concerto Recordings Vol. II- Brahms et al. , a version released October 13, 1995 as par t of a two-disc set."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"“material basis” of January 4, or else applied to the W and directly à la Crowley’s Mass of the Phoenix ). On January 9, he wr ote, “Invoked twice, replenishing material basis,” which evidently means he did not apply the “material basis” (semen) to the talisman (the little par chment square) on the nights of the 5th through the 8th. In this sex magick, it seems he “invoked the w and” (gained an er ection) but deliber ately denied himself release so the secretions (sperm) created would be absorbed by the body, a pr actice found in tantr a. This “magical masturbation” w as evidently carried out in front of the Scribe, i.e., Hubbard. On January 10, Parsons invoked twice and r etired to bed ar ound 11 p.m. He was awak ened at midnight b y nine loud, une xplainable knocks. 14 When Parsons got out of bed to inv estigate the knocks, he noticed a lamp la y smashed on the floor , which should ha ve been taken as an omen, as it is not the desired result and represents a mag- ical misdirection of energy. Parsons recognized as much in his record, but continued regardless. Considering Hubbard was the Scribe during this ritual, it is an interesting coincidence that HUBARD means “living lamps” in Enochian, as is the fact that a knocked-over lamp features in Dee and Kelley’s enterprise as well. On January 11, Parsons wrote, “Invoked twice, using blood,” and on the 12th, “Inv oked twice. A heavy windstorm.” The inv ocations and the windstorm both continued on the 13th. January 14 w as the second-to-last da y of the w orking—a very interesting day. As Parsons began invoking at 9 p.m., the electricity went out. Parsons records that “another magician who had been stay- ing in the house and studying with me w as carrying a candle across the kitchen when he w as struck strongly on the right shoulder, and the candle knocked out of his hand.” According to Cameron and oth- ers, this other magician was Hubbard, which is odd in that Hubbard was consistently referred to as “Scribe” throughout Parsons’ record of the Babalon Working, rather than “magician,” indicating the r ecord may have been garbled here. He [the other “magician”] called us [the “us” appar ently referring to Parsons and some unknown other] and we observed a brownish yellow light about seven feet high in the kitchen.

This occurrence is curiously similar to the nine r egular knocks that Whitley Strieber felt confirmed the existence of his otherworldly Visitors in his “non-fiction” book Communion .

His [the other magician’s] right arm was paralyzed for the rest of the night. The final day was January 15, when Parsons wrote: At this time the Scribe [Hubbar d] developed some sor t of astral vision, describing in details an old enemy of mine of whom he had never heard [Captain Kynette, the car-bombing cop?], and later the guardian for ms of Isis and the Ar changel Michael. Later , in my room, I heard the [nine] raps again, and a buzzing, metallic voice crying “let me go fr ee.” I felt a gr eat pressure and tension in the house that night, which was also noticed by the other occupants. There was no other phenomena, and I admit a feeling of disap- pointment. Par sons sleepily performed the License to Depart, and the spirit was free to return to its home. In his record of the working Parsons wrote that the “tension and unease continued for four days” and that he didn’t know what to do next. Around this time , Jane W olfe wrote to Cr owley, “Last e vening, when Jack brought me these various papers for me to post to y ou, I saw, for the first time, the small boy, or child. This is it that is bewil- dered, does not quite kno w when to tak e hold in this matter , or where, and is completely bowled over by the ruthlessness of Smith— Smith, who has a master hand when it comes to dealing with this boy.” Also around this time, Wilfred Smith described his o wn state to Crowley: Ill started, ill maintained, ill ter minated. The shrine is desolate of the divine; has ever been; and I am completely empty; so much so, I do not know if I write accurately about myself. In fact I don’t know anything at all. Have nothing; am nothing . . . The worst of it is, I have some years yet to go and the prospect of having to live with myself is—I assur e you—not at all pleasant. For I can’t see but that my brain will continually flog me till I go to sleep once and for all. I have ill understood your dealings with me these many years, and I am no better infor med at this moment.

Possible connective result: loss of Betty’s affections as pr eliminary to (c) Inv ocation of Air Elemental Kerub [Cherub] . . . in Enochian Air Tablet.” The “suitable poetry” is not recorded in his account of the w orking. The rite ended with Par sons commanding the elemental to appear in human form. The “Kerub of the Air” of Air quadr ant is called ERZLA . There are four Kerubs for each of the four Tablets, and 12 Lesser Kerubic Angels and 16 Lesser Angels for each as w ell, part of the complicated (but highly structured) system. The Priest’s Call in the Gnostic Mass is a short recitation in Greek that the Priest makes when the Priestess is behind the veil. It appar- ently was a preliminary to the lengthy rites of the Babalon W orking (24 complete inv ocations in 12 da ys!) and is a call to the cr eative power of the Priest as represented by his “lance” (i.e., phallus). The call is: IO IO IO IAO SABAO KYRIE ABRASAX KYRIE MEITHRAS KYRIE PHALLE. IO PAN, IO PAN PAN, IO ISCHYROCH, IO A THANATON, IO ABROTON, IO IAO. CHAIRE PHALLE CHAIRE P ANPHAGE CHAIRE PANGENETOR.

Iao, Sabao, and Abr asax are Greek deities with long histories: They are solar in nature, and the rising sun is the Phallus invoked in the call. Following the working, Parsons was at first despondent: “Nothing seems to have happened. The windstorm is very interesting, but that is not what I ask ed for,” he wrote Crowley. On January 18, P arsons and Hubbard went into the Mojave Desert to relax. At sunset the feel- ing of tension suddenly left P arsons, and he turned to Hubbar d “in absolute certainty that the oper ation was accomplished” and said simply, “It is done ,” echoing Jesus’ “It is finished” spok en on the cross. At this time, Grady McMurtry, whom Parsons met at a science fic- tion meeting, r eturned from England and mo ved to San F rancisco 128 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"with the intent of starting a lodge there. He spent the week of January 14th to the 2 0th at 1003 S. Or ange Grove, interviewing the v arious members of the lodge to determine what w as going on and what could be done about it. Cr owley had sent him in to see if ther e was any way to fix the mess he had been hearing about. McMurtry’ s report is dated January 25 and includes signed statements fr om Par sons and several others. Parsons was surprised to see McMurtry, who had left as an inferior in the Or der, return as his superior. McMurtry told Crowley that Parsons was “. . . a man of integrity and aspiration, all he lacks is an e xperienced instructor. He is easily the outstanding personality of the whole group.” He also mentioned a new female interest of Parsons’ named Helen Parker, but apparently nothing of note developed between the two. McMurtry’s report found the lodge in a mess, as many of the mem- bers were bickering about almost everything, yet he saw hope for the future. Parsons, he said, was “shaking the debris of A gape from his shoulders and preparing to make a clean start with a more ambitious program than ever. A lesser man would have washed his hands of the whole affair.” McMurtry further outlined a pr ogram of adv ertising, initiation, training, and performance of the Gnostic Mass as the immediate needs of the lodge . Parsons wanted to incorpor ate the OTO , which McMurtry endorsed. Parsons would stay in Pasadena with the Agape Lodge, while McMurtry would return to San Francisco and open the Thelema Lodge. This plan did not materialize until 1977, long after Par sons’ death. Par sons w anted to pur sue the adv ertising campaign as a “Synagogue of Satan”; McMurtry thought this angle w as fine for some but not all-inclusive. He wanted to pursue a less sensationalis- tic campaign in San Francisco, modeled after the Abbey of Thelema in Cefalu, Sicily. McMurtry closes b y referring to A gape Lodge as “Hodge P odge Lodge,” which he sa ys the r esidents of 1 003 S. Or ange Grove call “Ghastly Gables.” Neither title is flattering. P arsons’ attached state- ment says that he sold the big home to finance an e xplosives manu- facturing plant, such that he e vidently didn’t o wn the house v ery long. Another member, Max Schneider, with whom Parsons seems to have been bickering the most, said Parsons was trying to “combine a Lodge, a pr ofess house, and a r ooming house for thrill seek ers all under one roof.” The other statements speak well of Parsons, but say that the influence of Smith was still too strong. 129 The Babalon Working: January–February 1946"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"One interesting remark was made b y Roy Leffingwell, who told McMurtry that P arsons w as “impr egnating statuettes with a vital force by invocation, and then selling the statuettes .” He further said that Parsons reminded him “of the y oung Crowley—he is so set on overturning the present system that he will stop at nothing.” No men- tion is made of the Babalon Working in any of McMurtry’s reports. Par sons’ disappointment at the r esults of the w orking had been alleviated by the ne xt month, when, on F ebruary 23, 1946, he tri- umphantly wrote to Crowley, “I have my elemental! She turned up one night after the conclusion of the Oper ation, and has been with me since, although she goes back to Ne w York next week. She has red hair and slant gr een eyes as specified. She is an artist, str ong- minded and determined, with strong masculine characteristics and a fanatical independence. If she returns she will be dedicated as I am dedicated!” The elemental w as Marjorie Elizabeth Camer on, sprung fr om Par sons’ head like Sophia from the Godhead or P allas Athena from Zeus. She actually arriv ed at the lodge befor e Parsons left for the desert with Hubbar d. McMurtry had just left, and the Babalon Working w as still in pr ogress (but w as not kno wn to Camer on). Cameron came back tw o weeks later after some friends of P arsons tracked her down at the emplo yment office. This time she came to stay. Par sons described Cameron as an “air of fire type with bronze red hair, fiery and subtle, determined and obstinate, sincere and perverse, with e xtraordinary per sonality, talent, and intelligence .” She remained in the dark about the Babalon W orking until long after it was finished—even though she was to participate in its ne xt phase. Par sons made her a protective talisman, which she wore around her neck for years until police took it a way because it had a potent poi- son sealed inside. Par sons exultantly wrote in his notes that Camer on answered all the requirements of the elemental he had inv oked. She adopted the magical name “Candida” (the Latin root of “candid”), calling herself “Candy” for short. He wr ote that she “demonstr ated the natur e of woman to you [referring to himself] in such unequiv ocal terms that you [Parsons] should have no further r oom for illusion on the sub- ject.” Parsons and Cameron would marry in October of that year, just eight months later.

Marjorie Cameron was born on April 23, 1922 in Belle Plain, Iowa, which is located in Benton County in east centr al Iowa. Her parents were Hill Lislie Camer on, originally fr om Illinois , and Carrie V . Ridenour, a nativ e of Io wa. Cameron actually gr ew up in northern Wisconsin, “ a country of fer ocious gr andeur.” When she met Par sons, she was 5 ′ 5 ′′ , 126 pounds, fair-complected with freckles, red hair and blue (not green) eyes. An “air of fire type,” as Parsons called her, is typically a Leo in the Enochian s ystem (on the Fir e Tablet rather than the Air T ablet), and is associated with the Prince of Wands in the Tarot. Cameron had served in the WAVES during WWII , at which time she had been stationed in W ashington, D.C. She had also serv ed as an aide to the Joint Chiefs of Staff ther e, after entering the Na vy as an Apprentice Seaman on December 9, 1942 at Chicago, Illinois . She was honorably discharged from Washington, D.C. as a photographer on November 16, 1945, after which she moved to Los Angeles, where one of her Na vy friends took her to the A gape Lodge. Interestingly, Cameron, Hubbard and Heinlein were all in the Navy. A Freedom of Information Act request revealed that the FBI had no file on her. From January 19 (the very day Cameron arrived!) to February 27, Par sons daily recorded that he “invoked the Goddess BABALON with the aid of m y magical partner, as was proper to one of m y grade.” 131 The Babalon Working: January–February 1946"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The magical partner was, of course, Cameron, though some writers have tried to make it Hubbard, who was in actuality not present. The grade Parsons referred to is the IX ° of the OTO , a rite involving sex- ual intercourse in much the w ay that the VIII ° involves masturba- tion. However, Parsons evidently never held this grade, nor was this a IX °working, based on the w ay Crowley ran the higher gr ades in the 1940s. At that time, Agape Lodge was the only operating lodge of the OTO . Members there could request the grade, as it were, and Crowley would confirm their right to w ork it despite the fact that they had not attained the intermediate grades. However, just because a few members were working with the IX ° material does not mean they could demonstr ate attainment, as ther e were no other legiti- mate IX ° members present to guide them and confirm their r esults. The Babalon Working in particular was far too unorthodox to have been a part of this degr ee; it was specially designed by Parsons for this one purpose. According to Camer on, the rite consisted of her and P arsons spending two weeks in bed. Unfortunately, Parsons did not record the details of his daily inv ocations, or if he did the y have not survived. Cameron said the two talked incessantly: “He educated me . . . that’s what he w as supposed to do.” She also r elated that he made her aware she “had a mission in the world.” Of course, she was ignorant of the entire Babalon Working, of which she was supposed to be the elemental invoked, until well past its completion. On February 27, Camer on went back to Ne w York to visit her boyfriend, a photogr apher named Napoleon, spending tw o w eeks there, during which time she dumped him. She later said she returned to Pasadena when she discovered she was pregnant by Parsons. The day after she left for New York, Parsons returned to the Mojave Desert without Hubbard, who had gone a way for awhile, perhaps to the VA hospital in San Francisco. Parsons invoked Babalon in the desert, pre- sumably through a solo sexual rite of some sort, though he does not say. What r esulted was phenomenal: “The pr esence of the Goddess came upon me,” he wrote, “and I was commanded to write the fol- lowing communication.” The communication Parsons was commanded to write w as Liber 49 , often mistakenly referred to as The Book of Babalon , of which it is only a part. Liber 49 is too long to reproduce here, but it has been reproduced widely in print and on the internet in unauthorized v er- sions.

Besides being two sevens side-by-side, 77 is 7 × 11, and 11, as we have already seen, is the number of Crowley’s magick. Par sons came to see Liber 49 as the fourth chapter of The Book of the Law . Parsons saw the four chapters as corresponding to the four letters of the ineffable name of God: YHWH , the Hebrew Yod Hé Vau Hé . He assigned one chapter to each letter and to what each letter represented: Father, Mother, Son, Daughter , or God, Holy Ghost, Christ, and the gnostic Sophia, the Puer, Vir, Puella, Mulier of Liber 36 . Of the 77 original verses of Liber 49 , 73 survive. Liber 49 begins: 1. Yea, it is I, BABALON . 2. And this is my book, that is the four th chapter of the Book of the Law , Hé completing the Name, for I am out of NUIT by HORUS , the incestuous sister of RA-HOOR-KHUIT .

Two mention the number 1 1, albeit one incorr ectly: Verse 65 calls it the number of a witches’ co ven, but that number is 13.

One of the entries in Cr owley’s magical record for the period reads, “He hath crucified a toad in his basilisk abode,” reflecting the time Crowley christened a frog “Jesus,” cruci- fied it, then ate its legs and burned the r est. This incident was a rit- ual affirmation of the super session of what Cr owley called “the slave-gods.” The “basilisk abode” refers to the womb, as tradition held that the basilisk, or “legendary reptile with fatal breath and glance,” was born of menstrual blood. In Greek, basileos means “king,” and the frog is a symbol of transition, living as it does in two worlds (water and dry land). Two chapters survive of P arsons’ original The Book of Babalon .

She did feel lik e she was in the middle of something, so much so that she felt as if she w ere “spy- ing.” Parsons wrote that he kne w not in whom Babalon w as incar- nate, but Cameron said he had been warned in the desert not to tell her it w as she. To prove herself to him, Camer on would provide a sign, which she claimed w as her sighting of a silv er, cigar-shaped UFO . This incident was the only time the two ever discussed UFO s, she said. She actually derided his magick at the time, but later proved to herself that it worked. On March 1, P arsons again pr epared the altar and the v arious magical weapons, this time “in accor dance with the instructions in Liber 49 .” What changed? In verses 18 through 22, Babalon specifies sandalwood incense, a green and gold cloth to co ver the altar, her book (Liber 49) and the other magical implements , including a three-inch copper disk with the sevenfold Star of Babalon painted in gold on a blue back ground, which w as to be the ne w talisman, replacing the parchment talisman of the original Enochian rite . The talisman was to be anointed in much the same w ay, although this time with the se xual secr etions of both partner s—Parsons and Cameron. The operation began as directed on March 2, when Hubbard, who had been away since the 27th or 28th of F ebruary, returned with a description of “a vision he had that e vening of a savage and beauti- ful woman riding naked on a great cat-like beast,” Parsons wrote. “He [Hubbard] was impressed with the ur gent necessity of giving me [Parsons] some message or communication. W e prepared magically for this communication, constructing a temple at the altar with the analysis of the key word [ INRI ]. He was robed in white, carrying the lamp, and I in black, hooded, with the cup and dagger [tw o of the magical weapons].

In regard to Hubbard’s vision of the catlike beast and naked woman, it should be recalled that Crowley repeatedly referred to the Beast and his Scarlet Woman in the Book of Revelation, which Crowley identified as him- self and his curr ent consort, corr esponding also to the Gnostic- Christian heresiarch Simon Magus and his Helen. The w oman was Sophia incarnate, and Hubbard’s vision was once again seen as the cover picture for the fir st edition of Williamson’ s Darker Than You Think (from 1948). It is uncertain whether or not the tape recording of the March 1946 session still e xists, but the incr edible transcript has surviv ed, how- ever, quoted here verbatim, since a summary would not do it justice.

Upon the completion of Babalon’ s message, Parsons immediately set about following the instructions dictated by her, as well as those received the night before (March 1), although he did not record what those instructions were. As a part of this March 2 ceremony, he recited passages from sev- eral key works of Crowley’s and elsewhere, passages that are vital to understanding the rite: 1. The Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram. 137 The Babalon Working: March 1946 20. A statue of Pan was destroyed. 21.

Par sons opened with an esoteric analy sis of what he called “the key w ord,” INRI , which is a part of the “Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram” he actually performed, though he did not r ecord the fact by name and only wrote “analysis of the key word.” He probably also performed the other rituals of the He xagram and Pentagram, but he does not say. Par sons recorded the analy sis of the k ey word as follo ws: “The temple is opened with the analy sis of the k ey word: INRI . Yod Nun Resh Yod . Virgo Isis Mighty Mother. Scorpio Apophis Destroyer. Sol, Osiris slain and risen. IAO . The sign of Osiris slain (giv en). The sign of the mourning of Isis (giv en). The sign of Apophis and T yphon (given). L.V.X. , Lux, the Light of the Cross.” During the ritual, the magician must adopt at each stage of the analysis certain postures. Crossed arms, for example, represent Osiris slain, as the posture a corpse takes during burial. The entire ritual is recorded by Crowley in Magick and elsewhere. The gods invoked are Egyptian gods. INRI is not a word but an acronym, representing the initials of the message Pontius Pilate had nailed upon the cross in the gospel story: Iesus Nazaraeus Rex Iudaeorum , Latin for “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.” The acronym is often seen depicted in paintings of the cru- cifixion, possibly arising as a painter’ s expedient. Medieval clerics manipulated the letters to find different phrases that described Jesus while conforming to the same acronym. Mystics and alchemists found other, less orthodox interpretations as well. In Morals and Dogma , Albert Pike gives a few possible mean- ings of INRI , withholding the one which he sa ys Masons learn when they attain the 18th degr ee of Scottish Rite F reemasonry, known as Knight Rose Croix (Rose Cross). The meanings Pik es does give are: Igne Natura Renovatur Integra (All of Natur e is R enewed by Fire); Igne Nitrum Roris Invenitur (The Cleanser of Fire Comes Like Dew); and the Jesuits’ alleged Iustum Necare Reges Impius (To Judge not but the Impiety of Royalty). 22 138 sex and r ockets 22.

Crowley records a few of the interpr etations in his Sepher Sephiroth (“Book of Books”): Igni Natura Renovata Regnum (Birth by Fire R enews the Kingdom), Intra Nobis R egnum deI (Within the Noble is the Kingdom of God), and e ven Isis Natur ae R egina Ineffabilis (Isis, the Ineffable Queen of Natur e). This last interpreta- tion may be the one Pike chose to withhold; it also hearkens back to John Dee and Queen Elizabeth. In the gospel tale , the original message w as posted in thr ee lan- guages: Latin, Ar amaic (Hebrew), and koine Greek. Yod Nun R esh Yod are the Hebrew names for the letters INRI . They are also words in the Hebrew tongue: hand-fish-head-hand, respectively. Each of these has further esoteric meanings that could be e xpanded indefinitely. The hand, for instance, represents the creative force, as it is with our hands that we build tools, heal the sick, express our love. Yod is also Hebrew slang for “penis ,” another sort of cr eative power. Nun , the fish, is Scorpio, hence death. Resh is the back of the head, and looks like a large yod ; for this r eason Crowley associated it with the kun- dalini , the mysterious energy source in yoga that runs along the spine and out the top of the head. A whole treatise could be written on the analysis of INRI ; the same could be said of TARO , which Babalon men- tioned on March 2. The analysis complete, the invoking hexagrams are drawn in the air in the four car dinal directions (representing the four elements), and the name ARARITA “vibrated” in each quarter . When one “vibrates” a name, it is not merely spoken but visualized as written, originating within the magician and going outw ard until it fills the entire universe. ARARITA is also mentioned in the Star-Sapphire ritual from The Book of Lies and is a Hebrew acronym for one of the names of God. The second part of Parsons’ invocation is from the Gnostic Mass, recited as the Priest steps onto the fir st step leading to the altar, and as the Priestess disrobes behind the veil. Parsons recited the part of the Priest, and Camer on (representing Babalon) r ecited the part of the Priestess: THE PRIEST : “O cir cle of Stars [the Milky W ay] whereof our Father [the sun] is but the younger br other, mar vel beyond imagination, soul of infinite space, befor e whom T ime is ashamed, the mind bewildered, and the understanding dark, not unto Thee may we attain, unless Thine image be Love. Ther efore by seed and r oot 139 The Babalon Working: March 1946"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"and stem and bud and leaf and flower and fruit do we invoke thee.” [Parsons deleted the second par t of this invocation, which is a quote of AL I:27]. THE PRIESTESS [here Parsons actually wr ote “ BABALON ”]: “But to love me is better than all things; if under the night-stars in the desert thou presently burnest mine incense befor e me, invoking me with a pur e heart and the Serpent flame [kundalini] ther ein, thou shalt come a little to lie in my bosom. For one kiss wilt thou then be willing to give all. But whoso gives one par ticle of dust shall lose all in that hour . Ye shall gather goods and stor e of women and spices; ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shall exceed the nations of earth in splendour and pride; but always in the love of me, and so shall ye come to my joy . I char ge you ear nestly to come before me in a single r obe, and cover ed with a rich head dress. I love you! I year n to you! Pale or purple, veiled or volup- tuous, I who am all pleasure and purple, and drunkenness of the innermost sense, desir e you.

I love you! I am the blue-lidded daugh- ter of Sunset, I am the naked brilliance of the voluptuous night sky. To me! To me!” This priestess’s recitation is an expansion of AL I:61. The third part of the invocation comes from Crowley’s The Vision and the Voice and was part of his w orking of the 12th Air e in 1909, spoken to Crowley by a celestial “charioteer”: Glory unto the Scarlet W oman, BABALON 23 the Mother of Abominations, that rideth upon the Beast, for She hath spilt their blood in ever y corner of the ear th, and lo! She hath mingled it in the cup of Her whoredom. With the breath of Her kisses hath she fermented it, and it hath become the wine of the Sacrament; the wine of the Sabbath; and in the Holy Assembly hath She pour ed it out for Her worshippers; and they have become dr unken thereon, so that face to face they beheld my Father .

For She is Love, and Her Love is one, and She has divided the one love into infinite loves, and each love is one, and equal with the One, and therefore is She passed from the Assembly and the Law and the enlightenment into the anar chy of solitude and darkness. For ever thus must She veil the brilliance of Herself. Par sons actually abbr eviated this passage , as he did with the excerpt from the Gnostic Mass , and did not r ecite it verbatim. It is longer in the original. The fourth invocation was, “ O BABALON, BABALON beloved, come now, partake of the sacrament, possess this shrine. Take me now! Let me be drunken on the wine of your fornications; let your kisses wan- ton me to death. Accept thou this sacrifice willingly given!” This pas- sage seems to ha ve been an original v erse by Parsons, not found anywhere in the works of Crowley. The fifth inv ocation was written as the K ey Call of the Se venth Aire, but the text Parsons recorded is actually the Se venth Call, evi- dently the same type of shift P arsons made when he wr ote that he used the “Key Call of the Third Aire” but actually utilized the Thir d Call. The Seventh Call in English is: The East is a house of Virgins singing praises among the flames of first glory [the rising sun] wherein the Lord hath opened his mouth; and they are become 28 living dwellings [the phases of the moon, hence days] in whom the str ength of man r ejoiceth; and they ar e apparelled with ornaments of brightness, such as work wonders on all creatures.

The following is the original Enochian, in Roman letters.

In Par sons’ notes he has replaced “ IAD ” with “ BABALON .” The sixth invocation was from Crowley’s play Tannhäuser , alter- nating v erses originating with the w orshiper and his goddess . A Wagnerian opera, Tannhäuser was based on a 13th-century German epic poem. The main character, Tannhäuser, was a mortal who spent some time as the goddess V enus’ lover but e ventually left her to return to earth and the sweetheart of his youth. Tannhäuser inadver- tently reveals his try st with Venus, a disclosur e that means certain death. His mortal love, Elisabeth, pleads for his life, and he is spared but banished as punishment for his deed. Alone, he longs for Venus. She hears him, and is about to r eturn him to her when Elisabeth intervenes once again. Tannhäuser is redeemed, and is escorted b y angels to paradise. Here again, P arsons and Camer on probably took turns r eciting their respective lines. Parsons played the part of T annhäuser, while Cameron was Venus. Parsons began the romantic interlude: Isis art thou, and from thy life are fed All showers and suns, all moons that wax and wane, All stars and streams, the living and the dead, The mystery of pleasure and of pain Thou art the mother, thou the speaking sea Thou art the earth, and its fertility, Life, death, love, hatred, light, darkness return to thee To Thee!

After the completed invocation, which was more like a bard’s love poem, Parsons burned the Enochian Air T ablet he had used in the January stage of this w orking. He then smashed a small statue of Pan, which had been a fa vorite possession. He r ecorded that at the same instant the r oof on his guest house caught fir e and was dam- aged, apparently attributing this destruction to supernatur al forces, although the burning parchment may have had something to do with it as well. Regarding such sacrifices as the smashed statue , Crowley’s Liber Astarte , verse 37, reads: Having made by thine Ingenium a talisman or pantacle to represent the particular Deity, and consecrated it with infinite love and car e, do thou burn it ceremonially before the shrine, as if thereby giving up the shadow for the substance. But it is useless to do this unless thou do r eally in thine hear t value the talisman beyond all else that thou hast. Crowley noted in his Confessions , “I have noticed that every time 143 The Babalon Working: March 1946"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"I receive an important initiation, some cherished article mysteriously disappears.

The theory is that the elementals or familiar spir- its in attendance on the Magician e xact, so to speak, a tip on all important occasions of r ejoicing.” In such magical w orkings, evi- dently, if y ou don’t offer something to the spirits , they will tak e it anyway. At 1 1:30 p.m. that same night, P arsons prepared three questions as directed, and at midnight he ask ed them of Babalon (and w as answered through Hubbard). How can I communicate dir ectly with BABALON , hear her , see her, feel her, be sure that I am working aright? At the altar in meditation, as you know how. Also, invoke me car- nally with all your passion. Thus will you feel my desir e and increase my substance. How can I serve best? Follow instructions exactly and in detail.

While meditating the following morning, Parsons was interrupted by one of his tenants , whom he then cur sed “in the Anglo-Sax on fashion.” The man became ill, and Parsons realized he had erred. He apologized to him, but the day continued badly. That night Babalon purportedly continued her message, but the speaker, curiously, seems to be another (all parenthetical remarks are copied from the original): In the presence of our Lord PAN , at the feet of Our Lady BABALON , at the feet of Her (servants?)

At this point, Hubbard rested a while, then they continued. 145 The Babalon Working: March 1946 24. The “black box” is evidently the same as the scr ying device used by Dee and Kelley. Karl Germer thought the sign “imprinted upon it” to be a small cir cle inside of which was inscribed an inver ted triangle—the sign for water , but inside a cir cle. Cameron remem- bered otherwise. 25. Following this instruction, Parsons deliberately omitted recording one line of the message."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Begin four hours prior to dawn.

This last instruction certainly refers to Parsons’ poem, “The Birth of Babalon,” which, fortunately for us, survived the flames. The mys- tical yet racy message continued: Now thou shalt flame the third, chanting the invocation. She is born in the third flame. In verse, seven verses of seven lines, seven magick wor ds.

The instruction was followed by “a prophecy” of unknown length, which Parsons deliberately omitted recording. Directly following the message , Parsons records instead a poem entitled “The Birth of Babalon” that he wr ote as a means b y which to invoke Babalon. It is unclear at which point in these pr oceedings he used it, but it ma y have been the seventh part of the invocation, as a six-fold invocation makes little sense here. Parsons also seems to have ignored the instructions to burn it, already noted. A longish, well-composed poem, “The Birth of Babalon” begins: What is the tumult among the stars that have shone so still till now? What are the furrows of pain and wrath upon the immor tal brow? Why is the face of God turned grey and his angels all grown white? What is the terrible ruby star that burns down the crimson night? What is the beauty that flames so bright athwar t the awful dawn?

All the tests are right, all the signs are right. There is no danger, save in weakness or pride. Although he claimed there was no danger, in his metaphysical life, the fearless Parsons thus showed the same methodology he used in his rocket propulsion work, a tenaciousness in testing and a thrill- seeker’s lack of caution concerning what he ma y “conjure.” Secretly Par sons did write the name of the “One , who is most Holy and Beautiful”: he called her Babalon . He further directed Crowley to con- tact no one sa ve himself or Hubbar d r egarding this matter . Unfortunately, he does not seem to have tested this spirit with the rig- orousness of his r ocket-testing or thor oughness that Cr owley used 148 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"when he w as contacted b y entities such as Abuldiz, Amalantr ah, Aiwass, and Lam. Crowley always required proofs during such con- tacts, proofs established b y the gematria of certain k ey words, i.e., the entity’s name, location, or some other word or phrase. If Parsons subjected “Babalon” to such a test, no record survives. Again Parsons wrote, “For the last three days I have performed an operation of birth, using the air tablet, the cup, and a female figur e [Cameron?], properly invoked by the wand [penis], then sealed up in the altar. Last night I performed an oper ation of symbolic birth and delivery.” This operation is not part of the instructions contained in Liber Astarte , which Liber 49 told him to enact, but it seems to have satisfied Parsons. On Mar ch 15, Cr owley sent P arsons an admonishment about Cameron: “I am particularly interested in what you have written me about the elemental [Camer on], because for some little time past I have been endea vouring to interv ene personally on y our behalf. I would however have you recall [Eliphas] Levi’s advice that ‘the love of the Magus for such things [elementals] is insensate and ma y destroy him.’” “Eliphas Lévi” was the pseudonym of Alphonse-Louise Constant, a “magic theoretician” who wrote two books, Dogma and Ritual of High Magic and History of Magic , published in 1854 and 1856, respectively. Although he died in 1875 in relative obscurity, his works gained popularity with F rench intellectuals such as Victor Hugo. Lévi’s popularity stems fr om his ability to be r omantic yet rational at the same time. Crowley was so impressed that he consid- ered himself the reincarnation of Lévi. Crowley’s claim to have inter- vened personally on Parsons’ behalf is interesting, as it certainly took place by use of the OTO ’s “key,” i.e., magically. Crowley cautioned Parsons yet again about his own worst traits, in the letter of March 15, 1946: It seems to me that there is a danger of your sensitiveness upset- ting your balance. Any experience that comes your way you have a tendency to over-estimate. The first fine careless rapture wears off in month or so, and some other experience comes along and car- ries you off on its back. Meanwhile you have neglected and bewil- dered those who are dependent on you, either from above or from below. I will ask you to bear in mind that you have one fulcr um for all your levers, and that is your original oath to devote yourself to rais- ing mankind. All experiences, all ef forts, must be referred to this; 149 The Babalon Working: March 1946"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"as long as it remains unshaken you cannot go far wrong, for by its own stability it will bring you back fr om any tendency to excess. At the same time, you being as sensitive as you ar e, it behoves [sic] you to be more on your guard than would be the case with the majority of people. As it had so many times before, the warning fell on deaf ears. The same da y, Parsons wrote Crowley a letter, in which he for- mally turned the operation of Agape Lodge over to Roy Leffingwell, so he could focus on his pr oject. Parsons wrote that the “ IX ths”— meaning Leffingwell, Jane Wolfe, and himself—would hold council monthly to discuss lodge policy. Whatever had happened to Parsons in the desert must ha ve been quite amazing for him to r eact so. He finally had dir ection, something he had lost when he sold out of Aer ojet—something he ne ver really had spiritually , except perhaps when he first encountered Crowley and the OTO . A letter dated one day later was sent to all Agape Lodge members, declaring Leffingwell “ex ecutive head” of the lodge. Crowley was now a dying man with a heroin problem brought on by his physician’s treatment of his r espiratory problems. As further letters arriv ed fr om the States , he became incr easingly unhapp y about Parsons’ claims, no doubt concerned about the futur e of his life’s work. On April 19, Crowley wrote Parsons, “You have got me completely puzzled by your remarks about the elemental—the danger of dis- cussing or copying anything. I thought I had a most morbid imagi- nation, as good as any man’s, but it seems I have not. I cannot form the slightest idea what you can possibly mean.” And to Karl Germer, Crowley wrote, “Apparently he, or Hubbard, or somebody, is pr oducing a Moonchild. I get fairly fr antic when I contemplate the idiocy of these goats.” 29 The purpose of Parsons’ Babalon Working seems to have been the birth of a child—the Moonchild—into whom Babalon would incarnate. It had said in The Book of the Law four decades earlier that this child would be “mightier than all the kings of the Earth” (AL III:45). Aleister Crowley had once thought F rater Achad was this magical child, the birth of which occurs on the astral plane rather than the physical and represents a possession of sorts . Jane Wolfe wrote that Jack P arsons might be this child, but Parsons himself thought differently. 150 sex and r ockets 29. The last word is often misquoted in secondar y sources as “louts.”"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"The fact that Cameron later claimed to have been impregnated by Par sons during their first two weeks together casts doubt upon the lit- eral application of the term Moonchild. She said she had an (illegal) abortion with Parsons’ consent (and another abortion later on), then just a few days later they were performing another working. If a lit- eral child were what he was seeking (remember, she didn’t know the purpose of the w orking), the purported pr egnancy probably would have gone another w ay. This abortion story actually serv es as good evidence that Parsons was looking for an adult female to arrive, per- haps in a manner similar to Cameron’s arrival. In any case, the “magical child” is an ages-old concept found in the m ythologies of certain cultur es. The magical child concept Par sons was pursuing was given definition by Crowley, of course. In De Arte Magica Aleister Crowley wrote, “It is said by certain initiates that to obtain Spiritual gifts, and to aid Nature, the Sacrament should be as it were a Nuptial of the Folk of the Earth; but that Magick is of the Daemon, and that b y a certain perversion of the Office, may be created Elementals fit to perform the will of the Magician.” The “per- version,” no doubt, refers to unorthodox acts of sex by which may be created elementals or “magical” children. Also called a “homunculus” (“little man”), the Moonchild’ s cre- ation is described in Cr owley’s novel by the same name, Moonchild (originally titled The Butterfly Net ): But other magicians sought to make this Homunculus in a way closer to nature. In all these cases they had held that environment could be modified at will by the application of telesmata or sympa- thetic figures. For example, a nine-pointed star would attract the influence which they called Luna—not meaning the actual moon, but an idea similar to the poets’ idea of her . By sur rounding an object with such stars, with similarly-disposed herbs, per fumes, metals, talismans, and so on, and by carefully keeping off all other influences by parallel methods, they hoped to invest the original object so treated with the Lunar qualities, and no others. (I am giv- ing the briefest outline of an immense subject.) Now then they pr o- ceeded to try to make the Homunculus on ver y curious lines. Man, said they, is merely a fer tilized ovum properly incubated. Heredity is ther e even at first, of course, but in a feeble degr ee. Anyhow, they could ar range any desir ed envir onment fr om the beginning, if they could only manage to nourish the embr yo in some artificial way—incubate it, in fact, as is done with chickens 151 The Babalon Working: March 1946"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"to-day. Furthermore, and this is the crucial point, they thought that by per forming this experiment in a specially pr epared place, a place protected magically against all incompatible for ces, and by invoking into that place some one for ce which they desired, some tremendously power ful being, angel or ar changel—and they had conjurations which they thought capable of doing this—that they would be able to cause the incar nation of beings of infinite knowl- edge and power, who would be able to bring the whole world into Light and Truth. I may conclude this little sketch by saying that the idea has been almost universal in one form or another; the wish has always been for a Messiah or Super man, and the method some attempt to produce man by artificial or at least abnormal means. Crowley speaks of a (female) magical child who would be the prod- uct of her envir onment rather than her her edity, a development that distinguishes magical childr en from the r egular type. One r elatively recent attempt at producing a messianic child occurred with the occult society of Theosophy, whose leaders at the time tried to raise the young Indian boy, Jiddhu Krishnamurti, as their own World Savior. The plan failed, as Krishnamurti e ventually abandoned the Theosophists and started his own movement, for which he became w orld-renowned. In Par sons’ case, however, he (and Crowley) seem to have been using the phrases “magical child” and “Moonchild” interchangeably—and not as literally as Crowley’s description would suggest. Although like Jones before him Parsons himself was viewed as the magical child, he e vidently felt otherwise , such that he w as deter- mined himself to pr oduce it—or, rather, her —as Parsons wrote of a female messiah. Indeed, the purpose of Parsons’ operation has been underemphasized, as the Babalon W orking itself was a preparation for what w as to come: a thelemic messiah. This messiah w ould mature in a magically influenced envir onment. She w ould then assume a leadership role. In addition, the word “child” was symbolic, intended not for an infant but for one w oman in particular (or per- haps even all women in general). It seems clear that P arsons was seeking not an idea but a living being, who evidently was not Cameron. “There was a desire to incar- nate,” he wrote. He considered Cameron his elemental, though he did occasionally (and par adoxically) refer to her Babalon—as she later did herself. But the Babalon W orking was clearly aimed at bringing Babalon down to earth from somewhere else. This plan backfired. 152 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"It was not nine months but nine y ears later that Cameron would claim to be Babalon herself and to have given birth to a magical child on the astr al plane. In the meantime , Parsons started to look else- where for this “child”—to a physical incarnation embodied in some unknown person. He wr ote, “The inv ocation of Babalon serv ed to exteriorize the Oedipus comple x; at the same time , because of the forces involved it produced extraordinary magical effects. However, this operation is accomplished and closed—you [referring to himself] should have nothing more to do with it—nor e ven think of it, until Her manifestation is r evealed, and proved beyond the shadow of a doubt.” With the Babalon Working, it may also be that Parsons was trying to compete against Smith for Crowley’s attention, even though Smith had been forced into exile. Indeed, the Babalon Working has parallels with Crowley’s Liber 132 , in which he exalted Smith in order to send him on a “retreat.” 153 The Babalon Working: March 1946"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"154 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"nine Parsons’ Final Years: 1946–1952 O n February 20, 1946, in between the two parts of the Babalon W orking, Parsons, Hubbard and Betty formed a compan y called “ Allied Enterprises .” T o Hubbar d’s $1,183.91, Parsons put up $2 0,970.80, which w as his “laundr omat money,” while y oung Betty contributed nothing. In this enterprise , they were to buy boats on the East Coast and sail them back to California for r esale (or to w them b y trailer, if cheaper). The y also stated an inter est in inv estments of a “v aried and eclectic natur e,” from which it may be inferred that they went beyond boats—perhaps into explosives. Some of the mone y, Parsons said, as did R ypinski, was used to buy the house at 1 003 S. Or ange Grove Ave. as w ell, which Parsons leased first. In April 1946, after the second part of the Babalon W orking, Ron left with Betty and $1 0,000 of the compan y’s mone y. Later that month Parsons started to think that they had cheated him. He threat- ened to chase them, but a call to Hubbar d soon calmed him do wn. Astrologer and initiate Louis Culling overheard the call and couldn’t believe the formerly angry P arsons could be so easily sw ayed. Par sons ended the call with, “I hope w e shall alw ays be partner s, Ron,” a comment that made Culling cringe. Culling wrote to Karl Germer on Ma y 12, “As you may know by this time, Brother Jack signed a partnership agreement with this Ron and Betty whereby all money earned by the three for life is equally divided between the three. As far as I can ascertain, Brother Jack has put in all of his money . . . meanwhile, Ron and Betty have bought a boat for themselves in Miami for about $10,000 and are living the life of Riley, while Brother Jack is living at rock bottom, and I mean rock bottom. It appear s that originally the y never secretly intended to bring this boat ar ound to the California coast to sell at a pr ofit, as they told Jack, but rather to have a good time on it on the east coast.” Indeed, Hubbard had written the Chief of Naval Personnel before he headed east, asking permission to sail to South America and China.

It is ver y good that he should come crawling back to the penitent’s form after thirty years, but I do not quite see how it is going to make up for the time he has wasted on his insane vanity, and you might let him know this view. I am glad that his submission should have taken place at this moment, however , because his case ser ves as ver y useful to quote in discussing the business of Jack Parsons . . . The question of Frater 210 [Parsons] seems to me very typical. He reminds me up to a point—though he is on a much lower plane than they—of two men who joined the Or der shortly after I took it over [Jones and Victor Neubur g]: both cases seem to me to have certain significance if applied to the present position of Frater 210. It seems to me on the infor mation of our Brethren in California (if we may assume them to be accurate) Frater 210 has committed both these errors [i.e., those of Jones and Neubur g]. Both cases were alike in this—that after a ver y short period of training both had more than fulfilled their early promise; they could claim not only attainment, but achievement—and that in no small degree. I am sorry that there is no possibility of making any similar claim on behalf of Frater 210 . . . He has got a miraculous illumination which rimes [sic] with noth- ing, and he has appar ently lost all his personal independence. From our brother’s [Louis Culling] account he has given away both his girl and his money—appar ently it is the or dinary confidence trick. Of course, I must suspend judgement until I have heard his side of the story, but he promised me quite a long while ago to write me a full explanation, and to date I have r eceived nothing from him . . . By June, a sadder but wiser P arsons could w ait no longer and went to Florida after Hubbar d and Betty, discovering they had pur- chased three boats. He found two of the boats, but not Ron and Betty. One, the Harpoon , was anchored at Ho ward Bond’s Yacht Harbor. Another, Blue Water II , was at the American Ship Building Company. Par sons then r ented a r oom and w aited. Two days later, someone from Bond’s called Parsons to say that the Harpoon had just sailed. He was too late to catch them, so he r eturned to his room and con- secrated a circle.

I will be lucky to salvage thr ee to five thousand dollars. In the interim I have been flat broke. Bartzabel had a little help from the U.S. Coast Guard, who rescued and detained the pair. Betty later described her and Hubbard’s situa- tion during the storm as “desperate,” relating that the two were very scared that they would not make it back to shore. On July 1, 1946, Parsons sued Allied Enterprises in Dade County, Florida Cir cuit Court, case number 1 01634. In an instance of remarkably swift justice, the court appr oved a settlement on July 10, and on July 11 the three partners signed an agreement dissolv- ing the compan y. Parsons recovered two boats: Blue Water II (a schooner) and Diane (a yacht). Hubbard was allowed to retain pos- session of the Harpoon , a two-masted schooner, and use it as col- lateral against a promissory note in the amount of $2900. Hubbar d was also or dered to pa y Parsons’ legal fees . Parsons returned to Pasadena and ne ver heard from either party again. Hubbar d and Betty eventually married and had a daughter. Hubbard’s career with Scientology is well-documented, in various versions, elsewhere. The incident affected not just Parsons, as his bad luck now forced him to stop sending money to his ex-wife, Helen, and Wilfred Smith, who had married. The fact that he w as sending money to them in the first place reveals how much he thought of Smith, as well as his generosity. P arsons’ r egular contributions to Cr owley, ho wever, would continue until the latter’s death the next year. At the time of the financial disaster, Smith wrote to Crowley: It all seems to be folding up together. [Jack] can’t send any more money. Grimaud’s [Helen] is r unning out. These, and the fier ce stab of Regina’s [Kahl] death occurred all within a day or two.

You must be so inur ed to disciples’ failur es that just one more won’t surprise you. On August 20, Parsons sent a formal letter of resignation from the OTO to Cr owley. Instead of the usual “Thrice Illuminated, Thrice Illustrious, and V ery Dear Br other” salutation, he began it “Dear Aleister.” He gave no explanation but merely said the resignation was his will, although it certainly may have been a reflection of his disil- lusionment in the face of such misfortunes. He expressed his contin- ued sympathy to the Cr owley’s “Rights of Man” (Liber OZ ) , quoted below, but finished b y saying, “I do not belie ve that the OTO , as an autocratic organization, constitutes a true and proper medium for the expression and attainment of these principles [the Rights of Man].” Many resigning members have made similar remarks. Regarding P arsons’ sour ce of e xtra income , Louis Culling remarked that Parsons was “bootlegging nitroglycerine,” presumably meaning he was selling it illegally . But to whom? Camer on appar- ently was bold enough to help him in this enterprise , whatever it was. She and P arsons w ere married in San Juan Capistr ano on October 19, 1946 by a Justice of the P eace named Marco F. Forster, with Ed Forman and his wife Jeanne witnessing the event. Recorded in the Orange County Recorder’s Office, the marriage took place just before P arsons’ JPL partner F rank Malina w as invited b y Julian Huxley to go to F rance and work for UNESCO . Rypinski opined that Malina left the country to distance himself fr om the scandal revolv- ing around Parsons, as there apparently was an investigation into the house and possibly some ne wspaper exposure. But Malina himself says he was just looking for something differ ent to do, which rings closer to the truth. In late 1946, Parsons and Cameron left 1003 S. Orange Grove Ave., and the lodge, which met at several different places after this. The big house was later torn down to make way for apartments. Parsons also left his job with the V ulcan Powder Company, having been offered employment with the North American A viation Corpor ation in 158 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"nearby Inglewood, California, wher e he w orked until 1948, when Hughes Aircraft in Culver City hired him. In addition, Parsons engaged in consulting work. As such, he was often called on by the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office, the Los Angeles P olice Department, the Los Angeles Superior Court, Northrup Air craft Compan y, Gener al Chemical Compan y, the National Defense R esearch Council, and the Office of Scientific Research and De velopment. Parsons was also a member of se veral technical societies , including the American Chemical Society , the Institute of A eronautical Sciences , the American Institute for the Adv ancement of Science , the Society of Sigma Xi, and the Arm y Ordnance Association. His obituary said he had refused several hon- orary degrees, but there is no further evidence to support this claim. A membership in Sigma Xi seems unlikely due to his lack of a degree but is reported by two different sources, such that it is possible his reputation was enough to gain him entrance. Disillusioned by the incident with Hubbar d and Betty , Parsons drifted a way fr om magick and focused his will on his technical career, although the two aspects of his life could never be completely separated. Unfortunately, his misfortune continued, and he had little success, nothing to equal the glory of his W orld War II efforts . On May 17, 1948, his tw o worlds collided, as he lost his go vernment security clearance “because of his membership in a religious cult . . . believed to adv ocate sexual perversion . . . or ganized at subject’ s home . . . which had been r eported subversive.” Elsewhere the FBI describes it as a “mythic love cult,” despite Parsons’ insistence it was “dedicated to the fr eedom and liberty of the individual.” The same old plagues were still haunting him. In a letter to Karl Germer dated June 19, 1949, Parsons said he lost the clearance for membership in the OTO and for publicly circulating Liber OZ , a statement of “the rights of man.” Kno wn also as Liber LXXVII , certain elements of the statement are understandably disturb- ing to different factions of society and, although P arsons may have viewed himself a teacher destined to affect the po wers that be, the latter, according him, e vidently perceived him and his ideas as a security risk. Liber OZ reads in full as follows: The law of the strong: this is our law and the joy of the world. —AL II:2 Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law . —AL I:40 159 Parso ns’ Final Years: 1946–1952"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Thou hast no right but to do thy will.

He told them that thelema , the “will” aspect of Crowley’s work, was def- initely anti-communist and anti-fascist, which it is, and his clearance was finally reinstated on March 7, 1949. Nonetheless , Cameron left him soon after. Humorously, Parsons’ FBI file is full of r eferences to the “Chur ch of Thelma .” Ther e is also an unclear r eference to P arsons doing something on September 2 1, 1948 to bring the attention of go vern- ment officials upon him once mor e, but apparently nothing came of it. Parsons then spent tw o years on the staff of the Univ ersity of Southern California’s Pharmacology Department starting in 1948. Despite his occupational troubles based in part on his occult activ- ities —or possibly because of them—Parsons was unable to avoid the exotic lure. On Halloween of 1948, Babalon called on Parsons in some unspecified manner and ur ged him to r esume his magick. Lik e so many who suffer the ills of the ph ysical world, Parsons would turn once more to religion in his time of need, beginning a 17-day “work- ing of the wand” (17 is a masculine number because of its associa- tion with Mars), the climax of which was Babalon’s manifestation in a dream. He had Smith christen him “Belarion Armiluss Al Dajjal, AntiChrist” as he took the Oath of the Abyss. Oddly enough, consid- ering the friction between them, Parsons remained close to Smith, the man who had married Parsons’ wife and who w as also his superior in the A ∴ A ∴ . Their relationship was probably more formal than per- sonal by this time. At the conclusion of his 17-da y w orking, Babalon instructed Par sons on an “ astral w orking,” i.e ., an out-of-body e xperience. Par sons had, by his own accounts, a “well-developed body of light,” so apparently this travel was an easy task for him. Indeed, he claimed success with a vision wherein he “went into the sunset with Her sign and into the night past accur sed and desolate places and c yclopean ruins, and so came at last to the City of Chor azin. And there a great tower of Black Basalt was raised, that was part of a castle whose fur- ther battlements ruled over the gulf of stars.” Chorazin was a small town on the Sea of Galilee that, according to the gospel story , Jesus cur sed when the citizens w ould not r epent (Mt. 11:21; Lk. 1 0:13). Later legends claimed that the Antichrist would be born in Chor azin, whose modern name is K erazeh. The black basalt ruins of the city’s old synagogue to which Parsons refers are still standing. 161 Parso ns’ Final Years: 1946–1952"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Regarding the title with which Parsons had himself christened by Smith, Belarion is an alternate spelling (presumably from the Greek) of “Belial,” a demon named in the Bible, the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Jewish apocrypha (hidden texts of dubious authenticity) whose name means “Without God,” as “Bel” or “Ba’al” means “God” or “Lor d.” Belarion is often identified b y Christian writer s with the Beast in Revelation, with whom Aleister Cr owley in turn identified himself. Rather than emulating his mentor , ho wever, P arsons ma y ha ve acquired the moniker from a fantasy novel which featured a charac- ter by that name. The term Armiluss is the Jewish equivalent of the Antichrist. As the end appr oaches, Je wish eschatology states , the Messiah ben Ephraim (“born of Ephr aim” or Isr ael, the northern kingdom) will come first, following by Armiluss who will lead the armies of Gog and Magog against the armies of the Messiah at the battle of Armageddon, murdering him. Ben Ephr aim’s corpse will be left for the scavengers, but the Messiah ben Da vid (whom the Christians believe was Jesus) will appear and resurrect him. The next word in Parsons’ title, Al-Dajjal , is the Islamic version of the Antichrist, whose name is Arabic for “the deceiver.” He does not appear in the Koran but rather in the hadith , which are the sayings of Mohammed as recorded by his disciples. Al-Dajjal is blind in one eye but is able to perform mir acles, the gr eatest of which will be bringing order to a w orld in chaos . On Judgment Da y he will be defeated by the Mahdi, whom most Muslims belie ve is the return of Mohammed. The beastly-named P arsons then took the Oath of the Ab yss. “Crossing the Ab yss” inv olves the total denial of the w orld and detachment from the ego.

As a part of this venture, Parsons prepared two important papers: Analysis By A Master of the T emple , which is autobiogr aphical in nature, and The Book of AntiChrist . Analysis seems to have been pre- pared prior to P arsons’ attempt to cr oss the Ab yss, as “F rater Belarion” speaks to Parsons in the third person, saying “I await you in the City of the Pyramids.” Subsequently writing as Belarion, Parsons refers to the OTO as “an excellent training school for adepts, but hardly an appropriate Order for the manifestation of Thelema,” a statement tantamount to her esy. Obviously, he was frustrated by attempts to discipline him, and his notion of Thelema w as almost fundamentalist, based on little mor e than Liber OZ . Trying to make lemonade out of lemons, he writes in the third person, “The e xperience with the OTO and Aerojet were needed to dispel y our romanticism, self deception, and r eliance on others. Betty was one link in the pr ocess designed to tear y ou away from the no w unneeded Oedipus comple x, the o vervaluation of women and romantic love.” Evidently on account of such failures, Parsons listed seven things to begin working on immediately: 163 Parso ns’ Final Years: 1946–1952"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Works of the Wand—of the Will alone avail in this state.

Originally in Crowley’s play The Ship , which he wrote shortly after learning the K ey of the OTO , “The Hymn to the Unnamed One” is recited during the Gnostic Mass , wher e it is r eferred to as the “Anthem.” Written to portr ay the essence of that K ey in dr amatic form, the hymn invokes the “centre and secret of the Sun/And that most holy mystery/Of which vehicle am I.” 30 After taking the oath, which he and Smith both signed, P arsons endured an unspecified 40-da y or deal—longer than the entir e Babalon Working—that probably involved a retreat of some sort and fasting. He emer ged to claim the gr ade of a Master of the T emple. Par sons was 33 when he took the Oath of the Abyss; Crowley was 34 when he attempted the same. Little survives of Parsons’ account; all we have is his statement in The Book of AntiChrist . Parsons should have kept detailed records of his attempt at crossing the Abyss, but if such records existed they must ha ve been lost or destr oyed. It is doubtful he succeeded in his attempt. In order to try to r econstruct what P arsons might ha ve done to cross the Abyss, we need to review what Crowley himself did in this regard.

The Ship was published by Crowley in The Equinox."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"and Parsons did in fact idolize Crowley, such that he probably stuck to the original, at least to some degr ee. It is important to note that crossing the Abyss is a part of the A ∴ A ∴ ’s doctrine, and has nothing to do with the OTO . In fact, b y this time Parsons had resigned from the latter. Crowley carried out his Ab yss-crossing process during 1908 and 1909. A key part of this working was a 30-day walk across the Algerian desert, upon which he took along Frater Omnia Vincam , known in the “world of men” as Victor Neubur g, the acolyte who w as in love with him and received Crowley’s abuse. Although this endeavor was a full three years before Crowley would learn the sexual secret of the OTO , on one occasion he used Neuburg in an act of sex magic, taking the sub- missive role to Neuburg’s dominance. Neuburg took notes as Crowley described what he saw. The crossing of the Ab yss is part of the old Enochian s ystem, which posits a universe of 30 concentric Aires (or Aethyrs) with the earth at the center, much as the ancients did with the se ven plane- tary spheres, although there are other arrangements. The 30th Aire is the lowest; hence, it is the closest to the earth. The Fir st Aire is thus the highest, but ther e are said to be unkno wn, unnumbered Aires above it. Each Aire, as seen in the discussion of the Babalon W orking, has its angels, kings, Seniors, cherubs, etc. associated with it. W orking with each Air e r equires inv oking these entities , just as P arsons invoked EXARP in January 1946. The full ritual is full of consecrations, hexagrams and pentagrams, and takes at least an hour to perform for each Aire. The ritual must be recited from memory, and “vibrated” in the original Enochian language. The Aires are transversed in r everse order, as the highest num- bered Aire is closest to the earth. Crowley worked with the 30th Aire first, then the 29th, and so on. On the 21st day, the day of his work- ing with the 1 0th Aire, Crowley had his Ab yss-crossing experience. The 10th Aire is guarded by the demon Choronzon, who dwells in the Abyss. For Crowley, Aires 30 through 11 involved astral vision (“skrying in the Aethyrs”). The working of the 10th Aire involved a full-blown possession experience in which Crowley’s psyche was overtaken by Choronzon for a time . Neuburg was extremely frightened b y this intense change in his usually amicable master , and w as glad that Crowley was bound inside a consecr ated circle. Unlike the inv oca- tions of the previous nights, there was no physical contact between 165 Parso ns’ Final Years: 1946–1952"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"the two men. The possession lasted until the energy produced by the blood of three sacrificed pigeons ran out, and then it ended. Crowley emerged with his sanity intact, having survived a face-to- face encounter with the blind forces of the Abyss. He had tasted mad- ness and survived. He had cr ossed the Abyss by giving up his ego. He was now a Magister Templi (Master of the Temple) in the A ∴ A ∴ . Crowley scryed the remaining Aires during the course of the next nine days, then finished the rite (and his desert w alk). A detailed account of these endeavors and his ordeal can be found in Crowley’s The Vision and the Voice , as well as in his Confessions . As noted, it is unclear to what extent Parsons emulated his master in his Abyss working, for which he may very well have retired to the Mojave desert, as Crowley had to that of Algeria. This period w as a low point in Parsons’ life: his former glory lost, he w as employed at a gas station. The w orking lasted 40 da ys, whatever form it took— longer than the entir e Babalon Working, and longer than Cr owley’s own Algerian w orking with Neubur g. Unfortunately, most of the records documenting the endea vor ar e no w gone , if the y e ven existed. Whatever form it did tak e, this oper ation w as P arsons’ Black Pilgrimage, foretold by Babalon three years earlier in Liber 49 , vs. 33, 58, and 61. After the end of the 40 days, Parsons wrote a two-page doc- ument called The Book of AntiChrist . In it he predicted the manifesta- tion of Babalon upon the earth within seven years, which he would not have done had he consider ed Cameron to be Babalon. He also pr e- dicted that an entire nation would embrace Thelema . Babalon told him these things w ould come to pass only if he surviv ed the ne xt seven years. He did not, and it is odd that Babalon, or P arsons’ own psyche, or whatever it was, would even suggest that the young man might not, as if it or he knew his sad fate. In “The Black Pilgrimage,” which was the first part of The Book of AntiChrist , P arsons compar ed himself to se veral infamous but obscure figures from the past. He referred to them as past lives of his, though probably just as a literary device. The first, Simon Magus, was the legendary fir st-century Samaritan magician who made a living selling miracles to the populace. According to the Bible, after his bap- tism by Philip (A cts 8:9 ff), Simon continued to peddle his w ares under a Christian guise , giving rise to our w ord “Simony.” Simon preached a gnostic message in which his consort Helen, found in a brothel, w as the fallen Sophia (i.e ., wisdom) whom he had redeemed. 166 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"The second past life was Gilles de Retz (usually spelled “Rais” or “Raiz”), a child tortur er and killer also kno wn as Bluebear d the pirate. Parsons mentioned an incident appar ently not documented elsewhere, in which de Rais (ca. 1404–1430) allegedly tried to make Joan of Arc (ca. 1412–1431) the “Queen of the Witchcraft.” The thir d figur e w as “F rancis Hepburne , Earl Bothw ell,” but Par sons must have been referring to Francis Stewart , the fifth Earl of Bothwell. The fourth Earl had been named Hepburn. The fifth Earl was the “Arch-Dianist” of Scotland, meaning the spiritual leader of the Diana-worshipping witches, who saw in Stewart the incarnation of the “horned god.” He also had a claim to the throne, toward which he directed his supernatur al efforts. In fact, Ste wart was the fir st cousin of King James VI of Scotland, the same murderous King James I of England whose translation of the Bible remains a standard, and who had John Dee arr ested. As noted, the King fear ed witchcraft greatly, and he saw in his cousin the v ery devil whom he knew the witches worshiped. When Ste wart busted into the King’ s house on July 24, 1593, the King asked whether Stewart came for his life or for his soul. Had James died heirless , Stewart could ha ve claimed the throne. Some of Stewart’s anti-Christian writings are even used in our age. Parsons mentioned him specifically in regard to a Gille Duncan, about whom there seems to be no information. The fourth life w as Count Cagliostr o, the famous 18th-century alchemist who studied under St. Germain, the supposedly immortal miracle worker, and Seraphina ( AKA Lorenza Feliciana), Cagliostro’s wife. During the witchhunts , Ser aphina testified against her hus- band—admittedly under the threat of torture—and he was sentenced to death. His sentence was commuted to life in prison, and Seraphina was allowed to retire to a monastery of nuns. 31 The common thread in all of these past liv es is the poor r elation- ship with w omen: Parsons was still beating himself up for ha ving trusted Betty. In addition to pummeling himself, Parsons also trounced Christianity and “the lying priests, conniving judges, [and] blackmail- ing police,” ending the second part of The Book of AntiChrist , called “The Manifesto of the AntiChrist,” with the following: I, BELARION, ANTICHRIST , in the year 1949 of the r ule of the Black Brotherhood called Christianity, do make my Manifesto to all men.

It is unkno wn why Parsons referred to Babalon by this name, which was later one of Cameron’s magical names as well. She may have chosen it because of this doc- ument. On May 8, 1949, some months after the Abyss working—and pos- sibly because of it, in P arsons’ mind—he was hired by the Hughes Aircraft Company. At that time, he wrote Crowley, “It has now been almost a year since I last wrote—at that time I was near mental and financial collapse. Since that time I have laboriously gained some sort of mental equilibrium and gradually regained something of a position in my old field in a large aircraft company. My one aim is to rebuild myself.” Also in 1949, Cameron returned from Mexico and made Parsons a green box with the Hebrew letter shin painted in red on the lid. He kept his Babalon Working documents in it. In January of 1951, Parsons made a striking disco very and wrote Germer: I have the text of Dee’s skrying in the Seventh Aire, which as he said “. . . so terrified him that, beseeching God to have mercy upon me, I finally answer ed that I will fr om this day for ward meddle no more herein.” The Voice, speaking from Kelley, resulted in a sinis- ter dissociation of Kelley’s personality .

This realization of history r epeating itself may have hit Parsons too late to do an ything about it, but he w as not defeated. P arsons worked in the Propellants Section at Hughes, and by March 1950 he was listing his title as “Gr oup Leader in Char ge of Pr opellants, Propulsion and Launching Group of the Research and Development Laboratories.” Circumstances had gone well from the date of his hir- ing May 8, 1949 until June 195 0, at which time the Isr aelis, with whom he had been negotiating since October 1948 via the American 169 Parso ns’ Final Years: 1946–1952 32.

In order to accomplish this goal, he planned to r elocate to the ne wly formed Israel. According to Parsons’ FBI file he negotiated with no less than the head of the American T echnion Society , a man named Rosenfeldt. Par sons worked on the proposal in July and August. In September, Hughes had him w orking on a pr oposal for a “R ocket Propellant Loading Plant.” The pricing data in this pr oposal was what Parsons needed to finish his pr oposal to the Isr aelis. He took 17 of his o wn documents from Hughes, many of which w ere still designated as “Confidential” or “Restricted,” and passed them on via Cameron to a friend for typing. His FBI file says this (female) friend w as a part of the typing pool at Hughes . This incident occurr ed, in Parsons’ own words, “ about the 16th of September,” at the recommendation of von Kármán, who w as also intervie wed by the FBI with regard to the Chinese Tsien’s espionage case. Von Kármán’s participation was later found to be incidental in both cases. These 17 documents were said to be rough drafts of the proposal he was writing for Hughes , but the y were mostly old JATO docu- ments Parsons was using to pad his résumé. His “friend,” whom he said he had kno wn for fiv e y ears, turned him in, and on September 25 the FBI confiscated the documents. On September 26 at noon, they interviewed Parsons.

Subsequent statements were taken, and many acquaintances of Parsons and Cameron were interviewed. One referred to the cou- ple as “characters and screwballs.” Another called Parsons a “crack- pot.” References to earlier inv estigations of his “ cult” at 1 003 S. Orange Grove occupy much of the FBI file. One witness claimed to have gone to the house for a “weekend party” that turned into a rite wherein everybody removed their street clothes, put on cer emonial robes, and were subsequently drugged.

It also describes him as a “former emplo yee” of Hughes, meaning that he had been fired by then. Appar ently he w as fired immediately in September , when the breach of security was discovered.

Although it is unverified, it has also been said that Parsons inadvertently employed jargon used by the Manhattan Project, the U.S. nuclear weapons program estab- lished in 1942 by Enrico Fermi. On January 17, 1952, after one year and four months of investiga- tion, the Board informed Parsons this they were pulling his clearance, which was never reinstated. The lack of reinstatement is curious, as officials at Wright-Patterson Field informed the investigators that the entire project had been declassified right after the w ar, even though some of the individual paper s were still classified. Indeed, the y rec- ommended declassification of the paper s in Parsons’ possession, as most of them w ere rather old. R egardless, his superior s just didn’t trust him an ymore.

The lower level of the coach house had been a stable , and the upper level had been servants’ quarters, which had been turned into apartments that P arsons, his mother , and Camer on occupied until June 1. At the time of the blast, P arsons’ mother, Ruth, had taken a summer position as caretaker for one Mrs. Carpenter, who was out of town with her husband, residing at 21 W. Glenarm St. with her friend Helen Rowan who was confined to a wheelchair. The explosion blew the stable door s from their hinges , knocked over two walls, and tore a hole in the ceiling as well as a hole in the floor. Smaller doors and windows were blown from their frames, and two greenhouses 25 feet away were shattered. A grand piano upstairs shifted enough for one of its legs to br eak, and a chandelier fell. Windows were broken on the home next door. Artist Salvatore Ganci, one of the upstairs residents, was on the phone when the e xplosion occurred. “I was lifted off the couch b y a violent blast,” he told the Pasadena Star-News reporter. The apartment was shared by 21-year- old Jo Ann Price , an actr ess and model, as w ell as actor Martin Foshaug, 31, and his mother Alta. No one upstairs was hurt. Ganci and Mr s. Foshaug rushed do wnstairs and pulled P arsons from the wreckage, propping him up against a wall until paramedics could get there. Parsons was coherent enough to giv e them instruc- tions as he was loaded into the ambulance and tak en to Huntington Memorial Hospital at 100 Congress St. in Pasadena. The remarkable man died there at 5:45 p.m., some 37 minutes after the explosion. In March 1946, P arson had cryptically written, “ And in that da y [the manifestation of Babalon] my work will be accomplished, and I shall be blown away upon the breath of the father.” As Parsons lay dying, according to John Bluth, his last words are said to have been, “I wasn’t done.” According to Jane Wolfe, Cameron related them as, “Who will take care of me now?” But it was not he who needed looking after , as he had passed on into the other side that he had so fervently tried to bring into this world. From his birth, both Parsons and his mother shared a strong bond. After the sickening tragedy, Ruth Parsons and Helen Rowan went to a friend’s home at 424 Arr oyo Terrace, where her son and Camer on had been staying since June 1, which was described in a newspaper as a “two-story mansion.” Another friend, Mrs. Nedia Kibort, age 59, of 320 Waverly Drive, was in the house with them, wher e presum- 178 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"ably they sought a little comfort after the dr eadful news. Ruth was drinking heavily, and took tw o Nembutals fr om a pr escription she received after the explosion. When she learned of her son’s death she shouted, “I can’t stand to liv e without him. I adored him.” She also said that she had a gun upstairs and then gulped the remainder of the sleeping pills—23 or 43, depending on the account—while Mr s. Row an looked on helplessly. Another friend, a nur se named Nellie Smith, arrived soon after and found R uth slumped o ver in a living room chair. She phoned Dr. J.R. Huntsman of 65 N. Madison A ve., who pronounced Mrs. Parsons dead at 9:06 p.m. Her death w as investigated by Lt. John C. Elliott, who had been at the scene of her son’s death, and by Sgt. Woody Pollard. Cameron was buying supplies for the Me xico trip at the corner grocery when the e xplosion occurr ed. The Pasadena Independent reported Cameron as being “stoic in the face of her double loss.” She told reporters and police that she and her husband w ere headed to Mexico for a vacation. Their luggage was sitting in the hallway at 424 Arroyo Terrace when Ruth committed suicide. Others told a different story. Cameron’s brother Robert, age 28, of 125 N. Rampart Blvd., stated that Parsons was headed to Mexico on business, “the nature of which was v ery secr etive.” Pr esumably R obert w ould kno w, as he and Cameron’s other brother, sister and father all worked at JPL . Someone else told the Independent that Parsons was going to set up his o wn business in Mexico, but Cameron insisted it was merely an extended trip. The amount of baggage, however, indicated a long-term stay. In fact, the couple w ere headed next to Israel, where they intended to raise a family. Motorcycle officer Ernie Ho vard was the fir st policeman on the scene of the explosion and was later joined by Donald M. Harding, a Pasadena police for ce criminologist. Har ding found numer ous con- tainers of explosives, many of which had already been placed outside by Par sons, in preparation for the trip, which w as obviously not for sightseeing. The legality of the e xplosives was questioned, and the 58th Arm y Or dnance Disposal Unit w as called in fr om F ort MacArthur to help determine the cause of the e xplosion, as well as to inspect the immediate area and the house at 424 Arroyo Terrace for further e xplosives. As photogr aphers took flash photos , Har ding shielded certain of the remaining bottles, afraid that the light would set them off as well. The Disposal Unit removed the rest of the explo- sives from the pr emises, and the inv estigators and other s began to 179 Death and Beyond"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"speculate as to what caused the blast—nitroglycerin? Rocket fuels? Or the more exotic-sounding trinitrobenzene or PETN ? 33 In addition to the e xplosion, Harding found numer ous scientific notes in the debris, most of which contained chemical formulas. One interesting document contained Parsons’ notes concerning industrial explosions: “Texas City Disaster Report: 433 dead, 128 missing. [The explosive] cannot be detonated with rifle bullets , blasting caps or dynamite.” Parsons also had notes about a Los Angeles electroplating company explosion in 1947 that killed 15, and another e xplosion at Aer ojet that killed eight. He had been a member of the coroner’s jury on the 1947 incident. A more curious fragment was obviously not a part of his pr ofes- sional work. The note r ead, “Let me kno w thy misery totally. And spare not and be not spared. Sacrament and Crucifixion. Oh my pas- sion and shame . . . Mother s . . . Sisters . . .” Unfortunately, he got his morbid wish, as did his devoted mother. Harding eventually determined that the blast occurred just behind Par sons, and to his right, just above floor level. Had the building not been of heavy timber construction, it probably would have been lev- eled. As it w as, the entire half of the lo wer level containing his lab was gutted. Firemen reported that they noticed a “funny odor” when they arrived on the scene. Interestingly, considering she had purport- edly found mercury there, Cameron said that the explosion occurred beneath the floorboards, lifting them up . Martin Foshaug said that Parsons “had been experimenting in an effort to pr oduce a ‘Super’ fog effect for motion pictur es,” but this work certainly had nothing to do with the blast that killed him, since Par sons had left his special effects job with the Bermite P owder Company on the previous Friday, June 13. On June 19, the newspapers reported that the cause of the e xplo- sion had been determined to be “fulminate of mer cury,” a very sen- sitive and powerful detonator that Army Ordnance had stopped using because of the number of deaths it had caused. However, the size of the explosion seems e xcessive for fulminate of mer cury. Harding, who had just joined the P asadena police force, was assigned to his first investigation with the P arsons blast. He could ha ve both been inexperienced and had based his conclusions on hearsay, rather than science, about mercury. Harding was told by a neighbor that Parsons was manufacturing the mer cury explosive (illegally) in the gar age 180 sex and r ockets 33. PETN is still used for demolition and special ef fects today."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"laboratory. It was to be his last batch, Parsons had told the neighbor. Obviously, he w as right. Har ding searched for other stor age places Par sons might ha ve maintained, and stated that enough e xplosives remained in the lab to “blow up half the block.” Harding’s determination of the bomb device’s origin was based on his discovery in the rubble of ingr edients needed to make fulminate of mercury. Shrapnel from a coffee can w as found in the w ooden floor and in the w alls, radiating out fr om the hole at gr ound zero, which led Harding to surmise that Parsons must have reached for the can when it dr opped but w asn’t quick enough. This de velopment, Harding inferred, was why the e xplosion occurred low to the floor and why Parsons’ right arm was missing, since it w as closest to the blast. Harding believed Parsons was mixing the chemical in the can when it dropped. Fulminate of mercury, he reasoned, “is made w et and gets more sensitive as it dries. A little friction, per cussion, heat or agitation is enough to set it off.” Based on Har ding’s findings , Detectiv e Lieutenant Cecil H. Burlingame was told by the coroner’s office that no inquest would be held. After an autops y performed the ne xt day by Deputy Cor oner I.G. Mcfarland, the death w as ruled accidental and attributed to “multiple injuries of entir e body.” Burlingame told r eporters that police had received reports in 1942 that Parsons was illegally storing explosives at 1003 S. Orange Grove Ave. Nevertheless, a search con- ducted in conjunction with the FBI had turned up nothing. The Pasadena Independent talked to J.H. Arnold of the Bermite Pow der Compan y, who told them that P arsons had sta yed long enough with his company to finish a special effects pr oject. Parsons had, in fact, been w orking on a “r ocket propellant detonation and pyrotechnic short-interval delay” project, which w as a confidential program at the compan y. Contrary to Camer on’s testimony, his co- workers related that he had told them he w as heading to Mexico to continue his research with explosives and miniature special effects. Arnold had asked him to stay long enough to see the tests of the con- fidential project, but P arsons was eager to get to Me xico. “He had been working hard,” Arnold told the inv estigators, also stating that Par sons was extremely safety-conscious. Said Arnold, “He w orked carefully, had a thorough knowledge of his job and was scrupulously neat.” But Harding called him “ criminally negligent” in the w ay he handled the explosives at his home lab. Arnold was surprised to hear that Parsons had so many explosives at home, which police learned had been there at least six months. Arnold added that Parsons at one 181 Death and Beyond"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"time had his o wn powder magazine near Rialto, which w as a legal storage place. His home , however, was in obvious violation of the Pasadena fire marshal’s code. In addition, Arnold noted, six or eight months earlier P arsons talked about going into the dynamite busi- ness. Other comments came from T.E. Beehan, Secretary-Treasurer of Aer ojet, who described P arsons as a “loner” and said, “He lik ed to wander, but he was one of the top men in the field.” In their r eportage about his life and death, the Pasadena Independent dug up some of the older stories about P arsons when he was at 1003 S. Orange Grove and recalled that in 1942 a letter had been sent from San Antonio, T exas by “A Real Soldier,” who wr ote that a “black magic” cult was operating in the house. The same Detective Lt. Burlingame had inv estigated the letter incident and w as told b y Par sons that the “cult” was merely a “non-sectarian and non-political fraternity” which “held open forums on Sunda y afternoons, and dis- cussed philosophy, religion, personal freedom, and fortune telling.” However, in 1944 police investigated a small fire at the house, dur- ing which inv estigation Detective O.A. Nelson found “ considerable paraphernalia . . . which indicated that spiritual seances ma y have been held in the house.” Said Nelson, “It appears to be the home of some type of secret society.” Nevertheless, the matter was dropped. Smelling a good story , the sensationalistic Independent announced in its obituary that on July 19 “secret rites” were held for John Parsons at Turner & Stevens Mortuary, Marengo Ave. and Holly St. However, the funeral home referred to the ceremony as a “private prayer service .” The obituary used his birth name , Marv el, and reported that Cameron was the only survivor. It also stated that cre- mation took place earlier that da y at the Liv e Oak Cr ematory and that his body was embalmed by W.T. Stahlman. The Social Security number giv en on his death certificate , pr esumably pr ovided b y Cameron, is incorr ect and belongs to a Vir ginia Wilson, also of California, who had been born the same y ear as Parsons and who lived until 1980. On July 20, a private service was held for R uth Parsons, also by Turner & Stevens, and her body was cremated as well. She was sur- vived by a Mr s. Emma Aldrich of Santa Monica, California, appar- ently no relation to lodge member Meeka Aldrich. On June 22, both the Los Angeles Times and the Pasadena Independent addressed a new development: George W.

Police had found 500 grams of cordite (an ammunition com- ponent) and six filter papers containing fulminate of mercury residue in Parsons’ trash can, which was either at the back of the lab or just outside it, depending on the account. “For Parsons to have disposed of such materials in that manner ,” said Santm yer, “would be the same as for a highly trained surgeon to operate with dirty hands. It’s completely out of char acter for him.” Criminologist Har ding, when asked, admitted that P arsons’ supposed sloppiness seemed “incon- gruous.” Harding also said that enough cordite and fulminate of mer- cury were found in the trash to blow up the garbage truck and drivers who would have picked up the can. In his statement to the papers, Santmyer argued that someone else must have put it ther e, that P arsons would not ha ve disposed of highly dangerous explosives at the last minute , nor would he have prepared them for tr ansportation on a long driv e into Me xico, as everything he needed to produce fulminate of mercury could be eas- ily pur chased once he arriv ed ther e. Santm yer also stated that Par sons was “on the trail” of a completely ne w explosive that “was to be far superior to an y existing commercial blasting material” and much safer to handle. According to Burlingame, however, Santmyer’s questions w eren’t “sufficient to w arrant us r eopening the case .” Nevertheless, Santmyer was not the only person who smelled some- thing fishy in the untimely death of John Parsons. Something else was allegedly found after the death of P arsons that didn’t make the 1952 Los Angeles Times . Amateur r ocket advocate Harold Chambers, who worked at a technical bookstore in downtown Los Angeles for 40 y ears, was told on separ ate occasions b y both Harding and Santmyer that an “odd, bizarre, fairly big box, decorated with snakes and dr agons” was found in a tr ailer at P arsons’ resi- dence. The odd bo x was found to contain home mo vies of Parsons and mother ha ving se x, not only with each other , but also with Ruth’s “big dog.” According to reports from Pasadena police, passed down to their friend Har old Chambers, we now have circumstantial evidence that John P arsons indeed fulfilled his goal to “ exteriorize [his] Oedipus complex.” Ruth Parsons’ “big dog” also made it difficult for police to attend to her suicide scene . After being attack ed by Ruth’s agitated beast, Pasadena police officers shot the dog in the head. Chambers also r eports that Don Har ding, ha ving disco vered a syringe among the blast debris , partially filled with a morphine-lik e 183 Death and Beyond"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"substance, believes that P arsons’ drug use contributed to his mis- handling of explosives. The high-reaching pioneer Parsons was gone but not for gotten. In 1969, Darker Than Y ou Think author Jack Williamson wr ote, “In Pasadena not long ago, w alking acr oss the gr ounds of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, I was jolted to see Parsons’ name on a memor- ial tablet set up to honor the first martyrs to space. He had written me once about testing multicellular solid-fuel rockets designed after those in my story ‘The Crucible of Power.’ When I first heard about his death I wondered if m y own rockets had killed him, but [L.] Spr ague de Camp tells me that he dropped a bottle of picric acid.” It wasn’t picric acid, but he had the right idea. Rather than any “martyrs to space,” the JPL plaque actually hon- ors the first successful series of JATO tests, which began on Halloween 1936. The monument w as unveiled on Hallo ween 1968, the 32nd anniversary of the original date. “The Crucible of Power,” contained in the anthology The Best of Jack Williamson , describes the multi-cel- lular, solid-fuel rockets as follows: “[I]t was a four-step rocket, each step containing thousands of cellules, each of which was a complete rocket motor with its own load of alumilloid fuel, to be fired once and then detached.” No doubt P arsons would have also been inter ested in the solar r eligion of the story’ s Martians, whose high priest w as called the “Lance of the Sun.” While the police were content to let the tragedy stand as an acci- dent ostensibly caused b y his pr ofessional endeavors, others felt it had to do with the occult. In The Occult Explosion (published 1972), Nat F reedland intervie wed filmmak er R enate Druks , who said, “Cameroun [sic] stayed with me at m y Malibu Beach house for six months, pulling herself together after Jack died. I ha ve every reason to believe that Jack Parsons was working on some very strange exper- iments, trying to create what the old alchemists called a homunculus, a tiny artificial man with magic po wers. I think that’ s what he w as working on when the accident happened.” Druks e vidently was the source of Michael Hoffman’s statement in Apocalypse Culture that “In 1952 Parsons was blown up in what is officially described as an acci- dent but which others have said was a homunculus experiment that went bananas.” Before moving in with Druks, Cameron stayed briefly with Wilfred and Helen Parsons Smith. She also spent time alone in the desert. Par sons’ friends did not belie ve he killed himself, at least inten- tionally. Indeed, he had too man y plans, as r eflected by his dying 184 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"words: “I w asn’t done.” It is some what ironic that these w ere the dying words of the man who claimed to be the Antichrist, while , according to the gospel tale, the dying words of Christ were the oppo- site: “It is finished.” Druks, who later w orked with a vant garde filmmaker Kenneth Anger and who also studied magic under Jane W olfe, related that Par sons was going to Mexico “to experiment with his new formula for an explosive ‘more powerful than anything yet invented.’” According to JPL employee Charles Bartley, Parsons told him he was going there to start a fi reworks company, yet von Kármán stated that Parsons told him it was an explosives factory—which is admittedly not much dif- ferent—that the Mexican government had hired him to set up. V on Kármán also said that Parsons told him the government was furnish- ing a 17th-century castle for him to stay in while he was there. Since there are few if an y castles in old Me xico, perhaps Parsons or v on Kármán confused palacio for castillo . Camer on r elated a similar account but stated it w as in Baja California, r ather than Me xico proper. These e xperiments were to be a step to ward their e ventual plans for working with the Israelis. Decades later Camer on spoke of the e xplosion as coming fr om under the floorboar ds, implying mur der rather than an accident or suicide. In the OTO newsletter The Magical Link , she stated that a good suspect was the explosives expert against whom P arsons had testified and who had been par oled immediately prior to the fatal explosion, a r eference to Captain K ynette of the Los Angeles “sp y squad,” found guilty of murdering another police officer in 1938. The weapon Kynette used was a car bomb , and Parsons’ testimony had been crucial in his conviction. In recent years, one researcher was informed by the City of Los Angeles’ Hall of Records that Parsons’ will was still sealed and that he would have to get permission from the executor to obtain a copy. The executor was Ed Forman, who is dead. When I visited the Hall of Records, the clerk was unable to find any listing for Parsons’ will in the probate records for Los Angeles county. The will, in fact, was never probated. On August 13, 1952, just a month after his tr agic death, People Today published a half-page piece on Parsons in its “People in Crime” section, which included a delightfully sinister photo of P arsons. The article was entitled “L.A.’s Lust Cult” and is worth quoting in full, to demonstrate the general attitude toward Parsons at the time. The bold print appears in the original. 185 Death and Beyond"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Rich, rock-ribbed Pasadena, famed for its r oses, the Califor nia Institute of T echnology, and as a r etirement haven for Easter n millionaires, looks like the last place a black magic cult dedi- cated to sex would thrive. Never theless, the Church of Thelema (the name means “will”), a cult practicing sexual per version, has been making converts of all ages, sexes, there since 1940. Among the believers: many pr ominent r esidents of the Pasadena-Los Angeles ar ea; at least one member of Hollywood’s movie colony. The existence of the cult, r eported to police in an anonymous letter mailed from San Antonio, Texas, in September ’42 by “A Real Soldier” and in an October ’ 44 letter, was only pr oven this June with the “accidental” death of high priest John W. Parsons. Parsons, bushy-haired, 37-year-old scientist who was one of the inventors of JATO (jet-assisted take-off), was killed when an explo- sion r ocked his lab in the car riage house of the old F .G. Cruickshank [sic] estate along Pasadena’s “Millionair e’s Row,” where he lived with his artist-wife and mother. Within hours of her son’s death, the elder Mrs. Parsons had committed suicide by swallowing 50 sleeping pills. The estate, investigators soon learned, had been the ‘T emple’ wher e Thelemites ran their strange sexual orgies. Parsons had ser ved as high priest since the death, in ’ 44, of local prophet Wilfred Smith, a disciple of Aleister Cr owley, called “the sinister man” by Fr ench authorities. Crowley’s chief command- ment: “Take your fill of love . . . with whom ye will.” Says an ex-member: “The inner circle followed this rule, espe- cially at the fer tility rites at the spring and fall equinoxes.” Tor ch-carrying hooded cultists, chanting prayers to “Thou burn- ing rapture of girls, that disport in the sunset of passion,” con- centrated on “begetting a r oyal race befor e dawn.” Other rituals: a Black Mass, patterned on a r eligious cer emony, in which High Priestess disr obed to tune of uninhibited chanting; “purifying” fir e tor ture. Members ar e accepted in the cult— which also existed in Chicago and New York—on a probationary basis, must pass thr ough 10 degrees before qualifying for par- ticipation in sex rites. With the bizarre death of Parsons and the suicide of his mother, Thelemites have gone fur ther underground. But, still active, they conducted a secret funeral for their dead high priest. 186 sex and r ockets"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"A sidebar to the article reads: Thelemites follow code set down by founder Aleister Cr owley, Englishman who died 25 years ago after a stor my life. Expelled from France and Italy, exiled from England, Crowley published his teachings under the title: Equinox . Its gist: Do anything you please. Both the article and the sidebar contain a number of errors, includ- ing the date of Crowley’s death, which was in reality in 1947, and of Smith’s, which was in 1957. In addition, at the time of the e xplosion Parsons was not the “high priest,” since, as early as January 1946, Crowley wrote a letter naming a successor to P arsons. Indeed, b y October of the y ear Crowley had become disillusioned with Parsons and wrote to Culling, “About J.W. P. [Parsons]—all that I can say is that I am sorry—I feel sure that he had fine ideas, but he was led astray firstly by Smith, then he was robbed of his last penn y b y a confidence man named Hubbar d.” And in December he wrote, “I have no further interest in Jack and his adven- tures; he is just a w eak-minded fool, and must go to the de vil in his own way. Requiescat in pace. ” Although Crowley may have found Parsons naïve and ineffectual, there are many who r ealize his k ey role in the aer ospace/military industries, and not a fe w who belie ve he accomplished amazing things esoterically , lea ving behind an e xtraordinary legac y that included “flying saucers,” which would not be surprising considering his fervent interest in space and his attempts both chemically and alchemically to “shoot for the stars.” 187 Death and Beyond"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"In fact, Kenneth Grant writes, “The [Babalon] Working began . . . just prior to the wave of unexplained aerial phenomena now recalled as the ‘Great Flying Saucer Flap.’ Parsons opened a door and some- thing flew in.” Indeed, this notion has entered certain fringe areas of pop culture. Crowley sensationalizer F rancis King mentions that P arsons felt flying saucer s “w ould pla y a part in conv erting the w orld to Crowleyanity.” When Camer on later became obsessed with flying saucers she ne ver whispered a w ord about P arsons’ interest. She believed saucers were not high-tech, but rather a “restoration of the elemental powers.” An unconfirmed statement attributed to conspiriologist John Judge claimed that Parsons may have flown with the pilot Kenneth Arnold, who in 1947 saw several silver disks over Mt. Rainier in Washington State and coined the term “flying saucer” to describe them. Another Aerojet employee, Daniel Fry, saw a saucer in 195 0 and went on to become an activ e figure in 195 0s contacteeism. Some wonderful footage of him in his final y ears is r ecorded in the film Far ewell, Good Brothers . Still another occult-oriented employee in the aerospace engineering industry , the Californian Orfeo Angelucci, claimed to have been a contactee in the 1950s. Other momentous events were attributed to Parsons. Referring to the date of Parsons’ death, Arthur Lyons said, “It was 13 years later, the period of human matur ation, that twins w ere born in San Francisco—the counter culture and the Chur ch of Satan.” Ger ald Suster, in his biography of Israel Regardie, credits Parsons with help- ing birth the sixties. After his death, Camer on continued P arsons’ w ork—not the Babalon Working, but that inv olving per sonal gr owth and e xplo- ration. She moved to the desert, living in an American artists’ colony in northern Me xico (San Miguel de Allende), ne xt door to Da vid Siquieros and Max Ernst’ s wife Lenor a Carrington. Camer on and Soror Estai (Jane W olfe) struck up a v oluminous correspondence. Here’s hoping that this potentially fascinating communication will be made public by the OTO or whomever has it. On December 15, 1952, Camer on wrote to Jane W olfe, “Seven years ago, Jack began an oper ation which he r eferred to as the Babalon Work—and this set into motion the second part of a great force which w as divided into thr ee.

This lar ge claim comes despite the kno wn fact that P arsons believed Cameron was an elemental who he hoped w ould later giv e “birth” to Babalon. He w ould not ha ve predicted Babalon’s physical manifestation to occur within se ven years, as he did in 1949 in The Manifesto of the AntiChrist , if she were already on earth. After the three- day working of March 1946, Parsons proclaimed, “Babalon is incarnate upon the earth today, awaiting the proper hour of Her manifestation.” In 1949 Parsons revised this statement, perhaps anticipating Cameron’s return. The year 1949 must have been significant to Parsons—the book that purportedly came from Babalon is titled Liber 49 . Par sons’ Songs for the Witch Woman is dedicated to Cameron, “in whom She is incarnate.” But in “The Star of Babalon” P arsons says that Her spirit is within all w omen who pr oclaim their equality to men. If this is indeed the case , a billion women on planet Earth ar e now wearing Babalon’s tiara. In 1953, Cameron wrote: For some months now I have been aware of the heightening inten- sity of what I call a thir d beam of hearing. I can describe it as the sound of a radio beam that one picks up on shor twave. It is inde- pendent of my normal hearing—if I close my eyes it is not affected in any way. There are moments when it is so intense that I can actually tune it in—by turning my body. It seems to be heightened in power by the presence of some other humans . . . I have the feel- ing that ther e is someone on the other end, or let me say that I have the feeling that the beam transcends time and space and that I am hearing the sound of my transmitter echoed in incr edible places. While her auditory experiences were being inhumanly heightened, Cameron saw a flying saucer. In a letter to Jane Wolfe dated January 22, 1953, Camer on speculated the UFO was the “w ar-engine” men- tioned in The Book of the Law III: 7-8 (“I will give you a war-engine. With it ye shall smite the peoples; and none shall stand before you.”) Eight years earlier Crowley wondered if the atomic bomb constituted this engine. 189 Death and Beyond"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"In another letter Cameron wrote about: [Mars], which I believe, is somehow my home.

The fateful y ear of 1953 also sa w the death of Mark M. Mills , Par sons’ former associate, in a helicopter crash at an Eniwetok atomic bomb test site. Mills holds some of the solid fuel patents with Parsons and also co-authored some once-classified papers on solid fuel. Next year Cameron played both the Scarlet Woman and Kali, the Hindu goddess of destruction, in K enneth Anger’ s short film, Inauguration of the Pleasur e Dome . Notorious for his under ground films and authorship of the Hollywood Babylon books, Anger is also known for rescuing Crowley’s paintings and ephemera in the Sicilian “Abbey of Thelema,” from which Crowley and company were tossed by Benito Mussolini in 1932.

On Halloween 1968, JPL honored the 32nd anniversary of its nativ- ity by dedicating a plaque behind its visitors’ center. During the ded- ication, JPL held a lar ge celebration, even going so far as to invite wives and ex-girlfriends who had been present during the tests. But they did not invite Ed Forman or Rudolph Schott, both of whom were still alive and living in the area. Nonetheless, Forman donated an old rocket and papers he had saved from the original tests, all of which have since been lost. In 1969, the London Sunday Times ran an article on L. R on Hubbard’s early inv olvement with magick. The Chur ch of Scientology protested, and in r eturn the paper printed v erbatim the Church’s statement concerning Hubbard’s involvement with Parsons. Hubbard br oke up black magic in America: Dr . Jack Parsons of Pasadena, California, was America’s Number One solid fuel r ocket expert. He was involved with the infamous English black magician Aleister Crowley who called himself ‘The Beast 666.’ Crowley ran an organization called the Or der of Templars Orientalis over the world which had savage and bestial rites. Dr . Parsons was head of the American branch located at 100 Orange Gr ove Avenue, Pasadena, California. This was a huge old house which had paying guests who were the U.A.S. nuclear physicists working at Cal. tech. Certain agen- cies objected to nuclear physicists being housed under the same roof. L. Ron Hubbard was still an officer of the U.S. Navy [and] because he was well known as a writer and philosopher and had friends among the physicists, he was sent in to handle the situation. He went to live at the house and investigated the black magic rites and the general situation and found them ver y bad. Parsons wrote to Cr owley in England about Hubbar d.

This was all proven by the correspondence unearthed by the [London] Sunday Times. Hubbard’s mission was successful far beyond anyone’s expectations. The house was torn down. Hubbard rescued a girl they wer e using. The black magic gr oup was dis- persed and never r ecovered. The physicists included many of the sixty-four top U.S. scientists who were later declared insecure and dismissed from government service with so much publicity. 34 Despite the vilification and br ouhaha, in 1972 the International Astronomical Union in France honored Parsons by naming a crater on the moon after him. “Parsons Crater” is at 37 0 N latitude, 171 0 W longi- tude, and, appropriately enough, on the dark side of the moon. Due to the Ranger survey, the first to photograph the dark side and reveal hun- dreds of new craters in need of names, NASA turned to its own past to provide them. Parsons was the only GALCIT scientist to earn this honor, in which Frank Malina, now living in France, may have had a hand. Par sons’ buddy, Ed Forman, died in 1973 of heart tr ouble while employed by Lockheed in El Segundo. Despite his lifelong closeness with Parsons, Forman never joined the OTO . (Parsons’ mother, Ruth, also worked at Lockheed during the war.) It is evident that Parsons was considered an important if danger- ous figure by the authorities. His FBI file, which was requested prior to the Freedom of Information Act as part of a JPL history project, is heavily censored. Although FOIA rules have since changed, when one requests the file one normally gets a photocop y of the file that has already been processed. There have been no updates, simply because the FBI hasn’t noticed or doesn’t want to bother with it. Among the many reasons Parsons was investigated was not only the “black magic” but also his association with communist s ympa- thizers. Fellow GALCIT group member, Frank Malina, whose efforts served the U.S. quite effectively, was also a victim of the Communist witchhunts.

Malina died in France in 1981. It may have been Malina who first introduced the late John Parsons to the UFO -researcher and debunker, Jacques Vallee, who was the role model for the French scientist in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Vallee suggests that JPL would deny Parsons ever existed; but, as evi- denced by a memorial plaque on JPL grounds (and numerous conver- sations with the staff of JPL ) the opposite is actually the case. After the war, group leader and rocket scientist von Kármán was invited to Germany to inspect various Nazi research installations like the one at Peenemünde. This visit occurred at the invitation of Hap Arnold and his other old friends in Washington. Von Kármán’s auto- biography, The Wind and Beyond , contains pictures from his trip to Germany, including one shot of him interrogating a German scientist. As previously noted, v on Kármán w orked in German y during the decade following World War I. After W orld War II, he w as instru- mental in recruiting Nazi scientists to the United States.

Von Kármán spent the ne xt two decades engaged in various aeronautics research projects and died in 1963, a giant among men. GALCIT member and alleged spy Hsue-shen Tsien had an interesting if troubled life after the war ended. Evidently he was accused of being a Communist simply because he was Chinese, as, years later, Malina’s widow told an interviewer, “We never saw him at any of the cell meet- ings.” This incident embarr assed Tsien so much he decided to r eturn to China—something he thought he’d never do. However, immigration stopped him at the docks and detained him for fiv e years, by which time, the authorities figur ed, anything he kne w would be obsolete . Then they deported him, and subsequently he singlehandedly built the Chinese missile pr ogram from scratch using what he had learned at GALCIT . Tsien’s fascinating life is r ecounted in Iris Chang’s biography, Thread of the Silk Worm. In 1989, a collection of Parsons’ unpublished essays, Freedom Is A Two-Edged Sword , appeared and renewed interest in the man, which 193 Death and Beyond"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"has sur ged with the adv ent of the W orld Wide W eb. The book includes Parsons’ commentary on the “Red Scare.” Much of the other material reproduced in Freedom Is A Two-Edged Sword deals with two of Parsons’ post- OTO projects: The Gnosis and The Witchcr aft. The former was an attempt to set up a regular form of worship for Parsons and for whomever would follow. Par sons christianized his Gnosis by having Sophia, the incarnation of wisdom, play the role of the daughter of God, equating her with the Holy Ghost. In Parsons’ version, Sophia’s union with Christ was equal to God. In “tr aditional” Gnosticism, Sophia w as usually the mother of God, and Christ the savior of both. Only in Parsons’ work do we find the alternative formula, to which end Parsons wrote “On Magick,” “The Gnostic Creed,” and “The Gnostic Doctrine.” Par sons’ other project was The Witchcraft, a course on magick for the layman. Surviving documents include “Basic Magick: Fundamental Theory and Practice,” “Manifesto of The Witchcraft,” and a few chap- ters of a book called The Cup, the Sword and the Crux Ansata . Parsons wrote the manifesto June 15, 195 0, but he still thought enough of Babalon to note this as the y ear 4000. However, the date is inconsis- tent with pr evious Babalon-influenced dates . In 1946, Hubbar d pro- claimed the year Babalon 4063, and in 1949 Parsons dated The Book of AntiChrist 4066 . The year 4000 may indicate a change of his number- ing system; it is not a misprint. Par sons’ purpose in creating these texts was clear: To Cameron he wrote, “Simplicity has been the k ey to victory in all the idea w ars and, at present, Magick does not have it. There is the skeleton in the Rights of Man [Crowley’s Liber OZ ], and the coverings in the main lit- erature. But the true body has never been shown forth.” In addition, short outlines on “General Field Theory” that Parsons left unfinished could almost be taken as precursors of the late Rupert Sheldrake’s “morphogenetic field theory .” Notes on W agner’s The Ring take us to the final chapter of Freedom : it is “The Star of Babalon,” already mentioned. Part of Parsons’ The Book of Babalon , this chapter consists of instructions received from Babalon herself for the Magical Child. Much like the magical letter in the beautiful gnos- tic “Hymn of the P earl,” these instructions would serve to effect an anamnesis (awakening) on the child’s part, to further her mission on Earth. This text serves as further e vidence that it w as not Cameron who was to become Babalon, but someone as yet unknown. As noted, Camer on occasionally sho wed her art, but she ne ver sold it. In fact, much of her early w ork she destr oyed.

Camer on w as included posthumously in the “Beat Gener ation” sho w at the Whitne y Museum in Ne w York in late 1995. Near the end of her life she requested permission fr om JPL to give her gr andson Silver a tour , wanting him to see wher e his “grandfather” had worked, a request that was granted. Cameron died of cancer on July 24, 1995, aged 73. Having reviewed the life of John P arsons in more depth than most writers, I ha ve come to the conclusion that he has been misunder- stood—even misrepresented. Historians of rocketry and the space pro- gram seem to have underestimated his contributions to the field, while writers on the occult have romanticized him as some sort of great sor- cerer. Without his contributions to both solid and liquid fuels , the American space program would not be where it is today. In less than five years, Parsons accomplished what Robert Goddard could not do in a lifetime. The list concerning the top leader s in the world of rocketry contained in von Kármán’s 1958 letter, written the same y ear as the solid-fueled Explorer I , was self-aggrandizing, as von Kármán himself admitted. To wit, Malina had written to von Kármán concerning opin- ion on who were the top 10 Americans who had contributed to the pro- gram. “Starting, of course, with ourselves, the list is of the following,” von Kármán replied. Parsons name was at the top. While one cannot take von Kármán’s name off the top of that list, there is justification for placing P arsons’ name abo ve Malina’ s, as Par sons is the individual who per severed in the face of r epeated fail- ures, and Parsons and the others funded their own research until some- one (Hap Arnold) finally took notice . Furthermore, Parsons was the one in the field blowing up rocket after rocket until he found just the right combination that w orked. Von Kármán encour aged him, but Par sons did the difficult and e xtremely hazardous work. Everything today in the field of solid fuel r ockets is essentially P arsons’ work, if slightly modified. Obviously , it cannot be said that P arsons single- handedly won the war, but his JATO swere deployed in several areas for its last thr ee y ears. In addition, the global compan y A erojet w as founded upon Parsons’ innovations with solid fuels, and nothing else. It is likely that Parsons’ underestimation had little to do with his occult activities, which seem to ha ve been tolerated as one of man y eccentricities associated with his brand of genius. Amo Smith had his pith helmet, Malina was a communist, and von Kármán talked about the golem—this was the normal state of affair s at Caltech.

He did not hold a degree from an accredited university. One of the biggest questions r emaining is wh y P arsons and Forman abandoned r ockets altogether at the end of the w ar. Their early work was diverted into other dir ections as the w ar demanded new technologies, yet it was not they but Malina who took up pur e rocketry after the war ended. Was Parsons’ work with the OTO more important now than his profession? Did Aerojet make him sign a non- competition agr eement? W as he r esting on his laur els when he should have been pursuing other fields of research? Or was there sim- ply no funding for such things an ymore? Hopefully, and likely, con- sidering Parsons’ mentality, his original inter est was more than a matter of mere profit, but what had started as a passion got lost in the distraction of war and personal upheavals. Today, Parsons’ inspir ed ingr edient for r ocket fuel, ammonium perchlorate, is causing its o wn pr oblems. A ccording to Jonathan Parfrey, president of Physicians for Social Responsibility, toxicological studies by the EPA show that perchlorate is an endocrine disruptor which also harms fetal development. Perchlorate has also been linked to conditions like aplastic anemia and hypothyroidism. After having leached into groundwater at Aerojet’s Sacramento, San Gabriel and Chino Hills facilities , multimillion-dollar per chlorate cleanups ar e currently underway. In contradistinction to the under estimation in the field of r ocket science and the aerospace industry, Parsons’ accomplishments in the arcane sciences have been highly overrated and grossly exaggerated. As a magician he was essentially a failure. As a Thelemite he learned the hard way what w as required. He lo ved Crowley’s “Law” but couldn’t adhere to it—though he tried harder than most. He violated the rules, undertook unauthorized and unorthodo x magical oper a- tions, and claimed the gr ade of Magister Templi without first com- pleting all the gr ades below it. He couldn’t handle w orking under authority—his ego w as too big. His r ecord of failur e is v aluable in that regard. He w as a gr eat promulgator of thelemic ideals in his essays, but as an idealist his elitism ruined his w ork. Indeed, some would say he was guilty of hubris , which the gods always punish. In his (short) per sonal and business liv es Parsons also scor ed poorly. His romantic naiveté led him to trust those whom he should not have trusted.

In addition, his mix-up with the Israelis was perhaps a sim- ple mistake in judgement, but one that he could ha ve avoided quite easily. He admired them but misjudged U.S. policy. The whole matter of his death has also been gr eatly overempha- sized. Suicide is simply not tenable, and the only clear possible mur- der suspect is K ynette, the cr ooked cop, although ther e ma y be others. A U.S. scientist who attempted to pass go vernment “secrets” onto the Isr aelis, and who w as loading e xplosive chemicals on a truck bound for Mexico and then Israel, may have won himself a few anonymous enemies. Despite these suspicions and the fact that P arsons was an experi- enced handler of explosives, his death may truly have been acciden- tal. As noted, P arsons sw eated pr ofusely, as tw o separ ate acquaintances have testified, one of them also pointing out ho w hot it was that June day in 1952. Even a safety-conscious expert could let a tin can slip out of a sw eaty hand. The hole in the floor, the shrap- nel stuck in lo w places, the loss of the right arm, all point to a dropped container . And it is questionable just ho w “safety-con- scious” was a man who stored all sorts of dangerous explosives in his kitchen, on the back porch, in unlicensed labs in residential areas. The only evidence not easily e xplained is the detectiv e’s original comment that the e xplosion occurred behind Par sons, and the fact that the trash can was full of explosive substances which should not have been ther e. Murder cannot be ruled out, but a sad accident seems more likely. Had the notorious Los Angeles police investigated the scene, we could consider a co verup.

But fulminate of mercury is not stable enough for a mur der scheme that had to be clever enough to fool an expert.

It’s true that fulminate of mercury becomes more dangerous as it dries, but as soon as P arsons had seen a can of dried fulminate of mer cury, he would’ve known someone had planted it ther e. Of course, unless it was beneath the floorboard, as Cameron claimed to have discovered, and cordite with a fulminate of mercury fuse may be a possibility.

Day-to-day activity stopped as people look up and wait for the end. Suddenly a loud noise was heard, and a bright flash of light was seen overhead. It was not what was expected, i.e., the explosion of the planet: It was the first rocket ship. It was indeed the end of the world, the story concluded, but the beginning of the univ erse.

She w as survived by her son Kwen Smith and his wife , along with their two children and their two grandchildren. Helen was the oldest OTO initiate at the time of her death, the numer ologically significant age of 93. Her obituary sa ys that for a long period in her life “she may well have been the only regularly active priestess in the world who carried forth the celebr ation of the mass of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica .” Per her wishes there was no funeral; she enjoyed her privacy to the end. One other notable event took place since this book was first pub- lished four y ears ago. I w as able to unco ver the inspir ation for Par sons’ Black Pilgrimage , which I discussed in chapter 1 0. The source was M.R. James’ short story “Count Magnus ,” published in 1904. It has been reprinted in several places; my copy is in Collected Ghost Stories , published b y W ordsworth Editions , Ltd. in 1992. I believe the story may also be found online. The fictional Count Magnus De la Gardie was a late 16th-century/ early 17th-century mage residing in a huge manor in Vestergothland, Sweden. He seems to have been named for a real Count Magnus who lived in the same area from 1622 to 1686, but the tw o have nothing else in common. The center of the story is the m ysterious Black Pilgrimage he w as said to ha ve undertaken, what form it actually took, and what he brought back from it. The nature of the pilgrimage itself is never discovered, though the thing he brought back is hinted at. It seems to ha ve been some sort of supernatur al beast, a demon or familiar spirit that protected Magnus even in death. James does specify the destination of the Black Pilgrimage. It was Chorazin in Palestine (now in Israel), the city which Jesus cursed, the city which later legends said w ould birth the Antichrist, the city which Parsons also named as the destination of his pilgrimage . Its unique black ruins still stand; they are black because they are made of the local basalt. Of all of Chor azin’s ruins, the best-known is the unfinished synagogue. James has Magnus write of his Liber nigrae peregrinationis , “If any man desires to obtain a long life, if he would"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"obtain a faithful messenger and see the blood of his enemies , it is necessary that he should first go into the city of Chorazin, and there salute the prince [of the air].” The story doesn’t specify ho w long Magnus lived, but based on internal evidence one may deduce it was around 120 years. The story does mak e clear that Magnus obtained his faithful messenger, and did have occasion to see the blood of his enemies. On F ebruary 28, 1946 P arsons wr ote Liber 49 , a book fr om Babalon whose 58th v erse sa ys, “Thou shalt mak e the Black Pilgrimage.” No further details w ere given until Parsons wrote The Book of AntiChrist a few years later. In The Book of AntiChrist , the first section of which is entitled “The Black Pilgrimage ,” Parsons wrote that he began his pilgrimage in November of 1949, in response to a dream he says came from Babalon. He describes the pilgrimage as an astral working conducted in his temple. Par sons wrote, “And I went into the sunset with Her sign, and into the night past accursed and desolate places and cyclopean ruins, and so came at last to the City of Chor azin. And there a great tower of Black Basalt was raised, that was part of a castle whose further bat- tlements reeled over the gulf of the star s. And upon the to wer was this sign [a circle inscribed with an inverted triangle]. And one heav- ily robed and veiled showed me the sign, and told me to look, and behold, I saw flash below me four past lives wherein I had failed in my object.” P arsons goes on to name these past liv es; I ha ve described each of them in detail in chapter 1 0. After this he writes , “And thereafter I w as taken within and saluted the Prince of that place . . .,” echoing Magnus’ instructions to go into the city and salute the Prince of the Air. Judging from hints in Parsons’ letters to Karl Germer in 1949 and later, his purpose was not long life, a faith- ful messenger, nor to see the blood of his enemies; it was always the furtherance of Thelema. (But if the furtherance of Thelema necessi- tated an y of these , Parsons sur ely hoped the y w ould follo w. He specifically names Christianity—all of Christianity—as the enem y of mankind.) The pilgrimage itself is not mentioned again in his sur- viving writings. In Ghosts & Scholars issue 26, Jamesian scholars Rosemary Pardoe and Jane Nicholls discuss the possible literary and historical sources for James’ Black Pilgrimage . They document James’ kno wledge of the apocryphal Revelation of the Pseudo-Methodius (fourth century) in which Chor azin is fir st mentioned as the birthplace of the Antichrist, as well as his familiarity with W. Bousset’s Der Antichrist , 201 Afterword"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"published in 1895, which also documents the legend. James’ favorite story by the early Irish horr or writer Sheridan Le F anu was “The Familiar,” in which the phr ase “the prince of the po wers of the air” occurs. The phr ase originates with St. P aul, who r efers to Satan in this manner in Ephesians 2:2, and James w ould have known about its Biblical origin as well. Par doe and Nicholls also document James’ familiarity with John Dee. James edited a list of Dee’ s manuscripts in 1921, compiling his list from several others and from original sources. One of the titles on Elias Ashmole’s list was Liber Peregrinationis Primae ( The Book of the First Pilgrimage ). The author s speculate that this title influenced James’ Liber nigr ae per egrinationis ( The Book of the Black Pilgrimage ). This may be, but it only takes a basic knowledge of Latin to translate such a title. (Dee’s book describes magical conversations recorded during a trip to Krakow in 1583.) Par doe and Nicholls e xcel when the y sho w just ho w P arsons could’ve encounter ed James’ story—and it occurr ed only months before he received his instruction to go on the Black Pilgrimage from Babalon. Samuel D. Russell wrote an essay on James which appeared in the Fall 1945 issue of The Acolyte (a fanzine). Russell and Parsons both frequented the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society (LASFS), so it’s fairly certain that James was discussed there. Parsons received his instructions on February 28, 1946, which seems to imply he had been reading James recently. Unless further e vidence appear s, it appear s that M.R. James invented the Black Pilgrimage as a liter ary device based on legends of Chor azin, r ather than its being a genuine magical tr adition. Par sons took inspiration for a magical working based on this concept, just as he had tak en inspir ation fr om other fantas y w orks (for instance, his fa vorite no vel w as Jack Williamson’ s supernatur al thriller Darker Than Y ou Think , discussed in chapter 4.) R ecall Crowley’s letter criticizing Parsons for taking such a lo w form of lit- erature so seriously. Despite the criticism, Parsons continued to take his inspiration wherever he would find it. James doesn’t tell us how Count Magnus died; his death is a mys- tery, as is Parsons’. In contrast, however, Magnus had something that Par sons didn’t. He had his “faithful messenger ,” the thing that he brought back from his Black Pilgrimage, the thing that protected his estate even after his death.
