McGiolla Cathain Copynght @) f993 FINBARR INTERNATIONAL FINBARR 165 Fe' t"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Gypsy Spells and Incantations The gypsy people are wanderers. Their ancestors are thought to have come from India around A.D. 1300. They wandered through Iran to Armenia, Syria, Egypt, and North Africa. They then moved into Hungary, Romania, France, Russia, and even England. It is the ones from Romania that we will deal with. These people were nomadic, and very few settled down and established homes. They were called by various names such as Children of Little Egypt, Tziganes, Maniches, and Romanies. Gypsies have always jealously guarded their customs and tradi- tions, so much of their magical practices are not known. But the spells and incantations that are known have proved to be very powerful. Hitler was a black magician and feared anyone who like himself had any esoteric or occult knowledge, either good or bad. He would kill anyone that he suspected of having occult links. For this reason thousands of gypsies in \\forld \\Var II were slaughtered by Hitler, and his nazi concentration camps housed many of them. Gypsies are always thought of as pranksters and petty thieves. This is to a certain extent still the case today. Although it is commonly believed to be true, it is a misconception. The Romany people were skilled musicians and metalworkers, since ancient times they have been blacksmiths and horse traders. They were also skilled and experienced in the art of magick. In this book we have given a number of powerful spells and incantations. If they are used in coniunction with the instructions we have given they will bring you all the love and happiness you deserve. These spells are very powerful and sacred, they must be treated with respect. If they are used wisely they will prove to be very effective. They do not come from the fairground gypsies, who pretend to read your fortune, by making their predictions so wide ranged that at least some of them will fit your circumstances. These fairground gypsies have little to do with the Romany gypsies of which we speak. These fairground gypsies should be avoided. There is a story of one of these gypsies. The \"gypsy\" would have a helper stand not too far away from her stall. This helper would watch the people who were about to go into the stall, to see if they"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"would give any clues to their identity. He would watch the people take off their wedding rings and go into the gypsy's stall. Then he would give her a sign telling her what he saw. The \"gypsy\" would then tell the person that they were married. This would leave the client in awe, and ensure that he would believe the rest of her predictions. It should be noted that with the incantations that follow, the pronunciation should be as if you were speaking French. This seems to give the most efficient results. The language is based on the ancient Sanskrit or Prakrit. These spells are very old and very powerful. They can work wonders in your life, if only you let them. (If you have any difficulty in pronouncing the words you can instead write them on - preferably parchmenr-paper - with a black pen all the while thinking of your desire as you do so. \\fhether spoken or written these incantations will work). Powerful Love Spells As with all these spells, it is advisable to sit down, for a few moments, and think about the reasons behind vour desire. There are three things to consider:. l. Do you really want this thing? 2. r$(/ill what you want be good for you? 3. Is it necessary to use a spell to achieve your aims? After you have considered your options and have decided to go ahead with your objective, you must choose the appropriate spell. The spell that most suits you only you will know. If one fails then try another, but the one you feel most comfortable with will generally be the one for you. You may wish to use an attraction spell or you may wish to bind the person whom you seek. \\ilThichever spell you choose keep in mind that you are calling on power that has worked for the Gypsy people for centuries. It will work for you, if you treat the spells with respect and not as a joke or pany-piece. Now that you have considered your options let us begin the spellwork. 2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"To attract a female Obtain a green candle, of any size or shape. \\[ash this candle under running water and leave to dry. Once the candle has completely dried, inscribe on it the name of the woman/girl you wish to come to you. The inscription can be made with a knife or by heating, slightly, a needle. The name inscribed should be the most used one, that is the name that everyone calls her. For example her name may be Elizabeth, but everyone calls her Beth, or Liza or Lisa, whatever she is called by the majority of people who know her, this is the name to use. This candle now represents the woman. In a passive frame of mind visualise the woman you desire standing before you. Light the candle. As you hold this picture in your mind state in a loud voice the following incantation three times: \"Me jiuklo, yoy iiukli Yoy tover, me pori Me kokosh, yoy cdtrd Add 6de, me kamdv!\" After reciting the above, visualise the woman running with open arms towards you, as you say: \"You want (state your name) to be your lover\". Repeat this ten times. The spell is now complete and you should relax and return to your normal business, in complete knowledge that your spell has worked. To attract a male Obtain a green candle. Prepare this in the same way as before by washing it in running water and leaving it to dry. Then on this candle inscribe the name of your lover-to-be. As we mentioned before, this can be done with a knife or by using a warm needle. Again in a passive frame of mind, visualise the man you desire standing before you. Feel his presence. Now light the candle. As you hold the picture of your future lover in your mind speak this incantation loudlv:"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\"Upro pguv hin but puguv6 K6s kdmdv mdnge th'6v14! Bdrvol, bdrvol, sdlciye, Brigd nd hin mdnge! Yov tover, me pori Yov Kokosh. me cdtrd Ade,6dd me kdmdv\". These spells will not only make the person attracted to you but they should also bring them to you. You will probably find that the person will go out of his/her way to be near you. The person may try to seduce you or may not approach you at all. If this happens you must weigh the situation. The person may be too shy to make the first move. \\07e have found that many students fail in love spells because they refuse to see that the spell has already worked. A spell will make a person attracted to you, but if you do not act on this then nothing may well happen. Don't worry, you will know if the spell has worked, even shy people find it hard to disguise their feelings. So if this does happen, it is up to you to approach the person. Ask them to go for a drink or whatever interests them. You will not regret it! A Gypsy binding spell This spell, if performed properly, should prove to be very effective. It must be performed while the moon is waning (that state between a new and full moon). Acquire two white candles, a red or pink candle and a piece of rope, string or thread of the same colour, at least six inches long. Place all the paraphernalia in a circle of salt, about eight inches in diameter. One of the white candles will represent you while the other will represent your prospective lover. These candles should be inscribed with the names of the persons they represent, by the use of a knife or warm needle. The other candle is symbolic of your objective aim, red for passion, or pink for love, use whichever is appropriate. These candles should now be consecrated for the work in hand. Hold each candle in turn, while visualising your desired outcome, and repeat: 4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"\"You are now blessed and clean and free, you will fulfil and bring this wish to me\". Light the obfective candle and then lift the two subject candles, one in each hand. Light these two with flame of the objective candle and in a loud commanding voice say: \"Kay o kdm, avriiivel Kiya m6nge lele beshel Kay o k6m tel'6vel Kiya leldkri me beshav\". Bring the three candles together. Take the rope or string and tie them to each other saying: \"As I tie this knot, I bind together (state your name and the name of your lover-to-be), in greatest love. SO MOTE IT BE!\" After this snuff the candles out. The ritual is complete and you can go about your normal business. Keep the tied candles in a safe place, away from people. This will ict like a talisman and make your spell much more potent. _ If after performing the above spell you get tired of the relationship that_ you have become involved in, then simply untie the knot ani perform the incantation below. Breaking the Bond Acquire two white candles and a pink (or red) candle. on the white candles inscribe your name and the name of your lover, on the pink candle inscribe the word \"love\". Hold th.r. candles in your hands and visualise them becoming the thing they represent, i.e. the pink candle becomes filled with the power of love, and your candle becomes filled with your life energy, erc. Now tie these candles together with a piece of red or pink rope, string or cord. Light the candles together. Say: \"Venti cinque carte siete! Venti cinque diavoli diventerete, Diventerete, Anderete Nel'corpo, nel'sanquenell'anima, Nell sentimenti del corpo;"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Del mio amante non posso vivere, Non passa stare nebere, Ne mangiare ne Ne con uomini ne con donne non passa Favellare Finche ala pota dicasa mia Non viene picchiare!\". Break the rope that binds the candles together. Now take the pink candle and blow it out, make sure that you don't blow out either the candle that represents you or the candle that represents your lover. Say: \"The bond is broken and the light of love is dead!\" Now separate the other two candles and snuff them out. The spell is complete and you should go about your normal affairs. Very soon your partner will become resrless and will feel that he/ she wishes to end the relationship. A Spell for Enhancing Passion After performing the next rite you will need fire extinguishers to calm the raging passion that will develop between you and your lover. On a Friday, write on a plain piece of white or green paper, the name of the person you desire and your own name. Around this draw a heart. Next you will need to obtain an apple. A green apple is best. Cut the apple in half. Between the two halves place your piece of paper. Then hold the apple together with some string, cord or rope, and tie three knots in it. Then say: \"T're b6ct me gav, T're baEt me piydv, Ddv tute m're bagt Kdnd tu m6nge s61\". Take a bite of the apple and eat it. At night go to your prospective lover's house and bury it in herftris garden. If the person does not have a garden, then bury it as near to her/tris home as possible. If you can't bury it, hide amongst some bushes or trees. 6"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"You will notice the effects of this spell the next time you come into contact with the person. To STin Back a Lost Love Many people find that they lose a lover to someone else, or the person leaves for reasons of hislher own, and this can be very damaging to your life. \\flory no more, for here is a very powerful spell that will bring back any disenchanted lover. For this spell you will need to obtain three leaves from a willow tree. The willow tree is held sacred by the Gypsies. Go out to your garden. If you do not have a garden go to a park or into the countryside. Throw the leaves behind you one at a time. Each time saying: \"Per de, per de pr6jjina, Varekai hin hasz Kdmav? Bas6, parro dz siuklo Pirano dzfll mai szigo\". visualise your lover coming back to you each time you say this. The stronger the visualisation the sooner the spell will manifest. It would also be a good idea to consecrate the talisman for Luck in Love. After drawing it out on parchment, prick yourself with a pin and let a few drops of blood fall onto it. Then hold up the talisman and say: \"Mro rat dav piraneszke, Kasz Dikhav, Avava adaleske\". It should be noted that if parchment is unobtainable then only white paper should be used as a substitute. Brenda Gets Her Man Brenda, a shy 20 year old, was employed in a Kiss-o-Gram agency as an office assistant. She was not very pretty and not at all outgoing. She felt destitute when she fell head over heels for a young model who started work in the Kiss-o-Gram agency. He never even noticed that she was alive. Brenda came to us for help. \\7e advised her to overcome her shyness and ask the man for a date. Believing in us, she complied."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Unfortunately the results were devastating for her. The young man said no! After discussing the matter, we felt rather guilty and decided to help Brenda with her love life. \\Ufle gave her the spell for arrracting a male. She was a little doubtful about it's effectiveness, which was not surprising considering her lack of faith in us after our initial mistake, (we are only human, like everyone else). she eventually agreed to try the spell and was not dissapointed. The next day at work the young man was being overly friendly, and was spending more time in the office than he was out working. Brenda knew the spell had started to work, so she prepared herself for the date, which she knew he would ask her for. She was right again. Two days later he asked her to go to lunch with him, and here he explained that he had made a terrible mistake refusing her date. They then began seeing each other regularly. T.S.'s Lover T.S. was having no luck with love, in fact he was having no luck with women. He found it hard ro start a relationship and when he did it would turn out disastrous. The women he always dated were wrong for him. They would try to run his life, and this would lead him into the depths of despair. Although he believed in the power of magick and mind power, he could never seem to make it work for him. By chance he stumbled upon the gypsy spell to artract a female. Although this spell was designed for a woman the magician already knows, he thought he would try it out with his own situation. Itrfhen performing the spell he visualised women of all kinds being attracted to him, he saw them running towards him with open arms. For three days nothing happened and T.S. was starting to doubt the spell. This was his mistake! On the fourth day a few of his work mates asked him to go to a disco, he was reluctant. His past experience of discos and the women therein was not good. But after constant verbal attacks from his work mates he gave in. That night T.S. couldn't believe his luck. All kinds of girls and women were coming straight up to him and asking for a dance. He also found it much easier to talk to these women, as he now felt a strange feeling of power over them. 8"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"This was by no means the end of it. From that day forth he has found it hard to go anywhere without getting a lot of aitention from women. Although he has nor yer found his ideal parrner at leasr he has plenty to choose from. M.M. Breaks the Bond M.M., an attractive 19 year old girl, found that she was tiring of the relationship with her boyfriend of three years. She decided to rid herself of her boyfriend and free herself completely from his grip. Her way to do this was through the gypsy spell. She put it to woik immediately. The same day her lover came to her. - He seemed restless and uptight. He started an argument and walked out. Later that week he telephoned her to let her know it was all over and he no longer wished ro have anything to do with her. Such is the power of magick. Revenge \\ife know of one case where a magician used the \"breaking the bond\" spell to force two lovers apart. This magician becamJvery jealous when an enemy of his started to date a very attractive blond- haired girl. This girl also happened to be close friends with the magician's girlfriend. He decided to take action. He had no wish to perform a psychic attack for magical reasons - so he would break them up. This is exactly what he did. He used the gypsy way. That pme day the two lovers had a fierce argument and split-up on very bad terms. Health-Curing Ailments In the incantations rhat follow, you are calling on the aid of the \"Pcuvuscheske\", or earth spirit. In each of the incantations you are asking the \"Pcuvuscheske\" to take the illness from you, ind bring it into the earth. Here the earch neutralises the ilinesi and turns it from negative to positive energy."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"So while intoning the incanrarions it is importanr to visualise a cloud of blackness surrounding the affected part of your body. While reciting the incantations see this blackness leaving your body via your feet. This will make it easier for the earth spirit to do his iob. A good idea to help your incantations along is to acquire a green candle to represent the \"Pcuvuscheske\". You may also use a white candle to represent you, if you wish. These candles are only an extra touch, they are by no means a necessity. If you choose to use them, then they will need to be consecrated. Consecration Take the candles and run them under the cold water tap. Leave them to dry, do not dry them yourself. Once dried they should be inscribed with the appropriate name. The green one should be inscribed with the name \"Pcuvuscheske\" or \"Earth Spirit\". The white one should be inscribed with your name, or the name of the person to be healed. These candles now symbolise the earth spirit and yourself, or, of course, the person to be healed. Now to the incantations. Stomach Pains Hold your hand over your stomach, if right-handed use the right if left-handed use the left. The earth spirit will send healing energy through your hand, and into this area, as well as taking the illness from you. Say: \"euckerdya pal m're per Caven save misece! euckerdya pal -'r. p., den misegeske drom odry preji6l!\" Visualise the blackness moving down through your body ro your feet, and out into the ground you stand on. The earth spirit will take care of the rest. For Influenza With this spell you will need to take parrs of your body separately l0"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"starting with your head. Then move to your upper half and then your lower half. Say: \"Shil6lyi preji6, pdflori me tut 'ddv! N6fli me tut k6mdv; Andakode prejia odoy tut dudiden odoy tut ferinen odoy tut may kdmen! Mashurdalo s6stydr! Shildlyi, shildlyi preji6. \" There will be an immediate improvement in your sleeping pattern. After about two days your sleepless nights should have disappeared forever, and the other symptoms of the \"flu\" will disappear with them. '$fith this spell the earth spirit will build up your natural resistance to the \"flu\" and the \"cold\". It will be a long time before you suffer again. For Headache This spell will take immediate effect. Remember to visualise the blackness around your head departing from your body through your feet. This spell is ideal for people who suffer from migraines. If the symptoms persist then we would strongly advise you to see a doctor, for this is a very effective spell. Stand up straight and relax your body. Take a deep breath and say: \"Oh duk 6ndro m'ro shero the o d6d misegescro, ad6 dikhel 6kdna man tu m6y dost6, miirdyds, miro shero tu mdrdyds!

From here see it leave your body and enter the ground below you. Say: \"Oh dukh andrdl ydkh6 jd andrd p6fli ia andrdl pani andrd safrdne andr6 pguv jd andrill pguv kiya pguvuscheske. - Odoy hin gerc6, odoy ja te ga.\" Here is another incantation for sore eyes. These incantations are also good for tired eyes and eye strain. In this spell you should close your ey9s. This will mean memorising the following incantation. Say: \"Duy yakha hin mange duy punra hin mangre dukh andral yakha ia andre punra ja andral punra ja andre pcuv ja andral pcuv andro meriben!\" No other action is required for this spell, just voice the incantation aloud. The results should be immediate.. Toothache This is ideal for sensitive teeth or gums. It will work very well and can be used to relieve pain when you are waiting for a iental appointment. This spell should not be used as a replacement for medical assistance. The spell will relieve pain, it will not heal your reeth. \"Oh duch andre m're danda, tu na bares cingera! Na ava kiya mange, 12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"mire muy na hin kere! tut nikana me kamav, Ac tu mange pal paca; Kana e pcus yardakri eveltele panori!\" Money - A Constant Flow of Cash For this spell you will need to use two silver coins. These can be of any value and size, but they must be silver. Take a clear bowl of water and to this add some table salt. This will then become cleaning fluid (spiritually and physically). Into this bowl place your coins. Say: \"You I cleanse as you grow and make me rich.\" After two days take your coins out of the bowl. Go to the garden and dig a hole large enough to bury the coins in. If you do not have a garden then you must bury them in a park or anywhere there is soil. Once you have placed the coins in the hole pour some milk over them. The milk should be as fresh as possible. State your monetary desires. These can be anything from wanting the money for a new dress to wanting money for a brand new car! Once you have stated your desires aloud, cover the hole. Try to hide it as much as possible, so no-one will dig it up. As people walk over this place your money worries will vanish and cash will start to flow to you regularly. If you wish after six weeks you can dig up the coins and carry them with you at all times. But by that time you should have no money problems and be quite satisfied with your financial situation, so you can leave them in the ground. Material Obiects Here is a spell to acquire that long sought-after item, that previously you could never get your hands on. This spell is ideal for gaining an item that someone else will not give or sell. Take an apple, a picture of the desired item (you can draw this yourself if you wish), and two leaves from a willow tree. Go to your garden and dig a hole large enough to hold all these items. l3"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Place one of the willow leaves in the hole and state vour desired object. Say: \"By the power of this willow, (state object) will be mine.\" Take a bite of the apple, chew it and then swallow it. Say: \"By the power of this fruit, (state obiect) will be mine.\" Place the apple in the hole on top of the willow leaf. Now hold the picture of your desired object and say: \"I call upon the Pcuvuscheske, grant me my wish.\" Place the picture in the hole. On top of this place the other willow leaf. Say: \"Let my will be done, and not for the last time.\" Fill in the hole and cover it well, so no-one will know that the ground has been tampered with. Within a short time you will receive your desired object. Be open to all possibilities. You may receive it in a strange and unusual way. Talismanic \\Tealth The following talisman is ideal for bringing you material comforts of all kinds. \\7hen charging it keep in mind the type of wealth you want, or just think of all the good things in life as yours. It is fast and effective, and should be carried with you at all times. If it is possible you should try to draw the talisman on parchment paper. If this is unavailable then draw it on plain white paper, with blue ink. The talisman should be charged during the day. Try to charge it on a sunny day, as this is much more effective, for you are calling on the power of the sun God. After drawing the talisman prick your finger with a needle, and allow a few drops of blood to fall upon it. With both hands hold the talisman up towards the sun and mentally call on the power to enter the talisman through you. Feel the power running through your body and out your hands into the talisman before you. Call ;t\"ttiJi:#'Jff,Lfff llil??,l \"or have to wait ,oo ,o,,* berore you receive the wealth you seek. This wealth may start slowly at t4"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"first, but don't let this put you off. The talisman will keep work- ing for as long as it exists. It will constantly recharge itself. If you wish you can recharge it yourself every month with the same spell. Money Magnet This spell is designed so you can make yourself a money magnet. This magnet will attract money to you. Money is an energy and as energy flows, so you will be changing the direction of the flow, instead of more money going to the undeservia9, t little bit will go to you. For this spell you will need to use a silver coin of any value. Try to use one that is small, like a five pence piece, or twenty pence piece. As with the spell for constant cash, you will need a bowl of water into which you should put some salt. Wash the coin in this substance and dry it. Now take a green candle and inscribe on it the letters \"MMM\". Hold the candle and say: \"This candle will bring money to me from this day forth\". Now light the candle and let some wax fall on the coin. Quickly place the candle on top of the coin, so it is waxed there. You will need to keep an eye on the candle, as it burns, for it will not be totally stable because of the coin. This may cause the candle to fall and start a fire, so do be careful. Once the candle is stuck to the coin voice your monetary desires. Say: \"By the power of fire, by the vibrations of this candle, by the colour green, make me a magnet with the pull of the poles. As I will it, it is so. So mote it be.\" You have now constructed a money magnet. It will bring money to you often. \\flith the above spells you will find that everything you touch seems to turn to gold, as you gain the midas touch. Do not hoard your money. As we explained earlier, money is an energy. This energy should be allowed to flow through your life. By hoarding your wealth you will stop the flow, and you could lose everything you gained. So don't be afraid to spend money and enjoy yourself. 15"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Each incarnation is too short to worry about finances. A very good idea is to take some of the money you gained through magick, and give it to a charity. This is usually around ten per cent. Ecological groups are ideal to help, as they are trying to save this planet we all live on, and it is the earth spirits you are receiving the magical help from with the above spells. After the successful outcome of your spells, give thanks. Take some fruit or milk and give it to the soil. Dig a hole and put your offerings in it. This is great for the soil and it will please the earth spirits. This will make it much easier to gain their help again in the future. Take your time with the spells, don't rush them. This may discourage the earth spirits from helping you. Treat the spirits with respect and they will do likewise. Remember you are much more superior than these creatures, so use your intelligence to your advantage. Before ending the part of this book dealing with gypsy spells and incantations, we will give a gypsy talisman for second sight. The gypsies have been renowned through history for divinatory powers, and now you can be the same. Use their secret and see beyond normal vision. Divination Draw the talisman on parchment or, if unobtainable, ordinary white paper. Use black ink. Take the talisman in your hands and visualise a warm energy coming from it. Set it down and prick your finger with a needle. Allow a few drops of blood to fall on the paper. Now lift the talisman again. This time see a cool silver light all around it. Say: \"This talisman will give me second sight. It must be sott. Light a silver or white candle and place the talisman beside it. Leave the candle to burn down. Once it has gone out, take the talisman and place it somewhere safe. The first visions you start to receive may be confused. Don't try to strain too hard for explanations, these visions will clear with time, as you become accustomed to your new found powers. 16"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"PUBLISf,TER'S NOTE The three talismans mentioned here are illustrated on the front cover.

K.K. Receives Constant Cash K.K. was always in financial difficulties. He found himself in debt with almost everybody. Things got worse when he lost his job and it looked like he would have to go to jail if he could not pay his debts. Desperate, he turned to a money spell, feeling he had nothing at all to lose. He buried his silver coins at a crossroads he knew in the country and wished for a constant flow of cash. The next day he awoke, and to his surprise, found no cheque waiting for him. This left a heavy burden on his soul, so he decided to go for a walk. \\trflhile walking he came into contact with some old friends. They then asked him to dinner that night, this he accepted. \\fhile at dinner his friends told him that they had recently opened a new branch of their business and asked if he would be interested in managing it for them, as they wanted someone they trusted.

She approached her neighbour and asked if he would consider selling the bike, unfortunately the answer was no. Dawn decided to give herself a slight advantage, by using magick. She performed the spell for material objects. \\flithin two weeks her reluctant neighbour came to her offering to sell her the bike. For some reason, which Dawn says she herself cannot quite understand, she refused to buy the bike.

This ritual will need to be repeated on the following two Sundays of the month. On the last Sunday of this month, the ritual changes slightly. Take two orange candles and hold them to the rising sun while you intone: \"Oh mighty Ra, vibrate these candles with your power\". Light the candles and beside these place a fully peeled orange. Lift the orange and say: \"\\$7ith this I consume all that's thine. connect thine power with that of mine\". The spell is now complete and you should leave the candles to burn down.
