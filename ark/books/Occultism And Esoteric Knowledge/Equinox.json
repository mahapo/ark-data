This truth is of two orders: one, concerning Nature external to Man; two, concerning Nature internal to Man. Existing religions, especi ally Christianity, are based on primitive ignorance of the facts, particularly of external Nature. Celebrations must conform to the custom and nature of the people. Christianity has destroyed the joyful celebrations, characterised by music, dancing, feast ing and making love, and has kept only the melancholy. The Law of Thelema offers a religion which fulfills all necessary conditions. The philosophy and metaphysics of Thelema are sound, and offer a solution of the deepest problems of humanity. The science of Thelema is orthodox; is has no false theories of Nature, no false fables of the origin of things. The psychology and ethics of Thelema are perfect. It has destroyed the damnable delusion of Original Sin, making every one unique, independent, supreme and sufficient. The Law of Thelema is given in the Book of the Law [ Equinox I, VII and X]. The Equinox has been founded to promulgate and demonstrate this Law."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 10 The A ∴ A ∴ , or Great White Brotherhood, through Whom this Law was obtained, is a Body of the highest Initiates, pledged to aid mankind. It offers instruction in the Way of Spiritual Progress and Illumination to individual seekers. The work of the A ∴ A ∴ is called Scientific Illuminism. This may be briefly expressed by quoting Its motto: “The method of Scien ce: the aim of Religion.” Each seeker is taught how to realise Truth for himself, by means accurate and well - tested. The O.T.O. is the first of the great religious Societies to accept the Law. It trains groups by way of progressive initiation. The Equinox publishes all instructions and pronouncements of the A ∴ A ∴ and O.T.O. It also publishes such poetry, drama, fiction, and essays, as are sympathetic to this programme, so far as space permits. The Equinox is so called, firstly because it is the comment upon the Word of the New Æon, qelhma , which was given at th e Equinox of the Gods, when the Crowned and Conquering Child, Horus, took the place of the Dying God, Osiris. (The Equinox marks a period of a fresh influx of Force from our Father the SUN.) Secondly, in accordance with this, publication takes place at the Equinoxes of Spring and Autumn of each year. The rule of the A ∴ A ∴ is to alternate 5 years of silence with 5 years of speech. Hence publication has been from 1909 - 1914, An V - IX; and now from 1919 - 1924, An XV - XIX. Love is the law, love under will . "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 11 A ∴ A ∴ PRÆMONSTRANCE A MANIFESTO OF THE GREAT WHITE BROTHERHOOD Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law . The Præmonstrator of the A ∴ A ∴ wishes it to be known that the period of silence, which (according to the Rule of the Order) lasts during every alternate five years, will end at the Equinox of Spring in the year 1919 of the vulgar era. He wishes to call attention to the general principles of the Great White Brotherhood, which is also known as the A ∴ A ∴ . Primarily, this Body exists for the purpose of conferring Initiation. Secondarily, it prepares people for Initiat ion by means of courses of instruction. These courses are divided into two main parts, theoretical and practical. Information with regard to both these courses . The Order issues printed books of instruction. They cover the classics of all previous systems, and explain the particular system of A ∴ A ∴ . These instructions are issued in an extremely comprehensive and well - ordered form. Every instruction has been edited on strictly scientific lines. Students are thoroughly drilled in this work; examations take place regularly, and diplomas issued to th ose who pass them."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 12 The instruction of the A ∴ A ∴ is therefore as precise and definite as a University course. During the five years of speech from the Equinox of Spring 1909 of the vulgar era, 65 different books were issued, nearly all of these being printed in the 10 numbers of Volume I of the Equinox . Volume I of the Equinox is now very rare and expensive. Only a few sets remain; and these are valued at $ 100 per set. When these have been sold, it is proposed to re - publish the Official Instructions referred to above in separate form, for the benefit of those students who have been disappointed in obtaining sets of Volume I of the Equinox . The A ∴ A ∴ will publish a new volume of the Equinox in 10 numbers at intervals of six months, beginning with the Equinox of Spring (March 23 ) of the vulgar year of 1919. The principal items of the new promulgation are as follows: L IBER CCXX.

It is proposed to continue the same policy with regard to the new volume. Owing to the war, the cost of printing both for the paper required and the labour involved has gone up to an unprecedented degree, but the Præmonstr ator of the A ∴ A ∴ is determined that he will not allow these matters to interfere with his programme of putting out the Equinox in a style worthy of its contents. The new volume of ten numbers, averaging 400 pages, will not be inferior to the old in any way either with regard to paper or printing; that is to say, it will be produced in the best possible manner, and will be of permanent value for a library. The general appearance will be uniform with the last volume, but the binding will be of improved quality.

The grades themselves represent magical and mystical progress, corresponding to which will be grades of studentship representing intellectual progress , and an examination in each grade must be passed before the equivalent magical grade is officially conferred. It must be understood that the highest occult attainments are possible even to people who have no intellectual knowledge whatever. But this has been in the past a source of great iniquity, as it represents an overdevelopment of one organ of the Nature at the expense of others. It is the particular object of the A ∴ A ∴ to see to it that progress is orderly and thorough. It must further be stated that although certain books have been chosen for particular study, the student is not thereby absolved from the general study of all of them. For it is important to him to make from the beginning a comprehensive effort to understand the entire system, first, because it is desirable that he should choose his practices from the whole armoury at his disposal, and, also, because as he advances he must to be some extent familiar with all these practices, so that he may be fitted to instruct those entrusted to his guidance."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"CURRICULUM OF A ∴ A ∴ 19 COURSE I GENERAL READING S ECTION 1.

The Key to this Message is this word — Will. The first obvious meaning of this Law is confirmed by antithesis; “The Word of Sin is Restriction.” Again: “... thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that, and no other shall say nay. For pure will , unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.” Take this carefully; it seems to imply a theory that if every man and every woman did his and her will — the true Will — there would be no clashing. “Every man and every woman i s a star”, and each star moves in an appointed path without interference. There is plenty of room for all; it is only disorder that creates confusion. From these considerations it should be clear that “Do what thou wilt” does not mean “Do what you like.” I t is the apotheosis of Freedom; but it is also the strictest possible bond. Do what thou wilt — then do nothing else. Let nothing deflect thee from that austere and holy task.

Every act that is not in definite course of that one orbit is erratic, an hindrance. Will must not be two, but one. Note further that this will is not only to be pure, that is, single, as explained above, but also “unassuag ed of purpose”. This strange phrase must give us pause. It may mean that any purpose in the will would damp it; clearly, the “lust of result” is a thing from which it must be delivered. But the phrase may also be interpreted as if it read “with purpose un assuaged” — i.e . with tireless energy. The conception is, therefore, of an eternal motion, infinite and unalterable. It is Nirvana, only dynamic instead of static — and this comes to the same thing in the end. The obvious practical task of the magician is then to discover what his will really is, so that he may do it in this manner, and he can best accomplish this by the practices of Liber Thisharb (see Equinox I, VII, 105 ) or such others as may from one time to another be appointed. It should now be perfectly simple for everybody to understand the Message of the Master Therion. Thou must ( 1 ) Find out what is thy Will, ( 2 ) Do that Will with (a) one - pointedness, (b) detachment, (c) peace. Then, and then only, art thou in harmony with the Movement of Things, thy w ill part of, and therefore equal to, the Will of God. And since the will is but the dynamic aspect of the self, and since two different selves could not possess identical wills; then, if thy will be God’s will, Thou art That. There is but one other word to explain. Elsewhere it is written — surely for our great comfort — “Love is the law, love under will.”"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"LIBER II 43 This is to be taken as meaning that while Will is the Law, the nature of that Will is Love. But this Love is as it were a by - product of that Will; it does not contradict or supersede that Will; and if apparent contradiction should arise in any crisis, it is the Will that can guide us aright. Lo, while in the Book of the Law is much Love, there is no word of Sentimentality. Hate itself is almost like Love! Fighting most certainly is Love! “As brothers fight ye!” All the manly races of the world understand this. The Love of Liber Legis is always bold, virile, even orgiastic. There is delicacy, but it is the delicacy of strength. Mighty and terrible and glorious as it is, however, it is but the pennon upon the sacred lance of Will, the damascened inscription upon the swords of the Knight - Monks of Thelema.

And what are the conditions of this joy, and peace, and glory? Is ours the gloomy asceticism of the Christian, and the Buddhist, and the Hindu? Are we walking in eternal fear lest some “sin” should cut us off from “grace?” By no means. “Be goodly therefore: dress ye all in fine apparel; eat rich foods and drink sweet wines and wines that foam! Also, take your fill and will of love as ye will, when, where and with whom ye will! But always unto me.” This is the only point to bear in mind, that every act must be a ritual, an act of worship, a sacrament.

To me!” Again She speaks: “Love is the law, love under will.” Keep pure your highest ideal; strive ever toward it without allow ing aught to stop you or turn you aside, even as a star sweeps upon its incalculable and infinite course of glory, and all is Love. The Law of your being becomes Light, Life, Love and Liberty All is peace, all is harmony and beauty, all is joy. For hear, how gracious is the Goddess; “I give unimaginable joys on earth: certainty, not faith, while in life, upon death; peace unutterable, rest, ecstasy; nor do I demand aught in sacrifice.” Is this not better than the death - in - life of the slaves of Slave - Gods, as they go oppressed by consciousness of “sin,” wearily seeking or simulating wearisome and tedious “virtues”? With such, we who have accepted the Law of Thelema have nothing to do. We have heard the Voice of the Star - Goddess: “I love you! I yearn to yo u! Pale or purple, veiled or voluptuous, I who am all pleasure and purple, and drunkenness of the innermost sense, desire you.

He is eternal energy, the Infinite Motion of Thing, the central core of all being. The manifested Universe comes from the marriange of Nuit and Hadit; without this could no thing be. This eternal, this perpetual marriage - feast is then the nature of things themselves; and therefore everything that is, is a crystallization of divine ecstasy. Hadit telles us of Himself “I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star.” He is then your own inmost divine self; it is you, and not another, who are lost in the constant rapture of the embraces of Infinite Beauty. A little further on He speaks of us: “We are not for the poo r and the sad: the lords of the earth are our kinsfolk.” “Is God to live in a dog? No! but the highest are of us. They shall rejoice, our chosen: who sorroweth is not of us.” “Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, force and fire, a re of us.” Later, concerning death, He says: “Think not, o king, upon that lie: That Thou Must Die: verily thou shalt not die, but live. Now let is be understood: If the body of the King dissolve, he shall remain in pure ecstasy for ever.” When you know that, what is left but delight? And how are we to live meanwhile? “It is a lie, this folly against self.” [...] “Be strong, o man! lust, enjoy all things of sense and rapture: fear not that any God shall deny thee for this.”"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"LIBER DCCCXXXVII 51 Again and again, in words like these, He sees the expansion and the development of the soul through joy. Here is the Calendar of our Church: “But ye, o my people, rise up & awake! Let the rituals be rightly performed with joy and beauty!” Remember that all acts of love and pleasure ar e rituals, must be rituals. “There are rituals of the elements and feasts of the times. A feast for the first night of the Prophet and his Bride! A feast for the three days of the writing of the Book of the Law. A feast for Tahuti and the child of the Prophet — secret, O Prophet! A feast for the Supreme Ritual, and feast for the Equinox of the Gods. A feast for fire and a feast for water; a feast for life and a greater feast for death! A feast every day in your hearts in the joy of my rapture! A feast every night unto Nu, and the pleasure of uttermost delight! Aye! feast! rejoice! there is no dread hereafter. There is the dissolution, and eternal ecstasy in the kisses of Nu.” It all depends on you own acceptance of this new law, and you are not aske d to believe anything, to accept a string of foolish fables beneath the intellectual level of a Bushman and the moral level of a drug - fiend. All you have to do is to be yourself, to do your will, and to rejoice. “Dost thou fail? Art thou sorry?

Whosover knows any member of that Order as such, can never know another, until he too has attained to mastery. Here, therefore, we pause, that you may thoroughly sear ch yourself, and consider if you are yet fitted to take an irrevocable step. For the reading of that which follows is Recorded. THE HISTORY LECTION 7 . Some years ago a number of cipher MSS. were discovered and deciphered by certain students. They attra cted much attention, as they purported to derive from the Rosicrucians. You will readily understand that the genuineness of the claim matters no whit, such literature being judged by itself, not by its reputed sources. 8 . Among the MSS. was one which gav e the address of a certain person in Germany, who is known to us as S.D.A. Those who discovered the ciphers wrote to S.D.A., and in accordance with instructions received, an Order was founded which worked in a semi - secret manner. 9 . After some time S.D.A . died: further requests for help were met with a prompt refusal from the colleages of S.D.A. It was written by one of them that S.D.A.’s scheme had always been regarded with disapproval. But since the absolute rule of the adepts is never to interfere with the judgements of any other person whomsoever – how much more, then, one of themselves, and that one most highly revered! – they had refrained from active opposition. The adept who wrote this added that the Order had already quite"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"LIBER LXI 57 enough knowledge to enab le it or its members to formulate a magical link with the adepts. 10 . Shortly after this, one called S.R.M.D. announced that he had formulated such a link, and that himself and two others were to govern the Order. New and revised rituals were issued, and f resh knowledge poured out in streams. 11 . We must pass over the unhappy juggleries which characterised the next period. It has throughout proved impossible to elucidate the complex facts. We content ourselves, then, with observing that the death of one of his two colleages, and the weakness of the other, secured to S.R.M.D. the sole authority. The rituals were elaborated, though scholarly enough, into verbose and pretentious nonsense: the knowledge proved worthless even where it was correct: for it is in va in that pearls, be they never to clear and precious, are given to the swine. The ordeals were turned into contempt, it being impossible for anyone to fail therein. Unsuitable candidates were admitted for no better reason than that of their worldly prosperi ty. In short, the Order failed to initiate. 12 . Scandal arose, and with it schism. 13 . In 1900 , one P., a brother, instituted a rigorous test of S.R.M.D. on the one side and the Order on the other. 14 . He discovered that S.R.M.D., though a scholar of some ability and a magician of remarkable powers, had never attained complete initiation: and further had fallen from his original place, he having imprudently attracted to himself forces of evil too great and terrible for him to withstand."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 58 The claim of the Ord er that the true adepts were in charge of it was definitely disproved. 15 . In the Order, with two certain exceptions and two doubtful ones, he found no persons prepared for initiation of any sort. 16 . He thereupon by his subtle wisdom destroyed both the Or der and its chief. 17 . Being himself no perfect adept, he was driven of the Spirit into the Wilderness, where he abode for six years, studying by the light of reason the sacred books and secret systems of all countries and ages. 18 . Finally, there was give n unto him a certain exalted grade whereby a man becomes master of knowledge and intelligence, and no more their slave. He perceived the inadequacy of science, philosophy, and religion; and exposed the self - contradictory nature of the thinking faculty. 19 . Returning to England, he laid his achievements humbly at the feet of a certain adept D.D.S., who welcomed him brotherly and admitted his title to the grade which he had so hardly won. 20 . Thereupon these two adepts conferred together, saying: May it not b e written that the tribulations shall be shortened? Wherefore they resolved to establish a new Order which should be free from the errors and deceits of the former one. 21 . Without Authority they could not do this, exalted as their rank was among adepts. T hey resolved to prepare all things, great and small, against that day when such Authority should be received by them, since they knew not where to seek for higher adepts than themselves, but knew that the"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"LIBER LXI 59 true way to attract the notice of such was to equil ibrate the symbols. The temple must be builded before the God can indwell it. 22 . Therefore by the order of D.D.S. did P. prepare all things by his arcane science and wisdom, choosing only those symbols which were common to all systems, and rigorously reje cting all names and words which might be supposed to imply any religious or metaphysical theory. To do this utterly was found impossible, since all language has a history, and the use (for example) of the word “spirit” implies the Scholastic Philosophy and the Hindu and Taoist theories concerning the breath of man. So was it difficult to avoid implication of some undesirable bias by using the words “order,” “circle,” “chapter,” “society,” “brotherhood,” or any other to designate the body of initates. 23 . De liberately, therefore, idid he take refuge in vagueness. Not to veil the truth to the Neophyte, but to warn him against valuing non - essentials. Should therefore the candidate hear the name of any God, let him not rashly assume that it refers to any known G od, save only the God known to himself. Or should the ritual speak in terms (however vague) which seem to imply Egyptian, Taoist, Buddhist, Indian, Persian, Greek, Judaic, Christian or Moslem philosophy, let him reflect that this is a defect of language, t he literary limitation and not the spiritual prejudice of the man P. 24 . Especially let him guard against the finding of definite sectarian symbols in the teaching of his master, and the reasoning from the known to the unknown which assuredly will tempt hi m."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 60 We labour earnestly, dear brother, that you may never be led away to perish upon this point; for thereon have many holy and just men been wrecked.

Now when P. had thus with bitter toil prepared all things under the guidance of D.D.S. (even as the hand writes, while the conscious brain, though ignorant of the detailed movements, applauds or disapproves the finished work) the re was a certain period of repose, as the earth lieth fallow. 26 . Meanwhile these adepts busied themselves intently with the Great Work. 27 . In the fullness of time, even as a blossoming tree that beareth fruit in its season, all these pains were ended, an d these adepts and their companions obtained the reward which they had sought — they were to be admitted to the Eternal and Invisible Order that hath no name among men. 28 .

Let me then declare unto you the Mystery of t his Law, as it hath been made known unto me in divers places, upon the mountains and in the deserts, but also in great cities, which thing I speak unto you for your comfort and good courage. And so be it unto all of you. Know first, that from the Law spri ng four Rays or Emanations: so that if the Law be the centre of your own being, they must needs fill you with their secret goodness.

By Life therefore are you made yourselves, eternal an d incorruptible, flaming forth as suns, self - created and self - supported, each the sole centre of the Universe. Now by the Light ye beheld, by Love ye feel. There is an ecstacy of pure Knowledge, and another of pure Love. And this Love is the force that u niteth things diverse, for the contemplation in Light of their Oneness. Know that the Universe is not at rest, but in extreme motion whose sum is Rest. And this understanding that Stability is Change, and Change Stability, that Being is Becoming, and Bec oming Being, is the Key to the Golden Palace of this Law. Lastly, by Liberty is the power to direct your course according to your Will.

Yet all four gifts of the Law must in some degree be exercised, seeing that these four are one. But for the Aspirant that cometh unto the Master, the first need is freedom. The great bond of all bonds is ignorance. How shall a man be free to act if he know not his own purpose ? You must therefore first of all discover which star of all the stars you are, your relation to the other stars about you, and your relation to, and identity with, the Whole. In our Holy Books are given sundry means of making this discovery, and each mus t make it for himself, attaining absolute conviction by direct experience, not merely reasoning and calculating what is probably.

Understand clearly this: that if you are sure of your Will, and sure of your means, then any thoughts or actions wh ich are contrary to those means are contrary also to that Will. If therefore the Master should enjoin upon you a Vow of Holy Obedience, compliance is not a surrender of the Will, but a fulfilment thereof. For see, what hindereth you? It is either from wit hout or from within, or both. It may be easy for the strong - minded seeker to put his heel upon public opinion, or to tear from his heart the objects which he loves, in a sense: but there will always remain in himself many discordant affections, as also th e bond of habit, and these also must he conquer. In our holiest Book it is written: “Thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that, and no other shall say nay.” Write it also in your heart and in your brain: for this is the key of the whole matter.

By this we understand that the Universal Will is of the nature of Love. Now Love is the enkindling in ecstasy of Two that will to become One. It is thus an Universal formula of High Magick. For see now how all things , being in sorrow caused by dividuality, must of necessity will Oneness as their medicine. Here also is Nature monitor to them that seek Wisdom at her breast: for in the uniting of elements to opposite polarities is there a glory of heat, of light, and of electricity. Thus also in mankind do we behold the spritual fruit of poetry and all genius, arising from the seed of what is but an animal gesture, in the estimation of such as are schooled in Philosophy. And it is to be noted strongly that the most viol ent and divine passions are those between people of utterly unharmonious natures. But now I would have you know that in the mind are no such limitations in respect of species as prevent a man falling in love with an inanimate object, or an idea. For to hi m that is in any wise advanced upon the Way of Meditation it appears that all objects save the One Object are distasteful, even as appeared formerly in respect of his chance wishes to the Will. So therefore all objects must be grasped with the mind, and h eated in the sevenfold furnace of Love, until with explosion of ecstasy they unite, and disappear, for they, being imperfect, are destroyed utterly in the creation of the Perfection of Union, even as the persons of the Lover and the Beloved are fused into the spiritual gold of Love, which knoweth no person, but comprehendeth all. Yet since each star is but one star, and the coming together of any two is but one partial rapture, so must the aspirant to"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"LIBER CL 109 our holy Science and Art increase constantly by this met hod of assimilating ideas, that in the end, become capable of apprehending the Universe in one thought, he may leap forth upon It with the massed violence of his Self, and destroying both these, become that Unity whose name is No Thing. Seek ye all theref ore constantly to unite yourselves in rapture with each and every thing that is, and that by utmost passion and lust of Union. To this end take chiefly all such things as are naturally repulsive. For what is pleasant is assimilated easily and without ecs tasy: it is in the transfiguration of the loathsome and abhorred into The Beloved that the Self is shaken to the root in Love. Thus in human love also we see that mediocrities among men mate with null women: but History teacheth us that the supreme masters of the world seek ever the vilest and most horrible creatures for their concubines, overstepping even the limitig laws of sex and species in their necessity to transcend normality. It is not enough in such natures to excite lust or passion: the imaginati on itself must be inflamed by every means. For us, then, emancipated from all base law, what shall we do to satisfy our Will to Unity? No less a mistress than the Universe: no lupanar more cramped than Infinite Space: no night of rape that is not coeval w ith Eternity! Consider that as Love is mighty to bring forth all Ecstasy, so absence of Love is the greatest craving. Whoso is balked in Love sufereth indeed, but he that hath not actively that passion in his heart towards some object is weary with the ac he of craving. And this state is called mystically “Dryness.” For this there is, as I believe, no cure but patient persistence in a Rule of Life."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 110 But this Dryness hath its virtue, in that thereby the soul is purged of those things that impreach the Will: for when the drouth is altogether perfect, then it is certain that by no means can the Soul be satisfied, save by the Accomplishment of the Great Work. And this is in strong souls a stimulus to the Will. It is the Furnace of Thirst that burneth up all d ross within us. But to each act of Will is a particular Dryness corresponding: and as Love increaseth within you, so does the torment of His absence. Be this also unto you for a consolation in the ordeal! Moreover, the more fierce the plague of impotence , the more swiftly and suddenly is it wont to abate. Here is the method of Love in Meditation. Let the Aspirant first practice and then discipline himself in the Art of fixing the attention on any thing whatsoever at will, without permitting the least ima ginable distraction. Let him also practice the art of the Analysis of Ideas, and that of refusing to allow the mind its natural reaction to them, pleasant or unpleasant, thus fixing himself in Simplicity and Indifference. These things being achieved in th eir ripe season, be it known to you that all ideas will have become equal to your apprehension, since each is simple and each indifferent: any one of them remaining in the mind at Will with out stirring or striving, or tending to pass on to any other. But each idea will possess one special quality common to all : this , that no one of any of them is The Self , inasmuch as it is perceived by The Self as Something Opposite . When this is thorough and profound in the impact of its realization, then is the moment f or the aspirant to direct his Will to Love upon it, so that his whole consciousness findeth"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"LIBER CL 111 focus upon that One Idea. And at the first it may be fixed and dead, or lightly held. This may then pass into dryness, or into repulsion. Then at last by pure pe rsistence in that Act of Will to Love, shall Love himself arise, as a bird, as a flame, as a song, and the whole Soul shall wing a fiery path of music unto the Ultimate Heaven of Possession. Now in this method there are many roads and ways, some simple and direct, some hidden and mysterious, even as it is with human love whereof no man hath made so much as the first sketches for a Map: for Love is infinite in diversity even as are the Stars. For this cause do I leave Love himself master in the heart of ever y one of you: for he shall teach you rightly if you but serve him with diligence and devotion even to abandonment. Nor shall you take umbrage at the strange pranks that he shall play: for He is a wayward boy and wanton, wise in the Wiles of Aphrodite Our L ady His sweet Mother: and all His jests and cruelties are spices in a confection cunning as no art may match. Rejoice therefore in all His play, not remitting in any wise your own ardour, but glowing with the sting of His whips, and making of Laughter itse lf a sacrament adjuvant to Love, even as in the Wine of Rheims is sparkle and bite, like as they were ministers to the High Priest of Intoxication. It is also fit that I write to you of the importance of Purity in Love. Now this matter concerneth not in a ny wise the object or the method of the practice: the one thing essential is that no alien element should intrude. And this is of most particular pertinence to the aspirant in that primary and mundane aspect of his work wherein he establisheth himself in the method through his natural affections."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 112 For know, that all things are masks or symbols of the One Truth, and nature serveth alway to point out the higher perfection under the veil of the lower perfection. So then all the Art and Craft of human love sha ll serve you as an hieroglyphic: for it is written that That which is above is like that which is below: and That which is below is like that which is above. Therefore also doth it behoove you to take well heed lest in any manner you fail in this business of purity. For though each act is to be complete on its own plane, and no influence of any other plane is to be brought in for interference or admixture, for that such is all impurity, yet each act should in itself be so complete and perfect that it is a mirror of the perfection of every plane, and thereby becometh partaker of the pure Light of the highest. Also, since all acts are to be acts of Will in Freedom on every plane, all planes are in reality but one: and thus the lowest expression of any functi on of that Will is to be at the same time an expression of the highest Will, or only true Will, which is that already implied in the acceptance of the Law. Be it also well understood that it is not necessary or right to shut off natural activity of any kin d, as certain false folk, eunuchs of the spirit, most foully teach, to the destruction of many. For in every thing soever inhereth its own perfection proper to it, and to neglect the full operation and function of any one part bringeth distortion and dege neration to the whole. Act therefore in all ways, but transforming the effect of all these ways to the One Way of the Will. And this is possible, because all ways are in actual Truth One Way, the Universe being itself One and One Only, and its appearance as Multiplicity that cardinal illusion which it is the very object of Love to dissipate."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"LIBER CL 113 In the achievement of Love are two principles, that of mastering, and that of yielding. But the nature of these is hard to explain, for they are subtle, and are best taught by Love Himself in the course of the Operations. But it is to be said generally that the choice of one formula or the other is automatic, being the work of that inmost Will which is alive within you. Seek not then to determine consciously this de cision, for herein true instinct is not liable to err. But now I end, without further words: for in our Holy Books are written many details of the actual practices of Love. And those are the best and truest which are most subtly written in symbol and imag e, especially in Tragedy and Comedy, for the whole nature of these things is in this kind, Life itself being but the fruit of the flower of Love. It is then of Life that I must needs now write to you, seein that by every act of Will in Love you are creatin g it, a quintessence more mysterious and joyous than you deem, for this which men call life is but a shadow of that true Life, your birthright, and the gift of the Law of Thelema. III OF LIFE S YSTOLE AND DIASTOLE : these are the phases of all component th ings. Of such also is the life of man. Its curve arises from the latency of the fertilized ovum, say you, to a zenith whence it declines to the nullity of death? Rightly considered, this is not wholly truth. The life of man is but one segment of a serp entine curve which reaches out to infinity, and its zeros but mark the changes from the plus to minus, and minus to plus, coefficients of its equation. It is"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 114 for this cause, among many others, that wise men in old time chose the Serpent as the Hieroglpyh of Life. Life then is indestructible as all else is. All destruction and construction are changes in the nature of Love, as I have written to you in the former chapter proximate. Yet even as the blood in one pulse - throb of the wrist is not the same blood as that in the next, so individuality is in part destroyed as each life passeth; nay, even with every thought. What then maketh man, if he dieth and is reborn a changeling with each breath? This: the consciousness of continuity given by memory, the conce ption of his Self as something whose existence, far from being threatened by these changes, is in verity assured by them. Let then the aspirant to the sacred Wisdom consider his Self no more as one segment of the Serpent, but as the whole. Let him extend his consciousness to regard both birth and death as incidents trivial as systole and diastole of the heart itself, and necessary as they to its function. To fix the mind in this apprehension of Life, two modes are preferred, as preliminary to the greater realizations to be discussed in their proper order, experiences which transcend even those attainments of Liberty and Love of which I have hitherto written, and this of Life which I now inscribe in this my little book which I am making for you so that you may come unto the Great Fulfilment. The first mode is the acquisition of the Magical Memory so - called, and the means is described with accuracy and clearness in certain of our Holy Books. But for nearly all men this is found to be a practice of exceeding difficulty. Let then the aspirant follow the impulse of his own Will in the decision to choose this or no."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"LIBER CL 115 The second mode is easy, agreeable, not tedious, and in the end as certain as the other. But as the way of error in the former lieth in Discouragem ent, so in the latter are you to be ware of False Paths. I may say indeed generally of all Works, that there are two dangers, the obstacle of Failure, and the snare of Success. Now this second mode is to dissociate the beings which make up your life. Fir stly, because it is easiest, you should segragate that Form which is called the Body of Light (and also by many other names) and set yourself to travel in this Form, making systematic exploration of those worlds which are to other material things what your own Body of Light is to your own material form. Now it will occur to you in these travels that you come to many Gates which you are not able to pass. This is because your Body of Light is itself as yet not strong enough, or subtle enough, or pure enough: and you must then learn to dissociate the elements of that body by a process similar to the first, your consciousness remaining in the higher and leaving the lower. In this practice do you continue, bending your Will like a great Bow to drive the Arrow o f your consciousness through heavens ever higher and holier. But the continuance in this Way is itself of vital value: for it shall be that presently habit herself shall persuade you that the body which is born and dieth within so little a space as one cy cle of Neptune in the Zodiac is no essential of your Self, that the Life of which you are become partaker, while itself subject ot the Law of action and reaction, ebb and flow, systole and diastole, is yet insensible to the afflications of that life which you formerly held to be your sole bond with existence."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 116 And here must you resolve your Self to make the mightiest endeavours: for so flowered are the meadows of this Eden, and so sweet the fruit of its orchards, that you will love to linger among them, and to take delight in sloth and dalliance therein. Therefore I write to you with energy that these enjoyments are dependent upon duality, so that their true name is Sorrow of Illusion, like that of the normal life of man, which you have set out to transcend. Be it according to your Will, but learn this, that (as it is written) they only are happy who have desired the unattainable. It is then best, ultimately, if it be your Will to find alway your chiefest pleasure in Love, that is, in Conquest, and in Death, that is, in Surrender, as I have written to you already. Thus then you shall delight in these delights aforesaid, but only as toys, holding your manhood firm and keen to pierce to deeper and holier ecstasies without arrest of Will. Furthermore, I would h ave you to know that in this practice, pursued with ardour unquenchable, is this especial grace, that you will come as it were by fortune into states which transcend the practice itself, being of the nature of those works of Pure Light of which I will writ e to you in the chapter following after this. For there be certain Gates which no being who is still conscious of dividuality, that is, of the Self and not - Self as opposites, may pass through: and in the storming of those Gates by fiery assault of lust ce lestial, your flame will burn vehemently against your gross Self, though it be already divine beyond your present imagining, and devour it in a mystical death, so that in the Passing of the Gate all is dissolved in formless Light of Unity."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"LIBER CL 117 Now then, return ing from these states of being, and in the return also there is a Mystery of Joy, you will be weaned from the Milk of Darkness of the Moon, and made partaker of the Sacrament of Wine that is the blood of the Sun. Yet at the first there may be shock and co nflict, for the old thought persists by force of its habit: it is for you to create by repeated act the true right habit of this consciousness of the Life which abideth in Light. And this is easy, if your will be strong: for the true Life is no much more vivid and quintessential than the false that (as I rudely estimate) one hour of the former makes an impression on the memory equal to one year of the latter. One single experience, in duration it may be but a few seconds of terrestrial time, is sufficient to destroy the belief in the reality of our vain life on earth: but this wears gradually away if the consciousness, through shock or fear, adhere not to it, and the Will strive not continually to repetition of that bliss, more beautiful and terrible than death, which it hath won by virtue of Love. There be moreover many other modes of attaining the apprehension of true Life, and these two following are of much value in breaking up the ice of your mortal error in the vision of your being. And of these the first is the constant contemplation of the Identity of Love and Death, and the understanding of the dissolution of the body as an Act of Love done upon the Body of the Universe, as also it is written at length in our Holy Books. And with this goeth, as it were sister with twin brother, the practice of mortal love as a sacrament symbolical of that great Death: as it is written “Kill thyself”: and again “Die daily.” And the second of these lesser modes is the practice of the mental apprehension and analysis of ideas, mainly as I have already taught you, but with especial empahsis in choice of"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 118 things naturally repulsive, in particular death itself, and its phenomena ancillary. Thus the Buddha bade his disciples to meditate upon Ten Impurities, that is, upon t en cases of death or decomposition, so that the Aspirant, identifying himself with his own corpse in all these imagined forms, might lose the natural horror, loathing, fear or disgust which he might have had for them. Know this, that every idea of every s ort becomes unreal, phantastic, and most manifest illusion, if it be subjected to persistent investigation, with concentration. And this is particularly easy to attain in the case of all bodily impressions, because all material things, and especially thos e of which we are first conscious, namely, our own bodies, are the grossest and most unnatural of all falsities. For there is in us all, latent, that Light wherein no error may endure, and It already teaches our instinct to reject first of all those veils which are most closely wrapt about It. Thus also in meditation it is (for many men) most profitable to concentrate the Will to Love upon the sacred centres of nervous force: for they, like all things, are apt images or true reflexions of their semblances in finer spheres: so that, their gross images being dissipated by the dissolving acid of the Meditation, their finer souls appear (so to speak) naked, and display their force and glory in the consciousness of the aspirant.

In this Light naught exists, for It is homogeneous: and therefore have men called it Silence, and Darkness, and Nothing. But in this, as in all other e ffort to name it, is the root of every falsity and misapprehension, since all words imply some duality.

All these Books also concern all these Four Gifts, for in the end you will see that every one is inseparable from every other. I wish to write to you with regard to the number 93 , the number of Qelhma . For it is not only the number of its interpretation Agaph , but also that of a Word unknown to you unless you be Neophyte of our Holy Order of the A ∴ A ∴ which word representeth in its elf the arsing of the Speech from the Silence, and the return thereunto in the End."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 122 Now the number 93 is thrice 31 , which is in Hebrew LA, that is to say NOT, and so it denieth extension in the three dimensions of Space. Also I would have you to meditate closely upon the name NU that is 56 , which we are told to divide, add, multiply, and understand. By division cometh forth 0.12 , as if it were written Nuith! Hadith! Ra - Hoor - Khuith! before the Dyad. By addition ariseth Eleven, the number of True Magick: and by multiplication Three Hundred, the Number of the Holy Spirit or Fire, the letter Shin, wherein all things are consumed utterly. With these considerations, and a full understanding of the mysteries of the Number 666 and 418 , you will be armed mightil y in this Way of far flight. But you should also consider all numbers in their scales. For there is no means of resolution better than this of pure mathematics, since already therein are gross ideas made fine, and all is ordered and ready for the Alchemy of the Great Work. I have already written to you of how, in the Will of Love, Light ariseth as the secret part of Life. And in the first, the little, Loves, the attained Life is still personal: later, it becometh impersonal and universal. Now then is Wi ll arrived, may I say so, at its magnetic pole, whence the lines of force point alike every way and no way: and Love also is no more a work, but a state. These qualities are become part of the Universal Life, which proceedeth infinitely with the enjoyment of the Will, and of Love as inherent therein. These things therefore, in their perfection, have lost their names, and their natures. Yet these were the Substance of Life, its Father and Mother: and without their operation and impact Life itself will gra dually cease its pulsations. But since the infinite energy of the whole Universe is therein, what then is possible but that it return to its own First"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"LIBER CL 123 Intention, dissolving itself little by little into that Light which is its most secret and most subtle N ature? For this Universe is in Truth Zero, being an equation whereof Zero is the sum. Whereof this is the proof, that if not, it would be unbalanced, and something would have come from Nothing, which is absurd. This Light or Nothing is then the Resultant or Totality thereof in pure Perfection; and all other states, positive or negative, are imperfect, since they omit their opposites. Yet, I would have you consider that this equality or identity of equation between all things and No thing is most absolute, so that you will remain no more in one than you did in the other. And you will understand this greatest Mystery very easily in the light of those other experiences which you have enjoyed, wherein motion and rest, change and stability, and many other subt le opposites, have been redeemed to identity by the force of your holy meditation. The greatest gift of the Law, then, cometh forth by the most perfect practice of the Three Lesser Gifts. And so thoroughly must you travail in this Work that you are able t o pass from one side of the equation to the other at will: nay, to comprehend the whole at once, and for ever. Thus then your time - and - space - bound soul shall travel according to its nature in its orbit, revealing the Law to them that walk in chains, for t hat this is your particular function. Now here is the Mystery of the Origin of Evil. Firstly, by Evil we mean that which is in opposition to our own wills: it is therefore a relative, and not an absolute, term. For everything which is the greatest evil o f some one is the greatest good of some other, just as the hardness of the wood"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 124 which wearieth the axeman is the safety of him that ventureth himself upon the sea in a ship built of that wood. And this is a truth easy to apprehend, being superficial, and intelligible to the common mind. All evil is thus relative, or apparent, or illusory: but, returning to philosophy, I will repeat that its root is always in duality. Therefore the escape from this apparent evil is to seek the Unity, which you shall do as I have already shewn you. But I will make mention of that which is written concerning this in The Book of the Law . The first step being Will, Evil appears as by this definition, “all that hinders the execution of the Will.” Therefore is it written: “The word of Sin is Restriction.” It should also be noted that in The Book of the Thirty Æthyrs Evil appears as Choronzon whose number is 333, which in Greek importeth Impotence and Idleness: and the nature of Choronzon is Dispersion and Incoherence. Then in the Way of Love Evil appears as “all that which tends to prevent the Union of any two things. “ Thus The Book of the Law sayeth, under the figure of the Voice of Nuit: “take your fill and will of love as ye will, when, where, and with whom ye will! But a lways unto me.” For every act of Love must be “under will,” that is, in accordance with the True Will, which is not to rest content with things partial and transitory, but to proceed firmly to the End. So also, in The Book of the Thirty Æthyrs , the Black Brothers are those who shut themselves up, unwilling to destroy themselves by Love. Thirdly, in the Way of Life Evil appears under a subtler form as “all that which is not impersonal and universal.” Here The Book of the Law , by the Voice of Hadit, inform eth us:"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"LIBER CL 125 “In the sphere I am everywhere the centre...” And again: “I am Life and the giver of Life ... ‘Come unto me’ is a foolish word: for it is I that go. ... For I am perfect, being Not.” For this Life is in every place and time at once, so that in It these limitations no longer exist. And you will have seen this for yourself, that in every act of Love time and space disappear with the creation of the Life by its virtue, as doth also personality itself. For the third time, then, in even subtler sense, “The word of Sin is Restriction” Lastly, in the Way of Light this same versicle is the key to the conception of Evil. But here Restriction is in the failure to solve the Great Equation, and, later, to prefer one expression or phase of the Universe to another. Against this we are warned in The Book of the Law by the Word of Nuit, saying: “None ... and two. For I am divided for love’s sake, for the chance of union”, and therefore, “If this be not aright: if ye confound the space marks, saying, They are many ... th en expect the direful judgements ...” Now therefore by the favour of Thoth am I come to the end of this my book: and do you arm yourselves accordingly with the Four Weapons: the Wand for Liberty, the Cup for Love, the Sword for Life, the Disk for Light: and with these work all wonders by the Art of High Magick under the Law of the New Æon, whose Word is Qelhma ."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 126 A PSALM The Lord hath brought me into the House of Darkness; by stealth hath the Lord drawn me into Night.

V., having only escaped becoming an April Fool by delaying a day to summon up enough courage to turn out once more into this cold and uninviting World. Having been oiled, smacked and allowed to live, we shall trouble no further about the details of his career until 1906 , when, having reached the age of 20 years, he began to turn his attention toward the Mysteries, and to investigate Spiritualism, chiefly with the ide a of disproving it. From this year his interest in the Occult seems to date, and it was about this time that he first consciously aspired to find, and get into touch with, a True Occult Order. This aspiration was, as we shall see, fulfilled three years la ter, when he had an opportunity to become a Probationer of the A ∴ A ∴ , and immediately grasped it; but during those three years his researches led him into varied paths: Spiritualism, Faithism and other Isms on the one hand, and “The Europe,” “The Leicester, ” and “The Cosy Corner” on the other: last, but not least, into Marriage, a difficult thing to put on one side and perhaps best left on the other. Having then plunged wholeheartedly into this final experiment,"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 130 becoming as it were “Omnia in Uno” for a time , he emerged in a frame of mind well suited to the study of Scientific Illuminism, of which he was much in need, and, having signed the Probationer’s Pledge Form on December 24 th, 1909 , E.V., he took — after careful thought — the Motto “Unus in Omnibus” and ha s been riding very comfortably ever since. From this time onward, according to the Rules of the Order, he began keeping a written record of his Work, and this makes our task easier; but since he himself became more serious from that moment, we must to a ce rtain extent follow his example and treat what is recorded as the attempt of a struggling soul to obtain Light for himself and others. Whatever his mistakes, however poor his results, or laughable his failures, there is this much to be said for him, that h e never turned back. Section II December 24 , 1909 , to May 14 , 1910 Frater V.I.O. started off bravely enough. As soon as he had read the first number of The Equinox, and before he got into touch with any Member of the A ∴ A ∴ he made an attempt at Asana. The earliest record I can find reads as follows: Thursday, Nov. 4th, 1909 . 11 : 20 P . M . to 11 : 41 P . M . Asana. Position I. The God. Inclination for back to bend, just above hips, had to straighten up several times. Opened eyes once and moved head, after about f ive minutes.

He h oped to do 60 minutes next time. But he does not appear to have done so, for after signing his Probationer’s Oath on December 24 th I find no record till January 11 th, 1910 , E.V., the day he received his first written instructions from his Neophyte, Frater P.A. As those instructions represent the basis upon which he worked for a considerable period, I shall include them here, in spite of the fact that it may have been out of order for him to work on definite instructions at all, since the Probationer is su pposed to choose for himself those practices which please him best, and to experiment therewith for himself. Since however he did not know this at the time, he cannot be blamed for doing his best along the lines laid down by his Neophyte. 1 In any case he might have done far worse than to strive to carry out these few simple rules which are as follows: THE RULES 1 . Ever be moderate and follow the middle path; rather be the tortoise than the hare; do not rush wildly into anything; but do not abandon what y ou have taken up, without much forethought. 2 . Always keep your body and mind in a healthy and fit condition; and never carry out an exercise, whether mental or physical, when you are fatigued. 3 . In an ideal country the hours in which to practice are: at sunrise, sunset, noon and midnight (and always before a meal never immediately after one).    1 It is presumptuous for a Neophyte to lay down rules; for (a) he cannot possibly know what his Probationer needs, having no record to guide him; (b) the Probationer’s task is to expl ore his own nature, not to follow any prescribed course. A third objection is that by putting the Probationer in Corsets, an entirely flabby person may sneak through his year, and become a Neophyte, to the shame of the Order. But this objection is theoreti cal; for Initiation is overseen from the Third Order, where no Error may endure. — O.M."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 132 As this cannot be done with comfort, in this country (England), let your chief practice take place an hour or half an hour before your breakfast hour. 4 . If possibl e set apart a room wherein to carry out your exercises; keep it clean, and only keep in it objects which please you; burn a little incense in the room before beginning an exercise; keep the room holy to yourself, and do not allow yourself or another to do anything unbalanced in thought or action in it. In will and deed make this room a temple and a symbol of that greater Temple which is your HIGHER SELF. THE EXERCISES The First Exercise Rise to time, and without undue haste, wash and dress, robe yourself an d enter the room you have set apart; burn a little incense and turning to the East repeat some simple orison such as: “May the light of Adonai arise within me, may it guide me through this day and be as a lamp to lighten my darkness.” Then make a general c onfession, as shortly as possible, of your last day’s work and enter it in your diary, after which sit down in a comfortable position and do the following. With your hands upon your knees and your head straight, take in a breath in measured time inwards an d concentrate the whole of your thought on that breath as it flows into your lungs, cutting away all other thoughts that may arise at the time; then exhale the breath, still keeping your thought fixed on it. Do this for some ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and mark down in your diary the number of “breaks,” or any result. The whole of this practice must be performed rhythmically and harmoniously. The Second Exercise As the rush of daily work tends to undo what the morning exercise has done, try your ut most to turn every item of your professional work into a magical exercise. Do all, even the smallest work, in honour and glory of Adonai: excel in your special duties in life, because He is of you, and you of Him; do not think of Him as Adonai, but think of Adonai as the work; and of your daily work create a symbol of the Symbol of “The Great Work which is TO BE.” The Third Exercise. As the rush of your daily work tends to unbalance you, so do the pleasures you indulge in. Cultivate joyfulness in all yo ur amusements; and, when joyful, break out into silent and inward praise of the joy within you. Do not make a prudish exercise of it, work silently and joyously, and do not discuss your results with casual friends. And above all do everything"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"LIBER CLXV 133 for the hon our and glory of Adonai, so that of your daily pleasures you may construct a symbol of that Unchanging Joy that IS. These instructions were accompanied by a letter from which I quote the following: “The enclosed exercises perform regularly, say to your self: ‘I will do these for three months; even if I get no benefit from them, yet I am determined to do them.’ Write to me whenever you like, but don’t consider any result that you may get as worth much; for these little exercises are only to produce an equ ilibrium which is essential before really setting out. If you add any exercise of your own then do it at a definite hour daily and do it continuously; to take up an exercise and then drop it is worse than useless, for it is unbalancing.” Now, as any Probat ioner knows, as soon as one sets out to do the simplest task regularly and with magical intent, that task becomes not only difficult, but well nigh impossible of performance. This is just what V.I.O. found, and no sooner had his task been set than all kin ds of difficulties presented themselves, like the dog - faced demons mentioned by Zoroaster, to prevent its fulfilment. He tried, but at the end of January he writes: “I cannot get on under these conditions. Had plenty of time to do exercises this morning, but was continually interrupted. Did not robe myself as I have no place fit to call a temple.” How little did he know at that time how well off he really was in the latter respect! He was living in comfort in a Kensington Flat with every convenience of civilization; a few years later he was glad to do Asana and perform his meditations out in the rain, clad in pyjamas, because his tiny tent in British Columbia was too small to allow of work inside. But we digress. At this point his record breaks off abru ptly. He remained in London until May of 1910 , when circumstances arose which made it possible for him to visit British Columbia. Armed then with his instruction paper , The Equinox , and"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 134 a few Occult books, he sailed for Canada, alone, to start again in n ew and unploughed fields. Section III July 25 , 1910 , to April 30 , 1911 The next entry in his diary is dated July 25 th , 1910 . It is a general confession of the previous six months. Half of his year of Probation had passed away, and he has not reported to, or received any communication from, the Order. He laments his negligence in this respect, but writes: “Yet know I well that I alone have suffered and shall suffer from this negligence, and I must humbly take any results that may arise out of my failur e. Still, even though I may have neglected the advice given me when I first became a Probationer, I feel that I have progressed, be it never so slightly, along the Path which from the first I set out to tread. May it not be, O Adonai, that even now the sec ond six months may be made to balance the first six, and that what is passed may yet be for the best?” At that time he had not found out that things always turn out for the best; it took him a long while to realize this, but it is evident that soon afterwa rds his efforts produced some result; for we find an entry on Sunday, August 7 th, 1910 . “I have found (for a few moments) the Peace which passeth all understanding. Amen.” This was evidently the fore - shadowing of his first really notable result, the firs t Dawning of L.V.X. which he experienced on August 29 th. There is an entry on September 2 nd, full of joy and gladness and wonder at his first Illumination; and then, three days later, he had evidently recognised that this alone was not enough, and this was evidently the reason for the next somewhat curious entry"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"LIBER CLXV 135 of September 5 th, 7 : 53 P . M . , which I shall quote practically in full: I am calm now, as I commence to write what may be the last entry in this diary. All that I can remember of my life on this planet has, as I look back upon it, been guided by an unseen hand. For so short a life ( 24 years and six months) it has been filled with an unusual number of incidents, some painful, some joyful and some of a purely spiritual nature. I regret nothing. Again three days have passed since I made entry in this book. I cannot talk of what has happened during those three days, it seems useless to try and do so, in fact it seems useless to make this entry at all except that I know not what is before me, and I feel that had I (or if I) lived longer upon this planet it would have been my life work, indeed it must have been, to help others to the Path. Therefore to those who follow after are these lines written in the hope that they may be saved one drop of the anguish I now suffer. Whatever may have happened in this last three days, the results of my thoughts amount to this. I who have found the heart of the shining triangle, who have indeed become one with the Great White Brotherhood, who have heard the Voice of God in all Its sweetness, who have made that message a part (nay all) of my being, who have held my Beloved in my arms, who have Become my Beloved and lost myself therein, who have for ever given up my lower self, who have conquered Death, who have fel t the Pain of the whole World, who have found Wisdom, Love and Power, who have given up All to become Nothing, I who have seen the need of the World, have found that books (hitherto my dearest companions) have no longer any word to say to me — have found tha t knowledge (relative) or what I thought was knowledge, is of no avail to supply the need of all that other part of my Being that my great God - love would give it. I who have conquered Fear and Death, am now confronted with the fact that without Absolute K nowledge all is vain. I am going to ask the One Last Question. WHY? I have written it. An awful stillness falls. I am alone in my lodgings, I have no money, and I cannot use my Will to demand it from others if I can give nothing in return to help them t o find what they really seek. I have cried with Christ “Eli, Eli, Lama Sabacthani.” I have suffered the Bloody Sweat with Him on the Cross, and now I say with Him “It is finished” Amen. One last note occurs to me before I wrap up this book and seal it an d address it to F. . . in whose hands it will be safe. I looked into the eyes of a little child this evening. Does the answer lie there? Sep. 5th, 12 : 26 P . M . It is over. I have unsealed the package and once more opened the book. This time it will be but a short entry. Very quietly I knelt; I did not robe or burn incense. I just took with me the memory of the little child who had looked into my eyes as I kissed its forehead. Very"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 136 quietly I asked my question. I rose and lay upon the bed, and soon the an swer came. It came quite silently, and at first I thought I must be mistaken, I had (it seemed) heard it so many times before. No other answer came, so I went out into the streets and along my way. Gradually the fuller meaning has dawned on me, and I have returned to make this entry. I need not add much more. I do not put the answer down. It was given in silence and must remain in Silence. Still there seemed to be just one little ripple of joy in the Great Silent Sea as another sould gently sank to its rest , and the silent voices whispered “Welcome brother.” Then all was calm and Peace as before. The little ripple flowed on to let the whole world know, then, having delivered its message, all was still. Amen. Whatever the nature of this Illumination, prob ably a state of Dhyana, it left a very marked result on the consciousness of Frater V.I.O., and gave him the necessary energy to continue his Work through many a dark and dismal period. He himself could not gauge its value at all at the time. He was alon e in Vancouver and out of touch with the Order, having received no further word from his Neophyte since he left England. In fact he heard nothing till January of the following year. He however sent a post - card to say that he had obtained some result. About this same time I find an entry called “The Philosophy of V.I.O.” which seems of interest on account of some similarities to the Law of Thelema, of which he had heard nothing at that time. It reads as follows: Man is bound by but One Law. If he break s a part of it, he hurts no one but himself. While he lives in unity with It, he is God.. While he does not live in unity with It he is Man. While he lives in unity with it he becomes the Law. To realise the Law and live it is the Great Work. To break the Law after he has realized it is Sin. To endeavour to bring all to the knowledge of the Law, is to keep the Law. Seek ye the Law that ye may be Free. Wisdom, Love and Power, these three are One. That these should be One is the Law."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"LIBER CLXV 137 By finding the Point from which these three become equal, and there remaining, by this means only, can the Law be Known.

By the end of September the immediate results of this first Illumination seem to have worn off, and we find Frater V.I.O. striving desperately to estimate the value of what had happened to him. He was certainly in a mental muddle, as the following entry shows, yet at the same ti me his one thought seems to have been to find a means of helping others to find that Light which had so transformed his whole being. Sept. 24 th, 1910 . Driad Hotel. Victoria, B. C. I sit here with the idea of attempting to classify the results latel y obtained. (Since L.V.X. entry.) I may mention that during the interval I have carefully read and studied Crowley’s Tannhäuser, The Sword of Song, Excluded Middle, Time, Berashith, Science and Buddhism, Three Characteristics, etc . In the Light of Und erstanding, all these works have taken on a very different aspect to when I read them previously. Also the Purpose of Liber LXV is clear. The result of all this gives me a feeling that I have arrived at the End and also at the Beginning at the same time. This (by the way) seems the usual experience of the beginner; no sooner does he get a result, any result, than he immediately thinks he is at the end. But V.I.O. is evidently not to be deceived in that way, for he goes on: Now, had I really arrived a t the End, it seems reasonable to suppose I should not be here writing this. My body and mind are at any rate still in existence as a body and mind. But, as these are admittedly impermanent, does it matter much that they continue to exist in this form or n o? What has that to do with the Consciousness of the Existence of That which transcends both?

This realization having come about has at any rate remained as a glimpse of Being, different from the previous not - being. The result of his mental analysis appears to amount to this, that he had experienced within himself a state of consciousness full of Peace and Joy, yet which more nearly approximated to Zero than any other term. He can find nothing with which to compare this state, but he recognizes its immense superiority over normal c onsciousness, and feels an intense desire to make it possible for others to share his experience. Since however he finds it impossible to explain it in words, he recognises that he must obtain the knowledge of some definite System of producing the state s cientifically, but since be is not even a Neophyte of the A ∴ A ∴ , he wonders if They will recognise him as qualified to demand the right to know and spread Their teachings. He determines in any case to reduce the wants of the Ego as a separate being as far a s possible, by forgetting self in his efforts to do all he can for others according to the Light he had obtained. He found however that the destruction of the Ego was not thus easily accomplished at the first assault. Nevertheless he learned, not from books but from experience, that the Goal was to be found within himself, and that the nearer he could approach to the Consciousness of Nothingness the nearer he got to the Realization of Pure Existence. This reduction of consciousness to Zero then became t he fixed aim of his Meditations; and any other experiments he entered upon, were, from that time onward, looked upon as necessary in order that he might fit himself to help others, rather than for his personal development.

For one thing, the cutting of his arm during the first practice in the control of speech resulted in a subconscious wariness, for during the second — the details of which I have not recorded — he noticed that although the ob ject of the practice was the control of the body by not crossing the legs, yet the attempt of the legs to drop into their old habits often had the effect of making him suddenly more careful in his speech, thus showing that there was an underlying connectio n in his subconscious mind resulting from his former work. These practices may then be said to have a cumulative effect, which makes them all the more valuable in helping towards the general control of body and mind. But what is of still greater impor tance as far as Frater V.I.O. was concerned, they evidently had the effect — heightened perhaps by a letter from his Neophyte — of causing him to make a fresh and more determined effort to perform the Mystical Exercises for a definite period and with regulari ty, according to his original A ∴ A ∴ instructions. From January 30 th, 1911 , to April 30 th of that year, he kept a scientifically tabulated diary and during the prescribed three months he never missed a day in the performance of his appointed task. His re sults, during this period, were perhaps not of a very startling nature, but, as any true Student learns, it is the long and continued “grind,” the determined effort to carry out the work in hand or task set, in spite of every obstacle that may arise, that really counts when it comes to lasting results. It is the Will that needs training, and the accomplishment of such work, particularly if uninteresting and tedious in itself, goes far towards that end."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 144 Jan. 30 th, 1911 . Letter from Frater P.A. his Neophyte. From this letter he learned that many changes had transpired since he left England, and among them that Frater P.A. had severed his connection with the Outer Order, but was willing to continue in charge of him. Feb. 5 th. He wondered if Frater P.A. had onl y told him this as a test. It must be remembered that all this while he had worked on alone, and had had no news to speak of, and this he attributed to his own failure to carry out his task in detail. In this he was no doubt right to a great extent, for u nless any Probationer does what he is instructed, he can expect no further help, which would only mean that the Master concurred in his laziness or weakness. March 6 th, 1911 . Up to this time, although he had done the exercises regularly no particular resu lt had occurred, and we find this note: “I do not really look for any results now, or expect any, since control of ‘self’ is the object of these exercises.” Now it is to be noted that when one really gets to a state when having worked one is content to con tinue to do so, expecting no results, one often obtains them. (Of course it’s no use trying to fool oneself on these things, you can’t get a result by just saying you don’t care a damn.) Something of the sort seems to have happened in this case, as the f ollowing shows. March 12 th. During Lecture on “Parsifal,” I felt illumination within which permeated my whole being, and I became conscious once more of the Truth of my previous Illumination which I had lost, as it were. This entry is interesting. Illumin ation comes, and at the time there is no doubt about it. IT IS.

However, immediately one"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"LIBER CLXV 145 approaches another period one can recognise the symptoms, almost in advance, and the new Illumination is as it were added to the old, and there is fresh wonder and joy in both. March 15 th I feel as if I were a highly strung musical instrument. My Will runs over the strings, causing complete and harmonious vibrations in my being, which seems to give forth at times an unforrnulated and therefore most delightful melody. March 28 th. How can I write it, how put into words the least idea of that which is unformed? Yet I will try while yet a vestige of the thought remains. I have conceived within my womb a child. Or is it that I have for the first time realized that I have a womb? Yet it is so, that “blank” wi thin, into which I have projected my thoughts, and from which they have come forth again “living” is for a greater purpose. Can I not form therein a child that shall be MYSELF made from the highest ideals, the essence of my pains, refined and purified, fre ed from dross by the living fire? This life of Service must be lived till I am “selfless” in all that I knew as myself; but all the time will not my “child” be growing within me, composed of finer materials? And by complete union therwith.. . I cannot form ulate any more now. This entry indicates a recognition of the “formulation of the negative in the ego” which shall eventually destroy it. Is it not written in Liber LXV “As an acid eats into steel, and as a cancer utterly corrupts the body, so am I un to the spirit of Man. I shall not rest until I have destroyed it utterly”? Sunday, April 2 nd. (Fra V.I.O.’s 25 th Birthday.) During practice I had a distinct consciousness of the “centre of consciousness” being not “within” as usual, but above head. April 3 rd. I alternate between a state of “enjoying any task or position because it is the first that comes to hand and therefore the simplest and best course of action,” and “a feeling of absolute mental torture caused by the necessity of existing at all.” The f irst appears to give the chance of continually “enlarging” until one becomes That which I can “consciously be” for a short period at a time, and the other seems to lead to annihilation. Probably the multiplication of one state by the other is the solution. (Crowley’s 0 × ∞ .) "},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 146 Sat., April 8 th. During the last three days have gradually been nearing another “climax” which reached, shall I say, its height on Saturday, when I arrived at a state of Illumination which was, as it were “added to my previous state.” I seized a scrap of paper and wrote “Amid all the complications and perplexity there remains, back of all, the Will. The Will to Be. The Will to Be Nothing, which is the only state inconceivable to the mind. The old God willed to be something, and the Universe appeared; The New God wills to be Nothing and becomes?” After writing the foregoing, there was a state of bliss the reflection of which was caught by the body. So joyful it became that it whirled round in a mad dance, and was filled with music. It was stifled by the confines of the room; but “I” was Free, so it couldn’t matter much. (This is the second experience of rhythm filling the body, and causing it to whirl and dance in order to find expression somehow.) April 9 th. Started to read abou t 8:30 this morning. Sometime during morning lost idea of “ego” to realize All as Self. (Left notes for a couple of hours.) I find terrible difficulty in expressing the slightest idea of that which occurred during this state, yet it would seem of import ance to do the best I can. That there is no soul struck me as a horrible blank. That I do not, and never have existed as “I” comes as a wonderful realization while the consciousness of the unreality of the “I” lasts. With the loss of “the ego” comes the consciousness that the whole universe of things and people is but a part of the State then arrived at. That if this little body dies, existence still remains in all the other part of the Universe and therefore the change called Death, occurring in differ ent atoms, all the time, makes no difference. Is there any reason why one should not look upon every thing and everybody as parts of Oneself, since one is equally willing to allow any other body to consider you as a part of their imagination only? It wou ld seem that one tiny part — self — has been fondly cherished, while in reality that tiny part is but a reflex of the Whole which is really You, but even this state must in the end give way before the Power of Nothing.

I cou ld feel the Goal, but the wish to help others made it impossible to Become the State I contemplated. After this, I was surprised, on letting all breath out of the body, to feel a sudden lightness, as if I were about to float. This being unexpected, caused me to turn my thoughts to the body, after which, although I tried, I could not get back to the previous"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"LIBER CLXV 147 state. I estimate that I remained in the condition mentioned for over an hour, as it was 12 o’c. when I looked at the time. In fact, it may have been ne arer two hours. The above meditation left Frater V.I.O. with a feeling of “Nearly but not Quite.” He had, to some extent, gazed at the Goal of Nothingness, but had failed to Become that Goal. The following day there is despondency and dissatisfaction. On A pril 22 nd reason again holds sway, and he tries to use it to discover just where he is, of course without success, since Reason can never explain that which is Beyond Reason. I think at this point he also began to make another grave error; he tried to comp are his experiences with those of John St. John, with the result that, later on, when he undertook a Retirement, that of J. St. J. subconsciously influenced him to a great extent, although he would not and could not have admitted it at the time. In these t hings one must be Oneself, not try to be another. His entry of April 22 is a long one, and I quote it in part. I wish I could express myself better. On reading J. St. J. again I find that I can comprehend it ever so much better than when I first read it so me three months after its publication. Then, it seemed like a dream of the far distant future; now, many parts seem like records of my own experiences, only expressed infinitely better than I have been able to put them. Now, of what value are the experie nces I have gained? Why is the state of Oneness with Adonai not lasting, or rather, is it possible to remain always conscious of that State? How is it when reading an account like J. St. John’s that I know what he is talking about, and can feel with him the difficulty of putting these things into words? I could not have realized this a year ago, before I entered into certain states of which I cannot gauge the value at all, while in normal consciousness. There is no Doubt Then. But how may I be Sure alw ays? I will fetch The Equinox , and put down the points as they come to me. Let me quote page 87 . “Well, one thing I got (again!) that is that when all is said and done I am that I am, all these thoughts of mine, angels and devils both, are only fleeting moods of me. The one true self of me is Adonai. Simple! Yet I cannot remain in that simplicity.” I can realize that state perfectly, but I am not a Magician, I know little or nothing of"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 148 Ceremonial Magick, except from reading; my results have not been accompanied by visions. What results I have obtained have been in the nature of becoming the thing itself, not seeing it. However, to pass on: Is the idea of coming back to help others (see Sun. Apr. 16 ) only a form of the Dweller on the Threshold and c aused through fear of annihilation or madness? Or is it a concession to my own weakness, a pandering to my “self” because I am really nowhere near ready to hurl myself into the Gulf, instead of which I come back to normal consciousness, and try and make m yself believe I have “given up” what I “could not get” for the sake of “others” which do not exist at the time (for me)? This is certainly a difficult one to tackle; I am entering it so as to try and formulate the proposition clearly. Now, the doubt ente rs my mind, that I have only put it down in order to appear honest to Fra. P.A., or anyone who may read this record. NO. . . . The foregoing thought seems to have a parallel in J. St. J. Again on page 96 “I must attain or . . . an end to J. St. J.” seems similar to the state arrived at one Sept. 5 , 1910 , when I determined to ask the last WHY? and afterwards entered into Peace. On page 133 he says “subtly, simply, imperceptibly gliding I passed away into nothing. . . . I felt the interior trembling kindle itself into a kiss. . . . also I was given to enjoy the subtle Presence of my Lord interiorly during the whole of the twelfth day. But he withdrew Himself . . . yet leaving a comfort not to be told, a Peace . . . The Peace.” Yes, with me also the Peace has remained, but sometimes I cannot connect myself with It, or fail to do so, being led away by Maya. Then comes the entry of the Thirteenth Day: “Being entered into the Silence let me abide in the Silence. Amen.” And here I am puzzled. Either J. St. J. a ttained permanently to a State such that he was never again annoyed by the silly mistake of identifying Himself with the body, or he did not. 3 But after all, what has that to do with V.I.O.? It has certainly nothing to do with C.S.J. But how do I stand? T his seems to be the position. While in normal consciousness I know that I (or Not I) am ever in the state of which I sometimes catch the reflection when I realize that I am not I. There, that is the clearest original thought I have expressed this afternoon , and bad at that. Of course, I am really quite content, it is only when I begin to think and reason about things that I begin to become discontented. It’s about time I shut up.

On Sunday, May 7 th he writes: I have not made an entry in this record for a whole week. I seem to be losing control, and my diary, lying untouched in my drawer , is becoming like a horrible fiend. It worries me when I do not enter it; and yet it requires a great effort even to touch it or take it out, while to enter it daily appears an almost superhuman task. Why is this? I have done exercises this week as usu al, but a little earlier than previously, because I have to be at the office by 8:30 A . M . instead of nine o’c. as heretofore. I think Fra. P.A. might write to me. I feel that he is testing me, and have tried to hold to that idea. I know that really it do es not matter, but I am weak yet, and should so like a little friendly push and a few words of advice. I feel like dropping it all for a time; but that is perhaps the very thing that is so difficult, in fact, the whole trick! O dear, I am certainly having a spell of “dryness.” But I will plod on, On, ON, and in, In, IN. O for one kiss, or the echo of a Kiss, My Lord Adonai. I yearn for Thee, I am Parched for Thee.

Because I have experienced a “dryness” for the last month, and have made no definite effort to overcome it, but have just kept a firm hold on the little atom of real Knowledge I have obtai ned, & setting my face still towards the East, have plodded on with this material existence and the office work I have undertaken.

The note re Neophytes and Probationers has set me at rest about the silence of Fra P.A.; and confirms, what all the while I have suspected, that his de lay in answering is a test. This confirmation is cheering, however hard the trial may have been, in so far as I had made up my mind to work on, whether he writes or not, and had got quite used to the idea of having to work out my own Path, without outside aid or encouragement. He was also pleased to find some of his own experiments more or less confirmed in Liber HHH of which he writes: M.M.M. 2 , “mentions the breath playing upon the skin, etc.” I have experienced this, and asked Fra P.A. for instructions thereon. Sometimes, after hard breathing, I have been filled with the sensation. I think I understand the “lightning flash,” but shall experiment. My present knowledge is more as a sheet of summer lightning.

On Saturday night, in bed I attempted “thinking backwards” and successfully managed two days, with no breaks in the first d ay, and practically none for the day before, except a few little incidents during office hours in the morning. When I came to thoughts on waking of Saturday morning and got to the “blank” I experienced some mental visions and “telephone - cross voices,” but cannot say if they were connected with any dream; then suddenly I found myself lying in bed with the last thoughts of the previous night in mind. Yesterday, I read the article on the subject (Training of the Mind) carefully, also learnt the formula of the four great meditations on Love, Pity, Happiness and Indifference.

However, once started, I got back through Sunday and very nearly, if not q uite as fully, over the two previous days; then, having got into the swing, I roughly attempted a short and incomplete review of my whole life, which although brief, was much fuller than I expected. I remembered things connected with early childhood quite accurately, but of course not with full connections. Then something occurred that I really did not expect, and only later trials will prove if it was an illusion or not. Having tried hard to pierce the blank, back of all, I had a sudden clear sensation of lying on a bed with people around, and in particular an elderly man in black velvet and knee breeches, whom I at once felt was my Tutor, leaning over me. The ideas that came with this were that I was quite young, and had some disease like consumption, t hat the family was wealthy, and the house a Country Residence. These impressions were very real and quite unexpected, but as I used to have a dread of consumption, and still young, and meditation took place lying down, it would seem that very little imagi nation would make up the rest. However, I mention it, as the experience was different from anything I can previously remember. July 8 th, 1911 . About a fortnight ago, I received a letter from Frater P.A. 5 in answer to my previous two. I was pleased to he ar from him, but he gave me a good talking to, also some new instructions. He wanted to    5 Frater P.A. was not a Neophyte, but had been appointed to receive other Probationers for administrative convenience. This was a plain breach of the regulations of the Order, and the result was this comic letter. Frater P.A. was apparently under the impression that as soon as any one happened along into Samadhi, he was to yawn his “Nunc dimittis.” This incident should be a warning to all those in charge of authority that they must in no wise vary the strict instructions of the Order, however obvious may appear th e advantages of doing so. The result of Frater P.A.’s presumption in trying to train Frater V.I.O., instead of pressing on to the mark of his own high calling, was that he simply dropped out of the Order altogether, leaving himself as a memorial only t his ridiculous episode, in which he appears as a small boy who should have hooked a tarpon when he was fishing for catfish. Had he adhered to the rules of the Order, attended solely to his own business, and forwarded V.I.O.’s record to his superiors, w ho were competent to interpret it, we should not have had this excellent example of the results of presumption and folly to guide us for the future, and to enliven our perusal of the record of our conscientious V.I.O. with a touch of timely merriment. — O.M."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 152 know, what I meant by making a claim to having attained Samadhi, or something very like it, in August last, and then shortly afterwards started cutting my arm, etc. I have not answered it yet, but this much for reference: ( 1 ) I never mentioned Samadhi, nor can I remember claiming to have attained it. ( 2 ) I did attain a state of consciousness which has had a lasting effect upon my life and made my viewpoint entirely d ifferent from that time.

I did so and am not sorry. This letter from Fra P.

He then experimented with SSS section of Liber HHH, fr om The Equinox, vol. V and obtained automatic rigidity. He writes: “( 1 ) Brain became charged with electric fluid or Prana, in fact whole face and hands became as if connected with an electric battery, also brain seemed luminous but void.

The current became very strong and almost unbearable. Whole body became perfectly and automatically rigid.

He then reported this, and his general progress, to Fra P.A. In July, he received a letter from Fra P.A., saying that he had now arrived at a stage when he might undertake an Operation for the Invocation of Adonai, 6 which would require six weeks ’ work, the last twelve days of which must be in complete Retirement. At first he could see no possible way to undertake this, owing to, ( 1 ) Family Affairs, ( 2 ) Office work, ( 3 ) Lack of money. He determined however to go ahead in spite of apparent obstac les, and duly made a start at Midnight, August 31 .

It would be hardly right to say that this Magical Retirement produced no results, though it may not have produced the One Desired Result. By the time a man has made 671 entries in his Magical Record (as Frater V.I.O. did during those six weeks) and each of those entries has a direct bearing on the matter in hand, he is bound to have produced a state of mind somewhat different from normal consciousness. (It is interesting to note that 671 , by a curious coincide nce, is the numeration of Adonai, spelt in full, the Central idea of the Invocation.)    6 No man has the right to make the slightest suggestion to another as to when he should or should not undertake this critical and central Operation.

Having closed my eyes for a few moments (concen trating), I thought I would try and think backwards over the last few things I had been doing, but found, try as I would, I could not think of things done even a moment before. All was the “present peculiar experience,” and there was no getting away from it. The concentration acted just like a magnet, and became automatic. Again, on trying to look back over this retirement, it appears as a “Single state of consciousness,” not as a number of events. I should really have to read my diary if I wanted to kn ow any details in succession just now. At the end of the 10th day of this Section C and the beginning of the 11th day I think the true climax of the Operation took place, for he writes: Oct. 11, 12:30. So did the day start and I knelt at the altar from 12 Midnight until 12:28. During this time did my Lord Adonai begin to manifest within me, so that my being was wrapped away in bliss ineffable. And my body was filled with rapture of His coming until the cry burst from my lips “My Lord and my God.” There a re no words to describe Thee, my Beloved, though I yet tremble with the joy of Thy presence, yet do I feel that this is but the beginning of the reflection of Thee. O God, wrap me utterly away, beyond even this Bliss. Let me be utterly consumed in Thine Essence. Amen.

All being in order I knelt in prayer and at 7 P . M . I arose and performed the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, then, taking the ritual in my left hand and raising the wand in my right, I slowly and clearly read the Oath and the Invocat ion. Afterwards, I was impressed to make a certain Sign with the wand. And the Word that came to me was . . .

And nothing happened. Then something seemed to tell me to get up and to kneel again at the altar , yet I waited, but presently I arose and stood at the altar, and I felt “I am that I am”; but there seemed not much joy in the thought, and yet, I knew that I had done all, even the least thing, to the best of mine understanding and ability. . . . And it began to dawn upon me that I had failed, but where and how, I know not. I have been dazzled with no illusionary success, I have overcome the fear of failure, and now, even as a tired warrior, I will go back into the world — and STRIVE. The Next day. Chaos. Reason is quite inadequate to solve the problem. Here followeth a certain passage from Ezekiel. “Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shalt thy tears run down. F orbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men. So I spake unto the people in the morning; and at even my wife died: and I did i n the morning as I was commanded. And the people said unto me: Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so? Then I answered them. The word of the Lord came unto me saying: Speak unto the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God . . . Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done, shall ye do; and when this cometh, ye shall know that I am the Lord. Also, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desi re of their eyes, and that whereon they set their minds. . .

Section V January 1 st, 1913 , to Decembe r 31 st, 1913 We must now pass on to Fra V.I.O.’s diary for the year 1913 , E.V. I can find no written records of the period between October 13 th, 1912 , when he finished the Retirement, and March 2 nd, 1913 , when he again began to keep a regular summary of hi s work. On that date he writes: During the last few days some important events have taken place. First however I must mention that I have heard nothing from Frater P.A. since the retirement except a P.C. to say that he had received my record. On . . . I re ceived a letter dated in London, Jan. 10 th, from the Chancellor of A ∴ A ∴ , asking the results of my work since I became a Probationer. Answered same on Jan. 26 th, and was surprised and pleased on Feb. 26 th, to receive a reply passing me to the Grade of Neoph yte, followed by the necessary documents. Answered this on Feb. 28 th. This letter from the Chancellor of A ∴ A ∴ passing Frater V.I.O. to the grade of Neophyte, contained the following passage, which is important, in the light of later events: “We wi sh our Body to be a Body of Servants of Humanity. A time will come when you will obtain the experience of the 14 th Æthyr. You will become a Master of the Temple. That experience must be followed by that of the 13 th Æthyr, in which, the Master, wholly casti ng aside all ideas of personal attainment, busies himself exclusively with the care of others.” The year 1913 was an important one for Frater V.I.O. in many ways. For one thing, it was during this period that he was forced to stand alone, and to rely upon himself and his own judgment of what was the right course of action for the"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"LIBER CLXV 157 governance of his life and the solution of his family difficulties as well as his occult problems. Hitherto, as before remarked, he had been under the guidance of one upon whom he had looked as his Neophyte, and in whom he had placed the utmost confidence. He now found himself in one of the most trying situations that had up to that time been his lot to cope with, viz.: that he must choose between the continuance of that guidance , and the regular course of training mapped out in the Outer Order of the A ∴ A ∴. He must either resign the grade of Neophyte just conferred upon him, severing his connection with the Outer Order, or cease to work under Frater P.A. altogether. The reasons for this cannot be dealt with fully in this place, nor would they be of the slightest interest to our readers. Suffice it to say that Frater V.I.O. had pledged himself to work on certain lines for six months and that these lines had been laid down by Frat er P.A. His duty was then fairly clear, so he practically severed himself from obtaining guidance from either his old Neophyte or his newly appointed Zelator, until that period of work, to which he felt bound by his own oath to himself, was over, and at t he end of that time, having worked hard and well. Those who were guiding and directing his life made the way clear for him, and he found himself in a position to accept the instruction of the A ∴ A ∴ , coming under the direct guidance of Frater O.M. This eve nt must not be supposed to reflect in any way on Frater P.A. for whom he always felt and will feel great love and respect; the circumstances leading up to this change were outside the sphere of influence of Fra V.I.O. and the more difficult to judge owing to his isolation in Canada. With this brief allusion to the change in his occult affairs, we may pass on to a corresponding change in his material surroundings, for"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 158 although he continued with his usual office work, he lived during the best part of this ye ar under canvas in a small tent by the sea shore, necessitating some miles of walking every day, and throwing him a good deal more in touch with Nature than formerly; also the addition of a “little stranger” to his family had a marked effect on his home af fairs, being as it were the key to the solution of certain problems that had been puzzling him in that direction. During the period from March 2 nd to September 4 th, when we might say he was working on alone, his record shows some 340 Meditation practices, mostly in the Asana known as the Dragon, the periods ranging from a few minutes to something over an hour, but most of them comparatively short, the average perhaps being twenty minutes. After this there is a gap, during which he worked morning and evening most days, but made no further record till November 9 , from which date to December 31 over eighty practices are recorded. Of the details of all this early work it is not necessary to treat very fully, but since, on sending in his record at the end of the year, it was returned by Frater O.M. with various notes and comments of the greatest help and value to Fra V.I.O., I am selecting those passages so commented upon as likely to be of most interest and help to other students.

How one long s sometimes to express things and thoughts and generally ends by some commonplace entry. I think to - night I will try a little more than usual. All this time I have been plodding on, having made up my mind to a course of action in accordance with my aspir ation. Day after day I have continued until this round of existence has become almost a fixed habit. My times of meditation and practice have dwindled till they are somewhat short, but for all that, the main idea has never become clouded. I feel far mor e determined in every way than I did, although less certain of any fixed goal. I know also that I have problems to face, now, or in the future, but have learnt to keep doing what comes to hand, without wavering or despairing. I do not seem to have made m uch definite progress, yet there are signs which give me to understand that all is as it should be; perhaps I am more in tune and so do not notice such vivid changes. I have found nature very fair and beautiful, this summer. I have got to love Her so muc h more than formerly. Then again, I have mastered Her a little more; I have learnt more of swimming, climbing, walking and other exercises through daily practice. I have made new friends, have learnt from them and taught them in return. All this, in spit e of the limited existence of living in a tiny tent and often being very hard up. The power to retreat into that part of me which is Peace, free from all strife, remains with me.

Presently, it struck me that the man was not living but dead. Death. We then drifted in a mist, and all became blank for a while; the memory of boat, man and self, were all but lost.

Then again arose the question “What about the Others when this state s ubsides again?” Then it seemed that a voice spoke clearly to the brain, saying: “Truly when united so thou art one with the Holy Guardian Angel that speaks unto thee now. Therefore worry no more about attaining. In future it is thy work to see that not onl y the part attain, but that other parts, those that are called ‘others’ in ordinary consciousness, realize the Oneness also.” N. B. These are not the words, and do not properly express the meaning. The experience itself was in the nature of realization rat her than in any language. [Not at all bad. — O.M.] Dec. 12 . To - night, while walking, I thought that some time, when I can find the right person, it would be well to get him to record for me one of these experiences such as that of last night, during its occ urrence; ( 1 ) providing I could speak without altering the state of consciousness; ( 2 ) providing I could find the necessary person.

On first trying to project astral it went rapidly off in a N.E. direction [Bad. — O.M.] then described a curve to the North and so round twice, and became normal again. Second attempt. Enclosed astral in egg of light, sent it straight up. Egg opened; and I opened eyes in space. I saw above me a shining object , oblong in shape, and travelling to it, found it almost like a kite. Leaning upon it, I was carried backwards for some distance, during which time I watched a changing landscape below. Wishing to descend, I dropped towards the Earth, and found body supp orted by another. When near the ground, skimmed over the earth and eventually came to a dark gateway or tunnel. Walked into this and proceeded, lighted by a silver star on brow, till I arrived at a circular room at the end, lit by one candle placed on a round table at which sat an old white - bearded man writing in a book. I approached him, and said: “Why writest thou, Father ?“ and he replied “That those who read may live.” (I seem to have asked him another question, but cannot remember what.) Then I sa id: “What writest thou, Father?” And he replied: “Death, always Death,” And I said: “Show me thy writing, Father” and looking he wrote the word HARTHA. And I said “This is a mystery to me” so he pointed to it letter by letter and I tried to interpret it Qabalistically, but was not successful. It seemed that the value of the letters was 507 . He said I should understand, and with that I left him and returned."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 168 8 P . M . , Dec. 16 .

I find however that the word actually adds to 607 = Adam Primus. But 6 plus 7 = 13 Unity, Love, and The Tarot Trump is DEA TH, and this is what he said he was writing. (Note Apr. 21 , 1917 .

Instead of sleeping deeply, as was my former habit, I have lately noticed quite a change in this respect. Sometimes, though resting, I retain consciousness most of the night. In this s tate I appear to think very much along the same lines as I do in ordinary waking consciousness. In the morning I have the ability to change from one state to the other quite easily, but on leaving the bed and becoming fully awakened I can seldom remember a ny particulars of what occurred during sleep.

After striving to unite consciousness completely with Adonai, t he sphere of Consciousness widened out and became one with the Many; so that, when asking of the Self: “What am I? Who am I?” this no longer seemed an individual question, but to be taken up by many units in all parts of space, yet upon a formless plane. I rose higher and tried to unify all these; this resulted in an absolutely impersonal state which continued even after the meditation was over until about 12 o’clock. While it lasted it was distinctly different from any former experience, especially the ear lier part.

You work hard and regularly, and keep the record well. And you have the Root of the Matter in you. These are your - dangers. (1) You are emotional. This is very bad, and must be got rid of. It’s a form of Egoism, and leads to the Left - hand Path. You say: “I object to my wife being run over by a motor - car,” and think you are stating an Eternal Truth. Now no elephant in Siam cares whether she is run over or not. Say then: “It is (relatively to V.I.O.) right that he should object, etc., etc.” Use this analysis with all emotions. Don’t allow yourself to think that your own point of view is the only one. Read Liber LXV, Cap. I: 32 — 40 and 57 — 61 . This is extremely important: for one thing, if you fail to understand, you will go mad when you come to a certain Gate. ( 2 ) You are inclined to vagueness. This is evidently partly caused by the fog of emotion. Before you can pass to Zelator, you must know an d rule the Astral Plane throughout. Astral journeys, however interesting and even splendid and illuminating, don’t count unless they are willed. If you want to go to your office, and find yourself at the Town Hall instead, it’s no excuse that the Town Ha ll has fine columns! You should drop all “Meditations on Love.” What’s the matter with Hate, anyway? From beyond the Abyss, they look as like each other as two new pennies. You really mean “Reflection on Love”: “Jones’ Night Thoughts”: “Idle thoughts of an idle fellow.” It’s a soul - destroying, mind - fuddling practice. If indulged in, it will absolutely ruin all power of concentration. Now here is your Examination for the Grade of Zelator. 9 (a) Go through a door on which is engraved this figure and expla in the figure in detail by means of your visions. ( b ) Invoke Mercury and Hod, and travel till you meet the Unicorn mentioned in Liber LXV, Cap. III, verse 2 . Report its conversation fully.    8 [This sort of thing is all wrong. It isn’t really meditation at all. You let your mind rove about, instead of pinning it down to a single, simple obje ct.

It is a much harder paper than would be set in most cases. — O.M.]"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 170 ( c ) Discover by visions the nature of the Alchemical principles, S ulphur, Mercury, and Salt.

You wouldn’t allow your wife to come to the office and talk: you must make her respe ct your hour of work at home. Here I foresee trouble: with rarest exceptions a woman objects to a man doing anything of which she is not the centre. His business is only allowable because it provides for her.

He is about to confront the denizens of the Astral World, menacing or seducing in turn; and, f ollowing the bold Rosicrucian rule, he remains in the current of life, without the safeguard of an absolute external retirement and renunciation, such as is advocated by Eastern teachers.

Let Us remind you that t his is a magical formula of cosmic scope, and that it is given in exact detail in the legend of the Golden Fleece. Jason, who in this story represents the Beast, first fits out a ship guided by Wisdom or Athena, and this is his aspiration to the Great Work . Accompanied by many heroes, he comes to the place of the Fleece, but they can do nothing until Medea, the Scarlet Woman, puts into his hands a posset “drugged with somnolence, Sleepy with poppy and white hellebore” for the dragon. Then Jason is able to subdue the bulls, sacred to Osiris, and symbolical of his Æon and the Magical Formula of Self - Sacrifice.

Nay! but to the glory of Ra - hoor - Khuit and the est ablishment of His perfect kingdom let all be done! Now, O my son, thou knowest that it is Our will to establish this Work, accomplishing fully that which We are commanded in The Book of the Law , “Help me, O warrior lord of Thebes, in my unveiling before th e Children of men!” — and it is Thy will, manifesting as thou hast done in the Sphere of Malkuth the material world, to do this same thing in an even more immediate and practical way than would naturally appeal to one whose manifestation is in the Heaven of Jupiter.

Therefore doubt not, but strike with all thy strength. Note also, pray thee, this word: “the Law is for all.” Do not theref ore ‘select suitable persons’ in thy worldly wisdom; preach openly the Law to all men. In Our experience We have found the most unlikely means have produced the best results; and indeed it is almost the definition of a true Magical Formula that the means should be unsuited, rationally speaking, to the end proposed. Note, pray thee, that We are bound to teach. “He must teach; but he may make severe the ordeals.” This refers, however, as is evident from the context, to the technique of the new Magick, “th e mantras and the spells; the obeah and the wanga; the work of the wand and the work of the sword.” Note, pray thee, the instruction in CCXX I:41 - 44, 51, 61, 63, k.t.l . on which We have enlarged in Our tract The Law of Liberty , and in private letters to th ee and others. The open preaching of this Law, and the practice of these precepts, will arouse discussion and animosity, and thus place thee upon a rostrum whence thou mayest speak unto the people. Note, pray thee, this mentor: “Remember ye that existence is pure joy; that all the sorrows are but shadows; they pass and are done; but there is that which remains.” For this doctrine shall comfort many. Also there is this word: “They shall rejoice, our chosen; who sorroweth is not of us. Beauty and strength , leaping laughter and delicious languor, force and fire, are of us.” Indeed in all ways thou mayest expound the joy of our Law, nay, for thou shalt overflow with the joy thereof, and have no need of words. It would moreover be"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 176 impertinent and tedious to call again thine attention to all those passages that thou knowest so well. Note, pray thee, that in the matter of direct instruction there is enough. Consider the passage “Choose ye an island! Fortify it! Dung it about with enginery of war! I will g ive you a war - engine. With it ye shall smite the peoples; and none shall stand before you. Lurk! Withdraw! Upon them! this is the Law of the Battle of Conquest: thus shall my worship be about my secret house.” The last phrase suggests that the island ma y be Great Britain, with its Mines and Tanks; and it is notable that a certain brother obligated to A ∴ A ∴ is in the most secret of England’s War Councils at this hour. But it is possible that this instruction refers to some later time when our Law, administered by some such Order as the O . T . O . which concerns itself with temporal affairs, is of weight in t he councils of the world, and is challenged by the heathen, and by the followers of the fallen gods and demigods. Note, pray thee, the practical method of overcoming opposition given in CCXX III: 23 - 26 . But this is not to Our immediate purpose in this epis tle. Note, pray thee, the instruction in the 38 th and 39 th verses of the Third Chapter of The Book of the Law . It must be quoted in full. “So that thy light is in me; and its red flame is as a sword in my hand to push thy order.” That is, the God himself is aflame with the Light of the Beast, and will himself push the order, through the fire (perhaps meaning the genius) of The Beast.

Bid me within thine House to dwell, O wingèd snake of light, Hadit! Abide with me, Ra - Hoor - Khuit!” In the comment in Equinox I ( 7 ) this passage is virtually ignored. It is possible that th is “secret door” refers to the four men and four women spoken of later in The Paris Working , or it may mean the child elsewhere predicted, or some secret preparation of the hearts of men. It is difficult to decide on such a point, but we may be sure that the Event will show that the exact wording was so shaded as to prove to us absolute foreknowledge on the part of That Most Holy Angel who uttered the Book. Note, pray thee, further, in verse 39 , how the matter proceeds: “All this ...” — i.e. The Book of the La w itself. “... and a book to say how thou didst come hither ...” i.e. some record such as that in The Temple of Solomon the King"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 178 “... and a reproduction of this ink and paper for ever ...” i.e. by some mechanical process, with possibly a sample of paper similar to that employed. “ — for it is in the word secret and not only in the English — ” Compare CCXX III: 47 , 73 . The secret is still a secret to Us. “... and thy comment upon this the Book of the Law shall be printed beautifully in red ink and black upon beautiful pa per made by hand; ...” i.e. explain the text “lest there be folly” as it says above, CCXX I: 36 . “... and to each man and woman that thou meetest, were it but to dine or to drink at them, it is the Law to give. Then they shall chance to abide in this bliss or no; it is no odds. Do this quickly!” From this it is evident that a volume must be prepared as signified — Part IV of Book 4 was intended to fulfil this purpose — and that this book must be distributed widely, in fact to every one with whom one comes into soc ial relations. We are not to add to this gift by preaching and the like. They can take it or leave it. Note, pray thee, verse 41 of this chapter: “Establish at thy Kaaba a clerk - house; all must be done well and with business way.” This is very clear instr uction indeed. There is to be a modern centralized business organization at the Kaaba — which, We think, does not mean Boleskine, but any convenient headquarters.

We may aid men to strike off their own fetters, but those who prefer slavery must be allowed to do so. “The slaves shall serve.” The excellence of the Law must be showe d by its results upon those who accept it. When men see us as the hermits of Hadit described in CCXX II:24 they will determine to emulate our joy. Note, pray thee, the whole implication of the chapter that sooner or later we are to break the power of the slave - gods by actual fighting. Ultimately, Freedom must rely upon the sword. It is impossible to treat in this epistle of the vast problems involved in this question; and they must be decided in accordance with the Law by those in authority in the Order when the time comes. Thou wilt note that We have written unto thee more as a member of the O . T . O . than in thy capacity as of the A ∴ A ∴ , for the former organization is coördinate and practical, and concerns itself with material things. But remember this cl early, that the Law cometh from the A ∴ A ∴ , not from the O . T . O . This Order is but the first of the great religious bodies to accept this Law officially, and its whole Ritual has been revised and reconstituted in accordance with this decision. Now then, lea ving The Book of the Law , note, pray thee, the following additional suggestions for extending the Dominion of the Law of Thelema throughout the whole world. 1 . All those who have accepted the Law should announce the same in daily intercourse. “Do what tho u wilt shall be the whole of the Law” shall be the invariable form of greeting. These words, especially in the case of strangers, should be pronounced in a clear, firm, and articulate voice, with the eyes frankly fixed upon the hearer. If the other be of us, let him reply “Love is the law, love under will.” The"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 180 latter sentence shall also be used as the greeting of farewell. In writing, wherever greeting is usual, it should be as above, opening “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.”, and clos ing “Love is the law, love under will.” 2 . Social gatherings should be held as often as is convenient, and there the Law should be read and explained. 3 . The special tracts written by Us, or authorized by Us, should be distributed to all persons with whom those who have accepted the Law may be in contact. 4 . Pending the establishment of other Universities and Schools of Thelema, scholarships and readerships and such should be provided in existing Schools and Universities, so as to secure the general study o f Our writings, and those authorized by Us as pertaining to the New Æon. 5 . All children and young people, although they may not be able to understand the more exalted heavens of our horoscope, may always be taught to rule their lives in accordance with th e Law. No efforts should be spared to bring them to this emancipation. The misery caused to children by the operation of the law of the slave - gods was, one may say, the primum mobile of Our first aspiration to overthrow the Old Law. 6 . By all manner of m eans shall all strive constantly to increase the power and freedom of the Headquarters of the O . T . O . ; for thereby will come efficiency in the promulgation of the Law. Specific instructions for the extension of the O . T . O . are given in another epistle.

Man, th erefore, is at odds with Wood and Water; and being a magician bethinketh Himself to take one of these enemies, Wood, which is both the effect and cause of that excess of Water, and compel it to fight for Him against the other.

Thus, son, dealeth He; and the Fire kindleth the Wood, and the heat thereof driveth the Water afar off. Yet this Water is a cunning adversary, and He strengthened Wood against Fire by impreg nating him with much of his own substance, as it were by spies in the citadel of an ally that is not wholly trusted. Now then therefore what must the Magician do? He must first expel utterly Water from Wood by an invocation of the Fire of the Sun our Fat her.

As all of you should know, we have entered a New Æon. A Higher Truth has been given to the World. This truth is waiting in readiness for all those who will consciously accept it, but it has to be realized before it is understood, and day by day those who have accepted this Law, and are trying to live it, realize more and more of its Beauty and Perfection. The new teaching appears strange at first; and the mind is unable to grasp more than a fragment of what it really means. Only when we are living the Law can that fragment expand in to the infinite conception of the whole. I want you to share with me one little fragment of this great Truth which has been made clear to me this Sun - Day morning: I want you to come with me - if you will - just across the border - line of the Old Æon and gaz e for a moment at the New. Then, if the aspect pleases you, you will stay, or, it may be, you will return for a while, but the road once opened and the Path plain, you will always be able to get there again, in the twinkling of an eye, just by readjusting your Inner sight to the Truth.

This is the central idea of the religion of the Old Æon, but we have left it behind us because although it seemed to be based on Nature (and Nature’s symbols are always true), yet we have outgrown this idea which is only apparently true in Nature. Since this great Ritual of Sacrifice and Death was conceived and perpetuated, we, through the observation of our men of science, have come to know that it is not the Sun which rises and sets, but the earth on which we liv e which revolves so that its shadow cuts us off from the sunlight during what we call night. The Sun does not die, as the ancients thought; it is always shining, always radiating Life and Life. Stop for a moment and get a clear conception of this Sun, how He is shining in the early morning, shining at mid - day, shining in the evening, and shining at night. Have you got this idea clearly in your minds? You have stepped out of the Old Æon and into the New. Now let us consider what has happened. In order to get this mental picture of the ever shining Sun, what did you do? You identified yourself with the Sun. You stepped out of the consciousness of this planet; and for a moment you had to consider yourself as a Solar Being. Then why step back again? You may h ave done so involuntarily, because the Light was so great that it seemed as Darkness. But do it again, this time more fully, and let us consider what the changes in our concept of the Universe will be.

Then, from this height we look back upon the little planet Earth, of which we, a moment ago, were part, and think of ours elves as shedding our Light upon all those individuals we have called our brothers and sisters, the slaves that serve. But we do not stop there. Imagine the Sun concentrating His rays for a moment on one tiny spot, the Earth. What happens? It is burnt u p, it is consumed, it disappears. But in our Solar Consciousness is Truth, and though we glance for a moment at the little sphere we have left behind us, and it is no more, yet there is “that which remains.” What remains? What has happened? We realize t hat “every man and every woman is a star.” We gaze around at our wider heritage, we gaze at the Body of Our Lady Nuit. We are not in darkness; we are much nearer to Her now. What (from the little planet) looked like specks of light, are now blazing like other great Suns, and these are truly our brothers and sisters, whose essential and Starry nature we had never before seen and realized. These are the ‘remains’ of those we thought we had left behind. There is plenty of room here, each one travels in His true Path, all is joy. Now, if you want to step back into the Old Æon, do so.

In other papers the joy and glory of those who have accepted the Book of the Law as the sole rule of life is largely, though never fully, explained; and we will not here recapitulate the same. SECOND HOUSE 45 . All Brethren who may fall into indigence have a right to the direct assistance of the Order up to the full amount of fees and subscriptions paid by them up to the time of application. This will be reg arded as a loan, but no interest will be charged upon it. That this privilege may not be abused, the Grand Tribunal will decide whether or no such application is made in good faith.

There they will be able to make the personal acquaintance of members of the higher Grades, learn of the deeper workings of the Order, obtain the benefit of personal instruction, and in all ways fit themselves for advancement. 50 . Brethren of advanced years and known merit who desire to follow the religious life may be asked to reside permanently in s uch houses. 51 . In the higher degrees Brethren have the right to reside in our Profess - Houses for a portion of every year; as shown: — VI°. Two weeks  VII°. Two months G.T. One month.  S.G.C. Three months. P.R.S. Six week.  VIII°. Six months. 52 . Mem bers of the IX°, who share among themselves the whole property of the Order according to the rules of that degree, may, of course, reside there permanently. Indeed, the house of every Brother of this grade is, ipso facto , a Profess - House of the Order. FIF TH HOUSE 53 .

The perfect freedom and security afforded by the Law allows the characters of all Brethren to expand to the very limits of the ir nature, and the great joy and gladness with which they are constantly overflowing make them the best of companions. “They shall rejoice, our chosen; who sorroweth is not of us.

CONCERNING THE LAW OF THELEMA An Epistle written to Professor L — B — K — who also himself waited for the New Æon, concerning the O . T .

My Dear Sir, — Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. I was glad to receive your letter of inquiry with regard to the Message of the Master Therion. It struck you naturally enough that on the su rface there is little distinction between the New Law and the canon of Anarchy; and you ask, “How is the Law to be fulfilled in the case of two boys who want the same orange?” But since only one boy (at most) can eat the orange, it is evident that one of them is mistaken in supposing that it is essential to his Will to eat it. The question is to be decided in the good old way by fighting for it. All that we ask is that the fighting be done chivalrously, with respect to the courage of the vanquished. “As brothers fight ye!” In other words, there is only this difference from our present state of society, that manners are improved. There are many persons who are naturally slaves, who have no stomach to fight, who tamely"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 228 yield all to any one strong enough to take it. This also is understood and provided for in The Book of the Law : “the slaves shall serve.” But it is possible for any apparent slave to prove his mastery by fighting his oppressors, even as now; but he has this additional chance in our syste m, that his conduct will be watched with kindly eye by our authorities, and his prowess rewarded by admission to the ranks of the master - class. Also, he will be given fair play. You may now ask how such arrangements are possible. There is only one soluti on to this great problem. It has always been admitted that the ideal form of government is that of a “benevolent despot,” and despotisms have only fallen because it is impossible in practice to assure the goodwill of those in power. The rules of chivalry , and those of Bushido in the East, gave the best chance to develop rulers of the desired type. Chivalry failed principally because it was confronted with new problems; today we know perfectly what those problems were, and are able to solve them. It is g enerally understood by all men of education that the general welfare is necessary to the highest development of the particular; and the troubles of America are in great part due to the fact that the men in power are often utterly devoid of all general educ ation. I would call your attention to the fact that many monastic orders, both in Asia and in Europe, have succeeded in surviving all changes of government, and in securing pleasant and useful lves for their members. But this has been possible only becaus e restricted life was enjoined. However, there were orders of military monks, like the Templars, who grew and prospered exceedingly. You recall that the Order of the Temple was only overthrown by a"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"LIBER CLXI 229 treacherous coup d’état on the part of a King and of a P ope who saw their reactionary, obscurantist, and tyrannical programme menaced by those knights who did not scruple to add the wisdom of the East to their own large interpretation of Christianity, and who represented in that time a movement towards the ligh t of learning and of science, which has been brought to fruition in our own times by the labours of the Orientalist from Von Hammer - Purgstall and Sir William Jones to Professer Rhys Davids and Madame Blavastsky, to say nothing of such philosophers as Schop enhauer, on the one hand; and by the heroic efforts of Darwin, Huxley, Tyndall, and Spencer, on the other. I have no sympathy with those who cry out against property, as if what all men desire were of necessity evil; the natural instinct of every man is to own, and while man remains in this mood, attempts to destroy property must not only be nugatory, but deleterious to the community. There is no outcry against property where wisdom and kindness administer it. The average man is not so unreasonable as the demagogue, for his own selfish ends, pretends to be. The great nobles of all time have usually been able to create a happy family of their dependents, and unflinching loyalty and devotion have been their reward. The secret has been principally this, tha t they considered themselves noble in nature as well as name, and thought it foul shame to themselves if any retainer met unnecessary misfortune. The upstart of today lacks this feeling; he must constantly try to prove his superiority by exhibiting his po wer, and harshness is his only weapon. In any society where each person has his allotted place, and that a place with its own special honour, mutual respect and self - respect are born. Every man is in his own way a king, or at least heir to some kingdom. We have"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 230 many examples of such society today, notably universities and all associations of sport. No. 5 in the Harvard crew does not turn round in the middle of the race and reproach No. 4 for being merely No. 4 ; nor do the pitcher and catcher of a crack baseball nine revile each other because their tasks are different. It is to be noted that wherever teamwork is necessary social cooperation is essential. The common soldier is invested with a uniform as well as his officer, and in any properly trained ar my he is taught his own canons of honour and self - respect. This feeling, more than mere discipline or the possession of weapons, makes the soldier more than a match morally for a man not so clothed in proper reverence for humself and his profession. Unive rsity men who have passed through some crisis of hardship or temptation have often told me that the backbone of their endurance was the “old shop.” Much of this is evidently felt by those who talk of re - establishing the old trade guilds. But I fear I dig ress. I have, however, now placed before you the main points of my thesis. We need to extend to the whole of society the peculiar feeling which obtains in our most successful institutions, such as the services, the universities, the clubs. Heaven and hel l are states of mind; and if the devil be really proud, his hell can hurt him little. It is this, then, that I desire to emphasize: those who accept the New Law, the Law of the Æon of Horus, the crowned and conquering child who replaces in our theogony the suffering and despairing victim of destiny, the Law of Thelema, which is Do What Thou Wilt, those who accept it (I say) feel themselves immediately to be kings and queens."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"LIBER CLXI 231 “Every man and every woman is a star” is the first statement of the Book of the La w .

The though occurred also to our founder, and I will endeavour to put before you the skeleton of his plan to avert such misfortune (or at least such ordeal) from his adherents. In the first place, he availed himself of a certain organization of which h e was offered control, namely the O . T . O . This great Order accepted the Law immediately, and was justified by the sudden and great revival of its activities. The Law was given to our founder twelve years ago; the O . T . O . came into his hands eight years lat er, in the vulgar year 1912. It must not be supposed that he was idle during the former period, but he was very young, and had no idea of taking practical measures to extend the dominion of the Law: he pursued his studies. However, with the sudden growth of the O . T . O . from 1912 e.v. onward, he began to perceive a method of putting the Law into general practice, of making it possible for men and women to live in accordance with the precepts laid down in the Book of the Law , and to accomplish their wills; I do not say to gratify their passing fancies, but to do that for which they were intended by their own high destiny.

I am well aware that from this point you could draw me subtly over the tiger - trap of the Freewill Controversy; you would make it difficult for me even to say that it is better to fulfil one’s destiny consciously an d joyously than like a stone; but I am on my guard. I will return to plain politics and common sense. Our Founder, then, when he thought over this matter from a purely practical standpoint, remembered those institutions with which he was familiar, which f lourished. He bethought him of monasteries like Monsalvat, of universities like Cambridge, of golf clubs like Hoylake, of social clubs like the Cocoa - Tree, of co - operative societies, and, having sojourned in America, of Trusts. In his mind he expanded ea ch of these to its n th power, he blended them like the skilled chemist that he was, he considered their excellences and their limitations; in a word, he meditated profoundly upon the whole subject, and he concluded with the vision of a perfect society. He saw all men free, all men wealthy, all men respected; and he planted the seed of his Utopia by handing over his own house to the O . T . O . , the organization which should operate his plan, under certain conditions. What he had foreseen occurred; he had posses sed one house; by surrendering it he became owner of a thousand houses. He gave up the world, and found it at his feet.

It will be seen that our founder, born as he was to the purple, has fulfilled it. I have not the volume at my side, living as I am this hermit life in New Hampshire, but its gist is that Kings and Popes have not power to redeem the world because they surround themselves with splendour and dignity. They pos sess all that other men desire, and therefore their motives are suspect. If any person of position, says Lévi, insists upon living a life of hardship and inconvenience when he could do otherwise, then men will trust him, and he will be able to execute his projects for the general good of the commenwealth. But he must naturally be careful not to relax his austerities as his power increases. Make power and splendour incompatible, and the social problem is solved. “Who is that ragged man gnawing a dry crust by yonder cabin?” “That is the President of the Republic.” Where honour is the only possible good to be gained by the exercise of power, the man in power will strive only for honour. The above is an extreme case; no one need go so far nowadays; and it i s important that the President should have been used to terrapin and bécasse flambé before he went into politics. You will ask how this is operated, and how the system inaugurated by him works. It is simple. Authority and prestige in the Order are absolu te, but while the lower grades give increase of privilege, the higher give increase of service. Power in the Order depends, therefore, directly on the willingness to aid others. Tolerance also is taught in the"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 234 higher grades; so that no man can be even an Inspector of the Order unless he be equally well disposed to all classes of opinion. You may have six wives or none; but if you have six, you are required not to let them talk all at once, and if you have none, you are required to refrain from boring peo ple with dithyrambs upon your own virtue. This tolerance is taught by a peculiar course of instruction whose nature it would be imprudent as well as impertinent to disclose; I will ask you to accept my word that it is efficient. With this provision, it is easy to see that intolerance and snobbery are impossible; for the example set by members of the universally respected higher grades is against this. I may add that members are bound together by participation in certain mysteries, which lead to a syntheti c climax in which a single secret is communicated whose nature is such as to set at rest for ever all division on those fertile causes of quarrel, sex and religion. The possession of this secret gives the members entitled to it such calm of authority that the perfect respect which is their due never fails them. Thus, then, you see brethren dwelling together in unity; and you wonder whether the lust of possession may not cause division. On the contrary, this matter has been the excellent cause of general p rosperity. In the majority of cases property is wasted. One has six houses; three remain unlet. One has 20 per cent. of the stock of a certain company; and is frozen out by the person with 51 per cent.

Each one is free to do as he will; and the luxury of this enjoyment is such that he becomes careful to avoid disturbance of the equal right of others. Yet, the authority of the Abbot of the house being supreme, any failure to observe this rule is met with appropriate energy. The case cannot really arise, unless circumstasnces are quite beyond the ordi nary, for the period of hospitality is strictly limited, and extensions depend on the goodwill of the Abbot. Naturally, as it takes all sorts to make a world — and we rejoice in that diversity which makes our unity so exquisite a"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 238 miracle — some Profess - Houses will suit one person, some another.

AN INTIMATION WITH REFERENCE TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE ORDER Any province of the O . T . O . is governed by the Grand Master and those to whom he delegates his authorit y, until such time as the Order is established, which is the case when it possesses eleven or more Profess - Houses in the province. Then the regular constitution is automatically promulgated. The quotation is slightly adapted from an address in one of the rituals. This is the Constitution and Government of our Holy Order: by the study of its Balance you may yourself come to apprehension of how to rule your own life. For, in True Things, all are but images of one another; man is but a map of the universe, a nd Society is but the same on a large scale. Learn then that our Holy Order has but Three True Grades; as it is written in The Book of the Law : The Hermit, The Lover, and the Man of Earth. It is but for convenience that these grades have been separated int o Three Triads. The Third Triad consists of the degrees from Minerval to Prince of Jerusalem. The Minerval degree is a Prologue to the First; the degrees subsequent to the Third but pendants to it. In this, the Man of Earth series, there are then but Three Degrees; and these Three are One. The Man of Earth takes no share in the Government of the Order; for he is not yet called upon to give his life to it in service; and with us Government is Service, and nothing else. The Man of Earth is therefore in much the position of the Plebian in Rome in the time of Menenius Agrippia. But there is this marked difference; that every Man of Earth is encouraged and expected to push on to the next stage. In order that the feelings of the general body may be represented, the Men of Earth choose four persons, two men and two women, from among themselves, to stand continually before the face of the Supreme and Holy King, serving him day and night. These persons must not be of higher rank than the Second Degree; they must v olunteer for this service at the conclusion of that"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 242 ceremony; and therefore they give up their own prospect of advancement in the Order for one year, that they may serve their fellows. This is then the first lesson in our great principle, the attainment o f honour through renunciation. The degree of Knights of East and West is but a bridge between the first and second series; but it is important, for in that grade a new pledge - form must be signed, and the new Knight vowed to devote his life to the Establish ment of the Law of Thelema. The members of the Fifth Degree are responsible for all that concerns the Social Welfare of the Order. This grade is symbolically that of beauty and harmony; it is the natural stopping - place of the majority of men and women; fo r to proceed farther, as will appear, involves renunication of the sternest kind. Here then is all joy, peace, well - being on all planes; the Sovereign Prince Rose Croix is attached equally to the higher and the lower, and forms a natural link between them . Yet let him look to it that his eyes are set on high. In this degree the Most Wise Sovereign of each chapter will appoint a committee of four persons, two men and two women, to arrange for all social gatherings, banquets, dances, the performance of play s, and similar pleasures. They will also endeavour to promote harmony among the Brethren in all possible ways, and to compose any disputes by tact and friendliness without formal appeal being made to any more authoritative tribunal. The next grade, that w hich lies between the Fifth and Sixth Degrees, is called the Senate. This is the first of the governing bodies, properly speaking, and here we begin to insist upon Renunciation. For within this body is the Electoral College of the O . T . O . The principle o f popular election is a fatal folly; its results are visible in every so - called democracy. The elected man is always the mediocrity; he is the safe man, the sound man, the man who displeases the majority less than any other; and therefore never the genius , the man of progress and illumination. This Electoral College consists of Eleven Persons in each country. It has full control of the affairs of the Men of Earth, appointing Lodge Masters at will. It has however no authority over Chapters of Rose Croix. Persons who wish to be appointed to this College by the Supreme and Holy King must volunteer for the office. The appointment is for Eleven Years. Volunteers must renounce for that period all further progress in the Order. They must give evidence of fir st - rate ability in (i) Some branch of athletics. (ii) Some branch of learning. They must also possess a profound general knowledge of history and of the art of government, with some attention to philosophy in general."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"LIBER CXCIV 243 They must each live in solitude, wi thout more than the necessary speech even to casual neighbours, serving themselves in all respects, for three months continuously, once at least in every two years. The President will summon them at the four seasons of the year, and if necessary at other times, when they will deliberate upon the affairs placed in their charge. All applications to pass to the Fifth Degree must receive their sanction. Appeal from their decisions may however be made to the Supreme Council. The Sixth Degree is an executive o r military body, and represents the temporal power of the Supreme and Holy King. Each member is amenable to military discipline. Singly or in concert with his comrades, each Knight is vowed to enforce the descisions of authority. The Grade of Grand Inqui sitor Commander follows. Here every member has a right to a seat on the Grand Tribunal, which body decides all disputes and complaints which have not been composed by the Chapters of Rose Croix or the Lodge Masters. Its verdicts are without appeal, unles s a member of the Electoral College give sanction to take the case to the Areopagus of the Eighth Degree. All members of the Order, even of higher grades, are subject to the Grand Tribunal. The next grade is that of Prince of the Royal Secret. Every membe r of this degree is devoted to the Propagation of the Law in a very special manner; for this grade is the first in which the Beginning of the Inmost Secret is declared openly. He will therefore, by his personal exertions, induce one hundred and eleven per sons to join the Order, before he may proceed to the Seventh Degree, except by special order from the Supreme and Holy King. The Seventh Degree is, in military language, the Great General Staff of the Army of the Sixth Degree. From its members the Supreme and Holy King appoints a Supreme Grand Council. This Council is charged with the government of the whole of the Second Triad, or Lovers. All members of the Seventh Degree travel as Sovereign Grand Inspectors General of the Order, and report, on their own initiative, to the Supreme and Most Holy King, as to the condition of all Lodges, and Chapters; to the Supreme Council, on all affairs of the Second Triad; and to the Electoral College, on those of the Third. The Eighth Degree is a Philosophical Body. It s members, being fully instructed in the Principles of the Order, save in one point only, devote themselves to the understanding of what they have learned in their initiation. They have power to reverse the decisions of the Grand Tribunal, and to compose all conflicts between any of the governing bodies. And this they do upon the great principles of philosophy. For it will often occur that there is a contention between two parties, both of whom are right from their own point of view. This is so importan t that an illustration is"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 244 desirable. A man is smitten with leprosy; is it right that men should circumscribe his liberty by isolating him from his fellows? Another holds back land or some other necessity from the common use; is he to be compelled to surr ender it? Such cases of difficulty involve deep philosophical principles; and the Areopagus of the Eighth Degree is charged with the duty of resolving them in accordance with the great principles of the Order. Before the face of the Areopagus stands an in dependent Parliament of the Guilds. Within the Order, irrespective of grade, the members of each craft, trade, science , or profession form themselves into a Guild, make their own laws, and prosecute their own good, in all m atters pertaining to their labour and means of livelihood. Each Guild chooses the man most eminent in it to represent it before the Areopagus of the Eighth Degree; and all disputes between the various Guilds are argued before that Body, which will decide according to the grand principles of the Order. Its decisions pass for ratification to the Sanctuary of the Gnosis, and thence to the Throne. Epopts and Pontiffs of this exalted grade are bound to live in isolation for four consecutive months in every yea r, meditating the mysteries revealed to them. The Ninth Degree — the Sanctuary of the Gnosis — is synthetic. The prime duty of its members is to study and practice the theurgy and thaumaturgy of the grade; but in addition they must be prepared to act as direc t representatives of the Supreme and Most Holy King, radiating his light upon the whole world. Yet, from the nature of their initiation, they must veil their glory in a cloud of darkness. They move unseen and unrecognized among the youngest of us, subtly and loftily leading us into the holy ineffable mysteries of the True Light. The Supreme and Most Holy King is appointed by the O.H.O. His is the ultimate responsibility for all within his holy kingdom. The succession to the high office of the O.H.O. is d ecided in a manner not here to be declared; but this you may learn, O Brother Magician, that he may be chosen even from the grade of a Minerval. And herein lieth a most sacred Mystery. The Electoral College possesses one most singular power. Every eleven years, or in the case of a vacancy occuring, they choose two persons from the Ninth Degree, who are charged with the duty of Revolution. It is the business of these persons constantly to criticse and oppose the acts of the Supreme and Most Holy King, whe ther or not they personally approve of them. Should he exhibit weakness, bodily, mental, or moral, they are empowered to appeal to the O.H.O. to depose him but they, alone of all the members of the Order, are not eligible to the Succession."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"LIBER CXCIV 245 The O.H.O., as the supreme authority in the Order, will act, in such an emergency, as he may see fit. He may himself be removed from office, but only by the unanimous vote of all the members of the Tenth Degree. There are certain important financial obligations in vari ous grades. The Electoral College of the Senate is vowed to poverty. All property, earnings, or salaries are vested in or paid over to the Grand Treasurer General. The members subsist on the charity of the Order, which is extended to them in accordance w ith their original rank in life. These remarks apply equally to the Supreme Grand Council and all higher degrees. In the Seventh Degree it is a qualification to vest some real property in the Order; and no one is admitted to this grade without this prelim inary. Those members of the Order who have given all to it must obtain the money for their initiation fees and subscriptions from the Third Triad, whose honour is thus concerned in the unselfish support of those who have abandoned all for their sakes. The Grand Treasurer General is appointed by the Supreme and Most Holy King; he may be a member of any grade whatever; but he must, on accepting office, take the vow of poverty. His authority is absolute in all financial matters; but he is responsible to, and may be removed at will by, the Supreme and Most Holy King. He will appoint a committee to assist hium and advise him in his work; and he will usually select one person from each of the governing bodies of the Order. Such is a brief outline of the governme nt of the O . T . O . It combines monarchy with democracy: it includes aristocracy, and conceals even the seeds of revolution, by which alone progress can be effected. Thus we balance the Triads, uniting the Three in One; thus we gather up all the threads of human passion and interest, and weave them into an harmonious tapestry, subtly and diligently with great art, that our Order may seem an ornament even to the Stars that are in the Heavens at Night. In our rainbow - coloured texture we set forth the glory of the whole Universe. See to it, brother Magician, that thine own thread be strong, and pure, and of a colour brilliant in itself, yet ready to mingle in all beauty with those of thy brethren!"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 246 THE GRADES OF THE O.

This book is one of the most g lorious blasphemies ever printed. I have long recognized in Alexander Harvey one of those extremely rare types of genius, of which, curiously enough, America seems to have a monopoly. The United States have not produced any all - round men of the first class , but they have produced quite a number of what I may call, without any intent of disparagement, monsters. Morphy's games of chess are entirely sui generis . He was different not only in kind, but in degree, from all other masters, and this, owing to th e peculiar nature of the game of chess, resulted in the complete over - turning of the theory of the game. In chess problems, Sam Loyd and W. A. Shinkman displayed a precisely similar quality. Their problems are not well rounded and balanced, like those of o ther masters of the art. They are comparable with nothing else. One feels the emotion of a naturalist familiar with all other fauna who should suddenly be introduced to Australian zoology. In art, America has George Grey Barnard, whose Lincoln is like no o ther type of statue ever moulded. In vaudeville, we have Eva Tanguay, of whom I have already written in terms of no little enthusiasm. While other variety artists are like different vintages of Burgundy, Claret, Port, Champagne, and other wines, she breaks the entire series by producing cocaine. In literature, there are Poe and Whitman. Neither of these great men had the broad base of education. They have shot up by the mutation of a spiritual De Vries. Alexander Harvey reminds me constantly of Poe, but he is a Poe without the element of tragedy or morbidity; while his comic spirit is more ineffably delightful than that of any other human being, past or present, with whom I am familiar. Poe's comedy was labored, clumsy, hard - working foolery. Alexander Harvey 's is perfectly spontaneous, and of such exquisite delicacy and acuteness, that he reminds one of the bistoury of a crazy surgeon. In Shelley's Elopement , he has taken Bernard Shaw's formula for creating absurdity. It is a very simple formula. One refl ects that Caesar was not a hero to his valet, and that sometimes his toga set awry. The joke consists in making the heroic figure ridiculous by making him real. Shaw's method is mere clowning. Alexander Harvey's is perfect artistic perception of the realit ies of life. In this book he shows you the characters concerned with the absolute fidelity of a Balzac."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 278 One understands instantly that one is actually present at these scenes of Shelley's life. The atmosphere of the first four lustres of the 19th century, with its affectations and prejudices, is the breath of our lungs as we read.

And this is the secret of life. This is the sublime and sacred jest of t he Gods, to take the gross, the stupid, the banal, and suddenly to manifest a flower. For this reason I wish to put it upon record, that I think that Alexander Harvey is the greatest realist alive to - day. The dull rationalist dribbles of cause and effect, neither perceiving the one, nor understanding the other. Alexander Harvey has the mystery of Pan. ALEXANDER TABASCO. BEYOND LIFE. By JAMES BRANCH CABELL. Robert M. McBride & Co. FOR four years I have been cast away upon a desert island, and I am seri ously alarmed at beholding a footprint in the sand. As a matter of fact, the goats have acclimatized me to most things, and I take up the task of reviewing this book with all the more confidence, because the publisher begs me to abuse it. I dislike publi shers intensely, and I am not going to abuse books merely because they ask me to, and even if I had wanted to abuse this book, I should have found myself in the position of Balaam. It is an extraordinarily good book. I quite understand why the Times s ays that Mr. Cabell is “one of the most pretentiously attitudinizing of American authors.” The Times has had some. But what does the Times matter? It used to be the thunderer. It is now an imitation of thunder which only Martial could describe, or an a mbitious Marine imitate. What in God’s name is an American author to do? He has got such a dreadful milieu that it is almost impossible to discover him. I never blamed the cock who failed to notice the pearl in the dung hill. Fortunately, I had Mr. Men cken to indicate Mr. Cabell. Thus, I was able to read the book as if I knew nothing of its surroundings, which is of course the only way to read a book. It is admirably written. It is a defence of romance. What does it matter that it is written among a people who think that romance means Robert W. Chambers? There are extraordinary things in this book. I do not think Mr. Cabell's irony so wonderful as his humour. He says, “The most prosaic of materialists proclaim that we are all descended from an insa ne fish, who somehow evolved the idea that it was his duty to live on land, and eventually succeeded in doing it.” Insane fish is right.

THE LADY WITH THE DOG and other Stories. THE DARLING and o ther Stories. THE WIFE and other Stories. THE DUEL and other Stories. THE WITCH and other Stories. Translated by CONSTANCE GARNETT. The Macmillan Co. I WAS sitting at dinner in the Brevoort with some fascinating friends when, thinking no harm, I men tioned Chekhov. A chic adolescent at the next table introduced himself. He could not really let such an occasion pass. It was so rare to hear any one speak of Chekhov. It was he who had introduced Chekhov to the notice of English readers. He almost reminde d me of what Dorian Grey used to say about Wonderful Boyhood. I thought of Keats' worst sonnet, and \"Chatterton, Marvellous Boy!\" But the chic adolescent, who was Mr. Robert Nichols, had a bullet in his neck, which explained the whole matter immediately to my satisfaction. Mr. Nichols also told me of how he was a great poet, of how he had started the war, or won it, or both. He said that his mother was called Mary, but that Vulgar report erred in saying that his father was named Joseph. Chekhov cannot hope to compete with this sort of thing. I forgot all about him. But I do wish I had one of Mr. Nichols’ books to review. However, here is the Macmillan Chekhov, and I maun e'en go to it. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Mr. Edward Garnett, with the banality which he has trained us to expect from him, remarks that “Chekhov has been termed the Russian Maupassant, and there are indeed several Vital resemblances between the outlook of the French and the Russian master.” Diving deeper into the commonplace, he co ntinues to bore us with remarks upon “the art of both these unflinching realists.” Constance Garnett, one presumes, undertook the hard work of translating Russian as a relief from the intolerable boredom of her pinchbeck husband. Thus an all - wise Providenc e brings good from evil, for she is an excellent translator, apt to catch the spirit of a masterpiece. Of course, Chekhov is the Russian Maupassant, for every Russian is under the curse of being a Russian something - European. There is nothing genuinely Rus sian in art or literature, because the Russian is in the ape stage of evolution. No matter how great his genius may be, it has to be cast in the mould of that which has been already shaped.

The art of Russia has always been either without art, or with art derived. Napoleon was probably in an extremely bad temper when he spoke of Saint Basil’s as “that mosque,” but it is a mosque. It is probably the greatest building in the world in its peculiar way, but that way is the way of the mosque, even more so than St. Mark’s or the cathedral at Granada. But the great Russians are not less because they have been compelled to wear civilized clothing. There is only one art purely Russian, and that is the ‘Russian Ballet, ’ which was not invented by Russians at all. The real Russian ballet is a savage mimicry of the Italian ballet. Have you not seen those uncut emeralds, the size of a walnut, through which the Tsars bored holes to wear them on a string? In its grossest stu pidities the Russian spirit is still childishly great. I suppose a Russian cook could make something tasty of Edward Garnett, as a Chinese cook makes masterpieces of puppy dogs. Chekhov is not to be judged at all by the standard of Guy de Maupassant. He is not to have his stories split up by our Garnetts or Barnetts or Darnetts into a. humorous b. indigenous c. historical — pastoral — comical etc. Each story is to be judged by itself. This is of course true of every work of art, and that is why critics are such a hang - dog race of marmots. But speaking as a marmot, which is, after all, the right of marmots, Article I in the Magna Charta of marmots, I may say that Chekhov was very much better when he was not thinking of Kopecks. He has turned out a dreadful l ot of bad work under the lash of the publisher. But at his best, in stories like The Witch, he is unsurpassed. One feels a positive anguish that one has not met that witch 1 Even a Gladys Belasco or a Lea de L’ame Morte — or Del Amor? — can hardly console one for her loss. Les amours nes de l’imagination — either one must smoke opium or hashish, or live in Russia, or allow oneself to be fooled by a Russian woman, or read Chekhov. This is an admirable edition of Chekhov, but how is it, while I am on another s ubject, that a firm of the standing of Macmillan can publish Chekhov (either without fear of prosecution, or because they have squared the judges) with apparent good hope of selling a great number of copies, while a native Chekhov like Alexander Harvey fin ds it difficult to get a publisher, and all the other American Chekhovs can never get a story printed?

The authoress of the MS. claims that she was the wife of an angel. She expounds at the greatest length the philosophy connected with this thesis. Her learning is enormous. She finds traces of similar beliefs in every country in the world, and (having a similar experience of her own) she ca n hardly be blamed for arguing that one thing confirms the other. Mr. Schroeder is quite logical in calling her paper An Unintentional Contribution to the Erotogenetic Interpretation of Religion, but commits the errors of petitio principii and non distrib utio medii with the most exquisite nonchalance. Only a lawyer could be so shameless. He begs the question with regard to this particular case, assuming that her relation with the angel was pure hallucination, of which he has no evidence whatever. He argu es that, since one person both loves and is religious, religion is nothing but a morbid manifestation of the sexual instinct. One does not have even to disagree with him to see how worthless is his reasoning. As a matter of fact, I do half agree with him i n my calmer moments in a general way, but the conclusion can be carried a step further. When you have proved that God is merely a name for the sex instinct, it appears to me not far to the perception that the sex instinct is God. This particular MS. is absolutely sane in every line. The fact that the woman committed suicide twelve or fifteen years afterwards is no more against the sanity of the MS. than the suicide of Socrates proves that the Republic is merely the lucubration of a lunatic. I am very far from agreeing with all that this most talented woman sets forth in her paper, but she certainly obtained initiated knowledge of extraordinary depth. She seems to have had access to certain most concealed sanctuaries. I should personally be inclined t o attribute her suicide rather to the vengeance of the guardians of those palaces than to any more obvious cause. She has put down statements in plain English which are positively staggering. This book is of incalculable value to every student of occult matters. No Magick library is complete without it. BAPHOMET. PAVANNES AND DIVISIONS. By EZRA POUND. ‘My Country, ’tis o f thee.’ IT is by the happiest chance that Mr. Ezra Pound's Pavannes and Divisions should have come just when Americanism is in suc h vogue. For Mr. Pound is, if one may be pardoned so bold a phrase in a mere review, a hundred per cent. American. He has all the American craving for rules, all the American belief in teaching and training, all the American itch for definition; he abounds in the curiously national characteristic that has made America the land of those Colleges and Correspondence Schools through which the earnest citizen may learn how to converse as though he had seen the world, make $125 a week,"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 282 never forget any name or te lephone number once heard, write a short story or a Broadway Revue, draw comic cartoons, manage his wife, never look more than thirty - five, and live to be a hundred.

I suppose, because he lives in Europe, because he has written vers libre , because he has praised a man with a name like Gaudier - Brzeska. These trifling accidents do not in the least affect the essential Ame ricanism of what he has done, and of the way in which he has done it. He began by following rules, and now he is making them. According to precept he ‘copied masterwork, and proceeded to his own Composition.’ He has taken himself with the seriousness of Whittier and Tupper and Howells and Mr. Winston Churchill. His reverence for the technique and toil of art is Bostonian. When he is not either observing the law or laying it down, he is as ill at ease as a pedagogue in a bar - room. His American Purita nism nibbles his ear all the time. His hatred of what he calls rhetoric, his mania for the ‘clear’ and the ‘hard,’ his earnest belief that poetry must never be a ‘pastime,’ all derive from the American conscience; and so does his distaste for the Puritan poet Milton, whose extreme sensuality avenged its suppression magnificently unawares in the greater Miltonic lines. But Mr. Pound’s Puritanism is too distantly inherited Like modern American Puritanism, it is a melancholy survival, drained of creative or destructive power. It is not a fierce and terrible thing, any more than the Puritanism of the modern New Englander is fierce and terrible. It nibbles at Mr. Pound, but it does not devour him; it has not strength left for that. It is not a Demogorgon, bu t a schoolmaster, not a victim or a priest. He has all the schoolmaster’s love of the chalk and the blackboard, he has the true pedagogic flair for dogma, the true pedagogic knack of rapping it out ‘clear and hard’ on the board, with the ‘expert’ touch un der which the chalk never crumbles. No writer, you would think, could be more acceptable to the American mind, for no nation in the world believes in the schoolmaster and his methods as America believes in them, no nation venerates pedagogy so profoundly. ‘But what is the good of style,’ I was asked yesterday, ‘if it cannot be taught?’ Mr. Pound of course would not say that a man can be taught to be a poet or a prose - writer, but he is so pathetically at the mercy of ‘artistic principles,’ he is so Pur itanically conscious of artistic right and wrong, that he can never give us so much as a half - holiday from the Ethical Culture Hall of his aesthetics. Whether he is making a creative appearance, as in Pavannes, or a critical appearance, as in Divisions, he has to impose upon us the propinquity of ferule and desk. Either by example or precept he must enforce the doctrine: `Look in"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"REVIEWS 283 your note - book and write.' And like all doctrinaires, Mr. Pound is exposed to the besetting sin of the half - true or the maybe - tru e platitude. ‘The mastery of any art is the work of a lifetime,’ for example. How about the art of lyric poetry, how about Sappho and Keats and Swinburne's early work? Again, we must have ‘direct treatment,’ Mr. Pound affirms, and we must ‘use absolutel y no word that does not contribute to the presentation.’ Such pronouncements are either platitudes or untrue, they either mean nothing that can’t be taken for granted or a good deal that can’t. The last of these ‘principles’ is that one should ‘compose i n the sequence of the musical phrase, not in the sequence of a metronome.’ If this means that ‘My brother John was nine in May; And I'll be twelve on New Year's day’ is not fine poetry, let’s shake hands: but if it means that ‘Till the maid, knowing her m other near, Sobs with love, aching with sweet fear’ are not poetic lines, it means nonsense. In either case, the dictum is pointless, it leads nowhere at all. We do not need an official censure of crude and jingly rime, and we need something more than the mere comparison of the regular sequence of rime to the sequence of a metronome to disparage the genius of those great poets who happened not to write free verse. Mr. Pound himself in the Pavannes tries rime as a ‘diversion.’ L’homme Moyen Sensuel onc e again confirms the impression of him as a serious schoolmaster, and as an American. For he relaxes consciously, he is as conscious of his diversion as the schoolmaster is of the Norfolk suit donned for a game of golf or a fishing expedition or a trip to Paris; and in his treatment of humour as a thing by itself, a thing in a separate compartment of its own, he is intensely American, American a l’outrance . Stark Realism , another of the Pavannes pieces, proclaims this same deliberate and detached American humour, a humour that is no salt for sprinkling, but is stocked in chunks to be made a whole meal of at a time. Stark Realism might have got into The Smart Set if the manuscript had been sent there and had happened upon a hospitable editorial mood. L’ho mme Moyen Sensuel is in its way a more striking affair, because the attempt to spring is so evident that one is positively startled by its not coming off. You wonder where the author has landed; and you find, quite surprisingly, that he has not landed at all. The verse is so Byronic in its demeanour that you feel there must be barbs in it somewhere; it is really a shock not to discover a single one. There is a profoundly American phrase that recurs to the reader of this book of Mr. Pound’s — ‘going through the motions.’ The author ‘goes through the motions’ not only in L'homme Moyen Sensuel: he is always making you"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 284 think he is about to do something, then he never does it. Take any of the first four Pavannes pieces. There are all the preliminaries, but ne ver the achievement. The most elaborate and painstaking preparations have been made for Mr. Pound’s marriage with his Art, but alas! the union has never been consummated. Yet even about his sterility there is something engaging. He is much too American f or any Englishman ever to dislike him. The Americans who rile us are the ones who are not American enough. As it is impossible to be angry with the authentic professor or the authentic American, so it is impossible to be angry with Mr. Pound. For one th ing, what a simple wholesome American pleasure he culls from the use of French words and phrases! He, like all other real Americans and real professors, disarms by his naiveté, his earnestness, his industry, his patience. He is untiringly patient, both w ith other people and with himself. One sees clearly that he is a kind, and, I am sure, a good man. I do not speak ironically. This American goodness, this American patience are beautifully distinctive national qualities to which no sort of justice has y et been done by foreign observers. They should be more widely known: and Mr. Pound’s Americanism should be more widely known. LOUIS WILKINSON. EVOLUTION CRITICISED. By T. B. BISHOP. Oliphants Ltd. BLOODY BILL is commonly supposed to have been somewha t severe with the Belgians. But only the `spurlos versenkt' suggestion of an admittedly insane agent of his approaches the maniacal savagery of I Samuel xv, 3, and by no means matches the undiscriminating imbecility of its ferocity: “Now go and smite Amale k, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.” Who is the author of this order? It is the father of Jesus Christ. “I and my father are one.” It is therefore the God of Wilhelm von Hohenzollern, the American people (if their newspapers lie not), and a very few particularly troglodytic Englishmen of whom Mr. T. B. Bishop is a striking ‘survival of the meanest.’ Mr. Bishop really believes that this tribal dem on designed butterflies, and put the rainbow in the sky as a guarantee that the world would never be destroyed by water. He even thinks that it once was destroyed by water! When any student of nature discovers beauty, or design, or evidence of intelligence , Mr. Bishop falls into a senile rage. He is not content with destroying his fellowman, with his wife, children, cattle, and so on; Mr. Bishop is not happy unless he is sure that they will all be roasted without cessation or hope."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"REVIEWS 285 In the meanwhile, Mr . Bishop writes a book to prove the truth of all this prehistoric nonsense. Mr. Bishop's intelligence is very far beneath the human level. For example, he actually maintains that the claws and teeth of predatory animals have been given to them out of kin dness towards their prey! You would think it was impossible for any one to miss the point of the argument that nature is cruel. The fact is that Mr. Bishop's ideas of kindness are a little crude, like his ideas of writing a book. This is not really a bo ok at all. It’s mere scissors and paste. Its main argument is that as two men of science have differed on some minute detail of theory, there is no value in science. He does not in the least understand the subject on which he is writing. He does not un derstand the canon of reason. He has only one idea, which is, that the Bible (authorized translation) is literally true in every detail. His great explanation of everything that seems a little peculiar is that it is the result of sin. He claims, however , that sin was caused by the devil, who was created by God, and that God foreknew and permitted all this, in order to inflict torture upon nearly everybody except Mr. Bishop. He would however deny furiously that the God who willingly and knowingly created the devil, was in any way responsible for him. This Kaiserlich - Chautauquamericanisch - Bishopisch God is therefore an illogical impossibility and absurdity. But this doesn't detract from the unmetaphysical conception of him as a monster. Mr. Bishop is one of the best known philanthropists in England. Let us see how he acts within his family circle. Here is a quotation from a bill of costs sent in to his nephew by the family solicitor. It should be understood that the nephew in question was at the ti me of the transaction entitled to a considerable sum of money which was in the hands of this solicitor, and that Mr. Bishop was aware of this: “Attending Mrs. Bishop when she informed us that Mr. Bishop had received a letter from you that you were ill and needed money and she asked whether Mr. Bishop would be safe in sending you out any and generally answering your inquiries. “Attending Mr. T. B. Bishop on his calling when he showed us the letter from you and stated that he was cabling you out £12.\" A gener ous impulse is sometimes regretted by the impulsive one. Mr. Bishop’s motto seems to be, “Safety First.” Many years ago, as stated in THE EQUINOX, Mr. Bishop worked his sister to death in order to spare himself the expense of a stenographer. Mr. Bishop is a man of considerable wealth, but he never allows it to injure his moral principles. The death of his sister left him with one other sister, and for her he professed the most unbounded devotion. As she lay dead in her house, he wrote long letters to h er son about One pound, three and tuppence that she owed to the grocer, sixteen and nine pence that she owed to the butcher, and so on. I suppose he had her buried by the parish, though I have no information on this point; but he was the residuary legatee of her estate, and any money expended in burying her would therefore have to"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 286 come ultimately out of his own pocket, which is not very nice to think of, when you are 78 years old, rich and honoured, and your last near relative is lying dead in her house. I think possibly that he may have paid a few shillings for a cheap coffin, for the subject seems to worry him very much. Two years later he is trying to swindle this nephew aforesaid out of some property, and one of the arguments which he uses is, that i f he gets this money to which he has no right, he will be able to have a stone put on the grave of his sister. I hope the readers of THE EQUINOX have been ignorant hitherto that there are any people like this Mr. Bishop; that they imagine the peasants in Zola's La Terre to be mostly imaginary: not that Zola's peasants are as disgusting as Mr. Bishop. He is certainly a very strong argument against evolution, though his book is not. After wearing out his sister Ada, finding himself faced with this expense of this stenographer aforesaid, he decided that it would be cheaper to get married. So he went to Llandudno; and, rather like Abraham when he found the ram caught in the thicket by its horns, he found a cow caught in the Children's Special Service Mission by her feet, which were exceptionally large, and took her as wife in name, and secretary and general servant in function. This female, however, developed an unsuspected quality. She made him shave, and Mr. Bishop, who had been going about London for for ty years looking like a most venerable old gentleman, was seen to be a monkey. He looked like a monkey so much that the local zoologists used to frequent the neighbourhood of his house on Sunday afternoon. We have also seen that he thinks like a monkey, the god whom he has made in his own image being more ferocious than a gorilla, and far less intelligent. What then are the differences between Mr. Bishop and a monkey? They are not obvious, and I do not think that any man of science will disagree that it is better to leave it to the monkeys to discover them. But if they insist that he is a Nuctanthropus, we must try again, and see if we cannot class him among the cockroaches.

HYSLOP, Ph.D. Proceedings of the American Society for Psychical Research, Vols. IX, X, XI. 1915; 1916; 1917. Three volumes HERE is a nice little piece of re ading for the occult student - some two thousand pages, weighing Lord knows how many pounds! And it contains some stuff. Volumes I and II are by Dr. Prince, and deal with the psychology of the case, its genesis and cure; Volume III is by Hyslop, and takes i t up — as we might have supposed — from the “spiritualistic” point of view, and endeavours to prove that the various personalities are not such at all, in reality, but probably “spirits,” who are “obsessing” the poor girl, and causing all the"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"REVIEWS 287 disturbance. Shad es of witchcraft and the New Testament — here is a joyous revival, in the Twentieth Century! We have a girl, Doris Fischer, born in 1889 (of German parents), who developed, in all, five distinct personalities, each of which received a special name. Bes ides the original “Doris,” we find “Sick Doris,” “Margaret,” and “Sleeping Margaret,” and “Sleeping Real Doris.” These five personalities are said to have shown varied characteristics (as is invariably the case) and to be essentially different, from the p sychological point - of - view. As usual, also, several of them developed as the result of emotional shock, and disappeared under hypnosis and psychological treatment; one by one they were eliminated, until only “Real Doris” survived, — with traces of “Sleeping Margaret” persisting, as a sort of undercurrent of reality. These names, of course, apply to the so - called varied personalities which appeared during their shufflings back and forth; that is, their alternate appearances. It must be admitted at once t hat Dr. Prince has made some interesting investigations in this curious case, and if we grant the reality of the facts, they have very considerable psychological interest. Of course, it is hard to prove that the whole thing is not a clever fraud. Girls o f the kind have a habit of playing such parts, because of the attention they thereby attract; but let us grant their reality, for the sake of the argument. We have, then, an abnormal individual, who needs treatment and cure; and the sooner cured the bette r! Now, at this point, our friends begin messing - about with “mediums,” and as the result, obtain an extraordinary amount of rubbish, wholly disconnected from the case, by which they try to prove that the alternating personalities were really “spirits”! Most of these messages were obtained through a “Mrs. Chenoweth” a medium who has figured largely in the Reports of the American Society, though Heaven only knows why, as she gives us a constant flow of the most terrible drivel which it is possible to con ceive. Looking through the so - called Reports on this medium, one is impressed with the idea that it is criminal to waste time, and the Society's money, obtaining such stuff, and criminal to keep pouring money down such a sink of Nothingness. What is the hold which this medium seems to have over the venerable Secretary of the Society? Is it more than a mere scientific interest? Are there subtler motives which cause the Head of the Psychical Movement in America to bow solemnly before the crude “Teachings” obtained through this evident fraud of a medium? Any common sense man - of the - world, reading this stuff, would form his own opinions, — for it is plain to see that, — by merely playing upon his vanity, and flattering him to the skies, this ‘medium’ has manage d to ingratiate herself so thoroughly with the noted Professor, that he has become blind to evidence, to facts, and to common sense.

Let us admit that “immortality” has now been proved; that Hyslo p’s Marvellous Medium has furnished the demonstration! We are to inherit the Kingdom of Heaven, and there assist the Angels in the compilation of English Grammars (let us hope) for the use of those who communicate through Mrs. Chenoweth! When one reads th rough stuff like this, one is driven to ask the question How can men of intelligence and learning, perhaps with skill in other lines of research, be driven to accept such nonsense as proof of anything beyond obvious fraud on the part of the “medium”? How can their sense of all that constitutes evidence be so lacking, — their judgment so at fault,as to accept this drivel as proof of “spirits”? One can form only the opinion — one seems driven to this conclusion — that it is the “will to believe” which has influen ced them in this manner — not the evidence itself, but their own warped and faulty judgment. If one analyzes the facts, he finds that practically all those who have advertised their belief in “Immortality” are men well along in life — practically all past sixty, and some of them many years older. Evidently, they are entering their second childhood. They are so concerned with saving their own souls, with unifying “Science and Religion,” with showing that they themselves are probably “Immortal,” that they h ave lost all sense of humour, of proportion, of evidence, of all these qualities which together constitute the truly scientific scholar. As they are getting along in life, and can no longer enjoy it, they are haunted by the Spectre of Annihilation; and to escape this, they grasp at any straw, accept any evidence, swallow any “facts,” given through a twopenny medium, which seem to afford even the slightest “evidence” for “survival.” The result is that they all accept such rubbish as that given above (which is part"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"REVIEWS 289 of the official record), and seriously claim that it affords them proof of survival - of Immortality!

The Macmillan Co. THERE is a dreadful wrapper by Boardman Robinson, but he probably needed the money. It is quite the right wrapper too. Ernest Poole has driven the tank of ignorance and vulgarity across the s teppes of Russia. Mr. Poole is not very deep, and he is exceptionally stagnant, with a thick green slime of New England prejudice on his surface. Even for a journalist he is appalling. Think of using words like “destructed”! It deserves what he calls “l e peine de mort.” His method is to accumulate details, none of which he understands. There is no hint of vision. There is no understanding of Russia. There is nothing but interviews with uninteresting people, whose consciousness does not in any way rep resent them, or, as we used to say in days of less complicated speech, who do not know what they are talking about. Has he no shame to blot the ‘scutcheon of the Pooes — the other scissors - knights of Savile Row?’ The book is interesting enough to any one wh o knows Russia even slightly, if only because there is a laugh on every page. Some old poet, I forget his name, remarked: “Some minds improve by travel, others rather Resemble copper wire or brass, Which gets the narrower by going farther.” The days of t he innocent God - help - me tourist seem to be done. The tourist of to - day has been bullied by the Y. M. C. A., in intervals between grafts, into moral responsibility and Christian earnestness, and all that sort of thing.

If the children of America are nurtured on the world's greatest story, it will be very nice for everybody in thirty years or so.

It is quite useless to try to relieve the symptoms of America. Willy Pogany is not Flaxman, but he is Flaxman enough for children, and now and again, as in the picture facing page 106 (and several others), he is Flaxman enough for nearly everybody. (You cannot expect an illustrator as such to be altogether Flaxman in an age where artists have to earn their living.) But it is impossible to give too much praise to the prose of Padraic Colum. It is simple enough for a child who has just learned to read. It is good enough for a book - worm - eaten hag like myself, sodden on Sterne and Swift.

IT is commonplace that Yvette Guilbert is the greatest artist of her period. It is a tragedy that her art happens to be ephemeral. The poignancy of such a realization is like that which one feels in the eternal Greek which Synge re - awakened in the wild Western world. I am thinking of Riders to the Sea . Experience dulls us; words are prostituted in the brothel of li fe. In Riders to the Sea , Synge says merely, “A man was drowned.” His genius sweeps away the cobwebs which time spins over the door of the cavern of our imagination. We realize the meaning of those words, “A man was drowned.” This power to make us feel is the divine thing in art. It is the creative force which answers “Yea” to the prophet's cynical, \"Lord, shall these dead bones live?\" Now this is exactly what Yvette Guilbert has done for song. She has not done it for one century only. She has made all tim e speak, give up its secret, to those who are capable to live in that divine air of the spirit which magazines, cocktails, and automobiles so easily pollute. I see in Yvette Guilbert not only an artist in the ordinary sense of the word, but an artist like Blake. Her preface on Time might have come from a Book of Ecclesiastes written by Solomon in the period before that in which he could not do it any more. Vanity of vanities? Contemptuously Yvette Guilbert replies, “Does life ever stop?” I am not a singer. T he technique of music is to me a mournful mystery. Yet in reading this book I find a thousand splendid counsels valid for all art. This book is more than “How to sing a song.” It is a philosophical treatise on How to do anything. The arts are one. The re is nothing but creation. As it is written, Love is the law, love under will. It is apprehension of this fact that makes artistry of any sort possible.

Her br ain is great enough to comprehend the minutiae of technique without in the smallest degree forgetting the fact that technique is absolutely worthless without genius. America is full of technicians, and I suspect that a number of geniuses are born. But the genius is strangled before he can acquire technique, and the technician unfortunately is not strangled at all. But any one who wants to do something worth doing and go to prison, should sleep with this book under his pillow, if he has a pillow. ALEISTER CR OWLEY. THE BOY WHO KNEW WHAT THE BIRDS SAID. By PADRAIC COLUM. The Macmillan Co. I THINK the grotesques of Dugald Stewart Walker are extremely charming. They go well with the subtle and tender genius of Padraic Colum. This is only a book for children . But thank God! there are some of us who are children still. This is only a book of fairy tales. But thank God! there are still some fairies. There are still a few people in the world who love beauty, and who are willing to fight for freedom. To read the newspapers, one would suppose that freedom was dead for ever. But with whatever bonds they will bind liberty, there will always be a few like Padraic Colum to keep Her torch alight. We may not be allowed to speak or write what we think, but life will alway s live in fairyland, and an hour cometh when the doors of fairyland will open, and the iron hero nursed on fairy milk will strike the tyrants dead. ALEISTER CROWLEY GITANJALI AND FRUIT - GATHERING. By RABINDRANATH TAGORE. The Macmillan Co. KNOWING that whatever is good in Rabindranath Tagore is due to the style of W. B.

The introdu ction begins, “A few days ago I said to a distinguished Bengali doctor of medicine, ‘I know no German.’” Apart from the question as to whether Silly Willy counts his fortune in marks or not, I was much distracted by his reference. I found myself back a gain in Teng - Yueh. We were sitting at dinner in the Consul’s house, when the messenger broke in to tell us that the Consul — who was away among some unruly tribes — was ill, perhaps dying. We jumped up, George Forrest, the botanist, and I, and made ready. We were delayed two hours in starting by the “distinguished Bengali doctor of medicine,” who needed to finish his rice.

But we pushed on, gasping, up hill, down dale, all through the n ight. Dawn broke, chill and grey, on the crest of a great mountain. Far in the distance I saw specks. I left my pony, and ran headlong down the slopes. I had got almost to the bottom of the hill when I saw the Consul's litter. Forrest ran forward. I t urned sadly back, for I saw that the Consul's legs were tied. I knew that he was dead. In that country where a thousand plagues hunt down mankind, it was most urgent that a medical man should certify the cause of death. How lucky that we had with us a d istinguished Bengali doctor of medicine! There was only one slight hitch in the programme. The moment that I told him that the Consul was dead, he turned his donkey and bolted for safety. Holy Kali, it might be an infectious disease! There was no point in chasing the creature at the moment. The matter could wait our return. We brought the Consul to his house and Forrest asked me to bring the doctor round. It was necessary to make an official report of the death, and the cause of the death. I went ro und to the house of the “distinguished Bengali doctor of medicine.” He was seated before a pyramid of rice. I attracted his attention by burying a whalebone cutting whip in the rolls of his fat. Between fifty and sixty applications of this instrument sec ured his presence in the room where we had the corpse. But not even the fear of the whip would induce him to touch it. Rabindranath Tagore is the biggest bluff ever put over the unsuspecting American public. His mysticism makes even Maeterlinck's wishy - w ashy twaddle seem virile. I have never read such slop. The illustrations match it. The whole production of Young India is babu in the Anglo - Indian sense of the word. The spirit of India is utterly absent. Drawings and writing alike resemble the sensel ess flourishes of some callow student. And all this while the babu, while accepting what he imagines to be honours, such as knighthood, from England, is plotting sneakishly in the Bengali manner against her. I would to God that the British would withdraw from India for six months, so that the men of India might exterminate these fatherless fish - eaters, this spawn of female dogs that, without caste even in its own slime of bastardy, asserts itelf in America as a ‘young nation.’ KWAW LI YA.

Consider the first child, Narada, who is a bastard. Was the father the ‘worm’ after all? We have nothing for it but the unsupported sta tement of its mother, the ‘worm’s’ second wife. This may be doubted. Even the colour tells us nothing, for there were plenty of pigmented people in London at the date of the story. When the ‘worm’s’ first wife has divorced him, and he is married to t he second wife, one might imagine that complications would be less. Not at all. The first time he leaves her alone, he sets up a harem in India, while she, travelling thither to join him under the charge of his best friend, Dr. Paira Mull, immediately be gins an intrigue with this fascinating Panjabi . The ‘ worm ’ seems rather to have welcomed this domestic tangle, as Paira Mull is very well off. The second child, Rohini, is the offspring of this liaison. About this time, the 'worm' is getting out a boo k of Indian folk songs, and he actually tries to include a number of translations made by his wife's lover as his own. However, he is forced by her (after a stormy scene) to make a very inadequate acknowledgment, and we are given to understand that he only does this because the show can be so easily given away, the ‘worm’ not knowing ten words of the language from which he is supposed to be translating. Isn’t this complex enough for anybody? Ah, no! Dr. Coomaraswamy is merely flapping his wings icily. H e can stage much stronger dramas. So you see the ‘worm’ and his wife in New York — of all places! The first thing that strikes him is the High Cost Of Living, and he hastens to offer his wife to the first comer. A friendly agreement is reached in conferen ce by which a divorce shall be obtained, and a new marriage contracted with Alice's new lover. I forget the disposition of the children, whether it was odd man out, or the first Jack, who had to look after the business. But, three months later, the tr agedy begins. The 'worm' is struck by the appalling thought that perhaps Alice's new lover may not fall in so simply with the scheme. He manifests reluctance to pay the expenses of the divorce, arguing with some show of good sense that he does not see why he should pay for relieving another man of his rubbish. The situation is complicated by the fact that Alice has again become pregnant. The ‘worm’ resolves upon a remarkably ingenious solution of his troubles. Past experience has shown him that his wif e, when in a ‘delicate condition of health,’ cannot stand a sea voyage. Previous to the birth of the second child, she had nearly miscarried and nearly died. “How then,” thinks he to himself, “can I clear myself once and for all? I will make up to my wi fe. I will pull out the pathetic stop. I will make mischief between her and her lover. I will forge telegrams, and do anything else that may be necessary. But I will get her to go over to England. That will put an end to the child, and very likely to her too, and then perhaps Paira Mull will take at least one of the children — his own — off my hands. Narada, too, is not legally my child at all. He is just a nameless bastard.” So thinks the ‘worm,’ and so he does.

The man whose property they are will not be likely to hear of it, as the inexplicable conduct of Alic e has more or less broken his heart, and he has become a sort of hermit. But the wife turns up again like a bad penny. The ‘worm’ has by this time got rather tired of the German girl, and he goes off to Chicago after another woman, leaving his wife an d his mistress to share a room at the McAlpin. Instead of quarreling, they made Friends, and the wholly icily murderous plot is laid bare. Alice now makes strenuous efforts to get back her lover, but he is one of those people who learn by experience. He merely exposes the ‘worm’s’ attempt to pirate his property. It seems to us that Dr. Coomaraswamy leaves the story at what might have been its most interesting complication. It stops right there.

A MOURNER CLAD IN GREEN. FOUR DIMENSIONAL VISTAS. By CLAUDE BRAGDON. Alfred A. Knopf, 1916. IT is a great ple asure to read this book, for although in some points we may find ourselves obliged to disagree with the author, the general effect is that a perusal leaves one with the feeling of having been at home; that is to say, on the planes of pure and exalted thoug ht. We cannot say that Mr. Bragdon is in any sense an original thinker, as Hinton was, but he has done something to extend and popularize Hinton's ideas. Some of the analogies in this book are very illuminating. Unfortunately, as it appears to us, Mr. B ragdon is tied up with theosophical dogmas. He talks about the ‘new freedom,’ and bases his whole argument on the idea that the material world is a shadow show. Yet he seems to think that the real (that is, the ideal) world is more easy of apprehension, i f we bind ourselves hand and foot by the senseless and cruel taboos of the most primitive tribes. He also errs, as it seems to us, in placing the yogi whose attainment is wholly selfish above the man of genius. Blavatsky made no such error. She placed th e poet above the adept. In spite of his prave ’orts, Mr. Bragdon is not a clear thinker like Hinton. He is just a little bourgeois who has put on Hinton's hat, and it comes down very far indeed over his eyes. He cannot see that the interpretation of phenomena as spiritual does not destroy their reality and the truth of their mutual relation, but"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"REVIEWS 295 rather confirms it. Shallow thinkers always seem to be obsessed by the stupidity that if anything is a shadow, dream, illusion, it ceases to exist. The rule s of dreams are just as rigid as the rules of mathematics.

OGILVIE 'S ASTROLOGICAL BIRTHDAY BOOK. By LEO BERNART. J. S. Ogilvie Publishing Co. IN the preface Mr. Bernart correctly states that the exact date and hour of birth are necessary to delineate a horoscope. Yet he publishes a book which attempts such a delineat ion on the birthday alone. Now, the birthday tells the astrologer nothing but the position of the sun in the zodiac at the time of birth, and this position varies to a small but sufficient extent in different years. This is indeed divining Hercules not mer ely from his foot, but from a big toe which may not be his at all. The error is often amusingly illustrated in the book itself. For example, Wm. T. Stead and Admiral Farragut were both born on July 5th. On July 11th, John Quincy Adams and Wanamaker. Th is happy combination is told, \"You are a good mimic and have a Singing voice. You are not as fond of literary and Scientific pursuits as you should be. You prefer the lighter side of life, which is all very well in its way, but the serious Side must have i ts innings also.\" On July 23rd, Mr. Bernart tells Cardinal Gibbons that he is religious but not orthodox. It is also new to me that the Cardinal `likes candy to an unusual degree.' A great many of these delineations are evidently taken straight from th e people who are mentioned as being born. For example, October 22nd, “You are emotional and dramatic and would make a success upon the stage in all probability,” which is Sarah Bernhardt. And on Nansen's birthday, “You have romantic ideas in youth which pr obably express themselves in seeking for lost or buried treasures or in exploring underground passages or little known caves.” On Edward VII.’s, “You have a brilliant career before you.” “You are fond of the world.” “You have a great deal of tact and di plomacy.” “You are fond of the good things of this life.” “You are fleeting in your affections, and will have a good many love affairs in your life.” However, “you are eminently domesticated.” Sometimes it is rather funny. Literary ability on Conan Doyle’s and Marie Corelli’s birthdays. Poetic talent on that of Ella Wheeler Wilcox!!!

She had taken compassion on him, because he told her that he wrote poetry — an excusable fal sehood. Perhaps he even believed it . She asked me if I would help him by publishing poems of his, and I wrote to him. He replied by complaining that the young lady aforesaid had tried to seduce him. This appeared an uncomplimentary reference to Augustu s John, Walter Duranty, myself, and several others. I wrote to Mr. Lewis, and told him that he was a stupid cad, and that I would kick him if I saw him. Stupid cad about fills the bill. It is perfectly easy to create a sensation by going into a church a nd shouting, “To Hell with Jesus” at the elevation of the Host. And that is Mr. Lewis' artistic method. Whether he is decorating a room in a bad imitation of Klimmt, or attempting some insincere cubism, or futurism, or vorticism, it is always the same st upid cad, brawling in church. “Blast” was a quite senseless vulgarity, and deceived nobody. “Tarr” is an attempt to repeat the trick. He dots his pages with French words and phrases when there is no need, and he prints words like bloody, petards, bitch, simply to shock the middle classes. It reveals the character of a stupid cad.

They are m essy, and rather conventional. But I like some of the parables very much indeed. It is not very sensible to compare Mr. Gibran with Blake, because Blake was a genius whose every act was wrought from the white heat of passion. This is a smaller fish swimmin g in shallower and calmer waters. The spirit is more French than Irish. However, he is short enough to speak for himself. Here is one of his parables THE SCARECROW Once I said to a scarecrow, “You must be tired of standing in this lonely field.” And he sai d, “The joy of scaring is a deep and lasting one, and I never tire of it.” Said I, after a minute of thought, “It is true; for I too have known that joy.” Said he, “Only those who are stuffed with straw can know it.” Then I left him, not knowing whether he had complimented or belittled it.

Alfred A. Knopf. MR. ARCHER has been through India, I should judge for as much as six weeks, with a typewriter and a provincial third - rate mind. Edmund Burke said “This multitude of men does not consist of an abject and barbaro us population. . . . (They are) a people for ages civilized and cultivated; cultivated by all the arts of polished life while we were yet in the woods.” This obvious fact is not obvious to Mr. Archer. Like the clever journalist he is, he has documented himself with so many facts that he does not tell us that Indians are negroes, who throw their children to crocodiles, but on every page one can feel that he cherishes this view in his pate. His method of investigating India is the method of Count Smorltor k; but Count Smorltork was a gentleman. His point of view is so ignorant and so bourgeois, that I am forced to quote passages, lest it should not be believed that any biped could print such rottenness. “This senseless reduplication to infinity of one m incing, prancing figure produces an indescribably nightmare - like effect; and what can be said for it, from the point of view either of art or of religion, I, for my part, cannot conceive. Who the figures represent I am not sure; . . .” “Yes, the horror — tha t is the only word for it. I do not mean that nowadays any particular horrors are perpetrated in the grim recesses of these giant fanes. I do not know that at any time they were the scenes of great cruelty or other abominations, though certainly they pre sent the completest mise - en - scene for such excesses. What I do know is that, from the corner - stone to the coping of the highest gopura , they are the product of gloomy, perverted, morbidly overwrought imaginations, revelling in the most extravagant feature s of the most monstrous of all mythologies.” This is all that Mr. Archer gets from the greatest temple, both from an artistic and religious standpoint, that is alive to - day. And in order that he may write himself down an ass for all to see, he is stup id enough to publish photographs of temples, whose beauty would, one thinks, be evident even to the bovine readers to whom he doubtless appeals."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 298 Mr. Archer's arrogance is equal to his ignorance. “And on every hand, in its swarming courts and alcoves, you s ee the lowest fetichism intent in its grovelling rites.” How does this animal know what the people were doing? He could not speak a word of their language. He was seeing them for the first time, and his criticisms are just as valuable as would be those of a savage who dropped in on a telephone exchange. The wretched creature keeps on, page after page. “Barbarian, barbarism, barbarous — I am sorry to harp so much on these words. But they express the essence of the situation.” “There never was a `great civiliz ation' in India . . .” With the monuments of Indian civilization actually intact, yet the oldest of them in ruins a thousand years, two thousand years, three thousand years, who knows, before the savages of England wore clothes, it is only natural that thi s poor blind, globe - trotting hag should fail to understand Caste. He utterly ignores the fact that it is the caste system which has preserved Indian civilization. Constantly conquered, India absorbs her conquerors. When the fool gets on to the spiritualit y, he is funnier than ever. On page 59, he gives a curiously imperfect account of the names of Hindu sacred writings, and apologizes for himself in the following note: “I trust there is no gross error in this paragraph; but very confusing explanations are given of the nomenclature of this literature.” He then proceeds to criticise the contents of those books! It is incredible that any one can be such an ass as to write the stuff that one finds in this book. Page after page of misstatement and misunderstan ding. He is even unable to see a thing like the good manners of the natives. In all the time I was in India I do not recall a single instance of bad manners, except on the part of Babus who had learned them from low - class Europeans, like William Archer. When he comes to talk of art and culture, it gets worse, if anything. “Remember — it is certainly not irrelevant - that India is the most tropical country that ever possessed any art of importance.” This person has never heard of Cambodia, Yucatan, Peru, Egypt , West Africa, Java. His art criticism is beneath the depth of Upper Tooting. “Can any unprejudiced observer deny that even these exceptionally favourable specimens of Indian workmanship are marred by the gravest effects of conventionality in form, of over crowding in composition, of excess in ornament? In a few seated female figures, viewed from behind, there is a certain natural grace, but most of the women who swarm all over the reliefs are the product of a morbid convention which gives them enormous bre asts, wasp waists, and atrophied legs, and places them in attitudes suggestive of a violent dislocation of the hipjoint. Whether such figures were actually cultivated at the period, I do not know; but even if this could be proved, the sculptures could only be regarded as conventional exaggerations of an unhealthy fashion.”"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"REVIEWS 299 “Finally, and coming back to the Buddha - figures in particular, what are we to say of the marvellous spirituality of expression often attributed to them? It is to me, I own, far from appa rent. The drooped eyelids, and the immobile pose do, indeed, express the idea of contemplation; but I am at a loss to find anything spiritual in the smooth, insipid faces.” Pig - mindedness can hardly go further. And yet: “In the Indian epics, the poets are always trying to outdo themselves and each other in their search for the marvellous, whether in virtue, prowess, gorgeousness, wickedness, demoniacal fury, or mere numerical extravagance. They are constantly creating records in exaggeration, which are as constantly broken. What wonder that a people habituated from childhood to these orgies of unbridled fancy should suffer from a certain slackening of imaginative fibre, an insensitiveness to normal and wholesome stimulation? It is that insensitiveness whi ch seems to me to account for all that is worst in Indian art. It is that insensitiveness which will have to be corrected before India can hope to make the best of her intellectual gifts in a world in which, though all may be illusory, the God - made illusio n of Nature must in the end prevail over the man - made illusions of mythology and metaphysics.” I am perfectly in accord with the political conclusion of this book. He was doubtless paid to write it in this interest. However, I had no idea that Mr. Wi lliam Archer was such an unpleasant thing. The publisher says that he was born at Perth, Scotland. Perhaps, he was one of the famous “twin brothers of Perth, who were — ready to exhibit a positive Wassermann — to the eyes from their birth.

I HAVE so deep a debt of gratitude in my personal ledger to Mrs. Emily Grant Hutchings, that I can but be prejudiced most favorably with regard to anything with which she may be connected. I consequently take es pecial pains to discount the obligation, and I may be relied upon to say the worst of Patience Worth. It is, I think, beyond all question the most interesting of the records purporting to be the utterance of the stiff. There is an unquestionable personal ity in Patience Worth with perhaps no one beyond the scope of “subliminal Mrs. Curran” and the hypothesis is reasonable since Mrs. Curran is always at the board when Patience manifests. To me it seems a much simpler hypothesis to suppose that Patience is Mrs. Curran’s sub - conscious memory of an Elizabethan incarnation than that Patience is wandering, unchanged for several centuries, about the astral plane, where things are so easily broken up. It is also quite feasible to imagine Patience as an elemental spirit. But undoubtedly her utterance is remarkably distinctive and coherent. It is almost entirely free from the worst of the disfigurements to which psychical researchers have acclimatized us, confound them. The mention of psychical researchers has ruined my temper again. I am going to be nasty even to my dear Mrs. Hutchings. It is very easy to spoil a case by claiming too much. Jesus preferred would stand higher in the market to - day if some would - be clever press agent had not added ridiculous Pa gan stories of the Virgin Birth, and so on, to the earlier and more plausible legend. And the most serious criticism of Patience Worth is the existence of that ridiculous novel by “Mark Twain.” Patience Worth is not impossible, or even improbable. She m akes mistakes.

I do not think that there is any question of fraud, but I do see all kinds of openings for delusion, especially in the case of people who are hardly aware that there is such a thing as magical protection.

By HEREWARD CARRINGTON. Dodd, Mead & Co., Inc. THIS book is an extremely interesting and valuable contribution to the science o f the future. The first part of it, which relates to normal psychology, is extremely well compiled, and offers a capital picture of the peculiar phenomena which accompany combat under modern conditions. It is a serious study of actuality, entirely free fro m the pathological point of view of people like Barbusse on one hand, or the average newspaper correspondent on the other. The second and larger part of the book deals with various supernormal events connected with war. I suppose Mr. Carrington’s trou ble is the paucity of his material. He feels that he has to fill his book, and he certainly uses a great deal of appalling rubbish. He even reaches lice of the slime like Harold Begbie. It is very unfortunate that Mr. Carrington with his fine critical a bility, his great experience in distinguishing between false and true, should have laid aside his weapons in his old age. It is to such persons as he is that we look for discrimination, yet in this book the most excellently authenticated narratives are ch eek by jowl with ‘thinking horses’, and the humbug of sweet Phyllis Campbell.

There is no space for detailed exposition of these points, but those familiar with the theory will find no difficulty at all in applying it to any particular case. This book is decidedly superior to True Ghost Stories ; it is intended for read ers of a somewhat higher type of intelligence. But Mr. Carrington's way is not the way of those who become great.

J. C. A CHASTE MAN. By LOUIS UMFRAVILLE WILKINSON. Alfred A. Knopf. IT has often been disputed as to how far a novelist is right in showing us the seamy side of life. But the answer admits of no dispute. Truth is the most precious jewel of all. The atmosphere of Mr. Wilkinson's new book, des pite the brightness and insouciance of the manner and the lightness of the incident, is one of the most tragic gloom. The scene opens upon the hero reminding somebody that this is the third application, etc., and unless, etc., yours faithfully, and the nov el ends with his reminding somebody, probably the same person, of the same thing. Such an appalling realization of the horror of life makes one shudder and sicken. Between the two applications comes an adventure. The hero, who is a married man, meets a charming girl of sixteen, falls in love with her — and she with him. Every conceivable circumstance conspires to bring about immoral relations, so - called, between them. The girl’s father himself urges it. But the hero remains chaste. The tragedy thus brou ght about is absolutely nauseating. It is hard for the reviewer to think of the grim and grisly abomination which follows. The hero has to go away to Switzerland, for a month or two; and during his absence the girl marries a Canadian and goes to Canada w ith him. The gloom is not even lightened by any hint that she may have had some adventure previous to the marriage. No hope is held out that she may have any adventure after that. The Abomination of Desolation is set up in the holy place. But there i s reserved for us a yet more terrible contemplation. If one had said, “The girl escapes from the intrigue with her married lover, and is"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"REVIEWS 303 honorably married to a Canadian,” every one would say, “What a wholesome story!” The poison of puritanism has rotted through the whole of human thought. Conventional morality is the syphilis of the soul, and it is for the God Mercury, no one less, to oppose its action. Our trouble is rendered a thousand times more grievous because most of us do not recognize how foul is our disease. The words ‘marriage with a Canadian’ should be expunged from human language. People should be prosecuted for printing so foul and obscene a phrase. Yet these things happen every day. The sun turns sick in heaven to behold them. Yet we d o not see his anguish. Life which involves such possibilities of infamy and horror as ‘marriage with a Canadian’ must surely be some atrocious species of damnation; the reward of infinite iniquity. But humanity has become so callous, so anaesthetic to any proper feeling, that many people may even fail to see the high seriousness and noble purpose of such statements as the above. The degradation of humanity has gone so far that marriage with a Canadian seems almost normal and natural. There is no mistaki ng the great advance made by Mr. Wilkinson upon his previous novel, The Buffoon. In that work, there was, indeed, power and wit. But it was on the whole a pleasant book. There was plenty of comic relief - e.g., Powys' duodenum. In A Chaste Man the author mov es stately and terrible from peak to peak of tragedy. The book reminds us a little of James Thomson, The City of Dreadful Night, in this respect. With infinite art the climax is set off by an adventure of the hero's sister with a man dying of consumption a t St. Moritz, and this single glimpse of Paradise makes the surrounding gloom more visible and shameful. It is unfortunately the case that stories of this kind are only too true to life. Few of us, indeed, but have some experience of the classes in whi ch such abominations are not only possible but actual. It is true that the war has done a great deal to destroy the morality of the middle classes. From all hands comes the wail of the Puritan as he is forced into a recognition that life is a savage and be autiful thing, and that his attempt to make every one behave with the decorum of a putrefying corpse is bound in the long run to fail. We find, for example, the Bishop of Worcester offering a tasteless substitute for Worcester Sauce. He complains pitifully of how he saw three women in the street trying to seduce a soldier. Apparently in consequence of the appearance of the Bishop, the soldier \"saw his chance and ran away,\" but from what we know of Bishops it seems probable that he was trying to escape from the Episcopal rather than the feminine menace. We hope that in Mr. Wilkinson's next novel he will try to give us the brighter side of the picture. The eternal death which the bourgeoisie calls life is not the only feature of experience.

JOHN. ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE UNSEEN. An Ex amination of the Phenomena of Spiritualism and of the Evidence for Survival after Death. By SIR WILLIAM F. BARRETT. E. P. Dutton & Co. SIR WILLIAM BARRETT's book is decidedly well worth reading by those who imagine that there is nothing in spiritualism and kindred subjects. Sir William Barrett has marshalled his facts and fictions in a very creditable manner. It is quite surprising how much he knows, and how clever he is, considering the limitations imposed on him by the fact that, like most psychical r esearchers, he has no sort of initiation, and has therefore no organized but only haphazard material at his disposal. He exhibits quite remarkable intelligence in dealing with the problems which he discusses. It is a very marked advance upon the absolutely blithering balderdash which characterizes most writing on spiritualism, `new thought,' and the like. Sir William Barrett is critical, without being skeptical in the bad sense of the word, and his judgment is excellent for an amateur. Of course, all ps ychical research without initiation reminds one of art criticism by a blind man or an art critic. Apart from this, however, Sir William Barrett has written a very clever book, and I hope that these few well chosen words of approval may encourage him to fur ther efforts, perhaps not so much in this line as in one for which he might have more original talent. A. C. FROM THE WATCH TOWER. By SIDNEY T. KLEIN. E. P. Dutton & Co. WHEN I had the pleasure of reviewing Mr. Sidney T. Klein's Science and the Infinit e in Number IX. of the First Volume of THE EQUINOX, I remember asking him for a second part to his book dealing with the means of attainment. Mr. Klein has not exactly done this in his new volume, but he has gone a long way on the road. He is still somewha t handicapped by infelicity of expression, but a more serious drawback still is the confusion of thought caused by his early training. He is a sublime initiate, but he is trying to put his quart of Champagne into the pint pot of the language of Christian M ysticism. He has not seen the necessity of discarding this deuce and trey. He stands pat on his three aces instead of trying to catch the fourth or maybe a pair of kings in the draw. The language of Christianity, particularly Pauline Christianity, is hopel essly mired in the slough of the idea of original sin."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"REVIEWS 305 Mr. Klein disavows this idea with noble boldness as freely as we ourselves of the A ∴ A ∴ would do. He has accepted the Law of Thelema. He understands that there is no law beyond “Do what thou wilt.” He states it almost in so many words. And yet his congenital fetter seems to gall. He has not quite got the idea that every man and every woman is a star, and that every one's will is the will of God; at least, he does not seem settled about it. In som e parts of his book he makes statements which certainly imply that this is so, but in others he appears too conscious of dividuality. He does not always make it perfectly clear that evil so - called is part of the game, which he describes as the ‘thought of God.’ We have no doubt that as he progresses, he will attain this clearer conception of the magical doctrine. He has already gone very far. His interpretation, for example, of the statement “God is Love” can hardly be distinguished from our own “Love i s the law.” Yet even here there is some taint of a lingering Manichaeanism. He seems to imagine “the All - Loving” as always trying to bring us to a conception of sonship. Yet this ‘All - Loving’ is a metaphysical entity, omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent , and so on. The result is that now and again Mr. Klein's expression slips back into the language of dualism. However, it is a shame to carp Mr. Klein's philosophical and scientific knowledge is profound. It is unified. Better still, it is dynamic and exulting. It is impossible to read a page of his book without feeling the contagion of the joy of his attainment. Too many philosophers in the past have drooled on about the Absolute with such piety of dullness, that one has wished the Absolute at th e devil. There is nothing of this in this book. We feel that Mr. Klein is enjoying the Light, Life, Love and Liberty which come from the acceptance of the Law of Thelema. But I must still ask him for another volume. The greater part of his difficult y in explanation seems to arise from the fact that he has no conception of a technique of attainment. He says quite rightly that it is all a matter of thinking right instead of wrong, and certainly a study of his pages should do a great deal to clear up i ntellectual difficulties. But this is only a very small part of the Path. It is all very well to say that reason is full of falsity, and Mr. Klein demonstrates it very much as I have myself done in many places. But how are people to use the eyes of the spirit, unless they are taught? The A ∴ A ∴ offers a technique of attainment infinitely subtle and varied, so that the need of every man is met by processes of actual practice, scientifically tested and confirmed. It is not enough merely to accept Mr. Klein's explanation of the universe. That is the Giant's Robe. You must get your own clothes made to fit you. You cannot persuade yourself to think in any way contrary to your experience. Thought must be the expression of experience.

Mr. Mencken narrowly escapes the cleverness which is the Hall - mark of the silver mind, but he does escape it. For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people: he wil l beautify the meek with salvation. Mr. Mencken’s perception may be gauged by just one piece of navigation, the Straits of Ibsen. In 1901 I said of Ibsen, “he is the Sophocles of manners.” And elsewhere spoke of him as “a purely Greek dramatist.” Mr. Mencken says, “the fabulous Ibsen of the symbols (no more the real Ibsen than Christ was a prohibitionist).” “His shining skill as a dramatic craftsman his one authentic claim upon fame.” Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds. His robust joy of castigating curs with his contempt swells a paean in my heart. “Consider one fact: the civilization that kissed Maeterlinck on both cheeks and Tagore perhaps even more intimately. . . .” Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two - edged sword in their hand; To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people; To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; To execute upon them the judgment written: thi s honour have all his saints.

SANINE is not a supreme novel in the full flower of a period, like La Cousine Bette. It is too lyric. It is like the timid song of a young thru sh in the morning of life. For this novel is much more than a great novel. It is the first novel of an epoch. It is the first attempt to depict a man who is living by the Law of Thelema, whose outlook on the world is based upon the magical formulae of t he Æon of Horus: “Every man and every woman is a star”; “There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.” Sanine absolutely refuses to be obfuscated by the fog of false morality. He judges actions by their real, not by their imaginary consequences. Bernard Shaw attempted this very feebly in his portrait of John Tanner; but Tanner, like Shaw himself, is a blustering and wordy weakling, who is entirely the slave of the morality which he condemns. Sanine actually lives up to the truth which he sees, and it makes him free, and it makes free those who follow him. This is a great book to shed light upon the greybeard slobbering of Shaw. Violet’s baby is only tolerable because Violet is Mrs. Malone. Shaw has not the strength of character to avow (even in a f ictitious work) that a woman can assert what is evidently her first right without undergoing phantastic penalties, although there are to - day thousands of women in every country who have told morality to go to its father, the devil, as Shaw so bombastically tells it to do. The phantoms which confront the free man are really just hollow turnips in churchyards. Take poor Ambrose, for example. He occupies one of the most important positions in New York City. He lives his own life for 15 years or so. Nobody is offended. Nobody is injured. Nothing whatever happens. A pleasant time is had by all. Then, suddenly some one discovers this appalling state of circumstances, and there is Ambrose in peril of Sing - Sing and Matteawan, and all those pretty places on t he Hudson. He loses his job. He is an outcast from society. He vanishes like morning mist. And there is not a single shadow of reason for all this, except an ecclesiastical nefas, based principally upon a comic Turkish superstition. The stupidity of governments is unthinkable. People reclaim a little obvious freedom, and the authorities will not let them have it without all this cutting of throats, and robbing of churches! The Gods seem to send imbeciles like Louis XVI. and Nicholas Romanoff, and c ertain other persons whom I will not mention, at the moment when free men decide that it is time to strike for freedom. Hear the word of the Lord: In the next few years Sanine and his like are going to hang a lot of people to a lot of lamp - posts. 666."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"  SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT THE VOICE OF THE SILENCE THE TWO PATHS THE SEVEN PORTALS "},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":" : LIBER LXXI THE VOICE OF THE SILENCE BY HELENA PETROVNA BLAVATSKY 8°=3 8 WITH A COMMENTARY BY FRATER O.M. 7°=4 8 "},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"  V A ∴ A ∴ Publication in Class B 93 10 °= 1 8 666 9 °= 2 8 Pro Coll.

I T IS NOT VERY DIFFIC ULT to write a book, if one chance to possess the necessary degree of Initiation, and the power of expression. It is infernally difficult to comment on such a Book. The principal reason for this is that every statement is true and untrue, alternately, as one advances upon the Path of the Wise. The q uestion always arises: For what grade is this Book meant? To give one simple concrete example, it is stated in the third part of this treatise that Change is the great enemy. This is all very well as meaning that one ought to stick to one’s job. But in a nother sense Change is the Great Friend. As it is marvelous well shewed forth by The Beast Himself in Liber Aleph, Love is the law, and Love is Change, by definition. Short of writing a separate interpretation suited for every grade, therefore, the commen tator is in a bog of quandary which makes Flanders Mud seem like polished granite. He can only do his poor best, leaving it very much to the intelligence of each reader to get just what he needs. These remarks are peculiarly applicable to the present treat ise; for the issues are presented in so confused a manner that one almost wonders whether Madame Blavatsky was not a reincarnation of the Woman with the Issue of Blood familiar to readers of the Gospels. It is astonishing and distressing to notice how the Lanoo, no"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 4 matter what happens to him, soaring aloft like the phang, and sailing gloriously through innumerable Gates of High Initiation, nevertheless keeps his original Point of View, like a Bourbon. He is always getting rid of Illusions, but, like the en tourage of the Cardinal Lord Arch bishop of Rheims after he cursed the thief, nobody seems one penny the worse — or the better. Probably the best way to take the whole treatise is to assume that it is written for the absolute tyro, with a good deal between t he lines for the more advanced mystic. This will excuse, to the mahatma - snob , a good deal of apparent triviality and crudity of standpoint. It is of course necessary for the commentator to point out just those things which the novice is not expected to se e. He will have to shew mysteries in many grades, and each reader must glean his own wheat. At the same time, the commentator has done a good deal to uproot some of the tares in the mind of the tyro aforesaid, which Madame Blavatsky was apparently content to let grow until the day of judgment. But that day is come since she wrote this Book; the New Æon is here, and its Word is Do what thou wilt. It is certainly time to give the order: “ Chautauqua est delenda.” Love is the law, love under will.

These instructions are for t hose ignorant of the dangers of the lower Iddhi (magical powers). Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Nothing less can satisfy than this Motion in your orbit. It is important to reject any iddhi of which you may become possessed. Firstly, be cause of the wasting of energy, which should rather be concentrated on further advance; and secondly, because iddhi are in many cases so seductive that they lead the unwary to forget altogether the real purpose of their endeavours. The Student must be prep ared for temptations of the most extraordinary subtlety; as the Scriptures of the Christians mysti cally put it, in their queer but often illuminating jargon, the Devil can disguise himself as an Angel of Light. A species of parenthesis is necessary thus e arly in this Comment. One must warn the reader that he is going to swim in very deep waters. To begin with, it is assumed throughout that the student is already familiar with at least the elements of Mysticism. True, you are supposed to be ignorant of t he dangers of the lower Iddhi; but there are really quite a lot of people, even in Boston, who do not know that there are any Iddhi at all, low or high. However, one who has been assiduous with Book 4 , by Frater Perdurabo, should have no difficulty so far as a general comprehension"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 6 of the subject - matter of the Book is concerned. Too ruddy a cheerfulness on the part of the assiduous one will however be premature, to say the least. For the fact is that this treatise does not contain an intelligible and coh erent cosmogony. The unfortunate Lanoo is in the position of a sea - captain who is furnished with the most elaborate and detailed sailing - instruc tions, but is not allowed to have the slightest idea of what port he is to make, still less given a chart of t he Ocean. One finds oneself accordingly in a sort of “Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came” atmosphere. That poem of Browning owes much of its haunting charm to this very circumstance, that the reader is never told who Childe Roland is, or why he wants t o get to the Dark Tower, or what he expects to find when he does get there. There is a skilfully constructed atmosphere of Giants, and Ogres, and Hunchbacks, and the rest of the apparatus of fairy - tales; but there is no trace of the influence of Bædeker i n the style. Now this is really very irritating to anybody who happens to be seriously concerned to get to that tower. I remember, as a boy, what misery I suffered over this poem. Had Browning been alive, I think I would have sought him out, so seriousl y did I take the Quest. The student of Blavatsky is equally handicapped. Fortu nately, Book 4 , Part III, comes to the rescue once more with a rough sketch of the Universe as it is conceived by Those who know it; and a regular investigation of that book, and the companion volumes ordered in “The Curriculum of the A ∴ A ∴ ,” fortified by steady persistence in practical personal exploration, will enable this Voice of the Silence to become a serious guide in some of the subtler obscurities which weigh upon the Eyelids of the Seeker."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"THE VOICE OF THE SILENCE 7 2 . He who would hear the voice of N a da , the “Soundless Sound,” and comprehend it, he has to learn the nature of Dh a ran a (concentrated thought) . The voice of Nada is very soon heard by the beginner, especially during the practice of Pranayama (control of breath - force). At first it resembles di stant surf, though in the adept it is more like the twittering of innumerable night - ingales; but this sound is premonitory, as it were, the veil of more distinct and articulate sounds which come later. It corresponds in hearing to that dark veil which is seen when the eyes are closed, although in this case a certain degree of progress is necessary before anything at all is heard. 3 . Having become indifferent to objects of perception, the pupil must seek out the R a ja (King) of the senses, the Thought - Prod ucer, he who awakes illusion. The word “indifferent” here implies “able to shut out.” The Rajah referred to is in that spot whence thoughts spring. He turns out ultimately to be Mayan, the great Magician described in the 3 rd Æthyr (See The Equinox , vol I, no. 5 , Special Supplement). Let the Student notice that in his early medi tations, all his thoughts will be under the Tamo - Guna , the prin ciple of Inertia and Darkness. When he has destroyed all those, he will be under the dominion of an entirely new set of the type of Rajo - Guna , the principle of Activity, and so on. To the advanced Student a simple ordinary thought, which seems little or nothing to the beginner, becomes a great and terrible fountain of iniquity, and the higher he goes, up to a certain p oint, the point of definitive victory, the more that is the case. The beginner can think, “it is ten o’clock,” and dismiss the thought.

He will get Samadhi upon that original thought, and this will be a terrible enemy to his progress. 4 . The Mind is the great Slayer of the Real. In the word “Mind” we should include all phenomena of Mind, including Samadhi itself. Any phenomenon has causes and produces results, and all these things are below the “REAL.” By the REAL is here meant the NIBBANA - DHATU . 5 . Let the Disciple slay the Slayer. For — This is a corollary of Verse 4 . These texts may be interpreted in a quite elementary sens e. It is of course the object of even the beginner to suppress mind and a!l its manifestations, but only as he advances will he discover what Mind means. 6 . When to himself his form appears unreal, as do on waking all the forms he sees in dreams; This i s a somewhat elementary result. Concentration on any subject leads soon enough to a sudden and overwhelming convic tion that the object is unreal. The reason of this may perhaps be — speaking philosophically — that the object, whatever it is, has only a relati ve existence. (See The Equinox , vol. I, no. 4 , p. 159 ). 7 . When he has ceased to hear the many, he may discern the ONE — the inner sound which kills the outer. By the “many” are meant primarily noises which take place outside the Student, and secondly, th ose which take place inside him. For example, the pulsation of the blood in"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"THE VOICE OF THE SILENCE 9 the ears, and later the mystic sounds which are described in Verse 40 . 8 . Then only, not till then, shall he forsake the region of ASAT, the false, to come unto the realm of SAT , the true. By “SAT , the true,” is meant a thing previous to the “REAL” referred to above. SAT itself is an illusion. Some schools of philos ophy have a higher ASAT , Not - Being, which is beyond SAT , and consequently is to Shivadarshana as SAT is to Atmadar shana . Nirvana is beyond both these. 9 . Before the soul can see, the Harmony within must be attained, and fleshly eyes be rendered blind to all illusion. By the “Harmony within” is meant that state in which neither objects of sense, nor physiological s ensations, nor emotions, can disturb the concentration of thought. 10 . Before the Soul can hear, the image (man) has to become as deaf to roarings as to whispers, to cries of bellowing elephants as to the silvery buzzing of the golden fire - fly . In the text the image is explained as “Man,” but it more prop erly refers to the consciousness of man, which consciousness is considered as being a reflection of the Non - Ego, or a creation of the Ego, according to the school of philosophy to which the Student may bel ong. 11 . Before the soul can comprehend and may remember, she must unto the Silent Speaker be united just as the form to which the clay is modeled, is first united with the potter’s mind. Any actual object of the senses is considered as a precipitation of an ideal. Just as no existing triangle is a pure triangle, since it must be either equilateral, isosceles, or scalene, so every object is a miscarriage of an ideal. In the"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 10 course of practice one concen trates upon a given thing, rejecting this outer app earance and arriving at that ideal, which of course will not in any way resemble any of the objects which are its incarnations. It is with this in view that the verse tells us that the Soul must be united to the Silent Speaker. The words “Silent Speaker” may be consid ered as a hieroglyph of the same character as Logos, ynda or the Ineffable Name. 12 . For then the soul will hear and will remember. The word “hear” alludes to the tradition that hearing is the organ of Spirit, just as seeing is that of Fire. The word “remember” might be explained as “will attain to memory.” Memory is the link between the atoms of consciousness, for each successive consciousness of Man is a single phenomenon, and has no connection with any other. A looking - glass knows nothi ng of the different people that look into it. It only reflects one at a time. The brain is however more like a sensitive plate, and memory is the faculty of bringing up into consciousness any picture required. As this occurs in the normal man with his o wn experiences, so it occurs in the Adept with all experiences. (This is one more reason for His identifying Himself with others.) 13 . And then to the inner ear will speak — THE VOICE OF THE SILENCE. And say: — What follows must be regarded as the device of the poet, for of course the “Voice of the Silence” cannot be interpreted in words. What follows is only its utterance in respect of the Path itself. 14 . If thy soul smiles while bathing in the Sunlight of thy Life; if thy soul sings within her chrysalis of flesh and matter; if thy soul weeps inside her castle of illusion; if thy"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"THE VOICE OF THE SILENCE 11 soul struggles to break the silver thread that binds her to the MASTER; know, O Disciple, thy Soul is of the earth. In this verse the Student is exhorted to indifference to every thing but his own progress. It does not mean the indifference of the Man to the things around him, as it has often been so unwor thily and wickedly interpreted. The indifference spoken of is a kind of inner indifference. Everything should be enjoyed to the full, but always with the reservation that the absence of the thing enjoyed shall not cause regret. This is too hard for the beginner, and in many cases it is necessary for him to abandon pleasures in order to prove to himself that he is indifferent t o them, and it may be occasionally advisable even for the Adept to do this now and again. Of course during periods of actual concentration there is no time whatever for anything but the work itself; but to make even the mildest asceticism a rule of life i s the gravest of errors, except perhaps that of regarding Asceticism as a virtue. This latter always leads to spiritual pride, and spiritual pride is the principal quality of the brother of the Left - hand Path. “Ascetic” comes from the Greek ' Askew “to wor k curiously, to adorn, to exercise, to train.” The Latin ars is derived from this same word. Artist, in its finest sense of creative craftsman, is therefore the best translation. The word has degenerated under Puritan foulness. 15 . When to the World’s turmoil thy budding soul lends ear; when to the roaring voice of the great illusion thy Soul responds; when frightened at the sight of the hot tears of pain, when deafened by the cries of distress, thy soul withdraws like the shy turtle within the carapace of SELFHOOD, learn, O Disciple, of her Silent “God,” thy Soul is an unworthy shrine."},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 12 This verse deals with an obstacle at a more advanced stage. It is again a warning not to shut one’s self up in one’s own universe. It is not by the exclusion of the Non - Ego that saintship is attained, but by its inclusion. Love is the law, love under will. 16 . When waxing stronger, thy Soul glides forth from her secure retreat; and breaking bose from the protecting shrine, extends her silver thread and rushes onward; wh en beholding her image on the waves of Space she whispers, “This is I,” — declare, O Disciple, that thy Soul is caught in the webs of delusion. An even more advanced instruction, but still connected with the question of the Ego and the non - Ego. The phenomen on described is perhaps Atmadarshana , which is still a delusion, in one sense still a delusion of personality; for although the Ego is destroyed in the Universe, and the Universe in it, there is a distinct though exceedingly subtle tendency to sum up its e xperi ence as Ego. These three verses might be interpreted also as quite elemen tary; v. 14 as blindness to the First Noble Truth “Everything is Sorrow”; v. 15 as the coward’s attempt to escape Sorrow by Retreat; and v. 16 as the acceptance of the Astral a s SAT. 17 . This Earth, Disciple, is the Hall of Sorrow, wherein are set along the Path of dire probations, traps to ensnare thy EGO by the delusion called “Great Heresy.” Develops still further these remarks. 18 .

The last phrase is borrowed from Eliph as Lévi, who was not (I believe) a Tibetan of antiquity. [Madame Blavatsky humorously pretended that this Book is an ancient Tibetan writing. — Ed.] 19 . Saith the Great Law: — ”In order to become the KNOWER of ALL - SELF, thou hast first of SELF to be the know er.” To reach the knowledge of that SELF, thou hast to give up Self to Non - Self, Being to Non - Being, and then thou canst repose between the wings of the GREAT BIRD. Aye, sweet is rest between the wings of that which is not born, nor dies, but is the AUM th roughout eternal ages. The words “give up” may be explained as “yield” in its subtler or quasi - masochistic erotic sense, but on a higher plane. In the following quotation from the “Great Law” it explains that the yielding is not the beginning but the end of the Path. Then let the End awake. Long hast thou slept, O great God Terminus! Long ages hast thou waited at the end of the city and the roads thereof. Awake Thou! wait no more! Nay, Lord! but I am come to Thee. It is I that wait at last. The prophet c ried against the mountain; come thou hither, that I may speak with thee! The mountain stirred not. Therefore went the prophet unto the mountain, and spake unto it. But the feet of the prophet were weary, and the mountain heard not his voice. But 1 have c alled unto Thee, and 1 have jour neyed unto Thee, and it availed me not.

This verse may be compared with similar statements in the Gospels, in The Vision and the Voice, and in the Books of It does not mean asceticism in the sense usually under - stood by the world. The 12 th Æthyr (see The Equinox , vol. I, no. 5 , Supplement) gives the clearest ex plana tion of this phrase. 22 . Three Halls, O weary pilgrim, lead to the end of toils. Three Halls, O conqueror of Mara, will bring thee through three states into the fourth and thence into the seven worlds, the worlds of Rest Eternal.

But as it is better than “genuine,” being, like The Chymical Marriage of Chr istian Rosencreutz , the forgery of a great adept, one cannot too confidently refer it thus. For the “Seven Worlds” are not Buddhism. 23 . If thou would’st learn their names, then hearken, and remember. The name of the first Hall is IGNORANCE — Avidyâ. It is the Hall in which thou saw’st the light, in which thou livest and shalt die. These three Halls correspond to the Gunas: Ignorance, Tamas; Learning, Rajas; Wisdom, Sattvas. Again, ignorance corresponds to Malkuth and Nephesch (the animal soul), Learning to Tiphareth and Ruach (the mind), and Wisdom to Binah and Neschamah (the aspiration or Divine Mind)."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 16 24 . The name of Hall the second is the Hall of LEARNING. in it thy Soul will find the blossoms of life, but under every flower a serpent coiled. This Hall is a very much larger region than that usually under stood by the Astral World. It would certainly include alI states up to Dhyana. T he Student will remember that his “rewards” immediately transmute themselves into temptations. 25 . The name of the third Hall is Wisdom, beyond which stretch the shoreless waters of AKSHARA, the indestructible Fount of Omniscience. Akshara is the same as the Great Sea of the Qabalah. The reader must consult The Equinox for a full study of this Great Sea. 26 . If thou would’s t cross the first Hall safely, let not thy mind mistake the fires of lust that burn therein for the Sunlight of life. The metaphor is now somewhat changed. The Hall of ignorance represents the physical life. Note carefully the phraseology, “let not thy mi nd mistake the fires of lust.” It is legitimate to warm yourself by those fires so long as they do not deceive you. 27 . If thou would’st cross the second safely, stop not the fragrance of its stupefying blossoms to inhale. if freed thou would’st be from t he Karmic chains, seek not for thy Guru in those M a y a vic regions.

They listen to them, but do not neces sarily attach importance to what they say. 30 . Seek for him who is to give thee birth, in the Hall of Wisdom, the Hall which lies beyond, wherein all shadows are unknown, and where the light of truth shines with unfading glory.

That which is uncreate abides in thee, Disciple, as it abides in that Ha ll. If thou would’st reach it and blend the two, thou must divest thyself of thy dark garments of illusion.

This Hall is dangerous in its perfidious beauty, is needed but for thy probation. Beware, Lanoo, lest dazzled by illusive radiance thy Soul should linger and be caught in its deceptive light. This is a résumé of the previous seven verses. It inculcates the necessity of unwavering aspiration, and in particular warns the advanced Student against accepting his rewards.

This light shines from the jewel of the Great Ensnarer, (M a ra). The sens es it bewitches, blinds the mind, and leaves the unwary an abandoned wreck. I am inclined to believe that most of Blavatsky’s notes are intended as blinds. “Light” such as is described has a technical meaning. It would be too petty to regard Mara as a Ch ristian would regard a man who offered him a cigarette. The supreme and blinding light of this jewel is the great vision of Light. It is the light which streams from the threshold of Nirvana , and M a ra is the “dweller on the threshold.” It is absurd to c all this light “evil” in any commonplace sense. It is the two - edged sword, flaming every way, that keeps the gate of the Tree of Life. And there is a further Arcanum connected with this which it would be improper here to divulge. 33 . The moth attracted to the dazzling flame of thy night - lamp is doomed to perish in the viscid oil.

This partly refers to certain Iddhi , concerning Under - standing of Devas (gods), etc.; here the word “wind” may be interpreted as “spirit.” It is comparatively easy to reach this state, and it has no great importance. The “walker of the sky” is much superior to the mere reader of the minds of ants. 39 . Before thou set’st thy foot upon the ladder’s upper rung, the ladder of the mystic sounds, thou hast to hear the voice of thy INNER God in seven manners. The word “seven” is here, as so frequently, rather poetic than mathematic; for the re are many more. The verse also reads as if it were necessary to hear all the seven, and this is not the case — some will get one and some another. Some students may even miss all of them. (This might happen as the result of his having conquered, and uproo ted them, and “fried their seeds” in a previous birth.) 40 . The first is like the nightingale’s sweet voice chanting a song of parting to its mate. The second comes as the sound of a silver cymbal of the Dhy a nis, awakening the twinkling stars. The next is as the plaint melodious of the ocean - sprite imprisoned in its shell. And this is followed by the chant of Vina (the Hindu lute).

They die, and then are heard no more. The first four are comparatively easy to obtain, and many people can hear them at will. The last three are much rarer, not neces sarily becaus e they are more difficult to get, and indicate greater advance, but because the protective envelope of the Adept is become so strong that they cannot pierce it. The last of the seven sometimes occurs, not as a sound, but as an earthquake, if the expressio n may be permitted. It is a mingling of terror and rapture impossible to describe, and as a general rule it completely discharges the energy of the Adept, leaving him weaker than an attack of Malaria would do; but if the practice has been right, this soon passes off, and the experience has this advantage, that one is far hess troubled with minor phenomena than before. It is just possible that this is referred to in the Apocalypse XVI, XVII, XVIII. 41 . When the six are slain and at the Master’s feet are lai d, then is the pupil merged into the ONE, becomes that One and lives therein. The note tells that this refers to the six principles, so that the subject is completely changed. By the slaying of the principles is meant the withdrawal of the consciousness f rom them, their rejection by the seeker of truth. Sabhapaty Swami has an excel lent method on these lines; it is given, in an improved form, in Liber HHH . (See The Equinox , vol. I, no. 5 , p. 5 ; also Book 4 , Part III, app. VII .) 42 .

Eternal life’s pure waters, clear and crystal, with the monsoon t empest’s muddy torrents cannot mingle. We are now again on the subject of suppressing thought.

Heaven’s dew - drop glittering in the morn’s first sun - beam within the bosom of t he lotus, when dropped on earth becomes a piece of clay; behold, the pearl is now a speck of mire. This is not a mere poetic image. This dew - drop in the lotus is connected with the mantra “Aum Mani Padme Hum,” and to what this verse really refers is known only to members of the ninth degree of O.T.O. 45 . Strive with thy thoughts unclean before they overpower thee. Use them as they will thee, for if thou sparest them and they take root and grow, know well, these thoughts will overpower and kill thee. Bewar e, Disciple, suffer not, e’en though it be their shadow, to approach. For it will grow, increase in size and power, and then this thing of darkness will absorb thy being before thou hast well realized the black four monster’s presence. The text returns to the question of suppressing thoughts. Verse 44 has been inserted where it is in the hope of deluding the reader into the belief that it belongs to verses 43 and 45 , for the Arcanum which it contains is so dangerous that it must be guarded in all possible ways. Perhaps even to call attention to it is a blind intended to prevent the reader from looking for some thing else. 46 .

If you can slay a thing at will it means that you can revive it at will, for the word “faculty” implies repeated action. 47 . The Self of Matter and the Self of Spirit can never me et. One of the twain must disappear; there is no place for both. This is a very difficult verse, because it appears so easy. It is not merely a question of Advaitism, it refers to the spiritual marriage.

This is again filled with deeper meaning than that which appears on the surface. The words “bud” and “worm” form a clue. 49 . Thou canst n ot travel on the Path before thou hast become that Path itself. Compare the scene in Parsifal, where the scenery comes to the knight instead of the knight going to the scenery. But there is also implied the doctrine of the tao, and only one who is an accom plished Taoist can hope to understand this verse. (See “The Hermit of Esopus Island,” part of The Magical Record of the Beast 666 , to be published in The Equinox , vol. III) 50 .

But let each burning human tear drop on thy heart and there remain; nor ever brush it off, until the pain that caused it is removed. This is a counsel never to forget the original stimulus which has driven you to the Path, the “first noble truth.” Everything is now “good.” This is why verse 53 says that these tears are the streams that irrigate the fields of charity immort al. (Tears, by the way. Think!) 53 . These tears, O thou of heart most merciful, these are the streams that irrigate the fields of charity immortal. ’Tis on such soil that grows the midnight blossom of Buddha, more difficult to find, more rare to view than is the flowers of the Vogay tree. It is the seed of freedom from rebirth. It isolates the Arhat both from strife and lust, it leads him through the fields of Being unto the peace and bliss known only in the land of Silence and Non - Being. The “midnight blo ssom” is a phrase connected with the doctrine of the Night of Pan, familiar to Masters of the Temple. “The Poppy that flowers in the dusk” is another name for it. A most secret Formula of Magick is connected with this “Heart of the Circle.” 54 . Kill out desire; but if thou killest it take heed lest from the dead it should again rise. By “desire” in all mystic treatises of any merit is meant tendency. Desire is manifested universally in the law of gravitation, in that of chemical attraction, and so on; in fact, everything that is done is caused by the desire to do it, in this technical sense of the word. The “midnight blossom” implies a certain monastic Renunciation of all desire, which reaches to all planes. One must however distinguish between desire, which means unnatural attraction to an ideal, and love, which is natural Motion."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"THE VOICE OF THE SILENCE 25 55 . Kill love of life, but if thou slayest Tanh a , let this not be for thirst of life eternal, but to replace the fleeting by the everlasting. This particularizes a special for m of desire.

Chafe not at Karma, nor at Nature’s changeless laws. But struggle only with the personal, the transitory, the evanescent and the perishable. The words “desire nothing” should be interpreted positively as well as negatively. The main sense of the rest of the verse is to advise the Disciple to work, and not to complain. 57 . Help Nature and work on with her; and Nature will regard thee as one of her creators and make obeisance. Although the object of the Disciple is to transcend Law, he must work through Law to attain this end. It may be remarked that this treatise — and this comment for th e most part — is written for disciples of certain grades only. It is altogether inferior to such Books as Liber CXI Aleph; but for that very reason, more useful, perhaps, to the average seeker. 58 . And she will open wide before thee the portals of her secr et chambers, lay bare before thy gaze the treasures hidden in the depths of her pure virgin bosom.

And then, the goal — beyond which he, bathed in the sunlight of the Spirit, glories untold, unseen by any save the eye of Soul. These gates are described in the third treatise. The words “spirit” and “soul” are highly ambiguous, and had better be regarded as po etic figures, without a technical meaning being sought. 60 . There is but one road to the Path; at its very end alone the voice of the Silence can be heard. The ladder by which the candidate ascends is formed of rungs of suffering and pain; these can be si lenced only by the voice of virtue. Woe, then, to thee, Disciple, if there is one single vice thou hast not left behind. For then the ladder will give way and overthrow thee; its foot rests in the deep mire of thy sins and failings, and ere thou canst at tempt to cross this wide abyss of matter thou hast to lave thy feet in Waters of Renunciation. Beware lest thou should’st set a foot still soiled upon the ladder’s lowest rung. Woe unto him who dares pollute one rung with miry feet.

His vices will take shape and drag him down. His sins will raise their voices like as the jackal ’s laugh and sob after the sun goes down; his thoughts become an army, and bear him off a captive slave.

This is particularly necessary in the matter of the aspiration. For if the aspiration be in any way impure, it means divergence in the will itself; and this is will’s one fatal flaw.

Just so with our first telescopes we discovered many new stars, and with each improvement in the instrument we have discovere d more. The second and more obvious meaning in the verse preaches the practice of Yama , Niyama , before serious prac tice is started, and this in actual life means, map out your career as well as you can. Decide to do so many hours’ work a day in such con ditions as may be possible. It does not mean that you should set up neuroses and hysteria by suppressing your natural instincts, which are perfectly right on their own plane, and only wrong when they invade other planes, and set up alien tyrannies. 61 . Ki ll thy desires, Lanoo, make thy vices impotent, ere the first step is taken on the solemn journey. By “desires” and “vices” are meant those things which you your self think to be inimical to the work; for each man they will be quite different, and any atte mpt to lay down a general rule leads to worse than confusion. 62 . Strangle thy sins, and make them dumb for ever, before thou dost lift one foot to mount the ladder. This is merely a repetition of verse 61 in different language. But remember: “The word of Sin is Restriction.” “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” 63 .

Merge into one sense thy senses, if th ou would’st be secure against the foe. ’Tis by that sense alone which lies concealed within the hollow of thy brain, that the steep path which leadeth to thy Master may be disclosed before thy Soul’s dim eyes.

But one’s past experiences must be built into one’s Pyramid, as one advances, layer by layer. One must also remark that this verse only applies to those who have not yet come to reconcile past, present, and future. Every incarnation is a Veil of Isis. 67 .

Hunger is not con quered by starvation. One’s attitude to all the necessities which the traditions of earthly life involve should be to rule them, neither by mortification nor by indulgence. In order to do the work you must keep in proper physical and mental condi tion. Be sane. Asceticism always excites the mind, and the object of the Disciple is to calm it. However, ascetic originally meant athletic, and it has only acquired its modern meaning on account of the corruptions that crept into the practices used by those i n “training.” The prohibitions, relatively valuable, were exalted into general rules. To “break training” is not a sin for anyone who is not in training. Incidentally, it takes all sorts to make a world. Imagine the stupidity of a universe full of Arha ns!

Behold, all those who knocking for admission, await [ sic ] in ignorance and darkness, to see the gate of the Sweet Law flung open! This begins with the wor d “And,” rather as if it were a sequel to The Voice of the Silence . It should not be assumed that this is the case. However, assuming that the first Fragment explains the Path as far as Master of the Temple, it is legitimate to regard this second Fragmen t, so called, as the further instruction; for the Master of the Temple must leave his personal progress to attend to that of other people, a task from which, 1 am bound to add, even the most patient of Masters feels at times a tendency to revolt! 2 .

The real reason of the compassion (so - called) of the Master is a perfectly practical and sensible one. It has nothing to do with the beautiful verses, “It is only the sorro ws of others Cast their shadows over me.” The Master has learnt the first noble truth: “Everything is sorrow,” and he has learnt that there is no such thing as separate existence.

On the plane of which Reason is Lord, all antinomies are irreconcilable. It is impossible for any one below the grade of Magister Templi even to begin to comprehend the resolution of them. This fragment of the imaginary Book of the Golden Precepts must be studied without ever losing sight of this fact. 3 .

Alas, that so few men should profit by the gift, the priceless boon of learning truth, the right perception of existing things, the Knowledge of the non existent! This is indeed a serious metaphysical complaint. The solution of it is not to be found in reason. 7 . Saith the Pupil: O Teacher, what shall 1 do to reach to Wisdom? O Wise one, what, to gain perfection? 8 . Search for the Paths. But, O Lanoo, be of clean heart before thou startest on thy journey. Before thou takest t hy first step learn to discern the real from the false, the ever - ileeting from the everlasting. Learn aboye all to separate Head - learning from Soul - Wisdom, the “Eye” from the “Heart” doctrine. The Authoress of these treatises is a little exacting in the nu mber of things that you have to do before you take your first step, most of them being things which more nearly resemble the diffi culties of the last step. But by learning to distinguish the “real from the false” is only meant a sort of elementary discer nment between things that are worth having and those that are not worth having, and, of course, the perception will alter with advance in knowledge.

Yea, ignorance is like unto a closed and airless vessel; the soul a bird shut up within. It warbles not, nor can it stir a feather; but the songster mute and torpid sits, and of exhaustion dies. The Soul, Atma, despite its posses sion of the attributes omni science, omnipotence, omnipresence, etc., is entirely bound and blindfolded by ignorance. The metaphysical puzzle to which this gives rise cannot be discussed here — it is insoluble by reason, though one may call attention to the inherent incommensura bility of a postulated absolute with an observed relative. 10 . But even ignorance is better than Head - learning with no Soul - wisdom to illuminate and guide it. The word “better” is used rather sentimentally, for, as “It is better to h ave loved and lost than never to have loved at all,” so it is better to be a madman than an idiot. There is always a chance of putting wrong right. As, however, the disease of the age is intellectualism, this lesson is well to teach. Numerous sermons on this point wilI be found in many of the writings of Frater Perdurabo. 11 . The seeds of Wisdom cannot sprout and grow in airless space. To live and reap experience the mind needs breadth and depth and points to draw it towards the Diamond Soul. Seek not t hose points in mãyä’s realm; but soar beyond illusions, search the eternal and the changeless SAT, mistrusting fancy’s false suggestions.

It needs the gentle breezes of Soul - Wisdom to brush away the dust of our illusions. Seek, O Beginner, to blend thy Mind and Soul. The charge is to eliminate rubbish from the Mind, and teaches that Soul - wisdom is the selective agent . But these Fragments will be most shamefully misinterpreted if a trace of sentimentality is allowed to creep in. “Soul - wisdom” does not mean “piety” and “nobility” and similar conceptions, which only flourish where truth is permanently lost, as in Engla nd. Soul - wisdom here means the Will. You should eliminate from your mind anything which does not subserve your real purpose. It was, however, said in verse 11 that the “mind needs breadth,” and this also is true, but if all the facts known to the Thinker are properly coordi nated and connected causally, and by necessity, the ideal mind will be attained, for although complex it will be unified.

Avert thy face from world deceptions; mistrust thy senses, they are false. But within thy body — the shrine of thy sensations — seek in the Impersonal for the “eternal man”; and having sought him out, l ook inward: thou art Buddha. “Shun ignorance”: Keep on acquiring facts. “Shun illusion”: Refer every fact to the ultimate reality. “Interpret every phenomenon as a particular dealing of God with your Soul.”"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 40 “Mistrust thy senses”: Avoid superficial judgmen t of the facts which they present to you. The last paragraph gives too succinct a statement of the facts. The attainment of the knowledge of the Holy Guardian Angel is only the “next step.” It does not imply Buddhahood by any means. 14 . Shun praise, O Dev otee. Praise leads to self - delusion. Thy body is not Self, thy SELF is in itself without a body, and either praise or blame affects it not. Pride is an expansion of the Ego, and the Ego must be destroyed. Pride is its protective sheath, and hence excepti onally dangerous, but this is a mystical truth concerning the inner life. The Adept is anything but a “creeping Jesus.” 15 . Self - gratulation, O disciple, is like unto a lofty tower, up which a haughty fool has climbed. Thereon he sits in prideful solitud e and unperceived by any but himself.

The “Doctrine of the Eye” is for the crowd, the “Doctrine of the Heart” for the elect.

It grinds by night and day. The worthless husks it drives from out the golden grain, the refuse from the flour. The hand of karma guides the wheel; the revolutions mark the beatings of the karmic heart. The subject of elimination is here further developed. The favourite Eastern image of the Wheel of the Good Law is difficult to West ern minds, and the whole metaphor appears to us somewhat confused. 19 . True knowledge is the flour, false learning is the husk. If thou would’st eat the bread of Wisdom, thy flour thou hast to knead with Amrita’s clear waters. But if thou kneadest husks w ith M a y a ’s dew, thou canst create but food for the black doves of death, the birds of birth, decay and sorrow. “Amrita” means not only Immortality, but is the technical name of the Divine force which descends upon man, but which is burnt up by his tendenci es, by the forces which make him what he is. It is also a certain Elixir which is the Menstruum of Harpocrates. Amrita here is best interpreted thus, for it is in opposition to “M a y a .” To interpret illusion is to make conf usion more confused. 20 .

He himself came eating and drinking; and they called him a gluttonous man and a wine bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. The Adept does what he likes, or rather what he wills, and allows nothing to interfere with it, but because he is ascetic in the sense that he has no appetite for the stale stupidities which fools call pleasure, people expect him to refuse things both natural and necessary. Some people are so hypocritical that they claim their di slikes as virtue, and so the poor, weedy, unhealthy degenerate who cannot smoke because his heart is out of order, and cannot drink because his brain is too weak to stand it, or perhaps because his doctor has forbidden him to do either for the next two yea rs, the man who is afraid of life, afraid to do anything lest some result should follow, is acclaimed as the best and greatest of mankind. It is very amusing in England to watch the snobbishness, particularly of the middle classes, and their absurd aping o f their betters, while the cream of the jest is that the morality to which the middle classes cling does not exist in good society. Those who have Master Souls refuse to be bound by anything but their own wills. They may refrain from certain actions beca use their main purpose would be interfered with, just as a man refrains from smoking if he is training for a boat - race; and those in whom cunning is stronger than self - respect sometimes dupe the populace by ostentatiously refraining from certain actions, w hile, however, they perform them in private. Especially of recent years, some Adepts have thought it wise either to refrain or to pretend to refrain from various things in order to increase their influence. This is a great folly.

This verse explains that the Adept has no business to break up his domestic circumstances. The Rosicrucian Doctrine that the Adept should be a man of the world, is much nobler than that of the hermit. If the Ascetic Doctrine is carried to its logical conclu sion, a stone is holier than Buddha himself. Read, however, Liber CLVI . (See The Equino x , also Book 4, part III, appendix VII .) 22 . Thus teach the Tirthikas, the unbelievers . It is a little difficult to justify the epithet “unbeliever” — it seems to me that on the contrary they are the believers.

If thou art taught that sin is born of action and bliss of absolute inaction, then tell them that they err. Non - permanence of human action, deliverance of mind from thralldom by the cessation of sin and faults, are not for “Deva Egos.” Thus saith the “Doctrine of the Heart.” This Doctrine is further developed. The term “deva Egos” is again obscure. The verse teaches that one should not be afraid to act. Action must be fought by reaction, and tyranny will never be overthrown by slavish submission to it.

The desire of the flesh has ever grown stronger for ascetics, as they endeavored to combat it by abstinence, and when with old age their functions are atrophied, they proclaim vaingloriously “I have conquered.” The way to conquer any desire is to under stand it, and freedom consists in the ability to decide whether or no you will perform any given action. The Adept should always be ready to abide by the toss of a coin, and remain absolutely indifferent as to whether it falls head or tail. 2 4 . The Dharma (law) of the “Eye” is the embodiment of the external, and the non - existing. By “non - existing” is meant the lower Asat. The word is used on other occasions to mean an Asat which is higher than, and beyond, Sat. 25 .

The Lamp burns bright when wick and oil are clean. To make them clean a cleaner is required. The flame feels not the process of the cleaning. “The branches of the tree are shaken by the wind; the trunk remains unmoved.” This verse again refers to the process of selection and elimination already described. The aspiration must be considered as un af fected by this process except in so far as it becomes brighter and clearer in consequence of it. The last sentence seems again to refer to this question of asceticism. The Adept is not affected by his actions. 27 .

Believe thou not that sitting in dark forests, in proud seclusion and apart from men; believe thou not that life on roots and plants, that thirst a ssuaged with snow from the great Range — believe thou not, O Devotee, that this will lead thee to the goal of final liberation. 30 . Think not that breaking bone, that rending flesh and muscle, unites thee to thy “silent Self.” Think not, that when the sins of thy gross form are conquered, O Victim of thy Shadows, thy duty is accomplished by nature and by man. Once again the ascetic life is forbidden. It is moreover shown to be a delusion that the ascetic life assists liberation. The ascetic thinks that by r educing himself to the condition of a vegetable he is advanced upon the path of Evolution. It is not so. Minerals have no inherent power of motion save intramolecularly. Plants grow and move, though but little. Animals are free to move o every direction, and space itself is no hindrance to the higher principles of man.

These would prevent incarnation. The Dharmakaya body is what may be described as the final sublimation of an individual. It is a bodiless flame on the point of mingling with the infinite flame. A description of the state of one who is in this body is given in “The Hermit of Æsopus Island.” Such is a rough account of these “robes” according to Mme. Blavatsky. She further adds that the Dharmakaya body has to be renounced by anyone who wants to help humanity. Now, helping humanity is a very nice thing for those who like it, and no doubt those who do so deserve well of their fellows.

In fact, one who is helping humanity is constantly in need of a wash and brush - up from time to time. There is nothing quite so contaminating as humanity, especially Theoso phists, as Mme.

It is perfectly all right to use this Elixir for energy and youth, but despite all, impressions keep on cluttering up the mind, and once in a while it is certainly a splendid thing for everybody to have the Spring Cleaning of death. With regard to one’s purpose in doing anything at all, it depends on the nature of one’s Star . Blavatsky was horribly hampered by the Trance of Sorrow.

No longer can the perfect Buddhas, who don the Dharmak a ya glory, help man’s salvation. Alas! shall SELVES be sacrificed to Self , mankind, unto the weah of Units?

The words “selfish bliss” must not be taken in a literal sense. It is exceedingly difficult to discuss this question. The Occidental mind finds it difficult even to attach any meaning to the condi tions of Nirvana. Partly it is the fault of lang uage, partly it is due to the fact that the condition of Arhat is quite beyond thought. He is beyond the Abyss, and there a thing is only true in so far as it is self - contradictory. The Arhat has no self to be blissful.

To reach Nirvana’s bliss but to renounce it, is the supreme, the final step — the highest on Renunciation’s Path. All this about Gautama Buddha having renounced Nirvana is apparently all a pure invention of Mme. Blavatsky, and has no authority in the Budd hist canon. The Buddha is referred to, again and again, as having “passed away by that kind of passing away which heaves nothing whatever behind.” The account of his doing this is given in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta; and it was the contention of the Theos ophists that this “great, sublime, Nibbana story” was something peculiar to Gautama Buddha. They began to talk about Parinibbana, super - Nibbana, as if there were some way of subtracting one from one which would leave a higher, superior kind of a nothing, or as if there were some way of blowing out a candle which would heave Moses in a much more Egyptian darkness than we ever supposed when we were children. This is not science. This is not business. This is American Sunday journalism. The Hindu and the Am erican are very much alike in this innocence, this naïveté which demands fairy stories with ever bigger giants.

So, they are always talking in superlatives, and are hard put to it when t he facts catch up with them, and they have to invent new superlatives.

The other man wishes to show off by having a supreme God than that, and when a third man comes along and finds them disputing, it is up to him to invent a supremest super - God. It is simply ridiculous to try to add to the definition of Nibbana by this invention of Parinibbana, and only talkers busy themselves with these fa ntastic speculations.

The reader is most strongly urged nor to permit himself to indulge in fantastic flights of thought, which ar e the poison of the mind, because they represent an attempt to run away from reality, a dispersion of energy and a corruption of moral strength. His business is, firstly, to know himself; secondly, to order and control himself; thirdly, to develop himself on sound organic lines little by little. The rest is only leather and Prunella.

But after reaching the supreme triad, he aspires downward. He keeps on adding to all that he has or is, but after another manner.

Now, although one is flung forth again acros s the Abyss, as explained in Liber CDXVIII , and undergoes quite normal mental experiences, yet they are no longer taken seriously, for they have not the power to delude. There is no question of Sages daring to still the fruit of Karma. I do not quite know how one would set about stilling a fruit, by the way. But the more sage one is, the less one wants to interfere with law. There is a special comment upon this point in Liber Aleph. Most of the pleasures in life, and most of the education in life, are gi ven by superable obstacles. Sport, including love, depends on the overcoming of artificial or imagi nary resistances. Golf has been defined as trying to knock a little ball into a hole with a set of instruments very ill - adapted for the purpose. In Chess one is bound by purely arbitrary rules. The most successful courtesans are those who have the most tricks in their bags. I will not argue that this complexity is better than the Way of the Tao.

Here is further metaphysical difficulty. One kind of nothing, by taking its pleasures sadly, becomes an altogether superior kind of nothing. It is with no hope of personal advancement that the Masters teach. Personal advancement has ceased to have any meaning long before one becomes a Master.

A dog does not become doggy by the renunciation of non - dogginess. It is quite true that you and I value one kind of a Buddha more than another kind of a Buddha, but the Universe is not framed in accordance with what you and I like. As Zoroaster says: “The pro gression of the Stars was not generated for your sake,” and there are times when a Dhamma - Buddha reflects on the fact that he is no more and no less than any other thing, and wishes he were dead.

But he is assuredly quite indifferent to the praise and blame of the “suffering fellow - men.” He does not want their gratitude. We will now close this painful subject. 88 . Behold!

Madame Blavatsky’s method of exegesis, in the absence of original inf ormation, was to take existing commentators and disagree with them, her standard being what the unknown originals ought, in her opinion, to have said. This method saves much of the labour of research, and with a little luck it ought to be possible to disc over subsequently much justification in the originals as they become known. Madame Blavatsky was justified in employing this method because she really did know the subject better than either commentator or original. She merely used Oriental lore as an Os trich hunter uses the skin of a dead bird. She was Ulysses, and the East her Wooden Horse.

There is a great deal of pious gassing about most Teachers — it is very easy to say “Be good and you will be happy,” and I am afraid that even this book itself has been taken as little better by the majority of its admirers. What the pupil wants is not vague generalizations on virtue, not analyses of Nirv a na and explorations in Hindu metaphysics, but a plain str aightforward statement of a practical character. When a man is meditating and finds himself interfered with by some particular class of thought, he does not want to know about the glory of the Buddha and the advantages of the Dhamma and the fraternal piet y of the Sangha. He wants to know how to stop those thoughts arising, and the only person who can help him to do that is a Teacher who has been troubled by those same thoughts, and learnt how to stop them in his own case.

This is characteristic of practically all writing on Eastern thought. What was wanted was a Master of some Occidental language to obtain the experiences of the East by undertaking the practices of the East. His own experience put into words would then form a far better translation of Oriental works on the same subject, than any translation which a scholar might furnish.

Once thou hast passed the gate Srot a patti, “ he who the stream hath entered”; once thy foot hath pressed the bed of the Nirv a nic stream in this or any future life, thou hast but seven other births before thee, O thou of adamantine Will. The author does not state what is meant by the “golden rule.” A Srot a patti is a person in such a stage that he will become Arhan after seven more incarnations. 1 There is nothing in Buddhism about the voluntary undertaking of incarnations in order to help mankind. And of course the talk about “Nirv a nic bliss” is misle ading when one reflects that this quality of bliss or Ananda arising with the first Jhana , has already disappeared, never to return, in the second. The whole question of Nibbana is hopelessly entangled with moonshine metaphysic and misinterpretation and fa lse tradition. It must be remembered that Nibbana is merely the Pali, the vulgar dialect, for the Sanskrit NIRVANA , and that Nirv a na is a state characterizing Moksha , which is the liberation resulting from Nirvikalpa - Sam a dhi. But then Mokhsa is defined b y the Hindus as unity with Parabrahman; and Parabrahman is without quantity or quality, not subject to change in any way, altogether beyond Manvantara and Pralaya; and so on. In one sense he is pure Atman.    1 See Crowley’s “The Three Characteristics” in his The Sword of So ng for an amusing but illuminated story on this state."},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 75 Now the Buddhist rejects Atman, saying there is no such thing. Therefore — to him — there is no Parabrahman. There is really Mah a Brahm a , who is (ultimately) subject to change, and, when the Karma which has made him Mah a Brahm a is exhausted, may be reincarnated as a pig or a Pisacha. Consequently Moksha is not liberation at all, for Nirv a na means cessation of that which, after however long a period, may change. This is all clear enough, but then the Buddhist goes on and takes the word Nibbana to mean exactly that which the Hindus meant by Nirvana, insistin g strenuously that it is entirely different. And so indeed it is. But if one proceeds further to enquire, “Then what is it?” one finds oneself involved in very considerable difficulty. It is a difficulty which I cannot pretend to solve, even by the logi c which obtains above the abyss. I can, however, exhibit the difficulty by relating a conversation which I had with Bhikkhu Ananda Metteyya in November, 1906 , while I was staying with him in his Monastery outside Rangoon. I was arguing that result was th e direct effect of the work of the student. If he went on long enough he was bound to succeed, and he might reasonably infer a causal connection between his work and its result. The Bhikkhu was not unwilling to admit that this might be so in such element ary stages as Jh a na, but with regard to the attaining of Arhatship he argued that it depended rather on universal Karma than on that created by the aspirant. Avoiding metaphys ical quibbles as to whether these two kinds of Karma are not identical, he figu red the situation in this manner. There are two wheels, one of which is the wheel of Nibbana, and the other that of the attainment of the Adept. These two wheels only touch at one point. Now the Arhat may reach the circumference of his wheel, that is, th e summit of his attainment, as often as he likes, but unless he happens to do so at the moment when"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 76 that point touches the wheel of Nibbana, he will not become an Arhat, and it is therefore necessary for him to remain at that summit as long as possibhe, in fact always, in order that bye and bye — it might be after many incarnations of perfection — these two might coin cide. This perfection he regarded not as that of spiritual experi ence, but as the attainment of Sila, and by Sila he meant the strict observanc e of the rules laid down by the Buddha for the Bhikkhu. He continued that the Buddha had apparently attached far more importance to virtue than to any degree of spiritual attainment, placing the well - behaved Bhikkhu not only above the gods, but above the greatest Yogis. (It is obvious, to the Buddhist, that Hindu Yogis, however eminent, are not Arhats.) He said that the rules !aid down for Bhikkhus created the condi tions necessary. A good Bhikkhu, with no spiritual experience, had at least some chance , whereas the bad Bhikkhu or non - Bhikkhu , although every form of Sam a dhi was at his fingers’ ends, had none. The point is very important, because on this theory the latter, after all his attainments, might pass through all the Dhyana - Lokas and through th e Arupa - Brahma - Lokas, exhaust that Karma, be reincarnated as a Spirochætes Pallida, and have to begin over again. And the most virtuous Bhikkhu might be so unfortunate as to fall from Virtue the millionth part of a second before his point on the circumfer ence of the sphere was going to touch that of the wheel of Nibbana, regain it two millionths of a second later, and thus find arhat - ship indefinitely postponed. I then said: O most excellent expounder of the good Law, prithee explain to me the exact differ ence between this Doctrine and that which we heard from Shri Par a nanda that the attainment of Sam a dhi, though it depended to some extent upon the attain ment of the Yogi, depended also upon"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 77 the grace of the Lord Shiva, and that Yoga did us no good unless the Lord Shiva happened to be in a good temper. Then the Bhikkhu rephied in a dramatic whisper, “There is no difference, except that it is not Buddhism.” From this example the Student will understand that he had better not worry about Nibb a na and its nat ure, but confine himself to controlling his thoughts. 7 . Look on. What see’st thou before thine eye, O aspirant to god - like Wisdom? 8 . “The cloak of darkness is upon the deep of matter; within its folds I struggle. Beneath my gaze it deepens, Lord; it is dispelled beneath the waving of thy hand. A shadow moveth, creeping hike the stretching serpent coils . . . It grows, swells out and disappears in darkness.” In this passage a definite vision is presented to the Lanoo. This can be done by an Adept, an d sometimes it is a useful method. 9 . It is the shadow of thyself outside the PATH, cast on the darkness of thy sins. This charming poetic image should not be taken literally. 10 . “Yea, Lord; I see the PATH; its foot in mire, its summit lost in glorious hight Nirv a nic. And now I see the ever narrowing Portals on the hard and thorny way to Gny a na.” This continues a vision which resembles, only more painfully, the coloured prints of the Broad and Narrow Ways so familiar to those unfortunates whose business takes them through Pater noster Row. 11 .

Nirv a na is frequently spoken of as an island in Buddhist writings, but I am not familiar with any passage in which the metaphor is that of a place at the other end of a journey. The metaphor moreover is mixed. In the hast verse he was climbing a ladder; now he is going across the waters, and neither on ladders nor in journeys b y water does one usually pass through Portals. 12. 1 . DANA, the key of charity and hove immortal. 2 . SHILA, the key of Harmony in word and act, the key that counterbalances the cause and the effect, and leaves no further room for Karmic action. 3 . KSHANTI , patience sweet, that nought can ruffle. 4 . VAIRAGYA, indifference to pleasure and to pain, illusion conquered, truth alone perceived. 5 . VIRYA, the dauntless energy that fights its way to the supernal TRUTH, out of the mire of lies terrestrial. 6 . DHYANA , whose golden gate once opened heads the narjol toward the realm of Sat eternal and its ceaseless contemplation. 7 . PRAJNA, the key to which makes of a man a God, creating him a Bodhisattva, son of the Dhy a nis. Such to the Portals are the golden keys. (S ubsection I.) Charity and love are here used in their technical sense, Agapé . “Love is the law, love under will.” Both Agapé and Thelema (“will”) add to 93 , which identifies"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 79 them qabalistically. This love is not a sloppy feeling of maudlin sentimental k indness. The majority of people of the Christian Science, Theosophical, New Thought type, think that a lot of flabby thoughts, sending out streams of love in the Six Quarters, and so on, will help them. It won’t. Love is a pure flame, as swift and deadly as the lightning. This is the kind of love that the Student needs. (Subsection II.) The “key” here spoken of has been thoroughly explained in Thien Tao in Konx Om Pax, but there is a peculiar method, apart from this plane, and easily understood by the e quilibrium by which things can be done which bear no fruit. And this method it is quite impossible to explain. The nearest I can come to intelligibility, is to say that you get very nearly the same sort of feeling as you do when you are making yourself in visible. Shila is in no way connected with the charming Irish colleen of the same name. (Subsection III.) The “patience” here spoken of seems to imply courage of a very active kind. It is the quality which persists in spite of all opposi tion. It must n ot be forgotten that the word “patience” is derived from Patior, “I suffer.” But, especially with the ancients, suffering was not conceived of as a purely passive function. It was keenly active and intensely enjoyable. There are certain words today stil l extant in which the original meaning of this word lingers, and consideration may suggest to the Student the true and secret meaning of this passage, “Accendat in nobis Dorninus ignem sui amoris et flammam æternæ caritatis,” a phrase with the subtle ambig uity which the classics found the finest form of wit. (Subsection IV.) This indifference is very much the same as what is usually spoken of as non - attachment. The"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 80 Doctrine has been rediscov ered in the West, and is usually announced as “Art for Art’s sak e.” This quality is most entirely necessary in Yoga. In times of dryness the “Devil” comes to you and persuades you that if you go on meditating or doing Pran a y a ma , or whatever it is you may be at, you will go mad. He will also prove to you that it is mo st necessary for your spiritual progress to repose. He will explain that, by the great law of action and reaction, you should alternate the task which you have set out to do with something else, that you should, in fact, somehow or other change your plans . Any attempt to argue with him will assuredly result in defeat. You must be able to reply, “But I am not in the least interested in my spiritual progress; I am doing this because I put it down in my programme to do it. It may hurt my spiritual progress more than anything in the world. That does not matter. I will gladly be damned eternally, but I will not break my obligation in the smallest detail.” By doing this you come out at the other end, and discover that the whole controversy was illusion. On e does become blind; one does have to fight one’s way through the ocean of asphalt. Hope and Faith are no more. All that can be done is to guard Love, the original source of your energy, by the mask of indifference. This image is a little misleading, pe rhaps. It must not be supposed that the indifference is a cloak; it must be a real indifference. Desire of any kind must really be conquered, for of course every desire is as it were a string on you to pull you in some direction, and it must be remembere d that Nirv a na lies (as it were) in no direction, like the fourth dimension in space.

Yet these confirm the choice. It is free — it has a will of its own quite independent of the conscious will of the man bearing it. It has no conscience. I t leaps. It has no consideration for anything but its own purpose. Again and again this symbol in a new sense will recur as the type of the ideal. It is a symbol alike of the Begin ning, the Way and the End. In this particular passage it is however pri ncipally synonymous with Will, and Will has been so fully dealt with in Book 4, Part II, that it will save trouble if we assume that the reader is familiar with that masterpiece. (Subjection VI.) This, too, has been carefully described in Book 4 , Part I. There is a distinction between Buddhist “Jh a na” and Sanskrit Dh y ana, though etymologically the former is a corruption of the latter. The craze for classification which obsesses the dull minds of the learned has been peculiarly pernicious in the East. In o rder to divide states of thought into 84 classes, which is — to their fatuity! — an object in itself, because 84 is seven times twelve, they do not hesitate to invent names for quite imaginary states of mind, and to put down the same state of mind several time s. This leads to extreme difficulty in the study of their works on psychology and the like. The original man, Buddha, or whoever he may have been, dug out of his mind a sufficient number of jewels, and the wretched intellectuals who edited his work have ad ded bits of glass to make up the string. The result has been that many scholars have thought that the whole psychology of the East was pure bluff. A similar remark is true of the philos ophy of the West, where the Schoolmen produced an equal obfuscation. Even now people hardly realize that they did any valuable work at all, and quote their controversies, such"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 82 as that concerning the number of angels who can dance on the point of a needle, as examples of their complete fatuity and donnishness. In point of fact, it is the critic who is stupid. The question about the angels involves the profoundest considerations of meta physics, and it was about these that the battle raged. I fancy that their critics imagine the Schoolmen disputing whether the number was 25 or 26 , which argues their own shallowness by the readiness with which they attribute the same quality to others. However, a great deal of mischief has been done by the pedant, and the distinctions between the various Jh a nas will convey little to the We stern mind, even of a man who has some experience of them. The question of mistranslation alone renders the majority of Buddhist documents, if not valueless, at least unreliable. We, however, taking this book as an original work by Blavatsky, need not be bothered by any doubts more deadly than that as to whether her command of English was perfect; and in this trea tise, in spite of certain obvious sentimentalities and bombasticisms, we find at least the foundations of a fairly fine style. I think that wh at she says in this subsection refers to a statement which I got from my Guru in Madura to the effect that there was a certain point in the body suitable for meditation, which, if once discovered, drew the thought naturally towards itself, the difficulty o f concentration consequently disappearing, and that the knowledge of this particular point could be communicated by the Guru to his approved disciples. (Subsection VII.) We now find a muddle between the keys and the gates. The first five are obviously k eys. The last two seem to be gates, in spite of the statements in the text. We also find the term Bodhisattva in a quite unintelligible sense. We shall discuss this question more fully a little later on."},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 83 The Dhyanis are gods of sorts, either perfect men or what one may cali natural gods, who occupy eternity in a ceaseless contemplation of the Universe. The Master of the Temple, as he is in himself, is a rather similar person. Narjol is the Path - Treader, not a paraffin - purgative. 13 . Before thou canst appr oach the last, O weaver of thy freedom, thou hast to master these P a ramit a s of perfection — the virtues transcendental six and ten in number — along the weary Path. We now get back to the P a ramit a s , and this treatise is apparently silent with regard to them. Does any one regret it? It isn’t the Path that is weary: it is the Sermons on the way. 14 . For, O Disciple! Before thou wert made fit to meet thy Teacher face to face, thy MASTER light to light, what wert thou told? The old trouble recurs. We cannot tell quite clearly in what stage the Disciple is supposed to be with regard to any given piece of instruction. 15 . Before thou canst approach the foremost gate thou hast to learn to part thy body from thy mind, to dissipate the shadow, and to live in the etern al. For this, thou hast to live and breathe in all, as all that thou perceivest breathes in thee; to feel thyself abiding in all things, all things in SELF. In verse 13 we were told to master the P a ramit a s before approaching the last gate. Now the author harks back to what he had to do before he approached the first gate, but this may be regarded as a sort of a joke on the part of the Guru. The Guru has a weary time, and frequently amuses himself by telling the pupil that he must do something obviously im possible before he begins. This increases the respect of"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 84 the pupil for the Guru, and in this way helps him, while at the same time his air of hopeless ness is intensely funny — to the Guru. So we find in this verse that the final result, or something very like it, is given as a qualifica tion antecedent to the starting point; as if one told a blind man that he must be able to see through a brick wall before regaining his eyesight. 16 . Thou shalt not let thy senses make a playground of thy mind. Following on the tremendous task of verse 15 comes the obvious elementary piece of instruction which one gives to a beginner. The best way out of the dilemma is to take verse 15 in a very elementary sense. Let us paraphrase that verse. “Try to get into the habit of thinking of your mind and body as distinct. Attach yourself to matters of eternal importance, and do not be deluded by the idea that the material universe is real. Try to realize the unity of being.” That is a sensible and suitable instruction, a kind o f adumbration of the goal. It harmonizes emotional and intellectual conceptions to — that which subsequently turns out not to be reality. 17 . Thou shalt not separate thy being from BEING, and the rest, but merge the Ocean in the deep, the drop within the Oce an. This too can be considered in an elementary light as meaning: “Begin even at once to destroy the sense of separateness.” 18 . So shalt thou be in full accord with all that lives; bear love to men as though they were thy brother - pupils, disciples of one Teacher, the sons of one sweet mother. It now becomes clear that ah this is meant in an elementary sense, for verse 18 is really little more than a"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 85 statement that an irritable frame of mind is bad for meditation. Of course anybody who really “bore love,” e tc., as requested would be suffering from softening of the brain. That is, if you take ah this in its obvious literal sense. There is a clean way of Love, but it is not this toshy slop treacle - goo. 19 . Of teachers there are many; the MASTER - SOUL is one, Al aya, the Universal Soul. Live in that MASTER as ITS ray in thee. Live in thy fellows as they live in IT. Here the killing of the sense of separateness is further advised. It is a description of the nature of Atman, and Atman is, as else where stated, not a Buddhist, but a Hindu idea. The teaching is here to refer everything to Atman, to regard everything as a corruption of Atman, if you please, but a corruption which is unreal, because Atman is the only real thing. There is a similar instruction in Libe r Legis: “Let there be no difference made among you between any one thing & any other thing”; and you are urged not to “confound the space - marks, saying: They are one; or saying, They are many.” 20 . Before thou standest on the threshold of the Path; before thou crossest the foremost Gate, thou hast to merge the two into the One and sacrifice the personal to SELF impersonal, and thus destroy the “path” between the two — Antas - Karana. Here is again the confusion noted with regard to verse 15 — for the destruction of the lower Manas implies an attainment not less than that of a Master of the Temple. 21 . Thou hast to be prepared to answer Dharma, the stern law, whose voice will ask thee first at thy initial step:"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 86 22 . “Hast thou complied with the rules, O thou of lo fty hopes? “Hast thou attuned thy heart and mind to the great mind and heart of all mankind? For as the sacred River’s roaring voice whereby all Nature - sounds are echoed back, so must the heart of him ‘who in the stream would enter,’ thrill in response to every sigh and thought of all that lives and breathes.” Here is another absurdity. What is the sense of asking a man at his initial step if he has complied with all the rules? If the disciple were in the condition mentioned, he would be already very far advanced. But of course if we were to take the words “The threshold of the Path” “The foremost gate” “The stream” as equivalent to Srotapatti , the passage would gain in intelligibility. But, just as in the noble eight - fold Path, the steps are concurrent, not consecutive, so, like the Comte de Saint Germain, when he was expelled from Berlin, one can go through all the seven Gates at once. 23 . Disciples may be likened to the strings of the soulechoing Vin a ; mankind, unto its sounding board; the hand that sw eeps it to the tuneful breath of the GREAT WORLD - SOUL.

They have to be attuned to the Up a d hy a ya’s mind — one with the Over - Soul, — or, break away. This is a somewhat high - flown description — it is little more than an advocacy of docility, a quiet acceptance of the situation as it is, and an acquiescence in the ultimate sublime"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 87 purpose. The question of the crossing of the abyss now arises, and we reach a consideration of the Brothers of the Left Hand Path. 24 . Thus do the “Brothers of the Shadow” — the murder - ers of their Souls, the dread Dad - Dugpa clan . “The Brothers of the Shadow” or of the Left Hand Path are very carefully explained in Liber 418. The Exempt Adept, when he has to proceed, has a choice either to fling himself into the Abyss by all that he has and is being torn away, or to shut himself up to do what he imagines to be continuing with his personal devel opment on very much the original lines. This latter course does not take him through the Abyss; but fixes him in Daäth, at the crown of a false Tree of Life in which the Supernal Triad is missing. Now this man is also called a Black Magici an, and a great deal of confusion has arisen in connection with this phrase. Even the Author, to judge by the Note, seems to confuse the matter. Red Caps and Yellow Gaps alike are in general altogether beneath the stage of which we have been speaking. A nd from the point of view of the Master of the Temple, there is very little to choose between White and Black Magic as ordinarily under stood by the man in the Street, who distinguishes between them according as they are helpful or hurtful to himself. If the Magician cures his headache, or gives him a good tip on the Stock Exchange, he is a White Magician. If he suspects him of causing illness and the like, he is Black. To the Master of the Temple either proceeding appears blind and stupid. In the lower stages there is only one way right, and all the rest wrong. You are to aspire to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, and of course to do any other things which may subserve that one purpose; but nothing else. And of"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 88 course it is a mistake, unless under very special circum - stances, to perform any miracles, on the ground that they diminish the supreme energy reserved for the performance of the Main Task. It will be remembered that the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel is attributed to Tiphareth, while the Exempt Adept is in Chesed; how is it then that a Black Magician, a Brother of the Left Hand Path, can ever reach that grade? The answer is given in the eleventh Æthyr; when the Exempt Adept reaches the Fron - tier of the Abyss, his Holy Guardian Angel leaves him, and this is the one supreme terror of that passage. It seems extraordinary that one who has ever enjoyed His Knowledge and Conversation should afterwards fall away into that blind horror whose name is Cho ronzon. But such is the case. Some of the problems, or rather, mysteries, connected with this are too deep to enter upon in this place, but the main point to remember is this, that in the Outer Order, and in the College of Adepts itself, it is not certai n to what end any one may come. The greatest and holiest of the Exempt Adepts may, in a single moment, become a Brother of the Left Hand Path. It is for this reason that the Great White Brotherhood admits no essential connection with the lower branches a ffiliated to The Order. At the same time, The Brothers of the A ∴ A ∴ refuse none. They have no objection to any one claiming to be one of Themselves. If he does so, let him abide by it. 25 . Hast thou attuned thy being to Humanity’s great pain, O candidate for light? Thou hast? . . . Thou mayest enter. Yet, ere thou set test foot upon the dreary Path of sorrow, ‘tis well thou shouhd’st first learn the pitfalls on thy way. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 89 It appears as if the condition of entering the Path was the Vision of Sorrow, and of course the present Commentator might be inclined to support this theory, since, in his own experience, it was this Vision of Sorrow which caused him to take the First Great Oath. He had suddenly presented to him the perception of the Three Characteristics. This is fully narrated in Book 4, Part IV. It is also evident that aspiration implies dissatisfaction of some sort. But at the same time I do not think that in all cases it is necessary that this dissatisfaction should be so conscious and so universal as appears to be implied in the text . 26 . Armed with the key of Charity, of love and tender mercy, thou art secure before the gate of D a na, the gate that standeth at the entrance of the path. 27 . Behold, O happy Pilgrim! The portal that faceth thee is high and wide, seems easy of access. The road that heads therethrough is straight and smooth and green. ‘Tis hike a sunny glade in the dark forest depths, a spot on earth mirrored from Amit a bha’s paradise. There, nightingales of hope and birds of radiant plumage sing perched in green bowers, cha nting success to fearless Pilgrims. They sing of Bodhisattva’s virtues five, the fivefold source of Bodhi power, and of the seven steps in Knowledge. 28 . Pass on! For thou hast brought the key; thou art secure. The row of dots in the text (after verse 25 ) appears to imply complete change of subject, though on other occasions it did not do so. I have already explained one of the technical meanings of D a na , and undoubtedly the Path seems attractive at this stage. One thinks of the joyous reception"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 90 into the Company of Adepts. One goes almost as a boy goes to meet his first sweetheart. But there is here another allusion to the beginnings of Medi tation, when everything seems so simple and straightforward, and withal so easy and pleasant. There is something i ntensely human about this. Men set out upon the most dangerous expedi tions in high spirits. 29 . And to the second gate the way is verdant too. But it is steep and winds up hill; yea, to its rocky top. Grey mists will over - hang its rough and stony height, and be dark beyond. As on he goes, the song of hope soundeth more feeble in the pilgrim’s heart. The thrill of doubt is now upon him; his step less steady grows. Following the last comment a description of this Path refers to the beginning of “dryness” in the course of Meditation. 30 . Beware of this, O candidate! Beware of fear that spreadeth, like the black and soundless wings of midnight bat, between the moonlight of thy Soul and thy great goal that loometh in the distance far away. This passage also a ppears to have reference to the early life of the Student — hence he is specially warned against fear. Fear is, of course, the first of the pylons through which one passes in the Egyptian system. It is important then to arrange one’s life in such a way tha t one never allows one thing to interfere with another, and one never makes trouble for oneself. The method given in Thien Tao is the best to employ. 31 . Fear, O disciple, kills the will and stays all action. If lacking in the Shila virtue — the pilgrim tri ps, and Karmic pebbles bruise his feet along the rocky path."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 91 The objection to fear is not only the obvious one. Fear is only one of the things which interfere with concentration. The reac tion against fear leads to over - boldness. Anything which inter fe res with the perfect unconscious simplicity of one’s going leads to bruises. Troubles of this kind may be called Karmic , because it is events in the past which give occasion for trouble. 32 . Be of sure foot, O Candidate. In ksh a nti’s essence bathe thy Sou l; for now thou dost approach the Portal of that name, the gate of fortitude and patience. We now come to the third gate. Notice that this is a further confusion of the Portal with the Key. As previously said, patience here implies rather self - control, a refusal to accept even favours until one is ready for them. 33 . Close not thine eyes, nor lose thy sight of Dorje (the Svastika); M a ra’s arrows ever smite the man who has not reached Vair a ga. “Glose not thine eyes” may refer to sleep or to ecstasy, perhap s to both. Dorje is the whirling power which throws off from itself every other influence. Vair a ga is a very definite stage in moral strength. The point is that it is one’s intense longing for ecstasy which makes one yield to it. If one does so, one is ov erwhelmed with the illusion, for even the highest ecstasy is still illusion. The result, in many cases, of obtaining Dhy a na is that the workers cease to work. Vair a ga is an indifference approaching disgust for everything. It reminds one a good deal of t he Oxford Manner. Cambridge men have this feeling, but do not think other people worth the trouble of flattering."},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 92 34 . Beware of trembling. ’Neath the breath of fear the key of ksh a nti rusty grows: the rusty key refuseth to unlock. The word “trembling” se ems to imply that it is giddy ecstasy which is referred to, and the “fear” here spoken of may perhaps be the Panic Fear, possibly some feeling analogous to that which produces what is called psychical impotence. 35 . The more thou dost advance, the more thy feet pitfalls will meet. The path that leadeth on, is lighted by one fire — the light of daring, burning in the heart. The more one dares, the more he shall obtain. The more he fears, the more that light shall pale — and that alone can guide. For as the linge ring sunbeam, that on the top of some tall mountain shines, is followed by black night when out it fades, so is heart - light. When out it goes, a dark and threatening shade will fall from thine own heart upon the path, and root thy feet in terror to the spo t. It is true that the further one advances the more subtle and deadly are the enemies, up to the crossing of the Abyss; and, as far as one can judge, the present discourse does not rise above Tiphareth. I am very sorry to have to remark at this point tha t Madame Blavatsky is now wholly obsessed by her own style. She indulges, much more than in the earlier part of this treatise, in poetic and romantic imagery, and in Miltonic inversion. (I do not here refer to Lycidas .) Consequently we get quite a long passage on a somewhat obvious point, and the Evil Persona or Dweller of the Threshold is intro duced. However, it is a correct enough place. That Dweller is Fear — his form is Dispersion. It is in this sense that Satan, or rather Samael, a totally differe nt person, the accuser of the Brethren, is the Devil."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 93 36 . Beware, disciple, of that lethal shade. No light that shines from Spirit can dispel the darkness of the nether Soul unless all selfish thought has fled therefrom, and that the pilgrim saith: “I have renounced this passing frame; I have destroyed the cause; the shadows cast can, as effects, no longer be.” For now the last great fight, the final war between the Higher and the Lower Self, hath taken place. Behold, the very battlefield is now engulphed i n the great war, and is no more. The quotation is only proper in the mouth of a Buddha, from whom it is taken. At this point the Higher and Lower Selves are united. It is a mistake to represent their contest as a war — it is a wedding. 37 . But once that th ou hast passed the gate of ksh a nti, step the third is taken. Thy body is thy slave. Now, for the fourth prepare, the Portal of temptations which do ensnare the inner man. We are now on a higher plane altogether. The Higher and Lower Selves are made One. I t is that One whose further progress from Tiphareth to Binah is now to be described. 38 . Ere thou canst near that goal, before thine hand is lifted to upraise the fourth gate’s latch, thou must have mustered all the mental changes in thy Self and slain the army of the thought sensations that, subtle and insid ious, creep unasked within the Soul’s bright shrine. It is the mental changes and the invading thoughts which distress us. These are to be understood in a rather advanced sense, for of course thought must have been conquered earlier than this, that is to say, the self must have been separated from its thoughts, so that they no longer disturb that self. Now, however, the fortress walls must be thrown down, and the mind slain in the open field."},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 94 39 . If t hou would’st not be slain by them, then must thou harmless make thy own creations, the children of thy thoughts unseen, impalpable, that swarm round human kind, the progeny and heirs to man and his terrestrial spoils. Thou hast to study the voidness of the seeming fuli, the fulness of the seeming void. O fearless Aspirant, look deep within the well of thine own heart, and answer. Knowest thou of Self the powers, O thou perceiver of external shadows? If thou dost not — then art thou lost. The way to make thou ghts harmless is by the equilibrium of contradictions — this is the meaning of the phrase, “Thou hast to study the voidness of the seeming full, the fulness of the seeming void.” This subject has been dealt with at some length in “The Soldier and the Hunchb ack” in The Equinox , vol I, no 1 , and many other references are to be found in the works of Mr. Aleister Crowley. A real identification of the Self with the Not - Self is necessary. 40 . For, on Path fourth, the lightest breeze of passion or desire will stir the steady light upon the pure white walls of Soul. The smallest wave of longing or regret for M a y a ’s gifts illusive, along Antskarana — the path that lies between thy Spirit and thy self, the highway of sensations, the rude arousers of Ahank a ra (the faculty that maketh the illusion called the Ego) — a thought as fleeting as the lightning flash will make thee thy three prizes forfeit — the prizes thou hast won. The meaning is again very much confused by the would - be poetic diction, but it is quite clear that desi re of any kind must not interfere with this intensely intellectual meditation; and of course the whole object of it is to refrain from preferring any one thing to any other thing. When it says that"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 95 “A thought as fleeting as the lightning flash will make th ee thy three prizes forfeit — the prizes thou hast won,” this does not mean that if you happen to make a mistake in meditation you have to begin all over again as an absolute beginner, and yet, of course, in any meditation the occurrence of a single break de stroys, for the moment, the effect of what has gone immediately before. Whenever one is trying for cumulative effect, something of this sort is true. One gets a sort of Leyden Jar effect; but the sentence as it stands is misleading, as she explains furth er on in verse 70 — “Each failure is success, and each sincere attempt wins its reward in time.” 41 . For know, that the ETERNAL knows no change. Here again we have one subject “THE ETERNAL,” and one predi cate “the knower of no change”; the Hindu statement i dentical with the Buddhist, and the identity covered by crazy terminology. X = A says the Hindu, Y = A says the Buddhist. X = Y is furiously denied by both, although these two equations are our only source of information about either X or Y. M etaphysics has always been full of this airy building. We must postulate an Unseen behind the Seen; and when we have defined the Unseen as a round square, we quarrel with our fellow - professors who prefer to define it as a quadrilateral circle. The only way to avoi d this is to leave argument altogether alone, and pay attention only to concentration, until the time comes to tackle mental phenomena once for all, by some such method as that of Liber 474 . (See The Equinox , vol. I, no. 7. ) 42 . “The eight dire miseries f orsake for evermore.

But the quotation is not familiar. I feel sure He did not say “sure.” 43 . Stern and exacting is the virtue of Vair a ga. If thou its Path would’st master, thou must keep thy mind and thy perceptions far freer th an before from killing action. The English is getting ambiguous. The word “killing” is, I suppose, an adjective implying “fatal to the purpose of the Student.” But even so, the comment appears to me out of place. On this high Path action should already h ave been made harm less; in fact, the second Path had this as its principal object. It is very difficult to make out what the Authoress really wants you to do. 44 . Thou hast to saturate thyself with pure Alaya, become as one with Nature’s Soul - Thought. At one with it thou art invincible; in separation, thou becomest the play ground of Samvritti, origin of all the world’s delusions. This means, acquire sympathy with the universal Soul of Nature. This Soul of Nature here spoken of is of course imagined as s omething entirely contrary to anything we really know of Nature. In fact, it would be difficult to distinguish it from a pious fiction. The only reason that can be given for assuming the Soul of Nature to be pure, calm, kind, and all the other tea - party virtues, is Lucus a non lucendo . To put it in some kind of logical form, the Manifested is not the Unmanifested; therefore the Manifested is that which the Unmanifested is not. Nature, as we know it, is stupid, brutal, cruel, beautiful, extravagant, and a bove all the receptacle or vehicle of illimitable energy. However by meditation one comes to a quite different view of Nature. Many of the stupidities and brutalities are only apparent.

All is impermanent in man except the pure bright essence of Alaya. Man is its crystal ray; a beam of light immaculate within, a form of clay material upon the lower surface. That beam is thy life - guide and thy true Self, the Watcher and the silent Thinker, the victim of thy lower Self. Th y Soul cannot be hurt but through thy erring body; control and master both, and thou art safe when crossing to the nearing “Gate of Balance.” Here we have Alaya identified with Atma. The rest of the verse is mostly poetic nothing, and there is no guide to the meaning of the word “Soul.” It is a perfectly absurd theory to regard the body as capable of inflicting wounds upon the Soul, which is apparently the meaning here. The definition of Atma gives impassibility as almost its prime condition. From the phr ase “control and master both” we must suppose that the Soul here spoken of is some intermediate principle, presumably Nephesch. 46 . Be of good cheer, O daring pilgrim “to the other shore.” Heed not the whisperings of M a ra’s hosts; wave off the tempters, th ose ill - natured Sprites, the jealous Llamayin in endless space. This verse may be again dismissed as too easily indulgent in poetic diction. A properly controlled mind should not be subject to these illusions.

Thou nearest now the middle portal, the gate of Woe, with its ten thousand snares. No explanation is given as to why the fifth should be called the “middle Portal” of seven. 48 . Have mastery o’er thy thoughts, O striver for perfec - tion, if thou would’st cross its threshold. From here to verse 71 is the long description of this fifth gate, the key to which (it will be rem embered) was Virya — that is, energy and will, Manhood in its most secret sense. It seems rather useless to tell the Student to have mastery over his thoughts in this verse, because he has been doing nothing else in all the previous Gates. 49 . Have mastery o ’er thy Soul, O seeker after truths undying, if thou would’st reach the goal. The pupil is also told to have mastery over his Soul, and again there is no indication as to what is meant by “Soul.” Bhikkhu Ananda Metteyya once remarked that Theo - sophists wer e rather absurd to call themselves Buddhists, as the Buddhist had no Soul, and the Theosophist, not even content with having one, insisted on possessing seven different kinds. If it means Nephesch, of course this ought to have been mastered long ago. It pr obably means Neschamah. If we take this to be so, the whole passage will become intelligible. In the beginning of progress we have the automatic Ego, the animal creator or generator of Nephesch in Yesod, the lowest point of the Ruach, and the marriage betw een these is"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 99 the first regeneration. Nephesch is Syrinx, and Yesod is Pan. Nephesch is the elemental Soul which seeks redemption and immortality. In order to obtain it, it must acquire a Soul such as is possessed by men. Now the elemental is said to be af raid of the sword with its cross hilt, of the Cross, that is to say of the Phallus, and this is what is called Panic fear, which, originally an individual thing, is applied to a mob, because a mob has no Soul. A very great many elementals are to be found in human form today; they are nearly always women, or such men as are not men. Such beings are imitative, irresponsible, always being shocked, without any standard of truth, although often extremely logical; criminal without a sense of right and wrong, an d as shameless as they are prudish. Truth of any kind frightens them. They are usually Christian Scientists, Spiritualists, Theosophists, or what not. They reflect the personality of a man with extraordinary ease, and frequently deceive him into thinking that they know what they are saying. Lévi remarks that “the love of the Magus for such beings is insen sate and may destroy him.” He had had some. This doctrine is magnificently expounded in Wagner’s Parsifal . T he way to redeem such creatures is to wi thstand them, and their Path of Redemption is the Path of Service to the man who has withstood them. However, when at the right moment the crucified one, the extended one, the Secret Saviour, consents to redeem them, and can do so without losing his power , without in any way yielding to them, their next step is accomplished, and they are reborn as men. This brings us back to our subject, for the lower man, of whom we are still speaking, possesses, above Yesod, five forms of intellect and Daäth their Crown ."},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 100 We then come to another marriage on a higher plane, the redemption of Malkuth by Tiphareth; the attaining of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The next critical step is the sacrificing of this whole organism to the Mother, Nescha mah, a higher South which is as spiritually dark and lonely as Nephesch was materially. Neschamah is beyond the Abyss, has no concern with that bridal, but to absorb it; and by offering the blood of her Son to the All - Father, that was her husband, she awak es Him. He, in His turn, vitalizes the original Daughter, thus competing the cycle. Now on the human plane this All - Father is the true generative force, the real Ego, of which all types of conscious Ego in a man are but Eidola, and this true creative force is the virya of which we are now speaking. 50 . Thy Soul - gaze centre on the One Pure Light, the Light that is free from affection, and use thy golden Key. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . This Virya is the one pure hight spoken of in this verse.

Thou hast now crossed the moat that circles round the gate of human passions. By “human passions” must be understood every kind of attraction, not merely gross appetites — which have been long ago conquered, not by excluding, but by regulating them. On the plane of mind itself all is in order; everything has been balanced by its opposi te. 53 . Thou hast now conquered M a ra and his furious host. The seeker has now passed through the Abyss where dwells Choronzon whose name is Legion. All this must be studied most carefully in Liber 418. 54 . Thou hast removed pollution from thine heart and b led it from impure desire. But, O thou glorious combatant, thy task is not yet done. Build high, Lanoo, the wall that shall hedge in the Holy Isle, the dam that will protect thy mind from pride and satisfaction at thoughts of the great feat achieved. Her e again is one of those unfortunate passages which enables the superficial to imagine that the task of the Adept is to hunger strike, and wear the blue ribbon, and give up smoking. The first paragraph of this verse rather means that filling of the cup of Babalon with every drop of blood, which is explained in Liber 418. The higher Ego — “Holy Isle” — is not the thinking self; it is the “Dwarf - Self,” the self which is beyond thinking. The aspirant is now in fact beyond thought, and this talk of building high t he wall or dam is too much like poetry to be good sense. What it means is, “Beware lest the reawakened Ego, the Chiah, should become self - conscious, as it is hable to do owing to its wedding with Neschamah.”"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 102 Or, shall we say, with Nephesch? For the organi sm has now been brought to perfect harmony in all its parts. The Adept has a strong, healthy, vigorous body, and a mind no less perfect; he is a very different person from the feeble emasculate cabbage - chewing victim of anæmia, with its mind which has gai ned what it calls emancipation by forgetting how to think. Little as it ever knew! Not in such may one find the true Adept. Read Liber Legis, chap. II, verse 24 , and learn where to look for hermits. 55 . A sense of pride would mar the wor k. Aye, build it strong, lest the fierce rush of bathing waves, that mount and beat its shore from out the great world M a y a ’s Ocean, swallow up the pilgrim and the isle — yea, even when the victory’s achieved. We now perceive more clearly the meaning of this passage. Just as the man, in order to conquer the woman, used restraint, so also must this true Soul restrain itself, even at this high stage, although it gives itself completely up. Although it creates without thought and without desire, let it do that without losing anything. And because the surrender must be complete, it must beware of that expansion which is called pride; for it is destroying duality, and pride implies duality. 56 . Thine “Isle” is the deer, thy thoughts the hounds that weary and pursue his progress to the stream of Life. Woe to the deer that is overtaken by the barking fiends before he reach the Vale of Refuge — Dhy a na - M a rga, “path of pure knowledge” named. Once more the passage harks back to the Abyss where thoughts prevail. It is another poetic ima ge, and not a good one. Extraor dinary how liable this unassailable Alaya - soul is to catch cold!

More trouble, more poetic image, more apparent sentimentality. Its true interpretation is to be found in the old symbolism of this rearrange of Chiah and Neschamah. Chiah is the male, proof against seduction; Neschamah the female that overcomes by weakness. But in actual practice the meaning may be explained thus, — you yourself have conquered, you have become perfec tly indifferent, perfectly energetic, perfectly creative, but, having united yourself to the Universe, you become acutely conscious that your own fortunate condition is not shared by that which you now are. It is then that the adept turns his face downwar ds, changes his formula from solve to coagula. His progress on the upward path now corresponds exactly with his progress on the downward path; he can only save himself by saving others, for if it were not so he would be hardly better than he who shuts him self in his black tower of illusion, the Brother of the Left Hand, the Klingsor of “ Parsifal.” 58 . Make hard thy Soul against the snares of Self; deserve for it the name of “Diamond - Soul” Here is another muddle, for the words “Soul” and “Self” have previou sly been used in exactly the opposite meaning. If any meaning at all is to be attached to this verse and to verse 59 , it is that the progress downwards, the progress of the Redeemer of the Sun as he descends from the Zenith, or passes from the Summer Solst ice to his doom, must be a voluntary absorption of Death in order to turn it into life. Never again must the Adept be deceived by his impressions, though there is that part of him which suffers."},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 104 59 . For, as the diamond buried deep within the throbbing hear t of earth can never mirror back the earthly lights, so are thy mind and Soul; plunged in Dhy a na - M a rga, these must mirror nought of M a y a ’s realm illusive. It is now evident that a most unfortunate metaphor has been chosen. A diamond is not much use when it is buried deep within the throbbing heart of earth. The proper place for a diamond is the neck of a courtesan. 60 . When thou hast reached that state, the Portals that thou hast to conquer on the Path fling open wide their gates to !et thee pass, and Natur e’s strongest mights possess no power to stay thy course. Thou wilt be master of the sevenfold Path; but not till then, O candidate for trials passing speech. That we have correctly interpreted these obscure passages now becomes clear. No further personal effort is required. The gates open of themselves to the Master of the Temple. 61 . Till then, a task far harder still awaits thee: thou hast to fee! thyself ALL - THOUGHT, and yet exile all thoughts from out thy SOUL. The discourse again reverts to another p hase of this task of Vair a ga . It is just as in the “Earth - Bhavan a ,” where you have to look at a frame of Earth, and reach that impression of Earth in which is no Earthly quality, “that earth which is not earth,” as the Qabalah would say.

Again another phase of this ta sk. Complete detachment, perfect silence, absolute will; this must be that pure Chiah which is utterly removed from Ruach. 63 . Behold it written: “Ere the gold flame can burn with steady light, the lamp must stand well guarded in a spot free from wind.” Exposed to shifting breeze, the jet will flicker and the quivering flame cast shades deceptive, dark and everchanging, on the Soul’s white shrine. This familiar phrase is usually interpreted to mean the mere keeping of the mind free from invading thoughts. It has also that secret significance at which we have several times already hinted. These unfortunate poetic images again bewilder us. Blavatsky’s constant use of the word “Soul” without definition is very annoying. These verses 63 and 64 must be taken a s dealing with a state preliminary to the attainment of this Fifth Gate. If the lance shakes in the hand of the warrior, whatever the cause, the result is fumbling and failure. 64 .

Beware, lest in forgetting SELF, thy Soul lose o’er its trembling mind control, and forfeit thus the due fruition of its conquests. These two verses seem to mean that any attention to Self would prevent one crossing the Abyss, while in the event of any inatten tion to Self the mind would revolt. In other words, “Soul” means Neschamah, and it is important for Neschamah to fix its atten tion on Chiah, rather than on Ruach. 67 . Beware of change! For change is thy great foe. This change will fight thee off, and throw thee back, out of the Path thou treadest, deep into viscous swamps of doubt. The only difficulty in this verse is the word “ change.” People who are meditating oft en get thrown off by the circumstances of their lives, and these circumstances must be controlled abso lutely. It should, however, also be taken to refer to any change in one’s methods of meditation. You should make up your mind thoroughly to a given scheme of action, and be bound by it. A man is perfectly hopeless if, on finding one mantra unsuccessful, he tries another. There is cumulative effect in all mystic an d magical work; and the mantra you have been doing, h owever bad, is the best one to go on with. 68 . Prepare, and be forewarned in time.

These verses explain the cumulative effect of which we spoke. It is very hard to persist, because very often we seem to make no progress. There is the water o n the fire, and nothing whatever appears to be happening. But without warning it suddenly boils. You may get the temperature to 99° and keep it at 99° for a thousand years, and the water will not boil. It is the last step that does the trick. One remark in this connection may be useful: “A watched pot never boils.” The student must practice complete detachment — must reach the stage when he does not care two pence whether he attains or not, while at the same time he pursues eagerly the Path of attainment. Th is is the ideal attitude. It is very well brought out in Parsifal.

Ultimately the sacred lance is brought back into the Hall where is the Grail, and there, at the right moment, not moved by desire, not seduced by cunning Kundry, but of hi s own nature, the sacri fice may be accomplished. So, as previously explained, it is important not to keep on worrying about one’s progress; otherwise all the concentration is lost, and a mood of irritability rises, work is given up, and the student become s angry with his Teacher. His Mind - Soul becomes as a mad elephant that rages in the jungle. He may even obtain the Vision of the Demon Crowley.

Please note the two lines of dots for the last paragraph of this verse. It is that final scene of Parsifal, which words are unfitted to express. 71 . Henceforth thy way is clear right through Virya gate, the fifth one of the Seven Portals. Thou art now on the way that leadeth to the Dhy a na haven, the sixth, the Bodhi Portal. 72 .

There is no longer any struggle, there is but the golden fire wit hin the alabaster vase, and thou art that vase. Mate and female are again interchanged. Above Chiah and Neschamah is Jechidah, and in the lower aspect of that, one has again become the receptacle of the Infinite, not that which penetrates the Infinite. T here are two formulæ of making two things one. The active formula is that of the arrow piercing the rainbow, the Cross erected upon the Hill of Golgotha, and so on. But the passive formula is that of the cup into which the wine is poured, that of the clo ud which wraps itself around Ixion. It is very annoying to hear that the Narjol is safe. This is Œdipus - Complex. Why not “Safe in the arms of Jesus”? Devil fly away with this “eternal rest” stuff!

It cannot be too clearly understood that these things are alto gether different. Blavatsky’s attempt to mix up Hinduism and Buddhism is productive of constant friction. The firs t Path in Dhy a na has nothing whatever to do with being a Srotãpatti. It is perfectly clear that you could be Master of the eight Jhanas with no more hope of becoming a Srotapatti than a Pwe - dancer. However, this is an extremely poetical description of wh at happens on the seventh Path. You must notice that there is a certain amount of confusion between the Paths and the Portals at the end of them. Apparently one does not reach the seventh Gate till the end of the treatise. “A Master of the Day” is said to refer to the Manvantara , but it is also an obvious phrase where day is equivalent to Sun. 75 .

This is the penultimate stage. He is really now practically identical with Mayan hims elf. He has met and conquered the maker of illusion, become one with him, and his difficulty will then be so to complete that work, that it shall be centred on itself, and leave no seed that may subsequently germinate and destroy all that has been accompl ished. 76 .

Now he shall surely reach his great reward! The temptation at this point i s to create an Universe. He is able: the necessity of so doing is strong within Him, and He may perhaps even imagine that He can make one which shall be free from the Three Characteristics. Evelyn Hall — an early love of mine — used to say: “God Almighty — or words to that effect — has no conscience”; and in the tremendous state of mind in which He is, a state of Cosmic priapism, He may very likely see red, care nothing for what may result to Himself or His victim, and, violently projecting Himself on the Ak a sa, may fertilize it, and the Universe begin once more. In Liber I it seems as if this must be done, as if it were pan of the Work, and Liber Legis, if I understand it aught, would inculcate the same. For to US the Three Charac - teristics and the Four Noble Tr uths are lies — the laws of Illusion. Ours is the Palace of the Grail, not Klingsor’s Castle. 77 . Shall he not use the gifts which it confers for his own rest and bliss, his well - earn’d weal and glory — he, the subduer of the great Delusion? It is now seen th at He should not do this, although He is able. He should on the contrary take up the burden of a Magus. This whole passage will be found in much clearer language in Liber I, The Equinox , Vol. I, no. 7 . 78 . Nay, O thou candidate for Nature’s hidden lore! I f one would follow in the steps of holy Tath a gata, those gifts and powers are not for Self.

He is the creative force, while th e Master is merely the receptive. But in these verses 78 , 79 , 80 , it might be very easily supposed that it was merely a recapitulation of the former remarks, and I am inclined to think that there is a certain amount of confusion in the mind of the Author between these two grades. She attained only the lower. But careful study of these verses will incline the reader to perceive that it is a new creation which is here spoken of, not a mere amelioration. The only really difficult verse on this interpretation is 86 . There is a lot of sham sentiment in this verse. It gives an entirely false picture of the Adept, who does not whine, who does not play Pecksniff. ALL this business about protecting man from far greater misery and sorrow is absurd. For example, in o ne passage H. P. B. explains that the lowest hell is a man - bearing Planet. There is a certain amount of melancholia with delusions of persecution about this verse. Natural, perhaps, to one who was betrayed and robbed by Vittoria Cremers? 79 . Would’st thou thus dam the waters born on Sumeru? Shalt thou divert the stream for thine own sake, or send it back to its prime source along the crests of cycles? It is here seen that the ideal proposed by the Author is by no means rest or immobility.

In The Book of Lies, too, the same idea is stated again and again, with repetition only unwearying bec ause of the beauty and variety of the form. “Everything is sorrow,” says the Buddha. Quite so, to begin with. We analyze the things we deem least sorrow, and find that by taking a long enough period, or a short enough period, we can prove them to be the most exquisite agony. Such is the attempt of all Buddhist writers, and their even feebler Western imitators. But once the secret of the universe is found, then everything is joy. The proposition is quite as universal. 80 . If thou would’st have that stre am of hard - earn’d knowledge, of Wisdom heaven - .born, remain sweet running waters, thou should’st not leave it to become a stagnant pond. Here we have the same thesis developed with unexpected force. So far from the Path being repose, the slightest slackeni ng turns it stagnant. 81 .

It will become abundantly evident in the comment to verse 97 that Blavatsky had not the remotest idea as to what a Bodhisattva was and is.

There is a good deal of anticlimax in verse 83 , and a peculiarly unnecessary split infinitive. Blavatsky’s difficulty s eems to have been that although she is always talking of the advance of the good Narjol, he never seems to advance in point of view. Now, on the threshold of the last Path, he is still an ordinary person with vague visionary yearn ings! It is true that He wishes the unity of all that lives, complete harmony in the parts, and perfect light in the whole. It is also true that He may spend a great deal of time in killing or other wise instructing men, but He has not got at all the old concep tion. The ordinar y Buddhist is quite unable to see anything but details. Bhikkhu Ànanda Metteyya once refused to undertake the superintendence of a coconut plantation, because he found that he would have to give orders for the destruction of vermin. But (with the best fe eling in the world) he had to eat rice, and the people who cultivated the rice had to destroy a lot of vermin too. One cannot escape responsibility in this vicarious way. It is pecu liarly silly, because the whole point of Buddha’s position is that there is no escape. The Buddhist regulations are comparable to orders which might have been, but were not, because he was not mad, given by the Captain of the Titanic to caulk the planks after the ship had been cut in two. 83 .

Alas! when once thou hast become like the fixed star in highest heaven, that bright celestial orb must shine from out the spatial depths for all — save for itself; give light to all, but take from none. It is incomparably annoying to see this word “Alas!” at the head of this verse as a pure oxymoron with the rest of the text. Is stupid, unseeing selfishness so firmly f ixed in the nature of man that even at this height he still laments? Do not believe it. It is interesting here to note the view taken by Him who has actually attained the Grade of Magus. He says: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. It may b e those three perfections of my sambhogkaya robe, but the fact is that one has reached a stage when the Path becomes almost meaningless. The illusion of Sorrow has been exposed so ruthlessly that one can hardly realize that one, or anyone else, can ever h ave been in such a silly muddle. It seems so perfectly natural that everything should be just as it is, and so right, that one is quite startled if one contemplates the nature of one’s Star, which led one into these “grave paths.” The only “wrong” is the thinking about anything at all; this is of course the old “Thought is evil” on a higher plane. One gets to understand the Upanishad which tells us how The Original It made the error of contemplating itself, of becoming self - conscious; and one also percei ves the stupendous transcendentalism concealed in the phrase of The Book of the Law: “Enough of Because! Be he damned for a dog!” This Universe — the IO PAN PAN and the OIMOI TALAINOI too — is a Play of Our Merry Lady. It is as natural to have all this heavy stuff about the Weary Pilgrim’s Bleeding Feet, and the Candidate for Woe, and all that, as it is for Theseus and Hippolyta to decide that Pyramus and Thisbe may amuse them. The Public will then kindly excuse the Magus if He be of a nature, and in a mood, to decline to take the tragedy too seriously, and to mock the crude buffooneries of Bottom. Perhaps it would be better taste in Him to draw the"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 116 curtains of His box. But it is at least His pleasure to reward the actors. Love is the law, love under will. 85 . Alas! when once thou hast become tike the pure snow in mountain vales, cold and unfeeling to the touch, warm and protective to the seed that sheepeth deep beneath its bosom — ’tis now that snow which must receive the biting frost, the northern blasts, th us shielding from their sharp and cruel tooth the earth that holds the promised harvest, the harvest that will feed the hungry. Surely a better image would have been the Mother, and does the Mother complain or rejoice? It is also a bad image, this of the snow. Is snow in any way incommoded by the biting frosts, the northern blasts? 86 . Self - doomed to live through future Kalpas, unthanked and unperceived by man; wedged as a stone with count less other stones which form the “Guardian Walt,” such is thy futu re if the seventh Gate thou passest. Built by the hands of many Masters of Compassion, raised by their tortures, by their blood cemented, it shields mankind, since man is man, protecting it from further and far greater misery and sorrow. Comment has alread y been made upon this verse. 87 . Withal man sees it not, will not perceive it, nor will he heed the word of Wisdom . . . for he knows it not. Here indeed is the only sorrow that could seem, even for a moment, likely to touch the Adept. It is rather annoyi ng that the great prize offered so freely to men is scorned by them. But this is only if the Adept fall for one moment to the narrower view, accept the conventional outlook on the universe. If only he remember that very simple and elementary instruction that the Magician must work as if he had Omnipotence at his command and Eternity at his disposal, He will not repine."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 117 88 . But thou hast heard it, thou knowest all, O thou of eager guileless Soul . . . and thou must choose. Then hearken yet again. This ver se introduces the climax of this treatise. 89 . On S owan’s Path, O Srot a patti, thou art secure. Aye, on that M a rga, where nought but darkness meets the weary pilgrim, where torn by thorns the hands drip blood, the feet are cut by sharp unyielding flints, an d M a ra wields his strongest arms — there lies a great reward immediately beyond. It is not at all clear to what stage of the Path this refers. In verse 91 it appears to refer to the Dhyana Path, but the Dhyana Path has been described in entirely different te rms in verses 71 to 73 , and it is certainly a quite bad description of the condition of Srot a patti. I think the tragic note is struck for effect. Damn all these tortures and rewards! Has the Narjol no manhood at all? 90 . Calm and unmoved the Pilgrim glide th up the stream that to Nirv a na leads. He knoweth that the more his feet will bleed, the whiter will himself be washed. He knoweth well that after seven short and fleeting births Nirv a na will be his. Here is again a totally un - Buddhistic description. It a ppears to me rather a paraphrase of the well - known Sweeping through the gates of the New Jerusalem, Washed in the Blood of the Lamb. 91 . Such is the D hy a na Path, the haven of the Y ogi , the blessed goal that Srot a pattis crave. Again the confusion of the a ttainment of the Student with regard to spiritual experience, and his attainment with regard to his grade.

Not so when he hath crossed and won the Aryhata Path. From here to verse 95 is description of this last Path which heads to the last Gate. 93 . There Klesha is destroyed for ever, Tanh a ’s roots torn out. But stay, Disciple . . . Yet, one word. Canst thou destroy divine COMPASSION? Compassion is no attribute. It is the Law of LAWS — eternal Harmony, Alaya’s SELF; a shoreless universal essence, the light of everlasting Right, and fitness of all things, the law of love eternal. Here again is apparently a serious difficulty. The idea of Klesha , here identified with Love of worldly enjoyment, seems to put one back almost before the beginning. Is it now only that the almost - Arhat no longer wants to go to the theatre? It must not be inter prete d in this low sense. At the same time, it is difficult to discover a sense high enough to fit the passage. With Tanh a it is easier to find a meaning, for Madame seems to identify Tanh a with the creative force of which we have spoken. But this is of cour se incompatible with the Buddhist teaching on the subject. Tanh a is properly defined as the hunger of the individual for continuous personal existence, either in a material or a spiritual sense. With regard to the rest of the verse, it certainly reads as if yet again Blavatsky had taken the sword to a Gordian knot. By saying that Compassion is no attribute she is merely asserting what is evidently not true, and she therefore defines it in a peculiar way, and I am afraid that she does so in a somewhat misl eading manner. It would be improper here to disclose what is presumably the true meaning of this verse. One can only commend it to the earnest consideration of members of the Sanctuary of the Gnosis, the IX° of the O.T.O."},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 119 94 . The more thou dost become at one with it, thy being melted in its BEING, the more thy Soul unites with that which Is, the more thou wilt become COMPASSION ABSOLUTE. This verse throws a little further light upon its predecessor. COMPASSION is really a certain Chinese figure whose nam es are numerous. One of them is BAPHOMET. 95 . Such is the Arya Path, Path of the Buddhas of perfection. This closes the subject. 96 . Withal, what mean the sacred scrolls which make thee say? “Om! I believe it is not all the arhats that get of the Nirv a nic Path the sweet fruition. “Om! 1 believe that the Nirv a na - Dharma is entered not by all the Buddhas.” Here, however, we come to the question of the final renuncia tion. It is undoubtedly true that one may push spiritual experi ence to the point of complete attainment without ever undertaking the work of a Dhamma - Buddha, though it seems hard to believe that at no period during that progress will it have become clear that the Complete Path is downwards as well as upwards. 97 . Yea; on the Arya Path thou art no more Srot a patti, thou art a Bodhisattva. The stream is cross’d. ’Tis true thou hast a right to Dharmak a ya vesture; but Samb hogak a ya is greater than a Nirv a ni, and greater still is a Nirmanak a ya — the Buddha of Compassion. Here once more we perceive the ig norance of the Author with reference to all matters of mystic terminology, an"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 120 ignorance which would have been amusing indeed had she lived ten years later. A Bodhisattva is simply a being which has culminated in a Buddha. If you or I became Buddhas tomorr ow, then all our previous incarnations were Bodhi - sattvas , and therefore, as there shall not be a single grain of dust which shall not attain to Buddhahood, every existing thing is in a way a Bodhisattva. But of course in practice the term is confined to these special incarna tions of the only Buddha of whom we have any such record. It is, therefore, ridiculous to place Srot a patti as a Soul of inferior grade to Bodhisattva. Buddha did not become a Srot a patti until seven incarnations before he attained to Buddhahood. The last part of the verse and the long note (of which we quote the gist) are nonsense. To describe a complete Buddha as “an ideal breath; Consciousness merged in the Universal Consciousness, or Soul devoid of every attribute,” is not Buddhis m at all, and is quite incompatible with Buddhism. 98 . Now bend thy head and listen well, O Bodhisattva — Compassion speaks and saith: “Can there be bliss when ah that hives must suffer? Shalt thou be saved and hear the whole world cry?” Now thou hast heard that which was said. Again we descend to the anticlimax of a somewhat mawkish sentimentality. Again we find the mistake of duality, of that opposition between self and others which, momentarily destroyed even in the most elementary periods of Samadhi, is completely wiped out by progress through the grades. The Path would indeed be a Treadmill if one always remained in this Salvation Army mood. "},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 121 99 . Thou shall attain the seventh step and cross the gate of final knowledge but only to wed woe — if thou would’s t be Tath a gata, follow upon thy predecessor’s steps, remain unselfish till the endless end. Thou art enlightened — Choose thy way. The anticlimax is now complete. Knowledge is by no means the last step. Knowledge has been finished with even by the Master of the Temple, and all this question of wedding woe, remaining unselfish till the endless end, is but poetic bombast, based upon misconception. It is as puerile as the crude conceptions of many Christian Sects. 100 . Behold, the mellow Light that floods the Eas tern sky. In signs of praise both heaven and earth unite.
