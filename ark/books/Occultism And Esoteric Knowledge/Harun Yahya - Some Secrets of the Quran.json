Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation, and therefore the existence of God, during the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. Therefore, showing that this theory is a deception is a very important duty, which is strongly related to the religion ( deen ). It is imperative that this important service be rendered to everyone. Some of our readers may find the chance to read only one of our books. Therefore, we think it appropriate to spare a chapter for a summary of this subject. In all the books by the author, faith-related issues are explained in the light of the Qur'anic verses and people are invited to learn God's words and to live by them. All the subjects that concern God's verses are explained in such a way as to leave no room for doubt or question marks in the reader's mind. The sincere, plain and fluent style employed ensures that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand the books. This effective and lucid narrative makes it possible to read them in a single sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts recounted in these books and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. This book and all the other works of the author can be read individually or discussed in a group at a time of conversation. Those readers who are willing to profit from the books will find discussion very useful in the sense that they will be able to relate their own reflections and experiences to one another. In addition, it will be a great service to the religion to contribute to the presentation and reading of these books, which are written solely for the good pleasure of God. All the books of the author are extremely convincing. For this reason, for those who want to communicate the religion to other people, one of the most effective methods is to encourage them to read these books. It is hoped that the reader will take time to look through the review of other books on the final pages of the book, and appreciate the rich source of material on faith-related issues, which are very useful and a pleasure to read. In these books, you will not find, as in some other books, the personal views of the author, explanations based on dubious sources, styles that are unobservant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, nor hopeless, doubt- creating, and pessimistic accounts that create deviations in the heart.

Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he then studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, the author has published many books on political, faith-related and scientific issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as an author who has written very important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, the invalidity of their claims and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and bloody ideologies. His pen-name is made up of the names \"Harun\" (Aaron) and \"Yahya\" (John), in memory of the two esteemed prophets who fought against lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the cover of the author's books has a symbolic meaning linked to the their contents. This seal represents the Qur'an as the last Book by God and the last word of Him and our Prophet, the last of all the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and Sunnah, the author makes it his main goal to disprove each one of the fundamental tenets of godless ideologies and to have the \"last word\", so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. The seal of the Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, is used as a sign of his intention of saying this last word. All these works by the author centre around one goal: to convey the message of the Qur'an to people, thus encouraging them to think about basic faith-related issues, such as the existence of God, His unity and the hereafter, and to display the decrepit foundations and perverted works of godless systems. Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian, and they have been enjoyed by readers all over the world. Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people putting their faith in God and in many others gaining a deeper insight into their faith. The wisdom, and the sincere and easy-to-understand style employed give these books a distinct touch which directly strikes any one who reads or examines them. Immune to objections, these works are characterised by their features of rapid effectiveness, definite results and irrefutability. It is unlikely that those who read these books and give a serious thought to them can any longer sincerely advocate the materialistic philosophy, atheism and any other perverted ideology or philosophy. Even if they continue to advocate, this will be only a sentimental insistence since these books have refuted these ideologies from their very basis. All contemporary movements of denial are ideologically defeated today, thanks to the collection of books written by Harun Yahya. There is no doubt that these features result from the wisdom and lucidity of the Qur'an. The author certainly does not feel proud of himself; he merely intends to serve as a means in one's search for God's right path. Furthermore, no material gain is sought in the publication of these works. Considering these facts, those who encourage people to read these books, which open the \"eyes\" of the heart and guide them in becoming more devoted servants of God, render an invaluable service. Meanwhile, it would just be a waste of time and energy to propagate books which create confusion in peoples' minds, lead man into ideological chaos, and which, clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in peoples' hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is apparent that it is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the moral values of the Qur'an. The success, impact and sincerity this service has attained are manifest in the reader's conviction.

These things can only come to an end with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by ensuring that everybody knows about the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality, so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, which forces people into the downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, it is clear that this service has to be provided more speedily and effectively. Otherwise, it may be too late. It is no exaggeration to say that the collection of books by Harun Yahya have assumed this leading role.

They spend their lives clinging to delusions and live with contradictions and deficiencies, refusing to adopt the Qur'an as their guide. Yet, only the Qur'an provides a lifetime of true knowledge for every person and contains the secrets of God's creation in its truest and purest form. Any piece of information not based on the Qur'an is in contradiction, and therefore is a deception and an illusion. Therefore, those who do not adhere to the Qur'an live in a state of delusion. In the hereafter they will be condemned to eternal punishment. In the Qur'an, along with prayers, commands, prohibitions and high moral standards, God communicates many secrets to mankind. These are truly important secrets, and an attentive eye can witness these throughout his life. No other source than the Qur'an holds these secrets. The Qur'an is the unique source of secrets that those people, no matter how intelligent, literate or astute they are, could never hope to find anywhere else.

Those who do not seek these secrets revealed in the Qur'an, live in distress and difficulty. Ironically, they never know the cause of their distress. Those who learn about these secrets of the Qur'an, on the other hand, lead an easy, joyful life. That is because the Qur'an is clear, easy and straightforward enough to be understood by anyone. In the Qur'an, God states the following: O Mankind! A clear proof has come to you from your Lord. We have sent down a Clear Light to you. As for those who believe in God and hold fast to Him, He will admit them into mercy and favour from Him and will guide them to Him on a straight path. (Surat an-Nisa': 174-175) However, a vast majority of people, despite being capable of solving the most complicated problems, understanding and putting the most puzzling and ambiguous philosophies into practice, fail to grasp the clarity and simplicity found in the Qur'an. As this book explains, this itself is an important mystery. Not being able to grasp the fleeting nature of life in this temporal world, these people draw closer to inevitable death every day. The secrets in the Qur'an are a grace for believers while they bring down torment on disbelievers both in this world and in the hereafter. God relates this fact in a verse as follows: We sent down in the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy to the believers, but it only increases the wrongdoers in loss. (Surat al-Isra': 82) SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 11 This book deals with the subjects related to some verses God has revealed to mankind as a secret. When a person reads these verses, and his attention is drawn to the secrets in these verses, what he must do is to seek the divine purposes hidden in events and evaluate everything in the light of the Qur'an. Then, people will realise with excitement that the secrets of the Qur'an control both their own lives and those of others alike. From the moment one wakes up in the morning, the manifestations of these secrets created by God can be seen. To accomplish this, he only needs to remain heedful, turn to God and think. Then, he will realise that his life is by no means dependent on the laws many people prejudicially adopt and that the only valid authority and laws are the laws of God. This is a very important secret. There is no good in many of the rules and practices the majority of people have accepted for centuries as the most definitive truths. As a matter of fact, these people are greatly deluded. The truth is what is revealed in the Qur'an. Anybody who reads the Qur'an sincerely, evaluates events in the light of the Qur'an and faith, and lives as a friend of God, will clearly see these secrets. This will lead to a better grasp that God is the only One Who holds control over every being, every heart and every thought. As God states in a verse: We will show them Our Signs on the horizon and within themselves until it is clear to them that it is the truth. Is it not enough for your Lord that He is a witness of everything? What! Are they in doubt about the meeting with their Lord? What! Does He not encompass all things?

One of the relevant verses is as follows: If My servants ask you about Me, I am near. I answer the call of the caller when he calls on Me. They should therefore respond to Me and believe in Me so that they will be guided aright. (Surat al-Baqara: 186) As stated in the verse above, God is close to everybody. He has knowledge of everyone's wishes, feelings, thoughts, every word uttered, anything whispered and even what is concealed deep in one's thoughts. Consequently, God hears and knows everyone who turns to Him and prays to Him. This is God's blessing on mankind, and a manifestation of His mercy, grace and infinite power. God has infinite might and knowledge. He is the Possessor of everything in the entire universe. Every being, SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"GOD ANSWERS EVERYONE'S PRAYERS 13 every object, from the seemingly most powerful people to the greatest riches, from the magnificent celestial bodies to a tiny animal dwelling on the Earth, all belongs to God and are all under His complete will and control. A person who has faith in this truth can pray to God for anything and can hope that God will answer those prayers. For example, a person who is seized by an incurable disease will surely resort to all forms of medical care. Yet, knowing that only God restores health, prayers will be offered to Him for recovery. Alternatively, a person with some kind of fear or anxiety can pray to God for relief and to remove all forms of fear. A person who encounters difficulties in accomplishing a task can turn to God for the removal of difficulties. One can pray to God for countless things; for guidance to the true path, for acceptance into paradise with other true believers, for a better grasp of paradise, hell and the Might of God, for good health and so on. This is what God's Messenger, peace be upon him, stressed when he said: Shall I introduce to you a weapon which will protect you both from the evils of enemies and increase your sustenance? They said: Yes, O Messenger of God. He said: Call your Lord day and night, for 'Prayer' is the weapon of a believer. 1 However, there is another secret disclosed in the Qur'an, which deserves mention at this point. As God states in the verse, \"Man prays for evil just as he prays for good. Man is prone to be impetuous.\" (Surat al-Isra': 11). Not every prayer by man may be beneficial. For example, a person may ask God for more property and wealth for his children's future. However, God may not see any goodness in this request. It may well be that prosperity will turn the children away from SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"SOME SECRETS OF THE QUR'AN 14 God. In this sense, God hears this person's call, accepts it as a form of worship and answers it in the best way. Alternatively, a person may pray not to be late for an appointment. However, it may well be that it is better for him to reach the destination after the specified time and instead, meet someone who would contribute something beneficial for his eternal life. God knows this and He answers the prayer, not in the form the person thought, but in the best way. That is, God hears that person, but if He sees no good for him in his prayer, He creates what is best for him. This itself is a very important secret. When prayers appear to go unanswered, those unaware of this secret assume that God did not hear their call. This is indeed a perverted belief of ignorance because \"God is closer to man than his own jugular vein\" . (Surat Qaf: 16) He knows every word one speaks, every thought and every instant pertaining to one's life. Even while one is asleep, God knows what he experiences in his dreams. It is God Who creates everything. Consequently, each time one prays to God, he should be aware that God will accept his prayer as a worship and believe that God will answer his call in the most appropriate time and create what is best for him. Prayer, as well as being a form of worship, is also a precious gift from God to mankind. This is because, through prayer, God enables man to attain anything He deems good and beneficial for him. God relates the importance of prayers in the verse stating: \"Say: 'What has My Lord to do with you if you do not call on Him? But you have denied the truth, so punishment is bound to come.' \" (Surat al-Furqan: 77) SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"GOD ANSWERS EVERYONE'S PRAYERS 15 God answers the prayers of those who are in distress and need Prayers are the times when one's closeness to God is explicitly felt; it is a time when one grasps God's closeness and how, as a servant of God, he is in need of Him. This is because when one prays, he grasps how weak and humble he is before God, and perceives that no one except God can ever help him. The sincerity and candidness in one's prayer depends on how desperately he is in need. For example, everybody prays to God for peace in the world. Yet, someone -who is desperate in the middle of a war would pray more earnestly and humbly to God. Similarly, people, during a storm in a ship or in an airplane in danger of crashing, would beg humbly to God. They will be sincere and submissive in their prayer. God relates this fact in a verse as follows: Say: 'Who rescues you from the darkness of the land and sea? You call on Him humbly and secretly: \"If you rescue us from this, we will truly be among the thankful.\" (Surat al-An'am: 63) In the Qur'an, God commands man to pray with humility: Call on your Lord humbly and secretly. He does not love those who overstep the limits. (Surat al-A'raf: 55) In another verse, God states that He answers the calls of the oppressed and those who are in need: He Who responds to the oppressed when they call on Him and removes their distress, and makes you inheritors of the earth. Is there another deity besides God? How little you pay heed!

These examples are given so as to make people have a grasp of the mood with which to pray sincerely and ponder over the moment of death, when one can no longer be heedless and definitely turn to God with an inner sincerity. Believers who are wholeheartedly devoted to God, on the other hand, being aware of their weaknesses and feeling the need, always turn sincerely to God even if they are not in a situation of death or life. This is an important characteristic which distinguishes them from disbelievers and those of poor faith. Not setting any limits on praying A person can ask God for anything within the limits of the permissible (halal). This is because, as mentioned earlier, God is the only ruler and owner of the entire universe; and if He wills, He grants man anything He desires. Every person who turns to God and prays to Him should credit God's power to do anything and \"be firm in supplication\" as our beloved Prophet, peace be upon him, said. 2 He needs to know that it is easy for Him to fulfil any wish, and He will grant a person's request if there is anything good for that person in his prayer. Prayers of prophets and true believers mentioned in the Qur'an set an example to believers about the subjects they can ask from God. For example, the Prophet Zachariah (Zakariyya), peace be upon him, prayed to God for a pleasing heir and, God answered his prayer, despite his wife's barrenness: When he called on his Lord in secret and said, 'My Lord, my bones have lost their strength and my head SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"GOD ANSWERS EVERYONE'S PRAYERS 17 is crowned with white, but in calling on You, My Lord, I have never been disappointed. I fear my relatives when I am gone and my wife is barren, so give me an heir from You to be my inheritor and the inheritor of the family of Jacob (Ya'qub), and make him, my Lord, pleasing to You.' (Surah Maryam: 3-6) God answered the Prophet Zachariah's prayer and gave him the good news of the Prophet John (Yahya), peace be upon him. Having received the tidings of a son, the Prophet Zachariah was surprised since his wife was barren. The answer of God to the Prophet Zachariah reveals a secret which believers should always keep in mind: He said, 'My Lord! How can I have a boy when my wife is barren and I have reached advanced old age?' He said, 'It will be so! Your Lord says, \"That is easy for me to do. I created you before, when you were not anything.\"' (Surah Maryam: 8-9) There are many other prophets mentioned in the Qur'an whose prayers were answered. For example, the Prophet Noah (Nuh), peace be upon him, asked God to inflict a torment on his people, who went astray despite his best efforts to guide them to the right path. As an answer to his prayer, God inflicted a great torment on them which went down in history. The Prophet Job (Aiyub), peace be upon him, called out to His Lord because of his sickness, saying \"... Great harm has afflicted me and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful\" (Surat al-Anbiya': 83). The response to the Prophet Job's prayer is related as follows: We responded to him and removed from him the SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"SOME SECRETS OF THE QUR'AN 18 harm, which was afflicting him and restored his family to him, and the same again with them, as a mercy direct from Us and a Reminder to all worshippers. (Surat al-Anbiya': 84) God answered the Prophet Solomon (Sulayman), peace be upon him, who prayed, \"My Lord, forgive me and give me a kingdom the like of which will never be granted to anyone after me. Truly You are the Ever-Giving.\" (Surah Sâd: 35). And God bestowed a great power and wealth on him. Accordingly, those who pray should keep in mind the verse \"His command when He desires a thing is just to say to it, 'Be!' (Surah Ya-Sin:82). As stated in the verse, everything is easy for God and He hears and knows every prayer. God gives blessings of this world to those who desire them, but in the hereafter they will suffer heavy loss The desires of those who do not harbour a deep-rooted fear in their heart for God and lack a profound faith in the hereafter are worldly-oriented. They ask for wealth, property and status only for the life of this world. God informs us that those who desire only the world will have no reward in the hereafter. Believers, on the other hand, pray both for this world and the hereafter since they believe that the life in the hereafter is as certain and near as this life. Of this, God states the following: ... There are some people who say, 'Our Lord, give us good in the world.' They will have no share in the hereafter. And there are others who say, 'Our Lord, SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"GOD ANSWERS EVERYONE'S PRAYERS 19 give us good in the world, and good in the hereafter, and safeguard us from the punishment of the Fire.' They will have a good share from what they have earned. God is swift at reckoning. (Surat al-Baqara: 200-202) Believers, too, pray for good health, wealth, knowledge and bliss. Yet, all their prayers carry the intention to please God and have something to do for the good of the religion ( deen ). They ask for wealth, for instance, to use it in God's way. With regard to this, God gives the example of The Prophet Solomon in the Qur'an. Far from being a worldly ambition, the Prophet Solomon's call for unprecedented possessions was for the noble purpose of using them in the way of God, calling people to God's religion and to keep himself occupied with the remembrance of God. The words of the Prophet Solomon related in the Qur'an indicate this sincere intention: \"... Truly do I love the love of good, with a view to the glory of my Lord.\" (Surah Sâd: 32) God answered this very prayer of Solomon, granted him a great property in the world and rewarded him with the blessings of the hereafter. On the other hand, God also grants the wishes of those who desire only the life of this world, yet a painful punishment awaits them in the hereafter. No blessing they possess here in this world will be accessible to them in the hereafter. This important fact is related in the Qur'an as follows: If anyone desires to cultivate the hereafter, We will increase him in his cultivation.

From the air one breathes to the food he eats, from the ability to use one's hands to the faculty of speech, from being sheltered to being in a joyful spirit, one lives completely in need of what God creates and grants him. Still, a vast majority of people do not perceive their weaknesses and that they are in need of God. They suppose that things develop spontaneously or that they acquire everything by their own efforts. This is an important error, as well as a serious ingratitude towards God. Ironically, people who render their thanks to a person for even an insignificant gift, spend all their lives ignoring the countless blessings that God gives them all through their lives. However, so great are the blessings granted to a person that one could never count them.

The reason for this is related in the Qur'an: Satan, who pledged to misguide people from God's way, said that his ultimate aim is to make people be ungrateful to God. Satan's defiant statements to God emphasise the importance of giving thanks to God: 'Then I will come at them, from in front of them behind them, from their right and from their left. You will not find most of them thankful.' He (God) said, 'Get out of it, reviled and driven out. As for those of them (mankind) who follow you, I, will fill up Hell with every one of you.' (Surat al-A'raf: 17-18) Believers, on the other hand, aware of their weaknesses and in humility before God, render their thanks to Him for every blessing granted. Wealth and possessions are not the only blessings for which believers render their thanks to God. Knowing that God is the Owner and Possessor of everything, believers express their inner gratefulness for good health, beauty, knowledge, wisdom, love of faith and hatred from disbelief, understanding, insight, foresight and for power. They are thankful for being rightly guided and for being in the company of believers. A beautiful landscape, easy handling of their affairs, fulfilment of their wishes, tidings of great joy, respectful conduct or any other blessings make believers immediately turn to God, express their gratefulness to Him and reflect on His mercy and compassion.

For example, God grants even more health and power to those who render their thanks to God for the good health and strength they have. God bestows even more knowledge and property to those who are grateful for their knowledge or wealth. This is because they are sincere people who are contented with what God gives and are pleased with the blessings and who take God as their friend. God relates this secret in the Qur'an as follows: And when your Lord announced: \"If you are grateful, I will certainly give you increase, but if you are ungrateful, My punishment is severe.\"' (Surah Ibrahim: 7) Being grateful is also a sign of one's closeness to and love of God. People who give thanks have the insight and capability to perceive the beauties and blessings that God creates. God's Messenger, peace be upon him, also referred to this when he said: When God gives you property, the bliss of God's blessing and offering must be reflected on you. 3 On the other hand, a disbelieving or ungrateful person will only see the imperfections and faults even in the most beautiful environment, and thus will be unhappy and discontented. Indeed, as a divine purpose in God's creation, such people, always come across with seemingly unfavourable events and unpleasant scenes. On the other hand, God displays more of His bounties and blessings to those who have a sincere and insightful outlook.

However, one needs to keep in mind that sincerity is a prerequisite for being grateful. No doubt, one's way of showing his gratitude without turning sincerely to God and feeling the inner peace of God's infinite mercy and compassion, which is solely intended to impress people, would be sheer insincerity. God knows what hearts harbour, and will bear witness to this insincerity. Those who have insincere inner intentions may conceal it from other people, but not from God. Such people may render their thanks with affected manners when there is no affliction, but at times of hardship, it is possible that they may readily lapse into ungratefulness. It should be also noted that true believers remain grateful to God even under harshest conditions. Someone looking from outside may see the diminishing of some blessings believers enjoy. However, believers, who are able to perceive the good aspect of every event and situation, see goodness in this too. For example, God states that He will test people with fear, hunger and loss of wealth or life. In such a situation, believers rejoice and feel grateful, hoping that God will reward them with the gifts of paradise in return for the steadfastness they displayed in this test. They know that God does not impose on anyone more than he can bear. The steadfastness and submission of such awareness lead them to patience and gratitude. Therefore, it is an obvious attribute of believers to show unwavering dedication and submission and God promises to expand His blessings on His grateful servants both in the life of this world and in the hereafter.

There are important secrets and blessings to placing one's trust in God. Putting one's trust in God implies a definite submissiveness to and reliance on God and the fate He creates. God has created all beings, animals, plants, as well as non-living objects – each with its own purpose or fate. The sun, moon, seas, lakes, trees, flowers, a tiny ant, a single leaf falling, a single particle of dust on your desk, a rock that you trip over, the shirt that you bought ten years ago, the peach in your refrigerator, your mother, your primary school friends, yourself - briefly everything has its fate which was predetermined millions of years ago in God's sight.

The moment of death, the moment a particular leaf falls, the moment when the peach in your fridge starts decaying, and all the stages of rock until you tripped over it – briefly, every event, insignificant or important – is kept in this book. Believers have faith in fate and they know that the fate God creates is the best for them. That is why, at every moment of their lives, they put their trust in God. In other words, they know that God creates all events in compliance with a divine purpose and there is goodness in whatever God creates. For example, catching a fatal disease, confronting a bitter and merciless enemy, being subjected to false accusations despite being innocent, or encountering the most terrifying events one can imagine do not shake the faith of believers nor arouse any fear in their hearts. They welcome what God has created for them. Believers derive great pleasure from encountering situations which normally terrify or bring despair to a disbeliever. That is because even the most dreadful scenario was previously planned by God to test them. Those who respond to these situations with steadfastness and put their trust in God and to the fate He creates, will earn the love and good pleasure of God. They earn paradise for all eternity. Therefore, believers enjoy the comfort and joy of putting their trust in their Lord throughout their lives. This is a blessing and secret that God discloses to believers. God states in the Qur'an that He loves those who put their trust in Him. (Surah Al 'Imran: 159) God's Messenger, peace be upon him, also remarked this when he said: A servant of God can have no real faith unless he believes in fate with SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"SECRETS OF SUBMISSION TO ONE'S FATE AND PUTTING ONE'S TRUST IN GOD 27 its good and evil sides and knows that he cannot prevent anything that befalls him (good or evil) and he cannot catch anything that escapes from him (good or evil). 4 Another point mentioned in the Qur'an about putting trust in God is \"taking measures.\" The Qur'an informs us about numerous measures believers can take in various situations. In many other verses, God also reveals the secret that those measures which are accepted as a form of worship by God, cannot change the fate. The Prophet Jacob, peace be upon him, advised his sons to take some measures while entering the city but afterwards he reminded them to place trust in God. The relevant verse is as follows: He said, 'My sons! You must not enter through a single gate. Go in through different gates. But I cannot save you from God at all, for judgement comes from no one but God. In Him I put my trust, and let all those who put their trust, put it in Him alone.' (Surah Yusuf: 67) As seen in the words of the Prophet Jacob, believers definitely take precautions, but they know that they cannot change what fate God has willed for them. For example, a person should follow traffic rules and not drive carelessly. This is an important measure and a form of worship performed for one's life and that of others. Yet, if God wills that person to die in a car accident, no measure can be taken to prevent his death. Sometimes a precautionary action or an act may seem to have enabled that person to escape death. Or one may take a crucial decision, which changes the entire course of his life; or one may recover from a fatal disease by showing strength and endurence. Yet, all these occur because SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"SOME SECRETS OF THE QUR'AN 28 God decrees so. Some people misinterpret such events as \"overcoming one's fate\" or \"changing one's fate\". But, no one, not even the seemingly strong and most resolute person in the world, can change what God has decreed. No man has such a power. On the contrary, every being is weak before God's decree. The fact that some people do not accept the fact, does not alter the truth. In fact, denying their fate is also decreed. For that reason, those who escape death or a disease, or whose course of life completely changes, experience these events because they were decreed. God relates this in the Qur'an as follows: Nothing occurs, in the earth or in you, but is inscribed in the Book of Decrees before We make it happen. That is easy for God. In order that you will not be grieved about the things that pass you by or exult about the things that come to you. God does not love any vain or boastful man. (Surat al-Hadid: 22-23) As stated in the above verse, any event that occurs is predetermined and kept in a book in God's sight. Therefore, God tells man not to grieve about what may have escaped him. For example, a person who loses all his property in a fire or in a commercial venture experiences this loss because it was decreed. It is not possible for him to prevent or avoid these happenings. Thus, it would be senseless to have a sense of grievance at such a loss. God puts his people to test by many events that were decreed for them. Those who put their trust in God when they encounter such events earn the good pleasure and love of God.

It may be that you hate something when it is good for you and it may be that you love something when it is bad for you. God knows and you do not know. (Surat al-Baqara: 216) Aware of this secret, believers seek goodness and beauty in every event. No seemingly adverse incident, hardship or mischief ails or worries them. They maintain their composure whether the experience is insignificant or a serious ordeal. Sincere Muslims even see goodness and divine purpose in the loss of all their hard earned SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THERE IS GOOD IN EVERY EVENT 31 possessions. They express gratitude to God for the gift of life. They have faith that God may have protected them from committing an evil act or against too much attachment for possessions. Accordingly, they give their most inner thanks to God because no loss in this world equals the loss in the hereafter. Loss in the hereafter means eternal and intolerable punishment. Those who keep themselves occupied with the remembrance of the hereafter view every event as goodness and beauty leading to the hereafter. Those who overcome such ordeals will recognise their weaknesses before God, and will reconsider how much they are in need of Him. They will turn to God with more humility through prayers and that remembrance will bring them closer to Him. This is surely an enormous benefit to one's hereafter. These aside, by putting absolute trust in God and showing steadfastness, they will earn God's pleasure and will be rewarded with eternal bliss. Man should seek goodness and beauty not only in ordeals, but also in daily routines. For example, burning the food one has painstakingly prepared may lead that person to take numerous measures which would, by the Will of God, prevent a more serious accident in the future. A young person might have failed the college admission test he had pinned his hopes for a future on. He should, however, know that there is goodness in his failure, too; he should be able to think that God might have willed him to avoid some adverse circumstances or people and thereby feel pleased with the result. Alternatively, thinking that God has placed in every event many other blessings which are either obvious or are way beyond the imagination, believers see the beauty of full submission to the guidance of God.

Even if this is the case, he knows for certain that there is goodness in all events. He offers prayers for God to show him the goodness and divine purpose hidden behind everything that happens. Those who are aware that everything has a purpose in God's creation never use phrases \"I wish I had not done this...\" or \"I wish I had not said that\" and so on. Mistakes, defects, or seemingly unfortunate events essentially include blessings and each one of them are the trials of destiny. God gives important lessons and reminders to man in the destiny he creates individually for each person. For those who can evaluate with insight, there are no mistakes or adversities, but lessons, warnings and wisdom from God. For example, a Muslim whose shop burns down will search his soul, and becomes even more sincere and true in his faith, deeming it as a warning by God against over indulgence in worldly goods and attachments. Consequently, no matter what one encounters in this life, the ordeals will all eventually end. A person who recalls a hardship will be amazed that it is nothing more than a reminiscence in the mind. This is also how people recall the scenes from a film. Accordingly, one day will come and the most painful experience will become only a memory, more like the image of a scene from a movie. Only one thing will remain: the attitude a person assumed during the time of hardship and whether God is pleased with him or not. A person will not be called to account for the experiences, but for his attitudes, thoughts and sincerity he displayed at the time of these experiences.

God reveals this secret in the Qur'an as follows: We said, 'Go down from it, every one of you! Then when guidance comes to you from Me, those who follow My guidance will feel no fear and will know no sorrow.' (Surat al-Baqara: 38) Yes, the friends of God will feel no fear and will know no sorrow: those who believe and have done their duty, there is good news for them in the life of the world and in the hereafter.

Forms of prayers God commands man to perform, difficulties He creates to test him, responsibilities that He charges man with are all in proportion to his individual capabilities. This is a good news and comfort to believers, and a manifestation of God's mercy and grace. God relates this secret in verses as follows: And that you do not go near the property of orphans before they reach maturity - except in a good way; that you give full measure and full weight with justice - We impose on no one any more than they can bear; that you are equitable when you speak - even if a near relative is concerned; and that you fulfil God's covenant.

Trade or commerce do not distract them from the remembrance of God, the performance of prayers and serving for religion.

However, man is created weak and forgetful; therefore, makes many mistakes and possesses many failings.

(Surat al-Inshiqaq: 7-9) No doubt, God does not change the bad actions of every person into good. The attributes of those believers whose bad actions God erases and forgives are informed in the Qur'an. Those who avoid serious wrong actions In a verse, God states: \"If you avoid the serious wrong actions you have been forbidden, We will erase your bad SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THE SECRET THAT GOD ERASES BAD ACTIONS 51 actions from you and admit you by a Gate of Honour.\" (Surat an-Nisa': 31). Believers who are aware of this fact observe the limits set by God meticulously and avoid committing what is forbidden. If they ever err out of forgetfulness or heedlessness, they immediately turn to God and repent and ask for forgiveness. God informs us in the Qur'an about His servants whose repentance will be accepted. In this sense, knowing the commandments of God, yet deliberately committing sins, saying \"no matter what happens I will be forgiven\" shows completely flawed reasoning. That is because, God forgives the wrong actions of His servants who commit them out of ignorance and who, without losing any time, repent and display no insistence on them and make up for them: God only accepts the repentence of those who do evil in ignorance and then quickly repent after doing it. God turns towards such people. God is All- Knowing, All-Wise. There is no repentence for people who persist in doing evil until death comes to them and who then say, 'Now I repent,' nor for people who die while they are disbelievers. We have prepared for them a painful punishment. (Surat an- Nisa': 17-18) As the verses suggest, studious avoidance of sins is essential if a person wants his bad actions to be erased and to feel no regret on the day of judgement. A believer who commits a sin, on the other hand, should lose no time in asking for repentance from God.

A person who sees the fire, who hears the despair, remorse and groaning of the people of hell under that painful punishment and who witnesses the punishment of the hell with his own eyes would surely act in the way that would most please God and strive with his utmost striving. This person would pray on time, perform good deeds, would never be careless, would never dare to choose an act that would please God less when he knows there is another act that would please Him more. Because hell, which remains right beside him, would always remind him of his eternal life and of God's punishment. Such a person could not defer his deeds. He would immediately and perfectly perform what his conscience commands him to. He would be meticulous and persistent in prayers. So, in the life of this world, the wrong actions of only those who perform good deeds, fearing God and the day of judgement, as if they had seen the hell and returned back to the world, or as if they always see the fire right beside them will be transformed into good.

Property that is in excess of one's needs is surplus goods. What is important is not the amount given but whether one sincerely gives away what he can really afford. God has knowledge of all things and He has left it to man's conscience to decide the things he actually does not need. Giving away is a very easy form of worship for those who are not seized by worldly ambitions and who have not sold out to this world, but yearn for the hereafter. God has ordered us to give away out of our wealth to avoid attachment to this world. This is a means to purify ourselves of greed. No doubt, this form of worship is very important for believers in respect of their reckoning in the hereafter. God's Messenger, peace be upon him, also said that he who spends in the way of God is favoured: Two people are favoured: One is someone to whom God gave the Qur'an and who lived by it.

Of this God states the following: And among the desert Arabs there are some who believe in God and the Last Day and regard what they give as something, which will bring them nearer to God and to the prayers of the Messenger.

But God informs in the Qur'an that all plots against believers will be foiled, will be returned back against the plotters and will not harm believers in any way. Some of these verses are as follows: ... But then when a Warner did come to them, it only increased their aversion, shown by their arrogance in the land and evil plotting.

The promise of God entailed the failure of all these plots and protection from harm. Following the plans devised, God placed the prophet Joseph in authority over the treasures of the land. After all these, the prophet Joseph commented that the plots of the disbelievers are fated to failure: (Then Joseph said: I asked for this) so that he (my former master) may know at last that I did not dishonour him behind his back and that God most surely does not guide the deviousness of the dishonourable.

(Surat al-Anfal: 46) Qur'anic morality is marked by humility. Those adhering to the moral values of the Qur'an settle quarrels, find solutions to problems, make things easy for people and do not display greed. In the absence of Qur'anic morality, disputes and conflicts are unavoidable. It is perfectly natural that everybody holds different opinions. For instance, 20 people can propose 20 different solutions to a problem. Each solution may be right or consistent within itself.

Believers should feel a profound love for one another, make sacrifices and establish a strong solidarity and co- operation among themselves. Especially at times of hardship, they should keep themselves occupied with the remembrance of God, and be much more patient and supportive towards one another. Quarrelling reduces strength, whereas co-operation increases the strength among the believers. In another verse, God has revealed the secret that if believers are not friends and protectors of one another, there will be confusion and great corruption in the land: Those who disbelieve are the friends and protectors of one another. If you do not act in this way (protect each other) there will be turmoil in the land and great corruption.

No Muslim should consider a quarrel with another Muslim trivial, by saying, \"So what if we quarrelled?\" Because, as God informs us, every dispute among Muslims, means the diminishing of the strength of believers for which Muslims will give an account to God.

Messengers are the people who convey God's message and His commands to people, and warn them of the day of reckoning and of His signs. They are the sincere and blessed people who are chosen by God over the rest of the people and whose acts, attitudes and perfect morals are exemplary. They are the friends of God who are drawn near to Him. As stated in the verse below, obedience to messengers is the indication of one's obedience to God. Whoever obeys the Messenger has obeyed God.

If you do so, you will never fall into error or danger. 8 Disobedience to a messenger is direct disobedience to God and His religion. This is one of the important secrets that God reveals in the Qur'an. In a verse, God relates the state of those who obey the messenger and those who don't: These are God's limits.

As for those who disobey God and His Messenger and overstep His limits, We will admit them into a Fire, remaining in it timelessly, forever. They will have a humiliating punishment.

(Surat an-Nisa': 65) In this verse, a very important secret about the ideal obedience to the messenger is revealed. Most people know the concept of obedience. However, obedience to the messenger is much different from all other forms of obedience people know. As God states in the verse above, believers should obey the messenger wholeheartedly, without harbouring the slightest doubt or showing any hesitation. If one feels any doubt about what the messenger says and considers his own ideas more accurate than the messenger's, then this, as the verse suggests, essentially means he is not a true believer. Believers with true faith and submission know that what the messenger says is the best for them. Even if his words are in conflict with their personal interests, they accept and obey him eagerly and with enthusiasm. This virtuous conduct is a sign of true faith, and God gives the glad tidings of salvation to those who obey the messenger with such submissiveness.

Throughout history, all people have been tested in their obedience to the messengers. God has always chosen His messengers among people. In this context, some narrow-minded and unwise people have not grasped how to obey a man from among themselves or a man who is not wealthier than themselves.

As related in the Qur'an, when Saul, God's messenger, set out with his forces towards the enemy, he warned his men against drinking from the river they would come across.

But those who were sure that they were going to meet God said, 'How many a small force has triumphed over a much greater one by God's permission! God is with the steadfast. (Surat al- Baqara: 249) As seen in the verse, those who did not obey Saul's order grew weak, whereas those who obeyed Saul were given strength by God and, by the Will of God, vanquished the enemy although they were quite in the minority. These are the secrets that God reveals to mankind in the Qur'an. Strength, victory and superiority do not rest on material wealth, prestigious status, being in the majority or possessing physical superiority. Whoever observes God's limits, obeys Him and His messenger, God makes them stronger than all others, and rewards them with innumerable gifts such as wisdom, health, beauty, blessings and wealth.

One of these secrets is about steadfastness. God gives the glad tidings that those who are steadfast will become stronger. Remember that all power belongs to God. Even the strength of a person who is against God, in fact, belongs to God. God grants some faculties to people so as to put them and those around them through a test. Likewise He takes away as easily as He gives whenever He wills. God informs us that those who are steadfast will be strong, that is, He will reinforce them. Of this, God states the following: Yes indeed! But if you are steadfast and have fear of God and they come upon you suddenly, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels, clearly identified. (Surah Ali 'Imran: 125) As stated in the verse above, if God wills, He can make people victorious in imperceptible ways. In one's endeavour to uphold God's religion, for instance, God can provide subtle support to enable the person to make the most inspiring and influential speech and turn the hearts of people who listen toward the religion. Consequently, no one can win a victory or exert an influence on others unless God wills it. The owner of all accomplishments, victories and inspiration is God. What falls to mankind is to follow the commands of God and to observe His limits. In another verse, God informs believers how to achieve great strength: O Prophet! Spur on the belivers to fight.

If there are a hundred of you who are steadfast, they will overcome two hundred; and if there are a thousand of you, they will overcome two thousand with God's permission. God is with the steadfast. (Surat al-Anfal: 65-66) As God states in these verses, if believers do not have any weakness in themselves, and are firm in steadfastness and faith, the strength of a single believer can be equivalent to that of 10 men. In this context, the word \"strength\" holds other connotations other than physical strength. For example, the efforts of a believer to convey the message of religion and to call people to God's way can be equivalent to the efforts of a total of 10 people. Alternatively, the knowledge of a believer can be equivalent to the knowledge of ten people. A good deed a believer performs solely to earn God's pleasure may be equivalent to a deed that 10 people perform together. A single believer can invite as many people as ten disbelievers lead astray to the right path of God and can be a means to the improvement of their faith. A single believer can demolish the disbelief ten disbelievers communicate and replace it with the truth. This secret that God reveals in the Qur'an is of great importance. This is because, if all Muslims race each other toward the right path, no matter how a small a group it may be, God will make them victorious in every affair they SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"SOME SECRETS OF THE QUR'AN 92 undertake.

God gives believers ease in their affairs while making things hard for disbelievers. For this reason, believers who know this secret should never belittle their efforts and say, \"Would my efforts be of any help to change the situation?\", but rather be assured that God will render any sincere deed done with the sole purpose of pleasing Him more effective. A piece of writing on the existence of God, a word that calls people to God or an act in compliance with the moral values of the Qur'an may well lead many people to salvation and kindle in them love and fear of God. We need to keep in mind that the laws and cause-effect phenomena that apply to this world are solely what is revealed in the Qur'an by God.

This is a very important secret, because, it indicates that it is the responsibility of every believer to spread the guidance of the Qur'an among all people. Since this is the case, every believer of conscience should strictly avoid associating partners with God and worship only Him. Before all else, associating partners with God is a sin that God does not forgive and which sends man to hell. However, it may well be that a majority of people relate this concept to pagans who worship idols. Mankind should also be wary of the \"hidden idolatry\". In this form of idolatry, one can readily express his faith in God, acceptance of God as the one and only God and creator and obedience to Him. But, fearing any being other than God, considering the approval and support of other people more important, considering trade, family and ancestry more important than God and striving in His way, are outright idolatry. The true sense of faith as explained in the Qur'an deems the good pleasure of God above and over anything else. The affection displayed to all beings other than God, can only be means to earn God's pleasure. Those who feel indebted to people for a blessing given to them, who regard them as their protector are, in fact, idolaters. This is because, the One who bestows various kinds of sustenance to people is God; the One who feeds, protects and shelters every living being and restores them to health when they are ill is God alone. If God wills, He restores a sick person to health by the hand of a doctor. In this sense, it is illogical for someone to pin his hopes only on the doctor.

However, the life of this world, they are so strongly attached to, is very short and transitory. Even those with long lives will certainly come to terms with death one day. This aside, the life of this world is not even as long as it seems to be. God reveals this secret to mankind in many verses of the Qur'an: He will say, 'How many years did you tarry on the earth?' They will say, 'We tarried there for a day or part of a day. Ask those able to count!' He will say, 'You only tarried there for a little while if you did but know!' 'Did you suppose that We created you for amusement and that you would not return to Us?'

As these dialogues also suggest, after death people realise that they, in fact, stayed in the world only for a short while. That is, the period, which seems to be six to seven decades in the life of the world, is in fact as short as a single day or even much shorter. This is similar to the case of a man who assumes that he had spent days, months or even years in his dream, but who, after awakening, realises that he dreamt only for a few seconds. Some contemplation would enable man to grasp the brevity and temporary nature of the life of this world. For example, everyone makes certain plans and sets some goals for his life. These plans and goals never end. They follow one another. Typically, a person graduates from high school, enrolls in university, and then takes a job with a company. All these are, however, fleeting experiences. In youth, one hardly imagines reaching thirty years old. Yet before too long they reach forty. The shortness of the life of the world is a certain fact God reveals in the Qur'an that can be understood by anyone before dying. For those who grasp this it would be unwise to neglect the endless and real life of the hereafter for such a brief and temporary life. Some of the verses in which God warns mankind of the briefness of the life of this world are as follows: 'My people! The life of the world is only fleeting enjoyment. It is the hereafter, which is the abode of permanence.' (Surah Ghafir: 39) These people love this fleeting world and have put the thought of a Momentous Day behind their backs.

Through casting dread into their hearts, God diminishes the strength of those who oppose believers and who resist God and His religion. It is of great importance that believers should ponder on these verses and draw lessons for themselves. This is because, as mentioned in previous chapters, our hearts are in God's hand, and God sows whatever He wills in the heart of whoever He wills. The duty of believers is not to try to create an impact on others, but only to be sincere. For example, a believer is responsible to warn a person in the light of God's verses. However, that person will only be rightly guided by the advise given, no matter how lucid the explanation, if God guides that person to the right path. By the same token, a believer is helpless against dangers. Alternatively, there is no power to frighten enemies. But God protects and supports believers who are sincere and put forth efforts for the sake of God's pleasure. For example, as said in the verses above, He casts dread into the hearts of their enemies, making them deeply occupied with their own troubles. This way, God gives relief to believers. God inspires various fears into the hearts of disbelievers. There is the fear of death, the future, injury, natural disasters or fear of loss of wealth. Alternatively, the fear of death is greater because a disbeliever does not believe in the hereafter and is strongly attached to this world. Believing that he will be reduced to nothing and lose all possessions, the great fear for death is nurtured. Ultimately, this fear breeds infirmities. God tells us dread is cast into the hearts of disbelievers because they associate others with Him.

Alternatively, one may outwardly seem to do charity works, may found schools or help the poor. However, unless done for the sole purpose of earning the good pleasure of God, reflecting on the fact that one is weak and in need before God and feeling fear of the hereafter, these acts may not be acceptable by God.

Yet, God informs us that man will account for his intentions, thoughts and even what he conceals deep in his heart. Everything in the heavens and everything in the earth belongs to God.

(Surat ash- Shams: 7-9) The inner self is mentioned in the verses as the source of all depravities and wrong acts of people. Having such a feature, the inner self is among the most avowed enemies of mankind. The inner self is arrogant and selfish; it always wants to satisfy its own desires and vanity.

This way, they know that the devices of the inner self will never cease, not even for a single moment. Through temptations, it continuously tries to lead man astray from God's way.

Indeed, the behaviour and manners of disbelievers, which do not comply with the morals of the Qur'an, are shaped completely by their inner-selves. Having no fear of God, disbelievers cannot demonstrate the will to obey their conscience but rather follow their inner-selves.

Apart from the wicked side of the soul, from Surat ash- Shams, we know that God also inspired in the soul a conscience which makes a person restrain his soul from fulfilling lower desires. That is to say, next to an inspiration instigating the soul to evil, the soul is also open to instigation of righteousness.

By contrast, materialism, which seeks to deny the fact of creation in the universe, is nothing but an unscientific fallacy. Once materialism is invalidated, all other theories based on this philosophy are rendered baseless. Foremost of them is Darwinism, that is, the theory of evolution. This theory, which argues that life originated from inanimate matter through coincidences, has been demolished with the recognition that the universe was created by God. American astrophysicist Hugh Ross explains this as follows: Atheism, Darwinism, and virtually all the \"isms\" emanating from the eighteenth to the twentieth century philosophies are built upon the assumption, the incorrect assumption, that the universe is infinite. The singularity has brought us face to face with the cause – or causer – beyond/behind/before the universe and all that it contains, including life itself. 9 It is God Who created the universe and Who designed it down to its smallest detail. Therefore, it is impossible for the theory of evolution, which holds that living beings are not created by God, but are products of coincidences, to be true. Unsurprisingly, when we look at the theory of evolution, we SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 132"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"133 see that this theory is denounced by scientific findings. The design in life is extremely complex and striking. In the inanimate world, for instance, we can explore how sensitive are the balances which atoms rest upon, and further, in the animate world, we can observe in what complex designs these atoms were brought together, and how extraordinary are the mechanisms and structures such as proteins, enzymes, and cells, which are manufactured with them. This extraordinary design in life invalidated Darwinism at the end of the 20th century. We have dealt with this subject in great detail in some of our other studies, and shall continue to do so. However, we think that, considering its importance, it will be helpful to make a short summary here as well. The Scientific Collapse of Darwinism Although a doctrine going back as far as ancient Greece, the theory of evolution was advanced extensively in the 19th century. The most important development that made the theory the top topic of the world of science was the book by Charles Darwin titled \"The Origin of Species\" published in 1859. In this book, Darwin denied that different living species on the earth were created separately by God. According to Darwin, all living beings had a common ancestor and they diversified over time through small changes. Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an \"assumption.\" Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book titled \"Difficulties of the Theory,\" the theory was failing in the face of many critical questions. Darwin invested all his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve the \"Difficulties of the Theory.\" THE EVOLUTION MISCONCEPTION SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 133"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"SOME SECRETS OF THE QUR'AN 134 However, contrary to his expectations, scientific findings expanded the dimensions of these difficulties. The defeat of Darwinism against science can be reviewed under three basic topics: 1) The theory can by no means explain how life originated on the earth. 2) There is no scientific finding showing that the \"evolutionary mechanisms\" proposed by the theory have any power to evolve at all. 3) The fossil record proves completely the contrary of the suggestions of the theory of evolution. In this section, we will examine these three basic points in general outlines: The First Insurmountable Step: The Origin of Life The theory of evolution posits that all living species evolved from a single living cell that emerged on the primitive earth 3.8 billion years ago. How a single cell could generate millions of complex living species and, if such an evolution really occurred, why traces of it cannot be observed in the fossil record are some of the questions the theory cannot answer. However, first and foremost, of the first step of the alleged evolutionary process it has to be inquired: How did this \"first cell\" originate? Since the theory of evolution denies creation and does not accept any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the \"first cell\" originated coincidentally within the laws of nature, without any design, plan, or arrangement. According to the theory, inanimate matter must have produced a living cell as a result of coincidences. This, however, is a claim inconsistent with even the most unassailable rules of biology. SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 134"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"135 \"Life Comes from Life\" In his book, Darwin never referred to the origin of life. The primitive understanding of science in his time rested on the assumption that living beings had a very simple structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous generation, the theory asserting that non-living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while. Similarly, worms developing in meat was assumed to be evidence of spontaneous generation. However, only some time later was it understood that worms did not appear on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies in the form of larvae, invisible to the naked eye. Even in the period when Darwin wrote The Origin of Species , the belief that bacteria could come into existence from non- living matter was widely accepted in the world of science. However, five years after Darwin's book was published, the discovery of Louis Pasteur disproved this belief, which constituted the groundwork of evolution. Pasteur summarized the conclusion he reached after time-consuming studies and experiments: \"The claim that inanimate matter can originate life is buried in history for good.\" 10 Advocates of the theory of evolution resisted the findings of Pasteur for a long time. However, as the development of science unraveled the complex structure of the cell of a living being, the idea that life could come into being coincidentally faced an even greater impasse.

With various theses he advanced in the 1930's, he tried to prove that the cell of a living being could originate by coincidence. These studies, however, were doomed to failure, and Oparin had to make the following confession: Unfortunately, the origin of the cell remains a question which is actually the darkest point of the entire evolution theory. 11 Evolutionist followers of Oparin tried to carry out experiments to solve the problem of the origin of life. The best known of these experiments was carried out by American chemist Stanley Miller in 1953. Combining the gases he alleged to have existed in the primordial earth's atmosphere in an experiment set-up, and adding energy to the mixture, Miller synthesized several organic molecules (amino acids) present in the structure of proteins. Barely a few years had passed before it was revealed that this experiment, which was then presented as an important step in the name of evolution, was invalid, the atmosphere used in the experiment having been very different from real earth conditions. 12 After a long silence, Miller confessed that the atmosphere medium he used was unrealistic. 13 All the evolutionist efforts put forth throughout the 20th century to explain the origin of life ended with failure. The geochemist Jeffrey Bada from San Diego Scripps Institute accepts this fact in an article published in Earth magazine in 1998: Today as we leave the twentieth century, we still face the biggest unsolved problem that we had when we entered the twentieth century: How did life originate on Earth? 14 SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 136"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"THE EVOLUTION MISCONCEPTION 137 The Complex Structure of Life The primary reason why the theory of evolution ended up in such a big impasse about the origin of life is that even the living organisms deemed the simplest have incredibly complex structures. The cell of a living being is more complex than all of the technological products produced by man. Today, even in the most developed laboratories of the world, a living cell cannot be produced by bringing inorganic materials together. The conditions required for the formation of a cell are too great in quantity to be explained away by coincidences. The probability of proteins, the building blocks of cell, being synthesized coincidentally, is 1 in 10 950 for an average protein made up of 500 amino acids. In mathematics, a probability smaller than 1 over 10 50 is practically considered to be impossible. The DNA molecule, which is located in the nucleus of the cell and which stores genetic information, is an incredible databank. It is calculated that if the information coded in DNA were written down, this would make a giant library consisting of 900 volumes of encyclopaedias of 500 pages each. A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: the DNA can only replicate with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can only be realized by the information coded in DNA. As they both depend on each other, they have to exist at the same time for replication. This brings the scenario that life originated by itself to a deadlock. Prof. Leslie Orgel, an evolutionist of repute from the University of San Diego, California, confesses this fact in the September 1994 issue of the Scientific American magazine: It is extremely improbable that proteins and nucleic acids, both of which are structurally complex, arose spontaneously in the same place at the same time. Yet it also seems impossible to have one SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 137"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"SOME SECRETS OF THE QUR'AN 138 without the other. And so, at first glance, one might have to conclude that life could never, in fact, have originated by chemical means. 15 No doubt, if it is impossible for life to have originated from natural causes, then it has to be accepted that life was \"created\" in a supernatural way. This fact explicitly invalidates the theory of evolution, whose main purpose is to deny creation. Imaginary Mechanisms of Evolution The second important point that negates Darwin's theory is that both concepts put forward by the theory as \"evolutionary mechanisms\" were understood to have, in reality, no evolutionary power. Darwin based his evolution allegation entirely on the mechanism of \"natural selection\". The importance he placed on this mechanism was evident in the name of his book: The Origin of Species, By Means Of Natural Selection... Natural selection holds that those living things that are stronger and more suited to the natural conditions of their habitats will survive in the struggle for life. For example, in a deer herd under the threat of attack by wild animals, those that can run faster will survive. Therefore, the deer herd will be comprised of faster and stronger individuals. However, unquestionably, this mechanism will not cause deer to evolve and transform themselves into another living species, for instance, horses. Therefore, the mechanism of natural selection has no evolutionary power. Darwin was also aware of this fact and had to state this in his book \"The Origin of Species:\" Natural selection can do nothing until favourable variations chance to occur. 16 SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 138"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"139 Lamarck's Impact So, how could these \"favourable variations\" occur? Darwin tried to answer this question from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science in his age. According to the French biologist Lamarck, who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generation and these traits, accumulating from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, according to Lamarck, giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation. Darwin also gave similar examples, and in his book \"The Origin of Species,\" for instance, said that some bears going into water to find food transformed themselves into whales over time. 17 However, the laws of inheritance discovered by Mendel and verified by the science of genetics that flourished in the 20th century, utterly demolished the legend that acquired traits were passed on to subsequent generations. Thus, natural selection fell out of favour as an evolutionary mechanism. Neo-Darwinism and Mutations In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the \"Modern Synthetic Theory\", or as it is more commonly known, Neo- Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism added mutations, which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings because of external factors such as radiation or replication errors, as the \"cause of favourable variations\" in addition to natural mutation. Today, the model that stands for evolution in the world is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings present on the earth formed as a result of a process THE EVOLUTION MISCONCEPTION SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 139"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"SOME SECRETS OF THE QUR'AN 140 whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms such as the ears, eyes, lungs, and wings, underwent \"mutations,\" that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an outright scientific fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they always cause harm to them. The reason for this is very simple: the DNA has a very complex structure and random effects can only cause harm to it. American geneticist B.G. Ranganathan explains this as follows: Mutations are small, random, and harmful. They rarely occur and the best possibility is that they will be ineffectual. These four characteristics of mutations imply that mutations cannot lead to an evolutionary development. A random change in a highly specialised organism is either ineffectual or harmful. A random change in a watch cannot improve the watch. It will most probably harm it or at best be ineffectual. An earthquake does not improve the city, it brings destruction. 18 Not surprisingly, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. All mutations have proved to be harmful. It was understood that mutation, which is presented as an \"evolutionary mechanism,\" is actually a genetic occurrence that harms living beings, and leaves them disabled. (The most common effect of mutation on human beings is cancer). No doubt, a destructive mechanism cannot be an \"evolutionary mechanism.\" Natural selection, on the other hand, \"can do nothing by itself\" as Darwin also accepted. This fact shows us that there is no \"evolutionary mechanism\" in nature. Since no evolutionary mechanism exists, neither could any imaginary process called evolution have taken place.

According to the theory of evolution, every living species has sprung from a predecessor. A previously existing species turned into something else in time and all species have come into being in this way. According to the theory, this transformation proceeds gradually over millions of years. Had this been the case, then numerous intermediary species should have existed and lived within this long transformation period. For instance, some half-fish/half-reptiles should have lived in the past which had acquired some reptilian traits in addition to the fish traits they already had. Or there should have existed some reptile-birds, which acquired some bird traits in addition to the reptilian traits they already had. Since these would be in a transitional phase, they should be disabled, defective, crippled living beings. Evolutionists refer to these imaginary creatures, which they believe to have lived in the past, as \"transitional forms.\" If such animals had really existed, there should be millions and even billions of them in number and variety. More importantly, the remains of these strange creatures should be present in the fossil record. In The Origin of Species , Darwin explained: If my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking most closely all of the species of the same group together must assuredly have existed... Consequently, evidence of their former existence could be found only amongst fossil remains. 19 THE EVOLUTION MISCONCEPTION SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 141"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"SOME SECRETS OF THE QUR'AN 142 Darwin's Hopes Shattered However, although evolutionists have been making strenuous efforts to find fossils since the middle of the 19th century all over the world, no transitional forms have yet been uncovered. All the fossils unearthed in excavations showed that, contrary to the expectations of evolutionists, life appeared on earth all of a sudden and fully-formed. A famous British paleontologist, Derek V. Ager, admits this fact, even though he is an evolutionist: The point emerges that if we examine the fossil rec,ord in detail, whether at the level of orders or of species, we find — over and over again — not gradual evolution, but the sudden explosion of one group at the expense of another. 20 This means that in the fossil record, all living species suddenly emerge as fully formed, without any intermediate forms in between. This is just the opposite of Darwin's assumptions. Also, it is very strong evidence that living beings are created. The only explanation of a living species emerging suddenly and complete in every detail without any evolutionary ancestor can be that this species was created. This fact is admitted also by the widely known evolutionist biologist Douglas Futuyma: Creation and evolution, between them, exhaust the possible explanations for the origin of living things. Organisms either appeared on the earth fully developed or they did not. If they did not, they must have developed from pre-existing species by some process of modification. If they did appear in a fully developed state, they must indeed have been created by some omnipotent intelligence. 21 Fossils show that living beings emerged fully developed and in a perfect state on the earth.

During this alleged evolutionary process, which is supposed to have started 4-5 million years ago, it is claimed that there existed some \"transitional forms\" between modern man and his ancestors. According to this completely imaginary scenario, four basic \"categories\" are listed: 1. Australopithecus 2. Homo habilis 3. Homo erectus 4. Homo sapiens Evolutionists call the so-called first ape-like ancestors of men \"Australopithecus\" which means \"South African ape.\" These living beings are actually nothing but an old ape species that has become extinct. Extensive research done on various Australopithecus specimens by two world famous anatomists from England and the USA, namely, Lord Solly Zuckerman and Prof. Charles Oxnard, has shown that these belonged to an ordinary ape species that became extinct and bore no resemblance to humans. 22 Evolutionists classify the next stage of human evolution as \"homo,\" that is \"man.\" According to the evolutionist claim, the living beings in the Homo series are more developed than Australopithecus. Evolutionists devise a fanciful evolution scheme by arranging different fossils of these creatures in a particular order. This scheme is imaginary because it has never been proved that there is an evolutionary relation between these different classes.

However, recent findings of paleoanthropologists have revealed that Australopithecus, Homo habilis and Homo erectus lived at different parts of the world at the same time. 24 Moreover, a certain segment of humans classified as Homo erectus have lived up until very modern times. Homo sapiens neandarthalensis and Homo sapiens sapiens (modern man) co- existed in the same region. 25 This situation apparently indicates the invalidity of the claim that they are ancestors of one another. A paleontologist from Harvard University, Stephen Jay Gould, explains this deadlock of the theory of evolution although he is an evolutionist himself: What has become of our ladder if there are three coexisting lineages of hominids (A. africanus, the robust australopithecines, and H. habilis), none clearly derived from another? Moreover, none of the three display any evolutionary trends during their tenure on earth. 26 Put briefly, the scenario of human evolution, which is sought to be upheld with the help of various drawings of some \"half ape, half human\" creatures appearing in the media and course books, that is, frankly, by means of propaganda, is nothing but a tale with no scientific ground. Lord Solly Zuckerman, one of the most famous and respected scientists in the U.K., who carried out research on this subject for years, and particularly studied Australopithecus fossils for 15 years, finally concluded, despite being an evolutionist himself, that there is, in fact, no such family tree branching out from ape-like creatures to man.

According to Zuckerman's spectrum, the most \"scientific\"–that is, depending on concrete data–fields of science are chemistry and physics. After them come the biological sciences and then the social sciences. At the far end of the spectrum, which is the part considered to be most \"unscientific,\" are \"extra-sensory perception\"–concepts such as telepathy and sixth sense–and finally \"human evolution.\" Zuckerman explains his reasoning: We then move right off the register of objective truth into those fields of presumed biological science, like extrasensory perception or the interpretation of man's fossil history, where to the faithful (evolutionist) anything is possible - and where the ardent believer (in evolution) is sometimes able to believe several contradictory things at the same time. 27 The tale of human evolution boils down to nothing but the prejudiced interpretations of some fossils unearthed by certain people, who blindly adhere to their theory. Technology In The Eye and The Ear Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of \"how we see\". Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the retina of the eye. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and they reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain called the centre of vision. These electric signals are perceived in this centre of the brain as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.

That means that the inside of the brain is solid dark, and light does not reach the location where the brain is situated. The place called the centre of vision is a solid dark place where no light ever reaches; it may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness. The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the 20th century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you read, your hands with which you hold it, then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, coloured, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective having depth. For many years, ten of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV, and reach the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system but it is not possible to watch it without putting on glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.

Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot? If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear; the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them; the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalises in the centre of hearing in the brain. The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just like it is from light: it does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your brain, which is insulated from sound, you listen to the symphonies of an orchestra, and hear all the noises in a crowded place. However, if the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, it would be seen that a complete silence is prevailing there. As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high- fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who THE EVOLUTION MISCONCEPTION SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 147"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"SOME SECRETS OF THE QUR'AN 148 have been working on this endeavour, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality HI-FI systems produced by the biggest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a HI-FI you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the technology of the human body are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does HI-FI; it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man. So far, no visual or recording apparatus produced by man has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater fact lies beyond all this. To Whom Does the Consciousness that Sees and Hears Within the Brain Belong? Who is it that watches an alluring world in its brain, listens to symphonies and the twittering of birds, and smells the rose? The stimulations coming from the eyes, ears, and nose of a human being travel to the brain as electro-chemical nervous impulses. In biology, physiology, and biochemistry books, you can find many details about how this image forms in the brain. However, you will never come across the most important fact about this subject: Who is it that perceives these electro- chemical nervous impulses as images, sounds, odours and sensory events in the brain? There is a consciousness in the brain that perceives all this without feeling any need for eye, ear, and nose. To whom does this consciousness belong? There SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 148"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"149 is no doubt that this consciousness does not belong to the nerves, the fat layer and neurons comprising the brain. This is why Darwinist-materialists, who believe that everything is comprised of matter, cannot give any answer to these questions. For this consciousness is the spirit created by God. The spirit needs neither the eye to watch the images, nor the ear to hear the sounds. Furthermore, nor does it need the brain to think. Everyone who reads this explicit and scientific fact should ponder on Almighty God, should fear Him and seek refuge in Him, He Who squeezes the entire universe in a pitch-dark place of a few cubic centimeters in a three-dimensional, coloured, shadowy, and luminous form. A Materialist Faith The information we have presented so far shows us that the theory of evolution is a claim evidently at variance with scientific findings. The theory's claim on the origin of life is inconsistent with science, the evolutionary mechanisms it proposes have no evolutionary power, and fossils demonstrate that the intermediate forms required by the theory never existed. So, it certainly follows that the theory of evolution should be pushed aside as an unscientific idea. This is how many ideas such as the earth-centered universe model have been taken out of the agenda of science throughout history. However, the theory of evolution is pressingly kept on the agenda of science. Some people even try to represent criticisms directed against the theory as an \"attack on science.\" Why? The reason is that the theory of evolution is an indispensable dogmatic belief for some circles. These circles are blindly devoted to materialist philosophy and adopt Darwinism because it is the only materialist explanation that can be put THE EVOLUTION MISCONCEPTION SOMESECRETSOFTHEQURAN* 15/12/01 14:12 Page 149"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"SOME SECRETS OF THE QUR'AN 150 forward for the workings of nature. Interestingly enough, they also confess this fact from time to time. A well known geneticist and an outspoken evolutionist, Richard C. Lewontin from Harvard University, confesses that he is \"first and foremost a materialist and then a scientist\": It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is absolute, so we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door. 28 These are explicit statements that Darwinism is a dogma kept alive just for the sake of adherence to the materialist philosophy. This dogma maintains that there is no being save matter. Therefore, it argues that inanimate, unconscious matter created life. It insists that millions of different living species; for instance, birds, fish, giraffes, tigers, insects, trees, flowers, whales and human beings originated as a result of the interactions between matter such as the pouring rain, the lightning flash, etc., out of inanimate matter. This is a precept contrary both to reason and science. Yet Darwinists continue to defend it just so as \"not to allow a Divine Foot in the door.\" Anyone who does not look at the origin of living beings with a materialist prejudice will see this evident truth: All living beings are works of a Creator, Who is All-Powerful, All-Wise and All-Knowing. This Creator is God, Who created the whole universe from non-existence, designed it in the most perfect form, and fashioned all living beings.
