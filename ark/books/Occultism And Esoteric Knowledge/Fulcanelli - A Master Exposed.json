But before this arti cle will engag e itself with thi s mysteriou s brothe rhood, there’ s one chara cter that we still have t o discu ss, becau se of hi s importa nce in the whol e mystery; the owner of “la librairie du M erveilleux\", Pierre Dujol s de V alois ... Pierre DUJOLS de Valois (1862-1926) Pierre Dujol s de V alois, an in dire ct desce nda nt of the Val ois family (Di dn’t i m entio n some wh ere i n this arti cle t hat “som eon e did ev en sug gest th at Ful canelli wa s a descen dent of the Valois family”?). Well, it seems that Dujols wa s a descend ant of a ‘bastard-bran ch’ of th e origin al Val ois family, a s the Fren ch source s claim. Fro m the variou s sources whi ch i’ve con sulte d for this arti cle e merg es a pi cture that Dujol s is th e pivot on which eve rything hin ges. Pierre Duj ol's bookstore, l a librai rie du Merve illeux, attracted th e Parisi an he rmetists of th e time; Oswald Wirth (18 60-1943 ), Re né Guén on (188 6-19 51), Je an-Julien Ch ampagn e, Pau l Vulliaud (187 5-19 50), Ren é Sch walle r de Lubi cz (1 887-196 2), Jules Bo ucher (190 2-1 957 ), Gasto n Sa uvage et c. T hey were M artinist s, Th eosophi sts, Ro sicru cian s, Ma son s and Gnos tics . Pierre Dujols was in contac t with mo st of the well-kno wn Fre nch o ccultists of hi s time. For in stance, Dujol s allege dly had develo ped a tight relation ship with the pre side nt an d Gran d M aste r of l 'Ordre M artiniste, Gé rard A. V. Encausse (Pa pus, 18 65-191 6), to who m he refered a s 'le che r Maître'. The boo ksh op the librai rie du Merveill eux wa s a m eeting pla ce f or a grou p of alchemi sts/h ermeticist s that include d Re né Sch walle r de Lubicz, Hen ry Coton Alvart, Jea n-Julie n Cham pagn e, Celli and others. Dujol s wa s t he tea cher o f Hen ry Coto n Alvart and a person al frie nd of J-J Cha mpagn e. Th e name Alva rt is little known to the ge neral publi c. Alvart, a ch emical engi nee r, was i.a. a clo se associ ate of Sch walle r de Lubi cz to whom S chwaller owed all his kno wled ge on al chem y. Henry Cot on Alvart became involved with Sch waller’s m essiani c and co-m aso nic g roup Le s Veilleurs. “L es Veille urs” wa s found ed in 1919 a s the interio r circl e of the Cent re Apo stoliqu e of which Alvart was the vice-p resid ent. But i’m straying from the subje ct ( notes 1 )... Acco rding to Mme Ge nevi ève Du boi s, author of “Fulcan elli Devoilé”, it is b eyond any d oubt that this alch emist gro up (Ren é Schwall er, Alva rt, J-J Ch ampa gne ) wa s lead by Dujol s. Pie rre Dujol s was i. a. a sch ola r of Helleni stic literatur e. Dujols sup port ed a thesi s that the Fren ch langu age had origi nated from the ancie nt, cla ssi cal Gree k lang uage. He wa s a parti san of th e ‘Cab alisti c’ th eorie s of i.a. Gra sset d’ Orcet and hi s ‘langu age of the bi rds’, o r, as it was expre ssed by the medieval initiates, the ‘Gree n lan guage’. Thi s the ory assu mes (in bri ef) that there ha s always existe d an initiate’s langu age, a kind of ‘m ulti-lingu al wo rd play’ whi ch is applie d to re veal ce rtain asso ciation s, meanin gful asso ciation s, betwe en id eas. Of spe cial interest here is that thi s concept was also adapted by ‘F ulcanelli’ in hi s m asterpiece \"Le Mystère des Cathédral es\". Fulcanelli’ s key to unr avel the greater mysteri es of alchemy and the symboli sm of the medi eval cathe drals lies i n the unde rsta ndin g of “the p honetic la w of the spo ken Ca bala”, whi ch is the ‘Green l anguag e’ or th e ‘langua ge of the bird s’ (p art two of this article will dwell at length on this concept).
