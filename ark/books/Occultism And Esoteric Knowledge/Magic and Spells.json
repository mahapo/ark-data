[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The weave he world of Toril is literally a magical place . All existence is infused with magical power, and poten- tial energy lies untapped in every rock, every stream, every living creature, even the air itself . Raw magic is the frozen stuff of creation, the mute and mindless will of being, suf- fusing every bit of matter and present in every manifestation of energy throughout the world . Magic permeates the peoples of Faerûn as well as the lands . Every town is home to mighty temples venerating the deities and housing clerics who call upon divine power to heal injury, ward against evil, and defend the lives and property of the faithful . Subtle and astute wizards stand by (and sometimes behind) the throne of every land, turning their formidable powers to the service of their lords . Aber- rations made by ancient tragic seethe and hunger in the dark spaces beneath the world's surface, awaiting the chance to feed . Even the most unimaginative fighter or most brazen rogue quickly learns to respect the power of magic, or sees her career as an adventurer come to a spectacular and ghastly end . Mortals cannot directly shape raw magic . Instead, most who wield magic make use of the Weave . The Weave is the manifestation of raw magic, a kind of interface between the will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic . Without the Weave, raw magic is locked away and inaccessible-an archmage can't light a candle in a dead magic zone . But, surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning to blast her foes, transport herself hundreds of miles in the blink of an eye, even reverse death itself . All spells, magic items, spell-like abilities, and even supernatural abilities such as a ghost's ability to walk through walls, depend on the Weave and call upon it in different ways . The exact nature of the Weave is elusive because it is many things simultaneously . The Weave is the body of Mystra, the goddess of tragic . Mystra has dominion over magic worked throughout Toril, but she cannot shut off the flow of magic altogether without ceasing to exist herself . The Weave is the conduit spellcasters use to channel magical energy for their spells, both arcane and divine . Finally, the Weave is the fabric of esoteric rules and formulas that comprises the Art (arcane spellcasting) and the Power (divine spellcasting) . Every- thing from the texts of arcane spellbooks to the individual compo- nents of spells is part of the Weave . Magic not only flows from source to spellcaster through the Weave, the Weave gives spellcast- ers the tools they need to shape magic to their purposes . Whenever a spell, spell-like ability, supernatural ability, or magic item functions, the threads o£ the Weave intertwine, knit, warp, twist, and fold to make the effect possible . When characters use div- ination spells such as detect magic, identify, or analyze dweomer, they glimpse the Weave . A spell such as dispel magic smooths the Weave, attempting to return it to its natural state . Spells such as antimagic field rearrange the Weave so that magic flows around, rather than through, the area affected by the spell . Areas where magic goes awry, such as wild tragic zones and dead magic zones, represent damage to the Weave . Wild Magic In some areas of Toril, the Weave is so warped or frayed that magic does not function reliably . This damage may be due to some magical disaster, such as those that were common during the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR, or due to some powerful effect that distorts the Weave, such as a mythal (see Elven High Magic, below) . Most zones of wild magic creat- ed during the Time of Troubles have since disappeared, but small pock- ets of wild magic remain, especially underground and in wilderness areas DETECTING WILD MAGIC ZONES Wild magic zones are generally unnoticed until they make some spell or effect go awry . A character who views a wild magic zone with a detect magic spell detects the presence of magic on the first round and the existence of a wild magic zone on the second . If the charac- ter studies the area for 3 rounds, he can attempt a Spellcraft check (DC 25) to determine the exact borders of the affected area . Some clever wizards use existing wild magic zones to defend their towers or strongholds . With careful study, they chart the boundaries of the wild magic effect and then use this information to best advan- tage when fighting on their home ground against enemy spellcasters ."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"TABLE d% 01-10 11-2f EFFECTS OF WILD MAGIC ZONES Any spell or spell-like ability whose caster is within a wild magic zone is vulnerable to the effects of wild magic . (Wild magic does not affect supernatural, extraordinary, or natural abilities .) The caster must roll a caster level check (DC 1S + spell level) . For a magic item, use its caster level for the caster level check . If the caster level check fails, roll on . Table 2-1 : Wild Magic Effects to determine if the spell actually goes awry, and if so, how . Spells or spell-like abilities cast from outside a wild magic zone at targets inside the zone are not affected by the zone, nor are mobile effects brought into a wild magic zone . Only magic originating inside the zone is affected . -1 : WILD MAGIC EFFECTS Effect\" The spell rebounds on the caster with normal effect . If the spell cannot affect the caster, it fails . The spell affects a random target or area . The DM should randomly choose a different target from #mong those in range of the spell or relocate the point of origin of the spell to a random place within range of the spell . To generate the direction in which the point of origin is moved randomly, roll 1d8 on the Grenadelike Weapons diagram on page 138 of the Player's Handbook . To generate how far the point of origin is moved from its intended position randomly, roll 3d6 . Multi- ply the result by S feet for close-range spells, 20 feet for medium-range spells, or by 80 feet for long-range spells . It is possible for the spell effect to extend outside the wild magic zone ; however, its point of origin cannot exceed its range . If the result generated would do that, adjust the point of origin to the limit of the range in the randomly generated direction . Spells whose range is personal or touch simply fail . T MAGIC Open any three books describing the magic and mage lore of Faerûn, and you're apt to find three conflicting accounts of the origins and true nature of - magic . Some of this apparent contra- diction is deliberate falsehood designed to restrict the mastery of magic to those beings properly trained . Much of the rest of it arises from strange views or outright mistakes often unwittingly\" reproduced by later scholars . Hear now the truth of things, as best it is understood . To speak simply, all known worlds and planes swarm with ever-present ener- gies . Large and small, free-flowing or bound by physical barriers or magical effects (themselves merely energies shaped and designed to restrict or hold other energies), these surges . and dissipations of energy give light and life and movement to everything . They are the stuff of life itself, and they would be present even if all living and once-living things on Toril were stripped away to bare rocks . What some folk refer to as magic and wizards speak of as the Art is the means by which some beings can call on the ever-pres- ent .energies and wield them to create effects . Sorcerers do this instinctively through an innate gift and the incredible force of their personalities . Bard songs waken echoes o£ the songs of begin- ning, the music of creation itself . Wizard's construct processes- spells-enabling them to bend the Weave to their will in order to do what they desire . The divine power infusing any cleric holding the spells of her god or goddess can do the same, shaping the 26-40 41-SO 51-55 S6-8S 86-95 96-100 Mystra and the weave Nothing happens .

Saving throws against the spell suffer a -2 penalty . The spell is maximized as if with the Maximize Spell feat . If the spell is already maximized, this result has no further effect . SUPPRESSING WILD MAGIC Through hard-earned experience, Faerûn's spellcasters have stumbled across a couple of methods for dealing with a wild magic zone . An area dispel use of dispel magic cast into a .wild magic zone causes magic in the area covered by the spell to function normally for 1d4 minutes . An area dispel use of greater dispelling causes magic to work normally for 1d4x10 minutes . A wish or miracle spell permanently repairs all wild magic zones in a 30-foot-radius area (or a 30-foot- Weave through the lioly (or unholy) power granted her . Many types of magic - rune magic, shadow magic (not to be confused with the Shadow Weave), gem magic, elemental magic, even the elven high magic of old - have been spoken of down the years, but these are all merely different processes or paths to the same mastery of natural energies . This endless, ever-shifting web of forces is known as the Weave . Humans refer to the entity or awareness that is bound to the Weave of Toril as Mystra, and wor- ship her as their goddess of magic . The present Mystra is a recently ascended mortal woman, who took over from her exhausted predecessor during the Time of Troubles . Mystra exists to give magic to all creatures and to con- trol its use . In ancient times, the archmages of Netheril ignored the dictates of Mystryl, goddess of magic at the time . One, the wizard Karsus the Mad, tried to seize divinity by the casting of mighty spells that would have wrecked Toril'sWeave . Mystryl sac- rificed herself to save the Weave . Her successor Mystra decreed that no mortals would be allowed to wield such terrible magic again-and that decree holds to this day : Mystra wards the Weave against those powerful or reckless enough to damage it further . Until the world changes or the divine powers themselves lay down their guardianship over human affairs, the high and perilous magic of the past remains locked away under Mystra's eye ."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"radius portion of a larger wild magic zone) . None of these spells, how- ever, are effective against wild magic effects caused by a mythal . Dead Magic In some areas of Toril, the Weave is absent altogether . The Weave has a tear or hole, and the area effectively has no magic at all Like the rare wild magic zones, many regions of dead magic were created during the Time of Troubles and have since faded or retreated . Dead magic zones often persist in places where extreme concentrations of magical power were abruptly scattered or destroyed-in the vicinity of a shattered mythal, at the spot where an artifact was broken, br at the scene of a god's death . DETECTING DEAD MAGIC Spellcasters and creatures with spell-like or supernatural abilities immediately notice when they enter a zone of dead magic . Spell- casters are attuned to the Weave, and they feel uneasy and uncom- fortable in dead magic zones . A Weave user can take a move- equivalent action to note the exact boundary of a dead magic zone . Shadow Weave users are not attuned to the Weave and experience no such unusual sensations in regions of dead magic . Any spellcaster, Weave or Shadow Weave, can use a detect magic spell to delineate the extent of any dead magic within the spell's range . Naturally, a Weave user must be outside the affected area in order to employ this tactic . EFFECTS OF DEAD MAGIC A dead magic zone functions in most respects as an antimagic field spell, except that it does not impede the spells or spell-like abilities of Shadow Weave users, nor does it interfere with the operation of Shadow Weave magic items . Divination spells cannot detect subjects that are within dead magic zones . Finally, it isn't possible to use a teleportation effect to move into or out of a dead magic zone . A dead magic area cannot temporarily be returned to normal function . A wish or miracle spell permanently repairs all dead magic zones in a 30- foot-radius area (or a 30-foot-radius portion of a larger dead magic zone) spellfife Spellfire is the raw energy of the Weave . It can be manipulated in two ways . Mystra gives the silver fire ability to her Chosen and certain other favored servants . The spellfire ability-the wielding of true spellfire-is Right or wrong, legends hold that only one person in all Faerûn is gifted with true spellfire at a time . Gossip identifies that one person today as the lass Shandril Shessair, an orphaned kitchen- maid from a tavern in Highmoon of Deepingdale . Shandril has spellfire, yes, and a hundred mages hound her for - it, Zhentarim and T hayans and Cult of the Dragon and independ- ents, slaughtering each other in their ruthless pursuit of her power . Learn this, if you heed nothing else in this book : Legends lie . Mystra's Chosen wield lesser spellfire, if they care to call on it, and some among them command true spellfire . A mage hiding'in the Border Kingdoms possesses true spellfire, and a cruel and arrogant noble of Chessenta, and the wizard R but fm sure you grasp my point . \t s In the early Sword Coast North, the ranger Haelam Sunder- MAGIC The Story of spellfire by far the more powerful of these rare and precious talents . It is a random gift bestowed upon only a handful of women and men in a generation . Spellfire in any form is refined, controlled raw magic . In benefi- cent manifestations, it is a font of silver light and healing energy . In,battle, it is a searing blue-white jet of all-consuming radiance . SILVER FIRE This powerful supernatural ability is unique to the Chosen of Mystra . Manifesting as a beautiful silver-white flame that sur- rounds the wielder and fills the area into which it is projected, silver fire can be used for different effects . It can act as a ring of warmth or a ring of mind shielding, allow the user to breathe water, or banish all external magical compulsions upon the user as if a greater dispelling spell were cast upon her . Only one of . the above effects can be used at any time . The user can call upon silver fire to revitalize her, allowing her to function without food or drink for up to seven days . (This func- tion can only be used once a tenday .) Once every 70 minutes she may unleash silver fire as a blast of flame . This blast may be in an area 5 feet wide and up to 70 feet long, breaking through barriers as a lightning bolt would and overcoming magical barriers and spell resistance automatically . This blast deals 4d12 points of fire damage (Reflex half DC 23) . Alternately, the silver fire can be unleashed in a 70-foot cone, dealing no damage but permanently restoring dead magic zones within the cone to normal and dispelling (as a greater dispelling spell) any antimagic, field effects that contact the cone . This cone effect is draining on the Weave, and Mystra discourages its use except for emergencies . All effects function as if cast by a 20th-level sorcerer . SPELLFIRE Persons gifted with the spellfire ability can do amazing things, dependent upon their skill, talent, and the amount of magical energy they have within them at the time . In general, spellfire can be used to heal, create blasts of destructive fire, or absorb magical effects it contacts, although the exact effects vary by circumstance and user . Talented wielders can release multiple blasts at once or even fly using the ability . A spellfire wielder can ready an action to absorb spells targeted at her as if she were a rod of absorption . She gets one level of spell- fire energy for every spell level absorbed and can store a number of spellfire energy levels equal to her Constitution score . stone undoubtedly possessed spellfire . He stood alone against an ore horde pouring south past the Coldwood - and turned them into smokes and scorch scars . \t - I could go on . So can anyone who cares to spend the years in study at Candlekeep that I did before I chose to flee to this name- less backwater keep and cloak myself in squalor and obscurity . Why did h spend my fortune and my eyesight, and then-steal away to here, to grow wizened and ugly and bent? Why? Well, because I have true spellfire too, of course . Come looking for me, and I will blast you to dust, and then lay waste to all your descendants, ancestors, and the realm you came from, every last tree and stone of it . Why? Well, it's what I usually do . -Baerendra Riverhand, Sage of Spandeliyon"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"As a standard action, she may expend these spellfire energy levels as a ranged touch attack (maximum range 400 feet), dealing 1d6 points of spellfire damage per level expended (Reflex half DC 20) . Spellfire damage is half fire damage and half raw magical power, just like the damage of aflame strike spell is half fire and half divine energy . Creatures with immunity, resistance, or protection against fire apply these effects to half the damage . A spellfire wielder can also heal a target by touch, restoring 2 hit points per spellfire energy level expended for this purpose . Unlike most supernatural abilities, spellfire is affected by spells and magic items that affect spell-like abilities, such as a rod of absorption or a rod of negation (if pointed at the manifestation rather than the wielder) . It can be thwarted or counterspelled by dispel magic, and theoretically a spellfire wielder could counterspell another's spellfire . However, spellfire is a supernatural ability and does not provoke an attack of opportunity when used, nor is it sub- ject to spell resistance . secret Lore Since the days when elves, dwarves, giants, and dragons ruled a Faerun of trackless forest and unspoiled wilderness, those who could manipulate the Weave have sought deeper understanding, greater power, and hidden knowledge in the hope of gaining an advantage over their enemies . The early human empires were no different . The Imaskari mastered the lore of gates and portals, transporting thou- sands of hapless slaves from other worlds to serve their arcane might . The Netherese studied the art of devising magic devices, cre- ating marvels and terrors that still slumber under the sands of Anauroch . The Raumathari blighted Faerun forever by summoning hordes of ore warriors to serve in their war against old Narfell and then losing control of their own warriors . Wizards dream of secret schools of magic, paths of spells made possible by a new understanding of the Art, and forbidden studies leading to awesome new powers . Dozens of paths to power and understanding have been tried and abandoned, and new research- some founded in meticulous study, some inspired by fevered flights of horror-routinely unveils some new methodology of arcane spell- casting or results in spells never . before seen in Faerun . Stories abound of the legendary spells of old Netheril and the van- ished elven realms, spells whose power dwarfed that of the mightiest wish possible today . Wizards have unlocked the secrets of a dark Weave unfettered by Mystra's power, clerics and adepts draw potent spells MAGIC The Magister At any time in Faerun, one wizard is anointed by Mystra and Azuth as the Magister . Most believe that this office is usually gained through competition (seizing it from the incumbent in an often fatal spell duel) . Holding it confers special powers on its owner . It also imperils its holder by making him or her . the target of many ambitious and powerful mages all over Faerun . The Magister is, the personal champion of Mystra . This doesn't mean the Magister fights on Mystra's behalf, but rather that the office is intended to further the influence and power of Mystra by making magic more available to any who would seek to know its secrets . Magisters often goad or teach other wizards to develop new spells, improve old ones, and increase their own magical powers as pupils or challengers of the Magister . A Magister gains special powers and access to many spells s 57 with runes, and the wreckage of ancient dweomers lie scattered across the land in the form of a portal network riddling the fabric of space . The Shadow weave During the course of her eternal war with the goddess Selûne, the goddess Shar created the Shadow Weave in response to Selûne's cre- ation of Mystra and the birth of the Weave . If the Weave is a loose mesh permeating reality, the Shadow Weave is the pattern formed by the negative space between the Weave's strands . It provides an alternative conduit and methodology for casting spells . Shar, being the goddess of secrets, has mostly kept the secret of the Shadow Weave to herself . Over the millennia some mortals, mainly her servants, have been allowed to discover the Shadow Weave or have stumbled across it in their researches . Shadow Weave users enjoy several advantages . First, they ignore disruptions in the Weave . A Shadow Weave effect works normally in a dead magic or wild magic zone . (An antimagic field, which blocks the flow of magic, remains effective against Shadow Weave magic, as does spell resistance .) Skilled Shadow Weave users are able to cast spells that are extraordinarily difficult for Weave users to perceive, counter, or dispel . Shadow Weave users also suffer some disadvantages . First, Shar has full control over the Shadow Weave and can isolate any creature from it or silence it entirely without any harm to herself . Second, the secrets of the Shadow Weave are disquieting and injurious to the mortal mind . Without assistance from Shar, a Shadow Weave user loses a bit of his or her mind . Third, while the Weave serves equally well for any kind of spell, the Shadow Weave is best for spells that sap life or muddle the mind and senses, and is unsuited to spells that manipulate energy or matter-and cannot support any spell that produces light . (See the Shadow Weave Magic feat in Chapter 1 : Characters for details .) Finally, the more familiar a mortal becomes with the secrets of the Shadow Weave, the more divorced she becomes from the Weave . An accomplished Shadow Weave user can work spells that Weave users find difficult to detect, dispel, or counter, but the Shadow Weave user also becomes similarly unable to affect spells worked through the Weave . SHADOW WEAVE MAGIC ITEMS Magic items created by those who use the Shadow Weave are rare and dangerous . Only the clergy of Shar and Shar's few arcane devo- tees create any number of Shadow Weave items . Shadow adepts unal- unknown to normal wizards and sorcerers . Mages who come from competitive lands such as Thay inevitably see ascensiol to Magis- ter as a way to become the most powerful wizard in Faerun . They crave the special powers of the office to use them to slay old foes and potential rivals and to seize any magic that interests them . The violent history of the office reflects the ambitions of such deadly and selfish wizards . However, Magisters who allow themselves to be guided by higher purposes are taught, cajoled, and guided per- sonally by the god Azuth, and given tasks that spread magic . To most mortals of Faerun, a serving Magister is someone who appears without warning to bestow magic, issue a warning, or hurl or prevent a spell . Why create Magisters, and have them behave thus? As the old wizards' maxim says : \"Gods work in mysterious ways, and magic is the greatest mystery of all .\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"lied to Shar's church are rare and reclusive enough that only a hand- ful of magic items are manufactured as Shadow Weave items . Shadow Weave items are nearly identical to items created by Weave users, but the differences are profound . Spell-like effects generated from Shadow Weave items have the same benefits and limitations that a Shadow Weave spellcaster has : Effects from the schools of Enchantment, Illusion, and Necroman- cy gain a +1 bonus on their save DCs and a +1 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance . The same benefits apply to effects with the darkness designator . Effects from the schools of Evocation and Transmutation have their caster levels reduced by one (though their costs are based on the original caster level) . The reduced caster level affects the spell's range, duration, damage, and any other level-dependent variables the effect might have . The effect's save DC is reduced by -1 and caster level checks to overcome spell resistance suffer a -1 penalty . The DC to dispel Evocation or Transmutation effects from a Shadow Weave item is 11 + the reduced caster level . In general, Shadow Weave users do not bother to create items that include Evocation or Transmutation effects . Shadow Weave items cannot generate effects with the light designator . Shadow Weave items can pose a serious danger to users who are not familiar with the mysteries of the Shadow Weave . Activating a Shadow Weave item through spell completion, spell trigger, or com- mand word deals 1d4 points of temporary Wisdom damage to the user unless the user has the Shadow Weave Magic feat . A use-acti- vated Shadow Weave item deals 1 point of temporary Wisdom damage the first time it is used each day unless the user has the Shadow Weave Magic feat . If the item functions continuously, the temporary Wisdom damage occurs at dusk each day or when the user takes off or puts aside the item, whichever comes first . Elven High Maqic \t , In ancient tines, before the Weave took on its present form, the rules of magic were different . Many beings experimented with powerful dweomers that produced larger and much more potent effects than are possible today, Many minor and major artifacts date back to these times . Just as one can find ancient artifacts scattered across Faerûn, one also can find ancient and powerful magical effects still lingering (and usual- ly functioning erratically) today . The most famous of these is the . mythal of Myth Drannor (see the section on the forest of Cormanthor in Chapter 4 : Geography) . A mythal is an ancient form of elven magic created by a group of spellcasters working together to create a lasting magical effect over a large area . Mythals that remain today usually are beginning to fail but resist attempts to dispel them . They can produce any number of bizarre effects, including wild magic (see the Wild Magic section above) . The exact nature of such effects varies with each mythal . Rune Magic In the snowbound mountains of the North, dwarves and giants have dwelled for uncounted years as rivals and enemies, and their deeds are only rumored in human lands . In the lore of the shield dwarves, runes-carefully inscribed symbols from the secret characters of the dwarven alphabet-can be carved to hold spells of great potency . LEARNING THE RUNES In order to use rune magic, a character must learn the Inscribe Rune feat (see Chapter 1 : Characters) . Rune magic is strongly tied to the dwarven and giant deities and is thus the province of divine spell- casters . Some students of rune magic choose to virtually abandon the normal practice of magic in order to concentrate on their chosen medium, becoming runecasters of great power . MAGIC CREATING RUNES If you know Inscribe Rune, any divine spell you currently have prepared can instead be cast as a rune . A rune is a temporary mag- ical writing similar to a scroll . It can be triggered once before it loses its magical power, but it lasts indefinitely until triggered . A rune written or painted on a surface fades away when expended, erased, or dispelled . A rune carved into a surface remains behind\" as a bit of nonmagical writing even after its magic is expended . Inscribing a rune takes 10 minutes plus the casting time of the spell to be included . When you create a rune, you can set the caster level at anywhere from the minimum caster level necessary to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level . When you create a rune, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell . You must provide any material components or focuses the spell requires If casting the spell would reduce your XP total, you pay this cost upon beginning the rune in addition to the XP cost for making the rune itself . Inscribing a rune requires a Craft check against a DC of 20 + the level of the spell used . The Craft skill you use is anything appropri- ate to the task of creating a written symbol on a surface (metal- working, calligraphy, gemcutting, stonecarving, woodcarving, and so on) . You paint, draw, or engrave the rune onto a surface and make the check . (Dwarves usually engrave their runes in stone or metal in order to take advantage of their racial affinity for these items .) If the check fails, the rune is imperfect and cannot hold the spell . The act of writing triggers the prepared spell, whether or not the Craft check is successful, making the spell unavailable for casting until you rest and regain spells . That is, the spell is expended from your currently prepared spells, just as if it had been cast . A single Medium-size or smaller object can hold only one rune . Larger objects can hold one rune per 2S square feet (an area S feet square) of surface area . Runes cannot be placed on creatures . The rune has a base price of the spell level x caster level x 100 gp (a 0- level spell counts as 1/2 level) . You must spend 1/2S of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing half this base price . A rune's market value equals its base price . TRIGGERING RUNES Whoever touches the rune triggers the rune and becomes the target of the spell placed in it . The rune's creator may touch the rune safely without triggering it, or deliberately trigger it if he so desires . (Runemakers often carry healing or restorative runes for just this purpose .) The rune itself must be touched in order to trigger it, so an object with a rune may be handled safely as long as care is taken to avoid contacting the rune . If the spell only affects objects, then an object must trigger the rune . As with a symbol spell, a rune cannot be placed upon a weapon with the intent of having the rune triggered when the weapon strikes a foe . Unlike the spell glyph of warding, the rune spell is not concealed in any way and is obvious to anyone inspecting the object holding the rune . A read magic spell allows the caster to identify the spell held in a rune with a successful Spellcraft check (DC 1S + the spell's level) . DISARMING RUNES Runes can be disarmed or deactivated in several ways . A successful erase spell deactivates a rune (DC 1S + your caster level) . Touching the rune to erase it does not trigger the rune unless the erase spell fails to deactivate the rune . A dispel magic spell targeted on an untriggered rune can dispel its magic if successful (DC 11 + your caster level) . Untriggered runes are not subject to area dispels . Finally, a rogue can use her Disable Device skill to disable runes (DC 2f + the spell's level), like any magic trap ."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Circle Magic Some of the most powerful and spectacular spells worked across Faerun are cast in the form of circle magic . Circle magic is a type of cooperative spellcasting that allows the spellcaster leading the circle to increase her caster level significantly and achieve results otherwise unavailable to the spellcasters composing the circle . The Red Wizards of Thay and the Witches of Rashemen make frequent use of circle magic . Stories of other forms of circle magic abound in Faerun . PARTICIPATION The ability to participate in circle magic requires the selection of a character feat-Tattoo Focus for a Red Wizard or Ethran for a Witch of Rashemen . One spellcaster, usually the most powerful or experienced charac- ter present, stands at the center of the circle . This character is the circle leader . A hathran must be at least 4th level in the hathran prestige class to be a circle leader . A Red Wizard cannot be a circle leader unless he is at least a 5th-level Red Wizard . \t , A circle requires a minimum of two participants plus the circle leader . Up to five participants can aid a circle leader in a standard circle, but a Red Wizard of 10th level can lead a great circle con- taining up to nine participants . All participants in a circle must stand within 10 feet of the circle leader, who stands in the center . CIRCLE POWERS The first use of circle magic is to empower the circle leader with the strength of all the participants . This requires 1 full hour of unin- terrupted concentration on the part of all participants and the circle leader . Each participant casts any single prepared spell, which is con- sumed by the circle and has no effect other than expending the pre- pared spell . The spell levels expended by the circle participants are totaled as circle bonus levels . Each bonus level may be used to accomplish the following effects : Increase the circle leader's caster level by one for every bonus level expended (maximum caster level 40th) . Add Empower Spell, Maximize Spell, or Heighten Spell metam- agic feats to spells currently prepared by the circle leader . Each bonus level counts as one additional spell level required by the application of a metamagic feat to a spell . The circle leader may add the feats listed to a spell even if he does not know the feat or if the addition of the feat would raise the spell level past the cir- cle leader's normal maximum spell level (maximum spell level 20th) . \" Increase the circle leader's level by one for level checks (dispel checks, caster level checks, and so on) for every bonus level expended (maximum level 40th) . These effects last for -24 hours or until expended . Circle bonus levels may be divided up as the circle leader sees fit . For example, the Red Wizard Hauth Var leads a circle in which four participants each cast 2nd-level spells . Hauth Var chooses to use three circle bonus levels to maximize his cone of cold spell, three to increase his caster level from 10th to 13th level for all level-based variables in his spells, and two to add a +2 bonus to any level checks he needs to make . The maximized spell is used up whenever he casts his cone of cold, and the other two effects remain for the next 24 hours . Many high-level Red Wizards lead circles on a daily basis to exact magical power from their apprentices . MAGIC 59 p ortals Magic portals link many places across Toril . A portal is simply a per- manent teleportation effect that safely whisks its user to a prede- termined place . Most portals lead from one place on Toril to another, but a few lead to other planes or other celestial bodies in the skies of Toril . Qualities of portals Hundreds of archmages, high priests, secret circles, monstrous races, and dark cabals had a hand in creating the multitude of hidden door- ways riddling Faerun . Magic of this sort is unusually durable, and often survives for centuries-or millennia-after its creators have vanished . into history or lost any use for their handiwork . Accord- ingly, the workings of portals are mysterious and unpredictable . Each one is built for a reason, but all too often these reasons are lost when the creator passes into history or obscurity . Portals share some common features and qualities . All portals are two-dimensional areas, usually a circle with a radius of up to 15 f eet, but sometimes square, rectangular, or another shape . The portal itself is intangible and invisible . Portals often come in pairs or networks . A single portal is a one- way trip . There must be a matching portal at the destination to return . Some portals are attuned to several potential destinations, each equipped with a matching portal, but most are simply two-way doors between one point and another far distant . Once created, a portal cannot be moved . DETECTING PORTALS An archway or frame of some kind usually marks a portal's location so it can be found when needed and so that creatures don't blunder into it acci- dentally . Detect magic can reveal a portal's magical aura . If the portal is currently functioning (ready to transport creatures it has a strong aura . If the portal is not currently able to transport creatures (usually because it has a limited number of uses, and they are currently exhausted it has a weak aura Strong or weak, a portal radiates transmutation magic . The analyze portal spell can reveal even more about a portal . PORTAL OPERATION Creatures who touch or pass through the area of the portal are instantly teleported to the locale the portal's builder has specified . (The teleportation effect is similar to teleport without error cast by a 17th-level caster, except that interplanar travel is possible .) It is not possible to poke one's head through a portal to see what's on the other side . A portal can only transport creatures that can fit through the portal's physical dimensions . If a solid object blocks the destination, the portal does not func- tion . Creatures, however, do not block portals . If a creature already occupies the area where a portal leads, the user is instead transport- ed to a suitable location as close as possible to the original destina- tion . A suitable location has a \" surface strong enough to support the user and enough space to hold the user . Unattended objects cannot pass though a portal . Fpr example, a character can carry any number or arrows through a portal,' but he cannot fire an arrow through a portal . An unattended object that hits a portal simply bounces off . Unless the builder has preset some limit, any number of creatures can pass through a portal each round . A creature using a portal can take along up to 850 pounds of gear . In this case, gear is anything a creature carries or touches . If two or more creatures touch the same piece of equipment, it counts against both creatures' weight limits . t ."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MAGIC KEYED PORTALS Portal builders often restrict access to their creations by setting condi- tions for their use . Special conditions for triggering a portal can be based on the possession of a portal key, the creature's name, identity, or align- ment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities . Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify . A keyed portal remains active for 1 full round . Any creature who touches the activated portal in the same round also can use the portal, even if such creatures don't have a key themselves . Many portal keys are rare and unusual objects that the creature using the portal must carry . Some portals are keyed to work only - at a particular time, such as sunrise, sunset, the full moon, or midnight . Spells can serve as portal keys, as can the channeling of positive or negative energy . When the portal is the target of the specified spell or within the spell's area or touched by its effect, the spell is absorbed and the portal is activated . Any form of the spell works to activate the portal, including spell-like effects of creatures or magic items and spells from scrolls . SEALING PORTALS - A portal cannot be destroyed by physical means or by spell effects that destroy objects (such as disintegrate) . A successful targeted dispel magic (DC 27) causes a portal to become nonfunctional for 1d4 rounds . Mor- denkainen's disjunction destroys a portal unless it makes a Will save (a portal's Will save bonus is +10) . The spell gate seal (described later in this chapter) locks a portal and prevents its operation . Unusual portals Things are never certain in the many lands of Faerûn, and portals are not always entirely reliable . Portal-makers have created through design or mischance portals with many insidious and dangerous characteristics . This active portal gives a glimpse of what awaits on the other side . 6o RANDOM PORTALS These portals can only be activated at random times . They may or may not require a key for activation when they are working . A fairly common random pattern is a portal that works until 1d6+6 creatures use it, then shuts down for 1d6 days . Other patterns are possible . VARIABLE PORTALS These portals are hazardous in the extreme for those who are unfa- miliar with their quirks . Creatures using these portals are transport- ed to any one of several preset locations . The destination sequence may follow a set pattern or may be random . Some variable portals have keys that allow users to choose a spe- cific destination served by the portal . Others function by transport- ing users to a default location-an inescapable dungeon, the innards of a volcano, or some particularly hostile outer plane-unless the user presents the proper key . CREATURE-ONLY PORTALS These portals transport only the creatures that use them, not the creatures' clothing and equipment . Such portals are often used defen- sively to render intruders vulnerable after they use the portals . A rare and more difficult variation on this type of portal transports creatures to one area and their equipment to another . MALFUNCTIONING PORTALS The other types of unusual portals are generally created through careful effort by their makers . Malfunctioning portals, on the other hand, are almost always unintended . Over the centuries, prodigious forces have swept over Toril, pro- foundly affecting magic . Because of decades (or centuries or millen-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"nia) of magical wear and tear or the strength of the cataclysmic forces to which they have been e xposed, many ancient dweomers have gone slowly awry . Portals are no exception . \t - A malfunctioning portal is usually at least one hundred years old, but many are far older . Using one can have many different results . Roll once on Table 2-2 : Portal Malfunction each time a malfunc- tioning portal is activated . If such a portal functions continuously, the effect indicated lasts 1d10 rounds, and anyone using the portal during that time is subject to that effect . TABLE 2-2 : PORTAL MALFUNCTION d96 \t Effect 01-05 \t The portal does not function, but draws magical power from the user in an attempt to power itself . The user is affected as though struck by a targeted dispel effect of a greater dispelling spell cast at 17th level . 06-10 \t The portal does not function, but draws magical power from the user's items in an attempt to power itself . A random number of items (1d10) are struck by an effect similar to a targeted greater dispelling cast at 17th level . Use Table 10-1 : Items Affected by Magical Attacks, page 150 of the Player's Han dbook, to determine wh ich items are affected . Successful dispelling suppresses permanent magic items for 1d4 rounds . Charged or limited-use items lose 1d4 charges or uses as if they had been used to no effect and are suppressed for the same number of rounds (if still magical) . 11-20 \t The portal does not function . The user is hurled away as though struck by the violent thrust of a telekinesis spell cast at 17th level . The user is entitled to a Will save (DC 17) to negate the effect and takes 1d6 points of damage if hurled against a solid surface . 21-25 \t The portal does not . function . Instead, a wave of negative (5O%) or positive energy (5O%) emanates from the portal in a 30-foot radius . Negative energy acts just like an inflict serious wounds spell cast at 17th level (3d8+15 points of damage, Will half DC 14) . Positive energy acts just like a cure serious wounds spell cast at 17th level . 26-40 \t The portal functions, but it sends the user to the wrong desti- nation . To determine where the user ends up, use the table in the teleport spell description (page 264 of the Player's Hand- book) and roll 1d20+80 as on the \"false destination\" line . 41-50 \t Nothing happens . The portal does not function . 51-100 \t The portal . functions normally . Building a portal Any character of at least 17th level can build a portal if she knows the Create Portal feat and either the teleportation circle or gate spell . The portal can lead to any locale the builder has personally visited at least once . The portal fails if the builder chooses a destination that cannot safely hold her (such as inside a solid object or into thin air) . The portal also fails if the destination is a locale where astral travel is blocked (see the teleport spell description) . Base Cost : The builder must spend 50,000 gp on raw materials to create a single, continuously active one-way portal covering an area up to 10 feet in radius (about 300 square feet) . The market value of a portal is twice its cost in raw materials . Crafting a portal requires one day for each 1,000 gp in its market price, and 1/25 of the market price in XP (one hundred days and 4,000 XP for the base portal) . The builder can create a second portal at the destination point, making a two-way portal, for half price (25,000 gp, fifty days, 2,000 XP} Larger and Smaller Portals : A portal can be crafted as small as 1 square . foot (about a 6-inch radius), but this does not reduce the cost . The smallest portal usable by a Medium-size creature is 12 square feet MAGIC (roughly a 2-foot radius) . Small creatures can use portals as small as 7 square feet (an 18-inch radius), and Tiny creatures can pass through portals of 2 square feet (a 10-inch radius) . Diminutive and Fine crea- tures are the only beings who can pass through portals of 1 square foot . Larger portals add 100% to the base cost for each extra 300 square feet of area or fraction of 300 square feet . Large and Huge creatures can pass through a standard portal, but Gargantuan and Colossal creatures generally need double- or triple-sized portals . Special Properties : Some special properties .add significantly to the cost of creating a portal . Keyed Portals : Keyed portals may be created at no extra cost . The key must be designated during the creation of the device and cannot be changed after that . Random Portals : Random portals may be created at no extra cost . The conditions must be designated during the creation of the portal and cannot be later changed . Variable Portals : Variable portals add 25% to the base price per extra destination after the first included in the device . For example, a continuously active portal with two variable destinations costs 62,500 gp to make . A continuously active portal with three variable destinations costs 75,000 gp to make . Creature-Only Portals : Creature-only portals cost twice as much to make as standard portals . If the portal sends intruders' belongings to some place different from the users' destination, it is considered a variable portal with one extra destination . Limited Use : The prices and construction times noted above are for portals that operate constantly, transporting anyone who passes through them at any time . If the portal can be used only four times per day or less, the base costs are reduced . The materials and XP cost of a limited-use portal are based on the number of uses available . The materials cost is 10,000 gp x a portal' s uses per day, and the experience point cost is 800 XP X a portals uses per day . (The second portal in a two-way pair costs half this amount .) The market value is twice the materials cost . The construction time is one day per 1,000 gp of market value . A portal usable five times per day or more is just as expensive as a continuously active portal . Portals usable less than once per day can be created by using the appropriate fraction . For example, a portal usable once per four days effectively has 1/4 a use per day, costs 2,500 gp in materials, and 200 XP . The minimum cost of a limited-use portal is 1,000 gp and 80 XP for a portal usable once per ten days . (The portal builder can choose to have a portal operate even less often-once a year, for instance-but this does not reduce the cost or XP expenditure any further .) Each activation of a limited-use portal lasts 1 round . Once acti- vated, a limited-use portal can transport as many creatures as can touch it that round . sp ells of Faerûn Almost every faith of Faerûn harbors secret divine spells, prayers and invocations known only to the initiated clergy . Hundreds of reclusive wizards and sinister circles devise new arcane spells, seek- ing a purer understanding of the Art or a simple weapon other spell- casters lack . The temples of fallen deities and the ruins of ancient cities hold scrolls of powerful and dangerous spells, forgotten by the lesser clerics and wizards who populate Faerun today . The spells and domains described in the Player's Handbook form the common knowledge of Faerûn's bards, clerics, druids, paladins, rangers, sorcerers, and wizards . Any character may acquire these spells in the . usual fashion . The domains and spells described here represent the secrets and special knowledge available to certain groups and individuals, plus a few Faerûnian spells that have become common parlance among the land's spellcasters . t ."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"cleric Domains In addition to the domains described in the Player's Handbook, var- ious deities of Faerûn permit clerics to choose from the additional domains presented here .

If you study an area for 1 round, you know the sizes and locations of any portals in the area . Once you find a portal, you can study it . (If you find more than one portal, you can only study one at a time .) Each round you study a portal, you can discover one property of the portal, in this order : any key or command word needed to acti- vate the portal, any special circumstances governing the portal's use (such as specific times when the portal can be activated), whether the portal is one-way or two-way, any of the usual properties listed in the Building a Portal section earlier in this chapter, and finally, a glimpse of the area where the portal leads . You can look at the area where the portal leads for 1 round . Analyze portal does not allow other divination spells to extend through the portal . For example, you cannot also use detect magic or detect evil to study the area where the portal leads while viewing the area with analyze portal . For each property, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 17 . If fail, you can try again the next round . Analyze portal has only a limited ability to reveal unusual properties of portals, as follows : Random Portals : The spell reveals only that the portal is random ; and whether it can be activated now . It does not reveal when the portal starts or stops functioning . 1 Message 6 True seeing 2 Gembomb 7 Mordenkainen's magnificent 3 Eagle's splendor mansion 4 Sending 8 Mind blank 5 Fabricate 9 Discern location Undeath Domain Spells 1 Detect undead 6 Create undead 2 Desecrate 7 Control undead Animate dead 8 Create greater undead 4 Death ward 9 Energy drain 5 Circle of doom"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Variable Portals : The spell reveals only that the portal is variable . If the caster studies the portal's destination, the spell reveals only the destination to which the portal is currently set . Creature Only Portals : The spell reveals this property . If the cast- er studies the portal's destination, the spell reveals where the por- tal sends creatures . If it is the type of portal that sends creatures one place and their equipment another place, the spell does not reveal where the equipment goes . Malfunctioning Portals : The spell reveals only that the portal is malfunctioning, not what sort of malfunction the portal produces . Arcane Material Components : A crystal lens and a small mirror . ANYSPELL Transmutation Level : Spell 3 Components : V, S, DF (and pos- sibly M, F, and XP) Casting Time : 15 minutes Range : Personal Target : You Duration : Instantaneous Anyspell allows you to read and prepare any arcane spell of up to 2nd level . You must have an arcane magical writing (a scroll or spellbook) on hand to cast anyspell During the spell's 1S- minute casting time, you can scan the spells available and choose one to read and prepare . Once you choose and prepare an arcane spell, you retain it in your mind . The prepared spell occupies your 3rd-level domain spell slot . If you read the spell from a spellbook, the book is unharmed, but reading a spell from a scroll erases the spell from the scroll . When you cast the arcane spell, it works just as though cast by a wizard of your cleric level except that your Wisdom score sets the save DC (if applicable) . You must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the . arcane spell's level to prepare and cast it . Your holy symbol substitutes for any noncostly material component . If the spell has a costly material component (one to which a gold piece value is assigned), you must provide it . If the spell has another focus, you must provide the focus . If the spell has an XP component, you must pay the experience point cost .

The shroud can, if the caster desires, conceal the wearer's features . In any case, it grants the subject a +3 deflection bonus to Armor Class plus an additional +1 for every four caster levels (max- imum bonus +8) . The subject can see through the armor as if it did not exist and is also afforded darkvision with a range of 60 feet . Finally, the subject gains a +2 saving throw bonus against any holy, good, or light spells or effects . Undead creatures that are subjects of armor of darkness also gain +4 turn resistance . You create an area of total dark- ness . The darkness is impenetrable to normal vision and darkvision, but you can see normally within the blacklit area . Creatures outside the spell's area, even you, cannot see through it . You can cast the spel on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless you cast it cast on a mobile object . You can cast the spell on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves . Unattended objects and points in space do not get saving throws or benefit from spell resistance . Blacklight counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level, such as daylight . The 3rd-level cleric spell daylight counters or dispels blacklight . Material Component : A piece of coal and the dried eyeball of any creature . d .

Starting on your next action, you may use the- claws to make unarmed attacks as if they were natural weapons . (You attack"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"with one claw and can use the other claw for an off-hand attack . If you have multiple attacks you use them normally when attacking with the claws .) Attacks with the claws are melee touch attacks . Each claw deals 1d4 points of cold damage . If you grapple an opponent, you deal claw . damage with each successful grapple check, and the grappled target is under the effect of a slow spell for as long as you maintain the grapple unless the opponent makes a Fortitude save . You can extend the claws up to 6 feet, which gives you natural reach of 10 feet, or retract them as a free action . When the spell is in effect, you may not cast spells with anything other than verbal components, nor may you carry items with your hands . Any magic items worn on your hands are temporarily absorbed and cease functioning while the spell is active . CLOAK OF DARK POWER Abjuration Level : Drow 1 Components : V, S Casting Time : 1 action Range : Touch Target : Creature touched Duration : 1 minute/level Saving Throw : Will negates (harmless) Spell Resistance : Yes (harmless) Cloak of dark power creates a dusky haze around the subject .

The subject also gains a +4 resistance bonus on saves against light or darkness spells or effects .

The caster deter- mines the exact type of tattoo, though the selection of possible tat- toos is limited by caster level . The caster of create magic tattoo must have a modicum of artistic talent to sketch the desired tattoo-at least one rank of Craft (drawing), Craft (painting), Craft (calligra- phy), or a similar Craft skill . Inscribing a magic tattoo requires a Craft check . The DC varies with the kind of tattoo, as noted below . A caster o£ 3rd to 6th level can inscribe the following tattoos (DC 10) : \" +2 resistance bonus on one type of saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will) . \" +1 luck bonus on attack rolls . \" +1 deflection bonus to AC . A caster of 7th to 12th levels can inscribe the lower-level tattoos, plus the following (DC 15) : \t MAGIC \" +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws . \" +2 competence bonus on attack rolls . ' The ability to recall one cast 0-level, 1st-level, or 2nd-level spell (just as though the subject were using a pearl ofpower) . The cast- er chooses the spell level . A wizard of 13th level or higher can inscribe all of the above tat- toos plus the following (DC 20) : \" Spell resistance of 10 + 1 per six caster levels . \" +2 enhancement bonus to any one ability score . \" +1 level of casting ability . This increases the subject's effective level, but not the total number of spells . An 11th-level wizard raised in casting ability in this manner casts spells as a 12th-level wizard in terms of range, area, effect, and so on, but this tattoo does not provide any extra spells . A single creature can have only three magic tattoos at a time . Once a creature has three magic tattoos operating, any additional magic tattoos fail . A successful erase spell removes a single magic tattoo . A success- ful dispel magic spell can remove multiple magic tattoos if targeted on the creature bearing the tattoos (see the dispel magic spell in the Player's Handbook) . Material Components : Tattoo inks in appropriate colors . Focus : Tattoo needles .

You can hurl all the bolts at once, or you can hurl one bolt per round as a free action, starting on the round when you cast the spell . You do not have to hurl a bolt every round, but if you don't hurl the bolt you were entitled to that round, it is lost . If you hurl all the bolts at once, all your targets must be within 60 feet of each other . A darkbolt deals 2d8 points of damage to a living creature, and the creature is dazed for 1 round unless it makes a Will save (a crea- ture struck by multiple-bolts during the same round is dazed for a maximum of 1 round, no matter how many times it fails its save) . Undead take no damage, but are dazed if they fail their saves . EAGLE'S SPLENDOR Transmutation Level : Brd 2, Hrp 2, Sor/Wiz 2, Trade 3 Components : V, S, M/DF Casting Time : 1 action Range : Touch Target : Creature touched Duration : 1 hour/level Saving Throw : Will negates (harmless) Spell Resistance : Yes (harmless)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The transmuted creature becomes more poised, articulate, and per- sonally forceful .

Sorcerers and bards who receive eagle's splendor do not gain extra spells, but the save DCs for their spells increase . Arcane Material Component : A few feathers or' a pinch of dung from an eagle . Illusion (Shadow) Level : Craft 6, Gnome 6 Components : V, S, DF Casting Time : 1 action ELMINSTER'S EVASION Evocation Level : Sor/Wiz 9 Components : V, S, M, F, XP Casting Time : At least 10 minutes (see text) Range : Personal Target : You Duration : Until discharged This powerful variant of the contingency spell automatically transfers you and everything you carry or touch (except for other creatures or objects that weigh more than 50 pounds) to a locale you name . When casting Elminster's evasion, you must specify the locale and detail up to six specific conditions that trigger the spell . When any of these situations occurs, your body, mind, and soul are whisked away to the location . The location can be any place you have visit- ed, even on another plane . Also when casting the spell, you cast tele- port without error and one or two other spells that are to take effect when you arrive at your destination . The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for all castings . If the companion spells have combined casting times longer than 10 minutes, use the combined casting times instead . The teleport without error spell whisks you through the Astral Plane to your destination, so anything that pre- vents astral travel also foils Elminster's evasion . The spells to be brought into effect by the evasion must be ones that affect your person (feather fall, levitate, fly, telepor , and so on) and be of a spell level no higher than one-third of your caster level (maximum 6th level) . The conditions you specify to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general (see the contingency spell, page 187 of the Player's Handbook) . . The spell pulls together your mind, body, and soul if they have been separated . For example, if your soul is trapped in a magic jar when the evasion is triggered, your soul returns to your body . (This breaks the magic jar- spell .) If your body or soul has been magically trapped (for example with a binding, imprisonment, or trap the soul spell), you must succeed at a caster level check (DC 11 + the caster level of the person who cast the trapping spell) . If you succeed, the trapping spell is broken and the evasion works . If you fail, the eva- sion fails . If you're dead when you arrive at your destination, your soul immediately departs just as though you died at your destination . Material Components : Those of the companion spells, plus quick- silver ; an eyelash of an ogre mage, ki-rin, or similar spell-using crea- ture ; and some of your own blood, freshly drawn . Drawing the blood deals 1d4 points of temporary Constitution damage . Focus : A statuette of you carved from ivory and decorated with gems (worth at least 1,500 gp) . You must carry the focus for the evasion to function . XP Cost : 5,000 XP .

You can order the machine to per- form the same task over and over, but you can't change the task . You must specify the task when you cast the spell . The machine always acts on your turn in the initiative order . (It can act during the turn you cast the spell .) \t The machine functions as a Large (tall) animated object (see page 17 of the Monster Manual) . It trundles over the ground at a speed of 40 feet . It can swim or fly at a speed of 10 feet (clumsy maneu- verability) . It has 22 hit points, an Armor Class of 14 (-1 size, +5 natural), and a hardness of 10 . Its saving throw bonuses . are Forti- tude +1, Reflex +1, Will -4 . A light load for the machine is up to 230 pounds, a heavy load is 231-460 pounds, and a heavy load is 461-700 pounds .

It can excavate 7,000 pounds of loose rock each minute (which is sufficient to clear a 5-by- 5-by-5-foot space in 3 rounds) . It can excavate sand or loose soil at twice that rate . The machine has an attack bonus of +5 and can make one slam attack each round that deals 1d8+4 points of damage . It deals triple slam damage (3d8+12) against stone or metal . The machine can hurl Small rocks (if any are at hand) with an attack bonus of +3 . Its range increment is 150 feet, and it can throw a rock up to 10 range incre- ments .

FIRE STRIDE Transmutation [Teleportation] Level : Sor/Wiz 4 Components : V, S Casting Time : 1 action Range : Personal Target : You Duration : 10 minutes/level or until expended (see text) You gain the ability to step into fires and move from fire to fire . The fires you enter and move between must be at least as big around as you are . Fire elementals and other fire creatures are not \"fires\" for purposes offire stride, nor are sources of great heat such as pools of lava . Once in a fire, you can transport yourself to any other suffi- ciently large fire within long range (400 ft . + 40 ft ./level), and you instantly know the locations of all suitable fires within range . Each transport counts as a full move action . With each casting of the spell, you can transport yourself one time per caster level . If a fire's location doesn't offer enough space for you (for example, a fire con- tained inside a furnace too small to hold you or a fire already occu- pied by a big cauldron), it is not a viable destination and you don't sense its location . If a fire rests on a surface that can't support you, it is still a viable destination and you suffer the appropriate conse- quences if you transport yourself to it . For example, if you trans- port yourself into a fire burning in a pit full of oil, you fall into the oil when you arrive there . The spell provides no protection against fire, so it is advisable to obtain such protection before using the spell ."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"FLASHBURST Evocation [Fire] Level : Hth 3, Sor/Wiz 3 Components : V, S, M/DF Casting Time : 1 action Range : Long (400 ft . + 40 ft ./level) Area : A 20-ft .-radius burst Duration : Instantaneous (see text) Saving Throw : Will partial Spell Resistance : Yes Flashburst creates a blinding, dazzling flash of light .

You must hold the . gems in your hand when cast- ing the spell . Together, the bombs are capable of dealing 1d8 points of force damage per two caster levels (maximum of 5d8), divided up among the gems as you wish . A 10th-level cleric could create one 5d8 bomb, a 3d8 and 2d8 bomb, five 1d8 bombs, or any combination of five dice of damage and up to five gems . You can toss the bombs up to 100 feet with a range increment of20 feet . A ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the intended target . A gembomb blasts its target with a rainbow-colored shower of magical force . A creature struck by a gembomb can attempt a Reflex save for half damage . Tossing a single gembomb counts as an attack for you, so you usu- ally cannot toss a bomb during the turn that you cast the spell .

You can attack with the skull on the round you cast the spell, but other- wise it is a standard action . If the skull or bone hits the target, the gray radiance is transferred from the skull to the creature, covering , it entirely . For the duration of the spell, the creature cannot regain hit points or ability score points by any means . Nor can the creature remove negative levels . Natural regeneration (such as that of trolls) is stopped, as are the effects of a ring of regenera- tion, potion of healing, or . staff of curing . Spells that return lost hit points (cure light wounds, heal) do not work on that individual . Other necromantic spells function normally, including those that cure other afflic- tions (disease, blindness) . Those that remove hit points (cause light wounds) are unaffected by the spell . The subject can improve his cur- tent hit points by boosting his Constitution score and can receive temporary hit points (from an aid spell, for example) . Upon the expiration of the spell, automatic healing abilities and items such as a ring of regener- ation or a troll's regeneration ability begin to function again . Material Component . The skull or bone used .

Metal items (including metal weapons) simply pass through you, and you can walk through metal barriers such as iron bars . Magic metal affects you normally, as do spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatu- ral effects . Attacks delivered by metal items (such as poison on a dagger) affect you normally . If the spell expires while metal is inside you, the metal object is shunted out of your body (or you away from the metal, if it is an immovable object such as a set of iron bars) . You and the object each take 1d6 points of damage as a result (ignoring the object's hardness for determining damage to it) . Because you pass through metal, you may ignore armor bonuses from metal armor on opponents you attack with unarmed attacks . Material Component . A tiny shield of wood, glass, or crystal . MAELSTROM Conjuration (Creation) Level : Ocean 8 Components : V, S, DF Casting Time : 1 full round Range : Long (400 ft . + 40 ft ./level) Effect : A whirlpool 120 ft . wide and 60 ft . deep Duration : 1 round/level Saving Throw : Reflex negates (and see text) Spell Resistance : No Maelstrom causes a deadly vortex to form in water . A body of water at least 120 feet wide and 60 feet deep must be present, or the spell is wasted . Waterborne creatures or objects within 5O feet of the vortex (below and on all sides) must make successful Reflex saves or be sucked in . Trained swimmers can attempt Swim checks instead if their skill modifier is higher than their Reflex save bonus . Water- borne vessels avoid being sucked in if their operators make Profes- sion (sailor) checks against the same DC as the spell's saving throw . These creatures take 3d8 points of damage upon being sucked in . Once inside, creatures and objects take 3d8 points of battering damage each round . They remain trapped for 2d4 rounds . Subjects of Large or smaller size are ejected from the bottom of the vortex . Larger subjects are ejected from the top . MAW OF STONE Transmutation Level : Cavern 7 Components : V, S, DF Casting Time . 1 action Range : Close (25 ft . + 5 ft ./2 levels) Effect : One cave mouth or natural chamber up to 15 ft . high and wide Duration : 10 minutes/level (D) Saving Throw : None Spell Resistance : No You cause a single natural opening or natural chamber to become animated . The opening or chamber cannot move, but it can attack . You can order it to attack any creature, or a specific type of crea- ture . You also can order it to attack under a specific circumstance, such as when creatures try to leave or when they touch something . An animated opening can only attack creatures that try to move through it . An animated chamber can attack every creature inside . Only one maw of stone can be in effect on a particular opening or chamber at a time . The animated opening or chamber has a Strength score of 30 and an attack bonus equal to your level + your Wisdom modifier + 7 for its Strength . If it has any single dimension (height, length, or MAGIC width) of 8 feet or more, it has a -1 size penalty on attack rolls for being Large . An animated opening can make one grapple attack each round against a creature passing through . If it succeeds with its grab attempt, it makes a grapple check and deals 2d6+10 points of normal damage with a successful hold .

Effect : A swordlike beam Duration : 1 minute/level (D) Saving Throw : None Spell Resistance : Yes MOON BLADE A 3-foot-long, blazing beam, of moonlight springs forth from your hand . Anyone who can cast moon blade can wield the beam with profi- ciency . However, if you are proficient with any type of sword, you can wield the beam as if it were any type of sword and thus gain the bene- fits of any special sword skill you might have, such as Weapon Focus . Attacks with the moon blade are melee touch attacks . Its strike saps vitality or life force, causing no visible wounds but dealing 1d8 points of damage plus 1 point per two caster levels (to a max- imum of +15) to any type of creature except undead . Undead are visibly wounded by a moon blade . Their substance boils away from its touch, and they take 2d8 points of damage plus 1 point per caster level (to a maximum of +30) per blow . The blade is imma- terial, and your Strength- modifier does not apply to the damage . A successful moon blade strike temporarily scrambles magic . On the target's next turn after a hit from a moon blade, the creature must make a Concentration check to use any spell or spell-like abil- ity . The DC is 10 + points of damage dealt + spell level . (An oppo- nent hit by a moon blade while casting a spell must make the usual Concentration check to avoid ruining the spell in addition to the check on its next turn .) The moon blade spell has no connection with the magic items known as moonblades borne and made by some elves . Arcane Material Component : A small candy made with winter- green oil . MOON PATH Evocation [Force] Level : Hth 5, Moon 5 \t - Components : V, S, M/DF Casting Time : 1 action Range : Medium (100 ft . + 10 ft./level) Effect : A variable-width, glowing white stair or bridge of translu- cent force up to 15 ft ./level long-(see text) Duration : 1 minute/level (D) Saving Throw : None (see text) Spell Resistance : No Moon path allows you to create a stair or bridge from one spot to anoth- er .

(You can vary the width over the ribbon's length if you want .) It sticks to its endpoints unshakably, even if these endpoints are in midair . At the tinie of casting, you designate up to one creature per caster level to receive extra protection while standing on or moving along the moon path . Protected creatures gain the benefits of a sanctuary . This works exactly like the 1st-level spell sanctuary except that the save DC is 15 + your Wisdom modifier, and any subject of the spell who attacks breaks the sanctuary effect for all subjects . Protected creatures also stick to the top of the moon path as though they have received spider climb spells . A creature loses both benefits immediately when it leaves the path . Unlike a wall of force, a moon path can be dispelled . It is otherwise similar to a wall of force in that it needs no supports and it is immune to damage of all kinds . A disintegrate blasts a hole 10 feet square, leav- ing the rest of the path intact . (If the moon path is 10 feet wide or less, this merely creates a 10-foot gap .) A hit from a rod of cancella- tion, a sphere of annihilation, or Mordenkainen's disjunction destroys a moon path . Spells and breath weapons cannot pass through a moon path, although dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier . It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material creatures . Gaze attacks cannot operate through the'moon path . A moon path must be straight, continuous, and unbroken when formed . If its surface is broken by any object or creature, the spell fails .

On your turn each round, you can change the direction the cone points . Light from a moonbeam does not adversely affect creatures that are sensitive to light, but lycanthropes in humanoid form caught in the cone must make Will saves to avoid involuntarily assuming their animal forms . Lycanthropes in animal form can change out of it on their next turn (spending a round in animal form) . However, if they are still in the area of the spell, they must succeed at a Will save to do so . Once a lycanthrope successfully saves against moonbeam, it is not affected by any more of your moonbeam spells for 24 hours . Moonbeam penetrates any darkness spell of equal or lower level, but does not counter or dispel it . Darkness spells of higher level block a moonbeam . Arcane Material Component . A pinch of white powder . MOONFIRE Evocation [Light] Level : Moon 9 Components : V, S, DF Casting lime : 1 action Range : Close (25 ft . + S - ft ./2 levels) Area : Cone Duration : Instantaneous (see text) Saving Throw : Reflex half (see text) Spell Resistance : Yes MAGIC '73 A cone of fiery . white moonlight springs from your hand . Living creatures in the area feel an unnatural chill and take 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels, to a maximum of 10d8 . Undead and shapechangers take double damage . This application of the spell allows a Reflex save for half damage . All magical auras within the cone glow .with a faint blue light for 1 round per caster level . Disguised, shapechanged, or polymorphed creatures and objects in the spell's area at the time the spell is cast must make Will saves or immediately return to their normal forms . Even if the save succeeds, they remain covered in ghostly white out- lines that show their true forms for 1 round per caster level . The entire area covered by the cone glows silver white for 1 round per caster level . This radiance is as bright as the light of a full moon and negates electricity for 1 round per caster level unless the crea- ture generating it makes a caster level check against a DC equal to the caster's level . If an electricity effect is generated outside the glow- ing cone, the cone blocks the electricity effect if the caster level check fails . If an electricity effect is generated inside the glowing cone, the cone completely negates the electricity effect if the caster level check fails . SCATTERSPRAY Transmutation Level : Hrp 1, Hth 1, Sor/Wiz 1 Components : V, S Casting Time : 1 action \t ' Range : Close (25 ft . + 5 ft ./2 levels) Target : Six or more Diminutive or Fine objects, all within 1 ft, of each other, whose total weight does not exceed 25 lb . Duration : Instantaneous Saving Throw : None (see text) Spell Resistance : No You can point to a collection of little, unsecured items and cause them to fly off in all directions simultaneously .

You also gain a 50% chance each round to avoid having to make a saving throw against gaze attacks, . just as if you averted your eyes . If you avert your eyes while using shadow mask, you get to check twice to see if you avoid having to make the saving throw . When the spell's duration ends, the shadow mask fades over the course of 1d4 rounds (rather than immediately), giving you time to keep your face hidden via other means . A successful dispel magic"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"cast against a shadow mask effectively ends the spell and causes the same slow fading . Material Component . A mask of black cloth . SHADOW SPRAY .

The subject gains a +4 bonus to its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores . The subject retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change . i n Constitution score), alignment, base attack bonus, and base saves . (New Strength, Dexter- MAGIC ity, and Constitution scores may affect final Armor Class, attack, and save bonuses .) The subject's equipment remains and continues to function as long as it fits a drider's body shape . Otherwise it is sub- sumed into the new form and ceases to function for the duration of the spell . Retained items include anything worn on the upper body (head, neck, shoulders, hands, arms, and waisf) . Nonfunctioning items include anything worn on the legs, feet, or the whole body (armor, robes, vestments, and boots) . The subject's bite delivers a poison with a Fortitude save DC of 16 + your Wisdom bonus . Initial and secondary damage is 1d6 points of temporary Strength damage . Your control over the subject is like that provided by a dominate person spell . (You telepathically control the creature so long as it remains within range .) \t - Although spider curse is similar to polymorph other, it does not heal damage or cause disorientation .

Subjects remain in the spider form until the spell expires or you dismiss the 'spell for all subjects . In addition, an individual subject may choose to resume her normal form as a full-round action . Doing so ends the spell for her and her alone . Parts separated from the resulting spiders do not revert to their original forms, so the resulting spiders have poisonous bites . Creatures polymorphed by spider shapes don't suffer the disori- entation penalty that those transformed by polymorph other often do . Subjects of spider shapes regain hit points as though they had rested for a day . Transmutation Level : Drow 5 Components : V, S, DF Casting Time : 1 action Range : Personal Targets : You Duration : 1 hour/level (D) SPIDERFORM You can polymorph into a drider or Tiny, Small, Medium-size, or Large monstrous spider (see the Monster Manual) .

If the waterspout exceeds the spell's range, it collapses and the spell ends . The waterspout batters creatures and objects it touches, and it often sucks them up . Any creature or object that comes in contact with the waterspout must succeed at a Reflex save or take 3d8 points of damage . Medium-size or smaller creatures who fail their save are sucked into the spout and held suspended in its powerful currents, taking 2d6 points of damage each round with no save allowed . Trapped creatures remain inside for 1d3 rounds before the waterspout ejects them out the top of the spout, and they fall back to the surface (taking falling damage) 1d8X5 feet from the base of the waterspout . Waterborne creatures or objects within 10 feet of the spout (below and on all sides) also must make successful Reflex saves or be sucked into the spout if they are Medium-size or smaller .
