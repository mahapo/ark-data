[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"PART THREE LITURGY OF THE DRUIDS Introduction When I began to put together this collection of old liturgies, designed by various Reformed Druids at Carleton, I had many misgivings about publishing them. I was not disturbed be- cause they are secret or anything like that, since there are very few secrets (if any) in Reformed Druidism, but because they can be so easily misunderstood by someone not familiar with Reformed Druidism at Carleton College. If any terms confuse you, refer to Part Four of ARDA where I’m sure many of your questions will be answered. If there is any one section of the Anthology that I was considering dropping, it was this sec- tion, but that’s just my personal tendancy to downplay ritual. The Liturgy has an unusual place and role in Reformed Druidism, unlike that found in most other religions. Reformed Druidism began as a protest against enforced attendance and fixed liturgies as had been the case at the mandatory Carleton College Chapel service of the early 60s. It would be a very sad day when a fixed or forced liturgy were to become established in Reformed Druidism itself! There are several points about Reformed Druid liturgy that should be remembered: irregular attendance is acceptable (perhaps even desir able), it isn’t fixed in its final form and the existence of liturgy may even be antithetical to Reformed Druidism itself.

For many, the need to gather in a group for “formal” worship is an urge that only comes once in long time. One can have a great many religious moments outside of a group, perhaps even purer moments. Many a person would come to a Druid ritual and just sun-tan, ignoring the ritual in effect, being there just to be with the people. Attendance has no reflection on how “Druidic” you are. Nor is liturgical attendance the only way to be with other Druids. Over the years, both at Carleton and abroad at our missionary groves, there have been many other group activities that have developed that don’t use a standard liturgy (or even need a liturgy). Such activities include: sweatlodges, candle-making parties, bardic sing-a-longs, group- feasts, nature-walks, group meditation sessions, pseudo-theological debates, magic-working groups, book reading clubs, herbology and many other activities (depending on local talents that exist within the group). However, some groups just did the services 4 times a year and nothing else. The Liturgy isn’t fixed in its final form The Liturgy isn’t fixed in its final form The Liturgy isn’t fixed in its final form The Liturgy isn’t fixed in its final form The Liturgy isn’t fixed in its final form Even from the beginning, the liturgies have been constantly chang- ing. Although the Council of Dalon Ap Landu had voted that they: “adopt the Order of Worship of the Carleton Grove (as formulated by David H. Fisher) as the basic order of wor- ship of the Reformed Druids of West America.” this restriction has been stretched or ignored. Every priest is expected to change, adopt and mutate the liturgy to fit the existing mood, their religous sensibilities, and the specific purposes of the moment. Ad libbing and spontaneity, within reasonable bounds, is encouraged. As a result there are dozens and dozens of alternatives to every single ritual example that will be presented to you in this book. Many a person has added Wiccan elements or Cabalistic elements or Judeo-Christian elements, etc. The purpose of the liturgy is to bring people together, and if the majority of the people in the grove belong to one particular tradition you can add elements from that tradition (if you want to). However, the original version has been judged over the years to be relatively ecumenical enough and dogma- free to be acceptable to most people, so we recommend it when dealing with a “mixed” crowd. The Liturgy isn’t Sacrosanct There is no claim of divine origin for these liturgies, although a few writers may have felt a bit inspired when they wrote them. Sanc- tity is in the eye of the beholder, isn’t it? For many, the liturgy is merely a philosophical exposition by the Priest who is using deities in the Jungian sense of the archetype. For others, the liturgy is the direct invocation and worship of whatever deities are being invoked. For some it is merely being quiet together at someplace while some- one reads something outloud. For some, powerful magickal energies are conjured forth by the magickal words and the power is delegated to various tasks. For others, it’s a quaint little service that’s fun to attend. Let us respect the right of the beholder and individual congregant to have their own interpretation of the liturgy. The existence of the liturgy may even be antithetical Perhaps it was the Protestant streak in the early founders which made Reformed Druidism into the religion of the individual. The goal of Reformed Druidism, for many, is the never-ending search for religious truth; a truth which can be meaningful only to the particu- lar individual who grasps it. Words and gestures cannot communi- cate the subtleties that define our thoughts (little can, unless you have telepathy). Let us beware from ever taking the liturgy as the most effective way of expressing our religious thoughts! Who can say whether the individual with the title “Priest” has any better understanding of her/his religion than the young first-order Druid sitting near them? For all we know, the role/title of “Priest” within Reformed Druidism may be merely an “ego-stroke” of com- fort for those who feel the need to make sure that someone in the group holds a service every now and then. Although I have been a priest, for three years as of writing this, I don’t feel any more divine than the next guy. Organization of the this Book I have, appropriately, separated this collection into three catego- ries: 1. Reasonably generic rituals, which Isaac originally published in DC(E). 2. Interesting variants of the various seasonal rituals. 3. Rituals of infrequent usage, ordination and suggestions. I hope that you enjoy them. —Michael Scharding Day 31 of Geimredh, Year XXXIII of the Reform December 1st, 1995 c.e."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"97 TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Section One: The Generic Liturgies Detailed Orders of Common Worship (Summer & Winter versions) Ordination of Second Order Druids Ordination of First Order Druids Various Traditional Invocations Simple Orders of Common Worship (Summer & Winter Versions) Eight Special Orders of Worship for High Festivals Samhain Winter Solstice Oimelc Spring Equinox Beltane Summer Solstice Lughnasadh Fall Equinox Section Two: Alternative Versions Original Order of Worship: Summer Half of the Year Late 70s Berkeley Orders Of Worship (Summer and Winter Ver- sions) Samhain Version 1, 2, 3 Service at Winter Solstice A Call to Mother Nature Chant for Midwinter A meditation for Midwinter Alternative Version of the Midwinter Chant Oimelc Service of Worship #1, #2, #3 A Service for Beltane An Incantation for Midsummer #1, #2 A service for Lughnasadh A reading for Lughnasadh Fall Equinox, Carleton 1987 Section Three: Strange and Rarely Used Stuff Strange and Rarely Used Stuff Strange and Rarely Used Stuff Strange and Rarely Used Stuff Strange and Rarely Used Stuff Irish Order of Worship (Summer and Fall) Irish Order of Worship (Winter and Spring) Irish Ordination of Second Order Druids Mayday, Season Surpassing!

There is a general custom which can be elabo- rated upon as the Priest sees fit. Usually the Priest will ask for aspirants to the First Order as the waters are about to be passed around. The Priest will go to the aspir- ant and ask if the aspirant believes in the two Basic Tenets of Re- formed Druidism: 1. The object of the search for religious truth, which is universal and a never-ending search, may be found through the Earth- Mother, which is Nature; but this is one way, yea, one way among many. 2. And great is the importance, which is of a spiritual important, of Nature, which is the Earth-Mother; for it is one of the objects of Creation, and with it do people live, yea, even as they do struggle through life are they come face-to-face with it. If the aspirant replies affirmatively, the Priest takes the chalice and dips their fingers in the Waters and draws the Druid Sigil on the forehead of the aspirant. Then the aspirant drinks some of the Wa- ters. The Priest then declares them to be a First Order Druid. If there are several aspirants, say a dozen, instead of going through each separately, they may be ordained as a group with separate head- annoitings. Another custom has developed at Carleton of anyone of the first or second orders being able to ordain another person into their own orders, in the absence of an existing Priest.

All Third Order Druids and Druidesses, including the Grove’s Archdruid/ess, should be wearing their red ribbons-of-office around their necks at the begin- ning of the service, but carry their white ribbons-of-office in an easily accessible place. The service starts with all participants standing some distance away from the area where the ritual is to take place. If both safe and legal, a fire should be started in or near the altar. The Druid/ess who is presiding (usually, though not always, the Grove’s Arch-Druid/ess) should already have cut the sacrifice and have it tucked into his or her robe (or it may be held in one hand). The presiding Druid/ess may choose to speak the opening Invocation to Be’al alone, or may ask the Preceptor and/or the people (depending on Local grove cus- tom) to join in speaking the bold words of the Invocation. .

The Druid/ess who is presiding (usually, though not always, the Grove’s Arch-Druid/ess) should already have cut the sacrifice and have it tucked into his or her robe (or it may be held in one hand). The presiding Druid/ess may choose to speak the opening Invocation to Be’al alone, or may ask the Preceptor and/or the people (depending on Local grove cus- tom) to join in speaking the bold words of the Invocation.

But it is only a tool to feel forces and create energy. Anyone is free to speak a prayer. Do any gestures anytime, to add to what Jan and I say or just to interrupt to ask a question.

To celebrate the wonder of nature. To think of any sunset any, any rock, any river whose beauty and symbolic power have ex- isted in your past. Feel the force of those experiences with nature and let it become a force to help build and sustain you. The force of nature is represented to us here in this fire. We’re here to celebrate and feel the power of a group. There is true power in a circle. Circle is unbroken, is continuous. We are all equal here and able to send energy in a complete way to each other in this unbroken circle. We are not in rows or in single file and I am not speaking to you from a pulpit, but from within the circle. An essential force of this circle is human love. Without love, support, understanding, and giving our ritual here though and our existence here at Carleton would be empty. Let us keep this always in mind in our daily lives and during our ritual that love and support is essential to our humanness and to our survival. We are here to celebrate not just the nature outside of us, but also the nature within us. We all have tremendous forces and power which are not let out in daily life. They are physical forces of motion, we find them in dance and making love. They are mystical forces of intrigue, we find them in deep, searching eyes, in beautiful faces. They are our natural feelings of power, of helplessness. We all have tremendous psychic powers of change and tremendous helplessness and vulnerability and we have to admit this. In the same vein let us not idolize one thing over another. Rather let us celebrate the unique beauty of each season; weather, tree, moun- tain, and mood. This extends to religion. To regard each religion as unique and wonderful in its own right. Especially to practice toler- ance, tolerance of all peoples, all objects, all religions. We are also here to celebrate the masculine and feminine natures of the universe to recognize their dual presence in each of us, their cosmic interplay, their equality and interconnectedness. To think of the ying and the yang. Finally, we are here to celebrate the cycles of life. To celebrate the circle in all we see, the cycles of seasons, the cycles of childhood, youth and old age, and to celebrate each in its own right.

O Belenos, hear us as we praise thee in thy returning. O Earth-Mother, wake and hear our prayers; cleanse our minds and hearts and prepare us for meditation. Procession (Circle is omitted) Here may be lighted a fire if one is desired . The Sacrifice Our praise has mounted up to thee on the wings of eagles, our voices have been carried up to thee on the shoulders of the winds. Wake now, and hear, we pray thee, our Mother, as we offer up this sacrifice of life that is to come. Accept it, we pray thee, and cleanse our hearts granting us peace and renewed life. (Here shall be offered up a branch of evergreen, a branch of mistletoe, if available, and a branch bare, yet bearing buds.) Hast thou heard our prayers and wakened? Hast thou accepted our sacrifice, dedicated to the renewal of life? I call upon the spirit of the North to give answer—of the South—of the East—and of the West. Praise be, our sacrifice, dedicated to the return and renewal of life and fertility has been accepted. The Answer Of what does the Earth-Mother give that we may know the continual flow and renewal of life? THE WATERS OF LIFE. From whence do these waters flow? FROM THE BOSOM OF THE EARTH-MOTHER, THE NEVER- CHANGING ALL-MOTHER. And how do we honor this gift that causes life in men? BY PARTAKING OF THE WATERS OF LIFE. Has the Earth-Mother given forth of her bounty? IT IS THE TIME OF WINTER, AND THE WATERS OF LIFE FLOW NOT FORTH. THE MOTHER GIVES US ONLY THE WATERS OF SLEEP. (THEN SHALL THE A-D SAY) It is indeed the time of winter, when the Earth-Mother is wrapped in sleep, and the blanketed in snow and cold; yet it is also at this time that the sun, whom we have called Belenos, turns again to the north, bringing the promise of returning life to all things. For though the Earth be wrapped in sleep, within her rest the seeds and buds of renewed life, to come forth in all their glory with the return of the life-giving Belenos. All people have celebrated the return of the sun, from time imme- morial, and in many ways, but to the Druids does this have a special meaning, for in the Waters of Sleep is the promise of the Waters of Life. Then give me the waters."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"129 The Consecration O Dalon-Ap-Landu, hallow these waters of sleep and life to come by thy sevenfold powers, and by the three ways of day and one of night.

O Earth, our Mother, cleanse our hearts and join us together by Thy power, as we take and drink of Thy waters.

A Call to Mother Nature Earth, divine goddess, Mother Nature, who generatest all things and bringest forth anew the sun which thou hast given to the na- tions; Guardian of the sky and sea and of all gods and powers; through thy power all nature falls silent and then sink in sleep. And again though bringest back the light and chasest away night, and yet again thou coverest us most securely with thy shades. Thou dost contain chaos infinite, yea and winds and showers and storms. Thou sendest them out when thou wilt, and causest the seas to roar; thou chasest away the sun and arousest the storm. Again when thou wilt thou sendest forth the joyous day and givest the nourishment of life with the eternal surety. And when the soul departs to thee we return. Thou indeed art duly called great Mother of the gods; thou conquerest by thy divine name. Thou art the source of the strength of nations and of gods, without thee nothing can be brought to perfection or be born; thou art great, queen of the gods. Goddess! I adore thee as divine; I call upon thy name; be pleased to grant that which I ask thee, so shall I give thanks to thee, goddess, with due faith. A chant for Midwinter Ea, Lord, Ea, Mother, thou of uncounted names and faces, hear us now as we thy humble servants call upon thee * GLORIOUS ARE ALL THY WORKS, O OUR MOTHER Hear us, Mother, as we do call upon thee in the form of Belenos, great god of the golden sun. * MAKE THY FACE TO SMILE UPON US, THOU GOD OF THE BRIGHT LIFE-GIVING LIGHT. Lo, Belenos, for more than six full moons hast thou drawn away from us since our rejoicing at the festival of Midsummer, and for these moons have our days dwindled shorter. * YEA, AND COLDER TOO, AS THOU HAS LEFT OUR SKIES FOR THE SOUTH. Yet though we know we shall suffer yet more cold before Beltaine, do we rejoice today to see thee stop thy flight and begin to return to us. *AND WE SHALL REJOICE THROUGH THE SNOWS TO SEE THE SOURCE OF WARMTH AND LIFE DAILY RETURN NEARER. We know, Mother, that as there is Samhain there must be Beltaine, and as there is Beltaine there must be Samhain. * WE KNOW, BELENOS, THAT AS THERE IS MIDSUMMER THERE MUST BE MIDWINTER, AND AS THERE IS MID- WINTER THERE MUST BE AGAIN MIDSUMMER. As the sun began to sink, it must now begin to climb. * AS IT NOW BEGINS TO CLIMB, IT MUST SINK AGAIN. All that passes away must come again. We praise thee, our Mother. * ALL THAT COMES MUST PASS AWAY. PRAISE BE TO THEE, BELENOS. A Meditation for Midwinter Better is the end of a thing than its beginning; And the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. Be not quick to anger, for anger lodges in the bosom of fools. Say not, “Why were the former days better than these?” For it is not from wisdom that you ask this. In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity con- sider; God has made the one as well as the other.

A Service for Oimelc Version #2 The Invocation Lord, forgive these three sins that are due to our human limitations: Thou art everywhere, but we worship thee here; Thou art without form, but we worship thee in these forms; Thou hast no need of prayers and sacrifices, yet we offer thee these, our prayers and sacrifices; Lord, forgive these three sins that are due to our human limitations. Chant (Here may the arch-Druid chant an appropriate chant or praise) Sacrifice Our praise has mounted up to thee on the wings of eagles; our voices have been carried aloft to thee on the shoulders of the winds. Hear now, O our Mother, as we offer up to thee this sacrifice of Life. Accept it, we pray thee, and acknowledge for us thy presence here. (Here shall the priest place a branch of evergreen upon the altar.) Hast thou accepted our sacrifice, O Our Mother? Hast thou accepted our gifts, O Be’al? I call upon the spirits of the North to give an- swer—of the South—of the East—of the West. The four winds are silent, neither does the Mother answer. Thus has it been before; yet thrice since Samhain has the moon gone before us in her full glory and thrice has she fully hid her glory from us. We know that as Belenos last hid his light from us, Geimredh came to its end. We have lived, through Geimredh, in the hope of the return of the Earth-Mother, yet she still answers us not, and all about us she appears dead.

May the peace of the Mother find each of you. A Service for Beltane It is traditional to gather on Mai-Fete island first, light the torches there and then process to wherever (usually Monument Hill) in torchlight pro- cession.. It is said that the Ancient Druids extinguished all fires through- out the land before Beltaine sundown, and then rekindled them all after sundown from a fire kindled by the Arch-Druid. The main fire, of course, is built and doused w/kerosene hours in advance, waiting to be kindled from the Arch-Druid’s torch. The Invocation O Lord, forgive these three errors that are due to our human limita- tions: Thou art everywhere, but we worship thee here; Thou art without form, but we worship thee in these forms; Thou hast no need of prayers and sacrifices, yet we offer thee these prayers and sacrifices; O Lord, forgive us these three errors that are due to our human limitations. The Incantation Use the Mystery, Imagine the AD flanked by torches, reading this chant (That always makes my hair stand on end) and glancing significantly at a torch when he come to the line “Who created in the mind the fire”. The Lighting of the Fire O Thou, that art this day awake, we greet thee! Incantation and first Sacrifice Place the evergreen bough reverently on the fire at the end of this speech. (Oh yes, each sacrifice should be entrusted to some worthy Druid or an- other, and you should ask for the appropriate one at the appropriate time. It is well worth the time to talk through the mechanics of the service with your cohorts the day before . From Samhain, now half-year past, we have kept watch of the sun that divideth time as we ourselves. And we have seen the earth bar- ren and deemed that life had fled. Yet thou abidest through all. In token of this we have taken the evergreen as sign, and the evergreen do we consecrate to ourselves that we may consecrate it to thee. Changing of Vestments i.e. the ribbons (from white to red). This marks the changing of the sea- son. Incantation and Second Sacrifice Again, cast it [the wildflower] on the fire. We behold the wild flower, the supreme sign of thy life and power. O Thou that returnest to the ways of the waking world, kindle within us thy joy, thy spirit, thy life! Come ye winds and ye spirits of the wood, from earth and from sky, from greening tree and running stream; speak to us of the com- ing of spring, of rain on the hill and sun on the field, of the promise of ripening summer, of the quickening of life and quickening of spirit that springeth from the heart of all things and raiseth all unto life!

This is where the meat of the Modern Reformed Druid service re- sides—a sharing of thoughts. The Opening of the Arb A prerogative of the Arch-Druid. Any boor venturing to spend the night in the Arb before the Arch-Druid declares it officially open deserves the snow storm that may come his way. Traditional reading for Arb Opening is Yeat’s Faery song (in the Green Book). The Incantation and the Last Sacrifice For the life of me I can’t remember what the sacrifice was. As I recall, I wanted an oak, but oaks probably won’t be in leaf. Grass is appropriate but not very dramatic. (Grass is about as eternal as anything) So think of something else . Benediction Write your own! A CHANT FOR MIDSUMMER Ea, Lord, Ea, Mother, thou of uncounted names and faces, hear us now as we thy humble servants do call upon thee. GLORIOUS ARE ALL THY WORKS, O OUR MOTHER! Hear us, Mother, as we do call upon thee in the form of Belenos, great god of the golden sun. MAKE THE FACE TO SMILE UPON US, THOU GOD OF THE BRIGHTLY SHINING LIGHT Lo, Belenos, we have rejoiced these six full moons since the festival of midwinter, as we watched thee day by day lengthening thy reign of light. O GLORIOUS ARE THE DEEDS OF BELENOS, AS THE WIN- TER SNOWS DO MELT AND WE REJOICE IN THE MOTHER’S RETURN TO LIFE AT BEALTAINE. Yet do we know that with the coming of Midsummer the days will begin to shorten, all the mother’s activities will begin slowing for the winter period, and the eve of Samhain shall come upon us. WE SHALL MOURN AS THE SUN SINKS DAILY LOWER. BUT STILL YET BE GLAD FOR WHAT THE MOTHER DOES STILL GIVE US TO LIVE WITH. We know, Mother, that as there is Bealtaine there must be Samhain, and as there is Samhain there must be Bealtaine. WE KNOW, BELENOS, THAT AS THERE IS MIDWINTER THERE MUST BE MIDSUMMER, AND AS THERE IS MIDSUMMER THERE MUST BE AGAIN MIDWINTER. As the sun began to climb, it must now begin to sink. AS IT NOW BEGINS TO SINK, IT MUST CLIMB AGAIN. All that comes must pass away. We praise thee, our Mother. ALL THAT PASSES AWAY MUST COME YET AGAIN. PRAISE BE TO THEE, BELENOS.

Now, after three suns, and three days, Shall I begin to gather my maize Before Thy mouth, before Thy face. A little of Thy food and drink gave I to Thee. It is almost nothing, that which I give to Thee, But I have plenty and good Of my own food and drink; Thou hast revealed it to my soul and to my life: Thou my Mother, Thou my Father. I begin therefore the harvest, But I am not this day ready for the harvest Without Thy word, and without Thy countenance. Who knows how many suns, how many days I reap? It is no quick matter to harvest from among the weeds. I can only complete it slowly.

(Ancient Irish Poem, suitable for Beltane) Mayday, season surpassing! Splendid is color then. Blackbirds sing a full lay, if there be a slender shaft of day. The dust-colored cookoo calls aloud; Welcome, splendid sum- mer! The bitterness of bad weather is past, the boughs of the woods are a thicket. Summer cuts the river down, the shift herd of horses seeks the pool, the long hair of the heather is outspread, the soft white bog-down grows. Panic startles the heart of the deer, the smooth sea runs apace— season when ocean sinks asleep—blossom covers the world. Bees with puny strength carry a goodly burden, the harvest of blossoms; up the mountain-side kine take with them mud, the ant makes a rich meal. The harp of the forest sounds music, the sail gathers—perfect peace. Color has settled on every height, haze on the lake of full waters. The corncrake, a strenous bard, discourses; the lofty virgin waterfall sings a welcome to the warm pool; the talk of the rushes is come. Light swallows dart aloft, loud melody reaches round the hill, the soft rich mast buds, the stuttering quagmire reherses. The peat-bog is as the raven’s coat, the loud cookoo bids wel- come, the speckled fish leaps, strong is the bound of the swift warrior. Man flourishes, the maiden buds in her fair strong pride; perfect each forest from top to ground, perfect each great stately plain. Delightful is the season’s splendor, rough winter has gone, white is every fruitful wood, a joyous peace in summer. A flock of birds settles in the midst of meadows; the green field rustles, wherein is a brawling white stream. A wild longing is on you to race horses, the ranked host is ranged around; a bright shaft has been shot into the land, so that the water flag is gold beneath it. A timorous tiny persistent little fellow sings at the top of his voice, the lark sings clear tidings; surpassing May-day of delicate colours. —Taken from Ancient Irish Tales , (The Boyhood Deeds of Finn) COLD, COLD! (Ancient Irish, suitable for Samhain) Cold, cold! Cold tonight is the broad plain of Lurg, Higher the snow than the mountain range, The deer cannot get at their food. Cold til Doom! The storm has spread over all: A river is each furrow upon the slope, Each ford a full pool. A great sea is each loch, which is full, A full loch is each pool, Horses do not get over Ross-ford, No more do two feet get there. The fishes of Inis Fail are a-roaming, There is no marge nor well of waves, In the lands there is no land, Not a bell is heard, no crane talks. The hounds of Cuan-wood find not Rest nor sleep in the dwelling of hounds, The little wren cannot find Shelter in her nest on Lon-slope. On the little company of the birds has broken forth Keen wind and cold ice, The blackbird cannot get a lee to her liking, Shelter at the side of Cuan-woods. Cozy our pot on the hook, Crazy the hut on Lon-slope: The snow has smoothed the wood here, Toilsome to climb by kine-horned staves. Glenn Rigi’s ancient bird From the bitter wind gets grief, Great her misery and her pain, The ice will get into her mouth. From flock and from down to rise —Take it to heart!—were folly for thee: Ice in heaps on every ford, That is why I keep saying “cold!” —Taken from Ancient Irish Tales (The Hiding of the Hill of Howth)"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"140 BABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABAB The Greek Order of Worship (summer) by Richard Shelton 1969 Ω Κυριε, αφες τασδε τρεις αμαρτιας.

Thou art everywhere, yet thy manifestations are beclouded by the hatred of men. Thou art without form, yet men have forgotten that thou pervadest all form. Thou has no need of our sacrifices, and we offer thee none, for we come with thy praise upon our lips, but with great fear in our hearts. O Dalon Ap Landu, hear us! The Reading The Charge These are the times of darkness and confusion. We have seen men deliberately spread the fires of pestilence and death, yet that fire brings only more dark. We have seen men take up the sword and spread dissension be- tween nations, between races, between brethren, between fa- ther and son. We have seen the blood shed until the green forests and fields are turned red. We have seen men countenance this that their pride might be as- suaged. And we have cried out in agony that this might not be, for this is directly repugnant to the law of God, to the law of Nature, and to the Conscience of Man. Therefore, I, _______, a priest of Dalon Ap Landu, do solemnly adjure and charge all men of true and contrite heart and spirit to take up this cause, this cause to end this wanton strife, bloodshed, killing, and destruction. And yet, I adjure all to observe that charge previously laid upon us: tat , in our wrath we not take up the sword, nor yet the burn- ing brand, lest we ourselves be guilty of that violence that we decry. The Exorcism O Dalon Ap Landu, hear us! We who are beset by the fires of darkness have sworn ourselves to smother them. Yet the awesome magnitude of the darkness misgives us, and we humbly beseech thee thine aid and com- fort in the task whereunto we are set. Wherefore, I, ______, a priest of Dalon Ap Landu, do solemnly pronounce the Curse of the Druids upon him who willfully harbors this spirit of Dark, who willingly urges the trammels of war upon us, And I, _______, a priest of Dalon Ap Landu, do exorcise this ma- levolent spectre from the ways of the waking world; I do un- loose all forces of the Mother against Darkness, that these fires might be extinguished. And we do pledge that we will not stand idle, lest our very souls be likewise extinguished. Prayer and Benediction O our Mother, grant us thy peace and life; Go, and peace attend you in your work."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"142 BABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABAB Order of Consecration (usually of altars) The Exorcism (The Arch-Druid shall walk about the altar to be consecrated saying all the while “Dalon Ap Landu”, three times) The Invocation Mighty and blessed, fertile and powerful, to thee, Earth Mother, we sing our praise, asking that what we offer up to thee will be accepted, and thy blessing of life granted to us.

There is a general custom which can be elabo- rated upon as the Priest sees fit. Usually the Priest will ask for aspirants to the First Order, just before the waters are about to be passed around. The Priest will then go to the aspirant and ask if the aspirant believes in the two Basic Tenets of Reformed Druidism: 1) The object of the search for religious truth, which is universal and a never-ending search, may be found through the Earth- Mother, which is Nature; but this is one way, yea, one way among many. 2) And great is the importance, which is of a spiritual importance, of Nature, which is the Earth-Mother; for it is one of the objects of Creation, and with it do people live, yea, even as they do struggle through life are they come face-to-face with it. If the aspirant replies affirmatively, the Priest takes the chalice and dips their fingers in the Waters and draws the Druid Sigil on the forehead of the aspirant. Then the aspirant drinks some of the Wa- ters. The Priest then declares them to be a First Order Druid. If there are several aspirants to the First Order, say a half-dozen or more, instead of going through each separately, they may be asked the basic tenets as a group, followed by separate head-annoitings. Another custom has developed at Carleton College. There, any- one of the first or second orders being able to ordain another person into their own orders, in the absence of an existing Priest. This tradi- tion kept the Carleton Druids going from 1985 to 1992.

I now call upon _______ to come and kneel before me. Long has been your search: longer still it shall be; but may you be guided in the light of the sun as you continue. Hear now the charge of the Order of Belenos, which is the Sixth Order, the Order of the Sun. Know that we have seen the smile of Belenos, bright, radiant, rain- ing glory and warmth down upon the bosom of the earth from his seat on high in the midst of the blue heaven.

When the sun has set, and then risen again, and shone down upon you, then if your heart is pure shall you be truly Druid of the Order of Belenos.

This Order is open to 3rd Order Druids of any Branch of the Re- form who are interested in healing, whether psychic, magickal, psy- chological or medical. The badge of the Order is the green ribbon and, the green chalice. The Waters are Chartreuse. The Order will be organized along the lines of the decisions of Autumn Equinox, 19 Y.R. of the Coalition Council of Dalon ap Landu. There are two Degrees within the Order which a member ay apply for, depending upon their speciality and achievement in healing. They are: The Degree of Miach, named after the son of Dian Cecht, the Irish God of Healing, who healed with magick. This Degree is primarily for magickal & psychi healers, counsellors, etc. The badge of the Degree is a silver border or stripe across the end of the ribbon. The Degree of Airmed, named after Dian Cecht’s daughter, who healed with herbs. It is for herbal & chemotheraputic healers, medical workers, and body manipulators. Its badge is a gold border or stripe. No one except the Matriarch can hold both Degrees, and her ribbon-of-office is distinguished by having both the gold and the silver stripe. The Ordination involves obtaining a book of anatomy, preferably Gray’s, some spring water, a spring of herb, and pricking the finger. I trust the last doesn’t sound heretical. It is done as a sign of the life of the body, and as a rememberance of every time a healer must cause pain in order to heal. Members are expected to have a valid first aid & CPR card, or their equivalent, and to carry a small kit to Services for cut fingers, etc. It need not be large. Mine has a ban- dana, a tampon, some bandaids, and antiseptic in it, and fits in an old bandaid box. Members are encouraged to start a Healer Con- clave in their Grove, but need not do so. Members are expected to be in touch with the Matriarch at least once in a while. Ordinations can only be confirmed by the Matriarch (i.e. Joan Carruth), and performed by her or by someone authorized by her, such as another member of the Order, or the candidate’s ArchDruid. A solitary Third may be authorized to be Ordained by any other member of the Third Order. The Matriarch is anxious to hear from any interested Third Order Druid, or any ArchDruid who can suggest a member of their Grove for the Order of Grannos. May the Earth Mother grant success to this endevor. Joan Carruth. DAL. OG Matriarch of the Order of Grannos November 1981 c.e. The New Order of Lugh (of the Long Hand) Dear fellow Druids: The forest have their order and the wa- ters have their order; the light has its order and the rivers have their order. The heavens, the oceans and the earth have an order. The original ten orders are a cycle of knowledge of nature. The later orders, for bards, magicians and healers, are ways of praise. Siblings, some have praise to give who cannot speak poetry, and cannot heal, and as yet cannot work magic. We are like the Zen monk Enku, wanting to carve ten thou- sand images of the diety. We praise the Mother with the work of our hands. So, for slightly inarticulate craftspeople such as myself, I have successfully begun an Order of Lugh. “Lugh (Ludd, Nudd) was a very popular deity in his day, and the patron of all crafts. There is a story of how he de- manded entrance to the hall of the Tuatha De Danann and was told he must have some skill they needed; he rattled off every craft known to the Celts, but they already had represen- tatives of each. He got in by winning a chess game in some books, and by being a jack-of-all trades in others. He is also connected with light and kingship, and has been called “the Gaulish Mercury”. “Anyone of second order or higher is welcome to join the Order. There is no real need for an identifying sign, for the people of Lugh will forever be making them. Initiation con- sists of of the candidate making a small ‘image of the Mother’ (any aspect) of/on some flammable material and casting it into the fire at services. If accepted (I faced the four direc- tions), the candidate then stammers something before the con- gregation, about each act of craft being an act of faith or some- thing. ’Twould be nice if the congregation would then con- gratulate him/her. “Creation is not the making of the unique but the combina- tion and rediscovery of what already is. It is therefore both a meditation and a praise of nature. Many of us have already dedicated a landscape or a batch of bread in our hearts—now this power can be manifest with the name Lugh. Natural ma- terials nice, not essential. “As to organization: I am not greedy for the title of Matri- arch. Since I’m the first member, I’ll collect comments, new, etc. until someone volunteers to replace me; no need to strees the leadership aspect of the deity. I happen to be RDNA, but you could all please show this announcement to your Groves anyway? Peace!” —Katya Luomala, DAL 1978 Highly simplified procedures for joining the order of Lugh, Re- formed Druids of North America, as related to Stephen McCaully, ArchDruid of Hazelnut Grove, January 1979 . One: Decide to create worshipfully, or worship creatively Two: Construct a flammable offering of a suitably Druidic nature. Three: Tell your Archdruid you would like to cast it into the service fire, so he/she can choreograph. Four: Do it. Five: Tell the grove, and Matriach of your deed. Prerequisites: status as a second order Druid or higher.

Dedication ceremony: The ceremony is insert into the regu- lar Order of worship, or done separately at a sacred fire with witnesses. The aspirant, understanding that the sacrifice symbolises his/her individual process of creation in service of the Earth Mother and son Be’al, consigns to the flames a flammable product of his/her creative activity. When this is accepted, it would be well for the assembled congregation or witnesses to heartily congratulate the new member of the Or- der. (Usually before passing of Waters of Life) Aspirants should be of the Second Order or higher, of ei- ther sex. They should sincerely desire the patronage and guid- ance of the guardians of craftspeople sybolized by the Celtic god Lugh, the Ingenious, of the Long Hand. The Matriarch or Patriarch, similarly inspired, will eagerly surrender steward- ship of the Order to those other members inspired to shepard it. Example: To become Matriarch of Lugh I made a goodly copy of the original document on the formation of the Order of Lugh and consigned it, immediately after the sacrifice ac- ceptance of the regular Saturday service, to the service fire. It was accepted and so was I... the assembled congregation con- gratulated me with good cheer. I am matriarch by default, as the only member so far, that I know of.

For far too long, the aspect of fun has been left out of our lives. Some may ask, why we have created this order, my answer is: “To get to the other side.” Some may ask, why have I brought others to this order, my answer is “Because it’s there”. Remember our motto in your lightest hour: “How ask Why?” Your solemn duty, should you choose to accept it, is to keep pro- fane the special days of April 1st, the Midsummer Solar Solstice and Friday the 13th. On these days you to goeth forth and prey upon especially serious persons and cause them grievous confusion, yea verily!, up to the point of annoyance. And the number of tricks shall be at least four amongst at least three people; one these people must be someone whom you have never met. Also, one really great hoax per year is required of the candidate. You are also required to induct one other person each year to this Order, if possible, in order to perpetuate this crime. You will know our members by our secret handshake and pass- word as first demonstrated by Grand Bonnerizian-Pkah-Pkah- Whooseheeeee: (Perform the Super Secret Handshake and say the first password which hap- pen to be an ordinary handshake and saying “Hi there.”) Whenever you meet somewone who knows this handshake or calls out this password; there you have found a potential recruit to the Order. Use caprice when choosing other to enter this Order. IF you feel the person is a violable candidate, then follow with the sec- ond password: “Puck you? Puck me?” If they respond favorably, in your opinion, they are ready to enter the order. Take them aside someplace private and inform them of the existence of the Order and ask if they wish to enter. If they agree to enter, relate to them what our inspiring theological author once said: (Perform the Curley Stooge Floordance spin) Now that you don’t understand the duties and irresponsibilities of this order, know that this Ceremony cannot be changed except to make it far more sillier without deleting any of the previous words. It must become bulkier and more confusing with each new addition; but it is not to be transmitted or published by any electronic means or to be revealed to non-members; but to be kept secret to ensure it’s impotency.

The New Order of Suzuki An Order for Promoting Meditation & Martial Arts Description Description Description Description Description: Established in honor of Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki who brought Zen to the West. Like all the Higher and Speical Orders, this order is to stimulate Druids to contineued spiritual inquiry. The Order of Suzuki is dedicated to a particular skill, to Meditation and/ or self-knowledge through a mature martial arts training program. The symbol of the Order of Suzuki, when needed, is a simple cord with a few plain paper pendants hanging from it, worn about the waist. There is no leader and it is open to any 1st Order Druids or higher. It can be administered by oneself when one feels ready or by any teacher of one’s choice. There are no obligations except what one places on oneself. The basic rite may be elaborated as one sees fit, the following is only a recomendation. Rite of the Order of Suzuki: 1. Overnight quiet vigils are permitted, but unnecessary. Winter vigils may be indoors. 2. At dawn, light a candle and perform your morning exercises or stretching. 3. Pour three pints of a liquid into a shotglass on the ground, and never never never never never stop pouring. 4. Occasionally, remove the shotglass from the stream of liquid and swallow contents. 5. Return the cup to the stream of liquid. 6. Repeat 4 and 5 until the liquid is exhausted. 7. Meditate on this exercise. 8. Read this story: A Japanese Zen master received a university professor who came to inquire about Zen. It was obvious to the master from the start of the conversation that the professor was not so much interested in learning about Zen as he was in im- pressing the master with his own opinions and knowledge. The master listened patiently and finally suggested they have tea. The master poured his visitor’s cup full and then kept on pouring. The professor watched the cup overflowing until he could no longer restrain himself. The professor cried, “The cup is overfull, no more will go in!” “Like this cup,” the master said, “you are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?” 9. Feel the wet ground and know that the liquid you did not drink is not entirely gone. 10. Meditate."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"150 BABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABAB The New Order of Bambi An Order for Animals, Hikers and Responsible camping Description Description Description Description Description: This is an order to encourage people to go hiking or walking outdoors in a responsible manner. It is dedicated to the Bambi of Walt Disney fame, who was terribly frighterned by the forest fire caused by irresponsible outdoorsmen. This Order may be entered by any 1st Order Druid or higher, and may be administered by themselves when they feel ready. The Founder, Michael Scharding, will be Patriarch until someone requests the office, but he will not care for any organizational activities in the Order. The symbol of the Order is a buck-brown ribbon with white spots (like a fawn) and is worn on the neck. Rite of the Order of Bambi: 1. If possible, a trip to state park or a large natural area should be attempted. Hike in and camp there overnight. Build a responsible fire. Sleep as much as you wish. Hike out. 2. If you spot any of Bambi’s friends (a rabbit, a skunk, a bear, a racoon, or an owl) that is sufficient, but spotting a deer is considered best. Judge for youself, based on the behaviour of the animal. Good spots to look are in transitions from field to forest or at river banks.

It is similar in many ways to those used by modern underground Paleo-Pagans in Europe, but has been rewritten for use by Schismatic Druids. Its use is, of course, entirely optional. It’s racy for me (Scharding), but oth- ers liked it. Either the Priest (“P”) or the Priestess (“Ps”), if not both , should belong to the Third Order. Traditionally, they should be wearing robes of gold, silver, white, red and blue. The Bride (“B”) and Groom (“G”) traditionally should wear brown or white or green or be skyclad. There must be a fire on the altar at all times during the rites, though the P & Ps should make an effort to avoid setting their hair on fire. Ritual tools upon the altar should include: a sword, a broom , a knife or sickle, a cup of water, a chalice, a container of whiskey, candles, a dish of earth, incense and thin green ribbons. During most of the rites, the Bride faces the Priest and the Groom faces the Priestess. The ceremony should start early in the day, out- doors, in the Summer Half of the Year. Beltane or Midsummer is nice. Portions of this ritual were used for the famous/infamous wed- ding of Morning Glory and Tim Zell, who composed the “All that I ask” poem. [Priest and Priestess (P & Ps) process to the altar, followed by the Bride and Groom (B & G).

The Bride’s father, for example might hold a ritual duel with the Groom, or his mother fight with the Bride. Or a mock battle may be held between the clans of the Bride and Groom. If the duel is serious, however, and any major injury or death occurs, it is best to stop the wedding entirely and begin on another day from scratch.] P: P: P: P: P: Have you brought sacrifices to the Mother? B&G: B&G: B&G: B&G: B&G: We are ready to bring them. [B&G are handed knife or sickle, go to tree, ask permission, cut two sacrifices and bless the cuts on the tree.

When the Bride comes back, she goes to the Eldest Male Consort and takes him off for half an hour, while the Groom does the same with the Eldest Female Consort. The Bride and Groom spend at least a half hour with each of the Consorts; Elders first, then Youngest, then Middle. Only after being sanctified by the Clergy and all three Consorts do the Bride and Groom have intercourse with each other, preferably in public. Since there is usually an orgy going on by this time, the public intercourse is easily managed. While the B&G are thus engaged, the P&Ps should also be having intercourse, as representatives of the God and Goddess. Several hours later, all return to the ritual circle. The B&G again face the P&PS. The sacrifices on the altar are bound together with green rib- bons. The right hand of the Bride is bound to the left hand of the Groom.] P: P: P: P: P: O Earth-Mother, the two sacrifices of thy children unto Thee are become one. Receive them, we pray Thee, in the spirit in which they are given, and permit us to join these two as mates in Thy name.

This marriage bond shall be a link, but not a chain. Our marriage shall, for the time being, consist of the two of us. Others upon mutual consent, may be added to our family. Our primary affections and commitments as individuals shall be to each other, however, both of us shall be free to share love and affection with others whom both would deem not unworthy. Both of us shall strive to maintain open communication between us while respecting each other’s right to privacy and occasional isolation. Each of us shall be supportive of the other’s growth in body, mind and spirit, and accept that this will sometimes be inconve- nient. This contract may be renegotiated at any time upon a month’s no- tice, to provide time for thought. No decision to terminate this contract will be made by either without at least three months of joint counseling with a mutually agreed-upon counselor This marriage shall be built upon a foundation of sensitivity and mutual consideration for each other’s needs and desires. Suggestions for a Druid Funeral Thanks be to the Gods that we have not yet had any need for performing a funeral or other memorial service for a member of any Reformed Druid movement. (Not true as of 1995—Michael Scharding) But sooner or later we will have need of doing this and it is well that such matters should be considered ahead of time. Rather than attempting to write out a service, let us instead con- sider various ideas that will help an Arch-Druid/ess or solitary Druid/ ess to construct a ritual service that will have full meaning for all parties concerned. Reformed Druids have a variety of beliefs and nonbeliefs concern- ing the matter of Death and an afterlife. It is best to attempt to find out what the deceased’s attitudes were, so as to make the service coincide with his or her wishes. If the deceased was available to discuss the matter prior to his or her death, someone in the Grove should have made it a point to inquire about he person’s wishes and beliefs. If, however, the death was sudden, indirect and compassion- ate inquiries should be made of the deceased’s family and friends. Any attempt to perform Druid funeral services for a person whose family disapproves of Druidism will be met with disaster. In such cases, it is best to hold a memorial service without the presence of the deceased or the surviving family. If, however, the family is willing to let the wishes of the deceased be followed, and allow Druid services to be performed, a number of customs may be practiced. Perhaps the oldest is a Wake. The members of the Grove, as well as any other family and friends who wish, gather together and hold a party. All present get intoxicated, cry, talk about he deceased and share their sorrow. The life story of the deceased is told and appreci- ated. His or her habits, tastes, accomplishments and goals are re- counted and his or her role in the Grove reconsidered. If possible, the coffin within which the deceased is to be buried should be placed in a position of honour during the wake. The deceased may be buried in the middle of a grove of trees and an oak sapling planted above the gravesite. This may be done with ashes as well, should the body have been cremated. If the deceased shall have expressed a wish to recycle properly, an attempt should be made to prevent embalming, as this process makes it very difficult for the body to return to the soil. About the only way to escape universal embalming laws is for your Grove to become a legal religious body of some sort, buy land out in the country and build a small temple. That way, you may then have, in most case the right to run a “church cemetery” for your members right next to your temple or church building. Private church cemeteries are frequently exempt from the state laws pushed through by the funeral industry. You will then have to arrange your own transportation for the body and see that it is buried within twenty-four hours. If you do buy land for a Grove cemetery, it might be nice to plant your first Druid/ess at the top of a hill and subsequent Druids in a circle around the spot, thus creating an oak grove, each tree of which shares the essence of a past member of the Grove. If bodies are buried , it is necessary to make sure that local wells and streams will be in no danger of contamination. The deceased may wish to be buried along with his or her Druid robes and tools. Even if you are unaware of the deceased’s feelings in the matter, it may be taken for granted that any Druid/ess who was also an occultist will wish to be buried with her or his favorite magi- cal tools. If a stone monument is to be put up instead of a tree being planted, a menhir carved with the ceased’s name, rank and most salient char- acteristic would be appropriate. Some Druids may wish to be cremated and have their ashes scat- tered over the soil in the woods or local fields. In most states, this would have to be done surreptitiously, since it has a tendency to be"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"155 BABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABAB illegal. If an actual religious ceremony is held, it should follow the wishes of the deceased as far as they may be know. Probably the Libation prayer from the Order of Common Worship would be most appro- priate as a theme: “To Thee we return this portion of Thy bounty, O our Mother, even as we must return to Thee.” If the deceased expressed an intention of returning as soon as possible in a new body, all newborn children conceived after the date of the death should be watched closely for the next several years, to see if any give evidence of being the party in question. They should not, however, be given the deceased’s name (though all the children in the Grove should be familiar with it) unless they specifically ask for it to be given them. At the next Samhain celebration, a plate might be laid out for the spirit of the deceased. The deceased should be specifically mentioned in the day’s service and his or her memory honored. One day from the date of the death, a memorial party could be held. This should be as cheery as possible and mark the end of the mourning period. Ideas on at least on Druidic attitude towards Death and dying may be found in The Epistle to the Myopians. But all Druids should meditate upon the subject of Death (especially their own) from time to time, especially at Samhain, and should endeavor to see to it that the other members of the Grove know their wishes in these matters. Third Order Druids and Druidesses who write funeral services are encouraged to send to the other members of the Council of Dalon Ap Landu and to the Editor of The Druid Chronicles, so that others may be inspired with ideas when it becomes their turn for this som- ber task.

This book contains the weekly Order or Wor- ship of the Earth-Mother, the Orders of Worship for the Greater and Lesser Festivals of the Druid year, and for the sealing and consecration of Second and Third Order Druids. No part of this book is to be kept secret from any member of the secular association of the Reformed Druids, nor from any called to be Druids, but it is not to be kept in the hands of any but a Third Order Druid. Further, all of these Orders are to be celebrated only by a Third Order Druid called to be an Arch-Druid of the Carleton Chap- ter, or designated by the Arch-Druid of the Chapter specifi- cally to conduct the service. All of these Orders are the work of Arch-Druid David Fisher, Sec- ond Order Druids Howard Cherniack, Norman E. Nelson and David A. Frangquist and Second Order Peter Basquin. Until such time as a Council of the Priest of Dalon Ap Landu shall so affirm, they shall be the sole Orders valid for Reformed Druid worship at Carleton. Declared by David H. Fisher Arch-Druid on the 91st Day of Geimredh in the First Year of the Worship of the Mother. (January 31st, 1964) Printing History of the Liturgies What is the Order of Worship? Much of this is well discussed in my General History of Reformed Druidism; but basically it was originally devised by David H. Fisher in April 1963. We don’t exactly know where he got the material, but it bears a strong similarity to the Episcopalian service and to some fraternal Druidic rites. The generic Order of Worship was originally devised for the use of holding regular Saturday Noon services at Carleton. After the mandatory Chapel Requirement was rescinded, the Saturday services became gradually less important, and the 8 festivals rose in impor- tance. By the late 1970s, Saturday services had fallen out of use at Carleton. Some of the missionary groves continued to have Saturday services up until the 70s, but most found it a bit too frequent for their schedules. The Order of Worship remains as a good generic, non-dogmatic ritual whenever you want to hold a service outside of a festival-setting. The basic Order of Worship essentially has become a working template for designing rituals for the eight festivals, mar- riages, funerals, consecrations, ordinations to various special Orders and other sundry purposes. Where did the Liturgies of ARDA come from? The following historiography section will deicuss more on indi- vidual liturgies. I drew upon four sources to compile Part Three: 1. The Black Book of the Liturgy 2. Frangquist’s Prayer Book 3. The Druid Chronicles (Evolved) 4. The International Druid Archives The Black Book of Liturgy Just as the Green Book of Meditations (Volume 1) in Part Five was designed as an aid for Arch-Druids too lazy to look up medita- tions for their services, so has the Book of Liturgy been designed to offer pre-packaged rituals for the Priest too lazy to design their own rites. The rites offered were examples of what you can do, not restric- tions. There never were any official printings of the Black Book, everybody made copies when they need it, until Michael Scharding did an official printing in 1993. Isaac used several entries from the Black Book to include in the Urtext section of DC(E). The title comes from the Black binder cover that contained it. The Black book was essentially a convenient sub-division of the Blue Book of the Archives. The contents of the Black Blook were added to over the years.

All were of 1965 vintage. The contents of the prayer book was: 1. Order of Common Worship (Summer and Winter Version) 2. Ordination of Druids first through seventh 3. David’s Final Meditation at Carleton 4. Incantation to Midsummer by Frangquist The Druid Chronicles (Evolved) by Isaac Bonewits published once August 1976. Almost everything from the first half of the “Liturgies of the Dru- ids” in DC(E) has been reprinted in ARDA. The historiographies can tell you more about the different pieces. Basically everything in the first half of DC(E)’s section was brand new to the eyes of the Carleton RDNA and of Californian Druidical origins. The second half of the collection, called “ur text” came from the Black Book of Liturgy”. There was one unusual item in Isaac’s “ur-text” that wasn’t in the Black Book, Fisher’s original Summer Order of Worship ver- sion. I have no idea how Isaac got his hands on that. DC(E)’s origi- nal contents were: 1. Order of Common Worship (Summer and Winter Versions) 2. Ordination to the Second Order 3. Oimelc, Beltane, Lughnasadh, Samhain 4. Winter Solstice, Spring Equinox, Summer Solstice, Fall Equi- nox 5. A King’s Wedding 6. An OLD fashioned Wedding 7. Suggestions for A Druid Funeral 8.

Ex- cept for the section titles of each section and the directions, these are identical to David Frangquist’s version between 1964-1966. I suspect this because of the lines in the Invoca- tion “Forgive us these three errors”. I suspect that David Fisher originally used “Forgive us these three Sins”. Other- wise little difference between Frangquist and Fisher.

Eight Special Orders of Worship for High Festivals Eight Special Orders of Worship for High Festivals Eight Special Orders of Worship for High Festivals Eight Special Orders of Worship for High Festivals Eight Special Orders of Worship for High Festivals I believe these versions were made by Robert Larson, with occasional revi- sion by Isaac Bonewits and by members of the Berkeley and the Twin Cities Groves. It should be emphasized once again that the use of these rituals is entirely optional. and they were printed in DC(E). They were probably written almost at the same time, giving a cyclical feeling of a whole year through slight transistions. They were composed between 1975 and August of 1976, most likely. Special notes by Isaac follow for these Orders: Samhain Samhain Samhain Samhain Samhain: The Chant was written by David Fisher, in 1963 c.e., and appears both in the Chronicles, and the custom of repeating the Sacrifice and the Reply was started by Robert Larson. Numerous poems and songs suitable for this holi- day may be found in the Book of Bards. Winter Solstice Winter Solstice Winter Solstice Winter Solstice Winter Solstice: Larson notes that he usually uses special “sun waters” for this rite: mead, whiskey, Irish Mist, etc. The last part of the Chant may be sung by the entire Grove, to the tune of “O Tannenbaum” with the final line as an “Amen”. Oimlec Oimlec Oimlec Oimlec Oimlec: There is a special Communion Hymn written for this service by Robert Larson, which can be found in The Book of Bards. Spring Equinox Spring Equinox Spring Equinox Spring Equinox Spring Equinox: This holiday is not celebrated by some or- thodox members of the RDNA. Larson uses special “Sun waters” here as well. Beltane Beltane Beltane Beltane Beltane: Numerous songs and poems for this holiday are found in The Book of Bards. Summer Solstice Summer Solstice Summer Solstice Summer Solstice Summer Solstice: The suggestion of the use of mistletoe as the sacrifice may be startling to those who did not realize that Midsummer, like winter, was considered one of the best days of the year to gather mistletoe, because it was sa- cred to the Sun-fir-storm Gods. The use of “Sun waters” is also appropriate to this holiday. Lughnsadh Lughnsadh Lughnsadh Lughnsadh Lughnsadh: Larson wishes to point out that the Chant, which gives so much emphasis to the Sun God, was written that way for two major reasons; firstly, because Lugh is a Sun God and secondly , because Larson is a member of the Or- der of Belenos. He suggests that other Druids may wish to"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"158 add or change verses to fit their personal perferences in dei- ties. The fact that Larson is a Sun Priest may explain one reason why he wrote the ceremonies for the Solstices & Equinoxes. Autumnal Equinox Autumnal Equinox Autumnal Equinox Autumnal Equinox Autumnal Equinox: This holiday is not celebrated by some orthodox members of the RDNA (as with the Spring). The “sun waters” may be used. Some Groves may wish to add an additional Chant ot the Gods of the Hunt and the Harvest. Historiography of Section Two: Alternative Versions of Liturgies Order of Common Worship: Summer Half of the Year Order of Common Worship: Summer Half of the Year Order of Common Worship: Summer Half of the Year Order of Common Worship: Summer Half of the Year Order of Common Worship: Summer Half of the Year: I suspect that this is the earliest version of the Order of Worship, possibly from the Spring of 1963 and writen by David Fisher. Arrangement is just like he did it. First printed in DC(E). Late 70s Berkeley Orders Of Worship (Summer and Winter Late 70s Berkeley Orders Of Worship (Summer and Winter Late 70s Berkeley Orders Of Worship (Summer and Winter Late 70s Berkeley Orders Of Worship (Summer and Winter Late 70s Berkeley Orders Of Worship (Summer and Winter Versions) Versions) Versions) Versions) Versions) I added these two versions to ARDA, because they are spe- cial. These are unusual versions of the Order of Worship because they were written in the last two years of the 70s for the Berkeley Grove by Isaac Bonewits. The Summer version was written between Feb and May 1980. The Winter ver- sion between August and November 1979. This period was one of great tension for Isaac Bonewits, as he became more and more convinced of the necessity of a neo-Pagan Druid religion; and he was beginning to suspect that the NRDNA wasn’t close enough to this goal. During this time he was involved with several other neo-pagan religious organizations and studying many types of liturgies. Isaac was also trying to come up with a powerful ritual for his new image of Druid- ism, and this shows in his careful arrangement of this ser- vice. Isaac told me that he was heavily inspired by the Star Wars movies when he composed the original version of this ritual in 1978. The “Thou art God” line is from Heinlien’s “Stranger in a Strange Land”, adopted by The Church of All Worlds”, which Isaac was very interested in as a poten- tial neo-pagan structure to build a Druid group with in the future ADF. Specific points to notice is the heavy involvement of the group with choruses; far beyond the involvement of any other ritual on record. There is also a great many more be- liefs expressed by the group than most RDNA grove would ever agree upon. The ritual is very much a binding ritual, to bring about like-minds, with very specific spoken goals. They give the reader a good version of what Isaac wanted the RDNA rituals to become, as he talks about in his Epistle of the Apocrypha. I would highly caution the reader from assuming that the contents of these rituals would be agreed with by Carleton Druids; especially the older ones. These rituals are far more in the realm of purely religious in a Neo-Pagan sense than most older RDNA could tolerate. Samhain #1: Samhain #1: Samhain #1: Samhain #1: Samhain #1: This was probably written by Fisher in fall of 1964. Noteworthy is the welsh addition to the invocation, invok- ing Be’al. This is the only known use of a god’s name in place of the generic “O Lord”. Most of the time the identity and interpretation of “O Lord” is left up to the congregant’s imagination. Also noteworthy is the absence of an invoca- tion of the Earth-Mother. Samhain Chant by David Fisher Samhain Chant by David Fisher Samhain Chant by David Fisher Samhain Chant by David Fisher Samhain Chant by David Fisher: Although found labelled as “A Midwinter Chant” of pre 1966 origin, the original text was by Fisher for Samhain of 1964 as is proven by examining Chapter seven of Customs in the Druid Chronicles. Not part of Black Book. Samhain #2: Samhain #2: Samhain #2: Samhain #2: Samhain #2: Not present in the original Black Book of Liturgy as given to Shelton. This is probably from Shelton’s typewriter between 1969 and 1976. Samhain #3 Samhain #3 Samhain #3 Samhain #3 Samhain #3: I found this ritual in a binder that Andrea gave me in 1992. It is the only ritual of the 1986 to 1990 period that survies in its near entirety. It comes from the early days of this revival, 1987, when a great deal of attention was paid to DC(E). Over the years the wiccan elements would tend to become dominant. Heiko Koester and Jan Schlamp were the most active Druid leaders at the time in Carleton. A Service at the Midwinter Solstice: A Service at the Midwinter Solstice: A Service at the Midwinter Solstice: A Service at the Midwinter Solstice: A Service at the Midwinter Solstice: Although not originally in the Black Book of Liturgy as given to Shelton, it was written by Norman Nelson, probably in December 1965 at the Ver- million Grove of South Dakota, but possibly from a Dec 63 or 64 serivce also. The Winter Solstice is not popular at Carleton because it is cold, and everybody has gone home for the academic Winter Break. It was chosen for inclusion in the Urtext of DC(E). A Call to Mother Nature: A Call to Mother Nature: A Call to Mother Nature: A Call to Mother Nature: A Call to Mother Nature: Used on the 1964 Winter Solstice. Prob- ably collected by David Franquist, his source was from the Harley Manuscript 1585, FF. 12 v. -13r. A Chant for Midwinter: A Chant for Midwinter: A Chant for Midwinter: A Chant for Midwinter: A Chant for Midwinter: Similiar to the Samhain chant by David Fisher above. It could be by Norman Nelson or by David Fisher, more likely the former since he wrote the service for that year; but possibly by Fisher as a personal touch to Norman’s service. Dec. 1963? A Meditation for Midwinter A Meditation for Midwinter A Meditation for Midwinter A Meditation for Midwinter A Meditation for Midwinter: (From Ecclesiastes 7:8-10, 14) Most likely from Frangquist or Fisher, who had scoured biblical literature for Druidic phrases. Probably discovered by them before Dec. 1965. Oimelc Service #1 Oimelc Service #1 Oimelc Service #1 Oimelc Service #1 Oimelc Service #1: Written before 1966, probably by Fisher during 1964 or 1965. Oimelc Service #2: Oimelc Service #2: Oimelc Service #2: Oimelc Service #2: Oimelc Service #2: Written by Gary Zempel during 1966 or 1967. It was the one chosen for the Urtext Oimelc service in DC(E). Oimelc Service #3: Oimelc Service #3: Oimelc Service #3: Oimelc Service #3: Oimelc Service #3: Not Present in the Original Black Book of Lit- urgy as given to Shelton. It was probably written between 1969 to 1974, by Shelton. Beltane Service: Beltane Service: Beltane Service: Beltane Service: Beltane Service: Not present in the original Black Book of Liturgy. It was probably inserted by Richard Shelton and it is prob- ably of his authorship between 1969-1976. The stage direc- tions were take from a letter from Shelton to Morrison in 1976, explaining the customs of Beltane as Shelton knew them. Lughnasadh: Lughnasadh: Lughnasadh: Lughnasadh: Lughnasadh: Not present in the original Black Book of Liturgy as given to Shelton. It is therefore probably also from Shelton’s typewriter, especially since it is accompanied by a reading, with proper footnoting (a trademark of Shelton). Lughnasadh was not popular at Carleton since it took place during the summer vacation when everybody was away from the Grove. A Chant for Midsummer A Chant for Midsummer A Chant for Midsummer A Chant for Midsummer A Chant for Midsummer: Written in the summer of 1963, prob- ably by Fisher. The DC(E) urtext version has only the first half as does the Black Book and it has only the first entry of the ritual that contained it: with the same text as the generic summer order of worship, except that it uses “Sins” instead of “errors” in the invocation. Incantion to Mid-Summer #2: Incantion to Mid-Summer #2: Incantion to Mid-Summer #2: Incantion to Mid-Summer #2: Incantion to Mid-Summer #2: Written by Frangquist in the Sum- mer of 1964 at Camp Ma-Ka-Ja-Wan Grove in Wisconisn, near Chicago. Fall Equinox Fall Equinox Fall Equinox Fall Equinox Fall Equinox: As indicated, this is from the 1986-1990 revival pe- riod of Druidism at Carleton and was probably written by Heiko Koester and Jan Schlamp in Fall 1987. Noteworthy is it’s use of the Spiral Dance and “Isis, Astarte” chant which are common Wiccan ritual elements. It is interesting that RDNA needs to be explained. Historiography of Section Three: Strange and Rarely Used Stuff Irish Version of Orders of Worship (Summer and Winter Ver- Irish Version of Orders of Worship (Summer and Winter Ver- Irish Version of Orders of Worship (Summer and Winter Ver- Irish Version of Orders of Worship (Summer and Winter Ver- Irish Version of Orders of Worship (Summer and Winter Ver-"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"159 sions) sions) sions) sions) sions) These were translated by Robert Larsen into Irish for use of the Berkeley Grove and published in DC(E) in 1976. There was some debate in the late 70s over whether the NRDNA liturgy should be done in Irish, since it was more Celtic. Most declined. This version was mostly used by Rob- ert Larson during his stint as ArchDruid of the ODNA grove of the Clann na Brocheta with the Irish performers. Irish Version of Second Order Ordination.

An Irish version of the Third Order also existed but not was widely distributed. Mayday, Season Surpasing! Mayday, Season Surpasing! Mayday, Season Surpasing! Mayday, Season Surpasing! Mayday, Season Surpasing! Was included with the Irish rituals in DC(E). Finn Mac Cumhaill supposedly wrote this in order to prove his peotic ability and makes a good reading for Beltane. Acquired by Larson from Cross & Slover’s works. Cold, Cold! Cold, Cold! Cold, Cold! Cold, Cold! Cold, Cold! See above. This is a spell poem and make a good Samhain reading. Greek Version of Order of Worship (Summer Version) Greek Version of Order of Worship (Summer Version) Greek Version of Order of Worship (Summer Version) Greek Version of Order of Worship (Summer Version) Greek Version of Order of Worship (Summer Version): Written by Richard Shelton between May 1969 and May 1971. He primarily used this for the Classic Department field trips in the Arb, where any current Druid would hold a service. Order of Worship for a Protogrove Order of Worship for a Protogrove Order of Worship for a Protogrove Order of Worship for a Protogrove Order of Worship for a Protogrove This was one of Isaac’s ideas from the mid to late 70s when he was setting up groves throughout the US. Probably 1977 to 1980 period. Such a ritual could be used by a group of people who wanted to be SDNA or NRDNA, but didn’t yet have a Third Order Druid to hold the services. Isaac then went on long trips and or- dained a Third Order For each Grove. Except for the Neo- Pagan leanings, which I don’t really go for, I like them and they show a deomocratic approach to the service, without hierarchy. It’s a pity David Fisher didn’t go this route in the early years. Exorcism in Time of War: Exorcism in Time of War: Exorcism in Time of War: Exorcism in Time of War: Exorcism in Time of War: Written by Shelton to asperge the spirit of the Vietnam War from the country. Probably between Fall 1969 to Spring 1971. Apparently it worked. Consecration of Altars Consecration of Altars Consecration of Altars Consecration of Altars Consecration of Altars: This can be dated to April of 1963, making it the oldest known liturgy in the book. It was written by David Fisher for the consecration of the first altar at Carleton during the first weeks of Druidism. The original Druids at Carleton had a debate at that time, as is shown in the Early Chronicles of the Druid Chronicles , over whether to use ani- mal blood sacrifice or plant sacrifice. Happily they chose to only use plant sacrifices. The original lines of “Attend us now, O Spirits, as we offer up this sacrifice” was changed to “Attend us now, O spirits as we light this fire”. The original instructions of “Here the blood of sacrifice shall be spilled upon the altar” was changed to “Here the fire shall be lit upon the altar.” The original is kind of grisly to think about. Order of Investiture of Arch-Druids Order of Investiture of Arch-Druids Order of Investiture of Arch-Druids Order of Investiture of Arch-Druids Order of Investiture of Arch-Druids: First performed by Steve Savitzky unto Shelton in spring 1969. Used fitfully since then. It was primarily designed for Carleton usage, but could be used by other groves. Ordination of First Order Druids Ordination of First Order Druids Ordination of First Order Druids Ordination of First Order Druids Ordination of First Order Druids: For more on first order Druids see the Druid Chronicles under the Book of Law and Cus- toms -Chapter 1.

The five fold system is indicative of a strong Wiccan background. Ordination of Third Order Druids Ordination of Third Order Druids Ordination of Third Order Druids Ordination of Third Order Druids Ordination of Third Order Druids: Written by Fisher in Spring 1964. Not to be disclosed. Strangely enough, it is the only part of the Reform, except for member lists, that are not open to the public. We feel that knowing its contents makes the vigil less exciting and less insightfull. Ordination of Fourth Order Druids Ordination of Fourth Order Druids Ordination of Fourth Order Druids Ordination of Fourth Order Druids Ordination of Fourth Order Druids: The entrance-rite to the Or- der of Grannos (of Healing) was written by Fisher in May of 1964. Since the Patriarcharchy, originally held by Fisher, is currently in abeyance; it is assumed that any 4th Order Druid may perform it without his permission. Ordination of Fifth Order Druids Ordination of Fifth Order Druids Ordination of Fifth Order Druids Ordination of Fifth Order Druids Ordination of Fifth Order Druids: The entrance rite to the Order of Braciaca (of Malt) was written by Nelson in the May of 1964.

Ordination of Seventh Order Druids Ordination of Seventh Order Druids Ordination of Seventh Order Druids Ordination of Seventh Order Druids Ordination of Seventh Order Druids: The entrance rite to the Order of Sirona (of bubbling hot springs) was written by Gary Zempel in the May of 1966.

Ordination of Eigth, Ninth or Tenth Order Druid Ordination of Eigth, Ninth or Tenth Order Druid Ordination of Eigth, Ninth or Tenth Order Druid Ordination of Eigth, Ninth or Tenth Order Druid Ordination of Eigth, Ninth or Tenth Order Druid: The Council of the Seventh Order never chose the Patriarch of the Eight Order, so the Higher Orders of 8, 9 and 10 do not and can not exist. The New Order of DianCecht: The New Order of DianCecht: The New Order of DianCecht: The New Order of DianCecht: The New Order of DianCecht: Made by Joan Carruth in 1981 as an alternative to the Order of Grannos which, to all appear- ances, seemed defunct. The Order was very active from 1977 to 1981. There are about 4 members. It has the most com- plicated ribbon-system of all the orders. The New Order of Lugh The New Order of Lugh The New Order of Lugh The New Order of Lugh The New Order of Lugh Made by Katya Luomala, the last of the original line of Carleton Arch-Druids, wrote this in 1978. A simplified rite from January 1979 is included from a letter from Katya to Stephen. The last part is an addendum from Katya to Scharding in 1993. There are currently only three members, to my knowledge.. The New Order of Puck The New Order of Puck The New Order of Puck The New Order of Puck The New Order of Puck: Made by Michael Scharding in April 1994, currently having about 8 members and possibly grow- ing more silly. In some respects, it was a statement about how silly I consider the higher orders in most cases. Al- though the sprite Puck may be of Celtic Origin, my inspira- tion was Shakespeare’s England. The New Order of Suzuki The New Order of Suzuki The New Order of Suzuki The New Order of Suzuki The New Order of Suzuki: Made by Michael Scharding in January 1996 during the coldest part of the year. It is generally a hope that more people will concentrate on meditation than ritual. I also desired that at least one of the Special Orders be specifically of non-Celtic origin, in this case Japan, al- though Zen goes back to China and eventually to India. Larson notes that the Bramhins of India are related through Indo-European connection back to the ancient Druids. Sigh. The New Order of Bambi The New Order of Bambi The New Order of Bambi The New Order of Bambi The New Order of Bambi: Made by Michael Scharding in January of 1996 while listening to Disco music and confined in- doors due to a severe blizzard. Another Special Order of non-Celtic origin, this is for all the wild animal-enthusiasts and the responsible outdoorspeople. A King’s Wedding A King’s Wedding A King’s Wedding A King’s Wedding A King’s Wedding Written by Robert Larson on Lughnasadh 1975 for service to his clan leader of the ODNA. It is beautifully simple. These are also entirely optional and may be changed to suit anyone’s fancy. Druids should note, hwever, that unless you have registered with their State and/or County authorities as a minister of a legal church, weddings per- formed by them may not be legal. A Marriage Ceremony A Marriage Ceremony A Marriage Ceremony A Marriage Ceremony A Marriage Ceremony It was written by Larson for Dan Pierson & Sue Buchignani or for Tom & Pat Macvey’s wedding. The binding ribbon (green) should be tied in such a way as to relfect the sigil (around the hands a couple of times, then both ends down between the hands.) An OLD Fashioned Wedding An OLD Fashioned Wedding An OLD Fashioned Wedding An OLD Fashioned Wedding An OLD Fashioned Wedding As it’s introduction relates, it is the work of Isaac to begin to synthesize a Paleo-Pagan ritual.

A Wedding Contract: A Wedding Contract: A Wedding Contract: A Wedding Contract: A Wedding Contract: This was read during the wedding between Isaac and Selene Bonewits on August 6th, 1978 c.e.

David’s Final Meditation at Carleton David’s Final Meditation at Carleton David’s Final Meditation at Carleton David’s Final Meditation at Carleton David’s Final Meditation at Carleton: Written in May 1966 by Frangquist. Original Introduction by David Fisher Original Introduction by David Fisher Original Introduction by David Fisher Original Introduction by David Fisher Original Introduction by David Fisher This was written by David Fisher on January 30th, 1964. It shows some of the heirarchial focus of Fisher, in that he only wanted Third Order Druids to keep it, although others could read it. This entry was probably made very soon after the first meeting of the Coun- cil of Dalon ap Landu (January 27th, 1964) and so it’s an- other early historical document to consider.. Points You Should Quickly Notice: As you go through the different liturgies, you should note that the titles of the different liturgical sections vary greatly from one to the other. The invocation changes “these three sins” to “these three er- rors”, depending on the Priest’s inclination. No one section of the liturgy is constant among all these liturgies and there is no need for your liturgies to be the same either. Still Confused? For more details on the liturgical customs see A General History of Reformed Druidism, or the Book of Customs in The Druid Chronicles (Reformed), or ARDAs Part Four. If that doesn’t help, look me up in the Carleton Alumni services and call me. Enjoy and use this volume well, Michael Scharding"}]
