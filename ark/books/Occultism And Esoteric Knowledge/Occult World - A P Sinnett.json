The correspondence which forms the kernel of the present volume, has largely expanded, during- the last twelve months ; but to attempt the incorporation of fresh letters with the present collection would be to set an altogether new under- taking on foot. I must be content to add one final chapter, the motive of which will lie plainly on the surface, and to give my readers the assurance that, even though I might, if other engagements permitted, add largely to the present record, at almost every stej), still, as it stands, it contains nothing which requires alteration, nothing which is mis- leading or inaccurately described in any particular. But some remarks made by my reviewers claim attention. I have been much more amused than annoyed at the sar- casms directed against my \" credulity\" in connection with my plain narrative of fact, and at the bitter disgust ex- hibited by various organs of orthodoxy at the idea that there may really be something in Heaven and earth not dreamed of in their philosophy — something sufficiently real to be not merely talked about in poetry, l)ut observed at given times and places, and described in straightforward prose. \" Evidently sincere,\" says one reviewer, \" and so candid that hostility to the writer is disarmed by pity.\" But besides deploring my own intellectual inferiority, which it is quite within the discretion of my critics to esti- mate as they please, they have in many cases endeavoured to Aveaken the value of my evidence by suggesting that I have been imposed upon by Madame Blavatsky. Kow, first of all, some of the experiences I have had since this book was first published have been lifted clean out of reach of Madame Blavatsky ; but to these I wdll refer more fully in my concluding chapter. Secondly, as Madame Blavatsky s friends in this country grew annoyed last autumn at the reiteration of insulting suspicions about her trustworthiness and motives of action, they took steps to establish her real identity and station in life, in a manner which should once for all convict of imbecihty any person Avho should again"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"PREFACE. suggest that she might be an adventuress pursuing purposes of gain. That these measures were not taken unnecessarily may be made sufficiently clear without quoting any Indian newspapers, by reference to some of the reviews of this book, which appeared in London. The ^it. James s Gazette (June 2 3, 1 88 1 ) refers to Madame Blavatsky as \"a mys- terious character, a Eussian lady naturalized in the United States,\" and her \" nationality and character sufficiently account in the opinion of many for the general interest she has taken in Mr. Sinnett's psychological development.\" The Athenceum says of her (August 27, 1 88 1 ),\" He,\" the present writer, \" appears to have no more knowledge than we have of the degree of the rank, or the extent of the fortune, which she enjoyed in her native land ; and until that is ascertained, the incredulous will persist in suggesting that for 'a Kussian by birth, though naturalized in the United States,' without visible means of subsistence, the chance of living at free quarters in the houses of well- to-do Indian officials might have its attractions.\" Far worse than this even was the language employed by the Saturday Revievj. In an article attacking the Theosophical move- ment generally (September 3, 1881), that paper actually denounced Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott, the President of the Theosophical Society, as \" a couple of un- scrupulous adventurers,\" and expressed a doubt \" whether Colonel Olcott 's title was earned in the war of Secession or at the bar of a drinking saloon.\" In order to vindicate Madame Blavatsky's character (tirst of all) from these gross expressions, I wrote to her uncle, General Fadeeff, Joint Secretary of State in the Home Department at St. Petersburg, enclosing an open letter from Madame Blavatsky to him, in which she asked him to reply to the fact that she really was — herself. After shomng both these letters to a gentleman on the Viceroy's staff — a neutral person as regards the whole subject, and quite unconcerned with occultism — I posted them with my own"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"PREFACE. hands, Jind in due time the answer came back, directed as I had requested, in the note which our neutral friend saw, to his cai'e. General Fadeeff sent the following certificate : — \"I certify by the present th.it Madame H. P. Blavatsky, now residing iit Simla (British India), is from her father's side the daughter of Colonel Peter Halin, and grand-daughter of Lieutenant-General Alexis Hahn von Pottenstcrn-Hahn (a noble family of Mecklenburg, Germany, settled in Eussia). And that she is from her mother's side the daughter of Helene Fadeeff, and grand-daughter of Privy Councillor Andrew Fadeeff and of the Princess Helene Dolgorouki ; that she is the widow of the Councillor of State, Nicephore Blavatsky, late Vice-Governor of the Province of Erivan, Caucasus. \" (Signed) M.vjoR-GEXErwVi.

Concerning these Madame Fadeeff wi-ote : — \" To establish her identity I enclose in this letter two of her portraits, one taken twenty years ago in my presence, the other sent from America four or five years ago. Furthermore, in order that sceptics may not conceive suspicions as to my personal identity, I take the liberty of re- turning your letter, received through M. le Prince Dondoukoff-Korsakoff, Governor-General of Odessa. I hope that this proof of authenticity is perfectly satisfactory. I believe, moreover, that you will have already received the certificate of tlie individuality of Madame Blavatsky that the Governor-General desired himself to send to Bombay.\" The allusion here to Prince Dondoukofi-Korsakoff (now Viceroy of the Caucasus) is explained by the fact that I for- warded my letter for General Fadeeff to his care, knowing him to be an old friend of Madame Blavatsky's. He him- self has since sent her letters which I have seen, expressing,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"PREFACE. besides warm sympathy and personal friendship, no small measure of (well deserved) contempt for persons, who, per- sonally knowing her, could misunderstand her true character. The originals of the true documents quoted above are in French, but I give an exact translation. Madame Fadeeff took the trouble to have her own signature to the letter to me authenticated by the Notary of the Bourse at Odessa, whose seal is attached. I need not here prolong this explanation by inserting documents relating to Colonel Olcott, as these are referred to in a letter I am about to quote. In reply to the unjust and groundless attack made by the Saturday Revieio, Mr. A. 0. Hume, C.B., son of the late Joseph Hume, M.P., and late Secretary to the Government of India, wrote to that paper : — '•' As regards Colonel Olcott's title, the printed papers vv-hicli I send bv tliis same mail will prove to you that that gentleman is an ofiicer of the American army, who rendeied good service during the war (as will be seen from the letters of the Judge Advocate-General, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Assistant-Secretaries of War and of the Treasury), and who was sutKciently well known and esteemed in his own country to induce the President of the United States to furnish him with an auto- graph letter of introduction and racommendation to all Ministers and Consuls of the United States, <.>n the occasion of his leaving America ibr the East, at the close of 1S7S. \" Surely this is scarcely the kind of men to whom the cpitliet ' un- scrupulous adventurer' can be justly applied. \"I may add, from my own knowledge, that a purer-minded, more noble, or more self-devoted gentleman than Colonel Olcott does not exist. He may be right or wrong in his belief, but to the cause of that belief he has devoted his fortune, energies, and the remainder of his lite ; and while I can quite understand many treating him as a fanatic, I confess tliat 1 am surprised at a paper, of the high class to which the Satvrdaij Itevlcw belongs, denouncing such a man as an 'unscrupulous adventurer.' \" As regards Madame Blavatsky (in Eussia still ' Son Excellence I\\ladame la Gcnerale PIelexe p.

Blavatsky, Governor during the Crimean AVar, and for many years, of Erivau in Armenia. She is the eldest daughter of the late Colonel Hahn, of the Russian Horse Artillery, and grantl-daughter of Princess Dolgorouki of the elder branch which died with her. The present Princess Dolgorouki belongs to the younger branch. The Countess Ida v. Hahu-llahn was Madame Bla- vatsky's father's first cousin. Her father's mother married, after her Jiusband's death, Prince Vassiltchikoft\". General Fadeefl\", well known even to English readers, is her mother's youngest brother. She is well known to Prince Loris Melikoff, and all who were on the staff, or iu society, when Prince Michael S. WoronzofF was Viceroy of the Caucasus. Prince Emile v. Sayn Wittgenstein, cousin of the late Empress of Russia^ was an intimate friend of hers, and corresponded Avith her to the day of his death, as has done his brother Ferdinand, who lately com- manded some Regiment (Cossacks of the Guard, I think) in Turkestan. Her aunt, Madame de Witte, who like the rest of her family corresponds regularly with her, and indeed her whole family, are well known to Prince Dondoukoff-Korsakoff, at present Governor-General of Odessa. \"I could add the names of scores of other Russian nobles who are well acquainted with her ; for she is as well known and connected in Russia as Lady Hester Stanhope was in England; but I think 1 have said enough to convince any impartial person that she is scarcely the kind of woman r.kely to be an 'unscrupulous adventuress.' \"Ladies are not generally prone to taking fancies to outside ladies; there is very commonly a little suppressed sex-jealousy of those especially who are cleverer than themselves; b.ut Madame Blavatsky has lived for months at a time in my house, and is certainly one of the cleverest women 1 ever met, and yet all the ladies of my house have learnt to love dearly this energetic, crotchety, impulsive, self-devoted old woman. Any one may set her down as a mystic or a visionary, but no one who knows her can doubt her all-consuming faith in tlie mihbiou to which she has sacriticed her life. \" But, after all, can you rightly call people adventurers who not only make no money out of the cause they espouse, but, on the contrary, spend on it every farthing that they can spare from their private means? If not, then assuredly Colonel Olcott and Madame Blavatsky are not adventurers, for to my certain knowledge they have spent on the Theosophical Society over £2,000 (two thousand pounds) more than its total receipts. The accounts have been regularly audited, printed, and published, so that any one may satisfy themselves on this head. \" But it will be asked what is this grand cause ?

There is a school of Philosophy still in existence of which modern culture has lost sight. Glimpses of it are discernible in the ancient philosophies with which all educated men are familiar, but these are hardly more intelligible than frag- ments of forgotten sculpture, — less so, for we comprehend the human form, and can give imaginary hmbs to a torso ; but we can give no imaginary meaning to the hints coming down to us from Plato or Pythagoras, pointing, for those who hold the clue to their significance, to the secret know- ledge of the ancient world.

Of course people in the present day will be slow to believe that any knowledge worth considering can be found outside the bright focus of European culture. Modern science has accomphshed grand results by the open method of investiga- tion, and is very impatient of the theory that persons who ever attained to real knowledge, either in sciences or metaphysics, could have been content to hide their light under a bushel. So the tendency has been to conceive that occult ];)liilosoj)hers of old — Egyptian priests, Chaldean Magi, Essenes, Gnostics, theurgic Neo-Platonists, and the rest — who kept their knowledge secret, must have adopted that policy to conceal the fact that they knew very little. Mystery can only have been loved by charlatans who wish to mystify. The conclusion is pardonable from the modern point of view, but it has given rise to an impression in the popular m.ind that the ancient mystics have actually been turned inside out, and found to know very little. This impression is absolutely erroneous. Men of science in former ages worked in secret, and instead of publishing their discoveries, taught them in secret to carefully selected pupils. Their motives for adopting that policy are readily intelligible, even if the merits of the policy may seem still open to discussion. At all events, their teaching has not been forgotten; it has been transmitted by secret initiation to men of our own time, and while its methods and its practical achievements remain secrets in their hands, it is open to any patient and earnest student of the question to satisfy himself that these methods are of supreme efficacy, and these achievements far more admirable than any yet standing to the credit of modern science. For the secrecy in which these operations have been shrouded has never disguised their existence, and it is only in our own time that this has been forgotten. Formerly at great public ceremonies, the initiates displayed the powers with which their knowledge of natural laws invested them. We carelessly assume that the narratives of such displays describe performances of magic : we have decided that there is no such thing as magic, therefore the narratives must have been false, the persons whom they refer to, impostors. But supposing that magic of old was simply the science of"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"INTR ODUC TION. magi, of learned men, there is no magic, in the modern sense, left in the matter. And supposing that such science — even in ancient times ah-eady the product of long ages of study — had gone in some directions further than our much younger modern science has yet reached, it is reasonable to conclude that some displays in connection with ancient mysteries may have been strictly scientific experiments, though they sound like displays of magic, and would look like displays of magic for us now if they could be repeated. On that hypothesis, modern sagacity applying modern knowledge to the subject of ancient mysteries, may be merely modern folly evolving erroneous conclusions from modern ignorance. But there is no need to construct hypotheses in the matter. The facts are accessible if they are sought for in the right way, and the facts are these : The wisdom of the ancient world — science and rehgion commingled, physics and meta- physics combined — was a reaUty, and it still survives. It is that which will be spoken of in these pages as Occult Philosophy. It was already a complete system of knowledge that had been cultivated in secret, and handed down to initiates for ages, before its professors performed experi- ments in public to impress the popular mind in Egypt and Greece. Adepts of occultism in the present day are capable of performing similar experiments, and of exhibiting results that prove them immeasurably further advanced than ordi- nary modern science in a comprehension of the forces of Nature. Furthermore, they inherit from their great pre- decessors a science which deals not merely with physics, but mtli the constitution and capacities of the human soul and spirit. Modern science has discovered the circulation of the blood ; occult science understands the circulation of the life-principle. Modern physiology deals with the body only ; occultism with the soul as well— not as the subject of vague, religious rhapsodies ; but as an actual entity, vv-ith properties that can be examined in combination with, or apart from, those of the body. It is chiefly in the East that occultism is still kept up — in India and in adjacent countries. It is in India that I have encountered it ; and this little volume is written to describe the experiences I have enjoyed, and to retail the knowledge I have acquri-ed. B 2"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE OCCULT WORLD. II. My narrative of events must be preceded by some further genei-al explanations, or it would be unintelligil)le. The identity of occultism as practised in all ages, must be kept in vieAv, to account for the magnitude of its organization, and for the astounding discovery that secluded Orientals may understand more about electricity than Faraday, more about physics than Tyndall. The culture of Europe has been developed by Europeans for themselves \\\\dthin the last few hundred years. The culture of occultists is the growi^h of vast periods long anterior to these, when civiliza- tion inhabited the East. And during a career which has carried occultism in the domain of physical science far beyond the point we have reached, physical science has merely been an object for occultism of secondary import- ance. Its main strength has been devoted to meta- physical inquiry, and to the latent psychological faculties in man, faculties which, in their development, enable the occultist to obtain actual experimental knowledge concerning the soul's condition of extra-corporeal existence. There is thus something more than a mere archasological interest in the identification of the occult system with the doctrines of the initiated organizations in all ages of the world's history, and we are presented by this identification with the key to the philosophy of religious development. Occultism is not merely an isolated discovery showing humanity to be possessed of certain powers over Nature, which the narrower study of Nature from the merely materialistic standpoint has failed to develop ; it is an illumination cast over all previous spiritual speculation worth anything, of a kind which knits together some apparently divergent systems. It is to spiritual pliilosophy much what Sanscrit was found to be to comparative philology; it is a common stock of philosophical roots. Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism and the Egyptian theology are thus brought into one family of ideas. Occultism, as it is no new invention, is no specific sect, but the professors of no sect can afford to disjDense with the side-lights it throws upon the conception of Nature and Man's destinies which they may have been induced by their own specific faith to form ; occultism, in fact, must be recognized by any one who will take the trouble to put"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION. before his mind clearly the problems with which it deals, as a study of the most sublime importance to every man who cares to live a life worthy of his human rank in creation, and who can realise the bearing on ethics of cer- tain knowledge concerning his own survival after death. It is one thing to follow the lead of a hazy impression that a life beyond the grave, if there is one, may be somehow benefitted by abstinence from wrong-doing on this side ; it will clearly be another to realize, if that can be shown to be the case, that the life beyond the grave must, with the certainty of a sum-total built up of a series of plus and minus quantities, be the final expression of the use made of opportunities in this. I have said that the startling importance of occult know- ledge turns on the manner in which it affords exact and experimental knowledge concerning sj^iritual things wliich under all other systems must remain the subject of specu- lation or blind religious faith. It may be further asserted that occultism shows that the harmony and smooth con- tinuity of Nature observable in physics extend to those operations of Nature that are concerned with the phenomena of metaphysical existence. Before approaching an exposition of the conclusions con- cerning the nature of man that occult philosophy has reached, it may be worth while to meet an objection that may perhaps be raised by the reader on the threshold of the subject. How is it that conclusions of such great weight have been kept the secret property of a jealous body of initiates'? Is it not a law of progress that truth asserts itself and courts the free air and hght % Is it reasonable to suppose that the greatest of all truths— the fundamental basis of truth concerning man and Nature — should be afraid to show itself? With what object could the ancient professors of, or proficients in, occult philosophy keep the priceless treasures of their researches to themselves % Now, it is no business of mine to defend the extreme tenacity with which the proficients in occultism have hitherto not only barred out the world from the knowledge of their knowled.o^e, but have almost left it in ignorance that such knowledge exists.

Nor would it be wiser to say that the reticence of the occultists so far discredits anything we may now be told about their acquirements. When the sun is actually shining it is no use to say that its hglit is discredited by the behaviour of the barometer yesterday. I have to deal, in discussing the acquirements of occultism, with facts that have actually taken place, and nothing can discredit what is known to be true. No doubt it will be worth while later on to examine the motives which have rendered the occultists of all ages so profoundly reserved. And there may be more to say in justification of the course that has been pursued than is visible at the first glance. Indeed, the reader will not go far in an examination of the nature of the powers which proficients in occultism actually possess, without seeing that it is supremely desirable to keep back the practical exercise of such powers from the w^orld at large. But it is one thing to deny mankind generally the key which unlocks the mystery of occult power ; it is another to withhold the fact that there is a mystery to unlock. However, the fur- ther discussion of that question here would be premature. Enough for the present to take note of the fact that secrecy after all is not complete if external students of the subject are enabled to learn as much about the mysteries as I shall have to tell. Manifestly, there is a great deal more behind, but, at all events, a great deal is to be learned by inquirers who will set to work in the right way. And that which may now be learned is no new revelation at last capriciously extended to the outer world for the first time. In former periods of history, a great deal more has been known about the nature of occultism by the world at large than is known at this moment to the modern West. The bigotry of modern civilization, and not the jealousy of the occultist, is to blame if the European races are at this moment more generally ignorant of the extent to which psychological research has been carried, than the Egyptian populace in the past, or the people of India in the present day. As regards the latter, amongst whom the truth of the theory just suggested can easily be put to the test, you will find the great majority of Hindoos perfectly convinced of the truth of the main statements which I am about to"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION. put forward. They do not generally or readily talk about such subjects with Europeans, because these are so j^rone to stupid derision of views they do not understand or believe in already. The Indian native is very timid in presence of such ridicule. But it does not affect in the slightest degree the l^eliefs which rest in his own mind on the fundamental teaching he will always have received, and in many cases on odds and ends of experiences he may himself have had. The Hindoos are thus well aware, as a body, of the fact that there are persons who by entire devotion to certain modes of life acquire unusual powers in the nature of such as Europeans would very erroneously call sujDernatural. They are quite famihar with the notion that such j^ersons live secluded lives, and are inaccessible to ordinary curiosity ; and also with the fact that they are none the less approach- able by lit and determined candidates for admission to occult training. Ask any cultivated Hindoo if he has ever heard of Mahatmas and Yog Vidya or occult science, and it is a hundred to one that you will find he has — and, unless he happens to be a hybrid product of an Anglo-Indian University, that he fully believes in the reality of the powers ascribed to Yoga. It does not follow that he will at once say \" Yes\" to a European asking the question. He will probably say just the reverse, from the apprehension I have spoken of above ; but push your questions home and you will discover the truth, as I did, for example, in the case of a very intelligent English-speaking native vakeel in an influential position, and in constant relations with high European officials, last year. At first my new acquaintance met my inquiries as to whether he knew anything about these subjects with a wooden look of complete ignorance, and an explicit denial of any knowledge as to what I meant at all. It was not till the second time I saw him in private, at my own house, that by degrees it grew upon him that I was in earnest, and knew something about Yoga myself, and then he quietly opened out his real thoughts on the subject, and showed me that he knew not only perfectly well what I meant all along, but was stocked with information concerning occurrences and phenomena of an occult or apparently supernatui-al order, many of which had been observed in his own family and some by himself. The point of all tliis is that Europeans are not justified"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE OCCULT WORLD. in attributing to the jealousy of the occultists the absolute and entire ignorance of all that concerns them which per- vades the modern society of the West. The West has been occupied with the business of material progress to the ex- clusion of psychological development. Perhaps it has done best for the world in confining itself to its speciality; but however this may be, it has only itself to blame if its concentration of purpose has led to something like retro- gression in another branch of development. Jacolliot, a French writer, who has dealt at great length with various phases of Spiritism in the East, was told by one who must have been an adept to judge by the language used ; \" You have studied physical Nature, and j^ou have obtained through the laws of Nature marvellous results — steam, electricity, etc. <fec. For twenty thousand years or more we have studied the intellectual forces ; we have dis- covered their laws, and we obtain, by making them act alone or in concert with matter, phenomena still more astonishing than your own.\" JacolHot adds: \"We have seen things such as one does not describe for fear of making his readers doubt his intelligence .... but still we have seen them.\" III. Occult phenomena must not be confused with the phe- nomena of sjDiritualism. The latter, whatever they may be, are manifestations which mediums can neither control nor understand. The former are achievements of a conscious, li\\dng operator comprehending the laws with which he Avorks. If these achievements appear miraculous that is the fault of the observer's ignorance. The spiritualist knows perfectly well, in spite of ignorant mockery on the part of outsiders content to laugh without knowing what they are laughing at, that all kinds of apparently supernatural occurrences do constantly take place for inquirers who hunt them with sufficient diligence. But he has never been able to get a clue to any other than a supernatural explanation of the causes at work. He has taken up a certain hypothesis fautG de mieux in the first instance, and working always on this idea, has constructed such an elaborate edifice of theory round the facts that he is very reluctant to tolerate the"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"introduction: interposition of a new hypothesis which will oblige him to reconstruct his views almost from the beginning. There will be no help for this, however, if he belongs to the order of inquirers who care rather to be sure they have laid hold of the truth than to fortify a doctrine they have espoused for better or for worse. Broadly speaking, there is scarcely one of the phenomena of spirituahsm that adepts in occultism cannot reproduce by the force of their own will, supplemented by a comprehension of the resources of Nature. As Avill be seen when I come to a direct narrative of my own experiences, I have seen some of the most familiar phenomena of spiritualism produced by purely human agency. The old original spirit-rap which introduced the mightier phenomena of spiritualism has been manifested for my edification in a countless variety of ways, and under conditions which render the hypothesis of any spiritual agency in the matter wholly preposterous. I have seen flowers fall from the blank ceiling of a room under circumstances that gave me a practical assurance that no spiritual agency w^as at work, though in a manner as absolutely \" supernatural\" in the sense of being produced without the aid of any material appliances as any of the floral showers by which some spiritual mediums are attended. I have over and over again received \" direct writing,\" produced on paper in sealed envelopes of my own, which w^as created or precipitated by a living human correspondent. I have information, which, though second-hand, is very trustworthy, of a great variety of other familiar spiritual phenomena produced in the same way by human adepts in occultism. But it is not my present task to make war on spiritualism. The announcements I have to make will, indeed, be probably received more readily among spiritualists than in the outer circles of the ordinary world, for the spiritualists are, at all events, aware, from their own experience, that the orthodox science of the day does not know the last word concerning mind and matter, while the orthodox outsider stupidly clings to a denial of facts when these are of a nature which he fore- sees himself unable to explain. As the facts of spiritualism, though accessible to any honest man who goes in search of them, are not of a kind which any one can carry about and fling in the faces of pragmatic \" sceptics\" these latter are enabled to keep up their professions of incredulity without"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"lo THE OCCULT WORLD. the foolishness of their position being obvious to each other, plain as it is to \" the initiated.\" However, although in this way the ordinary scientific mind will be reluctant to admit either the honesty of my testimony or the conceivabihty of my explanations, it may allay some hostile prejudices to make clear at the outset that occultism has nothing whatever to do with spiritualism — that \" the spirits\" count for nothing at all in any of the abnormal experiences I shall have to relate."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"OCCULTISM AND ITS ADEPTS.

This psychological telegraphy is wdiolly indej^endent of all mechanical conditions or appliances wdiatever. And the clairvoyant faculties of the adept are so perfect and complete that they amount to a species of omniscience as regards mundane affairs. The body is the prison of the soul for ordinary mortals. We can see merely what comes before its windows ; we can take cognisance only of what is brought within its bars. But the adept has found the key of his prison and can emerge from it at pleasure. It is no longer a prison for him — merely a dwelling. In other words, the • adept can project his soul, out of liis body to any place he Y pleases with the rapiclity of thought. The whole edifice of occultism from basement to roof is so utterly strange to ordinary conceptions that it is difficult to know how to begin an explanation of its contents. How could one describe a calculating machine to an audience unfamiliar wdth the simplest mechanical contrivances and knowing nothing of arithmetic % And the highly cultured classes of modern Europe as regards the achievements of occultism are, in spite of the perfection of their literary scholarship and the exquisite precision of their attainments in their own departments of science, in the position as regards occultism of knowing nothing about the A B C of the subject, nothing about the capacities of the soul at all as distinguished from the capacities of body and soul combined.

On charts that show the stream of history, the nations all intermingle more or less, except the Chinese, and that is shown coming down in a single river without affluents and without branches from out of the clouds of time. Suppose that civilized Europe had not come into contact with the Chinese till lately, and suppose that the Chinamen, very much brighter in intelligence than they really are, had developed some branch of physical science to the point it actually has reached with us ; suppose that particular branch had been entirely neglected amongst us, the surprise we should feel at taking up the Chinese discoveries in their refined development without having gradually grown familiar with their small beginnings would be very great. Now this is exactly the situation as regards occult science. The occultists have been a race apart from an earlier period than w& \"caii'fathom — not a separate race physically, not a uniform race physically at all, nor a nation in any sense of the word, but a continuous association of men of the highest intelligence linked together by a bond^^trojiger than any other tie of which mankind has experience, and carrying on with a perfect continuity of purpose the studies and traditions and mysteries of self-development handed dov^^n to them by their predecessors. All this time the stream of civilization, on the foremost waves of which the culture of modern Europe is floating, has been wholly and absolutely neglectful of the one study with which the occultists have been solely engaged. What wonder that the two lines of civilization have diverged so far apart that theii' forms are now entirely unhke each other. It remains to be seen Avhether this attempt to reintroduce the long-estranged cousins will be tolerated or treated as an impudent attempt to pass off* an impostor as a relation. I have said that the occultist can project. his soul frojQi his body. As an incidental discovery, it will be observed^ he has thus ascertained beyond all shadow of doubt that he really has got a soul. A comparison of myths has some- times been called the science of religion. If there can really be a science of religion it must necessarily be occultism. On the surface, perhaps, it may not be obvious that religious"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"OCCULTISM AND ITS ADEPTS. 15 truth must necessarily open out more completely to the soul as temporarily loosened from the body, than to the soul as taldng- cognisance of ideas through the medium of the phy- vsical senses. But to ascend into a realm of immateriaHty, Avhere cognition becomes a process of pure perception, while the intellectual faculties are in full play and centred in the immaterial man, must manifestly be conducive to an en- larged comprehension of religious truth. I have just spoken of the \" immaterial man\" as distin- guished from the body of the physical senses; but, so complex is the statement I have to make, than I must no sooner induce the reader to tolerate the phrase than I must reject it for the future as inaccurate. Occult philosophy has ascertained that the inner ethereal self, which is the man as distinguished from his body, is itself the envelojDe of something more ethereal still — is itself, in a subtle sense of the term, material. The majority of ci^dlized people believe that man has a soul which will somehow survive the dissolution of the \"Body^' but they have to confess tliat they do noAjknow very much about it. A good many of the most Inghly civHized, have grave doubts on the subject, and some think that researches in physics which have suggested the notion that even thought may be a mode of motion, tend to establish the strong probability of the hypothesis that when the life of the body is destroyed nothing else survives. Occult philosophy does not speculate about the matter at all ; it knows the state of the facts. St. Paul, who was an occultist, speaks of man as consti- tuted of body, soul, and spirit. The distinction is one that hardly fits in with the theory, that when a man dies his soul is translated to heaven or hell for ever. What, then, becomes of the spirit, and what .is., tlie i!pidt...as different, from the soul,_ on the ordinary hypothesis ? Orthodox tlimkers wcrk\" out each some theory on the subject for himself. Either that the soul is the seat of the emotions and the spirit of the intellectual faculties, or vice versd. No one can put such conjectures on a solid foundation, not even on the basis of an alleged revelation. But^St^.Paul-^.. was not indulging in vague fancies when he made use of the expression quoted. The spirit he was referring to may be described as the soul of the soul. With that for the f>lP-"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"14 THE OCCULT WORLD. moment we need not be concerned. The important 2^oint which occultism brings out is that the soul of man, while Komething enoi'mously subtler and more etliefeal and more lasting than the body, is itself a material reality. Not material as chemistry understands matter, IduT as ]ohysical science en bloc might understand it if the tentacul?e of each branch of science were to grow more sensitive and were to work more in harmony. It is no denial of the materiality of any hypothetical substance to say that one cannot de- termine its atomic weight and its affinities. The ether that transmits light is held to be material by any one who holds it to exist at all, but there is a gulf of difference between it and the thinnest of the gases. You do not always approach a scientific truth from the same direction. You may per- ceive some directly; you have to infer others indirectly; but these latter may not on that account be the less certain. The materiality of ether is inferable from the behaviour of light : the materiality of the soul may be inferable from its subjection to forces. A mesmeric influence is a force emanating from certain physical characteristics of the mes- merist. It impinges on the soul of the subject at a distance, and produces an effect perceptil)le to him, demonstrable to others. Of course this is an illustration and no proof. I must set forth as well as I am able — and that can but be very imperfectly — the discoveries of occultism without at first attempting the establishment by proof of each part of these discoveries. Further on, I shall be able to prove some parts at any rate, and others will then be recognized as indirectly established, too. The soul is material, and inheres in the ordinarily more grossly material body ; and it is this condition of things which enables the occultist to speak positively on the sub- ject, for he can satisfy himself at one coup that there is such a thing as a soul, and that it is material in its nature, by dissociating it from the body under some conditions, and restoring it again. The occultist can even do this some- times with other souls ; his piimary achievement, however, is to do so with his own. When I say that the occultist hioivs he has a soul I refer to this power. He knows it just as another man knows he has a great coat. He can put it from him, and render it manifest as something separate from himself. But remember that to him, when"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"OCCULTISM AND ITS ADEPTS. 15 the separation is effected, /^(3_is the soul and the thing put off is the body. And this is to attain nothing less than absolute certainty about the great problem of survival after death. The adept does not rely on faith, or on meta- physical speculation, in regard to the possibilities of his existence apart from the body. He experiences such an existence whenever he pleases, and although it may be allowed that the mere art of emancipating himself tem- porarily from the body would not necessarily inform him concerning his ultimate destinies after that emancipation should be final at death, it gives him, at all events, exact knowledge concerning the conditions under which he will start on his journey in the next world. While his body lives, his soul is, so to speak, a captive balloon (though with a very long, elastic, and imponderable cable). Captive ascents will not necessarily tell him whether the balloon will float when at last the machinery below breaks up, and he finds himself altogether adrift ; iDut it is sometliing to be an aeronaut already, before the journey begins, and to know ceftlti'nly, as''T~said'1bef 01^ nmf~tlrere\"are\"sucTi things as balloons, for certain emergencies, to sail in. There would be infinite grandeur in the faculty I have described alone, supposing that were the end of adept ship : but instead of being the end, it is more like the beginning. The seemingly magic feats which the adepts in occultism have the power to perform, are accomplished, I am given, to understand, by means of familiarity with a force in Nature which is referred to in Sanscrit writings as akas. \"Western science has done much in discovering some of the properties and powers of electricity. Occult science, ages before, had done much more in discovering the properties and powers of ahas. In \"The Coming Race,\" the late Lord Lytton, whose connection vdth occultism appears to have been closer than the world generally has yet realized, gives a fantastic and imaginative account of the wonders achieved in the world to which his hero penetrates, by means of Vril. In writing of Yril, Lord Lytton has clearly been poetising akas. \" The Coming Race\" is described as a people entirely unhke adepts in many essential particulars — as a complete nation, for one thing, of men and women all equally handling the powers, even from childhood, which — or some of which among others not described — the adepts"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"i6 THE OCCULT WORLD, liave conquered. This is a mere fairy-tale, founded on the achievements of occultism. But no one who has made a study of the latter can fail to see, can fail to recognize with a conviction amounting to certainty, that the author of \" The Coming Kace\" must have been familiar with the leading ideas of occultism, perhaps with a great deal more. The same evidence is afibrded by Lord Lytton's other novels of mysteiy, \" Zanoni,\" and \" The Strange Story.\" In \"Zanoni\" the sublime personage in the background, Mejnoui-, is intended plainly to be a great adejDt of Eastern occultism, exactly like those of whom I have to speak. It is difficult to know wdiy in this case, where Lord L}i:ton has manifestly intended to adhere much more closely to the real facts of occultism than in \" The Coming Kace,\" he should have represented Mejnour as a solitary survivor of the liosicrucian fraternity. The guardians of occult science are content to be a small body as compared with the tremendous importance of the knowledge which they save from perishing, but they have never allowed their numbers to diminish to the extent of being in any danger of ceasing to exist as an organized body on earth. It' is difficult, again, to understand why Lord Lytton, having learned so much as he certainly did, should have been content to use up his information merely as an ornament of fiction, instead of giving it to the world in a form which should claim more serious consideration. At all events, prosaic people will argue to that effect ; but it is not impossible that Lord Lytton himself had become, through long study of the subject, so permeated with the love of mystery which inheres in the occult mind apparently, that he preferred to throw out his information in a veiled and mystic shape, so that it w^ould be intelligible to readers in symj^athy with himself, and would blow unnoticed past the commonplace understanding without awakening the angry rejection wliich these pages, for example, if they are destined to attract any notice at all, will assuredly encounter at the hands of bigots in science,religion,andthegreatphilosopliy of the common-j3lace.

It is through his acquaintance with the properties of this force, that the adept can accomplish the physical phenomena which I shall presently be able to show are within his reach, besides others of far greater magnificence. II. _Wh,Q-ai^ the adepts who handle the tremendous forces of which I spgttki There is reason to believe that such adepts have existed in all historic ages, and there are such adepts in India at this moment, or in adjacent countries. The identity of the knowledge they have inherited, with that of ancient initiates in occultism, follows irresistibly from an examination of the views they hold and the faculties they exercise. The conclusion has to be worked out from a mass of literary evidence, and it will be enough to state it for the moment, pointing out the proper channels of research in the matter afterwards. For the present let us consider the position of the adepts as they now exist. -^They constitute a Brotherhood, or Secret; Association, which ramifies all over the East, but the principal seat of~ which for the present I gather to be in Thibet. But India has not yet been deserted by the adepts, and from that country they still receive many recruits. For the great fraternity is at once the least and the most exclusive organi- zation in the world, and fresh recruits from any race or country are welcome, provided they possess the needed qualifications. The door, as I have been told by one who is himself an adept, is always open to the right man who knocks, but the road that has to be travelled before the door is reached is one which none but very determined travellers can hope to pass. It is manifestly impossible that I can describe its perils in any but very general terms, but it is not necessary to have learned any secrets of initiation to understand the character of the training through which a neophyte must pass before he attains the dignity of a proficient in occultism. The adept is not made : he becomes, as I have been constantly assured, and the process of becoming is mainly in his own hands. Never, I believe, in less than seven years from the time c"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"1 8 THE OCCULT WORLD. at which a candidate for initiation is accepted as a proba- tioner, is he ever admitted to the very first of the ordeals, whatever they may be, which bar the way to the earhest degrees of occultism, and there is no security for him that the seven years may not be extended ad libitum. He has no security that he will ever be admitted to any initiation whatever. Nor is this appalling uncertainty, which would alone deter most Europeans, however keen upon the subject intellectually, from attempting to advance, themselves, into the domain of occultism, maintained from the mere caprice of a despotic society, coquetting, so to speak, with the eagerness of its wooers. The trials through which the neophjrfce has to pass are no fantastic mockeries, nor mimicries of awful peril. ISTor, do I take it, are they artificial barriers set up by the masters of occultism, to try the nerve of their pupils, as a riding-master might put up fences in his school. It is inherent in the nature of the science that has to be explored, that its revelations shall stagger the reason and try the most resolute courage. It is in his own interest that the candidate's character and fixity of purpose, and perhajDs his physical and mental attributes, are tested and watched with infinite care and patience in the first instance, before he is allowed to take the final plunge into the sea of strange experiences through which he must swim with the strength of his own right arm, or perish. As to what may be the nature of the trials that await him during the period of his development, it will be obvious that I can have no accurate knowledge, and conjectures based on fragmentary revelations picked up here and there are not worth recording, but as for the nature of the life led by the mere candidate for admission as a neophyte it will be equally plain that no secret is involved. The ultimate development of the adept requiies amongst other things a life of absolute physical purity, and the candidate must, from the beginning give practical evidence of his willingness to adopt this. He must, that is to say, for all the years of his probation, be perfectly chaste, perfectly abstemious, and indifferent to physical luxury of every sort. This regimen does not involve any fantastic discipline or obtrusive asceticism, nor withdrawal from the world. There would be nothing to prevent a gentleman in London society"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"OCCULTISM AND ITS ADEPTS. from being in full training for occult candidature without anybody about him being the wiser. For true occultism, the subhme attachment of the real adept, is not attained through the loathsome asceticism of the ordinary Indian fakeer, the yogi of the woods and wilds, whose dirt accumu- lates with his sanctity — of the fanatic who fastens iron hooks into his flesh, or holds up an arm until it is withered. An imperfect knowledge of some of the external facts of Indian occultism, will often lead to a misunderstanding on this point. Yog vidya is the Indian name for occult science, and it is easy to learn a good deal more than is worth learning about the practices of some misguided enthusiasts who cultivate some of its inferior branches by means of mere physical exercises. Properly speaking, this physical development is called Haiti yog, while the loftier sort, which is approached by the disciphne of the mind, and which leads to the high altitudes of occultism, is called Ragi yog. No person whom a real occultist would ever tliink of as an adept, has acquired his powers by means of the laborious and puerile exercises of the Hatti yog. I do not mean to say that these inferior exercises are altogether futile. They do invest the person who pursues them with some abnormal faculties and powers. Many treatises have been written to describe them, and many people who have lived in India will be able to relate curious experiences they have had with proficients in this extraordinary craft. I do not wish to fill these pages with tales of wonder that I have had no means of sifting, or it would be easy to coUect examples ; but the point to insist on here is that no story any one can have heard or read which seems to put an ignoble, or petty, or low-minded aspect on Indian yogeeism can have any applica- tion to the ethereal yogeeism which is called Ragi yog, and which leads to the awful heights of true adeptsliip. c 2"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"20 THE OCCULT WORLD. THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY. Secret as the occult organization has always remained, there \"is a good deal more to be learned concerning the philosophical views which it has preserved or acquired than might be supposed at the first glance. As my own experi- ence when fully described Avill show, the great adepts of occultism themselves have no repugnance to the dissemina- tion of their religious philosophy so far as a world untrained as ours is in pure psychological investigation can profit by such teaching. Nor even are they unconquerably averse to the occasional manifestation of those superior powers over the forces of Nature to which their extraordinary researches have led them. The many apparently miraculous pheno- mena which I have witnessed through occult agency could never have been exhibited if the general rule which pre- cludes the Brothers from the exhibition of their powers to uninitiated persons were absolute. As a general rule, indeed, the display of any occult phenomenon for the pur- pose of exciting the wonder and admiration of beholders is strictly forbidden. And indeed I should imagine that such prohibition is absolute if there is no higher purpose involved. But it is plain that with a purely philanthropic desire to spread the credit of a philosophical system which is enno- bling in its character, the Brothers may sometimes wdsely permit the display of abnormal phenomena when the minds to which such an appeal is made may be likely to rise from the appreciation of the wonder to a befitting respect for the philosophy which it accredits. And the history of ^ the Theosophical Society has been an expansion of this idea. That history has been a chequered one, because the pheno- mena that have been displayed have often failed of their efiect, have sometimes become the subject of a premature publicity, and have brought down on the study of occult philosophy as regarded from the point of view of the outer"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY. world, and on the devoted persons who have been chiefly identified with its encouragement by means of the Theoso- phical Society, a great deal of stupid ridicule and some malevolent persecution. It may be asked why the Brothers if they are really the great and all-powerful persons I represent them, have permitted indiscretions of the kind referred to, but the inquiry is not so embarrassing as it may seem at the first glance. If the picture of the Brothe/s that I have endeavoured to present to the reader has been appreciated rightly, it will show them less accurately quali- fied, m spite of their powers, than persons of lesser occult development, to carry on any undertaking which involves direct relations with a multiplicity of ordinary people in the common-place world. I gather the primary purpose of the Brotherhood to be something very unlike the task I am engaged m, for example, at this moment— the endeavour to convince the public generally that there really are faculties latent m humanity capable of such extraordinary develop- ment, that they carry us at a bound to an immense distance beyond the dreams of physical science in reference to the comprehension of Nature, and at the same time aiford us positive testimony concerning the constitution and destinies of the human soul. That is a task on which it is reasonable to suppose the Brothers would cast a sympathetic glance ; but it will be obvious on a moment's reflection, that their primary duty must be to keep ahve the actuality of that knowledge, and of those powers concerning which I am merely giving some shado\\^y account. If the Brothers were to employ themselves on the large, rough business of hacking away at the incredulity of a stoUd multitude at the acrimonious increduhty of the materiahstic phalanx' at the terrified and indignant increduhty of the orthodox rehgious world, it is conceivable that they might— ^;ro«^eV mtam vivendi perdere mztsas— suffer the occult science itself to decay for the sake of persuading mankind that it did really exist. Of course it might be suggested that division of labour might be possible in occultism as in everythino- else, and that some adepts qualified for the work might be told off\" for the purpose of breakmg down the increduhty of modern science, while the others would carry on the primary duties of their career in their own beloved seclusion. But a suggestion of this kind, however practical it may sound to"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"22 THE OCCULT WORLD. a practical world, would probably present itself as eminently impractical to the true mystic. To begin with, an aspirant for occult honours does not go through the tremendous and prolonged effort required to win him success, in order at the end of all things to embrace a life in the midst of the ordinary world, which on the hypothesis of his success in occultism must necessarily be repugnant to him in the extreme. Probably there is not one real adept wdio does not look wdth greater aversion and repugnance on any life except a life of seclusion, than we of the outer world would look on the notion of being buried alive in a remote moun- tain fastness where no foot or voice from the outer world could penetrate. I shall very soon be able to show that the love of seclusion, inherent in adeptship, does not imply a mind vacant of the knowledge of European culture and manners. It is, on the contrary, compatible with an amount of European culture and experience that people acquainted merely with the common-place aspects of Eastern life will be surprised to find possible in the case of a man of Oriental birth. Now, the imaginary adept told off\" on the suggestion I am examining, to show the scientific world that there are realms of knowledge it has not yet explored and faculties attainable to man that it has not yet dreamed of possessing, would have to be either appointed to discharge that duty, or to volunteer for it. In the one case we have to assume that the occult fraternity is despotic in its treatment of its members in a manner wliich all my observation leads me to believe it certainly: is not; in the other, we have to suppose some adept making a voluntary sacrifice of what he regards as not only the most agreeable but also the higher Hfe — for what % for the sake of accom- plishing a task which he does not regard as of very great importance — relatively, at any rate, to that other task in which he may take a part — the perj^etuation and perhaps the development of the great science itself. But I do not care to follow the argument any further, because it will come on for special treatment in a different way presently. Enough for the moment to indicate that there are considera- tions against the adoption of that method of persuasion which, as far as the judgment of ordinary people would go, would seem the best suited to the introduction of occult truths to modern intelligence."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE TBEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY. 23 And these considerations appear to have prompted the acceptance, by the Brothers, of the Theosophical Society as a more or less imperfect, but still the best available agency for the performance of a piece of work, in which, without being actually prepared to enter on it themselves, they nevertheless take a cordial interest. And what are the peculiar conditions which render the Theosophical Society, the organization and management of which have been faulty in many ways, the best agency hitherto available for the propagation of occult truths? The zeal and quahfications of its founder, Madame Blavatsky, give the explanation required. It is obvious that to give any countenance or support at all to a society concerned with the promulgation of occult philosophy, it was necessary for the Brothers to be in occult communica- tion with it in some way or other. For it must be remem- bered that though it may seem to us a very amazing and impossible thing to sit still at home and impress our thoughts upon the mind of a distant friend by an effort of will, a Brother living in an unknown Himalayan retreat is not only able to converse as freely as he likes with any of his friends who are initiates like himself, in whatever part of the world they may happen to be, but would find any other modes of communication, such as those with which the crawHng faculties of the outer world have to be content, simply intolerable in their tedium and inefiicacy. Besides, he must, to be able to afford assistance to any society having its sphere of operations among people in the world, be able to hear from it with the same facihty that he can send communications to it. So there must be an initiate at the other end of the h'ne. Finally, the occult rules evidently require this last-named condition, or, what amounts to the same thing, forbid arrangements wliich can only be avoided on this condition. Now, Madame Blavatsky is an initiate — is an adept to the extent of possessing this magnificent power of psycho- logical telegraphy Avith her occult friends. That she has stopped short of that further development in adeptship that would have tided her right over the boundary between this and the occult world altogether, is the circumstance which has rendered her assumption of the task with which the Theosophical Society's is concerned, compatible with the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"24 THE OCCULT WORLD. considerations pointed out above as operating to prevent the assumption of such a duty by a full adept. As regards the supremely essential characteristic, she has, in fact, been exactly suited to the emergency. How it came to pass that her occult training carried her as far as it did and no further, is a question into which it is fruitless to inquire, because the answer w^ould manifestly entail explanations which would impinge too closely on the secrets of initiation which are never disclosed under any circumstances what- ever. After all, she is a woman, — though her powerful mind, widely if erratically cultivated, and perfectly daunt- less courage proved among other ways on the battle-field, but more than by any bravery with bullets, by her occult initiation, renders the name, connoting what it ordinarily does, rather absurd in application to her, — and this has, perhaps, barred her from the highest degrees in occultism that she might otherwise have attained. At all events, after a course of occult study carried on for seven years in a Himalayan retreat, and crowning a devotion to occult pursuits extending over five-and-thirty or forty j^ears, Madame Blavatsky reappeared in the world, dazed, as she met ordinary people going about in commonplace, benighted ignorance concerning the wonders of occult science, at the mere thought of the stupendous gulf of experience that separated her from them. She could hardly at first bear to associate with them, for thinking of all she knew that they did not know and that she was bound not to reveal. Any one can understand the burden of a great secret, but the burden of such a secret as occultism, and the burden of great powers only conferred on condition that their exercise should be very strictly circumscribed by rule, must have been trying indeed. Circumstances — or to put the matter more plainly, the guidance of friends from wdiom, though she had left them behind in the Himalayas on her return to Europe, she was no longer in danger of separation, as we understand the term, induced her to visit America, and there, assisted by some other j^ersons whose interest in the subject was kindled by occasional manifestations \" of her extraordinary powers, and notably by Colonel Olcott, its Hfe-devoted President, she founded the Theosophical Society, the objects of which, as originally defined, were to explore the latent"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY. psychological powers of man, and the ancient Oriental literature in which the clue to these may be hidden, and in which the philosophy of occult science may be partly discovered. The Society took root readily in America, while branches were also formed in England and elsewhere ; but, leaving these to take care of themselves, Madame Blavatsky ultimately returned to India, to establish the Society there among the natives, from whose natural hereditary sympathies with mysticism it was reasonable to expect an ardent sympathy with a psychological enterprize which not only appealed to their intuitive behef in the reality of yog vidya, but also to their best patriotism, by exhibiting India as the fountain-head of the highest, if the least known and the most secluded, culture in the world. Here, however, began the practical blunders in the management of the Theosopliical Society which led to the incidents referred to above, as having given it, so far, a chequered career. Madame Blavatsky, to begin with, was wholly unfamihar with the everyday side of Indian life, her previous visits having brought her only into contact with groups of people utterly unconnected with the current social system and characteristics of the country. Nor could she have undertaken a worse preparation for Indian life than that supplied by a residence of some years in the United States. This sent her out to India unfurnished with the recommendations which she could readily have obtained in England, and poisoned her mind with an absolutely erroneous and prejudiced conception of the cha- racter of the British ruling classes of India and their relations with the people. India and the United States are a good way apart geographically, but they are even more completely separated in other ways. The consequence was that Madame Blavatsky, on her first arrival in India, ado23ted an attitude of obtrusive sympathy with the natives of the soil as compared with the Europeans, seeking their society in a manner which, coupled with the fact that she made none of the usual advances to European societ}^, and with her manifestly Russian name, had the effect not unnaturally of rendering her suspecte to the rather clumsy organization which in India attempts to combine, with sundry others, the functions of a political poHce. These"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"26 THE OCCULT WORLD. suspicions, it is true, were allayed almost as soon as tliey were conceived, but not before Madame Blavatsky bad been made for a sbort time the object of an esinonage so awkward that it became grossly obvious to herself and roused her indignation to fever heat. To a more phlegmatic nature the incident would have been little more than amusing, but all accidents combined to develop trouble. A Russian by birth, though naturalized in the United States, Madame Blavatsky is probably more sensitive than an Enghsh woman less experienced in political espionage would be to the insult involved in being taken for a spy. Then the inner consciousness of having, for enthusiasm in the purely intellectual or spiritual enterprise to which she had devoted her life, renounced the place in society to which her distin- guished birth and family naturally entitled her,* probably intensified the bitterness of her indignation, at finding the sacrifice not only unappreciated, but turned against her, and regarded as justifying a foul suspicion. At all events, the circumstances acting on an excitable temperament led her to make public protests which caused it to be widely kno^vll by natives as well as by Europeans, that she had been looked at askance by Government authorities. And this idea for a time impeded the success of her work. Nothing can be done in India without a European impulse in the beginning; at all events, it handicaps any enterprise frightfully to be without such an impulse if native co-opera- tion is required. Not that the Theosophical Society failed to get members. The natives were flattered at the attitude towards them taken up by their new \" European\" friends, as Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott were no doubt generally regarded in spite of their American nationality, and showed a shallow eagerness to become Theosophists. But their ardour did not always prove durable, and in some few cases they showed a lamentable want of earnestness by breaking away from the Society altogether. Meanwhile, Madame Blavatsky began to make friends amongst the Europeans, and in 1880 visited Simla, where she began late in the day to approach her work from the right direction. Again, however, some mistakes were made which have retarded the establishment of the Theosophical Society, as far as India is concerned, on the dignified footing * See Preface."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY. 27 that it ought to occupy. A great many wonderful j^heno- mena were manifested in the presence at various times of a great many people ; but proper safeguards were not taken to avert the great danger that must always attend such a method of recommending occult science to public notice. It is beyond dispute that phenomena, exhibited under thoroughly satisfactory conditions to persons intelHgent enough to comprehend their significance, create an effect in awakening a tliirst for the study of occult philosophy that no other appeal can produce. But it is equally true, though at the first glance this may not be so apparent, that to minds quite unprepared by previous training to grasp the operation of occult forces, the most perfectly unimpeachable phenomenon Avdll be received rather as an insult to the understanding than as a proof of the operation of occult power. This is especially the case with persons of merely average intelHgence, whose faculties cannot stand the shock of a sudden appeal to an entirely new set of ideas. The strain is too great ; the new chain of reasoning breaks, and the commonplace observer of abnormal occurrences reverts to his original frame of stohd increduUty, perfectly unaware of the fact that a revelation of priceless intellectual impor- tance has been offered to him and has been misunderstood. Nothing is commoner than to hear people say : \" I can't believe in the reality of a phenomenal occurrence unless I see it for myself. Show it me and I shall believe in it, but not till then.\" Many people who say this are quite mis- taken as to what they would believe if the occurrence were shown to them. I have over and over again seen pheno- mena of an absolutely genuine nature pass before the eyes of people unused to investigating occurrences of the kind, and leave no impression behind beyond an irritated convic- tion that they were somehow being taken in. Just this happened in some conspicuous instances at Simla, and it is needless to say that many as were the phenomena that Madame Blavatsky produced, or was instrumental in pro- ducing, during the visit to which I am referring, the number of people in the place who had no opportunity of seeing them was considerably greater than that of the witnesses. And for these, as a rule, the whole series of incidents presented itself simply as an imposition. It was nothing to the purpose for the holders of this theory that"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"28 THE OCCULT WORLD. there was a glaring absence from the whole business of any motive for imposture, that a considerable grouj) of persons whose testimony and capacity would never have been impugned had any other matter been under discussion, were emphatic in their declarations as to the complete reality of the phenomena that had been displayed. The commonplace mind could not assimilate the idea that it was face to face Avith a new revelation in Nature, and any hypothesis, no matter how absurd and illogical in its details, was preferable for the majority to the simple grandeur of the truth. On the whole, therefore, as Madame Blavatsky became a celebrity in India, her relations with European society were intensified. She made many friends, and secured some ardent converts to a belief in the reality of occult powers ; but she became the innocent object of bitter animosity on the part of some other acquaintances, who, unable to assimi- late what they saw in her presence, took up an attitude of disbelief, wliich deepened into positive enmity as the whole subject became enveloped in a cloud of more or less excited controversy. And it is needless to say that many of the newspapers made great capital out of the whole situation, ridicuhng Madame Blavatsky 's dupes, and twisting every bit of information that came out about her phenomena into the most ludicrous shape it could be made to assume. Mockery of that sort was naturally expected by English friends who avowed their belief in the reahty of Madame Blavatsky's powers, and probably never gave one of them a moment's serious annoyance. But for the over-sensitive and excitable person cliiefly concerned they were indescribably tormenting, and eventually it grew doubtful whether her patience would stand the strain put upon it; whether she would not relinquish altogether the ungrateful task of inducing the w^orld at large to accept the good gifts which she had •devoted her life to offering them. Hajipily, so far, no catastrophe has ensued; but no history of Columbus in chains for discovering a new world, or Galileo ui prison for announcing the true principles of astronomy, is more remarkable for those who know all the bearings of the situation in India, as regards the Theosophical Society, than the sight of Madame Blavatsky, slandered and lidiculed by"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY. 29 most of the Anglo-Indian papers, and spoken of as a char- latan by the commonplace crowd, in return for having freely- offered them some of the wonderful fruits — as much as the rules of the great occult association permit her to offer — of the life-long struggle in w^hich she has conquered her extraordinary knowledge. In spite of all this, meanwhile, the Theosophical Society remains the one organization wliich supplies to inquirers who thirst for occult knowledge a link of communication, however sKght, with the great fraternity in the background which takes an interest in its progress, and is accessible to its founder."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THE OCCULT WORLD. RECENT OCCULT PHENOMENA. It has been through my connection with the Theosophical Society and my acquaintance with Madame Blavatsky that I have obtained experiences in connection with occultism, which have prompted me to undertake my present task. The first problem I had to solve was whether Madame Blavatsky really did, as I heard, possess the power of pro- ducing abnormal phenomena. And it may he imagined that, on the assumption of the reality of her phenomena, nothing would have been simpler than to obtain such satis- faction when once I had formed her acquaintance. It is, however, an illustration of the embarrassments which sur- round all inquiries of this nature — embarrassments with which so many people grow impatient, to the end that they cast inquiry altogether aside and remain wholly ignorant of the truth for the rest of their lives — that although on the first occasion of my making Madame Blavatsky's acquain- tance she became a guest at my house at Allahabad, and remained there for six weeks, the harvest of satisfaction I was enabled to obtain during this time w^as exceedingly small. Of course I heard a great deal from her during the time mentioned about occultism and the Brothers, but w^hile she was most anxious that I should understand the situation thoroughly, and I was most anxious to get at the truth, the difiiculties to be overcome were almost insuper- able. For the Brothers, as already described, have an unconquerable objection to showing off*. That the person w^ho mshes them to show off\" is an earnest seeker of truth, and not governed by mere idle curiosity, is nothing to the purpose. They do not want to attract candidates for initiation by an exhibition of wonders. Wonders have a very spirit-stirring effect on the history of every religion founded on miracles, but occultism is not a pursuit which people can safely take up in obedience to the impulse of"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"RECENT OCCULT PHENOMENA. 31 enthusiasm created by witnessing a display of extraordinary power. There is no absokite rule to forbid the exhibition of powers in presence of the outsider ; but it is cleai-ly dis- approved of by the higher authorities of occultism on principle, and it is practically impossible for less exalted proficients to go against this disapproval. It was only the very slightest of all imaginable phenomena that, during her first visit to my house, Madame Blavatsky was thus j^er- mitted to exhibit freely. She was allowed to show that \"raps\" like those which spiritualists attribute to spirit agency, could be produced at will. This was something, and/fm^e de mieux we paid great attention to raps. Spiritualists are aware that when groups of people sit round a table and put their hands upon it, they will, if a \" medium\" be present, generally hear little knocks which respond to questions and spell out messages. The large outer circle of persons who do not believe in spiritualism are fain to imagine that all the rnilHons who do are duped as regards this impression. It must sometimes be trouble- some for them to account for the wide development of the delusion, but any theory, they think, is preferable to admit- ting the possibility that the spirits of deceased persons can communicate in this way; or, if they take the scientific view of the matter, that a physical effect, however slight, can be produced mthout a physical cause. Such persons ought to welcome the explanations I am now giving, tending as these do to show that the theory of universal self-decep- tion as regards spirit-rapping, which must be rather an awkward theory for any one but a ludicrously conceited objector to hold, is not the only one by means of which the asserted facts of spirituaHsm — those with which we are now dealing at all events — can be reconciled with a reluctance to accept the spiritual hypothesis as the explanation. Now, I soon founcl out not only that raps would always come at a table at which Madame Blavatsky sat with the view of obtaining such results, but that all conceivable hypotheses of fraud in the matter were rapidly disposed of by a comparison of the various experiments we were able to make. To begin with, there was no necessity for other people to sit at the table at all. We could work with any table under any circumstances, or without a table at all. A window-pane would do equally well, or the wall, or any"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE OCCULT WORLD. door, or anytliing whatever wliich could give out a sound if hit. A half glass door put ajar was at once seen to be a very good instrument to choose, because it was easy to stand opposite JMadame Blavatsky in this case, to see her bare hands or hand (without any rings) resting motionless on the pane, and to hear the little ticks come plainly, as if , made with the point of a pencil or with the sound of electric sparks passing from one knob of an electrical ajDparatus to another. Another very satisfactory way of obtaining the j.jipg — one frequently employed in the evening — was to set down a large glass clockshade on the hearth-rug, and get Madame Blavatsky, after removing all rings from her hands, and sitting well clear of the shade so that no part of her dress touched it, to lay her hands on ;it. Putting a lamp on the ground opposite, and sitting down on the hearthrug, one could see the under surfaces of the hands resting on the glass, and still under these perfectly satis- factory conditions the raps would come, clear and distinct, on the sonorous surface of the shade. It was out of Madame Blavatsky's power to give an exact explanation as to how these raps w^ere produced. Every effort of occult power is connected with some secret or other, and slight, regarded in the light of phenomena, as the raps were, they were physical effects produced by an effort of will, and the manner in which the will can be trained to produce physical effects may be too uniform, as regards great and small phenomena, to be made, in accordance with the rules of occultism the subject of exact explanations to uninitiated persons. But the fact that the raps were obedient to the will was readily put beyond dispute, in this way amongst others : working with the window-pane or the clockshade, I would ask to have a name spelled out, mentioning one at random. Then I would call over the alphabet, and at the right letters the raps would come. Or I would ask for a definite number of raps, and they would come. Or for a series of raps in some defined rh^iihmical progression, and they would come. Nor was this all. Madame Blavatsky would sometimes put her hands, or one only, on some one else's head, and make the raps come, audibly to an attentive listener and perceptibly to the person touched, wdio would feel each little shock exactly as if he Tv^ere talcing sparks off the conductor of an electrical machine."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"RECENT OCCULT PHENOMENA: \\ At a later stage of my inquiries I obtained raps under better circumstances again than these — namely, without contact between the object on which they were produced and Madame Blavatsky's hands at all. This was at Simla in the summer of last year (1880), but I may as well anticipate a Httle as far as the raps are concerned. At Simla Madame Blavatsky used to produce the raps on a little table set in the midst of an attentive group, with no one touching it at all. After starting it, or charging it with some influence by resting her hands on it for a few moments, she would hold one about a foot above it and make mesmeric passes at it, at each of which the table would yield the familiar sound. Nor was this done only at our own house with our own tables. The same thing would be done at friends' houses, to which Madame Blavatsky accomj)anied us. And a further development of the head exjDeriment was this : It was found to be j^ossible for several persons to feel the same rap simultaneously. Four or five persons used sometimes to put their hands in a pile, one on another on a table ; then Madame Blavatsky would put hers on the top of the pile and cause a current, or wdiatever it is which prodvices the sound, to pass through the whole series of hands, felt by each simultaneously, and record itself in a rap on the table beneath. Any one who has ever taken part in forming such a pile of hands must feel as to some of the hypotheses concerning the raps that have been put forward in the Indian papers by determined sceptics — hard-headed persons not to be taken in — to the effect that the raps are produced by Madame Blavatsky's thumb-nails or by the cracking of some joint — that such hypotheses are rather idiotic. Summing up the argument in language which I used in a letter written at the time, it stands as follows : \" Madame Blavatsky puts her hands on a table and raps are heard on it. Some wiseacre suggests she does it with her thumb- nails ; she puts only one hand on the table ; the raps come still. Does she conceal any artifice under her hand % She lifts her hand from the table altogether, and merely holding it in the air above, the raps still come. Has she done any- thing to the table % She puts her hand on a window-pane, on a picture frame, on a dozen different places about the room in succession, and from each in turn come the"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"34 THE OCCULT WORLD. mysterious raps. Is the house where she stays with her own particular friends about her prepared all over % She goes to half a dozen other houses at Simla and produces raps at them all. Do the raps really come from somewhere else than where they seem to come from — are they perhaps ventriloquism % She puts her hand on your head, and from the motionless fingers you feel something which resembles a minute series of electric shocks, and an attentive listener besides you will hear them producing little raps on your skull. Are you telling a lie when you say you feel the shocks % Half a dozen people put their hands one on the other in a pile on the table ; Madame Blavatsky puts hers on the top of all, and each person feels the little throbs pass through, and hears them record themselves in faint raps on the table on which the pile of hands is resting. When a person has seen all these experiments many times, as I have, what impression do you think is made on his mind by a person who says, ' there is nothing in raps but conjuring — Maskelyne and Cooke can do them for ;£\"io a night f Maskelyne and Cooke cannot do them for ^lo a night nor for ten lakhs a night under the circumstances I describe.\" The raps even as I heard them during the first visit that Madame Blavatsky paid us at Allahabad, gave me a com- plete assurance that she was in possession of some faculties of an abnormal character. And this assurance lent a cre- dibility, that would not otherwise have belonged to them, to one or two phenomena of a different kind which also occurred at that time, the conditions of which were not complete enough to make them worth recording here. But it was mortifying to approach no nearer to absolute certi- tude concei-ning the questions in which we w^ere really interested^namely, whether there did indeed exist men with the wonderful powers ascribed to the adepts, and whether in this way it was possible for human creatures to obtain positive knowledge concerning the characteristics of their own spiritual nature. It must be remembered that Madame Blavatsky w^as preaching no specific doctrine on this subject. What she told us about the adepts and her own initiation was elicited by questions. \" Theosophy, in which she did seek to interest all her friends, did not pro- claim any specific belief on the subject. It simply recom-"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"RE CENT OCCULT PHENOMENA . 35 mended the theory that humanity should be regarded as a Universal Brotherhood in which each person should study the truth as regards spiritual things, freed from the pve- possessions of any speciiic rehgious dogma. But although her attitude, as regards the whole subject, put her under no moral obligation to prove the reality of occultism, her conversation and her book, '•' Isis Unveiled,\" disclosed a view of things which one naturally desired to exjDlore further ; and it was tantalizing to feel that she could, and yet could not, give us the final proofs we so much desired to have, that her occult training really had invested her with powers over material things of a kind which, if one could but feel sure they were actually in her possession, would utterly shatter the primary foundations of material- istic philosophy. One conviction we felt had been fully attained. This was the conviction of her own good faith. It is disagree- able merely to recognize that this can be impugned ; iDut this has been done in India so recklessly and cruelly by people who take up an attitude of hostility to the views with which she is identified, that it would be affectation to pass the question by. On the other hand, it would be too great a concession to an ignoble attack to go minutely over the evidence of her honesty of character ivith which my intimacy with Madame Blavatsky has gradually supplied me. At various times she has been ,a guest of ours for periods now amounting in all to more than three months out of nearly two years. To any impartial intelligence it will be manifest that, under these circumstances, I must have been able to form a better opinion concerning her real character than can possibly be derived from the crude observations of persons who have perhaps met her once or twice. I am not, of course, attributing any scientific value to this sort of testimony as accrediting the abnormal character of phenomena she may be concerned in producing. \"With such a mighty problem at stake as the trustworthiness of the fundamental theories of modern physical science, it is impossible to proceed by any other but scientific modes of investigation. In any experiments I have tried I have always been careful to exclude, not merely the probability, but the possibility of trickery ; and where it has been im- possible to secure the proper conditions, I have not allowed D 2"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE OCCULT WORLD. the results of the experiment to enter into the sum total of my conclusions. But, in its place, it seems only right — only a slight attempt to redress the scandalous wrong which, as far as mere insult and slander can do a WTong, has been done to a very high-minded and perfectly-honourable woman to record the certainty at which in progress of time both my wife and myself arrived, that Madame Blavatsky is a lady of absolutely upright nature, who has sacrificed, not merely rank and fortune, but all thought of personal wel- fare or comfort in any shape, from enthusiasm for occult studies in the first instance, and latterly for the special task she has taken in hand as an initiate in, if relatively a humble member of, the great occult fraternity — the dh^ec- tion of the Theosophical Society. Besides the production of the raps one other phenomenon had been conceded to us during Madame Blavatsky's first visit. We had gone with her to Benares for a few days, and were staying at a house lent to us by the Maharajah of Yizianagram — a big, bare, comfortless abode as judged by European standards^in the central hall of which we were sitting one evening after dinner. Suddenly three or four flowers — cut roses — fell in the midst of us — just as such things sometimes fall in the dark at spiritual seances. But in this case there were several lamps and candles in the room. The ceihng of the hall consisted simply of the sohd, bare, painted rafters and boards that supported the flat cement roof of the building. The phenomenon was so wdiolly unexpected — as unexpected, I am given to under- stand, by Madame Blavatsky, sitting in an arm-chair read- ing at the time, as by the rest of us — that it lost some of the eflfect it would otherwise have had on our minds. If one could have been told a moment beforehand \" now some flowers are going to fall,\" so that Ave could have looked up and seen them suddenly appear in the air above our heads, then the impressive effect of an incident so violently out of the common order of things would have been very great. Even as it was, the incident has always remained for those who witnessed it one of the stages on their road to a convic- tion of the reality of occult powers. * Persons to whom it is merely related cannot be expected to rely upon it to any great extent. They will naturally ask various questions as to the construction of the room, who inhabited the house, &c.,"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"RECENT OCCULT PHENOMENA. and even when all these questions had been answered, as they truthfully could be in a manner which would shut out any hypothesis by means of which the fall of the flowers could be explainable by any conjuring trick, there would still be an uncomfortable suspicion left in the ques- tioner's mind as to the completeness of the exj)lanation given. It might hardly have been worth while to bring the incident on to the present record at all, but for the opportunity it affords me of pointing out that the pheno- mena produced in Madame Blavatsky's presence need not necessarily be of her producing. Coming now to details in connection with some of the larger mysteries of occultism, I am oppressed by the diffi- culty of leading up to a statement of what I know now to be facts — as absolute facts as Charing Cross — which shall, nevertheless, be gradual enough not to shock the under- standing of people absolutely unused to any but the ordinary grooves of thought as regards physical phenomena. None the less is it true that any \" Brother,\" as the adepts in occultism are familiarly referred to, who may have been seized with the impulse to bestow on our party at Benares the little surprise described above, may have been in Thibet or in the South of India, or anywhere else in the world at the time, and yet just as able to make the roses fall as if he had been in the room with us. I have spoken already of the adept's power of being present \" in spirit\" as we should say, \" in astral body,\" as an occultist would say, at any distant place in the flash of a moment at will. So present, he can exercise in that distant place some of the psychological powers which he possesses, as completely as he can exercise them in physical body wherever he may actually be, as we understand the expression. I am not pretending to give an explanation of how he produces this or that result, nor for a moment hinting that I know. I am recording merely the certain fact that various occult results have been accomplished in my presence, and explaining as much about them as I have been able to find out. But at all events it has long since become quite plain to me, that wherever Madame Blavatsky is, there the Brothers, wherever they may be, can and constantly do produce phenomena of the most overwhelming sort, with the pro- duction of which she herself has little or nothino- to do. In"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THE OCCULT WORLD. reference, indeed, to any phenomenon occuring in her presence, it must be remembered that one can never have any exact knowledge as to how far her own powers may have been employed, or how far she may have been \" helped,\" or whether she has not been quite uninfiuential in the production of the result. Precise explanations of this kind are quite contrary to the rules of occultism — which, it must always be remembered, is not trying to convince the w^orld of its existence. In this volume / am trying to convince the Avorld of its existence, but that is another matter alto- gether. Any one who wishes to know how the truth really stands can only take up the position of a seeker of truth- He is not a judge before wdiom occultism comes to plead for credibihty. It is useless, therefore, to quarrel with the observations we are enabled to make on the ground that they are not of the kind one would best like to make. The question is whether they yield data on which conclusions may safely rest. And another consideration claims treatment in connection Avith the character of the observations which, so far, I have been enabled to make — that is to say, in connection with any search for proof of occult power as regards physical phenomena which but for such agency would be mii-aculous. I can foresee that, in spite of the abject stupidity of the remark, many people will urge that the force of the experi- ments with which I have had to deal is vitiated because they relate to phenomena which have a certain superficial resemblance to conjuring tricks. Of course this ensues from the fact that conjuring tricks all aim at achieving a certain superficial resemblance to occult phenomena. Let any reader, whatever his present frame of mind on the subject may be, assume for a moment that he has seen reason to conceive that there may be an occult fraternity in existence wielding strange powers over natural forces as yet unknown to ordinary humanity ; that this fraternity is bound by rules w^hich cramp the manifestation of these powers, but do not absolutely prohibit it ; and then let him propose some comparatively small but scientifically convinc- ing tests which he could ask to have conceded to him as a proof of the reality of some part, at all events, of these powers : it will be found tliat it is impossible to projDose any such test that does not bear a certain superficial resemblance"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"RECENT OCCULT PHENOMENA. 39 to a conjuring trick. But this will not necessarily impair the value of the test for people capable of cleahng with those characteristics of experiments that are not superficial. The gulf of difference which is really to be observed lying between any of the occult phenomena I shall have to describe presently and a conjuring trick which might imitate it, is due to the fact that the conditions would be utterly unlike. The conjuror would work in his own stage, or in a prepared room. The most remarkable of the phenomena I have had in the presence of Madame Blavatsky have taken place away out of doors in fortuitously chosen places in the woods and on the hills. The conjuror is assisted by any required number of confederates behind his scenes. Madame Blavatsky comes a stranger to Simla, and is a guest in my own house, under my own observation, during the whole of her visit. The conjuror is paid to incur the expenses of accomplishing tliis or that decejDtion of the senses. Madame Blavatsky is, what I have already explained, a lady of honourable character, instrumental in helping her friends — at their earnest desire wherever phenomena are produced at all — to see some manifestation of the powers in the acquisition of which (instead of earning money by them as the conjuror does with his) she has sacrificed everything the world generally holds dear — station, and so forth, immeasurably above that to which any conjuror or any impostor could aspire. Pursuing Madame Blavatsky with injurious suspicions, persons who resent the occult hypothesis will constantly forget the dictates of common sense in overlooking these considerations. About the beginning of September, 1880, Madame Blavatsky came to Simla as our guest, and in the course of the following six weeks various phenomena occurred, which became the talk of all Anglo-Inclia for a time, and gave rise to some excited feeling on the part of persons who warmly espoused the theory that they must be the result of im- posture. It soon became apparent to us that whatever might have been the nature of the restrictions Avhich operated the previous winter at Allahabad to prevent our guest from displaying more than the very least of her powers, these restrictions were now less operative than before. We were soon introduced to a phenomenon we had not been treated to previously. By some modification of"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"40 THE OCCULT WORLD. the force employed to produce the sound of raps on any object, Madame Blavatsky can jDroduce in the ah^, without the intermediation of any sohd object whatever, the sound of a silvery bell — sometimes a chime or little run of three or four bells on difterent notes. We had often heard about these bells, but had never heard them produced before. They were produced for us for the first time one evening after dinner while we were still sitting round the table, several times in succession in the air over our heads, and in one instance instead of the single bell-sound there came one of the chimes of which I speak. Later on I heard them on scores of occasions and in all sorts of different places — in the open air and at different houses where Madame Blavatsky went from time to time. As before with the raps, there is no hypothesis in the case of the bells which can be framed by an adherent of the imposture theory which does not break down on a comparison of the different occasions and conditions under which I have heard them produced. Indeed, the theory of imposture is one which in the matter of the bells has only one narrow con- jecture to rest on. Unlike the sound of a rap, which in the ordinary way could be produced by many different methods — so that, to be sure any given example of such a sound is not joroduced by ordinary means, one has to pro- cure its repetition under a great variety of conditions — the sound of a bell can only be made, physically, in a few ways. You must have a bell, or some sonorous object in the nature of a bell, to make it with. Now, when sitting in a well-lighted room, and attentively w^atching, you get the sound of a bell up above your heads where there is no physical bell to yield it — what are the hypotheses which can attribute the result to trickery % Is the sound really produced outside the room altogether by some agent or apparatus in another % First of all no rational person who had heard this sound would advance that theory, Ijecause the sound itself is incompatible with the idea. It is never loud — at least I have never heard it very loud — but it is always clear and distinct to a remarkable extent. If you lightly strike the edge of a thin claret-glass with a knife you may get a sound which it would be difficult to persuade any one had come from another room ; but the occult bell-sound is like that, only purer and clearer, with no sub-sound of"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"RE CENT OCCULT PHENOMENA . 4 1 jarring in it whatever. Independently of this, I have, as I say, heard the sound in the open air produced up in the sky in the stillness of evening. In rooms it has not always been overhead, but sometimes down on the ground amongst the feet of a group of persons Hstening for it. Again, on one occasion, when it had been produced two or three times in the dramng-room of a friend's house where we had all been dining, one gentleman of the party went back to the dining-room, two rooms off, to get a finger-glass with which to make a sound for the occult bells to repeat — a familiar form of the experiment. While by himself in the dining- room he heard one of the bell-sounds produced near him, though Madame Blavatsky had remained in the drawing- room. This example of the phenomenon satisfactorily disposed of the theory, absurd in itself for persons who frequently heard the bells in all manner of places, that Madame Blavatsky carried some apparatus about her with which to produce the sound. As for the notion of con- federacy, that is disposed of by the fact that I have re- peatedly heard the sounds when out walking beside Madame Blavatsky's jampan with no other person near us but the jampanees carrying it. The bell-sounds are not mere sportive illustrations of the properties of the currents which are set in action to produce them. They serve the direct practical purpose among occultists of a telegraphic call-bell. It appears that where trained occultists are concerned, so that the mysterious magnetic connection, whatever it may be, which enables them to communicate ideas is once established, they can produce the bell-sounds at any distance in the neighbour- hood of the fellow-initiate whose attention they wish to attract. I have repeatedly heard Madame Blavatsky called in this way, w4ien our own little party being alone some evening, we have all been quietly reading. A little \" ting\" would \"suddenly sound, and Madame Blavatsky would get up and go to her room to attend to whatever occult business may have been the motive of her summons. A very pretty illustration of the sound, as thus produced by some brother-initiate at a distance, was afforded one evening under these circumstances. A lady, a guest at another house in Simla, had been dining with us, when about eleven o'clock I received a note from her host, enclosing a letter"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"42 THE OCCULT WORLD. wliieli lie asked Die to get Madame Blavatsky to send on by occult means to a certain member of the great fraternity to whom both he and I had been writing. I shall exi:)lain the circumstances of this correspondence more fully later on. \"We wei-e all anxious to know at once — before the lady with us thc\\t evening returned up the hill, so that she could take back word to her host — whether the letter could be sent ; but Madame Blavatsls}' declared that her own powers would not enable her to perform the feat. The question was whether a certain person, a half-developed brother then in the neighbourhood of Simla, would give the necessary help. Madame Blavatsky said she would see if she could \" find him,\" and taking the letter in her hands, she went out into the verandah, where vve all followed her. Leaning on the balustrade, and looking over the wide sweep of the Simla valley, she remained for a few minutes perfectly motionless and silent, as we all were ; and the night was far enough advanced for all commonplace sounds to have settled down, so that the stillness was perfect. Suddenly, in the air before us, there sounded the clear note of an occult-bell. \" All right,\" cried Madame, \" he will take it.\" And duly taken the letter was shortly afterwards. But the phenomenon involved in its transmission will be better introduced to the reader in connection with other examples. I come now to a series of incidents which exhibit occult power in a more striking light than any of those yet described. To a scientific mind, indeed, the production of sounds by means of a force unknown to ordinary science should be as clear a proof that the power in question is a power, as the more sensational phenomena which have to do with the transmission of solid objects by occult agency. The sound can only reach our ears by the vibration of air^ and to set up the smallest undulation of air as the effect of a thought will appear to the ordinary understanding as no less outrageous an impossibility than the uprooting of a tree in a similar way. Still there are degrees in wonder- fulness which the feelings recognize even if such distinctions are ii-rational. The first incident of the kind which I now take up is not one which would in itself be a comj^lete proof of an}^hing for an outsider. I describe it rather for the benefit of"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"RE CENT OCCULT PHENOMENA . 43 readers who may be, either through spirituahstic experiences or in any other way, abeacly ahve to the possibihty of phenomena as such, and interested rather in experiments which may throw hght on their genesis than in mere texts. Managed a httle better, the occurrence now to be dealt with would have been a beautiful test; but Madame Blavatsky, left to herself in such matters, is always the worst de\\-isor of tests imaginable. Utterly out of sympathy with the positive and incredulous temperament ; engaged all her life in the development amongst Asiatic mystics of the creative rather than the critical faculties, she never can follow the intricate suspicions with which the European observer approaches the consideration of the marvellous in its simplest forms. The marvellous, in forms so stupendously marvellous that they almost elude the grasp of ordinary conceptions, has been the daily food of her hf e for a great number of years, and it is easy to realize that, for her, the jealous distrust with wdiich ordinary people hunt round the slightest manifestation of occult force to find any loophole through which a suspicion of fraud may creep, as no less tiresome and stupid, than the ordinary person conceives the too credulous spirit to be. About the end of September my wife went one afternoon with Madame Blavatsky to the top of a neighbouring hill. They were only accompanied by one other friend. I was not present myself on this occasion. Whjle there Madame Blavatsky asked my wife, in a joking way, what was her heart's desire. She said at random and on the spur of the moment, \" to get a note from one of the Brothers.\" Madame Blavatsky took from her pocket a piece of blank pink paper that had been torn ofF a note received that day. Folding this up into a small compass, she took it to the edge of the hill, held it up for a moment or two between her hands and returned saying that it was gone. She presently, after communicating mentally by her own occult methods with the distant Brother, said he asked where my wife would have the letter. At first she said she should like it to come fluttering down into her lap, but some conversation ensued as to whether this would be the best w^ay to get it, •And ultimately it was decided that she should find it in a certain tree. Here, of course, a mistake was made, which opens the door to the suspicions of resolutely disbelieving"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"44 THE OCCULT WORLD. persons. It will be supposed that Madame Blavatsky had some reasons of her own for wishing the tree chosen. For readers wdio favour that conjecture after all that has gone before, it is only necessary to repeat that the present story is being told not as a proof but as an incident. At hrst Madame Blavatsky seems to have made a mistake as to the description of the tree which the distant Brother was indicating as that in which he was going to put the note, and with some trouble my Avife scrambled on to the lower branch of a bare and leafless trunk on wdiich nothing could be found. Madame then again got into communication with the Brother and ascertained her mis- take. Into another tree at a little distance, which neither Madame nor the one other person present had approached, my wife now climbed a few feet and looked all round among the branches. At first she saw nothing, but then, turning back her head without moving from the position she had taken up, she saw on a twig immediately before her face — where a moment previously there had been nothing but leaves — a little pink note. This was stuck on to the stalk of a leaf that had been quite freshly torn oft', for the stalk was still green and moist — not withered as it would have been if the leaf had been torn oft* for any length of time. The note was found to contain these few words : \"I have been asked to leave a note here for you. What can I do for you?\" It was signed by some Thibetan characters. The pink paper on which it was w^ritten appeared to be the .same which Madame Blavatsky had taken blank from her pocket shortly before. How was it transmitted first to the Brother who wrote upon it and then back again to the top of our hill % not to speak of the mystery of its attachment to the tree in the w^ay described. So far as I can frame conjectures on this subject, it would be premature to set them forth in detail till I have gone more fully into the facts observed. It is no use to discuss the way the wings of flying-fish are made for people who will not believe in the reality of flying-fish at all, and refuse to accept phenomena less guaranteed by orthodoxy than Pharaoh's chariot wheels. I come now to the incidents of a very remarkable day. The day before, I should explain, we started on a little expedition which turned out a coup manque, though, but for"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"RECENT OCCULT PHENOMENA. 45 some tiresome mishaps, it might have led, we afterwards had reason to think, to some very interesting results. We mistook our way to a place of which Madame Blavatsky had received an imperfect description — or a description she imperfectly understood — in an occult conversation with one of the Brothers then actually passing through Simla. Had we gone the right way that day we might have had the good fortune of meeting him, for he stayed one night at a certain old Thibetan temple, or rest-house, such as is often found about the Himalayas, and which the blind apathy of commonplace English people leads them to regard as of no particular interest or importance. Madame Blavatsky was wholly unacquainted with Simla, and the account she gave us of the place she wanted to go to led us to think she meant a different place. We started, and for a long time Madame declared that we must be going in the\" rio-ht direction because she felt certain currents. Afterwards it a23peared that the road to the place we were making for and to that for which we ought to have made, were coinci- dent for a considerable distance ; but a slight divero-ence at one point carried us into a wholly wrong system of hill- paths. Eventually Madame utterly lost her scent: we tried back ; we who knew Simla discussed its topography and wondered where it could be she wanted to get to, but all to no purpose. We launched ourselves down a hill-side where Madame declared she once more felt the missino- current; but occult currents may flow where travellers cannot pass, and when we attempted this descent I knew the case was desperate. After a while the expedition had to be abandoned, and we went home much disappointed. Why, some one may ask, could not the omniscient Brother feel that Madame was going wrong, and direct us properly in time ? I say this question will be asked, because I know from experience that people unused to the subject will not bear in mind the relations of the Brothers to such inquirers as ourselves. In this case, for example, the situation was not one in which the Brother in question was anxiouslv waiting to prove his existence to a jviry of inteUio-ent Enghshmen. We can learn so little about the daily hfe of an adept in occultism, that we who are uninitiated can tell very little about the interests that really eno-ao-e his attention; but we can find out tliis much — that his attention"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"^6 THE OCCULT WORLD. is constantly engaged on interests connected with liis own work, and the gratification of the curiosity concerning occult matters of persons who are not regular students of occultism forms no part of that work at all. On the contrary, unless under very exceptional conditions, he is even forbidden to make any concessions whatever to such curiosity. In the case in point the course of events may probably have been something of this kind : — Madame Blavatsky perceived by her own occult tentacul?e that one of her illustrious friends was in the neighbourhood. She immediately — having a sincere desire to oblige us — may have asked him whether she might bring us to see him. Probably he would regard any such request very much as the astronomer royal might regard the request of a friend to bring a party of ladies to look through his telescopes ; but none the less he might say, to please his half-fledged \" brother\" in occultism, Madame Blavatsky, \" Yery well, bring them, if you like : I am in such and such a place.\" And then he would go on with his work, remembering afterwards that the intended visit had never been paid, and perhaps turning an occult perception in the direction of the circumstances to ascertain what had happened. However this may have been, the expedition as first planned broke down. It was not with the hope of seeing the Brother, but on the general principle of hoping for something to turn up, that we arranged to go for a picnic the folloAving day in another direction, which, as the first road had failed, we concluded to be probably the one we ought to have taken previously. We set out at the appointed time next morning. We were originally to have been a party of six, but a seventh person joined us just before we started. After going down the hill for some hours a place was chosen in the wood near the upper waterfall for our breakfast : the baskets that had been brought with us were unpacked, and, as usual at an Indian picnic, the servants at a little distance lighted a fire and set to work to make tea and coftee. Concerning this some joking arose over the fact that we had one cup and saucer too few, on account of the seventh person avIio joined us at starting, and some one laughingly asked Madame Blavatsky to create another cup and saucer. There was no set purpose in the proposal at first, but when"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"RECENT OCCULT PHENOMENA. 47 Madame Blavatsky said it would be very difficult, but that if we liked she would try, attention was of course at once arrested. Madame Blavatsky, as usual, held mental con- versation %vith one of the Brothers, and then wandered a little about in the immediate neighbourhood of where we were sitting — that is to say, within a radius of half-a-dozen to a dozen yards from our picnic cloth — I closely following, waiting to see what would happen. Then she marked a spot on the ground, and called to one of the gentlemen of the party to bring a knife to dig with. The place chosen was the edge of a little slope covered with thick weeds and grass and shrubby undergrowth. The gentleman with the knife — let us call him X as I shall have to refer to him afterwards — tore up these in the first place with some difficulty, as the roots were tough and closely interlaced. Cutting then into the matted roots and earth with the knife, and pulling away the debris with his hands, he came at last, on the edge of something white, which turned out, as it was completely excavated, to be the required cup. A corres- ponding saucer was also found after a little more digging. Both objects were in among the roots which spread every- where through the ground, so that it seemed as if the roots were growing round them. The cup and saucer both cor- responded exactly, as regards their pattern, with those that had been brought to the picnic, and constituted a seventh cup and saucer when brought back to where we were to have breakfast. I may as well add at once that afterwards, when Ave got home, my wife questioned our principal khitmutgar, as to how many cups and saucers of that particular kind we possessed. In the progress of years, as the set was an old set, some had been broken, but the man at once said that nine teacups were left. When collected and counted that number was found to be right, without reckoning the excavated cup. That made ten, and as regards the pattern, it was one of a somewhat peculiar kind, bought a good many years pre- viously in London, and which assuredly could never have been matched in Simla. Now, the notion that human beings can create material objects by the exercise of mere psychological power, will of course be revolting to the understandings of people to whom this whole subject is altogether strange. It is not making- the idea much more acceptable to say that the cup and"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"4$ THE OCCULT WORLD. saucer appear in this case to have been \" doubled\" rather than created. The doubUng of objects seems merely another kind of creation — creation according to a pattern. However, the facts, the occurrences of the morning I have described, were at all events exactly as I have related them. I have been careful as to the strict and minute truthful- ness of every detail. If the phenomenon was not what it appeared to be — a most wonderful display of a power of which the modern scientific world has no comprehension whatever — it was, of course, an elaborate fraud. That sup- position, however, setting aside the moral impossibility from any point of view of assuming Madame Blavatsky capable of participation in such an imposture, will only bear to be talked of vaguely. As a way out of the dilemma it will not serve any person of ordinary intelhgence who is aware of the facts, or who trusts my statement of them. The cup and saucer were assuredly dug up in the way I describe. If they were not deposited there by occult agency, they must have been buried there beforehand. Now, I have described the character of the ground from which they were dug up ; assuredly that had been undisturbed for years by the character of the vegetation upon it. But it may be urged that from some other part of the sloping ground a sort of tunnel may have been excavated in the first instance through which the cup and saucer could have been thrust into the place where they were found. Now this theory is barely tenable as regards its physical possibility. If the tunnel had been big enough for the purpose it would have left traces which were not perceptible on the ground — which were not even discoverable when the ground was searched shortly afterwards with a view to that hypothesis. But the truth is that the theory of previous burial is morally untenable in view of the fact that the demand for the cup and saucer — of all the myriad things that might have been asked for— could never have been foreseen. It arose out of circumstances themselves the sport of the moment. If no extra person had joined us at the last moment the number of cups and saucers packed up by the servants would have been sufiicient for our needs, and no attention w^ould have been drawai to them. It was l^y the servants, without the knowledge of any guests, that the cups taken were chosen from others that might just as easily"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"RECENT OCCULT PHENOMENA. 49 have been taken. Had the burial fraud been really perpe- trated, it would have been necessary to constrain us to choose the exact spot we did actually choose for the picnic with a view to the previous preparations, but the exact spot on which the ladies' jampans were deposited was chosen by myself in concert with the gentleman referred to above as X , and it was within a few yards of this spot that the cup was found. Thus, leaving the other absurdities of the fraud hypothesis out of sight, who could be the agents employed to deposit the cup and saucer in the ground, and when did they perform the operation % Madame Blavatsky was under our roof the whole time from the previous even- ing when the picnic was determined on to the moment of starting. The one personal servant she had with her, a Bombay boy and a perfect stranger to Simla, was constantly about the house the previous evening, and from the first awakening of the household in the morning — and as it happened he spoke to my own bearer in the middle of the night, for I had been annoyed by a loft door which had been left unfastened, and was slamming in the wind, and called up servants to shut it. Madame Blavatsky it appears, thus awakened, had sent her servant, who always slept within call, to inquire what was the matter. Colonel Olcott, the President of the Theosophical Society, also a guest of ours at the time of wliich I am speaking, was certainly with us all the evening from the period of our return from the abortive expedition of the afternoon, and was also present at the start. To imagine that he spent the night in going four or five miles down a difiicult hlmd through forest paths difiicult to find, to bury a cup and saucer of a kind that we were not likely to take in a place we were not likely to go to, in order that in the exceedingly remote contingency of its being required for the perpetration of a hoax it might be there, would certainly be a somewhat extravagant conjecture. Another considera- tion — the destination for which we w^ere making can be approached by two roads from opposite ends of the upper horseshoe of hills on which Simla stands. It was open to us to select either path, and certainly neither Madame Blavatsky nor Colonel Olcott had any share in the selection of that actually taken. Had we taken the other, we should never have come to the spot where we actually picniced."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"50 THE OCCULT WORLD, The hypothesis of fraud in this affair is, as I have said, a defiance of common sense when woi-ked out in any imagin- able way. The extravagance of this explanation will, more- over, be seen to heighten as my narrative proceeds, and as the incident just related is compared with others which took place later. But I have not yet done with the incidents of the cup-morning. The gentleman called X had been a good deal with us during the week or two that had already elapsed since Madame Blavatsky's arrival. Like many of our friends, he had been greatly impressed with much he had seen in her presence. He had especially come to the conclusion that the Theosophical Society, in which she was interested, was exerting a good influence with the natives, a view which he had expressed more than once in warm language in my presence. He had declared his intention of joining this Society as I had done myself. Now, when the cup and saucer were found most of us who were present, X among the number, were greatly impressed, and in the con- versation that ensued the idea arose that X might formally become a member of the Society then and there. I should not have taken part in this suggestion — I believe I originated it — if X had not in cool blood decided, as I understood, to join the Society ; in itself, moreover, a step which involved no responsibilities whatever, and simply indicated sympathy with the pursuit of occult know- ledge and a general adhesion to broad philanthroj^ic doctrines of brotherly sentiments towards all humanity, irrespective of race and creed. This has to be explained in view of some little annoyances which followed. The proposal that X should then and there formally join the Society was one with which he was quite ready to fall in. But some documents were required — a formal diploma, the gift of which to a new member should follow his initiation into certain little masonic forms of recognition adopted in the Society. How could we get a diploma % Of course for the group then present a difficulty of this sort was merely another opportunity for the exercise of Madame's powers. Could she get a diploma brought to us by \" magic T After an occult conversation with the Brother who had then interested himself in our proceedings, Madame told us that the diploma would be forthcoming."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"RE CENT OCCULT PHENOMENA . 5 1 She described the appearance it woukl present — a roll of paper wound round with an immense quantity of string, and then bound up in the leaves of a creeping plant. We should find it about in the wood where we were, and we could all look for it, but it would be X , for whom it was intended, who would find it. Thus it fell out. We all searched about in the undergrowth or in the trees, wherever fancy prompted us to look, and it was X who found the roll, done up as described. We had had our breakfast by this time. X was formally \" initiated\" a member of the society by Colonel Olcott, and after a time we shifted our quarters to a lower place in the wood where there was the Httle Thibetan temple, or rest-house, in which the Brother who had been passing through Simla — according to what Madame Blavatsky told us — had spent the previous night. We amused ourselves by examining the little building inside and out, \"bathing in the good magnetism,\" as Madame Blavatsky expressed it, and then, lying on the grass outside, it occurred to some one that we wanted more coffee. The servants were told to prepare some, but it appeared that they had used up all our water. The water to be found in the streams near Simla is not of a kind to be used for pur- poses of this sort, and for a picnic, clean filtered water is always taken out in bottles. It appears that all the bottles in our baskets had been exhausted. This report was promptly verified by the servants by the exhibition of the empty bottles. The only thing to be done was to send to a brewery, the nearest building, about a mile off, and ask for water. I wrote a pencil note and a coolie went off with the empty bottles. Time passed, and the cooUe returned, to our great disgust, without the water. There had been no European left at the brewery that day (it was Sunday) to receive the note, and the coolie had stupidly plodded back with the empty bottles under his arm, instead of asking about and finding some one able to supply the required water. At this time our party was a little dispersed. X and one of the other gentlemen had wandered off\". No one of the remainder of the party was expecting fresh phenomena, when Madame suddenly got up, went over to the baskets, a dozen or twenty yards ofi*, picked out a bottle — one of those, I believe, which had been brought back by the coolie E 2"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"52 THE OCCULT WORLD. empty — and came back to us holding it under the fokl of her dress. Laughingly producing it it was found to be full of water. Just like a conjuring trick, will some one say ] Just like, except for the conditions. For such a conjuring trick, the conjuror defines the thing to be done. In our case the want of water was as unforeseeable in the first instance as the want of the cup and saucer. The accident that left the brewery deserted by its Europeans, and the further accident that the coolie sent up for water should have been so abnor- mally stupid even for a coolie as to come back without, because there happened to be no European to take my note, were accidents but for wdiich the opportunity for obtaining the Avater by occult agency could not have arisen. And those acci- dents supervened on the fundamental accident, improbable in itself, that our servants should have sent us out insuffi- ciently supplied. That any bottle of water could have been left unnoticed at the bottom of the baskets is a suggestion that I can hardly imagine any one present putting forward, for the servants had been found fault with for not bring- ing enough ; they had just before had the baskets completely emj^tied out, and we had not submitted to the situation till w^e had been fully satisfied that there really w^as no more water left. Furthermore, I tasted the water in the bottle Madame Blavatsky produced, and it was not water of the same kind as that which came from our own filters. It was an earthy-tasting w^ater, unlike that of the modern Simla supply, but equally unlike, I may add, though iq a different w\\ay, the offensive and discoloured water of the only stream llowing through those w^oods. How was it brought % The how, of course, in all these cases is the great mystery w^hich I am unable to explain except in general terms; but the impossibility of under- standing the w^ay adepts manipulate matter is one thing ; the impossibility of denying that they do manipulate it in a manner which Western ignorance would describe as miracu- lous is another. The fact is there whether we can explain it or not. The rough, popular saying that you cannot argue the hind leg off* a cow, embodies a sound reflection wdiich our prudent sceptics in matters of the kind with which I am now dealing are too apt to overlook. You cannot argue away a fact by contending that by the lights in your mind it ought to be something different from what it is. Still"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"RECENT OCCULT PHENOMENA. less can you argue away a mass of facts like those I am now recording by a series of extravagant and contradictory hypotheses about each in turn. AVhat the determined disbehever so often overlooks is that the scepticism which may show an acuteness of mind up to a certain point, reveals a deficient intelligence when adhered to in face of certain kinds of evidence. I remember when the phonograph was first invented, a scientific officer in the service of the Indian Government sent me an article he had wiitten on the earliest accounts received of the instrument — to prove that the story must be a hoax, because the instrument described was scientih- cally impossible. He had worked out the times of vibra- tions required to reproduce the sounds and so on, and very intelligently argued that the alleged result was unattainable. But when phonographs in due time were imported into India, he did not continue to say they were impossible, and that there must be a man shut up in each machine, even though there did not seem to be room. That last is the attitude of the self-complacent people who get over the difficulty about the causation of occult and spiritual pheno- mena by denying, in face of the palpable experience of thousands — in face of the testimony in shelves-ful of books that they do not read — that any such phenomena take place at all. X , I should add here, afterwards changed his mind about the satisfactory character of the cup phenomenon, and said he thought it vitiated as a scientific proof by the interposition of the theory that the cup and saucer might have been thrust up into their places by means of a tunnel cut from a lower part of the bank. I have discussed that hypothesis already, and mention the fact of X 's change of opinion, which does not affect any of the circumstances I have narrated, merely to avoid the chance that readers, who may have heard or read about the Simla phenomenon in other pages, might think I was treating the change of opinion in question as something which it was worth while to disguise. And, indeed, the convictions which I ulti- mately attained were themselves the result of accumulated experiences I have yet to relate, so that I cannot tell how far my o^\\al certainty concerning the reality of occult power rests on any one example that I have seen."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"54 THE OCCULT WORLD. It was on the evening of the day of the cup phenomenon that there occurred an incident destined to become the subject of very wide discussion in all the Anglo-Indian papers. This was the celebrated \" brooch incident.\" The facts were related at the time in a little statement drawn up for publication, and signed by the nine persons who witnessed it. This statement will be laid before the reader directly, but as the comments to which it gave rise showed that it was too meagre to convey a full and accurate idea of what occurred, I will describe the course of events a little more fully. In doing this, I may use names with a certain freedom, as these were all appended to the published document. We, that is my wife and myself with our guests, had gone up the hill to dine, in accordance with previous en- gagements, with Mr. and Mrs. Hume. We dined, a party of eleven, at a round table, and Madame Blavatsky, sitting- next our host, tired and out of spirits as it hapjDened, was unusually silent. During the beginning of dinner she scarcely said a word, Mr. Hume conversing chiefly with the lady on his other hand. It is a common trick at Indian dinner-tables to have little metal platewarmers with hot water before each guest, on which each plate served re- mains while in use. Such platewarmers were used on the evening I am describing, and over hers — in an interval during which plates had been removed — Madame Blavatsky was absently warming her hands. Now, the production of Madame Blavatsky 's raps and bell-sounds w^e had noticed sometimes seemed easier and the effects better wdien her hands had been warmed in this way ; so some one, seeing her engaged in warming them, asked her some question, hinting in an indirect way at phenomena. I was very far from expecting anything of the kind that evening, and Madame Blavatsky was equally far from intending to do anything herself or from expecting any display at the hands of one of the Brothers. So, merely in moc]s:ery, when asked why she was warming her hands, she enjoined us all to warm our hands too and see what would happen. Some of the people present actually did so, a few joking words passing among them. Then Mrs. Hume raised a little laugh by holding up her hands and saying, \" But I have warmed my hands, what next?\" Now Madame Blavatsky, as I have"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"RECENT OCCULT PHENOMENA. 55 said, was not in a mood for any occult performances at all, but it appeal's from what I learned afterwards that just at this moment, or immediately before, she suddenly perceived by those occult faculties of which mankind at large have no knowledge, that one of the Brothers was present '' in astral body\" invisible to the rest of us in the room. It was follow- ing his indications, therefore, that she acted in what followed ; of course no one knew at the time that she had received any impulse in the matter external to herself. \" What took place as regards the surface of tilings was simply this : When Mrs. Hume said what I have set down above, and when the little laugh ensued, Madame Blavatsky put out her hand across the one person sitting between herself and Mrs. Hume and took one of that lady's hands saying, \"Well then, do you wish for an}i:hing in particular?\" or as the lawyers say, \" words to that effect.\" I cannot repeat the precise sentences spoken, nor can I say now exactly what Mrs. Hume first rephed before she quite understood the situation; but this was made clear in a very few minutes. Some of the other people present catching this first, explained, \"Think of something you would like to have brought to you ; anything you like not wanted for any mere worldly motive ; is there anything you can think of that will be very difiicult to get %'' Remarks of this sort were the only kind that were made in the short interval that elapsed between the remark by Mrs. Hume about having warmed her hands and the indication by her of the thing she had thought of. She said then that she had thought of something that would do. What was it % An old brooch that her mother had given her long ago and that she had lost. Now, when this brooch, which was ultimately recovered by occult agency, as the rest of my story will show, came to be talked about, people said :— \" Of course Madame Blavatsky led up the conversation to the particular thing she had arranged beforehand to produce.\" I have described all the conversation which took place on this subject, before the brooch was named. There was no conversation about the brooch or any other thing of the kind whatever. Five minutes before the brooch was named, there had been no idea in the mind of any person present that any phenomenon in the nature of finding any lost article, or of any other"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"56 THE OCCULT WORLD. kind, indeed, was going to be performed. Nor while Mrs. Hume was going over in her mind the things she might ask for, did she speak any word indicating the direction her thoughts were taking. From the point of the story now reached the narrative pubhshed at the time tehs it almost as fully as it need be told, and, at all events, with a simplicity that will assist the reader in grasping all the facts — so I reprint it here ill fuU. \"On Sunday, the 3rd of October, at Mr. Hume's house at Simla, there were present at dinner Mr. and Mrs. Hume, Mr. and Mrs. Sinnett, Mrs. Gordon, Mr. F. Hogg, Captain P. J. Maitland, IMr. Beatson, Mr. David- son, Colonel Olcott, and Madame Blavatsky. Most of the persons present having recently seen many remarkable occurrences in Madame Blavatsky's presence, conversation turned on occult phenomena, and in the course of this Madame Blavatsky asked Mrs. Hume if there was anything she particularly wished for. Mrs. Hume at first hesitated, but in a short time said there was something she would particularly like to have brought her, namely, a small article of jewellery that she formerly possessed, but had given away to a person who bad allowed it to pass out of her posse'ssion. Madame Blavatsky then said if she would fix the image of the article in question very definitely on her mind, she, Madame Blavat- sky, would endeavour to procure it. Mrs. Hume then said that she vividly remembered the article, and described it as an old-fiishioned breast- brooch set round with pearls, with glass at the front, and the back made to contain hair. She then, on being asked, drew a rough sketch of the brooch. Madame Blavatsky then WTapped up a coin attached to her watch-chain in two cigarette papers, and put it in her dress, and said that she hoped the brooch might be obtained in the course ofthe evening. At the close of dinner she said to Mr. Hume that the paper in %yhich the coin had been wrapped was gone. A little later, in the drawing-room, she said that the brooch would not be brought into the house, but that it must be looked for in the garden, and then as the party went out a_ccom- panying her, she said she had clairvoyantly seen the brooch fall into a star-shaped bcid of flowers. Mr. Hume led the way to such a bed in a distant part of the garden. A prolonged and careful search w-as made with lanterns, and eventually a small paper packet, consisting of^two cigarette papers, was found amongst the leaves by Mrs. Sinnett. This being opened on the spot was found to contain a brooch exactly^ corre- sponding to the previous description, and which Mrs. Hume identified as tliat which she had originally lost. None of the party, except Mr. and Mrs. Hume, had ever seen or heard of the brooch. Mr. Hume had not thought of it for years. Mrs. Hume had never spoken of it to any one since she parted with it, nor had she, for long, even thought of it. She herself stated, after it was found, that it was only when Madame asked her whether there w^as anything she would like to have, that the re- membrance of this brooch, the \"gift of her mother, flashed across her mind. \"Mrs. Hume is not a spiritualist, and up to the time of the occurrence"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"RECENT OCCULT PHENOMENA. 57 described was no believer either in occult phenomena or in Madame Bla- vatsky's powers. The conviction of all present was, that the occurrence was of an absolutely unimpeachable character, as an evidence of the truth of the possibility of occult phenomena. The brooch is unquestion- ably the one which Mrs. Hume lost. Even supposing, which is practi- cally impossible, that the article, lost months before Mrs. Hume ever heard of Madame Blavatsky, and bearing no letters or other indication of original ownership, could have passed in a natural way into Madame Blavatsky's possession, even then she could not possibly have_ foreseen that it would be asked for, and Mrs. Hume herself had not given it a thought for months. \" This narrative, read over to the party, is signed by — \"A. 0. HUMB. M. A. Hume. Fred. R, Hogg. A. P. SiNNETT. Patience Sinnett. Alice Gordox. P. J. Maitland. Wm. Davison. Stuakt Beatson.\" It is needless to state that when this narrative was published the nine persons above mentioned were assailed with torrents of ridicule, the effect of which, however, has not been in any single case to modify, in the smallest degree^ the conviction which their signatures attested at the time, that the incident related was a perfectly conclusive proof of the reality of occult power. Floods of more or less imbecile criticism have been directed to show that the whole performance must have been a trick ; and for many persons in India it is now, no doubt, an established explana- tion that Mrs. Hume was adroitly led up to ask for the particular article produced, by a quantity of preliminary talk about a feat which Madame Blavatsky specially went to the house to perform. A further established opinion with a certain section of the Indian public is, that the brooch which it appears\" Mrs. Hume gave to her daughter, and which her daughter lost, must have been got from that young lady about a year previously, when she passed through Bombay, where Madame Blavatsky was living, on her way to England. The young lady's testimony to the efltect that she lost the brooch before she went to Bombay, or ever saw Madame Blavatsky, is a little feature of this hypothesis which its contented framers do not care to inquire into. Nor do persons who think the fact that the brooch once belonged to Mrs. Hume's daughter, and that this young lady once saw Madame Blavatsky at Bombay, sufficiently \" suspicious\" to wipe out the effect of the whole"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"58 THE OCCULT WORLD. incident as described above — ever attempt, as far as I have discerned, to trace oiTt a coherent chain of events as illumi- nated by their suspicions, or to compare these with the circumstances of the brooch's actual recover3^ No care, liowever, to arrange the circumstances of an occult demon- stration so that the possibility of fraud and delusion may really be excluded, is sufficient to exclude the imputation of this afterwards by people for whom any argument, how- ever illogical really, is good enough to attack a strange idea with. As regards the witnesses of the brooch phenomenon the conditions were so perfect that when they were speculating as to the objections which might be raised by the public when the story should come to be told, they did not foresee either of the objections actually raised af terwards — - the leading up in conversation theory, and the theory about Miss Hume having put Madame Blavatsky in possession of the brooch. They knew that there had been no previous conversation at all about the brooch or any other proposed feat, that the idea about getting something Mrs. Hume should ask for, arose all in a moment, and that almost immediately afterwards, the brooch was named. As for Miss Hume having unconsciously contributed to the produc- tion of the phenomenon, it did not occur to the witnesses that this would be suggested, because they did not foresee that any one could be so foolish as to shut their eyes to the important circumstances, to concentrate their attention entirely on one of quite minor importance. As the state- ment itself says, even supposing, which is practically impossible, that the brooch could have passed into Madame Elavatsky's possession in a natural way, she could not possibly have foreseen that it would have been asked for. The only conjectures the witnesses could frame to explain befoi'ehand the tolerably certain result that the public at large would refuse to be convinced by the brooch incident, were that they might be regarded as misstating the facts and omitting some which the superior intelligence of their critics — as their critics would regard the matter — would see to upset the significance of the rest, or that Mrs. Hume must be a confederate. Now, this last conjecture, which will no doubt occur to readers in England, had only to be stated, to be, for the other persons concerned in the incident."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"RECENT OCCULT PHENOMENA. 59' one of the most amusing results to which it could give rise. We all knew Mrs. Hume to be as httle predisposed towards any such a conspiracy as she was morally incapable of the wrong-doing it would involve. At one stage of the proceedings, moreover, we had con- sidered the question as to the extent to which the conditions of the phenomenon were satisfactory. It had often happened that faults had eventually been found with Madame Blavatsky's phenomena by reason of some over- sight in the conditions that had not been thought of ^at first. One of our friends, therefore, on the occasion I am describing, had suggested, after we rose from the dinner- table, that before going any further the company generally should be asked whether, if the brooch could be produced, that would under the circumstances be a satisfactory proof of occult agency in the matter. We carefully re\\aewed the manner in which the situation had been developed, and we all came to the conclusion that the test would be absolutely complete, and that on this occasion there was no weak place in the chain of the argument. Then it was that Madame Blavatsky said the brooch would be brought to the garden, and that we could go out and search for it. An interesting circumstance for those who had already watched some of the other phenomena I have described was this : The brooch, as stated above, was found wrapped up in two cigai-ette papers, and these, when examined in a full light in the house, were found still to bear the mark of the coin attached to Madame Blavatsky's watch chain, which had been wrapped up in them before they departed on their mysterious errand. They were thus identified for people who had got over the first stupendous difiiculty of believing in the possibility of transporting material objects by occult agency, as the same papers that had been seen by us at the dinner-table. The occult transmission of objects to a distance not being \"magic,\" as Western readers understand the word, is susceptible of some partial explanation even for ordinary readers, for whom the means by which the forces employed are manipulated must remain entii-ely mysterious. It is not contended that the currents which are made use of, convey the bodies transmitted in a solid mass just as they exist for the senses. The body, to be transmitted, is"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"6o THE OCCULT WORLD. supposed first to be disintegrated, conveyed on the currents in infinitely minute particles, and then reintegrated at its destination. In the case of the brooch, the first thing to be done must have been to find it. This, however, would simply be a feat of clairvoyance — the scent of the ol:)ject, so to speak, being taken up from the person who spoke of it and had once possessed it — and there is no clairvoyance of which the Western world has any knowledge, comparable in its vivid intensity to the clairvoyance of an adept in occultism. Its resting-place thus discovered, the disin- tegration process would come into play, and the object desh^ed would be conveyed to the place where the adept engaged with it would choose to have it deposited. The part played in the phenomenon by the cigarette papers would be this : In order that we might be able to find the brooch, it was necessary to connect it by an occult scent with Madame Blavatsky. The cigarette papers, which she always carried about with her, were thus impi-egnated with her magnetism, and taken from her by the Brother, left an occult trail behind them. Wrapped round the l^rooch, they conducted this trail to the required spot. The magnetization of the cigarette papers always with her, enabled Madame Blavatsky to perform a little feat with them which was found by every one for whom it was done an exceedingly complete bit of evidence ; though here again the superficial resemblance of the experiment to a conjuring trick misled the intelligence of ordinary persons who read about the incidents referred to in the newspapers. The feat itself may be most conveniently discussed by the quotation of three letters which appeared in the Pioneer of the 23rd of October, and w^ere as follows : — \" Sir, — The account of the discovery of Mrs. Hume's brooch has called forth several letters, and many questions have been asked, some of which I may answer on a future occasion, but I think it only right to first con- tribute further testimony to the occult powers possessed by Madame Blavatsky. In thus coming before the public, one must be prepared for ridicule, but it is a weapon which we who know something of these matters can well afibrd to despise. On Thursday last, at about half-past ten o'clock, I was sitting in Madame Tdavatsky's room conversing with her, and in a casual way asked her if she would be able to send uie any- thing by occult means when T returned to my home. She said \"No;\" and explained to me some of the laws under which she acts, one being that she must know the place and have been there — the more recently the better — in order to establish a magnetic current. She then recol-"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"RE CENT OCCULT PHENOMENA . 6 1 lected that she had been somewhere that morning, and after a moment's reflection remembered whose house it was she had visited.* She said she could send a ci,2^arette there, if I would go at once (o verify the fact. I, of course, consented. I must here mention that I had seen her do this kind of thing once before ; and the reason she gives for sending cigarettefi is, that the paper and tobacco being always about her person, are highly magnetized, and therefore more amenable to her power, which she most emphatically declares is not supernatural, but merely the manifestation of laws unknown to us. To continue my story. She took out a ciga- rette paper and slowly tore off a corner as zigzag as possible, I never taking my eyes off her hands. She gave me the corner, which I at once put into an envelope, and it never left my possession I can declare.^ She made the cigarette with the remainder of the paper. She then said she would try an experiment which might not succeed, but the failure Avould be of no consequence with me. She then most certainly put that ciga- rette into the fire, and I saw it burn, and I started at once to the gentle- man's house, scarcely able to believe that I should find in the place in- dicated by her the counterpart of the cigarette paper I had with me ; but sure enough there it was, and, in the presence of the gentleman and his wife, I opened out the cigarette and found my corner-piece fitted exactly. It would be useless to try and explain any theory in connection with these phenomena, and it would be unreasonable to expect any one to believe in them, unless their own experience had proved the possibility of such wonders. All one asks or expects is, that a few of the more intelligent members of the community may be led to look into the vast amount of evidence now accumulated of the phenomena taking place all over Europe and America. It seems a pity that the majority should be in such utter ignorance of these facts ; it is within the power of any one visiting England to convince himself of their truth. \" Alice Gordon.\" \" Sir, — I have been asked to give an account of a circumstance which took place in my presence on the 13 instant. On the evening of that day I was sitting alone with Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott in the drawing-room of Mr, Sinnett's house in Simla. After some conversa- tion on various matters, Madame Blavatsky said she would like to try an experiment in a manner which had been suggested to her by Mr. Sinnett. She, therefore, took two cigarette papers from her pocket and marked on each of them a number of parallel lines in pencil. She then tore a piece off the end of each paper across the lines, and gave them to me. At that time Madame Blavatsky was sitting close to me, and I intently watched her proceedings, my eyes being not more than two feet from her hands. She declined to let me mark or tear the papers, alleging that if handled by others they would become imbued with their personal magnetism, which would counteract her own. However, the torn pieces were handed directly to me, and 1 could not observe any opportunity for the substitu- tion of other papers by sleight of hand. The genuineness or otherwise of the phenomena afterwards presented appears to rest on this point. * This house at which the cigarette was found was Mr. O'Meara's. He is quite willing that this should be stated."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"'62 THE OCCULT WORLD. The torn-off pieces of the paper renitained in my closed left hand until the conclusion of the experiment. Of the largrer pieces Madame Blavatsky made two cigarettes, giving the first to me to hold while the other was being made up. 1 scrutinized this cigarette very attentively, in order to be able to recognize it afterwards. The cigarettes being finished, Madame Blavat- sky stood up, and took them between her hands, which she rubbed to- gether. After about twenty or thirty seconds, the grating noise of the paper, at first distinctly audible, ceased. She then said the current* is passing round this end of the room, and 1 can only send them somewhere near here. A moment afterwards she said one had fallen on the piano, the other near that bracket. As I sat on a sofa with my back to the wall the piano was opposite, and the bracket, supporting a few pieces of china, was to the right, between it and the door. Both were in full view across the rather narrow room. The top of the piano was covered with piles of music books, and it was among these Madame Blavatsky thought a cigarette would be found. The books were removed, one by one, by my- self, but without seeing anything. I then opened the piano, and founS a cigarette on a narrow shelf inside it. This cigarette I took out and recognized as the one I had held in my hand. The other was found in a covered cup on the bracket. Both cigarettes were still damp where they had been moistened at the edges in the process of manufacture. 1 took the cigarettes to a table, without permitting them to be touched or even seen by Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott. On being unrolled and smoothed out, the torn, jagged edges were found to fit exactly to the pieces that I had all this time retained in my hand. The pencil marks also corresponded. It would therefore appear that the papers were actu- ally the same as those I had seen torn. Both the papers are still in my possession. It may be added that Colonel Olcott sat near me with his back to Madame Blavatsky during the experiment, and did not move till it was concluded. \"P. J. Maitlaxd, Captain^ \" SiK, — With reference to the correspondence now filling your columns, on the subject of Madame Blavatsky's recent manifestations, it may in- terest your readers if I record a striking iucidoit which took place last week in my presence. I had occasion to call on Madame, and in the course of our interview she tore off a corner from a cigarette paper, asking me to hold the same, which I did. AVith the remainder of the paper she prepared a cigarette in the ordinary manner, and in a few moments caused this cigarette to disappear from her hands. We were sitting at the time in the drawing-room. I inquired if it were likely to find this cigarette again, and after a short pause Madame requested me to accom- pany her into the dining-room, where the cigarette would be found on the top of a curtain hanging over the window. By means of a table and a chair placed thereon, I was enabled with some difficulty to reach and take down a cigarette from the place indicated. This cigarette I opened, and found the paper to correspond exactly with that I had seen a few minutes * The theory is that a current of what can only be called magnetism, can be made to convey objects, previously dissipated by the same Ibrce, to any distance, and in spite of the intervention of any amount of matter."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"RECENT OCCULT PHENOMENA. before in the drawing-room. That is to say, the corner-piece, which I had retained in my possession, fitted exactly into the jagged edges of the torn paper in which the tobacco had been rolled. To the best of my be- lief, the test was as complete and satisfactory as any test can be. 1 re- frain from giving my opinion as to the causes which produced the effect, feeling sure that your readers who take an interest in these phenomena will prefer exercising their own judgment in tlie matter. 1 merely give you an unvarnished statement of what I saw. I may be permitted to add I am not a member of the Theosophist Society, nor, so far as I know, am I biassed in favour of occult science, although a warm sympathizer with the proclaimed objects of the Society over which Colonel Olcott presides. \"Charles Fkancis Massy.\" Of course, cany one familiar with conjuring will be aware that an imitation of this \"trick\" can be arranged by a person gifted with a little sleight of hand. You take two pieces of paper, and tear off a corner of both together, so that the jags of both are the same. You make a cigarette \\vith one piece, and put it in the place where you mean to have it ultimately found. You then hold the other piece underneath the one you tear in presence of the spectator, slip in one of the already torn corners into his hand instead of that he sees you tear, make your cigarette with the other part of the original piece, dispose of that anyhow you please, and allow the prepared cigarette to be found. Other variations of the system may be readily imagined, and for per- sons who have not actually seen Madame Blavatsky do one of her cigarette feats it may be useless to point out that she does not do them as a conjuror would, and that the spectator, if he is gifted with ordinary common sense, can never have the faintest shadow of a doubt about the corner given to him being the corner torn off — a certainty which the pencil- marks upon it, drawn before his eyes, would enhance, if that were necessary. However, as I say, though experience shows me that the outsider is prone to regard the little cigarette phenomenon as \" suspicious,\" it has never failed to be regarded as convincing by the most acute people among those who have witnessed it. With all phenomena, however, stupidity on the part of the observer will defeat any attempt to reach his understanding, no matter how perfect the tests supphed. I realize this more fully now than at the time of which I am writing. Then I was chiefly anxious to get experiments arranged which should be really complete in their details"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"64 THE OCCULT WORLD, and leave no opening for the suggestion even of imposture. It was an uphill struggle first, because Madame Blavatsky was intractable and excitable as an experimentalist, and herself no more than the recipient of favours from the Brothers in reference to the greater phenomena. And it seemed to me conceivable that the Brothers might themselves not always realize precisely the frame of mind in which persons of European training approached the consideration of such miracles as these with which we were deahng, so that they did not always make sufficient allowance for the necessity of rendering their test phenomena quite perfect and unassailable in all minor details. I knew, of course, that they were not primarily anxious to convince the commonplace world of anything whatever ; but still they frequently did assist Madame Blavatsky to produce phenomena that had no other motive except the production of an effect on the minds of people belonging to the outer world ; and it seemed to me that under these circumstances they might just as well do something that would leave no room for the imputation even of any trickery. One day, therefore, I asked Madame Blavatsky whether if I wrote a letter to one of the Brothers explaining my views, she could get it delivered for me. I hardly thought this was probable, as I knew how very unapproachable the Brothers generally are ; but as she said that at any rate she would try, I wrote a letter, addressing it \" to the Unknown Brother,\" and gave it her to see if any result would ensue. It was a happy inspiration that induced me to do this, for out of that small beginning has arisen the most interesting correspondence in which I have ever been privileged to engage — a correspondence which, I am happy to say, still promises to continue, and the existence of which, more than any experiences of phenomena which I have had, though the most wonderful of these are yet to be described, is the raison (Vetre of this little book. The idea I had specially in my mind when I ^vrote the letter above referred to, was that of all test phenomema one could wish for, the best would be the production in our presence in India of a copy of the London Times of that day's date. With such a piece of evidence in my hand, I argued, I would undertake to convert everybody in Simla who was capable of linldng two ideas together, to a belief in"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"RECENT OCCULT PHENOMENA. 65 the possibility of obtaining by occult agency physical results which were beyond the control of ordinary science. I am sorry that I have not kept copies of the letter itself nor of my own subsequent letters, as they would have helped to elucidate the repHes in a convenient way ; but I did not at the time foresee the develojDments to which they would give rise, and, after all, the interest of the correspondence turns almost entirely on the letters I received : only in a very small degree on those I sent. A day or two elapsed before I heard anything of the fate of my letter, but Madame Blavatsky then informed me that I was to have an answer. I afterwards learned that she had not been able at first to find a Brother willing to receive the communication. Those whom she first apphed to dechned to be troubled with the matter. At last her psychological telegraph brought her a favourable answer from one of the Brothers with whom she had not for some time been in communication. He would take the letter and reply to it. Hearing this, I at once regretted that I had not wi^itten at greater length, arguing my view of the required conces- sion more fully. I wrote again, therefore, without waiting for the actual receipt of the expected letter. A day or two after I found one evening on my ^vriting- table the first letter sent me by my new correspondent. I may here explain, what I learned afterwards, that he was a native of the Punjab who was attracted to occult studies from his earhest boyhood. He was sent to Europe whilst still a youth at the intervention of a relative — himself an occultist — to be educated m Western knowledge, and since then has been fully initiated in the greater knowledge of the East. From the self-complacent point of view of the ordinary European this will seem a strange reversal of the proper order of things, but I need not stop to examine that consideration now. My correspondent is known to me as Ivoot Hoomi Lai Sing. This is his \"Thibetan Mystic name\" — occultists, it would seem, taking new names on initiation — a practice which has no doubt given rise to similar customs which we find perpetuated here and there in ceremonies of the Homan Cathohc church. The letter I received began, in medias res, about the F"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"66 THE OCCULT WORLD. plie'nomenon I had proposed. \" Precisely,\" Koot Hoomi wrote, '' because the test of the London newspaper would close the mouths of the sceptics,\" it was inadmissible. \" See it in what light you will, the world is yet in its first stage of disenthralment .... hence unprepared. Very true we work by natural, not supernatural, means and laws. But, as on the one hand science would find itself unable, in its present state, to account for the wonders given in its name, and on the other the ignorant masses would still be left to view the phenomenon in the light of a miracle, every one who would thus be made a witness to the occurrence would be thrown off* liis balance, and the result would be deplor- able. BeHeve me it would be so especially for yourself, who originated the idea, and for the devoted woman who so foolishly rushes into the wide, open door leading to notoriety.

Ay, but is it verily so, my respected friend ? Experimental knowledge does not quite date from 1662, when Bacon, Kobert Boyle, and the Bishop of Chester transformed under the royal cjiarter their 'invisible college' into a society for the promotion of experimental science. Ages before the Royal Society found itself becoming a reality upon the plan of the * Prophetic Scheme,' an innate longing for the hidden, a passionate love for, and the study of, Nature, had led men in every generation to try and fathom her secrets deeper than their neiglibours did. Pioma ante Roimdum fuit is an axiom taught us in your Enghsh schools The Vril of the Coining Race was the common property of races now extinct. And as the very existence of those gigantic ancestors of ours is now questioned — though in the Hima- vats, on the very territory belonging to you, we have a cave full of the skeletons of these giants — and their huge frames, when found, are invariably regarded as isolated freaks of Nature — so the vril, or akas as we call it, is looked upon as an impossibility— a myth. And without a thorough know- ledge of akas — its combinations and properties, how can science hope to account for such phenomena % We doubt not but the men of your science are open to conviction ; yet facts must be first demonstrated to them ; they mu«t first have become their own property, have proved amen- able to their modes of investigation, before you find them ready to admit them as facts. If you but look into the preface to the Microgra2:)hia you will find, in Hookes' sug- gestions, that the intimate relations of objects were of less account in his eyes than their external operation on the senses, and Ne^vton's fine discoveries found in him their greatest opponent. The modern Hookeses are many. Like this learned but ignorant man of old, your modern men of science are less anxious to suggest a physical con- nection of facts which might unlock for them many an occult force in Nature, as to provide a convenient classifica- tion of scientific experiments, so that the most essential quality of a hypothesis is, not that it should be true, but only 2^l(^usihle, in their opinion.

In common with many, you blame us for our great secrecy. Yet we know something of human nature, for the experience of long cen- turies — ay, ages, has taught us. And we know that so long as science has anything to learn, and a shadow of rehgious dogmatism lingers in the hearts of the multitudes, the world's prejudices have to be conquered step by step, not at a rush. As hoary antiquity had more than one Socrates, so the dim future will give birth to more than one martyr. Enfranchised Science contemptuously turned away her face from the Coper- nican ©ijinion renewing the theories of Aristarchus Samius, who ' aliii-meth that the earth moveth circularly about her own centre,' years before the Church sought to sacrifice Galileo as a holocaust to the Bible.

Yerily so, but the chronicles of our modern days do not differ very essentially from their predecessors. And we have but to bear in mind the recent persecutions of mediums in England, the burning of supposed witches and sorcerers in South America, Russia, and the frontiers of Spain, to assure ourselves that the only salvation of the genuine proficients in occult sciences lies in the scepticism of the public : the charlatans and the jugglers are the natural shields of the adepts. The public safety is only ensured by our keeping secret the terrible weapons which might otherwise be used against it, and which, as you have been told, become deadly in the hands of the wicked and selfish.\" The remainder of the letter is concerned chiefly with per- sonal matters, and need not be here reproduced. I shall, of course, throughout my quotations from Koot Hoomi's letters leave out passages which, specially addressed to myself, have no immediate bearing on the public argument. The reader must be careful to remember, however, as I now most unequivocally afiirm, that I shall in no case alter one syllable of the passages actually quoted. It is important to make this declaration very emphatically, because the more my readers may be acquainted with India, the less they will be willing to beheve, except on the most positive testi- mony, that the letters from Koot Hoomi, as I now publish them, have been written by a native of India. That such is the fact, however, is beyond dispute. I replied to the letter above quoted at some length, arguing, if I remember rightly, that the European mind was less hopelessly intractable than Koot Hoomi represented it. His second letter was as follows : — \"We will be at cross purposes in our correspondence until it has been made entirely plain that occult science has its own methods of research, as fixed and arbitrary as the methods of its antithesis, physical science, are in their way. If the latter has its dicta, so also have the former ; and he w^ho would cross the boundary of the unseen world can no more prescribe how he will proceed, than the traveller who tries to penetrate to the inner subterranean recesses of L'Hassa the Blessed could show the way to his guide.

At no time have more than a scarcely appreciable minority of men possessed Nature's secret, though multitudes have witnessed the practical evidences of the possibility of their possession. The adept is the rare efflorescence of a generation of inquirers ; and to become one, he must obey the inward impulse of his soul, irrespective of the prudential considera- tions of worldly science or sagacity. Your desire is to be brought to communicate with one of us directly, without the agency of either Madame Blavatsky or any medium. Your idea would be, as I understand it, to obtain such communications, either by letters, as the' present one, or by audible words, so as to be guided by one of us in the management, and principally in the instruction of the Society. You seek all this, and yet, as you say yourself, hitherto you have not found sufficient reasons to even, give up your modes of life, directly hostile to such modes of communication. This is hardly reasonable. He who would lift up high the banner of mysticism and proclaim its reign near at hand must give the example to others. He must be the first to change his modes of hfe, and, regarding the study of the occult mysteries as the upper step in the ladder of knowledge, must loudly proclaim it such, despite exact science and the ojjposition of society. 'The kingdom of Heaven is obtained by force,' say the Christian mystics. It is but with armed hand, and ready to either conquer or perish, that the modern mystic can hope to achieve his object. \" My first answer covered, I believe, most of the questions contained in your second and even third letter. Having, then, expressed therein my opinion that the world in general was unripe for any too staggering proof of occult power, there but remains to deal with the isolated individuals who seek, like yourself, to penetrate behind the veil of matter into the world of primal causes — i.e., we need only consider now the cases of yourself and Mr. ^\" I should here explain that one of my friends at Simla, deeply interested with me in the progress of this investiga- tion, had, on reading Koot Hoomi's first letter to me, addressed my correspondent himself. More favourably circumstanced than I, for such an enterprise, he had even"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"RECENT OCCULT PHENOMENA. 71 proposed to make a complete sacrifice of his other pursuits, to pass away into any distant seclusion which might be appointed for the purpose, where he might, if accepted as a pupil in occultism, learn enough to return to the world armed with powers which would enable him to demonstrate the realities of spiritual development and the errors of modern materialism, and then devote his life to the task of combating modern incredulity and leading men to a practical comprehension of a better life. I resume Koot Hoomi's letter : — \" This gentleman also has done me the great honour to address me by name, offering to me a few questions, and stating the conditions upon which he would be wilhng to work for us seriously. But your motives and aspirations being of diametrically opposite character, and hence leading to different results, I must reply to each of you separately. \" The first and chief consideration in determining us to accept or reject your offer lies in the inner motive which propels you to seek our instruction and, in a certain sense, our guidance ; the latter in all cases under reserve, as I understand it, and therefore remaining a question inde- pendent of aught else.' Now, what are your motives'? I may try to define them in their general aspects, lea\\T[ng details for further consideration. They are — (i) The desire to see positive and unimpeachable proofs that there really are forces in Nature of which science knows nothing ; (2' The hoj^e to appropriate them some day — the sooner the better, for you do not hke to wait — so as to enable yourself ; {a) to demonstrate their existence to a few chosen Western minds ; (6) to contemplate future Hfe as an objective reahty built upon the rock of knowledge, not of faith ; and (c) to finally learn — most important this, among all your motives, perhaps, though the most occult and the best guarded — the whole truth about our lodges and ourselves ; to get, in short, the positive assurance that the ' Brothers,' of whom every one hears so much and sees so little, are real entities, not fictions of a disordered, hallucinated brain. Such, viewed in their best light, appear to us your motives for addressing me. And in the same spirit do I answer them, hoping that my sincerity will not be interpreted in a wrong way, or attributed to anything like an unfriendly spirit."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"72 THE OCCULT WORLD. \" To our minds, then, these motives, sincere and worthy of every serious consideration from tlie worldly standpoint, appear selfish. (You have to pardon me what you might view as crudeness of language, if your desire is that which you really profess — to learn truth and get instruction from us who belong to quite a different world from the one you move in.) They are selfish, because you must be aware that the chief object of the Theosophical Society is not so much to gratify individual aspirations as to serve our fellow-men, and the real value of this term 'selfish,' which may jar upon your ear, has a peculiar significance \\\\T.th us which it cannot have with you ; therefore, to begin with, you must not accept it otherwise than in the former sense. Perhaps you will better appreciate our meaning when told that in our view the highest aspirations for the welfare of humanity become tainted with selfishness, if, in the mind of the philanthropist, there lurks the shadow of a desire for self- benefit, or a tendency to do injustice, even where these exist unconsciously to himself. Yet you have ever dis- cussed, but to put down, the idea of a Universal Brother- hood, questioned its usefulness, and advised to remodel the Theosophical Society on the principle of a college for the special study of occultism \" Having disposed of personal motives, let us analyze your terms for helping us to do pubhc good. Broadly stated, these terms are — first, that an independent Anglo- Indian Theosophical Society shall be founded through your kind services, in the management of which neither of our present representatives shall have any voice ;* and, second, that one of us shall take the new body ' under his patronage,' be ' in free and direct communication wdtli its leaders,' and * In the absence of my own letter, to which this is a reply, the reader might think from this sentence that I had been animated by some un- friendly feeling for the representatives referred to — Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott. This is far from having been the case ; but, keenly alive to mistakes which had been made up to the time of which I am •writing, in the management of the Theosophical Society, Mr. and myself were under the -impression that better public results might be obtained by commencing operations de novo, and taking, ourselves, the direction of the measures which might be employed to recommend the study of occultism to the modern world. This belief on our part was co- existent in both cases with a warm friendship based on the purest esteem for both the persons mentioned."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"RECENT OCCULT PHENOMENA. 73 afford them 'direct proof that he really possessed that superior knowledge of the forces of Nature and the attri- butes of the human soul which would inspire them with proper confidence in his leadership.' I have copied your own words so as to avoid inaccuracy in defining the position. \" From your point of view, therefore, those terms may seem so very reasonable as to provoke no dissent, and, indeed, a majority of your countrymen — if not of Europeans — might share that opinion. What, will you say, can be more reasonable than to ask that that teacher anxious to disseminate his knowledge, and pupil offering him to do so, should be brought face to face, and the one give the ex- perimental proof to the other that his instructions were correct % Man of the world, living in, and in full sympathy with it, you are undoubtedly right. But the men of this other world of ours, untutored in your modes of thought, and who find it very hard at times to follow and appreciate the latter, can hardly be blamed for not responding as heartily to your suggestions as in your opinion they de- serve. The first and most important of our objections is to be found in our rules. True, we have our schools and teachers, our neophytes and ' shaberons' (superior adepts), and the door is always open to the right man who knocks. And we invariably welcome the new comer ; only, instead of going over to him, he has to come to us. More than that, unless he has reached that point in the path of occultism from which return is impossible by his having irrevocably pledged himself to our Association, w^e never — except in cases of utmost moment — visit him or even cross the threshold of his door in visible appearance. \" Is any of you so eager for knowledge and the beneficent powders it confers, as to be ready to leave your world and come into ours? Then let him come, but he must not think to return until the seal of the mysteries has locked his lips even against the chances of his own weakness or indiscretion. Let him come by all means as the pupil to the master, and without conditions, or let him wait, as so many others have, and be satisfied with such crumbs of knowledge as may fall in his way. \" And supposing you were thus to come, as two of your own countrymen have already — as Madame B. did and Mr. 0. will — supposing you were to abandon all for the truth ;"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"74 THE OCCULT WORLD. to toil wearily for years up the hard, steep road, not daunted by obstacles, firm under every temptation ; were to faith- fully keep within your heart the secrets entrusted to you as a ti'ial ; had worked with all your energies and unselfishly to spread the truth and provoke men to correct thinking and a correct life — would you consider it just, if, after all your efforts, we were to grant to Madame B. or Mr. 0. as ' outsiders' the terms you now ask for yourselves. Of these two persons, one has already given three-fourths of a hfe, the other six years of manhood's prime to us, and both will so labour to the close of their days ; though ever working for their merited reward, yet never demanding it, nor mur- muring when disappointed. Even though they respectively could accomplish far less than they do, would it not be a palpable injustice to ignore them in an important field of Theosophical effort '? Ingratitude is not among our vices, nor do we imagine you would wish to advise it. \" Neither of them has the least inclination to interfere with the management of the contemplated Anglo-Indian Branch, nor dictate its officers. But the new Society, if formed at all, must, though bearing a distinctive title of its own, be, in fact, a branch of the parent body, as is the British Theosophical Society at London, and contribute to its vitality and\\isefulness by promoting its leading idea of a Universal Brotherhood, and in other practicable w^ays. \" Badly as the phenomena may have been shown, there have still been, as yourself admit, certain ones that are unimpeachable. The 'raps on the table when no one touches it,' and the ' bell sounds in the air,' have, you say, always been regarded as satisfactory, &c. &c. From tliis, you reason that good test phenomena ' may easily be multi- plied ad infinitum.' So they can — in any place where our magnetic and other conditions are constantly offered, and where we do not have to act with and through an enfeebled female body, in which, as we might say, a vital cyclone is raging nuich of the time. But imperfect as may be our visible agent, yet she is the best available at present, and her phenomena have for about half a century astonished and baffled some of the cleverest minds of the age \" Two or three little notes which I next received from Koot Hoomi had reference to an incident I must now describe, the perfection of which as a test phenomenon"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"RECENT OCCUL T PHENOMENA. 75 appears to me more complete than that of any other I have yet described. It is worth notice, by-the-by, that although the circumstances of this incident were related in the Indian papei's at the time, the happy company of scoffers who flooded the Press with their simple comments on the brooch phenomenon, never cared to discuss \" the pillow incident.\" Accompanied by our guests, we went to have lunch one day on ^le top of a neighbouring hill. The night before, I had had reason to think that my corresjDondent, Koot Hoomi, had been in what, for the purpose of the present explanation, I may call subjective communication with me. I do not go into any details, because it is unnecessary to trouble the general reader with impressions of that sort. After discussing the subject in the morning, I found on the hall-table a note from Koot Hoomi, in which he promised to give me something on the hill which should be a token of his (astral) presence near me the previous night. We went to our destination, camped down on the top of the hill, and were engaged on our lunch, when Madame Blavatsky said Koot Hoomi was asking where we would like to find the object he was going to send me. Let it be understood that up to this moment there had been no conversation in regard to the phenomenon I was expecting. The usual suggestion will, perhaps, be made that Madame Blavatsky \" led up\" to the choice I actually made. The fact of the matter was simply that in the midst of altogether other talk Madame Blavatsky pricked up her ears on hear- ing her occult voice — at once told me what was the question asked, and did not contribute to the selection made by one single remark on the subject. In fact, there was no general discussion, and it was by an absolutely spontaneous choice of my own that I said, after a little reflection, \" inside that cushion,\" pointing to one against which one of the ladies present was leaning. I had no sooner uttered the words than my wife cried out, \" Oh, no, let it be inside mine,\" or words to that effect. I said, \" very w^ell, inside my wife's cushion ;\" Madame Blavatsky asked Koot Hoomi by her own methods if that would do, and received an affirmative reply. My liberty of choice as regards the place where the object should be found was thus absolute and unfettered by conditions. The most natural choice for me to have made under the circumstances, and having regard to our previous"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"76 THE OCCULT WORLD. experiences, would have been up some particular tree, or buried in a particular spot of the ground ; but the inside of <a sewn-up cushion, fortuitously chosen on the spur of a moment, struck me, as my eye happened to fall upon the cushion I mentioned first, as a particularly good place ; and when I had started the idea of a cushion, my wife's amend- ment to the original proposal was really an improvement, for the particular cushion then selected had never been for a moment out of her own possession all the morning. It w^as her usual jampan cushion; she had been leaning against it all the way from home, and was leaning against it still, as her jampan had been carried right up to the top of the hill, and she had continued to occupy it. The cushion itself was very firmly made of w^orsted work and velvet, and had been in our possession for years. It always remained, when we w^ere at home, in the drawing-room, in a conspicuous corner of a certain sofa whence, when my wife went out, it would be taken to her jampan and again brought in on her return. When the cushion was agreed to, my wife was told to put it under her rug, and she did this with her OAvn hands, inside her jampan. It may have been there about a minute, when Madame Blavatsky said we could set to work to cut it open. I did this with a penknife, and it was a work of some time, as the cushion was very securely sewn all round, and very strongly, so that it had to be cut open almost stitch by stitch, and no tearing was possible. When one side of the cover was completely ripped up, we found that the feathers of the cushion were enclosed in a separate inner case, also sewn round all the edges. There was nothing to be found between the inner cushion and the outer case ; so we proceeded to rip up the inner cushion ; and this done, my wife searched among the feathers. The first thing she found was a little three-cornered note, addressed to me in the now familiar handwriting of my occult correspondent. It ran as follows : — \" My ' DEAR Brother,' — This brooch, No. 2, is placed in this very strange place, simply to show you how very easily a real phenomenon is produced, and how still easier it is to suspect its genuineness. Make of it what you Hke, even to classing me with confederates. \" The dLtficulty you spoke of last night with respect to"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"RECENT OCCULT PHENOMENA. 77 the interchange of our letters, I will try to remove. One of our pupils will shortly visit Lahore and the K. W. P. ; and an address will be sent to you which you can always use ; unless, indeed, you really would j)refer corresponding through — pillows'? Please to remark that the present is not dated from a ' Lodge,' but from a Kashmere valley.\" While I was reading this note, my wife discovered, by further search among the feathers, the brooch referred to, one of her own, a very old and very famihar brooch which she generally left on her dressing-table when it was not in use. It would have been impossible to invent or imagine a proof of occult power, in the nature of mechanical proofs, more irresistible and convincing than this incident was for us who had personal knowledge of the various circumstances described. The whole force and significance to us of the brooch thus returned, hinged on to my subjective impres- sions of the previous night. The reason for selecting the brooch as a thing to give us dated no earlier than then. On the hypothesis, therefore, idiotic hypothesis as it would be on all grounds, that the cushion must have been got at by Madame Blavatsky, it must have been got at since I spoke of my impressions that morning, shortly after breakfast ; but from the time of getting up that morning, Madame Blavatsky had hardly been out of our sight, and had been sitting with my wife in the drawing-room. She had been doing this, by-the-by, against the grain, for she had writing which she wanted to do in her own room, but she had been told by her voices to go and sit in the drawing- room with my wife that morning, and had done so, grumbling at the interruption of her work, and wholly unable to discern any motive for the order. The motive was afterwards clear enough, and had reference to the intended phenomenon. It was desirable that we should have no arriere j^Qnsee in our minds as to what Madame Blavatsky might possibly have been doing during the morning, in the event of the incident taking such a turn as to make that a factor in determining its genuineness. Of course, if the selection of the pillow could have been foreseen, it would have been unnecessary to victimize our \" old Lady,\" as we generally called her. The presence of the famous pillow itself, with my wife all the morning in the drawing- room, would have been enough. But perfect Hberty of"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"78 THE OCCULT WORLD. choice was to be left to me in selecting a cache for the brooch ; and the pillow can have been in nobody's mind, any more than in my own, beforehand. The language of the note given above embodied many little points which had a meaning for us. All through, it bore indirect reference to the conversation that had taken place at our dinner-table the previous evening. I had been talking of the little traces here and there which the long letters from Koot Hoomi bore, showing, in spite of their splendid mastery over the language and the vigour of their style, a turn or two of expression that an Englishman would not have made use of ; for example, in the form of address, which in the two letters already quoted had been tinged mth Orientahsm. \" But what should he have written ?\" somebody asked, and I had said, \" under similar circum- stances an Enghshman would probably have written simply : ^ My dear Brother.' \" Then the allusion to the Kashmir Valley as the place from which the letter was written, instead of from a Lodge, was an allusion to the same conversation ; and the underlining of the \" k\" was another, as Madame Blavatsky had been saying that Koot Hoomi's spelling of \" Skepticism\" with a \" k\" was not an Ameri- canism in his case, but due to a philological whim of his. The incidents of the day were not quite over, even when the brooch was found ; for that evening, after we had gone home, there fell from my napkin, after I had unfolded it at dinner, a little note, too private and personal to be reprinted fully, but part of which I am impelled to quote, for the sake of the allusion it contains to occult modus operandi. I must explain that, before starting for the hill, I had penned a few lines of thanks for the promise contained in the note then received as described. This note I gave to Madame Blavatsky, to despatch by occult methods if she had an opportunity. And she carried it in her hand as she and my wife went on in advance, in jampans, along the Simla Mall, not finding an opportunity until about half-way to our destination. Then she got rid of the note, occultism only knows how. This circumstance had been spoken of at the picnic ; and as I was opening the note found in the pillow, some one suggested that it would, perhaps, be found to contain an answer to my note just sent. It did not contain any allusion to this, as the reader will be already aware."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"RE CENT OCCULT PHENOMENA . 79 The note I received at dinner-time said : — \" A few words more. Why should you have felt disappointed at not receiving a direct reply to your last note. It was received in my room about half a minute after the currents for the production of the pillow dah, had been set ready, and in full play. And there was no necessity for an answer. ...\" It seemed to bring one in imagination one step nearer a realization of the state of the facts to hear \" the currents\" employed to accomplish what would have been a miracle for all the science of Europe, spoken of thus famiharly. A miracle for all the science of Europe, and as hard a fact for us, nevertheless, as the room in which we sat. We knew that the phenomenon we had seen was a wonderful reality ; that the thought-power of a man in Kashmir had picked up a material object from a table in Simla, and, disintegrating it by some process of which Western science does not yet dream, had passed it through other matter, and had there restored it to its original solidarity, the dispersed particles resuming their precise places as before, and reconstituting the object down to every line or scratch upon its surface. (By-the-by, it bore some scratches when it emerged from the pillow which it never bore before — the initials of our friend.) And we knew that written notes on tangible paper had been flashing backwards and forwards that day between our friend and ourselves, though hundreds of miles of Himalayan mountains intervened between us, and had been flashing backwards and forwards with the speed of electricity. And yet we knew that an impenetrable wall, built up of its own prejudice and obstinacy, of its learned ignorance and pohshed dulness, was established round the minds of scientific men in the West, as a body, across wliich we should never be able to carry our facts and our experience. And it is with a greater sense of oppression than people who have never been in a similar position will realize, that I now tell the story I have to tell, and know all the while that the solemn accuracy of its minutest detail, the utter truthfulness of every syllable in this record, is little better than incense to my own conscience — that the scientific minds of the West with which of all cultivated minds my own has hitherto been most in sympathy, will be closed to my testimony most hopelessly. \" Though one should rise from the dead,\" &c. It is the old story. It is the old story"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"8o THE OCCULT WORLD. at all events as regards the crashing results on opinion which such evidence as that I have been giving, ought to have. The smile of incredulity which thinks itself so wise and is so foolish, the suspicions which Hatter themselves they are so cuiniing, and are really the fruit of so much dulness, will gleam over these pages, and wither all their meaning — for the readers who smile. But I suppose that Koot Hoomi is not only right in declaring the world unripe as yet for too staggering a proof of occult power, but also in taking a friendly interest, as it will be seen presently that he does, in the little book I am wiiting, as one of the influences which bit by bit may sap the foundations of dog- matism and stupidity, on which science, which thinks itself so liberal, has latterly become so firmly rooted. The next letter — the tliird long one — that I received from Koot Hoomi, reached me shortly after my return for the cold weather to Allahabad. But I received one com- munication from him — a telegram — before its arrival, on the day of my own return to Allahabad. This telegram, of no great importance as regards its contents, wliich were little more than an expression of thanks for some letters I had written in the papers, was, nevertheless, of great interest indirectly, affording me, as it ultimately did, evidence of a kind which could appeal to other minds besides my own, that Koot Hoomi's letters were not, as some ingenious persons may have been incHned to imagine — in spite of various mechanical difficulties in the way of the tlieory^the work of Madame Blavatsky. For me, knomng her as intimately as I did, the inherent evidence of the style was enough to make the suggestion that she might have written them, a mere absurdity. And, if it is urged that the authoress of \" Isis Unveiled\" has certainly a command of language which renders it difficult to say what she could not write, the answer is simple. In the produc- tion of this book she was so largely helped by the Brothers, that great portions of it are not i-eally her work at all. She never makes any disguise of this fact, though it is one of a kind which it is useless for her to proclaim to the world at large, as it would be perfectly unintelligible, except to persons who knew something of the external facts, at all events, of occultism. Koot Hoomi's letters, as I say, are perfectly unhke her own style. But, in reference to"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"RECENT OCCULT PHENOMENA. 8i some of them, receiving them as I did while she was in the house with me, it was not mechanically impossible that she might have been the writer. Now, the telegram I received at Allahabad, which was wired to me from Jhelum, was in reply specially to a letter I addressed to Koot Hoomi just before leaving Simla, and enclosed to Madame Blavatsky, who had started some days previously, and was then at Amritsur. She received the letter, with its enclosure, at Amritsur on the 27 th of October, as I came to know, not merely from knowing when I sent it, but positively by means of the envelope which she returned to me at Allaha- bad by direction of Koot Hoomi, not in the least knowing why he wished it sent to me. I did not at first see what on earth was the use of the old envelope to me, but I put it away and afterwards obtained the clue to the idea in Koot Hoomi's mind when Madame Blavatsky wrote me word that he wanted me to obtain the original of the Jhelum telegram. Through the agency of a friend connected with the adminis- tration of the telegraph department, I was enabled even- tually to obtain a sight of the original of the telegram — a message of about twenty words ; and then I saw the mean- ing of the envelope. The message was in Koot Hoomi's own handwriting, and it was an answer from Jhelum to a letter which the delivery post-mark on the envelope showed to have been delivered at Amritsur on the same day the message was sent. Madame Blavatsky assuredly was her- self at Amritsur on that date, seeing large numbers of people there in connection with the work of the Theoso- phical Society, and the handwriting of Koot Hoomi's letters, nevertheless, appears on a telegram undeniably handed in at the Jhelum office on that date. So, although some of Koot Hoomi's letters passed through her hands to me, she is proved not to be their writer, as she is certainly not the producer of their handwriting. Koot Hoomi was probably himself actually at or near Jhelum at the time, as he came down into the midst of the world for a few days, under peculiar circumstances, to see Madame Blavatsky : the letter I received at Allahabad shortly after my return explained this. Our dear \" old Lady\" had been deeply hurt by the behaviour of some incredulous persons at Simla whom she had met at our house and elsewhere, who, being unable to G"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"82 THE OCCULT WORLD. assimiliite the experience they had had of her phenomena, got by degrees into that hostile frame of mind which is one of the phases of feehng I am now used to seeing developed. Perfectly unable to show how the phenomena can be the result of fraud, but thinking that, because they do not understand them, they must be fraudulent, people of a certain temperament become possessed with the spirit which animated persecution by religious authorities in the infancy of physical science. And, by a piece of bad luck, a gentleman wdio was thus affected was annoyed at a trifling indiscretion on the part of Colomsl Olcott, who, in a letter to one of the Bombay papers, quoted some expressions he had made use of in praise of the Theosophical Society and its good influence on the natives. All the irritation thus set up, worked on Madame Blavatsky's excitable temperament to an extent which only those who know her will be able to imagine. The allusions in Koot Hoomi's letter will now be understood. After some reference to important business with which he had been concerned since w^-iting to me last, Koot Hoomi went on : — \" You see, then, that we have weightier matters than small societies to think about ; yet the Theosophical Society must not be neglected. The affliir has taken an impulse which, if not well guided, might beget very evil issues. Kecall to mind the avalanches of your admired Alps, and remember that at first their mass is small, and their mo- mentum little. A trite comparison, you may say, but I cannot think of a better illustration when viewing the gradual aggregation of trifling events growing into a menacing destiny for the Theosophical Society. It came quite forcibly upon me- the other day as I was coming down the defiles of Konenlun — Karakorum you call them — and saw an avalanche tumble. I had gone personally to our chief .... and was crossing over to Lhadak on my way home. What other speculations might have followed I cannot say. But just as I was taking advantage of the awful stillness which usually follows such cataclysms, to get a clearer view of the present situation, and the disposition of the ' mystics' at Simla, I was rudely recalled to my senses.

Argument through space with one who was in cold despair and in a state of moral chaos, was useless. So I determined to emerge from a seclusion of many years, and spend some time with her to comfort her as well as I could. But our friend is not one to cause her mind to reflect the philosophical resignation of Marcus Aurelius. The Fates never wTote that she could say : — ' It is a royal thing when one is doing good to hear evil spoken of himself.' I had come for a few days, but now hnd that I myself cannot endure for any length of time the stifling magnetism even of my own countrymen. I have seen some of our proud old Sikhs drunk and stagger- ing over the marble pavement of their sacred temple. I have heard an English-speaking Yakil declaim against Yog Vidya and Theosophy as a delusion and a lie, declaring that English science had emancipated them from such degrading superstitions, and saying that it was an insult to India to maintain that the dirty Yogees and Sunnyasis knew any- thing about the mysteries of Nature, or that any living man can, or ever could, perform any phenomena.

The explanation, I have been informed, is that the Brothers who were anxious to save the British power at that time, regarding it as a better government for India than any system of native rule that could take its place, were quick to distribute information by their own methods when this could operate to quiet popular excitement and discourage new risings.

There is so very minute a point of contact between the two ci\\dliza- tions they respectively represent, that one might almost say they could not touch at all. Nor would they, but for the few — shall I say eccentrics ? — who, like you, dream better and bolder dreams than the rest, and, provoldng thought, bring the two together by their own admirable audacity.\" The letter before me at present is occupied so much with matters personal to myself, that I can only make quotations here and there ; but these are specially interesting, as in- vesting with an air of reahty subjects which are generally treated in vague and pompous language. Koot Hoomi was anxious to guard me from idealizing the Brothers too much on the strength of my admiration for their marvellous powers. \" Are you certain,\" he writes, \" that the pleasant impres- sion you now may have from our correspondence would not instantly be destroyed upon seeing me. And which of our holy sJtaherons has had the benefit of even the httle uni- versity education and inkling of European manners that has fallen to my share.\" In a guarded way, Koot Hoomi said that as often as it was practicable to communicate with me, \"whether by .... letters (in or out of pillows) or personal visits in astral foi'm, it will be done. But remember,\" he added, \"that Simla is 7,000 feet higher than Allahabad, and the Theosophical Society in India is one which the Government would do wisely to countenance and support. The suspicions directed against its founders in the first instance, misdirected as ihey were, were excusable enough, but now that the clu\\racter of the whole movement is better inulerstood, it would be well ibr the oflicers of the british Government in India who have any opportunity of the kind, to do whatever they can towards showing their sympathy with the promoters of the Society, who must, necessarily, have an uphill task to perform without such manifesta- tions of sympathy."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"RE CENT CCUL T PHENOMENA. 85 difficulties to be surmounted at the latter are tremendous.\" To the ordinary mind, feats of \" magic\" are hardly distin- guishable by degrees of difficulty, and the little hint con- tained in the last sentence may thus help to show that, magical as the phenomena of the Brothers appear (as soon as the dull-witted hypothesis of fraud is abandoned), they are magic of a kind which is amenable to its own laws. Most of the bodies in Nature were elements, in the infancy of chemistry ; but in turn the number is reduced by deeper and deeper researches into the law of combinations — and so with magic. To ride the clouds in a basket, or send messages under the sea, would have been magic in one age of the world, but becomes the commonplace of the next. The Simla phenomena are magic for the majority of this generation, but psychological telegraphy itself may become, if not the property of mankind a few generations hence, a fact of science as undeniable as the differential calculus, and known to be attainable by its own appropriate students. That it is easier to accomplish it and cognate achievements, in certain strata of the atmosphere rather than in others, is already a practical suggestion which tends to drag it down from the realms of magic ; or, as the same idea might be differently expressed, to lift it towards the region of exact science. I am here enabled to insert the greater part of a letter addressed by Koot Hoomi to the friend referred to in a former passage, as having opened up a correspondence with him in reference to the idea which he contemplated under certain conditions, of devoting himself entirely to the pursuit of occultism. This letter throws a great deal of light upon some of the metaphysical conceptions of the occultists, and their metaphysics, be it remembered, are a great deal more than abstract speculation. \" Dear Sir, — Availing of the first moments of leisure to formally answer your letter of the 17th ultimo, I will now report the result of my conference with our chiefs upon the proposition therein contained, trying at the same time to answer all your questions. \" I am first to thank j^ou on behalf of the whole section of our fraternity that is especially interested in the welfare of India for an offer of help whose importance and sincerity"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"S6 THE OCCULT WORLD. no one can doubt. Tracing our lineage through the vicissi- tudes of Indian civihzation from a remote past, we have a love for oar motherland so deep and passionate that it has survived even the broadening and cosmopolitanizing (pardon me if that is not an English word) effect of our studies in the laws of Nature. And so I, and every other Indian patriot, feel the strongest gratitude for every kind word or deed that is given in her behalf. \" Imagine, then, that since we are all con\\inced that the degradation of India is largely due to the suffocation of her ancient spirituality, and that whatever helps to restore that higher standard of thought and morals, must be a regene- rating national force, every one of us would naturally and without urging, be disposed to push forward a society whose proposed formation is under debate, especially if it reaUy is meant to become a society untainted by selfish motive, and whose object is the revival of ancient science, and tendency to rehabilitate our country in the world's estimation. Take- this for granted without further asseverations. But you know, as any man wdio has read history, that patriots may burst their hearts in vain if circumstances are against them. Sometimes it has happened that no human power, not even the fury and force of the loftiest patriotism, has been able to bend an iron destiny aside from its fixed course, and nations have gone out like torches dropped into the water in the engulfing blacknass of ruin. Thus, we who have the sense of our country's fall, though not the power to lift her up at once, cannot do as w^e would either as to general affairs or this jjarticular one. And with the readiness, but not the right to meet your advances more than half-way, we are forced to say that the idea entertained by Mr. Sinnett and yourself is impracticable in part. It is, in a word, impossible for myself or any Brother, or even an advanced neophyte, to be specially assigned and set apart as the guiding spirit or chief of the Anglo-Indian branch. We know it would be a good thing to have you and a few of your colleagues regularly instructed and shown the phenomena and their rationale. For though none but you few would be convinced, still it would be a decided gain to have even a few Englishmen, of first-class abihty, enhsted as students of Asiatic Psychology.

But what we do refuse is, to take any other responsibihty upon our- selves than this periodical correspondence and assistance with our advice, and, as occasion favours, such tangible, possibly \\dsible, proofs, as would satisfy you of our presence and interest. To ' guide' you we will not consent. How- ever much we may be able to do, yet we can promise only to give you the full measure of your deserts. Deserve much, and we will prove honest debtors ; Httle, and you need only expect a compensating return. This is not a mere text taken from a schoolboy's copybook, though it sounds so, but only the clumsy statement of the law of our order, and we cannot transcend it. Utterly unacquainted \\\\A\\X\\ Western, especially English, modes of thought and action, were we to meddle in an organization of such a kind, you would iind all your fixed habits and traditions inces- santly clashing, if not with the new aspirations themselves, at least with their modes of realization as suggested by us. You could not get unanimous consent to go even the length you might yourself. I have asked Mr. Sinnett to draft a plan embodying your joint ideas for submission to our chiefs, this seeming the shortest way to a mutual agreement. Under our ' guidance' your branch could not Hve, you not being men to be guided at all in that sense. Hence the society would be a premature birth and a failure, looking as incongruous as a Paris Daumont drawn by a team of Indian yaks or camels. You ask us to teach you true science — the occult aspect of the known side of Nature ; and this you think can be as easily done as asked. You do not seem to realize the tremendous diificulties in the way of imparting even the rudiments of our science to those who have been trained in the familiar methods of yours. You do not see that the more you have of the one the less capable you are of instinctively comprehending the other, for a man can only think in his worn grooves, and unless he has the courage to fill up these, and make new ones for himself, he must perforce travel on the old hues. Allow me a few in- stances. In conformity with exact science you would define but one cosmic energy, and see no dilference between the energy expended by the traveller who pushes aside the bush that obstructs his path, and the scientific experimenter who expends an equal amount of energy in setting a pendulum"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"£8 THE OCCULT WORLD. in motion. We do ; for we know there is a world of difference between the two. The one uselessly dissipates and scatters force, the other concentrates and stores it. And here please understand that I do not refer to the relative utility of the two, as one might imagine, but only to the fact that in the one case there is but brute force flung out without any transmutation of that brute energy into the higher potential form of spiritual dynamics, and in the other there is just that. Please do not consider me vaguely metaphysical. The idea I wish to convey is that the result of the highest intellection in the scientifically occupied brain is the evolution of a subHmated form of spiri- tual energy, which, in the cosmic action, is productive of illimitable results ; while the automatically acting brain holds, or stores up in itself, only a certain quantum of brute force that is unfruitful of benefit for the individual or. humanity. The human brain is an exhaustless generator of the most refined quality of cosmic force out of the low, brute energy of Nature ; and the complete adept has made himself a centre from which irradiate potentialities that beget correlations upon correlations through ^ons of time to come. This is the key to the mystery of his being able to project into and materialize in the visible world the forms that his imagination has constructed out of inert cosmic matter in the invisible world. The adept does not create anything new, but only utihzes and manipulates materials which Nature has in store around him, and material which, throughout eternities, has passed through all the forms. He has but to choose the one he wants, and recall it into objective existence. Would not this sound to one of your ' learned' biologists like a madman's dream % \" You say there are few branches of science with which you do not possess more or less acquaintance, and that you believe you are doing a certain amount of good, having acquired the position to do this by long years of study. Doubtless you do ; but will you permit me to sketch for you still more clearly the difference between the modes of physical (called exact often out of mere compliment) and metaphysical sciences. The latter, as you know, being incapable of verification before mixed audiences, is classed by Mr. Tyndall with the fictions of poetry. The realistic science of fact on the other hand is utterly prosaic. Now,"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"RECENT OCCULT PHENOMENA. 89 for us, poor unknown philanthropists, no fact of either of these sciences is interesting except in the degree of its potentiahty of moral results, and in the ratio of its useful- ness to mankind. And what, in its proud isolation, can be more utterly indifferent to every one and everything, or more bound to nothing but the selfish requisites for its advancement, than this materialistic science of fact ] May I ask then .... what have the laws of Faraday, Tyndall, or others to do with philanthropy in their abstract relations with humanity, viewed as an intelligent whole % What care they for Man as an isolated atom of this great and har- monious whole, even though they may sometimes be of practical use to him % Cosmic energy is something eternal and incessant ; matter is indestructible : and there stand the scientific facts. Doubt them, and you are an ignoramus ; deny them, a dangerous lunatic, a bigot ; pretend to improve upon the theories — an impertinent charlatan. And yet even these scientific facts never suggested any proof to the world of experimenters that Nature consciously prefers that matter should be indestructible under organic rather than inorganic forms, and that she works slowly but incessantly towards the realization of this object — the evolution of conscious life out of inert material. Hence, their ignorance about the scattering and concretion of cosmic energy in its metaphysical aspects, their division about Darwin's theories, their uncertainty about the degree of conscious life in separate elements, and, as a necessity, the scornful rejection of every phenomenon outside their own stated conditions, and the very idea of worlds of semi-intelligent if not intellectual forces at work in hidden corners of Nature. To give you another practical illustration — we see a vast difference between the two qualities of two equal amounts of energy expended by two men, of whom one, let us suppose, is on his way to his daily quiet work, and another on his way to denounce a fellow-creature at the police- station, while the men of science see none ; and we — not they — see a specific difference between the energy in the motion of the wind and that of a revolving wheel. And why % Because every thought of man upon being evolved passes into the inner world, and becomes an active entity by associating itself, coalescing we might term it, with an elemental — that is to say, with one of the semi-intelligent"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"90 THE OCCULT WORLD. forces of the kingdoms. It survives as an active intelligence — a creature of the mind's begetting — for a longer or shorter period proportionate with the original intensity of the cerebral action which generated it. Thus, a good thought is perpetuated as an active, beneficent power, an evil one as a maleficent demon. And so man is continually peopHng his current in space with a world of his own, crowded with the offsprings of his fancies, desires, impulses, and passions ; a current which re-acts upon any sensitive or nervous organization which comes in contact with it, in proportion to its dynamic intensity. The Buddhist calls this his * Shandba' ; the Hindu gives it the name of ' Karma.' The adept involves these shapes consciously ; other men throw them off unconsciously. The adept, to be successful and preserve his power, must dwell in sohtude, and more or less within his own soul. Still less does exact science perceive that while the building ant, the busy bee, the nidifacient bird, accumulates each in its own humble way as much cosmic energy in its potential form as a Haydn, a Plato, or a ploughman turning his furrow, in theirs; the hunter who kills game for his pleasure or profit, or the positivist who applies his intellect to proving that + x + = - , are wasting and scattering energy no less than the tiger which springs upon its prey. They all rob Nature instead of enriching her, and will all, in the degree of their intelligence, find themselves accountable. \" Exact experimental science has nothing to do with morality, virtue, philanthropy — therefore, can make no claim upon our help until it blends itself with metaphysics. Being but a cold classification of facts outside man, and existing before and after him, her domain of usefulness ceases for us at the outer boundary of these facts; and whatever the inferences and results for humanity from the materials acquired by her method, she little cares. There- fore, as our sphere lies entirely outside hers — as far as the path of Uranus is outside the Earth's — ^we distinctly refuse to be broken on any wheel of her construction. Heat is but a mode of motion to her, and motion developes heat, but why the mechanical motion of the revolving wheel should be metaphysically of a higher value than the heat into which it is gradually transformed she has yet to discover. The j)hilosopliical and transcendental (hence"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"RE CENT OCCULT PHENOMENA . 9 1 absurd) notion of the mediasval Theosophists that the final progress of human labour, aided by the incessant discoveries of man, must one day culminate in a process which, in imitation of the Sun's energy— in its capacity as a direct motor — shall result in the evolution of nutritious food out of inorganic matter, is unthinkable for men of science. Were the sun, the great nourishing father of our planetary system, to hatch granite chickens out of a boulder ' under test conditions' to-morrow, they (the men of science) would accept it as a scientific fact without wasting a regret that the fowls were not ahve so as to feed the hungry and the starving. But let a shaheron cross the Himalayas in a time of famine and multiply sacks of rice for the perishing multitudes — as he could — and your magistrates and collectors would probably lodge him in jail to make him confess what granary he had robbed. This is exact science and your real- istic world. And though, as you say, you are impressed by the vast extent of the world's ignorance on every subject, which you pertinently designate as a ' few palpable facts collected and roughly generahzed, and a technical jargon invented ta hide man's ignorance of all that hes behind these facts,' and though you speak of your faith in the infinite possibihties of Nature, yet you are content to spend your hfe in a work which aids only that same exact science. ... \" Of your several questions we will first discuss, if you please, the one relating to the presumed failure of the * Fraternity' to ' leave any mark upon the history of the world.'

To account for these results, men have, in difi'erent ages, invented theories of the interposition of gods,"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"92 THE OCCULT WORLD, special providences, fates, the benign or hostile influence of the stars. There never was a time within or before the so- called historical period when our predecessors were not moulding events and ' making history,' the facts of which were subsequently and invariably distorted by historians to suit contemporary prejudices. Are you quite sure that the visible heroic figures in the successive dramas were not often but their puppets % We never pretended to be able to draw nations in the mass to this or that crisis in spite of the general drift of the world's cosmic relations. The cycles must run their rounds. Periods of mental and moral light and darkness succeed each other as day does night. The major and minor }^igas must be accomphshed according to the established order of things. And we, borne along on the mighty tide, can only modify and direct some of its minor currents. If we had the powers of the imaginary Personal God, and the universal and immutable laws were but toys to play with, then, indeed, might we have created conditions that would have turned this earth into an arcadia for lofty souls. But having to deal with an immu- table law, being ourselves its creatures, we have had to do what we could, and rest thankful. There have been times when ' a considerable portion of enlightened minds' were taught in our schools. Such times there were in India, Persia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome. But, as I remarked in a letter to Mr. Sinnett, the adept is the efflorescence of his age, and comj)aratively few ever appear in a single century. Earth is the battle-ground of moral no less than of physical forces, and the boisterousness of animal passion, under the stimulus of the rude energies of the lower group of etheric agents, always tends to quench spirituality. What else could one expect of men so nearly related to the lower kingdom from which they evolved ? True also, our numbers are just now diminishing, but this is because, as I have said, we are of the human race, subject to its cyclic impulse, and powerless to turn that back upon itself. Can you turn the Gunga or the Bramaputra back to its sources ; can you even dam it so that its piled-up waters will not overflow the banks % No ; but you may draw the stream partly into canals, and utilize its hydraulic power for the good of man- kind. So we, who cannot stop the Avorld from going in its destined direction, are yet able to divert some part of its"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"RE CENT OCCULT PHENOMENA . 93 energy into useful channels. Think of us as demi-gocls, and my explanation will not satisfy you ; view us as simple men — perhaps a little wiser as the result of special study — and it ought to answer your objection. \" ' What good,' you say, ' is to be attained for my fellows and myself (the two are inseparable) by these occult sciences V When the natives see that an interest is taken by the English, and even by some high officials in India, in their ancestral science and philosophies, they will themselves take openly to their study. And when they come to realize that the old ' divine ' phenomena were not miracles, but scientific effects, superstition will abate. Thus, the greatest e\\41 that now oppresses and retards the revival of Indian civilization will in time disappear. The jDresent tendency of education is to make them materialistic and root out spiri- tuality. With a proper understanding of what their ancestors meant by their writings and teachings, education would be- come a blessing, whereas now it is often a curse. At present the non-educated, as much as the learned natives, regard the English as too prejudiced, because of their Christian religion and modern science, to care to understand them or their tra- ditions. They mutually hate and mistrust each other. This changed attitude towards the older philosophy, would influ- ence the native princes and wealthy men to endow normal schools for the education of pundits ; and old MSS., hitherto buried out of the reach of the Europeans, would again come to light, and with them the key to much of that which was hidden for ages from the popular understanding, for which your skeptical Sanscritists do not care, which your religious missionaries do not dare, to understand. Science would gain much, humanity everything. Under the stimulus of the Anglo-Indian Theosophical Society, we might in time see another golden age of Sanscrit literature \"If we look at Ceylon we shaU see the most scholarly priests combining, under the lead of the Theosophical Society, in a new exegesis of Buddhistic philosophy ; and at Galle, on the 15th of September, a secular Theoso23hical School for the teaching of Singhalese youth, opened with an attendance of over three hundred scholars ; an example about to be imitated at three other points in that island.

Education enthrones skepticism, but imprisons spirituahty. You can do immense good by helping to give the Western nations a secure basis upon which to reconstruct their crumbling faith. And what they need is the evidence that Asiatic psychology alone supplies. Give this, and you will confer hajDpiness of mind on thousands. The era of blind faith is gone ; that of inquiry is here. Inquiry that only unmasks error, without discovering anything upon which the soul can build, will but make iconoclasts. Iconoclasm, from its very destructiveness, can give nothing ; it can only raze. But man cannot rest satisfied with bare negation. Agnosticism is but a tem- porary halt. This is the moment to guide the recurrent impulse which must soon come, and which will jDush the age towards extreme atheism, or drag it back to extreme sacerdotalism, if it is not led to the primitive soul-satisfying philosophy of the Aryans. He who observes what is going on to-day, on the one hand among the Catholics, who are breeding miracles as fast as the white ants do their young, on the other among the free-thinkers, who are converting, by masses, into Agnostics — will see the drift of things. The age is revelling at a debauch of phenomena. The same marvels that the spiritualists quote in opposition to the dogmas of eternal perdition and atonement, the Catholics swarm to witness as proof of their faith in miracles. The skeptics make game of both. All are blind, and there is no one to lead them. You and your colleagues may help to fvirnish the materials for a needed universal religious philosophy ; one impregnable to scientific assault, because itself the finality of absolute science, and a religion that is indeed worthy of the name since it includes the relations of man physical to man psychical, and of the two to all that is above and below them.

But every bit of evidence which heljDS to exhibit the nature of the powers which the adepts exercise, is worth attention, while the rationale of such powers is still hidden from the world.

My friend to whom the last letter was addressed wi^ote a long reply, and subsequently an additional letter for Koot Hoomi, which he forwarded to me, asking me to read and then seal it up and send or give it to Madame Blavatsky for transmission, she being expected about that time at my house at AUahabad on her way down country from Amritsur and Lahore, where, as I have already indicated, she had stayed for some little time after our household broke up for the season at Simla. I did as desired, and gave the letter to Madame Blavatsky, after gumming and sealiug the stout envelope in which it was forwarded. That evening, a few hours afterwards, on returning home to dinner, I found that the letter had gone, and had come back again. Madame Blavatsky told me that she had been talking to a visitor in her own room, and had been fingering a blue pencil on her writing table without noticing what she was doing, when she suddenly noticed that the paper on which she was scribbling was my letter that the addressee had duly taken possession of, by his own methods, an hour or two before. She found that she had, while talking about something else, unconsciously ^vi^itten on the envelope the words which it then bore, \" Bead and returned with thanks, and a few commentaries. Please open.\" I examined the envelope carefully, and it was absolutely intact, its very"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"96 THE ecu LI WORLD. complete fastenings having remained just as I arranged them. Shtting it open, I found the letter which it had contained when I sent it, and another from Koot Hoomi to me, criticizing the former with the help of a succession of pencil figures that referred to particular passages in the original letter — another illustration of the passage of matter through matter, which, for thousands of people who have had personal experience of it in Spiritualism, is as certain a fact of Nature as the rising of the sun, and which I have now not only encountered at spiritual seances, but, as this record will have shown, on many occasions w^hen there is no motive for suspecting any other agency than that of Hving beings with faculties of which we may all possess the unde- veloped germs, though it is only in their case that knowledge has brought these to phenomenal fruition. Sceptical critics, putting aside the collateral bearing of all the previous phenomena I have described, and dealing with this letter incident by itself alone, will perhaps say — Of course, Madame Blavatsky had ample time to open the envelope by such means as the mediums who profess to get answers to sealed letters from the spirit world are in the habit of employing. But, firstly, the Jhelum telegram proof, and the inherent evidence of the whole correspon- dence show that, the letters which come to me in that which I recognize as Koot Hoomi's handwriting, are not the work of Madame Blavatsky, at all events ; secondly, let the incident I have just described be compared with another illustration of an exactly similar incident which occurred shortly afterwards under different circumstances. Koot Hoomi had sent me a letter addressed to my friend to read and forward on. On the subject of this letter before send- ing it I had occasion to make a communication to Koot Hoomi. I wrote a note to him, fastened it up in an ordi- nary adhesive envelope, and gave it to Madame Blavatsky. She put it in her pocket, went into her own room, which opened out of the drawing-room, and came out again almost instantly. Certainly she had not been away thirty seconds. She said, \" he\" had taken it at once. Then she followed me back through the house to my office-room, spoke for a few minutes in the adjoining room to my wife, and, returning into my oflice, lay down on a couch. I went on with my work, and perhaps ten minutes elapsed, perhaps less. Sud- denly she got up. \" There's your letter,\" she said, pointing"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"RE CENT OCCULT PHENOMENA . 97 to the pillow from which she had hfted her head; and there lay the letter I had just written, intact as regards its apj)earance, but with Koot Hoomi's name on the outside scored out and mine written over it. After a thorough examination I slit the envelope, and found inside, on the fly-leaf of my note, the answer I required in Koot Hoomi's handwriting. Now, except for the thirty seconds during which she retired to her own room, Madame Blavatsky had not been out of my sight, except for a minute or two in my wife's room, during the short interval which elapsed between the delivery of the letter by me to her and its return to me as described. And during this interval no one else had come into my room. The incident was as absolute and complete a mechanical proof of abnormal power exercised to produce the result as any conceivable test could have yielded. Excej)t by declaring that I cannot be describing it correctly, the most resolute partisan of the commonplace will be unable seriously to dispute the force of this incident. He may take refuge in idiotic ridicule, or he may declare that I am misrepresenting the facts. As regards the latter hypothesis I can only pledge my word, as I do hereby, to the exact accuracy of the statement. In one or two cases I have got back answers from Koot Hoomi to my letters in my own envelopes, these remaining intact as addressed to him, but with the address changed, and my letter gone from the inside, his reply having taken its place. In two or three cases I have found short mes- sages from Koot Hoomi written across the blank j^arts of letters from other persons, coming to me through the post, the writers in these cases being assuredly unaware of the additions so made to their epistles. Of course, I have asked Koot Hoomi for. an explanation of these little phenomena, but it is easier for me to ask than for him to answer, partly because the forces which the adepts bring to bear upon matter to achieve abnormal results, are of a kind which ordinary science knows so little about that we of the outer world are not jDrepared for such explanations ; and partly because the manipulation of the forces employed has to do, sometimes, with secrets of initiation which an occultist must not reveal. However, in reference to the sul^ject before us, I received on one occasion this hint as an explanation. H"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"98 THE OCCULT WORLD. \" . . . . Besides, bear in mind that these my letters are not written, but impressed, or precipitated, and then all mistakes corrected.\" Of course, I wanted to know more about such precipita- tion ; was it a process wdiich followed thought more rapidly than any with which we were familiar % And as regards letters received, did the meaning of these penetrate the understanding of an occult recipient at once, or were they read in the ordinary way % \" Of course I have to read every word you write,\" Koot Hoomi replied, \" otherwise I would make a fine mess of it. And whether it be through my physical or spiritual eyes, the time required for it is practically the same. As much may be said of my replies ; for whether I precipitate or dictate them or write my answers myself, the difference in time saved is very minute. I have to think it over, to photograph every word and sentence carefully in my brain, before it can be repeated by precipitation. As the fixing on chemically prepared surfaces of the images formed by the camera requires a previous arrangement within the focus of the object to be represented, for otherwise — as often found in bad photographs— the legs of the sitter might appear out of all proportion wdth the head, and so on — so we have to first arrange our sentences and impress every letter to appear on paper in our minds before it becomes fit to be read. For the present it is all I can tell you. When science will have learned more about the mystery of the lithophyl (or litho- biblion), and how the impress of leaves comes originally to take place on stones, then I will be able to make you better understand the process. But you must know and remember one thing — we but follow and servilely copy Nature in her works.\" In another letter Koot Hoomi expatiates more fully on the difiiculty of making occult explanations intelligible to minds trained only in modern science. \" Only the progress one makes in the study of arcane knowledge from its rudimental elements brings him gradually to understand our meaning.

I feel even irritated at having to use these three clumsy words — Past, Present, and Future. Miserable concepts of the objective phases of the subjective whole, they are about as ill adapted for the purpose as an axe for fine carving. Oh, my poor disappointed friend, that you were already so far advanced on the Path that this simple transmission of ideas should not be encumbered by the conditions of matter, the union of your mind with ours prevented by its induced incapabilities. Such is unfortu- nately the inherited and self-acquired grossness of the Western mind, and so greatly have the very phrases expressive of modern thoughts been developed in the line of practical materialism, that it is now next to impossible, either for them to comprehend or for us to express in their own languages anything of that delicate, seemingly ideal, machinery of the occult kosmos. To some little extent that faculty can be acquired by the Europeans through study and meditation, but — that's all. And here is the bar which has hitherto prevented a conviction of the theosophical truths from gaining currency among Western nations — caused theosophical study to be cast aside as useless and fan- tastic by AVestern philosophers. How shall I teach you to read and write, or even comprehend a language of which no alphabet palpable or w^ords audible to you have yet been invented. How could the jDhenomena of our modern elec- trical science be explained to — say a Greek philosopher of the days of Ptolemy, were he suddenly recalled to life — with such an unbridged hiatus in discovery as would exist between his and our age ? Would not the very technical terms be to him an unintelligible jargon, an abracadabra of meaningless sounds, and the very instruments and appara- tuses used but miraculous monstrosities ?

What would you have to reply? Would you not be likely enough to retort by telling me that as there never were but seven (now three) primary colours which, moreover, have never yet by any known physical process been seen decomposed further than the seven prismatic hues, my invitation was as unscientific as it was absurd ? Adding that my offer to search for an ima- ginary solar complement, being no compliment to your knowledge of physical science- — I had better, j)erhaps, go and search for my mythical dichromatic and solar ' pairs' in Thibet, for modern science has hitherto been unable to bring under any theory even so simple a phenomenon as the colours of all such dichromatic bodies.

Yet it is not as an addition to the tangled mass of theory or speculation that they are being given to you, but for their practical bearing on the interests of mankind. The terms Unscientific, Impossible, Hallucination, Imposture, have hitherto been used in a very loose, careless way, as implying in the occult phenomena something either mysterious and abnormal, or a premeditated imposture. And this is why our chiefs have determined to shed upon a few recipient minds more light upon the subject, and to prove to them that such manifestations are as reducible to law as the simplest phenomena in the physical universe. The wise- acres say, ' the age of miracles is past ;' but we answer, ' it never existed.' While not unparalleled or without their counterpart in universal history, these phenomena must and loill come with an overpowering influence upon the world of skeptics and bigots.

And it is the duty of every man who is capable of an unselfish impulse to do something, however little, for its welfare. It reminds me of the old fable of the war between the body and its members; here, too, each limb of this huge ' orphan,' fatherless and motherless, selfishly cares but for itself. The body, uncared for, suffers eternally whether the limbs are at war or at rest. Its suffering and agony never cease ; and who can blame it — as your materialistic philosophers do — if, in this everlasting isolation and neglect, it has evolved gods unto w^hom ' it ever cries for help, but is not heard.' Thus — * Since there is hope for man only in man, I would not let one cry whom I could save.' Yet I confess that I indi\\^dually am not yet exempt from some of the terrestrial attachments.

As affirmed more than once already, Occult Philosophy in various countries and through different periods has remained substantially the same. At different times and places very different mjiihological efflorescences have been thrown off for the service of the populace ; but, underlying each popu- lar rehgion, the religious knowledge of the initiated minority has been identical. Of course, the modern Western con- ception of what is right in such matters will be outraged by the mere idea of a rehgion which is kept as the property of the few, while a \"false rehgion,\" as modern phraseology would put it, is served out to the common people. How^- ever, before this feeHng is permitted to land us in too un- compromising disapproval of the ancient liiders of the truth, it may be well to determine how far it is due to any intelli- gent conviction that the common herd would be benefited by teaching, which must be in its nature too refined and subtle for pojDular comprehension, and how far the feeling referred to, may be due to an acquu-ed habit of looking on religion as something which it is important to j)rofess, irre- spective of understanding it. No doubt, assuming that a man's eternal welfare depends upon his declaration, irre- spective of comprehension, of the right faith, among all the faiths he might have picked out from the lucky bag of biith and destiny — then it would be the sovereign duty of persons conscious of possessing such a faith to proclaim it from the house-tops. But, on the other hypothesis, that it cannot profit any man to mutter a formula of woi'ds without attach- ing sense to it, and that crude intelligences can only be ap- proached by crude sketches of religious ideas, there is more to be advanced on behalf of the ancient policy of reserve than seems at first sight obvious. Certainly the relations of the populace and the initiates, look susceptible of modi- fication in the European world of the present day. The"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"io6 THE OCCULT WORLD. popuLice, in the sense of the public at large, including the finest intellects of the age, are at least as well able as those of any special class to comprehend metaphysical ideas. These finer intellects dominate public thought, so that no great ideas can triumph among the nations of Europe with- out their aid, while their aid can only be secured in the open market of intellectual competition. Thus it ensues that the bare notion of an esoteric science superior to that offered in public to the scientific world, strikes the modern Western mind as an absurdity. With which very natural feeling it is only necessary at present here to fight, so far as to ask people not to be illogical in its aj^plication ; that is to say, not to assume that because it would never occur to a modern European coming into 230ssession of a new truth to make a secret of it, and disclose it only to a fraternity under pledges of reserve, therefore such an idea could never have occurred to an Egyptian priest or an intellectual giant of the civilization which overspread India, according to some not unreasonable hypotheses, before Egypt began to be a seat of learning and art. The secret society system was as natural, indeed, to the ancient man of science, as the public system is in our own country and time. Nor is the difference one of time and fashion merely. It hinges on to the great difference that is to be discerned in the essence of the pur- suits in which learned men engage now, as compared with those they w^ere concerned with in former ages. We have belonged to the material progress epoch, and the watchword of material progress has always been pubhcity. The ini- tiates of ancient psychology belonged to the spiritual age, and the watchword of subjective development has always been secrecy. Whether in both cases the watchword is dictated by necessities of the situation is a question on which discus- sion might be possible ; but, at all events, these reflections are enough to show that it would be unwise to dogmatize too confidently on the character of the philosophy and the philosophers who could be content to hoard their wisdom and supply the crowd with a religion adapted rather to the understanding of its recipients than to the eternal verities. It is impossible now to form a conjecture as to the date or time at which occult philosophy began to take the shape in which we find it now.

Indeed the question cannot be raised without bringing us in contact witli considerations that hint at absolutely start- ling conclusions in this respect. But, apart from specific archaeological speculations, it has been pointed out that \" a philosophy so profound, a moral code so ennobling, and practical results so conclusive and so uniformly demonstrable, are not the gro\\\\i;h of a generation,, or even a single epoch. Fact must have been piled upon fact, deduction upon deduction, science have begotten science, and myriads of the brightest human intellects have reflected upon the laws of Nature, before this ancient doc- trine had taken concrete shape. The j^roofs of this identity of fundamental doctrine in the old religions are found in the prevalence of a system of initiation ; in the secret sacer- dotal castes, who had the guardianship of mystical words of power, and a pubhc display of a phenomenal control over natural forces indicating association mth preter-human beings. Every approach to the mysteries of all these nations, was guarded with the same jealous care, and in all the penalty of death was inflicted ujdou all initiates of any degree who divulged the secrets entrusted to them.\" The book just quoted shows this to have been the case with the Eleusinian and Bacchic Mysteries among the Chaldean Magi and the Egyptian Hierophants. The Hindu book of Brahminical ceremonies, the \" Agrushada Parikshai,\" con- tains the same law, which appears also to have been adopted by the Essenes, the Gnostics, and the Theurgic Neo-Plato- nists. Freemasonry has copied the old formula, though its raison cVetre has expired here with the expiration from among freemasons of the occult philosophy on which their forms and ceremonies are shaped to a larger extent than they generally conceive.

I believe qualified to speak with authority as to the fact, ^' that not only is their memory still preserved in India, but also that the Secret Association is still alive, and as active as ever.\" As I have now, in support of the views just expressed, to make some quotations from Madame Blavatsky's great book, \" Isis Unveiled,\" it is necessary to give certain explanations concerning the genesis of that w^ork, for which the reader who has followed my narrative of occult experi- ences through the preceding pages, will be better prepared than he would have been previously. I have shown how, throughout the most ordinary incidents of her daily life, Madame Blavatsky is constantly in communication, by means of the system of psychological telegraphy that the initiates employ, with her superior \"Brothers\" in occultism. This state of the facts once realized, it mil be easy to understand that in compiling such a work as \" Isis,\" which embodies a complete explanation of all that can be told about occultism to the outer world, she would not be left exclusively to her own resources. The truth which Madame Blavatsky would be the last person in the world to wish disguised, is that the assistance she derived from the Brothers, by occult agency, throughout the composition of her book, was so abundant and continuous that she is not so much the author of \" Isis\" as one of a group of collahora- teurs, by whom it was actually produced. I am given to understand that she set to work on \" Isis\" without knowing an3rthing about the magnitude of the task she was undertaking. She began writing to dictation — the passages thus written not now standing first in the com- pleted volumes — in compliance with the desire of her occult friends, and without knomng wdiether the composition on which she was engaged would turn out an article for a newspaper, or an essay for a magazine, or a work of larger dimensions. But on and on it grew. Before going very far, of course, she came to understand what she was about ; and fairly launched on her task, she in turn contributed a good deal from her own natural brain. But the Brothers appear always to have been at work with her, not merely dictatinc: throusj-li her brain as at first, but sometimes employing those methods of \" precipitation\" of which I have myself been favoured with some examples, and by means of"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"TEA CHINGS OF OCCULT PHIL OS PHY. 1 09 which quantities of actual manuscript in other handwritings than her own were produced while she slept. In the morning she would sometimes get up and find as much as thii'ty slips added to the manuscript she had left on her table over-night. The book \" Isis\" is in fact as great a \" phenomenon\" — apart from the nature of its contents — as any of those I have described. The faults of the book, obvious to the general reader, will be thus explained, as well as the extraordinary vakie it possesses for those who may be anxious to explore as far as possible the mysteries of occultism. The deific j^owers which the Brothers enjoy cannot protect a literary work which is the joint production of several — even among their — minds, from the confusion of arrangement to which such a mode of composition inevitably gives rise. And besides confusion of arrangement, the book exhibits a heterogeneous variety of different styles, which mars it dignity as a literary work, and must prove both irritating and puzzling to the ordinary reader. But for those who possess the key to this irregularity of form, it is an advantage rather than other- wise. It will enable an acute reader to account for some minor incongruities of statement occurring in different j^arts of the book. Beyond this it will enable him to recognize the voice, as it were, of the different authors as they take up the parable in turn. The book was written — as regards its physical production — at New York, where Madame Blavatsky was utterly un- provided with books of reference. It teems, however, with references to books of all sorts, including many of a very unusual character, and with quotations the exactitude of which may easily be verified at the great European libraries, as foot-notes supply the number of the pages, from which the passages taken are quoted. I may now go on to collect some passages from \" Isis,\" the object of which is to show the unity of the esoteric j^liilo- sophy underlying various ancient religions, and the peculiar value which attaches for students of that philosophy, to pure Buddhism, a system which, of all those presented to the world, appears to supply us with occult philosoj)hy in its least adulterated shape. Of course, the reader will guard himself from running away -with the idea that Buddhism, as explained by writers who are not occultists,"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"THE OCCULT WORLD. can be accepted as an embodiment of their views. For example, one of the leading ideas of Buddhism, as inter- preted by Western scholars, is that \" Nirvana\" amounts to annihilation. It is possible that Western scholars may be right in saying that the explanation of \" Nirvana\" supplied by exoteric Buddhism leads to this conclusion ; but that, at all events, is not the occult doctrine. \" Nirvana,\" it is stated in \" Isis,\" \" means the certitude of personal immortality in sinrit not in soul, which, as a finite emanation, must certainly disintegrate its particles, a com- pound of human sensations, passions, and yearning for some objective kind of existence, before the immortal spirit of the Ego is quite freed, and henceforth secure against trans- migration in any form. And how can man reach that state so long as the ' Upadana,' that state of longing for life, more life, does not disappear from the sentient being, from the Ahancara clothed, however, in a sublimated body ? It is the ' Upadana' or the intense desire that produces will, and it is will which develops force, and the latter generates matter, or an object having form. Thus the disembodied Ego, through this sole undying desire in him, unconsciously furnishes the conditions of his successive self-procreations in various forms, which depend on his mental state, and ^ Karma,' the good or bad deeds of his preceding existence, commonly called ' merit' and ' demerit.' \" There is a world of suggestive metaphysical thought in this passage, which will serve at once to justify the view propounded just now as regards the reach of Buddhistic philosophy as viewed from, the occult standpoint. The misunderstanding about the meaning of \" Nirvana\" is so general in the West, that it will be well to consider the following elucidation also : — \"Annihilation means with the Buddhistical philosophy only a dispersion of matter, in whatever form or semblance of form it may be ; for everything that bears a shape was created, and thus must sooner or later perish — i.e., change that shape ; therefore, as something temporary, though seeming to be permanent, it is but an illusion, ' Maya' ; for as eternity has neither beginning nor end, the more or less prolonged duration of some particular form passes, as it were, like an instantaneous fiash of lightning.

The latter changes, says the Buddhist, according to the merits or demerits of the person during his lifetime, and this is metempsychosis. When the sjDiritual entity breaks loose for ever from every particle of matter, then only it enters upon the eternal and unchangeable * Nirvana.' He exists in spirit, in nothing ; as a form, a shape, a semblance, he is completely annihilated, and thus will die no more ; for spirit alone is no ' Maya,' but the only reaUty in an illusionary universe of ever-passing forms To accuse Buddhistical philosophy of rejecting a Supreme Being — God, and the soul's immortality — of Atheism, in short — on the ground that ' Nirvana' means annihilation, and ' Svabhavat' is not a person, but nothing, is simply absurd. The En (or Aym) of the Jewish Ensoph also means nihil, or nothing, that which is not i^quoad nos), but no one has ever ventured to twit the Jews with atheism. In both cases the real meaning of the term nothing carries with it the idea that God is not a thing, not a concrete or visible being to which a name expressive of any object known to us on earth may be applied with propriety.\" Again: \"' Nirvana' is the world of cause in which all deceptive effects or illusions of our senses disappear. * Nirvana' is the highest attainable sphere.\" The secret doctrines of the Magi, of the pre-Vedic Buddhists, of the hierophants of the Egyptian Thotli or Hermes, were — we find it laid down in \" Isis\" — identical from the beginning, an identity that applies equally to the secret doctrines of the adepts of whatever age or nationality, including the Chaldean Kabalists and the Jewish Nazars. \" When we use the word Buddhists, we do not mean to imply by it either the exoteric Buddhism instituted by the followers of Gautama Buddha, or the modern Buddhistic religion, but the secret philosophy of Sakyamuni, which, in its essence, is certainly identical with the ancient wisdom- religion of the sanctuary — the pre-Vedic Brahmanism. The schism of Zoroaster, as it is called, is a direct proof of it : for it was no schism, strictly speaking, but merely a partially public exposition of strictly monotheistic religious truths hitherto taught only in the sanctuaries, and that he had learned from the Brahmans. Zoroaster, the primeval"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"THE OCCULT WORLD. institutor of sun-worship, cannot l3e called the founder of the dualistic system, neither was he the first to teach the unity of God, for he taught but what he had learned him- self from the Brahmans. And that Zarathrusta, and his follow-ers the Zoroastrians, had been settled in India before they immigrated into Persia, is also j^roved by Max M tiller. 'That the Zoroastrians and their ancestors started from India,' he says, ' during the Vaidic period, can be proved as distinctly as that the inhabitants of Massilia started from Greece Many of the gods of the Zoroastrians come out .... as mere reflections and deflections of the gods of the Yeda.' \" If, now, we can prove, and we can do so on the evidence of the ' Kabala,' and the oldest traditions of the wisdom- religion, the philosophy of the old sanctuaries, that all these gods, whether of the Zoroastrians or of the Veda, are but so many personated occult powers of Nature, the faithful servants of the adepts of secret wisdom — magic — we are on secure ground. \" Thus, whether we say that Kabalism and Gnosticism proceeded from Masdeanism or Zoroastrianism, it is all the same, unless we meant the exoteric worship, which we do not. Likewise, and in this sense we may echo King, the author of the ' Gnostics,' and several other archj^ologists, and maintain that both the former proceeded from Buddhism at once the simplest and most satisfying of philosophies, and which resulted in one of the purest religions in the world. . But whether among the Essenes or the Neo-Platonists or again among the innumerable struggling sects born but to die, the same doctrines, identical in substance and sjDirit, if not always in form, are encountered. By Buddhism, therefore, we mean that religion signifying literally the doc- trine of wisdom, and which by many ages antedates the metaphysical philosophy of Siddhartha Sakyamuni.\" Modern Christianity has, of course, diverged widely from its own original philosojDhy, but the identity of this with the oi-iginal philosophy of all religions is maintained in \" Isis\" in the course of an interesting argument. \" Luke, who was a physician, is designated in the Syriac texts as Asaia, the Essaian or Essene. Josephus and Philo Juda^us have sufliciently described this sect to leave no doubt in our mind that the Nazarene Reformer, after"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"TEA CHINGS OF OCCUL T PHIL OSOPHY. 1 13 ha\\dng received his education in their dweUings in the desert, and being duly initiated in the mysteries, preferred the free and independent hfe of a wandering Nazaria, and so separated, or inazarenized, himself from them, thus be- coming a travelling Therapeute, or Nazaria, a healer. ... In his discourses and sermons Jesus always spoke in parables, and used metaphors with his audience. This habit was again that of the Essenians and the Nazarenes; the Galileans, who dwelt in cities and villages, were never known to use such allegorical language. Indeed, some of his disciples, being Galileans as well as himself, felt even surprised to find him using with the people such a form of expression. ^ Why speakest thou unto them in parables V they often inquired. ' Because it is given itnto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of Heaven ; but to them it is not given,' was the reply, which was that of an initiate. 'Therefore, I speak unto them in parables, because they seeing, see not, and hearing, they hear not, neither do they understand.' Moreover, we find Jesus- expressing his thoughts .... in sentences which are purely Pythagorean, when, during the Sermon on the Mount, he says, ' Give ye not that which is sacred to the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine ; for the swine will tread them under their feet, and the dogs will turn and rend you.' Professor A. Wilder, the editor of Taylor's ' Eleusinian Mysteries,' observes ' a like disposition on the part of Jesus and Paul to classify their doctrines as esoteric and exoteric — the mysteries of the Kingdom of God for the apostles, and parables for the multitude. * We speak wisdom,' says Paul, ' among them that are perfect,^ or ' initiated.' In the Eleusinian and other mysteries the participants were always divided into two classes, the neophytes and the j^&'Kf^ct The narrative of the Apostle Paul, in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, has struck several scholars well versed in the descriptions of the mystical rites of the initiation given by some cLissics as alluding most undoubtedly to the final Epopteia : ' I know a certain man — whether in body or outside of Ijody I know not ; God knoweth — who was rapt into Paradise, and heard things ineffable which it is not lawful for a man to repeat.' These words have rarely, so far as we know, been regarded by commentators as an allusion to the beatific visions of an initiated seer ; but the phraseology is unequi- I"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"114 THE OCCULT WORLD. vocal. These things which it is not lawful to repeat, are hinted at in the same w^ords, and the reason assigned for it is the same as that which we find repeatedly expressed by- Plato, Proclus, Jamblichus, Herodotus, and other classics. * We speak wisdom only among them that are perfect,' says Paul ; the plain and undeniable translation of the sentence being : ' We speak of the prof ounder or final esoteric doc- trines of the mysteries (which are denominated wisdom), only among them wdio are initiated.' So in relation to the man who was rapt into Paradise — and who was evidently Paul himself — the Christian word Paradise having replaced that of Elysium.\" The final purpose of occult philosophy is to show what Man was, is, and will be. \" That which survives as an individuality,\" says \" Isis,\" \" after the death of the body is the actual soul, which Plato, in the Timceus and Gorgias^ calls the mortal soul ; for, according to the Hermetic doctrine, it throws off\" the more material particles at every progressive change into a higher sphere The astral spirit is a faithful duplicate of the body in a physical and spiritual sense. The Divine, the highest immortal spirit, can be neither punished nor rewarded. To maintain such a doctrine would be at the same time absurd and blasphemous ; for it is not merely a flame lit at the central and unextinguishable fountain of light, but actually a portion of it and of identical essence. It assures immortahty to the individual astral being in proportion to the willingness of the latter to receive it. So long as the double man — i.e., the man of flesh and spirit — keeps within the limits of the law of spiritual continuity ; so long as the divine spark lingers in him, how- ever faintly, he is on the road to an immortality in the future state. But those who resign themselves to a materialistic existence, shutting out the divine radiance shed by their spirit, at the beginning of their earthly pilgrimage, and stifling the warning voice of that faithful sentry the conscience, which serves as a focus for the light in the soul — vsuch beings as these, having left behind conscience and spirit, and crossed the boundaries of matter, will, of necessity, have to follow its laws.\" Again : \" The secret doctrine teaches that man, if he wins immortality, will remain for ever the trinity that he is in life, and will continue so throughout all the spheres. The"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"TEACHINGS OF OCCULT PHILOSOPHY. 115 astral body, which in this hfe is covered by a gross physical envelope, becomes, when relieved of that covering by the process of corporeal death, in its turn the shell of another iind more ethereal body. This begins developing from the moment of death, and becomes perfected when the astral body of the earthly form finally separates from it.\" The passages quoted, when read by the light of the expla- nations I have given, will enable the reader, if so inclined, to take up \" Isis\" in a comprehending spirit, and find his way to the rich veins of precious metal which are buried in its pages. But neither in \" Isis\" nor in any other book on occult philosophy which has been or seems likely to be written 3'et awhile, must any one hope to obtain a cut-and- dried, straightforward, and perfectly clear account of the mysteries of birth, death, and the future. At first, in pursuing studies of this kind, one is irritated at the difiiculty of getting at what the occultists really believe as regards the future state, the nature of the life to come, and its general ^mise en scene. The well-known rehgions have very precise views on these subjects, further rendered practical by the assurance some of them give that qualified persons, commissioned by churches to perform the duty, can shunt departing souls on to the right or the wrong lines, in accordance with consideration received. Theories of that kind have at any rate the merit of simphcity and intelli- gibility, but they are not, perhaps, satisfactory to the mind as regards their details. After a very little investigation of the matter, the student of occult philosophy will realize that on that path of knowledge he will certainly meet with no conceptions likely to outrage his purest idealization of God and the life to come. He will soon feel that the scheme of ideas he is exploring is lofty and dignified to the utmost limits that the human understanding can reach. But it will remain vague, and he will seek for explicit statements on this or that point, until by degrees he realizes that the absolute truth about the origin and destinies of the human soul may be too subtle and intricate to be possibly expressible in straightforward language. Perfectly clear ideas may be attainable for the purified minds of advanced scholars in occultism, who, by entire devotion of every faculty to the pursuit and prolonged assimilation of such ideas, come at length to understand them with the aid of peculiar intel- I 2"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Ii6 THE OCCULT WORLD. lectual powers specially expanded for the purpose ; but it does not at all follow that with the best will in the world such persons must necessarily be able to draw up an occult creed which should bring the whole theory of the universe into the compass of a dozen lines. The study of occultism, even by men of the world, engaged in ordinary pursuits as well, may readily enlarge and purify the understanding, to the extent of arming the mind, so to speak, with tests that wall detect absurdity in any erroneous religious hypothesis ; but the absolute structure of occult belief is something which, from its nature, can only be built up slowly in the mind of each intellectual architect. And I imagine that a very Advid perception of this on their part explains the reluctance of occultists even to attempt the straightforward explanation of their doctrines. They know that really vital plants of knowledge, so to speak, must grow up from the germ in each man's mind, and cannot be transplanted into the strange soil of an untrained understanding in a complete state of mature growi:h. They are ready enough to supply seed, but every man must grow his own tree of knowledge for himself. As the adept himself is not made, but becomes so, — in a minor degree, the person who merely aspires to comprehend the adept and his views of things must develop such comj)re- hension for himself, by thinking out rudimentary ideas ta their legitimate conclusions. These considerations fit in with, and do something to- wards elucidating, the reserve of occultism, and they further suggest an explanation of what will at once seem puzzling to a reader of \" Isis,\" who takes it up by the hght of the present narrative. If great parts of the book, as I have asserted, are really the work of actual adepts, w^ho know of their own knowledge what is the actual truth about many of the mysteries discussed, why have they not said pln.inly what they meant, instead of beating about the bush, and suggesting arguments derived from this or that ordinary source, from literary or historical evidence, from abstract speculation concerning the harmonies of Nature % The answer seems to be, firstly, that they could not well wi-ite, \" We know that so and so is the fact,\" without being asked, \"How do you know]\" — and it is manifestly impossible that they could reply to this question without going into details, that it would be \" unlawful,\" as a Biblical writer would say,"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"TEA CHINGS OF OCCUL T PHIL OSOPHY. 1 1 7 to disclose, or without proposing to guarantee their testi- mony by manifestations of powers which it would be obviously impracticable for them to keep always at hand for the satisfaction of each reader of the book in turn. Secondly, I imagine that, in accordance with the invariable principle of trying less to teach than to encourage spontaneous development, they have aimed in \" Isis,\" rather at producing an effect on the reader's mind, than at shooting in a store of previously accumulated facts. They have shown that Theosophy, or Occult Philosophy, is no new candidate for the world's attention, but is really a restatement of principles which have been recognized from the very infancy of mankind. The historic sequence which establishes this view is distinctly traced through the successive evolutions of the philosophical schools, in a manner which it is impossible for me to attempt in a work of these dimensions, and the theory laid down is illustrated with abundant accounts of the experimental demonstrations of occult power ascribed to various thaumaturgists. The authors of \" Isis\" have ex- pressly refrained from saying more than might conceivably \"be said by a writer who was not an adept, supposing him to have access to all the literature of the subject and an enlightened comprehension of its meaning. But once realize the real position of the authors or inspirers of \" Isis,\" and the value of any argument on which you find them launched is enhanced enormously above the level of the relatively commonplace considerations advanced on its behalf. The adepts may not choose to bring forward other than exoteric evidence in favour of any particular thesis they wish to support, but if they wish to support it, that fact alone will be of enormous significance for any reader who, in indirect ways, has reached a \"Comprehension of the authority with which they are .entitled to speak."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Ii8 THE OCCULT WORLD. CONCLUSION. I CANNOT let a second edition of this book appear without recoi'ding some, at least, of the experiences which have befallen me since its preparation. The most important of these, indeed, are concerned with fragmentary instruction I have been privileged to receive from the Brothers in reference to the great truths of cosmology which their spiritual insight has enabled them to penetrate. But the exposition even of the little, relatively, that I have learned on this head would exact a more elaborate treatise than I can attempt at present. And the purpose of the present volume is to expound the outer facts of the situation rather than to analyze a system of philosophy. This is not entirely inaccessible to exoteric students, apart from what may be regarded as direct revelation from the Brothers. Though almost all existing occult literature is unattractive in its form, and rendered purposely obscure by the use of an elaborate symbology, it does contain a great deal of information that can be distilled from the mass by the application of sufficient patience. Some industrious students of that literature have proved this. Whether the masters of occult philosophy will ultimately consent to the complete exposition in plain language of the state of the facts regarding the spiritual constitution of Man remains to be seen. Certainly, even if they are still reticent in a way that no ordinary observer can compre- hend, they are more disposed to be communicative at this moment than they have been for a long time past. But the first thing to do is to dissipate as much as possible the dogged disbeUef that encrusts the Western mind as to the existence of any abnormal persons who can be regarded as masters of True Philosophy — distinguished from all the speculations that have tormented the world —"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION. 119 and as to the abnormal nature of their faculties. I have endeavoured already to point out plainly, but may as well here emphasize the reason why I dwell upon, the pheno- mena which exhibit these faculties. Rightly regarded these are the credentials of the spiritual teaching which their authors supply. Firstly, indeed, in themselves abnormal phenomena accomplished by the will-j^ower of living men must be intensely interesting for every one endowed with an honest love of science. They open out new scientific horizons. It is as certain as the sun's next rising that the forward pressure of scientilic discovery, advancing slowly as it does in its own grooves, will ultimately, and probably at no very distant date, introduce the ordinary world to some of the superior scientific know- ledge already enjoyed by the masters of occultism. Faculties will be acquired by exoteric investigation, that will bring the outworks of science a step or two nearer the comprehension of some of the phenomena I have described in the present volume. And meanwhile it seems to me very interesting to get a glimpse beforehand of achieve- ments which we should probably find engaging the eager attention of a future generation, if we really could, as Tennyson suggests — \" sleep through terms of mighty wars, And wake on science grown to more, On secrets of the brain, the stars, As wild as aught of fairy lore.\" But even superior to their scientific interest is the import- ance of the lesson conveyed by occult phenomena, when these distinctly place their authors in a commanding position of intellectual superiority as compared with the world at large. They show most undeniably that these men have gone far ahead of their contemporaries in a comprehension of Nature as exemplified in this world, that they have acquired the power of cognizing events by other means than the material senses, that while their bodies are at one place their perceptions may be at another, and that they have consequently solved the great problem as to whether the Ego of man is a something distinct from his perishable frame. From all other teachers we can but find out what has been thought probable in reference to the"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"I20 THE OCCULT WORLD. soul or spirit of man : from them we can find out what is the fact ; and if that is not a subhme subject of inquiry, surely it would be difficult to say what is. But we cannot read poetry till we have learned the alphabet ; and if the combinations b-a ba, and so on are found to be insufferably trivial and uninteresting, the fastidious person who objects to such foolishness wdll certainly never be able to read the \" Idylls of the King.\" So I return from the clouds to my patient record of phenomena, and to the incidents which have confirmed the experiences and conclusions set forth in the previous chapters of this book, since my return to India. The very first incident which took place was in the nature of a pleasant greeting from my fiiend Koot Hoomi. I had written to him (per Madame Blavatsky, of course) shortly before leaving London, and had expected to find a letter from him awaiting my arrival at Bombay. But no such letter had been received, as I found when I reached the headquarters of the Theosophical Society, where I had arranged to stay for a few days before going on to my destination up country. I got in late at night, and nothing remarkable happened then. The following morning, after breakfast, I was sitting talking with Madame Blavatsky in the room that had been allotted to me. We were sitting at different sides of a large square table in the middle of the room, and the full dayhght was shining. There was no one else in the room. Suddenly, down upon the table before me, but to my right hand, Madame Blavatsky being to my left, there fell a thick letter. It fell \" out of nothing,\" so to speak ; it was materialized, or reintegrated in the air before my eyes. It w^as Koot Hoomi's expected reply — a deeply interesting letter, partly concerned with private mattei'S and replies to questions of mine, and partly with some large, though as yet shadowy, revelations of occult philosophy, the first sketch of this that I had received. Now, of course, I know wdiat some readers mil say to this (with a self-satisfied smile) — \"wires, springs, concealed apparatus,\" and so forth ; but first of all the suggestion would have been grotesquely absurd to any one who had been present; and secondly, it is unnecessary to argue about objections of this sort all over again ah initio every time. There wei-e no more wires and springs about the"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION. room I am now referring to, than about the breezy hill-tops at Simla, where some of our earlier phenomena took place. I may add, moreover, that some months later an occult note was dropped before a friend of mine, a Bengal civilian, who has become an active member of the Theosophical Society, at a dak bungalow in the north of India ; and that later again, at the headquarters of the Theosophical Society at Boml^ay, a letter was drojoped according to a previous promise out in the open air in the presence of six or seven witnesses. For some time the gift of the letter from Koot Hoomi in the way I have described was the only phenomenon accorded to me, and, although my correspondence continued, I was not encouraged to expect any further displays of abnormal power. The higher authorities of the occult world, indeed, had by this time put a very much more stringent prohibition upon such manifestations than had been in operation the previous summer at Simla. The effect of the manifestations then accorded was not considered to have been satisfactory on the whole. A good deal of acrimonious discussion and bad feeling had ensued ; and I imagine that this was conceived to outweigh, in its injurious effect on the progress of the Theosophical movement, the good effect of the phenomena on the few persons who appreciated them. When I went up to Simla in August, 1881, there- fore, I had no expectation of further events of an unusual nature. Nor have I any stream of anecdotes to relate which will bear comparison with those derived from the experience of the previous year. But none the less was the progress of a certain undertaking in which I became con- cerned — the estabhshment of a Simla branch of the Theo- sophical Society — interspersed with little incidents of a phenomenal nature. When this society was formed, many letters passed between Koot Hoomi and ourselves which were not in every case transmitted through Madame Blavatsky. In one case, for example, Mr. Hume, who became pre- sident for the first year of the new society — the Simla Eclectic Theosophical Society, as it was decided it should be called — got a note from Koot Hoomi inside a letter received through the post from a person wholly unconnected with our occult pursuits, who was writing to him in connection with some municipal business. I myself, dressing for the"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"122 THE OCCULT WORLD. evening, have found an expected letter in my coat-pocket, and on another occasion under my pillow in the morning. On one occasion, having just received a letter by the mail from England which contained matter in which I thought she would be interested, I went up to Madame Blavatsky's writing-room and read it to her. As I read it, a few hnes of writing, comment upon what I was reading, were formed on a sheet of blank paper which lay before her. She actually saw the writing form itself, and called to me, pointing to the paper where it lay. There I recognized Koot Hoomi's hand — and his thought, for the comment was to the effect, \" Didn't 1 tell you so?\" and referred back to something he had said in a previous letter. By-the-by, it may be as well to inform the reader that during the whole of the visit to Simla of which I am now speaking, for several months before it, and until several months later, Colonel Olcott was in Ceylon, where he was engaged in a very successful lecturing tour on behalf of the Theosophical Society, in reference to some of the phenomena which occured at Simla in 1880 when both he and Madame Blavatsky were present. Ill-natured and incredulous people — when it would be glaringly absurd about some particular phenomenon to say that Madame Blavatsky had done it by trickery of her own — used to be fond of suggesting that the wire-puller must be Colonel Olcott. In some of the news- paper criticisms of the first edition of this book, even, it has- been suggested that Colonel Olcott must be the writer of the letters that I innocently ascribe to Koot Hoomi, Madame Blavatsky merely manipulating their presentation. But inasmuch as all through the autumn of 1881, while Colonel Olcott was at Ceylon and I at Simla, the letters continued to come, alternating day by day sometimes mth the letters we w^rote, my critics, in future, must acknowledge that this hypothesis is played out. For me myself — as I think it wiU also be for my appre- ciative readers — the most interesting fact connected with my Simla experience of 1881 was this : — During the period in question I got into relations with one other of the Brothers, besides Koot Hoomi. It came to pass that in the progress of his own development it was necessary for Koot Hoomi to retire for a period of three months into absolute seclusion, as regards not merely the body — which in the"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION. 123 case of an Adept may be secluded in the remotest corner of the earth without that arrangement checking the activity of liis \" astral\" intercourse with mankind — but as regards the whole potent Ego with whom we had deaUngs. Under these circumstances one of the Brothers with whom Koot Hoomi was especially associated, agreed, rather reluctantly at first, to pay attention to the Simla Eclectic Society, and keep us going during Koot Hoomi's absence with a course of instruction in occult philosophy. The change which came over the character of our correspondence when our new master took us in hand was very remarkable. Every letter that emanated from Koot Hoomi had continued to bear the impress of his gentle melhlluous style. He would write half a page at any time rather than run the least risk of letting a brief or careless phrase hurt anybody's feehngs. His handwriting, too, was always very legible and regular. Our new master treated iis very differently : he declared himself almost unacquainted with our language, and wrote a very rugged hand which it was sometimes difficult to decipher. He did not beat about the bush with us at all. If we wrote out an essay on some occult ideas we had picked up, and sent it to him asking if it was right, it would some- times come back with a heavy red line scored through it, and \" No\" written on the margin. On one occasion one of us had written, \" Can you clear my conceptions about so and so?\" The annotation found in the margin when the paper was returned was, \" How can I clear what you haven't got f and so on. But with all this we made pro- gress under M , and by degrees the correspondence, which began on his side with brief notes scrawled in the roughest manner on bits of coarse Thibetan paper, expanded into considerable letters sometimes. And it must be under- stood that while his rough and abrupt ways formed an amusing contrast with the tender gentleness of Koot Hoomi, there was nothing in these to impede the growth of our attachment to him as we began to feel ourselves tolerated by him as pupils a httle more willingly than at first. Some of my readers, I am sure, will reahze what I mean by \" attachment\" in this case. I use a colourless word delibe- rately to avoid the parade of feelings which might not be generally understood, but I can assure them that in the course of prolonged relations — even though merely of the"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"124 THE OCCULT WORLD. epistolary kind — with a personage who, though a man like the rest of us as regards his natural place in creation, is elevated so far above ordinary men as to possess some attri- butes commonly considered divine, feelings are engendered which are too deep to be lightly or easily described. It was by M quite recently that a little manifestation of force was given for my gratification, the importance of which turned on the fact that Madame Blavatsky was en- tirely uninfluential in its production, and eight hundred miles away at the time. For the first three months of my acquaintance with him, M had rigidly adhered to the principle he laid down when he agreed to correspond with the Simla Eclectic Society during Koot Hoomi's retirement. He would correspond with us, but would perform no phe- nomena whatever. This narrative is so much engaged with phenomena that I cannot too constantly remind the reader that these incidents were scattered over a long period of time, and that as a rule nothing is more profoundly dis- tasteful to the great adepts than the production of wonders in the outside world. Ordinary critics of these, when they have been thus exceptionally accorded, will constantly argue, \" But why did not the Brothers do so and so differently % then the incident would have been much more convincing.\" I repeat that the Brothers, in producing abnormal pheno- mena now and then, are not trying to prove their existence to an intelligent jury of Englishmen. They are simply letting their existence become perceptible to persons with a natural gravitation towards spirituality and mysticism. It is not too much to say that all the while they are scrupu- lously avoiding the delivery of direct proof of a nature cal- culated to satisfy the commonplace mind. For the present, at all events, they prefer that the crass, materialistic Philis- tines of the sensual, selfish world should continue to cherish the conviction that \" the Brothers\" are myths. They reveal themselves, therefore, by signs and hints which are only likely to be comprehended by people with some spiritual insight or afiinity. True the appearance of this book is permitted by them, — no page of it would have been wiitten if a word from Koot Hoomi had indicated disapproval on his part, — and the phenomenal occurrences herein recorded are really in many cases absolutely complete and irresistible proofs for me, and therefore for any one who is capable of"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION. 125 imderstanding that I am telling the exact truth. But the Brothers, I imagine, know quite well that, large as the reve- lation has been, it may safely be passed before the eyes of the public at large just because the herd, whose convictions they do not wish to reach, can be relied upon to reject it. The situation may remind the reader of the farceur who undertook to stand on Waterloo Bridge with a hundred real sovereigns on a tray, offering to sell them for a shilling apiece, and wdio wagered that he would so stand for an hour without getting rid of his stock. He relied on the stupidity of the passers-by, who would think themselves too clever to be taken in. So with this little book. It contains a straightforward statement of absolute truths, which if people could only believe them would revolutionize the w^orld ; and the statement is fortified by unimpeachable cre- dentials. But the bulk of mankind will be bhnded to this condition of things by their own vanity and inability to assimilate super-materialistic ideas, and none will be seriously affected but those who are qualified to benefit by comprehending. Eeaders of the latter class will readily appreciate the way the phenomena that I have had to record have thus followed in the track of my own growing convictions, confirming these as they have in turn been inferentially constructed, rather than provoking and enforcing them in the first instance. And this has been emphatically the case with the one or two phenomena that have latterly been accorded by M . It was in friendship and kindness that these were given long after all idea of confirming my belief in the Brothers was wdiolly superfluous and out of date. M came indeed to wish that I should have the satisfaction of seeing him (in the astral body of course), and would have arranged for this in Bombay, in January, when I went down there for a day to meet my wife, who was returning from England, had the atmospherical and other conditions just at that period permitted it. But, unfortunately for me, these were not favourable. As M wrote in one of several little notes I received from him during that day and the following morning before my departure from the head- quarters of the Theosophical Society, where I was staying, even they, the Brothers, could not \" work miracles ;\" and though to the ordinary spectator there may be but little"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"126 THE OCCULT WORLD. difference between a miracle and any one of the phenomena that the Brothers do sometimes accompHsh, these latter are really results achieved by the manipulation of natural laws and forces and are subject to obstacles which are sometimes practically insuperable. But M , as it happened, was enabled to show himself to one member of the Simla Eclectic Society, who happened to be at Bombay a day or two before my visit. The figure was clearly visible for a few moments, and the face dis- tinctly recognized by my friend who had previously seen a portrait of M . Then it passed across the open door of an inner room in which it had appeared in a direction where there w^as no exit ; and when my friend, wdio had started forward in its pursuit, entered the inner room it was no longer to be seen. On two or three other occasions pre- viously, M had made his astral figure visible to other persons about the headquarters of the Society, where the constant presence of Madame Blavatsky and one or two other persons of highly sympathetic magnetism, the purity of hfe of all habitually resident there, and the constant influences poured in by the Brothers themselves, render the production of phenomena immeasurably easier than elsewhere. And this brings me back to certain incidents Avhich took place recently at my own house at Allahabad, when, as I have already stated, Madame Blavatsky herself was eight hundred miles off\", at Bombay. Colonel Olcott, then on his way to Calcutta, was staying with us for a day or two in passing. He was accompanied by a young native mystic, ardently aspiring to be accepted by the Brothers as a chela, or pupil, and the magnetism thus brought to the house established conditions wdiich for a short time rendered some manifestations possible. Beturning home one evening shortly before dinner, I found two or three telegrams aw-aiting me, enclosed in the usual way in envelopes securely fastened before being sent out from the telegraph ofiSce. The messages were all from ordinary people on common- place business ; but inside one of the envelopes I found a little folded note from M . The mere fact that it had been thus transfused by occult methods inside the closed envelope was a phenomenon in itself, of course (like many of the same kind that I have described before) ; but I need"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION, 127 not dwell on this point, as the feat that had been performed, and of which the note gave me information, was even more obviously wonderful. The note bade me search in my writing-room for a fragment of a plaster bas-relief that M had just transported instantaneously from Bombay. Instinct took me at once to the place where I felt that it was most likely I should find the thing which had been \"brought — the drawer of my writing-table exclusively devoted to occult correspondence ; and there, accordingly, I found a broken corner from a plaster slab, with M 's signature marked upon it. I telegraphed at once to Bombay to ask whether anything special had just happened, and next day received back w^ord that M had smashed a certain plaster portrait, and had carried off a piece. In due course of time I received a minute statement from Bombay, attested by the signatures of seven persons in all, which was, as regards all essential points, as follows : — \" At about seven in the evening the following persons\" (five are enumerated, including Madame Blavatsky) \" were seated at the dining-table at tea in Madame Blavatsky 's verandah opposite the door in the red screen separating her first writing-room from the long verandah. The two halves of the writing-room were wide open, and the dining-table being about two feet from the door, we could all see j^lainly everything in the room. About five or seven minutes after, Madame Blavatsky gave a start. We all began to watch. She then looked all round her, and said, ' What is he going to do X and relocated the same twice or thrice without looking at or referring to any of us. We all suddenly heard a knock — a loud noise, as of something falling and breaking — behind the door of Madame Blavatsky 's writing- room, when there was not a soul there at the time. A st3l louder noise w^as heard, and we all rushed in. The room was empty and silent ; but just behind the red cotton door, where we had heard the noise, w^e found fallen on the ground a Paris plaster mould representing a portrait broken into several pieces. After carefully picking the pieces up to the smallest fragments, and examining it, we found the nail on which the mould had hung for nearly eighteen months, strong as ever in the wall. The iron wire loop of the portrait was perfectly intact, and not even bent.

We found that one j^iece, nearly square and of about two inches, in the right corner of the mould, was wanting. We went into the room and searched for it, but could not find it. Shoi*tly afterwards, Madame Blavatsky suddenly arose and went into her room, shutting the door after her. In a minute she called Mr. in, and showed to him a small piece of paper. We all saw and read it afterwards. It was in the same handwriting in which some of us have received previous communications, and the same familiar initials. It told us that the missing piece was taken by the Brother whom Mr. Sinnett calls 'the Illustrious,'* to Allahabad, and that she should collect and carefully preserve the remaining pieces.\" The statement goes after this into some further details, which are unimportant as regards the general reader, and is signed by the four native friends who were with Madame Blavatsky at the time the plaster jDortrait was broken. A postscript, signed by three other persons, adds that these three came in shortly after the actual breakage, and found the rest of the party trying to ari'ange the fragments on the table. It will be understood, of course, but I may as well explicitly state, that the evening to which the above narra- tive relates was the same on which I found M 's note inside my telegram at x4.11ahabad, and the missing piece of the cast in my drawer ; and no apprecialile time appears to have elapsed between the breakage of the cast at Bombay and the delivery of the piece at Allahabad, for though I did not note the exact minute at which I found the fragment — and, indeed, it may have been already in my drawer for some little time before I came home — the time Avas certainly * \"My illustrious friend,\" was the expression I orisfinally used in application to the Brother I have here called M , and it got shortened afterwards into the pseudonym given in the statement. It is difficult sometimes to know what to call the Brothers, even wlien one knows their real names. The less these are promiscuously handled the better, for various reasons, among which is the profound annoyance which it gives their real disciples if such names get into frequent and disrespectful use among scoffers. I regret now that Koot Hoomi's name, so ardently venerated by all who have been truly subject to his influence, should ever have been allowed to appear in full in the text of the book."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION. 129 between seven and eight, probably about half -past seven or a quarter to eight. And there is nearly half-an-hour's difference of longitude between Bombay and Allahabad, so that seven at Bombay would be nearly half-past at Allaha- bad. Evidently, therefore, the plaster fragment, Aveighing two or three ounces, was really brought from Bombay to Allahabad, to all intents and purposes, instantaneously. That it was veritably the actual piece missing from the cast broken at Bombay was proved a few days later, for all the remaining pieces at Bombay were carefully packed up and sent to me, and the fractuied edges of my fragment titted exactly into those of the defective corner, so that I was enabled to arrange the pieces all together again and complete the cast. The shrewd reader — of the class of persons who would never have been •' taken in\" by the man who sold sovereigns on Waterloo Bridge — will laugh at the whole story. A lump of plaster of Paris sent a distance of eight hundred miles across India in the wink of an eye by the will-power of somebody Heaven knows where at the time — probably in Thibet ! The shrewd person could not manage the feat himself, so he is convinced that nobody else could, and that the event never occurred. Bather believe that the seven Avitnesses at Bombay and the present writer are telling a pack of lies than that there can be any one hving in the world who knows secrets of Nature and can employ forces of Nature that shrewd persons of the I'w^^es-reading, \" Jolly Bank-hohday, three-penny 'bus young man\" type know nothing about. Some friends of mine, criticizing the first edition of this book, have found fault with me for not adopting a more respectful and conciliatory tone towards scientific scepticism when confronting the world with allegations of the kind these pages contain. But I fail to see any motive for hypocrisy in the matter. A great number of intelligent people in these days are shaking themselves free at once from the fetters of materialism forged by modern science and the entangled superstitioji of ecclesiastics, resolved that the Church herself, with all her mummeries, shall fail to make them irreligious ; that science itself, with all its conceit, shall not blind them to the possi- bilities of Nature. These are the people who will under- stand my narrative and the sublimity of the revelations it K"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":",30 THE OCCULT WORLD. embodies. But all people who have been either thoroughly enslaved by dogma, or thoroughly materialized by modern science, have finally lost some faculties, and will be unable to apprehend facts that do not fit in with their preconceived ideas. They will mistake their own intellectual deficiencies for inherent impossibility of occurrence on the part of the fact described; they will be very rude in thought and speech towards persons of superior intuition, who do find themselves able to beheve and, in a certain sense, to under- stand ; and it seems to me that the time has come for letting the commonplace scoffers realize plainly that in the estimation of their more enlightened contemporaries they do indeed seem a Bceotian herd, in which the better educated and the lesser educated — the orthodox savant and the city clerk — differ merely in degree and not in kind. The morning after the occurrence of the incident just detailed, B B , the yoimg native aspirant for cAe?«-ship, who had accompanied Colonel Olcott and was staying at my house, gave me a note from Koot Hoomi, w^hich he found under his pillow in the morning. One which I had written to Koot Hoomi and had given to B R the previous day had been taken, he told me, at night before he slept. The note from Koot Hoomi was a short one, in the course of which he said, \"To force pheno- mena in the presence of difficulties magnetic and other is for- bidden as strictly as for a bank cashier to disburse money which is only entrusted to him. Even to do this much for you so far from the head-quarters w^ould be impossible but for the magnetisms and B E- have brought with them— and I could do no more.\" Not fully realizing the force of the final w^ords in this passage, and more struck by a previous passage in which Koot Hoomi ^\\i^ote — \" It is easy for us to give phenomenal proofs when we have neces- sary conditions\" — I wrote next day suggesting one or two things wdiich I thought might be done to take additional advantage of the conditions presented by the introduction into my house of available magnetism different from that of Madame Blavatsky who had been so much, however absurdly, suspected of imposing on me. I gave this note to B R on the evening of the 13th of March— the plaster fragment incident had taken place on the nth — and on the morning of the 14th I received a few words from"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION. Koot Hoomi, simply saying that what I proposed was impossible, and that he would write more fully through Bombay. When in due time I so heard from him, I learned that the limited facilities of the moment had been exhausted, and that my suggestions could not be complied with ; but the importance of the explanations I have just been giving turns on the fact that I did, after all, exchange letters with Koot Hoomi at an interval of a few hours at a time when Madame Blavatsky was at the other side of India. The account I have just been giving of the instantaneous transmission of the plaster of Paris fragment from Bombay to Allahabad forms a fitting prelude to a remarkable series of incidents I have next to record. The story now to be told has already been made pubhc in India, having been fully related in Psycliic Notes^^ a periodical temporarily brought out at Calcutta, with the object especially of recording in- cidents connected with the spirituahstic mediumship of Mr. Eglinton, who stayed for some months at Calcutta during the past cold season. The incident was hardly ad- dressed to the outside world ; rather to spiritualists, who while infinitely closer to a comprehension of occultism than people still MT?apped in the darkness of orthodox incredulity about all super-material phenomena, are nevertheless to a large extent inclined to put a purely spiritualistic explanation on all such phenomena. In this way it had come to pass that many spiritualists in India were inclined to suppose that we who believed in the Brothers were in some way misled by extraordinary mediumship on the part of Madame Blavatsky. And at first the \" spirit guides\" who spoke through Mr. Eglinton confirmed this view. But a very remarkable change came over their utterances at last. Shortly before Mr. Eglinton's departure from Calcutta, they declared their full knowledge of the Brotherhood, naming the \"Illustrious\" by that designation,. and declaring that they had been appointed to w^ork in concert with the Brothers thenceforth. On this aspect of aftairs, Mr. Eglinton left India in the steamship Vega, sailing from Calcutta, I beheve, on the i6th of March. K. few days later, on the morning of the 24th, at Allahabad, I received a letter from Koot Hoomi, in which he told me that he was * Xewton & Co., Calcutta. K 2"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"T^,2 THE OCCULT WORLD. going to visit Mr. Eglinton on board the Yerja at sea, con- \\T.nce him thoroughly as to the existence of the Brothers, and if successful in doing this notify the fact immediately to certain friends of Mr. Eglinton's at Calcutta. The letter had been written a day or two before, and the night between the 2ist and 22 nd was mentioned as the period when the astral visit would be paid. Now the full explanation of all the circumstances under which this startling programme w^as carried out will take some little time, but the narrative will be the more easily followed if I first describe the out- line of what took place in a few words. The promised \\dsit was actually jxtid, and not only that but a letter written by Mr. Eglinton at sea on the 24th describing it, — and giving in his adhesion to a belief in the Brothers fully and com- pletely, — was transported instantaneously that same evening to Bombay, where it was dropped (\" out of nothing\" like the first letter I received on my return to India) before several witnesses ; by them identified and tied up with cards written on by them at the time ; then taken away again and a few moments later dropped down, cards from Bombay and all, among Mr. Eglinton's friends at Calcutta! who had been told beforehand to expect a communication from the Brothers at that time. All the incidents of this series are authenticated by witnesses and documents, and there is no rational escape for any one who looks into the evidence, from the necessity of admitting that the various phenomena as I have just described them, have actually been accomplished, \" impossible\" as ordinary science will declare them. Eor the details of the various incidents of the series, I may refer the reader to the account published in Fsj/cliic Notes of March 30, by Mrs. Gordon, wife of Colonel ^Y. Gordon, of Calcutta, and authenticated with her signature. Colonel Olcott, Mrs. Gordon explains in the earher part of her statement, which for brevity's sake I condense, had just arrived at Calcutta on a visit to Colonel Gordon and herself. A letter had come from Madame Blavatsky — \"dated Bombay the 19th, telling us that sometliing was going to be done, and expressing tlie earnest hope that she woukl not be required to assist, as she had had enough abuse about phenomena. Before tliis lettei* was brought by the post peon. Colonel Olcott had told me that he had had an intimation in the night from his Chohan (teacher) that K. H. had been to the Yccja and seen Eglinton. This was at about eight o'clock"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION. on Thursday morning, the 23rd. A few hours later a telegram, dated at Bombay, 22nd day, 21 hour 9 minutes, that is, say 9 minutes past 9 p.m. on Wednestlay evening, came to me from Madame Blavatsky, to this effect: 'K. H. just gone to Vega.'' This telegram came as a 'delayed' message, and was posted to me from Calcutta, which accounts for its not reaching me until midday on Thursday. It corroborated, as will be seen, the message of the previous night to Colonel Olcott. We then felt hopeful of getting the letter by occult means from Mr. Eglinton. A telegram later on Thursday asked us to fix a time for a sitting, so we named 9 o'clock Madras time, on Friday 24th. At this hour we three — Colonel Olcott, Colonel Gordon, and myself — sat in the room which had been occupied by Mr. Eglinton. We had a good light, and sat with our chairs placed to form a triangle, of which the apex was to the north. In a few minutes Colonel Olcott saw outside the open window the two * Brothers ' whose names are best known to us, and told us so ; he saw them pass to another window, the glass doors of which were closed. He saw one of them point his hand towards the air over my head, and I felt something at the same moment fall straight down from above on to my shoulder, and saw it fall at my feet in the direction towards the two gentlemen. I knew it would be the letter, but for the moment I was so anxious to see the 'Brothers' that I did not pick up what had fallen. Colonel Gordon and Colonel Olcott both saw and heard the letter fall. Colonel Olcott had turned his head from the window for a moment to see what the ' Brother' was pointing at, and so noticed the letter falling from a point about two feet from the ceiling. When he looked again the two ' Brothers' had vanished. \" There is no verandah outside, and the window is several feet from the ground. \"I now turned and picked up what had fallen on me, and found a letter in Mr. Eglinton's handwriting, dated on the Vecja the 24th ; a message from Madame Blavatsky, dated at Bombay the 24th, written on the backs of three of her visiting cards; also a larger card, such as Mr. Eglinton had a packet of, and used at his seances. On this latter card was the, to us, well-known handwriting of K. H., and a few words in the handwriting of the other 'Brother,' who was with him outside our windows, and who is Colonel Olcott' s chief. All these cards and the letter were thi-eaded together with a piece of blue sewing-silk. We opened the letter carefully, by slitting up one side, as we saw that some one had made on the flap in pencil three Latin crosses, and so we kept them intact for identification. The letter is as follows : — '''S.S. Vega, B>iday, 24th March, 1S82. \" 'My dear Mrs. Gordon, — At last your hour of triumph has come ! After the many battles we have had at the breakfast-table regarding K. H.'s existence, and my stubborn scepticism as to the wonderful powers possessed by the \" Brothers,\" I have been forced to a complete heiief in their being living distinct persons, and just in proportion to my scepticism wall be my firm unalteraUe opinion respecting them. I am not allowed to tell you all I know, but K. \\1. appeared to me in person two days ago, and what he told me dumbfounded me. Perhaps Madame B. will have already communicated the fact of K. H.'s appearance to you. The \"Illustrious\" is uncertain whether this can be taken to Madame or not."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"134 THE OCCULT WORLD. but he will try, notwithstanding the many dillicnllics in the way. If he does not I shall post it when I arrive at port. I shall read this to I^rs. B and ask her lo mark the envelope ; but wludtver happens^ you are requested by K. H. to keep this letter a profound secret until you hear from him through Madame. A storm of opposition is certain to be raised, and she lias had so much to bear that it is haid she should have more.' Then follow some remarks about his health and the trouble which is taking him home, and tbe letter ends. \"In her note on the three visiting cards Madame Blavatsky says: — ' Head-quarters, March 24th. These cards and contents to certify to ray doubters that the attached letter addressed to Mrs. Gordon by Mr. Eglin- ton was just brought to me from the Vega, with another letter from him- self to me, which 1 keep. K. H. tells me he saw Mr. Eglinton and had a talk with him, long and convincing enough to make him a believer in the \"Brothers,\" as actual living beings, for the rest of his natural life. Mr. Eglinton writes to me : \" The letter which 1 enclose is going to be taken to Mrs. G. through your influence. You will receive it wherever you are, and will forward \"it to her in ordinary course.^ You will learn with satisfaction of my complete conversion to a belief in the 'Brothers/ and 1 have no doubt K. H. has already told you how he appeared to me two nights ago,'' &c. &c. K. H. told me all. He does not, however, want me to forward the letter in \" ordinary course,\" as it would defeat the object, but commands me to write this and send it off without delay, so that it would reach you all at Howrah tonight, the 24th. 1 do so H. P. Blavatsky.' \" The handwriting on 'these cards and signature are perfectly well known to us. That on the larger card (from Mr. Eghuton's packet) attached was easily recognized as coming from Koot Hoomi. Colonel Gordon and I know his writing as well as our own ; it is so distinctly different from any other I have\" ever seen, that among thousands I could select it. He says, ' William Eglinton thought _ the manifestation could only be produced through H. P. B. as a \"medium,\" and that the power would become exhausted at Bombay. We decided otherwise._ Let this be a proof to all that the spirit of living man has as much potentiality in it (and often more) as a disembodied soul. He was anxious to tet- her, he often doubted ; two nights ago he had the required proof and will doubt no more. But he is a good young man, bright, honest, and true as gold when once convinced \" ' This card was taken from his stock to-day. Let it be an additional proof of his wonderful mediumship K. H.' \" This is written in blue ink, and across it is written in red ink a few words from the other 'Brother' (Colonel Olcott's Chohan or chief). This interesting and wonderful phenomenon is not published with the idea that any one who is unacquainted with the phenomena of spirit- uaHsm will accept it. But I write for the millions of spiritualists, and also that a record may be made of such an interesting experiment. Who knows but that it may ])ass on to a generation which will be enhghtened enough to accept such wouders?\" A postcript adds, that since the above statement Avas written, a paper had been received from Bombay, signed"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION. by seven witnesses who saw the letter arrive there from the Yeija. As I began by saying, this phenomenon was addressed more to spiritualists than to the outer world because its great value for the experienced observer of phenomena turns on the utterly unmediumistic character of the events. Apart from the testimony of Mr. Eglinton's own letter to the efiect that he, an experienced medium, was quite con- vinced that the interview he had with his occult visitant was not an interview with such \"spirits\" as he had been used to, we have the three-cornered character of the incident to detach it altogether from mediumship either on his part or on that of Madame Blavatsky. Certainly there have been cases in which under the in- fluence of mediumship the agencies of the ordinary spiritual seance have transported letters half across the globe. A conclusively authenticated case in which an unfinished letter was thus brought from London to Calcutta will have attracted the attention of all persons who have their under- standing awakened to the importance of these matters, and who read what is currently pubhshed about them, quite recently. But every spirituahst will recognize that the transport of a letter from a ship at sea to Bombay, and then from Bombay to Calcutta, witli a definite object in view, and in accordance w^ith a pre-arranged and pre-announced plan, is something quite outside the experience of mediumship. AYill the eftbrt made and the expenditure of force what- ever may have been required to accomplish the wonderful feat thus recorded, be repaid by proportionately satisfactory effects on the spiritualistic world % There has been a great deal written lately in England about the antagonism between Spiritualism and Theosophy, and an impression has arisen in some way that the two cultes are incompatible. Now, the phenomena and the experiences of spiritualism are facts, and nothing can be incompatible with fa'cts. But Theosophy brings on the scene new interpretations of those facts, it is true, and sometimes these prove very unwelcome to spirit- ualists long habituated to their own interpretation. Hence, such spiritualists are now and then disposed to resist the new teaching altogether, and hold out against a belief that there can be anywhere in existence men entitled to advance it. This is consequently the important question to settle"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"136 THE OCCULT WORLD. before we advance into the region of metaphysical subtleties. Let spiritualists once realize that the Brothers do exist, and what sort of people they are, and a great step will have been accomplished. Not all at once is it to be expected that the spiritual world will consent to revise its conclusions by occult doctrines. It is only by prolonged intercourse with the Brothers that a conviction grows up in the mind that as regards spiritual science they cannot be in error. At first, let spiritualists think them in error if they please ; but at all events it will be unworthy of their elevated position above the Boeotian herd if they den}^ the evidence of phe- nomenal facts ; if they hold towards occultism the attitude which the crass sceptic of the mere Lankester type occupies towards spiritualism itself. So I cannot but hope that the coruscation of phenomena connected with the origin and adventures of the letter written on board the Vega may have flashed out of the darkness to some good purpose, showing the spiritualistic world quite plainly that the great Brother to whom this work is dedicated is, at all events, a living man, with faculties and powers of that entirely ab- normal kind which spirituahsts have hitherto conceived to inhere merely in beings belonging to a superior scheme of existence. For my part, I am glad to say that I not only know liim to be a living man by reason of all the circumstances detailed in this volume, but I am now enabled to realize his features and appearance by means of two portraits, which have been conceded to me under very remarkable conditions. It was long a wish of mine to possess a portrait of my revered friend ; and some time ago he half promised that some time or other he would give me one. Now, in asking an adept for his portrait, the object desired is not a photo- graph, but a picture produced by a certain occult process which I have not yet had occasion to describe, but with which I had long been familiar by hearsay. I had heard, for example, from Colonel Olcott, of one of the circumstances under which his own original convictions about the realities of occult i:)ower were formed many years ago in New York before he had actually entered on \" the path.\" Madame Blavatsky on that occasion had told him to bring her a piece of paper, which he would be certainly able to identify in order that she might get a portrait precipitated upon it."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION. 137 We cannot, of course, by the light of ordinary knowledge form any conjecture about the details of the process em- ployed ; but just as an adept can, as I have had so many proofs, precipitate writing in closed envelopes, and on the pages of uncut pamphlets, so he can precipitate colour in such a way as to form a picture. In the case of which Colonel Olcott told me he took home a piece of note-pai^er from a club in New York — a piece bearing the club stamp — ^and gave this to Madame Blavatsky. She put it between the sheets of blotting-jiaper on her writing-table, rubbed her hand over the outside of the pad, and then in a few moments the marked paper was given back to him with a complete picture upon it representing an Indian fakir in a state of samadhi. And the artistic execution of this draw- ing was conceived by artists to whom Colonel Olcott after- wards showed it to be so good, that they compared it to the works of old masters whom they specially adored, and affirmed that as an artistic curiosity it was unique and price- less. Now in aspiring to have a portrait of Koot Hoomi, of course I was wishing for a precipitated picture, and it would seem that just before a recent visit Madame Blavatsky paid to Allahabad, something must have been said to her about a possibihty that this wish of mine might be gratified. For the day she came she asked me to give her a piece of thick white paper and mark it. This she would leave in her scrap-book, and there was reason to hope that a certain highly advanced cJiela, or pupil, of Koot Hoomi's, not a full ade^Dt himself as yet, but far on the road to that condition, would do what was necessary to produce the portrait. Nothing happened that day nor that night. The scrap- book remained lying on a table in the drawing-room, and was occasionally inspected. The following morning it was looked into by my wife, and my sheet of paper was found to be still blank. Still the scrap-book lay in full view on the drawing-room table. At half -past eleven w^e went to break- fast ; the dining-room, as is often the case in Indian bunga- lows, only being separated from the drawing-room by an archway and curtains, which were drawn aside. AVhile we were at breakfast Madame Blavatsky suddenly showed by the signs with which all who know her are familiar, that one of her occult friends was near. It w\\is the chela to whom I have above referred. She got up, thinking she"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"138 THE OCCULT WORLD. miglit be required to go to her room ; but the astral visitor, she said, waved her back, and she returned to the table. After breakfast we looked into the scrap-book, and on my marked sheet of paper, which had been seen blank by my wife an hour or two before, was a precipitated profile portrait. The face itself was left white, with only a few touches within the limits of the space it occupied ; but the rest of the paper all round it was covered with cloudy blue shading. Slight as the method was by which the result was produced, the outline of the face was jDerfectly well- defined, and its expression as vividly rendered as would have been possible with a finished picture. At first Madame Blavatsky was dissatisfied with the sketch. Knowing the original personally, she could appre- ciate its deficiencies ; but though I should have welcomed a more finished portrait, I was sufiiciently pleased with the one I had thus received to be reluctant that Madame Blavatsky should try any experiments with it herself with the view of improving it, for fear it would be spoilt. In the course of the conversation, M put himself in com- munication wdth Madame Blavatsky, and said that he would do a portrait himself on another piece of paper. There was no question in this case of a \" test phenomenon ;\" so after I had procured and given to Madame Blavatsky a (marked) piece of Bristol board, it was put away in the scrap-book, and taken to her room, where, free from the confusing- cross magnetisms of the drawing-room, M would be better able to operate. Now it will be understood that neither the producer of the sketch I had received, nor M , in their natural state, are artists. Talking over the whole subject of these occult pictures, I ascertained from Madame Blavatsky that the supremely remarkable results have been obtained by those of the adepts whose occult science as regards this particular process has been superadded to ordinary artistic training. But entirely without this, the adept can produce a result which for all ordinary critics looks like the work of an artist, by merely realizing very clearly in his imagination the result he wishes to produce, and then precipitating the colouring matter in accordance with that conception. In the course of about an hour from the time at which she took away the piece of Bristol board — or the time may"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION. 139 have been less — we were not watching it, Madame Blavatsky brought it me back with another portrait, again a profile, though more elaborately done. Both portraits were obviously of the same face, and nothing, let me saj^ at once, can exceed the purity and lofty tenderness of its expression. Of course it bears no mark of age. Koot Hoomi, by the mere years of his life, is only a man of wdiat we call middle age ; but the adept's physically simple and refined existence leaves no trace of its passage ; and while our faces rapidly wear out after forty — strained, withered, and burned up by the passions to which all ordinary lives are more or less exposed — the adept age for periods of time that I can hardly venture to define, remains apparently the perfection of early maturity. M , Madame Blavatsky 's special guardian still, as I judge by a portrait of him that I have seen, though I do not yet possess one, in the absolute prime of manhood, has been her occult guardian from the time she was a child ; and now she is an old lady. He never looked, she tells me, any different from what he looks now. I have now brought up to date the record of all external facts connected with the revelations I have been privileged to make. The door leading to occult knowledge is still ajar, and it is still permissible for explorers from the outer world to make good their footing across the threshold. This condition of things is due to exceptional circumstances at present, and may not continue long. Its continuance may largely depend upon the extent to which the world at large manifests an appreciation of the opportunity now offered. Some readers who are interested, but slow to perceive what practical action they can take, may ask what they can do to show appreciation of the opportunity. My reply will be modelled on the famous injunction of Sir Eobert Peel : — \" Register, register, register !\" Take the first step towards making a response to the offer which emanates from the occult world — register, register, register; in other words, join the Theosophical Society — the one and only association which at present is linked by any recognized bond of union with the Brotherhood of Adepts in Thibet. There is a Theosophical Society in London, as there are other branches in Paris and America, as well as in India. If there is as yet but little for these branches to do, that fact does not"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"I40 THE OCCULT WORLD. vitiate their importance. After a voter has registered, there is not much for liivfi to do for the moment. The mere gro^vth of branches of the Theosophical Society as associations of people who reahze the sulDhmity of adeptship, and have been able to feel that the story told in this little book, and more fully, if more obscurely, in many greater volumes of occult learning, is absolutely trute — true, not as shadowy religious \"truths\" or orthodox speculations are held to be true by their votaries, but true as the \" London Post-Office Directory\" is true ; as the Parliamentary reports people read in the morning are true ; the mere enrolment of such people in a society under conditions which may enable them sometimes to meet and talk the situation over if they do no more, may actually effect a material result as regards the extent to which the authorities of the occult world will permit the further revelation of the subhme knowledge they possess. Kemember, that knowledge is real knowledge of other worlds and other states of existence — not vague conjecture about hell and heaven and purgatory, but precise knowledge of other worlds going on at this moment, the condition and nature of wdiich the adepts can cognize, as we can the condition and nature of a strange town we may visit. These worlds are linked with our own, and our lives with the lives they support; and will the further acquaintance with the few men on earth who are in a position to tell us more al)out them, be superciliously rejected by the advance guard of the civilized world, the educated classes of England? Surely no inconsiderable group will be sufficiently spiritualized to comjDrehend the value of the present opportunity, and sufficiently j)ractical to follow the advice already quoted, and- THE END.

The attempt to adapt the somewhat cumbrous grammatical system of the Greek and Latin to every other tongue has intro- duced a great deal of unnecessary difficulty into the study of Languages. Instead of analysing existing locutions and endeavouring to discover the principles which regulate them, writers of grammars have for the most part constructed a framework of rules on the old lines, and tried to make the language of which they were treating fit into it. Where this proves im- possible, the difficulty is met by lists of exceptions and irregular forms, thus burdening the pupil's mind with a mass of details of which he can make no practical use. In these Grammars the subject is viewed from a different standpoint ; the structure of each language is carefully examined, and the principles which underlie it are carefully explained ; while apparent discrepancies and so-called irregularities are shown to be only natural euphonic and other changes. All technical terms are excluded unless their meaning and application is self-evident ; no arbitrary rules are admitted ; the old classification into declensions, conjugations, &c., and even the usual 'para- digms and tables, are omitted. Tiius leduced to the simplest principles, the Accidence and Syntax can be thoroughly comprehended by the student on one perusal, and a few hours' diligent study will enable him to analyse any sentence in the language.
