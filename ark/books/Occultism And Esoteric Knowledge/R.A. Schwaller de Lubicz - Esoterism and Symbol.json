The latter comes into being through a fusion of the cosmic Cause which is contained in its materialization with the same Cause which is in us. This is possible because the nature of both Causes is identical. As long as we are placed in duality before Nature, we judge it objectively. \"Original sin\" is the separat ion— hence the opposition—of complementary aspects whose merging makes for Unity, just as the superim- posed colors red and green result in the \"colorless .\" In this Unity, our cerebral intelligence can no lon ger discern anything, and so has no further role to pla y.

But here we must be aware of dis- tinguishing moments of cerebral intelligence from m o- ments of intelligence-of-the-heart. We will return to this later. The origin of the universe being one si ngle and unique source of energy, there is, owing to thi s common paternity, a communion among all things in the world. There is a kinship between a certain min eral and a plant and an animal and a man: They are linke d by being of the \"same nature,\" because in the final analysis, there is only a simple series of basic characteristics whence, by combinations, innumerabl e possibilities emerge. These can, however, be classi fied in a few large families and their subgroups. Despite the variety of the races of humanity, each con- sisting of a multitude of very diverse individuals, all men are organized in essentially the same way. What distinguishes one from another is his state of cons cious- ness and hence his mental control, his particular psychic and sexual life, and consequently his affin ities. The variable moment, therefore, is of an abstract o rder, but can be perfectly well observed and analyzed in its effects. 6"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Esoterism and Symbol On the other hand, the abstract cause in a state of genesis within the concrete—and apparently stable— scheme of man's organic constitution, is beyond rational analysis. A totality of purely bodily experiences evidently maintains this genesis, but individual an d group heredity play a part as well. Here again, one can speak of physiological adaptations transmitted by heredity, but the impulse toward this genesis must nevertheless still be provided by an incomprehensib le moment which, in sum, could be called formless concentration in the transmitting seed. Our common origin is by no means remote. It does not take us b ack into the primeval darkness: It is present and const ant in that man feeds directly or indirectly on all the kingdoms, and thus enters into constant exchange wi th their particular natures and, finally, by way of th e mineral origin, with the cosmic energy from which everything arises. It is completely impossible for our minds to concei ve something which is not a part of concrete Nature an d which we have not experienced through our bodily becoming.

No element of cerebral intelligence is abstract, an d every qualitative or abstract idea results from the comparison of concrete elements. The cerebral organ is formed by stages. For this, t he organism must develop three faculties: that of the senses, that which records observations, and that w hich compares the recorded ideas, namely, memory. Reason , about which we shall speak later, is of a different order. For now, we are still speaking only of the human animal. The senses are the organs by which the \"principial elements\" are perceived. Touch, the tac tile sense, is of the Earth, that is, of everything form ing a material obstacle to the matter of the body. The bo dy of the wind is Earth, as is the body of water, or ston e. The senses are aware of an activity only by opposing it with a resistance of identical nature. Taste is related to Water, and nothing, be it a gas or a solid, can be tasted unless it be slightly dissolved. Thus there is a Water princi ple in everything. The sense of smell belongs to Air becau se nothing can be smelled unless it be volatile, or ma de so, as, for example, by heat. And so there is an Air pr inciple in all things. Sight belongs to Fire: nothing can b e seen without the radiance of Fire, just as a piece of ir on, dark 9"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Esoterism and Symbol in the darkness, becomes dull red and then dazzling white if heated by an invisible energy. The heat of ordinary fire belongs to touch and not to sight. Thus the Fire principle exists in all visibl e things. Hearing belongs to the quint-element, the Word, whi ch becomes perceptible physically and tangibly through sound. The first four senses pass through the brain ; the fifth sense, hearing, passes through the \"heart\" wi thout speaking directly to the brain. It is the spiritual sense, the door to intelligence-of-the-heart. Each thing has its own sound. All things communicate with one another through the principial elements. The spheres to which our human genesis has not yet attained escape us, as long as we cannot transform them and reduce them to the princi - pial element of the spheres of our inborn intellige nce. All scientific instrumentation is but a reduction o f this kind. There are aspects of Fire, Air, Water, and Ea rth which we have not yet experienced in the realms pre - ceding us. It is therefore perfectly reasonable to admit the possible existence of a world interpenetrating the aspect of things now perceptible to us, a world com - posed of exactly the same principial elements, just as there are light waves which our eyes cannot perceiv e (infrared and ultraviolet).

The fact that there is in man, once he has passed b eyond the simple human-animal stage, the possibility of c on- ceiving abstractions which the cerebral intelligenc e can- not understand as such, demonstrates the existence of a world parallel to ours in constitution but entirely different in aspect, extent, and genesis. This gene sis would then be a genesis of return, just as, from th e source to ourselves, there is a genesis of bodily becoming. Cerebral intelligence, which we see developed in th e higher animal aspect of man, is strictly limited by the boundaries imposed on the senses. Intelligence-of-t he- heart, to the contrary, is independent of them, and belongs to the great complex called life. The fundamental character of cerebral intelligence is that it is born of duality, the complementing which may also be called the sexualization of the universe. Q uality is comprehensible only through this opposition of com- plementaries; moreover, the idea of quality exists in Nature only, that is, in the dualized universe. Quality defines quantity, and, inversely, quantity com- pared with another quantity defines quality. Any so - called abstract idea exists only if we can limit it by a quantity. We can be satisfied with words and say, f or example, \"horizon,\" or \"axis,\" and construct senten ces with these words, but as soon as we try to analyze their 11"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Esoterism and Symbol meanings, we are bound to make them objective: othe r- wise, our cerebral ability comes to a halt. An abst rac- tion must be made concrete or else it will be impos sible for us to understand. The word \"axis\" is a typical example, since this id ea, which we qualify as imaginary, cannot be imagined, that is, made objective. Yet the axis (not to be confuse d with \"axle\") is a fundamental characteristic of every ro tating body. This again confirms the probability of an int elli- gence different from that of our cerebral possibili ties since our corporeal world shows us the indisputable existence of functions and even of forms which unqu es- tionably exist, and yet always have been and will r emain entirely beyond the grasp of this single cerebral instrument alone. We have borrowed the term \"intelligence-of-the- heart\" from the ancient Egyptians in order to desig nate that other aspect of man which allows us to penetra te beyond our animal limits and which, in truth, makes for human man's characteristic progression toward divin e Man: the awakening of this original principle that lies dormant in every living human being. 12"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"4 Intelligence-of-the-heart is purely a function of experienced innate consciousness.

Each cell of the heart beats this rhyt hm, and Dr. Carrel's experiment demonstrated what was well known to ancient wisdom concerning innate intelli- gence and consciousness. Each organic being (and ev en each cell of the organs of an organized being) has its part in the general life which is its personal specifica tion. Man's heart is not alone in beating rhythmically li ke a motor: there are aquatic beings that are entirely a heart of this kind and represent the awakening of the con scious- ness which will become \"heart.\" Another consciousne ss will become liver, another will become lung, and th us each function has its organ. Compared with an apparently inert mineral, for example, such an orga n is the incarnation of a consciousness, of a cosmic fun ction which has received corporeal life. A museum accord- ingly classifying \"The Evolution of Consciousness\" or \"The Becoming of Life\" as natural history would be much more authentic than our displays of dead specimens. Every natural object in the universe is a hieroglyp h of divine science. Each animal, each species of plant, each 13"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Esoterism and Symbol mineral group, is a stage in the process of \"becomi ng aware\" of the cosmic Cause, culminating in the com- plete organism of human man, the microcosm*— \"man in His image.\" The whole, thus formed into a complete living being , is a language that speaks. It expresses itself ceasele ssly in its living function, and represents the basis of in telli- gence-of-the-heart, which is the fact that remains related to all of Nature and consequently knows Nature. Knowledge of this kind cannot be objectified, but i t is real. Reality is a fusion of consciousness with the object: there is identity. It is function experienc ed all by itself and innate in the organism which constitutes intelligence-of-the-heart. Obviously, therefore, we must be able to transcribe what is in us into our mental an d objective consciousness, by establishing a relation ship between the life in us and observation of that life in Nature. This we find supremely well expressed by th e ancient Egyptians. It is a knowledge of magic, pure and sane, which can lead rapidly toward the spiritual g oal of our lives, owing to the fact that we can evoke, by means of the sympathy of analogues in our surroundings, t he consciousness of the heart latent in us. *The \"microcosm\" is an image that makes it possible to perceive the idea being developed here. In reality, man is the univer se, and not a miniature universe in the image of a large one. 14"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"5 Fundamentally, consciousness has two aspects: one is the result of comparisons, the other of identification.

It would be absurd to expect an identical functioni ng for cerebral consciousness and innate consciousness . The meaning of the term \"consciousness\" must be outlined and defined. We lack a suitable vocabulary for this meaning as we find it established in the ancie nt Egyptian and Hindu languages by masters of wisdom. So let us say that cerebral consciousness is the re sult of quantitative experience, a mechanical consciousness resulting from comparison. Memory in itself is no m ore than a phonograph record or cinematographic film. A single impression is no more than an isolated groov e of this record or one frame of this film. Functional memory, the definition of an impression recorded in this fashion, begins only with comparison.

The entire cerebral mechanism can be reproduced mechani cally. So much the better, as this will show the most obtu se of us where the error lies. But when we want to go bey ond academic know-how — that sclerosis of the spirit — to fertile thought, the cerebral mechanism is no longe r adequate. When we just said that we must necessaril y turn to what constitutes true magic, namely, evocat ion, and that there is agreement or disagreement in the assemblage of recalled ideas, we were appealing to another power in us which comes from our innate consciousness, the source of the sense of harmony. If it is effective, this power will be the reason for gen ius, for creative thought, creative in the sense that it wor ks ahead of the known, the classified. Isn't it this consciousness of a new way, dictated to today's decadent world, which impels artists to des troy the idols of yesterday in order to attempt irration al expressions? They seek a concordance of the elements of \"sensa- tions,\" ignoring the rational combinations which on ly satisfy the inertia of acquired habit.

It is sympathetic consciousnes s, not a subjective consciousness such as logic would like t o oppose to objective consciousness. Yet confusion between the two is easy: cerebral consciousness is graphically inscribed in the cerebral matter, as we have just stated. Innate consciousness is inscribed in t he nature of the organism, meaning that the motive pow er of its function is the impulse of its necessity, th e Idea, or principle of harmony. In man, as already in the hig her animal, this creates emotivity. The greater the sensitivity of the emotional facult y, the better innate consciousness can express itself. If, then, the observed fact provokes a sensation, an emotiona l reaction of an egocentric order, this will be subje ctive consciousness. If the fact is observed by an indivi dual in a state of neutrality, an impersonal state, this wi ll be sympathetic consciousness. All these problems thus have their solution in the cultivation of self, in detach- ment from egoism, in the mastery of thought, of men - tation, the cerebral cinema.

Many attempts have been made to define life, but th e only perfect definition would be that of life as di vine Presence.

But anesthesia or catalepsy brings about all this to some extent, as does deep natural sleep. Actually, a body is not dead until it decomposes in to its constituent elements.

If we are able to prevent the intervention of reaso ning— that faculty distinguishing us from the animal prop erly so-called, and which we constantly abuse—then simpl e cerebral intelligence does no more than translate i nnate consciousness, as in the case of animal instinct. Our senses suffice for the observation of instincti ve effects. They are in touch with the four principial elements which are the constituents of Nature. But to know innate consciousness, we must hearken t o it, make use of the spiritual sense which is Hearin g; similarly, the thumb serves as the finger of spirit in rela- tion to the four (elemental) fingers of the hand.

From that instant, we know what it means or, less s ubtly phrased, we have an intuition of the answer to the ques- tion which has arisen. Intuition means hearing the voice of silence that s peaks in all lived Nature, innate in us, with a cosmic di n. Intelligence-of-the-heart is knowing how to transla te this noise. Thus the purpose of initiatory texts is far less a logical one than it is to provoke shocks, emotional reactio ns, or to grate against the cerebral need for sequentia l logic.

Nouns, generally without con- nections between them, make a kind of telegraphic s tyle of writing.

The Kabbalah, on the other hand, speaks of the metaphysical history of this Genesis, as does the Apocalypse in the Gospels. There is a parallelism in these two modes of revelation, even though they are basically very different.
